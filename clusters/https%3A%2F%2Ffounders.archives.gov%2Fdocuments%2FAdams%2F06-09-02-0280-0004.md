The Amount of the ordinary Commerce external and internal of a Society may be computed at a fixed Sum, a certain Sum of Money is necessary to circulate among the Society, in order to carry on their Business. This precise Sum is discoverable by Calculation and reduceable to Certainty. You may emit paper or any other Currency for this purpose, until you reach this Rule, and it will not depreciate; after you exceed this Rule it will depreciate, and no power or Act of Legislation hitherto invented, can prevent it. In the Case of paper Money, if you go on emitting forever the whole Mass will be worth no more than that was which was emitted within the Rule. When the paper therefore comes to be redeemed, this is the only Rule of Justice for the Redemption of it. The Congress have fixed Five Millions for this Rule, wether this is mathematically exact, I am not able to say, whether it is a Million too l

than that was which was emitted within the rule.”—J. Adams’s Works,  
Vol. VII. p. 195.  
  
The precise deficit in this fixed sum caused by driving the specie out  
of circulation was perfectly well known not to exceed, at the utmost, two

ing these remarks the views of John Adams, who was  
one of the arst to discover a plan to set the prin­  
 ciples of paper currency circulation in a clear light,  
will be in place.  
The amount of ordinary commerce, internal and  
external, of a country may be commuted at a fixed  
sum. A certain amount of money is needed to cir-­  
culate among a society, to enable them to carry on  
their business. This precise sum is discoverable by  
calculation and reduceable to certainty. You may  
emit paper or any other currency for your vurpose  
until you reach this rute, and it will not depreciate.  
After you exceed the rule it will depreciate, and no  
power or act of legistation hitherto invented will  
prevent it. In the case of paper, it you go on emit­  
ting forever the whole mase will be no more than  
that was whicn was emitted within the rule.&quot; How  
far Adams was right is shown in the above table,  
and it may be fairy inferred that paper money  
based on national er dit will not depreiate excep
