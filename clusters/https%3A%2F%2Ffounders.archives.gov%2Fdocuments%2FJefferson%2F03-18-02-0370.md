Monticello June 1. 22.  
  
It is very long, my dear Sir, since I have written to you. my dislocated wrist is now become so stiff that I write slowly and with pain, and therefore write as little as I can. yet it is due to mutual friendship to ask once in a while how we do? the papers tell us that Genl Starke is off at the age of 93. Charles Thomson still lives at about the same age, chearful, slender as a grasshopper, and so much without memory that he scarcely recognises the members of his household. an intimate friend of his called on him not long since: it was difficult to make him recollect who he was, and, sitting one hour, he told him the same story 4. times, over. is this life?   —with lab’ring step  
to tread our former footsteps? pace the round  
Eternal?—to beat and beat  
The beaten track? to see what we have seen  
To taste the tasted? o’er our palates to decant  
Another vintage?—   it is at most but the life of a cabbage, surely not worth a wish. when all our faculties have left, or are leaving us, one by one, sight, hearing, memory, and every avenue of pleasing sensation is closed, and athumy, debility and mal-aise left in their places, when the friends of our youth are all gone, and a generation is risen around us whom we know not, is death an evil?  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
When one by one our ties are torn,  
  
  
   
  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight  
  
  
  
  
And friend from friend is snatched forlorn  
  
  
  
And films slow gathering dim the sight,  
  
  
  
  
When man is left alone to mourn,  
  
  
  
When clouds obscure the mental light  
  
  
  
  
Oh! then how sweet it is to die!  
  
  
  
Tis nature’s kindest boon to die!  
  
  
  
I really think so. I have ever dreaded a doting old age; and my health has been generally so good, and is now so good, that I dread it still. the rapid decline of my strength during the last winter has made me hope sometimes that I see land. during summer I enjoy it’s temperature, but I shudder at the approach of winter, and wish I could sleep through it with the Dormouse, and only wake with him in spring, if ever. they say that Starke could walk about his room. I am told you walk well and firmly. I can only reach my garden, and that with sensible fatigue. I ride however daily. but reading is my delight. I should wish never to put pen to paper; and the more because of the treacherous practice some people have of publishing one’s letters without leave. Ld Mansfield declared it a breach of trust, and punishable at law. I think it should be a penitentiary felony. yet you will have seen that they have drawn me out into the arena of the newspapers. altho’ I know it is too late to be for me to buckle on the armour of youth, yet my indignation would not permit me passively to recieve the kick of an Ass.  
To turn to the news of the day, it seems that the Cannibals of Europe are going to eating one another again. a war between Russia and Turkey is like the battle of the kite and snake. whichever destroys the other, leaves a destroyer the less for the world. this pugnacious humor of mankind seems to be the law of his nature, one of the obstacles to too great multiplication provided in the mechanism of the Universe. the cocks of the henyard kill one another up. boars, bulls, rams do the same. and the horse, in his wild state, kills all the young males, until worn down with age and war, some vigorous youth kills him, and takes to himself the Haram of females. I hope we shall prove how much happier for man the Quaker policy is, and that the life of the feeder is better than that of the fighter: and it is some consolation that the desolation by these Maniacs of one part of the earth is the means of improving it in other parts. let the latter be our office, and let us milk the cow, while the Russian holds her by the horns, and the Turk by the tail. God bless you, and give you health, strength, and good spirits, and as much of life as you think worth having

When man is lett alone to mourn,  
Oh 1 then, how sweet it is to die !  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight,  
Anu films slow gathering dim the sight;  
When clouds obscure the mental light,  
’Tis nature’s kindest boon to die !  
1 really think so. 1 have ever dreaded  
a doatmg old age ; and my health has been  
generally so good, and is now so good,that  
i dread it still. The rapid decline of my  
strength during the last winter, has made  
me hope sometimes that 1 see land. Du­  
ring summer, l enjoy its temperature, but  
I shudder at4be approach of winter, and  
wish 1 could sleep through it with the dor*  
mouse, and only wake with him in spring,  
it ever. They lay that Starke could walk  
about bis room. I am told that you walk  
well and firmly. I can only reach my gar­  
den, and that with sensible fatigue. 1 ride,  
however, daily ; but reading is my delight.  
  
1 should wish Mfft fo put pen to paper ;  
and the more because of the treacherous  
practice some people have of publishing  
one’s letters without leave. Lord Mans­  
field declared it a breach of trust, and  
punisba ble at law. I think it should be a  
penitentiary felony; yet you will have  
seen that they have drawn me out into the  
arena ot the newspapers. Although I  
k now i t is too late for me to buckle on the  
armour of youth, yet my indignation would  
not permit.me passively to receive the  
kick of an ass.  
To ‘urn to the news of the day, it seems  
that the cannibals oi Europe arc going to  
eating one another again. A war between  
Russia and Turkey is like the battle of the  
kite and snake ; whichever destroys the  
other, leaves a destroyer the less for the  
world. This pugnacious humor ot man­

of the obstacles to too great multiplication

Monticello, June 1, 1822.  
It is very long, my dear sir, since I  
have written to you. My dislocated  
wrist is now become so stiff, that 1 write  
slowly and with pain; and, therefore,  
write as little as 1 can. Yet it is due  
to mutual friendship to ask once in a  
while how we do ? The papers tell  
us that Gen. Starke is off at the age of  
ninety-three. ***** still lives, at about  
the same age, cheerful, slender as a  
grasshoper, and so much without mem­  
ory, that he scarcely recognizes the  
members es his household. An inti­  
mate friend of his called on him not  
long since. It was difficult to make  
him recollect who he was ; and sitting  
one nour, he toid him the same story  
four times over. Is this lue 1 with  
lab’ring step  
To tread our former footsteps ? pace the’ round  
Eternal ? to beat and beat  
The beaten track—to see what we have seen—  
To taste the tasted—o’er our palates to de­  
cant  
Another vintage ?  
It is, at most, but the life of a cab­  
bage, sorely not worth a wish. When  
all our faculties have left, or arc leaving  
us, one by one—sight, hearing, memory,  
every avenue of pleasing sensation is  
closed, and athumy, debility, and rnal­  
vaise left in their places, when the friends  
of our youth are all gone, and a gene­  
ration is riseD mound us whom we knew  
vvi, jo uchlm uu evil I  
W hen one by one our ties are torn,  
And friend from friend is snat&lt; h’d forlorn :  
W hen man is left alone to mourn,  
Ob, then, how sweet it is to die !  
When trembling limbs refuse th&lt; ir weight,  
And films slow gathering dim the sight ;  
When cloud?oßscure the mental light,  
’Tis native’s kindest boon to die !  
I really think so. I have ever dread­  
ed a doting old age; and my health has  
been generally so good, ami is now so  
good, that I dread it still. The rapid  
decline of my strength, during the last  
winter, ha? made me hope sometimes  
that 1 set land. During summer, 1 en­  
joy its temperature ; but 1 shudder at the  
approach of winter, and wish I could  
sleep through it with the dormouse, and  
only wake with him to spring, if ever.  
They say that Starke could walk about  
his room. lam told you walk well and  
firmly. I can only reach my garden,  
and that with sensible fatigue. I ride,  
however, daily ; but reading is my de­  
iight. 1 should wish never to put pen  
to paper; and the more because of the  
treacherous practice some people have  
of publishing one’s letters without leave.  
Lord Mansfield declared it a breach of  
trust, and punishable at law. I think it  
should be a penitentiary felony ; yet  
you will have seen that they have  
drawn me out into the arena of the  
newspapers. Although I know it is too  
late, for me to buckle on the armour of  
youth, yet my indignation would not  
permit me passively to receive the kick  
of an ass.  
To turn to the news of the day, it  
seems that the cannibals of Europe are  
going to eating one another again. A  
war between Russia and Turkey, is like  
the battle of the kite and snake ; which­  
ever destroys the other, •leaves a de­  
stroyer the less for the world. This  
pugnacious humour** Mankind seems  
to be the law ol his nature, one of the  
obstacles to too great multiplication pro­  
vided in the mechanism of the universe.  
The cocks oi the hen-yard kill one a­  
nothcr; bears, bulls, rams, do the same ;  
and the horse, in his wild state, kills all  
the young males, until worn down with  
age and war, some vigorous youth kills  
him. ***** 1 hope we shall prove how  
much happier for man the Quaker poli­  
cy is, and that the life of the feeder is  
better than that of the fighter—and it is  
some consolation that the desolation by  
these maniacks of one part of the earth,  
is the means of improving it in other  
parts. Let the latter be our office; and  
  
let us milk the cow, while the Russian  
hold* her by the horns, and the Turk  
by the tail. God bless you, and give  
you health, strength, good spirits, and

Monticello, June 1, 1822.  
It is very long, my dear sir, since I  
have written to you. My dislocated  
wrist is now become so stiff that I write  
slowly and with pain; and, therefore,  
write as little as I cau. Yet it is due to  
mutual friendship to ask once in a while  
how wedo? The papers tell us that  
Gen. Starke is off at the age of 93.--*#*#*  
still lives, at about the same age, cheerful,  
slender as a grasshopper, and so much  
without memory that he scarcely recog-  
nises the members of his household. An  
intimate friend of his called on him not  
long since. It was diflicult to make him  
recollect who he was, and sitting one  
hour, he told him the same story four  
times over. Is this life &gt;—with lab’ring

When trembling limbs refuse their weight,

*Tis nature’s kiudest boon to die !  
Treally think so. I have ever dreaded  
a doting old age ; and my health has been  
generally so good and is now so good, |  
that [ dread it still. The rapid decline |  
of my strength during the last winter has  
made me hope sometimes that I see land,  
Daring summer, I enjoy its temperature,  
but I shudder at the approach of winter,  
and wish I’ could sleep through it with  
the dormouse, and only wake with him |  
in spring, if ever.—They say that Starke |  
could walk about his room. [I ain told ,  
you walk well and firmly. I can only,  
reach my garden, and that with sensible |  
fatigue. I ride, however, daily ; but |  
reading is my delight. 1 should wish’  
never to put pen to paper ; and the more |  
because of the treacherous practice some |  
  
  
  
without leave. Lord Mansfield declared  
it a breach of trust, and punishable at law.  
I think it should be a penitentiary felony ;  
yet you will have seen that they have  
drawn me out into the arena of the news-  
papers. Although I know itis too late for  
me to buckle on the armour of youth, yet  
my indignation would not permit me pas-  
sively to receive the kick of on ass.

MONTICELLO, JUNE 1, 18 22.

When man is left alone lo mourn,  
Oli, then, how sweet it is to die!  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight,  
And films slow gathering dim the sight;  
When clouds obscure (lie mental light,  
’ I&#x27;is natures kindest boon to die!  
I really think so. I have ever dread­  
ed a doaiing old ago; and my health j  
has been generally so good, and is now |  
so good, that I dread it still. The rapid j  
decline of my strength during the last  
winter has made me hope sometimes  
that I see land. During summer I en­  
joy its temperature, but shudder at the  
approach of winter, and wish I could  
sleep through it with the dormouse, and  
only wake with him in spring, if ever.—  
They say that Starke could walk about  
bis room. I am told that you walk w II  
and firmly. I can only reach my garden,  
and that with sensible fatigue. I ride,  
  
lotrever, daily; but reading is my da  
ight. 1 should wish never to put pen  
0 paper; and the more because ot the  
reacheruus practice some people have  
jf publishing one’s letter without leave.  
Lord Mansfield declared it a breach ot  
trust, and punishable at law. I think it  
should be a penitentiary felony ; yet you  
will have seen that they have drawn mo  
uut into the arena of the newspapers.—  
Although I know it is too late for me to  
buckle on the armour of youth, yet my  
indignation would not permit me pas- ,  
sively to receive the kick ol an ass.  
To turn to liie news of the dnv, it scums |  
that the cannibals of Europe are going to  
eating one another again. A war be­  
tween Russia and Turkey is like the bat­  
tle of the kite and snake ; whichever de­  
stroys the other, leaves a destroyer less  
for the world. This pugnacious humor  
of mankind seems to be the law ol his na­  
ture, one of the obstacles to the great  
multiplication provided in the mechanism  
of the Universe The cocks of die hen  
yard kill oik another; bears, Ini I Is, rams,

state, kills all the young males, until

temperature, but I shudder at ihs afiproach of winter, and wish I could  
sleep through it with the dormouse, and only wake with him in spring,  
if ever. They say that Starke could walk about his room. I am told  
you walk well and firmly. I can only reach my garden, and that with

should wish never to put pen to paper | and the more becatisa of ilm

Mont icello, June 1, 1822.  
  
It is very long, my dear sir, since I have written  
to you. My dislocated wrist is now become so  
stiff that I write slowly, and with pain; and, there*  
fore, write as little as I can. Yet it is due to mu-  
tual friendship to ask once in awhile how we do?  
The papers tell us that General Starke is ofl&quot; at  
the age of ninety-three — * * * * still lives, at about  
the same age, cheerful, slender as a grasshopper,  
and so much without memory that he scarcely re-  
cognises the members of his household. An  
intimate friend of his called upon him not long  
since. It was difficult to make him recollect who  
he was, and setting one hour, he told hint the same  
story four times over. Is this life ? with laboring  
step  
  
T o tread our former footsteps? pace the round  
  
Eternal? — to beat and beat  
  
The beaten track — to see what wc have seen--  
  
To taste the tasted — o’er our palates to decant  
  
Another vintage 1  
  
It is, at most, but the life of a cabbage, surely  
r.ot worth a wish. When all our faculties have  
left, or arc leaving us, one by one, sight, hearing,  
memory, every avenue of pleasing sensation is  
closed, and athumy. debility, and malaise left in  
their places, when the friends of our youth are  
all gone; and a generation is risen around us whom  
we know not, is death an evil ?

It is very long, my dear sir, since | huve written to

little as T can. Yet it is due to mutual friendship: to

avenue of pleasing sensation is closed, and athuiny,  
debility, and mal-aise, left in their places? when the  
frends of our youth are all gone, and a generation is  
risen around us, whom we know not, is death an evil ?  
  
When one by one our ties are torn,  
And friend from friend is snatch&#x27;d forlorn ?  
When man is left alone to monrn,

When man is left alone to mourn.  
Oh, then, how sweet it is to die!  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight,  
And films slow guthering dim the sight;  
When clouds obsoure the mental light,  
&quot;Tis nature&#x27;s kindest boon to die!  
I really think so. I have ever dreaded a  
doting old age; and my health has been gen  
erally so good that I dread it still. Ihe rap  
id decline of my strength during the last win  
ter has made me hope sometimes that I see  
land. During the summer, I enioy its tem  
perature, but I shuddered at the approach of  
winter, and wish I could sleep through it  
with the dormouse, and only wake with him  
in the spring, if ever. They say that Stark  
could walk about his room. I am told that  
you walk well and &quot;firmly. I can only reach  
my garden, and that with sensible fatigue.  
I ride, ho wever, daily; but reading is my de-  
light. I should never wish to put pen to pa­  
per; and the more because of that treacher­  
ous practice some people have, of publishing  
one&#x27;s letters without leave. Lord Mansfield  
declared it a breach of trust and punishable  
at law. I think it should be a penitentiary  
felony; yet you will have seen that they have  
drawn me out into the arena of the newspa  
pers. Although I know it is too late for me  
to buckle on the armour of youth, yet my in­  
dignation would not permit me passively to  
receive the kick of an ass.  
To return to the news of the day, it seems  
that the cannibals of Europe are going to eat  
one another again. A war between Russia  
and Turkey is like the battle of the kite and  
snake; which ever destroys the other, leaves  
a destroyer the less for the world. The pug  
nacious humor of mankind seems to be the  
law of his nature; one of the obstacles is too  
great mult plication, provided in the mechan  
ism of the universe. The cocks of the hen  
yard kill one another; bears, bulls, rams do  
the same, the horse in his wild state kills all  
the young males until worn down with age  
ae oe goos ontti i

MoNTicELLO, June 1, 1822.  
&quot;It is very long, my dear sir, since I have  
written to you. My dislocated wrist is now  
become so stiff that I write slowly and with  
pain; and, therefore, write as little as I can.  
Yet it is due to friendship to ask once in a  
while how we do? The papers tell us that  
Gena Starke is of the age of ninety-three.  
still lives, at about the same age, cheer  
ful, slender as a grass-hopper and so much  
without memory that he scarcely recognizes  
the members of his houschold. An intimate  
friend of his called on him not long since. It  
was difficult to make him recollect who he was  
and sitting one hour he told him the same  
story four times over. Is this life--with lab  
ring step  
&quot;To tread our former footsteps! pace the round  
Eternal?-to beat and beat  
The beater track--to see what we have seen-  
To taste the tasted--o&#x27;er palates to descant  
Another vintage?  
&quot;It is, at most, but the life of a cabbage,  
surely not worth a wish. When all our fac  
ulties have left, or are leaving us one by one;  
sight, hearing, memory, every avenue of pleas­  
ing sensation is closed, and athumy, debility,  
mal-aise left in their places, when the friends  
of our youth are all gone, and a generation is  
risen around us whom we know not, is death  
an evil?  
&quot;When one by one our ties are torn

When man is left alone to mourn,  
Oh, then, how sweet it is to die!  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight,  
And films slow gathering dim the sight;  
When clonds obscure the mental light,  
&quot;Tis nature&#x27;s kind est boon to die!&quot;  
  
&quot;I really think so. I have ever dreaded a  
doating age; and my health has been general  
ly so good, and is now so good, that I  
dread it still. The rapid decline of my  
strength durine the last winter has made me  
hope sometimes that I see land. During sum­  
mer I enjoy its temperature; but I shudder at  
the approach of winter, and wish I could sleep  
through it with the doremouse, and only wake  
with him in spring, if ever. They say that  
Stark could walk about his room. I am told  
you walk well and firmly. I can only reach  
my garden, and that with sensible fatigue. I  
ride how ever daily; but reading is my delight;  
I sh ull wish never to put pen to paper; and  
the more becanse of the treacherous practice  
some people have of publishing one&#x27;s letters  
wrthout leave. Lord Mansfield declared it a  
bre ach of trust, and punishable at law. I  
think it should be a penitentiary felony: yet  
you will have seen that they have drawn in­  
out in the arena of the newspapers. Although  
I know it is too late for me to buckle on the ar  
mor of my youth. yet my indignation would  
not permit mne passively to receive the kick of  
all a88.  
  
To turn to the news of the day, it seens  
that he cannibals of Europe are going to eat  
ing one another again. A war bety een Rus­  
sin and Turkey is like the battle of the kite  
and snake; w hichever destroys the other leaves  
a destroyer less for the world.  
&quot;This pugnacious humor of mankind seems  
to be the law of his nature, one of the obstacles  
to too great multiplication provided in the me­  
chanisin of the Universe. The cocks of the  
hen vard kill one another; bers, bulls, rams, do  
the same, and he horse, in his wild state, kills  
the young males, until worn down with age  
and war, some vigorous youth kills him.  
I hope we shall prove how much happier for  
man the Quaker policy is and that the life of the  
f ede sibet er than that of the fighter; and it is  
some consolation that the desolation by these  
maniacs of one part of the earth, is the means  
  
of improving it in other parts. Let the latter  
be our office; and let us milk the cow, while  
the Russian holds her by the horns, and the  
Turk by the tail. God bless you and give you  
health, strength, good spirits, and as much life  
as you think worth having.

Moxtk ei.i.o , June 1st, 182:2.  
It i s very long, my dear sir, since I  
have written to you. My dislocated  
wrist is now become so stiff that I write  
slowly and with pain, and therefore  
write as little as I can. Yet it is due to  
mutual friendship to ask once in a while  
how you do. The papers tell us that  
Gen. Starke is off at the age of ninety­  
three. A—still lives, at about the  
same age, cheerful, slender as a grass­  
hopper, and so much without memory  
that lie scarcely recognizes his own  
household. Intimate friends of his  
called 011 him not long since. It was  
difficult to make him understand or  
recollect who he was, and sitting one  
hour he told him the, same story four  
times over. Is this life ? with laboring  
steps—  
To tread our former footsteps ? pace the round  
&#x27;Die beaten truck—to see wliat  
To taste the tasted—o&#x27;er our palets descant  
Another vintage.  
It is but most the life of a cabbage, sure­  
ly not worth a wish. When all our  
faculties have left, or are leaving us  
one by one, sight, hearing, memory,  
every avenue of pleasing sensation, is  
closed, and , debility and mal-aise  
left in their places, when the friends of  
their youth are all gone, and a genera­  
tion is risen around us whom we know  
not, is death an evil f  
When one by one, our ties are torn  
And friend from friend is snatch&#x27;d forlorn,  
When man is left alone to mourn,  
Oil ! then how sweet it is to die !  
When trembling limbs refuse their weight  
And films, slow gathering, dim the sight;  
When elouds obscure the mental light,  
&#x27;Tis nature&#x27;s kindest boon to die!  
I really think so. I have ever dreaded  
a doting old age, and my health has  
been generally so good that I dread it  
still. The rapid decline of my strength  
during the last winter has made me  
hope sometimes that I see land. Dur­  
ing summer I enjoy its temperature,  
but I shudder at the approach of win­  
ter and wish I could sleep through it  
with the dormouse, and only wake with  
him, if ever. They say that Starke  
cottkl walk about his room. I am told  
you walk well and firmly. I can only  
reach my garden, and that with sensi­  
ble fatigue. I ride, however, daily;  
but reading is my delight. I should  
wish never to put my pen to paper, and  
the more because of the treacherous  
practice some people have of publishing  
ones letters without leave. Lord Mans­  
field declared it a breach of trust and  
punishable at law. I think it should  
be a penitentiary felony ; yet you will  
have seen that they have drawn me out  
into the area of the newspapers. Al­  
though I know it is too late for me to  
buckle on the armor of youth, yet my  
indignation would not permit me pas  
sively to receive the kick of an ass.  
To turn to the news of the day, it  
seems that the cannibals of Europe are  
going to eating one another again. A  
war between Russia and Turkey is like  
the battle of the kite and snake ; which­  
ever destroys the other leaves a des­  
troyer the less for the world. This pug­  
nacious humor of mankind seems to be  
the law of his nature—one of the ob­  
stacles to too great multiplication pro­  
vided in the mechanism of the universe  
The cocks of the hen-yard kill one an­  
other ; bears, bulls, rams, do the same ;  
and the horse, in his wild state, kills  
all the young males until, worn out with  
age and war, some vigorous youth kills  
him. I hope we shall prove how much  
happier for man the Quaker policy is,  
and that the life of the feeder is better  
than that of the fighter ; and it is some  
consolation that the desolation of these  
manies of one part of the earth is the  
means of improving the other parts.  
Let the latter be our office, and let us  
milk the cow while the Russians hold  
her by the horns and the Turks by the  
tail. God bless you and give you  
strength, and as much of life as you  
think worth having.

Mohtickllo, June 1, 1822.  
To return to the news of the  
day; it seems that the Cannibals of  
Europe are going to eat one another  
again. A war between Russia and  
Turkey is like the battle between the  
kite and snake; whichever destroys  
the other leaves a destroyer less for  
the world. This pugnacious humor of  
mankind seems to be the law of his  
nature; one of the obstacles to too  
great multiplication, provided in the  
mechanism of the universe. The cocks  
of the henyard kill one another; bears,  
bulls, rams, do the same; and the  
horse in his wild state kills all the  
young males, until, worn down with  
age and war, some vigorous youth  
hills him . . . . tope wc shall prove  
iow much happier for man the  
Quaker jolicy is, and that the life of  
the feeder is better than that of the  
fighter. And it is some consolation  
that the desolation by these maniacs  
of oue part of the earth is the means  
of improving it in other parts. Let  
the latter be our office; and let us milk  
the cow while the Russian holds her

MoNTiCELLO, June 1, 1822.  
It is very long, my dear sir, since I have  
written to you. My dislocated wrist is now  
become so stiff that I write slowly and with  
pain; and therefore I write as little as I can.  
Yet it is due to mutual friendship to ask once in  
a while how we do. The papers tell us that  
Gen Stark is off at the age of ninety-three.  
still lives at about the same age, cheer­  
ful, slender as a grasshopper, and so much  
without memory that he scarcely recognizes  
the members of his household. An intimate  
friend of his called on him not long since.  
It was difficult to make him recollect who he  
was, and sitting one hour he told the same  
story four times over. Is this life?  
With lab&#x27;ring step  
To tread our former footsteps!--pace the round  
Eternal?--to beat and beat  
The beaten track--to see what we have seen  
To taste the tasted--o&#x27;er our palates to descant  
anether vintage!  
It is, at most, but the life of a cabbage,  
surely not worth a wish. When all our facul­  
ties have left, or are leaving us one by one,  
sight, hearing, memory, every avenue of  
pleasing sensation closed, and athumy, de­  
bility, and mal-aise left in their places; when  
the friends of our youth are all gone, and a  
generation is risen around whom we know  
not;--is death an evil?  
When one by one our ties are torn

Monti(!km.o, Juno 1, 1822.  
It is very lon8, my dear sir, since I Iihvo  
written to you. My dislocated wiist is  
now become so stiff that I write slowly  
and with pain; and, therefore, write hh  
little as I can. Yet it is duo to mutual  
friendship to ask once in a while bow we  
do? The p- pers tells us that Oen. Htsrko  
is off at the age of ninety three.—  
Htill lives, at about the same age, cheerful,  
slender as a grasshopper, and so much  
without memory that he scarcely recog­  
nizes the members of Ids household. An  
intimate friend of his called on him not  
long since. It was d.fllcult to make him  
recollect who he was, and sitting one  
hour, he told him the same story four  
times over. Is this lift?- with tabbing  
step  
To tread our forrper footsteps? pace the  
round  
Bternal?—to beat and heat  
I&#x27;he beaten trsck—to see what we have  
Been—  
To taste the tasted—o’er or palates to des  
cant  
Another vintage?  
It is, at. most, hut the life of a eabbage,  
surely not worth a wish. When all our  
faculties have left, or are all leaving ns  
one by one, sight, memory, r vr ry avenue  
of sensat ion is closed, andnthumy, debility,  
and malaise left in their places, when the  
friends of our youth are all g me, nnd a  
generation is rim n around us whom we  
know not, is death an evil?  
When one by one our ties are torn.  
And friend fiom friend is snatch&#x27;d forlorn;  
When man is left alone to mourn,  
Oh, then, how sweet it i-i to die!  
When trembling limb* refuse their weight;  
And films slow gathering dim the sight&#x27;,  
When clouds olmeure the, mental light!  
&#x27;lbs nature&#x27;s kindest boon to diet  
• .. ...  
  
I really think ao. [ have ever dreaded  
a doting old ngr, And tny health has i»e*n  
general y ao good, and D now ao good,  
that I dread it atlll. The rapid decline  
of my strength during the laat winter has  
made me hope aomelimea that I see .land.  
During summer, 1 enj &gt;y it a temperature,  
but I shudder nt the approach of winter,  
and wish I could sleep through it with the  
dormouse, and only wake with him In  
spring, if ever.—They say Htarke cold I  
walk alweit hin room. I am told you walk  
well and firmly. I can only reach my gar­  
den, and that with sensible fatigue. I tide,  
however, daily; hut reading is my d-llgh».  
I should wish never to put pen to paper;  
and the more brenure of tbo treacherous  
practice some people hare of publishing  
&#x27;&#x27;lVa letters without leave. I/ord Mans  
held declared it a breach of trust, and pun  
iahable at law. I think it should tie a  
  
penitentiary lulony; yet you will have  
seen tlmt they lmve drawn me out Into&#x27;the  
arena ot the newspaper*. Although 1  
know it is too late for me to buckle on  
the armour of youth, yet my indignation  
would not iH&#x27;rmit me pa sively to receive  
the kick ot ntt ass.  
T» tura to the new* of the day. it seems  
that tiie cannibal* of Kuropo hii* going to  
eating out another again. A war lx*tween  
Uustda ntnl Turkey is like the battle of  
the kite and snake: whichever destroys  
the Other, leaves a destroy Cl h KS t &gt;r the  
world This pugnacious humour ot man­  
kind seems to lie t ho law of his nature,  
one of the obstacles to loo great multipli­  
cation provided in the mechanism ot the  
l nlvorse. The cocks of the hell-yard  
kill one another; heart, bulla,, rams, do  
the same, aud horse, in his wiki .tale, kills  
all the young males, until worn down  
will; age and war, some vigorous youth  
kills him.♦•••*! hope wo shall prove how  
much happier tor man the Quaker policy  
is, and that thu life of the feeder is better  
Iran that of the fighter; and it is some  
consolation that the desolation by these  
maniacs of one pait of tho earth, is the  
means ot improving it in other parts.  
Let the latter bo our olllccr and let us  
milk the cow, wlnlo the Knssiau holds  
her by tho horns and the Tuik by the  
tail.- God bless you ami give you health,  
strength, good spirits, and as much of life  
ii9 you think worth having
