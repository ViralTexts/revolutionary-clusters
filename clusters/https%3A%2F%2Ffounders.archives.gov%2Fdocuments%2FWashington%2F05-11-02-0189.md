Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives.  
It is some abatement of the satisfaction, with which I meet you on the present occasion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the National prosperity generally, I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities, which have, for some time past, distressed our North Western frontier, have terminated.  
You will, I am persuaded, learn with no less concern than I communicate it, that reiterated endeavours, towards effecting  
  
a pacification, have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the Frontier—to stop the further effusion of blood—to arrest the progress of expense—to forward the prevalent wish of the Nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, through various channels, to accomplish these desireable purposes: In making which efforts, I consulted less my own anticipations of the event, or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the object attainable; or if not attainable to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case.  
A detail of the measures which have been pursued, and of their consequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of success, thus far, will, I trust, evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised, have been employed. The issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; but a favourable one, though not to be despaired of, is not promised by anything that has yet happened.  
In the course of the attempts which have been made, some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among Savages, has been found, in this instance, insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace. It will, I presume, be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.  
It must add to your concern, to be informed, that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the Tribes North of the Ohio, some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.  
A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the Tenessee River, have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.  
It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chiccamagas, aided by some Banditti of another tribe, in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton, and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be  
  
laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly enjoined, and observed.  
It is not understood that any breach of treaty, or aggression whatso[e]ver, on the part of the United States, or their Citizens, is even alledged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.  
I have reason to beleive that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised, have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline, and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement, from the proper department, with regard to the number of troops raised, and some other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise information, as a guide to the legislative consultations; and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be adviseable.  
In looking forward to the future expence of the operations, which may be found inevitable, I derive consolation from the information, I receive, that the product of the Revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the Community, for the service of the ensuing year. This, however, will be better ascertained in the course of the Session; and it is proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostility.  
I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian Affairs, without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory. To enable, by competent rewards, the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be divised for promoting civilization among the  
  
friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them, upon a scale equal to their wants, and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion, it’s influence in cementing their interests with our’s could not but be considerable.  
The prosperous state of our Revenue has been intimated. This would be still more the case, were it not for the impediments, which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened, and are lessening in local extent; and as applied to the community at large, the contentment with the law appears to be progressive.  
But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged a special interposition on my part, proper and adviseable, and, under this impression, have issued a proclamation, warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings, having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question, and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.  
Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of Offenders: And Congress may be assured, that nothing within constitutional and legal limits, which may depend on me, shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I shall count intirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the Government, and upon the zealous support of all good Citizens.  
I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a Revision of the Judiciary System. A representation from the Judges of the Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out some of the inconveniencies that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws, considerations arise out of the structure of that system, which, in some cases, tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject, provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the Courts of the United States, and a supplementary definition of Offences against the Constitution and laws of the Union, and of the punishment for such Offences, will, it is presumed, be found worthy of particular attention.  
Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however, by timely provisions, to  
  
guard against those Acts of our own Citizens, which might tend to disturb it, and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration the means of preventing those aggressions by our Citizens on the territory of other Nations, and other infractions of the law of Nations, which, furnishing just subject of complaint, might endanger our peace with them. And, in general, the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes place, if not renewed, at the close of the present Session.  
In execution of the authority given by the Legislature, measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our Mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings, and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half-dismes; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.  
The regulation of foreign Coins, in correspondency with the principles of our national Coinage, as being essential to their due operation, and to order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be resumed and completed.  
It is represented that some provisions in the law, which establishes the Post-Office, operate, in experiment, against the transmission of News-papers to distant parts of the Country. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy.  
The adoption of a Constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the Nation, to which it relates, and conducive to the general order.  
It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the subject, and in further execution of the Acts severally making provision for the public debt, and for the reduction thereof, three new loans have been effected, each for three  
  
millions of florins—One at Antwerp, at the annual interest of four and one half per Cent, with an allowance of four per Cent in lieu of all charges, and the other two at Amsterdam, at the annual interest of four per Cent, with an allowance of five and one half per Cent in one case, and of five per Cent in the other, in lieu of all charges. The rates of these loans, and the circumstances under which they have been made, are confirmations of the high state of our Credit abroad.  
Among the Objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied, the payment of the debts due to certain foreign Officers, according to the provision made during the last Session, has been embraced.  
  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
  
I entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt, according to the right which has been reserved to the Government. No measure can be more desireable, whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to the general sentiment and wish of the Nation.  
Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the eleventh section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular, it is expected a valuable saving will be made.  
Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year, and for such extraordinaries as may require provision, will demand, and I doubt not, will engage your early attention.  
  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives.  
  
I content myself with recalling your attention, generally, to such objects, not particularized in my present, as have been suggested in my former communications to you.  
Various temporary laws will expire during the present Session. Among these, that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian Tribes, will merit particular notice.  
The results of your common deliberations hitherto, will, I trust, be productive of solid and durable advantages to our Constituents; such as, by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage, will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment to  
  
that Constitution of Government, upon which, under Divine Providence, materially depend their Union, their safety and their happiness.  
Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends, there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful cultivation of harmony, combined with a due regard to stability in the public Councils.

Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
T is fome abatement of the fatisfadtion  
with which I meet you on the prefent  
occafion, that in felicitating you on a con-  
tinuance of the national profperity, gene-  
rally, 1 am not able to add to it informa-  
tion that the Indian hoftilities which have  
for fome time paft diftreffed our north  
weftern frontier, have terminated.  
  
You will, 1 am perfuaded, learn with no  
tefs concern than I communicate it, that  
eiterated endeavours towards effe@ting a  
pacification, have hitherto iffued only in  
new and outrageous proofs of perfevering  
hoftility on the part of the tribes with  
whom we are in conteft. An earneft defire  
to procure tranquility to the frontier—-to  
ftop the further effufion of blood—-to arreft  
the progrefs of expence--to forward the  
  
alent with of the nation, for peace,  
as led to ftrenuous efforts, thro” various  
channels, to accomplifh thefe defirabie  
urpofes: in making which efforts, I  
confulted lefs my own anticipations of the  
event, or the fcruples which fome confi-  
éerations were calculated to infpire, than  
the with to find the obje@ attainable ; or  
if not attainable, to afcertain, unequivo-  
cally, that fuch is the cafe.  
  
A detail of the meafures which have  
been purfued, and of their confequences,  
which will be laid before you, while it will  
confirm to you the want of fuccefs thus  
far, will, 1 truft, evince that means, as  
proper and as efficacious as could have  
been devifed, have been employed. The  
  
iffue of fome of them, mdeed, is fill de-  
pending ; but 2 favourable one, tho’ not  
to be defpaired of, is not promifed by any  
thing that has yet happened.  
  
In the courfe of the attempts which  
have been made, fome valuable citizens  
  
  
  
have fallen vitims to their zeal for the  
public fervice. A Yan&amp;tion commonly re-  
fpe&amp;ed, even among favages, has been  
found, in this inftance, infufficient to pro-  
tect from maffacre, the emiffaries of peace;  
it will, I prefume, be duly confidered,  
whether the occafion does not call for an  
exércife of liberality towards the families  
of the deceafed.  
  
it muft add to your concern to be in-  
formed, that befides the continuation of  
hoftile appearances the tribes north  
of the Ohio, fome threatening fymptoms  
have of late been revived among fome of  
thofe fouth of ir.  
  
A part of the Cherokees, known by the  
name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five  
villages on the Teneffe river, have long  
  
_ been in the pra@ice of committing depre-  
  
dations on the neighbouring fettiements.  
  
It was hoped that the treaty of Holfton,  
made with the Cherokee nation, in July,  
1791, would have prevented a repetition  
of fuch depredations. But the event has  
not anfwered this hope. The Chickama-  
gas, aided by fome banditti of another tribe  
in their vicinity, have receatly perpetrated  
wanton and un oked hoftilities upon  
the citizens of the Unjted States in that  
quarter. The information which has been  
received on this fubje&amp; will be laid before  
youe Hitherto defenfive precaytions only  
have been ftri&amp;tly enjoined and obferved.  
  
It is not underftvod that any breach of  
treaty, or sggreffion whatfoever, on the  
part of the United States, or their citizens,  
is even alledged as a pretext for the ipirit  
of hoftilicy in this quarter.  
  
I have reafon to believe, that every  
praGticable exsertion has been made (pur-  
fuant to the proviGicn by law for that pur-  
pofe}  
  
  
  
  
  
  
70O  
pofe) to be prepared for the alternative of  
a profecution of the war, in the event of a  
failure of pacificovertures. A large proe  
  
rtion of the troops authorifed to be raifed  
Scales recruited, tho’ the number is ftill  
incomplete; and pains have been taken to  
¢ifcipline, and put them in condition for  
the particular kind of fervice to be pere  
formed. A delay of operations (befides  
being diftated by the meafures which were  
purfaing towards a pacific termination of  
the war) has been in itfelf deemed prefer-  
able to immature efforts. A ftatement,  
from the proper department, with regard  
to the number of troops railed, and fome  
other points which have been fuggefted,  
will afford more precife information, asa  
guide to the legiflative confultations ; and  
among other things will enable Congrefs to  
judge whether fome additional fimules to  
the recruiting fervice may not be advife-  
able.  
  
In looking forward to the future expence  
of the operations, which may be found  
inevitable, I derive confolation from the  
information I receive, that the produdt of  
the revenues for the prefent year is likely  
to fupercede the neceffity of additional  
burthens on the community, for the fervice  
of the enfuing year. ‘This, however, will  
  
be better afcertained in the courfe of the  
feffion: and it is proper to add, that the  
information alluded to proceeds from the  
  
fuppofition of no material extenfion of the  
fpirit of hoftility.  
  
T cannot difmifs thé fubje@ of Indian  
affairs, without again recommending to  
your confidgration the expediency of more  
adequate provifion for giving energy to the  
Jaws throughout our interior frontier, and  
for reftraining the commifiion of dutrages  
upon the Indians, without which all paci-  
fic plans muft prove nugatory. Toenabie,  
by competent rewerds, the employment of  
gualified and trufty per{ohs to refide among  
therm as agenis, would alfo contribute to  
the prefervation of peace and good neigh-  
bourhood.  
  
Ir, in addition to thefe expedients, an  
eligible plan could be devifed for promoting  
civilization among the friendly tribes, and  
for carryirg on trade with them, upon a  
i.ale equal to their want, and under ree  
gulations calculated to proteét them from  
impofition ard cxtortion, its influence in  
cementing their interefls with our’s could  
not bur be confiderable.  
  
The profperous ftate of our revenue has  
been intimated. This would be ftiil more  
the cafe, were it not fur the impediments  
vhichin fome places continue to embar-  
tafe che colledtien of the cuties on ip:  
  
it a CS  
‘  
  
?  
  
The Prefident’s Speech.  
  
diftilled within the United States. Thefe  
impediments have leffened, and are leffcn-  
ing in local extent; and as applied to the  
community at large, the contentment with  
the law appears to be progreflive.  
  
But fymptoms of an increafed oppofition  
having Jately manifefted themfelves in  
certain quartets, I judged a fpecial inter-  
pofition on my part proper and advifeable ;  
and under this impreffion have iffued a  
proclamation, warning againft all unlaw-  
ful combinations and proceedings, having  
for their objeét or tending to obitruét the  
operation of the law in queftion; and an-  
nouncing, that all lawful ways and means  
would be ftrictiy put im execution for  
bringing to juftice the infractors thereof,  
and fecuring obedience thereto.  
  
Meafures have alfo been taken for the  
profecution of offenders: and Congrefs  
may be affured, that nothing within con-  
ftitutional and legal limits, which may  
depend on me, fhall be wanting to affert  
and maintain the juft authority of the  
laws. In fulfilling this truft, I thall count  
entirely upon the fu&#x27;l co-operation of the  
other departments of the government, and  
upon zhe zealous fupport of all good citi-  
zens.  
  
I cannct forbear to bring again into the  
view of the legiflature, the fubje&amp; of a  
revifion of the judiciary fyftem. A repre-  
fentation from the judges of the fupreme  
court, which will be laid before you, points  
out fome of the inconveniencies that are  
experienced, In the courfe of the execu-  
tion of the laws, confiderations arife out  
of the ftructure of that fyftem, which, in  
fome cafes, tend to relax their efficacy.  
As conneed with this fubje&amp;, provifions -  
to facilitate the taking of bail upon pro-  
cefles out of the ceurts of the United  
States, and a fupplementary definition of  
offences againft the conftitaiion and laws  
of the union, and of the punifhment for  
fuch offences, will, it is prefumed, be  
found worthy of particular attention.  
  
Obfervatiuns upon the value of peace  
with other nations are unneceffary. It  
would be wife, however, by timely provi-  
fions, to guard againft thofe a&amp;s of our  
own citizens which might tend to difturd  
it, and to put ourfelves in a condition to  
give that fatisfa€tion to foreign nations,  
which we may fometimes have occafion to  
require from them. I particularly recom-  
mend to your confideration the means of  
preventing thofe aggreffions by our citizens  
on the territory of other nations, and other  
infra@tions of the law of nations, which,  
furnifhing juit fubje&amp; of complaint, might  
endanger ous peace withthem: and, ig  
  
general,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
neral, the maintenance of a friendly  
intercourfe with foreign powers wil) be  
prefented to your attention by the expira-  
tion of the law for that purpofe, which  
takes place, if mot renewed, at the clofe  
of the prefent feffion. &#x27;  
  
In execution of the authority given  
by the legiflature, meafures have beea ta-  
ken for engaging fome artifts from abroad  
to aid in the eftablifhment of our mint;  
others have been employed at home. Pro-  
wifion has been made of the requifite build-  
ings, and thefe are now putting into proper  
  
condition for the ouaneiea of the eftablift.-  
  
ment. There has alfo been a {mall be-  
ginning in the coinage of half-difmes;  
the want of fmail coins in circulation cal-  
ling the firft attention to thom.  
  
The regulation of foreign coins, in cor-  
refpondency with the principles of our  
national coinage, as being effential to  
their due operation, and to order in our  
money-concerns, will, I doubt not, be  
syefumed and completed.  
  
lt is reprefented that fome proyifions in  
the law which eftablithes the poft-office,  
operate, in experiment, againft the tran/-  
miffion of newipapers to diftaat parts of  
the country.  
  
Should this, upon due inquiry, be found  
to be the fa¢t,.a tull convition of the im-  
portance of facilitating the circulation of  
polincal intelligence and infor matioa,will,  
  
doubt not, lead to the application of a  
remedy.  
  
‘Lhe adoption of a conftitution for the  
fiate of Kentucky has been notified to me.  
‘The legiflature will fhare with me in the  
  
atisfabtion which arifes from an event

the mation, to which it relates, and con-  
ducive to the general order,  
  
It ie proper likewife to inform you,  
that fice my lait communication on the  
fubje€t, and in further execution of the  
a&amp;ts feverally making provifion for the  
public debt, and for theredu@ion thereof,  
three new loans have been effeGted, each  
for three millions of florins; one at Aat-  
werp, at the annual intereftt of four and  
one half per cent. with an allowance of  
four per cent. in lieu of all charges, and  
the other two at Amiterdam, :t the an-  
nual intereft of four per cent. with an al-

they have been made, are confirmations of  
the high ftate of our credit abroad. A-

70%  
ment of the debts dee to certain foreign

during the lait feflion, has been embraced.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houje of Repre-  
fentatives, ’  
  
I entertain a {trong hope that the ftate  
of the national finances is now fufficiently  
matured to enable you to enter upon a fyf-  
tematic and effe€tual arrangement for the  
resular redemption and difcharge of the  
public debt, according to the right which  
has been referved to the government. No  
meafure‘can be more defirable, whether  
viewed with an eye to its intrinfic impor-  
tance, or to the general fentiment and  
with of the nation. Provifion is likewife  
requifite for the reimburfement of the  
loan which has been made of the Bank  
of the United States, purfuant to the ele-  
venth fection of the a&amp; by which it is in-  
corporated. In fulfilling the public ftipu-  
lations in this particular it is expected a  
valuable faving will be made.  
  
Appropriations for the current férvice  
of the enfuing year, and for fuch extra.  
ordinaries as may require provifion, will  
demand, and I doubt nut, will engage  
your early attention.  
  
Geatlemen of the Senate and of the  
Houfe of Representatives,  
  
tT cortent myfelf with recalling your at-  
tention generally to fuch obje&amp;s, not par-  
ticularized in my prefent, as have been  
faggefted in my former communications  
to you.  
  
Various temporary laws will expire dur-  
ing the prefenc feflion. Among thefe,  
that which regulates trade and intercourfe  
with the indian tribes, will meric particu-  
lar notice.  
  
The refults of your common delibera-  
tions hitherto will, I truft, be produ@tive  
of folid and durable advantages to our  
conftituents; fuch as, by conciliating  
more and morc their ultimate fufirage,  
will tend to ftrengthen and confirm their  
attachment to that conftitution of govern-  
ment, upon which, under Divine Provi-  
dence, materially depend their union, their  
fafety, and cheir happinels.  
  
Still further to promote and fecure thefe  
ineftimable ends, there is nothing which  
can have a more powerful tendency thaa  
the careful cultivation of harmony, com-  
bined with a due regard to fability in the  
  
public ceuncils. .

Fllow-Citizens of the Senate, and of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
T is fome abatement of the fatisfaion, with which I meet you on the prefent occa-  
  
fion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national profperity, generally,  
iam not able to add to it information that the Indian hoftilities, which have, for fome  
cime pat, diftreffed our north-weftern frontier, have terminated.  
  
You will, f am perfuaded, learn, with no lefs concern than I communicate it, that  
reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have hitherto iffued only in  
new and outrageous proofs of perfeveriug hottility on the part of the tribes with whom  
we are in contefia Ancarneft defire to procure tranquility to the frontier—to top  
the furthereffufion of blood---to arreft the progrefs of expenfe---to forward the preva-  
lent with of the nation, for peace, has led to ftrenuous efforts, through various char-  
nels, to accomplifh thefe defirable purpofes :---In making which efforts, I confult lefs  
my own anticipations of the event, or the fcrup&#x27;es which fome confideratios were cal-  
culated to infpire, than the with to find the ebjce@ atramable; or if not attainable, to  
afeertain, unequivocally, that fuch is the cafe.  
  
A detail of the meafures which have been purfued, and of their confequences, which  
will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of fuccefs, thus far, will,  
I truft, evince that means, as proper and as efficacious as could have been deviled, have  
been employed. The iffue of ‘ome of them, indeed, is fill depending; but a favour-  
able one, though noi to be defpaired of, isnot promifed by any thing that has yet hap-  
pened.  
  
In the courfe of the attempts which have been made, fome valuable citizens have  
fatten victims to their zeal for the public fervice.---A fan@ion comma) refpcfted,  
even among fgvages, has »een found, in this inflance, infufficient to préte from maf  
facre, the emiliaries of peace ; it will, 1 prefume, be duly confidered, whether the oc-  
caiion does wot call for an exercife of liberality towards the families of the deceafed.  
  
It maf add to yeur concern, to be informed, that befides the continuation of hoftiie  
appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, fome threatening fymptoms have of  
late been revived among fome of thofe fouth of it.  
  
A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of C! magas, inhabiting five villa-  
geson the Teneflee river, have long been in the praGice of committing depredations  
on the nei¢hbouring fettlements.  
  
It was hoped thet the treaty of Holfton, made with the Cherokee nation, ia July,  
8791, would have prevented a repetition of {uch depredations. But the event has nos  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
248 Speech of the Prefident, &amp;Sc.  
  
anf{wered this hope. The Chickamagas, aided by fome banditti of another tribe ip  
their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton aed unprovoked hoftilities upon the  
citizens of the wuited ftates in that quarter. ‘lhe information which has been regeiy.  
ed on this fubje@ wili be laid before you Hitherto defenfive precautions, only  
have been flrictiy enjoined and obferved. ; -  
  
It is not underfood that any breach of treaty, or aggreflion whatfoever, on the pan  
of the united fates, or their citizens, is even alleged, asa pretext for the fpirit of  
hoftility in this quarrel.  
  
I have reafon to believe, that every praticable exertion has been made (purfuane to  
the provifion by law for that purpofe) to be prepared for the alternative of a profecy.  
tion of the war, in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of  
the troops authorized to be raifed, have been recruited, though the number is flilfin.  
complete. And pains have been taken to difeipline, and put them in condition for  
the particular kind of fervice to be performed. A delay of operations (befides bein  
di@ated by the meafures which were puriuing towards a p2cific termination of th.  
war) has been in itfelf deemed preferable to immature efforts. A ftatemient, from the  
proper department, with regare to the number of troops raifed, and fome other points  
which have been fuggefted, will afford more precife information, asa guide to the k.  
giflative covfultations, and, among other things will enable congrefs to judge whe.  
ther fome additional ftimulus to the recruiting fervice may not be advifeable  
  
In looking forward to the future expenfe of the operations, which may be found  
inevitable, I derive confolation from the information I receive, that the produ of the  
revenues for the prefent year, is likely to fuperfede the neceflity of additional bur.  
  
thens on the community, for the fervice of the enfuing year. ‘This, however, willbe  
  
better afcertained in the courfe of the icfllon ; and it is proper to add, that the infor.  
mation alluded to proceeds from the fuppefition of no material extenfion of the Spirit  
of hoftilities.  
  
I cannot difmifs the fubjet of Indian afairs, without sagan recommending to your  
confideration the expediency of more adequate provilion for giving energy to the laws  
throughout our interior frontier ; and for reflraining the commiflion of outrages Upon  
  
the Inciaus ; without which all pacific plans mutt prove nugatory.—lo enable, by  
competent rewards, the employment of qualified and trulty perfons to refide amongt  
them, as agents, would alfo contribute to the prefer vation of peece and good neigh  
bouthood. If in addition to thefe expediénts, an eligible plan could be deviled {a  
promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, and fer carrying qptrade with them  
upon a fcale equal to their wants, and under regulations ¢ alculated to protect them from  
impofition and extortion, its influence in cementing their interedts with ours could om  
but be confidcrable.  
  
The profperous Rate of our revenue has heen intimated—This would be fill mon  
the cafe, @ sc it not for the impediments which in fove places continue to embarrah  
the collection of the duties on fpirits difiilled within&#x27;the united flates, Thefe impe  
diments have le flened, and are leflening in local extent, and asapplied to the comm  
nity at large, the contentment with the law appears to be proyrellive.  
  
But fymptoms of increaled oppotition having lately maniletled themfelves in cer  
tain quarters, | judged fpecial interpofition on my part, proper aud advifeable, and  
ander this impreilion, have iffued a procinmation, warning ageiilt all unlawfol comb  
nationsand proceedings, having for their object, or tending to obfruét the operatic  
of the-law in queltion, and aunouneing that all lawsal ways and means wowld bi  
ftriGly put in execution, for bringing to juilice the infractors thercef and fecuring ob--  
dience thereto.  
  
Meafures have alfo been taken for the profecution of offenders. And congrefs ma  
be allured, that nothing within conflicutional and legal limits, which may depend «  
me, ihall be wanting to affert and maintain the juft auchority of the laws.—in full  
Jing this truit, | fhall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other depart:  
ments of the government, and upon the zealous fupport of all good citizens.  
  
J} cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legiflature the fubje@ of are  
vifion of the judiciary fyitem. A reprefentation from the judges of the fupreme  
court, which will be laid before you, points out fome of the inconveniencies that at  
experienced. Inthe courfe of the «xe.ution ef the laws, confiderations rife ovt of th  
ftrudiure of that fyftem, which tend, in fonie cafes, to relax their eflicacy. As conned

courts of the united ftates, and a fupplementary definition of offences agzainf the con-  
ftitution and laws of the union, and of the punishment for fuch oflcuces, will, it is pre-  
famed, be found worthy of particular attention.  
  
Obfervations on the value of peace with other nations are unneceflary. It would  
be wife, however, by timely provifions, to guard agajnft thofe acts wf our ewn Citi-  
zens, which might tend to ditturb it, and to put ourlelves in a coudition to give that  
fatisfaction to foreign nations, which we may fometime have occalion to require from  
them. I particularly recommend to your confideration the means of preventing thofe  
aggreflions by our citizens on the territory of other nations, and other »nfractions of  
the law of nations, which, furnifhing juit fubject of complaint, might endanger our  
peace with them. And, in general, the maintenance of a friendly mtercourie with  
foreign powers will be prefented to your attention by the expiration of the Jaw  
fur that pucpofe, which takes place, if not renewed, at the clofe of the pre‘ent {effion.  
  
In execution of the authority given by the legiflature, mealures have been taken  
for engaging fome artitts from abroad ro aid in the eftablifhiment of our mint: others  
have been employed at home. Provifion has becn made of the requifite buildings,  
and thefe are now potting into proper condition for the purpoles of the eltablifhment.  
There has alfo been a {mall beginning in the coinage ef half-diimes; the want of  
{mail coins in circulation calling the firft attention to them  
  
The regalation of forcign coins, in correfpondency with the principles ef our na-  
tiona! coinage, as being effential to their due operation, and to order in our money  
concerns, will, Edoubt not, be refumed and compicted.  
  
leis reprefented that fome provifions in the law which eftablifhes the poft-office ope-  
rate, in experiment, againit the tranfmiflion of newfpapers to diltsut parts of the

of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intesumgence and infer-  
mation, wil!, | doubt nat, lead to the applicaticn of a remedy  
  
The adoption of a conftitution for the ilate of Kentuckey has been notified to me.

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and of the  
House if Representatives.  
IT is Come abatement of the fatisfaftion,  
with which I meet you ontheprefent occa­  
fioii, that, in felicitating you on a continu­  
ance of the national prosperity, generally,  
I am not able to add to it information that  
the Indian hoflilities, which have for some  
time palt distressed our north-western fron­  
tier, have terminated.  
You will, I am persuaded, learn with no  
less concern than 1 communicate it, that  
reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a  
pacificarion, have hitherto iifued in new and  
outrageous proofs of persevering hostility  
on the part of the tribes with whom we are  
in contest. An earnefl desire to procure  
tranquility to the frontier; to flop the fur­  
ther effufion of blood 5 to arrelt the pro­  
gress of expense ; to forward the prevalent  
vviiii o the nation, for peace, has led to  
strenuous efforts, through various channels,  
to accomplish these desirable purposes : In  
making which efforts, I confultcd less my  
own anticipations of the event, or thefcru- ;  
pk ;, which some confideratious were cal- !  
ciliated to inspire, than the wish to find the  
object atia liable ; or if not attainable, to :  
ascertain unequivocally that such is the  
cafe.  
A derail of tiie measures, that have been .  
pursued, and of their consequences, which  
will be la,d before you, while it will con- i  
firm to you the want of success, thus far, &#x27;  
Will, I ti uft, evince that means as proper  
and as efficacious as could have been devi- !  
fed, have been employed, The issue of j  
some of them, i ideed, is (till depending ;  
but a favorable one, though not to be des­  
paired of, is not promised by any thing that  
has yet happened.  
In the conrfe of the attempts which have  
been made, some valuable citizens have !  
fallen victims to their zeal for the public i  
service. A fan£tion commonly respected  
even among lavages, has been found, in this  
iuftance, infufficient to protest from maffa­  
ci e the emiflaries of peace. It will, 1 pre­  
sume, be duly considered whether the oc­  
casion does not call for art exercise of libe­  
rality toward; the families of ihedeceafed.  
It irtijft add to your concern, to be in­  
formed, that beiides the continuation of  
hostile appearances among the tribes north  
ot the Olio, lonie threatening lymptoms  
have of late been revived among some of  
those south of it.  
A parr ot the Cher.ikees, known by the  
name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villa­  
ges 011 the Tennefee river, have long been  
ill the praitice of committing depredations  
on the neighbouring fettlemeuts.  
It was hoped that the treaty of Holftbn,  
made with the Cherokee nation in July  
1791, would have prevented a repetition of  
such depredations : but the event has not  
answered this hope. The Chickamagas,  
aided by some banditti of another tribe, in  
their vicinity, have recently perpetrated  
wanton, and unprovoked hostilities upon  
the citizens of the United States in that  
quarter. The information which has been  
received on this subjeCt will be laid before  
you. Hitherto, defensive precautions on­  
ly have been ftriitly enjoined, and obser­  
ved.  
It is not tmderftoad that any breach of  
treaty, or aggreflion whatsoever, on the  
part of the United States, or their citizens,  
is even alledged as a pretext for the spirit  
of hostility in this quarter.  
I have reason to believe that every prac­  
ticable exertion has been made (pursuant  
to the provision by law for that purpose)  
to be prepared for the alternative of a pro­  
secution of the war, in the event of the  
failure of pacific overtures. A large pro­  
portion of the troops authorized to be rai­  
led, have been recruited, though the num­  
ber is still incomplete. And pains have  
been taken to dilcipline and put them in  
condition for the particular kind of ser­  
vice to be performed. A delay of opera­  
tions (belicles being diftaied by the mea­  
sures which were purftiing towards a pa­  
cific termination ot the war) has been in  
itfelf deemed preferable to immature ef­  
forts. A ltatement from the proper depart­  
ment, with regard to the number of troops  
raised, and some other points which have  
been fuggeftetl, will afford more precise in­  
  
formation, as a guide to the legiffititfe crfn­  
full aiiom : aiu! among other tilings will  
enable Congress to judge whether fume ad­  
ditional fliuiulus to the recruiting service  
may not be advifeable.  
In looking forward to the future ex­  
pense of the operations, v. iiich may be  
found inevitable, 1 derive confo&#x27;ation from  
the information, I receive, that the pro­  
duftofthe revenues for the prcfent year  
is likely to supersede the neteflity of addi­  
tional burthens on the community, for the  
service of the eiiluing year. Thi:-, howe­  
ver, will beb.&#x27;tter ascertained i.i the cotirfe  
of the leffion ; and it is proper to add,  
that the information alluded to proceeds  
upon the supposition oi no material exien­  
lion of the spirit of hoftiliry.  
I cannot difmifsthe fubjeef of Indian af­  
fairs without again recommending to your  
consideration the expediency of more ade­  
quate provilion for giving ellergy to the  
laws throughout our interior frontier, and  
tor retraining the comniilfion of outrages  
upon tfce Indians; without which all  
pacific plans mult prove nugaiory. To en­  
able, by competent rewards, the employ­  
ment of qualified and trusty pgrfons to re­  
side among them, as agents, would also  
contribute to the preservation of peace and  
good neighbourhood. If, in addition to  
these expedients, al) eligible plan could be  
devised for promoting civilization among  
the friendly tribes, and for carrying on  
trade with thc-m, upon a scale equal to their  
wants, and under regulations calculated  
to pi oteft them from impofitioU and extor­  
tion, its influence in cementing their inter­  
ells with our&#x27;s could not but be considera­  
ble.  
The prosperous {fate of our revenue has  
Been intimated. This would be fti 11 more  
trie cafe, were it ndt for the impediments,  
which in some place ; continue to embar  
rafs the collection of the duties onfpirif; dis­  
tilled within the United States. These  
impediments have leiTened anil are levell­  
ing in local extent—and as applied to the  
community at large, the contentment with  
the law appears to be progressive.  
But symptoms of increased opposition  
having lately manifefted themselves in cer­  
tain quarters—I judged a special in:erpoli­  
tion on my part, proper and advifeable,  
and, under this impreiiion, have ifiiied a  
proclamation, warning against all unlaw­  
ful combinations and proceedings, having  
for their object or tending to obflrnct&quot; the  
operation of the law ia question, and an­  
nouncing that all lawful ways and means  
would be Urictly put in execution for  
bringing to justice the infractors thereof,  
and securing obedience thereto.  
Measures have also been taken for the  
profecntion of offenders : and Congress  
may be assured, that nothing within conlfi­  
tutional and legal limits, which may de­  
pend on r/.e, fha&#x27;ll be wanting to after: and  
maintain the just author ty of the laws.  
11l fulfilling this trtift, I shall count intire­  
ly upon the full co-operation of the other  
departments of government, and upon the  
zealous support of all good citizens.  
I canuot forbear to bring again into the view  
of the legislature the lubject of a rcvifion of  
| the judiciary fyflem. A representation from  
| ihe judges of the lupreme court, which will be  
| laid before you, points out some of the incon­  
j veniencies that are experienced. —In the course  
j of the execution of the laws, confederations a  
rife out of the flruflure of ihit fyflem, which,  
in some cases, fend 10 relax their efficacy.—As  
( connected with this fubje&lt;3, provifioils to faci­  
litate the taking Of bail, upon piocefifes out of  
the courts of the United States, and a supple­  
mentary definition of offences again!! the con­  
firtuiion and laws of the union, and of tho pu­  
nifhmeßt for f&#x27;uch offences, will, it if presumed  
be found worthy of particular attention.  
Observations on the value of peace with other  
nations arc unueceffary. It would be wife how­  
ever, by timely provisions, to guard againll  
j those atls of our own citizens, which might  
tend to disturb it, and to put ourfelvisin a eon­  
ditiou to give that fatisfa£tion to foreign nations  
which we may sometimes have occasion to re­  
quire from them.—l particularly recommend  
to your consideration the means of preventing  
those aggreflions by our citizens OH t:,e territo­  
ry of other nations, and other infraflions of  
the law of nations, which, luriiifhing just fub­  
jeftof complaint, might endanger our peace  
with them.—And, in general, the maintenance  
of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers  
will be prelentcd to your attention by the ex­  
piration of the law for thai puipofe, which  
lakes place, if not renewed, at the dole of the  
present session.  
In execution of the authority given by the  
egiflature, measures have been taken for engag­  
ing foixe aitifts from abroad to aid in the ifla­  
blilhmentof our mint ; others have been em­  
ployed at home. Provision has been made of  
the retjuilite buildings, and these arc now put-*  
ling into proper condition for the purpo es of  
the eftabhfhment.—There has also been a (mall  
beginning in the roinage ol lulf-dilmes; the  
want of small coins ir&gt; circulation calling the  
firfl attention to them.  
The regulation of foreign coins, in eorref­  
pondency with the principles of our national  
coinage, as being eflential to their due operation,  
and to order in our money-concerns, will, 1  
doubt not, be relumed and completed.  
It is represented that some prcvitions in the  
law, which eflabliflies the poll-office, opsrate,  
in experiment, against the tranfmiflion of newl­  
papen to diliant pans of the country.—Sttould  
  
this, topch c!uc t&#x27;hqfiiry, be fcimd to be the   
a full eonvitiicn ot Ihe importance offacilitating  
the nictitation of political intelligence and in­  
formation, will, 1 doubt not, lead to the appli­  
cation of a remedy.  
1 he adoption of a Coriftituti n for the state  
of Kentucky has beeti notifi.d to me. The  
legislature will (hate with me in the fatisfaflion  
which aiiles from an event intetefling to the  
bappmefsof the part of the nation, to which it  
reljies, and conducive tothe general order.  
It is proper likewise to inform you, that  
since my lafl communication on the fubje£l,and  
in luithei execution ot the a£ts federally mak­  
ing provision for the public debt, and for the re­  
duction thcieot. three new loans have been ef­  
tefted, each for three millions of florins one  
at Antwerp, at the annual interefl of foul&quot; and  
ore half per cent, with an allowance of four  
per cent, ill lieu of all charges—and the other  
two at AmHcrdain, at the annual inteiell of four  
per cent, with an allowance of five and one  
half per ccnt. in one cafe, and ot five per cent,  
in the other, in lieu of all charge .—&quot;1 he rates  
of thele loans, and the circumtlances, under  
which they have betn made, are confirmations  
ot the high Date of our Credit abroad.  
Among th£ objefls to which thefefundi have  
been diretted to be applied, the payment of the  
d.btsdue to certain foreign officers, according  
tothe provision made duiing the last feffiofi, has  
been embraced.  
Gentlemen cf the Hcvje of Representatives.  
i entertain a strong hope that the (late of the  
l national finances is now lufficiently matured to  
enable you to enter upon a fytlematic aud effec­  
tual arrangement for the regular redemp­  
tion and discharge Of the public debt, ac­  
cording to the right which has been re­  
served to the government. No meaftirfe  
can be more desirable, whether viewed  
with an eye to its intrinlic importance, of  
to the general sentiment and \\ ilh of the  
nation.  
Provilioil is likewise requisite for the  
reimburfeinent of the loan which has been  
made of the bank of the United States,  
purlttant to the eleventh section of the ast  
by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling  
the public stipulations in this particular,  
it is expefled a valuable favina will be  
made.  
Appropriations for the current service  
of the ensuing year, and for such extra­  
ordinaries as may require provision, will  
demand, and, I doubt not, will engage  
your early attention;  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of tht  
Houje oj Retnefentatives.  
I content inyfelf with recalling your at­  
tention, generally, to such objects, not  
particularized in my present, as have been  
fugget&#x27;ted in iny former communications  
to yoa.  
Various temporary laws will expire du­  
ring the prefe.it feflion. Among theie,  
that which regulates trade and incerccurfe  
with the Indian tribes, will merit particu­  
lar notice.  
The results of your common deliberati­  
ons hitherto, will, I trulr, be productive of  
solid and durable advantages to our consti­  
tuents : such as, by conciliating more and  
more their ultimate fuffrage, will tend to  
ftreilgthen and confirm the:i attachment to  
that conflitution of government, upon  
which, under Divine Providence, material­  
ly depend their Union, their fafety, arid  
their happiness.  
Stili further to promote and secure tbefe  
iheltimable ends, therj is nothing which  
«gn have a more powerful tendency, than  
the cultivation of harmony, combined with  
a due regard to liability, in the public coun­  
cils.

fT il-Jfeaw «f the n,  
with which I meet you on the present occasion,  
thatiu felicitating you on a continuance of the  
Batjenal prosperity, generally, I am not able to  
add to it information that tlie Indian hostilities,  
which have, for some time pall, diftrefl&#x27;ed our  
jorch-weftern frontier, have terminated.  
■ Yon wilJ, I am persuaded, learn with no Icl?  
(oncern than I communicate it,- that reiterated  
endeavours, toward? effe&amp;ing a pacification,  
have hitherto illued only in new and outrageous  
proofs of perlevering hoftilityon the part of the  
tribes with whom we are in contest. An ear­  
ned d»fire to procure tranquility to the fron­  
tier—to flop the further efrufion of blood—to  
arrest the progress of expense—to forward the  
prevalent wi(h of the nation, for peace, has led  
to ftremjous efforts, through various channels,  
to accomplilh these defirablc purposes : in  
making which efforts, I consulted lei&#x27;s my own  
anticipations of the event, or the fcrupies whiuh  
&amp;me confederations were calculated to inspire,  
than the wish to find the o-bjeft attainable; or  
if not attainable, to ascertain uncauivocally  
that l&#x27;«ch is the- cafe.  
&#x27; A detart-ofthe rileafures which bare been ptir­  
fued, and of their conlequences, which will be  
aid before you, while it will confirm to you the  
fant of success, thus far, wiH, X trull, evince  
-hat means as pro&#x27;per and as efficacious as could  
iave been devife&#x27;d,have been employed.—The if  
Cue of some of them,indeed,is Hill depending; but  
a favorable one,though not to be despaired of,is  
notprojnifed by any thing that has yet hap­  
pened.  
In the course of the attempts which have been  
*iade, some valuable citizcns have (alien vifiims  
to their zeal For the public service.—A fanthon  
commonly refpe£Ud even among savages, has been  
found, in this inftan&#x27;ce, inefficient to prote£t from  
maflacre the emissaries of peace :— It will, I ple_  
fume, be duly considered whether the occasion  
does not call for an exercise of liberality towards  
the families ol tile deceased.  
  
It nvjft add to your concern, to be informed,  
that besides the continuation of boftile appearan­  
ces among the tribes north of (he Ohio,fame threat­  
mng symptoms have of late been, revived among  
iome of those south of it.  
  
A part of tb&lt;■ Cl&#x27;&quot; roJcV&amp;ir know Hy »Vj» &lt;-»t.  
of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the  
r&lt;iiineffec river, have long he&#x27;cu in the   
♦ommitting depredations on the neighbouring fet­  
ilements.  
  
It was hoped that the treaty of H-.lfton made  
with the Cherokee nation in July, 1791, w&lt; uld  
liave prevented a repetition of depredations.  
— But the event has not answered this hope.—  
The Chickamagas, aided by some banditti oi ano­  
ther tribe, in their vicinity, have recently per­  
pctrat. d wanton, and unprovoked hostilities upon  
the citizens of the United States in that quauer.  
The inlormation which has been received on this  
hibjeft will be laid before you.— Hitherto defen­  
sive precautions only have been Aricily enjoined,  
and observed.  
  
It is nor understood that any breach of treaty.  
or 3Kgreflion whatfocver, on the part of the Uni­  
t&#x27; d States, or tht »i ns, is even allcdged as a  
pretext tor the Ipirtt of hoftiluy in this quarter.  
1 have reason to believe that every pra&amp;icable  
exertion has been made (puifuant to the provision  
by low tor that purpofej to be prepared for the al­  
ternative of a profeeution of the war, in the event  
a f*|iure cf pacific overtures. A large propor­  
tion of (he troops authorized to be raised, have  
een recruited, though the number is (till incom-  
Pete ; And paifli&#x27;have been taken to discipline,  
2nd put them in condition for the particular kind  
of lervice to be performed.—A delay of opera­  
t&#x27;Ons (hefides being dictated by the measures  
&#x27;en were pursuing towards a pacific termina­  
tion of the w,&gt;r) has been 111 itfelf deemed prefer­  
a!&#x27;&lt;e to immatuie efforts. A statement, from the  
proper department, with regard to the number of  
troops railed, and some other points which have  
been fuggefied, will afford more precise informa­  
t &quot;on, as a guide to the legislative consultations ;  
2nd among other things will enable Congress lo  
Ju ge vvJitther additional ftimulous to the  
recruiting service may »ot be advifeable.  
In looking forward to the future expense of  
t. e operations, may be found inevitable,  
derive confoiation from the information I re­  
•eive, that the product of the revenues for the  
present year is likely to fupercede the receflity  
• additional tmrtliens on the community, for  
*1C lery:ce of the ensuing year. This, howe-  
*1 &#x27; *11 be better ascertained in the course of  
on ;—-iind it is proper to add, that the  
nation ailuded to, proceeds upon the fup­  
on of no material extenlion of the spirit of  
&lt; ity.   
/ cannot dismiss the fuhjedl of Indian affairs,  
v,tnout again recommending to your consider  
ation the expediency of more adequate provi­  
■on lor giving energy to the laws throughout  
°ur interior frontier; and for restraining the  
c°miniiT)onof outrages upon the Indians; with­  
out which, all pacific plans mult prove nugato-  
0 enable by competent rewards, the em-  
P o.Vment of qualified and trusty persons to re­  
-1 c them as agents, would also contri  
ute to the preiervation of peace and goo&lt;  
neighbourhood.  
If in addition to these expedient?, an eligible  
P an could be devised for promoting civilizatioi  
&#x27;&lt;*uions the friendly tribes, aud for carrying oi  
  
- tr.-.ae Wiia then}, upon % foale e«ual to their  
wants, and under regulations calculated to pro I  
teet them from imposition and extortion, it&lt;  
I influence in cementing their intereih with our&quot;  
could not cut be contkferable.  
Tile prosperous Jtatc of our revenue has been  
intimated.— This would be still mere the cafe  
were it not for the impediments which in torn.&#x27;  
places continue to embarrass the collection «t  
the duties on spirits diftiiied within the ■-United  
states.—l&#x27;heie impediments have letfeneri, and  
are lehening in local extent;—and as applied  
to Hue community at large, the contentment  
with the law appears to be progieflive.  
But fymptotns of increased opposition having  
-lately manifefted thenlfelvej in certain quar­  
ters ; 1 judged a t&#x27;pecial inteipofityjn*on my  
part proper and advilable, and under this im­  
.pre.&#x27;lK&gt;n, have iflued a Proclamation, warning  
•againlt all unlawful combiratioiis and proceed&quot;  
mgs, liinng ebjir ul.ject or tiding ti» ob­  
itruft the opet ation of the law in queflion, and  
announcing that all lawful -Ways and r.-.eans  
would be ftriftly put in execution tor bringing  
to justice the infractors thereof and letufinr­  
obedience thereto. &quot;I  
  
Mealures have also been taken for the prose­  
cution of offenders : and Congress may be al­  
lured, that nothing within conftiiutional and  
legal limits, which may depend on me, lhall be  
wanting to aflert and maintain the just autho­  
rity of the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I shall  
count entirely upon the full co-operation of the  
other departments of the government, and upon  
the zealous support of all good citizens. !  
I cannot forbear to bring again into the view\
of the legislature the fubjeft of a revision of the i  
Judiciary system. A representation from the i  
judges of the lupreme court, which will be laid I  
befoie you, points out some of the inconveni­  
euces that are experienced. In the course of  
the execution of the laws, considerations arise  
out of the It nature of that system, which, in  
some cases, tend to relax their cfiicacv. As  
connected with this l&#x27;ubjert, pvnvi£on» to faci-  
Mate tlie taking&quot;us bail upon proVeffes cut of  
the courts of the- United States, and a supple­  
mentary definition of offences against the con­  
stitution and laws of the Union, and of the pu­  
nilliment for luch offences, will, it is presumed,  
be found worthy of particular attention.  
  
Observations on the value of peace with other  
nations, are unnecefTary. It \voa)d be wife,  
however, by timely piovifions, to guard again ft  
those a*fts of our own c itizens, which might tend  
to disturb it, and to put ourselves in a condition  
to give that fat,station to foreign nations,  
which we may Sometimes have occasion to re­  
quire from them.—l particularly recommend  
to your consideration the means of preventing  
tho% aggresSions by our citizens on the territo­  
ry of other nations, and other iufra&amp;ions of the  
law of nations, which, furnishing juit Subject of  
complaint, might endanger our peace with  
them—And, in general, the maintenance of a,  
friendly intercourse with foreign powers, will  
be presented to your attention by the expira­  
tion of the Jaw for that purpoSe, which takes  
place, if not renewed, at the close of the pjeSent  
ieJfion. I  
  
In elocution of the authority given by the  
legiilature, measures have been taken for en­  
gaging some artists from abroad to aid in the es­  
tablishment oi our mint ; othen have been em­  
ployed at home.—Provision has been made of  
the requiiite buildings, and theie are now put­  
ting into proper condition for the purposes of  
the eftablifhment.—Theie has al/o been a small  
beginning in the coinage of half difmes ; the  
want of small coins in circulation calling the  
fit ft attention to them.  
  
The regulation of foreign coins, incorrefpon­  
dency with the principles of our national coin­  
age, as being eilential to their due operation,  
arid to order in our money-concerns, will, I  
doubt not, be resumed and compleated.  
  
It is represented that some provifioris in the  
law, which eftablilhes the Post Office, opej ate,  
in experiment againit the trahfmlllion of news­  
papers to distant parts of the country.  
  
Should tins tipondue enquiry, be found to be  
the fa&lt;st, a full con Vision of the importance of  
facilitating th,e circulation of political intelli­  
gence and information, will, I doubt not, lead  
to the application of a remedy.  
  
The adoption of a constitution for the Hate  
of Kentucky has been notified to me.-—The  
legislature wi&#x27;lfhare with me in the fatisfaftion  
which arises from an event interesting to the  
happiness of the part of the nation, to which it  
relates, and conducive to the general order.  
  
It is pioper likewiie to inform you, that since  
my laijt communication on the fubje£t, and 111 fur­  
ther execution of thea#s feveraliy making pro­  
vision for the public debt, and for the redu£tiou  
thereof, three new loans have been effected, each  
for three millions of florins ; one at Antwerp, at  
the annual intercft of four and one half per cent,  
with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all  
charges, and the other two at Amsterdam, at the  
annual intercft of four per cent, with an allowance  
of five and one half per cent, in one cafe, and of  
five per cer-t in the other, in lieu of all charges.  
The rates of these loans, and the circumllances  
under which they have bern made, are confirma­  
&#x27;tions of the high state of our credit abroad.—  
Among the obje&amp;s to which these funds have been  
directed to be applied, the paymsnt of the debts  
due to certain foreign officers, according to the  
provision made during the last fcfiion, has been  
embraced.  
  
Gentlemen oj the House of Representatives,  
I entertain a iirong hope that the Ifate of the  
national finances is now fuffictcotly n&gt;atured to  
enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual  
arrangement tor the regular redemption and dis­  
charge of the public debt, according to the right  
which has been refeived to the government.—  
No measure can be more dtfirable, whether view­  
ed with an eye to its intrinsic importauce, or to  
he general sentiment and with of the nation.—  
Provision is likewise requisite for the leimburfe  
ment of the loan which has betfn made of the Bank  
&gt;f the United States, pursuant to the eleventh fee­  
ton of the act by which it is incorporated. In  
u!fi&#x27;lingthc public stipulations in this particular

to their zeal for the public fervice. A fmilion,  
commonly refpected even among favages, has  
been found, in this inftanre, infunicicnt to pro­

Fellow citizens of the fenate, and of the boufe of reprefentarives,  
  
T isfome abatement ef the fatisfaction, with which 1 meet you  
  
on the prefent occafion, that in felicitating you on acontinu-  
ance of the national profperity, generaily, [am not able to add to  
it information that the Indian hoftilities, which have, for fome time  
patt, diftrefled our north. weftern frontier, have terminated.  
  
You will, [am perfuaded, learn with no lefs concern than ! commu-  
nicate it, that reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a pacification,  
have hitherto iflued only in new and outrageous proofs of perfever-  
ing hottility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in conteft.  
An earneft defire to procure trariquillity to the frontier—to ftop the  
farther effifion of blood—to arreft the progrefs of expenfe—to for-  
ward the prevalent with of the nation, for peace, has led to ftrenu-  
ous efforts, through verious channels, to accomplith thefe defirable  
purpofes:—in making which efforts, I confulted lefs my ownanti-  
cipations of the event, or the fcruples which fome confiderations  
were calculated to infpire, than the with to find the object attaina-  
ble: or if not attainable, to afcertain unequivocally that fuch is the  
cafe,  
  
A detail of the meafures which have been purfued, and of their  
confequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm  
to yon the want of fuccefS, thus far, will, I truft, evince that  
meaps as proper and as efficacious as could have been devited, have  
becn employed. The-ifliie of fome of them, indeed, is {till depend-  
ing; bura favourable onc, though not to be defpaired of, is not  
promifed by any thing that has yet happened.  
  
In’ the courfe of ‘the attempts which have been made, fome va-  
Inable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public fer-  
vice. A fanction commonly refpected even among favages, has been  
found, in this inftance, infufficient to protect from maflacre the emif-  
faries of peace. It will, I prefume, be duly confidered, whether the  
ocealion does not call for an exercife of liberality towards the fa.  
milies of the deceafed.  
  
ic muft add te your concern, to be informed, that befides the con-  
tinuation of hoftile appeararances among the tribes north of the  
Ohio, fome threatening fymproms have of late been revived among  
fume of thofe fouth of it.  
  
A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas,  
inhabiting five villages on the fenefice river, have long been in the  
practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring fettle-  
ments,  
  
it was hoped that the treaty of Holfton made with the Chero-  
kee nation in July, 1791, would have prevented a repetition of fuch  
depredations. But the event has not anfwered this hope. The  
Chickamagas, aided by fome banditti of another tribe, in their v ci-  
nity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hoftili-  
  
  
  
rte  
  
4a* Speech of the prefident of the united fates. {1 792;  
  
. ties upon the citizens of the united ftates in that quarter. The in-  
formation which las been received on this fubject will be laid be-  
fore you. Hitherto defenfive precautions only have been ftrictly  
enjoined, aud obferved. aS  
  
_ It is not underitood that any breach of treaty, or agereffion what-  
foever, on the part of the united ftates, or their citizens, is even al-  
leged, as a pretext for the fpirit of hoftility in this quarter.  
  
{ have reafon to believe that every practicable exertion has been  
made (purfuant to the previfion by law for that purpofe) to be  
prepared for the alternative of a profecution of the war, in the e-  
vent of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportionof the  
troops authorifed to be raifed, have been recruited, though the  
number is ftill incomplete ; and pains have been taken to difci-  
pline, and put them in condition for the particular kind of fervice  
to be performed. A delay of operations (befides being dictated by  
the meaiures which were purfuing towards a pacific termination of  
the war) has been in itfelf deemed preferable to immature ef-  
forts. A ftatement, from the proper department, with regard to  
the number of troops raifed, and fome other points which have been  
fuggefted, will afford more precife information, as a guide to the  
Jegiilative confultations ; and among other things will enable con.  
gre to judge whether fome additional ftimulus to the recruiting  
fervice may not be advifeable.  
  
_ In looking forward to the future expenfe of the operations,  
which may 4 found inevitable, I derive confolation from the in.  
formation I receive, that the product of the revenues for the pre-  
fent year is likely to fupercede the neceflity of additional burdens  
on the community, for the fervice of the enfuing year. This, how-  
ever, willbe better afcertained in the courfe of the feflion—and  
it is proper to add, that the information alluded to, proceeds up.  
on the fuppofition of no material extenfion of the fpirit of hoftiliry.  
  
I cannot difmifs the fubject of Indian affairs without again re-  
couunending to your confideration the expediency of more ade-  
quate provifion for giving energy tothe laws throughout our in-  
terior frontier: and for reftraining the commiflion of outrages up-  
on the Indians; without which, all pacific plans muft prove nuga-  
tory. To enable by competent rewards, the employment of quali-  
fied and trufty perfonsto refide among them as agents, would alfo  
contribute to the prefervation of peace and good neighbourhood.  
  
If in addition to thefe expedients, an eligible plan could be de-  
vifed for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, and for  
carrying on trade with them, upon a fcale equal to their wants, and  
uuder regulations calculated to protect them from impofition and  
extortion, its influence in cementing their interefts with ours, could  
not but be confiderable.  
  
The profperous ftate of our revenue has been intimated. This  
would be (till more the cafe, were it not for the impediments which  
in fome places continve to embarra{S the collection of the duties on  
AMpirits diftilled within the united ffates. Thefe impediments have  
leffened, and are leilening in local extent; and as applied to the  
community at large, the contentment with the law appears to be  
progreflive.  
  
But fymptoms of increafed oppofition having lately manifefted  
themfelves in certain quarters—t judged a fpecial interpofition on my  
part. proper and advifeable, and under this impreffion, have ifiued a  
  
  
  
Part TI.) Speech of the prefident of the united flates. 43  
  
proclamation, warning againft all unlawful combinations and pro-  
ceedings, having for their object or tending to obftruct the opera=  
tien of the law in jon, and announcing that all lawful ways and  
means would be y put in execution for bringing to juftice the  
infractors thereof, and fecuring obedience thereto.  
  
Meafures have alfo been taken for the profecurion of offenders :  
and compet may be affured, that nothing within couftitutional  
and legal limits, which may depend on me, fhall be wanting to aflert  
and maintain the juft authority of the laws. In fulfilling this truft, I  
fhall count entirely on the full co-operation of the other depart-  
ments of the government, and upon the zealous fupport of all good  
citizens.  
  
Il cannot forbear to bring agaim into the view of the legiflature  
the fabject of a revifion of the judiciary fyftem. A reprefentation  
from the judges of the fupreme court, which will be laid before you,  
points out fome of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the  
courfe of the execution of the laws, confiderations arife out of the  
ftructare of that fyftem, which, in fome cafes, tend to relax their  
eilieacy. As connected with this fubject, provifions to facilitate the  
taking of bail upon procefles out of the courts of the united ftares,  
and a fupplementary definition of offences againft the conftitution  
and laws of the union, and of the punifhment for fuch offences,  
will, it is prefumed, be found worthy of particular attention.  
  
Obfervations on the value of peace with other nations, are unne-  
ceflary. It would be wife, however, by timely provifions, to guard  
againft thofe acts ot our own citizens, which might tend to difturb  
it, and to put ourfelves in a condition to give that fatisfaction to fo-  
reign nations, which we may fometimes have occafion to require  
from them.—I particularly recommend to your confideration the  
means of preventing thofe aggreilions by our citizens on the terri-  
tory of other nations, and other infra¢iions of the law of nations,  
which, fornifhing juft fabject of complaint, might endanger our  
peace with them : and, in general, the maintenance of a friendly  
intercourfe with foreign powers, will be prefented to your attention  
by the expiration of the law for that purpofe, which takes place, if  
not renewed, at the clofe of the prefent feffion.  
  
In execution of the authority given by the Jegiflature, meafures  
have been taken for engaging fome artifts from abroad, to aid in  
the eftablifhment of oar mint: others have been employed at home.  
Provifion has been made of the requifite buikiings ; and thefe are  
now putting into proper condition for the purpoies of the eftablith-  
ment.—There has alfo been a fimall beginning in the coinage of  
half difines ; the want of {mall coins in circulation calling the firft  
attention to them. .  
  
The regulation of foreign coins, in correfpondency with the  
principles of our national coinage, as being eflential to their due  
operation, and to order in our merey-concerns, will, | doubt not,  
be refumed and completed. : ~  
  
It is reprefented, that fume provifions in the law, which eflablith-  
es the poit office, operate, in experiment, againit the tranfiniffion  
  
_ of newfpapers to diitant parts of the country.  
  
Should this, upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact, a full  
conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of poli-  
tical intelligence and information, will, 1 doubt nec, lead to the ap-  
plication of a*remedy,  
  
  
  
a4? Speech of the prefident of the united fiates. [t792.  
  
The adoption of a conftitution for the ftate of Kentucke has been  
notified to me.—The legiflature will fhare with me in the fatisfaction  
which arifes from an event interefting to the anefs of the part  
of the-nation, to which it relates, and condade to the general  
order. :  
  
- It is proper, likewife, to inform youn, that fince my laft commu-  
nication on the fubject, and in further execution of the acts feve-  
rally making provilion for the public debt, and for the reduction  
thereof, three new loans have been effected, cach for three millions  
of florins ; one at Antwerp, at the annual intereft of four and one  
half per cent, with an allowance of four per cent. in leu of all  
charges, and the other two at Amiterdam, at the annual intereft of  
four per cent. with an allowance of five and ‘one half per cent. in  
one cafe, and of five per cent in the other, in lieu of all charges.  
The rates of thefe loans, and the circumttances under which they  
have been made, are confirmations of the high ftate of our credit  
abroad.—Among the objects to which thefe funds have been direct-  
ed to be applied, the payment of the debis due to certain forei  
officers, according to the provifion made during the lait fellion,  
has been cuntricdll  
  
Gentlemen of the houfe of repref. ntatives.  
  
I entertain a ftrong hope, that the ftate of the national finances  
is now fufficiently matured. to enable you to enter upon a fyftema-  
tic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and dif-  
charge of the public debt, according to the right which has been  
referved to the government.—No meafure can be more defirable,  
whether viewed with an eye to its intrinfic importance, er to the ge.  
neral fentiment and with of the nation. —Provifion is likewife requi-  
fite for the reimburfement of the loan which has been made of the  
bank of the united ftates, purfuant to the eleventh fection ot the act  
by whick it isincorporated. In fulfilling the public flipulations in  
this particular, it is expected, a valuable faving will be made,  
  
Appropriations for the current fervice of the enfuing year, and  
for fuch extraordinaries as may require provifien, will demand, and,  
I doubt not, will engage your early attention.  
  
Gentlemen of the fenate and of the hou[e of reprefentatives.  
  
I content myfelf with recalling your attention, generally, to fuch  
objects, vot particularized in my prefent, as have been fugygelted in  
ny former communications to you.  
  
Various temporary laws will expire during the prefent feflion.  
Among thefe, that which regulates trade and intercourfe with the  
Indian tribes, will merit particular notice.  
  
The refults of your common deliberations hitherto, will, I truft,  
be productive of folid and durable advantages to our conflituents :  
fuch, as by conciliating more and more their ultimate fuffrage, will  
tend to ftrengthen and confirm their attachment tothat conititution  
of government, upon which, under divine Providence, materially  
depend their union, their fafety, and their happinefs.  
  
Still farther to promote and fecure thefe ineftimable ends, there is  
nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful  
cultivation of harmony, combined with a due regard to ftabiliry m  
the public councils. G. WASHINGTON

Fellow citizens of the Senate and  
Houfe of Rept ejsnlatives  
  
IT is fome abatement of the fa-  
tisfaction, with which I meet  
you on the prefent occafion, that  
in felicitating you on a continuati-  
on of the national profperity, ge-  
nerally; I am not able to add to it  
information that the Indian hoftdities  
which have for fome time part, dif-  
treffed our north weftern frontier*,  
kave terminated.  
  
You will, I am perfuaded, learn  
with no lefs concern than I commu-  
nicate it, that reiterated endeavour*  
towards effecting a pacification have  
hitherto iffued only in n:w and out-  
ragcous proofs of perfev&#x27;ering hoftili-  
tv on the part of the tubes wiih  
whom we are in contcft. An ear-  
ner! defire to procure tranquility to  
this frontier — to flop the farther ef-  
fufion of human blood— to arreft  
the progrefs of cxnence— to&#x27; &#x27;orward  
the prevalent with of the nation, for 1  
peace, has led to ft r enuous efforts,  
thro various channels, to a:compli!h  
thefe defirable p.upofes ; in miking  
which efforts, I confulted lefs my  
ewn anticipations of the event or  
the fcruples which fome conffJerati-  
ons- Aere calculated to infpire, than  
tne win to find the object attai&#x27;m-  
able, or if not attainable to afcertain  
unequivocally that fuch is the cafe.  
  
A detail of the meafurei which&#x27;  
Kave been porfued, and of their con-  
fequences which will be 1 lid before  
you, while it will conhrm to you the  
want of fuecefs, thus far will, Itruft,  
evince that means as proper .and as  
efficacious as could have been devif-  
ed, have been employed, the iffue  
bf fome of them, indeed,- is ftill de-  
pending: but a favourable one, tho*  
not to bedefpaired of, is not promif-  
ed by any thing that has yet hap-  
pened.  
  
In the eourfe of the attempts which  
have been made,- fome valuable citi-  
zens have fallen violins to their leal  
for the public fervice. A fan£fion  
commonly refpe£tcd even among fa-  
vages, has been found, in this in-  
stance, infufficienr to protect from  
maffacre the emiffaries of Peace. It  
will, I prefuine, be duly conlidered  
whether the occafion does not call  
for an exercife of liberality toward*  
the families of the deceafed.  
  
It muft add to your concern, to be  
informed, that befides the continua-  
tion of hoftile appearance* among  
the tribes north\&gt;f the Ohio, fome  
fhreatning fymptons have of late  
been revived among fume of thofe  
fouth of it.  
  
A part of the Cherokeei, known  
by the name of Chkkamagas, inha-  
  
biting five villages on the Tenneffee  
river, have long been in the prac-  
tice of committing depreciations oh  
the neighbouring lettlcments.  
  
It was hoped that the treaty of  
rlolfhh, made with the Cherokee  
nation in July, 1791, would have  
prevented a repetition of fuch de-  
predations. But the event has not  
angered this hope The Chicka-  
mages, aided by fome banditti of  
another tribe, in their vicinity,  
hate recently perpetrated wanton  
arid unprovoked hoft lities upon the  
citieeus of the United States in that  
quarter. The imormation w hich ha*  
betn received ontM; fUbJeft, will be  
laid before you. Hi&#x27;herto defenflve  
precautions only have been ftnetly  
enjoined and obferved.  
, It is not un lei iiood that any  
breach of treaty, or a^an-ffion what-  
soever on the part or the U. States,  
or their citifeni, i* even alleged  
as a pretext lor the fpi.it al humili-  
ty in this quarter-  
  
1 have reafon to believe that every  
practicable exertion has been made  
(purfuant t6 the provilion by&quot; law  
for that purpcTe) to be prepared  
for tha alternative of a profecution  
of the war, in the event of a fail-  
ure cf pacific overtures. A large  
proportion of tha troops authoris-  
ed tc &quot;be failed, have been recruit-  
ed, though the number is ftiil in-  
complete. A. id pain* Save been ta-  
ken to dil&#x27;ciphne, and put them in  
condition for fne particular kind of  
fervice to be performed. A&#x27; d. lay  
of ope.-atiojis (belMes being dictated  
by the meafures which *ere pu&#x27;rfa-  
ingtowarrdi pacacc termination of  
the war) ha* been in ittelf deem-  
ed preferable to immature efforts. A  
ftctcment, from the proper depart-  
ment, with regard to the number of  
troop* raifed, and fome other points  
which have been lu^gt-fted, will af-  
ford more precile information, as a  
guide to the legiflative confutati-  
ons ; and amony: other things will  
enable Congrtfs to judge whether  
fome additional ftimulas to the re-  
cruiting fervice may not be adv fea-  
bJe.  
  
In looking forward to the future  
expence of the operations, which  
may be found inevitable, I derive  
confolation from the inforuuricn I  
received, that the product of the  
revenues for the prefent year is like-  
ly to fupercede the necrfTuy of ad-  
ditional burthens on the communi-  
ty, for the fervice of the enming  
year. This, however, will be bet-  
ter afcertained in the eourfe of the  
feffion :— -and it is proper to add,  
that the information alluded to, pro-  
ceeds upon the fuppofjtion of no ma-  
terial extentionoi the fpirit of hofti-  
Ihy.  
  
1 cannot difmifs the fubject of In-  
dian affairs, without again recom-  
mending to your confiueration the  
expediency of more adequate pro-  
vision for giving energy i« the lawi  
  
throughout our interior frontier j  
and for reftraing the commiHion of  
outrages upon the Indian*; without  
which all pacific plans muft prove  
nugatory, &#x27;foeni I-, by compe-  
tent rewards, the employment of  
qualified and truity perfons to refide  
am &gt;ng them, as agents, would alio  
contribute to the prefervation of  
peace and good neighbourhood  
, It in adoition to thefe expedients,  
an eligible plan could be devifed for  
promoting civihzatiori a tiong the  
friendly tribes,&#x27; and for carrying on  
trade with them, upCrt a fcale equal  
to their wants, and undiir regulati-  
on. c.itcu ated to protect them from  
impofuion and extortion, its influ-  
ence in cemertling their in ereftl  
with ours coulJ not but be confide-  
rable&#x27;. ,  
  
The prb&#x27;fpejous ft ifc of our reve-  
nii? ha« been iatijn ued. This \» ould  
ft 11 be more the cafe w ere it tfoz for  
the impede nents, which in fome  
places continue to embarrafs the col-  
lection of the duties on fpirits diftill-  
ed within the United States.—  
Thefe im plements have lelfened,  
and are lelTening in local extent;—  
and as applied to the community at  
farge the contentment with the law  
appears to be progr^fiive. But fymp-  
tons of in&#x27;creafcd oppofition having  
lately maniiefted themlelves in cer-  
Cain qudrters ; — I judged a fpecial  
interpo&#x27;ition 0:1 my part proper and  
advileahle : A unJer this impreffion.  
have illued a proclamation waning  
ajjjiult all unlawful combinaiiotis  
and proceedings, having for their  
object or tending to oblrruct the o-  
peration of the larw in queftion, and  
announcing that ail lawful ways anJ  
means would be ttrict.&#x27;y put in exe-  
cution for bringing to j-jftice the in-  
fractors thereof, and Securing obedi.  
ence thereto.  
  
Meafures have a If •&gt; been taken for  
the profecution of offenders j and  
Congrefs may be a^hired, that noth-  
ing wiihin conlti&#x27;utional and legal  
1 mi s which may depend on me,  
fhall be wanting toaiTertand main-  
tain the jult authority of the laws.  
— In fulfilling th.is truit I fha&#x27;l count  
entirely upon the full co operation  
of tne other departments of the go-  
vernment, and upon the zealous fup-  
p&#x27;ort of all good citizens.  
  
I cannot forbear to bring again  
into the view of the legiflature the  
fubject of a revifion of the judiciary  
f^ltem. — A&#x27;reprcfentation from the  
judges of the fupreme court, which  
will be l.iid before you, points out  
fome of the inconveniences that are  
experienced. — .In the eourfe of the  
execution of the laws, confederati-  
ons arife out of the ftiucturu of that  
fyfrem, which, in fome cafes, tend to  
relax thtil 1 efficafy. — As connected  
with this fubject, provifions to faci-  
litate the taking of bail upon pro-  
cedes out of the courts of the Uni-  
ted States, and a lupplementary de-  
finition of offences againft the con-  
  
ffitu&#x27;ion and laws of the union, ani  
of the pnnilhment for fuch offences,  
will, it is prefurned, be found worthy  
of particular attention.  
  
Denervations on the value of  
peace with other nations are unne-  
ceffary. It would be wife, howe-  
ver, by timely provifions, to guard  
againft thofe acts of our own citi-  
zens, which might tend to difturb it,  
and to put ourfclves in a condition  
to give that fatisfaction to foreign  
nations, which we may f &gt;metimes  
have occafion to require from t ie n s  
I particularly reco n mend to your  
confiderat&#x27;nn the means of prevent-  
ing thofe aggrelfions, by our ciri-  
xeps, on the territory of other niti-  
ons, and other infractions of tha  
law ol na&#x27;ions, w hich furnifhing jull  
fu&#x27;ject of complaint, might endan-  
ger our peace with them : And h  
general, the maintenance of a friend-  
ly intercourfe with foreign powers,  
wili-be prefented to your attention  
by the eviration °f the law for that  
purpofe, which takes place, if not  
renewed, at the clufe 0 f the pref&lt;nt  
felfion.  
  
In the ■executory of the authority  
given by the legtilature, meafures  
have been taken for engaging foma  
artiit fr,a-n abroad, to aid in the  
eftablilhment of our mint ; othera  
have been employed at home;  
P/rovifion h&gt;s been made for the  
requeue bail ling, and thefe are n.&gt; r  
put in 0 proper condition for the  
purpofes of the e Hblilhment.  
Tiiere hit alfa been a fnall b:gin-  
n ng in tiio coinage of half dtfutea ;  
the want of fnill coins in circulati-  
on calli ig the firil attention to the n.  
  
The regulation of foreig.i coins,  
in correfpnndency with the princi-  
ple* of our national coinage, as be-  
ing elTential to their due operation,  
and to order in our money concerns,  
will I doubt not, be refu ned an i  
co n pleaded.  
  
It is reprefented that fom- provi-  
fions, in the law which eftablifhea  
the port -office* operate, in experi-  
ment, againft the tranfmilfion of  
news-papers to diftant parts of the  
country.  
  
Should this, upon due enquiry,;^:  
be found to be the fact, a fu:l con&#x27;:?&#x27;&#x27;  
viccion of the importance of facilita-  
ting the circulation of political intel-  
ligence and information, will, I  
doubt not, lead to the application of  
a remedy.  
  
The adoption of a conftitution for  
the ftate of Kentucky has been no-  
tified to me.— The legfiature wilL *  
fhare with me in the fatisfaction  
which arifes from an event lete-  
refting to the happinefs of the part  
of the nation, to which it relates,  
and conducive to the general or-  
der.  
  
It is proper likewife to- inform  
you, that fince my laft communi-  
cation on the fubject, and in fur-  
ther execution of the acts feveral-  
ly making provifieus for the pub.  
  
lie debt and for the reduction there-  
x)f, three new loans have been effect-  
fei, each for three millions of flo-  
rins ; one at Antwerp, at the annu-  
al intereft of four and one half per  
«ent. with an allowance of four per  
cent, in lieu of all charges, and the  
other two at AmfteruVm, at the an-  
nual intereft of four per cent, with  
an allowance of five and one half per  
cent, in one cafe, and of five per  
cent, in the other, in lieu of a!i  
charges. The rates of thefe loans*  
and the circumftances under which  
they have been made, are confirma-  
tions ot the high ftate of our credit  
  
abroad. Among the objects to  
  
which thefc funds have been direct-  
ed to be applied, the payment of the  
debts due to certain foreign officers,  
according to the provifion made du-  
ring the laft feflion, has been embra-  
ced.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Rc-  
prefenutives,  
  
I entertain a ftrong hope, that tha  
ftate of the national finances, is now  
fnfftciently matured, to enable you  
to enter upon a fyftematic and effee- •  
tual arrangement, for the regular re-  
demption and difcharge of the pub-  
lic debt, according to the right which  
has been referved to the government.  
  
. -No meafure can be more defi-  
  
rable, whether viewed with an eye  
to its intrific importance, or to tha  
general fentiment and wilh of the  
nation.  
  
Provifion is likewife rcquifite to  
the reivi.burfement of the lo^n which  
has been made of the bank of the  
United States, purfuant t&gt; the nth  
fiction of the act by which it is in-  
corporated— -in fulfilling the public  
ftipula&#x27;ions in this particular it is ex-  
pected a valuable faving will be  
made.  
  
Appropriations for the currer.t  
fervice of the enfuing year, and for  
fuch extraordinaries as may require  
prvoifion, will demand, and 1 doubt  
not, will engage your early attenti-  
on.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of  
the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
I concent myfeif with recalling  
your attention, generally, &#x27;o fuch  
objects, not particularized in my  
prefenr, as have been fuggefted in  
mv former communications to you.  
  
Various temporary laws will ex-  
pire dur.ng the prcfent feflion, a-  
mong thefe, that which regulates  
trade and intercoule with the Indi-  
an tribes, will merit particular no-  
tice.  
  
The refults of your common deli-  
berations, hitherto, will, I iruff, be  
productive of folid and durable ad-  
vantages to our confthuents ; fuch  
as, by conciliating more and more  
their ultimate fuffrage, will tend to  
fhrengthen and confirm their attach-  
ment to that conftitution and go-  
vernment, upon which, under di-  
vine providence, materially depend  
their union, their fafety and their&#x27;  
happinefs  
  
Still, further, to promote ancT  
fecurethefe ineftimableends, there is*  
nothing which can havea more pow-  
fui tendency than the careful cultiva-  
tion of harmony, combined with a  
due regard to ftability in the public:  
councils.
