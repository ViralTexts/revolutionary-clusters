Dear Sir  
Head Quarters 2d June 1783  
  
Your favor of the 20th of May I received with much pleasure—For I can assure you, that, among the many worthy &amp; meritorious Officers, with whom I have had the happiness to be connected in Service, through the Course of this War, and from whose chearfull  
Assistance &amp; Advice I have received much support &amp; Confidence in the various &amp; trying Vicissitudes of a Complicated Contest, the Name of a Putnam is not forgotten; nor will it be, but with that Stroke of Time which shall obliterate from my Mind, the Remembrance of  
all those Toils &amp; Fatigues, through which we have struggled for the preservation &amp; Establishment of the Rights, Liberties &amp; Independance of our Country.  
Your Congratulations on the happy propects of Peace &amp; Independent Security, with their attendant Blessings to the United States, I receive with great Satisfaction; and beg that you will accept A Return of my Gratulations to you, on this auspicious  
Event—an Event, in which, great as it is in itself, &amp; glorious as it will probably be in its Consequences, you have a Right to participate largely, from the distinguished part you have contributed towards its attainment.  
But while I contemplate the greatness of the Object for which we have contended, and felicitate you on the happy Issue of our Toils &amp; Labors, which have terminated with such general Satisfaction—I lament that you should feel the ungratefull Returns of a  
Country, in whose Service you have exhausted your Bodily Health, &amp; expended the Vigor of youthfull Constitution—I wish however that your Expectations of returng Sentiments of Liberality may be verified. I have a hope they may—But should they not, your Case will not be a  
singular One, Ingratitude has been experienced in all Ages—&amp; Republics in particular have ever been famed for the exercise of that unnatural &amp; sordid Vice.  
The Secretary at War, who is now here, informs me that you have ever been considered as entituled to full pay, since your Absence from the field, &amp; that you will be still considered in that Light till the Close of the War—at which period, you will be  
equally entituled to the same Emoluments of half pay or Commutation, as other Officers of your Rank—The same Opinion is also given by the P.M. Genl—who is now with the Army, empowered by Mr Morris for the Settlement of all their Accounts—and who will attend to yours whenever  
you shall think proper to send on for the purpose; which will probably be best for you to do in a short Time.  
I anticipate with pleasure the Day, &amp; that I trust not far off, when I shall quit the busey Scenes of a military Employment, &amp; retire to the more tranquil Walks of Domestic Life. In that, or whatever other Situation, Providence may dispose of my  
future Days, the Remembrance of the many friendships &amp; Connections I have had the Happiness to contract with the Gentlemen of the Army will be one of my most gratefull Reflections—Under this Contemplation and Impressed with the Sentiments of Benevolence &amp; Regard, I  
commend you, my Dear Sir, my other Friends, &amp; with them, the Interests &amp; Happiness of our Dear Country, to the keeping &amp; Protection of Almighty God. With great Truth &amp;

** Head-Quarters, 2d June, 1783.  
“ Dear Sir:  
  
* Your favor of the 20th of May I received  
with much, pleasure. For I can assure you,  
that, among the many ats | and meritorious  
officers with whom | have had the happiness to  
be connected in service through the course of  
this war, and from whose cheerful assistance and  
advice I have received much support and confi-  
dence, in the various and trying vicissitudes of  
a complicated contest, the name of Putnam is not  
forgotten; nor will be but with that stroke of  
time, which shall obliterate from my mind the  
remembrance of all those toils and fatigues,  
through which we have struggled, for the pre-  
servation and establishment of the Rights, Li-  
berties,and Independence of our Country.  
  
“Your congratulations on the happy pros-  
pects of our peace and independent security,  
with their attendant blessings, to the United  
States, I receive with great satisfaction; and  
beg that you will accept a return of my gratula-  
tions to you on this auspicious event—an event,  
in which, great as it is in itself, and glorious as  
it will probably be in its consequences, you have  
aright to participate largely, from the distin-  
guished part you have contributed towards its  
attainment.  
  
“ But while I contemplate the greatness of  
the object for which we have contended, and fe-  
licitate you on the happy issue of our toils and  
labors, which have terminated with such gene-  
ral satisfaction, I lament that you should feel the  
ungrateful returns of a country in whose service  
you have exhausted your bodily health, and ex-  
pended the vigor of a youthful constitution. |  
wish, however, that your expectations of re-  
turning sentiments of liberality may be verified.  
| have a hope that they may—but should they  
not, your career will not be a singular one. In-  
gratitude has been —— in all ages; and  
Republics, in particular, have ever been famed  
for the exercise of that unnatural and sordid vice.  
  
“ The Secretary at War, who is now here, 1n-  
forms me that you have been considered as enti-  
tled to full pay since your absence from the  
field, and that you will still be considered in that  
light till the close of the war ; at which period  
you will be equally entitled to the same emolu-  
ments of half-pay, or commutation, as other offi-  
cers of your rank. The same opinion is also  
given by the Paymaster General, who is now  
with the army, empowered by Mr. Morris for  
the settlement of all their accounts, and who  
will attend to yours, whenever you shall think  
proper to send on for that purpose, which it will  
probably be best for you to do in a short time.  
  
“I anticipate, with pleasure, the day—and  
that I trust not far off—when I shall quit tne busy  
scenes of a military employment, and retire to  
the more tranquil walks of domestic life. In  
that, or whatever other situation Providence  
may dispose of my future days, the remembrance  
of the many friendships and connexions I have  
had the happiness to contract with the gentle-  
men of the Army, will be one of my most grate-  
ful reflections. Under this contemplation, and  
impressed with the sentiments of benevolence  
and regard, | commend you, my dear Sir, my  
other friends, and with them the interest and  
happiness of our dear country, to the keeping  
and protection of Almighty God.

stroke of time which shall obliterate  
from my mind the remembrance of all  
those toils and fatigues through  
which we have struggled  
for the preservation and es-  
tablishment of the Rights,  
Liberties, and Independ-

“Your congratulations on  
the happy prospects of peace  
and independent security,  
with their attendant bless-  
ings to the United States, I  
receive with great satisfac-

accept a return of my grat-

picious event—an_ event,  
in which, great as it is in it-  
self, and glorious as it will  
probably be in its conse-

terminated with such general satisfac-  
tion, I lament that you should feel the  
ungrateful returns of a country, in  
whose service you have exhausted  
your bodily strength, and expended  
the vigor of a youthful constitution. I  
wish, however, that your expectations  
of returning liberality may be verified.  
I have a hope they may—but should

perienced in all ages, and republics,  
in particular, have ever been famed  
for the exercise of that unnatural and  
sordid vice.”
