d Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
November 22d. 1800.  
  
Immediately after the adjournment of Congress, at their last session in Philadelphia, I gave directions, in compliance with the laws for the removal of the public offices, records and property. These directions have been executed and the public officers have since resided and conducted the ordinary business of the government in this place.  
I congratulate the people of the United States on the assembling of Congress at the permanent seat of their government, &amp; I congratulate you, Gentlemen, on the prospect of a residence not to be changed. Although there is cause to apprehend that accomodations are not now so compleat, as might be wished, yet there is great reason to beleive, that this inconvenience will cease with the present session.  
It would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to assemble for the first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the supreme ruler of the universe &amp; imploring his blessing. May this territory be the residence of virtue &amp; happiness. In this city may that piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnanimity, that constancy &amp; self government which adorned the great character, whose name it bears, be for ever held in veneration. How and throughout our country, may simple manners, pure morals and true religion flourish forever.  
It is with you, gentlemen, to consider whether the local powers over the district of Columbia, vested by the constitution in the congress of the United States, shall be immediately exercised. If in your opinion this important trust ought now to be executed, you cannot fail while performing it, to take into view the future probable situation of the territory, for the happiness of which, you are about to provide. You will consider it, as the capital of a great nation, advancing with unexampled rapidity in arts in commerce in wealth &amp; in population, and possessing within itself those energies and resources, which if not thrown away or lamentably misdirected, secure to it a long course of prosperity &amp; self government.  
In compliance with a law of the last session of Congress, the officers &amp; soldiers of the temporary army, have been discharged. It affords real pleasure to recollect, the honorable testimony they gave, of the patriotic motives, which brought them into the service of their country, by the readiness and regularity, with which they returned to the station of private citizens.  
It is in every point of view of such primary importance, to carry the laws into prompt &amp; faithful execution, &amp; to render that part of the administration of justice, which the constitution &amp; laws devolve on the federal courts, as convenient to the people, as may consist with their present circumstances, that I can not omit once more to recommend to your serious consideration, the judiciary system of the United States. No subject is more interesting than this to the public happiness, &amp; to none can those improvements, which may have been suggested by experience, be more beneficially applied.  
A treaty of Amity &amp; commerce with the king of Prussia has been concluded &amp; ratified. The ratifications have been exchanged, &amp; I have directed the treaty to be promulgated by proclamation.  
The difficulties, which suspended the execution of the 6th article of our treaty of Amity, commerce &amp; navigation with Great Britain, have not yet been removed. The negotiation on this subject is still depending. As it must be for the interest &amp; honor of both nations to adjust this difference with good faith, I indulge confidently the expectation, that the sincere endeavors of the government of the United States to bring it to an amicable termination, will not be disappointed.  
The Envoys extraordinary &amp; ministers plenipotentiary from the United States to France were received by the first Consul with the respect due to their character &amp; three persons with equal powers were appointed to treat with them. Although at the date of the last official intelligence, the negotiation had not terminated, yet it is to be hoped that our efforts to effect an accomodation will at length meet with a success proportioned to the sincerity, with which they have been so often repeated  
While our best endeavors, for the preservation of harmony with all nations, will continue to be used, the experience of the world, our own experience admonish us of the insecurity of trusting too confidently to their success. We cannot, without committing a dangerous imprudence, abandon those measures of self protection, which are adapted to our situation, &amp; to which, notwithstanding our pacific policy, the violence &amp; injustice of others may again compel us to resort. While our vast extent of sea coast, the commercial &amp; agricultural habits of our people, the great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean, suggest the system of defence, which will be most beneficial to ourselves;—Our distance from Europe &amp; our resources for maratime strength will enable us to employ it with effect. Seasonable &amp; systematic arrangements, so far as our resources will justify for a navy, adapted to defensive war &amp; which may, in case of necessity, be quickly brought into use, seem to be as much recommended by a wise &amp; true œconomy, as by a just regard for our future tranquility, for the safety of our shores &amp; for the protection of our property, committed to the ocean. The present navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence, by a great national exigency, has raised us in our own esteem &amp; by the protection, afforded to our commerce, has effected to the extent of our expectations, the objects for which it was created.  
In connection with a navy, ought to be contemplated, the fortification of some of our principal seaports &amp; harbors. A variety of considerations, which will readily suggest themselves urge an attention to this measure of precaution. To give security to our principal ports, considerable sums have already been expended, but the works remain incomplete. It is for Congress to determine, whether additional appropriations shall be made, in order to render competent, to the intended purposes, the fortifications, which have been commenced.  
The manufacture of arms, within the United States, still invites the attention of the national legislature. At a considerable expence to the public, this manufactory has been brought to such a state of maturity, as with continued encouragement, will supersede the necessity of future importations for foreign countries.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
I shall direct the estimates of the appropriations, necessary for the ensuing year, together with an account of the public revenue &amp; expenditure, to a late period, to be laid before you. I observe with much satisfaction, that the product of the revenue, during the present year, has been more considerable, than during any former equal period. This result affords conclusive evidence, of the great resources of this country &amp; of the wisdom &amp; efficiency of the measures, which have been adopted by Congress, for the protection of commerce &amp; preservation of public credit.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
As one of the grand community of nations, our attention is irresistably drawn to the important scenes, which surround us. If they have exhibited an uncommon portion of calamity, it is the province of humanity to deplore &amp; of wisdom to avoid the causes, which may have produced it. If turning our eyes homeward, we find reason to rejoice at the prospect, which presents itself, if we perceive the interior of our country prosperous, free and happy, if all enjoy in safety, under the protection of laws, emanating only from the general will, the fruits of their own labor, we ought to fortify &amp; cling to those institutions, which have been the source of such real felicity &amp; resist with unabating perseverance, the progress of those dangerous innovations, which may diminish their influence.  
To your patriotism, gentlemen, has been confided, the honorable duty of guarding the public interests, &amp; while the past is to your country, a sure pledge, that it will be faithfully discharged, permit me to assure you, that your labors to promote the general happiness, will receive from me the most zealous cooperation

in our own elieem, and by the protection

Gentleman of the Senate, and Gentlemen  
of the House of Representatives,  
  
IMMEDIATE LY after the adjournment  
of Congrees at their last session in Philadel-  
phia, I gave directions, in compliance with  
the laws. for the removal of the public offi-  
ces, recordsand property. These directions  
have been executed, and the public officers  
have since resided and conducted the ordina-  
ry business of the government in this piace.  
  
I congratulate the people of the United  
states, on the assembling of Congress at the  
permanent seat of their goverment; and i  
congratulate you, gentlemen on the pros-  
pect of the residence not to be changed,—  
although there is cause to apprehend that the  
accommodations are not now so complete  
as might be wished, yet there is great reason  
to believe that this inconvenience will cease  
with the present session.  
  
It would be unbecoming the Representa-  
tives of this nation to assemble for the first  
time, in this solemn temple, without looking  
up to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe,  
and imploring his blessing :  
  
May this Territory be the Residence of  
Virtue and Happiness! In this city may  
that piety and virtue; that wisdom and  
magnanimity; that constancy and self- go-  
verninent, which adorned the great charac-  
ter whose name it bears, be forever held in  
veneration! Here, and throughout our coun-  
try, mzy simple manners, pure morals,  
and true Religion, flourish forever.  
  
Itis with you gentleman, to consider,  
whether the local powers, over the district  
of Coiumbia, vested by the Constitution in  
the Congress of the United states, shall be  
immediately exercised. If, in your opinion,  
this important trust ought now to be execu-  
ted, you cannot fail, while performing it,  
to take into view, the future probable situ-  
ation of the territory, for the happiness of  
which you are abont to provide.  
  
You will consider it as the capital of a  
great nation, advancing with cnexampled  
rapidity, in arts in commerce, in wealth and  
in population; and possessing within itself  
those energies and resources, which, if not  
thrown away, or lamentably misdirected,  
will secure to it along course of prosperity,  
and self-goverment.  
  
In compliance with a law of the last ses-  
sion of Congress, the officers and soldiers  
of the temporary army have been discharged.  
it affords real pleasure to recollect the hon-  
orable testimony they gave of the patriotic  
motives w hich brought them into the service  
ef their country. by the readiness and regu-  
larity with which they returned to the sta-  
tion of private citizens.  
  
It is, inevery point of view of such pri-  
mary importance, to carry the laws into  
prompt and faithful execution, aud to ren-  
der that part of the administration of justice,  
  
which the constitution and laws devolve on  
  
  
  
  
  
the Federal Courts, as convenient to the  
people, as may consist with their present  
circumstances; that I cannot omit once  
more torecommend to your serious consid-  
eration, the judiciary system of the United  
States. No subject is more interesting than  
this tothe public happiness, and to none  
can those improvements, which, may have  
been suggested by experience, be more be-  
neficialiy apphed.  
  
A treaty of Amity and Commerce with  
the king of Prussia been concluded and ra-  
tified. [heratifications have been exchang-  
ed, and J have directed the treaty to be  
promulgated by proclamation.  
  
I he difficulties whick suspended the exe-  
cution of the 6th article of our Treaty of  
Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with  
Great Britain, have notyet been removed.  
Phe negociation on this subject is stili de-  
pending. As it inust be for the interest and  
hovuor of both nations to adjust this differ-  
ence with good fairh, I indurge coufidentiy,  
the expeciation, that the sincere eudeavours  
of the govermeat of the United States, to  
bring it°to an amicable termination, will  
not be disappuinted.  
  
he tavoys extraordinary and Ministers  
Plenipotentiary, from the United States to  
France, were received by the Fir-t Consul  
with the respect due to their character ; and  
three persons with equai powers were ap-  
pomted totreat with them. Although at  
the date of the last otficial intelligence the  
negociation had not terminated, yet it is  
to be hoped, that our efforts to effect an ac-  
commodation, will, at length, meet with a  
success proportioned to the sincerity with  
which they have been so often repeated.  
  
While our best edeavours for the preser-  
vation of harmeny with all nations, will  
continue to be used, the experience of the  
world and our own experience, admonish  
us of the insecurity of trusting too confident-  
ly to their success. We cannot without com-  
mitting a dangerons imprudence, abandon  
those measures of self-protection, which are  
adapted to our situation, and to which, not-  
withstanding our pacific policy, the violence  
and injustice of others inay compel us to re-  
sort. While our vast extent of sea-coast,  
the commercial and agricultural habits of our  
people, the great capital they will continue  
to trust on the ocean, suggest the system of  
defence which will be most beneficial to  
ourselves, our distance from Europe, and  
our resources for maritime strength, will e-  
nable us to employ it with effect. Seasona-  
ble and systematic arrangements so far as  
our resources will justily, for a Navy, adapt-  
edto defensive war, and which may in case  
of necessity, be quickly brought into use,  
seem to be as muchrecommended by a wise  
and true economy, as by a just regard for  
our future tranquillity—for the safety of  
our shores, and for the protection of our  
property committed to the ocean.  
  
The present Navy of the United States,  
called suddenly into existence by a great na-  
tional exigency has raised us in our own es-  
teem, and by the protection afforded to our  
commerce, has effected, to the extent of  
our expectations, the object for which it  
was created,  
  
In conne&amp;ion with a Navy ought to be  
contemplated the fortifications of some of

our principal cea-ports and harbours. A va-  
riety of considerations, which will readily  
suggest themselves, urge an attention to  
this measure of precaution. To give securi-  
ty to our principal ports, con iderable sums  
have already been expeaded, but the works  
remain incomplete. It is for Congress to  
determine whether additiona! appropriations  
shall be made, in order to render conipe-  
tent tu the intended purposes the foriifca-  
tions which have been coinmenced.  
  
The mannf.cture of arms within the Uuni-  
ted States, still invites the atteution of the  
National Legislature. Ata considerable cx-  
pence to the public, this manufactor. has  
been brought to sucha state of maturity, as  
with continued encouresgment, will super-  
cede the necessity of future importations  
from foreign conntries.  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
  
I shall direct the estimates of the appro-  
priations necessary tor the eusuing year, toe  
gether with an acceunt of the public reve-  
nue and expendenture, toa like period, to  
be laid before you.  
  
I observe with much satisfaction, that the  
product of the revenue during the preseat  
year, has been more considerable than dur-  
ing any former equal period. This result  
affords conclusive evidence of the great re~  
sources of this country, and of the wisdom  
and efficiency of the measures, which have  
been adopted by Congress for the protection  
of commerce and preservation of public  
credit.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, 5  
  
As one of the grand community of Na-  
tions, Our attention is irresistibly drawn to  
the important scenes which surround ws. if  
they have excited an uncommon portion of  
calamity, it is the province of humanity to  
deplore, and wisdom to avoid the causes  
which may have produced it. If turning our  
eyes homeward, we find reason to rejoice  
at the prospect which presents itself; it we  
perceive the interior of our country pros-  
perous, free and happy; if we all enjoy  
safety under the protection of laws, emanat-  
ing only from the general will, the fruits of  
our own labour, we ought to fortify and  
cling to those institutions, which have been  
the source of much real felicity, and resist  
with unabating perseverance the progress  
of those dangerous innovations, which may  
diminish their influence.  
  
To your patriotism, gentleman, has been  
confided the honourable duty of guarding  
the public interest, and while the past is to  
your country a sure pledge that it will be  
taithfuily discharged, permit me to assure  
you that your labours to promote the gene-  
ral happiness will receive from me the most

IMM1.DIA I FLY after the adjourn­  
ment oi Corgnfs at their lift leffion  
in Philadelphia, I gave directions, in  
compliance with the laws, lor the re­  
■ moval ol the public: offices, records and  
property, l hefe dire&amp;icns have been  
executed, and the public officers have  
fmee relided and conducted the ordi­  
nary bufinefs ol the government in this  
place.  
I congratulate the people of the ti­  
nned States on the aQemblage of Con­  
greis at the permanent feat of their  
Government; and I congratulate you,  
gentlemen, on the proipeft of a refi­  
dence not to be changed :—although  
there is caufe to apprehend that ac­  
commodations are not now fo complete  
as might he wiihed, vet there is great  
reafon to believe that this inconven­  
ience will ceafe with the prefent feffion.  
It would be unbecoming the repre­  
fentatives ot tliis*nation to alfemble for  
the firfl time, in this folemn temple,  
without looking up to the Supreme  
Ruler of the Univerfe, and imploring  
his bleffing.  
  
may uus territory ne tne rcnaence  
of virtue and happinefs! In this city  
may that piety and virtue ; that wifdom  
and magnanimity ; that oonltancv and  
fell-government, which adorned the  
great chara&amp;er, whole name it bears,  
be forever held in veneration ! Here,  
and throughout our country, may Am­  
ple manners, pure morals, and true  
religion, flourilh forever.  
It is with you, gentlemen,to confider  
whether the local, powers, over the  
diflrid of Columbia, veiled by the  
Conilttution in the Congrefa of the  
United States, fhall be immediately  
exercifed. If in your opinion, this  
important trull ought now to be exe­  
cuted, y®u cannot fail, while perform­  
  
ing it to take into view the future pro­  
bable fixation of the territory, for the  
happinefs of which you are about to  
provide.  
Ycu will confider it as the Capitol  
of a great nation, advancing with un­  
exampled rapidity, in arts, in com­  
merce, in wealth, and in population :  
and poll effing within itfelf, thofe ener­  
gies and relourees, which if not thrown  
away, or lamentably misdire&amp;ed, fe­  
eing to it a long courfe of profperty  
and felf-government.  
In compliance with a law of the iaft  
leflion of Congrefs, the officers and  
loldiers of the temporary army have  
been discharged. It affords real plea­  
sure to recoiled the honorable tefli­  
mony they gave of the patriotic motives,  
which brought them into the fervice  
of their country, by the readinefs and  
regularity with which they returned to  
the ftation of private Wizens.  
It is in every point of view, of fuch  
primary importance to carry the laws  
into prompt and faithful execution,and  
to render that part of the adminiftra­  
tion of juflicc which the conflitution  
and laws devolve on the federal courts,  
as convenient to the people, as may  
confift with their prefent circumftan­  
ces ; that I cannot omit once more, Co  
recommend to your ierious confidera­  
tion, the judiciary fyftera of the United  
States*. No lubjed is more interfiling  
than tais to the public happinefs, and  
to none can thole improvements which  
may have been fuggelted by experience,  
be more beneficially applied.  
A treaty of amity and commerce  
with the King of Pruffia, has been con­  
cluded and ratified. The ratifications  
have been exchanged, and I have di­  
rected the treaty to be promulgated by  
proclamation.  
  
1 he dimcu!ue3 which fufpended the  
execution of the 6th article of our  
treaty of Amity,Commerce and Navi­  
gation, with Great Britain, have not  
yet been removed. The negociation  
on this fubjedt is Hill depending. As  
it mu ft be for the intereft and honor  
of both nations, to adjuft this differ­  
ence with good faith, 1 indulge confi­  
dently the expedition that the fincere  
endeavours of the Government of the  
United States, to bring it to an amica­  
ble termination, will not be difappoint­  
ed.  
1 he Envoys Extraordinary and Min­  
ifbers Plenipotentiary, from the United  
States to France, were received by the  
hr ft Conful with the refpedt due to their  
charadter ^ and three perfons, with  
equal powers, were appointed to treat  
with them. Although at the date of  
the lalt official intelligence the negoci­  
&quot;ition had not terminated, yet it is to  
be hoped, that our efforts to effect an  
accommodation, will at length meet  
with a luccefs proportioned to the linn  
cerity wTith which they have been  
often repeated.  
  
While our heft endeavours for the  
prefervation of harmony with all na­  
tions will continue to be ufed, the ex­  
perience of the world and our own  
experience, admonifh us of the infecur­  
ity of nulling too confidently to their­  
fuccefs. We cannot, without commit­  
ting a dangerous imprudence, abandon  
thofe meafures of felf-prote&amp;ion, which  
are adapted to our fituation, and to  
which, notwithflanding our pacific po­  
licy, the violence and injuflice of oth­  
ers, may compel us to rcfort. While  
our vafl extent of feacoafl, the coni  
mercial and agricultural habits of our  
people, the great capital they will con­  
tinue to trull on the ocean, fuggeffc  
the fyflem of defence which will be  
moft beneficial to ourfelves, our dif.  
ranee from Europe, and our refources

recommended bv a wife anu true econ­  
omy, as by a iuit regard for our.future  
tranquility, for the faiety of our {Lores,  
and for the protection of our property  
committed to ihe ocean.  
The prefent Navy of the United  
States called fuddenly into exigence by  
a great national exigency, has raifed  
us in our own tfleeni, and by the pro­  
tection afforded to our commerce, has  
effected, to the extent of our expecta­  
tions, the objett for which it was cre­  
ated.  
In connexion with a Navy, ought  
to be contemplated ihe fortification of  
fome of our principal fea-ports and har­  
bours. A variety of confederations,  
which will readily fugged themfelves,  
urge an attention to this measure of  
precaution. To give fecuiity to our  
principal ports, confiderable fums have  
already been expended, but the works  
remain incomplete. It is for Congrefs  
to determine whether additional ap­  
propriations fhali be made in order to  
render competent, to the intended pur­  
pofes the fortifications which have been  
commenced.  
The manufacture of arms within the  
United States, dill invites the attention  
of the National Legiflature. At a  
confiderable expence to the public, this  
manufactory has been brought to fuch  
a date of maturity, as with continued  
encouragement, will fupercede the ne­  
ceflity of future importations from for­  
eign countries.

1 fhali direct the eltiinates of the ap­  
propriations neceffary for the enfuing  
year, together withjftn account of the  
public revenue and expenditure, to a  
like period, to be laid before you.  
I obferve with much Satisfaction that  
the product of the revenue during  
the prefent year, has been mere confi­  
derable than during any former equal  
period. The refult affords conclulive  
evidence of the great refources of this  
country, and the wifdom and efficacy  
of the meafures, which have been  
adopted by Congrefs for the prote&amp;ion  
of commerce and preservation of pub­  
lic credit.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the Houle of Representatives  
As one of the grand community of  
Nations, our attention is irrefutably  
drawn to the important feenes which  
furround ns. If they have exhibited  
an uncommon portion of calamity, it  
is the province of humanity to deplore,  
and wifdom to avoid, the caufes which  
may have produced it. If turning our  
eyes homeward, we find realon to re­  
joice at the profpeft which prefents, it­  
felf ; if we perceive the interior of our  
Country profperous, free and happy ;  
if we enjoy in fafety, under the protec­  
tion of laws, emanating only from the  
general will, the fruits of our own la­  
bour, we ought to fortify and cling to  
* thofe inftitutions, which have been the  
fource of much real felicity, and refill  
with unabating perfeverance the prog­  
refs of thofe dangerous innovations,  
which may diminilh their influence.  
To your patriotifm, gentlemen, has  
been confidered the honorable duty of  
guarding the public intered, and while  
the pail is to your country a fure  
pledge that it will be faithfully dif­  
charged, permit me to allure you that  
your labours to promote the general  
happinefs will receive from me the  
mcH zealous co-operation.

Gentlemen qf {ﬁe Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
- AIMMEDIATELY afier the adjourn­  
ment of Coongrels at their last session in  
Philadélpbia, I gave dire&amp;tions, in com­  
pliance with the laws, for the removal of  
ths public offices, records and property.  
Thelz dire&amp;tions have been cxccutco‘rand  
the public ‘officers have since resided and  
eonculed the ordinary bufinefls of the gov­  
ernment in this place.  
I congratulate the people of the United  
States on the allemblage of Congress at the  
permanent (eat of their Government ; and  
1 congratulate you, gentlemen, on the prof­  
peft of a refidenee notto be chapged :—  
although there 1s cause to 2pprehend that  
accommodations are not now {o complete as  
might be wificd, yet there is great realon to  
believe that this incoavenience will cease  
with the present session. &#x27;  
It would be anbecoming the representa­  
tives of this ration to alfsmble for the firlk  
time, in this solemn temple, withoat look­  
10g up to the Supreme Rauler of the Uni­  
ver{e, and imploring his blefling. :  
May this territory be the residence of  
virtue and happine(s ! In this city may that  
picty and virrue ; that wisdom and magna­  
nimity ; that constancy and felf-govern­  
ment, which adorned the great charater,  
whole name it bears, be forever held in  
veneration ! Here, and throughout our  
country, may simple manoers, pure mor­  
als, and true relgion, flourith forever.  
It is with you, gentlemen, to confider  
whether the local powers, over the dul­  
triét of Columbia, vested by the Conftitu.  
tion in the Congress of the United States,  
shall be immediately exercised. If in your  
opinion, this important trust ought now to  
_be executed, you cannot fail, while per­  
forming it to take into view the fatare pro­  
bable fitnation of the territory, for the hap­  
pinels of which you are about to provide.  
You will confider it as the Capitel of a  
great nation, advaocing with unexampled  
rapidity, in arts, in commerce, in wealth,  
and in population : and pofleffing within it­  
felf, those energies and resources, which if  
not thrown away, or lamentably misdireéted,  
secure to it a long course of prosperity and  
{cif-government, ‘  
In compliance with 2 law of the lait ses­  
sion of Congress, the’ officers and soldiers  
of the temporary army have been discharg­  
ed. Itaffords real plealure to recolleét the  
honorabie testimony they gave of the pa­  
triotic motives, which brought them into  
the service of their couniry, by the readi­  
ness avd regularity with which they re.  
turned to the station of private citizens.  
It is in every pom: of view, of such  
primary importance 1o carry the laws into  
prompt and faithful executon, and to ren­  
der that part of the administration of jus­  
tice which the cooftitution and laws devolve  
‘on the federal courts, as convenient to the  
Ppeople, as may consist with their present  
circumitances ; that 1 cannot omit once  
more, to recommend to your serious con­  
sideration, the judiciary fyflem of the Uni­  
ted States. No fubjeél is more interefling  
than this to the public &quot;happiness, and to  
none can those improvements which may  
bave been fuggelted by experience, be  
suore beneficially applied.  
A treaty of amity and commerce with  
the king of Pruflia, has been concluded  
2nd ratified. The ratifications have been  
exchanged, 20d 1 have direfled the treaty to  
be promulgated by proclamatien. *  
The difficulties which {ufpended the ex­  
ecution of the 6th articleof our Treaty of  
Amity, commerce and Navigation, with-  
Great Britain, have net yet been removed.  
The negociation on this fubje@® s ]l ‘de­  
pending. Asit mast be for theintereft and  
honour of both nations, to. adjul this dife!  
ference with good faith, I indulge confis’  
deutly the expe&amp;ation that the ficcere en­  
@avours of the Government of the United  
States, to bring it to an amicable termina­  
tion, will not bz disappointed. &#x27;  
The Envoys Extraordinary and Minis--  
ters Plenipotentiary, from the U, States to  
France, were reccived by the firlft Consul  
with the réfpe&amp;t due to their charaller ;  
and three persons, with equal powers, were  
appointed to treat with them, Althpugh  
at the date of the last official intelligence  
the negociation had not terminated, yet it is  
to be hoped, that our efforts to effe&amp;t an  
agcommodation, will at length meet with a  
fuccels proportioned to the sincerity with  
which they have been so ofien repeated,  
While our best endeavours for the pre­  
{ervation of harmony. with all natians will  
continae to be used, the experience of the  
world and our own experience, admonith  
us of the inlecurity of trusting too confi­  
dently 10 their success. We cannot, with­  
out committivg a davgerous imprudence,  
sbandon ‘thofe measures of feif-proteétion,  
which are adapied te our situation, and to  
which, notwithstanding our pacific policy,  
the violence and injuflice of others, may  
compel us to resort., While our vast ex.

our principal {ca.ports and harbours. A  
variety of considerations, which will readily  
fuggeit themselves, urge an attention to this  
meafare of precaution. To give security  
to our principal ports, considerable sums  
bave already been expended, but the works  
remain incomplete. 1t is for Congress to  
determine whether additional appropriations  
ihal] be made in order 10 render competent,  
to the intended purposes the fortifications  
which have been commenced. .  
The manufalture of arms within the U­  
nited States, fill invites the atiention of the  
National Legislature. At a considerable  
expence to the public, this manufallory has  
been brought to such a fiate of maturity, as -  
with continued encoaragement, will fuper­  
cede the necessity of futare importations  
from foreign countries.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
I shall dire@ the eflimates of the appro~  
priations necailary for the ensuing year, to­  
gether with an account of the public rev­  
coue and expenditure, to a like period, to  
be laid before you. ;  
1 oblerve with much faiisfallion that the  
produét of the revenue during the present  
year, bas been more considerable than dar­  
ing any former equal period. The refule  
affords conclusive evidence of the great re­  
sources of this country, and the wisdom and  
efficiency of the measures, which have been  
adopted by Congress for the proteftion of  
commerce and preservation of public credit.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,  
As one of the grand community of Na­  
tions, our -attention is irrefitably drawn to  
the important {cenes which surround us. If  
they have exhibited an uncommon portion  
of calamity, it is the province of humanity  
to&#x27;deplore, and wisdom to avoid, the causes  
which may have produced it. If turning  
our eyes homeward, we find reason to re­  
joice at the profpeét which presents itfelf ;  
if we perceive the interior of our Country  
prosperous, free and happy ; if we enjoy  
in fafety, under the proteétion of Jaws, em­  
anating only from the general will, the  
fruits of our own labour, we ought to fortify  
and cliog to those institutions, which have  
been the source of much real felicity, and  
resist with unabating perseverance the pro.  
grefs of those dangerous innovations, which  
may diminish their influence, -  
To your patriotism, gentlemen, has been  
confided the honorable duty of guarding the  
public intereft,and the while past is to your  
country a sure pledge that it will be_faith­  
fully discharged, permit me to aflure you  
that your*labours to promote the general  
happinefls will receive fiom me the most  
2ealous co-operation. :

Gentlemen of the Sep&amp;e, and  
Gentlemen of the House of Representa-  
tives :  
  
Immediately after the adjournment of  
Congrefs, at their laft felfioa in Philadel-  
phia, I gave directions, in compliance  
with the laws for the removal of the pub-  
lic otiices, rewords and property. Thefe  
directions have been executed and the  
pubiic officers have fince redded, and con-  
ducted the ordinary bufinels of the go-  
vernment in this place.  
  
I congratulate the people of the Uni-  
ted States on the aflembling of congrefs  
at the permanent feat of their govern-  
ment, and I congratulate* you, gentlemen,  
on the profpect of a reiidence not to be  
changed. Although there is caufe to ap-  
prehend that accomodations are not now  
fo complete as might be wiflied, yet there  
is great reafun to believe, that the incon-  
venience will ceafe with the prefent fcf-  
fion.  
  
It would be unbecoming the reprefer.t-  
tives of this nation, to affeinble for the  
firft time in this folemn temple, without  
looking up to the fupreme ruler •£ the  
univerfe, and imploring his blefling. May  
this territory be the re-lidence of virtue  
and happinefs. In this city may that pi-  
ety and virtue, that wifdom and magna-  
nimity, that conftancy and felt govern-  
ment, which adorned the character, whofe  
name it bears, be forever held in venera-  
tion. Here and throughout our country  
may Ample manners, pure morals and  
true religion flourifh forever.  
  
It is with you, gentlemen, to confider  
whether the local powers over the dif-  
trict of Columbia, vefted by the .confti-  
tution in the congrefs of the United  
States, lhall be immediately exercifed.  
If in your opinion this important truft  
ought now to be executed, you cannot  
Jail, while performing it, to take into  
view the future probable fituation of the  
territory, for the happinefs of which you  
are about to provide. You will confider  
it as the capital of a great nation, advan-  
cing with unexampled rapidity in arts,  
in commerce, in wealth, and in popula-  
tion, and poffeffing within itfelf thof:  
energies and refoUrces, which, if not  
thrown away or lamentably mifdi retted,  
fecure to it a long courfe of profperity  
and felf-government.  
  
lis compliance with a law of the laft  
feflion of congrefs, the officers and fol*  
diers of the temporary army have been  
discharged. It affords real pleafure to  
recollect the honorable teftimony they  
gave of the patriotic motives, which  
brought them into the fervice of their  
country, by the readinefs and regularity  
with which they returned to the ftation  
of private citizens.  
  
It is in every point of view of fuch  
primary importance, to carry the laws  
into prompt and faithful execution, and  
to render that part of the adminiftvation  
of juftice, which the conftitution and  
laws devolve on the Federal courts, as  
convenient to the people, as may confift  
with their prefent circumftance3^ that I  
cannot omit once more to recommend to  
your ferious confideration the judiciary  
i&#x27;yftera of the United ftates. No fabjeCt  
is more intercfting than this to the public  
happineft, and to none can thofe improve-  
ments, which may have been fug^efted  
by experience, be more beneficially ap-  
plied.  
  
A treaty of amity and commerce witk  
the king of Prufua has been concluded  
  
and rati tied. J he ratifications have been  
exchanged, and I bare directed the trea-  
ty to Lc promulgated hy proclamation.  
  
The difficulties, which fufpended the  
eiet- ition of the 6th article of the trea-  
ty of amity, commerce and navigation  
with Great Britain, have not yet been  
removed. i tie negotiation on this i&#x27;ub  
jec&quot;t is itiil depending. As it mull be for  
the intereft and honor of both nations  
to adjulc this difference with good fait!&#x27;,  
I indulge confidently the expectation,  
that the fin cere endeavors of the govern-  
ment of the United States to bring it to  
an amicabl* termination, will not be dil-  
appciinted.  
  
The envoys extraordinary, and minif-  
ters plenipotentiary from the United  
States to France were received by thti  
firft conful with the refpeft dne to their  
character, and three peri&#x27;ons with equal  
powers were appointed to treat witii  
4hem. Althou^&#x27;ii at -the date of the lalt  
©fecial intelii v ,.;.e, the negotiation had  
not terminated, yet it is to be hoped that  
our efforts tn effeci an accomodation will  
W length meet with a fucce Is proportioned  
tb the* fincerity with which they have  
been fo often repeated&quot;.  
  
While our bed endeavours for the pre-  
servation of harmony with all nations,  
will continue to be u&#x27;lsd, the experience  
of the world, our own experience admo-  
nifh us of the in fecurity of nulling too  
confidently to their l&#x27;uccel&#x27;s. W e can-  
not without cotantfttKig » dangerous im-  
prudence, abandon thoje me;ii&#x27;ures of felf  
prote&amp;ion whtch are adapted to our :itu-  
ation, and to wh&#x27;;ch,&#x27;notwithiiandr.ig our  
jfacific policy, the violence and injullice  
of others may a?;aiu compel us to rclort.  
&quot;While our vail extent of tea coaft, the  
commercial and agricultural habits of  
our people, the great capital they will  
continue to truft on the ocean, luggeft  
the fyftett of defence, which will be moil  
beneficial to o&amp;rfelves, our diftance frqju  
Europe and our refources of maritime  
ftrength will enable us to einply it with  
efTec!. Seasonable and fyfteroatic ar-  
rangements, fo f&#x27;.r -is cur resources will  
jtfftifyi for a Navy adapted to defetfftve  
Wai&quot;, and which may, i» cafe of nece&#x27;.fity,  
le quickly brought into ufe, feein to be  
as much recommended by a wife and true  
oeconomy,as by ;&gt; juft regard for our future  
tranquility, for the laiety of our lho.es,  
and for the protection of our property,  
committed to the ocean.  
  
Theprefent navy of the United States  
called fuddenly into exigence, by a great  
national exigency, has railed us in ouv  
own efteem, and by the protection afl  
dtd to our cominerce,has effe&amp;ed, t &gt; tht  
extent of our expectations, the objects  
for which it was created.  
  
In connection with a navy, ought to be  
eontem.il.ted the fortification of lb me ol  
6uf principal feaports and harbours. A  
variety oi c moderations which will rea-  
dily fuggefl thcinfelves, urge an attention  
to this&quot; meafure of precaution. To give  
fecurity to our principal ports, confidira-  
ble fums have already been expended ;  
but the works remain incomplete. It is  
for C&#x27;.ongrefs to determine whether addi-  
tional appropriations (hall be made, in or-  
der to render competent to the intended  
purpofes the fortifications which have  
been commenced.  
  
The manufacture of arms within the  
United States dill invites the attention  
of the national legirtature. At a confi-  
derablc expenfc to the public, this manu-  
factory has been brought to fuch a ftate  
of maturity, as, with continued encou-  
ragement, will fupercede the neceffity of  
future importations from foreign coun-  
tries.  
  
Gentlemen of the House of  
Representatives,  
  
I fliall direct the efti mates of the ap-  
propriations necelTary for the enfuing  
year, together with an account of the  
public revenue and expenditures, to a  
late period, to be laid before vou. I ob-  
ferve with much fatisfaction, that the  
p.ioducl of the revenue, during the pre-  
fent year, has been more coniiderable,  
than during any former equal period.  
This refult affords coiiclufive evidence of  
the great refources of this country, and  
of the wifdom and efficiency of the m ia-  
  
res yrhich h&gt;;ve been adopted bv con-  
grefs, for the protection of commerce,  
and paefervation of public credit.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Gentlemen of the House of  
Representatives,  
  
As one of the grand community of na-  
tions, our attention is irre&#x27;dablv drawn to  
the important fcenes wdich furro.md us.  
If they have exhibited a,7 uncommon  
portion of calamity, it is the produce of  
humanity to deplore, and of wifdom to  
  
nroteclion of laws emanating only from  
the general will, the fruits of their own  
labor, we ought to fortify and cling to  
thofe inftitutions which have been the  
fource of filch real felicity, and refill with  
nnabating perfeverance, the progrefs of  
thole dangerous innovations, which may  
diminifl] their influence.  
  
To your patriotifm, gentlemen, has  
been confided the honorable duty of  
guarding the public interells, and while  
the pad is to your country a lure pledge  
that it will be faithfully difeharged, per-  
mit me to allure ycu, that your labors to  
promote the general happinels, will re-  
ceive from me the mod zealous co-ope-

Gentlemen of the Senate, and

date of the last official intelligence the negociation had not termi-  
nated, yet it is to be hoped that our efforts to effect an ace omo-  
dation, will at length meet with a success proportioned to the sin-  
eerity with which 1 they have been so often repeated.  
  
While our best endeavours for the preservation of h: ermony  
with all nations will continue to be used, the experience of the  
world and our own experience admonish us of the insecurity of  
trusting too confidently to their success. We cannot, without  
committing a dangerous imprudence, abandon those measures of  
self- protection which ate adapted to our situation, and to which:  
notwithstanding our pacific policy, the violence and injustice of  
others miay compel us to resort. While our vast extent of sca-  
coast, the commercial and agricultural habits of ovr people, the  
great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean, suggest tthe  
system of defence which will be most beneficial to ours elves, our  
distance fi rom Europe and our resources for maritime strength,  
will enable us to employ it with effect. Seasonable and system-  
atic arrafigemenits, so far as our resources will justify, for a Navy  
adapted to defensive war, and which may, in case of necessity, be  
quick ly bronght into use, seem to be as much recomm: ended ‘by a  
wise and true ceconomy as by a just regard for our future tran-  
quility, for the safety of our shores, and for the protection of our  
property committed to the ocean.  
  
The present Navy of the United States, called suddenly inep  
existence, by a great “national exigency, has raised us in our own  
esteem ; and by the protection afforded to our commerce, has ef  
fected, to the extent of our expectations, the objcets for which it  
was created  
  
In connection with a navy ought to be contemplated the forti-  
fication of some of our peititiple “sea-ports and harbours. A yari-  
  
ety of considerations, which will readily suggest them selves, urge  
an attention to this mcasure of precaution. To give security to  
our principle ports, considerable sums have already been e Kpe! end-  
  
ed, but the works remain incomplete. It is for Congress to de-  
termine whether additional appropriations shall be mace, in or-  
der to render competent to the intended purposes the fortifications  
which liave been commenced.  
  
‘I&#x27;he manufacture of arms within the United States still invite 3  
the attention of the national legislature : At a considerable e

© Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gen-  
tlemen of the Houfe of Reprefenta-  
tives,  
  
¢ Immediately after the adjournment of  
congrefs, at their laft feffion in Philadelphia,  
I gave direétions, in compliance with the  
laws, for the removal cf the public offices,  
records, and property. Thefe direétions  
have been executed, and the public officers  
have fince refided and conduéted the ordi-  
nary bufineis of the government in this  
place. .  
  
‘ IT congratulate the people of the United  
States on the aflembling of congrefs at the  
permanent feat of their government, and I  
congratulate you, gentlemen, on the prof-  
pect of a refidence not to be changed. Al-  
though there is caule to apprehend that ac-  
commodations are not now {0 complete as  
might be withed, yet there is great reafon  
to believe that this inconvenience will ceafe  
with the prefent feffion.  
  
* It would be unbecoming the reptefen-  
tatives of this nation to aficmble, for the  
firit time, in this folemn temple, without  
looking up tothe fupreme Ruler of the  
Univerle, and imploring his blefling. May  
this territory be the refide:ce of virtue and  
happinefs. In this city may that piety and  
virtue, that wifdom and magnanimity, that  
conitancy and felf government, which  
adorned the great charater whofe name it  
bears, be for ever held in veneration.  
Here, and throughout our country, may  
fimple manners, pure movals, and true re-  
ligion, flourifh for ever.  
  
‘It is with you, gentlemen, to confider  
whither the local powers over the diltrift: of  
Columbia, vefted by the conttitution in the  
congrefs of the United States, fhall be im-  
mediately exercifed. If in your opinion this  
important truft ought now to be executed,  
you cannot fail, while performing it, to  
take into view the future probable fitua-  
tion of the territory, for the happinefs of  
which you are about to provide. You will  
confider it as the capital of a great nation,  
advancing with unexampled rapidity in  
arts, in commerce, in wealth, and in popu-  
lation ; and poffefling within itfelf thoie  
energies and refources, which, if not thrown  
away, or lamentab!y mifdireéted, fecure to  
  
it along courfe of profperity and felf- go-  
vernment.  
  
‘In compliance with a law of the lait  
feflion of congrels, the officers and foldiers  
of the temporary army have been difcharg-  
ed. It affords real pieafure to recolleét the  
honourable teftimony they gaveof the pa-  
triotic motives which brought them into the  
fervice of their country, by the readineis  
and regularity with which they returned to  
the ftation of private citizens.  
  
‘Itis, in every point of view, of. fuch  
primary importance to carry the laws into  
prompt and faithful execution, and to ren-  
der that part of the acdminiftration of ju  
tice, which the conftitution and laws de-  
volve on the federal courts, as convenient  
to the people, as may confitt with their pre-  
fent circumftances, that I cannot omit once  
more to recommend to your ferious confi-  
deretion the judiciary fyitem of the United  
States. No fubjeét is more interefting  
than this to the public happinefs, and to  
none can thofe improvements, which may  
have been fuggeiled by experience, be more  
beneficia!ly applied,  
  
* A treaty of amity and commerce with  
the king of Pruffia has been concluded and  
ratified. The ratifications have been ex-  
changed, and I have dire&amp;ted the treaty to  
be promuigated by proclamation.  
  
* The ditiiculties which fufpended the ex-  
cution of the 6th atticle of our treaty of  
amity, commerce, and navigation with  
Great Britain, have not yet been re-  
moved. The negociation on this fubject  
is ftilidepending. sds it muft be for the  
intereft and honour of both nations to ad-  
jut this difference with good faith, [ in-  
dulge confidently the expectution, that the  
fincere endeavours of the government of the  
United States to bring it to an amicable  
termination, will not be difappointed.  
  
€ The envoys extraordinary, and mini-  
fters plenipotentiary from the United  
States to France, were received by the firft  
conful with the refpect due to their charac-  
ter, and three perfons with equal powers  
were appointed to treat with them. Al-  
though at the date of the laft official intel-  
ligence the regociation had not terminated,  
yet it is to be hoped, that our efforts to ef-  
fect an accommodation will at length meet  
with a fucce!s proportioned to the fincerity

apted to defensive war, and which may, in case of necessity,

of which you are about to provide. You will
