I greatly approve the epithet, which you give in your letter of the 8th of June,  to the new method of treating the small-pox, which you call the tonic or bracing method. I will take occasion from it, to mention a practice to which I have accustomed myself. You know the cold bath has long been in vogue here as a tonic; but the shock of the cold water has always appeared to me, generally speaking, as too violent: and I have found it much more agreeable to my constitution, to bathe in another element, I mean cold air. With this view I rise early almost every morning, and sit in my chamber, without any clothes whatever, half an hour or an hour, according to the season, either reading or writing. This practice is not in the least painful, but on the contrary, agreeable; and if I return to bed afterwards, before I dress myself, as sometimes happens, I make a supplement to my night’s rest, of one or two hours of the most pleasing sleep that can be imagined. I find no ill consequences whatever resulting from it, and that at least it does not injure my health, if it does not in fact contribute much to its preservation. I shall therefore call it for the future a bracing or tonic bath.

&#x27;I greatly approve your new method  
of treating small-pox. which you call  
the tonic or bracing method. I will  
take occasion from it to mention a  
) practice to which I have accustomed  
myself Vou know the cold bath has  
long been in vogue here as a tonic,  
but the shock of tfye cold water hai  
always appeared to me as too violent,  
and I hare found it much more agree­  
able to my constitution to bathe in  
another element I mean cold air.  
With this view I rise almost every  
morning and sit in my chamber with­  
out any clothes whatever, half an  
hour or an hour, according to the sea­  
son. either reading or writing. The  
practice is not in the least painful,  
but. on the contrary, quite agreeable;  
and if I return to bed afterward, be-  
fore I dress myself, as I sometimes  
do. I make a supplement to mv  
night&#x27;s rest of one or two hours of the  
most pleasing sleep that can be imag-  
lnea. una no in consequences  
whatever resulting from it. and that at  
least it does not injure ray health, if  
it does not, in fact, contribute much  
t-;  
to its preservation.
