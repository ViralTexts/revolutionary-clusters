le code, common to the whole kingdom, by  
him first reduced into one, was probably the birth of what is called the Common  
law. he has been styled ‘magnus juris anglicani Conditor,’ and his code the , or doom book. that which was  
made afterwards under  
Edward the  
Confessor was but a restoration of  
Alfred’s  
with some intervening alterations. and this was the code which the English so  
often, under the Norman princes, petitioned to have restored to them.but, all  
			 records previous to the Magna charta, having  
been early lost, Bracton’s is the first digest of the whole body  
of law, which has come down to us entire. what materials  
for it existed in his time we know not, except the unauthoritative collections  
by Lambard &amp;  
Wilkins,  
and the treatise of  
Glanville,  
tempore  
H. 2. Bracton’s is the  
more valuable, because being written a very few  
years after the Magna charta, which  
commences what is called the Statute law, it  
gives us the state of the Common law in it’s ultimate form, and exactly at the  
point of division between the Common and Statute law. it is a most able work,  
complete in it’s matter, and luminous in it’s method.2. the statutes which introduced changes began now to be  
preserved, applications of the law to new cases by the  
courts began soon after to be reported in the Year books, these to be  
methodised and abridged by  
Fitzherbert,  
Brooke  
Rolle and perhaps  
by others, individuals continued the business of reporting, particular  
treatises were written by able men, and all these, by the time of  
Ld Coke, had formed so  
large a mass of matter as to call for a new digest, to bring it within  
reasonable compass. this he undertook in his institutes, harmonising all the  
decisions and opinions which were reconcilable, and rejecting those not so.  
this work is executed with so much learning and judgment that I do not  
recollect that a single position in it has ever been judicially denied. and  
altho’ the work loses much of it’s value by it’s chaotic form, it may still be  
considered as the fundamental code of the English law.  
3. The same processes recommencing, of  
Statutory changes, new decisions, decisions, multiplied Reports, and special  
treatises, a new accumulation had formed, calling for new reduction, by the  
time of Matthew  
Bacon. his work therefore, altho’ not pretending to the textual merit  
of Bracton’s or  
Coke’s,  
was very acceptable. his Alphabetical arrangement indeed, altho’ better than  
Coke’s  
jumble, was far inferior to  
Bracton’s. but it was a sound digest of the  
materials existing on the several alphabetical heads under which he arranged  
them. his work was not admitted as authority in  
Westminster hall;  
yet it was the Manual of every judge and lawyer, and, what better proves  
it’s  
merit worth, has been  
it’s daily growth in the general estimation.

ry, as to derive much advantage from  
a perusal of the original work.  
  
The laws of England in their pro-  
gress from the earliest to the present  
times are like the road of a traveller,  
divided into distinct stages or resting  
places, at each of which a review is  
taken of the road passed over. ‘The  
first of these was Bracton’s Treatise  
de legibus, &amp;c.; the second, Coke’s In-  
stitutes; the third Matthew Bacon’s  
Abridgment of the laws, and the  
fuurth Blackstone’s Commentaries.  
Doubtless there were others before  
Bracton which have not reached us.  
The Dombec is said to have been com-  
piled of the laws of Ina, Offa, and  
Ethelbert, and was probably the birth of  
what is called the common law, that  
is to say, the Dombec, as originally  
formed by Alfred, for that which was  
inade afterwards by Edward the con-  
fessor, was but a restoration of Al-  
fred’s compilation. ‘This with some  
alterations was the code which the En-  
glish during the reigns of the Norman  
princes so often petitioned to have  
restored to them; but all records pre-  
vious to the Megna Charta being lost,  
Bracton’s is the first digest of the  
whole body of the law which has come  
down to us entire; what materials ex-  
isted for it at his time we do not pre-  
cisely know; there were however, col-  
lections by Lambard and Wilkins,  
and the well known treatise of Glan-  
ville. It is the more valuable because,  
being written a few years after the  
Magna Charta, which commences  
what is called the statute law, it gives  
us the common law inits ultimate form,  
and precisely at the point of division  
between the common and statute law.  
  
he statutes which introduced chang-  
es began now to be preserved; appli-  
cations of the law to new cases by the  
courts began soon after to be reported  
in the ‘ year books,’ these to be me-  
thodised and abridged by Fitzherbert,  
Rolle, Broke, &amp;c., individuals conti-  
nued the business of reporting; and  
particular treatises were written on  
various subjects. All these by the  
time of lord Coke, had formed so vast  
an accumulation as to call for a new  
digest in order to bring the mass with-  
in areasonable compass. This he un-  
dertook, and performed in his Insti-  
tutes, harmonising all the decisions  
and opinions that were reconcileable,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
and rejecting such as were not so.  
This work was executed with so much  
learning and judgment, that not a  
single position in it, as far as we are  
aware, has ever been judicially de-  
nied, and certainly it may be consi-  
dered as the fundamental code of the  
English law.  
  
The same process continuing of  
statutory changes, new decisions, mul-  
tiplied reports, and special treatises,  
a new accumulation had formed call-  
ing for new reduction, by the time of  
sir Matthew Bacon. His work there-  
fore was very acceptable, although not  
pretending to the precision of Coke’s  
or Bracton’s. It was not at first, ad-  
mitted as authority in Westminster  
Hall, but became the manual of every  
judge and every lawyer, and has con-  
tinued constantly to grow in public  
estimation.  
  
A succeeding interval of changes  
and additions produced the occasion  
for Blackstone’s Commentaries, a  
work perfectly unrivalled, in its kind,  
for lucid arrangement and classi

&#x27;Everything predated by the  
  
enemies of banks in the beir&#x27;nining  
  
is now coining to pass. We are  
to be ruined now by the deluge of  
bank paper, as we were formerly  
by the old Continental paper. It  
is cruel that such revelations in  
private fortunes should be at the  
nieicy of avaricious adventurers,  
who, instead of employing their  
capital, if any they have, in man­  
ufactures, commerce, or other  
useful pursuits, makes it an in­  
strument to burden all ihe inter-  
  
changers of property with their  
  
swindling prolits profits which  
  
are the price of Houseful industry  
  
of theirs. I am an enemy to all

for anything but coin.&quot; Letter
