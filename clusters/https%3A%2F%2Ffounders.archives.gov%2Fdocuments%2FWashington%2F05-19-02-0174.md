United States 8th of December 1795.  
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, &amp; House of Representatives,  
  
I trust I do not deceive myself, while I indulge the persuasion, that I have never met you at any period, when, more than at the present, the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all good, for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy.  
The termination of the long, expensive and distressing war, in which we have been engaged with certain Indians Northwest of the Ohio, is placed in the option of the United States, by a Treaty which the Commander of our army has concluded, provisionally, with the hostile tribes in that region. In the adjustment of the terms, the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed an object worthy no less of the policy, than of the liberality of the United States, as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity. This object, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon, wil immediately be laid before the Senate, for their consideration.  
The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontier, have lately confirmed their pre-existing treaties with us; and were giving evidence of a  
  
sincere disposition to carry them into effect, by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken: But we have to lament, that the fair prospect in this quarter, has been once more clouded by wanton murders, which some Citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks; which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger; which will be productive of further expense, and may occasion more effusion of blood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages; and with the hope of their succeeding—at least to avert general hostility.  
A Letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty, made with his father the late Emperor; and consequently, the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add, that information has been received from an Agent deputed on our part to Algiers, importing that the terms of a treaty with the Dey and Regency of that Country, had been adjusted in such a manner, as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace, and the restoration of our unfortunate fellow-citizens from a grievous captivity.  
The latest advices from our Envoy at the Court of Madrid, give moreover, the pleasing information, that he had received assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event, depending upon unadjusted particulars, cannot be regarded as ascertained, it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which, securing amicably very essential interests of the United States, will at the same time, lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power, whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate.  
Though not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives, you, Gentlemen, all are apprized, that a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation has been negotiated with Great Britain; and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification, upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest, after full and mature deliberation, I have added my sanction. The result on the part of his britannic majesty is unknown. When received, the subject will, without delay, be placed before Congress.  
This interesting summary of our affairs, with regard to the  
  
foreign powers, between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted; and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbours with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding, opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every side, the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord, which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible with our national rights and honour, shall be the happy result—how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating, maturing and establishing the prosperity of our Country!  
Contemplating the internal situation, as well as the external relations of the United States, we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American dependencies, have been involved in a contest unusually bloody, exhausting and calamitous; in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay; in which scarcity of subsistence has embittered other sufferings: while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose, are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens, which press upon all the departments of industry, and threaten to clog the future springs of Government: our favored Country, happy in a striking contrast, has enjoyed general tranquillity—a tranquillity the more satisfactory, because maintained at the expense of no duty. Faithful to ourselves, we have violated no obligation to others. Our agriculture, commerce and manufactures prosper beyond former example; the molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however, very pointed remonstrances have been made) being over-balanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our population advances with a celerity, which, exceeding the most sanguine calculations, proportionally augments our strength and resources, and guarantees our future security. Every part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement, and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived; with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies; with Governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and wholesome Laws; is it too much to  
  
say, that our Country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed, if ever before equalled?  
Placed in a situation every way so auspicious, motives of commanding force impel us, with sincere acknowledgement to Heaven, and pure love to our Country, to unite our efforts to preserve, prolong and improve our immense advantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work, is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart.  
It is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare, that the part of our Country, which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection, now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order—The misled have abandoned their errors, and pay the respect to our Constitution and Laws, which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the Society. These circumstances have induced me to pardon, generally, the offenders here referred to; and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty, to exercise with firmness and energy the Constitutional powers with which I am vested; yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good, than it is with my personal feelings, to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness, which the national justice, dignity and safety may permit.  
Gentlemen  
Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session, a review of our military establishment is not the least important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be expected still further to change the relative situation of our frontiers. In this review, you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations, that the questions between us and certain foreign powers, are not yet finally adjusted; that the war in Europe is not yet terminated; and that our western posts, when recovered, will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present military force, will be laid before you by the Department of War.  
With the review of our army establishment, is naturally connected that of the Militia: It will merit enquiry, what imperfections in the existing plan, further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment, in my estimation, as to  
  
excite a constant solicitude, that the consideration of it may be renewed ’till the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object, while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils.  
While we indulge the satisfaction, which the actual condition of our western borders so well authorizes; it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth, which continually receives new confirmations—namely, that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier Inhabitants, are insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity. And it can need no argument to prove, that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained, by bringing the murderers to condign punishment, all the exertions of the government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians, will prove fruitless, and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, must continue to shock humanity; and an enormous expense, to drain the Treasury of the Union.  
To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice, it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering Justice to them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress; and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians, on reasonable terms (a measure, the mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferences with them, they urge it with solicitude) I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure, that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made, under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this work, if practicable, will reflect undecaying lustre on our national character, and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
The state of our Revenue, with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed, pursuant to different Acts of Congress,  
  
will be submitted from the proper Department; together with an Estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year.  
Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision for the redemption of the public debt, will naturally engage your examination. Congress have demonstrated their sense to be, and it were superfluous to repeat mine, that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt, accords as much with the true interest of our Country, as with the general sense of our constituents.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Representatives.  
The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint, will shew the situation of that Institution; and the necessity of some further Legislative provisions, for carrying the business of it more completely into effect; and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters.  
The progress in providing materials for the Frigates, and in building them; the state of the fortifications of our harbours; the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals, and for replenishing our magazines with military stores; and the steps which have been taken towards the execution of the Law for opening a trade with the Indians; will likewise be presented for the information of Congress.  
Temperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the Session; and mutual forbearance, where there is a difference of opinion, are too obvious and necessary for the peace, happiness and welfare of our Country, to need any recommendation of mine.  
  
Go: Washington

a {peedy and fatisfatory conclufion of his meégociation. ‘While the

Gentlemen,  
  
Among the objeéts which will elaini your attention in the courfe of  
the feffion, a review of our militarv eftablifhment is not the leaft im-  
portant. It iscalled for by the events which have Changed, and maybe  
expected ftill further to change the relative fituation of our fro#tiers.  
In this review, you will doubtlefs allow due weight to the corfidera-  
tions, that the queftions between us and certain foreign powers gfe  
‘not yet finally adjufted:—T hat the war in Europe is -not yet termiiat-  
ed; and that our weftern pofts, when recovered, will demand provi-  
fion for garrifoning and fecuring them. A ftatement of our prefeat  
amnilitary force ‘will be laid before you by the department of war.  
  
With the review of our army eftablifhment, is oir Oe  
‘that of the militia. Tt will merit inquiry, what imperfections in ‘the  
exifting plan farther experience may have unfolded. The fubjeét is  
of fo much moment, in my eftimation, as to excite a ¢onftant&#x27;foliei-  
tude, that&#x27;the ‘corifideration ‘of it miay be renewed until the greateft at-  
tainable perfection fhall be accomplifhed. Time is wearing away  
fome advantages for forwarding the object, while none better deferves  
the perfeveéring attention of the public councils.” _  
  
While we indulge the fatisfaétion, which the a€tual condition of  
out weftern borders fo well authorifes; it is neceflary that we fhould  
not lofe fight of an important truth, which continually receives new  
confinglations, ‘nantely, that the provifiois heretofore ‘made ae

view to the protedtion of the Indians from the violence of the lawle&amp;  
of our froutier inhabitants, are infufficient. It is demonftrated  
that thefe violences can now be-perpetrated with impunity. And it  
van need no argument to prove, that unlefs the murdering of Indians  
can be reftrained, by bringing the murderers to condign punifhment,  
all the exertions of the government to prevent deftructive retaliations  
by the Indians, will prove fruitlefs, and all our prefent agreeable prof-  
pects delufory. ‘The frequent deftruction of innocent women and  
children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, muft continue to  
fhock humanity; and an enormous expence to drain the treaiury of  
the Union.  
  
To enforce upoa the Indians the ebfervance of juftice, it is indif-  
penfible that there thall be competent means of rendering juftice to  
them, If thefe means can be devifed by the wifdom of Congrefs, and  
efpecially if there can be added an adequate provifion for {upplying  
the neoefities of the Indians, on reafonable terms (a meafure, the  
mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferences  
with them, they arge it with folicitude) I fhould not hefitate to enter-  
tain.a ftrong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add  
with pleafure, that the probability even of their civilization is not di-  
minifhed by the experiments which have been thus far made under the  
aufpices of goveryment. The accomplifhment of this work, if prac-  
ticable, will refie&amp;t undecaying luftre on our national charaéter, and  
ee the moft grateful confolations that virtuous minds can

Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
The ftate of our revenue, with the fums&#x27;that have been borrowed  
and reimburfed, purfuant to different acts of Congrefs, will be fub-  
mitted from the proper departments; together with an eftimate of the  
  
‘appropriations neceflary to be made for the fervice of the enfuing year.  
  
Whether meafures may not be advifeable to reinforce the provifion  
for the redemption of the public debt, will naturally engage your ex-  
amination—Congrefs have demonttrated their fenfe to be, and it were  
fuperfluous to repeat mine, that whatfoever will tend to accelerate the  
honourable extinétion of our public debt, accords as much with the  
true interefts of our country, as with the general fenfe of our con-  
ftituents. )  
  
_ | Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
The ftatements which will be laid before you, relative to the Mint,  
will thew the fituation of that inftitution, and the neceffity of fome  
further legiflative provifions for carrying the bufinefs of it more com-  
pletely into effect, and for checking abufes which appear to be arifing  
in tages quarters.  
  
e progrefs in providing materials for the frigates, and.in building  
them; the {tate of the fortifications of our harbours; the meafures  
which have been purfued for obtaining proper fcites for arfenals, and  
for replenithirg our magazines with military ftores; and the fteps  
which have been taken towards the execution of the law for opening  
a trade with the Indiang, will likewife be prefented for the information

#### 1795-12-22 &middot; [Portsmouth [N.H.]](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portsmouth%2C_New_Hampshire)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Fellow-citizens of the Senate, and  
‘ House of Representatives,  
| I Trust I do not deceive myfelf, while I in­  
- 4 dulge the persuasion, that I have never met  
&#x27;you at any period, when, more than at the pre­  
sent, the situation of our public affairs has af­  
forded just caule for mutual congratulation, and  
.for inviting you to join with me in profound  
-grantude to the Author of all Good, for the  
numerous and extraordinary bleflings we enjoy.  
¥ The termination of the long, expensive ‘and  
‘diftrefling war, in which we have been en aged  
with certain Indians Nogth Weft of the Chio,  
is placed in the option of the United States, by  
a treaty which the Commander of our Army  
has concluded provisionally, with the hoflile  
tribes in that region.  
In the adjuilment of the terms, the fatisfac­  
tion of the Indians was deemed an obje&amp; worthy  
no less of the policy, than of the liberality of  
the United States, as the neceflary basis of du­  
rable tranquility. This objeft, it is believed,  
has been fully attained. The articles agreed  
upodt, will immediately be laid before the Sen­  
ate, for their consideration.  
~ The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone  
-of the Southern tribes had annoyed our fron­  
tiers, have lately confirmed their pre-exifting  
treaties with us ; and were giving evidence of a  
sincere disposition to carry t%cm mnto cffeét, by  
the surrender of the prisoners and property they  
had taken :—But we have to lament, that the  
fair profpe&amp;t m this quarter, has been once  
more clouded by wanton murders, which some  
citizens of Georgia are represented to have re­  
cently perpetrated on hunting parties of the  
Creeks ; which have again fubjefted that fron.  
tier to disquietude and danger ; which will be  
&#x27; produtive of future expence, and may occasion  
more effufion of blood. Measures are pursuing  
“to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences  
of such outrages ; and with the hope of their  
succeeding, at least to avert general hoflility.  
A letter from the Emperor of Morocco an­  
nounces to me his recognition of our treaty,  
made with*his father the late Emiperor ; and  
consequently, the continuance o &#x27;e{xcacc with  
that power. With peculiar fatisfaltion 1 add,  
that information has gccn received from an A­  
gent deputed on our part, to Algiers, importing  
that the terms of a treaty with the Dey and  
Regency of that country had been adjusted in  
{ueh a manner, as to authorize the expetation  
of a speedy peace, and the restoration of our un­  
fortunate Fellow-Citizens from a grievous cap­  
tivity. ey .  
  
The latest advices from cur enmvoy at the  
Court of Madrid, give moreover, the pleasing  
information that he had received aflurances of a  
{pcedy and fatisfaétory conclusion of his ncgoci­  
ation. &#x27;While the event depending upon unad­  
justed particulars, cannot be regarded as ascer­  
tained, it is agreeable to cherish the expe&amp;tation  
of an issue which, securing amicably very essen­  
tial interests o the Uoited States, will at the  
fame time, lay the foundation of lasting harmo­  
ny with a power whose friendfhip we have uni­  
formly and sincerely desired to culiivate.  
Though not before officially disclosed to the  
House of Representatives, you, gentlemen, are  
all apprized, that a treaty of Amity, Commerce  
and Navigation, bas been negociated with  
Great-Britain ; and that the Senate have advised  
and consented to its ratification, upon a condi­  
tion which excepts part of one article. Agree­  
ably thereto, and to the be#t judgment I was  
able to form of the public interest after full and  
mature dehiberation 1 have added my fantion.  
The result on the part of his Britannic Majesty  
1s unknown. When received, the fubje&amp; will  
without delay, be placed before Congress.  
This interesting summary of our affairs, with  
regard to the foreign pewers, between whom  
and the United States controversies have subsist­  
ed ; and with regard also to those of our In­  
dian neighbours with whom we have beenina  
state of enmity or misunderstanding, opens a  
wide ficld for consoling and gratifying reflec­  
tions.—lf by prudence and moderation on every  
fide, the exunguifhment of all the causes of ex­  
ternal discord, which have heretofore menaced  
our tranquility, on terms compatable with our  
national rights and honor, shall be the bappy  
result—how firm and how precious a founda­  
tion will have been laid for accelerating, ma­  
turing and eflablifhing the prosperity of our  
country !  
Contemplating the internal situation, as well  
as the external relations of the United States,  
we discover equal cause for contentment and  
fatisfaltion. While many of the nations of  
Europe, with their American dependeneics,  
have been involved in a contest unuFutaHy bloo­  
dy, exhausting and calamitous ; in which the  
evils of foreign war have been aggravated by  
domestic convulsions and infurre&amp;tion ; in which  
many of the arts most ufeful to society have been  
exposed to di{couragement and decay ; in which  
scarcity of subsistence has embittered other fuffer­  
  
ings, while even the anticipatioss of a return of  
the bleflings of peace and repose, are alloyed by  
the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens,  
which press upon all the departments of in­  
dultry, and threaten to clog the future springs  
of government :—our favoured country, happy  
in a finking contrast, has enjuved general tran­  
quility---a tranquility the more fatsfattory, be­  
caule maintained at the expenle of no duty.  
Faithful to ourielves, we have violated no oblia  
gationt to others. Our agriculture, commerce  
and manufaltures prosper beyond former exam­  
ple ; the molestations of our trade (to prevent  
a continuance of which, however, very pointed  
remonitrances have been made) being over ba­  
lanced by the aggregate benefiss which it de­  
rives from a neutral position. Our population  
advances with a celenity which, exceeding the  
moit {anguine calculations, proportionally aug­  
ments our ftrengith and resources, and guarantees  
our future {ecurity. Every part of the union  
displays indications of rapid and various im­  
provement, and with burthens so light as {carce­  
ly to be perceived ; with relourees fully ade­  
quate to our present exigencies ; with govern.  
ments founded on the genuine principles of ra­  
tional liberty, and with mild and wholelome  
laws ; 15 1t too much to fay, that our country  
exhibits a {peétacle of national happinels never  
furpafled, if ever before equalled ?  
Placed in a situation every way {6 auspicious,  
motives of commanding force impel us, with sin­  
cere acknowledgment to Heaven, and pure love  
to our country, to unite our efforts to preserve,  
prolong and improve, our immense advantages.  
To co-operate with you m this desirable work,  
15 a fervent and favourite wish of my heart.  
It 1s a valuable ingredient, in the general ef­  
tiraate of our welfare, that the part of our coun­  
try, which lately was the scene of disorder &amp;  
nfurrettion, now enjoy the blessings of quiet  
and order. The misled have abavdoned their  
errors, and pay the reflpeft to our conftitutior  
and laws which is due from good citizens to  
the public authorities of the society. Thefa  
circum{tances have induced me to pardon, ge­  
nerally, the offenders here referred to ; and to  
extend forgivenels to those who “had been ad­  
judged to .capital punifiment.—Feor though 1  
shall always think 1t a sacred duty, to exercise  
with firmnels and energy the constitutional pow­  
ers with which I am vefled ; yet it appear§ to  
me ne less consistent with the public good, than  
it 1s with iy personal feelings, to mingle in the  
operations of government cvery degree of mo­  
deration and tenderness which the national Juls  
uce, dignity and fufety iay permir,  
Gentlemen, ;  
Among the objefts which will claim your at­  
tention in the course of the feflion, a review of  
our military cltablithbment is not the least jm­  
portant.—lt is called for by the events which  
have changed, and may be expeéted still further  
to change the relative situation of our frontiers.  
In this review, you will doubrlefs allow due  
weight to the considerations, that the questions  
between us and certain foreign powers, are not  
yet finaily adjufled ; that the war in Europe is  
not yet terminated ; and that our Weflern  
Posts, when recovered, will demand provisions  
for garrisoning and securing them. A flare.  
ment of our present military force will be laid  
before you by the department of war.  
With the review of cur army establishment is  
naturally conncéted that of the militia. It wil}  
merit inquiry, what imperfeflions in the exili­  
ing plan, further expenence may have unfold­  
cd.—The fubjells is of so much moment in my  
estimation, as to excite a conflant solicitude,  
that the conlideration of it may be renewed, til}  
the greatelt attainable perfeftion shall be ac­  
complished. Time is wearing away some ad­  
vantages for forwarding the objeér, while none  
better deserves the perlevesing attention of the  
public couneils.  
While we indulge the fatisfaGtion, which the  
aftual condition of our Wedlern borders so well  
authorizes, it is neceflary that we should not lose  
fight of an important truth, which continually  
receives new confumations—namely, that the  
proviftons heretofore made with a view to the  
proteétion of the Indians from the violences of  
the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are  
infufficient. It is demonitrated that these vio­  
lences can now be perpetrated with unpunity ;  
and it can need no argument to prove, that un­  
less the murdering oé Indians can be restrained  
by bringing the murderers to condign punish­  
ment, all tic exertions of the government to  
prevent deftrutive retaliations by the Indians,  
will prove fruitlefs, and all our present agreea­  
ble profpeéts illusory. The frequent destruc­  
tion of innocent women and children, who are  
chiefly viftims of retaliation, must continue  
to shock humanity ; and-an enormous-expense,  
to drain the treasury of the Union.  
To enforce upon the Indians the observance  
of justice, it is indispensable that there shall be  
competent means of rendering justice to them.  
If these means can be devised by the wisdom of  
Congress ; and c‘ggccially if there can be added  
an adequate provision for supplying the neceffi­  
tics of the Indians, on reasonable terms (a mea~  
sure, the mention of which I the more readily  
repeat, as in all the conferences with them, they  
urge it with solicitude) I should not hesitate to  
entertain a firong hope of rendering our tran­  
c“ﬁlity gcrmnenr. I add, with pleasure, that  
the probability even of their civilization, is not  
diminithed by the experiments which have been  
thus far made, under the auspices of govern­  
ment. The accomplishment of this work, if  
praéticable, will refleét -undecaying luftre on  
our national charafler, and adminifier the mo&amp;  
Emeful consolations that virtuous minds can  
now. ; &lt;  
  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,

have been borrowed and re-imburfed, pursuant  
to different afts of Congress, will be submitted

Temperate discussion of the important fub­

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and Houſe of Repreſentatives,  
  
I TRusT I do not deceive myſelf, while I indulge the  
perſuaſion, that I have never met you at any priod, when,  
more than at the preſent, the ſituation of our public affairs  
has afforded ;uſt cauſe for mutual congratulation, and for  
inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the  
  
( 2 )  
Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary  
bleihags we enjoy.  
  
The termination of the long, expenſive and diſtreſſing  
war, in which we have been engaged with certain Indians,  
North Weſt of the Ohio, is placed in the option of the  
United States, by a Treaty which the Commander of our  
army has concluded, proviſionally, with the hoſtile tribes  
in that region, In the adjuſtment of the terms, the ſatis-  
faction of the Indians was deemed an object worthy no leſs  
of the policy, than of the liberality of the United States,  
as the neceſſary baſis of durable tranquility. This object,  
it is believed, has been fully attained, Ihe articles agreed  
upon, will immediately be laid before the Senate, for their  
conſideration.  
  
The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the  
Southern tribes had annoyed our Frontiers, have lately con-  
firmed their pre-exiſting Treaties with us; and were giv-  
ing evidence of a ſincere diſpoſition to carry them into ef-  
fect, by the ſurrender ꝓf the prifoners and property the  
had taken :—But we have to lament, that the fair prafued  
in this quarter, has been once more clouded by wanton  
murders, which ſome citizens of Georgia are repreſented  
to haye recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the  
Creeks ; which have again ſubjected that frontier to diſ-  
quietude and danger; which will be productive of further  
expenice, and may occaſion more effuſion of blood, Mea-  
fures are purſuing to prevent or mitigate the uſual conſe-  
quences of ſuch outrages ; and with the hope of their ſue-  
ceeding—at leaſt to avert general hoſtility.  
  
A letter from the Emperor of Morocco, announces to  
me his recognition of our treaty made with his father, the  
late Emperor, and confequently the continuance of peace  
with that power. With peculiar ſatisfaction I add, that  
information has been received from an agent deputed on  
our part to Algiers, importing, that the terms of a treaty  
with the Dey and Regency of that country, had been ad-  
juſted in ſuch a manner, as to authorize the expeCtation of  
a ſpeedy peace, and the reſtoration of our unfortunate fel-  
low citizens from a grievous captivity,  
  
The lateſt advices from our envoy at the court of Ma-  
drid, give, moreover, the pleaſing information, that he  
had received aſſurances of a ſpeedy and fatisfaQtory  
concluſion of his negociation. While the event, depend-

Though not before officially diſcloſed to the Houſe of  
Repreſentatives, you, gentlemen, are all apprized, that a  
treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, has been nego-  
ciated with Great Britain; and that the Senate have adviſ-  
ed and conſented to its ratification, upon a condition, which  
excepts part of one article. —Agrecably thereto, and to the  
  
  
after full and mature deliberation, I have added my ſanc-  
tion. The reſult on the part of his Britannic Majeſty is  
unknown. when received, the ſubject will, without de-  
lay, be placed before Congreſs.  
  
This intereſting ſummary of our affairs, with regard to  
the foreign powers, between whom and the United States,  
controverſies have ſubſiſted; and with regard alſo to thoſe  
of our Indian neighbours, with whom, we have been in a  
ſtate of enmity or miſunderſtanding, opens a wide field  
for conſoling and gratifying reflections.— If by prudenee  
and moderation on every fide, the extinguiſhment of all  
the cauſes of external diſcord, which have heretofore me-  
naced our tranquility, on terms compatible with our na-  
tional rights and honour, ſhall be the happy refult ; how  
firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for  
accelerating, maturing and eſtabliſhing the proſperity of  
gur country.  
  
Contemplating the internal fituation, as well as the  
external relations of the United Sates, we diſcover e-  
qual cauſe for contentment and ſatisfaction. While many  
af the nations of Europe, with their American depen-  
  
  
exhauſting and calamitous, in which the evils of foreign  
war have been aggravated by domeſtic convulſion and in-  
ſurrection; in which many of the arts moſt uſeful to ſoci-  
ety, have been expoſed to diſcouragement and decay; in  
which ſcarcity of ſubfiſtence has embittered other ſufferings  
while even the anticipation of a return of the bleſſings  
of peace and repoſe, are alloyed by the fenſe of heavy and  
accumulating burthens, which preſs upon all the depart-  
ments of induſtry, and threaten to clog the future ſprings  
of government our fayoured country, happy in a ſtriking  
  
.  
contraſt, has enjoyed general tranquility; a tranquility the  
more ſatisfactory, becauſe maintained at the expence of no  
duty — Faithful to ourſelves, we have violated no obligation  
to others. — Our agriculture, commerce ang manufac-  
tures proſper beyond former example; the moleſtations of  
our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however,  
very pointed remonſtrances have been made) being overba-  
lanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a  
neutral poſition. , Our population advances with a celerity,  
  
  
tionally augments, our ſtrength and reſources, and guaran-  
tees our future ſecurity. Every part of the Union diſplays  
indications of rapid and various improvement, and with  
burthens ſo light as ſcarcely to be perceived; with reſources,  
fully adequate to our preſent exigences; with governments,  
founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty; and  
with mild and wholſome laws; is it too much to ſay, that  
our country exhibits a ſpectacle of national happineſs never  
ſurpaſſed, if ever before equalled ? |  
.. Placed in a ſituation every way auſpicious, motives of  
commanding force impel us, with ſincere acknowledge-,  
ment to Heaven, and pure loye to our country, to unite,  
our efforts to preſerve, prolong and improve our immenſe  
advantages. To co-operate with you in this deſirable  
work, 1s a fervent and favourite wiſh of my heart. *  
It is a valuable ingredient in the general eſtimate of our  
welfare, that the part of our country which was lately the,  
ſcene of diſorder and inſurrection, now enjoys the bleſ-  
fings of quiet and order. The miſled have abandoned  
their errors, and pay the reſpect to our conſtitution and  
laws, which is due from good citizens to the public autho-  
rities of the ſociety. Theſe circumſtances * induced  
me to pardon, generally, the offenders here referred to;  
  
  
to capital puniſhment.—For though I ſhall always think it  
a ſacred duty to exerciſe with firmneſs and energy, the con-  
ſtitutional powers with which I am veſted; yet it appears  
to me no leſs conſiſtent with the public good, than it is  
with my perſonal feelings, to mingle in the operations of  
government, every degree of moderation and tenderneſs,  
which the national juſtice, dignity and ſafety may permit.  
Gentlemen, | *  
Among the objects which will claim your attention in  
the courſe of the ſeſſion, a review of our military eſtabliſh-  
  
-  
  
I» Wh ˙ I oh  
  
Ci SY  
  
  
to hange the relative ſituation of our frontiers. In this  
review, you will doubtleſs allow due weight to the conſi-  
derat&#x27;ons, that the queſtions between us and certain foreign  
  
owers are not yet finally djuſted ; that the war in Europe  
  
  
recovered, will demand proviſion for garriſoning and ſe-  
curing them. A ſtatement of our preſcht military force  
will be laid before you by the depart nent of war.  
  
With the review of our army eſtabliſhment, is naturally  
connected that of the militia, It will merit enquiry, what  
  
  
have unfolded. The ſubject is of ſo much moment, in my  
eſtimation, as to excite a conſtant ſohcitude, that the conſi-  
deration of it may be renewed, till the greateſt attainable  
perfection ſhall be accompliſhed. Time is wearing away  
ſome advantages for forwarding the object, while none  
better deſerves the perſevering attention of the public coun-  
cils.  
  
While we indulge the ſatisfaction, which the actual  
condition of our weſtern borders fo well authorizes, it is  
neceſſary that we ſhould not loſe fight of an important  
truth, which continually receives new confirmations, -name-  
ly, that the proviſions heretofore made with a view to the  
protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawleſs  
part of our frontier inhabitants, are inſufficient. It is demon-  
ſtrated that theſe violences can now be perpetrated with im-  
punity. And it can need no argument to prove, that unleſs the  
murdering of Indians can be reſtrained, by bringing the mur-  
derers tocondign puniſhment, all the exertions ofthe govern-  
ment to prevent deſtructive retaliations by the Indians, will  
prove fruitleſs, and all our preſent agreeable proſpects illu-  
fory. The frequent deſtruQtion of innocent women and  
children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, muſt  
continue to ſhock humanity ; and an enormous expence,  
to drain the treaſury of the Union.  
  
To enforce upon the Indians the obſervance of juſtice,  
it is indiſpenſable that there ſhall be competent means of  
rendering juſtice to them. If theſe means can be deviſed  
by the wiſdom of Congreſs ; and eſpecially if there can  
be added an adequate proviſion for ſupplying the neceſſities  
of the Indians, on ä terme, (a meaſure, the men-  
  
| 1 6 90 X  
tion of which I, the more readily repeat, as in all the cou-  
ferences with them, they urge it with ſolicitude) I ſhould |  
not heſitate to entertain a ſtrong hope of rendering our  
tranquility permanent. I add, with pleaſure, that the  
probability even of their civilization, is not diminiſhed by  
  
the experiments which have been thus far made, under  
the auſpices of government. — The accompliſhment of this  
work, if practicable, will reſſect undecaying luſtre on  
our national chracter, and adminiſter the moſt grateful  
conſolations that virtuous minds can know.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſentativer, |  
The ſtate of our revenue with the ſums which have  
been borrowed and re-imburſed, purſuant to different acts  
&#x27;of Congreſs, will be ſubmitted from the proper depart-  
ments; together with an eſtimate of the appropriations ne-  
ceſſary to be made for the ſervice of the enſuing year.  
Whether meaſures may not be adviſeable to reinforce the  
proviſion for the redemption of the public debt, will na-  
turally engage your examination.—Congreſs have demon-  
ſtrated their ſenſe to be, and it were ſuperfluous to repeat  
mine, that whatſoever will tend to accelerate the honour-  
able extinction of our public debt, accords as much with  
the true intereſt of our country, as with the general ſenſe  
&#x27;of our conſtituents. | | |  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and  
Houſe of Repreſentatives, | |  
The ſtatements which will be laid before you relative to  
the mint, will ſhew the ſituation of that inſtitution z and  
the neceſſity of ſome further legiſlative proviſions, for car-  
rying the buſineſs of it more completely into effect; and  
for checking abuſes which appear to be ariſing in particular  
quarters. GON  
The progreſs in providing materials for the frigates, and  
in building them; the ſtate of the fortifications of our |  
1 harbours; the meaſures which have been purſued for ob-  
1 taining proper ſcites for arſenals, and for repleniſhing our  
magazines with military ſtores ; and the ſteps which have  
been taken towards the execution of the law for opening a.

.“ Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
  
Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
* IT truft Ido not deceive myfelf, while  
T indulge the perfuafion, that I have never  
met you at any period, when, more than  
at the prefent, the fituation of our pubs  
lic affairs has afforded juft caufe for mutual  
congratulation; and for inviting you to  
join with me in profound gratitude to the  
Author of all Gow, for the numerous and  
extraordinary bleflings we enjoy.

“ The termination of the long, expen-  
five, and diftrefling war, in which we  
have been engaged with certain Indians,  
North Weft of tlie Ohia, is placed in the  
option of the United States, by a treaty  
which the commander of ovr army has  
concluded, provifionally, with the hoftile  
tribes in that region.  
  
“In the adjuftment of the terms, the  
fatisfaftion of the Indians was deemed an  
ObjeA worthy no lefs of the policy, than  
of the liberality, of the United States, as  
the neceffary bafis of durable tranquillity.  
This objet, it is believed, has been fully  
attained. The articles agreed upon will  
immediately be laid before the Senate for  
their confideration.  
  
“ The Creeks and Cherokee Indians,  
who alone of the Southern tribes-had an-  
moyed our frontiers, have lately confirmed  
their pre-exifting ‘reatics with us; and  
were giving evidence of a fincere difpofi-  
tion to carry them into effect, by the fur-  
render of the prifoners and property ‘they  
had taken: but, we have to lament, that  
the fair profpeét in this quarter bas been  
once more clouded by wanton murders,  
which fome citizens of Georgia are repre-  
fented to haye recently perpetrated . on  
hunting parties of the Creeks; which  
have again fiibjeéted that frontier to dif-  
quietude and danger; which will be pro-  
dutive of further expence, and may occa-  
fion more effufion.of blood. Meafures  
are purfuing, to prevent or mitigate the  
ufual confequences of fuch outrages ; and  
with the hope of their fucceeding—at leaft  
to avert general hoftility.  
  
“A letter from the Emperor of Mo-  
rocco anrounces to me his recognition of  
our treaty, made with his father, the late  
Emperor; and confequently the continu-  
ance of peace with that power.—With  
peculiar fatisfa@lion I add, that informa.  
tion has been received from an agent de-  
  
” puted on our part to Algiers, importing  
that the terms of the treaty with the Dey  
and Regency of ‘that country had been  
adjufted in fuch a manner as to authorife  
the expe@lation of a fpeedy peace, and the  
reftoration of our unfortunate fellow-citi-  
zens from a grievous captivity.  
  
The lateft advices from our envoy at  
the Court of Madrid give, moreover, the  
pleafing information, that he had received  
affurances of a {peedy and fatisfaétory con=  
clufion of his negotiation. While the ex-  
tent, depending upon unadjufted particu-  
Jars, cannot be regarded as afcertained, it  
is agreeable to cherith the expectation of  
an iffue, which, fecuring amicably very  
effential interefts of the United States, will,  
at the fame time, lay the foundation of  
lafting harmony with: a power, whofe  
friendthip we have uniformly and fincerely

whom and the United States controverfies  
have fubfifted, and with regard alfo to  
thofe of our Indian neighbours with whom  
we have been in a ftate of enmity or mif-  
underftanding, opens a wide field for  
confoling and gratifying réfleftions. If,  
by prudence and moderation on every fide,  
the extingwifament of all the caufes of ex.

fhall be the happy refult—how firm and  
how precious a foundation will have been  
laid for accelerating, maturing, and eftabs  
lithing, the profperity of our country !  
  
“‘ Contemplating the interna! fituation,  
as well as the external relations of the  
United States, we difcover equal caufe  
for contentment and fatisfaétion. While  
many of the nations of Europe, with their  
American dependences, have been ins

6¢ Gentlemen,  
  
* Among the objeéts which will claim  
  
your attention in the courfe of the feffion,  
a review of our military eftablifament is  
not the leaft. important, It is called for  
by the events which have changed, and  
May-he expected {till farther to change,  
the relative fituation of our frontiers. In  
this review, you will douhtlefs allow due  
Weight to the confiderations, that the quef-  
tions hetwe-n us and certain foreign powers  
are not yet finally adjufted ; that the war  
in Europe is not -yet terminated ; and that  
our Weftern polls, when recovered, will  
demand provifion tor garrifon and fecuring  
then, A ftatement of our prefent mili-  
tary firce will he laid before you by the

&#x27; With the review of our army efta-  
blifhment is naturally conneéted that of the  
military. lt will merit enquiry, what  
imperfections in the exiting plan farther  
experience may have unfolded, “The fub-

the greatett attainable perfection fhall be

advantages for forwarding thé object, while  
none better deferves the perfevering atten=  
tion of the Public Council,  
  
“While we indulge: the fatisfa€tion  
which the a€tual condition of our Weftera  
borders fo well authorizes, it is neceffary  
that we fhould not lofe fight of an import  
tant truth, which continually receives new  
confirmations—namely, that the provifions  
heretofore made, with a view tothe pro  
teétion of the Indians fromthe violences of  
the lawlefs part of our frontier inhabitants,  
are infufficient, It is demonftrated that  
thefe violences can now be perpetrated  
with impunity; and. it_can need no argue  
ment fo prove, that, unlefs the murdering  
of Indians can be reftrained, by-bringing  
the murderers to condign penifhment, all  
the exertions of the government to prevent  
deftruétive retaliations by the indians will  
prove fruitlefs, and all our prefent agreeable  
profpeéts illufory. The frequent deftruce  
tion of innocent women and @ildren, who  
are chiefly the viims of retaliation, muft  
continue to fhock humanity ; and an enor-  
mous expence to drain the treafury of the  
Union.  
  
“ To enforce upon the Indians the ob»  
fervance of juftice, it is indifpenfable that  
there fhall be competent means of render  
ing juftice to them. If thefe means can be  
devifed by the wifdom of Congrefs, and  
efpecially if there can be added an adequate  
provifion for fupplying the neceffities of  
the Indians, on reafonable terms (a mea=  
fure, the mention of which I the-more  
readily repeat, as in all conferences with  
them they urge it with folicitude), I fhould  
not hefitate to entertain a ftrong hope of  
rendering our tranquillity permanent. I  
add with pleafure, that the probability  
even of their civilization, is not diminith  
by the experiments which have been thus  
far made under the aufpices of govern.

to beth Houfes of Congrefs, December 8, 1795.  
  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and  
Houfe of Reprefentatives.  
I TRUST I do not deceive myfelf, while  
  
I indulge the perfwafion, that I have  
never met at any period, when, move than  
at the prefent, the fituation of our public  
affairs has afforded juft caufe of mutual  
congratulation, and for inviting you to  
join with me in profound gratitude to the  
Author of all Good, forthe numerous and  
extraordinary bieflings we enjoy.  
  
The termination of the long, expenfive,  
and diftreffing war in which we have been  
engaged with certain Indians north-wett of  
the Ohio, is placed in the option of the  
United S ates, by a treaty which the com-  
mander of our army has contluded, pro-  
vilionally, with the hoftile tribes in that  
region.  
  
In the adjuftment of the terms, the fatif-  
faction of the Indians was deemed an ob-  
je&amp;t worthy no lefs of the policy than of  
the liberality of the Unit-d States, as the  
neceflary bafis of durabie tranquillity.  
This objeét has been fully attained, The  
articles agreed upon will immediately be  
Jaid before thé fenate, for their confidera-  
tion. of  
  
The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who  
alone of the fouthern tribes had annoyed  
our frontiers, have lately confirmed their  
pre exifting treaties with us, and were  
giving evidence of a fincere difpofition to  
carry them into effe&amp;t, by the furrender of  
the prifoners and property they had taken :  
but we have to lament that the fair prof-  
pest in this quarter has been once more  
c&#x27;ouded by wanton murders, which fome  
citizens of Georgia are reprefented to have  
recently perpetrated on hunting parties of  
the Creeks; which have again fubjeéted  
that frontier to difquictude and ‘danger,  
which will be productive of further ex-  
pence, and may occafion further effufion  
of blood. Méeafures are purfuing to pre-  
vent or mitigate the bfual confequences of  
fuch outrages ; and with the hope of their  
Psa 5 at leaft to avert a general hof-  
tility. ° Me  
  
A letter from the emperor of Morocco  
announces to me his recognition of our  
treaty made with his father the late empe-  
ror; and confequently the continuance of  
  
e with that power. With peculiar  
jatisfaétion I add, that information has  
been seceived from an agent deputed on  
  
our part to Algiers, importing, that the  
  
“terms of the treaty with the dey and re-  
  
gency of that country had been adjuited in  
fuch a manner, as to au:korize th: expec-  
tation of a {peccly peace, and the reftora-  
tion of our unfortunate fellow. citizens  
from a grievous captivity.  
  
Toe latett advices from our envoy at  
the court of Madrid give, moreover, the  
p&#x27;eafing information, that he had received  
a:lurances of a fpeedy and fatisfactory con-  
clufion of his negociation. While the:  
event, depending upon unadjufted parti-  
culars, cannot be regarded as afcertained,  
it is agreeable to cherifh the expeétation  
of an iffue, which, tecuring amicably the  
very effential interefts of the’ United States,  
will, at the fame time, lay the foundation  
of lating harmony with a power whofe  
triendfhip we have uniformly and fincerely  
defired tg cultivate. :  
Though not before officially difclofed tq  
the houfe of reprefentatives, you, gentle-  
men, are apprized, that a treaty of amity,  
commerce, and navigation, “has been ne-  
gociated with Great Britain; and that  
the fenate have advifed and conitnted to  
its ratification, upon a condition which  
excepts part of one article. Agreeably  
thereto, and to-the beft judgment I was  
able to form of the public interefts, after  
full and mature deliberation, I hove addéd  
my fanétion. The refult on the part of  
his Britannic majelty is unknown. When  
received, the fubje&amp;t will, without delay,  
be placed before congre{s.&#x27; ph %  
  
This interefting {ummary of our affairs  
with regard to the foreign powers, be-  
tween whom and the United States con-  
troverfiés have fubfitted, and with regard  
alfo to thofe of our Indian neighbours  
with whom we have been in a ftate of en-  
mity and mifunderftanding, opens a wide  
field for confoling ana gratifying reflec-  
tions. If by prudence and moderation on  
every fide, the extinguiihment of all the  
caufes of external difcord, which have  
heretofore ménaced our tranquillity, on  
terms compatible with our national rights  
and ‘honour, fhall be the happy reiult,  
how firm and how precious a foundation  
will have been laid for accelerating, ma-  
turing, and eftablifhing the profperity of  
our country ? :  
  
Contemplating the internal fituation, as  
well as the external relations of the United  
States, we difcover équal cavfe for cons  
  
  
  
  
  
FOR JANUARY, 1796.  
  
tentment and fatisfaStion. While many of  
the tktions of Europe, with their Ame-  
rican dependencies, have been involved in  
a contelt unufually ~ bloody, exhaufting,  
and calamitous, in which the evils of fo-  
reign war have been aggravated hy do-  
mettic convulfions and infurrection ; in  
which many of the arts moft ufeful to fo-  
ciety have been expofed to di/couragement  
and decay; in which fcarcity of fubuitence  
has embittered other fufferings; while even  
theanticipations of a return of the bleffings  
of peace and repofe are alloyed by the tenfe  
of heavy and accumulating burdens, which  
prefs upon all the departments of induttry,  
and threaten to clog the future {prings of  
government; our favoured country, happy  
in a ttriking contraft, has enjoyed general  
trauquillity—the more fatisfaXory, becaufe  
ntaintained at the expence of no duty.  
Faithful to ourfelves, we have violated no  
obligation to others. Our agriculture,  
commerce, and manufattures profper be-  
yond former example; the moleftations of  
our trade (to preventacontinuance of which,  
however, very pointed remonttrances have  
been mace) being overbalanced by theaggre-  
gate benefits which it derives from a neu-  
tral pofition. Our population advances  
with a celerity which, exceeding the moft  
fanguine expectations, proportionally aug-  
ments our ftrength and refources, and  
guarantees our future fecurity. Every  
part of the union difplays indications of  
rapid and various improvement, and with  
burdens fo light as fearcely to be per-  
ceived; with refources fuliy adequate to  
our prefent exigencies ; with governments  
founded on the genuine principles of ra-  
tional libe:iy, and with mild and whole-  
fome laws; is it too much to fay, that  
ou: country exhibits a {peétacle of national  
happinefs never furpafftd, if ever before  
equalled ?  
  
‘Placed in a fitwat’on every way fo auf-  
picious, motives of commanding force  
impel us, with fincere acknowledgment  
to Heaven, and pure love to our coun-  
try, to unite our efforts to preferve, pro-  
Jong, and improve our immenie advan-  
tages. To co-operate with you in this  
defirable work, is a fervent and favourite  
with of my heart.  
  
It is a valuable ingredient in the general  
eftimate of our welfare, that the part of  
our country, which was lately the fcene  
of diforder and inturreétion, now enjoys  
the bleflings of quict and order. The mif-  
led have abandoned their errors, and pay  
the refpe&amp;t to our conftitution and laws,  
which is due from good citizens to the  
  
public authorities of the fociety.—Thefe  
circumftances have induced me to pardon,  
generally, the offenders here referred to;  
and to extend forgivenefs to thofe wha  
haye heen adjudged to capital punifhnent,  
—For, although I fhall always think it a  
facred duty, to exercife with firmnels and  
energy the conftitutional powers with which  
I am velted ; yet it appeared to me nc lefs  
confittent with the public good, than it is  
with my perfonal feelings, to mingle in the  
operations of government every degree of  
moderation and tendernefs, which the na-  
tional juftice, dignity, and fafety may pere~  
mit.  
  
Gentlemen,  
  
Among the objects which will claim  
your attention in the courfe of the fef-  
fion, a review of our military eftablith-  
ment is not the leait important. It is  
cailed for by the events whieh- have  
changed, and may be expected {till further  
to change, the relative fituation of our  
frontiers. In this review, you will doubt-  
lefs allow due weight to the confiderations,  
that the queftions between us and certain  
foreign powers, are not yet finally ad-  
juitea ; that the war in Europe is not yet  
terminated; and ‘that our weftern pofts  
when recovered, will demand provifion for  
garrifoning and fecuring them. A ftate-  
ment of our prefent military force, will be  
laid before you by the department of war.  
  
With the review of our army eftablith-  
ment is naturally conneéted that of the  
militia, It will merit enquiry, what im-  
perte&amp;tions in the exifting plan, further ex-  
perience may have unfolded. The dubject  
is of fo much moment, in my eftimation,  
as to excite a conftant folicitude, that the  
confideration of it may be renewed until  
the greateft attainable perfection fhall be  
accomplifhed. Time is wearing away  
fome advantages for forwarding the ob-  
ject, while none better deferves the perfe-  
vering attention of the public councils,  
  
While we indulge the fatisfaction, which  
the aftual condition of our weftern borders  
fo well authorifes ; it is neceffary that we  
fhould not lofe fight of an important truth,  
which continually receives new confirma-  
tions ; namely, that the provifions hereto-  
fore made with a view to the proteétion of  
the Indians from the violence of the lawlefs  
part of the frontier inhabitants are infufh-  
cient. It is demonftrated, that thefe vio-  
lences can now be perpetrated with impu-  
nity. And it can need no argument to  
prove, that unlefs the murdering of In-  
dians can be reftrained, by bringing the  
  
  
  
62  
  
murderers to condign punifhment, all the  
-exertions ot the government to prevent de-  
ftructive retaiiations by the Indians, will  
“prove fruitle{s, and all our preient agree-  
able prolpects siiufory. The frequent de-  
ftrusiion of innocent women and children,  
ewho are chiefly the victims of retaliation,  
mutt continue to fhock humanity; and an  
enormous expence to drain the treatury of  
the union.  
  
To entorce upon the Indians the obfer-  
vance of juitice, itis indifpentible that there  
thall be competent means of rendering juf-  
tice tothem. If thete means can be de-  
vifed by the witdom of congrefs, and efpe-  
-cially it there can be added an adequate  
provifion for fupplying the neceffities of the  
Indians, on reafonable terms, (a meafure,  
‘the mention of which I the more readily re-  
peat, asin all the conferences with them,  
they urge it withdolicitude,) I thould not  
helitate to-entertain a‘ftrong hope of ren-  
dering our tranquillity permanent. Tadd,  
avith pieature, that the probability even of  
their civilization is not diminifhed by the  
experiments which have been thus far  
anade under the aufpices of government.  
‘The accomplifhment of this work, if prac-  
ticable, wiil reflect undecaying luftre on  
our national character, and adminitter the  
most gratcful coniolations that virtuous  
minds can know.  
  
Gentlemen of the Hou of Reprefentatives,  
  
The fate of our revenue, with the fums  
@hat have been borrowed and re-imburied,  
purfuant to the different a&amp;s of congrefs,  
will be fubmitted from the proper depart-  
ments; together with an eitiimate of the  
appropriations neceflary to be made for the  
turvice of the enfuing year.  
  
Whether meaiures may not be advifable  
  
THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
to reinforce the provifion for ihe redempe  
tion of the public debt, will naturally en+  
  
age your examination—congrefs have de-  
monftvated their fenfe to be, and it were  
fuperfluous to repeat mine, that what{o-  
ever will! tend to accelerate the honourable  
extingtion of our public debt, accords as  
much withithe true interefts of our country,  
as with the general fenle of our -coniti-  
tuents.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and Houfe  
of Reprefentatives,  
  
The ftatement which will be laid before  
you, relative to the mint, will thew the fitu-  
ation of that inttitution, and the neceflity  
af fome further legitlative provifions for  
carrying the bufinets of it more completely  
into effect, and for checking abufes whici  
appear to bé ariling in particular quar  
ters.  
  
The progrefs in providing materials for  
the frigates, and in building them, the  
flare of the fortifications of our harbours;  
the meafures which have been purfved for  
obtaining proper feites for arfenals, and  
for replenithing our magazines with mili-  
tary ftores ; and the fteps which have been  
taken toward the execution of the law for  
opening a trade with the Indians, will like-  
wile be prefented for the information of  
congrets.  
  
Temperate difcuffion of the important  
fabie&amp;ts which may arife in the courfe of  
the feffion ; and mutual forbearance, where  
there is a ditterence of opinion, are too ab-  
vious and neceflary for the peace, happi-  
nels, and welfare of our country, to need  
any recommendation of mine.

Every part of the unicn dlfpiayj  
indications of rapid and various  
improveiiienr, and with burihens  
fo light as (earcely to be perceiv-  
ed ; with relources fully adecjuate  
to our prelent exigencies; wiih  
Govcii meiiis fountled on the ge-  
nuine principles of rational liber-  
ty, and with mild and wholclome  
laws: — is it too much to lay, that  
our country, exhibits a fpec&quot;tacle  
of national ha&gt; &gt;pinefs never fur-  
palled, if ever before equalled ?  
  
Placed in a fit nation every way  
aufpirious, motives of command-  
ing &quot;force impel us, withiincere  
peknow ledgrmetDt to Peaven, and  
pure love to our country, to unite  
our effort! to pj eferve, prolong and  
impiove our immenfe advantages.  
To co-opciate with you in this de-  
  
ferable work, is a fervent and fa-  
vourue wifh of my heart.  
  
It is a valuable ingredient in the  
general ellimare of our welfare,  
tnat the part of our country, which  
was lately the fcene of diforder  
ami infui rection, now enjoy the  
blellir.gs of quiet and order, &#x27;1 he  
milled have abandoned their er-  
iois, and pay the refpec&#x27;t to our  
conftitntioh and laws, which is due  
from good citizens to the public  
authorities of the fociety. J hcl&#x27;e  
cii cna. llances have induced me to  
pardon, g.-heraliv, the offenders  
litre relcred to; apd to extend

fkcred duty, to exercife with firm-  
ne(\ end energy the conllii i tin.al  
powers w ith w hicb 1 am veiled; yet  
ic appears to me no lefs coniiltent  
w ith the public gcod than it is with  
my pci fon.il feelings, to mingle in  
theoperarion? of go, eminent every  
degree of moderation and tei.der-  
nefs, which the national jultice,  
dignity and l&#x27;alety may peimit.  
  
Among the objects which will  
claim your attention in the couife  
of the li flion. a review of our mi-  
litary eflablithment is not the lealt  
important. It is called for by the  
events which have changed and  
may be expected lltli turther to  
change, the relative fituatiou of  
our frontiei s. In i his i c v ievv, y on  
will doubt lefs allow due weight to  
the confidci alions, that the quef-  
tion between us cc :uin loreign  
powers, aie not yet finally avail-  
ed ; that the war in Europe i% nut  
yet terminated, and that our weft-  
ein polls, when recovered, will  
deiiirnd provtfiun for garrifbning  
and ftcuring them. A itatemenc  
of our p. efeat t.ncr, w ill be laid  
before you by the department of  
w ar.  
  
With the review of nurnrmyef-  
tahjhiuueht, is r.ai orally romtee%«  
ed that of t he n: il i &gt; ia It wiJI me-  
fit siOqulry, what imperfection in  
the exalting plan, turther experi-  
ence may have unfolded. The fub-  
je. r i-. of fo much moment, in my  
estimation, as to excite a coiijtant ,  
Cblftcittide, rhat the ccnlidcration  
of it iiu) be renew ed till the greet-  
ed attainable peilec&#x27;iion fliali be  
accomplimed. Time is wealing  
away mine advantages for for-  
warding the object, while none  
better dci&#x27;erves the preferving at-  
tention of the public council*.  
  
While we indulge the latisfac-  
tion, Which the actual condition of  
our weftern border.&quot; fo well autho-  
rizes , it is nccellary that we (hould  
not lolc fijdit of an important  
truth, which continually receives  
new continuations— namely, that  
the provilions heretofore made  
witli a view to the protection of  
the Indians from the violences ot  
the lawlefs parts of our frontier  
inhabitants, are infufheienr. It is  
dcmonfl rated that thefe violences  
can now be peipetrated with im-  
punity. And it can need no argu-  
ment to prove that unlets the mur-  
dering Indians can be rellrained,  
by bringing the murderers to con-  
dign jnmilhiuent, all the exertions  
of the government to prevent de-  
ftruciive retaliations by the Indi-  
ans, will prove fruitlefs, and all  
ourprefent agreeable profpectsil-  
lufory.  
  
1 he frequent deftrtnftion of in-  
nocent women and children, who  
aie chiefly the victims of retaliati-  
on mult continue to fhock humani-  
ty : and an enormous expence, to  
drain the treafury of the union.  
  
To enforce upon the Indians the  
obfervance of juftice, it is indif-  
penfihle that there fhall be com-  
petent means of rendering juftice  
to them. If thefe means can be  
devifed by the wifdom ofCongrels ;  
and efpccially if there can be add*  
  
ed an adequate provifion for fup.  
plying the neeeluties of the Inci.

Among the objeXs which will cl.ilin  
.your Attention in the courfc of the fctliun,  
a review cf otir mditary ellahlilhincnt is  
nut the lead important. It is called  
for by the events which have changed, and  
may be expeXed Aill fuither to change, tire  
relative fituation of onr frontiers. in  
this review, you will duuhtlcfs allow due  
w;.ight to tnc confideiatior.s, that the  
quiAions Ikiwixh os and certain foreign  
Powers arc not yet finally adjuAe.l; that  
war in Kurrnc is not yet icrminattd •,  
  
and  
  
tnJ owr Weftfrn pofti, when  
cover^t will demand pi ovUion for gan i-  
foniiig and ll&#x27;curing them. A ftatement  
of oiir prefent military force will be laid  
b^ore you by the Department of War.  
  
With the review of our Army cftablirti-  
ment, is naturally connei^cd that of the  
Militia. It will merit enquiry, wlut im¬  
pel fe^fions in the exiting plan fuither  
experience may have unfoldcii. The i‘wb-  
j rt is cf fo much moment, in my eftima-  
tioii, as to excite a conllant foliciiude, that  
ilkc confideration of it may be rer.ewcd  
until the greateft attainable perfection ihall  
heaccomplifhed. Time is wening away  
fomc advantages for forwarding the ob-  
ieCl, while none better deferves the per-  
ilevering attention of the public council.  
  
While we indulge the latisfa^fion which  
iheaftual condition ol cur W’etfern b&lt;&gt;r-  
deift fo wtllautliorifes, it is r.ectflaiy that  
weihould not lole fight of an impoitant  
truth, which continually receives new enn-  
Hrmaiions, namely, that the provifions  
heretofore made with a view to the protec¬  
tion of the Indians from the violences of  
the liwlefs part of our frontier inhabitants,  
are infuHicient. It is demonitrated, that  
thefe violences can now be perpetrated  
with impunity. And it can need no ar¬  
gument to prove, that unlefs the inurder-  
••g of Indians can be reltralned by  
bringing tlie nmideters to condign punifli-  
inent, all the exertions of the Government  
to prevent dettruArve retaliations by the  
InUians, will prove fruitleis, and all our  
piefent agreeable profj&gt;e6fs illufoi y. The  
tiequcnt dtllructlon ot innocent women  
and children, who arc chiefly the victims  
rf retaliation, mufl continue to Ihock  
liamanity ; and an enormous cxpence  
to drain the Treafury of the Union.  
  
To enforce upon the Indians the ob-  
fervance of jultice, it is indlf^»ci»rihlc that  
there fliall be competent means of ren¬  
dering jullice to them. If theli: means  
can be devifedby the wifdoin of Ctmgreis,
