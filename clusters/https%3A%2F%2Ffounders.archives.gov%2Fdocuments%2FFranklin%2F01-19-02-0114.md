he Printer of the London Packet.  
Sir,  
I Understand from the public papers, that in the debates on the bill for relieving the Dissenters in the point of subscription to the Church Articles, sundry reflections were thrown out against that people, importing, “that they themselves are of a persecuting intolerant spirit, for that when they had here the superiority they persecuted the church, and still persecute it in America, where they compel its members to pay taxes for maintaining the Presbyterian or independent worship, and at the same time refuse them a toleration in the full exercise of their religion by the administrations of a bishop.”  
  
If we look back into history for the character of present sects in Christianity, we shall find few that have not in their turns been persecutors, and complainers of persecution. The primitive Christians thought persecution extremely wrong in the Pagans, but practised it on one another. The first Protestants of the Church of England, blamed persecution in the Roman church, but practised it against the Puritans: these found it wrong in the Bishops, but fell into the same practice themselves both here and in New England. To account for this we should remember, that the doctrine of toleration was not then known, or had not prevailed in the world. Persecution was therefore not so much the fault of the sect as of the times. It was not in those days deemed wrong in itself. The general opinion was only, that those who are in error ought not to persecute the truth: But the possessors of truth were in the right to persecute error, in order to destroy it. Thus every sect believing itself possessed of all truth, and that every tenet differing from theirs was error, conceived that when the power was in their hands, persecution was a duty required of them by that God whom they supposed to be offended with heresy. By degrees more moderate and more modest sentiments have taken place in the Christian world; and among Protestants particularly all disclaim persecution, none vindicate it, and few practise it. We should then cease to reproach each other with what was done by our ancestors, but judge of the present character of sects or churches by their present conduct only.  
Now to determine on the justice of this charge against the present dissenters, particularly those in America, let us consider the following facts. They went from England to establish a new country for themselves, at their own expence, where they might enjoy the free exercise of religion in their own way. When they had purchased the territory of the natives, they granted the lands out in townships, requiring for it neither purchase-money nor quit-rent, but this condition only to be complied with, that the freeholders should for ever support a gospel minister (meaning probably one of the then governing sects) and a free-school within the township. Thus, what is commonly called Presbyterianism became the established religion of that country. All went on well in this way while the same religious opinions were general, the support of minister and school being raised by a proportionate tax on the lands. But in process of time, some becoming Quakers, some Baptists, and, of late years some returning to the Church of England (through the laudable endeavours and a proper application of their funds by the society for propagating the gospel) objections were made to the payment of a tax appropriated to the support of a church they disapproved and had forsaken. The civil magistrates, however, continued for a time to collect and apply the tax according to the original laws which remained in force; and they did it the more freely, as thinking it just and equitable that the holders of lands should pay what was contracted to be paid when they were granted, as the only consideration for the grant, and what had been considered by all subsequent purchasers as a perpetual incumbrance on the estate, bought therefore at a proportionably cheaper rate; a payment which it was thought no honest man ought to avoid under the pretence of his having changed his religious persuasion. And this I suppose is one of the best grounds of demanding tythes of dissenters now in England. But the practice being clamoured against by the episcopalians as persecution, the legislature of the Province of the Massachusets-Bay, near thirty years since, passed an act for their relief, requiring indeed the tax to be paid as usual, but directing that the several sums levied from members of the Church of England, should be paid over to the Minister of that Church, with whom such members usually attended divine worship, which Minister had power given him to receive and on occasion to recover the same by law.  
It seems that legislature considered the end of the tax was, to secure and improve the morals of the people, and promote their happiness, by supporting among them the public worship of God and the preaching of the gospel; that where particular people fancied a particular mode, that mode might probably therefore be of most use to those people; and that if the good was done, it was not so material in what mode or by whom it was done. The consideration that their brethren the dissenters in England were still compelled to pay tythes to the clergy of the Church, had not weight enough with the legislature to prevent this moderate act, which still continues in full force, and I hope no uncharitable conduct of the church toward the dissenters will ever provoke them to repeal it.  
With regard to a bishop, I know not upon what ground the dissenters, either here or in America, are charged with refusing the benefit of such an officer to the church in that country. Here they seem to have naturally no concern in the affair. There they have no power to prevent it, if government should think fit to send one. They would probably dislike, indeed, to see an order of men established among them, from whose persecutions their fathers fled into that wilderness, and whose future domination they may possibly fear, not knowing that their natures are changed. But the nonappointment of bishops for America seems to arise from another quarter. The same wisdom of government, probably, that prevents the sitting of convocations, and forbids, by noli prosequi’s, the persecution of Dissenters for non-subscription, avoids establishing bishops where the minds of people are not yet prepared to receive them cordially, lest the public peace should be endangered.  
And now let us see how this persecution-account stands between the parties.  
In New-England, where the legislative bodies are almost to a man Dissenters from the Church of England,  
1. There is no test to prevent Churchmen holding offices.  
2. The sons of Churchmen have the full benefit of the Universities.  
3. The taxes for support of public worship, when paid by Churchmen, are given to the Episcopal minister.  
  
In Old England,  
1. Dissenters are excluded from all offices of profit and honour.  
2. The benefits of education in the Universities are appropriated to the sons of Churchmen.  
3. The clergy of the Dissenters receive none of the tythes paid by their people, who must be at the additional charge of maintaining their own separate worship.  
But it is said, the Dissenters of America oppose the introduction of a Bishop.  
In fact, it is not alone the Dissenters there that give the opposition (if not encouraging must be termed opposing) but the laity in general dislike the project, and some even of the clergy. The inhabitants of Virginia are almost all Episcopalians. The Church is fully established there, and the Council and General Assembly are perhaps to a man its members, yet when lately at a meeting of the clergy, a resolution was taken to apply for a Bishop, against which several however protested; the assembly of the province at their next meeting, expressed their disapprobation of the thing in the strongest manner, by unanimously ordering the thanks of the house to the protesters: for many of the American laity of the church think it some advantage, whether their own young men come to England for ordination, and improve themselves at the same time by conversation with the learned here, or the congregations are supplied by Englishmen, who have had the benefit of education in English universities, and are ordained before they come abroad. They do not therefore see the necessity of a Bishop merely for ordination, and confirmation is among them deemed a ceremony of no very great importance, since few seek it in England where Bishops are in plenty. These sentiments prevail with many churchmen there, not to promote a design, which they think must sooner or later saddle them with great expences to support it. As to the Dissenters, their minds might probably be more conciliated to the measure, if the Bishops here should, in their wisdom and goodness, think fit to set their sacred character in a more friendly light, by dropping their opposition to the Dissenters application for relief in subscription, and declaring their willingness that Dissenters should be capable of offices, enjoy the benefit of education in the universities, and the privilege of appropriating their tythes to the support of their own clergy. In all these points of toleration, they appear far behind the present Dissenters of New-England, and it may seem to some a step below the dignity of Bishops, to follow the example of such inferiors. I do not, however, despair of their doing it some time or other, since nothing of the kind is too hard for true christian humility. I am, Sir, your’s, &amp;c.

‘¢ T underftand from the public pa-  
pers, that in the debates on the bill for  
rélieving thediffentersin thepoint offub-  
fcription to the Church Articles, fundry  
reficétions were thrown out againft that  
peeple, importing ‘ that they them-  
felves are of a perfecuting, intolerant  
fpirit; for that when they had here the  
fuperivrity, they profecuted the church,  
and ftill perfecute it in ‘America, where  
they compel its members to pay taxes  
jor maintaining the Prefbyterian or  
Independent worhhip, and at the fame  
time refufe them a toleration in the full  
exercile of their religion by the admi-  
niltration of a Bifhop.”  
  
If we look back into hiftory for the  
character of prefent {c&amp;s in chriftiani-  
ty, we fhall find few that have not in  
their turns been perfecutors, and com-  
plainers of perfecution. The primi-  
tive Chriftians thought perfecution ex-  
tremely wrong in the Pagans, but  
practifed it.on one another. The firft  
Proteftants of the church of England  
blamed perfecution in the Roman  
charch, but pradtifed it againft the Pu-  
xitans; thefe found it wrong in the  
Bifhops, but fell into the fame pra&amp;tice  
themfelves both here and in New Eng-  
Jand. To account for this we fhould  
remember, that the doétrine of tolera-  
tion was not then known, or had not  
prevailed in the world. Perfecution  
was therefore not fo much the fault of  
the fe&amp;t as of thetimes. It was not in  
thofe days deemed wrong iv it/elf.  
‘The general opinion was only, that  
thofe who are in error ought not to  
perfecute the truth: but the pofefors  
of truth were in the right to perfecute  
error, in order to deftroy it. Thus e-  
very {cét believing itfelf poffefled of all  
truth, and that every tenet differing  
from theirs was error, conceived that  
when the power was in their hands,  
perfecution was a duty iequired of  
them by that God whom they fuppofe  
to be offended with herefy.—By de-  
grees, more moderate and more modeff  
fentiments have taken place in the  
Chiftian world; and among Pro-  
teftants particularly aj} difclaim perfe-  
cution, mone vindicate it, and few  
practifeit, We fhould, then, ceafe to  
reproach each other with what was  
dene by our anceftors, but judge of  
the preent charaGer of feéts or  
cliches by their prefént condug only.  
  
iwow to determine on the juftice of  
ths cherge againf the prefent Diffen-  
  
ters, particularly thofe in America,  
let us confider the following fats:  
They went from England to eftablith  
a new country for themfelves, at their  
own expence, where they might enjoy  
the free exercife of religion in their own  
way. When they had purchafed the  
territory of the natives, they granted  
the lands out in townfhips, requiring  
for it neither purchafe-money nor quit«  
rent, but this condition only to be coms  
plied with, that the freeholders fhould  
for’ ever fupport a gofpel minifter  
(meaning probably one of the then go-  
verning feéts) and a free-fchool within  
the townfhip. Thus, what is com-  
monly called Prefbyterianifm became  
the effablifhed religion of that country.  
All went on well in this way while the  
fame religious opinions were general,  
the fupport of minifter and f{chool be-  
ing railed by a proportionate tax on the  
lands. But, in procefs of time, fome  
becoming Quakers, fome Baptifts, and,  
of late years, fome returning to the  
church of England (through the laud-  
able endeavours and a proper applica-  
tion of their funds by the fociety for  
propagating the gofpel), objections  
were made to the payment of a tax ap-  
propriated to the {upport of a church  
they difapproved and had forfaken.  
The civil magiftrates, however, con-  
tinued for a time to colleét and apply  
the tax according to the original laws  
which remained in force ; and they did  
it the more freely, as thinking it juft  
and equitable that the holders of Jands  
fhould pay what was contraéted to be  
paid when they were granted, as the  
only confideration for the grant, and  
what had been confidered by all fub-  
fequent purchafers as a perpetual in-  
cumbrance on the eftate, bought there-  
fore at a proportionably cheaper rate ;  
a payment which it was thought no  
honeft man ought to avoid under the  
pretence of his having changed his re-  
ligious perfuafion. And this I fup-  
pole is one of the beft grounds of de-  
manding tythes of Diflenters now in  
England. But the praétice being  
clamoured againft by the Epifcopalians  
as perfecution, the legiflature of the  
Province of the Mafflachufets - Bay,  
near thirty years fince, paffed an act  
for their relief, requiring indeed the  
tax to be paid as ufual, but direéting  
that the feveral fums levied from mein-  
bers of the church of England, fhould  
be paid over to the minifter of that  
church with whom fuch members u-  
fually attended divine worfhip, which  
minificr had power given him to receive,  
  
and  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Non- appointment of an American Bifsop inveftigated.  
  
and on occafion to recover the fame by  
law.  
  
It feems that Legiflature confidered  
the end of the tax was, to fecure  
and improve the morals of the people,  
and promote their happinefs, by fup-  
porting among them the public wor-  
thip of God, and the preaching of the  
  
ofpel ; that where particular people  
Racied a particular mode, that mode  
might probably therefore be of moft  
ufe to thofe people; and that, if the  
good was done, it was not fo material  
in what mode, or by whom it was  
done. The confideration that their  
brethren the diffenters in England were  
ftill compelied to pay tythes to the  
clergy of the church, had not weight  
enough with the legiflature to prevent  
this moderate a&amp;, which ftill conti-  
nues in full force, and I hope no un-  
charitable conduét of the church to-  
wards the diffenters will ever provoke  
them to repeal it. ,  
  
With regard to a bifhop, I know  
not upon what ground the diffenters,  
either here or in America, are charged  
with refufing the benefit of fuch an  
officer to the church in that country.  
Here they feem to have naturally no  
concern in the affair, There they  
have no power to prevent it, if  
government fhould think fit to fend  
one. They would probably diflike,  
indeed, to fee an order of men efta-  
blifhed among them, from whofe per-  
  
. fecutions their fathers fled into that  
wildernefs, and whofe future domi-  
nation they may poffibly fear, mot  
knowing that their natures are changed.  
But the non-appointmert of bifhops  
for America feems to arife from an-  
other quarter, The fame wifdom of  
government, probably, that prevents  
the fitting of convocations, and for-  
bids, by noli profequi’s, the perfecu-  
tion of diffenters for non-fubfcription,  
avoids eftablithing bifhops where the  
minds of people are not yet prepared  
to receive them, cordially, left the  
public peace fhould be endangered.  
  
And now let us fee how this perfecu-  
tion-account ftands between the parties,  
  
-In New-Englazd, where the legif-  
lative bodies are almoft to a man dif-  
fenters from the church of England,  
  
1. There is no teft to prevent  
churchmen holding offices.  
  
2. The fons of churchmen have the  
full benefit of the univerfities.  
  
3. The taxes for fupport of public  
worfhip, when paid by churchmen,  
are given to the epifcopal minifter.  
  
629  
In Old England,  
  
1. Diffenters are excluded from all  
offices of profit and honour.  
  
2. The benefits of education in the  
univerfities ‘are appropriated to the  
fons of churchmen.  
  
3- The clergy of the diffenters re-  
ceive none of the tythes paid by their  
people, who muft be at the additional  
charge of maintaining their own fepa-  
rate worhip.—  
  
But it is faid, the diffenters of Ames  
yo oppofe the introduction of a bi-  
  
°  
  
In fact, it isnot alone the diffenters  
that give the oppofition, (if mot encou-  
raging muft be termed oppofing) but  
the laity in general diflike the projeét,  
and fome even of the clergy. ‘The  
inhabitants of Virginia are almoft all  
Epifcopalians. The church is fully  
eftablifhed there, and the council and  
general affembly are perhaps toa man  
Its members; yet when lately, at a  
meeting of the clergy, a refolution  
was taken to apply for a bifhop, a-  
gainft which feveral however protetted,  
the affembly of the province, at their  
next meeeing, expreffed their difap-  
probation of the thing in the ftrongeft  
manner, by unanimoufly ordering the  
thanks of the houfe to the pro-  
tefters: for many of the American  
laity of the church think it fome ad-  
vantage, whether their own young  
men come to England for ordination,  
and improve themfelves at the fame  
time by converfation with the learned  
here, or the congregations are fup-  
plied by Englifhmen, who have had  
the benefit ef education in Englifh  
univerfities, and are ordained before  
they come abroad. They do not,  
therefore, fee the neceflity of a bifiop  
merely for ordination; and confir-  
mation is among them deemed a cere-  
mony of no very great importance,  
fince few feek it in England where  
bithops are in plenty. Thefe fenii-  
ments prevail with many churchmen  
there, not to promote a defign which  
they think muft fooner or later faddle  
them with great expences to fupport it.  
As to the diffenters, theirminds might ,  
probably be more conciliated to the  
meafure, if the bifhops here fhould,  
in their wifdom and goodnefs, think  
fit to fet their facred chara&amp;ter in a  
more friendly light, by dropping their  
oppofition to the diffenters application  
for relief in fubfcription, and declar-  
ing their willingnefs that diffenters  
fhould be capable of offices, enjoy the

Underſtand from the public papers, that in the  
debates. on the bill for relieving the Diſſenters  
  
in the point of ſubſcription to the Church Articles,  
ſundry reflections were thrown out againſt the peo-  
ple, importing, that they themſelves are of a  
perſecuting intolerant ſpirit, for that when they  
had the ſuperiority, they perſecuted the church,  
and till perſecute it in America, where they com-  
pel its members to pay taxes for maintaining the  
Preſbyterian or Independent worſhip, and at the

ciſe of their religion, by the adminiſtrations of a  
biſhop. |  
If we look back into hiſtory for the character of  
the preſent ſes in Chriſtianity, we ſhall find few  
that have not, in their turns, been perſecutors and  
complainers of perſecution, The primitive Chriſ-  
tians thought perſecution extremely wrong in the

Proteſtants of the Church of England blamed per-  
ſecution in the Romiſh church, but practiſed it

biſhops, but fell into the ſame practice both here  
and in New England. To account for this, we  
ſhould remember, that the doctrine of toleration  
was not then known, or had not prevailed in the  
world. Perſecution was therefore not ſo much the  
fault of the ſect as of the times, It was not in  
thoſe days deemed wrong in it/e/f. The general  
opinion was only, that thoſe who are in error  
ought not to perſecute the truth : but the poſſeſſors

1 order to deſtroy it. Thus every ſe believing it-  
.

ſelf poſſeſſed of all truth, and that every tenet dif-  
fering from theirs was error, conceived that when  
the power was in their hands, perſecution was a  
| duty required of them by that God whom they  
ſuppoſed to be offended with hereſy.— By degrees  
more moderate and more modeſ{ ſentiments have  
taken place in the Chriſtian world ; and among  
Proteſtants particularly, all diſclaim perſecution,  
none vindicate it, and few practiſe it, We  
ſhould then ceaſe to reproach each other with  
what was done by our anceſtors, but judge of the  
preſent character of ſects or churches by their pre-  
ſent conduct only. |  
  
Now to determine on the juſtice of this charge  
againſt the preſent diſſenters, particularly thoſe in  
America, let us conſider the following facts.  
They went from England to eſtabliſh a new coun-  
try for themſelves, at their own expence, where  
they might enjoy the free exerciſe of religion in  
their own way. When they had purchaſed the  
territory  
  
( 119 )  
  
territory of the natives, they granted the lands out  
in townſhips, requiring for it neither purchaſe-  
money nor quit-rent, but this condition only to  
be complied with, that the freeholders ſhould ſup-  
  
  
the then governing ſects] and a free-ſchool within  
the townſhip. Thus, what is commonly called  
Preſbyterianiſm became the e/abliſhed religion of  
that country, All went on well in this way,  
while the ſame religious opinions. were general, the  
ſupport of miniſter and ſchool being raiſed by a  
  
  
of time, ſome becoming Quakers, ſome Baptiſts,  
and of late years, ſome returning to the Church  
of England (through the laudable endeavours and  
a proper application of their funds by the ſociety  
  
  
to the payment of a tax appropriated to the ſupport  
of a church they diſapproved and had forſaken.  
  
  
time to collect and apply the tax according to the  
original laws which remained in force; and they  
did it the more freely, as thinking it juſt and equit-  
able that the holders of lands ſhould pay what was  
contracted to be paid when they were granted, as  
the only conſideration for the grant, and what had  
been conſidered by all ſubſequent purchaſers as a  
perpetual incumbrance on the eſtate, bought there-  
fore at a proportionably cheaper rate; a payment  
which, it was thought, no honeſt man ought to  
  
avoid, under pretence of his having changed his  
religious  
  
(  
  
religious perſuaſion. And this, I ſuppoſe, is one  
of the beſt grounds of demanding tythes of diſſenters  
now in England. But the practice being clamour-  
ed againſt by the &amp;iſcopalians as perſecution, the  
legiſlature of the province of Maſſachuſets Bay,  
near thirty years ſince, paſſed an act for their re-  
lief, requiring, indeed, the tax to be paid as uſual,  
but directing that the ſeveral ſums levied from  
members of the Church of England, ſhould be paid  
over to the miniſter of that church with whom  
ſuch members uſually attended divine worſhip,  
which miniſter had power given him to receive,  
and, on occaſion, to recover the ſame by law.  
It ſeems that legiſlature conſidered the end of the  
tax was, to ſecure and improve the morals of the  
people, and promote their happineſs by ſupporting  
among them the public worſhip of God and the  
preaching of the goſpel ; that where particular  
people fancied a particular mode, that mode might  
probably therefore, be of moſt uſe to thoſe people;  
and that if the good was done, it was not fo mate-  
rial in what mode or by whom it was done, The  
conſideration that their brethren, the diffenters in  
England, were ſtill compelled to pay tythes to the  
clergy of the church, had not weight enough with  
the legiſlature to prevent this moderate act, which  
ſtill continues in full force, and I hope no uncha-  
ritable conduct of the church toward the diſſenters  
will ever provoke them to repeal it, |  
With regard to a biſhop, I know not upon  
what ground the diffenters, either here or in Ame-  
rica,  
  
($22; }  
  
rica, are charged with refuſing the benefit of ſuch  
an officer to the church in that country. Here  
they ſeem to have naturally no concern in the af-  
fair. There they have no power to prevent it, if  
government ſhould think fit to ſend one. They  
would probably diſlike, indeed, to ſee an order of  
men eſtabliſhed among them, from whoſe perſecu-  
tions their fathers fled into that wilderneſs, and  
whoſe future domination they might poſſibly fear,  
not knowing that their natures are changed. But the  
non-appointment of biſhops for America ſeems to  
ariſe from another quarter. The ſame wiſdom of  
government, probably, that prevents the fitting  
of convocations, and forbids, by noli proſequr&#x27;s, the  
perſecution of Diſſenters for non-ſubſcription,  
avoids eſtabliſhing biſhops where the minds of  
people are not yet prepared to receive them  
cordially, leſt the public peace ſhould be endan-  
gered.  
  
And now let us ſee how this perſecution- account  
ſtands between the parties. 5 N

oppoſe the introduction of a biſhop,  
  
In fact, it is not alone the diſſenters there that  
give the oppoſition (if t encouraging muſt be  
rermed opps/ing) but the laity in general diſlike the  
project, and ſome even of the clergy. The inha-  
bitants of Virginia are almoſt all epifcopalians.  
The church is fully eſtabliſhed there, and the  
council and general aſſembly are, perhaps to a man,  
its members, yet, when lately at a meeting of the  
clergy, a reſolution was taken to apply for a bi-  
ſhop, againſt which ſeveral, however, proteſted ;  
the aſſembly of the province, at the next meeting,  
expreſſed their diſapprobation of the thing in the  
ftrongeſt manner, by unanimouſly ordering the  
thanks of the houſe to the proteſters ; for many of  
the American laity of the church think it ſome ad-

„ find few that have not, in their turns, been perſecutors

* thought perſecution extremely wrong in the Pagans, but

« church of England blamed perſecution in the Romiſh  
« church, but practiſed it againſt the Puritans : theſe found it  
« wrong in the Bithops, but fell into the ſame practice both  
„ in Old and New England. To account for this we ſhould  
&amp; remember, that the doctrine of toleration was not then  
„ known, or had not prevailed in the world. Perſecution &#x27;  
« was therefore not ſo much the fault of the ſect, as of the  
„times. It was not in thoſe days deemed wrong in itſef;  
« the general opinion was only, that thoſe who are in error  
© ought not to perſecute the truth; but the poſſeſſors of truth  
„ were in the right to perſecute error, in order to deſtroy  
&amp;« it, Thus every ſect believing itſelf poſſeſſed of all truth,  
« and that every tenet differing from theirs was error, con-  
« ceived that when the power was in their hands, perſecution  
« was a duty required of them by that God whom they ſup-  
c poſed to be offended with hereſy.—By degrees, more mode-

rica, they have shown, in the northern and middle colo-  
nies of that country, that they have been falsely accused of ob-  
jecting to the introduction of bishops ; and, in New England,  
where the legislative bodies are almost to a man Dissenters from  
the Church of England, there is no test to prevent churchmen  
holding offices. ‘The sons of churchmen have the full benefit of  
the Universities ; and the taxes for support of public worship,  
when paid by churchmen, are given to the Episcopal ministers.  
Allthis would not have been so, if the Dissenters really enter-  
tained that violent hatred against Bishops and Episcopalians, of  
which they are suspected in this country.  
  
We are utterly unacquainted with any thing like an attempt  
against the safety of the Church or State, made by Protestant  
Dissenters, for this century and an half last past. ‘The Corpora-  
tion and ‘Test acts were certainly passed for no such reason,

“ They went from England to establish a new  
country for themselves, at their own expence,  
where they might enjoy the free exercise of re-  
ligion in their own way. When they had pur-  
chased the territory of the natives, they granted  
the lands out in townships, requiring for it neither  
purchase money nor quit-reut, but this condition  
only to be complied with, that the freeholders  
should support a gospel minister and a free  
school within the township. Thus what is com-  
monly cailed Presbyterianism became the estab-  
listed religion of the country. All went on well  
in this way while the same religious opinions  
were general, the support of the minister and  
ecliool being raised by a proportionate tax on the  
lands. Butgein process of time, some becoming  
Quakers, some Baptists, and some of late years,  
returning to the Church of England, objections  
were made to the payment of a tax appropriate  
to the support of a church which they disapprov-  
ed and had forsaken. The civil) magistrates,  
however, continued for a time to collect and  
apply the tax according to the original laws  
wh&#x27;choremained in force ; and they did it the  
more freely, as thinking it just and equitable that  
the holders of lands should pay what was con-  
tracted to be paid when they were granted, as  
the only consideration for the grant, and what  
had then been considered by all subsequent pur-  
chasers as a perpetual incumbrance on the estate,  
bought therefore at a proportionably cheaper  
rate ; a pavment which, it was thought, no hon-  
est man ought to avoid under pretence of his  
havine changed his religious persuasion. And  
this. | suppose, is one of the best grounds of de-  
manding tyvthes of the dissenters now in }) gland.  
But the practice bene clamoured against, by the  
Episcopalians as persecution, the legislature of  
the prevince of Massachusetts Bay, near thirty  
years e&#x27;nee, passed an act for their relief, requir-  
ing. indeed, the tax te be to be paid as usual,  
bni directine that the several sums levied from  
members of the ehnrch’ef England, should be  
paid over to the minister of that church with  
whom such members usnally attended divine  
worship, which minister had power given him  
to receive, and on occasion to recover the same  
by law.  
  
It seems that the legislature considered that  
the end of the tax was to secure and improve the  
morals of the people, and promote their happiness  
by supporting among them the public worship of  
God and the preaching of the gospel ; that where  
particular people fancied a particular mode, that  
mode might probably, therefore, be of most use  
to those people : and that if the good was done,  
it was not so material in what mode or by whom it  
was done. The consideration that their brethren,  
the dissenters in England, were still compelled to  
pay the tythes to the clergy of the church, had  
not weight enough with the legislature to pre-  
vent this moderate act, which still continues in  
full force, and [ hope ro uncharitable conduct of  
the church towards the dissenters will ever pro-  
voke them to repeal it.”
