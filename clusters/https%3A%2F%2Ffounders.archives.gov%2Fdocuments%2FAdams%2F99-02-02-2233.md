				The communications you thought proper to make in your speech to both Houses of Congress, on the opening of their present session, afford additional proofs of the attention, integrity, and firmness, which have always marked your official character.We cannot but approve of the measures you had taken to ascertain the state and decline of the contagious sickness, which has so lately afflicted the city of Philadelphia; and the pleasing circumstances that Congress is now assembled at that place, without hazard to the health of its members, evinces the propriety of your having postpone a determination to convene the National Legislature at another place. We shall take into consideration the law of 1794, on this subject, and will readily concur in any amendment which may be deemed expedient. It would have given us much pleasure to have received your congratulations on the re-establishment of peace in Europe, and the restoration of security to the persons and property of our citizens from injustice and violence at sea. But, though these events, so desirable to our country and the world, have not taken place, yet, we have abundant cause of gratitude to the Great Disposer of human events, for interior tranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons, prosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvement; and, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty, and a calm but steady determination to support our sovereignty against all open and secret attacks.We learn, with satisfaction, that our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic had safely arrived in Europe, and were proceeding to the scene of negotiation; and, whatever may be the result of the mission, we are perfectly satisfied that nothing on your part has been omitted, which could, in any way, conduce to a successful conclusion of the negotiation, upon terms compatible with the safety, honor, and interest, of the United States; and we are fully convinced that, in the mean time, a manifestation of that unanimity and energy of which the People of the United States have given such memorable proofs, and a proper exertion of those resources of national defence, which we possess, will essentially contribute to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice.We think, sir, with you, that the commerce of the United States is essential to the growth, comfort, and prosperity, of our country; and that the faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of commercial and sea-faring, no less than of other citizens. And even if our negotiation with France should terminate favorably, and the war in Europe cease, yet the state of society, which unhappily prevails in so great a portion of the world, and the experience of past times, under better circumstances, unite in warning us that a commerce so extensive, and which holds out so many temptations to lawless plunderers, can never be safe without protection; and we hold ourselves obliged, by every tie of duty which binds us to our constituents, to promote and concur in such measures of marine defence, as may convince our merchants and seamen that their rights are not sacrificed, nor their injuries forgotten.We regret, that, notwithstanding the clear and explicit terms of the treaty between the United States and his Catholic Majesty, the Spanish garrisons are not yet withdrawn from our territory, nor the running of the boundary line commenced. The United States have been faithful in the performance of their obligations to Spain, and had reason to expect a compliance equally prompt on the part of that Power. We still, however, indulge the hope that the convincing answers, which have been given to the objections stated by the Spanish officers, to the immediate execution of the treaty, will have their proper effect; and that this treaty, so mutually beneficial to the contracting parties, will be finally observed with good faith. We therefore entirely approve of your determination to continue in readiness to receive the posts, and to run the lines of partition between our territory and that of the King of Spain.Attempts to alienate the affections of the Indians; to form them into a confederacy, and to excite them to actual hostility against the United States; whether made by foreign agents, or by others, are so injurious to our interests at large, and so inhuman with respect to our citizens inhabiting the adjacent territory, as to deserve the most exemplary punishment; and we will cheerfully afford our aid in framing a law, which may prescribe a punishment adequate to the commission of crimes so heinous.The several objects you have pointed out to the attention of the Legislature, whether they regard our internal or external relations, shall receive from us that consideration which they merit; and we will readily concur in all such measures as may be necessary, either to enable us to fulfil our engagements at home, or to cause ourselves to be respected abroad. And, at this portentous period, when the Powers of Europe, with whom we are connected by treaty or commerce, are in so critical a situation, and when the conduct of some of those Powers towards the United States is so hostile and menacing, the several branches of the Government are, in our opinion, called upon, with peculiar importunity, to unite, and, by union, not only to devise and carry into effect those measures on which the safety and prosperity of our country depend, but also to undeceive those nations who, regarding us as a weak and divided people, have pursued systems of aggression inconsistent with a state of peace between independent nations. And, sir, we beg leave to assure you, that we derive a singular consolation from the reflection that, at such a time, the executive part of our government has been committed to your hands: for, in your integrity, talents, and firmness, we place the most entire confidence.

THE communications you have thought  
proper to make in your fpeecb to both hou­  
ses of Congress, on the opening of their  
feflion, afford additional proofs of the atten­  
tion, integrity and firmnefs which have al­  
ways marked your official charaftcr.  
We cannot but approve of the measures  
you bad taken to ascertain the state and de­  
cline of the contagious licknefs which has  
so lately afflicled the city of Philadelphia,  
and the plealing cireumftance that Congress  
is new affemblcd at that place, without ha­  
zard to the health of its members, evinces  
the propriety of your having postponed a  
determination to convene the National Le­  
giflaturc at any other place—We (hall take  
into conlideratien the law of 1794 on this  
subject, and will readily concur in any a­  
mendmeut which may be deemed expedient.  
It would have given us much pleasure to  
have received your congratulations oh the  
re-establishment of peace in Europe and the  
restoration of security to the person and pro­  
perty of our citizens from injtiftice by sea  
But though these events so desirable to our  
country and the world; have not taken place,  
yet we have abundant cause of gratitude to  
difpofer of human events for inte­  
rior tranquility and personal security, for  
propitious feafona—profperous agriculture,  
produftivefifheries andgeneral improvement,  
and above all, for a rationalfpirit of civil and  
religious libert—and a calm but steady de­  
termination to support our sovereignty a­  
gainst ail open and fccret attacks.  
We learn with fatisfaftion that our En­  
voys Extraordinary to the French Republic  
had fafely arrived in Europe, and were pro­  
ceeding to the scene of negociatiop—and  
whatever may be the result of the million,  
we are perfectly fatufied that nothing 011  
your part has been omitted which could in  
any way conduce to a fuccefsful conclusion  
of the aegociation upon terms compatible  
with the fafety, honour and interest of the  
United States.—And we are fully convinc­  
ed that iu the mean time a manifeftation of  
the unanimity and energy of which the peo­  
ple of the United States have given such  
memorable &quot;proofs, and a proper exertion of  
those resources of national defence which wv  
possess, will e&amp;cntially contribute to the pre­  
servation of peace, and the attainment of  
justice.  
We think, fir, with you, that the com­  
merce of the United States, is effentialto the  
growth, comfort and profperityofour coun­  
try—and that the faith of society is pledged  
for the preservation of the rights of aom­  
mercial and fea-faring, no less than of other  
citixens—and even if our negociation with  
P ranoe flfppli terminate favorably, and the  
war i» -Europe ccafe, yet the state t&gt;f society  
which unhappily prevails in so great a por­  
tion of the world, and the experience of past  
times, under better circumstances, unite in  
warning ns that a commorce so extensive,  
and which holds out so many temptations  
to lawless plunderers can never be fafe with­  
out protcftion and defence—and We hold  
ourselves obliged by every tie of duty which  
binds us to our conllituents, to promote and  
concur in such measures of marine defence  
as may convince our a»d seamen  
that their rights are not facrificed, nor their  
injuries forgotten.  
We regret that notwithstanding the clear  
and explicit terms of the Treaty between  
the United States and his Catholic Majesty,  
the Spanish garrisons are not yet withdrawn  
from our Territory, nor the running ofthe  
boundary line commenced. The United  
States have been faithful in the performance  
of their obligations to Spain, and had rea­  
son to expeft a compliance equally prompt  
on the part as that power. Wi still how­  
ever indulge the hope, that the convincing  
anfwere vifhich have been given to the ob­  
je&amp;ions&#x27;ftated&#x27;by the Spani/h officers, to the  
immediate execution of the Treaty will  
haVe thteir proper effeft, and that this Trea­  
tv, so rrtutilaTfy beneficial to the contracting  
partfes willbefnially observed withgoodfaith.  
We thereforeentirely approve of your deter­  
mination to Continue in readiness to receive  
the posts and to run the line of partition bet­  
ween our territory and that ofthe kingof Spain.  
Attempts to alienate the affections of the  
Indians, to form them into a confederacy,  
and to excite them to aftual holtility against  
| the United States, whetherrnade by foreign  
agents or by others, are so injurious to our  
intereftc at large, and so inlmman with ref­  
pe£l to our citizens inhabiting the adjacent  
  
territory, as to deserve the most exemplary  
punishment, and we will cheerfully afford  
our aid in framing a law which may pres­  
cribe a punishment adequate to the commis­  
sion of crimes so heinous.  
The several obje&amp;s you have pointed out  
to the attention of the Legislature, whether  
ther they regard our internal or external re­  
lations (hall receive from us that attention  
which they merit, and we will readily con­  
cur in all such measures as may be riecefTa­  
ry, either to enable us to fulfil our engage­  
ments at home, or to eaufe ourselves to be  
refpe&amp;ed abroad. And at this portentous  
period, when the powers of Europe, with  
whom we are connected by treaty or com­  
merce, are in so critical &#x27;a situation—And  
when the conduft of some of those powers  
towards the United States, is so hostile and  
menacing, the several branches of the gov­  
ernment are, in our opinion, called upon,  
with peculiar importunity, to unite—And  
by union not only to devise and carry into  
effeft those measures on which the fafety  
and prosperity of our country depend, but  
also to undeceive those nations who regard­  
ing us as a weak and divided people have  
pursued fytlems of aggression iaconiiftent  
with a state of peace betwesn independent  
nations. And, Sir, we beg leave to assure  
you, that we derive a singular consolation  
from the refleftion, that at such a time the  
Executive part of our government has been  
■ committed to your hands. For your integ­

We cannot but approve of the meafures you have

ficknefs which has fo lately afflicted the city of Philadel-  
phia; and the pleating circumfance that Congrefs is  
now affembled at that place, without hazard to the  
health of its members, evinces the propriety of your  
having poftponed a determination to convene the Nati-  
onal Legiflature at another place. We thal! take into  
confideration the Jaw of 1794, on this fubjedt, and  
will readily concur, in any amendment which may be  
deemed expedient. .  
lt wonld have given us much pleafure to have receiv-  
ed your congratulations on the re-eftablifhment of peace  
in Lurope and the reftoration of fecurity to the perfons  
and proverry of our citizens from injuftice and violence

all, for a rational fpitit of civil and religious liberty—  
and a calm but fteady determination to fupport dur fo-  
vereignty, againft all open and fecret attacks.  
We learn with fatisfaction, that our. envoys extraor-

Europe, and were proceeding to the fcene of negoci-  
ation—and wha ever may be the refult of the miflion,

which we poffefs, will effentially contribute to the pre-  
fervation of peace, andthe attainment of juftice.

fotiety is pledged for the prefervation of the rights  
of commercial and fea firing, no lefs than of other  
citizens; and even if our negociations with France  
fhould terminate favourably, and the war in Larope  
ceafe, yet the ftate of fociety, which unhappily pre-  
vails in fo great a portion of the world, and the ex-  
perience cf pail times under better circumfances,  
united in warning us that a commerce fo extenfive  
and which holds out fo many temptations to lawlefs

and we hold ourfelves obliged, by every tie of duty  
which binds us to our conftituents, to promote and  
concor in fuch meafures of marine defence as may  
convince our merchants and feamen that their rights  
are not facrificed, nor their injuries forgotten.

oes terms of treaty between the United States and
