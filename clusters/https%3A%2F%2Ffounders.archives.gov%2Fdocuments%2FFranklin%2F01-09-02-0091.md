osition my mind is very ready to receive, for I have been always at a loss what to think of those transactions. The power of God I should not question, but there the power is Satan’s, who performs miracles upon the Son of God. Jesus consider’d as an omnipresent God had no need of being carried up into on high to see all the kingdoms of the earth, and as man he could not see really them from the summit of the highest mountain, therefore I think the fact appears to be visionary. Besides the shewing him all the Kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them must be visionary, for it is not possible to be real. St. Luke says Jesus, being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness. I know the general acceptation of this expression is that he was guided by the Holy Ghost; but will it not bear interpretation of his being carried thither in a vision? Those who have read the Gospel in the original Language can determine that better than I can. I remember one day while I was at Bromley Mrs. Hawkeworth and I enter’d upon the subject of our Sav

the gracious influences of the Holy Ghost. That the body was thus  
affected is undoubted, for the body was conceived by the Holy Ghost.  
But the influence of the Spirit over the soul is also taught. At the  
baptism of Jesus, we are told that “the Holy Ghost descended in a  
bodily shape, like a dove, upon him.” After the baptism, “Jesus  
being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from Jordan, and was led by  
the Spirit into the wilderness.” After the temptation, “ Jesus re-  
turned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.” At Nazareth, in his  
first recorded public discourse, ‘he found the place where it was  
written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed

In the synagogue on that Sabbath day, as Jesus read and
