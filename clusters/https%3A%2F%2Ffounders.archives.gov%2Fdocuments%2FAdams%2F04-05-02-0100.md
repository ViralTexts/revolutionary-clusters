Sternses observation may be just, but King Richards was a more independant one. God says, he helps those who help themselves. Advise is of little avail unless it is reduced to practise nor ought we implicitly to give upon our judgement to any one what ever may be our regard or esteem for them untill we have weighed and canvassed that advise with our reason and judgment—then if it is right agreable to virtue expedient and prudent we ought strictly to adhere to it—a mutability of temper and inconsistency with ourselves is the greatest weakness of Humane Nature, and will render us little and contemtable in the Eyes of the World.

Simplicity of character is the natural

Since color is the language of har­

cheap material and good color than  
vice versa.  
Art in dress is based on relation?  
the right thing in the right place; jew­

The art of dressing was ruined by  
the invention of needle and scissors;

The monument to Mrs. Benjamin  
Harrison, erected iu Crown Hill ceme­  
tery, Indianapolis, is of Barre granite.  
Its plainness is said to be its chief  
charm. It is seven feet square at the  
base, about ten feet in height, and the  
only inscription which it bears is the  
word &quot;Harrison,&quot; engraved in large  
letters directly above the base. A  
circle of graven oak leaves surrounds  
the shaft about a foot from the top,  
and short Grecian columns are at each  
corner about two feet above the foun­  
dation stone.
