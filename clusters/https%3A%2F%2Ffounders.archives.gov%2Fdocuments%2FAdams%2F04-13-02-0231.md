f Phyllis “lend it an ear.” The fourth part  
laments his “ Disappointment.” The worst has happened. Paridel has  
prevailed, and Corydon, with his affections crushed into his heart, is  
condemned to a single life. Not a stanza in this part but has its special  
beauty. Not a shaft but reaches and penetrates the soul. &lt;A few ex-  
amples may suffice :  
“She was fair—and my passion begun;  
  
She smiled—and | could not but love:  
She is faithless—and I am undone.  
  
  
  
Perhaps I was void of all thought ;  
Perhaps it was plain to foresee  
  
That a nymph so complete would be sought  
By a swain more engaging than me.  
  
Beware how you loiter in vain  
  
Amid nymphs of a higher degree ;  
It is not for me to explain  
  
How fair and how fickle they be.  
  
Alas! from the day that we met,  
What hope of an end to my woes?  
When I cannot endure to forget  
The glance that undid my repose,  
Yet time may diminish the pain:  
The flower and the shrub and the tree,  
Which I reared for her pleasure in vain,  
In time may have comfort for me
