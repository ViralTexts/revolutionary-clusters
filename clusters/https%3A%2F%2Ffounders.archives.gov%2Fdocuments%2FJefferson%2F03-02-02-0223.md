r both parties. to the President it will be really inconvenient; but to the nation I do not know that it can do serious injury, unless we were to believe the newspapers which pretend that mr Gallatin will go out. that indeed would be a day of mourning for the US. but I hope that the position of both gentlemen may be made so easy as to give no cause for either to withdraw.   
			 the ordinary business of every day is done by  
			 consultation  
			 between the President &amp; the head of the department alone to which it belongs. for measures of importance or difficulty a consultation is held with the heads of departments, either assembled, or by taking  
			 their opinions separately in conversation, or in writing. the latter is most strictly in the spirit of the constitution. because the President, on weighing the advice of all, is left free to make up an opinion for himself. in this way they are not brought together, &amp; it is not necessarily known to any what opinion the others  
			 have given.  
			 this was Genl Washington’s practice for the first two or three years of his administration, till the affairs of France &amp; England threatened to embroil us, and rendered consideration &amp; discussion desirable.  
			 in these discussions, Hamilton &amp; myself were daily pitted in the cabinet like two cocks. we were then but 4. in number, and, according to the majority, which of course was of three to one, the President decided. the pain was for Hamilton &amp; myself, but the public experienced no inconvenience. I  
			 practised this last method, because the harmony was so cordial among us all, that we never failed, by a contribution  
			 of mutual views, of the subject, to form an opinion acceptable to the whole. I think there never was one instance to the contrary in any case of consequence.  
			 yet this does in fact transform the executive into a Directory, and I hold the other method to be more constitutional. it is better calculated too to prevent collision &amp; irritation, and to cure it, or at least suppress it’s effects when it has already  
			 taken place
