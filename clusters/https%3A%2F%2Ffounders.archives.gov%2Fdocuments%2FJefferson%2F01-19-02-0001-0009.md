came up last night, and left town  
this morning. The general impression now  
is, that the Island will be evacuated in a very  
few days. Whether the force there assem­  
bled will make a descent upon Canada, or  
come to this side, and disband, we are unable  
to say; but incline to the belief that the lat­

much to be desired. In the present situation  
of Canada, with no Patriot force embodied in  
any part of it, it would be a desperate under­  
taking for the Navy Islanders to land. They  
might be able to do something, but the chan­  
ces are very much against them.

that then Congress should sit in the new city yet to

Baltimore came to being the final selection, may be  
judged from the fact that, on June 28th, 1790, the  
Senate voted on the claims so strenuously put forward

both Senators from Maryland, oddly enough, voting, as
