Fellow citizens of the Senate &amp; House of Representatives.  
It is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me, that on meeting the great council of the nation, I am able to announce to them, on grounds of reasonable certainty, that the wars and troubles, which have for so many years afflicted our sister-nations, have at length come to an end; and that the communications of peace and commerce are once more opening among them. whilst we devoutly return thanks to the beneficent being who has been pleased to breathe into them the spirit of conciliation and forgiveness, we are bound, with peculiar gratitude, to be thankful to him that our own peace has been preserved through so perilous a season, and ourselves permitted quietly to cultivate the earth, and to practise and improve those arts which tend to increase our comforts. the assurances indeed of friendly disposition recieved from all the powers, with whom we have principal relations, had inspired a confidence that our peace with them would not have been disturbed. but a cessation of the irregularities which had afflicted the commerce of neutral nations, and of the irritations and injuries produced by them, cannot but add to this confidence; and strengthens at the same time, the hope that wrongs committed on unoffending friends, under a pressure of circumstances, will now be reviewed with candor, and will be considered as founding just claims of retribution for the past, and new assurance for the future.  
Among our Indian neighbors also a spirit of peace &amp; friendship generally prevails; and I am happy to inform you that the continued efforts to introduce among them the implements and the practice of husbandry and of the houshold arts have not been without success: that they are become more and more sensible of the superiority of this dependance, for clothing and subsistence, over the precarious resources of hunting and fishing: and already we are able to announce that, instead of that constant diminution of numbers produced by their wars and their wants, some of them begin to experience an increase of population.  
To this state of general peace with which we have been blessed, one only exception exists. Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary states, had come forward with demands unfounded either in right or in compact, and had permitted itself to denounce war, on our failure to comply before a given day. the style of the demand admitted but one answer. I sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean, with assurances to that power of our sincere desire to remain in peace; but with orders to protect our commerce against the threatened attack. the measure was seasonable and salutary. the Bey had already declared war in form. his cruisers were out. two had arrived at Gibralter. our commerce in the Mediterranean was blockaded; and that of the Atlantic in peril. the arrival of our squadron dispelled the danger. one of the Tripolitan cruisers having fallen in with, and engaged the small schooner Enterprize, commanded by Lieut. Sterritt, which had gone out as a tender to our larger vessels, was captured, after a heavy slaughter of her men, without the loss of a single one on our part. the bravery exhibited by our citizens on that element will, I trust, be a testimony to the world, that it is not a want of that virtue which makes us seek their peace; but a conscientious desire to direct the energies of our nation to the multiplication of the human race, and not to its destruction. unauthorised by the constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing further hostilities, was liberated with it’s crew. the legislature will doubtless consider whether, by authorising measures of offence also, they will place our force on an equal footing with that of it’s adversaries. I communicate all material information on this subject, that in the exercise of the important function, confided by the constitution to the legislature exclusively, their judgment may form itself on a knolege and consideration of every circumstance of weight.  
I wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary states was entirely satisfactory. discovering that some delays had taken place in the performance of certain articles stipulated by us, I thought it my duty, by immediate measures for fulfilling them, to vindicate to ourselves the right of considering the effect of departure from stipulation on their side. from the papers which will be laid before you, you will be enabled to judge whether our treaties are regarded by them as fixing at all the measure of their demands, or as guarding, against the exercise of force, our vessels within their power: and to consider how far it will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in their present posture.  
I lay before you the result of the census lately taken of our inhabitants, to a conformity with which we are now to reduce the ensuing ratio of representation and taxation. you will percieve that the increase of numbers during the last ten years, proceeding in geometrical ratio, promises a duplication in little more than twenty two years. we contemplate this rapid growth, and the prospect it holds up to us, not with a view to the injuries it may enable us to do to others in some future day, but to the settlement of the extensive country still remaining vacant within our limits, to the multiplication of men, susceptible of happiness, educated in the love of order, habituated to self-government, and valuing it’s blessings above all price.  
Other circumstances, combined with the increase of numbers, have produced an augmentation of revenue arising from consumption in a ratio far beyond that of population alone: and tho the changes in foreign relations, now taking place so desireably for the whole world, may for a season affect this branch of revenue, yet weighing all probabilities of expence, as well as of income, there is reasonable ground of confidence that we may now safely dispense with all the internal taxes, comprehending excises, stamps, auctions, licenses, carriages and refined sugars: to which the postage on newspapers may be added to facilitate the progress of information: and that the remaining sources of revenue will be sufficient to provide for the support of government, to pay the interest of the public debts, and to discharge the principals in shorter periods than the laws, or the general expectation had contemplated. war indeed and untoward events may change this prospect of things, and call for expences which the impost could not meet. but sound principles will not justify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which might not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered by that treasure.  
These views however of reducing our burthens, are formed on the expectation that a sensible, and at the same time a salutary reduction may take place in our habitual expenditures. for this purpose those of the civil government, the army and navy, will need revisal. when we consider that this government is charged with the external and mutual relations only of these states, that the states themselves have principal care of our persons, our property, and our reputation, constituting the great field of human concerns, we may well doubt whether our organisation is not too complicated, too expensive; whether offices and officers have not been multiplied unnecessarily, and some times injuriously to the service they were meant to promote. I will cause to be laid before you an essay towards a statement, of those who, under public employment of various kinds, draw money from the treasury, or from our citizens. time has not permitted a perfect enumeration, the ramifications of office being too multiplied and remote to be compleatly traced in a first trial. among those who are dependant on Executive discretion, I have begun the reduction of what was deemed unnecessary. the expences of diplomatic agency have been considerably diminished. the Inspectors of internal revenue, who were found to obstruct the accountability of the institution, have been discontinued. several agencies, created by Executive authority, on salaries fixed by that also, have been suppressed, and should suggest the expediency of regulating that power by law, so as to subject it’s exercises to legislative inspection and sanction. other reformations of the same kind will be pursued with that caution which is requisite, in removing useless things, not to injure what is retained. but the great mass of public offices is established by law, and therefore by law alone can be abolished. should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in review, and to try all it’s parts by the test of public utility, they may be assured of every aid and light which Executive information can yield. considering the general tendency to multiply offices and dependancies, and to increase expence to the ultimate term of burthen which the citizen can bear, it behoves us to avail ourselves of every occasion, which presents itself, for taking off the surcharge; that it never may be seen here that, after leaving to labour the smallest portion of it’s earnings on which it can subsist, government shall itself consume the residue of what it was instituted to guard.  
In our care too of the public contributions entrusted to our direction, it would be prudent to multiply barriers against their dissipation, by appropriating specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible of definition; by disallowing all applications of money varying from the appropriation in object, or transcending it in amount; by reducing the undefined field of contingencies, and thereby circumscribing discretionary powers over money; and by bringing back to a single department all accountabilities for money, where the examinations may be prompt, efficacious, and uniform.  
An account of the reciepts and expenditures of the last year, as prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury, will as usual be laid before you. the success which has attended the late sales of the public lands shews that, with attention, they may be made an important source of reciept. among the payments, those made in discharge of the principal and interest of the national debt, will shew that the public faith has been exactly maintained. to these will be added an estimate of appropriations necessary for the ensuing year. this last will of course be effected by such modifications of the system of expence as you shall think proper to adopt.  
A statement has been formed by the Secretary at war, on mature consideration of all the posts and stations where garrisons will be expedient, and of the number of men requisite for each garrison. the whole amount is considerably short of the present military establishment. for the surplus no particular use can be pointed out. for defence against invasion, their number is as nothing. nor is it considered needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up, in time of peace, for that purpose. uncertain as we must ever be of the particular point in our circumference where an enemy may chuse to invade us, the only force which can be ready at every point, and competent to oppose them, is the body of neighboring citizens, as formed into a militia. on these, collected from the parts most convenient, in numbers proportioned to the invading force, it is best to rely, not only to meet the first attack, but, if it threatens to be permanent, to maintain the defence until regulars may be engaged to relieve them. these considerations render it important that we should, at every session, continue to amend the defects, which from time to time shew themselves, in the laws for regulating the militia, until they are sufficiently perfect: nor should we now, or at any time, separate until we can say we have done every thing, for the militia, which we could do, were an enemy at our door.  
The provision of military stores on hand will be laid before you, that you may judge of the additions still requisite.  
With respect to the extent to which our naval preparations should be carried some difference of opinion may be expected to appear: but just attention to the circumstances of every part of the Union will doubtless reconcile all. a small force will probably continue to be wanted, for actual service, in the Mediterranean. what ever annual sum beyond that you may think proper to appropriate to naval preparations, would perhaps be better employed in providing those articles which may be kept without waste or consumption, and be in readiness when any exigence calls them into use. Progress has been made, as will appear by papers now communicated, in providing materials for seventy-four-gun ships as directed by law.  
How far the authority given by the legislature for procuring and establishing sites for naval purposes, has been perfectly understood and pursued in the execution, admits of some doubt. a statement of the expences already incurred on that subject is now laid before you. I have in certain cases, suspended or slackened these expenditures, that the legislature might determine whether so many yards are necessary as have been contemplated. the works at this place are among those permitted to go on: and five of the seven frigates directed to be laid up, have been brought and laid up, here, where, besides the safety of their position, they are under the eye of the executive administration, as well as of it’s agents, and where yourselves also will be guided by your own view, in the legislative provisions respecting them, which may from time to time be necessary. they are preserved in such condition, as well the vessels as whatever belongs to them, as to be at all times ready for sea on a short warning. two others are yet to be laid up, so soon as they shall have recieved the repairs requisite to put them also into sound condition. as a superintending officer will be necessary at each yard, his duties and emoluments, hitherto fixed by the Executive, will be a more proper subject for legislation. a communication will also be made of our progress in the execution of the law respecting the vessels directed to be sold.  
The fortifications of our harbours, more or less advanced, present considerations of great difficulty. while some of them are on a scale sufficiently proportioned to the advantages of their position, to the efficacy of their protection, and the importance of the points within it, others are so extensive, will cost so much in their first erection, so much in their maintenance, and require such a force to garrison them, as to make it questionable what is best now to be done. a statement of those commenced, or projected, of the expences already incurred, and estimates of their future cost as far as can be foreseen, shall be laid before you, that you may be enabled to judge whether any alteration is necessary in the laws respecting this subject.  
Agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation, the four pillars of our prosperity, are then most thriving when left most free to individual enterprize. protection from casual embarrasments however may sometimes be seasonably interposed. if in the course of your observations or enquiries, they should appear to need any aid, within the limits of our constitutional powers, your sense of their importance is a sufficient assurance they will occupy your attention. we cannot indeed but all feel an anxious solicitude for the difficulties under which our carrying trade will soon be placed. how far it can be relieved, otherwise than by time, is a subject of important consideration.  
The judiciary system of the United States, and especially that portion of it recently erected, will of course present itself to the contemplation of Congress. and that they may be able to judge of the proportion which the institution bears to the business it has to perform, I have caused to be procured from the several states, and now lay before Congress, an exact statement of all the causes decided since the first establishment of the courts, and of those which were depending when additional courts and judges were brought in to their aid.  
And while on the Judiciary organisation, it will be worthy your consideration whether the protection of the inestimable institution of juries has been extended to all the cases involving the security of our persons and property. their impartial selection also being essential to their value, we ought further to consider whether that is sufficiently secured in those states where they are named by a marshal depending on Executive will, or designated by the court, or by officers dependant on them.  
I cannot omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the subject of naturalization. considering the ordinary chances of human life, a denial of citizenship, under a residence of fourteen years, is a denial to a great proportion of those who ask it; and controuls a policy pursued, from their first settlement, by many of these states, and still believed of consequence to their prosperity. and shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitives from distress, that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land? shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? the constitution indeed has wisely provided that, for admission to certain offices of important trust, a residence shall be required, sufficient to develope character and design. but might not the general character and capabilities of a citizen be safely communicated to every one manifesting a bonâ fide purpose of embarking his life and fortunes permanently with us? with restrictions perhaps to guard against the fraudulent usurpation of our flag; an abuse which brings so much embarrasment and loss on the genuine citizen, and so much danger to the nation of being involved in war, that no endeavor should be spared to detect and suppress it.  
These, fellow citizens, are the matters, respecting the state of the nation, which I have thought of importance to be submitted to your consideration at this time. some others of less moment, or not yet ready for communication, will be the subject of separate messages. I am happy in this opportunity of committing the arduous affairs of our government to the collected wisdom of the Union. nothing shall be wanting on my part to inform, as far as in my power, the legislative judgment; nor to carry that judgment into faithful execution. the prudence and temperance of your discussions will promote, within your own walls, that conciliation which so much befriends rational conclusion: and by it’s example, will encourage among our constitutents that progress of opinion which is tending to unite them in object and in will. that all should be satisfied with any one order of things is not to be expected: but I indulge the pleasing persuasion that the great body of our citizens will cordially concur in honest and disinterested efforts, which have for their object to preserve the general and state governments in their constitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain peace abroad, and order and obedience to the laws at home, to establish principles and practices of administration favorable to the security of liberty and property, and to reduce expences to what is necessary for the useful purposes of government.

Fellow -citizens &lt;4 the Senate,  
  
and of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
It is a circumftance of fin-  
  
cere gratification to me, that on  
meeting, the great council of the  
nation, 1 am able to announce to  
them on grounds o! reafonable cer-  
tainty, that the wars and troubles  
which have for fo many years  
affli&amp;ted our fifter natiens, have at  
length come to an end ; and that  
the communications ef peace and  
commerce are once more opening  
among them. Whilft we devout-  
ly return thanks to the beneficent  
being, who has been pleafed to  
breathe into them the fpirit of con-  
ciliation and forgiveneis, we are  
bound, with .peculiar gratitude, to  
be thankful to him that our own  
peace has been preferved through  
fo perilous a feafon, and ourfelves  
permitted quietly to cultivate the  
earth, and to practife and improve  
thofe arts which tend to increafe  
our comforts. The affarances in-  
deed of friendly cifpoStion received  
from all the powers with whom we  
have principal relations, had infpi-  
  
  
  
Congrefioual Proceedings. 43  
  
red a confidence, that our peace  
with them wovld not have been  
difturbed. Buta ceflation of the  
irregularities which had affliéted  
the commerce of neutral nations,  
and of the irritations and injuries,  
produced by them, cannot but add  
to this confidence : and {trengthens  
at the fame time, the hope that  
wrongs committed on unoffending  
friends, under a prefsure of  cir-  
cumftances, will now be reviewed  
with candor, and will be contider-  
ed as tounding juft claims of re-  
tribution forthe paft, and new af-  
furances forthe future.  
  
Among our Indian neighbors al-  
fo a {pirit of peace and friendfhip  
generally prevails ; and I am hap-  
py to iniorm you that the continu-  
ed efforts to introduce among  
them the implements and the prac-  
tice of hufbandry, and of the houfe-  
hold arts, have not been without  
fuccets: That they are become  
moreand more fenfible of the fupe-  
riority of this dependance, for  
cloathing and fubfiftence, over the  
precanions refources of hunting  
and fifhing: And already we are  
enabled to announce that, inftead  
of that conftant diminution of their  
numbers produced by their wars  
and their wants, fume of them be-  
gin to experience an increale of  
population.  
  
To this ftate of general peace  
with which we have been bleffed,  
one only exception exifts. Tripo-  
li, the leatt cunfiderable of the  
Barbary ftates, had eome forward  
with demands untounded either in  
right or in compact, and had per-  
mitted ifelf to denounce war, on  
our failure to comply before a  
given day. The ftyle of the de-  
mand admitted but one anfwer.

vedat ‘Gibraltar. Our commerce  
in the Sidiliewvane ean,was blocka-  
ded; and that of the Atlantic in  
peril. The arrival of ovr fqua-  
dron difpelled the danger. One of j  
the Tripolitan eruifers having fal-  
len in with and engaged the imall  
fchooner Enterprize, commanded  
by Lieut. Sterret, which had gone  
out asa tender to our larger vel-  
fels, was captured, after a heavy  
flaughter of her men, without the  
lofs of a fingle one on our part.  
The bravery exhibited by our citi-  
zens on that element, will, I truft,  
bea teftimony to the world, that t  
it is not a want of that virtue  
which makes us feek their peace ;  
but a confcientious defire to direct

fet this branch of revenue, yet  
weighing all probabilities of ex-  
pence, as well as of inceme, there  
js reafonable ground oi confidence  
  
that we may now fafely difpenfe  
with all the internal taxes, com-  
prehe nding excifes, ftamps, auc-  
tions, licences, carriages, and re-  
fined fugar: to which the poftage  
on newtfpapers may be added to  
facilitate the progrefs of informa-  
tion :and that the remaining four-  
ces of revenue will be fufficient to  
provide for the fupport of govern-  
ment, to pay the intereft of the  
pub lic debts, and to diicharge the  
principals in fhorter peric ods than  
the laws, or the general expecta-  
tion had contemplated. War, in-  
deed, and antoward events may  
change this profpect of things, and  
cali for expences which theimpofts  
could not meet. But found prin-  
ciples will not juftify our taxing  
the induftry of our fellow-citizens :  
to accumulate treafure for wars to  
happen we know not when, and  
which might not, perhaps, happen,  
but from the temptations offered  
by that treafure.  
  
Thefe views, however, of re-  
ducing our burthens, are formed  
on the expe@ation, that a fenfible,  
and at the fame time, a falutary re-  
dufion may take piace in our ha-  
bitual expenditures, For thts pur-  
pofe, thofe of the civil government,  
the army and navy, will need revi-  
fal. When we confider that this  
government is charged with the  
external and mutual relations oaly  
of thefe ftates ; that the ftates  
themfelves have principal care of  
our perfons, our property, and  
our reputation ; conftiuting the  
great field of human concerns, we  
may weil doubt whether our orga-  
nization is not too complicated,  
too expenfive ; whether offices and

public employment of various  
kinds, draw money from the trea-  
fury, or from our citizens. Time  
has not permitted a perfect enure-  
ration, the ramifications of office  
being too multiplied and remote to  
be completely traced in a firft trial

alfo, have been fupprefied, and  
fhould fuggeft the expediency of  
reguiating that power by law, fo  
as to fubjed¢t its exercifes to legifla-  
tive in{pection and fanction. O-  
ther reformations of the fame kind  
will be purfued with that caution  
which is requifite, in removing

any aid, within the limits of our  
conftitutional powers, your feufe  
of their importance is a fufficient  
affurance they will occupy your  
attention. We cannot, indeed,  
but all feel an anxious folicitude  
for the difficulties under which our  
carrying trade will foon be placed.  
How far it can be re! ieved, other-  
wife than by time, is a fubjeat of  
important confideration.

and of thofe which were depending  
when additional courts and judges  
were brought in, to their aid.  
  
And while on the yudicary or-  
ganization, it wil be worthy your  
confideraiton whether the protec-  
tion of the imeti:mab:e inftitution  
of juries has Deen extended to all  
the cafes involving the fecurity of  
our perfons and property. Their  
impartial felection,alfo being eflen-  
tial to their value, we ought fur-  
ther to confider whether that is fuf-  
ficiently fecured in thofe ftates,  
where they are named by a mar-  
ftial depending on executive will,  
or defignated by the court, or by  
officers dependent on them.  
  
{ cannot omit recommending a  
revilal of the laws on the fubieé of  
naturalization. Confidering the  
ordinary chances of human life, a  
denial of citizenthip under a refi-  
dence of fourteen years, is a denial  
to a great proportion of thole wio  
afk it; and controls a policy pur-  
fued, irom their firlt fettlement, by  
many of thefe States, and {till be-  
lieved of confequence to their pro/-  
perity. And fhall we refufe to the  
unhappy fugitives from diftrets,  
that hofpitalicry which the favages  
of the wilderne{s extended to ourfa-  
thers arriving in this land? Shall  
ppprefled humanity find no afylum  
on this globe?) The Conft&#x27;tution,  
indeed, has wifely provided that,  
for admifiion to certain offices of  
important truft, a refidence thali be  
required, fuficient to develope cha-  
racter and defign. but might not  
the general character and capabili-  
ties of a citizen be fafely commu-  
nicated to every one manifefting a  
bona fide purpofe of embarking his  
lite and fortunes permanently with  
us? with reftrictions, perhaps to  
guard againft the-fradulent ufur-

brings fo much embarraiiment and  
  
Congrefienal Preceedings.  
  
lofs on the genuine citizen, and fo  
much danger to the nation of be.  
ing involved in war, that no en.  
deavor fhould be ipared to dete@  
asd fupprefs it.  
  
Thele, fellow-citizens, are the  
matters, refpecting the flate of the  
nation, which I have thought of  
importance to be fubmitted to your  
confideration at this time. Some  
others of iefs moment, are not yer  
ready for communication, will be  
the fubject of feveral meflaves. |  
am happy in this opportunity of  
committing theardous affairs of our  
gevernment-to the collected wif  
dom of the union, Notiing fhall  
be wanting-on my part to inform,  
as far as is in my power, the legil-  
lative judgment; nor to carry that  
judgment intu faithiul execution.  
The prudence and temperance of  
your diicuffions will promote,  
within your own waiis, that con-  
‘iiation whieh fo much beiriends  
rational conclufion; and by its ex.  
ampie, will encourage among our  
conftituents that progres of opini-  
on woich is tending to unite them  
in objet and in will. That all  
fliould be fatisfied with any one  
order oi things is not to be exped.-  
ed; but 1 indulge the pleating per-  
fuafion that the great body of our  
citizens, will cordially coacur in  
honeft and difinterefted efforts,  
which have for their objeé to pre-  
ferve the general and ftate govern-

and equilibrium ; to maintain peace  
abroad, and order and obedience  
to the laws at home; to eflablith  
principles and practices of admini-

of liberty and property, and to re-

for the ufeful purpofes of govern-

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives,  
  
IT is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me, that  
on meeting the great council of the aation, I am able to an-  
nounce to them on grounds of reasonable certainty, that the  
wars and troubles, which have for so many years afflidied

our sister nations, have at length come to an end; and that  
the communications of peace and commerce are once more  
Opening among them. Whilst we devoutly return thanks  
to the beneficent being who has been pleased to breathe in-  
to them the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness, we are  
bound, with peculiar gratitude, to be thankful to him that  
our own peace has been preserved through so perilous a  
Season, and ourselves permitted quietly to cultivate the  
earth, and to practise and improve those atts’which tend to  
increase our comforts. The assurances indeed of friendly  
‘disposition received from all the powers with whom we  
have grincipal relations, had inspired a confidence that our  
peace. with them would not have been disturbed. “Bat a  
cessation of the irregularities which had affliéted the com-  
merece of neutral nations, and of the ifritattons and injuries  
produced by them, cannot but add to this confidence; and  
strengthens at the same time, the hope that wrongs commit.  
ted on unoffending friends, under a pressure of circumstan-  
ces, will now be reviewed with candor, and will be consi-  
dered as founding just claims of retribution’ for the past,  
and new assurances for the future.  
  
“Among our Indian neighbours also, a spirit of peace and  
friendship generally prevails; and 1 am happy to inform  
“you that the continued efforts to introduce among them the  
‘amplements and the practice of husbandry, and of the house-  
hold arts, have not been without success:—That they are

dependence for clothing and subsistance, over the préca-  
Yious resources of hunting and fishing: And already we  
are enabledto announce that, instead of that constant dimi-  
nution of numbers produced by their wars and their wants,  
some of them begin to experience an mcreaseof popula.  
tion. ;  
  
To this state of general peace with which we have been  
blessed, one only exception exists. Tripoli, the least con-  
siderable of the Barbary states, had come forward with de-  
mands unfounded either in right or compatt, and had per-  
mitted itself to denougce war, on our failure to comply be-  
fore a given day. style of the demand admitted but

sour commerce against the threatened attack. The measure  
was seasonable and salutary. The Bey had already declar-  
ed war in form, His cruisers were out. ‘Ewo had arriy.  
ed at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the Mediterranean was  
blockaded; and that of the Aiantic in peril. The arrival  
of our squadron dispelled the danger. One of the Tripo-  
litan cruisers having fallen in with and engaged the small  
schooner Enterprize, commanded by Lieutenant Sterret,,  
which had gone out as a tender to our larger vessels, was  
  
Captured, after a heavy slaughter of her men, without the  
  
loss of a single one on our part. The bravery exhibited  
by our citizens on that element will, I trust, be a testimony  
to the world, that it is not a want of that virtue whiah makes  
us seek their peace; but a conscientious desire to dire&amp; the  
energies of our nation to the multiplication of the human  
  
race; and not to its destrugtion. Unauthorized by the  
  
Constitution, without the sanétion of Congress, to go be-  
yond the line of defence, the vessel being disabled from  
¢ommitting further hostilities, was liberated with its crew.  
The legislature will doubiless consider whether, by autho~  
rizing measures of offence also, they will place our force on  
an equal foeting with that of its adversaries. I communi.  
cate all material information on this subje&amp;, that im the ex-  
ercise of the important function, confided by the constitu-  
tion to the legislature exclusively, their judgment may form  
uself on a knowledge and consideration of every cireum-  
stance of weight. .  
  
I wish I could say that our situation with all the other  
Barbary states was entirely satisfactory. Discovering that  
  
‘some delays had taken piace in the performance of certain  
  
articles stipulated by us, I thought it my duty, by immedi-  
ate measures for fuiSlling them, to vindicate to ourselves  
the right of considering the effect of departure trom stipu-  
  
_Jation on their side. From the papers which will be laid  
  
before you, you will be enabled to judge whether our trea-  
ties are {regarded by thera as fixing at all the measure of  
their demands, or as guarding against the exercise to force  
our vessels within their power; and to consider how. far it  
will be safe and expedient to Jeave our affairs. with them in  
their present posture.

our inhabitants, to a conformity with which we are to re«  
duce the ensuing rates of representation and taxation. You  
will perceive that the encreas¢ of numbers, curing the last  
ten years, proceeded in geometrical ratio, promises a du-  
plication in little more than twenty-two vears. We contem-  
plate this rapid growth, and the prospeét it holds up to us,  
not with a view to the injuries it may enable us to do to  
others in some future-day, but to the settlement of the ex-  
tensive country still remaining vacant within our limits,  
to the multiplication of men, susceptible of happiness,  
educated in the love of order, habituated to self-govern-  
ment, and valuing its blessings above all price.  
  
Oiler circumstances, combined with the imcrease of  
numbers, have produced an augmentation of revenue aris-  
ing from consumption, in a ratio far beyond that of popu-  
. Tation alone ; and though the changes in foreign relations,  
now taking place so desirably for the whole world, may  
for a season affe&amp; this branch of revenue, yet, weighing  
all probabilities of expence, as well as of income, there  
is reasonable ground of confidence that we may now safe-  
ly dispense with all the internal taxes, comprehending ex-  
cises, stamps, auctions, licences, carriages and refined su-  
gars: to which the postage on newspapers may be added  
to facilitate the progress of information: and that the re-  
maining sources of revenue will be sufficient to provide  
for the support of government, to pay the interest of the  
public debts, and to discharge the principals in shorter  
periods than the laws, er the general expediation had con-  
templated. War, indeed, and untoward events may change  
this prospeét of things, and cal! for expences which the im-  
posts could not meet. But sound principles will not jus-  
tify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accu-  
mulate treasure for wars to happen we know-not when,  
and which might not perhaps, happen, but from the temp.  
tation offered by that treasure.  
  
These views, however, of reducing our burthens, are  
formed on the expeétation, that a sensible, and at the same  
time, a salutary redution may take place in our habitual  
expenditures. For this purpose, those of the civil go-  
vernment, the army and navy, will need revisal. When  
we consider that this government is charged with the ex-

ternal and mutual relations only of these states; that the.  
states themselves have principal care of our persons, our.  
property. and our reputation; const&#x27;tuting the great field of  
uman concerns, we may well doubt whether our organt-  
zation is not too complicated, too expensive; whether offi-  
ces and officers have not been multipled unnecessarily, and  
some times injutiously to the service they were meant to  
promote. I will cause to be laid before you an essay to-  
wards a statement, of those who, under public employ-  
ment of various kinds, draw money from the treasury, or  
from our citizens. Time has not permitted a perfeét enu-  
meration, the ramifications of office being too multiplied  
and remote, to be compleatly traced in a first trial ~Among  
those who are dependant on executive discretion, I have  
, begun the reduttion of what was deemtd unnecessary.  
The expences of diplomatic agency have been considerably  
diminished. The inspe@tors of the internal revenue, who  
were found to obstruét the accountability of the institution,  
have ‘been discontinued.—Several agencies, created by ex-  
ecutive authority, on salaries fixed by that also, have been  
suppressed, and should suggest the expediency of regulat-  
ing that power by law, so as to subjeét its exercises to le.  
gislative inspection and sanction. Other reformations of  
the same kind will be pursued, with that caution which is  
requisite, in removing useless things, not to injure what  
is retained.&quot; But the great mass of public offices are establish.  
ed by law, and therefore, by law alone can be abolished,  
Should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll ia  
review, and to try all its parts by the test of public utility,  
they may be assured of every aid and light which execu.  
tive information can yield. Considering the general ten~  
dency to multiply offices and dependencies, and to increase  
expence, to the ultimate term of burthen which the citi-  
zens can bear, it behoves us to avail ourselves of every  
occasion which presents itself tor taking off the surcharge  
that it never may be seen here, that, atrer leaving to la-  
bour the smallest portion of its earnings on which it can  
subsist, government shall uself consume the residue of  
what it was instituted to guard. ;  
  
In our care too of the public contributions entrusted to,  
eur-direction, it would be prudent to multiply barriers  
against their dissipation, by appropriating specific sums te

. An account of the receipts and expenditures of the last  
  
year as prepared by the secretary of the Treasury, will,  
as usual, be laid before you. The success which has at-  
tended the late sales of the public lands shews that, with  
attention, they may be made an important source of re-  
ceipt. Amongthe payments, those made in discharge of  
the principal and interest cf the national debt, will shew  
that the public faith has been exaély maintained. To  
these will be added an estimate of appropriations necessary  
forthe ensuing year. This last will, of course be affected  
by such modifications of the system of expence as you shall  
think proper to adopt.  
  
° A statement has been formed by the secretary at war, on  
mature consideration of all the posts and stations where  
garrisons will be expedient, and of the number of men  
requisite for each garrison. ‘The whole amount is con-  
siderably short of the present military establishment. For  
the surplus no particular use cam be pointed out. For de-  
fence against invasion, their number is as nothing; ner is  
it considered needful or safe that a standing army should  
be kept up in time of peace, for that purpese. Uncertain  
as we must ever be of the particular point in our circum-  
ference where an enemy may chuse to invade us, the only  
force which can be ready at every point, and competent  
to oppose them, isthe body of neighboring -citizens, as  
formed into a militia. On these coliected trom the parts  
most convenient, in numbers proportioned to the _invad-  
ing force, it is best to rely not only to meet the first at-  
tack, but if it threatens to be permanent, to maintain the  
defence until regulars may be engaged to relieve them,

With respect to the extent to which our naval prepara-

expected to appear: but just attention to the circumstances  
of every part of the union will doubtless reconcile all.—A  
small force will probably continue to be wanted, for. aétual

‘beyond that you may think proper to apprepriate to naval  
preparations, would perhaps be better employed in provi&lt;

consumption, and be in readiness when any exigence calls  
them into use. Progress has been made, as will appear by

of some doubt. A statement of the expences already incur-

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives.  
It is a- circumllance of hnc.erc grati­  
fication to me, that on meeting the great  
council of the nation, I am&#x27; aiple to an­  
nounce to them on grounds of reafona­  
ble certainty, that the. wars and trou­  
bles, which for fo&#x27; m&#x27;auy years af­  
flidled our fitter nation?., have at length  
come to an end ; and that the cdmumni­  
eations of; peace and commerce are once  
jnore opening among th*m. VVhilfc we  
devoutly return thanks to thfc beneficent  
heiijig who has been pleafed to breathe in­  
to them the fpir.it of conciliation and for­  
• g&#x27;wnefs, we are bound, with peculiar  
&#x27;r&#x27;-mitiide, to be thankful to him that  
our own peace has been picfejpe:&#x27;.&#x27;  
&#x27; through fo perilous a fealon, and our­  
felves permitted quietly to cultivate the  
sarth, and to prad\ife and improve thofe  
arts which tend to increafe our coiuforts.  
The aflurances indeed of friendly difpo­  
fition received fro*i all the powers v/ith  
whom we have principal relations, had  
infpired a confidence that our peate with  
them would not have been diiturbed.  
But a ceffation of the irregularities  
had afilifted the commerce of  
neutral nati&#x27;ons, and of the irritations  
and injuries produced by them, cannot  
but add to this confidence ; and ftreng­  
thens at the fame time, the hope that  
•wrongs committed • 011 unoftending  
Viends, under a preffurc of circiimftan­  
ces, will now be reviewed with can­  
dor, and will be confidered as founding  
juftclaims of retribution for the paft, and  
new afTurance for the future.  
Among our Indian neighbors alfo a  
fpirit of peace and friendihip generally  
prevails ; and I am happy to inform ycu  
that the continued efforts to introduce  
aiuoiig them the implements and theprac­  
tic| of hufbandry, arid of the houfehold  
arts,have not been withoutfuccefs: &#x27;1 hat  
they are become more and more feiifible  
of the fuperiority of this dependance for  
clothing and fubfiftence, over the preca­  
rious refources of hunting and fifhing :  
And already we are able to announce  
that, infteadof that conftant diminution  
of numbers produced by their wars and &#x27;  
their wants, fome&#x27; of them begin .to ex­  
perience an increafe of pcpulation.  
To this ftate of general peace with  
which we have been Melted, one only  
exception exifts. Tripoli, the leait con­  
futable of the Barbary ftates, had come  
forward with demands unfounded either  
in right or in compacl, and had permitted  
itfelf to denounce war, on our failure  
to comply before a given day. The ftyie  
of the demand admitted but one aufwer.  
I fent a frnall fquadron of frigates into  
the Mediterranean.,, v/ith afiurances to  
that power of our Lincere defire to re­

falatary. The had already declared

Two had arrived at Gibraltar. Our  
commerce in the Mediterranean was  
blockaded ; and that of the Atlantic in

hibited by our citizen., on that element  
will, I truft, be a teliiaiony to the world,  
that it is not a want of that virtue which  
makes us feek their peace ; but a con­  
fcientious defire to diredl the energies of  
our nation to the multiplication of the  
human race ; and not to itj defcrUtiliou.  
Unauthorized by. the conftitution, with­  
out the fancVion of Congrefs, to go be­  
yond the line of defence, the ye {Tel be­  
ing difabled from committing further  
hofiilities, was liberated, with its crew:  
The legii&#x27;lntuve will doubtlels confider  
whether, by authorizing meafurcs cf

an equal footing with that of its adver­  
faries. Icommunicate al! material infor­

tirely latisfa£tory. Difcovering that  
lome delays bad taken place in the per­  
formance of certain articles flipulated by  
us, I thought it my duty, by immediate  
meafures for fulfilling them, to vindicate  
to ourislves the right of conlidering the  
effe£l of departure from fiipulation on  
their-fide. From the papers which will  
be laid before you, you will be enabled  
to jddge whether our treaties arc regard­  
ed by them as fixing at all the meafure  
of their demands, or as guarding again!!  
the. exercife of force our vefl&#x27;els within  
their power ; and to confider h®w far  
it will be fafe and expedient to leave our  
affair* with them in their prefent pollute.  
I lay before you the refalt of the  
cenfus lately taken of our inhabitants,  
to a conformity with which we are to  
reduce the enluing rates of reprefenta­  
tion and taxation. You will perceive  
that the encreale of numbers, during the  
lafl; ten years, proceeding in gedmetrical  
ratio, promifes a duplication in little  
more than twenty-two years* We. con­  
template this rapid growth, and the prof­  
peft it holds up to us,&#x27; not with a view  
&#x27; to the injuries it may enable us to do to  
■ others in fome future day, but to the  
fettlement of the extenfive coun:vy flill  
remaining va&#x27;cant within our limits, to  
. the multiplication of men, fufceptibfe of  
- happinefs, educated in the love of order,  
habituated to felf-government, and valu­  
i ing its blefiings above all price.  
Other ci.rcuulftant es, combined with  
the increafc of numbers, have produced  
an augmentation of revenue arifing from  
confumption, in a ratio far beyond that  
■ of population alone ; and though the  
■ changes in foreign relations, now taking  
place fo delirably for the whole world,  
may for a feafon affedl this branch of  
revenue, yet,&#x27; weighing all probabilities  
• of expencc, as well as of income, there  
is reaforable ground, of confidence that  
we may now fafely difpenl&#x27;e with.all the  
internal taxes, comprehending cxcifes,  
ftamps, au&amp;iorrs, licences, carriages and  
refined fugars : to which the poftage on  
newfpapers may be added to facilitate  
the progrefs of information: and that  
the remaining fources of revenue will be  
fufficient to provide for the fupport of  
government, to pay the intcrett of the  
public debts, and to discharge the prin­  
cipals in Ihorter periods than tjje laws,  
or the general expe&amp;alion had contem­  
plated. War, indeed, and untoward  
events may change thisprofpeft of things,  
and call for expences \Vhich the imports  
could not meet. But found principles  
will not juftify our taxing the induftry  
of our fellow Citizens to accumulate  
treafure for wars to happen we know  
not when, and which might not, per­  
haps, happen, but froift the temptations  
offered by that treafure.  
Thefe views, however, of reducing  
our burthens, are formed on the expec­  
tation, that a fenfiblej and at the fame  
time, a falutary redu&amp;ion may take place  
in&quot; our habitual expenditures. For this  
purpole, thofe of the civil government,  
. the army and navy, will need revi­  
fal. When we confider that this go­  
vernment is charged with the external  
i and mutual relations only of thefe Rates ;  
I that the ftates tbemfelves have principal  
. care of our perfons, our property, and  
our reputation ; conftituting the great  
field of human concerns, we may well  
r doubt whether our organization is not  
tco complicated, too expenlive; whether  
; offices and officers have not been multi­  
■ plied unnecelFarily, and fometimes inju­  
[ rioufiy to the fervice they were meant to  
promote. I will caufe to be laid before  
you an effay towards a ftitement, of thofe  
who, under public employment of vari­  
i ous kinds, draw money from the trea­  
&gt; fury, or from our citizens. Time has  
. not permitted a perfect enumeration, the  
. ramifaftious of office being too multi-  
J plied awl remote to be compleatly traced  
1 in a firft trial—Among thofe who are  
{ dependant on executive discretion, I  
. have begun the reduction of what was  
r deemed unneceftary. The expences of  
s diplomatic agency have been conlidera­  
i bfy diminilhed. The intpedtors of in­  
tern at .revenue, who were found to  
- obftrudt the accountability of the in­  
i flitution, have heen difcontinued.—  
■, Several agencies, created by Executive  
h authority, on falaries fixed by that alfo,  
*, have been fupprefled, and Ihowld fuggeft  
  
the expediency of regulating tlifct pow-;  
erby law, fo a&#x27;: to fubjeft its exerciies  
to iegillative inlpeftion and fan ft ion.  
Other reformat!ins of the fame kind  
will be purfued with that caution which  
l is requdite, in removing ufelefs things,  
! not to injure what is retained. But the  
great mai&#x27;s ofpublicoffices is eftablilhed by  
law, and therefore by law alone can beabo­  
lifhed. Should the legislature think if ex­  
pedient to pals this roll in review, and to  
try all its parts by the teft of public utility,  
they may be allured of every aid and  
light which executive information Can  
yield. Confidering the general tenden­  
cy to multiply offices and de[ ideiicies,  
knd to incresfe expence to the ultimate  
term of burthen which the citizen can  
bear, it behoves us to avail ourfelves of  
every occafion which prefents itfelf for  
taking off the furcharge ; that it never  
may be feen here that, after leaving to  
labour the fmaHcft portion of its earn­  
ings on Which it can iublift, government  
lhall itfelf con fume the refidue of what  
it was inftituted to guard.  
Jn our.care too of the public contri­  
butions entrufted to our direction, it  
would be prudent to multiply barriers  
againft by appropriating  
fpecific films to every fpecific parpofe fuf­  
ceptible of definition: by difallcwing all  
applications ef money var)ing from the  
appropriation in objeft or tranfeending  
it in . amotint; by reducing the unde­  
fined field of contingencies, and there­  
by circumscribing difcretionary pow­  
ers over money; and &quot;by bringing  
back to a! fißgle department all account­  
abilities for money, where the examina­  
tion may be prompt, efficacious and uni­  
form.  
An account of the receipts and expen­  
ditures of the la ft year, as prepared by  
the fecretarv of the Treafury, will, as  
ufual, be laid before you. The fuccefs  
. which fias attended the late fales of the  
public lands (hews that, with attention,  
they may be made an important fource  
of receipt. Among the payments, thofe  
made in difcharge of the principal and  
ihterefi:&#x27; of the national debt, will Ihew  
that the public faith has been exactly  
maintained. To thefe will be added an  
eilimate of appropriations for  
the enfuing year. This laft will of courfe  
be a(le£ted by fuch modifications ot the  
fyftem of expence as you lhall think pro­  
per to adopt. ,  
A ftatement has been formed by the  
Secretary at war, on mature confide­  
ration of all the pofts and ftations where  
garrifons will be expedient, and of the  
number of men requifite for each garri­  
fon.&#x27; The whole amount is coniiderably  
fhort of the prefent military eftablilh­  
rnent„ For thefurplus no particular life  
can be pointed out. For defence againft  
invafion, their number is as no­  
thing ; nor is it coniidered needful or  
fafe that a Standing army Ihould be  
kept up, in time of peace, for that pur­  
pofe. Uncertain as we muft ever be of  
the particular point in our circumference ;  
where an enemy may chufe ta. invade us, &#x27;  
the only force which can be ready at eve- I  
ry point, and competent to oppofethem,  
is the body of neighboring citizens, as !  
formed into a militia.&#x27; On thefe collect­  
ed from the parts moll convenient, in  
numbers proportioned to the invading  
force, it is belt to rely not only to meet  
the firft attack, but if it threatens to be  
permanent, to maintain the defence un­  
til regulars may be engaged to relieve  
them. Thefe confiderations render it  
important that Ave Ihould, at every feffi­  
on, continue to amend the defeats, which  
from time to time Ihew themfelves, in  
the laws/or regulating the militia, until  
they are fufficiently perfect : nor Ihould :  
we nOw, or at any time, feparate, until |  
we can fay we have done every thing for  
the militia, which we could do, were an  
enemy at our door.  
The provifion of military ftores on  
hand will be laid before you, that you  
nmy judge of the additions ftill requifite.  
With refpeft to the extent to which  
our naval preparations Ihould be carried,  
foine difference of opinion may be ex­  
pedled to appear: but juft attention to  
the tircumftances of every part of the  
union will doubtlefs reconcile all. A i  
fmail force Avill probably continue to ,  
be wanted, for afilual fervice, in the !  
Mediterranean. &quot;Whatever annual fum  
beyond that you may think proper j  
to appropriate tb naval preparations, |  
would perhaps be better employed in pro- I  
viding thofe articles which may be kept !  
without wafte or consumption, and be  
in readinefs when any exigence calls |  
them into ufe. Progrefs has been made,  
as will appear by papers now communi­  
cated, in providing materials for i&#x27;eventy­  
foUr-gun fhips as directed bylaw.  
How far the authority given by the  
legiflature for procuring and eftabliftfing  
iites for naval purpofes, has been per­  
feclly underfiood and purfued in the exe­  
cution, admits of foine doubt. A ftate­  
ment of the expences already incurred  
on that fubjedl fhall be laid before you.  
T have in certain cafes, fulpended or  
flackened thefe expenditures, that the  
legillature might determine whether lo  
many yards are neccffary as have been  
centemplated. The works at this place  
are among thofe permitted to go on :  
and five of thefeven frigates dlretted to  
be laid up, have been brought and laid  
up here, where, befides the fafety of  
their poiition, they are under the eye  
of the executive admtnifiration, as well j  
  
as of its agent;,, and v. hcreyourfelycs auo

ceived the repairs requifite to put them  
alio into found condition. As a fuper­  
intending officer will be necefiary at each

to fixed by the Executive, will be a more

much in their firft erection, fo muft in  
their maintenance, and require luch a

Agriculture, manufactures, commerce,

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
and of the House of Representatives.  
  
Ir is a circumstance of sincere gratifica-  
tion to me, that on meeting the great  
council of the nation, 1 am able to an-  
nounce to them, on grounds of reasonable  
certainty, that the wars and troubles,  
which have for so many years afflicted our  
sister nations, have at length come to an  
end; and that the communicatiens of peace  
and commerce are once more opening  
among them. Whilst we devoutly return  
thanks to the Beneficent Being, who has  
been pleased to breathe into them the spi-  
rit of conciliation and forgiveness, we are  
bound, with peculiar gratitude, to be  
thankful to him that our own peace has  
been preserved through so perilous a sea-  
son, and ourselves permitted quietly to  
cultivate the earth, and to practise and im-  
prove those arts which tend to increase our  
comforts. The assurances indeed of friend-  
ly disposition received from all the powers  
with whom we have principal relations,  
had inspired a confidence that our peace  
with them woul not have been disturbed.  
But a cessation of the irregularities which  
had afflicted the commeree of neutral  
nations, and of the irritations and injuries  
produce@ by them, cannot but add to this  
«&lt;onfidence; and strengthens at the same  
time, the hope that wrongs committed on  
unoffending friends, under a pressure of  
circumstances, will now be reviewed with  
candour, and will be considered as found-  
ing just claims of retribution for the past,  
and new assurances for the future.  
  
Among our Indian neighbours also a  
spirit of peace and friendship generally  
prevails; and I am happy to inform you  
that the continued efforts to introduce a-  
mong them the implements and the prac-  
tise of husbandry, and of the houshould  
arts, have not been without success : That  
they are become more and more sensible  
of the superiority of this dependence for  
cloathing and subsistence, over the preca-  
rious resources of hunting and fishing ;—  
and already we are able to announce,  
that instead of that constant diminution of  
numbers produced by their wars and their  
wants, some of them begin to experience  
an increase of population.  
  
To this state of general peace with which  
we have.been blessed, one only exception  
exists.—-Tripoli, the least considerable of  
the Barbary states, had come forward with  
demands unfounded either in right or in  
compact, and had permitted itself to de-  
nounce war, on our failure to comply before  
a given day. The stile of the demand admit-  
ted but one answer. I sent a small squadron

of frigates into the Mediterranean, with as-  
surances to that power of sincere desire to  
remain in peace ; but with orders to protect  
our commerce against the threatened at-  
tack. The measure was seasonable and sa-  
lutary. The Bey had already declared war  
in form. His cruisers were out. Two  
had arrived at Gibralter. Our commerce  
in the Mediterranean was blockaded, and  
that of the Atlantic in peril. The arrival  
of our squadron dispelled the danger. One  
ofthe Tripolitan cruisers having fallen in  
with and engaged the small schooner Enter-  
prize, commanded by Lieutenant Sterret,  
which had gone out as a tender to our lar-  
ger vessels, was captured, after a heavy  
slaughter of her men, without the loss of a  
single one on our part. The bravery exhi-  
bited by our citizens on that element, will,  
I trust, be a testimony to the world, that  
it is not a want of that virtue which makes  
us seek their peace; but a conscientious  
desire to direct the energies of our nation  
to the multiplication of the human race;  
and not to its desiruction. Unauthorized  
by the Constitution, without the sanction of  
Congress, to go beyond the line of de-  
fence, the vessel being disabled from com-  
mitting further hostilities, was liberated  
with its crew. The Legislature will  
doubtless consider, whether, by authoris-  
ing measures of offence also, they will  
place our force on an equal footing with  
that of its adversaries. 1 communicate all  
material information on this subject, that  
in the exercise of the important function,  
confided by the Constitution to the Legis-  
lature exclusively, their judgment may  
form itself on a knowledge and considera-  
tion of every circumstance of weight.  
  
I wish I could say that our situation  
with all the other Barbary states was en-  
tirely satisfactory. Discovering that some  
delays had taken place in the performance  
of certain articles stipulated by us, I tho’t  
it my duty, by immediate measures for  
fulfilling them, to vindicate to ourselves  
the right of considering the effect of depar-  
ture from stipulation on their side. From  
the papers which will be laid before you,  
you will be enabled to judge whether our  
treaties are regarded by them as fixing at  
all the measure of their demands, or as  
guarding against the exercise of force on our  
vessels within their power ; and to consid-  
er how far it will be safe and expedient to  
leave our affairs with them in their present  
postyre. :  
  
I lay before you the result of the Census  
lately taken of our inhabitants, to a con-  
formity with which we are to reduce the  
  
  
  
45  
  
tion. You wilkperceive that the increase  
of numbers during the last ten years, pro-  
ceeding in geometrical ratio, premises a  
a duplication in little more than twenty-  
two years. We contemplate this rapid  
growth, and the prospect it. hold up to us,  
not with a view to the injuries it may ena-  
ble us to do to others in some future day,  
but to the settlement of the extensive  
country still remaining vacant within oor  
limits, to the multiplication of men, sus-  
ceptible of happiness, educated in the love  
of order, habituated to self-government,  
aud valuing its blessings above all price.  
Other circumstances, combined with the  
increase of numbers, have produced an  
augmentation of revenue arising from con-  
sumption, in a ratio far beyond that of po-  
pulation alone; and though the changes in  
foreign relations now taking place, so de-  
sirable for the whole world, may for a sea-  
son affect this branch of revenue, yet,  
weighing all probabilities of expence, as  
well as of income, there is reasonable  
ground of confidence that we may now  
safely dispense with all the internal taxes,  
comprehending excises, stamps, auctions,  
licences, carriages and refined sugars: to  
which the postage on newspapers may be  
added, to facilitate the progress of informa-  
tion : and that the remsining sources of re-  
venue will be sufficient to provide for the  
support of government, to pay the interest  
of the public debts. and to discharge the  
principals in shorter periods than the laws,  
or the general expectation had contempia-  
ted. War, indeed, or untoward events  
may change this prospect of things, and  
cal] for expences which the imposts could  
not meet. But sound principles will not  
justify our taxing the industry of our fellow-  
citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to  
happen we know not when, and which  
might not, perhaps, happen, but from the  
temptations offered by that treasure.  
s These views, however, of reducing our  
burthens, are formed on the expectation  
that a sensible, and at the same time a sal-  
utary reduction may take place in our ha-  
bitual expenditures. For this purpose,  
those of the civil government, the army  
and navy, will need revisal. When we  
consider that this government is charged  
with the external and mutual relations on-  
ly of these states; that the states themselves  
have the principal care of our persons, our  
property and eur reputation ; constituting

y to the service they were meant to pro-  
moic. I will cause to be laid before you  
an essay towards a statement of those,  
who, under public employment of various  
kinds, draw money from the treasury, or  
from our citizens. Time has not permit-  
ted a perfect enumeration, the ramifica-  
tions of office being too multiplied and re-  
mote to be completely traced in a first tri-  
al_-Among those who are dependent on  
Executive discretion, I have begun the re-  
duction of what was deemed unnecessary,  
The expences of diplomatic agency have  
been considerably diminished. The inspec-  
tors of internal revenue, who were found to  
obstruct the accountability of the institu-  
tion, have been discontinued.—Several a-  
gencies, created by Executive authority,  
on salaries fixed by that also, have been  
suppressed, and should suggest the expedi-  
ency of regulating that power by law, so  
as to subject its exercises to Legislative  
inspection and sanction. Other reforma-  
tions of the same kind will’ be pursued  
with that caution which ts requisite, in re-  
moving useless things, not to injure what  
is retained. But the great mass of public  
offices is established by law, and therefore  
by law alone can be abolished. Should  
the Leyislature think it expedient to pass  
this roll in review, and to try all its parts  
iy the test of public utility, they may be  
assured ofevery aid and light which Execu-  
tive information ean yield. Considering  
the general tendency to muitiply offices  
and dependencies, and to increase expence  
to the ultimate term of burthen which the  
citizen can bear, it behoves us to avail  
ourselves of every occasion which presents  
itself for taking off the surcharge; that it  
never may be seen here that, after leaving  
to labour the smallest portion of its earn-  
ings on which it can subsist, government  
shall itself consume the residue of what  
it was instituted toguard.  
  
In our care too of the public contribu-  
tions, entrusted to our direction, it would  
be prudent to multiply barriers against  
their dissipation, by appropriating specific  
sums to every specific purpose susceptible  
of definition: by disallowing all applica-  
tions of money varying from the appropri-  
ation in object, or transcending it in a-  
mount, by reducing the undefined field of  
contingencies, and thereby circumscribing  
discretionary, powers over money ; and by  
bringing back to a single department all  
accountabilities for money, where the ex-  
amination may be prompt, efficacious and  
uniform.  
  
An account of the receipts and expendi-  
tures of the jast year, as prepared by the  
  
  
  
Secretary of the Treasury, will, as usual,  
be laid before you. The success which  
has attended the late sales of the public  
lands, shews that, with attention, they  
may be made an important source of re-  
ceipt. Among the payments, those made  
in discharge of the principal and interest  
of the national debt, will shew that the  
public faith has been exactly maintained.  
To these will be added an estimate of ap-  
propriations, necessary for the ensuing  
year. This last will of course be affected  
by such modifications of the system of ex-  
pence as you shall think proper to adopt.  
  
A statement has been formed by the  
Secretary at war, on mature consideration  
of all the posts and stations where garri-  
sons will be expedient, and of the number  
of men requisite for each garrison. The  
whole amount is considerably short of the  
present military establishment. For the  
surplus, no particular use can be pointed  
out. For defence against invasion, their  
number is as nothing ; nor is it considered  
needful or safe that a standing army should  
be kept up in time of peace for that pur-  
pose. Uncertain as we must ever be of  
the particular point in our circumference,  
where an enemy may chuse to invade us,  
the only force which can be ready at eve-  
ry point, and competent to oppose them,  
is the body of neighbouring citizens, as  
formed intoa Militia. On these collected  
from the parts most convenient, in numbers  
proportioned to the invading force, it is  
best to rely, not only to meet the first at-  
tack, but if it threatens to be permanent, to  
maintain the defence until regulars may be  
engaged to relievethem. These consider-  
ations render it important that we should,  
at every session, continue to amend the  
defects, which from time to time shew  
themselves, in the laws for regulating the  
militia, until they are sufficiently perfect :  
nor should we now, or at any time, sepa-  
rate, until we can say we have done eve-  
ry thing for the militia, which we could do,  
were an enemy at our door.  
  
The provision of military stores on hand,  
will be laid before you, that you may judge  
of the additions still requisite.  
  
With respect to the extent to which  
our nava! preparations should be carried,  
some difference of opinion may be expec-  
ted to appear; but just attention to the  
circumstances of every part of the union,  
will doubtless reconcile all. A small  
force will probably continue to be wanted,  
for actual service in the Mediterranean.  
Whatever annual sum beyond that you  
may think proper to appropriate to naval  
preparations, would perhaps be better em-  
  
  
  
  
  
ployed in providing those articles which  
may be kept without waste or consump-  
tion, and be in readiness when any exi-  
gence calls them into use. Progress has  
been made, as will appear by papers now  
communicated, in providing materials for  
seventy-four gun ships, as directed by  
law.  
  
How far the authority given by the Le-  
gislature for procuring and establishing  
scites for naval purposes, has been perfect-  
ly understood, and pursued in the execution,  
admits of some doubt. A statement of the  
expences already incurred on that subject  
shall be laid before you. I have in certain  
cases, suspended or slackened these expen-  
ditures, that the Legislature might deter-  
mine whether so many yards are necessary  
as have been contemplated. The works  
at this place are among these permitted to  
go on: and five of the seven frigates direct-  
ed to be laid up, have been brought and  
laid up here, where, besides the safety of  
their position, they are under the eye of  
Executive adininistration, as well as its  
agents, and where yoursélves alse will be  
guided by your own view, ‘in the legisla-  
tive provisions respecting them, which may  
from time to time be necessary. They are  
preserved in such conditon, as well the ves-  
sels as whatever belongs to them, as to be  
at all times ready for seaon a short warning.  
Two others are yet to be laid up so soon  
as they shall have received the repairs  
requisite to put them alsoin a sound con-  
dition. Asasuperintending officer will be  
necessary at each yard, his duties and emo-  
luments hitherto fixed by the Executive,  
will bea more proper subject for Leyisla-  
tion. A communication will also be made  
of our progress in the execution of the law  
respecting the vessels directed to be sold,  
  
The fertifications of our harbours, more or  
less advanced, present considerations of  
great difiiculty. While some of them are  
on a scale sufficiently proportioned

f our con-  
stitutional powers, your sense of their im-  
portance, is a sufficient assurance they will  
occupy your attention. We cannot, indeed,  
but all feel an anxious solicitude for the  
difficulties under which our carrying trade  
willsoon be placed. How far it can be  
relieved, otherwise than by time, is a sub-  
ject of important consideration.  
  
The judiciary system of the United  
States, and especially that portion of it re-  
cently erected, will of course present it-  
sclf to the contemplation of Congress;  
and that they may be able to judge of the  
propoftion which the institution bears to  
the business it has to perform, I have cau-  
sed to be procured from the several states,  
and now lay before Congress, an exact  
statement of all the causes decided since  
the first establishment of the courts, and  
of those which were depending, when ad-  
ditional courts and judges were brought in  
to their aid.  
  
And while on the judiciary organization,  
it will be worthy your consideration, whe-  
ther the protection of the inestimable in-  
stitution of juries has been extended to all  
the cases involving the security of our per-  
sons and property. Their impartial se-  
lection also being essential to their value,  
we ought further toconsider whether that  
is sufficiently secured in those states, where  
they are named by a marshal depending on  
executive will, or designated by the court,  
or by officers depending on them.  
  
1 cannot omit’ recommending a revisal  
of the laws on the subject of naturalization.  
Considering the ordinary chances of hu-  
man life, a denial of citizenship under a  
residence of fourteen years, is a denial to  
2 great proportion of those who ask it; and  
controls a policy pursued, from their first  
settlement, by many of these states, and  
still believed of consequence to their pros-  
perity. And shall we refuse to the unhap-  
py fugitives from distress, that hespitality  
which the savages of the wilderness extend-  
ed to our fathers arriving in this land ?—  
Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum  
on this globe? The Constitution, indeed,  
has wisely provided that, for admission to  
certain offices -of important trust, a resi-  
dence shall be required, sufficient to deve-  
lope character anddesign. But might not

citizen he safely communicated to every |

one manifesting bona fide purpose of em-  
barking his life and fortunes permanently  
with us? With restrictions, perhaps, to guard  
against the fraudulent usurpation of our  
flag; an abuse which brings so much embar-  
rassment and loss on the genuine citizen,  
and so much danger to the nation of being  
involved in war, that no endeavour should  
be spared to detect and suppress it.  
  
These, fellow-citizens, are the matter  
respecting the state of the nation, which I  
have thought of importance to be submit-  
ted .to your consideration at this time.—  
Some others of less moment, not yet  
ready for communication, will be the sub-  
ject of separate messages. I am happy in  
this opportunity of committing the arduous  
affairs of our government to the collected  
wisdom of the union. Nothing sball be  
wanting on my part to inform, as far as in  
my power, the Legislative judgment, or to  
carry that judgment into faithful execution.  
The prudence and temperance of your dis-  
cussion will promote, within your own  
walls, that conciliation which so much be-  
friends rational conclusion ; and by its ex-  
ample, will encourage among our con-  
stituents that progress of opinion which  
is tending to unite them in object and  
will. That all should be satisfied with any  
one order of things is not to be expected ;  
but I indulge the pleasing persuasion that  
the great body of our citizens will cor-  
dially concur in honest and disinterested  
efforts, which have for their object to pre-  
serve the general and state goverments in  
their constitutional form and equilibrium; to  
mainiain peace abroad, and order and obe-  
dience to the laws at home; to establish  
principles and practices of administration  
favourable to the security of liberty and  
property, and to reduce expences to what  
is necessary for the useful purposes of  
government.

which might not perhaps, happen, but from  
  
the temptations peered by that treasure,

burthens are formed on the expectation,  
that a sensible, &quot;and at the same trme,.a sa-;  
lutary reduction may take place in our habi­  
tual expenditures. ,For this purpose, those  
of t lie civil government, the army and navy,  
vill need revisal. When we consider that  
this government is charged with the external  
and mutual relation only of these states;  
that the states themselves have principal care  
of our pertojis, our property, and our repu­

Felloxv Citizens of tbe Senate, and of the ,  
Houfe of Repr&#x27;fentutiwi,  
IT is a circumftante of liocere gratification  
to me, that on meeting the great council of  
.the nation, I am able to announce t® them on  
ground* of re^fonahle certainty, that the wars  
and uoublet, which have for ft* many yeats al­  
. fiiiJbd our filler nations, have at length come to  
• an end ; &amp; that the communications of pe ice &amp;  
commerce a&gt;e once more opening among them.  
Whilft we devoutly return thanks to the benefi  
cent being who has been pleafed to 1 °athe into  
them the fpint ot conciliation unci ivenefs,  
we are bound with peculiar grati to be  
ihankfnl to him that our own , ;e has  
t eeu prtferved through fo perilous a feaf n, a d  
ou fclves permitted quietly to cultivate the  
earth, and to piadife and improve thofc aits  
wh chtenJ to inerfeafe our comforts. The aft  
furntu.es indeed of friendly difpofiti n received  
tiosi ail the powers with whom we have pr’n  
cipal relations, had infpired a confidence th^t  
.oil&#x27; peace with them would not have been dif  
turbed. Bur a ceffation of the irregularities  
wlvch had afflitfed ihe commerce of neutral  
natrons, and of the irritations and injuries pro­  
duced by them, cant ot but add to tins corfi  
dence ; and (lengthens, at the fame time, &#x27;he  
hope, that wrongs committed on unoffending  
liiends, under a prefftire ol circumftancts. will  
now be reviewed with candor, and will be con  
fidired as founding juft claims of retr bution  
for the pa ft, and r.exv alftu» ar.ee for the futtr e­  
Among or.r Indian neighbor* alfo a Ipirr« of  
peace and IrienJIhip generally prevails ; and  
1 am happy &#x27;o inform you that the continued  
effort* to i troducc among, them ’he imp emesis  
and .he pra&amp;ice ofhulbandry, and of the houfe  
hold arts, have not been with &#x27;U* iuccefs : Th »t  
J they are become more and more fenfible ot tne  
fuperiDr.ty of this dependence lor clothing and  
fubfiitence, over the p ec^rious refources of  
hunting *nd fiflrng : &lt;-\nd already we are abie  
to announce that, infield of that c mllant di  
m nuti&#x27; n of numbers produced by their wars  
ai d their wants, fome ol them beg a to expe !  
pence an in.rcafe ©f population.  
To .hi* ft ale of ieeiie:al peace with which  
we have be n bleffcd, one only exception exiiU.  
&#x27;Tripoli, the lead cot fiber able of the Baibavy  
itaie*, had come fmward wsth demands uo  
ft unded either in ?i,_ht or in compact, a;vd bad  
permitted itffelf to denounce war, ou our failure  
ro comply before a given day. The ftyle ol  
the demand admitted hut one anfwer. I ftnt  
a fmall fquadron of frigates into ihe Mediter­  
ranean, with alfti.anccs i &gt; ihat power of our  
iinceze delire to reman ui iwacc ; but v itb  
orders to protect our c mrnerce agouti the  
ih eatcneJ attack. The mcaiure w.,s fcufonable  
and ftilutary, The Bey had already declared  
war in form. H&gt;s c:uif:rs were out. Two had  
arrived at Gibeah ,r. Our commerce in the  
■Mediterranean was blockaded ; and that &lt;&gt;l the  
Atlantic in perl. The arrival of our fquadron  
i fp .lie i the danger. One of the T ipdttat*  
cruder* having lalien in wi h a:d tr.gaged the  
fmail ichoenci Ihitcrpriae, comm tad* I by Lt.  
&#x27; Stcrrei, which had gene out as a tender to our  
Urger veifels, w*s capered, after a heavy  
daughter of her men, withou thelofsofa lingle  
one on our part. The braveiy exhib tel by  
our citizens on that element will, I trull, be a  
teftim ny to the world, that it is not a want oi  
that virtue, which makes u&gt; f ek their peace y  
but a confcierv ions delire ro &lt;3»rc&lt;5t the ei erg res  
.of our nation to tbe multiplication of the hu  
man race ; and not in its delbutfion. Unau­  
thorized by th* conftifuti»&gt;n, without the fane  
tion of Congiefs, to go beyond the line of de  
fence, the veffel being difabled from commit­  
ting further hoiii i.ies, was liberated with it* j  
crew.  
The legifltture will doubtiefs confider w*he- J  
ther, by au horil’ng meafures of offence alfo,  
ihcy will place our force en an equal looting  
with that of its adverfarie*. I communicate all  
material information on this fubjoft, that in the  
cxeicife o’ the important function confided by j  
the Conftitution to the leg.iluure exclufively,  
ihcT judgement may form itfelf on a know,  
leige and coniidcration of every ciicumftaoce  
of weight.  
  
I wun l could lay that cur utua&#x27;ion wiui an  
the other Barbery States was entirely fatisfafio­  
ry D fcoverng that fume delays had take*  
place in the performance of certain articles  
ftipulated by us, I thought it my duty by im  
mediate meafures for fulfilling them, to vindi  
cate to oudelves the right of confidering the  
rffe&amp;of departure from ftlpula ion on he&gt;r fit le­  
r 4*i&quot;m the pape&gt;s which will be laid bef ^re you,  
’ vt*i will be enabled to judge, whether our trea  
ties hive been regarded by them as filing at all  
the meiiure of their deman Is, or as guarding  
&gt;gainft the ex^rcife of fc ce our vclfcis within  
their pow&#x27;er ; and to confidcr how far it will be  
fafe a: d expedient to leave our affairs with them  
in their prefent pofture.  
1 lay before you the refult of the cenfus late  
ly irtken of our inhabitants, to a conformity  
with which ws are to reduce the enfuing rates  
of icprefentation and taxation. You will per  
ceive that the eocreafe of numbets, during the  
lafi ten years, proceeding in geometrical ratio,  
promifes a duplication in little more than twen­  
ty two year-. We contemplate this rapid  
growth, and the profpeft it holds up to us, not  
with a view to the injuries it may enable us to  
do to otheVs in fome future day, but to the fet­  
tUmcQt of the cxrcafif c country ftill roaming  
  
vacant within cur to the multiplication  
of men. fufceptib&#x27;c ot happireis, educated in the  
love of order, habituated to felf-g.ouernment,  
aad valuing its blefliogs above all price*  
Other cimun fiances combined with  
the increafe of numbers, have produced  
an augments&#x27;k n rf revenue arifing timr con  
fumption, in a ratio far beyond that of p»pu­  
lotion alone ; and though the charges in for­  
eign relations, now taking place fo delirabl&gt;  
hr the whole world, may for a feafi n affeft  
this branch of revenue, yet we;ghing all pre h j  
abilities of expenfe. as well as ot income, there  
fs jeafor able yn ord of confidence that we;  
mav now fafely difpenfe wth atl the internal  
taxes comprehending excifes, ft-mps, auctions,  
licenfes, carriages and refined fugars ; to which  
the pottage on newfpapers may be added to fa  
cilttare the progref* ot information ; and that  
the rerrain ng fources of revenue will be fuffi  
cient to piovide for the fupport of government,  
to pay the interefi ot the puMic debts, and to  
d fcharge the prinvpds in fhorter periods than  
the laws, or the general expectation had con  
temphteJ* War, indeed, and untoward events,  
may change hk ptofpe‘1 of things, and call for

late Crcafute for w’ars to happen we knew not  
when, and which might not p„*h «ps happen,  
but from the temptations offere dby that tieaf­  
ure.  
  
Thefe views, however, of reducing our bur  
then-, are formed on the ex Deflation, that a An  
Able, and at the fame time, falutary reduction  
may take place in our habitual expenditures.

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and  
of the Houf? of Representatives,  
IT is a circumstance of sincere  
gratification to me, that on meeting  
the good council of the nation, I am  
able to announce to them on&#x27; grounds  
‘of reasonable certainty, that the wars  
and troubles, which have for {o many  
years affli¢ted our sister nations, have  
at length come to an end ; and that  
the communication of peace and.com­  
merce are once more opening among  
.them: . Whillt we devoutly return  
thanks to the beneficent being, who  
has been pleased to breathe into them  
the spirit of conciliation and forgive­  
.nefs, we are bound with peculiar gra­  
titude, to be thankful to him that our  
own peace has been preserved through  
- {o perilous a season, and ourselves per­  
-mitted quietly to cultivate the earth,  
-and to prattife and improve those arts  
which tend to increase our comforts.  
The aflurances indeed of friendly dis­  
position received from all the powers  
“with whom we ‘have priacipal rela­  
“tions, had inspired a confidence that  
our peace with them would not have  
“been disturbed. But a ceflation of  
the irregularities whi%.haa  
~the commerce of meutral aations, and  
of the irritations and injuries produced  
by them, cannot but add to this con­  
~fidence ; and firengthens, at the fame  
time the hope, that wrongs committed  
~ on unoffending friends, under a pres­  
sure of circumstances, will now be re­  
- wiewed with candor, and will be con­  
sidered as founding jult claims of re­  
tribution for the pait, and new aflu­  
&#x27; rance for the future. X  
- Among our Indian neighbours also,  
_ afpirit&#x27;of peace and frieadihip gene­  
‘ar% i prevails, and I am happy to  
~ inform you, that the continued efforts  
_to introduce among them the imple­  
_ ments and the pradtice of husbandry,  
* and of the household arts, have not  
been without success : That they are  
&quot; become more and more sensible of  
-the superiority of this dependence for  
g B o  
R el  
  
To this state of general pesce with  
which we have been blefled, one only  
exception exists. Tripoli, the least  
conﬁdca?ablc of the Barbary ftates,had  
come forward with demands unfound­  
ed either in right or in compaét, and  
bad permitted itfelf to denotince war­  
on our failure to comply before a givg  
en day. The style of the demand ad -  
mitted but one an{wer.. Ifenta fmglla  
squadron of frigates into the Mediter­  
ranean, with a[?urances to that power  
of our sincere desire to remain in  
peace ; but with orders to proteét our  
commerce against the threatened at­  
tack. ‘The measure was seasonable  
and salutary. The Bey had already  
declared war in form. His cruisers  
were out. T&#x27;wo had arrived at Gib­  
raltar. Our commerce in the Medi­  
terranean was *blockaded ; and that  
of the Atlantic in peril. The arrival  
of our squadron dispelled the danger.  
One of the Tripolitan cruisers having  
fallen in with and engaged the small  
fch’r Enterprize, commanded by Lt.  
STERRET, which had gone out as a  
tender to our larger veflels, was cap­  
tured, after a heavy slaughter of her  
men, without the loss of a single one  
‘on our part. - The bravery exhibited  
by our citizens on that element, will,  
I trust, be a teffimony to the world,  
that it is not a want of that virtue  
which makes us feck their peace ; but  
a conscientious desire to dire&amp; the  
energies of our nation to the mulu­  
plication of the human race ; and not  
to its deftru&amp;ion. Unauthorized by  
the constitution, without the fan&amp;ion  
of Congress, to go beyond the line of  
defence, the veilel being disabled from  
committing further hostilities, was lib­  
erated, with its crew.  
  
‘The legislature will doubtless con­  
fider, whether,by authorifing measures  
of offence also, they will place our  
force on an equal footing with that  
of its adversaries. I communicate all  
material information on this fubje&amp;,  
that in the exercise of the important  
fun&amp;ion, confided by the Constitution  
to the legislature exclusively; their  
judgment may form itfelf on a know­  
ledge and consideration of every cir­  
cumstance of weight. |  
I with I-could fay that our situa­  
tion with all the other Barbary States  
was entirely fatisfactory. Discovering  
that some delays had taken place in  
the performance of certain articles  
stipulated by us, I thought it my dury,  
by immediate measures, for fulfilling  
them, to vindicate to ourselves the  
right of considering the effe&amp; of de­  
parture from stipulation on their fide.  
From the papers which will be laid  
before you, you will be enabled to  
judge, whether our treaties are te­  
garded by them as fixing at all the  
measure of their demands,or as gadrd­  
ing against the exercise of force, otir  
veflels .within their power ; and to  
confider how far it will be fafe and  
expedient to leave our affairs with |  
them in their present posture. : j  
Iglay before you the result of the  
census lately taken of our inhabitants,  
to 2 conformity ‘with which we are  
to reduce the ensuing rates of repre­  
{entation and taxation. You will per­  
ceive that the encreafe of numbers,  
during the last ten years, proceeding  
in geometrical ratio, promises a dupli­  
cation in little more than twenty-two  
years. We contemplate this rapid  
growth, and the prospect it holds up  
to us, not with a view to the injuries  
it may enable us to do to others in  
some future day, but to the settle­  
ment of the extensive country fill re­  
maining vacant within our limits, to  
the multiplication of men, susceptible  
of happiness, educated in the love of  
order, habituated to felf-government, j  
and valuing its bleflings above all  
price. i  
s Other circumftances,combined with  
the increase of numbers, have produ­  
ced an augmentation of revenue ari­  
sing from consumption, in a ratio far  
beyond that of population alone ; and  
though the changesin foreign rela­  
tions, now taking place so desirably for  
the whole world, may for a {feafon ef­  
fect this branch of revenue, yet, weigh­  
ing all probabilities of expence, as well  
asof income, there isreafonable ground  
“of confidence that we may now fafely  
dispense with all the internal taxes,  
-comprehending excises, stamps, auc­  
“tions, licences, carriages and refined  
sugars ; to which the p®tage on news­  
papers may be added to facilitate the  
progress of information ; and that the  
lemaining sources of revenue will be  
fufficient to provide for the support  
“of government, to pay the interest of .  
the public debts, and to discharge the |  
‘the principals in thorter periods than  
‘the laws, or the geheral expedtation  
‘had contemplated. War, indeed, and |  
untoward events may = change this  
profpeé of things, and wﬂfwmﬂ :  
«ces which the imposts could mot meet. |

A gR,  
  
pedtation, that a sensible, and at the  
fame..time, salutary redu&amp;ion may  
‘take place in our habitual expendi­  
tures. lor this purpose, those of the  
civil govanment, the army and navy,  
will need revifai- When we confider,  
that Liis government is charged with  
the extérnal and mutual relations only  
“of these slates ; that the states them­  
felyes havs principal care of our per­  
{l’om’,&#x27;our-s roperty, and our reputa­  
tion 3 comg ontituiing the great field of  
human cincems, we may well doubt  
whether jur grganization is not too  
complicaed, too expensive ; whether  
offices ard officers have not been mul­  
tiplied wneceffarily, and sometimes  
injuriouflt te the service they were  
meant topromote. I will caufetobe  
lafdg:fo yow an eflay towards a  
ftatemeny of those who, gnder pub­  
lic emplyment, of various kinds  
draw ‘mmey from the treasury, or  
from ouxitizens. Time has not per­  
mitted perfedt enumeration, the  
ramifacons of office being too mul­  
tiplied 4d remots, to be compleatly  
traced ta firlk trial.—Among those  
who aredependant on executive dif­  
cretion,“ﬁg ve begun the reduiion of  
what wa med unnecessary. The  
expences of diplomatic agency have  
been considerably diminithed. The  
infpeftos of internal revenue, . who  
were foind to abftrué the accounta­  
bility ofthe institution, have been dis­  
continues. Several agencies, created  
by execitive authority, on falari¢s fix­  
ed by that also, have been suppressed,  
and thodld suggest the expedienéy of  
regulatijg that power by law, {o as to  
fubjeét fi« exercises to legislative in­  
{pection and fanétion. Other refor­  
mationsof the fame kind will be pur­  
sued with that caution which is requi­  
site, in removing useless things, not to  
injure what is retained. - But the great  
malfs of public offices is eßablithed by  
law, and therefore by law alone can be  
abolished. Should the legislature think  
it expedient to pass this roll in review,  
and to try all its parts by the test of  
&quot; public utility, they may be assured of  
every aid and light which executive  
inférmation can yield. Considering  
the general tendency to multiply ofh­  
ces aand dependencies, and to increase  
expence to the ultimate term of bur­  
thea which the citizen can bear, it be­  
boves us to avail ourielves of every oc­  
casion which presents itfelf for taking  
off the surcharge, that it never may be  
seen here, that, after leaving to labor  
the {fmalleft portion of its earnings on  
which it ean subsist, government shall  
itfelf consume the residue of what it  
was instituted to.guard.  
In our care too of the public contri­  
“butions entrusted to our direion, it  
would be prudent to multiply barriers  
againll their diflipation, by appropria­  
ting {pecific sums to every fpecific pur­  
pose glfcgptible of definition ; by disal­  
lowing allapplications of money vary­  
ing fromthe appropriation in obje&amp;  
or tranfcinding it in amount ; by re­  
ducing tke undefined field of contin­  
gencies, ind thereby circumscribing  
difcretioniry powers over money ; and  
by bringitg back to a single depart­  
ment all/accountabilities for money,  
where the examination maybe prompt,  
efficaciout and uniform.  
  
An account of the receipts and ex­  
penditures of the last year, as prepar­  
ed by the secretary of the Treasury,  
will, as ujual, be laid before you.—  
The fuccds which has attended the  
late sales of the publiclands shews that,  
with attention, they may be made an  
important source of receipt. Among  
the payments those made in difchargé  
of the principal and interest of the na­  
tional debt, will shew that the public  
faith has been exaétly:maintained.—  
To these will be added an estimate of  
appropriations necessary for the ensu­  
ing year. This last will of course be  
affe@ted by such madifications of the  
system of expence as you shall think  
proper to adopt. - o  
- A fatement has been formed by  
the secretary at war, on mature con­  
sideration of all the posts and stations  
where garrisons will be expedient, and  
of the number of men requisite for  
each garrison.. The whole amount  
is. considerably short of the ,present  
military eftablithment. For the sur­  
plus no particdlar use can be pointed  
out. For defence against invasion,  
their number ‘is as nothing ; nor isit.  
considered needful or fafe that a stand­  
ing army should be kept up, in time of  
peace, for that purpose. Uncertain  
as we must ever be of the particalar  
point in our circumference where an  
‘enemy my chufe to invade us, the on­  
ly. force which can be ready at every  
point, and competent to oppose them,  
is the body of neighb@yring citizens, as  
formed into a militia. On these, col­  
le@ed from the parts most convenient,  
in number proportioned to the invad­  
ing force, it is best to rely not only to  
meet the firtattack, but if it threat­  
ens to be permanent, to maintain the  
defence until regulars may be engag­  
fhould, at every feflion, continue to  
RPN W%@  
  
fufficiently perfed ; nor should we  
nOow or at any time, {eparate, until we  
can fay we havedone every thing for  
the militia, which we could do, were  
an enemy at our door. :  
  
- The provision of military stores on­  
hand will be laid before you,- that  
you may judge of the additions fill  
reqtiifite. : &#x27;  
With refpe&amp; to the extent to which  
our naval preparations should be car­  
ried, some difference of opinion may  
be expedted to appear : But just at­  
tention to the circumstances of every  
part of the union will doubtless recon- -  
cile all. A small force will probably  
continue to be wanted, for actual ser­  
vice in the Mediterranean. What­  
ever annual sum beyond that you may  
think proper to appropriate to naval  
preparations, would, perhaps, be bet­  
ter employed in providing those arti­  
cles which may be kept without waste  
or comfu?nption, and be in readiness  
when anjy exigence calls them into use.  
Progress has been made, as will ap­  
pear by papers now communieated,  
in providing materials for seventy-.  
four-gun ships asdirected by law. -  
Fow far the avthority given by  
the legiffature for procuring and ef­  
tainf;lng sites for naval purposes, has  
been perfectly understood and pursued  
in the execation, admits of some  
doubt. A Ratement of the expences  
already incurred on that fubje&amp; shall  
be laid before you. I have in certain  
cases, fulpended or slackened these ex­  
penditures that the legislature might  
determine whether {o many yards are  
necessary as have been contemplated.  
The works at this place are among  
those pernitted to goon : And five  
of the seven frigates dire@ed to be  
laid up, have been brought and laid  
-up here, where, besides the fafety of  
their position, they are under the eye  
of the executive administration, as  
well as of its agents, and where your­  
selves also will be guided by your own  
- view, in the legislative provisions res­  
pecting them, which may from time  
to time be necessary. They are pre­  
served inf{uch condition, as well the  
- veflels as whatever belongs to them,  
- as to be at all times ready forfea on a  
short warning. Two others are yer

Fellow Citizens of the Senate,  
  
and of the House of Representatives.  
IT is a circumftance of fincere grati-  
fication to me, that on meeting the great  
council of the nation, I am able to an-  
nounce to them on grounds of reaSona-  
ble certainty, that the wars and trou-  
bles, which have for fo many years af-  
flicted our lifter nations, have at length  
come to an end ; and that the communi-  
cations of peace and commerce are once  
more opening among them. Whilft we  
devoutly return thanks to the benificent  
being who has been pleafedto breathe in-  
to them the fpirit of conciliation and for-  
givenefs, we are bound, with peculiar  
gratitude, to be thankful to him that  
our own peace has been preferved  
througli lb perilous a feafon, and our-  
felves permitted quietly to cultivate the  
earth, and to practife and improve thofe  
arts which tend to encreafe our comforts.  
The affurances indeed of friendly difpo-  
fition received from all the powers with  
whom we have principle relations, had  
infpired a confidence that our peace with  
them would not have been difturbed.  
But a ceffation of the irregularies which  
had afflicted the commerce of neutral na-  
tions, and of the irritations and injuries  
produced by them, cannot but add to this  
confidence ; and ftrengthens at the fame  
time, the hope that wrongs committed on  
unoffending friends, under a preflure of  
circumftances, will now be reviewed with  
candour, and will be conlideredas found-  
ing juft claims of retribution for the part,  
and new aflurance for the future.  
  
Among our Indian neighbors alfo a  
fpirit of peace and friendship generally  
prevails ; and I am happy to inform you  
that the continued efforts to introduce  
among them the implements and the prac-  
tife of hufbandry, and of the houfehold  
arts, have not been without fuccefs : that  
they are become more and more fenfible  
of the Superiority of this dependance for  
clothing and fubfiftence, over the preca-  
rious relburces of hunting and fifhing :  
And already we are able ta announce  
that, inftead of that conftant diminution  
of numbers produced by their wars and  
their wants, fome of them begin to ex-  
perience an increafe of population.  
  
To this ftate of general peace with  
which we have been bleffed, one onjy  
exception exifts. Tripoli, the leaft con-  
fiderableof the Bai bary ftates, had come  
forward with demands unfounded either  
in right or incompact, and had permitted  
  
itfelf to denounce war, on our failure  
to comply before a given day. The ftyle.  
of the demand admitted but one anfwer.  
I fent a fmall fquadron of frigates into  
the Mediterranean, with affurances V*  
that power of our fincere delire to re-  
main in peace ; but with orders to pro-  
tect our commerce againft the threatened  
attack. Themeafure was feafonable and  
falutary. The Bey had already declared  
war in form. His cruifers were out.  
Two had arrived at Gibraltar. Our  
commerce in the Mediterranean was  
blockaded ; and that of the Atlantic &#x27;in  
peril. The arrival of our fquadron dis-  
pelled the danger. One of the Tripoli-  
tan cruifers having fallen in with and  
enaged the fmall Schooner Enterprize,  
commanded by Lieut. Sterret, which  
had gone out as a tender to our larger vef-  
fels, was captured, after a heavy {laugh-  
ter of her men, without the lofs of a Sin-  
gle one on our part. The bravery exhi-  
bited by our citizens on that element  
will, I truft, be a teftimony to the world,  
that it is not a want of that virtue which  
makes us Seek their peace ; but a con-  
scientious defire to direct the energies oS  
our nation to the multiplication of the  
human race : and not to its deftruction  
Unauthorized by the conftitution, with-,  
out the Sanction of Congrefs, to go be-  
yond the line of defence, the veffel be-  
ing difabled Srom committing further  
hostilities, was liberated, with its crew.  
The Legiflature will doubtleSs conSider  
whether, by authorizing meaSures of  
offence alfo, they will place our force on  
an equal footing with that of its adver-  
saries. I communicate all material infor-  
mation onthis Subject, that in the exercife  
of the important function, confided by  
the constitution to the Legiflature exclu-  
sively, their judgment may form itfelf on  
a knowdedge and confideration of every  
circumftance of weight.  
  
I wifh I could fay that our Situation  
with all the other Barbary ftates was en-  
tirely SatisSactory. Discovering that  
fome delays had taken place in the per-  
Sormance of certain articles ftipulated by  
us, I thought it my duty, by immediate  
meafures for fulfilling them, to vindicate  
to ourSelves the right of confidering the  
effect of departure from ftipulation on  
their fide. From the papers which will  
be laid before you, you will be enabled to  
judge whether our treaties are regarded  
by them as fixing at all the meafure of  
their demands, or as guarding againft the  
exercife oS Sorce our veffels within their  
power: and to conSider how far it will  
be Safe and expedient to leave our affairs  
with them in their prefent pofture.  
  
I lay beSore you the reSult of the cen-  
Sus lately taken of our inhabitants, to a  
conformity with which we are to reduce  
the enfuing rates of reprefentation and  
taxation. You will perceive that the  
encreaSe oS numbers, during the laft ten  
years, proceeding in geometrical ratio,  
promiSes a duplication in little more than  
twenty-two years. We contemplate  
this rapid growth, and the proSpect it  
holds up to us, not with a view to the  
injuries it may enable us to do to others  
in Some Suture day, but to the Settlement  
of the extenSive country Still remaining  
vacant within our limits, to the multipli-  
cation of men, SuSceptible of happinefs,  
educated in the love of order, habituated  
to Self-government, and valuing its blelf-  
ings above all price.  
  
Other circumftances, combined with  
the increaSe of numbers, have produced  
an augmentation of revenue arifing from  
confumption, in a ratio far beyond that  
of population alone ; and though the  
changes in foreign relations, now taking  
place fo deSirably Sor the whole world,  
may for a feafon affect this branch of re-  
venue, yet, weighing all probabilities of  
expence, as well as of income, there is  
reaSonable ground of confidence that we  
may now fafely difpenSe with all the in-  
ternal taxes, comprehending exciSes,  
Stamps, auctions, licences, carriages and  
refined Sugars ; to which the portage on  
news-papers may be added, to facilitate  
the progrefs of information : and that  
the remaining Sources of revenue will  
be Sufficient to provide for the fupport  
of government, to pay the intereft of the  
public debts, and to dil&#x27;charge the princi-  
pals in Shorter periods than the laws, or  
the general expectation had contempla-  
ted. War, indeed, and untoward events  
may change this profpect of things, and  
call Sor expences which the impofts could  
not meet. But found principles will not  
  
jurti fy our taxing the induftry of our fel-  
low citizens to accumulate treafure for  
wars to happen we know not when, and  
which might not, perhaps, happen, but  
from the temptations offered by that  
treafure.  
  
TheSe views, however, of reducing  
our burthens, are formed on the expect*  
ation, that a fenfible, and at the fame  
time, a Salutary reduction may take place  
in our habitual expenditures. For this  
purpoSe, thoSe of the civil government,  
the army and navy, will need revifal.  
When we conSider that this government  
is charged with the external and mutual  
relations only of thefe ftates; that the  
ftates themfelves have principal care of  
our perfons, our property, and our repu-  
tation ; constituting the great field of hu-  
man concerns, we may well doubt whe-  
ther our organization is not too compli-  
cated, too expenfive ; whether offices and  
officers have not been multiplied unnecef-  
Sarily, and Sometimes injurioufly to the  
Service they were meant to promote. I  
will cauSe to be laid before you an effay  
towards a ftatement, of thole who, under  
public employment of various kinds,  
draw money from the treafury, or from  
our citizens. Time has not permitted a  
perfect enumeration, the ramifications of  
office being too multiplied and remote to  
be compleatly traced in a firft trial — A-  
mong thofe who are dependant on execu-  
tive discretion, I have begun the reduc-  
tion of what was deemed unneceffary.  
The expences of diplomatic agency have  
been considerably diminiftied. The in-  
spectors of internal revenue, who were  
found to obftruct the accountability of  
the inftitution, have been difcontinued.  
— Several agencies, created by executive  
authority, on Salaries fixed by that alSo,  
have been Suppreffed, and Should Suggeft  
the expediency of regulating that power  
by law, fo as to Subject its exerciSes to  
legillative inSpecfion and Sanction. Other  
reSormations of the fame kind will be pur-  
Sued with that caution which is requilite,in  
removinguSclefs things, not to injure what  
retained. But the great mafs of public  
offices is eftabliflied by law, and therefore  
by law alone can be abolifhed. Should  
the legiflature think it expedient to paSs  
this roll in review, and to try all its parts  
by the teft of public utility, they may be  
affured of every aid and light which exe-  
cutive information can yield. Confider-  
ing the general tendency to multiply of-  
fices and dependencies, and to encreafe  
expence to the ultimate term of burthen  
which the citizen can bear, it behoyes us  
to avail ourfelves of every occafion,  
which preSents itSelS Sor taking off the  
Surcharge ; that it never may be Seen  
here, that, aSter leaving to labour the Small-  
eft portion oS its earnings on which it can  
Subfift, government Shall itSelf confume  
the refidue of what it was inftituted to  
guard.  
  
In our care too of the public contri-  
butions cntruftcd to our direction, it  
would be prudent to multiply barriers  
againft their difiipaiion, by appropriating  
Specific Sums to every Specific purpoSe SuS-  
ceptible of definition : by difallowing all  
application of money varying from the  
appropriation in object or tranfeending  
it in amount ; by reducing the unde-  
fined field of contingences, and thereby  
circumfcribing difcretionary powers over  
money ; and by bringing back to a Single  
department all accountabilities Sor mo-  
ney, where the examination may be  
prompt, efficacious and uniform.  
  
An account of the receipts andexpen-  
ditures of the laft year, as prepared by  
the Secretary of the Treafury, will, as  
ufual, be laid before you. The SucceSs  
which has attended the late Sales oS the  
public lands (hews that, with attention,  
that may be made an important Source oS  
receipt. Among the payments, thoSe  
made in discharge of the principal and in-  
tereft of the national debt, will Shew that  
the public faith has been exactly maintain-  
ed. To thefe will be added an eftirnate  
of appropriations neceffary for the enfu-  
ing ear. This laft will of courfe be af-  
fected by fuch modifications of the fyftem  
of expence as you ftiall think proper to  
adopt.  
  
A ftatement has been formed by the  
fecretary at war, on mature confideration  
of all the pofts and ftations where garri-  
Sons will be expedient, and of the number  
of men requfite Sor each garriSon. The  
whole amount is considerably fliort oS the  
preSent military eftablifliment. For the  
Surplus no particular uSe can be pointed  
  
out. For defence againft invafion, their  
number is as nothing : nor is it consider-  
ed needful or fafc that a ftanding army  
Should be kept up, in time oS peace, Sor  
that purpoSe. Uncertain as we muft ever  
be of the particular point in our circum-  
ference where an enemy may chufe to in-  
vade us, the only force which can be rea-  
dy at every point, and competent to op-  
pofe them, is the body of neighboring ci-  
tizens, as formed into a militia. On thefe  
collected from the parts moft convenient,  
in numbers proportioned to the invading  
force, it is beft to rely not only to meet  
the firft attack, but if it threatens to be  
permanent, to maintain the defence un-  
til regulars may be engaged to relieve  
them* Thefe considerations render it  
important that we ftiould, at every Seffion,  
continue to amend the defects, which  
from time to time ftiew themfelves, in the  
laws for regulating the militia, until they  
are fufficiently perfect : nor Should we  
now, or at any time, Separate, until we can  
Say we have done every thing Sor the mi-  
litia, which wc could do, were any at our  
door.  
  
The provifion of military ftores on  
hand will be laid before you, that you  
may judge of the additions ftill requiiite.  
  
With refpect to the extent to which  
our naval preparations Should be carried,  
Some difference of opinion may be ex-  
pected to appear; but juft attention to  
the circumftances of every part of the  
union will doubtlefs reconcile all* A  
fmall force will probably continue to be  
wanted, for actual Service in the Medi-  
terranean. Whatever annual fum be-  
yond that you may think proper to appro-  
priate to naval preparations, would per-  
haps be better employed in providing  
thoSe articles which may be kept without  
wafte or consumption, and be in readineSs  
when ony exigence calls them into uSc.  
Progrefs has been made, as will appear  
by papers now communicated, in provi-  
ding materials Sor Seventy-four-gun fliips  
as directed by law.  
  
How Sar the authority given by the le-  
giflature Sor procuring and eftablifliing  
Sites for naval purpofes has been perfect-  
ly underftood and purfued in the execu-  
tion, admits of Some doubt. A ftate-  
ment of the expences already incurred  
on that Subject ftiall be laid beSore you.  
I have in certain caSes, SuSpended or  
flackened theSe expenditures, that the le-  
giflature might determine whether So ma-  
ny yards are neceffary as have been con-  
templated. The works at this place are  
among thoSe permitted to go oh : and five  
of the Seven frigates directed to be laid  
up, have been brought and laid up here ;  
where, befides the SaSety of their  
pofition, they are under the eye of the  
executive adminiftration, as well as of its  
agents, and where yourfelves alfo will be  
guided by your own view, in the legifla-  
tive provisions reSpecting them, which  
may Srom time to time be neceffary.  
They are preferved in Such condition, as  
well the veffels as whatever belongs to  
them, as to beat all times ready for Sea on  
a fliort warning. Two others are yet to  
be laid up, fo Soon as they ftiall have re-  
ceived the repairs requiiite to put them al-  
fo into found condition. As a Superin-  
tending officer will be neceffary at each  
yard, his duties and emoluments, hitherto  
fixed by the executive, will be a more  
proper Subject for legiflation. A commu-  
nication will alfo be made of our pro-  
grefs in the execution of the law reSpect-  
ing the veffels directed to be Sold.  
  
The Sortifications oS our harbours,  
more or leSs advanced, preSent consider-  
ations of great difficulty. While fome  
of them are on a Scale Sufficiently propor-  
tioned to the advantages oS their pofition  
to the efficacy of their protection and the  
importance of the points within it, others  
are fo extenSive, will coft So much in their  
firft erection, So much in their mainte-  
nance, and require Such a Sorce to garri-  
Son them, as to make it queftionable what  
is beft now to be done. A ftatement of  
thoSe commenced or projected, of the ex-  
pences already incurred, and eftimates  
of their future coft, as far as can be fore-  
Seen, fliall be laid beSore you, that you  
may be enabled to judge whether any al-  
teration is neceffary in the laws respect-  
ing this Subject.  
  
Agriculture, manufactures, commerce  
and navigation, the four pillars of our  
profperity, are then moft thriving when  
left moft free to individual enterprize.  
Protection from cafual embarraffments,  
however, may fomctimes be SeaSonably  
  
interpoSed. If in the courSeof your ob-  
servations or enquiries, theV fliould ap-  
pear to need any aid, within the limits of  
our conftitutional powers,* your SenSe of  
their importance is a Sufficient aflurance  
they will occupy your attention. We  
cannot, indeed, but all Seel an anxious So-  
licitude for the difficulties under which  
our carrying trade will foon be placed.  
How far it can be relieved otherwife than  
by time, is a Subject oS important confi-  
deration.  
  
The judiciary Syftem of the United.  
States and especially that portion oS it re-  
cently erected, will oS courSe preSent it-  
Self to the contemplation of Congrefs ;  
and that they may be able to judge oS the  
proportion which the inftitution bears to  
the buSineSs it has to perform, I have  
caufed to be procured from the feveral  
ftates, and now lay before Congrefs, an  
exact ftatement of all the caufes decided  
Since the firft eftablifliment of the courts,  
and of thofe which were depending when  
additional courts and judges were brought  
in to their aid.  
  
And while on the judiciary organiza-  
tion, it will be worthy your confideration  
whether the proteaion of the ineftima-  
ble inftitution of juries has been extend-  
ed to all the cafes involving the fecurity  
of our perfons and property. Their im-  
partial Selection alfo being eflential to  
their value, we ought further to conlider  
whether that is fufficiently fecured in  
thofe ftates, where they are named by a  
marflial depending on executive will, or  
defignated by the court, or by officers de-  
pendant on them.  
  
I cannot omit recommending a revifal  
of the laws on the fubject of naturaliza-  
tion. Confidering the ordinary chances  
of human life, a denial of citizenfliip un-  
der a refidence of fourteen years, is a de-  
nial to a great proportion of thofe who a(k  
it ; and controuls a policy purfued, from  
their firft fettlement, by many of thefe  
ftates, and ftill believed of confequence to  
their profperity; And Shall we refufe to  
the unhappy fugitives from diftrefs, that  
hofpitallty which the Savages of the wil-  
dernefs extended to our fathers arriving  
in this land? Shall opprefled humanity  
find no af&gt;lum on this globe? The con-  
ftitution, indeed, has wilely provided  
that, Sor admiflion to certain offices of  
important truft, a refidence fliall be re-  
quired, Sufficient to develope character  
and defign. But might not the general  
character and capabilities oS a citizen be  
SaSely communicated to every one mani-  
festing a bona fide purpoSe of embarking  
his life and fortunes permanently with  
us ? with reftrictioas, perhaps, to guard  
againft the fraudulent ufurpation of our  
flag; an abufe, which brings fo much em-  
barraffment and lofs on the genuine citi-  
zen, and fo much danger to the nation of  
being involved in war, that no endeavor  
fliould be Spared to detect and SuppreSs it.  
  
Thefe fellow citizens, are the matters  
refpecting the ftate of the nation, which I  
have thought of importance to be fubmit-  
ted to your confideration at this time. —  
Some others of lefs moment, or not yet  
ready for communication, will be the fub-  
ject of feparate meffages. I am happy in  
this opportunity of committing the ar-  
duous affairs of our government to the  
collected wifdom of the union. Nothing  
fliall be wanting on my part to inform,  
as far as in my power, the legiflative  
judgment ; nor to carry that judgment  
into faithful execution. The prudence  
and temperance of your difcullions will  
promote, within your own walls, that  
conciliation which fo much befriends rati-  
onal conclufion ; and by its example, will-  
encourage among our conftituents that  
progrefs of opinion which is tending to  
unite them in &lt; bject and in will. That  
all ftiould be Satisfied with any one order  
of things is not to be expected ; but I in-  
dulge the pleafing perSuafion that the  
great body oS our citizens will cordially  
concur in honeft and difinterefted ef-  
forts, which have for their object to pre-  
ferve the general and ftate governments  
in their conftitutional form and equilibri-  
um ; to maintain peace abroad, and order  
and obedience to the laws at home ; to ef-  
tablifh principles and practices oS admi-  
niftration Savourable to the Security of  
liberty and property, and to reduce ex-  
pences to what is neceffary for the udeful  
purpofes of government.

form itfeli on a knowledge and  
conlideration of every circumftance  
of weight.  
  
l with I could fay that our fit-  
gation with all the other Barbary  
tates was entirely fatisfactory.  
Difcovering that fome delays had  
taken place in the performance of  
certain articles ftipulated by us,  
I thought it my duty, by imme-  
diate meatures for fultilling them,  
to vindicate to owfelves the right  
of cenfideripg the effect of de-  
parture from ftipu&#x27;ation on their

be laid before you, you will be en-  
abled to ju idge whikier our trea—  
ties are regarded by them as fix

mands, or as guarding egain{t the  
exercife of force our veflels within  
their power ; and ro confider how  
far it will be fafe and expedient to  
feave our affairs with thems in their  
prefent pofture,  
  
f Jay before you the refvlt of the  
ceéenfus lately taken of our inhab-  
itants, tea conformity with which  
we are to reduce the enfuing rates  
of reprefentation and taxation.  
You will perceive that the encreafe  
of numbers, during the laft ten  
years, proceeding in geometrical  
ratio promifes a duplication in lit-  
tle more than twenty Ewo years,  
We contemplate this rapid growth,  
and the profpect it holds up tO us,

Other circumitances, combined  
with the encreafe of numbers,

wheighing all probebiliries of ex.

is resfonable greund of confidence  
that wemay. now fafely difpenfe  
with all the internal taxes, com-  
prehending excifes, {tamps, auct-

facilitate the progrefs of infor-

to provide for the fupport of gov-

public debts, and to difcharge the  
principals in fhorter periods than  
the laws, or the general expecta-  
tion had contemplated. War, in-  
deed, and yntoward events mav  
change this profpect of things, and  
call far expences which the im-

thofe of the civil government, the

When we eonfider that this gov-  
ernment is charged with the ex-  
rernal and mutual relation only of  
thele fates ; that the flates them—  
feives have principal care of our  
perfons, our properry, and our  
reputation ; conilituting the great  
field of human concerns, we may  
well doubt whether our organi-  
zation 1s not tog complicated, too  
expenfive ; whether offices and  
ellicers have act been multiplied  
unneceflarily, and femetimes inju-  
rioufly to the fervice they were  
meant to promete. I wiil caufe  
to be laid before you an effay to-  
wards a ftatement, of thofe who,  
under public empioyment of vari-  
ous kinds, draw money from the  
treafury, or from our citizens.  
Time has not permitted a perfect  
enumeration, the ramifactions of  
office being too multiplied and re-  
mote to be compleatly traeed in a  
firft trial—-Among thofe who are  
dependant on executive difcretion,  
J have begun the reduction of what  
was deemed unseceflary, The ex-  
pences of diplomatic agency have  
been confiderably diminifhed. The  
infpetors of internal revenue,who  
were found to obftruct the accoun—  
tability of the inftitution, have  
been difcontinued.—Several agen-  
me created by Executive authori-  
, onfalaries fixed by that alfo,  
hi avd Nei fupprefled, and fhould  
faggelt the expediency of regula-  
ting that power by law, fo as to  
fabject its exercifes to legiflative  
infpeétion and fanétion. Other  
reformations of the fame kind will  
be purfued with that caution  
  
which is requif fite.in remov ing ufe-  
tefs things, not to injure what is  
  
The PATRIOT, Ge.

retained. But the great mafs of  
public offices is eftabiifhed by law,  
and therefore by law alome can be  
abolifhed. Should the legiflature  
think it expedient to pafs this roll  
in review, and to try all its parts  
by the teft of public utility, “they  
may be aflured of every aid aad  
light which executive information  
can yield. Confidering the gen-  
eral tendency to multiply offices  
and dependencies, and to increafe  
expence to the ultimate term of  
burthen which the citizen can bear,  
is behoves us to avail ourfelves of  
every occafion which prefents it-  
felf for taking off the furcherge ;  
that it never may be feen here that,  
after leaving to labour the f{malleft  
portion of its earnings on which  
it can fubfiit,covernment fhall itfelf  
confume the refidue ef what it was  
inftituted to guard.  
  
In ourcare too of the public  
contributions entrufted to our di-  
rection, it would be prudent to  
multiply barriers again{t their dif—  
fipation, by appropriating {pecific  
fums te every {pecific purpofe fuf-  
ceptible of definition : by dilailow-  
ing all applications of money vary-  
ing from the appropriation in ob-  
ject or tranicending itin amount ;  
by reducing the undefined field of  
contingencies, and thereby circam-  
{cribing difcretionary powers over  
money : and by bringing back to  
a fingle department all accounta-  
bilities for money, where the ex-  
amination may be prompt,  
cious and uniform.  
  
efi:ca—  
  
An account of the receipts and  
expenditures of the lait year, as  
prepared by the Secretary ofthe  
Treatury, will as ufual, be laid  
before you. The which  
has attended the late files of the  
public lands fhews that, with at-

tention, they may be made an im-  
portant fource of receipt. Among  
the payments, thole made in di-  
charge of the principal and iotereft  
of the national debt will thew that  
the public faith bas been exaétiy  
miaintained. To thefe wil! be ad-  
ded an eftimate of appropriations  
neceflary for the eniuingy sar. This ;  
loft will ef courfe be affected b  
fach modifications of the fy{tem of  
expence as you fhall think proper  
to adept. A ftatement has been  
formed by the feeretary at war,  
on mature confideration of 2] the.  
pofts and ftatiens where garrifons  
will be ea pecren He of the num-  
ber of men requifite for each gar-  
rifon. The whole amount is con-  
fiderably fhort of the prefent mili-  
tary eftablifhment. For the furplus  
no particularufe can be pointed  
out. For defence againft invafien,  
their number is as nothing ; nor  
is it confidered needful or fafe that  
a ftanding army fheuld be kept up,  
in time of peace, for that purpofe.  
Uncertain as we muft ever be of  
the particular point in our circum-  
ference where an enemy may chufe  
to invade us, the only force which  
can be ready at every poiat, and  
competent to oppofe them, is the  
body of neighboring citizens, as  
formed into a militia. On thefe  
collected from the parts moft con-  
veniert, in numbers proportional  
‘to the invading force, it is beft  
to rely not only to meet the firft  
attack, but iv it threatens to be  
permanent, to maintain the de-  
fence usti! regulars may be enga-  
ged to relieve them. ‘Ihefe con-

fome difference of opinion may  
be expected to appear: but juft  
aitention to the circumflances of  
every part of the union wil! doubi-  
lefs reconcile all. A {mall force  
will probably continue to be  
wanted, for aéival fervice, in the  
Mediterranean. Whaiever annu-  
a! fum beyond thst you may think  
proper to appropriate to naval ae  
parations, would perhaps be bette  
employed in providing ithofe. ar-  
ticles which may be kept without  
wafte or confumption, and be in.

theminto ufe. Progrefs has been.  
made,as will appear by papers now  
communicated, in providing ma-

as directed by law.  
  
How far ihe authority given by  
the legiflature for procuring and  
ellablithing fites for naval purpo-  
fes, has been perteGily underftcod  
and purfued in the execution, ad-  
mits of fome doubt. A flatement  
of the expences already incurred on  
that fubjeQi fhall be laid before you.  
J have in certain cafes,fufpended or

of your obieryations of enquiries,

within the lionits of our conftitu-  
tional powers, your fenfe of their  
importance is a fufhicient affurance  
they will occupy your attention.  
We cannot, indeed, but all feel  
an anxious folicitude for the diffi-

far it ean be relieved, otherwife than  
by time, isa fubject of important  
cenfideration.  
  
The judiciary fyftem of the U-  
nited S:ates and efpecially that por-  
tion of it recently ere&amp;ted, will of  
courfe prefent ifelf to the comtem-

Portion which the inititution bears

have caufed tobe orecured from

And while on the judictaty or-  
gan:zation, it willbe worthy your  
contideration whether the protec-  
tion of the tneltimabdle inftituttion  
of yunes has been extended to alt  
the cafes involving the fecurity of  
our peifoas and: property. Peir  
  
an  
  
  
  
  
184  
impartial felection alfo being effen-  
tial to their value,we ought further  
toconfider whether that is fufficient-  
ly fecured in thofe ftates, where  
they are named by a marfhal de-  
pending on executive will, or de-  
fignated by the court, or by officers  
dependent on them.  
{ cannot omit recommending  
a revilal of the laws on the fubjeét  
of naturalization. Confidering the  
ordinary chances of human life,a  
denial of citizenthip under a refi-  
dence of fourteen years is a deni-  
al to a great proportion of thofe  
who afk it 5 and controls a policy  
purfued, from their firft fettle-  
ment, by many of thefe States,  
and {till believed of confequence to  
their profperity. And thail we re-  
fufe to the unhappy fugitives  
from diftrefs,that hofpitality which  
the favages of the wildernefs ex-  
tended to our fathers artiving in  
this land ? Shall opprefled human-  
ity find noafylum on this globe ?  
The Conftitution,indeed,has wife-  
Jy provided that, for admiffion to  
certain offices of important truft,  
a refidence fhall be required, fufh-  
cient to develope character and  
defign.—But might not the gen=  
eral chara&amp;ter and capabilities of a  
citizen be fately communicated to  
every one manifelting a bona fide  
purpofe of embarking his life and  
jortunes permanently with us ?  
with reitri€tions, perhaps to guard  
againtt the fraudulent ufurpatien of  
our flag ; an abufe which brings  
fo much embarraf{ment and lofs on  
the genuine citizen, and fo much  
danger to the nation of being invol-  
ved in war, that no Sillensicnse  
  
fhould be fpared to dete &amp; fup-

Thefe, fellow-citizens, are the

Nothing fhall be wanting on my  
part to inform, as far as in my  
power, the legiflative judgment in-

Fellow citizens of the fenate,  
and of the houfe of reprefentatives,  
  
It is acircumftance of fincere gratifica-  
tion to me, that on meeting the great  
‘council of the nation, I am able to an-  
nounce to them, on grounds of reafonable  
certainty, that the wars and troubles  
which have for fo many years affli&amp;ed our  
fifter nations, have at length come to an  
end, and that the communications of peace  
aud commerce are once more opening as  
mong them. While we devoutly return  
thanks to the beneficent Being who has  
been pleafed to breathe into them the fpi-  
rit of conciliation and forgivenefs, we are  
bound, with peculiar gratitude, to be  
thankful to him that our own peace has  
been preferved through fo perilous a fea-  
fon, and ourfelves permitted quietly to  
cultivate the earth, and to praétie and  
improve thofe arts which tend to increafe  
our comforts. The affurances, indeed,  
of friendly difpofition received from all the  
powers with whom we have principal re-  
  
lations, had infpired a confidence that our  
peace with them would not have been  
difturbed. Buta ceffation of the; irregu-  
Jarities which has afflicted the commerce  
of neutral nations, and of the irritations  
and injuries produced by them, cannot  
but add to this confidence ; and ftrength-  
ens, at the fame time, the hope that  
wrongs committed on unoffending friends,  
under a preffure of circumftances, will  
now be reviewed with candour, and will  
be confidered as founding juft claims of  
retribution for the paft, and new affurance  
for the future.  
  
Among our Indian neighbours alfo a  
fpirit of peace and friendthip generally  
prevails, and I am happy to inform you  
that the continued efforts to introduce a-  
mong them the implements, and the prac-  
tice of hufbandry, and of the houfehold  
arts, have not been without fuccefs ; that  
they are become more and more fenfible of  
the fuperiority of this dependance, for  
clothing and fubfiftence, over the preca-  
rious refources of hunting and fithing:  
and already we are able to announce that,  
inttead of that conftant diminution of their  
numbers produced by their wars and their  
wants, fome of them begin to experience  
an increafe of population.  
  
To this ftate of general: peace, with  
which we have been bleffed, only one ex-  
ception exifts. Tripoli, the leaft confi-  
derable of the Barbary ftates, had come  
forward with demands unfounded either in  
right or in compact, and had permitted  
itfelf to denounce war, on our failure to  
comply before a given day. The ftyle of  
the demand admitted but one anfwer. I  
fent a {mall fquadron of frigates into the  
Mediterraneon, with affurances to that  
power of our fineere defire to remain in  
peace; but with orders to proteét our  
commerce again&amp; the threatened attack.  
The mealure was feafonable and falutary.  
The bey had already declared war in form.  
His cruifers were out. Two had arrived  
at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the Me-  
diterranean was blockaded ; and that of  
the Atlantic in peril. The arrival of our  
fguadron difpelled the danger. One of  
the Tripolitan cruizers having fallen in  
with and engaged the {mall {chooner En-  
terprize, commanded by lieutenant Ster-  
ret, which had gone out as a tender to our  
larger veffels, was captured, after a heafy  
flaughter of her men, without the lofs of a  
fingie one on our part. The bravery ex-  
  
  
  
FOR JANUARY, 1802.  
  
hibited by our citizens on that element,  
will, I truft, be a teftimony to the world,  
that it is not a want of that virtue which  
makes us feck their peace ; but a confci-  
entious defire to direct the energies of our  
nation to the multiplication of the human  
race, and not to its dettruéction. Unau-  
thorifed by the conftitution, without the  
fan&amp;tion of congrefs, to go beyond the line  
of defence, the veflel being difabled from  
committing further hoftilities, was libera-  
ted with its crew. The legiflature will  
doubtlefs confider whether, by authorifing  
meafures of offence alfo, they will place  
our force on an equal footing with that of  
its adverfaries. I communicate all ma-  
terial information on this fubje&amp;, that in  
the exercife of the important funtion,  
confided by the conftitution to the legifla-  
ture exclutively, their judgment may form  
itfelf on a knowledge and contideration of  
every circumftance of weight.  
  
I with I could fay that our fituation  
with ali the other Barbary (tates was en-  
tirely fatisfactory. Dilcovering that fome  
  
delays had taken place, in the performance  
of certain articles ftipulated by us, I  
thought it my duty, by immediate mea-  
fures for fulfilling them, to vindicate to  
ourfelves the right of confidering the effeét  
of departure from ftipulation on their fide.  
  
From the papers which will be laid before  
you, you will be enabled to judge whether  
our treaties are regarded by them as fixing  
at all the meafure of their demands, or as  
guarding, againft the exercife of force,  
our veflels within their power; and to  
confider how far it will be fafe and expe-  
dient to leave our affairs with them in their  
prefent pofture.  
  
I lay before you the refult of the cenfus  
lately taken of oar inhabitants, to a con-  
formity with which we are to reduce the  
enfuing rates of reprefentation and taxa-  
tion, You will perceive that the increafe  
of numbers, during the laft ten years,  
proceeding in geometrical ratio, promifes  
  
a duplication in little ‘more than twenty-:  
  
two years, We contemplate this rapid  
growth, and the profpeét it holds up to  
us, not with a view to the injuries it may  
enable us to do to others in fome future  
day, but to the fetdement of the extenfive  
country ftill remaining vacant within our  
limits, to the multiplication of men, tuf-  
ceptible of happinefs, educated in the love  
of order, habituated to felf-government,  
and valuing its bicHings above all price.  
Other circumitances combined with the  
increafe of numbers have produced an  
augmentation of revenue arifing from con-  
  
55  
  
famption, in a ratio far beyond that of  
population alone ; and though the changes  
in foreign relations, now taking place fo  
defirably for the whole world, may for a  
feafon affect this branch of revenue, yet,  
weighing all probabilities of expence, as  
well as of income, there is reafonable  
ground of confidence that we may now  
fafely difpenfe with all the internal taxes,  
comprehending excifes, ftamps, auétions,  
licenfes, carriages, and refined fugars: to  
which the poftage on new{papers may be  
added, to facilitate the progrefs of infor-  
mation: and that the remaining fources  
of revenue will be fufficient to provide for  
the fupport of government, to pay the in-  
terelts of public debts, and to difcharge  
the principals in fhorter periods than the  
laws, or the general expectation had con~  
templated. War, indeed, and untoward  
events, may change this profpeét of things,  
and call for the expences which the im-  
pofts could not meet. But found princi-  
ples will not juftify our taxing the induf-  
try of our fellow-citizens to accumulate  
treafure for wars to happen we know not  
when, and which might not, perhaps,  
happen, but from the temptations offered  
by that treafure.  
  
Thefe views, however, of reducing our  
burdens, are formed on the expeétation,  
that a fenfible, and at the fame time a {a-  
lutary, reduétion may take place in our  
habitual expenditures. For this purpole,  
thole of the civil government, the army  
and navy, will need revilal. “When we  
confider that this government is charged  
with the external and mutual relations  
only of thefe ftates ; that the ftates them-  
felves have principal care of our perfons,  
our property, and our reputation ; confti-  
tating the great field of human concerns,  
we may well doubt whether our organiza-  
tion is not too complicated, too expenfive ;  
whether offices and officers have not been  
multiplied unneceffarily, and fometimes  
injurioufly to the fervice they were meant  
to promote. _ I will caufe to be laid before  
you an eflay toward a ftatement of thofe.  
who, under public employment of various  
kinds, draw money from the treafury, or  
from our citizens. Time has not per-  
mitted a perfect enumeration, the ramifi~  
cations ot office being too multiplied and  
remote to be completely traced on a fir  
trial. Among thofe who are dependent  
on executive difcretion, I have begun the  
reduction of what was deemed unneceflary.  
The expences of diplomatic agency have  
been confiderably diminifhed. The in-  
fpefiors of internal sevenue, who were  
  
  
  
56  
  
found to obftru&amp; the accountability of the  
inftitution, have bech difcontinued. Se-  
veral agencies, created by executive autho-  
rity, on falaries fixed by that alfo, have  
been fupprefie:, and fhould fuggelt the  
expediency of regulating that power “4  
law, fo as to fubjet its exercifes to legif-  
lative infpection and fanétion, Qther re-  
formations of the fame kind will be pur-  
fued with that caution which is requifite,  
in removing ufelefs things, not to injure  
what is retained. But the great mafs of  
public officers is eftablifhed by law, and  
therefore by law alone san be abolifhed.  
Should the legiflative think it expedieut to  
pals this roll in review, and to try ali its  
parts by public utility, they may be af-  
tured of every afd and light which execu-  
tive infoemation can yield,  
  
Confidering the general tendency to  
multiply offices and dependencies, and to  
increafe expence to the ultimate term of  
burden which the citizen can bear, it be-  
hoves us to avail ourfelves of every occa-  
fion which prefents itfelf tor taking off the  
furcharge ; that it may never be feen here  
that, atter leaving to labour the fmallett  
portion of its earnings on which it can  
fubfift, government fhall itfelf confume  
the refidue of what it was infiituted to  
guard.  
  
In our care too of the public contribu-  
tions entrufted to our direstion, it would  
be prudent to multiply barriers againit  
their diffipation, by appropriating {pecific  
fums to every {pecific purpofe fufceprible  
of definition 3 by difallowing all applica-  
tions of money varying from the appro-  
priation in objeét or tranfcending it in a-  
mount ; by reducing the undefined fieid  
of contingencies, and thereby circum{crib-  
ing difcretionaiy powers cver money; and  
by bringing back to a fingle department  
all accountabilities for money, where the  
examination may be prompt, efficacious,  
and uniform.  
  
An account of the receipts and expendi-  
tures of the lait year, as prepared by the  
fecretary of the treafury, will, as ufual,  
be laid before you. The fuccels which  
has attended the late fales of the public  
lands fhews that, with attention, they may  
be made an important fource of receipt.  
Among the payments, thofe made in dif-  
charge of the principal and intereit of the  
  
national debt, will fhow that the public-  
  
faith has been exactly maintained. To  
thefe will be added an eftimate of appro-  
priations neceflary for the enfuing year.  
This lait will of courfe be affe&amp;ted by fuch  
modifications of the fyftem of expence as  
you fhall think proper to adopt.

THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
A ftatement has been formed by the  
fecretary at war, on mature confideration  
of all the pofts and ftations where garrifons  
will be expedient, and of the number of  
men requifite for each garrifon. The  
whole amount is confiderably fhort of the  
prefent military eftablifhment. For the  
furplus no particular ufe can be pointed  
aut. For defence againft invafion, their  
number is as nothing ; nor is it confider-  
ed needful or fafe that a ftanding army  
fhould be kept up, in time of peaco. Un-  
certain as we muft ever be of the particu-  
lar point in our circumference where an  
enemy may choofe to invade us, the only  
force which can be ready at every point,  
and competent to oppofe them, is the body  
of neighbouring citizens, as fornred into  
a militia. On thefe colle€ted from the  
parts moft convenient, in numbers pro-  
portioned to the invading force, it is beft  
to rely, not only to, meet the firft attack,  
but if it threatens to be permanent, to  
maintain the defence until the regulars  
may be engaged to relieve them. ‘Thofe  
confiderations render it important that we  
fhouid, at every feffion, continue to amend  
the defeéts, which from time to time fhow  
themielves, -in the laws for regulating the  
militia, until they are fufficiently peffeét :  
nor fhould we now, or at any time, fepa-  
rate, until we can fay we have done every  
thing for the militia, which we could do,  
were an enemy at our door.  
  
The provifion of military ftores on hand  
will be laid before you, that you may  
judge of the additions {till requifite.  
  
With refpeét to the extent to which our  
preparations fhould be carried, fome dif-  
ference of opinion may be expegted to ap-  
pear; but juit attention to the circum-,  
ftances of every part of the union will  
doubtlefs reconcile all. A fimall force  
will._probably continue to be wanted for  
a€iuaifervice in the Mediterranean. What-  
ever annual fum beyond that you may  
think proper to appropriate to naval pre-  
parations, would perhaps be bettcr em-  
ployed in providing thofe articles which  
may be kept without wafte or confump-  
tion, and be in readinefs when any exi-  
gence calls them into ufe. Progrefs has  
been made, as will appear by papers now  
communicated, in providing materials for  
feventy-four gun thips as directed by law.  
  
How far the authority given by the le-  
giflature for procuring and eftablithing  
lites for naval pu pofes, has been perfectly  
underftood and purfued in the execution,  
admits of fome doubt. A ftatement of  
the expences already incurred on that fub-  
je&amp;t thall be laid before you. Ihave, in

FOR JANUARY, 1802. 57  
  
certain cafes, fufpended or flackened thefe  
expenditures, that the legiflature might  
determine whether fo many yards are ne-  
ceffary as have been contemplated. The  
works at this place are among thofe per-  
mitted to go on ;-and five of the feven  
frigates dire€ted to be laid up, have been  
brought and laid up here, where, befide  
the fafetv of their pofition, they are under  
the eye of the executive adminiftration, as  
well as its agents, and where yourfelves  
alfo will be guided by your own view, in  
the legiflative provifions refpe&amp;ting them,  
which may from time to time be neceflary.  
They are preferved in fuch condition, as  
well as the veflels, as whatever belongs to  
them, as to be at all times ready for fea  
on a fhort warning. ‘Two others are yet  
to be laid up, fo foon as they thal] have  
received the repairs requifite to put them  
alfo in a found condition... Asa fuper-  
intending officer will be neceffary at each  
yard, his duties and emoluments, hitherto  
fixed by the executive, will be a more  
proper fubje&amp;t for legiflation. A commu-  
nication will be made of our progrefs in  
the execution of the law refpeéting the  
vellels directed to be fold.  
  
The fortifications of our harbours,  
more or lefs advanced, prefent confidera-  
tions of great difficulty. While fome of  
them are on a fcale fuficiently proportion-  
ed to the advantages of their pefition, to  
the efficacy of their prote&amp;ion, and the  
importance of the points within it, others  
are fo extenfive, will coft fo much in the  
firft ere&amp;tion, fo much in the maintenance,  
and require fuch a force to garrifon them,  
as to make it queftionable what is belt  
now to be done. A ftatement of thofe  
commenced or projected, of the expences  
already incurred, and eftimates of their  
future coft, as far as can be forefeen,  
fall be laid before you, that you may be  
enabled to judge whether any alteration ts  
neceflary in the laws refpetting this fub-  
ject.  
  
Agriculture, manufa&amp;ture, commerce,  
and navigation, the four pillars of our  
profperity, are then moft thriving, when  
left molt free to individual enterprife. Pro-  
teStion from cafual embarraffments, how-  
ever, may fometimes be feafonably inter-  
poled. If, in the courfe of your obferva-  
tions or enquiries, they fhould appear to  
need any aid, within the limits of our  
conflitutional powers, your fenfe of their  
importance is a fufficient affurance they  
will occupy your attention. We cannot,  
indeed, but all feel an anxious folicitude  
for the difficulties under which our carry-  
  
ing trade will foon be placed. How far it  
can be relieved, otherwife than by time, is  
a fubje&amp; of important confideration.  
  
The judiciary fyitem of the United  
States, and efpecially that portion of it  
recently ereéted, will of courfe prefent it-  
felf to the contemplation of congrefs ; and  
that they x | be able to judge of the pros  
portion which the inftitution bears to the  
bufinefs it has to perform, I have caufed  
to be procured from the feveral ftates, and  
now lay before congrefs, an exaé ftate-  
ment of all the caufes decided fince the firft  
eftablifhment of the courts, and of thofe  
which were depending’ when additional  
TT and judges were brought in to their  
aid.  
  
And while on the judiciary organiza-  
tion, it will be worthy your confideration  
whether the proteétion of the ineltimable  
inftitution of juries has been extended to  
all the cafes involving the fecurity of our  
perfons and property. Their impartial  
{Meétion alfo being effential to their value,  
we ought further to confider whether that  
is fufficiently fecured in thofe ftates where  
they are named by a marfhal depending on  
executive will, or defignated by the court  
or by officers dependant on them.  
  
I cannot omit recommending a revifal  
of the laws on the fubjeét of naturaliza-  
tion. Confidering the ordinary chances  
of human life, a denial of citizenfhip un-  
der a refidence of fourteen years, is a de-  
nial to a great proportion of thofe who afk  
it; and controls a policy purfued, from  
their firft fettlement, by many of thefe  
ftates, and ftill believed of confequence to  
their profperity. And thall we refule te  
the unhappy fugitives from diftrefs, that  
hofpitality which the favages of the wilder-  
nefs extended to our fathers arriving in  
this land? Shall opprefled humanity find  
no afylum on this globe? The conftitu-  
tion, indeed, has wifely provided that,  
for admiffion to&#x27;certain offices of impor-  
tant truft, a refidence fhall be required  
fufficient to develope chara@er and defign.  
But might not the general charaéter and  
capabilities of a citizen be fafely commu.  
nicated to every one manifefting a bona  
fide purpofe of embarking his life and fore  
tunes permanently with us ? witb reftrice  
tions, perhaps, to guard againft the frau.  
dulent ufurpation of our flag; an abufe  
which brings fo much embarraffinent and  
lofs on the genuine citizen, and fo much  
danger to the nation of being involved in  
war, that no endeavour fhould be {pared  
to defeé&amp;t and fupprefs it.  
  
vj is fellow. citizens, are the matters  
  
  
  
58  
  
refpeéting the ‘ftate of the nation, which I  
have thought of importance to be fubmit-  
ted to your confideration at this time.  
Some others of lefs moment, or not yet  
ready for communication, will be the fub-  
je&amp;t of feparate meffages. I am happy in  
this opportunity of committing the ar-  
duous affairs of our government to the col-  
lefted wifdom of the union.  
  
Nothing fhall be wanting on my part to  
inform, as far as in my power, the legif-  
lative judgment, nor to carry that judg-  
ment into faithful execution. The pru-  
dence and temperance of your difcuflions  
will promote, within your own walls, that  
conciliation which fo much befriends ra-  
tional conclufion, and by its example will  
encourage among our conftituents that

Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and House of Repres  
  
snetatives,  
It is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me,  
that on mecting the great council of our pasion, I am  
f  
  
COBRETT’s WEEKLY POLITICAL REGISTER,  
  
able to annotince to them, on grounds of reasonable  
Certainty, that the wars and troubles which have for  
$6 many years afflicted our sister-nations, have at  
length come to an end; and that the communica-  
tions of peace and commerce are once more opening  
among them. Whilst we devoutly return thanks to  
the beneficent Being, who has been pleased to breathe  
into then the spirit of conciliation and forgiveness,  
we are bound, with peculiar gratitude to be thankful  
to him that our own peace has been preserved through  
so perilous a season, and ourselves permitted quietly  
to cultivate the ‘earth, and to practise and imiprove  
those arts which tend increase our comforts.  
The assurances, indeed, of friendly disposition re-  
ceived from all the powers, with whom we have |  
  
to  
  
  
  
. * |  
principal relations, had inspiied a confidence that our |  
  
peace with them would not have been disturbed ; but  
a cessation of irregularities which had affected the  
fommerce of neutral nations, and of the irritations  
and injuries produced by them, cannot but add to this  
confidence, and strengthens at the same time, the  
hope, that wrongs committed on unoffending friends,  
ynder a pressure of circumstances, will now be re-  
viewed with ¢andour, and will be considered as found.  
ing just claims of retribution tor the past, and new as-  
surances for the future,  
  
Among our Indian neighbours, also, a spirit of |  
peace and friendship generally prevails; and I am  
happy to inform you, that the continued efforts to  
imtroduce among them the tmplements and the prac-  
tice of husbandry, and of the houshold arts, have not  
been without success: that they are becoming mere  
und more sensible of the superioniy of this depen-  
dence, for clothing and subsistance, over the precari-  
ous resources Of hunting and fishing; and already we  
are able to announce, that, instead of that constant  
diminution of their numbers, produced by their wars  
and their wants, some of them begin to experience an  
increase of population &#x27;  
  
To this state of general peace with which we have  
been blessed, one only exception exists: Tripoli, the  
Icast considerable of the Barbary, states, had come for-  
ward with demands unfounded either in right or in  
compact; and had permitted itself to denounce war,  
on our failure to comply before a given day. The  
style of the demand admitted but one answer. I sent  
asmall squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean,  
with assurances to that power of our sincere desire  
to remain in peace, but with orters to protect our  
commerce against the threatened attack. The  
measure was seasonable and salutary, The Bey had  
already declared war. His cruisers were out: two  
had arrived at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the Me-  
diterranean was blockaded: and that of the Atlantic  
in peril, The arrival of our squadron dispelled the  
danger: one of the Tripolitan cruisers having fallen  
in with and engaged the small schooner Enterprize  
commanded by Lieut. Sterrett, which had gone as a  
tender to our larger vessels, was captured after a  
héavy slaughter of her men, Without the loss of a  
single one.or our part. The bravery exhibited by our  
ciazens on thatclement, will, I trust be a testimony  
to the world, that it is not the want of that virtue  
which makes us seek their peace; but a conscien-  
tious desire to direct the energies of our nation to the  
noaltiplication of the human race, and not to its de-  
struction. Unaythorised by ‘the constitution, with.  
out the sanction of Congress, to go beyond. the li  
of defence, th sel being di oe eee  
ret c, the vesse being disabled from commit-  
authonisi f sg onder, ‘whether, “by

this subject, that in the exercise of the infportant func. |  
  
tion, confided by the constitution to the legislature 7  
  
exclusively, their judgment may form itself on a 7  
  
knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of J  
- a  
  
weight.  
  
I wish I could say that our situation with all the  
  
other Barbary States was entirely satisfactory. Dis. @  
  
covering that some delays had taken place in_ the per-  
formance of certain articles stipulated by us, I thought _  
it my duty by immediate measures for fulfilling them  
to vindicate to ourselves the tight of considering the  
  
effect of departure from a stipulation on their. side. -  
  
From the papers which will be laid before you, you  
will be enabled to judge, whether our treaties are re.  
garded by them as fixing at all the measures of their  
  
Oe  
  
demands; or as guarding from the exercise of force (7%  
  
our vessels within their power: and to consider how |  
  
far it will be safe and expedient to leave our. affairs  
with them in their present posture.  
  
1 lay before you the result of the census lately taken 77  
  
of our inhabitants, to a conformity with which wé are  
  
now to reduce the ensuing ratio of representation and |  
taxation. You will perceive that the increase of 7”  
  
numbers during the last ten years proceeding in gc  
ometrical ratio, promises a duplication in little more  
than twenty-two years; we contemplate this’ rapid  
growth, aud the prospect it holds up tous, not. with  
a view to the injuries it may eflable us to do to others  
m some future day, but to the settlement ‘of. the ex-  
tensive country, stil] remaining vacant within our  
limits; to the multiplication of men, susceptible of  
happiness, educated in the love of order; habituated  
to self-government, and valuing its blessings above all  
price.  
  
Other circumstances, combined with the increase  
of numbers, have produced an augmentation of reve- °  
nue arising from consumption in a ratio far beyond  
that of population alone, and though the changes 10  
foreign relations, now taking place, so desirably for  
the whole world, may for a season affect this brancvh  
of revenuc, yet weighing all probabilities of expense,  
as well as of income, there is reasonable ground ol  
confidence, that we may now safely dispense with all  
  
the internal taxes, comprehending excise, stamps, |=  
  
e &#x27;s  
  
auctions, licenses, Carriages, and refined sugars; t0 9  
  
which the postage of newspapers may be added to |  
facilitate the progress of information, and that the re-  
maining sources of revenue Will be sufficient to provide —  
for the support of government, to pay the interest of  
  
the public debts, and to discharge the principals withn @  
  
shorter periods than the laws, or the general expecta-  
  
tion had contemplated. War, indeed, and untoward &quot;=  
events may change this prospect of things, and call 7

sound principles will not justify our taxing the indus-  
try of our fellow citizens to accumulate treasure, for  
wars to happen we know not when, and which mich! |  
not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered |  
by that treasure. ;  
These views, however, of reducing our burthens, |  
are formed on the expectation, that a sensible, and 4!  
the same time a salutary reduction may take plac¢ |  
in our habitual expenditures: for this purpose, those |  
of the civil government, the army and navy, will |

Agriculture, manufactures, commerce, and navigation,  
the four pillars of our prosperity, are then most thriving  
when leit most free to individual enterprize. Protec-  
tien from casual embarrassments, however, may some-  
times be seasonably interposed; if in the course of  
your observations or inquiries, they should appear to  
need any aid, within the limits of our constitutional |  
powers, your sense of their importance ts a sufficient |  
assurance they will occupy your attention. ». We can-  
not indeed but all feel an anxious solicitude for the  
difference under which our carrying trade will soon be  
placed ; how far it can be relieved, otherwise than by  
time, is a subject of important consideration.  
  
The judiciary system of the United States, and  
especially that portion of it recently erected, will of  
course present itself to the contemplation of Congress,  
and that they may be able to judge of the proportion  
whieh the institution bears to the business it has to  
perform, I have caused to be procured from the seve-  
ral States, and now iay before Congress an exact |  
statement of all the causes decided since the firk |  
establishment of the courts, and of those which were |  
depending when additional courts and judges were  
brought into their aid.  
  
And while on the judiciary organization, it will be  
worthy your consideration, whether the protection of  
the inestimable institution of juries, has been extended  
to the cases involving the security of our persons and  
property. ‘Uheir impartial selection also being essen-  
tial to their value we ought further to consider whe-  
ther that is sufficiently secured in those States where |  
they are named by a marshal depending on executive  
will, or designated by the eourt, or by the officers de-  
pendant on them.  
  
J} cannot omit recommending a revisal of the laws  
on the subject of naturalization. Considering the or-  
dinary chances of human life, a denial of citizenship  
under a residence of fourteen years, is a denial to a  
great proportion of those who ask it; and controls a  
policy pursued from their first settlement, by mariy of  
these states, and still believed of consequence to their  
prosperity. And shall we refuse to the unhappy fugi-  
tives from distress, that hospitality which the savages  
of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in  
this land? Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum  
on this globe? The constitution indeed has wisely  
provided, that for admission to certain offices of im-  
portant trust, a residence shall be required sufficient  
to develope character and design, but might not the  
general character and capabilities of a citizen be safely  
communicated to every one manifesting a bond fide pur-  
pose of embarking his life and fortunes permanently with  
us?—with restrictions perhaps to guard against the frau-  
dulent usurpation of our flag ; an abuse which brings  
  
  
  
so much embarrassment and loss on the genuine citi- }  
  
zen, and so much danger to the nation of being in-  
volved in war, that no endeavour should be spared to  
detect and suppress it.  
  
These, fellow-citizens, are the matters respecting the  
state of the nation, which I have thought of import-  
ance to be submitted to your consideration at this  
time ; some others of less moment, or not yet ready  
pang pine will be the subject of separate  
  
Sages. Jam happy in this opportunity of com-  
mitting the arduous affairs of ony foveramcst to the  
collected wisdom of the union. Nothing shall be  
Wanting on my part to inform, as far as in my power,  
the legislative Judgnrent, how to carry that judgment  
into faithful execution. The prudence and temper-  
ance of Yt hae oh se will promote within your own &lt;  
walls, conciliation which so much ‘befriends  
rational conclusion: and by its example, will encou-

Fellow CitiziMJ of the Seuatet  
anJofthe Houfe ofReprefentatives,  
  
It if a circumllancc of fincere gratihca*  
tion to me, that on meeting the Great  
Council of the Nation, I am able to an¬  
nounce to them on grounds of reafonable  
certainty, that the wart and troubles  
which have for fo many years afflifled our  
filler nations, have at length come to an  
end, and that the communications of peace  
and commerce are once more opening  
among them. Whillt wc devoutly return  
thanks to the Beneficent Being who has  
been pleafed to breathe into them the fpirit  
of conciliation and forgivcnel&#x27;s, we are  
bound, with peculiar gratitude, to be  
thankful to Him that our own (&gt;eace has  
been preferved through fa perilous a lea-  
fon, and ourfelves permitted quietly to  
cultivate the earth, and to practice and  
improve thole arts which tend to encreale  
our comforts. The aliurances, indeed,  
of friendly difpofition received from all  
the Powers with whom we have principal  
relations, had infpired a confidence that  
our peace with them would not have  
been efidurbed. Rut a ceifation of the  
irregularities which has alBi^ed the com¬  
merce of neutral rations, and of the irri¬  
tations and injuries produced by them,  
cannot but add to this confidence j and  
ftrengthens, at the fame time, the hope,  
that wrongs committed on unoffending  
friends, under a pienfureof circumttances,  
will now be reviewed with candour, and  
wi!l beconlidercd as founding jull claims  
of retribution for the pad, and new alfu^  
ranees for the future.  
  
Among our Indian neighbours alfoa  
fpirit of peace and friendihip generally  
prevails, and I am hi^py to inform you  
that the continued efforts to introduce  
among them the implements and pra^ice  
^ of hufbandry, and of the houfchold arts,  
have not been without fuccefs r that they  
are become more and more lenftble of the  
fuperiority of this dcpcndancc, for cloth¬  
ing and fubfidence, over the precarious  
tclources of hunting and filhing t and  
jdready we at^e able to announce that,  
inftead of that condant diminution of  
their numbers produced by their wars  
tnd their wants, fome of them begin to  
^prricnce an increafe of population.  
  
To this (late of genenl peace, with  
which we have been bleffed, only one  
exception exids. Tripoli, &#x27;the lead  
confiderahle of the Barbary States, had .  
come forward with demands unfounded  
cither in right or in compact, and had  
permitted itlclf to denounce war, on onr *  
failure to comply before a given day.  
The flyle of the demand admitted but  
one anfwer. 1 lent a fmall iquadron of  
frigates into the Mediterranean, with  
alTurances to that power of our fiocere  
defire to remain in peace ) but with or-  
ders to proteA our commerce againfl the  
threatened attack. The mcafure was fea-  
fonable and falutary. The Dey had  
already declared war in form. Hit  
ciuizers were out. Two had arrived at  
Gibraltar. Our commetce in the Medi¬  
terranean was blockaded ; and that of  
the Atlantic in p^ril. The arrival of  
our Iquadron difpellcd the danger. One  
of the rripolitan cruisers having fallen in  
with and engaged the I&#x27;mall fehooner £r.-  
terprlze, commanded by Lieutenant Ster-  
ret, which had gone out as a tender to  
our larger veflcls, was captured, after a  
heavy flaughter of her men, without the  
lofs of a iingle one on our part. The  
bravery exhibited by our Citizens on that  
element, will, 1 trulf, be a teltimony to  
the world, that it it not a want of that  
virtue which makes us feek their peace ;  
but a conlcientious defire to dire^ the  
energies of our nation to the multiplica¬  
tion of the human race, and .not to its  
deltru6\ion. UnauthoriliKi by the Con-  
Ititutiun, without the lanflian of Con-  
grefs, to go beyond the line of defence,  
the velTel being dil&#x27;abled from committing  
further holtiliiics, was liberated with its  
crew. The Legillature will duubtlefa  
confidcr&#x27; whether, by authoriling mea-  
f&#x27;ures of offence alio, they will place our  
force on an equal footing with that of  
its adverrartes. 1 communicate all ma«  
terial information on this fubje^t, that  
in the cxercifc of the important fundioifi  
confided by the ConlHtution to the Le-  
gidature exclufivcly, their judgment may  
form itfelf on a knowledge and conl&#x27;tdera- .  
tion of every circumlfance of weight.  
  
I wifh 1 could fay that our fituatioo  
with all the other Barbary States was  
entirely laiisfa^^ory. Difeovering that  
fome delays had taken place in the per¬  
formance of certain articles ftipulated by  
us, 1 thought it roy duty, by immediate  
meafures foi fulfilling them, to vindicate  
to ourfelves the right of cohfidering the  
effect of departure from liipulation on  
their fide. From the paj^ii which will

has been preserved through so peril­

quietly to cultivate the earth, and to  
praitile and improve those arts which  
tend to increase our comforts. . The  
aflurance indeed of friendly disposition  
received from all the powers with &#x27;  
whom we have prineipal relations, had’  
inspired a confidence that our peace  
with them would not have been dis­  
turbed. But-a cessation of the irreg­  
ularities which had affli®ed the com­  
merce of neutral nations, and of the  
irritations and injuries’ producéd by  
them, canmnot-but “add to &#x27;this&#x27; confi-.

on unoffending friends, under a pres­

Other circusftances, combined with  
the increase of numbers, have produc­  
- ed an augmentation of revenae arifing’

. yond that of population’ alone ; and

now taking place so “desirably for the  
whole world, may for a season affe®  
&#x27; this branch of revenue, yet, weighing  
all. probabilities of expence, as well as..  
of income, there is reasonable ground  
~ of.confidence that We may pow fafely  
-~ dispense with all the internal m} *  
i comprehending &#x27; excises, {tamps, ‘auc­  
_tiops, licénfes, carriages. dnd refin­  
‘ edfugars : to which the postage on:  
new{papers may be added to facilitate  
the progress of information : and that  
_the remaining sources of revenue will  
be fufficient to provide for the fup­  
© port of government, to pay the inter­  
et ofithe puablic debts,and to discharge”  
| the prinicipals in shorter periods than  
  
Tt HE  
  
the laws, or the general expeétation  
had contemplated. War, indeed, &amp;  
un-toward events may change this  
profpeé of things, aand call for ex­  
penses which the imposts could not  
meet. DBut found principles will not  
jultify our taxing the industry of eur  
fellow citizens to accumulate treasure  
for wars to happen weknow not when,  
and which might not perhaps,happen,  
but from the temptations offered by |  
that treasure. . |  
These views, however, of reducing |  
cur burthens, are formed on the ex- !  
pe&amp;ation, that a sensible, at the {ame  
time, a salutary redution may take j  
place in our habitual expenditures. |  
For this purpofe,thofe of the civil gov- l  
ernment, the army and navy will need ‘  
revifal. When we confider that this  
government is charged with the ex­  
ternal and mutual relations only of  
these states that the states themselves  
have principle care of our persons, our ;  
property; and our reputation 3 consti­  
tuting the great field of‘human con­  
cerns, we may well doubt whether our  
organization is not too comphcated,  
too expensive ; whether offices and  
officers have not been multiplied un­  
necessarily, and sometimes injuriously  
to the service they were meant to pro­  
mote. I will cause to be laid before  
you an essay towards a {tatement, of  
those who, under public employment  
of varipus kinds, draw money from -  
the treasury, or from our citizens.  
Time has not permitted a perfe&amp; enu­  
meration, the ramifications of office be­  
g too multiplied and remote to be  
compleatly traced in a firlt trial—A­  
mong those who are dependent on ex­  
ecutive discretion, I have begun the  
reduétion of what was deemied unne­  
cessary. ‘The expences of diplomatic  
agency have been considerably dimin­  
ithed. The in{pectors of interval rev- |  
enue, who were found to obstruct the  
accountability of the institution, have  
been discontinued.— Several agencies,  
created by Executive authority,on fal-|  
aries fixed by that also, have been fup­  
prefled, and {hould fuggelt the expe- {  
diency of regulating that power by  
law, o as to fubjeé its exercises to lc-{  
giflative infpe&amp;ion and fanétion. O­  
ther reformations of the famekind will  
be pursued with that caution which is  
requisite, in removing -useless things,  
not to injure what is retained. But  
the great mass of public officers is.ef­  
tablifhed by law, and therefore by law  
alone can be abolished. Should ‘the  
legislature think it expedient to paf3  
this roll in review,and to try all itsparts  
by the test of public utility, they may  
be aflured of everyaid and light whi‘d\
‘executive ifformation can yield. Con!  
ifidering the general tendency to mul\%  
itiply offices and dependencies, and to&#x27;  
ncreafe expence to the ultimate term  
«&amp;f burthen which the citizen can bear  
1t behoves us, to avail ourselves of ev­  
eiry occasion which presents itfelf for  
taking off the fur charge ; thatit nev­  
e;r may be f{een here, that, after leav­  
‘mg to labour the fmalf:&amp;.’portiﬁn of  
its earnings on which it can fubfilt, go­  
vernment shall itfelf consume the refi­  
‘due of what it was inflituted to guard.  
In our care too of the public cen-’  
tributions entrusted to our dire&amp;ion,  
it would be prudent to multiply bar­  
riers against their diflipation, by ap­  
propriating fpecific &#x27; sums to every fpe­  
cific purpose susceptible of definition:  
by disallowing all applications of mo­  
-ney varying from the appropriation  
_ in obje&amp; or transcending it namount ;  
, by reducing the undefined field of con­  
~ tingencies,and thereby circumferibing  
-discretionary powers over money ; &amp;  
by bringing back to a single depart­  
ment all accountabilities - for money;  
wherethe examinatjonmay be prompt,  
~ efficacious and uniform. = |  
- An account of the receipts and ex­  
penditures of the last z&quot;eapr, as prepar­  
ed by the tecretary of the Treasury,  
will, as usual, be laid before you. The  
{uccefs which has attended the late  
&quot; sales of the public lands &#x27;{hews/that,

impprtarit source of receipt. Among

fideration of all the pofis and Rations  
where garrisons will be expedient, and  
of the number of men requisite for  
each garrison. The whole amount  
I considerably short of the present mil­  
ary eftablithment. For the surplus  
no particular use can be pointed out.  
For defence againit invasion, their  
number is as nothing ; nor is it con­  
sidered needful o 1 fafe that a Randing:  
army should be kept up, in time of  
peace, for that purpose. Uncertain  
as we mult ever be of the particular  
point in&#x27;our circumference where an  
enemy may choose to invade us, the  
only force which can be ready at ev­  
ery point, and competent to oppose  
them, is the body of neighboring cit­  
izens, as. formed into a militia. - On  
these, colle@ed from the parts noft  
convenient, in numbers proportioned  
to the invading force, it is best to re­  
ly not only to meet the firft attack,  
but if it threatens to be permanent, to  
maintainthe defenceuntilregularsmay  
beengaged to relieve them. These  
considerations remder it important that  
we should, at every {effion, contifige  
to amend the defeéts, which from time  
to time shew themselves, in the laws  
for regulating the militia, until they  
are fufficiently perfe&amp; : nor should we  
now, or at any time, separate, until we  
can {ay we have dose every thing for  
the militia, which we could do, were  
an enemy at our door,  
The provision of military stores on  
hand will be laid before you, that you  
may judge of the additions fill requi­  
site.  
  
- With refpe&amp; to the extent to which  
our naval preparations should be car­  
ried, some difference of opinion may  
be expected to appear : but jult atten~  
tion to the circumstances of every part  
of the union will doubtless recongile  
all. A small force will probably cohs  
tinue to be wanted, for actual service 7  
in the Mediterranean. Whatever an«  
nual {um beyond that yocu may think  
proper to appropriate to naval prepare  
ations, would perhaps be better em­  
ployedin providing thofearticles which  
may be kept without waste or cons  
fumption, and be in readiness when  
any exigence calls them inro ufe.~  
Progress has been made as will appear  
by papers now communicated, in pro.  
viding materials for {eventy-four-gune  
{hips as-direcled by law,  
How far the authority given by the  
legislature for procuring and establish.  
ing sites for naval purposes, has been  
perfectly understood and pursued in  
the execution, admits of foine doubt.  
A statement of the expences already  
incured on that fabje@ shall be laid  
before you. I havein certain cases  
suspended or slackened these expendi­  
tures, that the legislature might deter­  
mine whether so many yards are ne­  
ceflary as havl been contemplated.  
The works at this place are among  
those permitted to go on : and five of  
\the seven frigates direéted to be laid  
up, have been brought and laid up  
\here, where, befides&#x27;the fafety of their  
position, they are under the eye of the  
| executive adwiniftration, as well as of  
its agents, and where yourselves also  
will be guided by your ewn view,in the  
legislative provisions refpeding them  
which may from time to time bé ne­  
~ceflary. They are preserved in such  
L condition, as well the veflels as what-  
  
ever belongs to them,. as to be at all  
times ready for sea on a fhogt warn­  
ing. Two others ar:ﬂyct to be laid  
up, so soon as they fhail have receiv.  
ed the repairs Trequifite to put them  
also into found condition. Asa {u.  
perintending officer - will be neceflary  
at each yard, his duties and emolus«  
merits, hitherto Sxed by the Executive,  
will be a more proper fubje&amp; for le­  
gislation. A communicationr will al­  
-1o be madg of our progress in the ex­  
ecution of the law refpefting the vest  
fels direted to be fold. = 5  
The fortifications of our harbors, .  
more or less advanced, present consid­  
erations of . great difficulty. While  
some of them are on a scale fufficient»  
ly proportioned to the advantages of  
their position, to the efficacy of. their  
pr&quot;otégioq,‘_ and the-importance of the  
points within it, others are so éxten.

&quot;It is a circumstance of sincere &#x27;  
gratification to me, that on meeting  
the great council of the nation, I am  
able to announce to them on grounds  
of reasonable certainty, that the wars  
and troubles, which have for so many  
years afflicted our sister nations, have  
gth come toan end; and that.the  
ications of peace and &lt;  
merco are once more opening an  
them. Whilst we devoutly return;  
thanks to the beneficent Being who :  
been pleased to breathe into them j  
the spirit of conciliation and forgive-:  
ness, \vo are bound, with peculiar [  
gratitude, to be thankful to him that j  
our own peace has been preserved  
through so perilous a season, and our- i  
selves permitted quietly to cultivate  
the earth, and to practise and improve  
those arts which tend to increase our  
ports. The assurances indeed  
loudly disposition received from  
the powers with whom we have &#x27;  
principal relations, had in-pi;  
confidence that our peace with them  
would not hive been disturbed*. Hut

«With respect to the extent which our naval preparations  
should be carried, some difference of opinion may be expected to  
appear; but just attention to the circumstances of every part of  
the union, will doubtless reconcile all. A small force will  
probably continue to be wanted, for actual service, in the Medi.  
terranean. Whatever annual sum beyond that you may think  
proper to appropriate to naval preparations, would perhaps be  
better employed in providing those articles which may be  
kept without waste or consumption, and be in readiness when  
any exigence calls them into use.”

“T sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean,  
with assurances to that power, (‘Tripoli,) of our sincere desire  
to remain at peace; but with orders to protect our commerce  
against the threatened attack. The measure was seasonable  
and salutary. The Bey had already declared war in form  
—his cruizers were out—two had arrived at Gibraltar—our  
commerce in the Mediterranean was blockaded, and that of  
the Atlantic in peril—the arrival of our squadron dispelled  
the danger—one of the Tripolitan cruizers having fallen in with  
and engaged the small schooner Enterprize, commanded by  
lieutenant Sterrett, which had gone out as a tender to our  
larger vessels, was captured, after a heavy slaughter of her  
men, without the loss of a single man on our part. The brave-  
ry exhibited by our citizens on that element, will, I trust, be a  
testimony to the world, that it is not a want of that virtue,  
which makes us seek their peace. Unauthorized by the con-  
stitution without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the  
line of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing fur-  
ther hostilities, was liberated with its crew. The legislature  
will, doubtless, consider, whether, by authorizing measures of  
offence also, they will place our oo on an equal footing  
with that of its adversaries.” |  
  
“T wish [ could say that our situation with all the other  
  
rbary states was entirely satisfactory.”

Things to be Remembered.  
During Gen. Washington&#x27;s administration  
a law was enacted by Congress, with his ap­  
probation, granting the rights of naturaliza­  
tion and citizenship to Foreigners after a re­  
sidence of two years in the country. This  
was altered by the Federal administration of  
the elder Adams, who succeeded Washington,  
to fourteen years I But when Mr. Jefferson,  
the great Apostle of Democracy, came into  
power in 1801, the time of probation was re­  
duced to five years, where it has ever since  
remained In his first Message to Congress,  
Mr. Jefferson said :  
I cannot omit recommending a revisal of  
the laws on the subject of naturalization Con­  
sidering the ordinary chances of human life,  
a denial of citizenship under a residence of  
fourteen years is a denial to a great portion  
of those who ask it, and controls a policy  
pursued from their first settlement by many  
of these States, and still believed of conse­  
quence to their posterity. And shall we re­  
fuse the unhappy fugitive from distress that  
hospitality which the savages of the wilder­  
ness extended to our fathers, arriving in this  
land ? Shall oppressed humanity find&#x27; no asy­

deed, has wisely provided that, for admission

extract from his message to Congress,  
Dec. 8, 1801:  
  
“The judiciary system of the United States,  
and especially that portion of it recently erect-  
ed, will, of course, present itself to the contem-  
plation of Congress; and, that they may be  
able to judge of the proportion which the in-  
stitution bears to the business it has to perform,  
I have caused to be procured from the several  
states, and now lay before Congress, an exact  
statement of all the causes decided since the  
first establishment of the courts, and of those  
which were depending when additional courts  
and judges were brought in to their aid.  
  
“ And, while on the judiciary organization,  
it will be worthy your consideration, whether  
the protection of the inestimable institution  
of juries has been extended to all the cases  
involving the security of our persons and  
property.  
  
“Their impartial selection also being essen-  
tial to their value, we ought further to consider  
whether that is sufficiently secured in those  
states where they are named by a martial de-  
pending on executive will, or designated by  
the court, or by officers dependent on them.”

revenue arising from consumption in a ratio far be­

changes of foreign relations now taking place, so de­  
sfrable for the world, may for a season affect this  
branch of revenue, yer, welghing all probabilities of  
expense, as well as of income, there is reasonable  
ground of conndence that we may now safely  
dispense with all the internal taxes, com­
