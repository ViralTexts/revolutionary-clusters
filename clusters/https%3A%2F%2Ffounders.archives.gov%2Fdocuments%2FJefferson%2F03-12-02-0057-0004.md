Agreeably to previous arrangements, the masonic Societies of Charlottesville Nos 90 60 &amp; 90 convened on Monday the 6th day of October, to aid their fellow citizens at albemarle &amp; the circumjacent counties in laying the corner stone of the Central College; which by the liberality of the public &amp; the generous aid of the State legislature, called for the above ceremony at an earlier day than we contemplated; it being only a month or two anterior to this occasion that the subscription papers were exhibited to the Subscribers—The morning was fair &amp; mild; &amp; tho’ at one period of the day the heavens were partially overclouded, yet, th it again broke off,  &amp; nothing transpired to interrupt  the pleasing &amp; gratifying task. The interest which the public seemed to take in this first effort of Va was to every one a  high &amp; delightful evidence of the liberal spirit of our people—it was a sure presage, that their aid &amp; support will be never wanting in the advancement of learning &amp; education—that their  hearts &amp; their purses are open to the great cause of humanity &amp; the amelioration of the condition of man on earth. It was the court day of the County &amp; superior court of Albemarle—yet the judges descended from their bench, the people deserted their temple of justice, the houses were shut, business of all kinds suspended, and in one rolling tide the multitude pressed to the spot where the this first Scion twig of Science was to be planted. It was indeed a scene worthy the best feelings of our nature—not only as to the cause which had summoned so large &amp; respectable a body of citizens together but the further grateful  phenomonon of witnessing in the procession  two ex-presidents &amp; the present chief majistrate of the union, forming three of the six visitors who by law, are the guardians of this institution. The societies having arrived at the site a line was formed before the stone, the W. G. M. in directly in front,

&quot;Agreeably to previous announcement,  
the Masonic Societles of Charlottesville,  
Nes. 2 and A convened on Monday, 6th  
day of October, to ald their fellow-citizens  
of Albemarle and circumjacent counties  
in laying the corner-stone of the Central  
Coltege, which, by the liberality of the  
public and the generous ald of the State  
Legislature, called for the above cere-  
mony at an earlier day than was contem-­  
plated; it being only a month or two  
antertor to this occasion that the sub-­  
scription papers were exhibited to the  
ibers  
The morning was fine and mild. The  
interest which the publlc seemed to take  
in this effort of Virginia was to every  
one a high and delightrul evidence of the  
spirit of our people. It was a sure pre­  
eage that their aid and support will never  
be wanting in the advancement of learn­  
ing and education; that their hearts and  
their purses are open to the great cause  
of humanity, and the amelforation of the  
on of man on earth. It was the  
 court-day of the County and Superior  
courts of Albemarle, yet the judges de.­  
d from their bench the people de-­  
serted their temples of justice, the houses  
were shut, business of all kinds sucpend-  
ed, and in one rolling tide the multitudes  
pressed to spot where the first twig of  
science was to be planted. It was in-  
deed a scene worthy of the best feelings of  
our nature--not only as to the cause, which  
had summoned so large and reputable  
a body of citizens together, but the fur-  
ther grateful phenomenon of witnessing  
in the procession two ex-presidents and  
the present Chief Magistrate of the  
Union, forming three of the six visitors  
who by law are the guardians of the in-  
stitution, the other three being General  
John H. Cocke, Mr. David Watson, and  
Mr. Joseph C. Cabell.  
The secretary then deposited in the  
stone as follows: A phial containing a  
piece of parchment, on which was writ-  
ten: &quot;Laid by Lodges Nos. 60 and 80 on  
the 6th day of October, A. L. $817, A. D.  
1817, Alexander Garrett. Right Worthy  
Grand Master: Allen Dawson. Deputy  
Grand Master; Rev. William King, Grand  
Chaplain; John M. Perry, Architect.&quot;  
On the epposite side: &quot;Visitors of the
