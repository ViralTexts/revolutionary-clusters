Sir,  
Paris 26 November 1805.  
  
I had the honor, within the last week, of receiving your letter of the 25th. of August—expressing the Sollicitude of the parties interested in the Ship New Jersey and Cargo, least “their claim should be rejected on the idea, that the rights of the insured, did not pass to the insurers;” and communicating also the opinion of the President, that “American underwriters, who had paid the loss to the original owners, citizens of the United States, were entitled to the benefits of the treaty of 1803.”  
In my next dispatch I shall furnish you with documents, from which you will see, that the difficulties in this case, have in no Stage of it, arisen from the causes to which they have been ascribed; that it’s admission by the American board was long suspended under Colo. Mercer’s objection, that, “no evidence had been produced of the insolvency of the captors”; that its rejection, by the Council General of liquidation, proceeded from the belief, that “the Ship and Cargo were partially, or altogether, British property; and from certain other causes”—and that when this belief concerning the national character of the property was done away by the production of certain policies of insurance, which had been effected in different parts of the United States, (but which till then had been carefully kept out of sight) the claim, so far from being opposed on the principle that “the rights of the insured did not vest in the insurers” as indeed on any other principle, was, on my suggestion, sent back to the council, relieved from the first and apparently the principal objecti[o]n, and left subject only to the “other causes” mentioned in the rejecting Arrete of the 28 of Frimaire. These “other causes” are fully exhibited in the report of the Director of the 4th. Division, dated on the 15 Germinal, and may be digested into the following heads—  
  
1st.  
that the judgment of the 17 Prairial year ⟨6⟩;. pronouncing the confiscation of the N. Jersey &amp; cargo is still subsisting—inasmuch as it has not been annulled by the decree of the Council of Prizes, which directs only, the restitution of the sum deposited by the owners with Gen. Hedouville.  
2d.  
that the claimants having neglected to prosecute their appeal within six years after the capture, were precluded, by the laws of France, from a right of appealing.  
3d.  
that the New Jersey, not having a role d’Equipage, as provided by the treaty of 1778, was excluded from the provisions of the 4th. Article of the treaty of 1800.  
4th.  
that the Capt and Agent of the Privateer, not having been heard in their defense, nor even summoned to appear before the Tribunal, the decree of the Council of Prizes was illegal.  
5th.  
that no evidence having been produced of the abandonment of the Ship and Cargo to the Underwriters, and the Agents having even denied the right of either Government to question them with regard to an abandonment of the property, and having besides acknowledged, that the original owners, or a part of them, had acquired the N. Jersey by a new title; by yielding to the Underwriters “Un droit convenable de reprise dans le depot”—it may be fairly inferred, that the loss never was paid by the insurers, &amp; that the receits (which by the way do not correspond in number with the policies), are merely fictitious.  
  
&amp; 6th. that were it in proof that the owners had abandoned, and that the under-writers had paid, still the Claim of the latter could not be admitted—inasmuch as it could not now be liquidated under the rules prescribed by the Treaty—the American Commission having no longer an existence.  
  
You will readily perceive that in all this, there is not a single syllable pointed at the rights of insurers “who have paid the loss of the original owner.” It only remains for me therefore to shew, that in no after act either of the Council or of Mr Marbois &amp; myself, was the broad principle which has given So much alarm to our under-writing Citizens, or even the qualified one to be found in the President’s opinion, adopted or applied to the case of the N.J. The report, of which I have already given you the Substance, not having been agreed to by all the members of the Council, and the Liquidator Genl. not choosing to decide the difference, transmitted the case a second time to the Treasury with a wish, that Mr. Marbois &amp; myself might determine it. We complied with this wish—we did determine it, and admitted it for its’ full proportion of the Marginal fund. It is true, that Mr. Marbois &amp; I differed somewhat concerning this proportion. He, would have given 333,000 francs, whereas I, thought that 300,000 were quite as many as fell to its share; and that you will think as I did, I have no doubt, when I inform you, that there are claims amounting to more than Three Millions, as sound in point of principle, less objectionable in point of form &amp; better recommended by the pecuniary circumstan[c]es of the Claimants, for which I have not yet got a Single sous. In my last letter I gave you the co

We complied with this wish—we did de­

true that Mr. Marbois and I differed  
somewhat concerning this proportion.  
He would have given 333,000 francs,  
whereas I thought that 300,000 were  
quite as many as fell to its share ; and  
that you will think as I did, I have no  
doubt, when I inform you, that there  
are claims amounting to more than  
three millions, as sound in point of prin­  
ciple, less Objectionable in point of term,  
and better recommended by the peed- I  
niary circumstances of the claimants,  
for which I have not yet got a single

Secntarij of State, dated furis, Xovcmber 26  
1805. ’  
“ 1 &gt;&gt;ad the honour within the last Week, of receiv­  
ing your letter of the 25tli of August, expressing tiie  
solicitude of the parties interested m the ship New­  
  
iiiuuign, least tucir ci.iim Miotild he reject­  
ed on the idea, that the rights of the insured did not  
pass to the insurers;” and communicating also the  
opinion of the President, that “ American under­  
writers who had paid the loss to the original owners,  
f UueMs of the lT. States, were entitled to the bene­  
fit, of the treaty of 1803.”  
In my next dispatches I shall furnish vou with doc­  
meiits from which you will see, that the difficulties  
in this case, h iving in no stage of it, arisen from the  
causes to which they have been ascribed ; that its  
admission by the American board was long suspend­  
ed under col. Mercer’s objections, that “ noevid&#x27;mee  
had been produced of the insolvency of the captors,”  
that its rejection by the council general-of liquidation  
proceeded from the belief, that “the ship and car­  
go were partially, or altogether, British property_  
mil from certain other causes”—and that when this  
belief concerning the national character of the pro­  
perty was done away by the production of certain  
policies of insurance, which had been effected in dif­  
ferent parts of the U. States, (!mt wldi h till then had  
becu carefully kept out cf sight) the claim so fur from  
r

Uie ■iisiiu-d &lt;]i.l not vest in the insurers,&quot; or indeed  
on any other principle, was &lt;&gt;o ov suggestion sent,  
hack to the council, relieved from the first and ap­  
parently the principal objection, and left the subject  
only to the 11 other c iuxvs&quot; mentioned in the reject­  
&#x27;NS? arretc of the dStli Frimaire. These “ other cau­  
ses” are fully exhibited in the report of the Director’  
of the 4th division, dated on the loth Germinal, aud  
unv be digested into tiie following heads  
1st. That the judgment of the lT&#x27;tii F r.iirial, y ear  
o, pronouncing .the confiscation of the Mew-Jersey,  
aud cargo, i» ftti’.f subsisting, in ismjcll as it lias not

which directs only, the restitution) of the sum depo­  
sited bv the owner with gen. Iledtiuville.  
lid. F.iat the claimants having neglected to prose­  
cute their appeal within 6 years after the capture  
v.ere precluded by the laws of France, from a right  
ot appealing. “  
5d. That the Mew Jersey not hav mg n nie d&#x27;e­  
quipage, as provided hv the tre ity of 1773, was ok­  
cluded from the provisions of the 4th arli.leat&#x27; the  
treaty of 1BG0.  
4i.’a. That the c iptain and agent of the privateer’  
not having been heard in their defence, nor even  
summoned to appear before the tribunal, the decree  
of the con util of prizes was illegal.  
Sth. Th it no evidence li iving been produced of the­  
abandonment ot the ship and cargo to the unberwri­  
trrs, and the agents h iving even denied the right of  
coiluo- government to question them with regard to an  
abandonment of the property, and having besides  
a&lt;.k!n&gt;wledgi,d th tf the orient! owners, or a part of  
tiiein, had acquired the Mow-Jersey bv anew title;  
in yielding tat.ic underwriters, “ un droit cenvna­  
(&gt; ■■ ae re,;,r:»e dun* te it m ly be fairly inferred -  
t i it the loss never was paid by the insurers, and  
t.aat tae receipts (which hv the way do not corres­  
|tou:l in number with polices) are merely fictitious, and,  
Oth. loot were it in proof tint the owners had  
abandoned, and that the underwriters had paid, still  
the claim of the bitter could not he admitted, inas­  
much as it could not now he liqni lrted under the  
rules prescribed bv the treaty—the American com­  
mission having no longer an existence, &#x27;  
You vvid readily perceive that in all this there is  
not a single syllable pointed at the rights of insurers  
“ wb-• have paid the loss of the original owners.” It  
only remains for me, therefore, to shew, that in no  
niter act either of the council of ,,1 Mr. Marbois and  
myself, was the blond piinciple which has given so  
much a! non to our underwriting citizens, or even the  
the qualified one tube found in the President’s opini­  
on, adapted or applied to the c ue of the Nevv-Jer­  
srV 1 he report of which 1 have already given you  
tne substance, not lining been .agreed to by all the  
members of the Coenr.il, and the liquidator general  
not chasing to decide the difference, transmitted the  
case a second time to the treasury, with a wish that  
Mr. Mirbois and mvsclf might determine it—\V&gt;  
complied wiih this wish—we did determine it, and  
.y.untied it for its lull proportion of the marginal  
laud. It is true lint Mr. Marbois and 1 differed  
somewhat concerning this proportion. He would  
have given 333,000 francs, whereas I thought that  
300,000 were quite as many as fell to its share ; and  
that you w;!! flunk as I did, I have no doubt, when I  
inform you, to it there are claims amounting to moca  
t.mn three millions, an sound in point of principle  
less objectionable in point of form, and better rccorr­  
mended by the pecuniary circumstances of the claim­  
ants, lor which I have not yet got a single sous.&quot;

carefully kept out of sight) the claim so far  
from being -opposed on the principle that  
&#x27; the rights of the insured did not vest in the  
insurers,&quot; or indeed on any other principle,  
wasori my suggestion sent back to the coun­  
&#x27; cil, relieved from the first and apparently the  
principal objection, and left the subject only  
to the &quot; other causes&quot; .mentioned iu the re­  
jecting arrete of the 28th of Friinaire.­  
These &quot; other causes&quot; are fully exhibited  
in the report of the Directory of the 4th di­  
vision, dated en the 15th Germinal, and may  
be digested into the following heads: .  
; &#x27; - 1st. That the judgment. of the 17th  
Prairial, year- 6, pronouncing the confiscation  
of the New-Jersey and car&amp;o, is still subsist­  
iflg inasmuch, as it has not been annulled  
by the decree of the council of prizes, which  
directs only,-the-restitution of the sum de­  
posited by the owner with general lledou-  
, vill. &#x27; : ; ; v-v &#x27; . ,, ; . . ,  
M 2d. That the claimants having neglected  
to prosecute their appeal within six years af­  
ter the capture, were precluded, by the laws  
of France, from a right of appealing.  
3d. That the New-Jersey not having  
role d&#x27;equipage, as provided by the treaty of  
1T78, was excluded from the provisions of the  
4th article of the treaty of 1800.  
4th. That the captain and agent of the  
privateer not having been heard in their de­  
fence, nor even summoned to appear before  
the tribunal, the decree of the council of  
prizes was illegal.  
-J 5th. That no evidence&#x27; having been pro­  
duced of the abandonment of the ship and  
cargo to. the underwriters, and the agents  
having even deniedthc right of their govern  
ment to question them with regatd to an a­  
bdrtdonment of the property, snd having be­  
sides acknowledged that the original owners,  
or -a part of them, hnd acquired the New­  
Jersey by a new title; by idlingto the un­  
derwriters, uj&quot; droit cr.nenatle Je nprue  
dans Li depot&quot; it&#x27;may be f tiily inferred, that  
thejossneverwaspaidby the insurers and that  
the receipts (whi.:h by ihe&#x27; M ay do not corres­  
pind in number with the policies) are merely  
fictitious, and  
&quot; Clh. That were it in proof that theowntrs  
had abandoned, and that the underwriters  
hud paid, still the cl.iim of the latter could  
not be admitted inasmuch as it could not now  
be liquidated under the rules prescribed by  
.the treaty the Anicritan commission hav­  
ing no longer an existence.  
You wilt readily perceive that in all this  
there is not a tinlo ayllabie ointed at the  
rights of iniurers, &quot; who have p&#x27;dd the loss  
or the original owners.&quot; It only remains  
for me, therefore to hew, that in no after act  
if her of the council or of Mr. Muibois and  
inyitir, was the broad principle which has  
iv&#x27;tii ko much alarm to our underwriting ci-1  
tir;ns, or even the qualified one to be found  
in the Picsider.t&#x27;s opinion, adapted or applied  
to the rate of the New-Ji&#x27;isey -The report  
of winch 1 have tdrcady given you the sub.  
stance, not having been agreed to by all the  
jr.cmb&#x27;TS of the council, and the liquidator

ences, transmitted the case a second time to  
theUcaiury. with a wlh that Mr. Marbois  
and myarlf might determinate it t

it, and admitted it for its full proportion cf

rircponion. He would have given 333,000

quite as many as fell to its share ; and that  
fou think as I did, I have no doubt, when  
inform you, that there are claims amount,
