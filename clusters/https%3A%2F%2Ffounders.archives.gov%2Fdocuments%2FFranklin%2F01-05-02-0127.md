Sir,  
Boston, Dec. 22, 1754  
Since the conversation your Excellency was pleased to honour me with, on the subject of uniting the Colonies more intimately with Great Britain, by allowing them Representatives in Parliament, I have something further considered that matter, and am of opinion, that such an Union would be very acceptable to the Colonies, provided they had a reasonable number of Representatives allowed them; and that all the old Acts of Parliament restraining the trade or cramping the manufactures of the Colonies, be at the same time repealed, and the British Subjects on this side the water put, in those respects, on the same footing with those in Great Britain, ’till the new Parliament, representing the whole, shall think it for the interest of the whole to re-enact some or all of them: It is not that I imagine so many Representatives will be allowed the Colonies, as to have any great weight by their numbers; but I think there might be sufficient to occasion those laws to be better and more impartially considered, and perhaps to overcome the private interest of a petty corporation, or of any particular set of artificers or traders in England, who heretofore seem, in some instances, to have been more regarded than all the Colonies, or than was consistent with the general interest, or best national good. I think too, that the government of the Colonies by a Parliament, in which they are fairly represented, would be vastly more agreeable to the people, than the method lately attempted to be introduced by Royal Instructions, as well as more agreeable to the nature of an English Constitution, and to English Liberty; and that such laws as now seem to bear hard on the Colonies, would (when judged by such a Parliament for the best interest of the whole) be more chearfully submitted to, and more easily executed.  
I should hope too, that by such an union, the people of Great Britain and the people of the Colonies would learn to consider themselves, not as belonging to different Communities with different Interests, but to one Community with one Interest, which I imagine would contribute to strengthen the whole, and greatly lessen the danger of future separations.  
It is, I suppose, agreed to be the general interest of any state, that it’s people be numerous and rich; men enow to fight in its defence, and enow to pay sufficient taxes to defray the charge; for these circumstances tend to the security of the state, and its protection from foreign power: But it seems not of so much importance whether the fighting be done by John or Thomas, or the tax paid by William or Charles: The iron manufacture employs and enriches British Subjects, but is it of any importance to the state, whether the manufacturers live at Birmingham or Sheffield, or both, since they are still within its bounds, and their wealth and persons at its command? Could the Goodwin Sands be laid dry by banks, and land equal to a large country thereby gain’d to England, and presently filled with English Inhabitants, would it be right to deprive such Inhabitants of the common privileges enjoyed by other Englishmen, the right of vending their produce in the same ports, or of making their own shoes, because a merchant, or a shoemaker, living on the old land, might fancy it more for his advantage to trade or make shoes for them? Would this be right, even if the land were gained at the expence of the state? And would it not seem less right, if the charge and labour of gaining the additional territory to Britain had been borne by the settlers themselves? And would not the hardship appear yet greater, if the people of the new country should be allowed no Representatives in the Parliament enacting such impositions? Now I look on the Colonies as so many Counties gained to Great Britain, and more advantageous to it than if they had been gained out of the sea around its coasts, and joined to its land: For being in different climates, they afford greater variety of produce, and materials for more manufactures; and being separated by the ocean, they increase much more its shipping and seamen; and since they are all included in the British Empire, which has only extended itself by their means; and the strength and wealth of the parts is the strength and wealth of the whole; what imports it to the general state, whether a merchant, a smith, or a hatter, grow rich in Old or New England? And if, through increase of people, two smiths are wanted for one employed before, why may not the new smith be allowed to live and thrive in the new Country, as well as the old one in the Old? In fine, why should the countenance of a state be partially afforded to its people, unless it be most in favour of those, who have most merit? and if there be any difference, those, who have most contributed to enlarge Britain’s empire and commerce, encrease her strength, her wealth, and the numbers of her people, at the risque of their own lives and private fortunes in new and strange countries, methinks ought rather to expect some preference.  
With the greatest respect and esteem I have the honour to be Your Excellency’s most obedient and most humble servant.

SIR),  
  
INCE the converſation your Excellency  
  
was pleaſed to honour me with, on the  
ſabje&amp; of uniting the Colonies more inti-  
mately with Great Britain, by allowing them  
repreſentatives in parliament, I have ſome-

they had a reaſonable number of repreſenta-

acts of parliament, reſtraining the trade, or  
cramping the manufactures of the Colonies,  
be at the ſame time repealed ; and the Bri-  
tiſh ſubjects, on this ſide the water, put, in  
thoſe reſpects, on the ſame footing with  
thoſe in Great Britain, till the new parlia-  
ment, repreſenting the whole, thall think it  
for the intereſt of the whole to re- enact ſome  
or all of them.  
  
It  
  
( 117 )  
It is not that I imagine ſo many repre-  
ſentatives will be allowed the Colonies, as  
  
  
but I think there might be ſufficient to oc-  
- caſion thoſe laws to be better and more im-  
partially conſidered ; and perhaps to over-  
come the private intereſt of a petty corpo-  
ration, or of any particular ſet artificers or  
traders in England ; who heretofore ſeem, in  
ſome inſtances, to have been more regarded  
than all the Colonies, or than was conſiſtent  
with the general intereſt, or beſt national  
good. I think too, that the government of  
the Colonies by a parliament, in which they  
are fairly repreſented, would be vaſtly more  
agreeable to the people, than the method  
lately attempted to be introduced by royal  
inſtructions, as well as more agreeable to  
the nature of an Engliſh conſtitution, and to  
Engliſh liberty: And that ſuch laws, as  
now ſeerr to be hard on the Colonies,  
(when judged by ſuch a parliament for the  
beſt intereſt of the whole) would be more  
chearfully ſubmitted to, and more eaſily  
executed. |  
  
I ſhould hope too, that by ſuch an union,  
the people of Great Britain, and the people  
of the Colonies, would learn to conſider  
themſelves, not as belonging to different  
communities with different intereſts, but to

one community with one intereſt; which; !  
imagine, would contribute to ſtrengthen the  
whole, and greatly le l Jens the danger ef Hake  
  
ſeparations.  
  
It is, I ſuppoſe, agreed to be the general  
intereſt of any ſtate, that its people be nu-  
merous and rich; men-enow to fight in its  
defence, and enow to pay ſufficient taxes to  
defray the charge: for theſe circumſtances  
tend 5 the ſecurity of the ſtate, and its pro-  
tection from foreign powers: but it ſeems  
not of ſo much importance, whether the  
fighting be done by John or Thomas, or the  
tax paid by William or Charles. The iron  
manufacture employs and enriches the Bri-  
tiſh ſubjects; but is it of any importance to  
the ſtate, whether the manufacturers live at  
Birmingham, or Sheffield, or both, ſince they  
are ſtill within its bounds, and their wealth  
and perſons at its command ? Could the  
Goodwin ſands be laid dry by banks, and  
  
lands equal to a large country thereby  
gained to England, and preſently filled  
with Engliſh inhabitanfs ; would it be right  
to deprive ſuch inhabitants of the com-  
mon privileges enjoyed by other Englith-  
men, the right of vending their produce in  
the ſame ports, or of making their own  
ſhoes, becauſe a merchant or a ſhoemaker,  
living: in the old land, might fancy it mare  
or  
  
( 119 )  
  
for his advantage to trade, or to make ſhoes  
for them ? Would this be right, even if the  
  
  
and would it not ſeem leſs right, if the  
charge and labour of gaining the additional  
territory to Britain, had been borne by the  
ſettlers themſelves? And would not the  
hardſhip appear yet greater, if the people of  
the new country ſhould be allowed no repre-  
ſentatives in the parliament enacting ſuch  
impoſitions? Now I look on the Colonies  
as ſo many counties gained to Great Pritain,  
and more advantageous to it, than if the  
  
had been gained out of rhe fea, around its  
coaſts, and joined to its land: For being in  
different clunates, they afford greater variety  
of produce, and materials for more manu-  
factures; and being ſeparated by the ocean,  
they encreaſe much, more its ſhipping and  
ſeamen. And fince they are all included in  
the Britiſh empire, (which has only extended  
itſelf by their means, and the ſtrength and  
wealth of the parts, is the ſtrength and  
wealth of the Whole) what imports it to the  
general ſtate, whether a merchant, a ſmith,  
or a hatter, grow rich in Old or in New Eng-  
land? If through increaſe of pegple, two  
ſmiths are wanted, for one employed before,  
why may not the new ſmith be allowed to  
live and thrive in the new country, as well

to enact fome or all of them: it is not  
that I imagine fo many reprefentatives will  
be allowed the Colonies, as to have any  
great weight by their numbers; but I  
think there might be fufficient to occafion  
thofe laws to be better and more impar-  
tially confidered, and perhaps to overcome  
the intereft of a petty corporation, or of any  
pauticular fet of artificers or traders in  
England, who heretofore feem, in fome  
inftances, to have been more regarded than  
all the Colonies, or than was confiitent  
with the general intereft, or beft national  
good. I think too that the government of  
the Colonies, by a Parliament, in which  
they are fairly reprefented, would be vafily  
more agreeable to the people, than the  
method lately attempted to be introduced  
by royal inftruction, as well as more  
agreeable to the nature of an Englifh con-  
ftitution, and to Englith liberty ; and  
that fuch laws as now feem to bear hard  
on the Colonies would (when judged. by  
fuch a Parliament, for the beft intereft of  
the whole) be more chearfully fubmitted  
to, and more eafily executed.  
  
I fhould hope too, that, by fuch an  
union, the people of Great Britain, and  
the people of the Colonies, would learn  
to confider themfelves, as not belonging  
to different communities with different in-  
terefts, but to one community with one in-  
tereft ; which I imagine would contribute  
to ftrengthen the whole, and greatly leffen  
the danger of future feparations.  
  
It is, I fuppofe, agreed to be the general  
interelt of any ftate, that its people be nu-  
merous and rich ; men enow to fizht in its  
defence, and enow to pay fufficient taxes to  
defray the charge ; for thele circumftances  
tend to the fecurity of the ftate, and its pro-  
teétion from foreign power. But it feems  
not of fo much importance whether the  
fighting be done by John or Thomas, or  
the tax paid by William or Charles. The  
iron manufaéture employs and inriches Bri-  
tith fubjeéts, but is it of any importance to  
the ftate whether the manufaéturer lives at  
Birmingham, or Sheffield, or both, fince  
they are Rill within its bounds, and their  
wealth and perfons ftill at its command ?  
Could the Goodwin fands be laid dry by  
banks, and land equal to a large country  
thereby gained to England, and prefently  
filled with Englith inhabitants, would it be  
right to deprive fuch inhabitants of the  
common privileges enjoyed by other Eng-  
lithmen, the right of vending their produce  
in the fame ports, or of making their own  
thoes, becaufe a merchant or a fhoe-maker,  
living on the old land, might fancy it more  
  
for his advantage to trade or make flioes  
for them? Would this be right, even if  
the land were gained at the expence of the  
ftate? And would it not feem lefs righ:, if  
the charge and labour of gaining tne addi-  
tional territory to Britain had been borne  
by the feulers themfelves ? And would not  
the hardfhips appear yet greater, if the peo-  
ple of the new country fhould be allowed  
no reprefentatives in Par&#x27;iament enaéting  
fach impofitions ; now I look on the Colo-  
nies as fo many countries gained to Great  
Britain, and more advantageous ta it, than  
if they had been gained out of the fea  
around our coalts, and joined to its land ;  
for, being in different climates, they afford  
greater variety of produce, and materials  
for more manufactures ; and being fepara-  
ted by the ocean they increafe much more  
its fhipping and feamen ; and fince they  
are all included in the Britifh empire, which  
has only extended itfelf by their means ;  
and the ftrength and wealth of the parts is  
the ftrength and wealth of the whole;  
what imports it to the general ftate, whe-  
ther a merchant, a fmith, or a hatter, grow  
rich in Old or New England? And if,  
through increafe of people, two fmiths are  
wanted for one employed before, why may  
not the new fmith be allowed to live and  
thrive in the new country, as well as the  
old one in the old ? In fine, why fhould the  
countenance of a ftate be partially afforded  
to its people, unlefs it be moft in favourjof  
thofe who have moft merit ? And, if there  
be any difference, thofe who have moft  
contributed to enlarge Britain&#x27;s empire and  
commerce, increafe her ftrength, her wealth,  
and the numbers of her people, at the rifque  
of their own lives and private fortunes in  
new and ftrange countries, methinks cught  
rather to expect fome preference, With  
the greatelt refpec&amp;t and efteem, I have the  
honour to be your Excellency’s molt obe-  
dient and humble fervant

SIR, Boſton, Dec. 22, 1754.  
Since the converſation your Excellency was  
pleaſed to honour me with, on the ſubject of unit-  
ing the Colonies more intimately with Great Bri-  
tain, by allowing them Repreſentatives in Parlia-  
ment, I have ſomething further. conſidered. that  
matter and am of opinion, that ſuch an union  
would  
  
F &amp; 1  
  
would; be yery acceptable to the Colonies, provided  
they had a reaſonable number of Repreſentatives.  
allowed them; and that all the old Acts of Parlia-  
ment, reſtraining the trade or eramping the manu-  
factures of the Colonies, be at the ſame time re-  
pealed, and the Britiſh Subjects on this ſide the water  
put, ia thoſe reſpęcts, on the ſame footing with thoſe.  
in Great Britain, till the new Parliament, repre-  
ſenting the whole; ſhall think ir for the intereſt-of  
the whole to re · enact ſome or all of them: It is.  
not that I imagine ſo many Repreſentatives: will be  
allowed the Colonies, as to have any great weight  
by their numbers ; but I think there might be ſuf-  
ficient to occaſion thoſe laws to be better and more  
impartially conſidered, and perhaps to overcome.  
the private intereſt of a petty corporation, or of  
any particular ſer of artificers-or traders in Eng-  
land, who heretofore ſeem, in ſome inſtances, to  
have been more regarded than all the Colonies, or  
than was conſiſtent with the general intereſt, or  
beſt national good, I think too, that the govern-  
ment of the Colonies by a Parliament, in which  
they are fairly repreſented, would be vaſtly more  
agreeable ro the people, than the method lately  
attempted to be introduced by Royal Inſtructions,  
as well as more agreeable to the nature of an Eng-  
liſh Conſtitution, and to Engliſh : Liberty; and  
that ſuch laws as now ſeem to bear hard on the  
Colonies, - would (when judged by ſuch a Parlia-  
ment for the beſt intereſt of the whole) be more  
unn ſubmitted to, and more eaſily executed.

people of Great Britain and the people of the Co-  
lJonies would learn to conſider themſelves, not as  
belonging to different Communities &#x27;with different  
intereſts, but to one Community with one intereſt, -

the whole, and greatly leſſen the N .

and rich; men enow to fight in its defence, and  
enow to pay ſufficient taxes to defray the charge ;  
for theſe circumſtances tend to the ſeeurity of the  
ſtate, and its protection from foreign power: But  
it ſeems not of ſo much importance whether the  
fighting be done by John or Thomas, or the tax  
paid by William or Charles: The iron manufac-  
  
  
is it of any importance to the ſtate, whether the  
manufacturers live at Birmingham or Sheffield, or  
both, ſince they are ſtill within its bounds, and  
their wealth and perſons at its command? Could  
the Goodwin Sands be laid dry by banks, and land  
equal to a large country thereby gained to England,  
and preſently filled with Engliſn inhabitants, would  
it be right to deprive ſuch inhabitants of the com-  
mon privileges enjoyed by other Engliſnmen, the  
right of vending their produce in the fame ports,  
or of making their o ſhoes, becauſe a merchant,  
or a ſhoemaker, living on the old land, might

ſhoes ſor them? Would this be tight, even if the  
land were gained at che expence of the ſtate ? And  
would it not ſeem leſs right, if the charge and la-  
baur of gaining the additional territory to Britain  
had been borne by the ſettlers themſelves? And  
would not the hardſhip appear yet greater, if the  
people of the new country ſhould be allowed no  
Repreſentatives in the Parliament enafting ſuch  
impofitions? Now I look on the Colonies as fo  
many counties gained to Great Britain, and more  
advantageous to it than if they had been gained  
out of the ſea around its coaſts, and joined to its  
land: For, being in different climates, they af-  
ford greater variety of produce, and materials for  
more manufactures; and being ſeparated by the  
ocean, they increaſe much more its ſhipping and  
ſeamen; and ſince they are all included in the Britiſh

imports it to the general ſtate, whether a mer-  
chant, a ſmith, or a hatter, grow rich in Old or

31 R, Boſton, Dec. 22, 1784.  
Since the converſation your Excellency was  
pleaſed to honour me with, on the ſubject of unit-  
ing the Colonies more intimately with Great Bri  
tain, by allowing them Repreſentatives in Parlia«  
ment, I have ſomething further conſidered that  
  
matter, and am of opinion, that ſuch gn vnien  
  
would  
  
CY: 1  
  
would be very acceptable to the Colonies, provided  
they had a reaſonable number of Repreſentatives  
allowed them; and that all the old Acts of Parlia*  
ment, reſtraining the trade or cramping the manu»  
factures of the Colonies, be at the ſame time re-  
pealed, and the Britiſh Subjects on this ſide the water  
put, in thoſe reſpects, on the ſame footing with thoſe  
in Great Britain, till the new Parliament, repre-  
ſenting the whole, ſhall think it for the intereſt of  
the whole to re-ena&amp; ſome or all of them: It is  
not. that I imagine ſo many Repreſentatives will be  
  
allowed the Colonies, as to have any great weight.  
by their numbers; but I think there might be ſut-  
ficient to occaſion thoſe laws to be better and more  
impartially conſidered, and perhaps to overcome  
the private intereſt of a petty corporation, or of  
any particular ſet of artificers or traders in Eng-  
land, who heretofore ſeem, in ſome inſtances, to  
have been more regarded than all the Colonies, or  
than was conſiſtent with the general intereſt, or  
  
| beſt national good, I think too, that the govern-  
ment of the Colonies by a Parliament, in which  
they are fairly repreſented, would be vaſtly more  
agreeable to the people, than the method lately  
attempted to be introduced by Royal Inſtructions,  
as well as more agreeable to the nature of an Eng-  
liſh Conſtitution, and to Engliſh Liberty; and  
that ſuch laws as now ſeem to bear hard on the  
Colonies, would (when judged by ſuch a Parlia-  
  
ment for the beſt intereſt of the whole) be more  
  
cheartully ſubmitted to, and more ealily executed,  
M2 af ſhould  
  
[4]  
  
I ſhould hope tas; that by ſuch an union, the  
people of Great Britain and the people of the Co-  
lonies would learn to conſider themſelves, not as  
belonging to different Communities with different  
intereſts, but to one Community with one intereſt,  
which I imagine would contribute to ſtrengthen  
the whole, and greatly leflen the anger of future  
ſeparations.  
  
It is, I ſuppoſe, agreed to be the general in-  
tereſt of any ſtate, that its people be numerous  
and rich z men enow to fight in its defence, and  
enow to pay ſufficient taxes to defray the charge 1  
for theſe circumſtances tend to the ſecurity of the  
Kate, and its protection from foreign power : But  
it feemg not of ſo much impartance whether the  
Sghting be done by John or Themas, or the tax  
paid by William or Charles: The iron manufac+  
ture employs angl enriches the Britiſh SubjeRs, but  
uu it of any importance to the ſtate, whether the  
manufacturers live at Birmingham or SheMeld, or  
both, ſince they are ill within its bounds, and  
their wealth and perſons at its command? Could  
the Goodwin Sande be laid dry by banks, and land  
equal to a large country thereby gained io England,  
and preſently filled with Engliſh inhabitants, would  
it be right to deprive ſuck inhabitants of the com-  
mon privileges enjoyed by ogher Engliſhmen, the  
right of yending their produce in the ſume ports,  
pr of making their own ſhoes, becauſe a merchaot,  
or a ſhoemaker, living on the old land, mighs  
fancy it mere for bis advantage to trade of =  
  
&quot;  
  
[ 8s }  
  
_ ſhoes for them? Would this be right, even iß the  
land were gained at the expence of the Kate? And  
would it not ſeem leſs right, if the charge and la-  
bour of gaining the additional territory to Britain  
had been borne by the ſettlers themſelves? And  
would not the hardſhip appear yet greater, if the  
people of the new country ſhould be allowed ng  
Repreſentatives in the Parliament enaQing ſuch  
 jmpoſitions? Now I look on the Colonies as fo  
many counties gained to Great Britain, and more  
advantageous to it than if they had been gained  
out of the ſea around its coaſts, and joined to its  
land: For, being in different climates, they af+  
ford greater variety of produce, and materials for  
more manufactures; and being ſeparated by the  
ocean, they increaſe much more its ſhipping and  
ſeameny and ſince they are all included in the Britiſh  
Empire, which has only extended itſelf by their  
means z and the ſtrength and wealth of the parts  
is the ſtrength and wealth of the Whole what  
imports it to the general ſtate, whether a mer -  
chant, a ſmith, or à hatter, grow rich in Od or  
| New England? And If, through increaſe of  
people, two ſmiths arg wanted for one employed  
before, why may not the new ſmith be allowed to  
live and thrive in the New Country, as well as the  
od one in the Old In fine, why ſhould the coun ·  
tenance of a ſtate be partially afforded to its  
people, unleſs it be moſt in favour of thoſe, wha  
have moſt merit? and if there be any difference,  
thoſe who have moſt contributed to enlarge Bri-

ES 1  
  
tain&#x27;s empire and commerce, to increaſ® hey  
ſtrength, her wealth, and the numbers of her peo -

tunes, in new and ſtrange countries, methinks,  
ought rather to expect ſome preference,
