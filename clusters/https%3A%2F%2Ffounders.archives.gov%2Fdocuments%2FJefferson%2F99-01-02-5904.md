The offer of your service, in support of the rights of your country, merits and meets the highest praise: and  
whenever the moment arrives in which these rights must appeal to the public arm for support, the spirit from which your  
offer flows, that which animates our nation, will be their sufficient safeguard.  
To the legislature will be rendered a faithful account of the events which have so justly excited the  
sensibilities of our country, of the measures taken to obtain reparation, &amp; of their result: and to their wisdom will  
belong the course to be ultimately pursued.  
In the mean time it is our duty to pursue that prescribed by the existing laws: towards which, should your  
services be requisite, this offer of them will be remembered.  
I tender, for your Country, the thanks you so justly deserve.

protect the country, it’s citizens and property from violence. towards this your services are accepted under his  
direction.
