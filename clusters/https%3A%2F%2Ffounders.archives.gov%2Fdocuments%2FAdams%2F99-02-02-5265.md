 Jonathan Dickensen Sargent and Dr. Hutchinson, two old revolutionary Americans, extremely popular, put themselves at the head of the mob. Washington’s house was surrounded by an innumerable multitude, from day to day, huzzaing, demanding war against England, cursing Washington, and crying success to the French patriots and virtuous republicans. Frederic A. Muhlenburg, the speaker of the house of representatives, toasted publicly,—“The Mountain, may it be a pyramid that shall reach the skies,” J. Q. Adams’ writings first turned this tide; and, the yellow fever completed the salvation of Washington. Sargeant and Hutchinson died of it. I was assured soon after by some of the most sensible, substantial, and intelligent of the Quakers, that nothing but the yellow fever saved Washington from being dragged out of his house, or being compelled to declare war against England.

kering and Washington, that the latter not only felt his present obligations, but remembered the past. I will give you one proof, selected from many, in a letter from him to me, in these words, the original of which, all in his own hand writing, is now before me.  
Dear Sir, Monday, Feb. 20th 1797.  
I thank you for giving me the perusal of the enclosed. The sentiments do honor to the head and heart of the writer;—and if my wishes would be of any avail, they should go to you in a strong hope, that you will not withhold merited promotion from Mr. John Q. Adams, because he is your son.—For without intending to compliment the father or the mother, or to censure any others, I give it as my decided opinion, that Mr. Adams is the most valuable public character we have abroad;—And, that there remains no doubt in my mind, that he will prove himself to be the ablest of all our diplomatic corps. If he was now to be brought into that line, or into any other public walk, I could not, upon the principle which has regulated my own conduct, disapprove of the caution, which is hinted at in the letter. But he is already entered;—the public, more and more, as he is known, are appreciating his talents and worth;—and his country would sustain a loss, if these were to be checked by over delicacy on your part. With sincere esteem and affectionate regard, / I am ever yours,  
GEO. WASHINGTON.  
Vice-President.  
Please to recollect who were our ambassadors abroad, at the date of that letter. The presses, in this country, are under party licences. Many pieces in honor of Mr. J. Q. Adams have been refused admittance into all the federal papers, as I have been informed.

He was so devoted an Idolater of Hamilton, that he could not judge impartially of the sentiments and opinions of the President of the U. States. Look into Hamilton’s Pamphlet. Observe the pretended information of things which could have only passed between me and my cabinet. False and abusive as they were, where could he pretend to have derived them?

Desr Sir—I thank you forgiving me  
the perusal of the enclosed. The sen­  
timents do honor to the head and heart  
of the writer, and if my wishes would be  
any avail they shall go to you in a strong  
hope, that you will not withhold merit­  
ed promotion from Mr. John Quincy  
Adams, because he is your son. For,  
without intending to compliment the  
father or mother, or to censure any oth­  
ers, I give it as my decided opinion, that  
Mr. Adams is the most valuable public  
character that we have abroad j and that  
there remains no doubt in toy mind, that  
he will prove himself the ablest of all  
our diplomatic corps. If he was now to  
be brought into that line or into any other  
public walk* I could not, upon the prin­  
  
ciples which have regulated rny own  
conduct, disapprove of the caution which  
is hinted at in the letter. Hut he is al­  
ready entered.—The public more and  
more, as he is known, are appreciating  
his talents and worth; and his country  
would sustain a loss, if these were to be  
cheeked by over delicacy on your part.  
With sincere esteem and affectionate re­

of Commerce with Prussia. He remained in that  
country till the spring of 1801, when he was re-~  
called by his father and returned to America.

will be seen that it was considered by the father a delicate matter,

letter spoken of reads thus:  
  
“Dear Sir: I thank you for giving me a perusal of the enclosed.
