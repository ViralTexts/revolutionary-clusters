At a meeting of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston, duly &amp; legally warned &amp; convened, by adjournment at Faneuil Hall on Monday the thirteenth day of July, One thousand Seven hundred &amp; ninety five.  
A Pamphlet printed at Philadelphia under the signature of Stevens Thomson Mason, one of the Senators of the United States from the Commonwealth of Virginia, &amp; purporting to be a genuine Copy of a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, &amp; Navigation, entered into at London on the nineteenth day of November last between Lord Grenville, on the part of his Britanick Majesty, and John Jay Esquire, on the part of the United States, was read, and duly considered, and thereupon it was,  
Resolved, as the sense of the Inhabitants of this Town, that the aforesaid Instrument, if ratified, will be highly injurious to the commercial Interest of the United States, derogatory to their National honor, and Independence, and may be dangerous to the Peace and happiness of their Citizens.  
The reasons which have induced this opinion are as follow, vizt  
  
  
1st  
Because this Compact professes to have no reference to the merits of the complaints, &amp; pretensions of the contracting parties; but in reality the complaints &amp; pretensions of Great Britain, are fully provided for, while a part only, of those of the United States, have been brought into consideration.  
  
  
2d  
Because in the stipulation which restores our posts on the Western Frontier, no provision is made to indemnify the United States for the commercial, &amp; other losses they have sustained, &amp; the heavy expences to which they have been subjected in consequence of being kept out of possession for twelve years, in direct violation of the Treaty of Peace.  
  
  
3dly  
Because no indemnification is proposed to be made to the Citizens of the United States, for property taken from them at the close of the war, the restitution of which is provided for in the same Treaty.  
  
  
4th  
Because the capture of Vessells, &amp; property of Citizens of the United States, during the present war, made  
  
under the authority of the Government of Great Britain, is a National Concern, and claims arising from such captures, ought not to have been submitted to the decision of their Admiralty Courts, as the United States are thereby precluded from having a voice in the final determination of such cases; because the indemnification proposed, is to be sought by a process tedious &amp; expensive, in which justice may be delayed to an unreasonable time, &amp; eventually lost to many of the sufferers from their inability to pursue it; and because this mode of Indemnification bears no proportion to the summary method adopted for the satisfaction of British Claims.  
  
  
5th  
Because this compact, admits British subjects to an equal participation with our own citizens, of the interior Trafic of the United States with the neighbouring Indians, through our whole territorial dominions: while the advantages ostensibly reciprocated to our Citizens, are limited both in their nature and extent.  
  
  
6th  
Because the alien duties upon merchandise imported into the United States by British Subjects in their own bottoms, is, if not wholly suspended, at least contracted, not to be encreased.  
  
  
7th  
Because the commerce the United States have hithertoo enjoyed in India, in common with other Nations, is so restricted, that in future it will be of little or no substantial benefit to our Citizens.  
  
  
8th  
Because in every stipulation respecting our intercourse with the Colonial possessions of Great Britain, the whole commerce of the United States, in such intercourse, is Colonized in return.  
  
  
9th  
Because the clause by which the British Government reserves to itself the right of imposing on American Vessels, entering British Ports in Europe, a duty which shall countervail the difference of the duty payable on the importation of European &amp; Asiatic goods into the United States, in British or American bottoms, places it in the power of that government to enable British subjects, to become the Importers of Asiatic &amp; European goods, into the United States to the exclusion of our own citizens.  
  
  
10th  
Because although the terms of said Treaty, purport to be reciprocal in many instances, yet from the local situation,  
  
and existing circumstances of the United States, and the pacific system of policy they have adopted, that reciprocity is merely nominal, and delusive.  
  
  
11th  
Because it prevents the United States from imposing any further restrictions, on the British Trade alone, &amp; because it is stipulated, that neither the debts due from Individuals of the one Nation, to Individuals of the other, nor shares, nor monies which they may have in the Public Funds, or in any public or private banks, shall ever in any event of war, or National difference be sequestered, or confiscated—it is far from being impossible that the exercise of this right may in the opinion of the Legislature of the United States, contribute to preserve the peace of our Country, and protect the rights &amp; property of the Citizens from violation—we therefore esteem it highly impolitic, that the public faith should be pledged, that it shall never be exercised under any circumstances whatever.  
  
  
12th  
Because it concedes a right to the British Government to search &amp; detain our vessells in time of war, between them, &amp; other Nations, under frivolous, &amp; vexatious pretexts.  
  
  
13th  
Because it provides, that Ship timber, tar, hemp, sails, and copper, shall be considered contraband of war, which articles are expressly stipulated to be free, by the Treaties already subsisting, between the United States, &amp; all other Nations with whom they are in compact.  
  
  
14th  
Because it surrenders all, or most of the benefits of a commercial nature, which we had a right to expect, from our Neutrality in the present European War.  
  
  
15th  
Because it precludes the hope of receiving any advantage from the modern Law of Nations, referred to in the President’s proclamation of Neutrality, adopted by most of the Nations of Europe in the last War, and to which we then acceeded, and have since secured in our Treaties with all other Nations.  
  
  
16th  
Because it not only surrenders the right of carrying the property of any Nation at war with Great Britain, in our vessells freely; but abandons all pretensions even to the freight.  
  
  
17th  
Because it permits the British Nation to convert provisions, destined to other Nations at war with them, to their own use, on payment of what they may deem a  
  
reasonable profit; a measure not only injurious to the Interests of the American Merchant, but which will prevent our citizens from carrying American productions to other Countries, which by the Laws of Nature, and Nations they have a right to do without molestation.  
  
  
18th  
Because it limits the powers of Congress, delegated to them by the Constitution, “to regulate our Commerce with foreign nations” by prescribing Conditions, &amp; creating impediments to the exercise of that power.  
  
  
19th  
Because it exposes the United States, and their Commerce to similar embarrassments from other commercial Nations, all of whom will probably regulate our trade, by this partial standard.  
  
  
And lastly,  
Because, in the opinion of the Inhabitants of this Town, the nature &amp; extent of the exports of the United States, are such, that in all their stipulations, with foreign nations, they have it in their power, to secure a perfect reciprocity of intercourse, not only with the home dominions of such nations, but with all their Colonial dependences.  
It is further Resolved, that a Copy of the foregoing proceedings, attested by the Town Clerk, be immediately transmitted to the President of the United States, that they may be respectfully submitted to his consideration—And we earnestly hope, and confidently rely, that his prudence, fortitude, and wisdom, which have more than once been eminently instrumental, in the Salvation of his Country, will be equally conspicuous on the present occasion, and that the reasons we have assigned, will have their influence to induce him to withold his signature from the ratification of this alarming Instrument.

At a Mecting of the Inhabitants of the Town of  
Boston, duly and legally warned and convened  
by adjournment at Fanuil-Hall, on Monday the  
13th day of Fuly, A. D. 1795.  
A pamphlet printed at Philadelphia under the  
signature of S. T. Mason, Efg. one of the  
Senators of the United States from the Com­  
monwealth of Virginia, and purporting to be a  
genuine copy of a Treatyof Amity, Commerce  
and Navigation, entered into at London, on  
the 19th day of November last, between - Lord  
GRENVILLE, on the part of his Britannic  
Majesty, and Jou~ Jay, Esq. on the part of  
the United States—wasread and duly considered,  
and thereupon 1t was.  
Resolved, As the sense of the inhabitants of  
this town, that the aforefaid instrument if  
ratified, will be highly injurious to the commer­  
cial interests of the United States, derogatory to  
their national-honor and independence, and may  
be dangerous to the peace and happinels of  
their citizens.  
&#x27; The reasons which have induced this opinion  
are as follows, viz.  
Ifily. Because, this compaét profefles to  
have no reference to the merits of the complaints  
and pretensions of the contrating parties, but  
in reality the complaints and pretensions of  
Great Britain are fully provided for, while a  
part only of those of the United States have  
been brought into consideration,  
edly. Because, in the fhpulation, which re­  
stores our Posts on the Weltern Frontiers, no  
provision is made to indemnify the United  
States for the commercial and other lofles they  
have fuftained,and the heavy expences to which  
they have been fubjeéted in consequence of be­  
ing kept out of polleflion for twelve years, in  
direst violation of the Treaty of Peace.  
3dly. Because, no indemnification is pro­  
posed to be made to the citizens of the United  
States for property taken from them at the  
close of the war, the restitution for which is  
provided for in the fame Treaty.  
4thly. Because the capture of veflels and  
property of citizens of the United States during  
the present war made under the authority of  
the Government of Great Britain is a national  
concern, and claims arising frem f{uch captures  
ought not to have been {ubmitted to the deci­  
sion of their Admiralty Courts, as the United  
States are thereby precluded from having a  
voice in the final determination of {fuch cases ;  
because, the indemnification proposed is to be  
fought by a procels tedious and expensive, in  
which juflice may be delayed to an unrealonable  
time and eventually /o/t to many of the [uffer­  
ers, from their inability to pursue it ; and be­  
cause, this mode of indemnification bears no  
proportion to the /summary method adopted for  
the fatisfattion of British claims.  
sthly. Because this compaét admits Britith  
{ubjetls to an equal participation with our own  
citizens, of the interior trafic of the United  
States with the neighboring Indians, through  
our whole territorial domnions ; while the  
advantages ostensibly reciprocated to our citi-1  
zens, are limited both in their nature and ex­  
tent. &#x27;  
6thly. Because the alien duties upon mer­  
chandize imported into the United States by  
Britith fubjefls in their own bottoms is if not  
wholly fulpended, at leaff contrafled, not to  
be encreafed. :  
7thly. Because the Commerce the United  
States have hitherto enjoyed in India, iz com­  
mon with other mnations is so reftrifted, thatin  
future it will be of little or no substantial bene­  
fit to our ciuzens. ; |  
Bthly. Because in every flipulation respec­  
ting our intercourse with the Colonial pofieflions  
of Great Britain, the whole Commerce of the  
United States&#x27;in {uch intercourse, is colonized  
in return. : S  
gthly. Because the clause by which the  
British Government reserves to itfelf the right  
of imposing on American veflels entering Brit­  
ith ports in Europe, aduty which shall counter­  
vail the difference of the duty payable on the  
importation ot European and Adfiatic goods in­  
to the Unsted States, in British or Amenican  
bottoms, places it in the power of that Gov­  
ernment to enable British f{ubjefls to become  
the importers of Asiatic and European goods  
into the United States to the exclusion of our  
oWn citizens, : :  
“lothly. Because, altho’ the terms of said  
Treaty purport to be reciprocal in many instan­  
ces, yet from the local situation and existing  
circumflances of the United States, and. the pa­  
cific {yftem of policy they have adopted, that  
reciprocity is merely nominal and delusive.  
“11thly. Becaufeit prevents the United States  
from impolfing any further reftriftions on the  
British trade alone, and because it stipulates  
that neither the debts due from individuals of  
the one nation to individuals of the other, nor  
shares nor monies which they may have in the  
  
public funds,.or in any public or private Bank,  
{hall ever 1n any event of war or national differ.  
ence,be sequestered or confifcated. It is far from  
beingimpoffible that the exercise of this rightmay  
in the opinion of the legiftature of the United States  
contribute to preserve the peace of our country,  
and protett the nghts and property of the citi­  
zens from violation, we therefore efleem it  
highly impolitic that the public faith should be  
pledged that :7 shall ncver be exercised under  
any circumitances whatever. ;  
lethly. Because it concedes a right to the  
Britith Government to search and ‘detain ouy  
veflels in time of war between them and other  
nations, under frivolous and vexatious pretexts.  
13thly. Because it provides that ship-tim­  
ber, tar, hemp, fails and copper, {hall be con­  
sidered contraband of war, which articles are  
exprelsly stipulated to be free by the treaties al­  
ready fubfilting between the United States and  
all other nations, with whom they -are in com­  
patt. :  
14thly. Because it surrenders all or moll of  
the benefits of a commercial nature which we  
had a right to expe&amp;t from our neutrality in the  
present European war,  
15thly. Because it precludes the hope of  
receivingany advantage from the modern law of  
nations, refered to in the President’s Proclama­  
tion of Neutrality, adopted by most of the na­  
tions of Europe inthe last war, and to which  
we then acceded, and have since secured in dur  
treattes with all other nations,  
16thly. Because it not only surrenders the  
right of carrying the property of any nation at  
war with Great Britain in our vellels freely s  
but abandons all pretensions even to the frcig:ht,  
17thly. Because it permits the British nation  
to convert provisions, deflined to other nations  
at war with them, to their own use, on payment  
of what they may deem a reasonable profit; a  
mealure not only injurious to the interests of  
the American merchants, but which will pre­  
vent our citizens from carrying American pro­  
duttions to other countries, which by the Faws  
of nature and nations they have a right to do  
without molestation.  
18thly. Because it limits the power of  
Congrels delegated to them by the Conflitution,  
‘“ to regulate our Cgmmerce with foreign na­  
tions,” by prescribing conditions and creating  
impediments to the cxercife of that power.  
Igthly. Becauale it exposes the United States  
and therr commerce to similar embarrassments  
from other commercial nations, all of whom  
will probably regulate our trade by this partial  
standard.  
And lastly Because, in the opinion of the in­  
habitants of this town, the nature and extent of  
the exports of the United States are such, that  
in all their stipulations with foreign mnations,  
they have it in their power to secure a perfe@  
reciprocity of intercourse not only with the  
Home Dominions of {uch nations, but with all  
their Colonial Dependencies.  
1t zs further Refilved, That a copy of the  
foregoing proceedings, attested by the Town-  
Clerk, be immediately transmitted to the Presi­  
dent of the United States, that they may be re­  
fpe€tfully submitted to his consideration, And  
we earnestly hope, and confidently rely that his  
prudence, forutude, and wildom, which have  
more than once been eminently instrumental in  
the {alvation of his country, will be equally con­  
{picuous on the present occasion, and that the  
reasons we have assigned will have their influ­  
ence to withhold his signature from the ratifica­  
tion of this alarming instrument

The reafons, which have induced

ift. Becanfe &#x27;this compaft pro­  
feflcs to have no reference to themc­  
ntsof the complaints and pretenfions  
of die contrading partijs.; but in  
reality the complaints and prcten­  
Iioni of Great-Britain are fully pro­  
vided for, while a part only of  
thofe of the United States have been  
broight in to confideration.  
2idly. Becaule hi the Uipulatlon,  
whi:h. furrenders our polts to the  
weftem frontier, no provifion is  
made to indemnify the United States  
tor the commercial and other lofles  
tle have fuftained, and the heavy

to be made to the citizens of the  
United States for property taken  
from them at the cjofe of the war,  
the reltitution of which Is provided  
for in the fame treaty.  
4th!y. Bccaufe the capture ofvef­  
fels and property tf the citizens of  
the United States, made under the  
authority of the government of  
Oreat-Bntain, is a national concern  
and damn, arifing from fuch cap­

And becaufe the indemnification

re petting our intercourse with the  
colonial poffeffions of Great-Britain,  
the whole commerce of the United

!la countervail the diiFerence of the

of this town, tbat the Treaty, if ratified, ill  
be highly Injurious to the commeicial interests  
of the United States, derogatory to their Nati­  
onal Honour and Independence, and may be  
daagerous to the Peace and Happioefa of their  
Cttisens. -&quot; . ; .  
The resfohs which have induced tbjs opini-  
on are as folio, vis. ,  
I ft; Becaufe this compact profefTes to have  
no lefererite to the meiiti of the complaints  
and pietcntlons of the contracting parties&#x27; s

out id reality tne compiaims inu pmcuuuu ui  
  
Great Britain are fully provided tor, wniie a  
pait only of thofe of the United States hare been  
brought into confidcration.  
Hiy. Becaufe, in the ftipulatioh, which fur­  
renders our polls on the weltein frontiers,- no  
provifion is made to indemnify the United  
Slates for the commercial and other lofles they  
have fuitained, and the heavy eppencee to which  
they bave been ubjeded in coniequence of be­  
ii H kept out of polfcffion for twelve years in di­  
ttdV violation of the treaty of peace.  
jdly. Becauie, no indemnification is to be  
made to the citizens of the United States for  
property taken from them at theclofe of the  
war, tbereftitution of which is provided for in  
tbe fame treaty ; &#x27;  
4bly. Bccaufe, the capture of veffels and  
property of the citizens of the United States,  
made under the authority of t he government of  
Great Britain, is a national concern, and  
claims arifing from fuch captures ought not to  
have been lubmitted to the decifkn of their  
Admiralty Courts, as the United States are  
thereby precluded from has jng a voice :n the  
final determination of fuch cafes.  
  
And bccaufe the indemnification propofed  
to be made, is to be fought by a procefs, tedi­  
ous andopenGve, in which juliice may be de­  
layed to an unreasonable time j and eventual

.ubjefts to an equl participation with our own  
cititens of the interior traffic of the United  
States with the neighbouring Indians,&#x27; through  
our whole territorial dominions while the ad­  
vantages oftenfibly reciprocated to our cititens,  
re limited both in their nature and extent.  
6tbly. Becaufe, the alien duty upon mer­  
chandise imported into the United States by  
Britrfh lubjtcti in their on bottoms is, if not  
isbolly fufpended, at leaft contracted, not to  
be encreafed.  
7thly. Becaufe, the commerce we have hi.  
therto enjoyed in India, in common with other  
nations, is lo reltufted that in future it will be  
of little or no fubftantial benefit to ou( citizens.

Bntifti government rsiervce to itfelf the right  
Of impotii)g on American veirels, enuring Bri  
tifa potts in Europe, a duty which (hall coun  
teivail the difference of theduty payable on the  
importation ot European and Afiatic goods in­  
to the United Statea in Britifh or American

made by Mr. Mafcir, no such charge appears, nor  
in the motiois of Mr. Tazewell and Mr. Burr. It  
may, therefore, fairly be inferred, uptil the town  
or its committee pieafe to give some evidence to  
the contrary, that every complaint and pretention  
of the United States, was brought into considera­

The second reason is, beeaufe in the flipulatioh

It is presumed that a reference to the article in  
the treaty, Mr. J.&#x27;fFerfor.&#x27;s letet, and a consideration  
of the law of nations, as recognized by Europe and  
America, will convince all cpndid men, that the  
fourth lcafori of the town ought -*o have no weight  
against the treaty.  
  
The fifth teafon is &quot; because this compact admits  
Biitifii fubjefls to an equal partitipation with our

ly concluded between Lord Grenville and  
Mr. Jay.  
  
ESOLVED, as the ſenſe of the inhabitants of this town—  
  
That the aforeſaid inſtrument, if. ratified, will be highly inju-  
  
rious to the commercial intereſts of the United States, derogatory to  
  
their national honour and independence, and may be dangerous to  
ny ps and happineſs of their citizens.  
  
reaſons which have. induced this opinion are as follow, vis. -  
  
1. Becauſe this compact profeſſes to have no reference to the me-  
  
rits of the complaints and pretenſions of the contracting parties: but  
  
in reality the com _ and pretenſions of Great Britain are fully  
  
bene or, w A? bo of thoſe of the United States have  
  
brought into con tion,  
2. Becauſe, in the ſtipulation which ſurrenders our poſts on the  
weſtern frontier, no is made to indemnify the United States  
  
  
  
Vale tates, for property taken from ther bk : of the wat,  
the reſtitution of which is provided for in the lame treaty.  
4. Becauſe the capture of veſſels and property of the 22 =  
Pate States, made under the avthority of the goyefiitiient of Great  
ritain, is a national concern, and claims ariſing from ſuch captures  
ought not to have been ſubmitted to the deciſion of theit admiralty  
courts, as the United States are thereby precluded from having a  
voice in the final determination of ſuch cales | |  
  
And becauſe the indemnification propoſed t6 be _ is to be  
  
t by a proceſs, tedious and expenſive, in which juſtice be  
ele, an unreaſonable time; 2 eventually lo 05 any of th  
ſufferers, from their inability to purſue it ; — becauſe this mode 6  
indemnification bears no ion to the ſummary method ado  
for the 1 of Brink cans. * tee *  
  
5. e this compact admits Britiſh ſubjects to an e rtici- /  
— with our own citizens, of the intefior trafic 171 nited  
  
with the neighbouring Indians, through our whole territorial  
dominions ; while the advantages oſtenſibly reciprocated to our citi-  
zens, are limited both in their nature and extent.  
  
6. Becauſe the alien duty upon merchandiſe imported into the  
United States by Britiſh ſubjects, in their own bottoms, is, if bt  
Wholly ſufpended, at leaſt contracted, not to be increaſed.  
  
7. Becauſe the commerce we have hitherto erjoyed in India, in  
edmmon with other nations, is ſo reſtricted, that, in future, it will  
be of little or no ſubſtantial benefit to our citizens. 8  
8. Becauſe in ſtipulation refpetting our intercourfe with the  
edlonial poſſeſſions of Great Britain, the whole commtrce of the Uni-  
ted States, in ſuch intercourſe, is colonized in return.  
  
Becauſe the clauſe by which the Britiſh govefuent reſdives to  
| wel the right of impoſing on American veſſels, entering Britiſh ports  
  
in Europe, a duty which ſhall cquotervail the difference of the duty  
  
e on the importation of European and Aſiatic goods into  
  
ſnited States in Britiſh or Ametican bottoms, places it in the power  
| of that goretimient d enable Britiſh feige d 65 beeoine the imporicrs  
of Aſiatic and Europeari goods into the United States, to the exclu-  
fion of our own citizens. TT ag,  
  
10. Becauſe, although the terms of ſaid treaty purport to be re-  
ciprocal in many inſtances, yet, from the local ſituation, and 8  
circutaſtances of the United States, and the pacific ſyſtem.  
pole they have adopicd, the reciprocity is merely nominal and de-  
  
©, | | 1  
11. Becauſe it prevents the United States from impoſing any fur̃-  
cher reſtrictions on the Biitih trade s.  
  
  
And, becauſe it is ſtipulated that neither the debts due from indi-  
viduals of one nation to individuals of the other, nor ſhares nor mo-  
nies which they may have in the public funds, or in any public or  
  
ivate banks, ſhall ever in any event of war or national differences,  
  
ſequeſtered or confiſcated. —It is far from beivg impoſſible that  
nn opinion of the national legiſla-  
ture contribute to p the peace of our country, and protect the  
rights and property of the citizens from violation ; we therefore  
  
eem it highly impolitic that the public faith ſhould be pledged that  
it ſhall neyer be exerciſed under any circumſtances whatever.  
  
12. Becauſe it concedes a right to the Britiſh government to ſearch  
and detain our veſſels in time of war, under frivolous and vexatious  
  
= .  
  
13. Becauſe it that ſhip timber, tar, hemp, fails and  
copper, ſhall be conſidered contraband of war, which articles are  
expreſaly ſtipulated to be free by the treaties already ſubſiſting be-  
tween the United States and all other nations, with whom they are  
in compact. J  
14. Becauſe it ſurrenders all or moſt of the benefits of a commer-  
cial nature, which we had a right to expect from our neutrality in  
the preſent war.  
  
15. Becauſe it precludes the hope of receiving any advantage from  
the modern law of nations, referred to in the Prefident&#x27;s proclama-  
tion of neutrality ; adopted by moſt of the nations of Europe, in the  
laſt war, and which we then acceded to and have ſecured in our  
treaties with all other nations. :  
  
16. Becauſe it not on); ſurrenders the right of carrying the pro-  
  
of any nation at war with Great Britain, in our veſſels freely ;  
abandons all pretenſions even to the freight.  
  
17. Becauſe it permits the Britiſh nation to convert proviſions,  
deſtined to other nations at war with them, to their own uſe, on  
payment of what they may deem reaſonable profit—a meaſure, not  
  
injurious to the intereſt of the American merchant, but which  
will prevent our citizens from carrying thoſe ſupplies to other coun-  
tries, which, by the laws of nature and nations, they have a right to  
do, without moleſtation. .  
  
18. Becauſe it limits the power of Congreſs, delegated to them  
  
the conſtitution, © to regulate our commerce with foreign na-  
tions,” by preſcribing conditions, and creating impediments to the  
exerciſe of that power.“ |  
  
19. Becauſe it expoſes the United States and their commerce to  
Gmilar embarraſſments from other commercial nations, all of whom  
And _  
| Becauſe, —— of the inhabitants of this town, the nature  
and extent of the exports of the United States ate ſuch, that in all  
_ their ſtipulations with foreign nations, have it in their power to  
ſecure a perſect reciptocity of in e, not only with the home  
dominions of ſuch nations, . dependencies.  
  
  
V  
  
atteſted by the town-  
RN t of the United States,  
that they may be reſpectfully ſubmitted to his conſideration. Aod  
ve earneſtly hope, and — rely, that his prudence, fortitude.  
and wiſdom, which have more than once been eminently inſtrumen-  
tal in the ſalvation of his country, will be equally conſpicuous. on the  
preſent occaſion ; and that the reaſons we have aſſigned will hase  
their influence to induce him to withhold his ſignature from the rati-  
fication of this alarming inſtrument. -
