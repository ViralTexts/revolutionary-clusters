h as it is, Every one of them is convinced that the Constitution is good for Nothing; and unfortunately they are many of them so indiscreet as to disclose that Opinion, when at the same Time they declare their Determination to support and execute it, which is in Fact the only rational Mode (which now remains) of pointing out its Defects. It is unnecessary to tell you that some Members of the national Assembly are in the Pay of England for  
  
that you will easily suppose. Brissot de Warville is said to be one of them, and indeed (whether from corrupt or other Motives I know not) his Conduct tends to injure his own Country and benefit that of their antient foes in a very eminent Degree. The Situation of their Finances is such that every considerate Person sees the Impossibility of going on in the present Way; and as a Change of System after so many pompous Declamations is not a little Dangerous among a People so wild and ungoverned, it has appeared to them that a War would furnish some plausible Pretext for Measures of a very decisive Nature, in which State Necessity will be urged in the Teeth of Policy Humanity and Justice. Others consider a War as the Means of obtaining for the Government the eventual Command of disciplined military Force, which may be used to restore order, in other Words to bring back Despotism; and then they expect that the King will give the Nation a Constitution which they have neither the Wisdom to form nor the Virtue to adopt for themselves. Others again suppose that in Case of a War there will be such a leaning from the King towards his Brothers, from the Queen towards the Emperor, from the Nobility (the very few) who remain, towards the Mass of their Brethren who have left the Kingdom, that the bad Success naturally to arise from the opposition of undisciplined Mobs to regular Armies may be easily imputed to treasonable Counsels, and the People be prevailed on to banish them all together and set up a federal republic. Lastly the Aristocrats, burning with the Lust of Vengeance; Most of them poor, and all of them proud, hope that supported by foreign Armies they shall be able to return victorious &amp; reestablish that Species of Despotism most suited to their own Cupidity. It happens therefore that the whole nation tho with different Views are desirous of War, for it is proper in such general Statement to take in the Spirit of the Country which has ever been warlike. I

dated February 4, 1792. “ Every member of the Ministry,”  
he says, “is convinced that the Constitution is good for  
nothing, and, unfortunately, there are many of them so  
indiscreet as to disclose that opinion, when at the same  
time they declare their determination to support and exe-  
cute it, which is, in fact, the only rational mode (which now  
remains) of pointing out its defects. It is unnecessary to  
tell you that some members of the National Assembly are  
in the pay of England, for that you will easily suppose.  
Brissot de Warville is said to be one of them, and indeed  
(whether from corrupt or other motives I know not) his  
conduct tends to injure his own country and benefit that of  
their ancient foes in a very eminent degree. ‘The situation  
of their finances is such that every considerate person sees  
the impossibility of going on in the present way, and as a  
change of system after so many pompous declarations is  
not a little dangerous among people so wild and ungov-  
erned, it has appeared to them that a war would furnish  
some plausible pretext for measures of a very decisive na-  
ture, in which state necessity will be urged in the teeth of  
policy, humanity and justice. Others consider a war as  
a means of obtaining for the government the eventual com-  
mand of a disciplined military force, which may be used  
to restore order; in other words, to bring back despotism,  
and then they expect that the King will give the nation a  
constitution which they have neither the wisdom to form  
nor the virtue to adopt for themselves.  
  
“ Others, again, suppose that in case of a war there will  
be such a leaning from the King towards his brother, from  
the Queen towards the Emperor, from the nobility (the  
very few) who remain towards the mass of their brethren  
who have left the kingdom, that the bad success ultimately  
to arise from the opposition of undisciplined mobs to reg-  
ular armies may be easily imputed to treasonable counsels,  
and the people be prevailed on to banish them altogether  
and set up a Federal Republic. Lastly, the aristocrats,

burning with the lust of vengeance, most of them poor and  
all of them proud, hope that, supported by foreign armies,  
they shall be able to return victorious and re-establish that  
species of despotism most suited to their own cupidity. It  
happens, therefore, that the whole nation, though with dif-  
ferent views, are desirous of war; for it is proper, in such  
general statements, to take in the spirit of the country,  
which has ever been warlike.” *

Arcadian  
slang for ‘ getting married,’ as the phrase here goes.  
  
A curious word is ‘fenege,’ which I cannot help believing is  
Shakespeare’s ‘renege,’ for we are but little particular as to the  
sound of a letter orsoin Arcadia. To fenege, for your more sweet  
understanding, reader, is to give up doing something which has  
been promised; ‘he feneged to go’ means that he broke his  
engagement to go; and though Knight’s Shakspere tells us  
that to renege is to deny, there would be little difficulty, in the  
well-known passage in King Lear, in making the word mean  
exactly what fenege expresses with us:  
  
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
