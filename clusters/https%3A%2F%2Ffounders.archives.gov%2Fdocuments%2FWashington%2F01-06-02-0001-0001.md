Friday 8th. According to appointment, at 11 Oclock I set out for the City Hall in my Coach—preceeded by Colonel Humphreys and Majr. Jackson in Uniform (on my two White Horses) &amp; followed by Mesr. Lear &amp; Nelson in my Chariot &amp; Mr. Lewis on Horse back following them. In their rear was the Chief Justice of the United States &amp; Secretaries of the Treasury and War Departments in their respective Carriages and in the order they are named. At the outer door of the Hall I was met by the Doorkeepers of the Senate and House and conducted to the Door of the Senate Chamber; and passing from thence to the Chair through the Senate on the right, &amp; House of representatives on the left, I took my Seat. The Gentlemen who attended me followed &amp; took their stand behind the Senators; the whole rising as I entered. After being seated, at which time the members of both Houses also sat, I rose (as they also did) and made my Speech; delivering one Copy to the President of the Senate &amp; another to the Speaker of the House of Representatives—after which, and being a few moments seated, I retired, bowing on each side to the Assembly (who stood) as I passed, and dessending to the lower Hall attended as before, I returned with them to my House.  
In the Evening, a great number of Ladies, and many Gentlemen visited Mrs. Washington.  
On this occasion I was dressed in a suit of Clothes made at the Woolen Manufactury at Hartford as the Buttons also were.

City Hall in my coach, preceded by Colonel Humphreys and Majt Jackson  
in uniform, (on my two white horses) and followed by Messrs. Lear and  
Nelson, in my chariot, and M* Lewis, on horseback, following them. In

the order they are named. At the outer door of the hall I was met by  
the door-keepers of the Senate and House, and conducted to the door of the  
Senate Chamber; and passing from thence to the Chair through the Senate  
on the right, and House of Representatives on the left, I took my seat.  
The gentlemen who attended me followed and took their stand behind the  
Senators; the whole rising as Ientered. After being seated, at which time  
the members of both Houses also sat, I rose, (as they also did) and made  
my speech; delivering one copy to the President of the Senate, and another  
to the Speaker of the House of Representatives—after which, and being a  
few moments seated, I retired, bowing on each side to the assembly (who  
stood) as I passed, and descending to the lower hall, attended as before, I  
returned with them to my house. In the evening a great number of ladies,  
and many gentlemen visited M™ Washington. On this occasion I was  
dressed in a suit of clothes made at the Woolen Manufactory at Hartford,  
as the buttons also were.’’— Washington’s Diary.
