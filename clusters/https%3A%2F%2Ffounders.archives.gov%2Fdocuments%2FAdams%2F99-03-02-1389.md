Soul are a real blessing. they so often are wounded by the insensible, by the unfealing beings which surround them of which much the larger portion of Mankind are composed, that like the Rose of Cowper they are shaken by the rude Blast, or witherd by cold neglect, instead of having the tear of sorrow wiped away by the sympathizing hand of congenial tenderness. yet who that possesses them would be willing to exchange them for a cold hearted apathy, and a stoical indifference. A fine tuned instrument is soonest put out of order, yet what lover of Musick would wish to possess in preference, an ordinary, instrument?  
“Dearly bought, the hidden treasure  
Finer feelings can bestow;  
Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure  
Thrill the deepest notes of woe”  
I hope my dear Nancy that you will have a favorable time to Return to your Family and Friends—to whom present my kind Regards, as well as to my dear sister when you see her. I conclude this Letter with my wishes
