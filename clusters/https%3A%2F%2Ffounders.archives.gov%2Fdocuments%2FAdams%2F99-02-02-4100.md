Gentlemen of the Senate,  
					23 December, 1799.  
				  
				I receive, with the most respectful and affectionate sentiments, in this impressive address, the obliging expressions of your regard for the loss our country has sustained in the death of her most esteemed, beloved, and admired citizen.  
  
In the multitude of my thoughts and recollections on this melancholy event, you will permit me only to say, that I have seen him in the days of adversity, in some of the scenes of his deepest distress and most trying perplexities; I have also attended him in his highest elevation, and most prosperous felicity, with uniform admiration of his wisdom, moderation, and constancy.  
  
Among all our original associates in that memorable league of the continent in 1774, which first expressed the sovereign will of a free nation in America, he was the only one remaining in the general government.  
  
Although, with a constitution more enfeebled than his at an age when he thought it necessary to prepare for retirement, I feel myself alone, bereaved of my last brother, yet I derive a strong consolation from the unanimous disposition which appears, in all ages and classes, to mingle their sorrows with mine on this common calamity to the world.  
  
The life of our Washington cannot suffer by a comparison with those of other countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame. The attributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to eclipse the majesty of those virtues which made him, from being a modest citizen, a more resplendent luminary. Misfortune, had he lived, could hereafter have sullied his glory only with those superficial minds, who, believing that characters and actions are marked by success alone, rarely deserve to enjoy it. Malice could never blast his honor, and envy made him a singular exception to her universal rule. For himself, he had lived enough to life and to glory. For his fellow-citizens, if their prayers could have been answered, he would have been immortal. For me, his departure is at a most unfortunate moment. Trusting, however, in the wise and righteous dominion of Providence over the passions of men, and the results of their counsels and actions, as well as over their lives, nothing remains for me but humble resignation.  
  
His example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in future generations, as long as our history shall be read. If a Trajan found a Pliny, a Marcus Aurelius can never want biographers, eulogists, or historians.  
				  
					John Adams.

Among all our original affociates in that

T receive with refpeciful and affectionate  
fentiments, in this impreffive addrefs, the  
obliging expreffions of ea regret, for the  
lofs our country has fuftained, in the death  
of her mott eltcemed, beloved and admired  
citizen.  
  
In the multitude of my thoughts and  
recolleStions on this melancholy event,  
vou will permit me oniy to fay, that T  
have feen him in the days of adverfity,  
1m fome of the fcenes of his deepett diltrets,  
and moft trying perplexities: I have alfo  
attended him in his highett elevation and  
moft profperous felicity; with uniform  
admiration of his wiidom, moderation, and  
conftancy.  
  
Among all our original affociates in that  
memorable league of the continent in 1774,  
which firft exprefled the fovereign will of  
a free nat:on in America, he was the only  
one remaining in the general government.  
Although, with a conttitution more en-  
teebled than his at an age when he thought  
it neceflary to prerare for retirement, I  
fee] myfelf alone bereaved of my laft  
brother, yet I derive a ftrong consolation  
from the unanimous difpofition which ap-  
pears in all ages and ciaffes, to mingle  
their forrows with mine, on this common  
calamity to the world.  
  
‘The life of our Wafhington cannot fuf-  
fer by a compatiton with other countries,  
who have been moft celebrated and ex-  
alted by fame. The attributes, and deco-  
ration of royalty, could have only ferved  
to eclipfe the majefty of thofe virtues which  
made him, from being a modett citizen,  
a more refplendent Juminary. Misfor-  
tune, had he lived, could hereafter have  
fullied his giory only with thole fuperficial  
minds, who, believing that characters and  
actions are marked by fuccefs alone, rarely  
deferved to enjoy it. Malice could never  
have blafted his honour ;. and envy made  
him a fingular exception to her univerfil  
rule. Foi himéelf he had lived long enough,  
to life and to glory. For his fellow-citi-  
zens, if their prayes could have been an-  
fwered, he woul have beenimmoital. For  
ine, his departure ts at a moft unfortunate  
moment. Trufting, however, in the wife  
and righteous dominion of Providence over  
the pations of men, and refults of their  
councils and ations, as well as over  
their lives, nothing remains for me but  
bumble 1 fignation.

His example is now complete, and it  
will teach wifdom and virtue to magiltrates,  
citizens, and men, not only in the prefent  
age, but in future generations, as long  
as our hiftory fhall be read. Ifa Trajan  
found a Pliny, a Marcus Aurelius can  
never want biographers, eulogitts, or h.f-  
torians.

Answer of the President to the Condolence of  
the Senate.  
Gentlemen:—I receive with the most  
respectful and affectionate sentiments,  
in this impiessive address, the obliging  
expressions of your regret, for the loss  
our Country has sustained, iu the death  
other mo*t esteemed, beloved and ad­  
mired Citizen.  
In the multitude of my thoughts and  
recollections on this melancholy event,  
you will permit me only to say, that 1  
have seen him in the days of Adversity,  
in some of toe scenes oi his deepest dis­  
tress and most .Lying perplexities—1  
have also attended lum iu his highest  
• elevation and most prosperous felicity  
—with uniform admiration of his wisdom  
moderation and constancy­  
Among all our original associates in  
the Memorable League of the Continent  
in 1774 which first expressed the Sover­  
eign Will of a Free Nation in Jlmirica,  
he was the only one remaining in the  
General Government Although, with  
a constit ution more enfeebled than his,  
at an age when he thought it necessary  
to prepare for retirement, I feel myself  
alone, bereaved of my last brother—yet  
I derive a strong consolation from the  
unanimous disposition, which appears  
in all ages and classes to mingle their  
sorrow with mine, on this common ca­  
lamity to the world.  
The life of our WASHIGTON, can­  
not suffer by a comparison with those of  
other countries, who have been most  
celebrated and exalted by Fame. The  
attributes and decorations of Royalty,  
could have only served to eclipse the  
Majesty of those virtues which made  
him, from being a modest citizen a  
more resplendaut luminary. Misfor­  
tune, had he lived, could hereafter have  
sullied his glary only with those super­  
ficial minds, who, believing that char­  
acters and actions are marked uiith suc­  
cess alone, rarely deserves to enjoy it.  
Malice could never have blasted his ho­  
nor, and Envy made him a siugular ex­  
ception to her universal rule.  
For himself he. had lived enough, to  
life and to glory. For his fellow -citi­  
  
zens, it their prayers coma nave been­  
answered he would have been ia,mortal.  
For me, his departure is at a most un­  
fortunate moment. Trusting, however,  
in the wise and righteous dominion of  
Providence over the passions of men,  
and the results of their councils and ac­  
tions, as well as over their Lives, nothing  
remains for me but humble resignation.  
His example is now complete, and it  
will teach wisdom and virtue to Magis­  
trates, Citizens and Men. not only in the  
present age, but in future generations,  
as long as our History shall be read. If  
a Trojan found a P/tftjf, a Marcus *4u- &#x27;  
relius can never waut biographers, Eu­  
logists or Historians. JOHN ADAMS

having been  
  
A message  
Senate informing the House that they had  
agreed to the appointment of a joint committee,  
the House adjourned till Monday.  
The Address of the Senate to the President  
of the United States was some longer, making  
about fifty lines of a newspaper column. The  
President&#x27;s Answer was brief, and in words  
equally fitly spoken, as follows:  
Gentlemen of the Senate:  
I receive with the most respectful and affec­  
tionate sentiments, in this impressive address,  
the obliging expressions of your regret, for the  
loss our Country has sustained in the death of  
her most esteemed, beloved and admired Citi  
zen.  
In the multitude of my thoughts and recol  
lections, on this melancholy event, you will per­  
mit me only to say, that I have seen him in the  
days of Adversity, in some of the scenes of his  
deepest and most trying perplexities; I have  
also attended him in his highest elevation and  
most prosperous felicity; with uniform admira­  
tion of his wisdom, moderation and constancy  
Among all our original associates, in the  
memorable League of the Continent in 1774,  
which first expressed the sovereign will of a  
Free Nation in America, he was the only one  
remaining in the General Government. Al­  
though, with a constitution more enfeebled than  
that at an age when he thought it necessary to  
prepare for retirement, I feel myself alone, be­  
reaved of my last brother; yet I derive strong  
consolation from the Unanimous disposition,  
which appears in all ages and classes, to min  
gle their sorrows with mine, on this common  
calamity to the world.  
The life of our WAShinGTOn cannot suf­  
fer by a comparison with those of other coun­  
tries, who have been most celebrated and ex-  
or nyaffy,  
the Majesty of those virtues, which made him,  
from being a modest citizen, a more resplendent  
luminary. Misfortune, had he lived, could  
hereafter have sullied his glory only with those  
superficial minds, who, believing that character  
and actions are marked by success alone, rarely  
deserves to enjoy it. Malice could never blast  
his honor, and Envy made him a singular excep­  
tion to her universal rule. For himself he had  
lived enough, to life and to glory. For his fel­  
low citizens, if their prayers could have been  
answered he would have been immortal. For  
me his departure is at a most unfortunate mo­  
ment. Trusting, however, in the wise and  
righteous dominions of Providence over pas  
sions of men, and the result of their councils  
and actions, as well as over their Lives, nothing  
remains for me but HuMBle ReSIONATION.  
His example is now complete, and it will  
teach wisdom and virtue to Magistrates, Citi  
zens and Men, not only in the present age, but  
in future generations, as long as our History  
shall be read. If a Trajan found a Pliny, a  
Marcus Aurelius can never want Biographers,  
or Historians.

ake notice of its contents,  
which we now comply with. The  
most important gesx4er4d ia -the  
Gazette is the annou.eemnit to Con­  
gress of the death of Washington,  
which occtd -on th-14*,of DNith­  
ber, 1799. As everything relating to  
that early period in 44-history of our  
country is eagerly sought for at this  
time, and will prove interesting, we  
give President Adams&#x27; -reply to the  
Senate&#x27;s expression of deep regret for  
the loss sustained by the country in  
his death, together with a description  
of the last rites and ceremonies which  
attended his burial.  
PRESIDENT&#x27;S ANSWER..  
Gentlemen of the Snate:  
I-receive with the most respectful  
and affectionate sentiments, in this  
impressive address, the obliging ex­  
pressions of your regret, for the loss  
our Country has sustained in the death  
of her most esteenied, beloved and ad­  
mired Citizen.  
Ia the- multitude of my thoughts  
and recollections, on this melancholy  
event, you will permit me only to say,  
that I have seen him in the days of  
Adversity; in some of -the scenes of  
his deepest and most trying perplexi­  
ties.; I have:also attended him in his  
highest elevation and most prosperous  
felicity;- with uniform admiration of  
his wisdom, mnoderation and constancy.  
Aiong all- our original associates,  
in the memorable League of the Con­  
tinent in 1774, which first expressed  
the sovereign will of a Free Nation in  
AMERICA, lie was the only one remain­  
ingin the General Government. Al­  
thoughf with a constitutidn more en­  
feebled than-his, at an age when he  
though it necessary to prepare for re­  
tirement, I feel myself alone, bereaved  
of my last britherv; yet I derive  
straog coiiiolation from the Unanimous  
dispositin, which appears in all ages  
and classes, to mingle their sorrows  
with.mine, on this common calamity  
to the world.  
The life of our WASHINGTON  
cannot suffer by a comparison with  
those oft dther couatries, -who have  
been -st+celebrated and exalted by  
Fame. The attributes and decorations  
of Royalty,&#x27;.coiild&#x27;onTy have served to  
eclipsi the- majesty of those virtues,  
which 1ia&amp;eghim, from beiog a miodest  
citizen, a more resplendant luiminary.  
Misfortuner&#x27; had he lived, could here­  
after have sallied his glory only with  
those sup&#x27;efiial minds,,.who, behievng  
thai chairacter and actions are marked  
by&#x27;susccess alone, rarely deserves to  
enjoy it. .Malice could never blast  
his hAonor, and .Envy made him a sin­  
gular exception to her universal rule.  
- -For himself he had lived enough,  
to life and to glory. For his fellow  
eitizens, if their prayers could have  
bee~ -answered;, he would have been  
immortal. For me, his, departure is  
at ~a miost unfortunate moment. Trust­  
ing)3howevers in the wise and righteous  
dobiulons of Providence over the pas­  
sioiw~of men, and thie result of their  
cowdilis and actions, as well as over  
their [Lives,: nothing remains for me  
but EUMBLE RESIGNATION..  
His example is now complete, and  
it winl teach wisdom &#x27;and virtue to  
Magistrates, Citizens and men; not  
only in the&#x27;present age, but in future  
generations, as long .as our History  
shall be read. If a Trajan found a  
Jfliny,. a Marcus Aurelius can. never  
want Biographers, Eulogists -or His­  
torians.

one remaining in the General Government.  
Although with aconstitution more enfeebled

cessary to prepare for retirement, I feel my­  
self alone, bereaved of my last brother;  
yet I derive strong consolation from the

The life of our Washington cannot stiller

fortunate moment. Trusting, however, in

lence over the passions of men, and the re­

&gt;ver their Lives, nothing remains for me

1 receive with the most respectful  
and affectionate sentiments, in this j  
impressive address, the obliging c x­  
pression of your regret, for the loss!  
i»ur country has sustained in the loss  
of her most esteemed, beloved and  
admired citizen.  
In the multitude of my thoughts  
and recollections, on this melancholy  
event, you will permit me only to say,  
that 1 have seen him in the days of  
adversity, in some of the scenes of  
his deepest and most trying perplex­  
ities; 1 have also attended him in the  
highest elev ation and most prosper­  
ous felicity; with uniform admiration  
of lus wisdom, moderation and con­  
stancy  
Among all our original associates,  
in the memorable League of the Con­  
tinent in 1774, which first expressed  
the sovereign will of a Free Nation  
in America, he was the only one le­  
maining in the General Government.  
Although with a constitution more  
enfeebled than his, at an age when ho  
thought it necessary to prepare for  
retirement, 1 feel myself alone, be­  
reaved of my last brother; yet 1 de­

The life of our WASHINGTON  
cannot suffer by comparison with those  
of other couutres, who have been  
most celebrated and exalted by h ame.  
The attributes and decorations of  
Royalty, could only have served to  
eclipse the Majesty of those virtues,  
which made him, from being a mod­  
est citizen, a more resplendent lumi­  
nary. Misfortune, had ho lived,  
could hem-after have sullied his glory  
only with those superficial minds, who,  
believing that characters and actions  
are marked by success alone , rarely de­  
serve to enjoy it. Maine could never  
blast his honor, and Envy made him a  
singular exception to her universal  
rule. For himself he had lived enough  
to life ami glory. For his fellow citi­  
zens, if their prayers could have been  
answered, he would have been immor­  
tal. For me his departure is a most  
unfortunate moment. Trusting, how •  
ever, in the wise and righteous do­  
minions of Providence over passions  
of men, and the result of their coun­  
cils and actions, as well as over their  
lives, nothing remains for me but  
HL&#x27; M HUE RESIGNATION.  
His example is now complete, and  
it will teach wisdom and virtue to  
Magistrates, Citizens and men, not  
only in the present age, but in future  
generations, as long as our history  
shall he read. If a Trajan found a  
Pliny, a Marcus Arelius can never  
want Biographers, Eulogists or His­  
torians. JOHN ADAMS

I received with the most respect­  
ful and affectionate sentiments in  
this impressive address, the obliging  
expression of your regret for the loss  
our Country has sustained in the  
death of her most esteemed, belov

In the multitude of my thoughts  
and recollections on this melancholy  
event, you will permit me only to  
say, that I have seen him in the  
days of Adversity, in some of the  
scenes of his deepest and most try-  
ing perplexities. I have also at  
tended him in his highest elevation  
and most prosperous felicity, with  
uniform admiration of his wisdom,  
moderation and constancy. Among  
all our original associates in the  
memorable Leauge of the Continent  
in 1774, which first expressed the  
sovereign will of a Free Nation in  
AmeriCa, he was the only one re  
maining in the General Govern  
ment. Although with a constitu­  
tion more enfeebled than his, at an  
age when he thought it necessary to  
prepare for retirement, I feel myself  
alone bereaved of my last brother;  
yet I derive strong consolation from  
the unanimous disposition which  
appears in all ages and classes, to  
mingle their sorrows with mine, on  
this common calamity to the world.  
The life of our Washington cannot  
suffer by a comparison with those  
of other countries who have been  
most celebrated and exalted by  
Fame. The attributes and decora­  
tions of Royalty could only have  
served to eclipse the majesty of those  
virtues, which made him from being

luminary. Misfortune, hereafter,  
had he lived, could have sul­

superficial minds who, believing  
that character and actions are mare­

wise and righteous dominion of  
Providence over passions of mon,  
and the result of their councils and

nothing remains for me but humele

afflicted people.’” After continuing in this strain for a  
time, resolutions were offered, the third one reading:  
“Resolved, That a committee, in conjunction with one  
from the Senate, be appointed to consider on the most  
suitable manner of paying honor to the memory of the man  
first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his  
country.”  
  
The addresses of condolence from both Houses to the  
President are given, with his responses. Adams said that  
he felt himself “alone, bereaved of my last{ brother,” for  
“among all our original associates in the memorable  
League of the Continent in 1774, which first expressed the  
sovereign will of a Free Nation in America, he was the only  
one remaining in the General Government.”

ceived with the most respectful and af­  
fectionate sentiments, in this impres­  
sive address, the obliging expressions  
of your regret, for the loss our country  
has sustained in the death of her most  
esteemed, beloved and admired cit­  
zen. In the multitude of my thoughts  
and recollections on this melancholy  
event, you will permit me only to say  
that I have seen him in the days of  
adversity, in some of the scenes of hi  
deepest and most trying perplexities: I  
have also attended him in the highest  
elevation and the most prosperous fe­  
licity; with uniform admiration of his  
wisdom, moderation and constancy.  
&quot;Among all our original associates  
in this memorable League of the Con­  
tinent, in 1774, which first expressed  
the sovereign will of a free nation in  
America, he was the only one remain­  
ing in the general government. Al­  
though with a constitution more enfee­  
bled than his, at an age when he  
thought it necessary to prepare for re­  
tirement, I feel myself alone bereaved  
of my last brother; yet I derive strong  
consolation from the unanimous dis­  
position which appears in all ages and  
classes to mingle their sorrows with  
mine, on this common calamity to the  
WorID.  
&quot;The life of our Washington cannot  
suffer by comparison with those of  
other countries who have been most  
celebrated and exxalted by fame. The  
attributes and decorations of royalty  
could only have served to eclipse the  
majesty of those virtues which made  
him from being a modest citizen in  
more resplendent luminary; misfortune,  
had he lived, could hereafter have sul­  
lied his glory only with those super­  
ficial minds, who, believing that char­  
acters and actions are marked by suc­  
cess alone, rarely deserve to enjoy it.  
Malice could never blast his honor, and  
envy made him a singular exception to  
her universal rule. For himself, he had  
lived enough to life and glory. For his  
fellow citizens, if their prayerscould  
have been answered, he would have  
been immortal. For me his departure  
is a most unfortunate moment. Trust­  
ing, however, in the wise and righteous  
dominions of providence over the pas­  
sions of men, and the result of their  
councils and actions, as well as over  
their lives, nothing remains for me but  
humble resignation.  
&quot;His example is now complete, and  
it will teach wisdom and virtue to  
a will teach wisdom and wirtue  
nagistrates, elttgens and men, wit enl­  
erations, as long as our history shall

The life of our Washington cannot suffer by a com­  
parison with those of other countries who have been  
most celebrated and exalted by fame. The attri­  
butes and decorations of royalty could only have  
served to eclipse the majesty of those virtues which  
made him from being a modest citizen a more re­  
splendent luminary. Misfortune, had he lived, could  
hereafter have sullied his glory only with those  
superficial minds who, believing that characters and  
actions are marked by success alone, rarely deserve  
to enjoy it. Malice could never blast his honor, and  
envy made him a singular exception to her universal  
rule. For himself he had lived long enough for life  
and glory. For his fellow cittzens, if their prayers  
could have been answered, he would have been im­  
mortal. His example is now complete, and it will  
teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and  
men, not only in the present age, but in all future  
generations, as long as our history shall be read.
