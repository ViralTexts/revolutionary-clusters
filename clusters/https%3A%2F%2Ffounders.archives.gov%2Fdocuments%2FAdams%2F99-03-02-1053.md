An additional one has been furnished, by a struggle of later date, between the different branches of Government, in this State.  
The Constitution of the State of Pennsylvania, which is a close imitation of the federal Constitution, so far as its provisions could be applied to State purposes, declares Act 2. Sect: 8. that “No member of Congress from this State; nor any person holding or exercising any office of trust or profit, under the United States, shall at the same time, hold or exercise the office of judge, Secretary, treasurer, prothonotary, Register of Wills, Recorder of deeds, Sheriff, or any Office in this State, to which a salary is by law, annexed, or any other Office, which future legislatures shall declare, incompatible with offices or appointments under the United States.”

tures on the proceedings of the legislature of this  
state, relative to the then projected law, declaring  
the holding of offices under the general and ‘state  
governments, at the same time, incompatible, has  
committed an error in asserting, that the legislature  
had ne right to pass such a law, so far as it was re-  
trospective in its operation. Of this he may be  
convinced, by a reference to the 8th section of the  
2d article of the constitution, the words of which  
are as follow :  
  
Art. 2, sect. 8. “ No member of congress from  
this state, nor any person holding or exercising  
any office of trust or profit under the United States,  
shall, at the same time, hold or exercise the office  
of judge, secretary, treasurer, prothonotary, register
