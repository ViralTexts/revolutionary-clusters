Dear Sir  
Department of State 14th. Octr 1805  
  
With the concurrence of Genl. Dearborn, I have given the following Sketch for publication: “We understand that on the 15th. Augt. Mr. Monroe our Minister in London had an interview with Ld. Mulgrave, the Br. Secretary of State for foreign affairs, on the Subject of the recent captures, when it appeared that no new order had been issued, but that they proceeded from the decisions recently made in the High Court of Appeals, Subjecting the trade between European hostile countries and their colonies, through a neutral State, to a much narrower rule than had been before contemplated. At this interview the Subject was not discussed in detail, between Mr. M. and the Minister, but the latter assured him that there was nothing in the disposition of his government, which would admit of an unfriendly measure against the U.S. Another conference having been requested by Mr. M. for the purpose of entering more fully into the affair it remains to be seen what will be the issue of this important business.” Your
