A Memorial To their High Mightinesses, the States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries.  
High and Mighty Lords  
The Subscriber has the Honour to propose to your High Mightinesses, that the United States of America, in Congress Assembled, have lately thought fit to send him a Commission (with full Powers and Instructions) to confer with your High Mightinesses, concerning a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, an authentic Copy of which he has the Honour to annex to this Memorial.  
At the Times, when the Treaties between this Republick and the Crown of Great Britain, were made, the People, who now compose the United States of America, were a Part of the English Nation; as such, Allies of the Republick, and Parties to those Treaties; entitled to all their Benefits, and chearfully submitting to all their Obligations.  
It is true, that when the British Administration, renouncing the ancient Character of Englishmen for Generosity, Justice and Humanity, concieved the design of subverting the political Systems of the  Colonies; depriving them of the Rights and Liberties of Englishmen, and reducing them to the worst of all Forms of Government; starving the People, by blockading the Ports and cutting off their Fisheries and Commerce; sending Fleets and Armies to destroy every Principle and Sentiment of Liberty, and to consume their Habitations and their Lives; making Contracts for foreign Troops and Alliances with savage Nations to assist them in their Enterprise; casting, formally, by Act of Parliament, three Millions of People at once out of the Protection of the Crown: then, and not ’till then, did the United States of America, in Congress Assembled, pass that memorable Act, by which they assumed an equal Station among the Nations.  
This immortal Declaration, of the fourth of July one thousand seven hundred and seventy six, when America was invaded by an hundred Vessels of War, and, according to Estimates laid before Parliament, by fifty five thousand of veteran Troops, was not the Effect of any sudden Passion, or Enthusiasm; but a Measure, which had been long in deliberation among the People, maturely discussed in some hundreds of popular Assemblies, and by public Writings in all the States: it was a Measure, which Congress did not adopt, until they had recieved the positive Instructions of their Constituents: it was then unanimously adopted by Congress, subscribed by all its Members, transmitted to the Assemblies of the several States, and by them respectively accepted, ratified and recorded among their Archives: so that no Decree, Edict, Statute, Placart or fundamental Law of any Nation was ever made with more Solemnity, or with more Unanimity or Cordiality adopted, as the Act and Consent of the whole People, than this: and it has been held sacred to this day by every State with such unshaken Firmness, that not even the smallest has ever been induced to depart from it; although the English have wasted many Millions, and vast Fleets and Armies in the vain Attempt to invalidate it. On the contrary, each of the thirteen States has instituted a Form of Government for itself, under the Authority of the People; has erected its Legislature in the several Branches; its Executive Authority with all its Offices; its Judiciary Departments and Judges; its Army, Militia, Revenue, and some of them their Navy: and all these Departments of Government have been regularly and constitutionally organized under the associated Superintendency of Congress, now these five Years, and have acquired a Consistency, Solidity and Activity, equal to the oldest and most established Governments. It is true, that in some Speeches and Writings of the English it is still contended, that the People of America are still in Principle and Affection with them: but these Assertions are made against such evident Truth and Demonstration, that it is surprising they should find at this day one Believer in the World. One may appeal to the Writings and recorded Speeches of the English for the last seventeen Years to shew, that similar Misrepresentations have been incessantly repeated through that whole Period, and that the Conclusion of every Year has in fact confuted the confident Assertions and Predictions of the beginning of it. The Subscriber begs Leave to say from his own Knowledge of the People of America, (and he has a better right to obtain Credit, because he has better Opportunities to know than any Briton whatsoever) that they are unalterably determined to maintain their Independence. He confesses, that notwithstanding his Confidence through his whole Life in the virtuous Sentiments and Uniformity of Character among his Countrymen, their Unanimity has surprised him: that all the Power, Arts, Intrigues and Bribes, which have been employed in the several States, should have seduced from the Standard of Virtue so contemptible a few, is more fortunate than could have been expected. This Independence stands upon so firm and broad a Bottom of the Peoples Interests, Honour, Consciences and Affections, that it will not be affected by any Successes that the English may obtain either in America, or against the European Powers at War, nor by any Alliances they can possibly form, if indeed in so unjust and desperate a Cause they can obtain any.  
Nevertheless, although compelled by Necessity, and warranted by the fundamental Laws of the Colonies, and of the British Constitution; by Principles avowed in the English Laws, and confirmed by many Examples in the English History; by Principles interwoven into the History and public Right of Europe in the great Examples of the Helvetic and Batavian Confederacies and many others, and frequently acknowledged and ratified by the Diplomatic Body; Principles founded in eternal Justice and the Laws of God and Nature: to cut asunder forever all the Ties which had connected them with Great Britain; yet the People of America did not consider themselves as seperating from their Allies, especially the Republick of the United Provinces, or departing from their Connections with any of the People under their Government: but, on the contrary, they preserved the same Affection, Esteem and Respect for the Dutch Nation in every Part of the World, which they and their Ancestors had ever entertained.  
When sound Policy dictated to Congress the Precaution of sending Persons to negotiate natural Alliances in Europe, it was not from any failure in Respect, that they did not send a Minister to your High Mightinesses with the first whom they sent abroad: but, instructed in the Nature of the Connections between Great Britain and the Republick, and in the System of Peace and Neutrality, which She had so long pursued, they thought proper to respect both so far, as not to seek to embroil her with her Allies, to excite Divisions in the Nation or lay Embarrassments before it. But, since the British Administration, uniform and persevering in Injustice, despising their Allies, as much as their Colonists and fellow Subjects; disregarding the Faith of Treaties, as much as that of Royal Charters; violating the Law of Nations, as they had before done the fundamental Laws of the Colonies, and the inherent Rights of British Subjects; have arbitrarily set aside all the Treaties between the Crown and the Republick, declared War, and commenced Hostilities, the settled Intentions of which they had manifested long before, all those Motives, which before restrained the Congress, cease, and an Opportunity presents of proposing such Connections, as the United

s are not perfectly alike, there is yet Analogy enough between them to make a Connection easy in this respect.  
In general Usages, and in the Liberality of Sentiments in those momentous Points, the Freedom of Inquiry, the Right of private Judgment and the Liberty of Conscience, of so much Importance to be supported in the World, and imparted to all Mankind, and which at this Hour are in more danger from Great Britain, and that intolerant Spirit which is secretly fermenting there, than from any other Quarter, the two Nations resemble each other more than any others.  
The Originals of the two Republicks are so much alike, that the History of one seems but a Transcript from that of the other: so that every Dutchman, instructed in the Subject, must pronounce the American Revolution just and necessary, or pass a Censure upon the greatest Actions of his immortal Ancestors; Actions which have been approved and applauded by Mankind, and justified by the Decision of Heaven.  
But the Circumstance, which, perhaps in this Age, has stronger Influence than any other in the formation of Friendships between Nations, is the great and growing Interest of Commerce; of the whole System of which through the Globe, your High Mightinesses are too perfect Masters for me to say any thing th

If therefore an Analogy of Religion, Government, Original, Manners and the most extensive and lasting Commercial Interests can form a Ground and an Invitation to political Connection, the Subscriber flatters himself, that in all these Particulars, the Union is so obviously natural, that there has seldom been a more distinct Designation of Providence to any two distant Nations to unite themselves together.

o it, if they were, on the other: why should a Source of Contention be left open for future Contingencies to involve the Nations of Europe in still more Bloodshed; when, by one decisive Step of the Maritime Powers, in making Treaties with a Nation long in Possession of Sovereignty, by Right and in Fact, it might be closed.  
The Example of your High Mightinesses would, it is hoped, be followed by all the Maritime Powers, especially those, which are Parties to the late Marine Treaty: nor can an Apprehension, that the Independence of America would be injurious to the Trade of the Baltic be any Objection. This Jealousy is so groundless, that the reverse would happen. The Freight and Insurance in Voyages across the Atlantic are so high, and the Price of Labour so dear in America, that Tar, Pitch, Turpentine and Ship Timber can never be transported to Europe at so cheap a Rate, as it has been and will be afforded by Countries round the Baltic. This Commerce was supported by the English before the Revolution with difficulty, and not without large Parliamentary Bounties. Of Hemp, Cordage and Sail Cloth, there will not probably be a Sufficiency raised in America for her own Consumption in many Centuries, for the plainest of all Reasons, because those Articles can be imported from Amsterdam, or even from Petersbourg or Archangel cheaper than they can be raised at Home. America will therefore be for Ages a Market for these Articles of the Baltic Trade.  
Nor is there more Solidity in another Supposition, propagated by the English to prevent other Nations from pursuing their true Interests, that other Colonies will follow the Example of the United States. Those Powers, which have as large Possessions as any beyond Seas, have already declared against England, apprehending no such Consequences. Indeed there is no Probability of any other Power of Europe following the Example of England, in attempting to change the whole System of the Government of Colonies, and reducing them by Oppression to the Necessity of governing themselves. And without such manifest Injustice and Cruelty on the Part of the Metropolis, there is no danger of Colonies attempting Innovations. Established Governments are founded deeply in the Hearts, the Passions, the Imaginations and Understandings of the People, and without some violent Change from without to alter the Temper and Character of the whole People, it is not in human Nature to exchange Safety for Danger, and certain Happiness for very precarious Benefits.  
It is submitted to the Consideration of your High Mightinesses, whether the System of the United States, which was minutely considered and discussed and unanimously agreed on in Congress in the Year one thousand seven hundred and seventy six, in planning the Treaty they proposed to France, to form equitable Commercial Treaties with all the Maritime Powers of Europe, without being governed or monopolized by any: a System which was afterwards approved by the King, and made the Foundation of the Treaties with his Majesty: a System to which the United States have hitherto constantly adhered, and from which they never will depart, unless compelled by some Powers declaring against them, which is not expected; is not the only means of preventing this growing Country from being an Object of everlasting Jealousies, Rivalries and Wars among the Nations. If this Idea is just, it follows, that it is the Interest of every State in Europe, to acknowledge American Independency immediately. If such benevolent Policy should be adopted, the new World will be a proportional Blessing to every Part of the old.  
The Subscriber has the further Honour of informing your High Mightinesses, that the United States of North America in Congress Assembled, impressed with an high Sense of the Wisdom and Magnanimity of your High Mightinesses, and of your inviolable Attachment to the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, and being desirous of cultivating the Friendship of a Nation, eminent for its Wisdom, Justice and Moderation, have appointed the Subscriber to be their Minister Plenipotentiary to reside near You, that he may give You more particular Assurances of the great Respect they entertain for your High Mightinesses, beseeching your High Mightinesses to give entire Credit to every thing, which their said Minister shall deliver on their Part, especially when he shall assure You of the Sincerity of their Friendship and Regard. The original Letter of Credence, under the Seal of Congress, the Subscriber is ready to deliver to your High Mightinesses, or to such Persons as You shall direct to recieve it. He has also a similar Letter of Credence to his most Serene Highness the Prince Stadtholder.  
All which is respectfully submitted to the Consideration of your High Mightinesses, together with the Propriety of appointing some Person or Persons, to treat on the Subject of his Mission, by

 Britain, by the conclufion of treaties, the people, who at  
this time compofe the United States of America, made part of  
the Englifh nation, and as. fuch they were the allies of the Re-  
public, participating of the fame treaties. gAs they find a plea-  
fyre.in acknowledging the obliganions. of that alliance, they  
therefore have a right to claim the advantages thereof. It was  
not till the Brisifh Government, throwing off al! the fentiments  
of penerofty, probity, aod humanity which formerly characte-  
rifed the Einglith nation, had conceived the project of annihila-  
tiog the political conftitution of the Colonies, depriving them cf

the moit dreadful of all fyftems of government, caufing the peo-  
ple to perith by famine, in blocking up their ports, and putting  
a ftop to their fifheries and commerce, by fending fleets and  
armies to extirpate every principel and fentiment’of liberty, and  
deftroying their habitations and their lives: It was not till they  
formed treaties, engaging foreign troops, and alliances, with fa-  
wages, employing them in the execution of their defigns: It  
was not ull they attempted formally to deprive, by an act of  
Faliament, three millions of men, at once, of the protection of  
the Crown: it was not till after all thefe vidlences, that the  
United States of America, in Congrefs affembled, paffed that  
memorable aé&amp;, wherein they announced to the whole world,  
that they touk their place and rank among InpErENDEeNT Na-

This ever memorable declaration, made the 4th of July,  
1476, at a time when America was attacked and furrounded  
by near 100 fhips of war, apd, according to the accounts laid  
before Parliament, invaded by 50,000 veteran troops, was not

United Provinces of the Low Countries;  
  
High and Mighty Lords;  
| HE Subſctiber has the hohour to propofe to your  
High Mightineſſes, that the United States of Ame-  
rica, in Congreſs aſſembled, have lately thought fit to  
ſend him a commiſſion (with full powers and inſtructions)  
to confer with your High Mightineſſes concerning a treaty  
of amity and commerce, an authentic copy of which he  
has the honour to annex to this memorial.  
At the times when the treaties between this Republic  
and the Crown of Great Britain were made; the people,  
who now compoſe the United States of America, were  
a part of the Engliſh nation; as ſuch, allies of the Re-  
public; and parties to thoſe treaties ; entitled to all their  
benefits, and ſubmitting chearfully to all their obligations.  
It is true, that when the Britiſh Adminiſtration, re-  
nouncing the ancient character of Engliſhmen for gene-  
roſity; juſtice; and humanity, conceived the deſign of  
ſubverting the political ſyſtems of the Colonies ; depriving  
them of the rights and liberties of Engliſhmen, and re-  
ducing them to the worſt of all forms of government;  
ſtarving the people by blockading the ports, and cutting  
off their fiſheries and 2 ; ſending fleets and ar-

mies to deſtroy every principle and ſentiment of liberty,  
and to conſume their habitations and their lives ; making  
contracts for foreign troops, and alliances with ſavage  
nations to aſſiſt them in their enterpriſe; caſting for-  
mally, by act of parliament, three millions of people at  
once out of the protection of the Crown: Then, and not  
till then, did the United States of America, in Congreſs  
aſſembled, paſs that memorable act, by which they aſ-  
  
ſumed an equal ſtation among the nations. |  
This immortal declaration, of the 4th of July, 1776,  
when America was invaded by an hundred veffels of war,  
and, according to eſtimates laid before parliament, by  
555000 of veteran troops, was not the effect of any ſud-  
en paſſion or enthuſiaſm ; but a meaſure which had been  
long in deliberation among the people, maturely diſcuſſed  
in ſome hundreds of popular aflemblies, and by public  
writings in all the ſtates. It was a meaſure which Con-  
8 did not adopt, until they had received the poſitive in-  
ructions of their conſtituents in all the States: It. was  
then unanimouſly adopted by r ſubſcribed by all  
  
  
States, and by them reſpectively accepted, ratified, and  
recorded among their archives; ſo that no decree, edict,  
ſtatute, placart, or fundamental law of any nation was  
ever made with more ſolemnity, or &#x27;with more unanimity  
or cordiality adopted, as the act and conſent of the whole  
  
  
day by every ſtate, with ſuch unſhaken firmneſs, that  
not even the ſmalleſt has ever been induced to depart  
from it; although the Engliſh have waſted many millions,  
and vaſt fleets and armies, in the vain attempt to invali-  
date it. On the contrary, each of the Thirteen States  
has inſtituted a form of government for itſelf, under the  
AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE ; has erected its legiſla-  
ture in the ſeveral branches; its executive authority with  
all its offices; its judiciary departments and judges ; its  
army, militia, revenue, and ſome of them their navy:  
And all thoſe departments of government have been regu-  
larly and conſtitutionally organized under the affociated  
ſuperintendency of Congreſs, now theſe five years, and  
have acquired a conſiſtency, ſolidity, and activity equal  
to the oldeſt and moſt eſtabliſhed governments. It 1s  
_— N 5 true,  
  
„  
true, that in ſome ſpeeches and writings of the Engliſh it  
is ſtill contended that the people of America are ſtill in  
principle and affection with them: But theſe aſſertions  
are made againſt ſuch evident truth and demonſtration,  
that jt is ſurpriſing they ſhould find at this day one be-  
liever in the world. One may appeal to the writings and  
recorded ſpeeches of the Engliſh for the laſt ſeventeen  
years, to ſhew that ſimilar miſrepreſentations have been  
inceſſantly repeated through that whole period; and that  
the concluſion of every year has in fact confuted the con-  
fident aſſertions and predictions of the beginning of it.  
The ſubſcriber begs leave to ſay from his own know-  
ſedge of the people of America, (and he has a better right  
to obtain credit, becauſe he has better opportunities to  
know, than any Briton whatſoever) that they are unalte-  
rably determined to maintain their IG, He con-  
feſles, that, notwithſtanding his confidence through his  
whole life in the virtuous ſentiments and uniformity of  
character among his countrymen, their unanimity has  
ſurpriſed him. That all the power, arts, intrigues, and  
bribes which have been employed in the ſeveral States,  
ſhould have ſeduced from the ſtandard of virtue ſo con-  
temptible a few, is more fortunate than could have been  
expected. This independence ſtands upon fo broad and  
frm a bottom of the people&#x27;s intereſts, honour, con-  
ſciences, and affections, that it will not be affected by any  
ſucceſſes the Engliſh may obtain either in America, or  
_ againſt the European powers at war, nor by any alliances  
they can poſſibly form; if indeed, in ſo unjuſt and def-  
perate a cauſe they can obtain any. Nevertheleſs, al-  
though compelled by neceſſity, and warranted by the fun-  
damental laws of the colonies, and of the Britiſh conſtitu-  
tion, by principles avowed in the Engliſh laws, and con-  
firmed by many examples in the Engliſh hiſtory ; by prin-  
ciples interwoven into the hiſtory and public right of Eu-  
rope, in the great examples of the Helvetic and Belgic  
confederacies, and many others; and frequently acknow-  
ledged and ratified by the diplomatic body ; principles  
founded in eternal juſtice, and the laws of God and na-  
ture, to cut aſunder for ever all the ties which had con-  
nected them with Great Britain: Yet the people of Ame-  
rica did not conſider themſelves as ſeparating from their  
1 | allies,

it, if they were fo inclined, on the other; why ſhould a  
ſource of contention be left open, for future contingencies  
to involve the nations of Europe in ſtill more bloodſhed,  
when, by one deciſive ſtep of the maritime powers, in  
making treaties with a nation long in poſſeſſion of ſove-  
reignty by right and in fact, it might be cloſed ?  
  
&#x27;The example of your High Mightinefſes would, it is,  
hoped, be followed by all the maritime powers, eſpecially  
  
  
the apprehenſion that the independence of America would  
be injurious to the trade of the Baltic, be any objection,  
This jealouſy is ſo groundleſs that the reverſe would hap-  
pen. The freight and inſurance in voyages acroſs the  
Atlantic are ſo high, and the price of labour in America  
ſo dear, that tar, pitch, turpentine, and ſhip-timber never  
can be tranſported to Europe at fo cheap a rate, as it has  
been and will be afforded by countries round the Baltic.  
This commerce was ſupported by the Engliſh before the  
revolution with difficulty, and not without large parlia-  
mentary bounties. Of hemp, cordage, and fait-cloth  
there will not probably be a ſufficiency raiſed in America  
for her own conſumption in many centuries, for the plain-  
eſt of all reaſons, becauſe theſe articles may be imported  
from Amſterdam, or even from Peterſburg and Archangel,  
cheaper than they can be raiſed at home. America will  
therefore be for ages a market for theſe articles of the _  
Baltic trade.  
  
Nor is there more ſolidity in another ſuppoſition, pro-  
pagated by the Engliſn to prevent other nations from  
purſuing their true intereſts, that the colonies of other  
nations will follow the example of the United States.  
Thoſe powers, who have as large poſſeſſions as any be-  
yond ſeas, have already declared againſt England, appre-  
hending no ſuch conſequences. Indeed there is no pro-  
  
  
ample of England, in attempting to change the whole  
ſyſtem of the government of colonies, and reducing them  
  
  
and, without ſuch manifeſt injuſtice and cruelty on the  
part of the metropolis, there is no danger of colonies  
attempting innovations. Eſtabliſhed governments are  
  
founded deep in the hearts, the paſſions, the 3  
| and  
  
„  
and underſtandings of the people; and without ſome vio-  
lent change from without, to alter the temper and cha-  
racer of the whole people, it is not in human nature to  
  
exchange ſafety for danger, and certain happineſs for very  
  
precarious benefits. .  
  
It is ſubmitted to the conſideration of your High Migh-  
tineſſes, whether the ſyſtem of the United States, which  
was minutely conſidered and diſcuſſed, and unanimouſly  
agreed on in Congreſs in the year 1776, in planning the  
treaty they propoſed to France, to form equitable com-  
mercial treaties with all the maritime powers of Europe,  
without being governed or monopolized by any : a ſyſtem  
which was afterwards approved by the king, and made  
the foundation of the treaties with his majeſty : a ſyſtem  
to which the United States have hitherto conſtantly ad-  
hered, and from which they never will depart, unleſs  
compelled by ſome powers declaring againſt them, which  
is not expected, is not the only means of preventing this  
growing country from being an object of everlaſting jea-  
louſies, rivalries, and wars among the nations. If this  
idea be juſt, it follows, that it 7s the intereſt of every ſtate  
in Europe to acknowledge American independency immediately.  
If ſuch benevolent policy ſhould be adopted, the new  
world will be a proportional blefling to every part of  
the old. I SN | | 5  
  
The ſubſcriber has the farther honour of informing your  
High Mightineſſes, that the United States of America,  
in Congreſs aſſembled, impreſſed with an high ſenſe of the  
wiſdom and magnanimity of your High Mightineſſes, and  
of your inviolable attachment to the rights and liberties
