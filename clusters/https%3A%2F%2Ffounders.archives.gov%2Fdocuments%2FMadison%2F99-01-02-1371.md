	Department of State, February 3--1807  
					  
					The triplicate of your communication of Novr. llth. has just been received. Those of Sepr. l2, had been previously received in due time.  
					The turn which the negotiation has taken, was not expected, and excites as much of regret as of disappointment. The conciliatory spirit manifested on both sides, with the apparent consistency of the interest of Great Britain, with the right of the American  
						flag, touching impressments, seemed to promise as much success to your efforts on that subject as on the others; and, notwithstanding the perseverance of the British Cabinet in resisting your reasonable propositions, the hope is not abandoned that a more enlightened and  
						enlarged policy will finally overcome scruples which doubtless proceed more from habits of opinion and official caution than from an unbiassed regard to all the considerations which enter into the true merits of the question.  
					In the mean time the President has with all those friendly and conciliatory dispositions which produced your mission, and pervade your instructions, weighed the arrangement held out in your last letter, which contemplates a formal adjustment of the other  
						topics under discussion, and an informal understanding only, on that of impressment. The result of his deliberations which I am now to state to you, is, that it does not comport with his views of the national sentiment or the Legislative policy, that any treaty should be  
						entered into with the British Government which, whilst on every other point it is either limited to, or short of strict right, would include no article providing for a case which both in principle and in practice is so feelingly connected with the honor and Sovereignty of the  
						nation as well as with its fair interests; and indeed with the peace of both nations.  
					The President thinks it more eligible, under all circumstances, that if no satisfactory and formal stipulation on the subject of impressment be attainable, the negotiation should be made to terminate without any formal compact whatever, but with a mutual  
						understanding, founded on friendly and liberal discussions and explanations, that in practice each party will entirely conform to what may be thus informally settled. And you are authorized, in case an arrangement of this kind shall be satisfactory in its substance, to give  
						assurances that as long as it shall be duly respected in practice by the other party, more particularly on the subjects of neutral trade and impressments, it will be earnestly, and probably successfully recommended to Congress by the President, not to permit the  
						nonimportation Act to go into operation. You are also authorized to inform the British government that the President adhering to the sentiments which led him to recommend to Congress at the commencement of the Session, a suspension of that act, and trusting to the influence  
						of mutual dispositions and interests in giving an amicable issue to the negotiations, will, if no intervening intelligence forbid, exercise the authority vested in him by the Act of continuing its suspension from the 1st. day of July to the time limited by the Act, and which  
						will afford to Congress, who will then be in Session, the opportunity of making due provision for the case.  
					You will perceive that this explanation of the views of the President, requires that if previous to the receipt of it, a Treaty not including an article relating to impressments should have been concluded and be on the way, the British Commissioners should  
						be candidly apprized of the reasons for not expecting its ratification, and that on this ground they be invited to enter anew on the business, with an eye to such a result as has just been explained and authorized.  
					Having thus communicated the outline assigned by the President, as your guide in the important and delicate task on your hands, I proceed to make a few observations which are suggested by the contents of your last dispatches, and which may be of use in your  
						further discussions and your final arrangements.  
					  
						Impressments.  
					  
					The British Government is under an egregious mistake in supposing that &quot;no recent causes of complaint have occurred&quot; on this subject. How far the language of Mr Lymans books may countenance this error I cannot say; but I think it probable that even there  
						the means of correcting it may be found. In the American seas, including the West Indies, the impressments have perhaps at no time been more numerous or vexatious. It is equally a mistake therefore to suppose, &quot;that no probable inconvenience can result from the postponement  
						of an article&quot; for this case.  
					The remedy proposed in the note from the British Commissioners, however well intended, does not inspire the confidence here which gave it so much value in their judgment. They see the favorable side only of the character of their naval Commanders. The  
						spirit which vexes neutrals in their maritime rights, is fully understood by neutrals only. The habits generated by naval command, and the interest which is felt in the abuse of it, both as respects captures and impressments render inadequate every provision which does not  
						put an end to all discretionary power in the Commanders. As long as the British Navy has so complete an ascendency on the high seas, its Commanders have not only an interest in violating the rights of neutrals within the limits of neutral patience, especially of those whose  
						commerce and mariners are unguarded by fleets: they feel moreover the strongest temptation, as is well known from the occasional language of some of them, to covet the full range for spoliation opened by a state of war. The rich harvest promised by the commerce of the  
						UStates, gives to this cupidity all its force. Whatever general injuries might accrue to their nation, or whatever surplus of reprisals might result to American Cruizers, the fortunes of British Cruizers would not be the less certain in the event of hostilities between the  
						two nations.  
					Whilst all these considerations require in our behalf the most precise and peremptory security against the propensities of British Naval Commanders, and on the tender subject of impressment more than any other, it is impossible to find equivalent or even  
						important motives on the British side for declining such a security. The proposition which you have made, aided by the internal regulations which the British Government is always free to make, closes all the considerable avenues through which its seamen can find their way  
						into our service. The only loss consequently which could remain, would be in the number at present in this service, with a deduction of those who might from time to time voluntarily leave it, or be found within the limits of Great Britain or of her possessions; and in the  
						proportion of this number who might otherwise be gained by impressment. The smallness of this loss appears from the annual amount of impressments, which has not exceeded a few hundred British seamen, the great mass consisting of real Americans and of subjects of other neutral  
						powers. And even from the few British seamen ought to be deducted those impressed within neutral ports, where it is agreed that the proceeding is clearly unlawful.  
					Under this view of the subject the sacrifice which Great Britain would make dwindles to the merest trifle, or rather, there is just reason to believe that instead of a loss, she would find an actual gain in the excess of the deserters who would be  
						surrendered by the UStates, over the number actually recoverable by impressment.  
					In practice therefore Great Britain would make no sacrifice by acceding to our terms; and her principle, if not expressly saved by a recital as it easily might be, would in effect be so by the tenor of the arrangement; inasmuch as she would obtain for her  
						forbearance to exercise what she deems a right, a right to measures on our part which we have a right to refuse. She would consequently merely exchange one right for another. She would also by such a forbearance, violate no personal right of individuals under her protection.  
						The UStates on the other hand, in yielding to the claims of G Britain, on this subject, would necessarily surrender what they deem an essential right of their flag and of their Sovereignty, without even acquiring any new right; would violate the rights of the individuals  
						under the protection of both, and expose their native Citizens to all the calamitous mistakes voluntary and involuntary of which experience gives such forcible warning.  
					I take for granted that you have not failed to make due use of the arrangement concerted by Mr King with Lord Hawkesbury in the year 1802 for settling the question of impressment. On that occasion, and under that administration, the British principle was  
						fairly renounced in favor of the right of our flag; Lord Hawkesbury having agreed to prohibit impressments altogether on the High seas; and Lord St. Vincent requiring nothing more than an exception of the narrow seas; an exception resting on the obsolete claim of Great  
						Britain to some peculiar dominion over them. I have thought it not amiss to inclose another extract from Mr Kings letter giving an account of that transaction.  
					In the note of Novr. 8. from the British Commissioners, the Security held out to the Crews of our vessels is that instructions have been given, and will be repeated for enforcing the greatest caution &amp;c. If the future  
						instructions are to be repetitions of the past, we well know the inefficacy of them. Any instructions, which are to answer the purpose, must differ essentially from the past, both in their tenor and their sanctions. In case an informal arrangement should be substituted for a  
						regular stipulation, it may reasonably be expected from the candor of the British Government that the instructions on which we are to rely, should be communicated to you.  
					Colonial Trade  
					It may reasonably be expected that on this subject the British Government will not persist in attempting to place the United States on a worse footing than Russia. In agreeing to consider the storing for a month, and changing  
						the ship, as a naturalization of the property, the concession would be on our side not on theirs; and in making this a condition on which alone we could trade with enemy colonies even directly to and from our own ports, beyond the amount of our own consumption, we should make  
						every sacrifice short of a complete abandonment of our pri

ciple, while they would retain as much of their pretension as is compatible with any sacrifice whatever, a pretension too which they have in so many ways fairly precluded themselves from now maintaining. In addition  
						to the many authorities for this remark already known to you, you will find one of the highest grade in 5th. Vol. of Tomlin’s Edition of Brown’s cases in Parliament p. 328, Hendricks and others against Cunningham and others, where it was expressly admitted by the House of  
						Lords, in a war case before them, that &quot;it is now established by repeated determinations, that neither ships nor Cargoes, the property of subjects of neutral powers, either going to trade at, or coming from the  
						French West India Islands, with Cargoes purchased there, are liable to capture: and therefore when a ship and Cargo so circumstanced are Seized and condemned, the Seizure and condemnation shall be reversed and the value of the ship and cargo accounted for and paid to the  
						owners by the captors.&quot;  
					As it has generally happened that the British Instructions, issued to the Vice Admiralty Courts and naval Commanders have not come first to light in British prints, I inclose one of Novr. l4, which has made its appearance in ours. As it relates to the  
						present subject, it claims attention as a proof that all question as to the legality of the voyage, in a Russian Trade with the Enemies of Great Britain is excluded, by limiting the right of capture to the cases where the innocence or ownership of the articles is questioned. The Instruction may at least be considered as coextensive in its favorable import with the Art. in the Russian Treaty; which  
						you have been authorized to admit into your arrangements; and in that view, as well as on account of its date, the instruction may furnish a convenient topic of argument or expostulation.  
					If the British Government once consent that the United States may make their ports a medium of Trade between the Colonies of its Enemies and other Countries belligerent as well as neutral, why should there be a wish to clog it with the regulations  
						suggested? Why not, in fact, consent to a direct trade by our merchants, between those Colonies and all other Countries? Is it that the price may be a little raised on the Consumers by the Circuit of the voyage, and the charges incident to the port regulations? This can not  
						be presumed. With respect to the Enemies of Great Britain, the object would be unimportant; with respect to her neutral friends, it would not be a legitimate object. Must not the answer then be sought in the mere policy of lessening the competition with and  
						thereby favoring the price of British and other Colonial productions re-exported by British Merchants from British ports? and sought, consequently, not in a Belligerent right, or even in a policy merely belligerent; but in one which has no origin or plea but those of  
						commercial jealousy and monopoly.  
					Blockades.  
					On this subject, it is fortunate that Great Britain has already in a formal Communication admitted the principle for which we contend. It will be only necessary therefore to hold her to the true sense of her own act. The words of the communication are,  
						&quot;that vessels must be warned not to enter.&quot; The Term warn technically imports a distinction between an individual notice to vessels, and a general notice, by proclamation or  
						diplomatic communication; and the terms, not to enter, equally distinguishes a notice at or very near the blockaded port, from a notice directed against the original destination, or the apparent intention of a vessel, nowise approaching such a  
						port.  
					Marginal Jurisdiction on the High Sea.  
					There could surely be no pretext for allowing less than a marine league from the shore, that being the narrowest allowance found in any authorities on the Law of Nations. If any nation can fairly claim a greater extent, the United States have pleas which  
						cannot be rejected; And if any Nation is more particularly bound by its own example not to contest our Claim, Great Britain must be so, by the extent of her own claims to Jurisdiction on the Seas which surround her. It is hoped at least that within the extent of one league  
						you will be able to obtain an effectual prohibition of British Ships of war, from repeating the irregularities which have so much vexed our Commerce and provoked the public resentment; and against which an article in your instructions emphatically provides. It cannot be too  
						earnestly pressed on the British Government, that in applying the remedy copied from regulations heretofore enforced against a violation of the neutral rights of British harbors and Coasts, nothing more will be done than what is essential to the  
						preservation of harmony between the two Nations. In no case is the temptation or the facility greater to Ships of war, for annoying our Commerce, than in their hovering on our Coasts, and about our harbours; nor is the National sensibility in any case more justly or more  
						highly excited than by such insults. The Communications lately made to Mr. Monroe, with respect to the conduct of British Commanders even within our own waters, will strengthen the claim for such an arrangement on this Subject, &amp; for such new orders from the British  
						Government as will be a satisfactory security against future causes of complaint.  
					East &amp; West India Trades.  
					If the West India Trade cannot be put on some such footing as is authorized by your Instructions, it will be evidently best, to leave it as it is; and of course, with a freedom to either party to make such regulations as may be justified by those of the  
						other.  
					With respect to the East India Trade, you will find a very useful light thrown on it, in the remarks of Mr. Crowninshield, of which several Copies were forwarded in October. They will confirm to you the impolicy, as explained in your instructions, of  
						putting the Trade under the Regulations admitted into the Treaty of 1794. The general footing of other nations in peace with Great Britain will be clearly more advantageous; and on this footing it will be well to leave or place it, if no peculiar advantages, of which there  
						are Intimations in Mr. Crowninshield’s remarks, can be obtained.  
					Indemnifications.  
					The justice of these ought to be admitted by Great Britain whenever the Claim is founded on violations of our rights, as these may be recognized in any new arrangement or understanding between the parties. But in cases of which there are many examples where  
						the Claim is supported by principles which she never contested, the British Government ought to have too much respect for its professions and its reputation, to hesitate at concurring in a provision analogous to that heretofore adopted.  
					It is not satisfactory to allege that in all such cases, redress may be attained in the ordinary course of Judicial proceedings. If this were true, there would be sound policy as well as true equity and eoconomy in transferring the complaints, from partial  
						Tribunals occupied with a great mass of other cases, to a Joint Tribunal exclusively charged with this special Trust. But it is not true that Redress is attainable in the ordinary course of Justice, and under the actual Constitution and Rules of the Tribunals which administer  
						it in cases of Captures. Of this the facts within your knowledge, and particularly some which have been lately transmitted to Mr. Monroe, are ample and striking proofs; and will doubtless derive, from the manner of your presenting them, all the force with which they can  
						appeal to the sentiments and principles which ought to guide the policy of an Enlightened Nation. I have the Honor to remain, with great Consideration &amp; Respect, Gentlemen, Your Very Obed

The triplicate of jour communica­  
tionsof Nov. llth has just been received.—Those  
of September 11th had been previously received  
in due time.  
The turn which the negociution has taken, was  
not expected, and excites as much of regret as  
ot disappointment. The conciliatory spirit ma­  
nifested en both sides, with llic apparent consis­  
tency of the interest of Great Britain with the  
right ot the American flag, touching impress­  
ments, seemed to promise as much success to your  
efforts on that subject as on the others, and, not­  
withstanding the perseverance of the British ca­  
binet in resisting your reasonable propositions, the  
•&#x27;ope is not abandoned that a more enlightened  
and enlarged policy will finally overcome scruples  
which doubtless proceed more from habits of o­  
pitiiott und official caution, titan from an unbiass­  
ed rcgtusl to all the considerations which enter in­  
to the true merits of the question.  
In the mean time the president has, with all  
those friendly and conciliatory dispositions which  
produced your mission, and pervade your instruc­  
tions, weighed the arrangement held out in your  
last letter, which contemplates a formal adjust­  
ment of the other topics under discussion, and  
an informal understanding only, on that of impress­  
ment. I he result ot ins deliberations, which I  
am now to state to you, is, that it does not com­  
port with his views of the national sentiment or  
the legislative policy, that any treaty should be  
entered into with the British government which,  
Whilst on every oilier point it is cither limited to,  
or short of strict right, would include no article  
providing for a case which, both in principle ami  
in practice, is so feelingly connected with the ho­  
nor and sovereignly of the nation, as well as with  
its fair interests; and indeed w ith the peace of  
both nations.  
The President thinks it more eligible, under all  
| circumstances, that if no satistacloiy or formal  
stipulation on the subject of impressment be at­  
tainable, the negociation should he made to ter­  
minate without any formal compact whatever;  
but with a mutual understanding, founded on  
friendly and liberal discussions and explanations,  
that in practice each partj- will entirely conform  
to what may be tints informally settled. And you

iiim to recommend to congress at the coiturcncc­  
tnetit ot the session, a suspcnslini o{ that net,rn.l

ol July, to the lime I.tinted by the net, a;.it  
which will uiibrd to congress, who will thin be in  
session, the opportunity of nu king due provision  
ibr tiie case.  
You will perceive that this explanation of t!i«  
views ot the president, requires, that if previous  
to tile receipt ofit, a treaty not including an arti­  
cle relating to impi, ssiiu ids, should have been  
concluded and he 011 the way, the Jtfiuisli com­

been explained and kuthor&#x27;-sed. J  
Having thus communicat&#x27; d the outline assign,  
ed by the president as your guide in the important  
and delicate task on your hands ; 1 proceed to  
make a few observations which are suggested hy  
the content* of Vour bust dispatches, and which  
inav be of use in your further discus-ion* and your  
hiiai lUTangcmcat*.  
impressmeiits.  
, ^ British government i» under xti  
mistake in supposing that “ no reqeut causes of  
complaint have occttried,” on this subject.* How  
tat the language ot Mr. I-ytuuirsborks m.iv coun­  
tenance this error, 1 cannot say, but I think it  
probable that even, there, the means of correct­  
ing it limy be .found.  
In the American seas, including the West-In­  
dies, the impressments have perhaps ut no tints  
been more numerous or vexatious. It is equally  
a mistake therefore to suppose “ that no jmlbable  
inconvenience can result form the postponement  
ot an article,” for this ease.  
  
1 lie remedy propose J in me note trom the Bri­  
tish commissioners, however well intended, does  
not inspire the confidence here which gave it sa  
much value in their judgment. Thev see the ‘.&#x27;r.­  
vorablc sale only, of&quot; the character or their it.&#x27;ivaf  
commanders. The spirit which vexes nciiirr d&lt;  
in tlieir maritime rights, is fully understood by  
neutrals only. The habits gvm-iatVd bv oavaj com­  
mand, and the interest which is felt in the abuse  
of it, both as respects captures and impressments,  
rentiers inadequate every provision which does  
not put an end to dll diirralio.tnrv power in tho  
commanders. As long as the Britislniavv Inis so  
complete m ascendency on the. high sea*,‘its com­  
manders have not only an interest in violating tl.w:  
rights of neutrals within the limits of neutral pa .  
Hence, especially of those whose commerce and&quot;&quot;  
mariners ate unguarded by her s ; t!lev feel more­  
over the strongest temptation, as it is well known  
tiom the occasional language of sonic of them  
to covet the full range for spoliation opened by u  
state of war. Tl e ■ veil harvest proipiaed bv tho  
commerce of the United States, gi c* to this cu­  
pidity all its force. Whatever general injuries  
might accrue to their nation, or whatever surplus  
&lt;»t reprisals might re-uK tr* American cruize; s„  
i.i»c lot tunes oi British crUr !&#x27;ers wuuhtnut be ri;t»  
j less certain in the event-uF hostilities between the  
i two nations.  
Whilst ad these considerations require in our  
behah the most precise and premptovy security  
against the propensities ofBritish i.aval tumman­  
ders, and on the tender subject of impressment,  
more than any dther, it is impossible to find equi­  
valent or even important motives ;■»; the British  
side for declining such a security. The prnposi­  
t;on which yon have made, aided by the internal  
regulations which the British government it al­  
ways five to make, closes all the considerable  
i avenues tbrough which its seamen cap find their  
! w,u into our service. Tile only Ic»s consaqucnt­  
v &quot;&#x27;bich could remain, would be in the number  
at present in this service, with a deduction of  
those, who might from time to time, voluntarily  
leave it, or be found within the limits of Great­  
Hritain, or ot her possessions ; and in the pro­  
portion of this reduced imni.her, who might o­  
toerwisc be gained by impressment. The stnall­  
ness of this loss appears from the annual a mount  
ol impressments, which has not exceeded a few  
hundred British seamen ; the great mass consist—,  
ing of real Americans, and of subject* of other  
neutral powers.—Anti even from the few British,  
seamen, ought to be deducted those impressed  
within neutral polls, where it is agreed that tho  
procee ding is clearly unlawful.  
Under this view of the subject, the sacrifice  
whicli GrctiUBritain would make, dwindles to  
the merest trifib ; or rather there is just rcrynn  
&#x27; t,J bejieve, tliat instead of a loss, she would find  
j anartqal gain, ;n the excess of the deserters who  
i w°ul&lt;l be su^endercd by the United States, over  
i the nunfthuAictually rccotc .hlc by impressment,  
j in practice therefore, Great-Britain would  
; make no sacrifice by acceding to our terms ; and  
, her principle, if not expressly saved bv a recital,  
; as ;t easily might be, would in effect in- so by tho  
j tenor of the arrungerm nt ; int.smuch as she  
would obtain for her forbearance to exen.-uns  
what she deems a right—a right to measures on.  
our part, which we have a right to refuse; she  
would, consequently, merely exchange one right.  
  
iui uHuim-i ; sue woujm also u\ sum a torbeat ■»  
anco, violate no personal right i*f individuals tin*  
tier her protection. The United Stati s, &gt;n the &lt;■­  
tlicr hand, in yielding to the claim* of Gre/t­  
Britain, on this subject, would necessarily snr­  
render, what they deem an essential right of  
their flag, and of their .sovereignly, w ithout e­  
ven acquiring any new right; would violate; th®  
rights of (lie individuals, under the protection of*  
both; and expose their native citizen.-* ip all tins  
Calamitous mistakes, voluntary and involuntary*  
of which experience gives *uch forcible warning.  
I take for granted that you have not ftiladto  
make due use of the arrangement consorted by  
Mr. King with I,ord Hawkesbuiy, in 1110 )0111*  
1802, for sett ling tlie&#x27; question oljmpja saineuts.  
On that occasion, and under that administration,&#x27;  
the British principle was f&#x27;airiv renounced in fa­  
vor of the light of our dag ; lord Uawkcsbuny  
having agreed to prohibit m.pro»*&gt;mcnts altoge­  
ther on tlie high sea.*, and lord St. Vincrnt requi­  
ring nothing more than an exception of the nar­  
row seas, an exception resting on the obsolete  
claim of Grcat-Britain, to some peculiar d &#x27;mini­  
on over tlu;m. 1 have thought it not uioiss to en­  
close another extract from Mr. King’s lei ter gi­  
ving an account oi&#x27;that transaction.  
In liie note of November 8, from the Britisln  
commissioners, the security held out to the crew*  
of our vessels is, that instruction.* have Ixen gi­

inefficacy of them. Any instructions wfi.e&#x27;i are

pretension as is compatible witli any sacrifice  
whatever ; a pretensionlnq, which they have in  
*o many ways fairly precluded themselves from  
row maintaining. In addition to the inaneautliori­  
tic* tor this re-mark, a Ire ally known to you, will  
find jiu* of the highest grade in 5ih vol. Tomlin&#x27;s  
edition of Brown&#x27;s cases in parliament, p. J£8,  
H eiidricks and others, agaiiut Cunningham and I  
others, where* it w..a expressly admitted by the  
house blMurds, in a w ar case before them,* that  
“it is now established by repeated detei minati­  
* ous, tliat neither ships nor cargoes, tlic properly  
s»f sublets of neutral powere, either going to

so circumstanced, ate seized and condemned, the

As it lias generally happened that the British  
instruct:&#x27;uis issued to the vice admiralty courts  
cud na val commanders Imyc not first come to light  
in Tj* itish prints, I inclose one of November 14,  
vl i\*h has just imule its appearance in ours. As  
it refutes to the present subject, it claims atten­  
tion us a proof that .&lt;11 question as to the legality  
♦if the voyage, in a Russian trade with the ene*  
Wiles of treat Britain, is excluded, by limiting the  
right of capture to cases where the inroeence or  
•xvnership of the articlet are* questioned. The  
instruction may at least lie considered as co-e\­  
trtixive in its favorable import with the article in  
the Russian treaty, which you have been autho­  
rised to admit into your arrangements ; and in  
that view, as well as on account of its dale, the  
instruction ftwy furnish a convenient topic of ar­  
gumfc’tt or expostulation.  
  
Ii the British government once Consent thrt  
the United States may make their ports n medi-&#x27;  
tnttof trade between the colonics of its enemies i  
and other countries, belligerent as well as neu­  
tral, why should there lie i wish to clog it with  
the regulations suggtsted ? Why not, in fact,  
Consent to a direct trade by our merchants, be­  
tween those colonies and all other countries i Is  
i&#x27; that the price may be u. little raised on the  
consumer*.by the circuit of the Voyage, and the  
charges incident to the port regulations ? This  
c: nnot be presumed. With respect to the ene­  
mies of C. eat Britain, the object would he unini­  
&#x27;])(Hlant. With respect to her neutral friends, it  
would not Ik* a legitimate object. Must not tho  
answer then he sought in the mere police of les­  
sening tlie competition with, and thereby favoring,  
the price of British and other colonial producti­  
ons re-exported by British merchants from Bri­  
tish ports ; and sought couse. juently not ip a l»el­  
ligcrent right, or even in a policy mere lyfhedlii^e­  
ieht—hut in one which has no origin or pb-a but  
those of commercial jealousy and monopoly.  
K 1.0 C K AUKS.  
Oil this subject, it is fortunate that Great Bri­  
tain has already , in a formal communication, ad­  
mitted tlie principle for which w«- contend. It  
will be only necessary, therefore, to hold, her to  
the true sense of her own act. The words of the  
communication are, “ that vessels must be warned  
not to enter.” The term warn, technically im­  
ports a distinction between an individual notice 10  
vessels, and a general notice bv proclamation or  
diplomatic communication—and the terms not to  
enter, equally distinguish a notice at or very near  
&#x27;the blorkiided port, from a notice directed against  
tiie original destination or the apparent intention  
of u vessel no wise approaching sucli a port.  
MOOISAL JURISDICTION ON THE HIGH SEAS  
There could surely he no pretext for allowing  
leas than a marine league from tlie &gt;d»ore ; that  
being the narrowest allowance found in any au­  
thorities on tiie law of nations. If anv nation can  
fairly eiaim a greater extent, tlie United States  
have pleas which cannot be rejected; and if anv  
nation is more particularly bvand&#x27;bv its own ex­  
ample not to contest our cfaim. Great Britain must  
be so, by the extent of her own claims to juris­  
diction on tlie seas which surround her. It is  
hoped at leas&#x27;,that within the extent of one league  
you will be able to obtain an effectual prohibition  
cl British ships of war, from repeating the irre­  
gularities which hare so much vexed our com.  
nierce ancl provoked the public resentment ; and  
against which an article in your instructions em­  
phatically provides. It cannot be too earnestly  
pressed on the British government, that in apply,  
ing the remedy copied li oni regulations heretofore  
enforced against a violation of the neutral riuhts  
-i. .i _ .. .i . n ...  
  
... •» v iiwumijj- more win  
be done than xvhat is essential to the preservation  
yf harmony between the two nations. In no case  
is th6 temptation of tlie facility greater to ships  
ut war, for annoying our commerce, than in their  
hovering on our coast* and about our harbors ;  
nor is the national sensibility in any c ase more  
justly or more highly excited than bv’such insults.  
The communications lately made to Mr. Monroe,  
w ith respect to the conduct of B.-itish commun­  
«1-.S, even w ill ill our own waters, will streimth­  
en the claim for such an arrangement on this sub­  
ject. and for such new orders from the British  
government, as will he a satisfactory security a­  
gainst future causes of complaint.

If tins V est-India tr;itlc cannot be put on sonic  
»l“*h footing rs is authorised by vour instructions,  
n w ill lx; evidently best to leave it as it is ; and  
ol. course with a freedom to either party to make  
such regulations as may he justified by those of  
the other.  
With respect to the East-India trade, you will  
find a very useful light thrown upon it, iii the rc­  
Oi) ark sol of which several copies were  
forwarded in October. They will confirm to you  
the impolicy, ns explained in your instructions, of  
putting the trade finder the regulations admitted  
into Inc treaty &lt;&gt;C 1794. The general footing of  
other nations, in peace with Great Britain, will  
be clearly more advantageous ; and on this foot­  
jam will he well to leave or place it, if no pecu­  
liar ac.»linages (&gt;■ which there are intimations

In the mean time the president has, with all those  
friendly and conciliatory dispositions which pro-  
duced your mission, and pervade your instructions,  
weighed the arrangement held out in your last let-  
ter, which conteinplates a formal adjustment of the  
other topics under discussion, and an informal un-  
derstanding only, on that of impressment. The re-  
sult of his delxberations, which [ am now to state

the national sentiment or the legislative policy, that  
any treaty should be entered into with the British

‘either limited to, or short of strict right, would  
linclude no article providing for a case which both

each party will entirely conform to what may be  
thus informally settled. And you are authorised, in  
case an arrangement of this kind shall be satisfactory  
in its substance, to give assurances that as long as  
it shall be duly respected in practice by the other  
party, more particularly on the subjects of neutral  
trade and impressment, it will be earnestly, and  
| probably, successfully, recommended to congress by  
the president, not to permit the ngn-iimportation act  
to go into operation. You are also autharised to in-  
form the British government that the president,  
adhering to the sentiments which led him to recom-  
mend tu congress at the commencement of the

influence of mutual dispositions and interests in  
giving an amicable issue to the negociations, will,  
‘if no intervening intelligence forbid, exercise the

to the present subject, it claims attention as a proof]  
  
that all questions as to the legality of the voyage,  
in a Russian trade with the enemies of Great Bri-  
tain, is excluded, by limiting the right of capture to  
eases where the énnocence or ownership of the articles,  
are questioned. The instruction may at least be  
considered as co-extensive in its favorable import  
with the article in the Russian treaty, which you  
have been authorised to admit into your arrange-  
ments; and in that view; as well as on account of its  
date, the instruction may furnish a convenient topic  
ef argument or expostulation.  
  
If the British government once consent that the  
United States may make their ports a medium of  
trade between the colonies of its enemies and other  
countries, belligerent as Well as neutral, why should  
there be a wish to clog it with the regulations sug-  
gested? Why not, in fact, consent to a direct trade  
by our merchants, between those colonies and all  
other countries? Is it that the price may be a little  
raised on the consumers by the circuit of the voy-  
age, and the charges incident to the port regula-  
tions. This cannot be presumed. With respect to  
the enemies of Great Britain, the object would be  
unimportant. With respect to her neutral friends, it  
would not be a legitimate object. Must not the an-  
swer then be sought in the fhere policy of lessening  
the competition with, and thereby favoring the price  
of British and other colonial productions re-exported  
by British merchants from British ports; and sought  
consequently not in a belligerent right, or even in a  
policy merely belligerent; but in one which has no  
origin or plea but those of commercial jealousy and  
monopoly.  
  
Blockades.—On this subject, it is forttinate that  
Great Britain has already in a formal communica-  
tion, admitted the principle for which we contend.  
It will be only necessary therefore to hold her to the  
  
true sense of her own act. The words of the commu-:  
  
nication are, ‘‘the vessel must be warned not to en-  
ter.’ The term warn technically imports a distinc-  
tion between an individual notice to vessels, and a  
general notice by proclamation or diplomatic com-  
munication; and the terms mot to enter equally distin-  
guishes a notice at or very near the blockaded port,  
from a notice directed againt the origmal destina-  
tion or the apparent intention of a vessel, no wise  
approaching such a port.  
  
Marginal jurisdiction on the high seas~~There  
could surely be no pretext for allowing less than a  
marine league from the shore; that being the nar-  
rowest allowance found in any authorities on the  
law of nations. If any nation can fairly claim a great-  
er extent, the United States have pleas which can-  
not be rejected; and if any nation is more particu.  
Marly bound by its own example not to contest our  
claim, Great Britain must be so by the extent of  
her own claims to jurisdiction on the high seas  
which surround her. It is hoped at least, that within  
the extent of one league you will be able to obtain  
an effectual prohibition of British ships of war, from  
repeating the irregularities which have so much  
vexed our commerce and provoked the public re  
sentrent; and against which an article in your in-  
structions emphatically provides. It cannot be too  
earnestly pressed on the British government, that in  
applying the remedy copied from regulations here-  
tofore enforced against a violation of the neutral  
sights of British harbors and coasts, nothing more  
will be done than what is essential to the preserva-  
tion of harmony between the two nations. In no case  
is the temptation or the facility greater to ships of  
war, for annoying our commerce, than in their ho-  
vering on our coasts and about our harbors; nor is,  
  
ey  
  
+  
  
more highly excited than by such insults. The éom-  
munications lately made to Mr. Monroe, with respect  
to the conduct of British commanders, even within  
our own waters, will strengthen the claim for such  
an veh mae on this subject, and for such new  
orders, from tHe British government, as will be a  
cs a pint security against future causes of com-  
plaint. eee  
East and West-India trade¢—If thé West-India  
trade cantiot be put on some such footing as is au-  
thorised by your instructions, it will be evidently  
best to leave it as it is; and of course, with a free-  
  
«tom to either party to make such regulations as may  
  
be justified by those of the other,  
  
With respect to the Exast-India trade, you wilf  
find a very useful light thrown on it, in the remarks  
of of which several copies  
were forwarded in October. They will confirm to  
you the impolicy, as explained in your instructions,  
of putting the trade under the regulations admitted  
into the treaty of 1794. The general footing of othe#  
nations, in peace with Grent Britam, will be clearly  
more advantageots; and on this footing, it will be  
well to leave or place it, if ro peculiar advantages,  
of which there are imitations in remarks,  
can be ebtained. 7 e  
  
Indenmifications.—The justice of these ought to  
be admitted by Great Britain, whenéver the claim  
is founded on violations of our rights, as they may  
be recognize:l in any new arrangement or understand-  
ing between the parties. But in cases, of which there  
are many examples, where the claim is supported bY  
principles which she never contested, the Britis  
government ought to have too much respect for its  
professions and its reputation, to hesitate at eoncur-  
ring in a provision analagous to tlat heretofore  
adopied.  
  
It is not satisfactory to allege that in all such cx  
ses, redress may be attained, in the ordinary course  
of judicial proceedings. If this were true, there  
would be sound policy, as well as true equity and  
economy, in transferring the complaints, from par-  
tial tribunals occupied with a great mass of other  
cases, to a joint tribimal, exclusively charged with  
this special trust. But it is not true that redress is  
attainable in the ordinary course of justice, and un-  
der the actual constitution and rules of the tribu-  
nals which administer it in cases of captures. Of  
this, the facts within your knowledge, and particu.  
larly some, which have been lately transmitted to  
Mr. Monroe, are ample and striking proofs; and wilk  
doubtless derive from the manner of your presenting  
them, all the force with which they can appeal to  
the sentiments and principles which ought to guide  
the policy of an enlightened nation.  
  
I have the honor to be, &amp;c. 2
