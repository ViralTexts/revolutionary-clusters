ct of neutrality.’  
If I do not subscribe to the soundness of this reasoning, I do most fully to it’s ingenuity.—I shall now lay down the principles which according to my understanding govern the case.  
I consider the people who constitute a society or nation as the source of all authority in that nation, as free to transact their common concerns by any agents they think proper, to change these agents individually, or the organisation of them in form or function whenever they  please; that all the acts done by those agents under the authority of the nation, are the acts of the nation, are obligatory on them, and enure to their use, and can in no wise be annulled or affected by any change in the form of the government, or of the persons administering it. Consequently the Treaties between the US. and France, were not treaties between the US. and Louis Capet, but between the two nations of America and France, and the nations remaining in existence, tho’ both of them have since changed their forms of government, the treaties are not annulled by these changes.

ve their compacts. There are circumstances however which sometimes excuse the non-performance of contracts between man and man: so are there also between nation and nation. When performance, for instance, becomes impossible, non-performance is not immoral. So if performance becomes self-destructive to the party, the law of self-preservation overrules the laws of obligation to others. For the reality of these principles I appeal to the true fountains of evidence, the head and heart of every rational and honest man. It is there Nature has written her Moral laws, and where every man may read them for himself. He will never read there the permission to annul his obligations for a time, or for ever, whenever they become ‘dangerous, useless, or disagreeable.’ Certainly not when merely useless or disagreeable, as seems to be said in an authori

ee of loss rendered the sale void by the Roman law) ‘if simple lezion, says he, or some degree of disadvantage in a treaty, does not suffice to render it invalid, it is not so as to inconveniences which would go to the ruin of the nation. As every treaty ought to be made by a sufficient power, a treaty pernicious to the state is null, and not at all obligatory; no Governor of a nation having power to engage things capable of destroying the state, for the safety of which the empire is trusted to him. The nation itself, bound necessarily to whatever it’s preservation and safety require, cannot enter into engagements contrary to it’s indispensable obligations.’ Here then we find that the degree of injury or danger which he deems sufficient to liberate us from a treaty, is that which would go to the absolute ruin or destruction of the state; not simply the lesion of the Roman law, not merely the being disadvantageous, or dangerous. For as he says himself  §.158. ‘lezion cannot render a treaty invalid. It is his duty, who enters into engagements, to weigh well all things before he concludes. He may do with his property what he pleases, he may relinquish his rights, renounce his advantages, as he judges proper: the acceptant is not obliged to inform himself of his motives, nor to weigh their just value. If we could free ourselves from a compact because we find ourselves injured by it, there would be nothing firm in the contracts of nations. Civil laws may set limits to lezion, and determine the degree capable of producing a nullity of the contract. But sovereigns acknolege no judge. How establish lezion among them? Who will determine the degree sufficient to invalidate a treaty? The happiness and peace of nations require manifestly that their treaties should not depend on a means of nullity so vague and so dangerous.’  
Let us hear him again on the general subject of the observance of treaties §.163. ‘It is demonstrated in Natural law that he who promises another confers on him a perfect right to require the thing promised, and that, consequently, not to observe a perfect promise, is to violate the right of another; it is as manifest injustice as to plunder any one of their right. All the tranquillity, the happiness and security of mankind rest on justice, on the obligation to respect the rights of others. The respect of others for our rights of domain and property is the security of our actual possessions; the faith of promises is our security for the things which can not be delivered or executed on the spot. No more security, no more commerce among men, if they think themselves not obliged to preserve faith, to keep their word. This obligation then is as necessary as it is natural and indubitable, among nations who live together in a state of nature, and who acknolege no superior on earth, to maintain order and peace in their society. Nations and their governors then ought to observe inviolably their promises and their treaties. This great truth, altho’ too often neglected in practice, is generally acknoleged by all nations: the reproach of perfidy is a bitter affront among sovereigns: now he who does not observe a treaty is assuredly perfidious, since he violates his faith. On the contrary nothing is so glorious to a prince and his nation, as the reputation of inviolable fidelity to his word.’ Again §.219. ‘Who will doubt that treaties are of the things sacred among nations? They decide matters the most important; they impose rules on the pretensions of sovereigns: they cause the rights of nations to be acknoleged, they assure their most precious interests. Among political bodies, sovereigns, who acknolege no superior on earth, treaties are the only means of adjusting their different pretensions, of establishing a rule, to know on what to count, on what to depend. But treaties are but vain words if nations do not consider them as respectable engagements, as  rules, inviolable for sovereigns, and sacred through the whole earth.’ §.220. ‘The faith of treaties, that firm and sincere will, that invariable constancy in fulfilling engagements, of which a declaration is made in a treaty, is then holy and sacred among nations, whose safety and repose it ensures; and if nations will not be wanting to themselves, they will load with infamy whoever violates his faith.’

points out the rights and duties of parties to such contracts:—  
  
“* It isa settled point in national law, that he who has made a promise to any  
one, confers upon him a real right to require the thing promised, and conse-  
quently, that the breach of a perfect promise is a violation of another person’s  
right, and as evidently an act of injustice, as it would be to roba man of his

wholly depends on justice, on the obligation of paying a regard to the rights  
of others; the respect which others pay to our rights of domain and property,  
constitutes the security of our actual possession; the faith of promises is our  
security for things that cannot be delivered or executed on the spot. There  
would no longer be any security, no longer any commerce between man-  
kind, if they did not think themselves obliged to keep faith with each other,  
and to perform their promises; this obligation is then as necessary as it is  
natural and indubitable, between nations that live together in a state of  
nature, and acknowledge no superior upon earth to maintain order and peace  
in their society. Nations, therefore, and their conductors, ought inviolably  
to observe their promises and their treaties. This great truth, though too  
often neglected in practice, is generally acknowledged by all nations.”  
  
He adds further—  
  
‘* As the engagements of a treaty impose on the one hand a perfect  
obligation, they produce on the other a perfect right: the breach of a treaty  
is therefore a violation of the perfect right of the party with whom we have  
contracted, and this is an act of injustice against him.”
