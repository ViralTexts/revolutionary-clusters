4thly. Although it is of the utmost importance to the peace and commerce of the United States that Canada and Nova Scotia should be ceded; and more particularly, that their equal common right to the fisheries should be guarantied to them, yet a desire of terminating the war hath induced us not to make the acquisition of these objects an ultimatum on the present occasion.

That it is essential to the welfare of all these United States, that the inhabitants thereof, at the expiration of the war, should continue to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of their common right to fish on the banks of Newfoundland and the other fishing banks and seas of North America, preserving inviolate the treaties between France and the said States. 3. That application shall be made to his most christian majesty, to agree to some article or articles for the better securing to these states a share in the said fisheries. 4. That if after a treaty of peace with Great Britain, she shall molest the citizens or inhabitants of any of the United States, in taking fish on the banks and places, hereinafter described, such molestation being in our opinion direct violation, and breach of the peace, shall be a common cause of the said states, and the force of the union be exerted to obtain redress for the parties injured.

lenipotentiary of the United States of America to negotiate a treaty of commerce with Great Britain.  
Signed, Cha: Thomson, Sec’y.  
Instructions to the honorable John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, Henry Laurens, and Thomas Jefferson, ministers plenipotentiary in behalf of the United States of America, to negociate a treaty of peace.  
Gentlemen—You are hereby authorized and instructed to concur in behalf of these United States, with his most christian majesty in accepting the mediation proposed by the empress of Russia and the emperor of Germany.  
You are to accede to no treaty of peace which shall not be such as may first effectually secure the independence and sovereignty of the thirteen United States according to the form and effect of the treaties subsisting between the said United States &amp; his most christian majesty; and secondly, in which the said treaties shall not be left, in their full force and validity.  
As to disputed boundaries, and other particulars, we refer you to the instructions given to Mr. John Adams, dated 14th August 1779, and 18th October, 1780, from which you will easily perceive the desires and expectations of congress. But we think it unsafe, at this distance, to tye you up by absolute and peremptory directions, upon any other subject than the two essential articles abovementioned. You are therefore at liberty to secure the interest of the United States, in such manner as circumstances may direct, and as the state of the belligerent, and the disposition of the mediating powers may require. For this purpose, you are to make the most candid and confidential communications, upon all subjects, to the ministers of our generous ally, the King of France: to undertake nothing in the negotiations for peace or truce, without their knowledge and concurrence; and ultimately, to govern yourselves, by their advice and opinion; endeavoring in your whole conduct to make them sensible how much we rely upon his majesty’s influence for effectuating every thing that may be necessary to the peace,  security, and future prosperity of the United States of America.
