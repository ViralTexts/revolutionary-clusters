Sir  
Tapaan the 1st October 1780  
  
Buoy’d above the Terror of Death by the Consciousness of a Life devoted to honorable pursuits and Stained with no Action that can give me Remorse, I trust the request I make to your Excellency at this Serious period and which is to Soften my last moments will not be rejected.  
Sympathy towards a Soldier will Surely induce Your Excellency and a military Tribunal to adapt the Mode of my death to the feelings of a Man of honour.  
Let me hope Sir, that if ought in my Character impresses you with Esteem towards me, if ought in my Misfortunes marks me as the Victim of policy and not of resentment, I shall experience the Operation of these Feelings in your Breast by being informed that I am not to die on a Gibbet. I have the honour to be Your Excellencys Most obedient and most humble Servant

“SIR:  
  
‘‘ Buoy’d above the terror of death by the consciousness of a life devoted to  
honorable pursuits, and stained with no action that can give me remorse, I trust  
that the request I make to your Excellency at this serious period, and which is to  
soften my last moments, will not be rejected. Sympathy towards a soldier will

resentment, I shall experience the operation of these feelings in your heart, by
