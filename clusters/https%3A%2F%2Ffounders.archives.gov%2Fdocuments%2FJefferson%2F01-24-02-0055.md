eg leave to add a most earnest request that on the 1st. day of July next, and on the same day annually afterwards, you make out your own account to that day, and send it by duplicates by the very first safe conveyances. In this I must be very urgent and particular, because at the meeting of the ensuing Congress it will always be expected that the Secretary of state lay before them a statement of the disbursements from this fund from July to June inclusive. I have given orders to Messrs. Willinks, Van Staphorsts &amp; Hubbard our bankers in Amsterdam, to answer your draughts for the allowances herein before mentioned.—The peculiar custom in England of impressing seamen on every appearance of war, will occasionally expose our seamen to peculiar oppressions and vexations. These will require your most active exertions and protection, which we know cannot be effectual without incurring considerable expence: and as no law has yet provided for this, we think it fairer to take the risk of it on the Executive than to leave it on your shoulders. You will therefore with all due economy and on the best vouchers the nature of the case will admit, meet those expences, transmitting an account of them to the Secretary of state to be communicated to the legislature. It will be expedient that you take proper opportunities in the mean time of conferring with the minister on this subject in order to form some arrangement for the protection of our seamen on those occasions. We entirely reject the mode which was the subject of a conversation between Mr. Morris and him, which was that our seamen should always carry about them certificates of their citizenship. This is a condition never yet submitted to by any nation, one with which seamen would never have the precaution to comply, the casualties of their calling would expose them to the constant destruction or loss of  this paper evidence, and thus the British government would be armed with legal authority to impress the whole of our seamen.—The simplest rule will be that the vessel being American, shall be evidence that the seamen on board her are such. If they apprehend that our vessels might thus become asylums for the fugitives of their own nation from impress-gangs, the number of men to be protected by a vessel may be limited by her tonnage, and one or two officers only be permitted to enter the vessel in order to examine the numbers aboard; but no pressgang should be allowed ever to go on board an American vessel till after it shall be found that there are more than their stipulated number on board, nor till after the master shall have refused to deliver the supernumeraries (to be named by himself) to the press-officer who has come on board for that purpose and even then the American Consul should be called in. In order to urge a settlement of this point before a new occasion may arise, it may not be amiss to draw their attention to the peculiar irritation excited on the last occasion, and the difficulty of avoiding our making immediate reprisals on their seamen here. You will be so good as to communicate to me what shall pass on this subject, and it may be made an article of convention to be entered into either there or here.

of these deliberations.  
  
The American government, then, is prepared to  
  
say, that the practice of impressing seamen from |  
  
American vessels cannot be hereafter allowed to take

it does not recognise. and is invariably attended by  
consequences so unjust, so injurious, and of such  
formidable magnitude as cannot be submitted to.  
  
In the early disputes between the two governments  
on this so long cuntested topic, the distinguished  
person to whose hands were first entrusted the seals  
of this department declared, that ‘the simplest rule  
will be, that the vessel being American shall be
