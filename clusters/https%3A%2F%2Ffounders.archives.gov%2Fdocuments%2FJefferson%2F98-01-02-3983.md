aces of a light, gay, we may call it &quot;French&quot;  
style. Of the personal character of Mr. Bennett we  
are not particularly informed. We believe him to  
have been amiable and liberal, and exemplary in all  
his private relations. He was in faith, we believe, a  
Roman Catholic, but neither intolerant nor indif-­  
ferent in matters of religion. We may illustrate  
this by a document which he took pains to obtain  
and publish in the Fennspioanicn of August 10,  
1833, with the highest encomium on its merit. It  
was a letter from Thomas Jenerson addressed to  
his godson, Thomas Jefferson Grotjan, and is as  
follows:  
Your affectionate mother requests that I would address
