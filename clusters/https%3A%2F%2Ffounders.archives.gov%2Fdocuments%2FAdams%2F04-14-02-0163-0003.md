	Bunzlau. 26. July. 1800.  
						  
						Yesterday morning early we took our departure from Freystadt, &amp; came to this place; a distance of eight german miles; five of which are in single stage from Sprotau here— The face of the country has visibly &amp; greatly improved as we came along; &amp; although we still had to wade through miles of sands more, or less deep, we were frequently relieved by patches of good roads, &amp; by beautiful fields of wheat, rye, barley, oats, &amp; especially flax, which appeared in a highly flourishing condition. As it happens to be just now harvest time, we passed many groups of reapers; a sight of which would have afforded us more satisfaction, had we not known, that they were far from gathering the bounties of the season for themselves, &amp; had they not by frequently soliciting our charity proved the wretchedness of their condition— We had travelled through Saxony, a part of the march, &amp; a corner of Bohemia last year at this time, &amp; then too had met many a company of reapers— We had seen several last week, as we came from Berlin; but we had never seen them beg— Since we entered Silesia, yesterday &amp; the day before, certainly more than twenty times, as we passed by troops of peasants of both sexes, who were gathering the harvest, a woman from among them, &amp; sometimes two, or three ran from the fields to our carriage, with a little bunch of flowers, tied up with some ears of the grain they were gathering, which they threw into the carriage at the windows, by way  
  
of begging for a dreyer, or half a grosh— The reason of this is, because the condition of the peasant in Silesia is much worse than in the electorate— For although personal servitude exists alike in both provinces, yet the serf in the March is never obliged to labour for his Lord, more days than there are— In Silesia, he is often obliged to furnish ten days in a week. Judge then after the man &amp; his wife have both labored five days in seven for the lord, what sort of subsistance they can earn in the remaining two, (one of which is a sunday) for themselves.  
						This so little travelling through this country, that unless post horses are bespoken before hand, they must be waited for, untill they can be brought in by some peasant from the fields. Thus we were obliged to stop yesterday three hours at Sprotau, &amp; to employ the time went round the town to see whatever of remarkable it contained— It is a small place with about two thousand inhabitants, one third of whom are catholics— It stands upon the Bober a small branch of the Oder, which likewise runs through this town, but is too small to be navigable, &amp; only serves at Sprotau, to give motion to a number of corn mills &amp; fulling mills, which we saw fully employed. The manufactory of broad cloth is likewise carried on at Sprotau, at Freystadt &amp; indeed in all the towns in this part of Silesia, though in none of them excepting Goldberg, to so great an extent as at Grünberg.  
						In Sprotau there is a convent of nuns, dedicated to St: Mary Magdalen, who not being so liberal in their open intercourse with our sex as their great patroness, could not be visited by me.

We went over the catholic church, which joins upon the nunnery, &amp; is alike dedicated to Mary Magdelen. Of the pictures hung round  
  
the church, &amp; the alter pieces, those, which represent here were alone tolerable. There was an immage, modeled upon the famous one of our Lady at Loretto, which Buonaparte took the liberty of sending to Paris, about four years ago— The most remarkable thing I met in the church was a paper posted up, on the inner side of a confessional; written in Latin, &amp; containing a list of the sins to which the ordinary priest was forbidden to grant absolution, as being expressly reserved for the consideration of the holy father himself— I expected to have found at least some heinous crimes upon the list, but unless the murder of a priest may be considered of that denomination, there was not one. The offences were—burying an heretic in holy ground—reading the books of the heretics, without a special licence—refusing to pay tithes—&amp; about a dozen others all of the same stamp—all having some reference to the papal authority— Observe particularly, that the unpardonable crime of reading heretical books is expressed in terms so vague &amp; comprehensive (libros hereticorum) that they may be construed by the priest to mean almost any books he pleases— And this paper is publickly posted in a country where the catholics themselves are but a tolerated sect, the subjects of a protestant sovereign. It is possible indeed that the restraints of the romish church upon its followers may be more rigorous &amp; more public in such a country, than where its authority is unquestioned &amp; unopposed— Silesia was originally under the Austrian government, a catholic province; at this time, about one half of its inhabitants still adhere to that religion, &amp; although the steady maxims of the prussian Government, &amp; still more the revolutions of time &amp; opinions have powerfully operated to introduce a spirit of mutual forbearance, if not of harmony, there is perhaps no part of Europe, where the root of bitterness between the two parties is yet so deep, &amp; cleaves with such stubbornness to the ground as here— The catholics hate the protestants the more, for their having now the secure &amp; unlimited liberty in their worship; &amp; the protestants envy the catholics the priviledges they still retain, which the Prussian government has bound itself to preserve. Mr Zölner, who has published his tour through Silesia, made in the year 1791, &amp; from whom I draw much of the information I give you, says, that it is common here for a catholic to exhibit, before a Lutheran judge, a complaint against another catholic, for calling him a Lutheran, &amp; requiring satisfaction for what he considers as the blackest slander that could be cast upon him.  
						  
						About halfway between Sprotau, &amp; this place we first came in sight of the mountains towards which we are travelling, &amp; from which we are still about forty of our miles distant.  
					  
					  
						  
							Hirschberg. 27. July. Sunday.  
						  
						Before I give you an account of our journey hither, I must say something of what we saw yesterday at Bunzlau, &amp; which I had not time to tell you, before we continued our journey.  
						The principal manufactory of Bunzlau, is in pottery; particularly of those brown coffee pots &amp; milk pots, of which you have seen many at the inns of Berlin &amp; through the electorate— Of these potters there are at Bunzlau, each of whom employs six or eight workmen— We saw them make several large pots such as are commonly used to hold butter— From a cubic mass of clay, about a foot thick, they form in about five minutes, the pot, by merely moulding it with the hand, while it whirls round upon a sort of circular bench placed before the workman— We could not however stay long to see them, for they work in the same room, where the Ovens are heated to bake the pots, &amp; its warmth was to us intolerable— In the yard of this pottery, there is a pot of prodigious size, made about half a century ago, which contains nearly fifty bushels— It is about twelve feet high; is hooped like a barrel, which it resembles in form, &amp; is kept in a house built on purpose for it— The Germans appear to have a particular predilection for things of an uncommon dimensions in their kind; the tuns of Heidelberg &amp; Königstein, &amp; this pot serve as examples to show how much size enters into their ideas of the sublime.  
						But the greatest curiosities at Bunzlau, are two mechanical genius’s by the name of Jacob, &amp; of Hüttig, a carpenter, &amp; a weaver, who are next door neighbours to each other— The first has made a machine, in which by the means of certain clock work a number of puppets about six inches high, are made to move upon a kind of stage, so as to represent in several successive scenes the passion of Jesus Christ— The first exibits him in the garden at prayer, while the three apostles are sleeping at a distance. In the last he is shewn dead, in the sepulchre, guarded by two roman soldiers— The intervening scenes represent the treachery of Judas; the examination of Jesus before Caiaphas, the dialogue between Pilate &amp; the jews, concerning him; the denial of Peter, the scourging &amp; the crucifixion— It is all accompanied by a mournful dirge of music, &amp; the maker, by way of explanation repeats the passages of scripture, which relates the events  
  
he has undertaken to show— I never saw a stronger proof how powerful the impression of objects, which are brought immediately home to the senses is— I have heard &amp; read more than one eloquent sermon, upon the passion, but I confess, none of their most labored efforts at the pathetic, ever touched my heart with one half the force of this puppet show— The traitor’s kiss, the blow struck by the high priest’s servant, the scourging, the nailing to the cross, the spunge of vinegar, every indignity offered, &amp; every pain inflicted, occasioned a sensation when thus made perceptible to the eye, which I had never felt at mere description; &amp; when we rose to come away, Louisa’s eyes were full of tears.  
						Hüttig the weaver, with an equal, or superior mechanical genius, has applied it in a different manner, &amp; devoted it to geographical, astronomical, &amp; historical pursuits— In the intervals of his leasure from the common weaver’s work, which affords him subsistance, he has become a very learned man— The walls of his rooms are covered with maps &amp; drawings of his own representing, here the course of the Oder, with all the towns &amp; villages, through which it runs; there the mountains of Switzerland, &amp; those of Silesia, over both of which, he has travelled in person— In one room he has two large tables, one raised above the other—on one of them he has ranged all the towns &amp; remarkable places of Germany, &amp; on the other of all Europe; they are placed according to their respective geographical bearings. The names of the towns are written on a small square piece of paper, &amp; fixed in a slit on the top of a peg, which is stuck into the table. The remarkable mountains are shewn by small pyramidical black stones, &amp; little white pyramids are stationed at all the spots, which have been distinguished by any great battle, or other remarkable incident— The man himself in explaining his work, shews abundance of learning relative to the antient names of places, &amp; the former inhabitants of countries to which he points; &amp; amused us with anecdotes of various kinds connected with the lands he has marked out. Thus in shewing us the Alps, he pointed to the spots over which the french army of reserve so lately passed, &amp; where Buonaparte so fortunately escaped being taken by an austrian officer, &amp; then he gave us a short comment of his own upon the character &amp; extraordinary good fortune of the first consul. In a second room he has a large machine representing the copernican system of the universe; it is made so that the whole firmament of fixed stars moves round our solar system once in every twenty four hours, &amp; thus always exhibits the stars in the exact position relative to our earth, in which they  
  
really stand. Internally he has stationed all the planets, which belong to our system, with several satellites, &amp; all the comets that have been observed during the last three centuries. In a third room he has another machine, exhibiting in different parts the various phases of the moon, &amp; those of Jupiter’s satellites— The apparent motion of the sun round the earth, &amp; the real motion of the earth round the sun.  
						In his garret he has another work, upon which he is yet occupied, &amp; which being his last labor seems to be that in which he takes the most delight. Upon a very large table similar to that in the first room, he has inlaid a number of thin plates of wood formed so as to represent a projection of the earth upon Mercator’s plan. All the intervals between the plates of wood designate that portion of the world, which is covered with water. He has used a number of very small ropes of different colours drawn over the surface in such a manner as to describe the tracks of all the celebrated circumnavigators of the globe. The colours of the ropes distinguish the several voyages from each other. To three of these great adventurers, who he thinks claim especial preeminence above the rest Columbus, Anson &amp; Cook, he has shewn a special honor by three little models of ships, bearing their names, which are placed upon the surface of his ocean, in some spot of their respective courses— The names of all the other voyagers, &amp; the times at which their voyages, were performed, are marked by papers fixed at the points of their departure. Such is the imperfect description I can give you from a short view of the labours of this really curious man— He must be nearly, or quite seventy years old, &amp; has all his life time been of an infirm constitution. But his taste for the sciences he told was hereditary in his family, &amp; had been common to them all, from his great grandfather down to himself. His dress &amp; appearance were those of a common weaver; but his countenance expressive at once of meditation &amp; ingenuity; his eyes at once full of enthusiastic fire, &amp; amiable good nature, was a model upon which Lavater might expatiate with exultation— He enquired who we were; &amp; was as much transported at the names of American, &amp; of Adams, as the magistrates of Freystadt— At these frequent &amp; spontaneous expressions of respect shewn to our name, I hope neither you nor I shall feel any improper pride; at least our filial affection may be allowed to rejoyce at them. The honest &amp; ingenious weaver, on our taking leave, made us smile by exclaiming, that now, if he could but have a traveller from Africa, come to see his works, he could boast of having had visitors from all the four quarters of the globe.

Bunzlau, 26th Fuly, 1800.  
  
Yesterday morning, early, we took our depar-  
ture from Freystadt, and came to this place; a  
distance of eight German miles; five of which  
are ina single stage from Sprotau here—The  
face of the country has visibly and greatly im-  
proved, as we came along; and although we still  
had to wade through several miles of sands, more  
or less deep,. we were frequently relieved by

wheat, rye, barley, oats, and especially flax, which  
appeared in a highly flourishing condition. As  
it happens to be just now the harvest time, we  
passed many groups of reapers; a sight, which  
would have afforded us more satisfaction, had  
we not known, that they were far from gathering  
the bounties of the season for themselves, and  
had they not, by frequently soliciting our charity,  
proved the wretchedness of their condition.— We  
had travelled through Saxony, a part of the  
March, anda corner of Bohemia, last year at this  
time; and then too had&#x27;met many a company of  
reapers.— We had seen several last week, as we  
came from Berlin ; but we had never beheld them  
-manybeg-—Since we entered Silesia, yesterday and  
:, the day before, certainly more than twenty times,

ecause the condition of the peasant in Silesia is  
  
uch worse, than in the electorate. For although  
  
mise ofgersonal servitude exists alike in both provinces,

e went over the catholic church, which  
joins upon the nunnery, and is alike dedicated to  
Mary Magdalen. Of the pictures hung round  
the church, and the altar pieces, those, which  
represent her, were alone-tolerable. There was  
an image, modelled upon the famous one of our  
lady at Loretto, which Buonaparte took the  
liberty of sending to Paris about four years  
ago.— The most remarkable thing I met in the  
church was a paper posted up, on the inner side  
of a confessional, written in Latin, and contain-  
ing a list of the sins to which the ordinary priest  
was forbidden to grant absolution, as being ex-  
pressly reserved for the consideration of the holy  
father himself.—I expected to have found at least  
some heinous crimes upon the ligt; but, unless  
the murder of a priest may be considered as of  
that denomination, there was not one.—The of-  
fences were—burying an heretic in holy ground  
—reading the books of the heretics, without a  
special license—refusing to pay tithes—and  
about a dozen others, all of the same stamp  
—all having some reference to the papal au-  
thority. Observe particularly, that the un-  
pardonable crime of reading heretical books is  
expressed in terms so vague and comprehensive,  
(libros hereticorum) that they may be construed  
by the priest to mean almost any books, he  
pleases.—And this paper is publicly posted, in a  
country, where the catholics themselves are but  
a tolerated sect, the subjects of a protestant  
sovereign. It is possible, indeed, that the re-  
straints of the Romish church upon its followers  
may be more rigorous and more public in such a  
country, than where its authority is unquestioned  
and uropposed.—Silesia was originally under  
the Austrian government, a catholic province ;  
at this time, shout one half of its inhabitants still  
adhere to that religion ; and although the steady  
maxims of the Prussian government, and still  
more the revolutions of time and opinions, have  
powerfully operated to introduce a spirit of mu-  
tual forbearance, if not harmony, there is per-  
haps no part of Europe, where the root of bitter-  
ness between the two parties is yet so deep, and  
cleaves with such stubbornness to the ground, as  
here. The catholics hate the protestants the  
more, for their having now the secure and un-  
limited liberty in their worship; and the protes-  
tants envy the catholics the privileges, they still  
retain, which the Prussian government has bound  
  
itself to preserve. Mr. Zoller, who has pub-  
  
lished his tour through Silesia, made in the year  
1771, and from whom I draw much of the infor-  
mation I give you, says, that it is common here  
for a catholic to exhibit, before a lutheran  
judge, a complaint against another catholic, for  
calling him a lutheran, and requiring satisfac-  
tion for what he considers as the blackest slander,  
that could be cast upon him. .  
  
About half way between Sprotau, and this  
place, we first came in sight of the mountains to-  
wards which we are travelling, and from which  
we are still about forty of our miles distant.  
  
Hirschberg, 27th Fuly, Sunday.  
  
Before I give you an account of our journey  
hither, I must say’samething of what we saw  
yesterday at Bunzlau; and which I had not time  
to tell you, before we continued our journey.) |  
  
The principal manufactory of Bunzlau, is in ©  
pottery ; particularly of those brown coffee-pots  
and milk-pots, of which you have seen many at!  
the inns of Berlin, and through the electorate.—  
Of these potters there are at Bunzlau nine, each)  
of whom employs six or eight workmen.——We,  
saw them make several large,pots, such as aré  
commonly used to hold bitter. . From a cubic  
mass of clay, about a foot thick, they form, in  
about five minutes, the pot, by merely moulding  
it with the hand, while it whirls round upon a  
sort of circular bench, placed before the Wwork-  
men. We could not, however, stay long to see  
them, for they work in the same room, where the  
  
ovens are heated to bake the pots, and®its ©  
  
warmth was to us intolerable.——Inthe yard of this”  
pottery; there is a pot of prodigiotis&#x27;size) ‘made ~  
about half a century ago, which contains nearly  
fifty bushels.—It is about twelve feet high; is  
hooped like a barrel, which it resembles in form,  
and is kept in a house built on ‘purpose for it—  
The Germans appear to have a partictlar predi-  
lection for things of enormous dimensions in® ~  
their kind; the tuns of Heidelberg, and KGnig-  
stein, and this pot, serve as examplés to shew  
how much size enters into their ideas of the sub-&quot;  
lime.  
  
But the greatest curiosities of Bunzlau, are  
two mechanical geniuses by the name of Jacob,  
and of Hiittig, a carpenter, and a weaver, who  
are next door neighbours to each other. ‘The  
first has made a machine, in which, by the means  
of certain clock-work, a number of puppets, about  
six inches high, are made to move upon a kind  
of stage, so as to represent in several successive  
scenes the passion of Jesus Christ.—The first  
exhibits him in the gard@n at prayer, while the  
three apostles are sleeping at a distance. In.  
the lasthe is shewn dead, in the sepulchre, guard  
ed by two Roman soldiers.—The intervening .  
scenes represent the treachery of Judas, the ex-  
amination of Jesus before Caiaphas, the dialogue  
between |Pijate andthe Jews, concerning him;  
the denial of Peter, the scourging and the cruci- »

lirge of music, and the maker, by way of expla-  
sation, repeats the passages of scripture, which  
relate the events he has undertaken to shew—l  
never saw a stronger proof how powerful the  
impression of objects, which are brought imme-  
diately home to the senses is—lI have heard and  
read more than one eloquent sermon upon the  
passion, but I confess, none of their most labour-  
ed efforts at the pathetic, ever touched my heart  
with one halfthe force of this puppet-show—The  
traitor’s kiss, the blow, struck by the high priest’s  
servant, the scourging, the nailing to the cross,  
the spunge of vinegar, every indignity offered,  
and every pain inflicted, occasioned a sensation,  
when thus made perceptible to the eye, which I  
  
had never felt at mere description.  
  
_ Hittig the weaver, with an equal, or superior  
mechanical genius, has applied it in a different  
manner, and devoted it to geographical, astro-  
nomical, and historical pursuits—lIn the intervals  
of his leisure from the common weaver’s work,  
which affords him subsistence, he has become a  
very learned man.—The walls of his rooms are  
covered with maps and drawings of his own, re-  
presenting, here, the course ofthe Oder, with all  
the towns and villages through which it runs;  
there the mountains of Switzerland, and those  
of Silesia, over both of which, he has travelled  
in person.—lIn one room, he has two very large  
tables, one raised above the other; on one of  
them he has, ranged all the towns and remarka-  
ble places of Germany, and, ©. the other, of all  
Europe; they are placed, according to their re-

The remarkable moun-  
tains are shewn by small pyramidical black  
stones, and little white pyramids are stationed at  
all the spots which have been distinguished by  
any great battle or other remarkable incident.—  
The man himself, in explaining his work, shews  
abundance of learning, relative to the ancient  
names of places, and the former inhabitants of  
the countries to which he points ; and amused us  
with anecdotes of various kinds, connected with

a projection of the earth upon Mercator’s plan.  
  
All the intervals between the plates of wood de-  
  
signate that portion of the world, which is covered  
  
with water. He has used a number of very small  
  
ropes of two colours, drawn over the surface in  
  
such a manner as to describe the tracks of all  
  
the celebrated circumnavigators of the globe.  
The colours of the ropes distinguish the seve-  
ral voyages from each other. ‘To three of these  
great adventurers, who he thinks claim especial  
preeminence above the rest, Columbus, Anson,  
and Cook, he has shewn a special honour by  
three little models of ships, bearing their names,  
which are placed upon the surface of his ocean,  
in some spot of their respective courses. ‘The  
names of allthe other voyagers, and the times at  
which their voyages were performed, are marked  
by papers fixed at the points of their departure.  
Such is the imperfect description I can give  
you from a short view of the labours of this  
really curious man. He must be nearly, or quite  
seventy years old, and has all his life time been  
of an infirm constitution. But this taste for the  
sciences he told us, was hereditary in his family,  
and had been common to them all, from his  
great-grandfather down to himself—His dress  
and appearance were those of acommon weaver ;  
but his countenance, expressive, at once, full of  
enthusiastic fire and of amiable good nature, was  
a model, upon which Lavater might expatiate  
withexultation. The honest and ingenious weaver,  
on our taking leave, made us smile by exclaim-  
ing, that now, if he could but have a traveller  
from Africa, come to see his works, he could  
boast of having had visitors from all the four  
quarters of the globe. Yours, &amp;c

of which are in a fingle ftage from Sprotau hither. The face of  
the country has vifibly and greatly improved as we came along; and  
although we {till had to wade through feveral miles of fands, more

fiage, fo as to reprefent in feveral fucceflive fcenes the paffion of  
Jetus Chrift. The firft exhibits him in the garden at prayer, while  
the three apoftles are fleeping at a diftance. In the latt he is fhown  
dead in the fepulchre, guarded by two Roman foldiers. The inter-  
vening fcenes reprefent the treachery of Judas, the examination of  
Jefus before Caiaphas, the dialogue between Pilate and the Jews  
concerning him, the denial of Peter, the fcourging, and the cruci-  
fixion. It is all accompanied by a mournful dirge of mufic ; and

which relate the events he has undertaken to fhow. I never fawa  
ttronger proof of the ftrength of the impreffion of objects, which are  
brought immediately home to the fenfes. I have heard and read

The weaver has applied his genius in a different manner,  
and devoted all his leifure to geographical, aftronomical, and  
hiftorical purfuits. The walls of his rooms are covered with  
maps and drawings of his own. On tables in one room, all the  
towns and remarkable places of Germany in particular, and of  
Europe in general, are ranged according to their refpective  
geographical bearings. Jn a fecond room he has a large ma-

“ Such,” fays Mr. Adams, ¢ is the imperfe@ defcription I can  
give you from a fhort view of the labours of this really curious man.  
He muft be nearly, or quite, feventy years old, and has all his life-time  
been ofan infirm confiitution: but his tafte for the f{ciences, he told  
us, was hereditary in his family, and had been common to them  
all, from his great grand-father down to himfelf. His drefs and  
appearance were thofe of a common weaver ; but his expreffive  
countenance, at once full of enthufiaftic fire and of amiable good-  
nature, was a model upon which Lavater might expatiate with exul-  
tation. The honeft and ingenious weaver, on our taking leave,  
made us {mile by exclaiming, that now, if he could but have a tra-  
veller from Africa come to fee his works, he could boatt of having  
had vifitors from all quarters of the globe.”

Jast he is shewn dead in the sepulchre, guarded by two Roman sol.  
diers. The intervening scenes represent the treachery of Judas, the  
examination of Jesus before Caiaphas, the dialogue between Pilate and  
the Jews concerning him, the denial of Peter, the squrging, and the  
erucifixion. It is all accompanted by a mournful ain of music ; and  
the maker, by way of explanation, repeats the passages of Scripture  
which rclate the events he has undertaken to shew. I never saw a  
stronger proof of the strength ofthe impression of objects, which are  
brought immediately home to the senses. I have heard and read  
more than one eloquent sermon upon the passion ; but I confess, none  
of their most laboured efforts at the pathetic ever touched my heart  
with one half the force of this puppet-show. The traitor’s kiss, the  
blow struck by the high priest’s servant, the scourging, the nailing  
to the cross, the spunge of vinegar, every indignity offered, and ever  
pain inflicted, occasioned a sensation, when thus made perceptible to  
the eye, which I had never felt at mere description.  
  
‘ Hiittig the weaver, with an equal, or superior mechanical ge-  
nius, has applied tt in a different manner, and devoted it to geographi-  
cal, astronomical and historical pursuits. In the intervals of his  
Jeisure from the common weaver’s work, which affords him subsist-  
ence, he has become a very learned man. ‘The walls of his rooms are  
covered with maps and drawings of his own, representing, here the  
course of the Oder, with all the towns and villages through which it  
runs; there the mountains of Switzerland, and those of Silesia, over  
both of which he has travelled in person, In one room he has two very  
large tables, one raised above the other ; on one of them he has ran-  
ged all the towns and remarkable places of Germany, and on the other,  
of all Europe; they are placed according to their respective geogra-  
phical bearings. - The names of the towns are written on a small  
square piece of paper, and fixed in a slit on the top of a peg, which  
is stuck into the table. ‘The remarkable mountains are shewn by  
small pyramidical black stones, and little white pyramids are stationed  
at all the spots which have been distinguished by any great battle or  
other remarkable incident. The man himself, in explaining his work,  
shews abundance of learning, relative to the ancient names of places,  
and the former inhabitants of the countries to which he points; and  
amused us with anecdotes of various kinds, connected with the lands  
he has marked out. Thus, in shewing us the Alps, he pointed to  
the spots over which the French army of reserve so lately passed, and  
where Bonaparte so fortunately escaped being taken by an Austrian  
officer ; and then he gave us a short comment of his own upon the  
character and extraordinary good fortune of the First Consul. Ina  
second room he has a large machine, representing the Copernican sys-  
tem of the universe: it is made in such a manner, as that the whole  
firmament of fixed stars moves round our solar system once i every  
twenty-four hours, and thus always exhibits the stars, in the exact  
position, relative to our earth, in which they really stand. Inter-  
nally, he has stationed all the planets which belong to our system,  
with their several satellites, and all the comets that have been ob-  
served wail the last three centuries. In a third room he, has

and which being his last labour, seems to be that in which he takes  
  
the most delight. Upon a very large table, similar to that in the,  
  
first room, he has inlaid a number of thin plates of wood, formed so  
a3 to represent a projection of the earth upon Mercator’s plan. All  
the intervals between the plates of wood designate that portion of the  
world which is covered with water. He has used a number of very  
small ropes of two colours, drawn over the surface in such a manner  
as to describe the tracks of all the celebrated circumnavigators of the  
  
lobe. The colours of the ropes distinguish the several voyages from  
each other. To three of these great adventurers, who he thinks  
claim especial pre-eminence above the rest, Columbus, Anson, and  
Cook, he has shewn a special honour by three little models of ships,  
bearing their names, which are placed upon the surface of his oceau,  
in some spot of their respective courses. ‘The names of all the other  
voyagers, and the times at which their voyages were performed, are  
marked by papers fixed at the points of their departure. Such is  
the imperfect description I can give you from a short view of the  
  
labours of this really curious man. He must be nearly, or quite  
seventy years old, and has all his lifetime been of an .infirm constitue  
tion. But this taste for the sciences, he told us, was hereditary in  
his family, and had been common to them all, from his great-grand-  
father down to himself. His dress and appearance were those of a  
common weaver: but his expressive countenance, at once full of  
enthusiastic fire and of amiable good. nature, was a model, upon which  
Lavater might expatiate with exultation. The honest and ingenious  
weaver, on our taking leave, made us smile by exclaiming, that now,  
if he could but have a traveller from Africa come to 3ee his works,  
  
he could boast of having had visitors from all the four quarters of the  
  
globe.’

Caiaphas, the dialogue between Pilate and the Jews concerning  
him, the denial of Peter, the fcourging, and thecrucifixion. It

relate the events he has undertaken to fhew. I never faw a  
ftronger proof of the flrength of the impreffion of objeéts,  
which are brought immediately home.to the fenfes. I have  
heard and read more than one eloquent fermon upon the paf-  
fion; but I confefs, none of their moft laboured efforts at the  
pathetic ever touched my heart with one half the force of this  
puppet-fhow. The traitor’s kifs, the blow flruck by the high

of vinegar, every indignity offered, and every pain infliGed, oc,  
cafioned a fenfation, when thus made perceptible to the eye,  
which I had never felt at mere defcriptign.  
  
Huttig the weaver, with an equal, or fuperjor mechanical ge-  
nius, has applied it in a different manner, and devoted it to geo-  
graphical, aftronomical, and hiltorical purfyits. Inthe intervals  
of his leifure from the common weaver’s work, which affords  
him fubfiftence, he has become a very learned man, The walls  
of his rooms are covered with maps and drawings of his own,  
reprefenting, here the courfe of the Oder, with all the towns  
and villages through which it runs; there the mountains of  
Switzerland, and thofe of Silefia, over both of which he has  
travelled in perfon. In one room he has two very large tables,  
one raifed above the other; on one of them he has ranged al]  
the towns and remarkable places of Germany, and, onthe other,  
of all Europe; they are placed according to their refpettive  
geographical bearings. ‘The names of the towns are written on  
a {mall fquare piece of paper, and fixed ina flit on the top of a  
peg, which is fluck into the table. The remarkable mountains  
are fhewn by fmall pyramidical black flones, and little white  
pyramids are ftationed at all the fpots which have been diftin-

guifhed by any great battle or other remarkable incident. The  
man bimfelf, in explaining his work, fhews abundance of learn.  
ing, relative to the ancient names of places, and the former in.  
habitants of the countries to which he points; and amufed us  
with anecdotes of various kinds, conneéted with the land he has  
marked out. Thus, in fhewing us the Alps, he pointed to the  
fpots over which the French army of referve fo lately paffed,  
and where Bonaparte fo fortunately efcaped being taken by an  
Auftrian officer; and then he gave us a fhort comment of his  
own upon the charaéter and extraordinary good fortune of the  
firtt conful.  
  
In a fecond room he has a Jarge machine, reprefenting the  
Copernican fyftem of the univerfe ; it is made in fuch a man-  
rier, as that the whoije firmament of fixed ftars moves round our  
folar fyflem once in every twenty-four hours, and thus always  
exhibits the ftars, in the exaét pofition, relative to our earth, in  
which they really fland. Internally, he has ftationed all the  
planets which belong to our fyftem, with their feveral fatel-  
lites, and all the comets that have been obferved during the laf  
three centuries,  
  
{n athird room he has another machine, exhibiting in diffe.  
rent parts the various phafes of the moon, and thofe of Jupiter’s  
fatellites, the apparent motion of the fun round the earth, and  
the real motion of the earth round the fun.  
  
In this garret he has another work, upon which he is yet oc-  
cupied, and which being his Jaft labour, feems to be that in which  
he takes the moft delight. Upon a very large table, fimilar to  
that in the firft room, he has inlaid a number of thin plates of  
wood, formed fo as to reprefent the proje&amp;tion of the earth upon  
Mercator’s plan. - All the intervals between the plates of wood  
defigmate that portion of the world which is covered with water.  
He has ufed a number of very {mall ropes of two colours,  
drawn over the furface in fuch a manner as to defcribe the tracks  
ot all the celebrated circumnavigators of the globe. The co-  
jours of thé ropes diftinguifh the feveral voyages from eac!  
other. To three of thele great adventurers, who he thinks  
claim efpecial pre-eminence above the reft, Columbus, Anfon,  
and Cook, he has fhewn a f{pecial hononr by three little models  
of thips, bearing their names, which are placed upon the furface  
of his ocean, in fome [pot of their refpeétive courfes. The  
names of all the other voyagers, and the times at which their  
voyages were performed, are marked by papers fixed at the  
point of their departure.  
  
Such is the imperfeét defcription I can give you from a fhort  
view of the labours of his really curious man. He mutt be  
nearly, or quite feventy years old, and has all his life-time been  
of an infirm conftitution. But this tafle for the {ciences, he told  
us, was hereditary ia his family, and had been common to them

ties of the season for themselves, and had they not, by frequently so-  
liciting our charity, proved the wretchedness of their condition. We  
travelled through Saxony, a part of the March, and a corner of Bo-~  
hemia, last year at this time, and then we also met many companie $  
of reapers ; we saw several last week as we came from Berlin, but we  
never before beheld them beg. Since we entered Silesia, yesterday and  
the day before, certainly more than twenty times, as’we pissed by  
troops of peasants of both sexes who were gathering the harvest, a  
woman from among them, and sometimes two or three, ran from the  
fields to our carriage with a little bunch of flowers tied up with some  
ears of the grain which they were gathering, and threw them into the  
carriage at the windows, by way of begging for a dreyer or half a  
groschin. The reason of this is, because the condition of the peasant in  
Silesia is much worse than in the Electorate. For although personal  
servitude exists alike in both provinces, yet the serf in the March is never  
compelled to labour for his lord, more days than there are. In Silesia  
he is often obliged to furnish ten days work in a week: judge then,  
after the man and his wife have both laboured five days in seven for  
the lord, what sort of a subsistence they can earn in the remaining two  
(one of which is a Sunday) for themselves.’ r. 28.

‘* Hiittig, the weaver, with an  
equal, .or fuperior mechanical  
genius, has applied it in a different  
manner, and devoted it to geogra-  
phical, aftronomical, and hiftori-  
cal purfuits. In the intervals of  
his leifure from the common  
weaver’s work, which affords him  
fubfittence, he has become a very  
learned man. The walls of his  
rooms are covered with maps and  
drawings of his own, reprefenting,  
here the courfe of the Oder, with  
all the towns and villages through  
which it runs; there the moun-  
tains of Switzerland, and thofe of  
Silefia, over both of which he has  
travelledin perfon. In one room  
he has two very large tables, one  
raifed above the other; on one of  
them he has ranged all the towns  
andremarkable places of Germany,  
and, on the other, of all Europe ;  
they are placed according to their  
refpective geographical bearings.  
The names of the towns are writ-  
ten ona {mall fquare piece of paper,  
and fixed in a flit on the top of a  
  
eg, which is ftuck into the table.  
  
he remarkable mountains are  
fhewn by fmall pyramidical black  
ftones, and little white pyramids  
are ftationed at all the fpots which  
have been diftinguifhed by any  
great battle or other remarkable  
incident. The man himfelf, in  
explaining his work, fhews abun-  
dance of learning relative to the  
ancient names of places and the  
  
. former inhabitants of the countries  
  
to which he points ; and amufed  
us with anecdotes of various kinds  
connected with the lands he has  
marked out. Thus, in thewing  
us the Alps, he pointed to the  
{pots over which the French army  
of referve fo lately paffed, and  
where Bonaparte {fo fortunately  
efcaped being taken by an Auttrian  
officer; and then he gave uj a  
fhort comment otf his own uponthe  
character and extraordinary good  
fortune of the Firft Conful. Ina  
fecond room he has a large ma-  
chine, reprefenting the Coperni-  
can fyftem of the univerfe: it is  
made in fuch a manner, as that  
the whoke firmament of fixed {tars  
moves round our folar fyftem once  
  
I  
  
‘Marcu  
  
in every twenty-four hours, and  
thus always exhibits the ftars in  
the exact polition, relative to our  
earth, in which they really ftand.  
Internally, he has ftationed all the  
planets which belong to our fyftem  
with their feveral fa ellites, and  
all the comets that have been ob-  
ferved during the lait three centu-  
ries. Inathird room he has another  
machine, exhibiting, in different  
parts, the various phafes of the  
moon, and thofe of Jupiter’s fa-  
tellites, the apparent motion ot  
the fun round the earth, and the  
real motion of the earth round the  
fun.  
  
‘¢In his garret he has another  
work, upon which he is yet occu-  
pied, and which, being his laft la-  
bour, feems to be that in which he  
takes the moft delight. Upona very  
large table, fimilar to that in the  
firft room, he has inlaid a number  
of thin plates of wood, formed fo  
as to reprefént a projection of the  
earth upon Mercator’s plan, All  
the intervals between the plates of  
wood defignate that portion of the  
world which is covered with water,  
He has ufed a number of very finall  
ropes of two colours, drawn over  
the furface in fuch a manner as to  
defcribe the tracks of all the ce-  
lebrated circumnavigators of the  
globe. The colours of the ropes  
diftinguith the feveral voyages from  
each other. To three of thefe  
great adventurers, who he thinks  
claim efpecial pre-eminence above  
the reft, Columbus, Anfon, and  
Cook, he has fhewn a fpecial ho-  
nour by three little models of thips,  
bearing their names, which are  
placed upon the furface of his  
ocean, in fome fpot of their re-  
{pective courfes. The names of  
all the other voyagers, and the  
tines at which their voyages were  
performed, are marked by papers  
fixed at the points of their depar-  
ture. Such is the imperfect de  
{cription 1 can give you from a  
fhort view of the labours of this  
really curious man. He muft be  
nearly, or quite feventy years old,  
and has all his life-time been of an  
infirm conttitution. But this tafte  
for the fciences, he told us, was  
hereditary in his family, and had  
been common to them all, from  
his great-grandfather down to hin

felf. His drefs and appearance  
were thofe of a common weaver ;  
but his expreflize countenance, at  
once full of enthufiaftic fire and of  
amiable good-nature, was a model  
upon which Lavater might expa-  
tiate with exultation. The honett  
and ingenious weaver, on our  
taking leave, made us fmile, by  
exclaiming, that now, if he could  
but have a traveller from Africa  
come to fee his works, he could  
buaft of having had vilitors from  
all the four quarters of the globe.”’
