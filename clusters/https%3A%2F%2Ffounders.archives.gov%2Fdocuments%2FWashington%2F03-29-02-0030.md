some measure for the endured losses and  
privations of every description. The claims |  
provided for by the present bill, on the  
other hand, are founded upon express con-  
tract between the then existing Govern-  
ment and the officers of the Army.  
original contract was, that those who had  
served until the spring of 1781, when the |  
reorganization of the Army under the res-  
olutions g? October, 1780, took place,  
should have half pay for life, and that those  
also who continued in the service to the  
end of the war, in addition to their full  
pay during such continuance, should be  
entitled to half pay during life, to com-  
mence from the time of their reduction.  
in 1783, owing to the unpopularity of this  
mode of payment—it appearing to create  
something like a privileged class—the con-  
tract was changed with the consent of par-  
ties. The half pay for life was commuted  
by a grant of five years’ full pay. This was  
accepted, not by officers individually, but  
by lines and corps not belonging to par-  
ticular States, by the officers of the hos-  
pital department, and by the retired offi-
