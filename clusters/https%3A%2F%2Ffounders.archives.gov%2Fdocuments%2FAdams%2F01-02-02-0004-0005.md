Rode to Fitch’s of Stamford, where we breakfasted. Rode to Havilands of Rye, the first Town in the Province of N. York. The Barber says that Religion dont flourish in this Town. The congregational Society have no Minister. The Church minister has 45£ from the Society. They have a School for Writing and Cyphering, but no Grammar School. There is no Law of this Province that requires a Minister or school Master.

f Westchester and the County of N. York. This Place is 10 Miles from Hell Gate, which is supposed to be occasioned by a large Cavern under the Rocks, into which the Water rushes at certain Times of the Tide. This Whirlpool is 5 Miles from the City.  
We breakfasted at Days, and arrived in the City of New York at 10 O Clock—at Hulls, a Tavern, the Sign the Bunch of Grapes. We rode by several very elegant Country Seats, before we came to the City.  
This City will be a Subject of much Speculation to me.  
From Hulls We went to private Lodgings at Mr. Tobias Stoutenberg’s, in Kings Street, very near the City Hall one way and the French Church the other. Mr. McDougal and Mr. Platt came to see us. Mr. Platt asked us to dinner next Monday. Mr. McDougal stayed longer, and talk’d a good deal. He is a very sensible Man, and an open one. He has none of the mean Cunning which disgraces so many of my Country men. He offers to wait on us this afternoon to see the City.  
After Dinner, Mr. McDougal and Mr. Platt came and walked with Us, to every Part of the City. First We went to the Fort where We saw the Ruins of that magnificent Building the Governors House. From the Parade before the Fort you have a fine Prospect of Hudsons River and of the East River or the Sound and of the Harbour—of Long Island, beyond the Sound River, and of New Jersey, beyond Hudsons River. The Walk round this Fort is very pleasant, tho the Fortifications are not strong. Between the Fort and the City is a beautifull Elipsis of Land, railed in with solid Iron, in the Center of which is a Statue of his Majesty on Horse back, very large, of solid Lead, gilded with Gold, standing on a Pedastal of Marble very high. We then walked up the broad Way, a fine Street, very wide, and in a right Line from one End to the other of the City. In this rout We saw the old Church, and the new Church. The new is a very magnificent Building—cost 20,000£ York Currency. The Prison is a large and an handsome stone building. There are two setts of Barracks. We saw the New York Colledge which is also a large Stone Building. A new Hospital is building of Stone. We then walked down to a ship Yard, where a Dutch East India Ship is building of 800 Tons burden. Then We walked round thro another Street which is the Principal Street of Business. Saw the several Marketts. After this We went to the Coffee House, which was full of Gentlemen, read the News Papers, &amp;c. Here were introduced to Us Mr. Morine John Morin Scott and a Mr. Litchfield, who invited us to Hulls Tavern, where we went and staid till 11 o Clock.

ough Knowledge of Politicks. The two great Families in this Province, upon whose Motions all their Politicks turn, are the Delanceys and Livingstones. There is Virtue and Abilities as well as fortune, in the Livingstones, but not much of either of the three in the Delanceys, according to him.  
The Streets of this Town are vastly more regular and elegant than those in Boston, and the Houses are more grand as well as neat.

ho they profess attachment to the American Cause.  
Mr. McDougal gave a Caution to avoid every Expression here, which looked like an Allusion to the last Appeal. He says there is a powerfull Party here, who are intimidated by Fears of a Civil War, and they have been induced to acquiesce by Assurances that there was no Danger, and that a peacefull Cessation of Commerce would effect Relief.  
Another Party he says are intimidated least the levelling Spirit of the New England Colonies should propagate itself into N. York.  
Another Party are prompted by Episcopalian Prejudices, against New England.  
Another Party are Merchants largely concerned in Navigation, and therefore afraid of Non Importation, Non Consumption and Non Exportation Agreements.  
Another Party are those who are looking up to Government for Favours.  
About 11 O Clock four of the Delegates for the City and County of N. York came to make their Compliments to us—Mr. Duane, Mr. Livingston, Mr. Low and Mr. Alsop. Mr. Livingston is a down right strait forward Man. Mr. Alsop is a soft sweet Man. Mr. Duane has a sly, surveying Eye, a little squint Eyed—between 40 and 45 I should guess—very sensible I think and very artfull.

With all the Opulence and Splendor of this City, there is very little good Breeding to be found. We have been treated with an assiduous Respect. But I have not seen one real Gentleman, one well bred Man since I came to Town. At their Entertainments there is no Conversation that is agreable. There is no Modesty—No Attention to one another.

of some of the observations. At Rye, the

master.” In the next paragraph we have an

Westchester and the county of New York.  
This place is ten miles from Hell Gate,  
which is supposed to be oceasioned by a  
large cavern under the rocks, into which the  
water rushes at certain times of the tide.  
This whirlpool is five miles from the city.”  
The Buneh of Grapes, a tavern at New York,  
receives them. “&#x27;This city,” writes Adams,  
“will be a subject of much speculation to  
me.” The first walk in the city touches  
upon some of the prominent glories of New  
York to this day :—  
  
NEW YORK IN 1774.  
  
“ After dinner, Mr. McDougall and Mr. Platt  
came, and walked with us to every part of the  
city. First we went to the fort, where we saw  
the ruins of that magnificent building, the Go-  
vernor’s house. From the Parade, before the  
fort, you have a fine prospect of Hudson River,  
and of the East River, or the Sound, and of the  
harbor; of Long Island, beyond the Sound  
River, and of New Jersey beyond Hudson’s  
River. ‘The walk round this fort is very plea-  
sant, though the fortifications are not strong.  
Between the fort and the eity is a beautiful  
ellipsis of land, railed in with solid iron, in the  
centre of which is ‘a statue of his majesty on  
horseback, very large, of solid lead gilded with  
gold, standing on a pedestal of marble, very  
high. We then walked up the Broad Way, a  
fine street, very wide, and in a right line from  
one end to the other of the city. In this route  
we saw the old church and the new church.  
The new is a very magnificent building, cost  
twenty thousand pounds, York currency. The  
prison is a large and a handsome stone building ;  
there are two sets of barracks. We saw the  
New York college, which is also a large stone  
building. A new hospital is building, of stone.  
We then walked down to a ship-yard, where a  
Dutch East India ship is building of eight hun-  
dred tons burthen. Then we walked round  
through another street, which is the principal  
street of business. Saw the several markets.  
After this we went to the coffee-house, which  
was full of gentlemen; read the newspapers,  
&amp;c. Here were introduced to us Mr, Morin  
Scott and a Mr. Litchfield, who invited us to  
Hull’s tavern, where we went and staid till  
eleven o&#x27;clock.”  
  
John Adams is then dined and feasted, re-  
cording Mr. Morin Seott’s “elegant break-  
fast—rich plate, a very large silver coffee-  
pot,a very large silver tea-pot, napkins of  
the very finest materials, toast, and bread  
and butter [a touch worthy of John Buncle

politely said he was exceedingly glad to have the pleas-

after the health of his brother and sister who are now  
in Boston; gave us some account of his late ill-health
