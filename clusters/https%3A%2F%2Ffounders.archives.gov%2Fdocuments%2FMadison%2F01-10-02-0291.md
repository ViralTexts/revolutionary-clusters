]  
The next view which I shall take of the house of representatives, relates to the apportionment of its members to the several states, which is to be determined by the same rule with that of direct taxes.  
It is not contended that the number of people in each state ought not to be the standard for regulating the proportion of those who are to represent the people of each state. The establishment of the same rule for the apportionment of taxes, will probably be as little contested; though the rule itself in this case, is by no means founded on the same principle. In the former case, the rule is understood to refer to the personal rights of the people, with which it has a natural and universal connection. In the latter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of which it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary cases, a very unfit one. But notwithstanding the imperfection of the rule as applied to the relative wealth and contributions of the states, it is evidently the least exceptionable among the practicable rules; and had too recently obtained the general sanction of America, not to have found a ready preference with the convention.  
All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said: But does it follow from an admission of numbers for the measure of representation, or of slaves combined with free citizens, as a ratio of taxation, that slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation? Slaves are considered as property, not as persons. They ought therefore to be comprehended in estimates of taxation which are founded on property, and to be excluded from representation which is regulated by a census of persons. This is the objection, as I understand it, stated in its full force. I shall be equally candid in stating the reasoning which may be offered on the opposite side.  
We subscribe to the doctrine, might one of our southern brethren observe, that representation relates more immediately to persons, and taxation more immediately to property, and we join in the application of this distinction to the case of our slaves. But we must deny the fact that slaves are considered merely as property, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of the case is, that they partake of both these qualities; being considered by our laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects, as property. In being compelled to labor not for himself, but for a master; in being vendible by one master to another master; and in being subject at all times to be restrained in his liberty, and chastised in his body, by the capricious will of another, the slave may appear to be degraded from the human rank, and classed with those irrational animals, which fall under the legal denomination of property. In being protected on the other hand in his life and in his limbs, against the violence of all others, even the master of his labour and his liberty; and in being punishable himself for all violence committed against others; the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a member of the society; not as a part of the irrational creation; as a moral person, not as a mere article of property. The federal constitution therefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our slaves, when it views them in the mixt character of persons and of property. This is in fact their true character. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under which they live; and it will not be denied that these are the proper criterion; because it is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property, that a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers; and it is admitted that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.  
This question may be placed in another light. It is agreed on all sides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as they are the only proper scale of representation. Would the Convention have been impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the slaves from the list of inhabitants when the shares of representation were to be calculated; and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of contributions was to be adjusted? Could it be reasonably expected that the southern states would concur in a system which considered their slaves in some degree as men, when burdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider them in the same light when advantages were to be conferred? Might not some surprize also be expressed that those who reproach the southern states with the barbarous policy of considering as property, a part of their human brethren, should themselves contend that the government to which all the states are to be parties, ought to consider this unfortunate race more compleatly in the unnatural light of property, than the very laws of which they complain?  
It may be replied perhaps that slaves are not included in the estimate of representatives in any of the states possessing them. They neither vote themselves, nor increase the votes of their masters. Upon what principle then ought they to be taken into the federal estimate of representation? In rejecting them altogether, the constitution would in this respect, have followed the very laws which have been appealed to, as the proper guide.  
This objection is repelled by a single observation. It is a fundamental principle of the proposed constitution, that as the aggregate number of representatives allotted to the several states is to be determined by a federal rule founded on the aggregate number of inhabitants, so the right of choosing this allotted number in each state is to be exercised by such part of the inhabitants, as the state itself may designate. The qualifications on which the right of suffrage depend, are not perhaps the same in any two states. In some of the states the difference is very material. In every state a certain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the constitution of the state, who will be included in the census by which the federal constitution apportions the representatives. In this point of view, the southern states might retort the complaint, by insisting, that the principle laid down by the convention required that no regard should be had to the policy of particular states towards their own inhabitants; and consequently, that the slaves as inhabitants should have been admitted into the census according to their full number, in like manner with other inhabitants, who by the policy of other states, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A rigorous adherence however, to this principle, is waved by those who would be gainers by it. All that they ask is, that equal moderation be shewn on the other side. Let the case of the slaves be considered, as it is in truth a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedient of the constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as inhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free inhabitants, which regards the slave as divested of two fifths of the man.  
After all, may not another ground be taken on which this article of the constitution will admit of a still more ready defence? We have hitherto proceeded on the idea that representation related to persons only, and not at all to property. But is it a just idea? Government is instituted no less for protection of the property, than of the persons of individuals. The one as well as the other, therefore, may be considered as represented by those who are charged with the government. Upon this principle it is, that in several of the states, and particularly in the state of New-York, one branch of the government is intended more especially to be the guardian of property, and is accordingly elected by that part of the society which is most interested in this object of government. In the federal constitution this policy does not prevail. The rights of property are committed into the same hands with the personal rights. Some attention ought therefore to be paid to property in the choice of those hands.  
For another reason the votes allowed in the federal legislature to the people

ne. If the law allows an opulent citizen but a single vote in the choice of his representative, the respect and consequence which he derives from his fortunate situation, very frequently guide the votes of others to the objects of his choice; and through this imperceptible channel the rights of property are conveyed into the public representation.

the patience of those who have politely attended to  
tho courso of ray remark*. The argument of Mr.  
Madison is adduced for tho sake of its own intrinsic  
strength, and not from any desire to create an extra­  
neous influoncc by the luatre of a name. “It is not  
contended,” e%ye Mr. Madison, “that the number of  
  
people m each Btato ought not to bo the standard for  
regulating the proportion of those who are to repre­  
sent tho peopie of each state. The establishment of  
the same rule for tho apportionm mu of taxes, will pro­  
bably be as little contested; though the rule itself, in  
Ibis case, is by no means founded on the samo princi­  
ple. In the former case, the rule is understood to ro&gt;  
ter to the personal rights of the people, with which it  
like a natural and universal connexion. In tho latter,  
it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of which  
it is in no caso a precise measure, and in ordinary ca­  
tOB.a very nndt one. But notwithstanding the im­  
perfection of the rule as applied to tho relative  
wealth and contributions of the states, it is evidently  
the least exceptionable among the practical rules; and  
h’ad too recently obtained the general sanction of  
America, not to have found a ready preference witli  
the Couvetition. All this is admitted, it will perhaps  
bo said; but does it follow from an admission of num­  
bers for the measure of representation, or of slaves  
armbinod with free citizens as a ratio of taxation,  
tukt slaves ought to bo included in the numerical  
Yule of representation? Slaves arc cons&#x27;d^rcd as pro­  
perty, not as persons- They ought, therefore, to he  
comprehended in estimates of taxation, which arc  
founded on property, and to be oxcludcd from repre­  
sentation, which is regulated by a census of persons.  
This is tho objection, as T understand it, stntcd inuts  
full force. I shall be equally candid in stating the  
reason which may be ottered on the opposite side.—  
Vve subscribe to the doctrine, might one of our south­  
ern brethren observe, that representation relates  
More immediately to persons, and taxation more im­  
mediately to property; and we join in the application  
of thin distinction to thcca-«e of our slaves. But we  
must deny the fact, that slaves are considered nj &#x27;relv  
as property, and in no respect whatever as persons.  
The true state of the c ase is, that they partake of  
both those qualities, being considered by o-ir laws, in  
stone respects as persons, and in otTicr respects as  
property- In being compelled to labour, uot for liim­  
stflf, but for a master; in being vendible bv one &lt;nns­  
fer to anuther master; and in being subject at all  
times to be restrained in his liberty? and chastised  
in his body, by the capricious will of another; the  
slave may appear to be degraded from the human  
rank, ana classed with those irrational animals which  
fall undfcr the legal denomination of property. In  
being protected, on the other hand, in his life and in  
hfs limbs, against tho violence of all others, even the  
master o. his labour and his liberty; and being pun­  
ishable himself for all violence committed against oth­  
grs; the slave is no less evidently regarded by the  
law as a nvmiber of the society, not as a part of the  
irrational creation; as n moral petson, net ns a more  
article of property. The federal constitution, there­  
fore, decides with great propriety on the case of our  
slaves, when it views them in tho mixed character of  
Persons and property. This is in fact, their true  
character. It is the character bestowed on  
them by the law’s under which they live: and it will  
nht be denied, that these arc the proper criterion, be­  
cause it is only under the pretext, that the laws have  
transformed the negroes into subjects of property,  
that a place is disputed them in the computation of  
numbers; and it is admitted, that if the laws were to  
^ rcHloro the rights which have been taken uwnv, the  
litTgroes could no longer be refused an equal share of  
  
representation with the other inhabitants. This  
question may bo placed in another light. Tt is agreed  
cm all suing, that numbers are tbc best scale of wealth  
and taxation, as they arc the only proper scale cf  
representation. Would the convention have been  
impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the slaves  
finraithe list of inhabitants, when the shares of rep­  
resentation were to be calculated; and inserted them I  
on tho lists when the tariff of contribution was to bo ;  
adjusted? Could it bo reasonably expected, than  
the southern states would concur in a system,  
Which considered their slaves in some degree  
as men, when burdens were to be imposed, ~ h it &#x27;  
refused to consider them in the same light, wlicu i  
advantages Were to be conferred? Might not som ■  
surprise be also expressed, that those who reproach  
tire southern states with the barbarous policy of con­  
sidering as property a part of their human brethren,  
tflioold themselves contend, that the government to  
which all the states are parties, ought to consider  
this Unfortunate race more completely in the unnatu­  
ral light of property, than the very lows of which  
* they complain? It may be replied perhaps, that  
slaves are not included in the estimate of represents­  
• fives in any of the states possessing them. Theynei-i  
ther vote themselves, nor increase the votes cf their j  
toasters. Upon what principle then, ougljt they to t  
bo taken into the federal estimate of representation? !  
In rejecting them altogether, the constitution would i  
in this respect, have followed tho very laws which &#x27;  
Iiave been appealed to as the proper guide. This oh* !  
jcction is repelled by a single observation. It is a  
fundamental principle of the pioposcd constitution, &#x27;  
that 8* tho aggregate number of representatives nPof- j  
ted to the several states is to ho determined bv a fedo- l  
ral rule founded on the aggregate number of inhabi- I  
taoUr, so the right of choosing this allotted number in 1  
«a»h state, is to be exercised by such part oftbe in­  
habitants as the state itself may designate. The j  
qualifications on which the right of suffrage depend J  
am not perhaps the same in any two states. In  
6bmc of tho states, the difference is very material. In  
every state, a certain proportion of inhabitant* nrc  
deprived of this right by the constitution of flic state, i  
who will be included in the census by which the fed­  
eral constitution apportions the representatives. In  
this point of view, tlio southern states miolit retort  
  
the complaint, by insisting, that the principle laid  
down by the convention required that no regard  
should be had to the policy of particular state&#x27;s to- ,

neous influence by the lustre of a name. &quot;It is not  
contended,” say3 Mr. Madison, &quot;that tho&#x27;number of  
people in each state ought not to bo the standard for  
rejfuloting tho proportion of those who are to repre­  
sent the pcopio of each state. The establishment of  
the same rule for the apportionment of luxes, will pro­  
bably be as little contested; though the rule itself, i&#x27;a  
this case, is by no means founded on the same princi­  
ple. In the former case, the rule is understood to re­  
fer to the personal rights of the people, with which it  
has a natural and universal connexion. In the latter,  
it has reference to tho proportion of wealth, of which  
it is in no case a precise measure, and in ordinary oa­  
ses, a very unfit one. But notwithstanding the im­  
perfection of the rule as applied to the relative  
wealth and contributions of tho states, it is evidentlv  
the least exceptionable among the practical rules; ami  
?mu t-&#x27;o recently obtained tbo general sanction of  
America, not to have found n ready preference with  
the Convention. AH this is admitted, it will perhaps  
be said; but does it follow from an admission of num­  
bers for tlie measure of representation, or of slaves  
combined with free citizens ag a ratio of taxation.  
  
tnat slaves ought to be included in the numerical  
rule of representation? Slave? arc considered as pro­  
perty, not as person-!. They ought, therefore, to be  
comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are  
founded on property, an*! to bc&#x27;uxcludcd from repre­  
sentation, which is regulated by n census of persons.  
This is the objection, an I understand it, stated iq its  
full force. I shall be equally candid in stating the  
reason which may he offered on the opposite side.—  
subscribe to-the doctrine, might one of our south­  
ern brethren observe, that representation relates  
more immediately to persons, and taxation more im­  
mediately to property; mid we join in the application  
of this distinction to the case of our slaves. Flut we  
must deny the fact, that slaves arc considered merely  
as properly, and in no respect whatever as persons.  
The true state of the case is, that, they partake of  
both those qualities; being considered by our laws, in  
some respects as persons, and in other respects ns  
property. In being compelled to labour, not for him­  
self, but for a muster; in being vendible by one mus­  
ter to another master; and in being subject at all  
fiiTine to be restrained in his liberty, and chastised  
iu his body, by tho capricious will of another; tho  
slave may appear to be degraded from the human  
rank, and classed with those irrational animals which  
All undfcr the legal denomination of property. In  
being protected, oil tUtf Vther hand, in his Jjfe  
his limbs, against the violence of all others, even the  
paster of huj labour and his liberty; and being pun­  
fshable nirasolf for all violence committed against oth­  
ers; tbo slave is no less evidently regarued by the  
law as a member of the society, not as a part of the  
irrational creation; as a moral person, not ns a raero  
article of property. The federal constitution, there­  
fore, decides with great propriety on the case of our  
slaves, when it views thorn in the mixed cbnr.acter of  
persons and property. This is in Act, their true  
&#x27;&#x27;ha ranter. It is the character bestowed on  
them by the laws under which they live; and it will  
not b- d-ne-d, that these are the proper criterion; be­

tre of a name. “It is not contended,” says Mr.  
Madison, &quot;that the number of people in each state  
ought not to be the standard Tor regulating the pro­  
portion of those who are to represent the people of  
each state. The establishment of the same rule  
for the apportionment of taxes, will probably be as  
little contested; though the rule itself, in this case,  
is by no means founded on the same principle, in  
the former case, the rule is understood to refer to  
the personal rights of the people, with which it

ter, it has reference to the proportion of wealth, of  
which it is in no case a precise measure, and in  
ordinary cases, a very unfit one. But, notwith­  
standing the imperfection of the rule as applied to  
the relative wealth and contributions of the states,  
It is evidently the least exceptionable among the  
practical rules; and had too recently obtained lire  
general sanction of America, not to have found  
a ready preference with the Convention. All this  
Is admitted, it will perhaps be sold; but docs it fol­  
low from an admission of numbers for the mea- j  
buro of representation, or of slaves combined  
with free citizens us a ratio of taxation, that slaves !  
ought to be included in the nuinet real rule of rep- i  
rcsentation? Slaves are considered as properly,&#x27;  
not as persons. They ought, therefore, to be com­  
nrehendedin estiinatesof taxation.^hich are found.&#x27;  
  
cd On property, and to be excluded from represcn  
ration, which is regulated by a census of persons.  
This is the objection,as I understand it, Mated in its

reason which may be ottered on the opposite side.  
We subscribe to the doctrine, might one of our

nore immediately to property; and we join in the  
application of this distinction to the case of our

considered merely as properly, and in no respect  
whatever as persons. The true state of the case  
is, that they partake of both (hose qualities, be­  
[i\g considered by our laws, in some respects as  
persons, and in other respects as property. In  
being compelled to labour, not for himself, but for  
a master; in beiDg vendible by one master to ano­  
ther master; and in being subject at a&#x27;.l times to be  
\strained in his liberty,‘and chastised in his body,  
by the capricious will of another; the slave may  
ppear to be degraded fioin tho human rank, and  
Classed with those irrational animals which fall  
••.nderthe legal denomination of property. In be­  
ing protected, on the other hand, in his life and in  
htslimbs, against the violence of all others, even  
the master of his labour and his liberty; and being  
punishable himself for all violeuce committed a­  
gainsl others; the slave Is no less evidently regard­  
ed by the law as a member of the society, not as  
a part of the irrational creation; as a moral person,  
not a* a mere article of property. The federal  
constitution, therefore, decides with great propri­  
ety on tho casoofour slaves, when it views them  
in tho mixed character of persons and property.  
This is,iu fact, their true character. It is the char­  
acter bestowed on them by the laws under which  
ihey live; and it will not be denied, that these aro  
the proper criterion; because it is only under the  
pretext, that the laws have transferred the ne­  
groes into subjects of property, that a place is di*.  
outed them in tho computation of numbers; and it  
: f admitted, that if tho laws were to restoru the  
tights which havo been taken away, the negroes  
i oufd no longer be refused an equal share of rep­  
mentation with (he other inhabitants. This ques­  
tion may be placed in another light. It is agreed  
on all sides, that numbers are the best scale of  
wealfh and taxation, as they are the only proper  
Male of representation. Would tho convention  
Ifltve be.en impartial or consistent, if they had re­  
j rated the Slaves IrorrHhe list of inhabitants, when  
(he shares of repreienta&#x27;ion were to bo calculated;  
and inserted them on the lists when the tariff of  
&lt; on tri tuition wastobe adjusted? Could it be rea­  
sonably expected, that the southern states would  
&lt;T,neur in a system, which considered their slaves  
a some degree a* men, when burdens were to  
ie impoiBd, but refused to consider them in the  
&lt; Jttie light, when advantages were to be confer­  
*eil? Might noisome surprise be also expressed,  
‘bat those who reproach the southern states witl  
*ha 15policy &lt; rrfls&#x27;de trg •*» r&gt;&#x27; ptr&#x27;y t  
  
pait of their ltun.au wteibrCD, sl.ouitl then.sim vs i  
contend, that the goverriineut to which all the &#x27;  
states are parties, ought to consider this unfortu­  
nate race more completely in the unnatural light &lt;  
of property, than tho very laws of which they  
complain? It may ie r&lt; plied, perhaps, that slaves  
are not included in the estimate of representatives  
in any of the Btates poosssiug them. They nei­  
ther vote thcmsolves, nor increase the vote# of  
their masters. Upon what principle then, ought  
they to be taken into the federal estimate of rop­  
: reservation? In rejecting them altogether, the  
1 constitution would, in this respect, have followed  
; tho very laws which have been appealed to as  
i the prefer guide. This objection is repelled by  
| a single observation. It is a fundamental princi­  
ple of the proposed constitution, that as the aggre­  
gate number of representativea allotted to the  
several states is to be determined by a federal  
rule founded oh the aggregate number of inhab  
itants; so the right of choosing this allotted num­  
ber in each state, is to be exercised by such part  
of the inhabitants as the state itself may designate.  
The qualifications ou which tho light of suffrage ,  
depend, are not perhaps the same in any two states.;  
In some of the states, the dilferenco is very t  
materia!. In every state, a certain proportion of!  
inhabitants are deprived of this right by the i  
constitution of the state, who will he included hi)  
the census by which tho federal constitution ap- »  
portions the representatives. In this point of  
view, the southern states might retort the com­  
plaint, by insisting, that the principle laid down by  
the convention required that no regard should be  
had to the policy ot particular states towards their  
own inhabitants; and consequently, that tho slaves,  
as inhabitants, should have been admitted into the  
census according to their full number.in like man­  
ner with other inhabitants, who, by tho policy o •  
other states,arc not admitted to all the rights oiciti&#x27;j  
zens. A rigorous adherence, however, to this |  
principle, is waived by those who would he gain­  
ers by it. All that they ask is, that equal modera­  
tion be Bhown on the other side. I.ct the case of  
the slaves ho considered, as it is in truth, a pecu­  
liar one. Let the compromising expedient of the  
Constitution be mutually adopted, which regards  
them as inhabitants, but as debased.by servitude,  
below tho equal level of free inhabitants, which  
regards the slave as divested of two-fifths  
of the mart. After all, may not another  
ground be taken, on which this article of the Con­  
stitution will admit of a still more ready defence?  
We have hitherto proceeded on (he idea, that re­  
presentation related to persons only, and not at all  
j to property. But is it a just Idea? Government is  
instituted no less for the protection of property,  
i than of the persons of individuals. The one, as  
’ well as the other, therefore, may bo considered as  
; represented liy those who are charged with the  
government. Upon this principle it is, that in se­  
veral of tho states, and particularly in the State of  
New York,on® branch ol the government is in­  
tended more especially to be tho guardian of pro­  
perty, and is accordingly elected by that part of1

those who reproach the southern States with the barbarous

the objection that slaves are not included in the estimate of

## [From _The Anti - Slavery Examiner (1836-1845)_](https://archive.org/details/sim_anti-slavery-examiner_1844_11/page/n65/mode/1up?view=theater)

property, and in no respect whatever as persons. The true state of  
the case is, that they partake of both these qualities, being considered  
by our laws, in some respects as persons, and in other respects as  
property.  
  
In being compelled to labor, not for himself, but for a master ; in  
being vendible by one master to another master ; and in being subject  
at all times to be restrained in his liberty and chastised in his body  
by the capricious will of another; the slave may appear to be de-  
graded from the human rank, and classed with those irrational ani-  
mals which fall under the legal denomination of property. In being  
protected, on the other hand, in his life, aud in his limbs, against the  
violence of all others, even the master of his labor and his liberty ;  
and in being punishable himself for all violence eommitted against  
others; the slave is no less evidently regarded by the law as a mem-  
ber of the society, not asa part of the irrational creation; as a  
iuoral person, not as a mere article of property. The Federal con-  
stitution, therefore, decides with great propriety on the case of our  
slaves, when it views them in the mixed character of persons and  
property. ‘This is in fact their true character. It is the character be-  
stowed on them by the laws under which they live, and it will not  
be denied, that these are the proper criterion; because it is only  
under the pretext, that the laws have transformed the negroes into  
subjects of property, that a place is disputed them in the computa-  
tion of numbers; and it is admitted, that if the laws were to restore  
the rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no longer be  
refused an equal share of representation with the other inhabitants.  
  
This question may be placed in another light. It is agreed on  
all sides, that numbers are the best scale of wealth and taxation, as  
they are the only proper scale of representation. Would the con-  
vention have been impartial or consistent, if they had rejected the  
slaves from the list of inhabitants, when the shares of representation  
were to be calculated ; and inserted them on the lists when the  
tariff of contributions was to be adjusted ?  
  
Could it be reasonably expected, that the Southern States would  
ccnucur in a system, which considered their slaves in some degree as  
men, When burdens were to be imposed, but refused to consider  
them in the same light, when advantages were to be conferred ?  
  
Might not some surprise also be expressed, that those who re-  
proach the Southern States with the barbarous policy of consider-  
ing as property a part of their human brethern, should themselves  
contend, that the government to which all the States are to be parties,  
ought to consider this unfortunate race more completely in the un-  
natural light of property, than the very laws of which they complain ?  
  
It may be replied, perhaps, that slaves are not included in the  
estimate of representatives in any of the States possessing them.  
They neither vote themselves, nor increase the votes of their masters.  
Upon what principle, then, ought they to be taken into the Federal  
estimate of representation ? In rejecting them altogether, the con-  
  
  
  
67  
  
stitution would, in this respect, have followed the very laws which  
have been appealed to as the proper guide.  
  
This objection is repelled by a single observation. It is a funda-  
mental principle of the proposed constitution, that as the aggregate  
number of representatives allotted to the several States is to be de-  
termined by a Federal rule, founded on the aggregate number of  
inhabitants; so, the right of choosing this allotted number in each  
State, is te be exercised by such part of the inhabitants, as the State  
itself may designate. The qualifications on which the right of suf-  
frage depends, are not perhaps the same in any two States. In some  
of the States the difference is very material. In every State, a cer-  
tain proportion of inhabitants are deprived of this right by the con-  
stitution of the State, who will be included in the census by which  
the Federal constitution apportions the representatives. In this  
point of view, the Southern States might retort the complaint, by  
insisting, that the principle laid down by the convention required  
that no regard should be had to the policy of particular States towards  
their own inhabitants ; and consequently, that the slaves, as inhabi-  
tants, should have been admitted into the census according to their  
full number, in like manner with other inhabitants, who, by the policy  
of other States, are not admitted to all the rights of citizens. A  
rigorous adherence, however, to this principle is waived by those  
who would be gainers by it. All that they ask, is that equal modera-  
tion be shown on the other side. Let the case of the slaves be consid-  
ered, as it is in truth,a peculiar one. Let the compromising expedi-  
ent of the constitution be mutually adopted, which regards them as  
inhabitants, but as debased by servitude below the equal level of free  
inhabitants, which regards the slave as divested of two-fifths of the  
man.

It would be a gross inequality to allow represen­  
tation for slaves to the southern States; for that,  
in effect, would be to allow to their masters a  
predominant right, founded on mere property.  
Thus, five thousand free persons, in a slave State,  
  
might possess the. same power to choose a Rep

slaves arc deemed persons as well as property.

&quot; The next view which I shall take of the  
House of Representatives, relates to the appor­  
tionment of its members to the several States,  
which is to be determined by the same rule  
with that of direct taxes.  
&quot; It is not contended that the number of peo­  
ple iu each State ought to be the standard for  
regulating the proportion of those who are to  
represent the people of each State. The estab­  
lishment of the same rule for the apportion­  
ment of taxes, will probably be as little con­  
tested ; though the rule itself, iu this case, w  
by no means founded on the same principle.  
In the former case the rule is understood to re­  
fer to the personal rights of the people, with  
which it has a natural and universal connection.  
In the latter it has reference to the proportion  
of wealth, of which it is in no case a precise  
measure, and in ordinary cases a verv unfit one.  
But notwithstanding the imperfection of the  
rule as applied to the relative wealth and con­  
tributions of the States, it is evidently the least  
exceptionable among the practical rules, aud  
had too recently obtained the general sanction  
of America, not to have found a ready prefer­

that formed the Constitution.]  
  
&quot;All this is admitted, it will perhaps be said;  
but does it follow from an admission of num­  
bers for the measure of representation, or of  
slaves combined with free citizens, as a ratio  
of taxation, that slaves ought to be included  
in the numerical rule of representation? Slaves  
are considered as property, not as persons.  
They ought, therefore, to be comprehended in  
estimates of taxation which are founded on  
property, and to be excluded from representa­  
tion, which is regulated by a census of pernors.  
This is the objection, as 1 understand it, stated  
in its full force. I shall be equally candid in  
stating the reasoning which may be offered on  
the opposite side.  
&quot;We subscribe to the doctrine (might one of  
our southern brethren observe) that represen­  
tation relates more immediately to persons, and  
taxation more immediately to property; and  
we join in the application of this distinction in  
the case of our slaves. But we must deny  
that our slaves are considered merely as prop­  
erty, and in no respect whatever as persons.  
The true state of the case is that tbey partake  
of both these qnalities; being considered by  
our laws, in some respects as persons, and in  
other respects as property. In being compel­  
led to labor, not for himself, bnt for a master;  
in being vendible by one master to another;  
the slave may appear to be degraded from the  
human rank, and classed with those irrational  
animals which fall under the legal denomina­  
tion of property. On the other hand, in being  
protected, in his life and in his limbs, against  
the violence of all others, even the master of  
his labor and his liberty ; and being punisha­  
ble himself for all violence committed against  
others, the slave is no less evidently regarded  
bj the luw as a member of society, not as a  
part of the irrational creation?as a moral  
person, not as a mere article of property. The  
Federal Constitution, therefore, decides WITH  
GREAT PROPRIETY on the case of our  
slaves, when it considers them in the mixt  
character of persons and property.&quot;  
Mr. Madison continues his examination of  
the same subject in three successive chapters  
of &quot;The Federalist,&quot; but we have quoted suffi­  
ciently for our pnrposes. The question or  
admitting into the constitution the clause we  
have quoted, turned upon the very point that  
was at issue in the Revolutionary struggle. Our  
forefathers contended that taxation and repre­  
sentation should go together. In the conven­  
tion the North said that slaves being held na  
property, must be liable to taxation for th

2. The second of the provisions in the Constitution in regard to  
the relation of the General Government to slavery, to which I  
have referred, is that by which fugitives from slavery are to be  
restored to their. masters. The article in itself, as originally  
adopted, and as it stands in the Constitution, is merely that “ No  
person held to service or labor in one State under the laws there-  
of, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regu-  
  
* “Tt is only under the pretext that the laws have transformed the negroes into sub-  
jects of property, that a place is assigned them in the computation of numbers; and it  
is admitted, that if the laws were to restore the rights which have been taken away, the  
negroes could no longer be refused an equal share of representation with the other in-  
habitants.”—Mr. Madison in the Federalist, No. LIV.  
  
+ “In settling the ratio of representation, another difficulty arose respecting the  
slaves, who form so large a portion of the inhabitants of some of the States. To com-  
pute them among the number represented, would be giving them an importance to  
which their character did not entitle them; . . . . to omit them altogether in the com-

“ The Federal Constitution, therefore, decides with  
great propriety on the case of our slaves, when it  
views them in the mixed character of persons and of  
property. This is, in fact, their true character. It is  
the character bestowed on them by the laws under  
which they live; and it will not be denied that these

slaves be considered, as it is in truth, a peculiar one.  
Let the compromising expedient of the Constitation

this was the province bf the state alone, and that  
the imposition of any sort of conditions upon the

&quot;The qualifications on which the right of suf­  
frage depends, are not perhaps the came in any  
two states. In some of the states the difference  
is verv material. In every state, a certain pro  
portion ot inhabitants are deprived ot this rignt  
by the constitution ot the state, who wiil ne in­  
cluded in the census by which the federal con  
stitution apportions the representatives. In this  
point of view, the southern states might retort  
the complaint by insisting, that the principle  
laid down by the convention required that no  
regard should be had to the policy of particular  
spates towards their own inhabitants ; and con­  
sequently that the slaves, as inhabitants, should  
have been admitted into the census according  
to their full number, in like manner with other  
inhabitants, who, by the policy of other states,  
are not admitted toaIl the rights of citizens.

it was held at the adoption of the Constitution that  
Congress should have the power to prevent any State,  
under the pretense of regulating the suffrage, from de  
priving the people of this right, or from interfering with  
the principles of equality. Kindred to this statement of  
Mr. Madison is that contemporary testimony which will  
be found in the Federalist, where the irrepealable right  
of citizens recognized without distinction of color.  
This explicit language cannot be too orten quoted.  
It is only under the pretext that the laws have  
transferred the negroes into subjects of property that a  
place is disputed them in the computation of members,  
and it is admitted that if the laws were to restore the  
rights which have been taken away, the negroes could no  
longer be refused an equal representation with the other  
inhabitants. The Federalist, No. 54) This  
testimony is as decisive as it is authentic. Cone­  
that it was given in explanation  
and indication of the Constitution, consider that the Cone  
stitution was commended for adoption by the assertion  
that on the termination of slavery the negroes could ne  
longer be refused an equal share of representation with  
the other inhabitants. In the face of this assurance, how  
can it be now insisted that under the simple power
