[5 May 1789]  
The address of the House of Representatives to George Washington, President of the United States.  
Sir,  
  
The Representatives of the People of the United States present their congratulations on the event by which your fellow-citizens have attested the pre-eminence of your merit. You have long held the first place in their esteem: you have often received tokens of their affection. You now possess the only proof that remained of their gratitude for your services, of their reverence for your wisdom, and of their confidence in your virtues. You enjoy the highest, because the truest honor, of being the first Magistrate, by the unanimous choice, of the freest people on the face of the Earth.  
  
We well know the anxieties with which you must have obeyed a summons from the repose reserved for your declining years, into public scenes, of which you had taken your leave forever. But the obedience was due to the occasion. It is already applauded by the universal joy which welcomes you to your station. And we cannot doubt that it will be rewarded with all the satisfaction, with which an ardent love for your fellow-citizens must review successful efforts to promote their happiness.  
This anticipation is not justified merely by the past experience of your signal services. It is particularly suggested by the pious impressions under which you commence your administration, and the enlightened maxims by which you mean to conduct it. We feel with you the strongest Obligations to adore the invisible hand which has led the American people through so many difficulties, to cherish a conscious responsibility for the destiny of Republican liberty, and to seek the only sure means of preserving and recommending the precious deposit, in a system of legislation, founded on the principles of an honest policy, and directed by the spirit of a diffusive patriotism.  
The question arising out of the fifth article of the Constitution, will receive all the attention demanded by its importance; and will, we trust be decided, under the influence of all the considerations to which you allude.  
In forming the pecuniary provision for the Executive department, we shall not lose sight of a wish resulting from motives which give it a peculiar claim to our regard. Your resolution, in a moment critical to the liberties of your Country, to renounce all personal emolument, was among the many presages of your patriotic services, which have been amply fulfilled; and your scrupulous adherence now to the law then imposed on yourself, cannot fail to demonstrate the purity, whilst it increases the lustre, of a character, which has so many titles to admiration.  
Such are the sentiments which we have thought fit to address to you. They flow from our own hearts; and we verily believe that among the millions we represent, there is not a virtuous citizen whose heart will disown them.  
All that remains is that we join in your fervent supplication for the blessings of Heaven on our Country; and that we add our own for the choicest of these blessings on the most beloved of her citizens.

3 1 6,  
THE Representatives of the peo­  
ple of the United States, pre­  
{ent their congratulations on the event  
by which your fellow-citizens have at~  
tested the pre-eminence of yoar merit.  
You have long held the firft place in  
their esteem——you have often receiv­  
ed tokens of their affe&amp;tion—you now  
poflefs the only proof that remained  
of their gratitude for your fervice—of  
their reverence for your wisdom-—and  
of their confidence in your virtues.  
You enjoy the highest, because the  
truest honour, of being the firft magis­  
trate, by the unanimous choice of the  
freeit people on the face of the earth.  
We well know the anxieties with  
which you must have obeyed a sum­  
mons, from the repose reserved for  
your declining years,into public scenes  
of which you had taken your leave  
forever—~Dßut the obedience was due  
to the occasion. It is already applaud­  
ed by the universal joy, which wel­  
comes you to your station, and we can­  
not doubt that 1t will be rewardedwith  
all the fatisfaltion, with which an ar­  
dent love for your fellow-citizens must  
review fuccefsful efforts to promote  
their happiness,  
This anticipation is not juftified  
merely by the past experience of your  
signal services. It is particularly sug­  
gested by the pious impreflions under  
which you commence your administra­  
tion, and the enlightened maxims by  
which you mean to condu&amp; it. We  
feel with you the strongest obligations  
to adore the invisible hand which has  
led the American people through so  
many difficulties, to cherith a consci­  
ous responsibility for the destiny of  
republican liberty, and to seek the  
only sure means of preserving and re­  
commending the precious deposit in  
a system of legislation, founded on the  
principles of an honest policy, and di­  
retted by the spirit of a diffufive patri­  
oti{m.  
The aueftion arising out of the  
fifth article of the Constitution, will  
receive all the atiention demanded  
by its importance, and will, we trust,  
be decided under the influence of  
all the considerations to which you  
allude.  
In forming the pecuniary provifons  
for the executive department, we shall  
not lose fight of a wish resulting from  
motives which give it a peculiar claim  
to our regard.~Your resolution in a  
moment critical to the liberties of  
your country, to renounce all personal  
emolument, was among the many

presages of your patriotic services,  
which have been amply folfilled, and  
vour {crupulous adherence now to the  
law then imposed on yourfelf, cannot  
fail to demonfirate the purity, whilst  
it increases the luftre of a charaer,  
which has so many titles to admira­

Such are the sentiments which we  
have thought fit to address to you :  
They flow from our own hearts, and  
we verily believe, that among the  
millions we represent, there is not a  
virtuous citizen whose heart will dis­  
own them.  
All that remains is, that we join in  
your fervent supplication for the bles­  
sings of he :ven on our country ; and  
that we add our own for the choicest  
of those bleflings on the mo#t beloved
