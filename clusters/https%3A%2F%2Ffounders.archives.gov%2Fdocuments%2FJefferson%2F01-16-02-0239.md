. The House was very full at four, and a little after Mr. Pitt appeared at the Bar of the House and delivered a message from the King, the anylisis of which was; that his Majesty had received information of two english vessels having been captured at Nootka sound, on the northwestern coast of America, by two Spanish Ships of war: that the cargo of the vessels had been seiz’d and their Crews sent prisoners to a Spanish  port. The taking of one of these Vessels had before been notified by the Spanish ambassador, who at the same time desired that measures might be taken for preventing british subjects frequenting those coasts, which had been previously occupied by the subjects of Spain. Complaints were also made of the fisheries carried on by british Subjects, in the seas adjoining to the spanish continent, as being contrary to the rights of the crown of Spain: In consequence of this communication, a demand was immediately made, by order of the english court, for adequate satisfaction, and for restitution. of the Ships, previous to any other discussion. By the Spanish answer it appears that these Vessels with their crews had been set at liberty by the viceroy of mexico, but this on the supposition that nothing but the ignorance of the rights of Spain had induced the people of other Nations to come to those coasts, for the purpose of making establishments for carrying on Trade &amp;c. No satisfaction was made or offered, and a direct claim was asserted by the court of Spain, to the exclusive right of sovereignty and commerece in that part of the world; that his majesty had directed his minister at Madrid, to make a fresh representation on this subject and to claim such full and adequate satisfaction as the case requires; and that his majesty having also received information that considerable armaments are carrying on in Spain, has given orders to make such preparations as may put in his majestys power to act with vigour and effect in support of the honor of his crown: and his majesty recommends it to his commons, on whose zeal he has much reliance, to enable him to take such measures, and to make such augmentation of his forces as may be necessary for this Purpose.

The memorial states, very minutely, other  
wrongs and indignities, of which the above,  
however, is the greatest. On the 25th of  
May, 1790, the King sent a Message to both  
Houses of Parliament, in which he states  
that he “ has received information that two  
vessels, belonging to his Majesty’s subjects,  
&amp;,c., had been captured at Nootka Sound, by  
an officer commanding two Spanish ships of  
war; that their cargoes had been seized, and  
their officers and crews sent as prisoners of  
war to a Spanish port.” Not one word is  
contained in the message about pulling down  
the British flag and hoisting the standard of  
Spain, or taking possession of the lands and  
the houses fortified by the three-pounder; but  
it goes on to say, no satisfaction is made or  
offered, (for the capture,) and “ a direct  
claim is asserted by the Court of Spain to the  
exclusive rights of sovereigntyj navigation^  
and commerce^ in the territories^ coastSy and  
seaSy in that part of the world.”

When the news arrived in England of the seizure of the vessels by Mar-  
tinez, the British government claimed the right of having indemnification  
made to their owners ; it determined to recognize any settlement that had  
been made, and it expressed its intention to make settlements on the west  
coast of America. On the 5th of May, 1790, a message of the Crown was  
delivered to Parliament, complaining ‘‘ that no satisfaction was made or of-  
fered for the acts of seizure, and that a direct claim was asserted by the  
Court of Spain to the exclusive rights of sovereignty, navigation, and com-  
merce, in the territories, coasts, and seas in that part of the world.” The  
message was received by Parliament with much approbation, and the ne-  
cessary supplies were very liberally granted to enforce the claims made.  
  
In the Lclentios of Spain, dated Aranjuez, June 4, 1790, signed by the  
Conde de Florida Blanca, it is said that, “ although Spain may not have es-  
tablishments or colonies planted upon the coast or in the ports in dispute, i
