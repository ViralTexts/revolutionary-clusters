pon a different principle entirely from any that takes place in the case of America. It is founded on the consent and compact of the Irish by Poyning’s law to be so governed, if it has any foundation at all: and this consent was given and compact made in consequence of a conquest.  
In the reign of Henry 2d of England, there were five distinct sovereignties in Ireland, Munster, Leinster, Meath, Ulster and Connaught, besides several small tribes. As the prince of any one of these petty states took the lead in war, he seemed to act, for the time being, as monarch of the island. About the year 1172 Rodoric O’Connor, king of Connaught, was advanced to this preeminence. Henry, had long cast a wishful eye upon Ireland, and now partly to divert his subjects from the thoughts of Becket’s murder, partly to appease the wrath of the Pope for the same event, and partly to gratify his own ambition, he lays hold of a pretence, that the Irish had taken some natives of England and sold them for slaves, applies to the Pope for license to invade that island. Adrian the 3d, an Englishman by birth, who was then pontiff, and very clearly convinced in his own mind of his right to dispose of kingdoms and empires, was eas

verted to christianity had never acknowledged any subjection to the see of Rome. He issued a bull, premising that Henry had ever shewn an anxious care to enlarge the church, and increase the saints on earth and in Heaven, that his design upon Ireland proceeded from the same pious motives: that his application to the holy see, was a sure earnest of success: that it was a point incontestible, that all christian kingdoms belonged to the patrimony of St. Peter; that it was his duty to sow among them the seeds of the gospel, which might fructify to their eternal salvation; he exhorts Henry to invade Ireland, exterminate the vices of the natives, and oblige them to pay yearly from every house, a penny to the see of Rome: gives him full right and entire authority over the whole island, and commands all to obey him as their sovereign.

s. Ireland had now been annexed to the English crown many years, yet parliament was not allowed to have obtained any jurisdiction over it, and Henry ordained laws for it by his sole and absolute authority, as Ed. I did by the statute of Wales. Another incontestible proof, that annexing a country to the crown of England, does not annex it to the realm, or subject it to parliament. But we shall find innumerable proofs of this.  
Another incontestable proof of this, is the ordinatio pro statu Hiberniae made 17 Ed. I, 1288.  
This is an ordinance made by the king, by advice of his council, for the government of Ireland. “Edward, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, &amp;c. to all those who shall see or hear these letters, doth send salutation.” He then goes on and orda

. This is no more than a concession of the king to his lords and commons of England, in these words “item it is accorded that all the merchants as well aliens as denizens, may come into Ireland, with their merchandizes, and from thence freely to return, with their merchandizes and victuals, without fine or ransom to be taken of them, saving always to the king, his ancient customs and other duties.” And by chapter 18. “Item, that the people of England, as well religious as other, which have their heritage and possessions in Ireland, may bring their corn, beasts and victuals to the said land of Ireland, and from thence to re-carry their goods and merchandizes into England freely, without impeachment, paying their customs and their devoirs to the king.”  
All this is no more than an argument between the king and his English subjects, lords and commons, that there should be a free trade between the two islands, and that one of them should be free for strangers. But is no colour of proof that the king could not govern Ireland

John, in the twelfth year of his reign, after the conquest, went into Ireland, carried over with him many able sages of the law; and there by his letters patent, in right of the dominion of conquest, is said to have ordained and established, that Ireland should be governed by the laws of England: which letters patent Sir Edward Coke apprehends to have been there confirmed in parliament.” “By the same rule that no laws made in England, between king John’s time and Poyning’s law, were then binding in Ireland, it follows that no acts of the English parliament, made since the tenth of Henry 7th, do now bind the people of Ireland, unless specially named or included under general words. And on the other hand it is equally clear, that where Ireland is particularly named, or is included under general words, they are bound by such acts of parliament; for it follows from the very nature and constitution of a dependent state: dependence being very little else, but an obligation to conform to the will or law of that superior person or state, upon which the inferior depends. The original and true ground of this superiority in the present case, is what we usually call, tho’ somewhat improperly, the right of conquest: a right allowed by the law of nations, if not by that of nature; but which in reason and civil policy can mean nothing more, than that, in order to put an end to hostilities, a compact is either expressly or tacitly made between the conqueror and conquered, that if they will acknowledge the victor for their master, he will treat them for the future as subjects, and not as enemies.”  
These are the principles upon which the dependence and subordination of Ireland are founded. Whether they are just or not, is not necessary for us to enquire. The Iri

The French Canadians, therefore, became “ subjects of the

other, which were not even interrupted by the invasion of the Danes, in  
the ninth century. The latter, in no very great space of time, became  
masters of the greater part of the coasts of the island, and occupied the  
ports of Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, and Cork, when the island was in-  
vaded, towards the close of the twelfth century, by Henry II. and annexed  
to the English crown, which event is thus summarily narrated by  
Hume :—  
  
“ Besides many small tribes, there were, in the age of Henry IL., five  
principal sovereignties in the island: Munster, Leinster, Meath, Ulster, and  
Connaught ; and as it had been usual for one or the other of these to take  
the lead in their wars, there was commonly some prince who seemed, for  
the time being, to act as monarch of [reland. Roderic O’Connor, king of  
Connaught, was then advanced to this dignity; but his government, ill  
obeyed even within his own territory, could not unite the people in any  
measures either for the establishment of order, or defence against foreign-  
ers. ‘The ambition of Henry had, very early in his reign, been moved by  
the prospect of these advantages to attempt the subjugation of Ireland ;

and a pretence was not wanting to invade a people who, being always  
confined to their own island, had never given any reason of complaint to  
any of their neighbors. For this reason he had recourse to Rome, which  
assumed a right to dispose of kingdoms and empires ; and not foreseein

of Rome. Adrian, therefore, inthe year 1156, issued a bull in favor of  
Henry, in which, afier premising that this prince had ever shown an anx-  
ious care to enlarge the church of God on earth, and to increase the num-  
ber of his saints and elect in heaven, he represents his design of subduing  
Ireland as derived from the same pious motives ; he considers his care of  
previously applying for the apostolic sanction as a sure earnest of success  
and victory ; and having established it as a point incontestible, that all  
Christian kingdoms belong to the patrimony of St. Peter, he acknowledges  
it to be his own duty to sow among them the seeds of the gospel, which  
might in the last day fructify to their eternal salvation ; he exhorts the king  
to invade Ireland, in order to extirpate the vice and wickedness of the na-  
tives, and oblige them to pay yearly, from every house, a penny to the See
