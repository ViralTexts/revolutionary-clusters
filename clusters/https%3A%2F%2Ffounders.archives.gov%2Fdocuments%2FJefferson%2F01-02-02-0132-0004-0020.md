Be it enacted by the General Assembly, that henceforth when any person having title to any real estate of inheritance, shall die intestate as to such estate, it shall descend and pass in parcenery to his kindred male and female in the following course: that is to say:  
To his children or their descendants, if any there be:  
  
If there be no children, nor their descendants, then to his father:  
If there be no father, then to his mother, brothers and sisters and their descendants, or such of them as there be:  
If there be no mother, nor brother, nor sister, nor their descendants, then the inheritance shall be divided into two moieties, one of which shall go to the paternal, the other to the maternal kindred, in the following course, that is to say:  
First to the grandfather.  
If there be no grandfather, then to the grandmother, uncles and aunts on the same side, and their descendants, or such of them as there be:  
If there be no grandmother, uncle nor aunt, nor their descendants, then to the great-grandfathers, or great-grandfather if there be but one:  
If there be no great grandfather, then to the great-grandmothers, or great-grandmother if there be but one, and the brothers and sisters of the grandfathers and grandmothers, and their descendants, or such of them as there be:  
And so on in other cases without end; passing to the nearest lineal male ancestors; and for the want of them to the lineal female ancestors in the same degree, and the descendants of such, male and female lineal ancestors, or to such of them as there be.  
But no right in the inheritance shall accrue to any persons whatever, other than to children of the intestate, unless they be in being and capable in law to take as heirs at the time of the intestates death.  
And where for want of issue of the intestate, and of father, mother, brothers and sisters and their descendants, the inheritance is before directed to go by moieties to the paternal and maternal kindred, if there should be no such kindred on the one part, the whole shall go to the other part: And if there be no kindred either on the one part or the other, the whole shall go to the wife or husband of the intestate. And if the wife or husband be dead, it shall go to her or his kindred, in the like course as if such wife or husband had survived the intestate and then died, entitled to the estate.  
And in the cases before-mentioned where the inheritance is directed to pass to the ascending and collateral kindred of the intestate, if part of such collaterals be of the whole blood to the intestate, and other part of the half blood only, those of the half blood shall inherit only half so much as those of the whole blood: But if all be of the half blood, they shall have whole portions, only giving to the ascendants (if there be any) double portions.  
And where the children of the intestate, or his mother, brothers, and sisters, or his grandmother, uncles, and aunts, or any of his   female lineal ancestors living, with the children of his deceased lineal ancestors male and female in the same degree come into the partition, they shall take per capita, that is to say, by persons; and where a part of them being dead, and a part living, the issue of those dead have right to partition, such issue shall take per stirpes or by stocks, that is to say, the share of their deceased parent.  
And where any of the children of the intestate, or their issue, shall have received from the intestate in his life time any real estate by way of advancement, and shall chuse to come into partition with the other parceners, such advancement shall be brought into hotchpot with the estate descended.  
In making title by descent it shall be no bar to a demandant that any ancestor through whom he derives his descent from the intestate, is or hath been an alien. Bastards also shall be capable of inheriting or of transmitting inheritance on the part of their mother, in like manner as if they had been lawfully begotten of such mother.  
Where a man having by a woman one or more children, shall afterwards intermarry with such woman, such child or children if recognized by him shall be thereby legitimated. The issue also of marriages deemed null in law shall nevertheless be legitimate.

the surviving parent, and the other to the brothers and sisters of the

scendants of his great-grandfather and great-grandmother on  
his mother’s side? We are of opinion that it must. This  
opinion is based upon the construction of the fourth subdi-  
vision of section 2 of the act “to regulate the descent and  
distribution of intestate’s estates,” (Paschal’s Dig., art. 3419,)  
in connection with other parts of that law, and of other pre-  
vious laws, of which that one is an amendment and revision.  
  
Said act, in the event there is no wife, children, father,  
mother, brothers, sisters, or the descendants of either of them,  
provides that “the inheritance shall be divided: into two  
moieties, one of which shall go to the paternal and the other  
to the maternal kindred in the following course, that is to  
say: To the grandfather and grandmother in equal portions;  
but if only one of these be living, then the estate shall be  
divided into two equal parts, one of which shall go to such  
survivor, and the other shall go to the descendant or descend-  
ants of such deceased grandfather or grandmother. If there  
be no such descendants, then the whole estate shall be in-  
herited by the surviving grandfather or grandmother. If  
there be no such surviving grandfather or grandmother, then  
the whole of such estate shall go to the descendants, or such  
of them as there be, and so on without end, passing in like  
manner to the nearest lineal ancestors and their descendants,  
or to such of them as there be.” (Paschal’s Dig., art. 3419.)  
  
The obscurity and uncertainty of this subdivision of said  
section arise out of the fact, that after the inheritance is  
directed to be divided into two moieties, one to go to the  
paternal and the other to the maternal kindred of the intes-

explains what was meant. It is the tenth section, as follows:  
“Where, for the want of issue of the intestate, and of father,  
mother, brothers, and sisters, or their descendants, the inher-  
itance is directed to go by moieties to the paternal and mater-  
nal kindred, if there should be no such kindred on the one  
part, the whole shall go to the other part; and if there be no  
kindred on the one part or the other, the whole shall go to  
the wife or husband of the intestate,” &amp;e. (Hart. Dig. art.  
581, p. 217.)  
  
We have here, incidentally, an explanation of what was  
meant in the fourth subdivision of the section of the statute  
under consideration, as it stood in the act of 1840, the lead-  
ing object of which, doubtless, was to cast the inheritance  
upon the wife or husband upon a certain remote contingency,
