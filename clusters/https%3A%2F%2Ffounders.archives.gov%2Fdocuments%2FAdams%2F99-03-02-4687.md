the agents of his benevolent purposed, and brings upon the Stage of human affairs the individuals qualified for critical emergencies in the fortunes of States.We will honor the wise and good who have gone before us by a just sense of their merits.—Let us not be wanting in other expressions of respect to their memory.Let us feel and act on the occasion as we have reason to think they would desire. As good men they would wish us to estimate rightly the value of their lives and services; But they would exhort us to manifest our sentiments of regard not merely by praises, but by the practice of the virtues which make us at once happy and useful, by  holding in due estimation the public blessings which they labored and suffered to secure, by a perpetual co-operation in maintaining and advancing the welfare of our common country.Let the achievements and efforts of eminent predecessors be emulated by those who succeed to their places.With increased opportunities and a wider sphere, we ought proportionally to excel.—The circumstances indeed are different, but the principle of conduct is the same for us and them.—a faithful discharge of one duty as Men, as Christians and as Citizens according to the means in our power, and the stations and relations in which we are placed.—Our fathers were allotted to a field of strife, of difficulty and danger.—We have a conflict of another kind, but not less severe.—We are to resist the wiles and baffle the temptations incident to a condition of prosperity, security and care.—We are to exercise the virtues without the privations pertaining to those who laid the foundations of the Republic.—To the other motives and excitement of patriotism is added the sentiment congenial with an ingenuous mind; the reflection that in our cares and exertions in our respective places, for the civil, religious and literary community, an in every act which answers to the duty of a good citizen, we are associated with Sages, Patriots and Heroes of past times.—we are fortifying their toils; accomplishing their wishes and hopes, and consummating their glory.—When those whom we desire in this way to celebrate and honor are not only endeared by the name of common country, but the tie of consanguinity; When public cares in an elevated and arduous station are in concurrence with filial duty and affection and a Son is summoned by diving Providence to administer the great concerns, and to help forward the march of the improvement of the Country to which the Father devoted his powers and affection, and with which his name is blended, the work of patriotism and duty may well be performed with augmented zeal and a deeper interest.The young should feel themselves peculiarly called to study the characters and principles, to understand the value of the labors and the contributions, to hand down the merits and to copy the excellencies of the great and good who have preceded them, that “instead of the fathers may be the children,” to improve and perfect what has been so well begun

r this topic let me cite the emphatic words of the “Defence of the American Constitutions” written nearly forty years ago—“The present actors on the stage have been too little prepared by their early views, and too much occupied with turbulent scenes, to do more than they have done; impartial justice will confess that it is astonishing they have been able to do so much.—It is for you and your youthful companions, to make yourselves masters of what your predecessors have been able to comprehend and accomplish but imperfectly. A prospect into futurity in America is like contemplating the heavens through the telescopes of Herschells.—Objects, stupendous in their magnitudes and motions strike us from all quarters, and fill us with amazement! When we recollect, that the wisdom or the folly, the virtue or the vice, the liberty or the servitude of those millions now beheld by us, only as Columbus saw those times in vision, are certainly to be influenced, perhaps decided, by the manners, examples, principles and political institutions of the present generation, that mind must be hardened into stone that is not melted into reverence and awe.—With such affecting scenes before his eyes, is there, can there be a young American indolent and incurious; surrendered up to dissipation and frivolity; vain of imitating the loosest manners of countries, which can never be made much better or much worse? A profligate American youth must be profligate indeed, and richly merits the scorn of mankind.”—When we ar

They hunger no more, neither thirst any more and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,—there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, not crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away.—The good are liable to be misunderstood, misrepresented, injured persecuted.

Whatever unsettled and inconvenient circumstances of life led them to confess that they were strangers and travellers on the earth, must with little variation apply to persons of all periods, so that in consideration of the fugitive and mutable nature of this State, every one may justly say with David, “I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my Fathers were.” Whatever objects beyond this life were held out to the faith of ancient Saints to induce them to feel &amp; act as if this were not their final destination, are proposed to us with a brighter evidence, and a more undoubted certainty.

mained unshaken by particular instances of depravity. He con-  
sidered ignorance, false judgment, and bad reasoning, rather than  
malignity, as affording the solution of their vice ; and the popular

those he thought greedy of power for its own sake, are supposed

We look back on the vicissitudes of prosperity and adversity,

public blessings which they laboured and suffered to secure ; ard

welfare of our common country.  
  
When those, whom we desire in this way to celebrate and  
honour, are endeared not only by the name of common country,  
but by the tie of consanguinity ; when public cares in an elevated  
and arduous station are in concurrence with filial duty and affec-  
tion, and a Son is summoned by divine Providence to administer  
the great concerns, and to help forward the improvement, of the  
country to which the Father devoted his powers and affections,  
and with which his name is blended ;—the work of patriotism  
and duty may well be performed with augmented zeal and a deep-  
er interest.  
  
The young should feel themselves peculiarly called to study  
the characters and principles, to understand the value of the  
labours and the institutions, to hand down the merits, and to  
copy the excellencies, of the great and good who have preceded  
them; that “instead of the fathers may be the children,” to  
improve and perfect what has been so well begun.  
  
Let the achievements and efforts of eminent predecessors  
be emulated by those who succeed to their places. With in-  
creased opportunities and a wider sphere, we ought proportiona-  
bly to excel. The circumstances are indeed different, but the  
principle of conduct is the same for us and them, —a faithful  
discharge of our duty as men, as Christians, and as citizens, ac-  
cording to the means in our power, and the stations and relations  
in which we are placed.
