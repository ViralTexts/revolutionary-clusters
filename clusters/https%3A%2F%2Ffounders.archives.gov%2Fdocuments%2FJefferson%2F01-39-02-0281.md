To me it would appear   
1st. That the United States as a Nation have an inherent right to acquire territory   
2d. That whenever that acquisition is by treaty, the same constituted authorities in whom the treaty making power is vested have a constitutional right to sanction the acquisition   
3d. That whenever the territory has been acquired, Congress have the power either of admitting into the Union as a new State, or of annexing to a State with the consent of that State, or of making regulations for the government of, Such territory.   
The only possible objection must be derived from the 10th amendment which declares that powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States or to the people.   
As the States are expressly prohibited from making treaties, it is evident that, if the power of acquiring territory by treaty is not considered within the meaning of the amendment as delegated to the United States, it must be reserved to the people. If that be the true construction of the Constitution it substantially amounts to this—that the United States are precluded from, and renounce altogether the enlargement of territory; a provision sufficiently important and singular to have deserved to be expressly enacted. Is it not a more natural construction to say that the power of acquiring territory is delegated to the United States by the several provisions which authorize the several branches of Government to make war—to make treaties—&amp; to govern the territory of the Unio

of thirteen, then, being two thirds of all the origi­

State could be brought in. Thus stood the great  
principle of our Union, when the present Constitu­  
tion was framed, in 1787. At that time, but sub­  
sequent to the date of the articles of confederation,  
the United States, as we have seen, had acquired  
the vast territory northward of the Ohio, and stipu­  
lated that it should be formed into States.
