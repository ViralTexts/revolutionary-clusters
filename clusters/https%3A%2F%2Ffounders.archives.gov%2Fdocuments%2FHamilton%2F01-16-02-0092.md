—The duties on imports and tonnage are received by the Collectors of the Customs. The duties on Spirits distilled within the United States, by the Collectors of Divisions, who pay them over to the Inspectors of Surveys, who pay them over to the Supervisors of Districts. The Foreign Loans, by the Bankers abroad, under whose immediate agency they are made. The domestic loans, duties on patents, coined cents, and debts from individuals, by the Treasurer.  
It is the general rule, that the Treasurer is the medium of all receipts and disbursements of public monies, which are received and disbursed within the United States; and that all receipts and disbursements must be sanctioned by Warrants in favor of, and upon that Officer: These Warrants are signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, countersigned by the Comptroller, and registered and attested by the Register. Those for receipts must have an acknowledgment of the Treasurer, in order to the discharge of the payer. Those for disbursements must have an equivalent acknowledgment on behalf of the party receiving, in order to the discharge of the Treasurer. This description of Warrants will apply, as often as the term shall be hereafter used.  
This general rule with regard to receipts has been carried into effect, by five modes of proceeding.  
1st:   By Bills or drafts drawn by the Treasurer, under the special direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, upon those, who have in their hands public monies, which drafts, before they pass from the Treasurer’s hands, are registered and countersigned by the Register of the Treasury, or by a confidential Clerk designated by him for that purpose. This course is applicable, as well to monies drawn from abroad, as to those accruing within the United States; except that foreign Bills are always countersigned by the Register himself.  
2nd   By deposits made by the Supervisors of the revenue and the Collectors of the customs, in the several Banks, pursuant to a general direction from the Secretary of the Treasury; which, immediately upon their being made, are passed by the Banks to the credit of the Treasurer; the Officer, who makes the deposit, taking duplicate receipts from the Bank in which it is made, one of which is immediately forwarded to the Treasury; and the Bank making weekly returns, one to the Secretary of the Treasury, another to the Treasurer, which specify the deposits made.  
3d   By remittances of the Supervisors and Collectors to the Treasurer. These remittances are generally in Bank-bills, though they are sometimes in Bills or Orders on individuals, sometimes by mutual credits, where the Treasurer, as agent for the War department, has a sum to pay to one

limited; and they all appear in the weekly returns of the Officers to the Secretary of the Treasury, and to the Commissioner of the Revenue.  
4th   By special directions from the Secretary of the Treasury, to the Supervisors and Collectors of the customs, to make advances, provisionally, for certain specified purposes requiring local advances. These are always written, and specify their objects. The course is, for duplicate receipts to be taken of the persons, to whom the advances are made, one of which being sent to the Treasury, is the foundation of a Warrant.  
5th   By Warrants upon the persons who are to pay, in favor of the Treasurer. But the four first modes, which all operate as modes of remittance to the Treasury, resolve themselves, eventually, into the fifth. All advances and payments must be finally sanctioned by Warrants, in order to their legal validity.

o the Treasurer, immediately upon their being deposited. Those upon the Agents of the United States abroad have not been so credited; but after the monies have been received by the Bank, they have been passed over to the Treasurer, upon Warrants.  
Instructions to the Treasurer for drawing, depositing or remitting bills are, generally, if not universally written. Those to the Banks for disposing of them are equally so.  
Weekly returns from the several Collectors of the customs, Supervisors of the revenue, and Banks, enable the Secretary to regulate his directions to the Treasurer for drawing.  
II.   As to the keeping  
The Treasurer, pursuant to general instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury, keeps the public monies in his custody or controul in the several Banks. Formerly the Banks of North America, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland, were places of deposit. At present, the public monies are kept in the Bank of the United States, and the several Offices of discount and deposit, at Boston, New York, Baltimore and Charleston, and in the Bank of Providence. All monies in the Treasury form a common mass. The Treasurer has never any public money in his possession or custody, which is not, in fact, deposited in Bank, from the moment his possession or custody commences, till it ceases by the disbursement of it, for public purposes, except in the cases of Bank-bills, orders upon individuals &amp;c. heretofore enumerated as remittances by the Supervisors of the revenue, and Collectors of the Customs to the Treasurer; and these also, immediately after the receipt of them, constitutes deposits in Bank to the credit of the Treasurer.  
The Secretary of the Treasury, or any other Officer of the Department, besides the Treasurer, never has, for a moment, the possession or custody of any part of the public monies (except in the cases hereafter specified) and the possession or custody of the Treasurer, is, as already stated, exercised through the Banks. The only exceptions to this observation respect certain inconsiderable sums occasionally placed in the hands of the Commissoner of the revenue, for the service of the light house establishments, and certain other small sums, for contingencies of the Offices of Secretary, Comptroller, Commissioner of the revenue, and Auditor, which are, from time to time, in proportion to their expenditure, placed in the hands of the Register, for disbursement, who renders an account of the disbursement, which undergoes a regular and formal settlement, as other public accounts. The same is done by the Commissioner of the revenue.  
The monies of the United States, which are disbursed abroad, are kept by the Bankers, under whose agency the loans are made, till they are disbursed for the purposes of their destination.

y Warrants issuing, in the first instance, upon the treasurer, which is the general course, and the invariable one, where payments are made immediately at the Treasury.  
2nd   By drafts of the Treasurer, under special direction of the Secretary, registered and countersigned by the Register.  
3d   By special directions from the Secretary of the Treasury, to the Supervisors, and Collectors, to make advances of money, provisionally, for certain specified purposes, requiring local advances, as mentioned in a preceding place. These directions never extend to any monies, which have once passed to the credit of the Treasurer.  
The two last modes resolve themselves eventually into the first. Warrants finally issue for the sums paid either upon the drafts of the Treasurer, or under the directions of the Secretary.  
There is, besides, an auxiliary mode of effecting public payments in certain cases.  
It occasionally happens, that the omission or delay of appropriations by law, renders it impossible, to satisfy, in regular course, demands upon the Treasury, which have been incurred pursuant to law, and the satisfying of which is essential to the public credit and service.  
In such cases, the course has been, for the Secretary of the Treasury to request informal advances by the Banks, to the persons, to whom the payments are to be made, to be reimbursed, when provision is made by law. These advances have been made in the confidence, that the Secretary of the Treasury would not request them, but in cases, in which there was a moral certainty of a future provision, and in which, justice and good faith would necessarily oblige the Legislature to make it. The accounts of such advances are distinct from that of the Treasurer, and the advances are reimbursed, when provision is made by law, by warrants upon the Treasurer. Of a similar nature, are deposits, which have been made with Banks in certain cases. Of these, there have been three examples; one with the Bank of North America, mentioned and explained in my reports of last Session, two with the Bank of the United States, as offsetts against the first and second instalments of the two million loan. The two first of these d

sing of public monies, and regulating and keeping the accounts thereof, are as follow:  
The Secretary of the Treasury superintends the collection and receipt, and the disbursement of public monies. In consequence of this, all authorities for transferring them from one public Agent to another, or for the final disbursement of them, originate with him. He directs the drawing of monies into the Treasury, and regulates the time, manner, and circumstances, subject to the sanctions prescribed by law: and judges, exclusively of other Officers of the Department, when and what disbursements are to be made, subject, nevertheless, to the check of the Comptroller, who, in countersigning warrants, is jointly responsible with him, for their being conformable to appropriations by law, and to the further check and settlement of the accounts of all persons, to whom he may have caused advances of public money, by the Auditor and Comptroller. All warrants for the payment of money into the Treasury, or for the payment of money out of the Treasury, are first signed by him. It is also his duty, to decide on the forms of keeping all public accounts.  
The Comptroller is to countersign all warrants drawn by the Secretary of the Treasury, as well for the payment of money into the Treasury, as for the payment of money out of the Treasury. To enforce the regular and punctual payment of all monies collected for, or due to the United States, he is to direct prosecutions for all delinquencies of Officers and persons indebted.  
He is to prepare for the consideration and decision of the Secretary, the forms of keeping all public accounts; is, in the last resort, to settle all public accounts; and, consequently, to superintend the keeping of them. It is his duty, to see, that all expenditures of public money are according to appropriations by law, and that all persons, who have the handling of them, duly account.  
The Auditor, (as auxiliary to the Comptroller) is to receive all public accounts, for the purpose of settling them, to examine and adjust them, in the first instance, to certify the balances, which he finds; and to transmit each adjustment made by him, together with the vouchers and his certificate, to the Comptroller, for final decision.

als were paid into the Treasury without any intermediate  
agency. Foreign loans were received by the bankers abroad  
under whose immediate agency they were made. The reve-  
nue of the post-office was received by the deputy postmas-  
ters, who paid it to the Postmaster-General, and the coined  
  
&quot; cents were received by the Treasurer of the Mint.  
  
The Treasurer was the medium of all receipts and dis-  
bursements of public moneys. All receipts and disburse-  
ments must be sanctioned by warrants drawn on and in  
favor of that officer. These warrants were signed by the  
Secretary of the Treasury, countersigned by the Comptroller,  
and registered by the Register. Warrants for receipts  
required an acknowledgement of the Treasurer in order to  
discharge the payer; and warrants for disbursements required  
an equivalent acknowledgement by the person receiving them  
to discharge the Treasurer.  
  
Five modes were adopted in regard to receipts, each of  
which may be briefly expiained. The first mode was for the  
Treasurer to draw bills or drafts, under the special direction  
of the Secretary of th

several banks, by a general order of the Secretary of the  
Treasury. As soon as they were made they were passed by  
the banks to the credit of the Treasurer. The officer making  
the deposits took duplicate receipts from the bank, one of  
which he immediately sent to the Treasury, while retain-  
ing the other. The bank also made weekly returns, one to  
the Secretary of the Treasury, another to the Treasurer,  
specifying the persons making the deposits and the amount  
of them.  
  
The third mode was by remittances of the supervisors  
and collectors to the Treasurer. These were generally made  
in bank bills, though sometimes in bills or orders on indi-  
viduals ; in some cases, however, they were made in mutual  
credits and in specie. Another mode was by special direc-

In respect to disbursements, one mode was by warrants  
issued by the Treasurer. .This was the general method, and  
the invariable one, when payments were made immediately  
at the Treasury. The second mode was by drafts drawn by  
the Treasurer, under special order of the Secretary of the  
Treasury, registered and countersigned by the Register. The  
third mode was by a special order of the Secretary of the  
Treasury to the supervisors and collectors to make advances  
of money provisionally for certain specified purposes. These  
directions were never given with regard to any money  
which had passed to the credit of the Treasurer. The two  
last modes were finally resolved into the first, so that war-  
rants finally issued for the sums paid either on the drafts  
of the Treasurer, or under the direction of the Secretary.

thus continuing the usage established by the confederation.  
The Treasurer himself never actually had any public money  
in his possession. It was, in fact, in a bank from the  
moment of receiving it until disbursed. The only excep-  
tions were bank bills, orders on individuals. mutual credits  
and specie remitted by the supervisors of the revenue, and  
collectors of the customs to the Treasurer. As soon as  
received they were deposited in a bank to the credit of the  
Treasurer. Nor did the Secretary of the Treasury or any  
other officer of the Treasury department at any time have  
possession of public money, except in a few instances too  
unimportant to be mentioned.

their existence, and in many indirect ways it gave them its  
sanction. At the first session of the third Congress Mr.  
Baldwin made an exhaustive report upon the methods of the  
Treasury Department.! In this he mentions the custom already  
in vogue of the secretary’s giving special directions to the  
supervisors and collectors of customs to make advances pro-  
visionally for certain specified purposes. He adds that “all  
advances and payments must finally be sanctioned by warrants  
in order to their legal validity.”  
  
In many cases [he continues] the accounts are settled before any  
advances are made; but in these instances where advances are un-  
avoidable from the nature of the service, as to the commissioners of  
loans [who paid the interest on the public debt and pensions to invalids],  
the contractors and other agents of the War Department, the parties  
who receive advances are, by the terms of the warrants for advances,  
held accountable until a final settlement.  
  
Warrants, then, from the first were issued not only to secure  
payment into or out of the Treasury, for which purpose alone  
they were designed by the framers of the system, but also to  
validify such payments or disbursements after they had been  
made. In this departure the third Congress saw nothing to  
condemn. Mr. Baldwin, who had taken a prominent part in  
the organization of the department, pronounced all of its opera-  
tions very good. The subject of advances was again called to  
the attention of Congress in 1801 in an admirable report by Mr
