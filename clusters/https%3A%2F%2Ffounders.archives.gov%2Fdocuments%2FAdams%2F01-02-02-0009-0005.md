Years. He has a fine Countenance.  
The Chevalier de la Luzerne, and M. Marbois are in raptures with my Son. They get him to teach them the Language. I found this Morning the Ambassador, Seating on the Cushing in our State Room, Mr. Marbois in his Cot at his left Hand and my Son streched out in his at his Right—The Ambassador reading out loud, in Blackstones Discourse, at his Entrance on his Professorship of the Common Law at the University, and my Son correcting the Pronunciation of every Word and Syllable and Letter. The Ambassador said he was astonished, at my Sons Knowledge. That he was a Master of his own Language like a Professor. Mr. Marbois said your Son teaches Us more than you. He has Point de Grace—Point d’Eloges. He shews us no Mercy, and makes Us no Compliments. We must have Mr. John.

June 23. Wednesday.  
  
  
This Forenoon, fell strangely, yet very easily into Conversation with M.M.  
I went up to him—M.M. said I, how many Persons have you in your Train and that of the Chevalier who speak the German Language?— Only my Servant, said he, besides myself and the Chevalier.—It will be a great Advantage to you said I in America, especially in Pensilvania, to be able to speak German. There is a great Body of Germans in Pennsylvania and Maryland. There is a vast Proportion of the City of Philadelphia, of this Nation who have their Churches in it, two of which one Lutheran the other Calvinist, are the largest and most elegant Churches in the City, frequented by the most numerous Congregations, where the Worship is all in the German Language.  
Is there not one Catholic, said M.M.?—Not a German Church said I. There is a Roman catholic Church in Philadelphia, a very decent Building, frequented by a respectable Congregation, consisting partly of Germans, partly of French and partly of Irish.—All Religions are tolerated in America, said M.M., and the Ambassadors have in all Courts a Right to a Chappell in their own Way. But Mr. Franklin never had any.—No said I, laughing, because Mr. F. had no—I was going to say, what I did not say, and will not say here. I stopped short and laughed.—No, said Mr. M., Mr. F. adores only great Nature, which has interested a great many People of both Sexes in his favour.—Yes, said I, laughing, all the Atheists, Deists and Libertines, as well as the Philosophers and Ladies are in his Train—another Voltaire and Hume. —Yes said Mr. M., he is celebrated as the great Philosopher and the great Legislator of America.—He is said I a great Philosopher, but as a Legislator of America he has done very little. It is universally believed in France, England and all Europe, that his Electric Wand has accomplished all this Revolution but nothing is more groundless. He has done very little. It is believed that he made all the American Constitutions, and their Confederation. But he made neither. He did not even make the Constitution of Pensylvania, bad as it is. The Bill of Rights is taken almost verbatim from that of Virginia, which was made and published two or three Months before that of Philadelphia was begun. It was made by Mr. Mason, as that of Pensilvania was by Timothy Matlack, James Cannon and Thomas Young and Thomas Paine. Mr. Sherman of Connecticutt and Dr. F. made an Essay towards a Confederation about the same Time. Mr. Shermans was best liked, but very little was finally adopted from either, and the real Confederation was not made untill a Year after Mr. F. left America, and but a few Days before I left Congress.  
Who, said the Chevalier, made the Declaration of Independance?— Mr. Jefferson of Virginia, said I, was the Draughtsman. The Committee consisted of Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Franklin, Mr. Harrison, Mr. R. and myself, and We appointed Mr. Jefferson a subcommittee to draw it up.  
I said that Mr. Franklin had great Merit as a Philosopher. His Discoveries in Electricity were very grand, and he certainly was a Great Genius, and had great Merit in our American Affairs. But he had no Title to the Legislator of America.  
Mr. M. said he had Wit and Irony, but these were not the Faculties of Statesmen. His Essay upon the true Means of bringing a great Empire to be a small one was very pretty.—I said he had wrote many Things, which had great Merit and infinite Wit and Ingenuity. His bonhomme Richard was a very ingenious Thing, which had been so much celebrated in France, gone through so many Editions, and been recommended by Curates and Bishops to so many Parishes and Diocesses.  
Mr. M. asked, are natural Children admitted in America to all Priviledges like Children born in Wedlock.—I answered they are not Admitted to the Rights of Inheritance. But their fathers may give them Estates by Testament and they are not excluded from other Advantages.—In France, said M.M., they are not admitted into the Army nor any Office in Government.—I said they were not excluded from Commissions in the Army, Navy, or State, but they were always attended with a Mark of Disgrace.—M.M. said this, No doubt, in Allusion to Mr. Fs. natural Son and natural Son of a natural Son. I let myself thus freely into this Conversation being led on naturally by the Chevalier and Mr. Marbois, on Purpose because I am sure it cannot be my Duty nor the Interest of my Country that I should conceal any of my sentiments of this Man, at the same Time that I due Justice to his Merits. It would be worse than Folly to conceal my Opinion of his great Faults

The Discipline, on Board this Ship, is a constant Subject of Speculation to me. I have seen no Punishments inflicted, no Blows struck, nor heard scarcely an Angry Word spoken, from the Captain to any of his officers, or from any of the officers to the Men. They live together in greater Intimacy and Familiarity than any Family I ever saw. The Galliard or Quarter Deck, seems to be as open to the foremast Men as the Captain. Captain, all other Officers, the Ambassador, his Train, Common Sailors, and domestic Servants are all walking upon Deck, and sitting round upon Seats on it, upon a footing of perfect Equality that is not seen in one of our Country Town Meetings in America. I never saw so much Equality and Levelling in any Society, whatever. Strange Contrast to a British, or even an American Frigate. Landais is a great Mogul, in

the same weakness.  
We cut short our excerpts with a passage from  
his journal on the return voyage from France,  
which presents a by no means complimentary  
view of  
THE CHARACTER OF DR. FEANKLIN.  
This forenoon, fell strangely, yet very easily into  
conversation with M. Marbois. I went up to him.  
&quot;M. Marbois,&quot; said I, &quot;how many persons have yeu  
in your train, and that of the Chevalier, who speak  
the German language!&quot; &quot;Only my servant,&quot; said  
said he, &quot;besides the Chevalier and myself. &quot;It  
will be a great advantage to you,&quot; said I, &quot;in Amer-  
ica, especially in Pennsylvasiia, to be able to speak  
German. There is a great body of Germans in  
Pennsylvania and Maryland. There is a vast proe  
portion of the city of Philadeiphia of this nation.  
who have three churches in it, two of which, one  
Lutheran, the other Calvinist, are the largest and  
most elegant churches in the city, frequented by the  
most numerous congregations, where the worship is  
all in the German language.&quot; &quot;Is there not one  
Catholic!&quot; said M. Marbois. &quot;Not a German  
church,&quot; said l. &quot;There is a Roman Catholic  
church in Philadelphia, a very decent building, fre­  
quented by a respectable congregation, consisting  
partly of Germans, partly of French, and partly of  
Irish.&quot; &quot;All religions are tolerated in America.  
said M. Marbois, &quot;and the ambassadors have in all  
courts a right to a chapel in their own way but  
Mr. Franklin never had any.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said I, laugh­  
ing, &quot;because Mr. Franklin had no.&quot;-I was going  
to say what I did not say, and will not say here. I  
stopped short, and laughed. &quot;No, said M. Marbols.  
Mif Franklin adores only great Nature, which has  
interested a great many people of both sexes in his  
favor.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said I, laughing, &quot;all the atheists,  
deists, and libertmes, as well as the philosophers  
and ladies, are in his train, another Voltaire, and  
thence-&quot;&quot;Yes,&quot; said M. Marbots, &quot;he is cele-  
brated as the great philosopher and the great legis.­  
lator of America.&quot; &quot;He is,&quot; said I,&quot;a great phi­  
losopher, but as a legislator of America he has done  
very little. It is universally believed in France,  
England, and all Europe, that his electric wand has  
complished all this revolution. But nothing is more  
groundless. He has done very little. It is believed  
that he made all the American constitutions and  
their confederation, but he made neither. He did  
not even make the constitution of Pennsylvamia.  
bad as it is. The bill of rights is taken almost vers  
batim from that of Virginia which was made and  
published two or three months before that of Phila­  
elphta was begun it was made by Mr. Mason, a  
that of Pennsylvania was by Timothy Matlack.  
James Cannon, and Thomas Young, and Thomas  
Pamne. Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut, and dr  
Franklin made an essay toward a confederation  
about the same time. Mr. Sherman&#x27;s was best liked,  
but very little was finally adopted from either, and  
the real confederation was not made until a year  
after Mr. Franklin left America, and but a few days  
before Ileft Congress&quot;&quot; Who&quot; said the Chevalier,  
mace the Declaration of Independence!&quot; Mr.  
Jeflerson, of Virginia,&quot; said I, &quot;was the draughts.­  
man. The Committee tconsisted of Mr. Jefferson,  
Mr. Franklin, Mr Harrison, Mr. it and myself and  
we appointed Jefferson a sub-committee to draw  
it up.&quot;  
I faid that Mr. Franklin had great merit as a phis  
losopher. His discoveries in electricity were very  
srand, and he certainly was a great genius, and had  
great merit in our American affairs. But he had no  
utle to the legislator of America.&#x27; M. Marbois said  
he had wit and irony, but these were not the facul  
ties of statesmen. His Essay upon the true means  
of bringing a great Empire to be a small one, was  
very pretty. I said he had wrote many things which  
had great merit, and iniinite wif and ingenuity. this  
Bonhomme ltichard was a very ingenious thing.  
which had been so much celebrated in France, gone  
through so many editions, and been recommended  
by curates and bishops to so many parishes and dio  
ceses.  
M. Marbois asked, are natural children admitted  
in America to all privileges like children born in  
wedlock? I answered. They are not admitted to  
the rights of inheritance but their fathers may give  
them estates by testament, and they are not excluded  
from other advantages. &quot;In France,&quot; said M. Mar­  
bois, &quot;they are not admitted into the army nor any  
office in Government.&quot; I said, they were not ex  
cluded from commissions in the army, navy, or State,  
but they were always attended with a mark of dis­  
grace.M. Marbers said this no doubt, in allusien  
to Mr. F.&#x27;s natural son, and natural son of a natural  
son. I let myself thus freely into this conversation,  
being led on naturally by the Chevalter and M. Mar­  
bols on purpose, because I am sure it cannot be my  
duty nor the interest of my country, that I should  
concel any of my sentiments of this man, at the  
same time that I do justice to his merits. It would  
be worse than folly to conceal my opinion of his  
great faults
