It is not in quality of Minister of a King, the friend and Ally of the United States (tho with the knowledge &amp; consent of his majesty) that I now have the honor to write your Excellency—It is as a man of sensibility and as a tender father who feels  
all the force of Paternal love, that I take the liberty to address to your Excellency my earnest sollicitations in favor of a Mother and a family in Tears—her situation seems the more worthy of notice on our part as it is to the humanity of a Nation at War with her own  
that she has recourse for what she ought to receive from the impartial Justice of her own Generals.  
I have the honor to inclose your Excellency Copy of a Letter which Mrs Asgill has just wrote me—I am not known to her nor was I acquainted that her son was the unhappy Victim destined by lot to expiate the odious Crime that a formal denial of Justice  
obliges you to revenge your Excellency will not read this Letter without being extremely affected. it had that effect upon the King and upon the Queen to whom I communicated it.—The goodness of their Majesties Hearts induces them to desire that the inquietudes of an  
unfortunate Mother may be calmed and her tenderness reassured. I felt, Sir, that there are cases where humanity itself exacts the most extreme Rigour, perhaps the one now in question may be of the number, but—allowing Reprisals to be just—it is not the less horrid to  
those who are the Victims—and the character of your Excellency is too well known, for me not to be persuaded that you desire nothing more than to be able to avoid the disagreeable necessity.  
There is one consideration, Sir, which, tho it is not decisive, may have an influence on your resolutions—Capt. Asgill is doubless your Prisoner, but he is among those whom the Arms of the King contributed to put into your hands at York Town Altho’ this  
circumstance does not operate as a Safe Guard, it however justifies the interest I permit my self to take in this affair. If it is in your power Sir to consider &amp; to have regard to it you will do what is agreeable to their Majesties the danger of young Asgill—the  
tears—the despair of his Mother affects them sensibly—and they will see with pleasure—the hope of consolation shine out for these unfortunate people.  
In seeking to deliver Mr Asgill from the fate which threatens him, I am far from engaging you to seek another Victim—the Pardon to be perfectly satisfactory must be entire. I do not immagine it can be productive of any bad consequences. If the English  
General has not been able to punish the horrible Crime you complain of in so exemplary a manner as he should—there is reason to think he will take the most efficacious measures to prevent the like in future.  
I sincerely wish, Sir, that my intercession may meet success—the sentiment which dictates it &amp; which you have not ceased to manifest on every occasion assures me that you will not be indifferent to the prayers &amp; to the tears of a family who has  
recourse to your Clemency thro’ me. It is rendering homage to your Virtue to implore it. I have the honor to be with the most perfect consideration Sir Your Excellencys Very humble &amp; very Obed. servt  
De Vergennes  
  
  
  
Enclosure  
  
  
Sir,  
London July 18. 1782  
  
If the politeness of the French Court will permit an Application of a Stranger, there can be no Doubt but one, in which all the tender feelings of an individual can be interested, will meet with a favorable reception from a nobleman whose character does  
honor not only to his own Country but to human Nature. The Subject, Sir, on which I presume to implore your Assistence, is too heart-piercing for me to dwell on, and common fame has most probably informed you of it; it therefore renders the painful task unnecessary. My  
Son (an only Son) and dear as he is brave, amiable as deserving to be so, only nineteen, a prisoner under Articles of Capitulation of York-Town, is now confined in America an object of retaliation! Shall an innocent suffer for the guilty? Represent to yourself, Sir, the  
situation of a family under these circumstances; surrounded as I am by Objects of distress; distracted with fear &amp; grief; no words can express my feelings or paint the scene—my husband given over by his physicians a few hours before the news arrived, and not in a  
state to be informed of the misfortune—my daughter seized with a fever and delirium, raving about her brother, and without one interval of reason, save to hear the heart-alleviating circumstance—let your feelings, Sir, suggest and plead for  
my inexpressible misery—a Word from you like a Voice from Heaven will save us from distraction and wretchedness. I am well informed General Washington reveres your character; say but to him that you wish my Son to be relieved and he will restore him to his distracted  
family, and render him to happiness—My Son’s virtues &amp; bravery will justify the deed His honor, Sir, carried him to America—he was born to affluence, independence and the happiest prospects—let me again supplicate your goodness, let me respectfully implore your high  
influence in behalf of innocence—in the cause of justice—of humanity—that you would dispatch a letter to General Washington from France and favor me with a copy of it to be sent from hence. I am sensible of the liberty I take in making this request but I am also sensible  
that whether you comply with it or not you will pity the distress that suggests it. Your humanity will drop a tear on the fault and efface it. I will pray that Heaven may grant you may never want the comforts it is in your power to bestow on  
  
Asgill

der feelings of an individual can be interefted

fume to implore vour affiftance, is too heart-  
piercing for me to dwell on, and common  
fame has maft.probably informed you.of it ;  
it therefore renders the painful tafk unne-

he is brave, amiable as he -is deferving to be  
fo, only nineteen, a prifoner under articles  
of capitulation at York- Town, is now con-  
fined in America, an object of retaliation.  
Shall an innocent fuffer for the guilty! Re-  
prefent to yourfelf, Sir, the fituation of a  
‘family under. thefe circumftances, fur-  
rounded as I am by objects of diftrefs; dif-  
tracted with fear and grief; no words can

daughter feized with a fever and deiirium,  
wmving about her brother, and without one  
interval of reafon, fave to hear heart-alle-  
viating circumftances. Let your feelings,

neral Wathington reveres your character;  
fay but to him you with my fon to be re-  
Aeafed, and he will reftore him to his dil-

My fon’s virtue avd bravery will juftify the

me again fupplicate your goodnefs; let me

| is not in quality of a King, the  
friend and ally of the United States,  
though with the knowledge and confent  
of his Majelty, that I now have the  
honour to write to your Excellency. It  
is a man of fenfibility, and a tender father  
who feels all the force of paternal love,  
  
that I take the liberty to addrefs to your’  
  
Excellency my earneft folicitations in fa-  
vour of a mother and family in tears.  
Her fituation feems the more worthy of  
notice, on our part, as it is to the hu-  
manity of a nation at war with her own,  
  
that fhe has recourfe for what the ought to’  
  
receive from the impartial juitice of her  
own Generals.  
  
I have the honour to inclofe your Excel-  
lency a copy of a letter which Mrs. Afgil  
has jutt wrote to me. I am not known  
to her, nor was I acquainted that her fon  
was the unhappy victim, deftined by lot  
to expiate the odious crime that a formal  
denial of juftice obliges you to revenge.  
Your Excellency will not read this letter  
without being extremely affeéted ; ithad  
that effect upon the King and upon the  
Queen, to whom I communicated it. ‘The  
goodnefs of their Majeftics hearts induce  
them to defire that the inquietudes of an  
unfoitunate mother may be calmed, and  
her tendernefs reaffured. I feel, Sir, that  
thefe are cafes where humanity itlelf exacts  
the moft extreme rigour: perhaps the one  
now in queftion may be of the number ;  
but allowing reprizals to be juft, it is not  
lefs horrid to thofe who ave the viétims ;  
and the character of your Excellency is  
too well known for me not to be perfuaded  
that you defire nothing more than to avoid  
the difagreeable neceffity,  
  
There is one coniideration, Six, which,  
though it is not decifive, may have an in-  
flvence upon your refolution, Captain  
Aigill is doubtlefs your prifoner, but he  
is ayjwong thofe whom the arms of the  
King contributed to put into your hands  
at York-Town, Although this circum-  
flance does wot operate as a fafeguard, it  
  
2  
  
however juftifies the intereft I permit my--  
felf to tale in this affair, If it is in  
your power, Sir, to confider and have re-  
gard to it, you will do what is very  
agreeable to their Majefties ; the danger of  
young Afgill, the tears, the defpair of his  
mother, affect them fenfibly, and they  
will fee with pleafure the hope of confola-  
tion fhine out for thofe unfortunate  
people.  
  
In feeking to deliver Mr. Afgill from  
the. fate which threatens him, I am far-  
from engaging you to feek another victim ;  
the pardon, to be perfectly fatisfactory, -  
muft be entire. I do not imagine it can  
be productive of any bad contequénces.;  
If the Englith General has not been able  
to punifh the horrible crime you complain  
of, in fo exemplary a manner as he fhould, |  
there is reafon to think he will take the  
moft efficacious meafures to prevent the  
like in future,  
  
I fincerely with, Sir, that my interceffion  
may meet fuccels; the fentiment which  
diétates it, and which you have not ceafed  
to manifeit on every occation, aflures me,  
that you will not be indifferent to the  
‘pe and to the tears of a family which:  
  
as recourfe to your clemency through me,  
It is rendering homage to your virtue to  
inplore it.

T is not in quality of a king, the friend and ally of the  
  
United States, tho’ with the knowledge and confent of his  
majefty, that I now have the honour to write to your excellency.  
It is as a man of fenfibility, and a tender father, who feels all  
the force of paternal love, that I take the liberty to addrefs to  
your excellency my earneft. folicitations in favour of a mother  
and family in tears. Her fituation feems the more worthy of  
notice on our part, as it is to the humanity of a nation at war  
with her own, that fhe has recourfe for what fhe ought to re-  
ceive from the impartial juftice of her own generals.  
  
I have the honour to enclofe your excellency a copy of a let-  
ter lady Afgill has juft wrote to me. Iam not known to her,  
nor was I acquainted that her fon was the unhappy victim, def-  
tined by lot to expiate the odious crime that a former denial of  
juftice obliges you to revenge. Your excellency will not read  
this letter, without being extremely affected; ic had that eff2&amp;  
upon the kirg, and upon the queen, to whom [ communicated  
it. The goodnefs of their majetties hearts induce them to de-  
fire that the inquictudes of an unfortunate mother may be  
calmed, and her tendernefS re-affured. I feel, Sir, that thefe  
are cafes where humanity itfelf exacts the moft extreme rigour ;  
perhaps the one now in queftion may be of the number: but  
allowing reprifals to be juit, it is not lefs horrid bp thofe who are

the victims ; and the character of your excellency is too well  
known for me not to be perfuaded that you defire nothing more  
than to be able to avoid the difagreeabie neceflity.  
  
There is oneconfideration, Sir, which, though it is not deci-  
five, may have an influence upon your refolution. Captain Af  
gill is doubtlefs your prifoner, but he is among thofe whom the  
arms of the king contributed to put into your hands at York-  
Town. Although this circumftance does not operate as a fafe-  
guard, it however juftifies the intereft I permit myfelf to take  
in this affair. If it is in your power, Sir, to confider and have  
regard to it, you will do what is-very agreeable to their majef-  
ties: the danger of young Afgill, the tears, the defpair of his  
mother, affect them fenfibly, and they will fee with pleafure the  
hope of confolation fhine out for thofe unfortunate people.  
  
In feeking to deliver Mr. Afgill from the fate which threatens  
him, I am far from engaging you to feek another victim ; the  
pardon, to be perfectly fatisfactory, muft be entire. I do not  
imagine it can be produétive of bad confequences. If the Eng-  
lith general has not been able to punifh the horrible crime you  
complain of in fo exemplary a manner as he fhould, there is  
reafon to think he will take the moft efficacious meafures to pre-  
vent the like in future.  
  
I fincerely with, Sir, that my interceflion may meet fuccefs.:  
the fentiment which dittates it, and which you have not ceafed  
to manifeft on every occafion, affures me that you will not be in-  
different to the prayers and to the tears of a family which has  
recourfe to your clemency through me. It is rendering homage  
to your virtue to implore it.

SIR,  
  
1 F the politenefs of the French court will permit an applica-  
cation from a ftranger, there can be no doubt but one in which  
all the tender feelings of an individual can be interefted, will  
meet with a favourable reception from a nobleman whofe cha-  
raéter does honour not only to his own country, but to human  
nature. The fubject, Sir, on which I prefume to implore your  
affiftance, is too heart-piercing for me to dwell on ; and coms

mon fame has, moft probably, informed you of it; it therefore  
renders the painful tafk unneceffary. My fon, an only fon, as  
dear as he is brave, amiable as he is deferving to be fo, only  
nineteen, a prifoner under articles of capitulation of York-  
Town, is now confined in America, an. object of retaliation.  
Shall.an innocent fuffer for the guilty !—Reprefent to yourfelf,  
Sir, the fituation of a family under thefe circumftances, fur-  
rounded, as I am, by objects of diftrefs—diftratted with fear  
and grief—no words can exprefs my feelings, or paint the fcene.  
My hufband, given over by his phyficians, a few hours before  
the news arrived, and notin a ftate to be informed of the mif-  
fortune—my daoghter feized with a fever and delirium, raving  
about her brother, and without one interval of reafon, fave to  
hear heart-alleviating circumftances. Let your feelings, Sir,  
faggeft and plead for my inexpreffible mifery. A word from  
you, like a voice from heaven, will fave us from diftraction and  
wretchednefs. I am well informed general Wathington reveres  
your charatter ; fay but to him, you with my fon to be releafed,  
and he will reftore him to his diftraéted family, and render him  
to happinefs. My fon’s virtue and bravery will juitify the deed.  
His honoar, Sir, carried him to America. He was born to af-  
fluence, independence, and the happieft profpecéts. Let me  
again fupplicate your goodnefs ; let me refpecfully implore  
your high influence in behalf of innocence, in the caufe of juf-  
tice, of humanity ; that&#x27;you would, Sir, difpatch a letter to ge-  
neral Wafhington, from France, and favour me with a copy of  
it, to be fent from hence. I ay fenfible of the liberty I take in  
making this requeft; but I am fenfible, whether you comply  
with it or not, you will pity the diftrefs that fuggefts ; your hu-  
manity will drop a tear on the fault, and effaceit. I will pray  
that heaven may grant you may never want the comfort it is  
your power to beitow on ASGILL.

“Srr—It is not. in the quality of the  
  
King, the friend and ally of the United  
  
States, though with the knowledge and  
  
consent of His Majesty, that I have now  
  
the honor to write to your Exeellency. It  
is as a man of sensibility and a tender  
father, who feels all the force of parental  
love, that I take the liberty to address  
your Excellency my earnest solicitations  
for a mother and family in tears.  
situation seems the more worthy of notice  
on our part, as it is to the humanity of a  
nation at war with her own, that she has  
recourse for what she ought to receive  
from the impartial justice of her own  
general. I have the honor to enelose  
your Excellency a copy of a letter which  
Mrs. Asgill has just written to me. I  
am not known to her, nor was I ac-  
quainted with her son, now the unhappy  
victim destined by lot to expiate the odious  
crime that a formal denial of justice obliged  
you to revenge. Your Excelleney will not  
read this letter without being extremely  
  
Her }  
  
  
  
and the Queen, to whom I eommunicated  
it. The goodness of their Majesties’ hearts  
induces them to desire that the inquietude  
of an unfortunate mother may be calmed,  
and her tenderness reassured. I feel, sir,  
that there are cases where humanity itself  
requires the most extreme rigor; perhaps  
the one now in question may be of the  
number ; but allowing reprisals to be just,  
it is not the less horrid to those who are  
the victims; and the character of your  
Excellency is too well known for me not  
to be persuaded that you desire nothing  
more than to be able to avoid the disagree-  
able necessity. There is one consideration,  
sir, which, though it is not decisive, may  
have an influence on your resolution : Cap-  
tain Asgill is, doubtless, your prisoner, but  
he is amongst those whom the arms of the  
King contributed to put into your hands at  
Yorktown. Although this circumstance  
does not operate as a safeguard, it however  
justifies the interest I permit myself to take  
in this affair. If it is in your power, sir, to  
consider and have regard to it, you will do  
what is very agreeable to their Majesties ;  
the danger of young Asgill, the tears, the  
despair of his mother, affeet them sensibly,  
and they will see with much pleasure the  
hope of consolation shine out for these un-  
fortunate people. In seeking to deliver  
Mr. Asgill from the fate which threatens  
him, I am far from engaging you to seek  
another victim. The pardon, to be per-  
fectly satisfactory, must be entire. I do  
not imagine it can be productive of very  
bad consequences. If the English general  
has not been able to punish the horrible  
crime you complain of m so exemplary a  
manner as he should, there is reason to  
think he will take the most efficacious mea-  
sures to prevent the like in future. I sin-  
cerely wish, sir, that my intercession may  
meet suecess, The sentiment which dic-  
tates it, and which you have not ceased  
to manifest on every oceasion, assures me  
that you will not beindifferent tothe pray-  
ers, to the tears, of a family which has  
recourse to your clemeney through me.  
It is rendering homage to your virtues to  
implore it.

“To his Excellency General Washington.”  
  
Copy of Lady Asgill’s Letter to the Count  
de Vergennes.  
“LONDON, 18th July, 1782.  
“Srr—If the politeness of the French  
court will permit the application of a  
stranger, there can be no doubt that one  
in which the tender feelings of an indivi-  
dual can be interested will meet with a  
  
favorable reception from a nobleman whose | P  
  
character does honor not only to his own  
country but to human nature. The sub-  
ject, sir, in which I presume to implore  
your assistance is too heart-piercing for me  
to dwell upon, and common fame has most  
probably informed you of it; it renders,  
  
therefore, the painful task unnecessary.  
My son, sir, an only son, as dear as he is  
brave, amiable as he is deserving to be so,  
only nineteen, a prisoner by the capitula-  
tion of Yorktown, is now confined in Ame- |  
  
rica, an object of retaliation. Shall an  
  
innocent suffer for the guilty? Represent |  
to yourself, sir, the situation of a family |  
under these circumstances, surrounded, as |  
I am, by objects of distress, distracted with |  
  
fear and grief; no words can express my  
feelings or paint the scene.  
— over by his physician a few hours  
  
efore the news arrived, and not in a state  
to be informed of the misfortune; my  
daughter seized with fever and delirium,  
  
raving about her brother, and without one |  
  
interval of reason, save to hear alleviating  
circumstances. Let your own feelings, sir,  
suggest to plead for my inexpressible  
misery. A word from you, like a voice  
from heaven, will save me from distraction  
and wretchedness. I am well informed  
that General Washington reveres your cha-  
racter ; say but to him you wish my son  
to be released, and he will restore him to  
his distracted family, and render him to  
happiness. My son’s virtue and bravery  
will justify the deed. His honor, sir, car-

Britain caused this order not to be sent  
across the water, or if sent secretly it was

to Charles Gravier, the Count de Vergen­  
nes, Prime Minister of Lonis XYI, in a

imploration and entreated him to commu­

of. it to be sent from here. I am sensible of the liberty I take in making this request,  
but I am also sensible that whether you comply or not you will pity the distress that  
suggests, and your humanity will drop a tear on the fault and efface it. I will pray  
that Heaven may grant you may never want the comfort it is in your power to bestow.

It is not in quality of the minister of a King the friend and ally of the United  
States, though with the knowledge and consent of his Majesty, that I now have the  
honor to write to your Excellency. It is asa man of sensibility, and as a tender  
father who feels all the force of paternal love, that I take the liberty to address to  
your Excellency my earnest solicitations in favor of a mother and a family in tears!  
Her situation seems the more worthy of notice on our part, as it is the humanity of  
a nation at war with her own, that she has recourse to for what she ought to receive  
from the impartial justice of her own general. I have the honor to inclose to your  
Excellency a copy of a letter which Mrs. Asgill has just wrote tome. I am not known  
to her, nor was I acquainted that her son was the unhappy victim destined by lot to  
expiate the odious crime that a formal denial of justice obliges you to revenge. Your  
Excellency will not read this letter without being extremely affected. It had that  
effect upon the King and the Queen to whom I communicated it. The goodness of  
their Majesties’ hearts induces them to desire the inquietudes of an unfortunate woman  
may be calmed ; and her tenderness I feel.  
  
There are cases, sir, when humanity itself exacts the most severe rigor ; perhaps,  
the one now in question may be of that number, but allowing reprisals to be just, it is  
not the less horrid to those who are the victims ; and the character of your Excel-  
lency is too well known for me not to be persuaded that you desire nothing more than  
to be able to avoid the disagreeable necessity.  
  
_ There is one consideration, sir, which though it is not decisive, may have an  
influence on your resolution. Captain Asgill is doubtless your prisoner, but he is  
among those whom the arms of the King contributed to put into your hands at  
Yorktown. :  
  
Although, this circumstance does not operate as a safeguard, it, however, justifies the  
interest I permit myself to take in this affair. It is in your power, sir, to consider and  
have regard to it. You will do what is very agreeable to their Majesties. The danger  
-of young Asgill, the despair of his mother affect them sensibly, and they see with  
pleasure the hope of consolation shine out of these unfortunate people. In seeking  
to deliver Mr. Asgill from the fate which threatens him, I am far from engaging you  
‘to seek another victim ; the pardon to be perfectly satisfactory must be entire.  
  
I do not imagine it can be productive of any bad consequences.  
  
If the English General has not been able to punish the crime you complain of,  
din so exemplary a manner as he should ; there is reason to think, however, that he  
will take the most efficacious measures to prevent the like in future.  
  
I sincerely wish, sir, my intercession may meet with success, the sentiments which  
-dictate it, and which you have not ceased to manifest on every occasion, assure me  
that you will not be indifferent to the prayers and tears of a family which has recourse  
:to your clemency through me. It is rendering homage to your virtues to employ it.  
  
I have the honor to be yours with highest consideration,  
DE VERGENNES.
