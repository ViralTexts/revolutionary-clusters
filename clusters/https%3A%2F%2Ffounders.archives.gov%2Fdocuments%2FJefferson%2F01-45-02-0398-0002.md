At the commencement of the year it is the duty of the Director of the Mint to communicate to Government the state of the Mint, with its issues for the past year.  
The issues of Silver Coins, notwithstanding the mercantile embarrassments attending the importation of Bullion, have greatly exceeded that of the year 1803; and the advantage of a public Mint has been sensibly experienced, by the greatest part of the Deposits being issued in small Coin, which has been found very beneficial to the Citizens at large, under the late scarcity of Spanish Dollars, occasioned by the great exportation of them for mercantile purposes.  
The quantity of Gold Bullion has been equal to that of the last report, so that in the past year the Coinage of the precious Metals has amounted to Three hundred and Fifty eight thousand nine hundred &amp; eighty three Dollars. The particulars will appear by the Schedule No. 1 herewith, to which the Director begs leave to refer.   
It is worthy of the President’s attention, that about Eleven thousand Dollars of the Gold Coin, is the produce of Virgin Gold found in the County of Cabarrus in the State of North Carolina, where it is said a very considerable quantity has been found since the last deposit, and will in all probability be forwarded to the Mint. It is to be regretted, that this Gold is melted into small ingots, before it is sent to the Mint, for the convenience of carriage, but by which, there is reason to believe, a considerable proportion of it is wasted. It is also said, that the finest particles are neglected, and only the large grains &amp; lumps sought after.  
  
The increased price of Copper in Europe, and the quantity on hand, have been thought sufficient reasons to confine the Coinage of Cents to one press; and from the last accounts from Europe, Copper is likely to be considerably encreased in price, which will render the Coinage of Cents less profitable. The past year there have been issued Seven hundred &amp; fifty six thousand Eight hundred and thirty eight Cents, and one Million and fifty five thousand three hundred &amp; twelve Half Cents, equal to Twelve thousand eight hundred and forty four Dollars and ninety four Cents, as appears by the same Schedule No. 1—The amount of the Cost of Copper and profit on the whole Coinage of Cents this year will be seen by Schedule No. 2.—  
The Coinage of the year amounts in the whole to the sum of Three hundred Seventy one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven dollars and ninety four Cents, and the number of pieces to Two Millions Forty six thousand eight hundred &amp; thirty nine.  
The expenses of the Mint for the past year will appear by Schedule No. 3. to be reduced to a trifle more than Sixteen thousand Dollars.  
The Director thinks it his duty to mention to the President, that very considerable difficulty, as well as danger, may arise to the Public, from the Officers &amp; Workmen of the Mint being exposed to be called out to attend Militia meetings or on detatchments. When large deposits of the precious metals are passing thro’ the Mint, and particularly when in fusion, it may be of the most dangerous consequence to have the Officers &amp; Men called away, or be liable to fines for non-attendance. It is too important a trust to be thus exposed. The President in his wisdom will provide against this evil.

At the commencement of the year it is the  
duty of the director of the mint, to communi­  
cate to the government, the (late of the mint,  
with its iflues for the pall year.  
. The ilTues of fiivcr cuius notwithdanding  
the mercantile fcmbarrafltncnta attending the  
importation of bullion, have greatly exceeded  
that of the year 1*103 ; and the advantage of a  
public rail.t, has been fenfibly experit need, by  
the great eft part of the depotits being ilTued in  
final! coin, which has been found very benefi­  
cial to the citizens at large, under the late fear­  
city of Spanish dollars, uccaHoned by the  
great exportation of them, for commercial ptir­  
pofes.  
The quantity of Gold bullion, has been equal  
to that of the lalt report, fo that in the paft i  
year, the coinage ot tile puctous metals, has!  
amounted to three hundred and fifty-eight  
tboul&#x27;and nine hundred and eighty-three doll ir &gt;.  
The particulars will appear by the fchedule No. |  
1, herewith, to which the director begs leave  
to refer.  
  
It is worthy of the Frcfident s attention, that &#x27;  
about eleven thoufand dollars of tin-gold coin, !  
is the produce of virgin gold, found in the!  
county Cabarrus, in the ftate of Noth Cardiina, j  
where it is laid a confiderable quantity ha;. been  
found, fince the hfl depofits, and will in all  
probability, be forwarded to the mint. It is to  
be regretted, that this gold is fmelt« d intofmall  
before it 13 feat to the mint, for the con­  
venience &lt;f carriage ; but by which, there is  
reafon to believe a couuderabte portion of it]  
is wafted. It is aifo laid, that the fineft parti- l  
cies are neglefted, and only the large grains i  
and lumps fought after.  
The inertnfed p-ice of copper in Europe, and  
the quantity on bird, have been thought fuffi­  
cieht fea&#x27;f &gt;ns to confine the coinage of cents to  
one prcTs ; a .d from the Juft iomits limn Eu­  
rope, copper is iikely to be confidrrahiy eu­  
creafedin price, which will render the coinage  
ofcents hfs profit*! le. The p.ifl year there i  
have hern i(Tucd, feven hundred anil lixly-fix&#x27;  
thoufand eight hundred and thirty-eight cents,  
and one million and fifty-five thoufand three  
hundred and I9h.i!l*cents,1requal to lSlhoufand  
hundred and forty-four dollars and ninety-four  
cents, as appears l»v the fame fchedule. No.  
1. Tile amount of the cofl of copper ard pro­  
fit on the whole coinage of cents this year will  
be Iccti by fchcdulc No. 2.  
The coinage of the year amounts in the  
vhoic, to tiitr fum of three iinnure d and feven­  
ty thoufand eight hundred and feventy feven  
dollars and ninety-four cents, and the number  
of pieces fotwo millions forty-fix thoufand eight  
hi mired and thirty-nine.  
The expences of the mint for the p-.ft year  
will appear »iy fchedule No. 2, to be redu­  
ced ton trifle more than lixteeu thoufand dol­  
lar.  
Thr din /lor t’links it his duty ft* mention  
to the Prefident, that very confiderable ditlicsl­  
•y, as well as danger may arife to the public,  
from the officers and workmen cf the mint be­  
ing c::p f:d to be called out to attend militia  
meetings or on detachments. When large de­  
p-ifilsof the precious metals are patting through  
ti e mint, and particularly when in iufion, it  
may be of the inoft dangerous confcquence to  
lave the officers and mui called away, or be  
lublc to fines for non-altendancs. It is too im­

SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT OF  
THE OPERATIONS OF THE MINT,  
DURING THE LAST YEAR,  
  
THE issues of silver coins, not-  
withstanding the mercantile embar-  
rassments attending the importation  
of bullion, have greatly exceeded  
that of the year 1803; and the ade  
vantage of a public mint has long

been sensibly experienced, by the  
greatest part of the deposits being  
issued in small coin, which has been  
found very beneficial to the citizens  
at large, under the late scarcity of  
Spanish dollars, occasioned by the  
great exportation of them, for mer-  
cantile purposes.  
  
The quantity of gold bullion has  
been equal to that of the last report,  
so that, in the past year, the coinage  
of the precious metals has amount-  
ed to 358,983 dollars.  
  
About eleven thousand dollars of  
the gold coin is the produce of vir-  
gin gold, found in the county of Ca-  
barrus, in the state of North Caro-  
lina, where, it is said, a very consi-  
derable quantity has been found,  
since the last deposits, and will, in  
all probability, be forwarded to the  
mint. It is to be regretted, that  
this gold is melted into small ingots,  
before it is sent to the mint, for the  
convenience of carriage; but by  
which, there is reason to believe, a  
considerable proportion of it is  
wasted. It is also said, that the  
finest particles are neglected, and  
only the large grains and lumps  
sought after.  
  
‘The increased price of copper in  
Europe, and the quantity on hand,  
have been thought sufficient reasons  
to confine the coinage of cents to  
one press; and from the last ac-  
count from Europe, copper is likely  
to be considerably increased in price,  
which will render the coinage of  
cents less profitable. The past  
year there have been issued, 756,838  
cents, and 1,055,312 half cents, equal  
to 12,844 dollars, 94 cents.  
  
The coinage of the year amounts,  
in the whole, to the sum of 371,827  
dollars, 94 cents, and the number of  
pieces to 2,046,839.  
  
The expences of the mint, for the  
last year, are reduced to a trifle  
more than sixteen thousand dollars.  
  
The director thinks it his duty  
to mention, that very considerable  
difficulty as well as danger may  
arise to the public, from the officers  
and workimen of the mint being ex-  
posed to be called out to attend mi-  
litia meetings, or on detachinents.  
  
REPORT OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE MINT.  
  
When large deposits of precious  
metals are passing through the  
mint, and particularly when in fue  
sion, it may be of the most dange-  
rous consequence to have officers  
and men called away, or be liable  
to fines for non-attendance. It is  
too important a trust to be thus ex-  
posed.

The iffues otf filver coins, notwithfan-

ey exceeded that of the year 1809 ;  
and the advantage of apublic mint has

coin which has been found very beneficial  
to the citizens at large, under the late fcar-

great exportation ot them, for mercantile

The expence of the mint for the paft year

The direttor, thinks it is his duty to  
mention to the Prefident, that very con-  
fiderable difficulty, as well as danger may  
arife to the public, fromthe officers and  
workmen of the mint being expofed to be  
called aut to attend militia meetings or on  
detachments, When large depofits of  
the precious metals are pafling through the  
mint, and particularly when in fufion, it  
may be of the moft dangerous confequence  
to have the officers and men called away,  
or be liable to fines for non attendance.  
It is too important a truft to be thus expo-  
fed. The Prefident in his wifdom. wil!  
provide againft this ev:l.

communicate to government, the state of  
the Mint with its issues for the pust year.  
The issues of silver coins, not withstand­  
ingthe mercantile embarrassments attend­  
ing the importation of bullion, have great­  
ly exceeded that of the year 1803 : and the  
advantage of a public mint, has long been  
sensibly experienced, by the greatest part  
j °f the deposits being issued in small coin,  
which has been found very beneficial to the  
citizens at large, under the late scarcity of  
Spanish dollars, occasioned by the great  
I exportation of them, for mercantile pur­  
\ poses.  
The quantity or gold bullion, has been  
equal to that of the last report, so that in  
| the past year the coinage of the precious  
metals has amounted to three hundred and  
; fifty-eight thousand nine hundred and  
! eighty three dollars. The particulars  
i wiil appear by the schedule N°. I, here­  
| with, to which the director begs leave to  
I refer.  
It is worthy of the President&#x27;s attention,  
that about eleven thousand dollars of ihe  
I gold coin is the produce of virgin gold,  
found in the county of Cabarrus, in the  
: of North Carolina, where it is said,  
| i very considerable quantity has been  
• found, since the last deposits, and will in  
. ali probability, he forwarded to the mint,  
: It i3 to be regretted, that this gold i» melt­  
j ed into small ingots, before it is sent tc  
i the mint, for the convenience of carriage ;  
but by which, there is reason to believe,«  
J considerable proportion of it is wasted., ii  
is also said, that the finest particles ar«  
neglected, and only the large grains ant  
! lumps sought after.  
The increased price of copper in Eu  
rope, and the quan ity on hand, have beer  
thought sufficient reasons, to confine tin  
coinage of cents to one press ; arid froir  
the last account from r.uroj»c, copper i1  
likely to be considerably inci eased in price  
which will render the coinage of cents Its:  
I profitable. The past year, there have beet  
, issued, seven hundred and fifty-six thou  
i »«nd, eight hundred and thirty eight cents  
| and one million and fifty five thoustnc  
three hundred and twelve half cents, cqu*  
  
• to twelve thousand eight hundred $e-lofty  
• Tour dollars and ninety-four cents as ap  
pears by the same schedule, K°. !. Thi  
• amount of the cost of copper and profit oi  
r i the whole coinage of cents this year, wil  
(bd seen in schedule N°. 2.  
The coinage of rhe year amounts in the  
whole, to the sum of.three hundred and  
(seventy-one thousand eight hundred and  
twenty seven dollars and ninety lour cents,  
. and the number of pieces to two millions  
, Forty-six thousand eight hundred and thir­  
1 ty-nine.  
| The expenses of the mint for the past  
! yeur will appear, by schedule, N°. 3, to be  
&#x27; reduced to a trifle more than sixteen thou­  
sand dollars.  
The dire£\or thinks it his duty to men­  
tion to the President, that very considera­  
ble dfficulty, as well as danger may arise  
to th&#x27;e public, from the officers and work­  
men ol the mint being exposed to be call­  
i ed out to attend militia meetings or on de­  
; tacltmenls. When large deposits of pre­  
: cious metals are passing through the mint,  
j and particularly when in fusion, it may  
j be of the most dangerous consequence to  
f have officers and men called away, or be  
I liable to fines for non-attendance. It is  
• too important a trust to be thus exposed.  
The president in his wisdom will provide  
against this evil. ,
