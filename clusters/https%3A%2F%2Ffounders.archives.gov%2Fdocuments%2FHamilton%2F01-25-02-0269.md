It is a matter of surprise to observe a proposition to diminish the revenue, associated with intimations which appear to contemplate war. The suggestions in the Message respecting the Barbary States, plainly enough imply, that treaties are found to be too feeble cords to bind them; and that a resort to coercive means will probably be requisite to enforce a greater sense of justice towards us. Accordingly, as a comment on this hint, we have seen a resolution brought into the House of Representatives, authorising the President to take measures effectually to protect our commerce against those states. Believing it to be a sound position, that these predatory nations will never be brought to respect sufficiently the rights of this country, whether derived from nature or from compact, without first being made to feel its power, there is no disposition to condemn the effacious employment of force. Yet, considering the maxims by which those states are governed, and the obstinacy which they have evinced upon other occasions, it is likely that a policy of this sort will be attended with considerable, and with no very temporary expence. This alone is conceived to be a conclusive reason against parting with any portion of our present income: nothing could be less adviseable, at a moment when there is the prospect, if not the project, of a general rupture with them.  
Hitherto the proposal for sacrificing the internal revenue, has been tried almost wholly by the test of expediency; it is time to put it to a severer test: to that of Right. Can the proposed abolition take effect without impairing the Public Faith?  
This is a question of infinite moment to the character of our Government—to the prosperity of our nation. If it is to be answered in the negative, it must be matter of profound regret, that a proposal which could give to it, should have come from the first Magistrate of the United States.  
It is hardly necessary to premise, by way of explanation, that to pledge or appropriate funds for a public debt, is, in effect, to mortgage them to the public creditors for their security. Retracing our financial system to its commencement, we find the impost and the excise on distilled spirits, repeatedly and positively pledged, first, for the payment and interest of the debt, next, for the reimbursement of certain instalments of the principal. It is true, the appropriation is qualified by the words, “so much as may be necessary,” but the public faith is engaged in express terms, that both the funds shall continue to be levied and collected, until the whole debt shall be discharged; with the single reserve, that the government shall be at liberty to substitute other funds of equal amount. It follows, that these two items of revenue constitute a joint fund for the security of the public creditor, co-extensive in duration with the existence of any portion of the debt: and it is to be inferred, that the Government, contemplating the possibility of a deficiency in one, intended that the other should serve as an auxiliary, and that the co-operation of the two should effectually guard the creditor against the fluctuations and casualties to which either singly, might be exposed. Anticipating, however, the possibility that the one or the other, in whole or in part, might in practice be found inconvenient, a right was reserved to exchange either for an adequate substitute. But it is conceived, that this does not imply the right to exchange the one for the other. The effect would be essentially different in the two cases: in the first there would always be two funds, aggregately of the same or similar force and value, to secure the creditor; in the last there wou’d be only one: from being double, the security would become single.  
This mode of reasoning is the only one, upon which the rights and the interests of the creditors can safely rest: It is plain and intelligible, and avoids the danger of erroneous speculations about the separate sufficiency of the respective funds. Admitting, however, for the sake of the argument, that this is too rigid a construction of the contract, and that when one of the two funds should have acquired a stable increase, which would render it equal to the purpose of the pledge, it might then be made to stand in the place of both: yet, surely, neither the purity of the public faith, nor the safety of the creditor, will endure the application of this principle to any other, than an ascertained result. Neither, certainly, will tolerate, that merely a reasonable ground of confidence shall authorise so material an alteration in the essence of the security which protects the debt.  
The foregoing reasoning as to the question of right, may be further elucidated by the particular provision in the Act  
Passed March 3d, 1791  
which introduced the excise on distilled spirits. After a permanent appropriation of the proceeds of the tax to the interest of the debt, it provides, that the surplus if any there shall be, at the end of each year shall be applied to the reduction of the principal; unless that surplus or any part of it should be required for public exigencies of the United States, and should be so appropriated by special “Acts of Congress.” While at this early period of our finances it was not thought expedient to appropriate this surplus absolutely to the Sinking Fund, it was contemplated that it shou’d not be diverted except for public exigencies. Gratuitously to relinquish it, is therefore contrary to the letter as well as to the spirit of the original institution of the fund. The like observations, though with less force, apply to the provision noticed in another number, respecting the surplusses of the revenue generally, which, as we have seen, are all appropriated to the Sinking Fund. At the session of Congress immediately succeeding any year in which such surplusses may accrue, they may be specially appropriated or reserved by law, for other purposes; but if this be not done, they are then to go of course to the Sinking Fund. To appropriate or to reserve, plainly, can never mean to relinquish. The true meaning of the provision appears, therefore, to be that, though Congress under the restriction expressed as to time, may appropriate or reserve those surplusses for other objects of the public service, yet if not wanted for such other objects, they shall continue to enure to the fund for the reduction of the debt, so long as by the laws regulating their duration they are to continue to be levied.  
Thus, on whatever side it is viewed, there is a temerity and a levity in the proposition which confounds and amazes. If, unhappily, it shall receive the sanction of Congress, there will remain nothing in principle of our system of Public Credit—nothing on which the confidence of the creditor can safely repose. The precedent of a fatal innovation will have been established; and its extension to a total annihilation of the security, would be a step, not much more violent, than that by which the inroad had commenced. But it is devoutly to be hoped, that the delirium of party spirit will not so far transport the Legislative Representatives of the nation, as to induce them to put the seal to a measure, as motiveless—as precipitate—as impolitic—as faithless—as could have been dictated, even by a deliberate hostility to the vital principles of our national credit. Peculiarly the guardians of the Public Faith, and of the Public Purse, they surely will not consent to impoverish the one, and the other, through an abject and criminal complaisance.  
  
It is a fact not unknown to himself, that abroad as well as at home, a diffidence has been entertained of the opinions and views of the person now at the head of our government, with regard to our system of public credit. This undoubtedly ought to have been with him a strong reason for caution, especially at so early a stage of his administration as to any step which might strengthen that diffidence; which was in the least equivocal in its tendency. Nor ought it to have been overlooked, that the interest of the State, and a regard for his own reputation demanded this caution. The appearance of instability in the plans of a government, particularly respecting its finances, can never fail to make injurious impressions. To a government, the character of which has not yet been established by time, the example of sudden and questionable innovations, may be expected to be in the highest degree detrimental. Prudent men every where are apt to take the alarm at great changes not manifestly beneficial and proper; a disposition which has been much increased by the terrible events of the present revolutionary æra. Yet, disregarding these salutary and obvious reflections, the President has ventured, in the very infancy of his administration, upon the bold and unjustifiable step of recommending to the legislative body, a renunciation of the whole internal revenue of the country; though the nation is at this moment encumbered with a considerable public debt; and though that very revenue, is, by the existing laws, an established fund for its discharge.  
What then are we to think of the ostentatious assurance in the Inagural Speech as to the preservation of Public Faith? Was it given merely to amuse with agreeable, but deceptive sounds? Is it possible that it could have been intended to conceal the insidious design of aiming a deadly blow at a System which was opposed in its origin, and has been calumniated in every stage of its progress?  
Alas! How deplorable will it be, should it ever become proverbial, that a President of the United States, like the Wierd Sisters in Macbeth, “Keeps his promise to the ear, but breaks it to the sense!”

| IT is matter of ‘surprise to observe a propo-  
sition to diminish the revenue, associated with in-  
timations which appear to contemplate war. The  
suggestions inthe Message respecting the Barba-  
ry States, plainiy enough imply, that treaties are  
fouid to be too feeble cords to bind them; anc  
  
  
  
  
  
that a resort to coercive means will probably be  
requisite to enforce a greater sense of justice to-  
wards us. Accordingly, as a comment on this  
hint, we have seen a resolution brought into the  
House of Representatives, authorising the Presi-  
dent to take measures effectually to protect our  
commerce against those states. Believing it to be  
a sound position, that these predatory nations will  
never be brought to respect sufficiently the rights  
of this country, whether derived from nature or  
from compact, without first being made to feel its  
power, there is no disposition to condemn the ef-  
ficacious employment of force. Yet, considering  
the maxims by which those states are governed,  
and the obstinacy which they have evinced upon  
other occasions, it is likely that a policy of this  
sort will be attended with considerable, and with  
no very temporary expense. ‘This alone is con-  
ceived to be a conclusive reason against parting  
with any portion of our present income: nothing  
could be less advisable, at a moment when there  
is the prospect, if not the project, of a general  
rupture with them.  
  
Hitherto the proposal for sacrificing the internal  
revenue, has been tried almost wholly by the test  
of expediency ;—it is time to put it to a severer  
test: to that of Right. Can the proposed abolition  
take effect without impairing the Pusiic Faitu?  
  
This is a question of ininite moment to the cha~  
racter of our Government—to the prosperity of  
our nation. If it is to be answered in the nega-  
tive, it must be matter of profound regret, that a  
proposal which could give rise to it, should have  
come from the first Magistrate of the United  
States.  
  
It is hardly necessary to premise, by way of ex-  
planation, that to pledge or appropriate funds fora  
public debt, is, in effect, to mortgage them to the  
public creditors for their security. Retracing our  
financial system to its commencement, we find  
the impost and the excise on distilled spirits, re-  
peatedly and positively pledged, first, for the pay-  
ment and interest of the debt, next, for the reim-  
bursement of certain instalments of the principal.  
It is true, the appropriation is qualified by the  
words, “ so much as may be necessary,’ but the  
public faith is engaged in express: terms, that doth  
the funds shall continue te be levied and collected,  
untilthe whole debt shall be discharged ; with the  
single reserve, that the government shall be at  
liberty to sudstitute other funds of equal amount. It  
follows, that these two items of revenue constitute  
a joint fund for the security of the public creditor,  
co-extensive in duration with the existence of any  
portion of the debt: and it is to be inferred, that  
the Government, contemplating the possibility of  
a deficiency in one, intended that the other should  
serve as an auxiliery, and that the co-operation of  
the two should effectually guard the creditor  
against the fuctuations and casualities to which  
either singly, might be exposed. Anticipating,  
however, the possibility that the one or the other, in  
whole or in part, might in practice be found in-  
convenient, a right was reserved to exchange ei-  
ther for an adeguate substitute. But itis conceived  
that this does not imply the right to exchange the  
oie for the other. The effect would Le essentially  
different in the two cases: in the first there would  
always be two funds, aggregately, of the same or  
similar force and value, to secure the creditor; in  
the last there would be only one: from being deu-  
ble, the security would become single.  
  
This mode of reasoning is the only one, upon  
which the rights and the interests of the credi-  
tors can safely rest: It is plain and intelligible,  
and avoids the danger of erroneous speculations  
about the separate suficiency of the respective  
funds. Admiiting, however, for the sake of the  
argument, that this is too rigid a construction of  
the contract, and that when one of the two funds  
should Lave acquired a stable increase, Which

would render it equal to the purpose of the pledge,  
it might then be made to stand in the place of  
both: yet, surely, neither the purity of the pub-  
lic faith, nor the safety of the creditor, will en-  
dure the application of this principle to any other,  
than ‘an ascertained result.—Neither, certainly,  
will tolerate, that merely a reasonable ground of  
confidence shall authorize so material an alteration  
in the essence of the security which protects the  
debt.  
  
Tue foregoing reasoning as to the question of  
right, may be further elucidated by the particular  
provision in the Act* which introduced the excise  
on distilled spirits. After a permanent appropria-  
tion of the proceeds of the tax to the interest of  
the debt, it provides, that the surplus if any  
there shall be, at the end of each year shail be ap-  
plied to the reduction of the principal; unless  
that surplus or any part of it should be required  
for public exigencies of the United States, and  
should be so appropriated by special “ Acts of  
Congress.” While at this early period of our fi-  
nances it was not thought expedient to appropri-  
ate this surplus adso/utely to the Sinking Fund, it  
was contemplated that it should not be diverted  
except for public exigencies. Gratuyitously to re-  
linquish it, is therefore contrary to the letter as  
well as to the spirit of the original institution of  
the fund. The like observations, though with less  
force, apply to the provision noticed in another  
number, respecting the surplusses of the revenue  
generally, which, as we have seen, are all appro-  
priated to the Sinking Fund. At the session of  
Congress immediately succeeding any year in  
which such surplusses may accrue, they may be  
specially appropriated or reserved by law, for other  
purposes ; but if this be not done, they are then  
to go of course to the Sinking Fund. ‘To appropri-  
ate or to reserve, plainly, can never mean to re-  
linqguish. The true meaning of the provision ap-  
pears, therefore, to be that, though Congress,  
under the restriction expressed as to time, may  
appropriate or reserve those surplusses for other  
objects of the public service, yet if not wanted for  
such other objects, they shall continue to inure  
to the fund for the reduction of the debt, so long  
as by the laws regulating their duration they are  
to continue to be levied.  
  
Thus, on whatever side it is viewed, there is  
a temerity and a levity in the proposition which  
confounds and amazes.—If, unhappily, it shall re-  
ceive the sanction of Congress, there will remain  
nothing in principle of our system of Public Cre-  
dit—nothing on which the confidence of the cre-  
ditor can safely repose. ‘The precedent of: a fatal  
innovation will have been established; and its ex-  
tension to a total annihilation of the security,  
would be a step, not much more violent, than that  
by which the inread had commenced. But it is  
devoutly to be hoped, that the delirium of party  
spirit will not so far transport the Legislative Re-  
presentatives of the nation, as to induce them  
to put the seal to a measure, as motiveless—uas  
precipitate—as impolitic—as fa/ihless—as could  
have been dictated, even by a deliberate hostility  
to the vital principles of our national credit. Pe-  
culiarly the guardians of the Pustic Fairs, and  
of the Public Purse, they surely will not consent to  
impoverish the one, and the other, through an ab-  
ject and criminal complaisance.  
  
It is a fact not unknown to himself, that abroad  
as well as at home, a difiidence has been enter-  
tained of the opinions and views of the person  
now atthe head of our government, with regard  
to our system of public credit. ‘This undoubtedly  
ought to have been with him a strong reason for  
caution, especially at so early a stage of his ad-  
ministration, as to any step which might strengthen

that diffidence; which was in the least equivocal  
in its tendency. Nor ought it to have been over-  
looked, that the interest of the State, and a re-  
gard for his own reputation demanded this caution.  
The appearance of instability in the plans of a  
government, particularly respecting its finances,  
can never fail to make injurious impressions.—  
To a government, the eharacter of which has not  
yet been established by time, the example of sud-  
den and questionable innovations, may be expect-  
edto be in the highest degree detrimental. Prudent  
men every where are apt to take the alarm at  
great changes not manifestiy beneficial and pro-  
per; adisposition which has been much increased  
by the terrible events of the present revolutionary  
era. Yet, disregarding these salutary and obvi-  
ous reflections, the President has ventured, in the  
very infancy of his administration, upon the bold and  
unjustifiable step of recommending to the legisla-  
tive body, a renunciation of the whole internal re-  
venue of the country ; though the nation is at this  
moment encumbered with a considerable public  
debt ; and though that very revenue, is, by the  
existing laws, an established fund for its dis-  
charge.  
  
What then are we to think of the ostentatious as-  
surance in the Inaugural Speech as to the preserva-  
tion of Pustie Farrn? Was it given merely to  
amuse with agreeable, but deceptive sounds? Is  
it possible that it could have been intended to  
conceal the insidious design of aiming a deadly  
blow at a System which was opposed in its origin,  
and has been calumniated in every stage of it  
progress? .  
  
Alas! How deplorable will it be, should it ever  
become proverbial, that a President of the United  
States, like the Wierd Sisters in Macbeth, “ Keeps  
his promise to the ear, but breaks it to the sense !”

have feen a refolution brought into the Houfe  
of Reprefentatives, authorifing the Prefident  
to take meafures effe€tually to proteét our  
commerce againft thofe flates. Believing it  
to be a found pofition, that thefe predatory  
nations will never be brought to reipeét fut-  
ficiently the rights of this country, whether  
derived from nature or irom compact, with-  
out firft being made to feel its power, there is  
no difpofition to condemn the efficacious em-  
ployment of force. Yet, confidering the  
maxims by which thofe ftates are’ governed,  
and the obftinacy which they have evinced  
upon other occafions, it is likely that a policy  
of this fort will be attended with contfidera-  
ble, and with no very temporary expenfe.  
This alone is conceived to be a conclulive  
reafon again{t parting with any portion of  
our be a income; n&amp;hing could be lefs  
advifable, at a moment when there is the  
profpeét, if not the projeét, of a general rup-  
ture with them.  
  
“Hitherto the propofal for facrificing the in-  
ternal revenue, has been tried almott wholly  
by the tefl of expediency ;—it is time to put tt  
to a feverer teft; to that of Rrght. Can the  
propofed abolition take effeét without wn-  
paring the Pusiic Farru?  
  
This is a queition of infinite moment to  
the charatter of our Government—to the  
prof{perity of our nation. If it is to be an-  
fwered inthe negative, it muft be matter  
of found regret, that a propofal which could  
wive rife to it, fhould have come trom the  
fir Magiftrate of the United States.  
  
It is hardly neceflary to premife, by way  
of explanation, that to pledge or appropriate  
f.® Is fora public debt, is, in effect, to mort-  
gage them to the public creditors for therr  
jecurtty. Retracing our financial fy{iem to  
its commencement, we find the iMpolt and the  
excife on diltilled {pirits, repeated!y and pof-  
itively pledged, firft, for the payment and  
intereft of the debt, next, for the reimbuffe-  
  
rent of certain infla!ments of the principal.  
It is truce, the appropriation is qualified by  
the words, ‘‘ fo much as may be necelflary, ”  
but the public faith is engaged in exprefs  
terms, that both the funds fha!l contiwne to  
be levied and colleéied, until the whole debt  
faall be difcharged ; with the fingle referve,  
that the -gaveryment fha!l be at liberty to  
fubflitute other funds of equal amount. It  
follows, that thelfe éwoztems of revenue con-  
ihitute a pornt fund for the fecurity of the  
nublic creditor, co-extenfive in duration  
with the exiftence of any portion of the  
debt : andit is to be inferred that the Gov-  
ernment, contemplating the poflibility of a  
deficiency im one, intended that the other  
fhould ferye as an auxiliary, and that the  
co-operation of the éwo fhould effectually  
guard the creditor againft the flu@uations  
and cafualties to which either /ingly, might  
beexpofed. Anticipating, however, the pof-  
fibility that éhe one or the ot/wr, in whole or  
in part, might in practice bé*found incon-  
venient, a right was celerved to exchange

either for an adequate fubjlitute. But it is  
conceived, that this does not imply the right  
to exchange the one for the other. The et-  
fet would be effentially different in the two  
cafes : in the firft there would always be  
two funds, aggregately of the fame or fim,  
ilar torce and value, to fecuresthe creditor ;  
in the laft there would be only one: trom  
being double, the fecurity would become  
fingle.  
  
This mode of reafoning is the only one,  
upon which the rights and the interefts of the  
creditors can fafely reft : It is plain and in-  
telligible, and avoids the danger of erroneous  
(peculations about the /eparate /uffictency ot  
the ref{pe€tive funds. Admitting, however,  
forthe fake of the argument, that this is too  
rigid a conftruétion of the contraét, and that  
when one of the two funds fhould have ac-  
quired a flable increafe, which would ren-  
der it equal to the purpofe of the pledge, it  
might then be made to ftand in the place of  
both: yet, furely, neither the purity of the  
public faith, nor the fatety of the creditor,  
will endure the application of this principle  
_toany other, than an afcertained refult.—  
  
Neither, certainly, will tolerate, that merely  
a reajonable ground of confidence {hall au-  
_thorife fo material an a!teration in the ef-  
fence of the fecurity which proteéts the  
debt.  
The foregoing reafoning as to the queftion  
  
of right, may be turther elucidated by the par.  
ticular provifionin the Aét* which introduced  
the excife on diftilied fpirits. After a per-  
manent appropriation of the proceeds of the  
tax to the intereft of the debt, it provides,  
that the furplus if any there fhall be, at the  
end of each year /hall be applied to the re-  
duction of the principal ; unlefs that furplus  
or any part of it fhould be required for public  
exigencies of the United States, and fhould  
be fo appropriated by fpecial ** A&amp;ts of Con-  
grefs.’’ While at this early period of our fi-  
nances it was not thought expedient to appro-  
priate this furplus ab/olutely to the Sinking  
Fund, it was contemplated that it fhould not  
be diverted except for public exigencies.  
_Gratuitoufly to relinguilh it, is therefore  
contrary to the letter as well as to the {pirit  
of the original inftitution of the fund. The  
like obfervations, though with leis force, ap-  
| ply to the provifion noticed in another num.  
ber, refpeéting the furpluffes of the revenue

IT 1s matter of furprile to observe a pro­  
position to diminish the revenue, associa­  
ted with inrimations which appear to con­  
template war. The fuggeltions in the Mes­  
sage reflpe&amp;ling the Barbary States, plainly

resort to coercive means will probably be

parting with any portion cf oar present in­  
come ; nothing could be lels advifeable, at  
a 2 moment when there is the profpedt, it not  
the proje&amp;, of a general rupture with them.  
Hitherto the proposal for facrificing the  
internal revenuoe, has been tried almost whol­  
ly by the test of expediency ;—it is time to  
put it to a severest test : tothat of Righs.  
Can the proposed abolition take eff(l witkout  
impairing the Pusric FariTu?  
This is a question of infinite moment to  
the chavaller of our Government—to the .  
prosperity of our nation. If it is to be an­  
{wered in the negative, it must be matter of  
profound regret, that a proposal which could  
give rife to it, should have come from the  
firt Magistrate of the United States,  
It is hardly neceflary to premise, by way  
of explanation, that to pledge or appropriate  
funds for a public debt, is, in effe &amp;, to mort­  
gege them to the public creditors for therr  
Jecurity. Retracing our financial {yflem to  
its commencement, we find the impost and  
the excise on AfNillcd spirits, repeatedly and  
positively pledged, fislt, for the payment and  
interest of the debt, next, for the reimburse­  
ment of certain inftalments of the principal,  
It is trae, the appropriation is qualified by  
the words, ‘‘fo much as may be necessary,”  
but the public faith is engaged in express  
terms, that botk the funds (hall continue to  
be levied and collefed, until the whole debt  
shall be dilcharged ; with the single reserve,  
that the government shall be at Lberty to  
JSubjtitute other funds of equal amount. It  
follows, that these two ztems of revenue cotre  
flitute a joint fund for the security of the  
public creditor, co-extensive in duration with  
the existence of zay portion of the debt :  
and it is to be inferred, that the Govern­  
ment, contemplating the poflibility of a de­  
ficiency in oze, intended that the ot/er thould  
serve as an aquxilliary,; and that the co-ope­  
ration of the two should effeCtually guard  
the creditor against the flutuations and ca­  
fualities to which cither singly might be ex­  
posed. Anticipating, however, the possibi­  
lity that the one or the otker, in whole or in  
part, might in praflice be found inconve­  
nient, a right was reserved to exchange ei­  
ther for an adequate substitute. But it is  
conceived, that tbis does not imply the right  
to exchange t/4e one for the other. The et­  
fe&amp; would be essentially different in the two  
cales: in the firft there would always be two  
Junds, aggregately, of the fame or similar  
force and value, to secure the creditor ; in  
the last there would be only ome from be­  
ir;g double, the security would become fip­  
gle.  
This mode of reasoning is the only one,  
upon which the rights and the interells of  
the creditors can fafely rest : It is plain and  
intelligible, and avoids the danger of erro­  
neous {pecalations about the /separate fuf­  
ficiency of the relpeflive funds. Admitring,  
however for the &#x27;l)&#x27;:kc of the argument, that  
this is too rigid a conftru&amp;lion. of the con­  
tra@ and that when oze of the rwo funds  
should have acquired a flable increale, which  
would render it cxtxal to the purpose of the  
pledge, it might then be made to stand in  
the place of both : yet, {urely, neither the  
purity of the public éitb, nor the faféty of  
the creditor, will endure the application of  
this principle to any other, than an ascer­  
tained telult,—Neither, certainly, will tole­  
rate, that merely a reasonable ground of con­  
fidence shall authorife so material an&#x27; altera­  
tion in the essence of the security which pro­  
tedls the debt, &#x27;  
The foregoing reasoning as to the quel­  
tion of ﬁﬁt, may be further elucidated by  
the particular provision in the A&amp;* which  
introduced the excifeon distilled fé)iri&#x27;cs. Af­  
ter a permanent appro| riation’ of the pro­  
ceeds of the tax tt?*fhepimereﬂ of the &quot;d?:bt»,  
it provides that the furplos if any there shall  
be, at the end of each year shall beapplied  
to the redullion of the principal ; unless  
that furplos or any part of it should be re­  
fed for_public cxigences of the United  
g::t&#x27;go&#x27;, and should be so a.ppfomia‘tcd by  
special w&amp;awfcay%m;&#x27; While at this  
early period of our me:i it w: -&#x27; ‘:a  
thought expedient to appropriate t is&#x27; sur­  
plus absolutely to the Sinking. Fund, it was  
contemplated that it should not be diverted  
. for public cxigences. —Graitoully  
m | u.fs#d’w contrary to the  
  
Appointed to publifb the _LAWS of the UNITED BTATEs for the Dijrict qf NewH;;np/bzre  
  
letter as well as to the {pirit of the original  
inflitution of the fund. The like oblerva­  
tions, though with less force, apply to the  
provilion noticed in another number, re­  
{petting the {urplufles of the revenue gene­  
rally, which, as we have seen, are all ap­  
propriated to the Sinking Fund. At the ses­  
sion of Congrels immediately {ucceeding a­  
ny year to which such {arplufles may accrue,  
they may be [pecially eppropriated or re-  
Jerved by law, for other purposes ; but if  
this be not done, they arc then to go of  
coutfle to the Sinking Fund. To appro­  
priate or to reserve, plainly, can never mean  
to refinquif/k. The true meaning of the pro­  
vision appears, therefore, to be that, though  
Congress, under the refriCtion exprefled as  
to time, may appropriate or reserve those  
furplufles for other objeéts of the public fer­  
vicey yet if not wanted for such other ob­  
jeéls, they shall continue to enure to the  
fund for the reduétion of the debt, so long  
as by the laws regulating sheir duration they  
are to continue to be levied.  
  
Thus, on whatever fide it is viewed, there  
1s a temerity and a levity in the proposition  
which confounds and amazes.—ls, unhappi­  
ly, it thall reccive the fanétion of Congress,  
there will remain nothing in principle of  
our {fyftem of Ppblic Credit—nothing on  
which the confidence of the creditor can  
fately repose. The precedent of a fatal in­  
novation will have been established ; and its  
exteniion to a total aanihilation of the secu­  
rity, would be a step, not much more vio­  
lent, than that by which the inroad had com­  
menced. Bat it is devoutly to be hoped,  
that the delirium of party (pirit will not so  
far transport the Legislative Representatives  
of the nation, as to induce them to put the  
{eal 1o a mealure, as motivelels—as precipi­  
tate-—as impolitic—as faithle/s—as could  
have been diftated, eveq by a deliberate hos­  
tility to the vital principles of our national  
credit. Peculiarly the guardians of the  
Pusric FaiTR, and of the Public Purse,  
they {urely will not consent to impoverith  
the one, and the other, through an abje&amp;t  
and criminal complaisance.  
-~ It is a faé&amp;t not unknown to himf{elf, that  
abroad as well as at home, a diffidence has  
been enterrained of the opinions and views  
of the person now at the head of our gov­  
ernment with regard to our system of public  
credit. This undoubtedly ought to have  
been with him a firong reason for caution,  
ctpecially at so carly aftage of his admimi­  
tration as to any step which might firength.  
en that diffidence ; which was in the least e-&#x27;  
quivocal in its tendency. Nor ouoght it to  
have been overlooked. that the interest of  
the State, and a regard for his own reputa­  
tion demanded this caution. The appear­  
ance of instability in the plans of a govern­  
ment, particularly re{pefting 11s finances, can  
never fail to make injurious impreflions.—  
To a government, the charalter of which  
has not yet been established by time, the ex­  
ample of {udden and questionable innova­  
tions, may be expefled to be in the highest  
degree detrimental. Prudent men every  
where are apt to take the alarm at great  
changes not manifeftly beneficial and pro­  
per ; a dilpofiton which has been much en­  
crealed by the terrible events of the present  
revolutionary 2ra. Yet, dilregarding these  
{alutary and obvious refletiions, the Presi­  
dent has ventured, in the very infancy of his  
adminiitration, upon the bold and unjuftifia­  
ble step of recommending to the legislative  
body, a renunciation of the whole internal  
revenue of the country ; though the nation  
1s at this moment encumbered with a con­  
{iderable public debt ; and though that very  
Tevenue, 15, by the exifing laws, an eftab­  
lithed fund for Its discharge. - g  
What then are we to think of the often.  
tatious aflurance in the Inaugural Speech as  
to the preservation of PusrLic Fairu ?  
Was it given merely to amuse with agreea­  
ble, but deceptive founds ? Is it possible  
that it could have been intended to conceal  
the infiduous design of aiming a deadly blow  
at a System which was opposed in its origin,  
and has been calumniated in every flage of  
its progrels ? .  
Alas ! How depiorable it will be, fhauld  
it ever become proverbial, that a Prcfident  
of the Uuited States, like the Wierd Siflers  
in Macbeth, ¢¢ Keeps Ais premise to tkhe ear,  
but breaks it to the sense I’ :

IT is a matter of furprife to obferve a propor­  
tion to dim ini In the revenue, affociated with in*  
tun.uions which ap ear to contemplate war.  
The iuggcftion ia the Mtdf&#x27;ge refpedting tie  
Bui .try otatcs, plainly enough ftnply that trea­  
ties are found te be too feeble cords to bird  
ihem ; and that a refort to coercive means will  
probably be requisite to enforce a greater fenfe  
of juftice to war ms. Accordingly, as a corn­  
in&#x27; nt on Jtlds hint, we have fee.i a refolstion  
brought joio the Houfe of Rcprefenta-ives., au­  
thor izing the Prefident u# lake meafires effe&lt;fl  
uallf to protect our commerce againlt thofc  
ftal.es. Believing it to b»- a f &gt;&lt;wd pofi ion. that  
thefe predatory nations will never be brought to  
refpeft ■fufficicntly the rights of this country,  
wether derived irom nature or iro« comp.ict,  
without firft ‘ eing made to feel its powe*, thete  
is n &gt; difpofiiion to condrm \ the efficacious em­  
ployment of fo ce. Yet, confidering the max­  
ims by which thofe Hates are g jerned, and  
tuc obiinancy which they have evinced upon  
other occasions, it is likely th it a policy of this  
fort wi 1 be attended with confidsrable, and with  
no very tctnyoTaryerpen.ee. This alone is conceit  
ei to be a conauuve reafon agaiaft parting with  
any portion of ©ur prefent income ; nothing  
cuU&#x27;d be left advTeable, at a moment when  
there is the profpeft if not the-project of a gen­  
eral rupture wi h them.  
H.tfrcrto the propofal of facrificing the inter­  
nal revenue, has been tried almoft wholly by  
the ted of expediency ; - it is t me to put it to  
a levered: teft : to thar of Right- Can the pro  
pojed abolition take ejfeft avithiut impatinj the Pub  
Lie Fai th ?  
This is a queftion of infinite moment  
to the cha»afler of our Government—to the  
profperity oi our nation. If it is to be an fiver  
ed in the negative, it rnuft be matter of pro.  
tound regret, that a propofal which could give  
rile to it, fhouiJ h ive come from ihe fi*ft Mag*  
lftrateofthe United States.  
  
It is hardly neccffary to premlfe, by way of  
explanation, that io pledge or appropriate funds  
for a public debt, is in elF:A, to mortgage them  
to the public creditors for their fecurity. Retrac­  
ing our financial fyfiem to its commenc mem,  
vve find the impolt an l the excife on dift lied  
fpitits, repeatedly and po&#x27;itively pledged, firft,  
forth* payment and interefl of the debt, next,  
for the rei nburfement of certain inftalments of  
the principal. It is due the appropriation is  
qualified by th: words, “ fo milch as may be  
neceffiry,” but the public faith is engaged in ex­  
prefs terms, that both the finds fha*l continue to  
be levied and colle&amp;ed until the whole debt  
lhall be difeharged -, with the fingle referve,  
that the government fhall be at liberty to fubjli.  
tute oiiier funds of equal amount. It follows,  
that thefe two hems of the revenue conliitute a  
joint fund for the fecurity of the public creditor,  
co extenfive in duration with the exiftencc of  
any portion of the debt : and it is to be in­  
ferred that the government, contemplating the  
poffibiiity of a deficiency in one, intended that  
the other ihould ferve as an auxiliary, and that  
the co-operation, of the two flio’ild eIF-dually  
guard the creditor agalnlt the fluctuations and  
caluaitie* to which eitherftnfy might be expof­  
ed. Anticipating, howevc , the potfibi&#x27;ity that  
the one or the other, in whole or in part, might in  
prallice be found inconvenient, a right was re­  
ierved to exchange cither f r an adequate fulfil tute ^  
but it is conceived, that this does not imply the !  
ri&gt;jht to exchange the one tor the Other. The  
tffed would be effeotially different in the two r  
calcs : in the fir ll there would always be two J  
funds, aggregately, of the fame or lim lar force 1  
and value, to fecure the creditor ; in the 1 aft  
there wrould be only one from being double, the  
fecurity would beccm: fingle.  
This mode oi realoning is the only one, upon  
which the rights and interds of the crediiors  
can lately iett : Ii is plain and intelligible, and  
avoids the danger of erroneous fpecillations a­  
bout th e ft per ate fffieicnev ol the refpe£ti»e funds.  
Admitting,however for tl e fakrotiheargum-nt, *  
&#x27;hat this is too rigid a conitru&amp;ion of the con- ,  
traA and that when one of ti e two funds ih ju d  
have acquired a liable increafe, which would  
lender it equal to the pur, of* of the pledge, \i  
  
might then be made to it and in the pi tee of  
ho*h t yet, finely, neither the parity of the pub*  
lie faith, nor the fafety of the creditor, will En­  
dure the application of th;$ principle t» any  
other, than an afcertaiceu refit It—Flei her, cer­  
tainly, will tolerate, that merely a reafmabk  
ground ofconfidence fh ill aitchorifc fo nvuetial ui  
alteration in the fcdence of the fecurity which  
prore&lt;fts the debt.  
The foregoing reafoning as to the queftion of  
right, may be further elucidated by the parti­  
cnlar proviSon in the A«ft* which introduced  
the excife on diftilled fpirits. After a permanent  
appropriation of the proceeds of the tax to the  
intereft of the debt, it provides that the furpluj  
if any there fttall be,at the end of each jczTjbullbe  
applied to the redu«ftbnof the principal • unlef*  
that furplus or any part of it fhou&#x27;J be required  
for public exigences of the United States, and  
fhould be fo appropriated by fpectil “ Acls of  
Congrefs 99 While at this early period of our  
finances it was not thought expo ieitt to appro,  
priate thi- furplus abfolutely to the Sinking Fund,  
il was contemplated that it fhoul d not be divert­  
ed except for public exigences —Gratuitous*&#x27; to  
rehnquifh it, is therefore contrary to the letter  
a? weil as to the fpirit of the original inftltu ion  
of the fund. The like obferv a lions, tho with,  
Jef, Force, apply to the orov.fion noticed in ano.  
ther number, refpe’fting the ftirpiulTes of the  
revenue generally, which, as we have leen, are  
all appropriated to the Sinking Fund. At the  
ieiton of Congrefs immediately f^cceeding any  
year in which fuch furpbfTes may accrue, they  
may be Fpeci ally appropriated or refer ved &#x27;»y law,  
tor other purpoies ; bt’t if this be not done,  
they are then to go of c mfe to th ? finking Fund.  
T o appropriate or to rtferce, plainly can never  
mean to reinquifl?. The trite mraning of the  
provifu n appears, therefore, to be that, tho  
  
Congrds, under the reftrttfirm ex: relied as rd  
time, m,\j appropriate or refervc thofe furplutTeS  
for other object- of toe pu »lio fervict, yet ff not  
wanted for iuch other onjedls, they Hull con­  
tinue to enure to the fund for the reduction of  
the debt, fo long a* by the laws regulating their  
duration they are to continue to be levied.  
Thus, on whatever fi te it is viewed, ti ere is  
a temerity and a levity in the pr©pofitoi&lt; wh ch  
confocr-ds and am »ze?.—I1, unhappily, it (hall  
receive the fanAion of Ccngrcfs, there w li re.  
main nothing in principle of our fyftem of Pub­  
lic Credit—nothing on which the confidence of  
the creditor can latch&#x27; repofr. The precedent  
of a fatal innovation will have been eihibltflied ;  
and its exfenfion to a total anni’. la.ior. of the  
fecurity, would be a Hep, not much more vio­  
lent, than that by which the inro ad had com­  
menced. But it is devoutly to (&gt;e hoped, th-»t  
the delirium ol pany fpirit will not B&gt; far tranf.  
port the Legiflarive Representatives of the na­  
tion, as to induce them to put the cal t a mea.  
fure, as m otivelcfi—as precipitate—i-. inapoli.  
tic—as faiikkft—as could have been deflated,  
even by a deliberate hdlility to th&lt; vital prin.  
ciples of our national credit. Peculiarly the  
guardians of the fublic faith, and oi th&lt;i  
public purfen they furely will not c mfent to im­  
poveridi the one, and the other, through an ab­  
ject and criminal coraplaifaoce.  
It is a fafl not unknown to himfelf, that  
abroad as well as at h*me, a difn fence has been  
entertained of ihe opinions and v «vvs of the  
perlbn now at the head of our government with,  
regard to out lyilem of public credit. This  
undoubtedly ought to hive been with him a  
llrong reafon for ca ltioa, efpecially at f&gt; early  
a ftage ofh s adrainiftration as to any ftep which  
might llrengthen that d.iliJe ce ; which was id  
the lead equivocal in its tendency. Nor ought  
it to have been overlooked, that the interell of  
the ftate, and a regard for his own reputation  
demanded this caution. The appearance of  
inftability in the plans of a government, parti­  
cularly refpevling its finances, can never fail to  
make injurious impreffions. To a government,  
the chara&amp;er of which has not yet been eilab­  
lifhed by time, the example of Bidden and  
queilionable innovations, maybe erpeClei to  
be in the hi g heft degree detrimental. Prudent  
  
men every where are apt to take the alarm ar  
great changes not roanifedly beneficial and  
proper ; a difpofition which has been increased  
by the terrible eve ts of the preient revolutiona­  
ry era. Yet. di.reg irding thefe falutary ani  
obvious reflexions, the President has ventured,  
in the very infancy of his admini Iration, upon  
the bold and unjuitifiable ftep of recomnlrndirtg

conliderable pU &gt;Wc debt ; and tho fh • t very  
revenue, is, by ihe exilling laws, an eUablifheJ  
fund for its dilchrrge.  
What then are we toth&#x27;nk of the oflen&#x27;at&#x27;ous
