Esteemed friend,  I have for years at times felt affection toward thee, with a wish for thy Salvation; to wit the attainment while on this stage of time (in the Natural Body) of a sutable portion of divine life, for otherways we know little more than the life of Nature, &amp; therein are in danger of becoming inferior to the Beasts which perish, in consequence of declining the offers of divine life, made to every Rational being.—But I have long had better hope of thee, &amp; have thought (particularly in our little quiet meeting yesterday), “that thou had been faithful in (at least) a few things, &amp; wish thou mayst be made Ruler over more, &amp; enter into the Joy of thy Lord &amp; into his Rest.”—&amp; it occurred in order thereto we shou’d becom Christians, “for he that hath not the spirit of Christ is none of his,”—&amp; this knowledg &amp; belief is strongly insisted on I think by divers of his apostles, who had personally seen, &amp; were eyewitnesses of  
			 his majesty; particularly in the Mount, &amp; of others who had not that View; which however was insufficient to  
			 perfect them, &amp; was taken away, that they might be more effectually turned to that spirit which leadeth into all Truth, whose power alone is able to Reduce the spirit of Nature to sutable silence &amp; submission.

have thought, (particularly in our little, quiet meeting  
of yesterday), that thou hadst been faithful in heart,  
in a few things, and wish thou mayest become  
ruler over more, and enter into the joy of our Lord,  
and into his seat. And it occurs in order thereto  
that we should become christians ; for he who hath  
not the spirit of Christ, is none of His, and knowledge  
is strongly insisted, I think, by divers of the apostles  
who had particularly seen, and were eye-witneses of  
His majesty, particularly on the Mount, and of others  
who had not that view, which however was sufii-  
cient to perfect them, and was to be taken away that  
they might be more effectually turned to that spirit  
which leadeth unto all truth,—whose power alone is  
able to reduce the spirit of nature into suitable silence  
and subjection. ,

WitmincTon, Eighth month 29, 1813.  
  
Esteemed Friend Thomas Jefferson: I have for years  
felt at times ‘affection toward thee, with a wish for thy  
salvation ; to wit, the attainment while on this stage of  
  
time in the natural body of a suitable portion of Divine |  
  
  
  
Life ; for, otherwise, we know little more than the life of  
nature, and therein are in danger of becoming inferior to  
the beasts which perish ; in consequence of declining the  
offers of divine life made to every rational being, I have  
long had better hopes of thee (particularly in our little  
quiet meeting, yesterday), that thou hast been faithful at  
least over a few things, and I wish that thou mayst be-  
come ruler over more, and enter into the joy of thy Lord,  
and into his rest ; and it occurred to me in order thereto,  
that we should become Christians, for he that hath not  
the spirit of Christ is none of his, and this knowledge and  
belief are, I think, strongly insisted on by divers of the  
  
  
  
Apostles who had personally seen and were eye witnesses  
to His majesty, particularly in the Mount, and by others  
who had not that in view ; which, however, was insuffi- |  
  
  
  
  
  
cient to protect them and was to be taken away, that they  
might be more effectually turned to that spirit which  
leadeth into all truth, whose power alone is able to re-  
duce the spirits of nature to suitable silence and submis-  
sion. Thy friend,
