ces must have been temporary. In this light was the undertaking viewed when I ventured on it. Being, moreover still farther advanced into the decline of life, I am every day more sensible that the increasing weight of years, renders the private walks of it in the shade of retirement, as necessary as they will be acceptable to me. May I be allowed to add, that it will be among the highest as well as purest enjoyments that can sweeten the remnant of my days, to partake, in a private station in the midst of my fellow citizens, of that benign influence of good laws under a free Government, which has been the ultimate object of all our wishes, and in which I confide as the happy reward of our cares and labours. May I be allowed farther to add, as a consideration far more important, that an early example of rotation in an office of so high and delicate a nature, may equally accord with the republican spirit of our constitution, and the ideas of liberty and safety entertained by the people.  
(If a farewell address is to be added at the expiration of the term, the following paragraph may conclude the present).  
  
Under these circumstances a return to my private station according to the purpose with which I quitted it, is the part which duty as well as inclination assigns me. In executing it I shall carry with me every tender recollection which gratitude to my fellow citizens can awaken; and a sensibility to the permanent happiness of my Country, which will render it the object of my unceasing vows and most fervent supplications.  
(Should no further address be intended, the preceding paragraph being omitted, the present address may go on as follows).  
In contemplating the moment at which the curtain is to drop for ever on the public scenes of my life, my sensations anticipate and do not permit me to suspend, the deep acknowledgments required by that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred on me, for the distinguished confidence it has reposed in me, and for the opportunities I have thus enjoyed of testifying my inviolable attachment by the most steadfast services which my faculties could render. All the returns I have now to make will be in those vows which I shall carry with me to my retirement and to my grave, that Heaven may continue to favor the people of the United States with the choicest tokens of its benificence; that their Union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free constitution which is the work of their own hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department, may be stamped with wisdom and with virtue; and that this character may be ensured to it by that watchfulness over public servants and public measures, which on one hand will be necessary to prevent or correct a degeneracy; and that forbearance, on the other, from unfounded or indiscriminate jealousies which would deprive the public of the best services, by depriving a conscious integrity of one of the noblest incitements to perform them; that in fine, the happiness of the people of America, under the auspices of liberty, may be made compleat, by so careful a preservation, and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire them the glorious satisfaction of recommending it to the affection, the praise, and the adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.  
And may we not dwell with well grounded hopes on this flattering prospect; when we reflect on the many ties by which the people of America are bound together, and the many proofs  
  
they have given of an enlightened judgment and a magnanimous patriotism.  
We may all be considered as the children of one common country. We have all been embarked in one common cause. We have all had our share in common sufferings and common successes. The portion of the Earth allotted for the theatre of our fortunes, fulfils our most sanguine desires. All its essential interests are the same; whilst its diversities arising from climate from soil and from other local &amp; lesser peculiarities, will naturally form a mutual relation of the parts, that may give to the whole a more entire independence than has perhaps fallen to the lot of any other nation.  
To confirm these motives to an affectionate and permanent Union, and to secure the great objects of it, we have established a common Government, which being free in its principles, being founded in our own choice, being intended as the guardian of our common rights and the patron of our common interests, and wisely containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, as experience may point out its errors, seems to promise every thing that can be expected from such an institution; and if supported by wise councils, by virtuous conduct, and by mutual and friendly allowances, must approach as near to perfection as any human work can aspire, and nearer than any which the annals of mankind have recorded.  
With these wishes and hopes I shall make my exit from civil life; &amp; I have taken the same liberty of expressing them, which I formerly used in offering the Sentiments which were suggested by my exit from military life. If, in either instance, I have presumed more than I ought, on the indulgence of my fellow citizens, they will be too generous to ascribe it to any other cause than the extreme solicitude which I am bound to feel, and which I can never cease to feel, for their liberty, their prosperity and their happiness

In this light was the undertaking  
viewed when I ventured upon it.  
Being moreover still farther advanced  
in tho decline of lifo, I am every day  
more sensible, that the increasing  
weight of years renders the private  
walks of it, in the shade of retirement,  
as necessary as they will be acceptable  
io me.  
&quot;May I be allowed to add, that ii  
will be among tho highest as well as  
purest enjoyments that can sweeten  
(he remnant of my days, to partake in  
a private station, in the midst of my

which has been the ultimate oiij &#x27;ct of

a nature, may equally accord with the  
republican spirit of Our constitution,

&quot;Under those circumstances, a re­  
turn to my private station, according

and to my grave, that heaven may  
continue to favor the people of the U.  
States with the choicest tokens ol its  
beniflceuce; that their union and broth  
erly affection may be perpetual; that  
tho free constitution, which is the  
work of their own hands, may be sa  
credly maintained, that its administra  
tion in every department may be  
stamped with wisdom and with viriue;  
and that this character may be ensured  
to it, by that watchfulness over public  
servants and public measures, which  
on one hand will be necessary to pre­  
vent or correct a degeneracy; aud  
that forbearance on the other, from  
unfounded or indiscriminate jealousies,  
which would deprive the public of the  
best services, by depriving a conscious  
integrity of one ol ihe noblest incite  
ments to perform them,- that, in floe,  
the happiness of the people of Ameri  
ca, under the uusptces ol liberty, may  
be mado complete, by so careful a  
preservation, aud so prudent a use of  
IhlS blessing, as Will acquire them the  
gdunous satisfaction of ruoomirrouUiug  
  
it to the affection, the praise and the  
adoption of every nation, which is yet  
a stranger to it.  
&quot;And may we not dwell with well  
grounded hopes on this flittering pros  
pect, when we reflect on tho many  
lies by which the people of America  
are bound together, and (he many  
proofs they have given of an enlight­  
ened judgment aud a magnanimous  
patriotism.  
&quot;Wo may all be considered as the chil­  
dren of ono common country. Wo have  
all boen embarked in one common causo.  
We have all had our share in common sol  
(brings and common successes. The por  
tiou ol i lie cartn uliuiied lor the theatre of  
du&#x27;r toil uiies, fulfils oar most sanguine do­  
sires. All Us essential interests are the  
same, whilst iho diversities arising from  
climate, irom soU and from other local  
and lessor peculiarities, will naturally  
form a uiutuil iclu&#x27;tim Of the parts, that  
may give to tho whole a mora entire iude  
puudortce, than has perhaps tallci to tho  
lot ol any other nation.  
&quot;To confirm (host) motived to an affec­  
tionate imr&#x27; permanent natal), and to e  
euro the great objects of it, ve havo eilab  
lishid a common government, which be  
ing free in us principles, boing lounded  
in our own choice, being intended as the  
guardian ol &#x27;our common rights, and the  
patron ol our common interests, and wise  
ly containing within itsoif w provision for

luul and Irieudly allowances, must ap­  
proach as near to perfection us any hu­  
iii. in work can aspire, and neuter than any  
which the annuls ol mankind have recur  
ded.  
&quot;With thoso wishes and hopes I shall  
make my exit from civil life,- and I have  
taken the same liberty ol expressing them  
which 1 lormerly used in olfering the sen  
indents which wcro suggested by my  
exit from military tub .
