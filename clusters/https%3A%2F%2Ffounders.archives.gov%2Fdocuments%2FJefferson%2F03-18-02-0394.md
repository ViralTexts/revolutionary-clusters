dear Sir.—  
Montezillo June 11th 1822—  
  
Half an hour ago I received, and this moment have heard read for the third or fourth time, the best letter that ever was written by an Octogenarian dated June the 1st. It is so excellent that I am almost under an invincible temptation to commit a breach of trust by lending it to a printer. my Son Thomas Boylston, says it would be worth five hundred dollars to any newspaper in Boston, but I dare not betray your confidence.  
I have not sprained my wrist, but both my arms and hands are so over strained that I cannot write a line—Poor Starke remembered nothing, and talked of nothing, but the Battle of Bennington—  
  
poor Thomson is not quite so reduced. I cannot mount my Horse, but I can walk three miles over a rugged rockey mountain, and have done it within a month; yet I feel when setting in my chair, as if I could not rise out of it, and when risen, as if I could not walk across the room; my sight is very dim hearing pretty good, memory poor enough.—  
I answer your question? Is Death an Evil. It is not an Evil. it is a blessing to the individual, and to the world. yet we ought not to wish for it till life becomes insupportable; we must  wait the pleasure and convenience of the great teacher.—Winter is as terrible to me, as to you, I am almost reduced in it, to the life of a Bear or a torpid swallow. I cannot read, but my delight is to hear others read, and I tax all my friends most unmercifully and tyrannically, against their consent.  
The ass has kicked in vain, all men say the dull animal has missed the mark.  
This globe is a Theatre of War. its inhabitants are all heroes. the little Eels in Vinegar and the animalcule in pepper water, I believe are quarrelsome, the Bees are as war-like as Romans, Russians, Britains, or Frenchmen. Ants or Caterpillars and Canker worms; are the only tribes amongst whom, I have not seen battles, and Heaven itself if we believe Hindoos, Jews, and Christians, has not always been at peace. We need not trouble ourselves about these things nor fret ourselves because of Evil doers but safely trust the ruler with his skies. Nor need we dread the approach of dotage, let it come if it must.—   Thomson it seems still delights in his four stories. and Starke remembers to the last his Bennington, and exulted in his Glory, the worst of the Evil is, that our friends will suffer more by our imbecility than we ourselves.—  
Diplomatic flickerings, it seems have not yet ceased, it seems as if a Council of Ambassadors could never agree.—  
In wishing for your health and happiness I am very selfish for I hope for more letters; this is worth more than five hundred dollars to me, for it has already given me, and will continue to give me more pleasure than a thousand—Mr Jay who is about your age I am told experiences more decay than you do.—  
  
I am your old friend—  
John Adams

Dear Sim,—Half an heur ago I ae ys  
this moment have heard read for the si and  
fourth time, the best letter that ever was wri

I have not sprained my wrist; but  
arms and hands are so overstrained that | :  
not write a line —-Poor Starke remembered ms  
ing and could talk of nothing but the battle  
Bennington. ***** is not quite so ni  
I cannot mount my horse, but I can walk  
miles over a rugged rocky mountain, and have  
done it within a month; yet I feel when si  
in my chair as if I could not rise out of jt.  
when risen, as if Il could not walk Across the  
room: my sight is very dim, hearing pre  
good, memory poor enough. y  
  
T answer your question—is death ap evi}.  
It is not an evil. It is a blessing tothe individ.  
ual, and to the world; yet we ought not to wish  
for it till life becomes insupportable. We must  
wait the pleasure and convenience of the “Great  
Teacher.’ Winter is as terrible to me as  
you. I am almost reduced in it to the life ofe  
bear or a torpid swallow. I cannot  
my delight is to hear others read; and I tay alf  
my friends most unmercifully and tyrannically  
against their consent.  
  
The ass has kicked in vain; all men say the  
dul! animal has missed the mark.  
  
This globe is a theatre of war; its inhabit.  
ants are all heroes. The little eels in yj  
and the animalcules in pepper-water, I believe  
are quarrelsome. The bees are as warlike as  
ithe Romans, Russians, Britons, or Frenchmen.  
  
: Ants, caterpillars, and cankerworms, are the on-  
iy tribes among whom I have not seen battles ;  
and heaven itself, if we believe Jews, .  
Christians, and Mahometans, has not always |  
been at peace. We need not trouble ourselves  
about these things, nor fret ourselves because of

this is worth more than five hundred dollars to  
me, for it has already given me, and it will con.  
tinue to give me more pleasure than a thonsand. ©  
Mr. Jay, who is about your age, I am told ex  
periences more decay than you do.

| Montezilio, June 11, 1822.  
  
Dean syx—Half an hour ago [ received, and this  
moment have heard read, for the third or fourth  
time, the best letter that ever was written by an  
Octogenarian, dated June Ist.  
  
o” * “ &gt; * ° # .o  
  
I have not sprained my wrist; but both my arms  
and bands are so overstrained that I cafinot write  
a line. —-Poor Starke remembered nothing and  
could talk of nothing but the battle of Bennington.  
*#**#* is not quite so reduced.—I cannot mount my  
horse, but { can walk three miles over a rugged  
rocky mountain, and have done it within a month;  
yet I feel, when sitting in my chair, as if [ could not  
rise out of it; and when risen, as if I could not  
walk across the room; my sight is very dim, hear  
ing pretty good, memory poor enough.  
  
I answer your question—is death an evil?——It is  
not an evil. It is a blessing to the individual, and  
to the world; yet we ought not to wish for it till  
life becomes insupportable. We must wait the  
a and convenience of the «Great Teacher.”  
  
inter is as terrible to me as to you. [am almost  
reduced in it to the life of a bear or a torpid swal  
low. I cannot read, but my delight is to hear others  
read; and I tax all my friends most unmercifully  
and tyrannically against their consent.  
  
The ass has kicked_in vain; all men say the dull  
animal has missed the mark. 3  
  
This globe is a theatre of war; its inhabitants are  
_all heroes. The little eels in vinegar, and the ani-  
malcules

Quincy, June 11, 1822.  
Dear Sir : Half an hour ago 1 received,  
nnd, this moment, have heard read, for  
the third time, the best letter that ever  
was written by an octogenarian, dated  
June 11 have not sprained my wrist,  
but both my arms and hands are so over­  
strained that 1 cannot write a line. Poor  
Starke remembered nothing and could  
talk of nothing but the battle of Banning­

mount my horse, but I can walk three

have done it within a month ; yet 1 feel  
when sitting in my chair as if I could not  
rise out of it; and when risen, as if I  
could not walk across the room. My  
sight is very dim, hearing pretty good,  
memory poor enough.  
I answer your question—is death nn  
evil ? It is not an evil. It i* it blessing  
to the individual, and to the world ; yet  
wc ought not to wish for it till life be  
comes insupportable. We must wait the  
pleasure nnd convenience of the •’ Grcut  
Teacher.&quot; Winter Is as terrible to me  
us to you. lam almost reduced in it to  
the life of a bear or a torpid swsllow. 1  
cannot rend, but my delight i* to hear  
others read, and 1 tax all my friends most

their consent. The ass lias kicked in  
vain, all men say, the dull animal has  
missed the mark. This globe i* a thea­  
ter of war; ila inhabitant* are heroes.  
The little eels in vinegar and the animal­  
cule in pepper water, 1 believe are quar­  
relsome. The bees are a* warlike a* the  
Romani, Brittons or Frcuchnien. Ants,  
caterpillars and cankerworms are the  
only tribes among whom I have not seen  
battles; and heaven itself, if we believe  
Hindoos, Jews, Christians, and Mahome­  
tans, has not always been st peace. We  
need uot trouble ourselves about these  
tilings, nor fret ourselves because of evil  
doers; but safely trust the Ruler with  
His skies. Nor need we dread the ap­  
proach of dotage ; let it come if it must;
