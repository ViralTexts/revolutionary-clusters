The Mode, in which the present Army has been collected, has occasioned some Difficulty, in procuring the Subscription of both Officers &amp; Soldiers to the Continental Articles of War. Their principal Objection has been, that it might subject them to a longer Service, than that for which they engaged, under their several provincial Establishments. It is in vain to attempt to reason away the Prejudices of a whole Army, often instill’d, &amp;, in this Instance, at least encouraged by their Officers from  
  
private &amp; narrow Views. I have therefore forbore pressing them, as I did not experience any such Inconvenience from their Adherence to their former Rules, as would warrant the Risque of entering into a Contest upon it: More especially as the Restraints necessary for the Establishment of essential Discipline &amp; Subordination, indisposed their Minds to every Change, &amp; made it both Duty &amp; Policy to introduce as little Novelty as possible. With the present Army, I fear, such a Subscription is impracticable. But the
