Head Quarters 12th Mar. 1783  
  
It is with inexpressible concern, I make the followg Report to your Excellency.  
Two Days ago, anonymous papers were circulated in the Army, requesting a general Meeting of the Officers on the next Day—A Copy of one of these papers is inclosed—No. 1. About the same Time, another anonymous paper purporting to be an Address to the  
Officers of the Army, was handed about in a clandestine manner: a Copy of this is marked No. 2.  
To prevent any precipitate and dangerous Resolutions from being taken at this perilous moment, while the passions were all inflamed; as soon as these things came to my knowlege, the next morng, I issued the inclosed Order No. 3—And in this situation the  
Matter now rests.  
As all opinion must be suspended until after the meeting on Saturday, I have nothing further to add, except a Wish, that the measures I have taken to dissipate a Storm, which had gathered so suddenly &amp; unexpectedly, may be acceptable to Congress: and to  
assure them, that in every vicissitude of Circumstances, still activated with the greatest Zeal in their Service, I shall continue my utmost Exertions to promote the welfare of my Country under the most lively Expectation, that Congress have the best Intentions of doing ample  
Justice to the Army, as soon as Circumstances will possibly admit. With the highest Respect I have the Honor to be Your Excellency’s Most Obedient &amp; most hume Servt  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
P.S. Since writing the foregoing another anonymous paper has been put in Circulation—a Copy of which is inclosed—No. 4.

A Meeting of the Genl &amp; Field Officers is requested, at the public Building, on Tuesday next, at 11 oClock—A Commissd Officer from each Company is expected, and a Delegate from the Medical Staff—The Object of this Convention, is to consider the late  
Letter from our Representatives in Philadelphia; and what measures (if any) should be adopted, to obtain that redress of Grievances, which they seem to have solicited in vain.

A fellow soldier whose interests and affections bind him strongly to you, whose past sufferings, have been as great &amp; whose future fortune may be as desperate as yours, would beg leave to address you.  
Age has its claims, and rank is not without its pretensions to advise—but tho unsupported by both, he flatters himself that the plain language of sincerity &amp; Experience will neither be unheard nor unregarded.  
Like many of you he loved private life, and left it with regret—he left it determined to retire from the field with the necessity that called him to it, and not till then, Not, ’till the enemies of his Country, the slaves of pow’r and the hirelings of  
injustice were compelled to abandon their schemes, and acknowledge America as terrible in Arms, as she had been humble in Remonstrance—with this object in view, he has long shared in your Toils and mingled in your dangers.he has felt the cold hand of poverty without a  
murmur, &amp; has seen the insolence of wealth without a sigh. But, too much under the direction of his wishes, and sometimes weak enough to mistake desire for opinion, he has till lately, very lately believed in the Justice of his Country. He hop’d, that, as the Clouds  
of adversity scattered, and as the sunshine of peace &amp; better fortune broke in upon us, the coldness and severity of government would relax, and that more than Justice, that gratitude, would blaze forth upon those hands, which had upheld her in the darkest stages of  
her passage from impending servitude to Acknowledged Independence, But faith has its limits as well as Temper—and there are points beyond which neither can be streched, without sinking into Cowardice or plunging into credulity. This, my friends, I conceive to be your  
situation—hurried to the very verge of both—another step would ruin you forever—To be tame and unprovoked when injuries press hard upon you, is more than weakness, but to look up for Kinder usage, without one manly Effort of your own, would fix your Character &amp; shew  
the world how richly you deserve those Chains you broke—To guard against this evil, let us take a review of the ground upon which we now stand, and from thence carry our thoughts forward for a moment, into the unexplored field of expedient.  
After a pursuit of seven long Years, the object for which we set out, is at length brot within our reach—Yes, my friends, that suffering Courage of yours, was active once, it has conducted the United States of America, thro’ a doubtfull and a bloody  
War—it has placed her in the Chair of Independancy—and peace returns again to bless—Whom?—a Country willing to redress your wrongs? cherrish your worth—and reward your Services—a Country courting your return to private life, with Tears of gratitude &amp; smiles of  
Admiration—longing to divide with you, that Independancy, which your Gallantry has given, and those riches which your wounds have preserved. Is this the case? or is it rather a Country that tramples upon your rights, disdains your Cries—&amp; insults your distresses? have  
you not more than once suggested your wishes—and made known your wants to Congress (wants and wishes, which gratitude and policy should have anticipated, rather than evaded)—and have you not lately, in the meek language of intreating Memorials, begged from their Justice,  
what you would no longer expect from their favor. How have you been answered? let the letter which you are called to consider tomorrow, make reply, If this then be your treatment while the swords you wear are necessary for the Defence of America, what have you to expect  
from peace; when your voice shall sink, and your strength dissipate by division—when those very swords, the Instruments and Companions of your Glory, shall be taken from your sides, and no remaining mark of Military distinction left, but your wants, infirmities &amp;  
Tears—can you then consent to be the only sufferers by this revolution—and retiring from the field, grow old in poverty, wretchedness, and Contempt; can you consent, to wade thro’ the vile mire of dependency, and owe the miserable remnant of that life to Charity, which  
has hitherto been spent in honor? If you can—Go—and carry with you the jest of Tories, &amp; the Scorn of Whigs—the ridicule—and what is worse—the pity of the world—go—Starve and be forgotten. But if your spirits should revolt at this—if you have sense enough to discover,  
and spirit enough to oppose tyranny, under whatever Garb it may assume—whether it be the plain Coat of Republicanism—or the splendid Robe of Royalty—if you have yet learned to discriminate between a people and a Cause—between men &amp; principles—Awake—attend to your  
Situation &amp; redress yourselves; If the present moment be lost, every future Effort, is in vain—and your threats then, will be as empty, as your entreaties now—I would advise you therefore, to come to some final opinion, upon what you can bear—and what you will  
suffer—If your determination be in any proportion to your wrongs—carry your appeal from the Justice to the fears of government—Change the Milk &amp; Water stile of your last Memorial—assume a bolder Tone, decent, but lively, spirited and determined—And suspect the man,  
who would advise to more moderation, and longer forbearance. Let two or three Men, who can feel as well as write, be appointed to draw up your last Remonstrance (for I would no longer give it the sueing, soft, unsuccessfull Epithet of Memorial) Let it be represented in  
language that will neither dishonor you by its Rudeness, nor betray you by its fears—what has been promised by Congress and what has been performed—how long and how patiently you have suffered—how little you have asked, and how much of that little, have been denied—Tell  
them, that tho’ you were the first, and would wish to be the last to encounter Danger—tho’ dispair itself can never drive you into dishonor, it may drive you from the field—That the wound often irritated and never healed, may at length become incurable—and that the  
slightest mark of indignity from Congress now, must operate like the Grave, and part you forever—That in any political Event, the Army has its alternative—If peace, that nothing shall seperate them from your Arms but Death—If War—that courting the Auspicies, and inviting  
the direction of your Illustrous Leader, you will retire to some unsettled Country, Smile in your Turn, and &quot;mock when their fear cometh on&quot;—But let it represent also, that should they comply with the request of your late Memorial, it would make you more happy; and them  
more respectable—That while War should continue, you would follow their standard into the field, and When it came to an End, you would withdraw into the shade of private Life—and give the World another subject of Wonder &amp; applause—An Army victorious over its Enemies,  
Victorious over itself.

The Author of a late Address, anxious to deserve, ’tho he should fail to Engage your Esteem, and determined, at every risque, to unfold your duty, &amp; discharge his own—would beg leave to solicit this further Indulgence of a few moments attention.  
Aware of the Coyness with which his last letter would be received; he feels himself neither disappointed; nor displeased with the caution it has met—Ye well knew that it spoke a Language, which ‘till now had been heard only in whispers, and that it  
contained some sentiments, which confidence itself would have breathed with distrust. But, their Lives have been short indeed, and their Observations imperfect indeed, who have yet to learn, that alarms may be false—that the best designs are sometimes obliged to assume  
the worst Aspects, and that however synonimous Surprize &amp; disaster may be in military phrase—in moral &amp; political meaning, they convey Ideas, as different as they are distinct.  
  
Suspicion, detestable as it is in private Life, is the loveliest trait of political Characters—It prompts you to enquiry—bars the Door against Designs, and opens every Avenue to truth—It was the first to oppose a Tyrant here, and still  
stands centinel over the Liberties of America—With this Belief, it would illy become me, to stifle the Voice of this honest Guardian—a guardian, who, (authorized by circumstances, digested into proof) has herself given Birth to the Address you have read, and now goes  
forth among you, with a request to all, that it may be treated fairly—that it may be considered before it be abused—and condemned, before it be tortured, convinced that in a search after Error, Truth will appear—that apathy itself will grow warm in the pursuit, and tho’  
it will be the last to adopt her advice, it will be the first to act upon it.  
The General Orders of Yesterday which the weak may mistake for disapprobation, and the designing dare to represent as such, wears, in my opinion, a very different complexion, and carries with it a very opposite tendency—Till now, the Commandr in Chief  
has regarded the Steps you have taken for redress, with good wishes alone. Tho’ ostensible Silence has authorised your meetings and his private Opinion has sanctified your Claims—Had he disliked the Object in view would not the same sense of Duty which forbad you from  
meeting on the third Day of this Week, have forbidden you from meeting on the seventh? Is not the same subject held up for your discussion, and has it not passed the seal of office, and taken all the solemnity of an Order—this will give system to your proceedings, and  
stability to your resolves, will ripen speculation into fact, and while it adds to the unanimity, it cannot possibly lessen the Independency of your sentiments—It may be necessary to add upon this subject, that from the Injunction with  
which the general Orders close, every man is at Liberty to conclude that the Report, to be made to Head Quarters, is intended for Congress—Hence will arise another motive for  
that Energy, which has been recommended—for can you give the lie to the pathetic discriptions of your representations &amp; the more alarming predictions of our friends?  
To such as make a Want of signature an objection to opinion, I reply—that it matters very little who is the Author of Sentiments which grow out of your feelings, and apply to your Wants—That in this Instance Diffidence suggested what Experience enjoins,  
and that while I continue to move on the high road of Argument and Advice, (which is open to all) I shall continue to be the sole Confident of my own secret—But should the Time come, when it shall be necessary to depart from this general line, and hold up any Individual  
among you, as an Object of the resentment or contempt of the rest, I thus publicly pledge my Honor as a soldier, and veracity as a Man, that I will then assume a visible existence, and give my name to the Army, with as little reserve as I now give my Opinions.I

is more than weakneſs, but to look up for kinder uſage, without one

81. Hz A QpART ERS, March 12th, 1783.  
1 T is with inexpreſſible concern I make the following report to your

Two days ago, anonymous notifications. were circulated in the army,  
  
  
army,*was handed about in a clandeſtine manner, it is alſo encloſed and  
marked No, II. To prevent any precipitate and dangerous reſolutions  
from being taken at this perilous moment, while the paſſions were all  
ipflamed,---as ſoon as theſe things had come to my knowledge,---the  
next morning I iſſued the encloſed order, No. III. and in this ſituation  
the affair now reſts,  
  
As all opinion muſt be ſuſpended until after the meeting, on Satur-  
day next,---I have nothing turther to add, except a wiſh that the mea-

J HE author of the late addreſs, anxious to deſerre, though he”  
| ſhould fail to engage, your eſteem, and determined at every riſque,

Aware of the coyneſs with which his laſt letter would be received;  
he feels himſelf neither diſappointed, nor diſpleaſed with the caution,  
it has met.---He well knew, that it ſpoke a language, which till now,  
had been heard only in whiſpers ; and that it contained fome ſentiments,  
which confidence itſelf would have breathed with diſtruſt,---But their  
lives have been ſhort, and their obſervation imperfect indeed, who have  
  
et to learn, that alarms may be falſe, - that the beſt deſigns are ſome-  
times obliged to aſſume the worſt aſpect; and that however ſynonymous,  
ſurpriſe and diſaſter may be in military phraſe, in moral and political  
meaning, they convey ideas, as different as they are diſtinCt,---Sz/p;c:ony  
deteſtable as it is in private life, is the lovelieſt trait of political charac-  
ters. It prompts to enquiry, bars the door againſt deſign, and opens  
every avenue to truth. It was the firſt to oppoſe a tyrant here, and ſtill  
 Nands ſentinel over the liberties of America.---With this belief, it would  
illy become me, to ſtifle the voice of this honeſt guardian.---A guardian  
who (authorized by circumſtance, digeſted into proof) has herſelf given  
birth to the addreſs you have read, and now goes forth among you, with  
a requeſt to all, that it may be treated fairly,---that it may be conſider-  
ed, before it be abuſed---and condemned, before it be tortured ;---con-  
vinced that, in a ſearch after error, truth will appear; that apathy itſelf  
will grow warm in the purſuit, and though it will be the laſt to adopt  
  
Her advice, it will be the firſt to act upon it. „  
  
The general order of yeſterday, which the weak may miſtake for diſ-  
approbation, and the deſigning dare to repreſent as ſuch, wears, in my  
opinion, a very different complexion, and carries with it a very oppoſite  
JJ e „„ „  
  
Till now, the Commander in Chief has regarded the ſteps you have  
taken for redreſs, with good wiſhes alone,---his oſtenſible ſilence has au-  
  
  
claims, Had he diſliked the object in view, would not the ſame ſenſe  
of duty, which forbad your meeting on the third day of the week, have  
forbidden you from meeting on the ſeventh ?-----1s not the ſame ſubs  
Ject held up for your diſcuſſion, and has it not paſſed the ſeal of office,  
and taken all the ſolemnity of an order ?- This will give ſyſtem to your  
Proceedings, and ſtability to your reſolves. It will ripen ſpeculation into  
fact, and while it adds to the unanimity, it cannot poſſibly leſſen the  
7ndependency, of your ſentiments, It may be neceſſary to add upon this  
ſubject, that from the injunction with which the general orders cloſe, e-  
very man is at liberty to conclude, that the report to be made to Head ·  
2 warters, is intended for Congreſs, Hence will ariſe another motive for  
that exergy, Which has been recommended, For, can you give the lie  
to the pathetic deſcriptions o; Dur repreſentations, and the more alarm

till now, had been heard only in whiſpers, and that it  
comained ſome ſentiments which confidence itſelf would  
have breathed with diſtrait. But their lives have been  
ſhort, and their obſervations imperſect indeed, who have  
yet to learn that alarms: may be falſe ; that the beſt de-  
ſigns are ſometimes - obliged to-affume the worſt aſpect ;  
aud that, however ſynonimous ſurprize and diſaſter may  
be in niilicary phraſe, in moral aud political meaning,  
  
they convey ideas as different a&#x27;s they are diſtin.  
Suſpicion, deteſtable as it is in private life, is the  
lovelieſt trait of political characters. It prompts you to  
enquiry, bars the door againſt deſign, and opens every  
avenue to truth. It was the fir ſt to oppoſe a ty rant here,  
  
  
With this belief it would illy become me to, ſtifle the

The general orders of yeſterday, which the weak may  
miſtake for diſapprobatiou, and the deſigning dare to re-  
preſent as ſuch, wears, in my opinion, a very different  
complexion, and carries with it a very oppoſite rendency.  
Til now the commander in chief has regarded the ſteps  
you have taken for redreſs with good pts nh alone. His  
oſtenſible filence has authoriſed your meetings, and his  
private opinion has ſanetiſſed your claims. Had he diſ-  
liked the object in view, would not the ſame ſenſe of du-

Age has its claims, and aul is not without i Its  
pretenſions to ad viſe: but, though unſupported by  
both, he flatters himſelf, that the plain language  
of ſincetity and r e will meier be unheard  
nor unregarded. F  
Like many of you, he loved private life; and  
7 it with regret. He left it, determined to retire  
from the field with the neceſſity that called him to  
it, and not till then—not till the enemies of his  
country, the ſlaves of power, and the hirelings of  
injuſtice, were compelled to abandon their ſchemes,  
and acknowledge America as terrible in arms as ſhe  
had been humble in remonſtrance. With this ob-  
ject in view, he has long ſhared in your toils, and  
mingled in your dangers.—He has felt the cold  
hand of poverty without a murmur, and has ſeen the  
inſolence of wealth without a igh—But too much  
under the direction of his wiſhes, and ſometimes  
weak enough to miſtake defire for opinion, he has  
till lately very lately believed in the juſtice of his  
country. He hoped, that as the clouds of adver-  
ſity ſcattered, and as the ſunſhine of peace and bet-  
ter fortune broke i in upon us, the coldneſs and ſe-

thoſe hands which had upheld her in the darkeit  
ſtages of her paſſage from impending ſervitude. to  
acknowledged independence. But faith has its li-  
mits as well as temper, and there are points be-  
-yond which neither can be ſtretched, withoat ſink-  
ing into cowardice or plunging into credulity  
This, my friends, I conceive to be your ſituation.—  
Hurried tothe very verge of both, another ſtep

this evil, let us take a review of the ground upon

more moderation and longer forbearance. Let two

the wound often irritated, and never healed, may at

THE author of a late addreſs, anxious to deſerve,  
though he ſhould fail to engage your eſteem, and  
determined at every riſque to unfold your duty and  
diſcharge his own, would beg leave to ſolicit the  
further indulgence of a few moments attention.  
Aware of the coyneſs with which his laſt letter  
would be received, he feels himſelf neither diſap-  
8 nor diſpleaſed with the caution it has met.  
  
e well knew that it ſpoke a language which, till  
now, had been heard only in Whiſpers, and that it  
contained ſome ſentiments which confidence itſelf  
would have breathed with diſtruſt. But their lives  
have been ſhort, and their obſervations imperfect  
indeed, who have yet to learn that alarms may be  
falſe ; that the beſt deſigns are ſometimes obliged  
to aſſume the worſt aſpect ; and that, however ſy-  
nonimous ſurpriſe and diſaſter may be ip military  
phraſe, in moral and political meaning, they con-  
vey ideas as different as they are diſtin&amp;t. |  
  
Suſpicion, deteſtable as it is in private life, is the  
lovelieſt trait of political characters. It prompts  
you to enquiry, bars the door againſt defign, and  
opens every avenue to truth, It was the firſt to op-  
poſe a tyrant here, and till ſtands centinel over the  
iberties of America, With this belief, it would illy

dreſs you have read, and now goes forth among you

be neceſſary to add upon this ſubject, that, from the

Like many of you, he lo#ed

to miftake defire for opinions,  
he has tll lately, very lately,  
  
believed in the juftice of his

the clouds of adverfity fcatter-

faith has its limits, as well as  
emper; and there are points,  
beyond which, neither can be  
ftretched, without finking into  
cowardice or plunging into cre-  
dulity. This, my friends, I  
conceive to bz your fituation.  
  
Hurried to the very verge of

my friends, that fuffering cou-  
rage of yours, was active once ;  
it has conducted the united  
ftates of America through a  
doubtful and a bloody war. It  
has placed her in the chair of  
independency, and peace re-  
turns again to blefs---whom ?  
---A country willing to re-  
drefs your wrongs, cherifh your

of gratitude, and {miles of ad-  
miration, longing to divide

this the cafe? or is it rather,

Have you not, more than

fhould have anticipated, rather  
than evaded. And have you  
not lately, in the meek lan-  
uage of intreating memorials,  
Becved from their juftice, what  
you would no longer expect  
from their favour ? How have  
you been anfwered ?  
If this, then, be your treat-  
ment, while the fwords you  
wear are neceflary for the de-

you to expect from peace,  
when your voice fhall fink,

fhall be taken from your fides,

litary diftinction left, but your  
wants, infirmities, and {cars ?  
Can you then confent to be  
the only fufferers by this revo-  
lution, and, retiring from the  
field, grow old in poverty,  
wretchednefs and contempt?  
Can you confent to wade thro’

If your determination be in  
any proportion to your wrongs,  
carry your appeal from the juf-  
tice to the fears of government.  
Change the milk-and-water  
ftyle of your laft memorial ;  
affumé a bolder tone--decent,  
but lively, fpirited and deter-  
mined, and fufpect the man  
who would advife to more mo-

can feelas wellas write, be  
appointed to draw up your laft  
remonftrance ; for I would no  
longer give it the fueing, foft,  
unfuccefsful epithet of memo-  
rial. Let it be reprefented in  
language that will neither dif-  
honor you by its rudenefs, nor  
betray you by its fears--what  
has been promifed by con-  
erefs, and what has been per-  
formed---how long and how  
patiently you have fuffered,  
how little you have asked, and  
how much of that little has  
been denied. Tell themthat  
though you were the firft, and  
would with to be the laft to en-  
counter dangers---though de-  
{pair itfelf can never drive you  
into difhonor, it may drive  
you from the field ;---that the

ver healed, may at length be-  
come incurable ; and that the  
flighteft mark of indignity

aifo, that fhould they comply  
with the requeft of your late

more happy, and them more  
refpectable. That while the  
war fhould continue, you  
would follow their ftandard in-  
to the field---and when it came  
to an end, you would with-  
draw into the fhade of private

would beg leave to folicit the  
further indulgence of a few  
moments’ attention. Aware  
of the coynefs with which his  
laft letter would be received,  
he feels himfelf neither difap-  
pointed nor difpleafed with

fentiments which confidence  
itfelf would have breathed  
with diftruft. But their lives  
have been fhort, and their  
obfervations imperfect indeed,  
who have yet to learn, that  
alarms may be falfe; that the  
beft defigns are fometimes o-  
bliged to affume the worft af-  
pest; and that however fyno-  
himous furprize and difafter  
may be in military phrafe, in  
moraland political meaning,  
they convey ideas.as different  
as they are diftinct.  
Sufpicion, deteftable as it  
is in private life, is the fovelictt  
trait of political characters.  
It prompts you to enquiry,  
bars the door againft defign,  
and opens every avenue to  
truth. It was the firft to. op-  
pofe a tyrant here, and {till  
ftands centinel over the liber-  
ties of America. With this  
belief, it would ill become me  
to ftifle the voice of the honeft  
guardian ;--a guardian, who,  
  
authorized by circumftances  
  
digefted into proof, has herfeli  
given birth to the addrefs you  
have read, and now goes forth  
among you, with a requeft to  
all, that it may be treated fair-  
  
dy; that it may be confidered  
  
before it be abufed, ahd con-  
demned before it be tortured ;  
convinced, that in a fearch af-  
ter error, truth will appear---  
that apathy itfelf will grow  
warm in the purfuit, and tho’  
it will be the laft to adopt her  
advice, it will be the firft to  
  
act upon it.  
  
The general orders of yef=

miftake for difapprobation,  
and the defigning dare repre-  
fent.as fuch, wear, in my opi-  
nion, a very different complex-  
ion, and carry with thema very  
oppofite tendency. Tillnow  
the commander in chief has re-  
garded the fteps you have ta-  
ken for redrefs, with - good  
wifhes alone.’ His» oftenfible  
filence has authorifed your  
meetings, and his private opi-  
nion has fan ctified your claims.  
Had he difliked the object in  
view, would not the fame fenfe  
of duty, which forbade you  
from meeting on the third day  
of the week, have forbidden  
you from meeting on the fe-  
venth? Is not the:fame fub-  
ject held up for your difcuf-  
fion ?. and has it not. paffed  
the feal of office, and taken all  
the folemnity of an ‘order?  
This will give fyftem to your  
proceedings, and ftabitity to  
your refolves. It will ripen  
f{peculation’ into fact; and  
while itadds to the unanimity,  
it cannot poflibly leffen the  
independency of your fenti-  
ments. It may be neceffary  
to add upon this fubjedt,  
that, from the injunction  
with which the general or-  
ders clofe, every man is at li-  
berty to conclude, that the  
report to be made to» head-  
quarters is intended for con-

s excited in the army can well be supposed,  
when it is known that the Commander in Chief was  
obliged to notice officially this annonymous address,  
and all his influence Was required to resist the tu­  
mult which it occasioned. The author was for some  
time concealed, and whether accident produced a  
discovery, or vanity, (for certainly the composition  
might inspire vanity,) induced the author to avow  
himself we know not, but it is now generally be­  
lieved, indeed it has not been doubted, that Gene­  
ral Armstrong, cur minister to France, is the  
Author^ he was at that time a Lieutenant in the  
army.  
A fellow soldier whose interest and affection bind  
&#x27;him strongly to you, whose past sufferings have been  
as great, and whose future fortune may lie as des­  
perate as yours, would beg leave to address you.  
Age has its claims, and rank, is not without its pre­  
tensions to advice. Hut tho’ unsupported by both, lie  
flatters himself that the plain language of sincerity  
and experience will neither be unheard nor unre­  
garded. Like many of you he lived a private life  
and left it with regret; lie left it determined to retii e  
from the field with the necessity that called him into  
it, and not till then ; not till the enemies of Ins coun­  
try, the slaves of power, and the hirelings of injus­  
tice were compelled to abandon their schemes and  
acknowledge America as terrible in arms, as she has  
been humble in remonstrances. With this object in  
view, he has long shared in your toils and mingled in  
your dangers. He has felt the cold hand of povertv  
without a murmur, and has seen the insolence of  
wealth without a sigh. But too much under the di­  
rection of his wishes, and sometimes weak enough to  
mistake desire for opinion, he lias till lately, very  
lately, believed in the justice of his country: He  
hoped that as the cloud of adversity scattered, and  
as the sunshine of peace and better fortune broke in  
upon us, the coldness nnd severity of government  
would relax, ar.d that more than justice, tlpt grati­  
tude would blaze forth upon those hands wnich had  
upheld her in the darkest stages of her passage from  
impending servitude to acknowledged independence.  
But faith has its limits as well as temper, and there  
are points beyond which neither can be stretched  
without sinking into cowardice, plunging into credu­  
lity. This, mv friends, I conceive to be your situa­  
tion. Hurried to the very verge of both, another  
step would ruin you forever. To be tame and un­  
provoked when injuries press hard upon you, is more  
than weakness ; but to lock up to kinder usage with­  
out one manlv effort of your own, would fix your own  
character, and shew the world how richly you de­  
serve the chains you broke. To guard against this  
evil, let us take a view of the ground upon which we  
now stand, and from thence carry our thoughts  
forward a moment into the unexplored field of ex­  
pedient.  
After a pursuit of seven long years, the object for  
which we set out, is at length brought within our  
reach. You, my friends, that suffering courage of  
yours, was active once ; it has conducted the United  
States of Amctica through a dreadful and blocdv  
war ; it has placed lit r in the chair of independence,  
and peace vetui ns again to bless whom i A country  
willing to redress your wrongs, cherish your worth,  
and rew. rd vour serv ices ? A country courting your  
  
smiies of admiration, louring to divide wi:h you that in­  
dependency which your gallantry has given, and those  
riches which your wounds have preserved ? Is this  
the ctse? or is it rather a country which tramples  
upon your rights, disdains your cries, and insults  
uur distresses ? Have you r.ot more than cnce sug­  
gested your wishes, and made known vour wants to  
congress? wants and wishes which policy and justice  
should have anticipated rather than avoided—And  
have you not late, in the meek language of tntreating  
memorial, liegged from their justice, what you could  
no longer expect from their favour, how have you  
been answered ? Let the letter which you are called  
to consider to-morrow, make the reply* Is this then  
your treatment, while the swouls y ou wear are ne­  
cessary for he defence of America ? What have vuu  
to expeat from peace, when your voice shall sink,  
and your strength dissipate by division—when thuse  
very swords the instruments of y our glory, shall be  
taken from your sides, and no remaining marks of  
military distinction left but your wants, infirmities  
and scars ? Can you then consent to be the only suf­  
ferers by this revolution, and returning from the field,  
grow old in poverty, wretchedness and contempt ?  
Can you consent to wade through the vile mire of de­  
pendency, and owe the miserable remains of that  
life to charity which lias hitherto been spent in ho­  
nour ? If you can, go on, anil carry with y ou the jests  
of torics and the scorn of whigs.—Go starve, and be  
forgotten. But if your spirit should recoil at this_  
if you have sense enough to discover, and spirit  
enough to oppose tyranny, under whatever garb as­  
sumed, whether it be the plain coat of republicanism,  
or the splendid robe of royalty—If you have vet  
learned to discriminate between man and principle,  
awaken, attend to your situation and redress your­  
selves.—If the present moment be lost, every future  
effort is vain ; your threats will then be as empty as  
your intreaties. Now I would advise you, therefore,  
to come to some final opinion, of what you will bear,  
and what you will sftffer. If your determination be  
in any proportion to your wrongs, carry your appeal  
from the justice to the fears of government—Change  
the milk and water style of your late memorial&#x27;_as­  
sume a boldtr tone, decent and lively, spirited and  
determined, and suspect the man who would advise  
to more moderation, towards longer forbearance. Let  
two or three men who can feel as well as write, be  
appointed to draw up your last remonstrance, for I  
would no longer give it the soothing, soft and unsuc­  
cessful epithet of memorial—Let it represent in lan­  
guage that w ill neither dishonour you by its rudeness,  
nor betray you bv its fears, what has been promised  
!»y Congress, and what has been performed—how  
long and how patiently you have suffered—how little  
you have asked, and how much of that little Ins been  
denied—tell them that you are the first and would  
wish to lie th* la«t, that would encounter danger—  
that despair itself would never drive you into disho­  
nour, yet it will drive you from the field—A wound  
often irritated and never healed, will at length be­  
come incurable, and that the slighest mark of indig­  
nity from Congress now must operate as the grave,  
and part you forever—that in any political event the  
at my has its alternative—if peace, nothing shall se­  
parate you from your arms hut death ; if war, court­  
ing the auspices and inviting the directions of  
your illustrious leader, veu wnl retire iuto some  
uncultivated country, smile in your turn, and mock  
when their fear • cometh: But let it represent  
  
alsff, that they should comply with the request  
of your late memorial, it will make you more happy  
and them more respectable—that should the war  
continue, you will follow their standard into the field,  
r ai}d that when the war comes to an end, you will  
withdraw into the shades of private life, and give to  
the world another object of wender and applause,&#x27; air  
army victorious over its enemies, and victorious over  
itself

A fellow-sold er, whose interests and affec-  
tions bind him strongly to you, — whose past  
sufferings have been as great, and whose future  
tied to receive six cents for every mile j fortunes may be as desperate as vours — would  
  
are hereby invested with complete and  
full power and authority, to take such  
deposition or depositions : any law or us-  
age to the contrary, notwithstanding.  
  
§ 3. And be it further enacted, That  
if any person or persons, shall give a no-  
tice to take a deposition or depositions,  
and shall fail to take, or cause the same  
to he taken, the party notified, if attend-  
ng agreeable to the notice, shall be enti  
  
unregarded.  
  
Like many of you, he loved private life, nil  
left it with regret. lie lelt it, detern..ned to  
the necess.lv tliat  
fore ; not, till the  
slaves ot power  
and hirelings of injustice, were compelled, to  
abandon their schemes, and acknowledge Ame-  
rica as terrible n arms, as she bad been hum-  
ble in remonstrance. With this object in view,  
he lias long shared in your toils and mingled  
ill your dangers ; be lias felt the cold hand of  
poverty without a murmur, and has seen the  
giowmg insolence ol wealth without a sigh.  
But too much under the direction of his wish-  
es, and sometimes weak enough to mistake de-  
sire tot opinion, lie has till lately — very lately,  
believed ut the justice of his country. lie hop-  
ed, that as the clouds of adversity scattered,  
and the sunshine of peace and better fortunes  
broke upon us, the coldness and severity of  
government would relax, and lh..t more than  
justice — that gratitude, would blaze forth up-  
on those beads and hands which had upheld  
her, in the da kesl stages of her passage, from  
impending servitude to acknowledged inde-  
pendence. But faith lias its limits, as well as  
temper, and there are points beyond which  
neither can be carried, without s nking into  
cowardice or plunging into credulity. This  
my friends, I conceive to he your present situa-  
  
ion. Hurried to the very verge of both, an-  
otiierstep would ruin ; ou io. ever. To be tame  
and unprovoked, when injuries press hard upon  
&lt;ou, is more than weakness ; but to look up  
tor kinder usage, without one manly effort of  
your own, would fix vour character for ever,  
and shew the world, how richly ■ ou deserved  
the chains jou broke The better to (juard  
against tins evil, let us take a view of the  
ground on which we now stand, ami thence car-  
re our thoughts forward tor a moment into the  
unexplored field ol expcd.ent.  
  
After a pursuit ot seven long years, the ob-  
ject for which we set out, is at length brought  
within our reach. Yes, my friends — that suf-  
fering courage of yours, was active once ; it  
has conducted the United Males of America  
through a doubtful and a bloody w ar : has pla-  
ced her in ease and independence, and p. ace  
returns to bless — whom ’ A country willing  
to redress your wrongs — cherish jour worth,  
aid reward your services ? A country, court-  
ing your return to private life with tears of  
gratitude and smiles of admiration ! — longing  
to divide with you that independency which  
jour gallantry has given, and those riches  
which your wounds have preserved. Is this  
the case ? Or is it rather a country that tram-  
ples upon your rights— d.sdains yourcries, and  
insults your distresses ! Have you not, more  
than once, suggested your wishes, and made  
known jour wants to congress ? (wants and  
wishes which gratitude and policy should have  
anticipated rather than, evaded.) And have  
you not lately, in the meek language of entreat-  
ing memorials, begged from their justice, what  
you could no longer expect from their favour !  
How have you been answered ! Let the letter  
which you are culled to consider to-morrow,  
make the reply !  
  
If such, then, be j&#x27;our treatment, while the  
swords jou wear are necessary for tiie defence  
of America, what have you to expect when  
vour voice shall sink, and jour Strength dissi-  
pate by division ? 1\ lien those very swords,  
tiie instruments and companions of \ our glory,  
shall he taken from your sides, and no remain-  
ing mark of military distinction be left, but  
jour wants, infirmities and scars ? (Jan you then  
consent to be the onlj sufferers by this revolu-  
tion, and retiring from tiie field, grow old in  
poverty, wretchedness usd contempt ’ Can  
jou consent to wade through the vile mire of  
dependence, and owe the miserable remnant of  
that life to chartiv, which has hitherto been  
spent in honour ’ If you can, go — and carry  
with you the jes. of torn s, and the scorn of  
whigs ; the ridicule, and what is worse, the  
pitj of the world : Go — starve and be forgot-  
ten ! But if your spirit should revolt at this ;  
if you have sense enough to discover, and spi-  
rit enough to oppose tyranny, whatever garb it  
may assume, — whether it be the plain coat of  
republicanism, or i lie splendid mile of royalty ;  
if j ou have yet learned to discriminate between  
a people and a cause -b. t ec n men and p nci-  
ples — awake — attend to ot.r situation, and re-  
dess yourselves. It tile present moment be lost,  
every future effort will be in vain, and \our  
tbreats hereafter will be as empty, as you; en-  
treaties now.  
  
1 would advise jou, therefore, to come to  
some final opinion upon what you can bear, and  
what vou will suffer. If your determination be  
in any proportion to your wrongs, carry j our  
appeal from the justice, to tire fears of govern-  
ment ; — change tiie milk and water stvle of  
your memorial, assume a I -older tone — decent  
hut vigorous, spirited and determined — and  
suspect Use man who would advise to more  
moderation and longer forbearance. Let two  
or three of our number, who can feel as v.a 1 a»  
write, be appointed to draw up your last re-  
monstrance — (for I would no longer employ  
tiie suing, soft, unsuccessful epithet of memo-  
rial) ; and let it represent, in language that  
will neither dishonour jou by its rudeness, nop  
betray you by its fears — what has been promi-  
sed by congress, and what has been performed ;  
how long and how patiently you have suffered ;  
how little you have asked, and how much of  
that little lias been denied. Tell them that  
though j ou were the first, and would wish to be  
the las&#x27;, to encounter danger — that though  
despair itself can never drive jou to dishonour,  
it may drive you f .nn the field ; that the w ound  
often irritated and never healed, may become  
incurable — and that the slightest mark of in-  
dignity from congress now, must operate like  
the grave and part you for ever : that in any po-  
itieal event, the army lias its alternative — if  
peace, that nothing shall separate vou front  
your arms but death ; if war, that courting the  
auspices, and inviting the direction of your il-  
lustrious leader, vou will retire to some vet un-  
settled country, smile in vour turn, and ‘mock  
when their tear cometh on.’ But lei it also re-  
present, that should they comply with the re-  
quest of vour last memorial -it will make vou

while the wai should continue, jou would fol-  
low their standard in the field ; and that when

The author of a late address, anxious to de-  
serve, though he fail to engage vour esteem  
fend determined at every risque to untold your  
duty and discliaty his own, would he ; leav  
to solicit the further indulgence of a few mo.  
tnents attention. Aware of the coyness with  
Which his last letter would lie received, lie feci-  
himself neither disappointed nor displease.;  
with the raution it lias met. He well lcncv.  
that it spoke a language Which, till new, had  
heen heard only in whispers, and that it con-  
tained some sentiments which confidence it-  
self would have breathed with distrust. Bu  
theif lives have been slioit, and their observa  
tions imperfect indeed, who have yet to learn,  
that alarms may be false ; that tile best de-  
signs are sometimes obliged to assume the  
Ivor St aspect i and that however synonymous  
Surprise and disaster may be in mili tary phrase,  
in moi al and political meaning, they come  
ideas as different as the words themselves ar  
distinct.  
  
Suspicion, detestable as it is in private life,  
is tlfe loveliest trail of political character. 1  
prompts you to inquiry, bars the door against de-  
signs, and opens every avenue to truth. It was  
the first to oppose a tyrant here, and still  
stands eentinel over the liberties of America  
AV i ill this belief it would illy become me to  
stifle the voice of this honest guardian  
guardian, who authorised by circumstances di-  
gested into proof, has herself given birth to  
the address you have read, and now goes forth  
among you with a request to all, that it may  
be considered before it be abused, and condemn-  
ed before it be tortured ; convinced that, in  
search after error truth will appear, that apa-  
thy itself will grow warm in the pursuit, and.  
though it may be the last to adopt her advice,  
it will be the first to act upon it.  
  
The general order of yesterday, which the  
weak may mistake for disapprobation, and tl.  
designing dare to represent as such, wears in  
my opinion, a very different complexion, and  
carries with it a very opposite tendency. Hith-  
erto, the commander in chief has regarded the  
steps you have taken for redress with good  
wishes alone ; but his official not ice has now  
authorised your meeting, and his private opin-  
ion has sanctioned your claims Had he dis-  
liked the object in view, would not the same  
Sense of duty which forbade you from meeting  
on the third day of the week, have forbidden  
you from meeting on the seventh ? Is not the  
same subject held up for your discussion &#x27; and  
has it not passed the seal of office, and taken  
all the solemnity of an order &lt; This will give  
system to your procedings, and stab: I tv to  
your resolves. It will ripen speculation into  
tact ; and while it adds to unanimity, it can-  
not possibly lessen the independency of your  
sentiments. It may be necessary to add upon  
this subject, that, from the -injunction with  
which tiie general order closes, every man is at  
liberty to conclude that the report to be made  
  
to head quarters is intended for congress.  
  
Hence will arise another motive for that ener-  
gy which has been recommended : for you can-  
not give the lie to the pathetic descriptions of  
your representatives, nor to the more alarming  
predictions of your friends.  
  
To such as make a want of signature an ob-  
jection to my opinion, I reply, that it matters  
Very little who is the author of sentiments  
wlj ich grow out of your feelings, and apply to  
your wants ; that in this instance, diffidence  
suggested what experience enjoins ; and that  
while 1 continue to move on the high road of  
argument and advice, which is open t» all, I  
shall continue to he the sole confident of my  
own secret. But, should the time come, when  
it shall be necessary to depart from tills gene-  
ral line, and hold up any individual among you  
as an object of resentment or contempt of the  
rest, I thus publickly pledge my honor as a  
soldier, and veracity as a man, that 1 will then  
assume a visible existence, and give mv name  
to the army with as little reserve as I now give  
my opinions

I would advise you, therefore, to come to some final opinion of what  
you can bear, and what you will suffer. If your determination be in  
any proportion to your wrongs, carry your appeal from the justice to  
the fears of government. Change the milk-and-water style of your  
last memorial. Assume a bolder tone ; decent, but lively, spirited, and  
determined; and suspect the man who would advise to more modera-

I would no longer give it the suing, soft, unsuccessful epithet of

you by its rudeness nor betray you by its fears, what has been pro-

how patiently you have suffered; how little you have asked and how

length become incurable ; and that the slightest mark of indignity from

That, in any political event, the army has its alternative : if peace, that  
nothing shall separate you from your arms but death: if war, that,  
courting the auspices and inviting the direction of your illustrious

that should they comply with the request of your late memorial, it  
would make you more happy and them more respectable, That while  
the war should continue, you would follow their standard in the field ;
