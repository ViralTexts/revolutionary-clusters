r themselves, or belong to themselves, only. Some isolated individuals, like specks in the great ocean, are so barren of aught that is good, as to exempt them from this general remark: but we belong to our families—to neighborhoods—to counties—to states—to nations, and to the world, according to our different abilities to serve the human race. Hardly any man’s character or talents are entirely his own—they are the property of the circle within which he moves: and every one may be respectively called upon to exert them for the common benefit of his sphere.  
Impressed with these sentiments, I am about to invite you to lend to the people of the United States, (to whom it belongs) the weight of your talents and character to influence the education of their children—to teach them, not only the reverence due to their Creator in the days of their youth, and the necessity of a due observance of the moral law, but to impress upon their tender minds an unextinguishable love of country and a profound respect for its republican institutions; so that, as they come to maturity, they may proudly feel that they are men;—and acknowledge no superior but God and the law.  
“Delightful task to rear the tender thought,  
And teach the young idea how to shoot.”  
  
I have exerted myself a little, according to the ability afforded, and I trust not without some profit, to build up a national character—but “the work is great and the laborers are few.” I am much encouraged, however, by the belief that a proud monument is erecting in
