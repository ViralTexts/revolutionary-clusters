Moses therefore does not Speak particularly of any other family but that of Adams, from whom they decended. Yet he frequently Shews us that there were others originated at or about the same time with Adam, and particulary  a Species of Mankind of more than the Ordinary Size called Giants.  
The following quotation without Troubling you with More, will be Sufficient to verify all that has been Alledged. “And it came to pass when Men began to Multiply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born Unto them, That the Sons of God saw the daughters of Men, that they were fair, and they took them wives of all which they Chose. And there were Giants in the Earth in those days [to wit when Men began to Multiply] and after that when the Sons of God came in unto the daughters of Men, and they bare Children to them, the same became Mighty Men, Who were of Old Men of renown.” Who were those Sons of God? Not the Angels, their nature renders them incapable of cohabiting with Women; and surely the Holy Men of that age would not be the first to sett the example of keeping Seralios of beautiful young women. It is very clear that Moses Means neither of these, but literally those very Men who came into the World at the Same time and in the Same Manner that Adam did; Th

This, we find, was of late occurence—towards the closing

The most difficult part of this history is that related in Gen. vi,  
1,2: “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the  
face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons  
of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took  
them wives of all which they chose,” &amp;c. After noticing the differ-  
ent opinions that prevail on this subject, our author adopts the inter-  
pretation which makes “the sons of God” “the sons of kings, rulers,  
or other great men.” The word unquestionably is thus used in the  
eighty-second Psalm: “I have said ye are gods (p-ti&gt;x): and all of  
you are children (or sons) of the Most High.” Yet it does not ap-

nowledged on all hands to be a sufficient  
one, our author goes on :—  
  
After the Fall, his descendants (ha-Adam)  
began to multiply on the face of that part of  
the earth they inhabited (ha-damah), and  
daughters were born unto them. And the sons  
of Fiohim—that is, the men of the sixth day’s  
creation—were struck with the fair complexion  
of these females. They, therefore, broke through  
all restraints of law and morals, for, being  
animal-men, they had no conscience. And being  
many in number, having had the whole Sab-  
batical period to multiply in, they seized vio-  
lently upon the females of Adam’s race, and  
forcibly took to them wives of such as they  
chose. They had a motive for it more than  
beauty, for when the sons of Elohim came in  
unto the daughters of men, and they bare chil-  
dren to them, the same became mighty men,  
which were of old, men of renown. Adam, by  
his plastic creation, was far superior to all the  
other races; and the sons of Elohim saw the  
vast improvement which intermarriage with the  
Adamic race conferred upon their offspring. The  
females of this race, therefore, became widely  
celebrated through the world, and the conse-  
quence was, that force and rapine became general.  
  
Are we dreaming? Is it really true that  
this sickening nonsense which we have borne  
with through some 300 pages has really been  
written by a clergyman for the edification of  
  
his flock in particular, and mankind in g

In the 6th chapter, Ist verse, “And it  
came to pass when men began to multiply  
on the face of the earth and daughters were  
born unto them, that the sons of God saw  
that the daughteis of men were fair, and

and who daughters of men? were not the  
son&#x27;s of God the descendants of the first  
creation that was made iu tho image of  
God ? But man, Adam, was created of the

presume that daughters were born to them.  
Judge ye who were the sons of God or who  
the daughters of men.  
Aud again there were giants in those

What is meant here by the phrase “Sons of  
God” was always to me a profound mystery ; but that  
the writer alluded to some kind of beings inhabit-

clear that they were not the descendants of Adam.

Tho reference of Baub Is to that rcmark­

tho flood Is explained:  
MAnd It came to pau, when men began to multiply on  
the face of the earth, and daarhtera wero bornnnto  
them, that the aone of God aaw tho daughteriof men

Tho meaning of this narrative, in tho opin­

The prime feature of the religion of  
the antediluvians was unity. The  
righteous became of one heart and of  
one mind, and there was no poor among  
them. They were one in all things  
The wicked were also united in their  
evil plans and defiance of the Almighty.  
Society was, like the period, youthful,  
vigorous, nay! tremendous! &quot;There  
were giants in the earth in those days;  
and after that, when the sons of God  
came in unto the daughters of men and

The religion of the tower builders, so

was traceable to Yahve and Eve, the other to Adam

This is the meaning of that verse which  
has puzzled some: And tt came to  
pass when men began to multiply on  
the face of the earth and daughters  
were born unto them, that the sons or  
God saw the daughters of men that  
they were fair, and they took them  
wives of all which they chose&quot;. (Gen.  
6:1-2). In the days of Enos, the son of  
Seth, the Sethites had already begun to  
call themselves by the name of the  
Lord (Gen. 4:26 marginal reading).  
They were the sons of God.  
It was these promiscuous marriages  
that corrupted the descendants of Seth,  
until there was only one righteous man  
left. This was the cause of the hood,  
which svert away the whole race, ex  
cept Noah and his household, from the  
face of the earth.

two principles developed in the lines of  
Cain and Seth respectively, have still
