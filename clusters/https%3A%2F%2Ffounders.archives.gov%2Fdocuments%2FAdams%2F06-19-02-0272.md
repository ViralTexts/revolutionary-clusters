&amp; the truth of an accusation may be pleaded in bar of a Suit, whether brought for words or for a libel. 4 Black. 150, &amp; Elsewhere.  
But on an indictment for a libel, it is held to be immaterial, whether the matter of it be true or false. And this law, Judge Blackstone says, is founded solely, upon the tendency of libels to create animosities &amp; to disturb the public peace; &amp; that the provocation, &amp; not the falsity, is the thing to be punished criminally. And some books say, the provocation is the greater—if true. The consequence of all which is, that a man ought to be punished more for declaring truth, than for telling lies, in case the truth contains a charge of criminality against any one.  
However in the case of the 7 bishops, Mr. Just. P., who, Ld. Camden said, was the only honest man upon the bench at that time, held that, to make the petition a libel it must be false &amp;c, &amp; that the case turned upon the truth of the assertion, that the dispensing power claimed by the King was illegal: &amp; he held the position of the bishops true &amp; right as to ecclesiastical laws &amp; all other laws whatsoever.

But charging a man, by word, writing or printing, with a crime, of which he is really guilty, is—damnum absque injuria, as Blackstone &amp; others justly observe. And in general, no doubt, it may be restrained from injuring the public or individuals, by propagating falshoods. But when the article says—“The liberty of the press is essential to the Security of freedom,” and, “it ought not to be restrained” does it not comprehend a liberty to treat all Subjects &amp; characters freely within the bounds of truth? Judge Black, says, (4, Vol. p. 151) the liberty of the press consists—“in laying no previous restraints upon publications,” &amp; not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. wherein he refers to a public Licenser or inspector of the press. That is, no doubt, the liberty of the press,—as allowed by the law of England. But the words of our Article, understood according to plain English &amp; common sense—make no such distinction, &amp; must exclude subsequent restraints—as much as, previous restraints.
