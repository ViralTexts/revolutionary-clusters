The next step of Great Britain in order of time, which is complained of by France, and the first of a really hostile complexion is the restriction on the exportation of Corn to France, by way of exception to a general permission to export that article.  
  
This was an unfriendly measure. It happened as far as I am able to trace it in the latter part of December 1792.  
But prior to these causes of dissatisfaction an alarm had been given by France to Great Britain.  
The Convention on the 19th. of November passed a Decree in these words—  
“The National Convention declare, in the name of the French Nation, that they will grant Fraternity and Assistance to every People, who wish to recover their Liberty; and they charge the Executive Power to send the necessary orders to the Generals to give assistance to such People, and to defend those citizens who may have been or who may be vexed for the cause of Liberty” which Decree was ordered to be printed in all languages.

2   “Nature and principles draw towards us England Scotland &amp; Ireland.

Her Decree of the 15 of December is one of them. This decree, extraordinary in every respect, which contemplates the total subversion of all the antient establishments of every country into which the arms of France should be carried—has the following article—  
“The French Nation declare—That it will treat as enemies the People, who refusing or renouncing Liberty and Equality, are desirous of preserving their Prince and privileged Casts, or of entering into an accommodation with them. The Nation promises and engages not to lay down its arms, until the Sovereignty and Liberty of the People, on whose Territory the French Armies shall have entered shall be established and not to consent to any arrangement or Treaty with the Prince and privileged persons so dispossessed, with whom the Republic is at war.”
