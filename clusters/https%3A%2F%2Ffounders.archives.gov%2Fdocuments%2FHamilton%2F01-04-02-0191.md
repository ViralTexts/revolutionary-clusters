To the People of the State of New-York.  
I FLATTER myself it has been clearly shewn in my last number, that the particular States, under the proposed Constitution, would have CO-EQUAL authority with the Union in the article of revenue, except as to duties on imports. As this leaves open to the States far the greatest part of the resources of the community, there can be no color for the assertion, that they would not possess means, as abundant as could be desired, for the supply of their own wants, independent of all external control. That the field is sufficiently wide, will more fully appear, when we come to advert to the inconsiderable share of the public expences, for which, it will fall to the lot of the State Governments to provide.  
To argue upon abstract principles, that this co-ordinate authority cannot exist, is to set up supposition and theory, against fact and reality. However proper such reasonings might be, to show that a thing ought not to exist, they are wholly to be rejected, when they are made use of to prove that it does not exist, contrary to the evidence of the fact itself. It is well known, that in the Roman Republic, the Legislative authority in the last resort, resided for ages in two different political bodies; not as branches of the same Legislature, but as distinct and independent Legislatures, in each of which an opposite interest prevailed; in one, the Patrician—in the other, the Plebeian. Many arguments might have been adduced to prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory authorities, each having power to annul or repeal the acts of the other. But a man would have been regarded as frantic, who should have attempted at Rome, to disprove their existence. It will readily be understood, that I allude to the Comitia Centuriata, and Comitia Tributa. The former, in which the people voted by Centuries, was so arranged as to give a superiority to the Patrician interest: in the latter, in which numbers prevailed, the Plebeian interest had an entire predominancy. And yet these two Legislatures co-existed for ages, and the Roman Republic attained to the utmost height of human greatness.  
In the case particularly under consideration, there is no such contradiction as appears in the example cited, there is no power on either side to annul the acts of the other. And in practice, there is little reason to apprehend any inconvenience; because, in a short course of time, the wants of the States will naturally reduce themselves within a very narrow compass; and in t

 inclined to resort.  
To form a more precise judgment of the true merits of this question, it will be well to advert to the proportion between the objects that will require a Federal provision in respect to revenue; and those which will require a State provision. We shall discover that the former are altogether unlimited; and, that the latter are circumscribed within very moderate bounds. In pursuing this enquiry, we must bear in mind, that we are not to confine our view to the present period, but to look forward to remote futurity. Constitutions of civil Government are not to be framed upon a calculation of existing exigencies; but upon a combination of these, with the probable exigencies of ages, according to the natural and tried course of human affairs. Nothing therefore can be more fallacious, than to infer the extent of any power, proper to be lodged in the National Government, from an estimate of its immediate necessities. There ought to be a CAPACITY to provide for future contingencies, as they may happen; and, as these are illimitable in their nature, it is impossible safely to limit that capacity. It is true, perhaps, that a computation might be made, with sufficient accuracy to answer the purpose of the quantity of revenue, requisite to discharge the subsisting engagements of the Union, and to maintain those establishments, which for some time to come, would suffice in time of peace. But would it be wise, or would it not rather be the extreme of folly, to stop at this point, and to leave the Government entrusted with the care of the National defence, in a state of absolute incapacity to provide for the protection of the community, against future invasions of the public peace, by foreign war, or domestic convulsions? If, on the contrary, we ought to exceed this point, where can we stop, short of an indefinite power of providing for emergencies as they might arise? Though it is easy to assert, in general terms, the possibility of forming a rational judgment of a due provision against probable dangers; yet we may safely challenge those who make the assertion, to bring forward their data, and may affirm, that they would be found as vague and uncertain, as any that could be produced to establish the probable duration of the world. Observations, confined to the mere prospects of internal attacks, can deserve no weight, though even these will admit of no satisfactory calculation: But if we mean to be a commercial people, it must form a part of our policy, to be able one day to defend that commerce. The support of a navy, and of naval wars must baffle all the efforts of political arithmetic admitting that we ought to try the novel and absurd experiment in politics, of tying up the hands of Government

disturbed from some other cause, or from some other quarter? Let us recollect, that peace or war, will not always be left to our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be, we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the ambition of others. Who could have imagined, at the conclusion of the last war, that France and Britain, wearied and exhausted as they both were, would so soon have looked with so hostile an aspect upon each other? To judge from the history of mankind, we shall be compelled to conclude, that the fiery and destructive passions of war, reign in the human breast, with much more powerful sway, than the mild and beneficent sentiments of peace; and, that to model our political systems upon speculations of lasting tranquility, is to calculate on the weaker springs of the human character.

are necessary to guard the body politic, against these two most mortal diseases of society. The expences arising from those institutions, which are relative to the mere domestic police of a State—to the support of its Legislative, Executive and Judicial departments, with their different appendages, and to the internal encouragement of agriculture and manufactures, (which will comprehend almost all the objects of State expenditure) are insignificant, in comparison with those which relate to the National defence.  
In the kingdom of Great-Britain, where all the ostentatious apparatus of Monarchy is to be provided for, not above a fifteenth part of the annual income of the nation is appropriated to the class of expences last mentioned; the o

ween the objects of Federal and State expenditures. It is true that several of the States separately are incumbered with considerable debts, which are an excrescence of the late war. But when these are discharged, the only call for revenue of any consequence, which the State Governments will continue to experience, will be for the mere support of their respective civil lists; to which, if we add all contingencies, the total amount in every State, ought not to exceed two hundred thousand pounds.

, that, “A CONCURRENT JURISDICTION in the article of taxation, was the only admissible substitute for an entire subordination, in respect to this branch of power, of the State authority to that of the Union.” Any separation of the objects of revenue, that could have been fallen upon, would have amounted to a sacrifice of the great INTERESTS of the Union to the POWER of the individual States. The Convention thought the concurrent jurisdiction preferable to that subordination; and it is evident that it has at least the merit of reconciling an indefinite constitutional power of taxation in the Federal Government, with an adequate and independent power in the States to provide for their own necessities. There remain a few other lights, in which this important subject of taxatio

* Tt is well known that, in the Roman Republic, the legislative autho-  
  
_ rity, in the last resort, resided for ages in two different political bodies,;  
  
not as branches of the same legislature, but as distinct and independent  
legislatures ; to each of which an opposite interest prevailed, in one the  
Patrician, in the other the Plebian. Many arguments might have been  
  
_adduced,to prove the unfitness of two such seemingly contradictory  
  
authorities, each having power to annul or repeal the Acts of the other.  
But aman would have been regarded as frantic, who should have at-  
tempted at Rome to disprove their existence. And yet these two le-  
gislatures existed for ages, and the Roman Republic attained to the pin-  
nacle of haman greatness.”’  
  
Mr. Jefierson, in the Kentacky Resolutions, maintains the doctrine  
we contended for, in terms vot to be mistaken: he who runs may read  
it. The following seutiments, from the pen of that great man, covers  
the whole ground :  
  
“The several States composing the United States of America, are  
not united on the principle of unlimited submission to the General Go-  
vernment; but that by compact under the style and title of a Coustite-  
tion for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted

44 We must bear in mind that we are not to con­

4 forward to remote futurity. Constitutions of  
4 civil government are not to be framed upon a  
? calculation of existing exigencies ; but upon a  
4 combination of these, with the probable exigen­  
4 cies of ages, according to the natural and tried  
4 course ef human affairs. Nothing, therefore, can  
4 be more fallacious, than to infer the extent of any  
4 power proper to be lodged in the National Gov­  
4 ernment, from an estimate of its immediate neoes­  
4 sities. There ought to be a capacity to provide  
&#x27;for future contingencies,as they may happen; and  
4 as these are illimitable in their nature, so it is  
4 impossible safely to limit that capacity. It is  
4 true, perhaps, that a computation might be made,  
4 with sufficient accuracy to answer the purpose, of  
4 ttie quantity of revenue requisite to discharge the  
4 subsisting engagements of the Union, and to main­  
4 tain those establishments which, for some time to  
4 come, would suffice in time of peace. But would  
4 it be wise, or would it not rather be the extreme  
? of folly, to stop at this point, and io leave the  
4 Government, entrusted with the care of the Na­  
4 tional defence, in a state of absolute incanacity to  
? provide for the protection of the community  
4 against future invasions of the public peace, by  
4 foreign war or domestic convulsions ? If we must  
4 be obliged to exceed this point, where can we  
4 stop short of an indefinite power of providing for  
4 emergencies as they may arise ? Though it be  
4 easy to assert, in general terms, the possibility of  
4 forming a rational judgment of a due provision  
4 against probable dangers, yet we may safely  
challenge those who make the assertion to  
| bring forward their data, and may affirm that  
4 they would be found as vague and uncertain as  
? any that could be produced to establish the pro­  
4 &#x27;,a) e duration of the world. Observations, con­  
&#x27; fined to the mere prospects of internal attacks, can  
&#x27; deserve no weight, though even these will admit  
&#x27; o! no satisfactory calculations : but, if we mean to

policy to be able one day to defend that com­  
merce. 1 he support of a navy, and of naval
