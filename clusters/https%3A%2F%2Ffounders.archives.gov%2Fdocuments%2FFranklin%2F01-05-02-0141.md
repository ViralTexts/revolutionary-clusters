Philada. March 1. 1755.  
I am but just returned from a long Journey, after near 6 Months Absence, and find your Favour of Sept. 29. by which I have the agreable Advice that you expect to be able to remit me something in Smith’s Affairs very soon.  
As to the Thickness of Wire necessary or sufficient to conduct a large Quantity of Lightning; concerning which you desire my Sentiments; you will find something on that Head in Pages 124, and 125, of the enclos’d Pamphlet, which please to accept. And I may add, that in my late Journey I saw an Instance of a very great Quantity of Lightning conducted by a Wire no bigger than a common Knitting Needle. It was at Newbury in New England, where the Spire of the Church Steeple being 70 foot in height above the Belfrey was split all to pieces and thrown about the Street in Fragments; from the Bell down to the Clock, plac’d in the Steeple 20 foot below the Bell, there was the small Wire abovemention’d which communicated the Motion of the Clock to the Hammer striking the Hour on the Bell. As far as the Wire extended, no Part of the Steeple was hurt by the Lightning, nor below the Clock as far as the Pendulum Rod reached; but from the End of the Rod, downwards, the Lightning rent the Steeple surprizingly. The Pendulum Rod was about the thickness of a small Tobacco Pipe Stem, and conducted the Whole without Damage to its own Substance, except that the End where the Lightning was accumulated, it appeared melted [as] much as made a small Drop. But the Clock Wire was [blown?] all to Smoke, and smutted the Wall where it passed in a broad black Track, and also the Cieling under which it was carried horizontally. No more of it was left than about an Inch and half next the Tail of the Hammer, and as much joining to the Clock. Yet this is observable, that tho’ it was so small, as not to be sufficient to conduct the Quantity with Safety to its own Substance, yet it did conduct it, so as to secure all that Part of the Building. Excuse this Scrawl which I have not time to copy fair. I am, with much Respect, Sir Your very humble Servant  
B Franklin  
PS. I have just been reading a similar Instance taken from the Journal des Sçavans, for 1676, page 113. viz.  
“En 1676. le tonnerre écrasa le clocher de l’Abbaye de Saint Medard de Soissons; la foudre se porta à une grande Distance le long des fils d’archal qui communiquoient à l’horloge; elle fondit ces cordes metalliques sans faire d’autres desordres dans tout le trajet.”

Sir-I arn but just returned from a long Journey, afe  
ter near o Months Absence and find your Fav of  
sept.29, by which I have the agreeable Advice that  
yon expect to be able to remit me something in Smith&#x27;s

As to the Thickness of Wire necessary or sufficient  
to conduct a large Quantity of Lightning, concerning  
which you desire my Sentiments, you will find some-­  
thing on that Head, in Pages 124, and 125, of the ene  
closed Pamphlet, which please to accept. And I may  
add, that in my late Journey I saw an Instance of a  
very greal Quantity of laghtning conducted by a  
Wire no bigger than a common knitting Needle. It  
was at Newbury, in New-England, where the spire  
of the Church Steeple being 70 foot in height above  
the Belfry was split all to pieces and thrown about  
the Streel in Fragment from the Bell down to the  
Clock placed in the steeple 2o foot below the Bell,  
there was the small Wire above mentioned which  
communicated the Motion of the Clock to the Ham­  
mer striking the Hour on the Bell. As far as the  
wire extended, no Part of the Steeple was hurt by  
the Lightning nor below the Clock as far as the Pene­  
dulum stod reached, but from the end of the Rod,  
downwards the Lightning rent the Steeple surprise  
ingly. The Pendulum Rod was about the thickness  
of a small Tobacco Pipe Stem, and conducted the  
whole without damage to its own Substanc, except  
that the End where the Lightning was all accumula-­  
ted, it appeared melted as much as made a small  
brop. lut the Clock wire was blown all to smoke.  
and smutted the church wall which it passed in a  
broad black Track, and also the Cieling under which  
was carried horizontally. No more of it was left  
than about an Inch and half next the Tail of the  
Hammer, and as much joining to the Clock. Yet  
this is obervable that tho it was so srhall as not to  
te sufficient to conduct the quantity with Safety to  
its own Substance, yet it did conduct, so as to secure  
all that Part of the Building. Excuse this Scrawl,

the Lightning, nor below the Clock as |  
far as the Pendulum Reod reached ; but |  
from the end ot the Rod, downwards the |  
Lightning rent the Steeple surprising- |  
ly. The Pendulum Rod wis about the l  
thickness of a small Tobacco Pipe Stem |  
and conducted the whole without dam- \
age ‘o its own Sutstanc, except that the  
Kind where the Lightning was all accu­  
muted, 1t appeared melted as much as  
made a small Drop. But the Clock  
wire was blown all to smoke, and smut­  
ted the church wall which it passed in  
a broad black Track, and also the Ceil­  
ing under which 1t was ecarried horizon­  
tally. No more of it was left than about  
an luch and half next the Tail of the  
Hammer, and as much joining to the  
Clock. Yet this is observable that tho’  
it was 8o small as not to be safficient to  
conduct the Quantity with Safety to  
its own Substance, yetit aid conduc!‘  
s 0 as to secure all that Part of the Build­  
ing. Excuse this Scrawl, which I have |  
not time to copy fair,

saw a ve:y great quantity of lightning con­  
ducted by a wire no bigger than a common  
knittingjneedle. It was atNewbury in New En­  
gland, where the spire of the church steeple  
being 70 feet in Hight above the belfry was  
split all to piecesand thrown about the street  
in fragments. From the bell down to the  
clock, placed in the steeple 20 feet below the  
bell, there was the small wire above men­

clock to the hammer striking the hour on the  
bell. As far as the wire extended no part of  
tho steeple was hurt by the lightning, nor be­  
low the clock as far as the pendulum rod  
reached, but from the end of the rod down­  
wards the lightning rent the steeple surpris­

years ago was much like lightning now-a-days.  
Enough of it could be carried by a wire the
