, 2d Year of the Republic.  
  
Intrusted in this part of the world with the interests and rights of the French people, as you are with those of the citizens of America, I have sworn to my country, and imposed it as a sacred duty on myself never to permit private considerations or other motives foreign from the general weal to impede me in what I conceived the line of duty. My conduct has accordingly been marked with all the energy and frankness which ever characterize a true republican. To you alone, thro’ the Secretary of State, have I complained of the principles you have adopted and remonstrated against decisions which have resulted therefrom. To you alone have I declared that the Federal government, far from manifesting any regard for our generous conduct towards this country—for the new advantages which we were offering to her commerce—or for the reiterated demonstrations of our real and disinterested friendship, were sacrificing our interests to those of our enemies, by their interpretation of the treaties which exist between us. To you have I represented without reserve that this conduct did not appear to correspond with the views of the people of America, with their desire to observe with fidelity their public engagements or with their affectionate regard for the cause of liberty, upon which their very existence and prosperity depend. Certain decisions of your tribunals and verdicts of your juries, added to the sentiments of your fellow-citizens publicly expressed, might permit me without a crime to draw this inference.  
Nevertheless certain persons, actuated by views which time will develope, despairing to attack my principles, have descended to personal abuse—In hopes of withdrawing from me that esteem which the public feel and avow for the representative of the French republic. They publish with great warmth that I have  
  
insulted you and that I have threatened you with an appeal to the people, as if you would permit any one with impunity to treat you with disrespect, or as if the slightest hint of an appeal, which, a Magistrate deserving of his high office, should ardently desire, was to you the greatest offence I could offer.  
It is become necessary, Sir, to dissipate these dark calumnies by truth, and publicity.—I dare therefore to expect from your candor and probity an explicit declaration that “I have never intimated to you an intention of appealing to the people; that it is not true that a difference in political sentiments has ever betrayed me to forget what was due to your character or to the exalted reputation you had acquired by humbling a tyrant against whom you fought in the cause of liberty.” A publication of your answer will be the only reply which shall be given to those party men, who never fail to confound the individual with affairs of state, which they too often make use of as a pretext for their zeal and a reason for dastardly appearing under anonimous signatures.  
As to myself, I have always openly declared what I thought, and signed what I had written, and if others have supposed they could advance my views, by newspaper publications and paragraphs they are much deceived—A good cause needs no advocate—Time and Truth will make it triumph, and ours must triumph in spite of its implacable enemies, and the present cold indifference of some who were its ancient friends.

Sir,  
NTRUSTED in this part of the world  
I with the interests and rights of the

my country, and imposed it as a sacred

Inrrustep, in this part of the world, |  
with the interests and rights of the |  
  
from the general weal, to impede me in |  
  
what I conceived the line of duty. My  
conduct has, accordingly, been marked  
with all the energy and frankness which  
ever characterize a true Republican. To  
you alone, through the Secretary of  
State, have I complained of the princi-  
ples you have adopted, and remonstrated  
against decisions which have resulted  
therefrom. To you, alone, have I de-  
clared that the Federal Government, far  
  
from manifesting any regard for our gen- |  
  
erous conduct towards this country, for  
the new advantages which we were offer-  
ing to her commerce, or for the reiterated  
demonstrations of our real and disin-  
terested friendship, were sacrificing our  
interests to those of our enemies, by  
their interpretation of the Treaties which  
exist between us. To you have I pre-  
sented, without reserve, that this conduct  
did not appear to correspond with the  
views of the People of America, with  
their desire to observe with fidelity their  
public engagements, or with their affec-  
tionate regard for the cause of liberty,  
upon which their very existence and  
prosperity depends. Certain decisions of  
your tribunals and verdicts of your juries,  
added to the sentiments of your fellow-  
citizens, publicly expressed, might per-  
  
inference.  
Nevertheless, certain persons, actuated  
  
ened you with an appeal to the People;  
as if you would permit any one, with im-  
punity, to treat you with disrespect; or  
as if the slightest hint of an appeal,  
which a magistrate deserving of his high  
oflice should ardently desire, was to you  
the greatest offence I could offer.  
  
It has become necessary, Sir, to dissi-  
pate these dark calumnies by truth anc  
publicity. I dare, therefore, to expect  
from your candor and probity an ex-  
plicit declaration, that “I have never  
“intimated to you an intention of ap-  
“pealing to the people; that it is not  
“true that a difference in political sen-  
“timents has ever betrayed me to forget  
“what was due to your character or to  
“the exalted reputation you had ac-  
“quired by humbling a tyrant, against  
“whom you fought in the cause of lib-  
“erty.” A publication of your answer  
will be the only reply which shall be  
given to those party men, who never fail  
to confound the individual with affairs  
of state, which they too often make use  
of as a pretext for their zeal and a reason  
for dastardly appearing under anonymous  
signatures.  
  
As to myself, I have always openly  
declared what I thought, and signed  
what I had written; and if others have  
supposed they could advance my views,  
by newspaper publications and _para-  
graphs, they are much deceived. A  
good cause needs no advocate—time and  
truth will make it triumph; and ours  
must triumph in spite of its implacable  
  
: enemies, and the present cold indiffer-  
mit me, without a crime, to draw this |
