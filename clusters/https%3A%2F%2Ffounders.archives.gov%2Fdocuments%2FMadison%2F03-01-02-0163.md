 being ever quoted, or looked at, or even mentioned. That form will for ever be a millstone round our necks unless we now rid ourselves of it, once for all. The occasion is highly favorable, as we never can have them more in our power. As to Bonaparte, I should not doubt the revocation of his edicts, were he governed by reason. But his policy is so crooked that it eludes conjecture. I fear his first object now is to dry up the sources of British prosperity by excluding her manufactures from the continent. He may fear that opening the ports of Europe to our vessels will open them to an inundation of British wares. He ought to be satisfied with having forced her to revoke the orders on which he pretended to retaliate, &amp; to be particularly satisfied with us by whose unyielding adherence to principle she has been forced into the revocation. He ought the more to conciliate our good will, as we can be such an obstacle to the new career opening on him in the Spanish colonies. That he would give us the Floridas to withold intercourse with the residue of those colonies cannot be doubted. But that is no price, because they are ours in the first moment of the first war, &amp; until a war they are of no particular necessity to us. But, altho’ with difficulty, he will consent to our recieving Cuba into our union to prevent our aid to Mexico &amp; the other provinces. That would be a price, &amp; I would immediately erect a column on the Southernmost limit of Cuba &amp; inscribe on it a Ne plus ultra as to us in that direction. We should then have only to include the North in our confederacy, which would be of course in the first war, and we should have such an empire for liberty as she has never surveyed since the creation: &amp; I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as ours for extensive empire &amp; self government. As the Mentor went away before this change, &amp; will leave France probably while it is still a secret in that hemisphere, I presume the expediency of pursuing her by a swift sailing dispatch was considered. It will be objected to our recieving Cuba, that no limit can then be drawn for our future acquisitions. Cuba can be defended by us without a navy. &amp; this developes the principle which ought to limit our views. Nothing should ever be accepted which would require a navy to defend it.

d on Cuba. What the possession  
of the mouth of the Mississipol had been to the people of  
the West that of Cuba became to the nation. To cast the  
eye upon the map was sufficient to predict its destiny. A  
brief reference will show the importance attached to the  
question by our leading statesmen, and the steadiness and  
perseverance with which they have endeavored to hasten  
the consummation of so vital a measure.  
MR. JEFFERSON&#x27;S viEWs ABOCT cunA.  
Mr. Jefferson, in a letter to President Madison, of the  
27th of April, 1809, speaking of the policy that Napoleon  
would probably pursue towards us, says:  
He ought to be satisfied with having forced her (Great Britain)  
to revoke the orders on which he pretended to retaliate, and to  
be particularly satisfied with us, by whose unyielding adhe  
rence to principle she has been forced into the revocation. He  
ought the more to conciliate our good will, as we can be such  
an obatacle to the new career opening on him in the Spanish  
colonles. That he would give us the Ploridas to withhold inter  
with the residue of those colonies cannot be doubted.  
But that is no price, because they are ours in the first moment  
of the firat war, and unill a war they are of no martioular nee  
to us. But, although with difficulty, he will consent to  
our receiving Cuba into our Union to prevent our aid to Mexi  
co and the other provinces. That would be a price, and I would  
immediately erect a column on the southernmost limit of Cuba,  
and inscribe on it a ne plus ultre as to us in that direction. We  
should then have only to include the North in our confederacy-  
which would be, of course, in the first war--and we should  
have such an empire for liberty as she has never surveyed  
since the creation; and I am persuaded no constitution was  
ever before so well calculated as ours for extensive empire and  
self Government.  
It will be objected to our receiving Cuba that no limit can  
then be drawn io our future acqpuisitions. Ouba can be dee  
by us without a navy, and this developes the principle  
which ought to limit our viewa. Nothinz shauld ever be ae  
I which would require a navy to defend it
