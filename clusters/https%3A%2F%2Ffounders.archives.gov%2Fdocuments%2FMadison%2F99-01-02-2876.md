						Algiers, March 28th: 1808.  
					  
					I have the honor to enclose triplicate of my respects to you of the 4th. of January, and duplicate of that of the 9th. instant, together with the Schedule of my accounts with the United States. Since forwarding the Originals of these  
						letters I have heard nothing respecting the U. States, excepting by a letter from Mr. Montgomery, our Consul in Alicante, that an embargo had been laid on all Vessels in the Ports of the U. States.  
					It is with regret I have to inform you that our affairs here wear a different aspect from what they did, when I had last the honor of writing to you.  
					On the 16th. instant the Dey sent me a message by my Drogerman, that I should pay immediately sixteen thousand dollars for eight of the subjects of this Regency, said to have been destroyed on board the American Schooner Mary Ann,  
						captured some time since by one of his Frigates, as mentioned in my former letters. I returned for answer, that I had not yet received any authentic advice of this business, and could, therefore could say nothing about it. The Dey then sent me word that he would wait the  
						arrival of the Courier from Alicante, by which I might receive some information. But, on the 24 (the Courier not having yet arrived) the Drogerman informed me that the Dey had sent for him, and ordered him to tell me, that if I did not pay the money before night, I should be  
						sent to prison in Chains. I ordered him to return immediately to the Dey, and say that I could not pay the money, without the Order of my Government, as it was an affair out of the usual course of my business here, and that I was ready to meet the event. He brought me word  
						that the Dey would see me next day, at noon; on the subject. He accordingly sent for me at noon, on the 25th. When I entered the Palace, I met Mr Ulrick, the Danish Consul, who was descending from an audience of the Dey. He was seized by a Choux, who  
						carried him through the streets in the most indignant manner, to the Slave-prison where he was loaded with an enormous Chain. The reason assigned for which was, that he had been called upon for his Biennial present which he declared he could not make without having time given  
						him, as the Vessel containing it, and Annuities for the Regency, had been taken by the English  
					On meeting the Dey he demanded from me immediate payment for the persons before mentioned; together with an additional two thousand dollars for the Boy said to have been carried in the Schooner to Naples.  
					I told him, with firmness, that I could not pay it without the order of my Government, as it was an extraordinary case, and requested time to write and receive an answer: but was answered, that if it was not paid immediately, I knew what the Consequence  
						would be. I replied, that let the consequence be what it might, I should not pay it. I was then ordered to leave his presence.   
					On descending to the Area of the Palace, where the Danish Consul had been seized; I expected the same compliment which he had met with, and was prepared for it. But finding no one to molest me, I left the Palace and returned to my own house; where I  
						supposed the Orders would be sent to have me arrested; but the day passed without my hearing anything more of the matter. In the evening I met the French and Swedish Consuls (the others being at their Gardens) and we agreed to send for the other Consuls the following morning,  
						to concert measures for the liberation of the Dane. At noon we met at the Danish Consul’s House, with our respective Drogermen, and proceeded to the Palace, where we had an audience of the Dey, who, after some conversation, agreed to release the Danish Consul from his Chains,  
						at the intercession made for him. From thence we went to the Marine, where the Consul had been sent to work with the other Slaves (carrying a chain of 40 weight) to receive and conduct him to his house. While we were with the Dey, on the  
						business beforementioned, he asked me, in presence of the Consuls, if I did not intend to pay the money. I answered him as I had done the day before; to which he made the same reply; and I remain in daily expectation of experiencing the effects of this refusal, which is  
						dictated by a sense of duty and a conviction that the honor of my Country demands such conduct from me. I make no comment on the unpleasantness of my situation. My Government and my Country will consider it, and do what is right respecting it.  
					As it is very likely that the Cruizers which are now fitting out, will have orders to capture American Vessels, I have written to our Consul in Alicante, by this opportunity, which is unexpected and the only one likely to occur soon, to convey notice to all  
						the Consuls of the U. States in this sea, to guard our Merchant Vessels against the evil which may occur. A Copy of my letter to him, I have now the honor to enclose.  
					In consequence of the barbarous outrage which has been committed on the Danish Consul, and threatened to be put in execution against me, the Consuls have been brought to reflect, on their precarious situation here; and I trust, that in a few days there will  
						be a compact entered into among us, that we shall use our best endeavours to enforce that Article which exists in all the treaties between this Regency and Christian Powers, securing the person &amp; family of the Consul from violence and outrage, in consequence of anything  
						he may do in the exercise of his official functions. And I hope each one will bind himself not to do any act, as a public Agent, while any one is held in or threatened with durance vile. Our respective Governments I trust will sanction such a measure, and give orders to their  
						Consuls accordingly.  
					Notwithstanding all I have stated, it is possible that the Dey might not proceed to extremities towards me; or commit hostilities on our Commerce and Citizens, until I can hear from my Government on the Subject. But I have  
						thought it my duty to guard as much as possible against the evil, by giving notice to our Vessels which may be in this sea; as well as those in the Atlantic; for at present there is nothing to prevent their Cruizers from passing the Straits.  
					The Camp is expected to march in a few days against Tunis, and their Cruizers are said to be intended for that quarter. But there is no doubt but that some of them will cruize in various parts of this Sea, and some proceed  
						into the Atlantic.  
					I am pressed to finish my letter, as the Vessel is on the point of sailing; and after her departure the Port will probably be shut until the departure of the Cruiziers. With sentiments of the highest respect and most sincere attachment, I have the honor to  
						be, Sir, Your most faithful &amp; Obedt. Sert.

I have the honor to inclose a triplicate of my res­  
pects to you oj the itii of January, and duplicates  
of that ot the pth instant, and the schedule of my  
account with the United States. Since forwarding  
the first of these, 1 have heard nothing respecting  
the United States, excepting hy a letter from Mr.  
Montgomery, our consul in Alicante, that an em­  
bargo had been laid on all vessels in the ports of the  
United States.  
It is with regret I have to inform you, that our  
affairs here wear a ditiermt aspect from what they  
did when I had last the honour of wiiting to you.  
On the ICitb instant, the dry sent me a messige hy  
my drugerman, that I should pay immediately six­  
teen thousand dollars for eight of the subjects of  
his regency, said to have been destroyed on hoard  
the American schooner Miry-Ann, captured some  
time since by one of hi3 frigates, ns mentioned in  
my former letters, I returned for answer, that 1  
had npt yet received any authentic advices of this  
business, and could therefore say nothing about it.  
The dev then sent me word, that he would wait the  
arrival of the courier trom Airante, hy which I  
might receive some information. But on ihe 2UU  
(Ihe courier not having yet arrived) the drn^eruian  
ioiormed me that li e- dry h d si i,t for him and or­  
dered him to tell me that if 1 did not pay the money  
before night I should he sent to prison in chains. I  
ordered him to return immediately to the dry, and  
s iy, that 1 could not p-ty tlie money without the or­  
der &lt;d my government, as it was an affair out of the  
usual cornse of our business heie, and that 1 was  
ready to meet the event, lie brought me word  
that ihe dey would see me next day at noon on the  
subject.  
  
^ lie accordingly sent for me at noon on the 25th.  
When I entered the palace, I met Mr. Ulrirk, llie  
Danish consul, who was descending from an audi­  
enc.e of the dey. He was seized by a Chaoux, who  
arried him through the streets, in the most indig*  
nani manner, to the slave prison, where he was  
loaded with an enormous chain ; the reason assign­  
ed h»r which was, that he hao been called upon lor  
biennial presents, which he declared he could not  
mivke, without having time given him ; as the ves­  
sel containing it, and annuities lor the regency, had  
1 een taaen Lv the English. On meeting the dey,  
he demanded from me immediate payment tor the  
persons beiorc mentioned, together with an additi­  
onal two thousand dollars for the boy said to have  
been carried in lhesebnond to Naples. 1 told him,  
with lirmness, ttiat I could not pay it without the  
orders ot my government, as it was an extraordi­  
nary case, and requested Lime to write and receive  
an answer; hut was auswered, that if it was not  
paid immediately, I knew what the consequences  
would he. I replied, that let the consequences be  
what it might, 1 should not pay it. 1 was then or­  
dered to leave Ins presence. On descending to the  
area ol the palace, where the Danish rousul had  
been seized, I expected the same compliment which  
he had met with, and was prepared for it; but find­  
ing no one to molest me, I left the palace, and re­  
turned to my own home, where 1 supposed the or­  
der* would be sent to have me arrested ; but the  
day passed without my bearing any more of the  
matter. In the evening I met the Erench and Swe­  
dish consuls (the others being at their gardens) and  
we agreed to send for the other consuls the follow­  
ing morning, to concert measures lor the liberation  
j ol the D.me. At nuoa me wet at the Danish con­  
i *ul’» house, with our respective drogermen, and pro­  
ceeded to the palace, where we had an audience of  
[ the dey ; who after some conversation, agreed to  
release the Danish consul from his chains, at the  
intercession made for him. From thence we went  
to the marine (where the consul&#x27;had been seift to  
work with the otker slaves, carrying a chain of  
40lbs. weight) to receive and conduct btoMo bis  
house.  
  
While we were with the dey no the business be­  
fore mentioned, lie asked me, in pretence of the con­  
suls, it I did not intend to pay the money. 1 an-,  
swered him as 1 had done the day before j to which  
lie made the ssme1 reply ; and 1 remain in daily ex­  
pectation of experiencing the effects of tbta refusal; I  
which is dictated by a sense of duty, and a convicti­  
on that the honour of my country demands such&#x27;  
conduct from me. I make no comments on the an- i  
pleasantness of my situation. My government and  
iny country will consider it, and do what is right re­  
specting it.  
As it is very likely that the cruizers which are  
now litring out will have orders to capture American;  
vessels, I have written to our consul at Alicante by  
this opportunity, which is unexpected, and the only  
one likely to occur toon, to convey notice to aH the  
consuls of the United States in this sea, to gnard our  
merchant vessels against the evil which may occur.!  
A ropy of my letter to him I have now the honor  
to enclose. In consequence of the barbarous out­  
rage which has been committed on tbe Danish con­  
sul, and threatened to be pot in execution against  
me, the consuls have been brought to reflect oh their  
ptecarious situation here; and I trust that in a few  
days there will be a compact enitfad into among us,  
that we will use our best endeavours to enforce that  
article which exists in ail the treaties between this  
regency and chrtstiaa powers, securing tbs person  
and faintly of the consul from violonca and outrage,  
in consequence of any thing ha may do in tbeeger­

Algiers, March 28th, 1808.  
5IR,  
I have the honor to enclose triplicate of my  
■espects to you of the 4th of January, and duptp  
:ate of that of the 9th instant, and the schedul e  
»f my account with the United States. Since  
orwarding tlie first of these, I have heard nothing  
’especting the United States, excepting by a let- j  
eri&#x27;rom Mr. Montgomery, our consul in Alicante,!  
hat an embargo had been laid on all vessels in the !  
&gt;o:ts of the United States.  
It is with regret 1 have to inform you that our  
iftairs here wear a different aspect from  
vital they did when 1 had last the honor of wri­  
ing to you. On the 16th instant the Dey sent  
ne a message by my drogerman, that 1 hIiouI J  
»ay immediately sixteen thousand dollars tor 8  
if the subjects of this regency, said to have been  
IcRtroyed oil board the American schooner Maiyr  
(Vi.n, captured some time since by one of his fri­  
gates, as mentioned in my former letters. 1 re­  
timed for answer, that I had not yet received a­  
iy authentic advice of this business, and could  
lierefore say nothing about it. The Dey then,  
cut me word that he would wait the arrival,/  
lie courier from Alicante, by which 1 might re­  
vive sumo information. Rut on the. 34Ui (the  
:oiirier not having yet arrived) the drogeiman in­  
n.med me Li at (he Dey had sent for hi &gt;u and or­  
h red film to tell me tli it if 1 did not pay the mo.  
ivy before night, 1 should be sent to prison in  
bains.  
1 ordered him to return immediately to the  
&gt;ey, and say, that I could not pay the money  
vithout the order of my government, as it was  
n a flair out ol the usual co , ,c of our business  
icre, ami that 1 wns ready to meet the event,  
le brought me word that the Dey would ate me  
ext d.ry at noon on the subject, lie according­  
Y sent lor me at noon on the 2dth. When J on­  
ered th« palace, 1 met Mr. Uinck the Danish  
omul, wlio was descending from an audience of  
he Dry. He was cvUed by a Cliaux, wlio cwr­  
icd him through the streets in the m &gt;st indignant  
UMfiitv*&gt; to the sla e prison, where bw was lsad­  
--  
  
‘d w&#x27;th an enr.vmoM chain, the re*st&gt;n ttssignsdn  
hr widely was,&#x27;th.it h- had been r illcil upon fm |  
his biennial v esorits which !.c ilielUfcd he could 1  
i it make without having tim.* given him, as the |  
■ essel containing it, and annuities lor the regen- i  
y h id been *aken by the English.  
On meeting the Dey, he demanded from me im-j  
mediate payment for the priso.: rs before incir.i­  
&gt;ned,together with an additior d two thousand  
lollars for the boy said to have been carried in tin  
schooner to Naples. I told him with firmness  
that 1 coni i not pay it without the orders of my  
government, .is it was an extraordinary case ; and  
roquosu 1 time to write and receive an answer ;  
but wav answered, tl.at if it was not paid im­  
mediately, 1 knew wh.it the consequence would  
be; 1 replied, that let the consequence be what  
it might, 1 should not pay it I was then order­  
ed to leave his presence. On descending to the  
area ofthe palace, where the Danish consul had  
been seized, I expected the same compliment  
which In* hud met with, and was prepare ’ fur it.  
but finding no one to molest me, 1 leit the palace  
and returned to my own house, where 1 suppos­  
ed the orders wou&#x27;. I be sent to have me arrested ;  
hut the day passed without my hearing any tiling  
i more of the matter. In the evening 1 met the  
French and Swedish consuls, (the others being  
at tiic gardeiio) and we agreed to sciut for the o­  
ther coiishIs the following morning, to concert  
measures for the liberation ofthe Dane. At noon  
we fnet at the Danish consul’s house, with our  
respective dro&#x27;gerrf on, apd proceeded to the pa­  
lace, where wo had an audience with the Dey,  
who, after sortie conversation, agreed to release  
the Danish consul from his chains, at the inter­  
cession made for him. , From thence we went to  
the marin-/, where the consul had been sent to  
work with the other slaves carrying a chain of  
forty weight, to receive and conduct him to his  
  
house. While we were wit!* die Dey on the bu­  
sm ss before mentioned,he asked me, in presence  
of the consuls, if I did not intend to pay the mo­  
ney. I answered him as 1 had done the day be­  
j fore ; to which lie made the same reply; and I  
remained in daiv expectation of experiencing  
the dlccfc cftl-.I: ; v/hich : * .t;^t  
sense of duly aid a conviction tliat the honor t  
my country dcimnds such conduct from me.  
make nocommeits on the unpleasantness of mv  
situation, my gtvernment and my country will  
consider it, and lo what is right respecting it  
As it is very Ikely that the cruizcrs which are  
now lining out vill have orders to capture Ame­  
rican vessels, I hive written to our consul in Ali­  
cante by this opportunity, which is unexpected,  
and tl iu only out likely to occur soon, to convey  
notice to all thqconsuls of the Uhiled States in  
this sea, to guad our merchant vessels against  
tiie evil which Hay occur. A copy of my letter  
to him 1 have ntw the honor to enclose. In con­  
sequence of tic barbarous outrage which lias  
been committed on the Danish consul, ami threa­  
tened to be put in execution against me, the con­  
suls have been b ought to re fleet on their preca­  
rious situation lerc ; anil i trust that in a few  
days there will tea compact entered into among  
us, that we w | use our best end -avors to en­  
force that article which exists in alt the treaties  
between this ngency and Christian powers, se­  
curing the ersrn and family of the consul from  
violence and ourage, in consequence of any tiling  
lie may do in th: exercise of his official functions  
And I hope each one will bind himself not to do  
any act as a puttie agent, while any one is held  
in, or threatencc with durance vile.  
Our respective governments, I Iru -;,.will sanc­  
tion such a measure, and give orders to their con­  
suls accordingly  
Notwithstanilng all I have stated, it is possi­  
ble that the Dsp- may not pn/oetd to extremities  
towards me, or commit hostilities on our com­  
merce and citizens, until I hear from my govern­  
ment on the subject. But I have thought it mv  
duty to guard as much as possible against the c­  
vil, by giving notice t&gt;v our vessels which may be  
in tl»is sea, as well as those in the Atlantic ; for  
at present there is nothing to prevent their crui­  
zcrs from passing the Straits.  
The camp is expected to march in a few daj’s  
against Tunis, and their cruizers are said to be  
intended for tliat quarter ; but there is no doubt  
but some of them will cruize In every part of  
this sea, and probably go into the Atlantic.  
With sentiments of the highest respect and  
most sincere attachment,  
I have the honor to be,  
Sir, Your most faithful and obedient servant

Lt the  
  
day passed without my hearing any wore of  
the &quot;matter. &#x27; In the ever lug I met the French&#x27;  
  
and Swedish Consuls (Ue others, being at  
their gardens) and we agreed to send far the  
other Consuls the Mowing inonn, to con­  
cert measures for tlie liber &quot; n of the Dane.&quot;  
At noon we metat the Dai..-. Consul&#x27;s house,  
with out respective drogermen, and proceed­  
ed to the palace, where we had an audience  
of the Dey , &quot; who after sonic conversation,  
agreed tc release the Danish Consul from hia  
chains, at. the intercession mule for him.  
From thence we went to the marine (where  
the Consul had been sent to work with Ibe  
other slaves, carrying a chain of 40 pounds  
weight) &#x27;to receive and conduct him to hia  
house. ,- ,  
V WTiile we were with the Dey oa the busi-,  
nest before, mentioned, he asked me, in pre­  
sence of the Consuls, if I did not intend to  
pay the money. T answered him as I had  
  
done the day before t to which he made the  
same reply ; and I remain in daily expecta­  
tion of experiencing the effects of this refu  
  
sal; which is dictated by a awe ot cuty,  
and a conviction that the hwor cfjmv coun­  
try demands such conduct from me. I make  
no comments on the. unpleasantness of my si­  
tuation. My government and my. country  
will consider k and da what is right respect­
