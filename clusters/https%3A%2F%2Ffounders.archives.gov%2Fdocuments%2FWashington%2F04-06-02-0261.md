Sir,  
Mount Vernon May 25th 1788.  
  
The letter with which you honored me the 25th of last Month, and the Pease (by way of Baltimore) are safe at hand. I pray you to accept my thanks for them. I shall cultivate the Pease with care—this year in hills, to accumulate Seed—next year in broadcast, for a crop.  
I am sorry to find by your letter that the State of North Carolina is so much opposed to the proposed Government. If a better could be agreed on, it might be well to reject this; but without such a prospect (&amp; I confess none appears to me) policy I think, must recommend the one that is submitted.  
The sentiments of this State will soon be known—The second day of June the Convention is to meet. Since the election of delegates to it, the prevailing opinion is that a majority of the members are in favor of the Constitution, but as they are soon to speak their own sentiments it would be imprudent to anticipate them, even, if they were reduced to certainty. Maryland has ratified by a very large Majority, Sixty three to Eleven. With great esteem &amp; regard I have the honor to be—Sir Yr Most Obedt Hble Servt

erything  
reminding us of him whose virtues have consecrated  
the day, will be interesting. If you shall think  
proper to present your readers with the enclosed let­  
ter, addressed to a distinguished citizen of our  
town, at a very critical period in the history of our  
country, it is at your service. Gena Washington and  
Gov. Spaight were both members of the Convention  
that framed our Federal Constitution. This letter is  
part of a correspondence between them while the  
Constitution was before the States for its ratification.  
A SUBSCRIBER.  
GENERAL WASHINGTON&#x27;S LETTER.  
Sir: MouNT VERNON, May 25, 1788.  
I am sorry to find by your letter that the State of  
North Carolina is so much opposed to the proposed  
Government. If a better could be agreed on, it might  
be well to reject this; but without such a prospect  
(and I confess none appears to me) policy, I think,  
must recommend the one that is submitted.  
The sentiments of this State will soon be known.  
The second day of June the Convention is to meet.  
Since the election of delegates to it, the prevailing  
opinion is, that a majority of the members are in  
favor of the Constitution, but as they are soon to  
speak their own sentiments, it would be imprudent to  
anticipate them, even if they were reduced to cer­  
tainty. Maryland has ratified by a very large ma­  
jority,-sixty-three to seven.  
With great esteem and regard, I have the honor to  
be, sir. Your most obed&#x27;t h&#x27;ble serv&#x27;t,  
GEORGE WASHINGTON
