and in order to rescue truth from the specious disguise, with which it has been cloathed, I shall now offer a few remarks on the act, intitled, “An Act for making more effectual provision, for the government of the province of Quebec, In North-America” whereby, I trust, it will clearly appear, that arbitrary power, and its great engine the Popish Religion, are, to all intents and purposes, established in that province.  
While Canada was under the dominion of France, the French laws and customs were in force there; which are regulated in conformity to the genius and complexion of a despotic

ch we have had respecting the disposition of the Canadians, we must conclude they are averse to the present regulation of the Parliament; and had rather continue under the form of government instituted by the royal proclamation.  
However this may be, the French laws are again revived. It is enacted, “that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights, resort shall be had to the laws of Canada, as the rule for the decision of the same; and all causes, that shall hereafter be instituted, in any of the courts of justice, shall, with respect to such property and rights, be determined agreeably to the said laws and customs of Canada, until they shall be varied and altered, by any ordinances, that shall, from time to time, be passed in the said province, by the Governor, Lieutenant Governor or commander in chief for the time being by and with the advice and consent of the legislative council of the same.” Thus the ancient laws of Canada are restored, liable to such variations and additions, as shall be deemed necessary, by the Governor and council, and as both the one and the other are to be appointed by the King,

s it ever has in Spain or Portugal.  
But, in order to varnish over the arbitrary complexion of the act, and to conciliate the minds of the Canadians, it is provided, that “whereas the certainty and lenity of the criminal law of England, and the benefits and advantages resulting, from the use of it, have been sensibly felt by the inhabitants, from an experience of more, than nine years; therefore, the same shall be administered, and shall be observed, as law, in the province of Quebec, to the exclusion of every rule of criminal law, which did, or might prevail, in the said province, before the year 1764.”  
As “it is on the goodness of criminal laws, that the liberty of the subject principally depends  
  
Montesquieu.  
  
,” this would have been an important privilege, had it not been rendered uncertain and alienable, by the latter part of the same clause, which makes them “subject to such alterations and amendments, as the Governor, Lieut. Governor, and Commander in Chief, for the time being, by and with the advice and consent of the legislative council of the same, shall, from time to time, cause to be made therein.” Under the

Province of Quebec should enjoy their property, usages, and other  
civil rights as they had before done, and that in all matters of con-  
troversy relative to property and civil rights, resort should be had to  
the laws, and be determined agreeably to the said laws. In this stat-  
ute the words “property ” and “ civil rights” are plainly used in  
their largest sense ; and there is no reason for holding that in the  
statute under discussion they are used in a different and narrower  
one.  
  
The next question for consideration is whether, assuming the On-  
tario act to relate to the subject of property and civil rights, its en-  
actmeuts and provisions come within any of the classes of subjects  
enumerated in section $91. The only one which the appellants sug-  
gested as expressly including the subject of the Ontario act is No. 2,

in manner hereinafter mentioned.  
  
By enacting that “in all matters of  
controversy and civil rights resort shall  
be had to the laws of Canada as the  
rule for the decision of the same,’’ the  
old Canada or French law was restored  
and all his majesty’s subjects, French  
and English, in the colony were in civil  
matters placed under laws totally foreign  
to British immigrants and those of the  
old British settlers who had been accus-  
tomed to British law.  
  
The speech of his majesty, the king,  
to both houses of parliament, discloses  
the reason for passing that act. In that  
speech his majesty says:  
  
The very peculiar circumstances of embarrassment  
in which the province of Quebec is involved had  
rendered the proper adjustment and regulation o

by the Quebec Act (14 Geo. III. ¢. 83) it was enacted that  
‘in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil  
rights, resort shall be had to the laws of Canada”—z.e., to  
the French law as it was before the Cession. The Criminal  
law of England was to continue in force.  
  
After the passing of the Code Napoléon in 1804,  
countries which, like this province and Louisiana, were  
governed by the French law, as it was before that Code,  
were left in a very awkward position. The Code Napoléon
