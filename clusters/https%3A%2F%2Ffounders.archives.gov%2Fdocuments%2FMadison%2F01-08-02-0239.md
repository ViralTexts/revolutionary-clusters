The commonwealth of Virginia disclaims all right to impose any toll, duty, or charge, prohibition or restraint, on any vessel whatever sailing through the capes of Chesapeake bay to the state of Maryland, or from the said state through the said capes outward bound; and agrees that the waters of Chesapeake bay, and the river Pocomoke, within the limits of Virginia, be forever considered as a common highway, free for the use and navigation of any vessel belonging to the said state of Maryland, or any of its citizens, or carrying on any commerce to or from the said state, or with any of its citizens; and that every such vessel inward or outward bound, may freely enter any of the rivers within the commonwealth of Virginia as a harbour, or for safety against an enemy, without the payment of port duties, or any other charge; and also, that the before mentioned parts of Chesapeake bay, and Pocomoke river, be free for the navigation of vessels from one part of the state of Maryland to another.  
Second. The state of Maryland agrees that any vessel belonging to the commonwealth of Virginia, or any of its citizens, or carrying on commerce to or from the said commonwealth, or with any of its citizens, may freely enter any of the rivers of the said state of Maryland as a harbour, or for safety against an enemy, without the payment of any port duty, or other charge.  
Third. Vessels of war, the property of either state, shall not be subject to the payment of any port duty or other charge.  
  
Fourth. Vessels not exceeding forty feet keel, nor fifty tons burthen, the property of any citizen of Virginia or Maryland, or of citizens of both states, trading from one state to the other only, and having on board only the produce of the said states, may enter and trade in any part of either state, with a permit from the naval-officer of the district from which such vessel departs with her cargo, and shall be subject to no port charges.  
Fifth. All merchant vessels (except such as are described in the fourth article) navigating the river Potowmack, shall enter and clear at some naval office on the said river, in one or both states, according to the laws of the state in which the entry shall be made. And where any vessel shall make an entry in both states, such vessel shall be subject to tonnage in each state only in proportion to the commodities carried to, or taken from, such state.  
Sixth. The river Potowmack shall be considered as a common highway, for the purpose of navigation and commerce to the citizens of Virginia, and Maryland, and of the United States, and to all other persons in amity with the said states, trading to or from Virginia or Maryland.  
Seventh. The citizens of each state respectively shall have full property in the shores of Potowmack river adjoining their lands, with all emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharves and other improvements, so as not to obstruct or injure the navigation of the river; but the right of fishing in the river shall be common to, and equally enjoyed by the citizens of both states. Provided, That such common right be not exercised by the citizens of the one state, to the hindrance or disturbance of the fisheries on the shores of the other state; and that the citizens of neither state shall have a right to fish with nets or seines on the shores of the other.

Ninth.

If upon Potowmack river, at the joint and equal charge of both states; and if upon the before mentioned part of Chesapeake bay, Virginia shall defray five parts, and Maryland three parts of such expence; and if this proportion shall in future times be found unequal, the same shall be corrected. And for ascertaining the proper places, mode, and plans for erecting and fixing light houses, buoys, beacons and other signals, as aforesaid, both states shall upon the application of either to the other, appoint an equal number of commissioners, not less than three nor more than five from each state, to meet at such times and places as the said commissioners or a major part of them, shall judge fit, to fix upon the proper places, mode, and plans for erecting and fixing such light houses, beacons, or other signals, and report the same, with an estimate of the expence, to the legislatures of both states, for their approbation.

And if the inhabitants of either state shall commit any violence, injury, or tresspass, to or upon the property or lands of the other, adjacent to the said bay or rivers, or to any person upon such lands, upon proof of due notice to the offender to appear and answer, any court of record, or civil magistrate of the state where the offence shall have been committed, having jurisdiction thereof, may enter the appearance of such person, and proceed to trial and judgment, in the same manner, as if legal process had been served on such offender; and such judgment shall be valid and effectual against the person and property of such offender, both in the state where the offence shall have been committed, and also in the state where the said offender may reside, and execution may be issued by the court, or magistrate, giving such judgment, in the same manner as upon judgments given in other cases; or upon a transcript of such judgment, properly authenticated, being produced to any court; or magistrate, of the state where such offender may reside, having jurisdiction within the state, or county where the offender may reside, in cases of a similar nature, such court, or magistrate, shall order execution to issue upon such authenticated judgment in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if the judgment had been given by the court, or magistrate, to which such transcript shall be exhibited.  
Eleventh. Any vessel entering into any port on the river Potowmack, may be libelled, or attached for debt, by process from the state in which such vessel entered. And if the commercial regulations of either state shall be violated by any person carrying on commerce in Potowmack or Pocomoke rivers, the vessel owned or commanded by the person so offending, and the property on board, may be seized, by process from the state whose laws are offended, in order for trial. And if any person shall fly from justice, in a civil or criminal case, or shall attempt to defraud creditors by removing his property, such person, or any property so removed, may be taken on any part of Chesapeake bay, or the rivers aforesaid, by process of the state from which such person shall fly, or property be removed; and process from the state of Virginia may be served on any part of the said rivers, upon any person, or property of any person not a citizen of Maryland, indebted to any citizen of Virginia, or charged with injury having been by him committed; and process from the state of Maryland may be served on any part of the said rivers, upon any person, or property of any person, not a citizen of Virginia, indebted to a citizen of Maryland, or charged with injury by him committed.

Twelfth. The citizens of either state having lands in the other, shall have full liberty to transport to their own state, the produce of such lands, or to remove their effects, free from any duty, tax, or charge whatsoever, for the liberty to remove such produce or effects.  
Thirteenth. These articles shall be laid before the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland, and their approbation being obtained, shall be confirmed and ratified by a law of each state, never to be repealed, or altered, by either, without the consent of the other.
