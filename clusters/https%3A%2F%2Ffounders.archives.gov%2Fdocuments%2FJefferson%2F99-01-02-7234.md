To the House of Representatives of the United States  
  
  
Some days previous to your resolutions of the 13th. inst. a court of Enquiry had been instituted, at the request of Genl. Wilkinson, charged to make the enquiry into his conduct which the first resolution desires, and had commenced their proceedings. to the judge Advocate of that court the papers &amp; information on that subject, transmitted to me by the House of Representatives, have been delivered, to be used according to the rules &amp; powers of that court.  
The request of a communication of any information which may have been recieved, at any time since the establishment of the present government, touching combinations with foreign agents for dismembering the union, or the corrupt reciept of money by any officer of the US. from the agents of foreign governments, can be complied with but in a partial degree.  
It is well understood that in the first or second year of the presidency of General Washington, information was given to him relating to certain combinations with the agents of a foreign government, for the dismemberment of the Union: which combinations had taken place before the establishment of the present federal government. this information however, is believed never to have been deposited in any public office, or left in that of the President’s Secretary; these having been duly examined: but to have been considered as personally confidential and therefore retained among his private papers. a communication from the Governor of Virginia to President Washington is found in the office of the President’s Secretary, which, altho not strictly within the terms of the request of the House of Representatives, is communicated, inasmuch as it may throw some light on the subjects of the correspondence of that time between certain foreign agents, &amp; citizens of the US.  
In the first or second year of the administration of President Adams, Andrew Ellicott, then employed in designating, in conjunction with the Spanish authorities, the boundaries between the territories of the US. and of Spain under the treaty with that nation, communicated to the Executive of the US. papers &amp; information respecting the subjects of the present enquiry, which were deposited in the office of state. copies of these are now transmitted to the House of Representatives, except of a single letter and a reference from the said Andrew Ellicott, which being expressly desired to be kept secret, is therefore not communicated. but it’s contents can be obtained from himself in a more legal form, and directions have been given to summon him to appear as a witness before the court of enquiry.  
A paper ‘on the commerce of Louisiana’, bearing date the 18th. of April 1798. is found in the office of state, supposed to have been communicated by mr Daniel Clark of New Orleans, then a subject of Spain, &amp; now of the House of Representatives of the US., stating certain commercial transactions of General Wilkinson in New Orleans, an extract from this is now communicated, because it contains facts which may have some bearing on the questions relating to him.  
The destruction of the War office by fire in the close of 1800. involved all information it contained at that date.  
The papers already described therefore constitute the whole of the information on these subjects, deposited in the public offices, during the preceding administrations, as far as has yet been found. but it cannot be affirmed that there may be no other. because the papers of the offices being filed, for the most part, alphabetically, unless aided by the suggestion of any particular name which may have given such information, nothing short of a careful examination of the papers in the offices generally could authorize such an affirmation.  
About a twelvemonth after I came to the administration of the government, mr Clark gave some verbal information to myself, as well as to the Secretary of State, relating to the same combinations for the dismemberment of the union. he was listened to freely, and he then delivered the letter of Governor Gayoso addressed to himself, of which a copy is now communicated. after his return to New Orleans he forwarded to the Secretary of State other papers with a request that after perusal they should be burnt. this however was not done: and he was so informed by the Secretary of State, and that they would be held subject to his orders. these papers have not yet been found in the office. a letter therefore has been addressed to the former Chief Clerk, who may perhaps give information respecting them. as far as our memories enable us to say, they related only to the combinations before spoken of, and not at all to the corrupt reciept of money by any officer of the US. consequently they respected what was considered as a dead matter, known to the preceding administrations, and offering nothing new to call for investigations, which those nearest the dates of the transactions had not thought proper to institute.  
In the course of the communications made to me on the subject of the conspiracy of Aaron Burr, I sometimes recieved letters, some of them anonymous, some under names true or false, expressing suspicions and insinuations against Genl. Wilkinson. but one only of them, and that anonymous, specified any particular fact, &amp; that fact was one of those which had been already communicated to a former administration.  
No other information within the purview of the request of the house, is known to have been recieved, by any department of the government, from the establishment of the present federal government. that which has been recently communicated to the House of Representatives, &amp; by them to me, is the first direct testimony ever made known to me, charging General Wilkinson with a corrupt reciept of money: and the House of Representatives may be assured that the duties which this information devolves on me shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality. should any want of power in the court to compel the rendering of testimony obstruct that full &amp; impartial enquiry which alone can establish guilt or innocence and satisfy justice, the legislative authority only will be competent to the remedy.

To the House of Representatives qf the U  
States.  
Some days previous to your resolutions of  
the thirteenth instant, a court of inquiry had  
been instituted, at the request of geil. \V.  
charged tp make the inquiry into his conduct  
which the first resolution&#x27; desires, and had  
commenced their proceedings. To the judge  
advocate of that court the papers and infor­  
mation on that subject, i*„:tied .  
the house of representatives, have &gt;cen de.i­  
vered to be used accordirg to the rules and  
powers of that court.  
Tlie request of a communication of any in­  
formation which may have been received, at  
any time since the establishment of the pre­  
sent government. touching combinations with j  
foreign agents for dismembering the union, j  
ir the corrupt receipt of inonev by am* officer j  
af the L». b. from the agents of foreign go-:  
rermnents, can be complied with but in a ;  
partial degree..• ,  
It is well understood that in the first or I  
second» ear of the presidency of gcu. Wash- i  
ngtou, information was. given to him rein- J  
ngto certain cumbmatnr.s with the agents of  
i foreign government, for the dismemberment  
’ the union ; which combinations had taken  
3.ace before the establishment of the&#x27;prc­  
&gt;ent federal government. This information,  
icwever, is believed never to have been d&lt; -  
I suited in any pu.tlie office, or left in that o&#x27;.  
ie President’s secretary ; these having been ,  
• ‘■&#x27;y examined: but to have been considered  
is personally confidential, and therefor, re- !  
ained among his private papers. - A com- &#x27;  
nunication from the governor of Virginia to |  
’resident Washington, is found in the office !  
&gt;f the President’s secretary, which, altho’I  
lot strictly within the terms of the request of&#x27;

lim to appear as a w itness before the court

A paper “ on the commerce of Louisiana,”  
learing date the eighteenth of April, one  
housund seven hundred and ninety-eight, is  
bund in the office of state, supposed to have  
icon comnmqicatcd by Mr. Daniel Clark, of  
sf• Orleans, then a subject of Spain, and now  
if the house of representatives of the U. S.  
tating certain commercial trausaesjons of  
ren. Wilkinson in N. Orleans : an extract  
rom this is now communicated, because it  
■.ontains facts which may have some bearing  
&gt;n the questions relating to him.  
The destruction of the war office by fire,  
nthe close of one thousand eight hundred,  
nvolved all information it contained at that  
late.  
The papers already described, therefore,  
^institute the whole of the information on

luring the preceding administrations, as far  
is has yet been fonnd : but it cannot be af­  
inncd that there may. be no other, because

nost part, alphabetically, unless aided by the  
suggestion of any particular name which may  
nave given such information, nothing short of  
x careful examination of the papers in the  
offices generally could authorize such an af­  
firmation. ^

administration of the government, Mr. Clark t  
gave some verbal information to myself, as t  
well as to the secretary «f state, relating to  
ihc same combinations for the dismember- t  
meat of the union. He was listened to frevly ; ,  
and he then delivered the letter of governor ■ t  
kiayoso addressed to himself, of which a copy 1 &lt;  
is now cbmrnunicatcd. After his return to jt  
N.Orleans he forwarded to the secretary of j

perusal they shouid be burnt. This however 11  
was not done : vind he was so informed by the t  
secretary of state, and that they would be held f j  
subject to his orders. These papers have not j \
yet been found in the office. A letter there- .

To the House of Representatives of the  
United States.  
SOME days previous to your resolutions  
of the 13»h inst. a court of enquiry had been  
instituted ut the request of (sen. Wilkinson,  
‘Charged to make the inquiry into his con­  
duct which the first resolution desires, and  
h id commenced their proceedings. To the  
judge advocate of that court the papers  
and information on that subject, transmitted  
to me by the house of representatives, have  
been delivered to be used according to the  
rules and powers of that coii&#x27;-t.  
The request of a communication of any  
information which may have been received,  
at any time since the establishment of the  
present government, touching c- mbinations  
with foreign agents for dismembering the  
union, or the corrupt receipt of money by  
any officer of the United States, from the  
agents of foreign governments, can be com­  
plied with but in a partial degree.  
It is well understood that in the first or  
second year of the presidency of general  
Washington, information was given to him  
.relating to certain combinations with the  
agents of a foreign government, for the dis­  
memberment of the union ; which combina­  
tions had taken place before the establish­  
ment of the present federal government.  
This information, however, is believed ne­  
ver to have been deposited in any public  
office, or lert in that of the president’s se­  
cretary ; these having been duly examined :  
but to have been considered its personally  
confidential, and therefore retained among  
liis private papers. A communication from i  
  
tre governor Of Virginia to president Wash­  
ington, is found in tfie office of the Presi­  
dent s secretary, which, although not strict­  
ly within the terms of the request of the  
house of representatives, is communicated,  
inasmuch as it may throw some lighten the  
suujecU.of the correspondence of that time,  
between certain foreign agents and citizens  
of the United States.  
In the first or second year of the admini­  
stration of president Adams, Andrew Elli­  
cott, then employed in ciasignating, in con­  
junction with the Span sh authorities, the  
boundaries between the territories of the U­  
nited States and of Spain, under the treaty  
with that nation comnmic&amp;ted to the exe­  
cutive of the United Stawes, paj/ers and in­  
formation respecting the subjects of the pre­  
sent inquiry, which were deposited in the  
office of state. Copies of these are now  
transmitted to the house of representatives,  
except of a single letter and a reference  
from tlie said Andrew Kllicott, which being  
expressly desired to he kept secret, is there­  
fore not communicated : hut its contents can  
he obtained 1mm himseif in a more legal  
form ; and directions have been given to sum­  
jnon him to appear as a witness before the  
court of inquiry.  
A p iper “on i he commerce of Louisiana,*’  
bearing date the WU day of April, 179R, is  
found in the office of slate, supposed to have  
been communicated by Mr. Daniel Chirk,  
of New Orleans, then a sdbie t of Spain,  
and now &lt;*f the house of representatives o  
the United States, statin;&#x27;&#x27;certain cummer-!  
cial transactions of general Wilkinson in  
Isew Orleans: an extract from tins is now i  
communicated, because it contains factsj  
which may have some bearing on the ques­  
tions relating to him.  
The destruction of the war office by fire,  
in the close of 1800, involved all infofmuti- i  
on it contained at tnat date.  
riienapers already described, therefore,  
constitute the whole &quot;of the informal m on  
the*e subjects, deposited in the public offi-!  
ces, during the preceding administrations,]  
as far as has yet been found : but it cannot i  
be affirmed that there mr\v he &gt;&lt;i&gt;wr h... I  
  
cause the papers of the offices being filed,  
for the most part, alphabetically, unless aid­  
ed by tiie suggestion of any particular name  
which may li ive given such information, no­  
thing short of a careful examination of the  
papers In the offices generally could autho­  
rise stick :m affirmation.  
About, a twelvemonth after I came to the  
administration of the government, Mr.  
Ciaik gave some verbal information to my­  
self, as well as to the secretary of state, re.  
lating to the same combinations tor the dis­  
memberment of tf,e union. He was listened  
to freely} and lie then delivered the letter  
of governor Ciayoso addressed to himself, of  
which a copy is now communicated. After  
his return to New Orleans he forwarded to  
the secretary of state other papers, with a  
request that after perusal they should be  
burnt. This however was not done : and*he  
was so informed by the secretary of state,  
and that they would be held subject to his  
orders. These papers have not yet been  
found in the office. A letter therefore has  
been addressed to the former chief clerk,  
who ua tv perhaps give information resjiect­  
ing them. As far as oar memories enable  
us to say, they relayed only to the combina­  
tions helm e spoken of, and not at all to the  
corrupt receipt of money by any officer of  
the United States : consequently they re­  
spected what wav considered as a dead mat­  
ter, known to the Pieceding. administrati­  
ons, and ode ring nothing new to for in­  
&#x27;i&#x27;b  
  
vestigations, which those nearest the dates  
of the transactions had not thought proper  
to institute.  
In the course of the communications made  
to me on the subject of ilie conspiracy ot  
Aaron Burr, 1 sometimes received letters,  
some of them anonymous, some under names  
true or false, expressing suspicions and in­  
sinuations against general Wilkinson. But  
one only of them, and that anouy mous, spe­  
cified any particular fact, ami that fact was  
one of those which had been already com­  
municated to a former administration.  
No other information within the purview  
of the request of the house, is known to have  
been received, by any department of the  
government, from the&quot; establishment of the  
present lederal government. That which  
has been recently communicated to the  
house of representatives, anil by them to  
me, is the first direct testimony ever made  
known tome, charging general Wilkinson  
with a corrupt receipt of money : and the  
house of representatives may he assured  
that the duties which this information de.  
vnlveson me shall lie exercised with vigor­  
ous impartiality. Should any want of pow­  
er in the court to compel the rendering of  
testimony obstruct that full and impartial  
inquiry which alone can establish guilt or  
innocence, and satisfv justice, the legisla­  
tive authority only will be competent to the  
remedy.

of general Wilkinson in New-Orleans: an exfraci  
from tbit is now communicated, because it contains  
facts which may have some beariug on tba question  
relating to him.  
The destrurtiou of the war office by fire, in the  
close of one thousand eight hundred) involved all in­  
formation it contained at that date.  
The papers already described, therefore, consti­  
tute the whole of the information on these subjects,  
deposited in the publirk offices, during the preced­  
ing administrations, as far^s yet has been found :  
but it cannot be affirmed that there may be no other  
because the papers of the offices being filed for the  
most part, alphabetically, unless aided by the sug­  
gestion of any particular name which may have gi­  
ven such information-, nothing short of a cariful  
examination of the papers in the offices generally  
could autbnri/e&#x27;Such an information.  
About a twelve month alter I came to the admi­  
tration of the government, Mr. Clark gave some  
verbal information to myself, as well as to the se­  
cretary ol state, relating to the same combinations  
for the dismemberment of the union. He was lis­  
tened to fieely ; and lie then delivered the letter ul  
governour Gayoso addressed to himself, of which a  
copy is now communicated. After his return to  
New Oileans he forwarded to the secretary ot stite  
other papers, with a request that alter perusal they  
should he burnt. This however was not done ; and  
he was so informed by the secretary of slate, and  
that they would be he.ld subject to his orders. These  
papers have not yet been found in the office. A let­  
ter therefore has been addressed to the lormer chief  
clerk, who may perhaps give information respect­  
ing them. As far as our memories rnuble us to say,  
they related only to the combinations before spok-n  
  
vi, «iiu iu me ci&#x27;iiiipi iec&lt;ijn ui money t&gt;y  
any officer of the U. States : consequently they re­  
spected what was considered as a dead matter,  
known to the preeedaig administrations, and offer­  
ing nothing new to call for investigations, which  
those nearest the dates of the transactions had not  
thought proper to institute.  
In the course of the communications made to me  
on the subject of the conspiracy of Aaron Burr, I  
sometimes received letters, some ol them annony­  
nious, some under names true or false, expressing  
suspicions and insinuations against general Wilkin­  
son. But one only of them, and that annnymous,  
specified any particular fact, and that fact was one  
of these which had been already communicated to a  
former administration.  
No other information within the purview of the  
requestof the house, is Known to have been receiv­  
ed, by any department ol the government, 1mm the  
establishment of the nresent ledera! government.—  
That which has h&#x27; o recently communicated to  
the house ol represent lives, and by them to  
is the fitst (hurt testimony ever made known to  
me, charging general Wilkinson with a corrupt le­  
ceipt of money : and the bouse of representatives  
may be assured that the duties which this informa­  
tion devolves on me shall he exercbod with vigo­  
rous inip.utialitv. Should any want of powei m  
the court to compel the rendering ol testimony ob­  
struct lhat lull and lmpaitial inquiry which alone  
can establish guilt or innocence, and satisfy j.slice,

To the House of Representatives of the  
United States.  
Some day* previous to your resoluti- i  
ons of the 13th iost. a court of enquiry  
had beesi instituted, at the request of  
gtn. Wilkinson, charged to make the  
enquiry into his conduct which the first  
resolution desires, and commenced their  
proceedings. To the judge advocate of  
that court the papers aod information on  
that subject, transmitted to me by the  
house Of representatives, have been de­  
. livered to be used according to the rules  
and powers of that court.  
&#x27;1 he request of a communication of  
any information which may have been  
received, at any time since the establish­  
ment of the present government, touch­  
ing combinations wid) foreign agents for  
disiue inhering the union, or the corrupt  
receipt of money by any ofleerof the U­  
nited States, from the agents of foreign  
governments, can be complied with but  
In a partial degree.  
It it well understood that ib the first  
or second t ear of the presidency of gen.  
Washington information was given to  
him relating to certain combinations  
tyith the agents of a foreign government,  
for the dismemberment of the union;  
which combinations had taken place be­  
fore the establishment of the present fe­  
deral government. Thu information,  
however, is believed never to have been  
deposited in any public office, or left w  
that of the president&#x27;s secretary ; these  
having been duly examined i but to have  
been considered at personally confiden­  
tial, and therefore retained among his  
pnvate papers. A communication from  
the governor of Virginth to President j  
i Washington, is found in dU office of the  
President’s secretary, which, although ;  
not strictly within the terms of the te- i  
quest of the house of representatives, V*  
communicated, inasmuch as it may throw j  
some light on the subjects of our corres­  
pondence of that time, between certain j  
  
foreign agents“Jld citizens ofiffr  
States.  
ln (fee first or aecoud yeajrbf the ?d­  
miaietration of president Adams, Ait­  
drew Kllicott, then tmploved in desig­  
nating, in conjunction with the Spnri^h  
authorities, the boundaries between the  
territoiie* pf the United States, and  
Spain, under the treaty with that potion,  
communicated to the executive of the  
United States, papers and information  
respecting the subjects of the present in­  
quiry, which urer* deposited in the  
office of state. Copies of these are now  
transmitted to the house of representa­  
tives, except of a single letter and a re­  
ference from the Mid Andrew Ellieott,  
which being expressly desired to be kept  
secret, is therefore not communicated:  
hut its contents can be obtained from  
himself in a more fogal form ; aad direc­  
tions have been given to summon him to  
appear aa a witness before the court of  
inquiry. | *  
A paper on the commerce of Louisi­  
ana, bearing date the ltth of April, one  
thousand seven hundred and ninety­  
eight, is found in the office of state, sun­  
Soted to have been communicated by  
Ir. Daniel Clarke, of New-Orleans,  
then a subject of Spain, and now of the  
house of representatives of the 17. S.  
Mating certain commercial transactions  
of gen. Wilkinson is N. Orleans: ait  
extract from this is now communicated,  
because it contains facta which may have  
tome bearing on the queatioas relating,  
to him. &#x27; f.  
The destruction of the war-office by  
fire, in the close of one thousand eight  
hundred, involved all information it con­  
tained at that date.  
  
The paper* already described, there­  
fore, constitute the whole of the infor­  
mation on these subjects, deposited  
in the public offices, during the preced­  
ing administrations, as iar as has yet  
been found: but it cannot tie affirmed  
that there may be no other, because the  
papers of ths offices being filed, for the  
most part, alphabetically, unless aided  
by the suggestion of any particular name  
which may have given such information-,  
nothing short of a careful examination of  
the papers in the offices generally could  
authorize such an affirmation. \ •  
About a twelvemonth after I came to  
the administration of the government,  
Mr. Clarke gave some vetbal ii^umau­  
on to myself, as well as to the secretary  
of state, relating to the same combinati-r  
ons for the dismemberment of the uni­  
on—He was listened to freely ; and he  
then delivered the letter ,of gat Ciay­  
oso addressed to himself, of which *  
copy is now communicated. After hia  
return to N. Orleans he forwarded to  
the secretary of state, other papers, with  
a request that after perusal they should  
i kur^t. 1 his however was not done j.  
: un«I hr* u-9« ca __i t... .1  
secretary of state, and that they  
would be held subject to his Orders.  
1 hese papers have not yet been found is  
the office. A letter therefore has been  
addressed to the former chief clerk, who  
mav perhaps give information respect­  
ing them. As far as our memories en­  
ahle u* to say, they related only to lire  
combinations before spoken of, and not  
« all to the corrupt receipt of money by  
any officer of the l/nited States; conse­  
quently they respected what was consi­  
dered as *. dead matter, known u the  
preceding administrations, and offering  
nothing new to call for investigations,  
which those nearest the dates of the trans­  
actions had not tho’t proper to institute.  
In the course of the communications  
•piracy of Aaron Burr, I sometimes re­  
ceived letters, tome of them anonymous,  
some under names true or false, expres­  
sing suspicions Mid insinuations agninc.t  
general Wilkinson. But one only vf  
them, and that anonymous, specified  
any particular fact, and that fact was one  
of those which had been already com­  
municated to a former administration, .  
No other information within the pur­  
view of the request of the house, is  
known to have been received, by any  
department of the government, from the  
establishment of the present federal go-&quot;

boufe of representatives, have been de­  
livered to be used according to the  
rules and powers of that couri.  
The request of a communication of  
any information which have been re.  
ccived, at any time {ince the eftablith­  
ment of the present government,  
touching combinations with foreign  
agents for dismembering the union, or  
the corrupt receipt of money by any  
officer of the United States, from the  
agents of foreign governments, can be  
complied with but in a partial degree.  
It is well understood that in the firlt  
or second year of the presidency of  
General Walhington, information was  
given to him relating to certain com­  
binations with the agents of a foreign 1  
government, for the dismemberment  
of the Union : which combinations |  
had taken place before the establish- |  
ment of the present federal govern- l  
ment. This information however, is i  
believed never to have been deposited  
in any public office, or left in that of &#x27;  
the president’s secretary ; these having |  
been duly examined : but to have been |  
considered as personally confidential, |  
and therefore rztained among his pri. |  
vate papers. A communication from ‘  
the governor of Virginia to president  
Wathington, is found in the office of |  
the President’s secretary, which altho’  
not {tri¢tly within the terms of the re­  
quest of the house of representatives,  
is communicated, inasmuch as it may  
throw some light on the fubjeés of  
the correspondence at that time, be­  
tween certain foreign agents and cit­  
izens of the United States. i  
In the firit or second year of the |  
administration of President Adams,  
Andrew Ellicot then employed in de- |  
fignating in conjund&amp;ion with the J  
Spanish authorities, the boundaries be­  
tween the territories of the United  
States and Spain, under the treaty |  
with that nation, communicated to 1  
the executive of the United States, pa­  
pers and information refpeding the  
fubj=éts of the present inquiry which  
were deposited in the office of state.—  
Copies of these are now transmitted  
to the House of Representatives ex- l  
cept of a single letter and a reference  
from the said Andrew Ellicot, which |  
being expressly desired to be kept se­  
cret, is therefore not communicated ;  
but its contents can be obtained from  
himfeif in a more legal form ; and di­  
reftions have been given to summon 1  
him to appear as a witness before she  
court of inquiry. -  
- A paper “on the commerce of  
Louisiana” bearing date the eigh- }  
teenth of April, one thousand seven  
hundred and ninety-eight, is found in 1  
the office of state, supposed to have  
been communicated by Mr. Daniel  
Clark, of New-Orleans, then a fubje&amp;  
of Spain and now of the House of  
Representatives of the United States,  
stating certain commercial tranfaétions  
of General Wilkinson in New. O­  
rleans; an extraét from this is now ‘  
communicated, because it contains ]  
fa&amp;ts which may have some bearing  
on the gneftions relating to him. - ,  
~ The defiru&amp;@ion of the war office by  
fire, in the close of one thousand eight  
hundred, involved all information it  
contained at that date., 4  
_ The papers already defcribed,there.  
fore conftitnte the whole of the infor.  
mation on these fubjeéts, deposited in  
the public offices, dui-&#x27;infg the preced.  
‘ing administrations as far as has yet  
been found : but it cannot be affirm.  
ed that there may be no other, be.  
cause the papers of the offices being  
filed, for the mofk part, alphabetically,  
‘ualefs aided by the fuggeltion of any  
War name which may have giy­  
  
2 careful examination of the papersin |  
the offices generally, could authorize  
such an 2ffirmation. .  
About a twelvemonth after I came  
to the administration of the govern.  
ment, Mr. Clark gave {fome verbal in­  
formation to myfelf, as well as to the  
secretary of Rate, relsting to the fame­  
combinations for the dismemberment  
of the union. He was liltened to free­  
ly ; and he that delivered the letter of  
Gov. Gayqfe, addrefled to himfelf, of  
which a copy is now communicated.  
After his return to New-Orleans, he |  
forwarded to the secretary of state,  
other papers, with a request that af­  
ter perusal they should be burnt.—  
This however was not done ; and he  
was {o informed by the secretary of  
state, and that they would be held  
fubje&amp; to his orders. These papers  
have not yet been found in the office.  
A letter therefore has been addrefled  
to the former chief clerk, who may  
perhaps give information respecting  
them. As far as our memories ena­  
ble us to fay, they related only to the  
combinations before {poken of, and  
not at all to the corrupt receipt of  
money by any officer of the United  
States : Consequently they respected  
what was conlfidered as a dead mat.  
ter, known to the preceding adminil­  
trations, and offering nothing new to  
call for investigations, which those  
nearelt the dates of the tranfaéions  
had not thought proper to institute.  
In the course of the communica.  
tions made to me on the fubje&amp; of the  
conspiracy of Aaron Burr, I some­  
times received letters, some of them  
anonymous, some under names true  
or falfe, expressing suspicions and in­  
sinuations againlt Gen. Wilkinson.—  
But one only of them, and that anon.  
ymous, fpecified any particular fa&amp;,  
and that fa&amp;t was one of those which  
. had been already communicated to a  
former administration,  
No other information within the  
purview of the request of the house,  
is known to have been received, by  
any department of the government,  
from the eflablithment of the present  
federal government.—That which has  
been recently communicited to the  
house of representatives, and by them  
to me, is-the firft dire@ testimony ev­  
er made known to me, charging gen­  
eral Wilkinson with a corrupt receipt  
of money : and the house of reprefea­  
tatives may be aflured that the duties  
which this information devolves on  
me shall be exercised with vigorous  
impartiality. Should any want of  
power in the court to compel the ren­  
dering of tellimony obftru&amp;@ that full  
and impartial inquiry which alone can  
eftablith guile or innocence, and fatis­  
fy jultice, the legislative authority on­  
ly will be competent to the remedy,
