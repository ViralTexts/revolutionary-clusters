Col Laurens, who will have the honor of delivering you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project, which I think, in the present situation of affairs there, is a very good one and deserves every kind of support and encouragement. This is to raise two three or four batalions of negroes; with the assistance of the government of that state, by contributions from the owners in proportion to the number they possess. If you should think proper to enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail of his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by Congress to the state; and, as an inducement, that they would engage to take those batalions into Continental pay.  
It appears to me, that an expedient of this kind, in the present state of Southern affairs, is the most rational, that can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected in that quarter without it; and the enemy’s operations there are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have not the least doubt, that the negroes will make very excellent soldiers, with proper management; and I will venture to pronounce, that they cannot be put in better hands than those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, enterprise, and every other qualification requisite to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some great military judges, that with sensible officers soldiers can hardly be too stupid; and on this principle it is thought that the Russians would make the best troops in the world, if they were under other officers than their own. The King of Prussia is among the number who maintain this doctrine and has a very emphatical saying on the occasion, which I do not exactly recollect. I mention this, because I frequently hear it objected to the scheme of embodying negroes that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This is so far from appearing to me a valid objection that I think their want of cultivation (for their natural faculties are probably as good as ours) joined to that habit of subordination which they acquire from a life of servitude, will make them sooner became soldiers than our White inhabitants. Let officers be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers approach to machines perhaps the better.  
I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience; and an unwillingness to part with property of so valuable a kind will furnish a thousand arguments to show the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme which requires such a sacrifice. But it should be considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will; and that the best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out will be to offer them ourselves. An essential part of the plan is to give them their freedom with their muskets. This will secure their fidelity, animate their courage, and I believe will have a good influence upon those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the project; for the dictates of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favour of this unfortunate class of men.  
When I am on the subject of Southern affairs, you will excuse the liberty I take, in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently vigorous are persuing for our defence in that quarter. Except the few regular troops of South Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the militia of that and the two neighbouring states. These will soon grow impatient of service and leave our affairs in a very miserable situation. No considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia—to say nothing of many obvious and well known inconveniences, that attend this kind of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, Sir, that no time ought to be lost in making a draft of militia to serve a twelve month from the States of North and South Carolina and Virginia. But South Carolina being very weak in her population of whites may be excused from the draft on condition of furnishing the black batalions. The two others may furnish about 3,500 men and be exempted on that account from sending any succours to this army. The states to the Northward of Virginia will be fully able to give competent supplies to the army here; and it will require all the force and exertions of the three states I have mentioned to withstand the storm which has arisen and is increasing in the South.  
The troops drafted must be thrown into batalions and officered in the best manner we can. The supernumerary officers may be made use of as far as they will go.  
If arms are wanted for these troops and no better way of supplying them is to be found, we should endeavour to levy a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear this Southern business will become a very grave one.  
With the truest respect &amp; esteem   I am Sir   Your most Obed servant

HEAD Q I, March 14th, 1779   
  
Afar Sir: Colonel Lauren., who will have   
the honor of delivering you this letter, is on   
his way to South Carolina on a project which   
I think, in the present situation of affeiri there,   
is a very good one and deserves every kind of   
support and encouragemtint. This is to raise   
two, three or four battalion. of iiegroes with   
the assistance of the government of the State,   
by contributions from the owners in proper•   
lion to the another they possess. If you think   
proper to enter upon the subject with him he   
will give you a detail of his plan. He wishes   
to have at recommended by Congress to the   
State; and as an inducement, that they would   
engage to take these twain:me into Continen­  
tal pay.   
  
It appears to me that an expedient of this   
kind, in the present state of Southern afLaln, is   
the most rational that,ean be adopted, and pro­  
misee very important advantages. Indeed, I   
hardly see how a sufficient force ran be collect­  
ed in that quarter without it ; and the enemy&#x27;s   
operations there are growing Infinitely serious   
and formidable. I have not the least doubt   
that the navvye will make very exeelient nei­  
ther. with proper management; and I will van..   
tare to pronounce that they cannot be put Into   
better hands than those of Mr, Laurens. Hs,   
has all the seal, intelligence, enterprise, aid.   
every other qualification necessary to se— -

officera„soldiers can hardly be too stupid; sod   
on this firloolple it is thought that the Riltliallff   
would make the but troops In the world, if they   
were under other officers than their own. The   
King of Prussia Is among the number who   
maintain this dootrine,and has a very empha tint   
raying on the occasion, which I do not exactly   
remember. I mention this because I hear it   
frequently objected to the scheme of imbodying   
negroes that they are too stupid to make sol­  
diers. This is so far from appearing to me a   
valid objection, that I think their want of culti­  
vation (for their natural faculties are probably   
as good as ours,i jellied to that habit of subor­  
dination which they may acquire from • life of

diers than our white inhabitants. Let ,freers   
be man of HMSO and sentiment, and the nearer   
the soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the   
better.   
  
I foresee that thin project will hive to coin   
bat much opposition from prejudice and self

to intertaio for the black., makes us fancy   
many thing. that are founded neither in mason

scheme which requires such a sacr4e. But   
at should be considered, that if we do not mak*

will ; and the beet way to counteract the

HEADQUARTERS, March 14.1779/  
DEAR SIBJ Col.: Laurens, whprw^ bftve  
the honor of delivering this letter to you  
on his way to South Carolina, on a pro­  
ject, which 1 think iu the present situation  
of affairs there, is a good ono, andxieservee  
every kind of support and encouragement.  
This is to raise two, three, or tour battal­  
lions of negroes, with the assistance of the  
government of that State, by contributions  
from the owners jo proportionto the. uiii­  
berthey possess&quot;. ,&#x27;  
  
It appears to ,Jtne ^haf an experiment of  
this kind in the present condition of South­  
ern affairs, is the most rational that can be  
adopted, and promises very important ad­  
vantages. Indeed, Ir hardly see how a suf­  
ficient force can be collected, in that quar­  
ter without it. &quot;iThc enemy&#x27;s operatious  
there are growing indefinitely serious and  
formidable. I have not the least doubt  
that the negroes will make-. very excellent  
soldiers, with proper management and I  
will venture to pronounce that they can­  
not be put into better hands than those of  
Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelli­  
gence, enterprise arid every other qualific­  
tion requisite to succeed in such an under­  
taking.  
  
I have frequently heard it objected to  
the scheme of employing negroes^ that  
they are too stupid to make soldiers.—  
This is so. far from appearing a valid ob­  
jection that I think their want of cultiva­  
tion, for their natural faculties are as ours,  
joined to that habit of subordination  
which they acquire from a life of servi  
tude, will enable them, sooner, to become  
soldiers than our white inhabitants. Let  
officers be men of sense and sentiment, and  
the nearer the soldiers approach to ma­  
chines the better. The contempt we have  
been taught to entertain for the blacks  
make us fancy many things tnat are found­  
ed neither on reason nor experience.  
But it should be considered that it we do  
not make use of them this way the enemy  
probably will—and the best way to coun­  
teract the temptations they will hold out  
will be to offer them ourselves. An es­  
sential part of the plan is to give them  
their freedom with their sword-*. This  
will secure fidelity, animate their courage,  
and, I believe, will have a good influence  
upon those who remain—by opening a  
door to their emancipation. This circum­

policy equally interest me iu favor of this  
unfortunate class of men.

&quot;HEADqUARTErS, March 14, 1770  
  
o Jo JaSi, Col, Laurens, who  
will have the honor of delivering you this  
letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on  
a project which I think in the present sit  
uation of affairs there is a very good one,  
and deserves every kind of support and  
encouragement. This is, to raise two,  
three or four battalions of negroes, with  
the assistance of the Government of that  
State, by contributions from the owners, in  
proportion to the number they possess. If  
you should think proper to enter upon the  
subject with him, he will give you a detail  
of his plan. He wishes to have it recom  
mended by Congress to the State; and, as  
an inducement, that they should engage to  
take those battalions into continental pay.  
&quot;It appears to me that an expedient of  
this kind, in the present state of Southern  
affairs, is the most rational that can be  
adopted, and promises very important ad  
vantages. Indeed, I can hardly see how a  
sufficient force can be collected in that  
quarter without it; and the enemy&#x27;s opera­  
tions are growing infinitely more serions  
and formidable. I have not the least doubt  
the negroes will make very excellent sol  
diers, with proper management; and I will  
venture to pronounce that they cannot be  
put into better hands than those a  
Aaurens he has all the seal, intelligence,  
enterprise, and every other qualification  
necessary to succeed in such an undertal-  
ing. It is a maxim with some great mili­  
tary judges, that, with sensible officers, sol  
diers can hardly be too stupid; and, on this  
principle, it is thought that the Russians  
would make the best troops in the world, if  
they were under other officers than their  
own.  
&quot;The King of Prussia is among the  
number who maintain this doctrine, and  
has a very emphatic saying on the occa­  
sion, which I do not exactly recollect. I  
mention this because I hear it frequently  
objected to the scheme of embodying ne­  
groes, that they are too stupid to make sol­  
diers. This is so far from appearing to me  
a valid objection that I think their want of  
cultivation (for their natural facilities are  
probably as good as ours), joined to that  
habit of subordination which they acquire  
from a life of servitude, will make them  
sooner become soldiers than our white in­  
habitants. Let officers be men of sense  
and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers  
approach to machines perhaps the better.  
&quot;I foresee that this project will have to  
combat much opposition from prejudice and  
self-interest. The contempt we have been  
taught to entertain for the blacks makes us  
fancy many things that are founded neith­  
er in reason nor experience; and an un­  
willingness to part with property of so  
valuable a kind will furnish a thousand  
arguments to show the impracticability or  
pernicious tendency of a scheme which re­  
quires such a sacrifice. But it should be  
considered that if we do not make use of  
them in this way the enemy probably will,  
and that the best way to counteract the  
propositions they will hold out will to offer  
to them ourselves. An essential part of  
the plan woutd give them their freedom  
with their sarvices. This will secure their  
fidelity, animate their courage, and, I be  
lieve have a good influence upon those who  
remain, by opening a door to their emanci­  
pation. This circumstance, I confess, has  
no small weight in inducing me to wish the  
success of the project; for the dictates of  
humahity and true policy equally interest  
me in favor of this unfortunate class of  
men.

‘ While I am on the subject of Southern  
affairs, you will excuse the liberty I take in  
saying, that I do not think measures suffi-  
ciently vigorous are pursuing for our defense  
in that quarter. Except the few regular  
troops of South-Carolina, we seem to be re-  
lying wholly on the militia of that and two  
  
the Revolution.  
  
  
  
neighboring States. These will soon grow  
impatient of service, and leave our affairs in  
a miserable situation. No considerable force  
can be uniformly kept up by militia, to  
say nothing of the many obvious and well-  
known inconveniences that attend this kind  
of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, sir,  
that no time ought to be lost in making a  
draft of militia to serve a twelvemonth,  
from the States of North and South-Carolina  
and Virginia. But South-Carolina, being  
very weak in ‘her population of whites, may  
be excused from the draft, on condition  
of furnishing the black battalions. The two  
others may furnish about three thousand  
five hundred men, and be exempted, on that  
account, from sending any succors to this  
army. The States to the northward of Vir-  
ginia will be fully able to give competent  
supplies to the army here; and it will require  
all the force and exertions of the three States  
I have mentioned to withstand the storm  
which has arisen, and is increasing in the  
South.  
  
*The troops draftec must be thrown into  
battalions, and officered in the best possible  
manner. The best supernumerary officers  
may be made use of as far as they will go.  
If arms are wanted for their troops, and no  
better way of supplying them is to be found,  
we should endeavor to levy a contribution  
of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordi-  
nary exigencies demand extraordinary means.  
I fear this Southern business will become a  
very grave one.

‘Heidqimrtem, March It, 1779.  
Dear Sir :—Colonel Laurens, who will ;  
have the honor of delivering you this let-&#x27;  
ter, is on his way to South Carolina on a  
project which 1 think, iu the present situ­  
ation of affairs there, is a very good one ,  
and deserves every kind of support and  
encouragement. This is to raise two,  
three, or four battalions of negroes, with  
the assistance of the government of that  
State, by contributions from tho owners,  
in proportion to the number they possess.  
If you should think proper to enter upon  
the subject with him, he will give you u  
detail of his plan, lie wishes to have it  
recommended to Congress hy the Slate;  
and, as an inducement, that they would j  
engage to take their battalions iuto conti­  
nental pay.  
It appears to me that nn expedient o!  
this kind, in the present state of South­  
ern affairs, is the most rational that can j  
bo adopted, and promises very important |  
advantages. Indeed, 1 hardly see how a j  
sufficient force can be eolleetcl in that  
quarter without it, and the enemy&#x27;s oper- j  
ations there are growing infinitely seri­  
ous and formidable. I have not the least I  
doubt that the negroes will make very ex­  
cellent soldiers, witu proper management;1  
and I will venture to pronounce, that they |  
cannot ho put into better hands than those 1  
of Mr. Laurens. Ho has all the zeal,  
| intelligence, enterprise, and every other j  
j qualification requisite to succeed in such j  
ati undertaking. It is a maxim with  
some great military judges, that with sen­  
1 sible officers, soldiers can hardly be too  
I stupid ; and, on this principle, it is  
thought that the Russians would make  
the best soldiers in the world it they  
i were under other officers than their own.  
i The King of Prussia is umong tho nura­  
] ber who maintains this doctrine, and has  
a very emphatic saying on tho occasion  
which I do not exactly recollect. I men­  
tion this bocausc 1 have frequently heard  
! it objected to the soheme of employing  
&#x27; negroes, that they aro too stupid to make  
soldiers. This is so far from appearing  
tp me a valid objection, that J think their  
&gt;  
  
want of cultivation, (for their natural fac­  
ulties are as good as ours,) joined to that  
habit of subordination which they acquire  
from a life of servitude, will enable thorn  
sooner to become soldiers than our white  
inhabitants. Let officers be men of sense  
and sentiment, and the nearer the soldiers  
approach to machines, perhaps, the bet­  
ter.  
I foresee that this project will have to  
combat much opposition frt m prejudice  
and self-interest. The contempt we have  
been taught to entertain for the makes us  
fancy many things that are founded neith­  
er in reason nor experience ; and an un­  
willingness to part with property of so  
valuable a kind will furnish a thousand  
arguments to show the impracticability,  
or pernicious tendency, of a scheme which  
requires such sacrifice. But it should bo  
considered that if we do not make use of  
them in this way the enemy probably will;  
and that the best way to counteract the  
temptations they hold out will bo to oiler  
ourselves. An essential part of the plan  
is to give them their freedom with their  
swords. This will secure their fidelity,  
animate their courage, and, 1 believe,will  
have a good influence upon those who re­  
main, by opening a door to their emanci­  
pation. This circumstance, I confess, has  
no small weight in inducing me to wish  
the success of the project; for the dic­  
tates of humanity and true policy equally  
interest me in favor of this unfortunate  
class of men.”

HEADOUARtErs, March 14, 1779.  
Dear Str: Col. Laurens, who will have  
the honor of defivering you this letter, is  
on his way to South Carorina, on a pro  
ject which I think, in the present situa  
tion of affairs there, is a very good one,  
and deserves every kind of support and  
encouragement. This is to raise three  
or four battalions of negroes, with the  
assistance of the Government of that  
State, by contributions from the owners,  
in proportion to the number they possess  
He wishes to have this plan recommend  
ed by Congress to the State, and, as an  
inducement, that they would engage to  
take their battalions into Continental  
pay. It seems to me that an expedient of  
this kind, in the present state of South  
ern affairs, is the most rational that can  
be adopted, and promises very impor-.  
tant advantages. I have not the least  
doubt that, with proper management,  
the negroes will make excellent soldiers.  
It is a maxim with some great military  
judges, that with sensible officers sol  
diers can hardly be too sxupid; and, on  
this principle, it is thought that the Rus­  
sians would make the best soldiers in  
the world under other officers than their  
own. The King of Prussia is among  
the number of those who maintain this  
doctrine, and has a very emphatic say

recollect. I mention this because I  
have frequently heard it objected  
to the scheme of embodying ne  
groes that they are too stupid to  
make soldiers. This is so far from  
appearing to me a valid objection, that I  
think their want of cultivation--for their  
natural faculties are as good as ourt  
joined to that habit of subordination  
which they acquire from a life of servi  
tude, will enable them sooner to become  
oldiers than our white inhabitants. I

makes us fancy many things that are
