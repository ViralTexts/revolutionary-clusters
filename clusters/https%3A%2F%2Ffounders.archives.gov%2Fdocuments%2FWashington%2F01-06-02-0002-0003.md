GW’s niece at Dumfries was Mildred Washington Lee, daughter of John Augustine Washington. Her husband Thomas Lee (1758–1805), a son of Richard Henry Lee, was practicing law in the town at this time.

Monday 11th. Took an early breakfast at Kinners—bated at one Rawlings’s half way between that &amp; Richmd.—and dined at the latter about 3 Oclock. On my arrival was Saluted by the Cannon of the place—waited on by the Governor and other Gentlemen—and saw the City alluminated at Night.  
  
  
  
GW arrived in Richmond about 2:00 P.M. and during the evening “viewd the Capitol” (Va. Gaz. [Richmond], 13 April 1791; James Currie to Thomas Jefferson, 13 April 1791, DLC: Jefferson Papers). Beverley Randolph served as governor of Virginia 1788–91.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Tuesday 12th. In company with the Governor, The Directors of the James River Navigation Company—the Manager &amp; many other Gentlemen. I viewed the Canal, Sluces, Locks &amp; other Works between the City of Richmond &amp; Westham. These together have brought the navigation to within a mile and half, or a Mile and ¾ of the proposed Bason; from which the Boats by means of Locks are to communicate with the tide water Navigation below. The Canal is of Sufficient depth every where but in places not brought to its proper width; it seems to be perfectly secure against Ice, Freshes &amp; drift Wood. The locks at the head of these works are simple—altogether of hewn stone, except the gates &amp; Cills and very easy &amp; convenient to work. There are two of them, each calculated to raise &amp; lower 6 feet. They cost, according to the Manager’s, Mr. Harris acct. about £3,000 but I could see nothing in them to require such a sum to erect them. The sluces in the River, between these locks and the mouth of the Canal are well graduated and easy of assent. To complete the Canal from the point to which it is now opened, and the Locks at the foot of them Mr. Harris thinks will require 3 years. Received an Address from the Mayor, Aldermen &amp; Common Council of the City of Richmond at Three oclock, &amp; dined with the Governor at four Oclock.  
In the course of my enquiries—chiefly from Colo. Carrington—I cannot discover that any discontents prevail among the people at large, at the proceedings of Congress. The conduct of the Assembly respecting the assumption he thinks is condemned by them as intemperate &amp; unwise and he seems to have no doubt but that  
  
the Excise law—as it is called—may be executed without difficulty—nay more, that it will become popular in a little time. His duty as Marshall having carried him through all parts of the State lately, and of course given him the best means of ascertaining the

h had discharged much of its war debt, to pay part of the heavy debts that some northern states still had outstanding. Declaring the act warranted by “neither policy, justice, nor the constitution,” the assembly petitioned Congress on 16 Dec. 1790 to revise the act generally and in particular to repeal the part relating to the assumption of state debts (ASP, Finance,Walter Lowrie et al., eds.

Friday 15th. Having suffered very much by the dust yesterday and finding that parties of Horse, &amp; a number of other Gentlemen were intendg. to attend me part of the way to day, I caused their enquiries respecting the time of my setting out, to be answered that, I should endeavor to do it before eight O’clock; but I did it a little after five, by which means I avoided the inconveniences abovementioned.  
I came twelve miles to breakfast, at one Jesse Lees, a tavern newly set up upon a small scale, and 15 miles farther to dinner and where I lodged, at the House of one Oliver, which is a good one for horses, and where there are tolerable clean beds. For want

Saturday 16th. Got into my Carriage a little after 5 Oclock, and travelled thro’ a cloud of dust until I came within two or three miles of Hix’ ford when it began to rain. Breakfasted at one Andrews’  
  
a small but decent House about a mile after passing the ford (or rather the bridge) over Meherrin river. Although raining moderately, but with appearances of breaking up, I continued my journey—induced to it by the crouds which were coming into a general Muster at the Court House of Greensville who would I presumed soon have made the Ho. I was in too noizy to be agreeable. I had not however rode two miles before it began to be stormy, &amp; to rain violently which, with some intervals, it contind. to do the whole afternoon. The uncomfortableness of it, for Men &amp; Horses, would have induced me to put up; but the only Inn short of Hallifax having no stables in wch. the horses could be comfortable, &amp; no Rooms or beds which appeared tolerable, &amp; every thing else having a dirty appearance, I was compelled to keep on to Hallifax; 27 miles from Andrews—48 from Olivers and 75 from Petersburgh. At this place (i.e., Hallifax) I arrived about Six Oclock, after crossing the Roanoke on the South bank of which it stands.

Hallifax is the first town I came to after passing the line between the two states, and is about 20 Miles from it. To this place Vessels by the aid of Oars &amp; setting poles are brought for the produce which comes to this place and others along the River; and may be carried 8 or 10 Miles higher to the falls which are neither great nor of much extent; above these (which are called the great falls) there are others; but none but what may with a little improvement be passed. This town stands upon high ground; and it  
  
is the reason given for not placing it at the head of the navigation there being none but low grounds between it and the falls. It seems to be in a decline, &amp; does not it is said contain a thousand souls

Sunday 17th. Colo. Ashe Representative of the district in which this town stands, and several other Gentlemen called upon, and invited me to partake of a dinner which the Inhabitants were desirous of seeing me at &amp; excepting it dined with them accordingly.  
  
  
  
“The reception of the President at Halifax,” wrote Samuel Johnston of Edenton to James Iredell on 23 May 1791, “was not such as we could wish tho in every other part of the Country he was treated with proper attention.” There is a local tradition that the dinner for GW was held at the Eagle Tavern near the river (HENDERSONArchibald Henderson. Washington’s Southern Tour, 1791. Boston and New York, 1923., 75–76). John Baptista Ashe (see entry for 1 April 1790) served in Congress 1789–93. He was later elected governor of North Carolina but died before his inauguration.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Monday 18th. Set out by Six oclock—dined at a small house kept by one Slaughter 22 Miles from Hallifax and lodged at Tarborough 14 Miles further.  
This place is less than Hallifax, but more lively and thriving; it is situated on Tar River which goes into Pamplico Sound and is crossed at the Town by means of a bridge a great height from the Water and notwithstanding the freshes rise sometimes nearly to the arch. Corn, Porke and some Tar are the exports from it. We were recd. at this place by as good a salute as could be given with one piece of artillery.

Tuesday 19th. At 6 Oclock I left Tarborough accompanied by some of the most respectable people of the place for a few Miles. Dined at a trifling place called Greenville 25 Miles distant and lodged at one Allans 14 Miles further a very indifferent house without stabling which for the first time since I commenced my Journey were obliged to stand without a cover.  
Greenville is on Tar River and the exports the same as from Tarborough with a greater proportion of Tar—for the lower down the greater number of Tar markers [makers] are there. This article is, contrary to all ideas one would entertain on the subject, rolled as Tobacco by an axis which goes through both heads. One horse draws two barrels in this manner.  
  
  
  
Greenville, N.C., seat of Pitt County, was incorporated in 1771 as Martinsborough; its name was changed in 1786 to honor Nathanael Greene. Allen’s tavern was run by Shadrach Allen (born c.1752) of Pitt County, one of the county’s delegates to the state legislature 1788–89 and to the state convention of 1789 that ratified the United States Constitution. In 1790 he had 8 whites in his household and 15 slaves (HEADS OF FAMILIES, N.C.Heads of Families at the First Census of the United States Taken in the Year 1790: North Carolina. 1908. Reprint. Baltimore, 1966., 148).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 20th. Left Allans before breakfast, &amp; under a misapprehension went to a Colo. Allans, supposing it to be a public house; where we were very kindly &amp; well entertained without knowing it was at his expence until it was too late to rectify the mistake. After breakfasting, &amp; feeding our horses here, we proceeded on &amp; crossing the River Nuse 11 miles further, arrived in Newbern to dinner.  
At this ferry which is 10 miles from Newbern, we were met by a small party of Horse; the district Judge (Mr. Sitgreave) and many of the principal Inhabitts. of Newbern, who conducted us into town to exceeding good lodgings. It ought to have been mentioned that another small party of horse under one Simpson, met us at Greensville, and in spite of every endeavor which could comport with decent civility, to excuse myself from it, they would attend me to Newburn. Colo. Allan did the same.  
This town is situated at the confluence of the rivers Nuse &amp; Trent, and though low is pleasant. Vessels drawing more than 9 feet Water cannot get up loaded. It stands on a good deal of  
  
ground, but the buildings are sparce and altogether of Wood; some of which are large &amp; look well. The number of Souls are about 2000. Its exports consist of Corn, Tobacco, Pork—but principally of Naval stores &amp; lumber

This town by Water is about 70 miles from the Sea but in a direct line to the entrance of the river not over 35 and to the nearest Seaboard not more than 20, or 25. Upon the River Nuse, &amp; 80 miles above Newbern, the Convention of the State that adopted the federal Constitution made choice of a Spot, or rather district within which to fix their Seat of Government; but it being lower than the back Members (of the Assembly) who hitherto have been most numerous inclined to have it they have found means to obstruct the measure but since the Cession of their Western territory it is supposed that the matter will be revived to good effect.

. At these I dined with the Commee. whose company I asked.  
The whole road from Newbern to Wilmington (except in a few places of small extent) passes through the most barren country I ever beheld; especially in the parts nearest the latter; which is no other than a bed of white Sand. In places, however, before we  
  
came to these, if the ideas of poverty could be seperated from the Land, the appearances of it are agreeable, resembling a lawn well covered with evergreens and a good verdure below from a broom or course grass which having sprung since the burning of the woods had a neat &amp; handsome look especially as there were parts entirely open and others with ponds of water which contributed not a little to the beauty of the Scene.  
Wilmington is situated on Cape Fear River, about 30 Miles by water from its mouth, but much less by land. It has some good houses pretty compactly built—The whole undr. a hill; which is formed entirely of Sand. The number of Souls in it amount by the enumeration to about 1000, but it is agreed on all hands that the Census in this state has been very inaccurately &amp; shamefully taken by the Marshall’s deputies; who, instead of going to Peoples houses, &amp; there, on the spot, ascertaining the Nos.; have advertised a meeting of them at certain places, by which means those who did not attend (and it seems many purposely avoided doing it, some from an apprehension of its being introductory of a tax, &amp; others from religious scruples) have gone, with their families, unnumbered. In other instances, it is said these deputies have taken their information from the Captains of militia companies; not only as to the men on their Muster Rolls, but of the souls in their respective families; which at best, must in a variety of cases, be mere conjecture whilst all those who are not on their lists—Widows and their families &amp;ca. pass unnoticed.  
Wilmington, unfortunately for it, has a mud bank  miles below, ovr. which not more than 10 feet water can be brought at common tides; yet it is said vessels of 250 Tonns have come up. The qty. of shipping, which load here annually, amounts to about 12,000 Tonns. The exports consist chiefly of Naval Stores and lumber—Some Tobacco, Corn, Rice &amp; flax seed with Porke. It is at the head of the tide navigation: but inland navigation may be extended 115 miles farther to and above Fayettesville which is from Wilmington 90 miles by land, &amp; 1

Halifax is the first town I ca me  
to after passing the line between the  
two states, and is about 20 miles  
from it. To this place vessels by  
the aid of Oars and Setting poles  
are brought, for the produce, which  
comes to this place, and others along  
the river; and may be carried 8 or 10  
miles higher to the falls, which are  
neither great nor of much extent;  
above these (which are called the  
great falls) there are others; but  
none but what may, with a little  
improvement, be passed. This town  
stands upon high ground; and it is  
the reason given for not placing it  
at the head of the navigation there  
being none but low ground between  
it, and the falls. It seems to be in

Sunday 17 th: Col. Ashe, the

which this town stands, and several  
others, gentlemen, called upon,  
and invited me to partake of a din­

dined, with them accordingly.  
Monday 18th : Set out by six  
o&#x27;clock, dined at a small house kept  
bv one Slaughter, 22 miles from  
Halifax, and lodged at Tarborough,  
14 miles further.  
This place is less than Halifax,  
but more lively and thriving : it is  
situated on Tar River, which goes  
into Pamlico Sound, and is crossed  
at the Town, by means of a bridge,  
a great height from the water, and  
notwithstanding the freshes rise  
sometimes,nearly to the arch. Corn,  
Porke, and some Tar are the exports
