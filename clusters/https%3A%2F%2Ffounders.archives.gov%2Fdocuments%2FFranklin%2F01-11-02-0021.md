March 6, 1764.  
In Obedience to the Order of the House, we have examined the Journals of the House of Commons, and do find, that respecting the Practice and Usage mentioned in the Petition of divers Inhabitants of the City of Philadelphia, the standing Orders of that House have, for some Years past, been as follow, viz.  
Ordered,  
“That the Sergeant at Arms attending this House do, from time to time, take into his Custody any Stranger or Strangers that he shall see, or be informed of to be, in the House or Gallery, while the House, or any Committee of the House, is sitting; and that no Person, so taken into Custody, be discharged out of Custody, without the special Order of the House.”  
Ordered,  
“That no Member of this House do presume to bring any Stranger or Strangers into the House, or Gallery thereof, while the House is sitting.”  
And we are informed that, in Pursuance of these Orders, the Doors are kept, and no Stranger admitted, for whom Leave has not been expresly asked and given by the House.  
With Regard to the Practice in the Colonies, we have not been able to obtain perfect Information concerning all of them; but we understand, that in the Provinces of Maryland and Virginia the Ass

be, in the house or gallery, whele the house, or any

the House of Commons against the admission of strangers.  
In 1844 a motion was made by Mr. Christie for an inquiry

House do from time to time take into his custody any stranger

of this House. That no member do presume to bring any  
stranger into any part of the House or gallery appropriated to  
the members of the House while the House or a committee
