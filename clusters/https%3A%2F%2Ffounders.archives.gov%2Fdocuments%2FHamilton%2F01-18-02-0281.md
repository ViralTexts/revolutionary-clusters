.  
XV  
This article with more precision than is usual only establishes reciprocally the rule of the most favoured nation. It stipulates that as to the points enumerated Great Britain shall be on no worse footing than other nations but it gives her no preferences. It was impossible to expect that a Treaty could be formed of which this was not the basis.  
  
The last clause but one reserves to Great Britain the right of imposing on American Vessels entering into her ports in Europe and their Cargoes, duties which shall countervail the differences made in our ports between British &amp; American vessels and their Cargoes. This right

ent nations are becoming formulas in modern treaties. They are to be found essentially in our Treaties with France Sweden and partly if not wholly in that with Prussia and in the Treaty of 1786 between France and Great Britain.  
They stipulate  
I   That the enemies of one party shall not arm their privateers in the ports of the other.  
II    That they shall not sell their prizes there.  
III    That they shall not be allowed to purchase more provisions than are sufficient to carry them to the nearest Port of the Prince or State to which they belong.  
  
IV    That the Ships of War &amp; Privateers of the two contracting parties may carry whithersoever they please the prizes made of their respective enemies, without being obliged on entering the ports of each other to pay fees or being detained or seized or subject to search except to prevent infractions of the laws of Revenue navigation &amp; Commerce or having cognizance taken of the validity of their prizes and with free liberty to depart to the places mentioned in their Commissions which they are to shew.  
V    That no shelter or refuge shall be given to such as have made prizes of each others ships or vessels but if forced by stress of weather to enter their departure is to be hastened.  
VI    That while the parties continue in amity they will make no future Treaty inconsistent with these two articles.  
  
But there is this express proviso—that “nothing in the Treaty shall be construed or operate contrary to former &amp; existing public Treaties with other sovereigns or States.”  
Hence while on the one hand these articles make no unreasonable stipulations in favour of G Britain—they can by no possibility interfere with prior stipulations to France or any other Power. If consequently there is any repugnancy the Treaty with Great Britain must give way to those prior Treatie
