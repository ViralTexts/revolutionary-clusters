For The Minerva.  
The French republic have, at various times, during the present war, complained of certain principles, and decisions of the American government, as being violations of its neutrality, or infractions of the treaty made with France in the year 1778. These complaints were principally made in the year 1793, and explanations, which, till now, were deemed satisfactory, were made by Mr. Jefferson’s correspondence, in August of that year. They are now not only renewed with great exaggeration, but the French government have directed that it should be done in the tone of reproach, instead of the language of friendship. The apparent intention of this menacing tone, at this particular time, is to influence timid minds to vote agreeable to their wishes in the election of president and vice-president, and probably with this view, the memorial was published in the news-papers. This is certainly a practice that must not be permitted. If one foreign minister is permitted to publish what he pleases to the people, in the name of his government, every other foreign minister must be indulged with the same right. What then will be our situation on the election of a president and vice president, when the government is insulted, the persons who administer it, traduced, and the electors menaced by public addresses from these intriguing agents? Poland, that was once a respectable, and powerful nation, but is now a nation no longer, is a melancholy example of the danger of foreign influence in the election of a chief magistrate. Eleven millions of people have lost their independence from that cause alone. What would have been the conduct of the French directory, if the American minister had published an elaborate, and inflammatory address to the people of France against the government, reprobating the conduct of those in power, and extolling that of the party opposed to them? They would have done as the Parliament of England did in 1727, when the Emperor’s resident presented an insolent memorial to the king, and published it next day in the newspapers. “All parties concurred in expressing the highest indignation and resentment at the affront offered to the government by the memorial delivered by Monsieur Palm, and more particularly at this audacious manner of appealing from the government, to the people under the pretext of applying for reparation and redress of supposed injuries.” In consequence of an address from both houses, Monsieur Palm was ordered to quit England immediately. And is it not necessary that we should adopt some remedy adequate to this evil, to avoid these serious consequences which may otherwise be apprehended from it?  
The conduct of the American government to preserve its neutrality, has been repeatedly justified by arguments drawn from the law of nations; and in the application of its principles, they have gone as far, in every instance, and in one particular instance, farther in favor of France, than the strict rule of neutrality would justify. It would therefore answer no valuable purpose, to state the same principles, and deduce the same consequences, in order to justify ourselves on the same ground, that we have already done; but as the reproaches of the French republic are founded on an idea, that our construction, and application of the law of nations, is erroneous, partial, and inimical; it may be worth while to examine, whether we cannot justify ourselves by the example of the French nation itself. I presume a better rule of justification against any charge, cannot be required, than the conduct of those who have made it, in like cases.  
I propose therefore, to compare the decisions of the American government, in the several points wherein they have been complained of in Mr. Adet’s memorial, with the laws of France on the same points.  
It is asserted that the American government has violated the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, by arresting French privateers, and their prizes; and that it has exercised shocking persecutions towards them.  
It will be found on an accurate inquiry, that all the prizes brought in under French commissions, that have been restored, have been found to be in one, or the other, of the following descriptions:  
1. Those captured within a marine league of the shores of the United States.  
2. Where the capturing vessel was owned, and principally manned, by American citizens.  
3. Where the capturing vessel was armed in our ports.  
As to the jurisdiction exercised by the U. States, over the sea contiguous to its shores, all nations claim and exercise such a jurisdiction, and all writers admit this claim to be well founded; and they have differed in opinion, only as to the distance to which it may extend. Let us see whether France has claimed a greater, or less extent of dominion over the sea, than the United States. Valen, the king’s advocate at Rochelle, in his new commentary on the marine laws of France, published first in 1761, and again by approbation in 1776,  
  
Book 5. Title 1.  
  
after mentioning the opinions of many different writers on public law on this subject, says “As far as the distance of two leagues the sea is the dominion of the sovereign of the neighboring coast; and that, whether there be soundings there or not.” It “is proper to observe this method, in favor of states whose coasts are so high, that there are no soundings close to shore; but this does not prevent the extension of the dominion of the sea, as well as in respect to jurisdiction as the fisheries to a greater distance, by particular treaties, or the rule herein before mentioned, which extends dominion as far as there are soundings, or as far as the reach of a cannon shot; which is the rule at present universally acknowledged.” The effect of this dominion, the same author says, “According to the principles of Puffendorf, which are incontestible, is, that every sovereign has a right to protect foreign commerce in his dominions, as well as to secure them from insult, by preventing others from approaching nearer to a certain distance.” In extending our dominion over the sea to one league, we have not extended it so far, as the example of France, and the other powers of Europe would have justified. They therefore can have no right to complain of our conduct in this respect.  
The second description of cases, which has induced the American government to restore prizes claimed by the French, is, where our citizens have made the capture under a French commission.  
The third article of the ordinances of the marine of France, which the commission now given to French privateers require to be observed, (Valin, 2 Vol. 235) is as follows: “We prohibit all our subjects from taking commission from foreign kings, princes, or states, to arm vessels for war, and to cruize at sea under their colors, unless by our permission, on pain of being treated as pirates.” The commentator says these general and indefinite prohibitions have no exception. They extend to commissions taken from friends or allies, as well as neutrals, and those that are equivocal: and they were considered as necessary consequences of the laws of neutrality.  
“If, says Valin, the commission of the foreign prince be to cruize against his enemies who are our allies, or those with whom we intend to preserve neutrality, it would afford just ground of complaint on their part, and might lead to a rupture.” The rule extends as well to subjects domiciliated as not domiliciated in the kingdom, and foreign countries; “for Frenchmen are not the less Frenchmen, for having gone to live in foreign countries.” If France may rightfully prohibit her citizins from accepting foreign commissions to make prize of the property of her friends, why should the United States be reproached for exercising a similar right? A necessary consequence of this wise and just prohibition is, that all prizes taken contrary to it should be restored with damages to the party injured.  
The third description of prizes restored, is where they have been fitted, and armed in the ports of the United States.  
I find no direct, positive provision by the marine laws of France, prohibiting this; but the whole tenor of those laws suppose that vessels of war, are armed in the ports of the sovereign who give the commission. French privateers must not only fit out in a French port, but are bound to bring all prizes made by them into some particular port, or ports expressed in their commissions. Valin. 2 Vol. 276. And it is certain that the king of France, previous to his alliance with the United States, delivered up some American prizes, to the English, because the capturing vessel had been armed in a French port.  
  
Mr. Adet’s memorial charges that the English have been permitted to arm their vessels, and bring their prizes into our ports.  
As to this charge, the fact is simply denied. In the cases mentioned, the vessels said to have taken in guns for their defence, were gone, before he made his representation: yet he complained, and the government did nothing. I ask what could they have done? Mr. Adet will answer, they might have declared war, against Great Britain: and it is certain, this was the only remedy that remained, in such a case: but neither our interest, nor our duty would have permitted us to have adopted it. Our interest did not permit us to give up our neutrality, and engage in a foreign war, the event of which would have produced many and certain evils, and could not by any possibility have produced any good; and it was contrary to every principle by which a just nation would desire to act, to have made war on a whole people, because one or two of them had clandestinely taken arms on board for their defence, in one of our ports, without the knowledge of their government, or of ours.  
The memorial complains that we have infringed the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, by restraining the prohibition therein contained only to the ships of war, and privateers of their enemies, who should come into our ports, with their prizes.  
The literal sense of the 17th article, is, that no armed ship who shall have made prizes from the French people, shall receive an asylum in our ports. The 22d article says that no privateer, fitted under a commission of the enemy of either, shall have asylum in the ports of the other. Neither of these articles say any thing of prizes. The literal application of them therefore would exclude the capturing vessels, but give admission to their prizes; which would never have been the intention of the parties. The law of nations, expressly adopted by France, relative to the right of asylum, may illustrate these articles of the treaty. Ord. Louis XIV. art. XIV. declares, “That no prizes made by Captains under a foreign commission, shall remain in our ports, longer than twenty-four hours, unless detained by bad weather, or unless the prize shall have been made from our enemies.” But this article, says Valin, is only applicable to prizes carried into a neutral port, “and not at all to armed vessels, whether neutrals or allies, who have taken refuge there, without prizes, either to escape the pursuit of enemies, or for any other cause. They may, in this case remain as long as they please.” By the law of neutrality, simply, French prizes could only have remained twenty-four hours in our ports, but by the treaty they have obtained the priviledge of remaining as long as they please. This privilege has not only been allowed them in its fullest extent, but we had gone a step further, and as a favor permitted them to sell their prizes, which neither the treaty nor the law of nations required; and which was of more importance than all the rest put together. This favor, as favors generally are, is now claimed as a right, and the withholding is considered as an injury. Let us see what the ordinances of the French marine have said on this point. Ord. Louis XIV Tit prises. Art. XV. “If in the prizes brought into our ports by vessels armed under a foreign commission, there be any merchandizes belonging to our subjects, or allies, those belonging to our subjects shall be restored, and the rest shall not be put into any store house, or be purchased by any person under any pretext whatsoever.” “And all this, says Valin, is founded on the law of neutrality.” By the treaty of Utrecht, Louis XIV, and his grandson, the king of Spain, agreed mutually, to permit the prizes made by one to be brought in and sold in the ports of the other. But this the same author says, was only a particular arrangement, so much the less to be proposed for a general rule, as the two nations had given up the duties on prize goods sold in their dominions; which however did not last long, on account of the abuses to which it gave rise. Abuses similar, I presume, to those to which the same permission gave rise in this country.  
The next ground of complaint is the British treaty and its consequences. This treaty is said to deprive France of all the advantages stipulated in a preceding treaty; and this is done by an abandonment of the modern law of nations.  
If we may credit the declaration of the king of France, there were no exclusive advantages stipulated for France, in that treaty. His ambassador delivered a paper to the British court, dated the 13th of March 1778, wherein after announcing the treaty between France and the United States, he says, “His majesty declares at the same time, that the contracting parties have paid great attention not to stipulate any exclusive advantages in favor of the French nation: and that the United States have reserved the liberty of treating with every other nation whatever, upon the same footing of equality and reciprocity.”  
The injury supposed to have resulted from an abandonment of the modern public law, assumes two propositions, neither of which is true: 1st. That neutral ships make neutral property: 2d. That materials for building ships, are not among the articles considered as contraband of war. By the marine laws of France, Reg. Dec. 1744, Art. 5, it is directed that “If there are found on board of neutral vessels, of whatever nation they may be, merchandizes or effects, belonging to the enemies of his majesty, they shall be good prize, even tho they are not of the growth or manufacture of the enemy’s country; but the vessels shall be released.” Previous to this regulation, and contrary to the law of nations, as Valin acknowledges, if either the ship or the cargo, or any part of it, was enemy’s property, the whole was confiscated, by the laws of France. And at this day, neutral property on board of enemy’s ships, are, by the same laws, liable to confiscation.  
As to contraband of war, timber is enumerated among the articles that are so, by Vattel Lib. III, chap. VII, but Valin is much more particular, 2 Vol. 264. “In the treaty of commerce concluded with the king of Denmark, the 23d of August, 1742, pitch and tar were declared contraband; as also rosin, sail-cloth, hemp, cordage, masts and timber, for the building of ships. There would have been, therefore, no reason to complain of the conduct of the English, if they had not violated particular treaties; for of right (de droit) these things are contraband at present, and have been so, since the beginning of this century, which was not the case formerly.” By the modern law of nations, expressly adopted by France, enemies property on board neutral ships is good prize; and by the same law, the number of contraband articles has been increased so as to include the materials for ship building. All the situations were probably foreseen, in which the treaty might operate favorably or unfavorably for France, at the time it was made. It might have been stipulated that materials for ship-building should be deemed contraband, instead of declaring that they should not; or, that the United States should not enter into any treaty in which they should be made so. Neither of these being the case, there is no ground of complaint, except that the consequence is inconvenient, at present, to France, and the belligerent powers allied to her. If timber and naval stores are contraband by the law of nations, to declare them to be so by a treaty, cannot be considered as a privilege granted to one nation, or as injury to any other. The French nation will not persist in asserting, that because the exercise of rights which she has claimed as legitimate on similar occasions, becomes inconvenient when exercised by others, she may therefore refuse to acknowledge and respect them. This would be the language of an haughty despot, in a conquered country, not of justice, honor and good faith from one friend to another.  
It is said that the 18th article of the treaty with Great-Britain, suspends all the commercial relations between the United States and France, by preventing the supplies looked for by France from this country.  
This article has not introduced any new case, in which provisions may be contraband; It only alters the consequence resulting from a seizure of them, when they are so. Valin (2 vol. 264) says, “By our law, and the law of nations, provisions are not prohibited, except to places besieged or blockaded.” The article complained of, says explicitly, that when provisions and other articles not generally contraband, are become so, according to the existing law of nations, and shall, for that reason, be seized, they shall not be confiscated, but the owners shall be completely indemnified, and receive besides a reasonable mercantile profit. This principle operated as an encouragement for American vessels to seek the French markets, by insuring them against loss, if they happened in any instance to be interrupted in the voyage—France, I presume, might consider our vessels bound with provisions to a place besieged or blockaded, liable to seizure, after due notice of the fact; if, instead of this, they contend for the privilege of paying for them according to the terms of the treaty with Great-Britain, I suppose it will not be denied to them. But, if under pretence that a vessel is bound to a besieged or blockaded port, when she is not, either France or Great Britain should seize or detain her, it is an injury not authorized by the treaty, or the law of nations. This is what both nations have done, when their interest or necessities required it—sometimes with, and often without any apology—and what they will often continue to do, I fear, as long as they know we cannot punish them for it.  
These injuries are said to have been received while every object around reminds us of the tyranny of Britain and the generous Assistance of France, during the American war.  
The generosity of France and the ingratitude of the United States have been often suggested by some of our own Citizens, and we are now reproached with it by France herself. Gratitude is due for favors received; and this virtue may exist among nations as well as among individuals: but the motive of the benefit must be solely the advantage of the party on whom it was conferred, else it ceases to be a favor. There is positive proof that France did not enter into the alliance with us in 1778 for our advantage; but for her own. The whole course of the negociation, as well as a positive knowledge of the fact, proves this. She resisted all our solicitations for effectual assistance for near three years; and rose in her demands during the campaign of 1777, when our affairs presented the most threatening aspect. Memorials were presented in August and September of that year, while General Burgoyne was advancing from Canada, in a stile of importunity, proportioned to the danger we were in from a junction of the two armies; and they were received with increased coldness from the same cause. But when the knowledge of the capture of Burgoyne’s army arrived in December; fearing we might be able to do the business without them, the French Court began to change its tone. In January the British minister gave notice in the House of Commons, that he meant to propose terms of accomodation with America. The French ministry, on the arrival of this intelligence in France, immediately pressed the conclusion of the treaty which they had resisted for three years, and proposed terms much more favorable for us, than those our Commissioners had offered, and they had refused three months before. The treaty was signed on the 8th February. I perceive no generosity in all this. They did then, as we have done now, and as every discerning nation will do, they regarded only their own interest and advantage, and not that of any other nation. In the interval between the declaration of independence and the alliance, with France, that Court sometimes ordered away our privateers, and sometimes restored their prizes: They refused to receive an ambassador, or acknowledge our independence: All of which was for fear of bringing France prematurely into the war. The fact is, that the French spoke of very different terms, as the condition of their assistance, before the Capture of Burgoyne, from those actually agreed on afterwards. There can be no doubt, that our success on that occasion, and the disposition it appeared to have produced in the British ministry, were the immediate causes of that alliance. It was certainly the interest of the French to unite with America in the war against Great Britain. They therefore acted right in doing this at last, tho with too much refinement in putting it off so long; but it is not the interest of the United States to be engaged in any war whatsoever—much less do they desire to imbrue their hands in the blood of one nation, to gratify the hatred, or serve the interest of another. We have acted right hitherto, in laying it down as a principle, not to suffer ourselves to be drawn into the wars of Europe, and if we must have a war, I hope it will be for refusing to depart from this principle.  
Our government has acted with firmness, consistency, and moderation, in repelling the unjust pretensions of the belligerent powers, as far as reason and argument could have weight. If it has not attempted, in every instance, to preserve our rights by force, wherein the remedy would have been worse than the disease, they have not yielded them by concession, in any instance. Into whosoever hands the administration of the government may now come, they are called on by the suggestions of a wise policy, and the voice of their country to pursue the same general line of conduct, that has been hitherto pursued, without yielding to the violence of party on either side.  
They will then be sure of the approbation and support of the most virtuous, which it is hoped are the most numerous part, of all parties. On the contrary, if, departing from these principles, they unnecessarily involve their country in the horrors of war, they will meet the merited execration of good men, and in the end, the punishment justly due to such conduct, from an injured people.

Movember 29. eodtf  
  
From the (New-Tork) Minerva.  
The Answer.  
THE French republic have, at various times  
during the present war, complained of certain prin­  
ciple! and decifiotw of the American government,  
as being relations of its neutrality, or infaflions  
of the treaty made with France in the year 1778.  
These complaints were ptincip.&#x27;ly made in the  
year 1793, ant&#x27; explanations, which, till now, were  
deemed fatisfaflory, were made by Mr. Jefferfon&#x27;s  
correspondence, in Aaguil of that year. They  
are now not only renewed with great exaggeration,  
but the French government have diretled, that it  
(hould be done in the tone of reproach, injlead of the  
language of friendjbip The apparent intention of  
this menacing tone at this particular time, is, to in  
Silence timid minds to vote agreeably to their wifties  
in the election of President ar.d Vice-Picfident, and  
probably with this view, the memorial was publish­  
ed in«the newspapers. This is certainly a praQice  
that mull not f&gt;e permitted. If one foreign minister  
is permitted to publish what he pleases to the peo­  
pie, in the name of his government, every other  
foreign minister mud be endowed with the fame  
right. What then will be our fltuation on the e­  
le£lio» of a President and Vice President, when the  
government is insulted, the persons who administer  
it traduced, and tbeele&amp;ors menaced by public ad­  
drelTej from these intriguing agents ? Pnjand, that  
was onae a refpeftable and powerful nation, but is  
now a nation no longer, is a melancholy example  
of the danger of foreign influence-in the cletflion of  
3 chief magistrate. Eleven millions of people have  
101 l their independence from that &lt; iufe alone.  
What would hive been the conduct of the Frcach  
Directory, if the American Minister had publilwd an  
elaborate, and inflammatory address to to the people of  
France aj»ainft the government, reprobating the con­  
duit of those in power, and extolling that of the party  
opposed to them they would have done as the Par­  
liament of England did in 1717, when the Emperor&#x27;s  
resident presented an insolent memorial to the km;, and  
publilhed it next day in the newspapers. &quot;All parties  
concurred in exprefling the highest indignation and re­  
fentme*t at the affront offered to the government by  
the memorial deliveied hy Monsieur Palm, and more  
particularly at this audacious manner of appealing  
from the government to the people under the pretext  
of applying for reparation and redress of supposed inju­  
ries/&#x27; In consequence of an address from both hosfes  
Monsieur Palm was ordered to quit England immedi­  
ately. And is it not ntcefiary that we should adopt  
some remedy adequate to this evil, to avoid these seri­  
ous confequenccs which may otherwifc be apprehended  
from it ?  
The condnfl of tlje American government to  
preserve its neutrality, has been repeatedly juflified  
by arguments drawn from thelawsof nations; and  
in the application of its piinciplet, they have gone  
as fir, in every instance, and in one particular in­  
stance, farther, in favour of France, than the (tiitt  
rule of neutrality would juftify. It would, there­  
fore, aitfwer no valuable purpose, to (late the fame  
principles, and deduce the fame confequencfi, in or­  
der to juftify ouifelveson the fame ground that we  
have already done 1 but as the reproaches of tjie  
French republic are founded on an idea, that our  
donflrufh&#x27;on and application of the law of nations,  
is erroueous, partial and inimical; it maybe worth  
while to examine, whether we cannot juftify our­  
selves by the example of the French nation itfelf.  
I presume a better rule of jutlificatiori againfl any  
c&#x27;larget cannot be required, than the conduct of  
those who have made it,, in like cases-  
I propose, therefore, to compare the deeifions of  
the American government, in the several poiats  
wherein they have been complained of in Mr. A­  
det&#x27;s memorial, with the laws of France oa the  
fame points.  
It is sflertedf that the American government has  
violated the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, by  
arreting French privateers and their prizes ; and  
that it has exercised Jhoclting perfections towards  
them.  
It will be founi, on an accurate enquiry, that all  
the prizes brought in under French commissions,  
that have been reflored, have been found to be in  
one or the other of the following delcriptions :  
1. Those captured within a marine league of the  
fhorcs of the United States.  
2. Where the capturing vtffcl was owned, and  
also principally manned, by American citizens.  
3. Where the rtpturing vefiel was armed in our  
ports.  
As to the jurifdidlion exercised by the United  
States over the sea contiguous to its shores, all na­  
tions claim and exercise such a juris liSion, and all  
writers admit this claim to be well founded ; and  
they have differed in opinion only as to the «iftance  
to which it may extend. Let us fee whether Irapce  
has claimed a greater or lef» extent of dominion  
over the sea; than the United States. Valin, the  
king&#x27;s advocate at Rochelle, in his new commenta­  
ry o* the maiine laws of France, publifhcd firft in  
1761, and a&lt;;ain by approbation in 1776,* after  
mentioning the opinions of many different writers  
on public law on this fubjeft, fays, &quot; As far as the  
distance of two leagues, the sea is the dominion of  
the f«vercign,of the neighbouring coafl ; and that,  
whether thcte be foundings there or not. It  
&quot; is proper to observe this method, in favour of  
Rates whose coasts ate fe high, that there are no  
foundings close to the fttore; but this does not pre­  
vent the exteufion of the dominion of the sea, jas  
wc/lin rejpeft. to jurifdiflion as thejifheric&#x27;s to a greater  
diltatice, by particular treaties, or the rule herein  
before mentioned, which extends dominion as far  
as there are foundings, or as far as the reach of a  
cannon shot—which is the rule at present univcrfally  
acknowledged.&quot; The effect of this dominion, the  
fame author fays, &quot; according to the principles of  
Puffendorff, which ate incontellible, is, that every  
sovereign has a right to proteA foreign commerce,  
in his dominions, as well as to fecpre them from in­  
sult, by preventing others from approaching nearer  
than »o a certain distance.&quot; In extending our do­  
minion over the sea to one league, we have not ex­  
tended it fofar, as the example of France, and the  
other powers of Europe, would have juftified—  
They therefore can have no right to complain as  
our conducl in this refpe£k.  
* Cook 3. title 1.  
  
The feeond defciipiion of cases, which hai in­  
. duced the American government to rellore prizes  
claimed by the French, i», where our citizens have  
■ made a capture under a French commiflion.  
The thiru article of the ordinances of the ma­  
rine of France, which the commissions now given to  
French privateeers require to be observed, [Valin,  
z vol. 235.] « as follows :  
&quot; We prohibit all our fubj&#x27;fts from taking com­  
miG&gt;jns from foreign kings, princes, or dates, to  
arm irefiels fjr war, and to cruize at lea under their  
colours, unlcfs by our permifllon, on pain of being  
treated as pirates.&#x27;! The commentator fays, these  
general and indefinite prohibitions have no excep­  
tion. Tliey extend to commissions taken from  
friends or aHies, as well as neutrals, and those that  
are equivocal: and they were confrdered as ne~cf­  
faiy consequences of the laws of neutrality.  
&quot; If, fays Valin, the commiflion of the foreign  
Prince be to cruize agsinft hit enemies &lt;Si\o are our  
alliet, or those with whom we intend It pre feme neu­  
trality, it would afford jutt ground of complaint 011  
their pari, and might lead to a rupture.&quot; The rale  
extends ns well to fubjefts domiciliated as net domi­  
ciliated in the kingdom, and foreign countries ;  
&quot; for Frenchmen arc not the lefj Frenchmen, for  
having gone to live in foreign countries.&quot; If Fiance  
may rightfully prohibit her citizens from accepting  
foreign commiflions to make prize of the property  
of her friends, why should the United States be  
reproached for exereifing a similar rjrht \ A necrf  
fary consequence of this wife and jutt prohibition is,  
that all prizes taken contrary to it should be resto­  
red with damages to the party injured.  
The third description of prizes restored is where  
they have been fitted, and armed in the ports of  
the United States.  
I find no direst, positive provision by the ma ine  
laws of France, prohibiting this ; but the whole  
tenor r.{ those laws supposed that vessels of war,  
are atmed in the ports of the sovereign who give  
the cßmmifiion. French privateers molt not only  
fit out in a French port, but are bound to bring all  
prizes made by them into Tome particular port, or  
ports expressed in their commifiions, Valin. 2 vol.  
,276. And it is certain that the king ef France,  
previous to his alliance with the United States, d#-  
livered up some American prizes, to the Englilh,  
because the capturing vessel had been armed in a  
French port.  
Mr. Adet&#x27;s memorial charges that the English  
have been permitted to arm their veflels, and bring  
their prizes into our ports.  
As to this charge, the fa£t is simply denied. In  
the cafcs mentioned, the veflels laid to have taken  
in guns for their defence, were gone, before he  
made his reprefen;ation : yet he complained, and  
the government did nothing. I ask what could  
they have done ? Mr. Adet will answer, they might  
have declared war, against Great- Britain ; and it  
is certain, this was the only remedy that remained,  
in such a cafe : but neither our interest, nor our  
duty would have permitted us to have adopted it.  
Our interest did not permit us to gWe up our neu­  
trality, and engage in a foreign war ; the ovent of  
which would have produced many and certain evils,  
and could not by any poflibility have produced any  
good ;—and it was contary to every principle by  
which a just nation would desire to aft, to have  
made war on a whole people, because one or two of  
them had clandestinely taken arms on board for  
their defence, in one of oar ports, without the  
knowledge of their government, or of ours.  
The memorial complains that we have infringed  
the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, by retrain­  
ing the prohibition therein contained only to the  
(hips of war, and privateers of their enemies, who  
should pome into our ports, with their prizes.  
The literal sense of the 17th article, is, that no  
armed (hip who shall have made prizes from the  
French people, shall receive an asylum in our ports.  
The 22d article fays that no privateer, fitted under  
a commiflion of the enemy of either, shall have a­  
sylum in the ports of the other.—Neither of these  
articles fay any thing of prizes. The literal appli­  
catio»of them therefore would exclude the captur­  
ing velTelt, but give admifiion to their prizes ;  
which could never have been the intention of the  
parties. The law of nations, exptefsly adopted by  
France, relative to the right of asylum, may ilhif­  
trate these articles of the treaty. Old. Louis XIV.  
Art. XIV. declares, &quot; that no prizes made by  
captains under a foreign commiflion, (hall remain in  
our poits, longer than twenty-four hours, unless  
detained by bad weather, or unless the prize shall  
have been made from our enemies.&quot; But this arti  
cle, fays Valin, is only applicable to prizes carried  
into a neutral port, &quot; and not at all to armed ves­  
sels, whether neutials or allies, who have taken re.  
tuge there, without prince, either to escape the p\ir­  
fuit of enemies, or for any other cause.&#x27; They  
may, in this cafe remain as long as they pl.-afe.&quot;  
By the law of neutrality, simply, French j;iizes  
could only have remained twenty-fosr hours in-uur  
ports, but by the treaty they have obtained the  
privilege of remainfhg as long as they please This1  
privilege iuu not ouly been allowed them in its ful­  
led extent, T&gt;ut we had geue a ltc|» further, and as  
a favor permitted them to fell their prizes, which  
neither the treaty nor the law of nations required :  
and \yhi«h was of more i&#x27;mportancc than all the reft  
put together. This favor, as favors generally are,  
is now claimed as a right&quot;, anß the withholding it is  
coolidered as an injury Let us fee what the&#x27;or­  
dinances of the French marine have said on this  
point. Ord. Louis XIV. Tit. prises. Art. XV.  
&quot; If in the prizes brought iato our ports by vessels  
| armed tinder a foreign commifii«n, there be any  
merchandizes belonging to our ftihjet&#x27;ti, or allies,  
those belonging to oqr fubjetls (hall OS restored, and  
the rtjl shall not he put into bouse, or be pur  
chafed by any perjon under any pretext -what/oever  
And all this, feys Valin, is founded on the law  
®f neutrality.&quot; By the Utrecht, Louis  
XIV. and his grandson, the king sf Spain, agreed  
mutually, to pc»mit the prizes mad? by one.to be  
brought in, ami fold in (he ports of the other. But  
this the fame author fays, wasonly a particular ar­  
rangement, so much ths. Ids to be prnpofedjfor a  
general rule, as the two nations iiad gii-en up th£&quot;  
duties on prize goods fold ui% their dominions ;  
which however did not laftlonj- en account of the  
abuses to which it gave rife. Abufei fimiiar, I  
  
p-emmc, to these to which the pevmiffion  
gave rife in ttjis country.  
The next ground of complaint is the Britilh  
treaty and Its consequences. This treaty is said  
to deprive France of all the advantages Itipulated  
in t preceding :reaty ; and this is done by an aban­  
donment ef the modem, law of nations.  
If we may credit the declaration of the king of  
-France, there were no exciufive advantages (tipu­  
lated for France, in that treaty. Hl3 ambi(T»&lt;!or  
| delivered a paper to the British court, dated the  
! 13th of March 1778, whetein, after announcing  
j the treaty between France and the United States,  
lie fays, &quot; His rmjelly declares ait the fame time,  
thajthc contra&amp;ing parties have paid great atten­  
tion noI to flipulate any exelufive advantages in favor  
of the French natien •• anil that the United States  
have reftrved the liberty of treating with every other  
nation whatever, upon the fame footing of t quality  
and reciprocity.&quot;  
The injury supposed to have resulted from an a­  
bandonment ofthe modern public law, assumes  
two propositions, neither of which is true : ilf.  
That neutral (hips make neutral property: ad.i  
That materials for building (hips, ?rc riot among  
the articles as considered contraband of war. By  
the marine laws of France, fieg. Dec. 1744. 4rt..  
I J, it is directed that &quot; If tljere are found on board  
of neutral velfels, of whatever nation they may be,  
merchandizes or effects, bplianging to the enemies­  
of his majesty, they (hall Wgood prize, even tho&#x27;  
they are not of the growth or manufacture of the  
enemy&#x27;s country; but the veflcls (hall be relcafed.&quot;  
Previous to this j-egulation, and contrary to the  
law of nations, as Valin acknowledges, if &quot;either  
the (hip or the cargo, or any #,irt of it, was ene­  
my&#x27;s property, the whole wjp confifcated, by the  
laws of France. And at this day, neutral pro­  
perty on &quot;ooacd of enemy&#x27;s rti&#x27;/ps are, by the fame  
laws, liable to confafcation.  
As toftontrahand of war, timber is enumerated  
among the articles that are so, by Vattel, lib. 111,  
chap. VII. but Valin is much more particular, 2  
vol. 264. &quot;In the treaty of commerce conclud.  
Ed with tlje kirig of Denmark, the 23d of Augnft,.  
1742, pitch rand tar were declined contraband 1  
as also rosin, fail cloth, hemp, cordage, mafls and*  
timber, for the building of flips- There would have  
-Been, therefore, no reason to complain of the con­  
duct of the EngliGi, if they had not violated par­  
ticular treaties ; for of right (de droit) these t/.ingr  
are contraband at present, and have been so Jince tin  
beginning cf this century, which was not the cafe  
formerly.&quot;  
By th« modern law of nations, e.xprefsly adopted  
by France, enemies property on boar«i neutral (hips  
is good priae ; and by the fame law, the number  
of contraband articles has been increased so as to  
include th» materials for (hip building. All the  
fituaiions were probably forefeen, in which the  
treaty might operßte favorably or unfavorably for  
France, at the time it was made. It might have  
been ftipulatcd that materials for (hip building  
(hould be deemed contraband, inflead of declaring  
they (hould not ; or, that the United States (hould  
not enter into any treaty in which they (hould be  
made so. Neither of these being the cafe, there  
is no ground of compla.&#x27;nt, except that the confe­  
rence is inconvenient, at present, to France, and  
the belligerent power* allied to her. If timber and  
naval stores are contraband by the law (if nations,  
to &quot;declare them to be so by a treaty, cannot be  
coufidered as a privilege granted to one nation, or  
an injury to any other

Thk ANSWER.  
[■Concluded fr«m yeflerday&#x27;s Gazette.]  
The French nation will not persist in asserting.  
that becatffe the exercise of rights which (he has  
claimed as legitimate on former occasions, become!  
inconvenient when exercifcd by others, she may  
therefore refufe to acknowledge and refpeft them.  
This would be the language of an haughty despot,  
in a conquered country, not of justice, honor, and :  
good faith from one friend to another.  
It is said that the 18th article of the treaty with  
Great-Britain, suspends all the commercial rela­  
tions between the United States and France, by  
preventing the fapplics looked for by France from  
this country.  
This article has not introduced any new cafe, in  
which provisions may be contraband : It only alters  
the eonfequence resulting from a seizure of them, i  
when they are so. Valin (i vo], 264) fays, &quot;By  
our law, and the law of nation*, provifians are not  
prohibited, except to plates befnged or blockaded.&quot; j  
The article eomplaincd of, fays explicitly, that |  
whep provisions and other articles not generality con- t  
traland are become so, according to the exijiing law ,

the privilege of paying for them according &#x27;to the c  
terms of the treaty with Great-Britain, 1 suppose h

will often continue to do, [fear, as long as they 0

it The generosity -of France and the ingratitude of tl  
n the United States have been often suggested by r  
some of our own citisens, and we are now fte- tl  
lC prcached with it by France herfelf. Gratitude is 0  
r_ due for favors received ; and this virtue may exist h  
s_ among nations as well as among individuals: but w  
lt the tnjtive of the benefit mud be solely the advan- so  
n fa£e &quot;f party 0« whom it was conferred, else a!  
it ceases to be a favor. There is positive proof that rj  
I&#x27; ranee did sot enter into the alliance with us in yv  
f*r our edmantage; but for her mvn. The S  
whoiccourfe of the neg&#x27;ociation, as well as a poll- h  
tivc knowledge of the, fact, proves this. She re. Ci

at Phiiadelphia.  
7§ HE French Republic have, at  
r various times, during the pre­  
sent war, complained of certain prin­  
ciples, and decisions of the American  
government,as being violations of its  
neutrality, or infraltions of the treaty  
made with France in the year 1778,  
These complaints were principally  
made in the year 1793, and explana­  
tions, which, till now, were deemed  
{atisfaltory, were made by Mr. Jef­  
ferfon’s correfpondence,in Auguit of  
that year. They are now wot only  
renewed with great exaggeration,  
but the French government have di­  
rected that it should be dode iz zbe  
tone of reproach, inflead of the language  
of friend/bip. The apparent inten­  
tion of this menacing tone, at&#x27; this  
particular time, is to influence timid  
minds to vote agreeable to their with­  
es in the ele®ion of president and  
vice-president, and probably with this  
view, the memorial was pablifhed in  
the news.papers. This is certainly  
a prallice that souft not be permitted.  
If one fareign minister is permitted  
to publish what he pleases to the peo­  
ple, in the name of his government,  
every other foreign minister must be  
induiged with the fame right. What  
then will be our situation on the elec­  
tion of 2 president and vice-president,  
when the governmeat is infolted, the  
persons who administer it, traduced,  
&amp; the eleftors menaced by public ad­  
drefles from these intriguing agents ?  
Puland, that was once a refpeQa­  
ble and powerful nation, but is now a  
nation no longer, is a melaocholy ex­  
ample of the danger of foreign in­  
fluence in the election of a chief ma:  
giftrate. Eleven millions of people  
fiave loft their independence from  
thar cause alone. What would have  
been the condué&amp; of the French Di­  
rectory, if the American minister had  
publiffied an elaborate, 2nd inflam­  
-matory addre(s to the people of France  
against the government, reprobating  
the condu of those in power, and  
extoiling that of the party opposed  
to them ? They would have dane as  
the Parliament of England did in  
1727, when the Ewmperor’s resident  
presented an insolent memorial to the  
king, and published it next day in the  
news-papers. “¢ All parties concur­  
red in exprefling the highest indigna­  
tion and&#x27; resentment ar the affront  
offered’ to the government by the  
n:emorial delivered by Monsieur  
Palm, and more particular at this  
-audacious manner of appealing from  
the government, to the people under  
“the pretext of applying for repara­  
tion and redress of supposed injuries.”  
In consequence of an addrels from  
both houlfes, Monsieur Palm was or­  
dered to quit England immediately.  
And is it not neceflary that we should  
adopt fom;,,remedy adequate to this  
evil, to avoid these serious conse­  
quences which may otherwise be ap­  
prehended from it. 2  
~ The condué of the American go­  
vernment to preserve its ngutrality,  
has been repeatedly juftified by &lt;rgu­  
meats drawn from the law of na­  
tions.; and in the application of its  
principles, they have gone as far, in  
every instance, and in one particular  
instance, farther in favor o? France,  
than the ftri@t rule of neatrality would  
juftify. It would therefore answer  
no valuable purpose, to state the fame  
priticiples, and dedoce the fame con­  
sequences, in order to juftify our­  
selves on the fame ground, that we  
‘have already done: but as the re­  
2roaches of the French Republic are  
founded on an idea, that our con­  
{tru&amp;ion, and application of the law  
of nations, is erroneous, partial, and  
inimical ; it may be worth while to  
examine, whether we cannot juftify  
ourselves by the example of the  
French nation itfelf. I presume a  
better rule of juftification against any  
charge, cannot be required, than the  
- conda&amp; of those who have made it,  
in like cases. v ;  
T propose therefore, to compare  
the decisions of the American go­  
vernment, in the several points where­  
in they been have complained of in  
‘Mr. Adet’samemorial, with the laws  
~of France on the fame points. =  
It is asserted that the American  
  
Bampshite Gasette.  
  
government has violated the 17th ar­  
ticle of the treaty of 1778, by arrest­  
ing French privateers, and their pri­  
zes 3 and that it has ekercifed shock­  
ing perfecutioks towards them.  
It will be found on an accarate in­  
quiry, that all the prizes brought in -  
under French commissions, that have  
been restored, have been found to be  
in one, or the other, of the following  
descriptions : . :  
1. Those captured withiv a marine  
league of the shores of the Waited  
States. . ‘  
z. Where the capturing veflel was  
owned, and pringipally manued, by  
American citizens. ‘  
3. Where the capturing veflel was  
armed in our ports. _  
As to the jurifdition exercised by  
the Undted States, over the sea coa­  
tiguous toits shores, all nations claim  
and exercise such a jurifdi®ion, and  
all writers admit this claim to be well  
founded ; and they have differed in  
opinion, ouly as to the distance to  
which it ‘may extend. Let us fee  
whether France has claimed a great­  
er, or less extent of dominion over  
the sea, than the Uaited Stazes.  
Valen, the king’s advocare at Ro­  
chelle, in his new commentary on  
the marine laws of France, publithed  
firft in 1761, and again by approba­  
tion in 1776*, after mentioning ‘the  
opinions of many different writers  
on public law on this fubje&amp;, fays  
¢ As far as the distance of two leagues  
the sea is the dominion of the sover­  
eign of the neighdoring coast ; and  
that, whether there be foundiggs  
there or not.”” It ““is proper to ob-.  
serve this method, i favor of states  
whole coasts are so high, Ihat there  
-are no soundings close to the shore 3  
but this does not prevent the exten­  
sion of the dominion of the sea, as  
avell as in refped to jurifdittion as the  
Jiyheries to a greater distance, by par­  
ticular treaties, or the ruie herein  
before mentioned, which = extends  
*dominion as far as there are sound­  
ings, or as far as the reach of a can­  
non thot ; avbich is the rule at present  
universally acknowledged.”&gt; &#x27;The eff-&amp;  
of this dominion, the fame author  
fays, ¢ According to the principles  
ot Puffendoif, which are incontefti­  
ble, is, that every sovereign has a  
right to prote&amp; foreign commerce in  
his dominions, as well as to secure  
them from insult, by preventing o­  
thers from approaching nedrer 10 a  
certain distance.” In extending our  
dominion. gver the sea to ane league,  
we bave not extended it so far, as the  
example of France, and the other  
powers of Europe would have jufti­  
fied. They therefore can have no,  
right to complain of our condu&amp; in  
this refpeft. :  
  
The second defctiption of cales,  
which has induced the American go­  
vernment to reltore prizes claimed by  
the French, is, where our citizens  
have made the captureunder a French  
commission. :  
The third article of the ordinances  
of the marine of France, which the  
commission now given to French pri­  
vateers require to he observed (Valin,  
2 Vol. 235) is as follows ; *“We pro­  
hibit ‘ali. our fubje@s from taking  
commiflions -from: foreign kings,  
princes, or states, to arm vessels for  
war, and to cruize at sea under their  
colors, unless by our permission, on  
pain of being treated as pirates.”  
‘The commentator fays these general  
and indefinate prohibitions have no  
exception. They extend to coramif­  
fions taken from friends or allies, as  
well as neutrals, and those: that are  
equivocal : and they were considered  
as necessary conlequences of the laws  
of neutrality., PR  
“« If, fays Valin, the commission  
of the foreign prince.be to cruize a­  
gaioft bis enemies who are our allies,  
or those awith whom ave. intend. to pre-  
Jerwe nentrality, it would afford just  
ground of complaiat on their part,  
and might lead to a rupture.”” The  
rule extends as well to fubje@ts do­  
miciliated as not domiciliated in the  
kingdom, and. foreign countries ;  
“* for Frenchmen are -not. the less  
Frencbmen, for having gone to_live &quot;  
in foreign countries.” -If France  
may rightfully ‘prohibit‘ her citizen

by the marine laws of France, prohi­  
biting this ; but the whole tenor of  
those laws suppose that veflels of war,  
are armed in the ports of the sover­  
eign who gave the commission.  
French privateers must not only fit  
out in a French port, but are bound  
to bring all prizes made by them  
inito some particular port, or ports  
exprefled in their com’miﬁ%ns-. &quot;Valin  
2 Vol. 276. And itis certain that  
the king of France, previous to his  
alliance with the United Btates, de­  
livered vp some Americag prizes, to  
the Englith, because the capturing  
vellcl had been armed in a French  
port. &#x27; |  
Mr. Adet’s memorial charges that  
the English have been permitied to  
arm their vefiels and bring their pri­  
ges into our ports, :  
~ As to this charge, the fa&amp;t is sim­  
ply dénied. In the cases mentioned,  
the vessels said to have taken in guns  
for their defence, were gone, before  
he made his representation :- yet he  
ccmplained and the government did  
nothing. I atk what could they have  
done ? Mr. Adet will&#x27; answer, they  
might have declared war, against  
Great Britain 3 and it is certain, this  
was the only remedy that remained,  
in such a case : but neither our in­  
tetelt, nor our duty would have per­  
mitted us to have adopted it. Our  
intereit did not permit us to give up  
our neutrality, and engage in a fo­  
reign war, the event of which would  
have produced ‘many and certain  
evils, and could not by any possibili­  
ty have «;:roduced any good ;—and  
it was contrary to every principle by  
which a just nation would desire to  
a&amp;t, to have made war on a whole  
people, bueaufe one or two of them&quot;  
had clandestinely taken arms on  
board for their defence, in one of  
our ‘ports, without the knowledge  
of their goveroment, or of ours. |  
The memorial codiplains that we  
bave infringed the 17th article of  
the treaty of 1778, by restraining  
the &#x27; prohibition ~ therein contained  
only to the thips of war, and. priva.  
teers of their enemies, who should  
come into our ports, wirh their pri­  
e,  
  
The literal sense of the 17th arti­  
cle, is that no armed thip who phall  
hawe made prizes from the French  
people, thall receive an asylum in  
our ports. The 22d article fays that  
no privateer, fitted vnder a commis­  
sion of the enemy of either; shall  
have asylum in the ports of the  
other.~—Neither as these articles fay  
any thing ot prizes. Theliteral ap­  
plication of them therefore would  
exclude the capturing veflels, but  
give admission to their prizes ; which  
would never have been the intention  
of the parties. The law of nations,  
expressly adopted by France, relative  
to the right of afylam, may illaftrate  
these articles of the treaty. Oid.  
Louis XIVi, art. XIV. declares,  
‘“That no prizes made by Captains  
under a foreign commiflion, shall re­  
fhain in oyr ports, longer than twen­  
ty-four ‘hours, unless detained by  
bad weather; or-unless the prize shall  
have been made from our enemies.”’  
But this article, -fays Valin, is only  
applicable to priges carried into a  
neutral port, **and not atall to arm­  
ed veficls, whether neutrals or allies,  
who have taken refuge there, aiztbout  
prizes, either to escape the pursuit of  
enemies, or for any other scaufe.  
They may, in this case remain as  
long as ‘they please.”” By the law  
of neutrality, simply, French prizes  
could only bave remained ,tw.ent{ .  
four hours in our ports, but by the  
treaty they have obtained the privi­  
lege of remaining’ as long as they  
please. This pgiﬁlege has_not only  
been allowed them in its ;;?tlleﬁ? exs«  
  
tent, but we had gone a step further,  
and as a favor permitted them to fell  
their prizes, which neither the treaty  
nor the law of nations required ; and  
which was of roore importance than  
all the rest put together. This favor,  
as favors.generally are, is now claim­  
ed as a right, and the withholding is  
considered as an injury.—Let us fee  
what the ordinances of the French  
marine have said on this point. Ord.  
Louis XIV. Tit. prises. Art. XV.  
““If in the prizes brought into our  
ports by veflels armed under a fo­  
reign commission, there be any mer­  
chandizes belonging to our fubjeds,  
or allies, those belonging to our fub­  
je&amp;ts thall be reltored, and the ref  
Jball not be. put into any flore boufe, or  
be purchased by any person under any  
pretext whatfoever.”® ““And all this,  
fays Valin, is foonded on the law of  
neutrality.”” By the treaty of U.  
trecht, Louis XIV. and his grandson,  
“the king of Spain, agreed mutually,  
to permit the prizes made by one to  
be brought in, and fold in the ports  
of the other. But this the fame au­  
thor fays, was only a particular ar­  
rangement, so much the less to be  
proposed for a general rule, as the  
two nations had given up the duties  
.on prize goods fold in their domi  
nions ; which however did. not last  
long, on account of the abuses to  
which it gave rife. Abuses similar,  
I presume, to those to which the  
fame permission gave rife in this  
country. i : T  
The next ground of complaint is  
the Britith treaty and its consequen­  
ces. This treaty s said to deprive  
France of all the advantages stipula­  
ted in a proceeding treaty ; and this  
is done by an abandonment of the  
modern law of nations. Wi  
If we may credit the declaration  
of the king of France, there were no  
exclusive advantages stipulated for  
France, in that treaty. His ambas­  
sador delivered a paper to the Britith  
court, dated the 13th of March 1778,  
wherein afrer annopncing the treaty  
between france and the United  
States, he fays, &lt;*His majesty declares  
at the fame time, that the contra&amp;ing  
parties have paid great attention o  
to flipulate any exclusive advantages in  
Jawor of the French mation : andthat  
vhe United States bawve reserved the lie  
burty of treating awith every other nation  
ahatever, upon the fame fooring of equa­  
lity and reciprocity.”  
The injury fuppefed to have re­  
sulted from an abandonment of the  
modern public law, assumes two pro­  
positions, neither of which is true :  
ift. That neutral ships make neu­  
tral property : 2d. That materials  
for building ships, are not arong  
the articles considered as contraband  
of war. By the marine laws of  
France, Reg. Dec. 1744, Art. §. it is  
direfted that &lt;“lf there are foind on  
board of neutral veflels, of whatever  
nation they may be, merchandizes  
ar effelts, belonging to the enemies  
of his majesty, they fthall be good  
prize, even tho’ they are not of the  
growth or manufalure of the ene­  
my’s country ; hut the veflels shall  
be reieafed. Previous to thisregula­  
tion, and oontrary to the law of na­  
tions, as Valin acknowledges, if ei­  
ther the %ﬁp or&#x27; the cargo, or any  
part of if, was enemy’s property,  
the whole was confifcated, by the  
laws of France. And at this day,  
neutral property on board of enemy’s  
ships, are by the fame laws, liable to  
confifcation. b eipiho w e ;  
  
~ As to contraband of war, timber  
is enumerated among the articles  
that are so, by Vattel Lib. 111. chap,  
VII. but Valin is ‘much more parti­  
cular, 2 Vol. 264, - ““In the treaty  
of comimerce concluddd with the  
king of Denmark, the z3d of August,  
1742, pitch and tar were declared  
contraband ; as also resin, Jfail-cloh,  
bemp, cordage, masts and timber, for the  
building of fbips. There would have  
been, therefore, no reason to com­  
plain ofi-the condu&amp; of the English,  
if they had net violated particnlar  
treaties ; for of right (de droit) shefe  
things are- contraband at present, and  
bave been so, [m&quot;e the beginning of this  
century, awkich awas not the case formey­  
ly.”” By the modern law of nations,  
expressly adopted by France, enemies

Lo/ pr. Annum.  
  
good prize ; and by the fame law,  
the number of contraband articles  
has’been increased so as to include  
the materials for ship building. Al  
the situations were probably torefeen,  
in which the treaty might operate fa.  
vorably or unfavorably for Franze, at  
the time it was made. It might have  
been stipulated that marterials fog  
ship-building should be deemed con -  
traband, instead of declaring that  
they should not ; or, that the United  
States should not enterinto any trea­  
ty in which they should be made so.  
Neither of these being the case, there  
is no ground of complaint, €xcept  
that the consequence is inconvenient, at  
prelent, to France, and the beilige~  
rentpowers. allied to jher. If tim­  
ber and naval stores are contraband  
by the law of natigns, to declire  
them to be {o by a treaty, cannot be  
considered as a privilege granted to  
one nation, or an lhjury to any u­  
ther. The French nation will not  
persist in asserting, that because tha  
exercise of rights which she has  
claitned as legitimate on similar oc.  
cafions, becoines inconvenient when  
exerciled by others, she may theres  
fore refufe to ackuowledge and re­  
fpe&amp; them. This would be the lan­  
guage of an baughty defpor, ina  
conquered country, not ot justice,  
honor and good faith from one friend  
to another.  
  
it is said that the 18th article of  
the treary with Great-Britain, fof­  
pends all the commercial relarions  
between the United States and France  
by preventing the supplies looked  
for by France from this country.  
This article has not introduced a­  
hy new cale, in which pravifions  
may be contraband ; It only alters  
the consequence resulting from a sei­  
zure” of them, when they are so.  
Valio (2 vol. 264) fays, “‘By our  
law, and the law of nations, provi­  
sions are not prohibited, excepr 10 pla­  
ces besieged or blockadea,” &#x27;The article  
complained of, fays explicitly, that  
when provisions and other articleg  
not generaliy comtraband,are become so,  
according to the e¥ifting low of nation:,  
and shall, for that reason, be seized,  
they shall not be confifcated, but the  
owners shall be completely indemni­  
fied, and receive besides a reasonable  
mercantile profit.  
This principle operated as an en-  
Couragement for American veficls to  
seek the French wnarkets, by.infuring  
them againtt loss, if they happened  
in any instance to be intgrrupred in  
the voyage. - France, I presume,  
might confider our veflels bound  
with provisions to a place besieged  
or blockaded, liable to seizure, after  
due notice of the fa&amp; ; if,.inftead of  
this, they contend for the privilega’  
of paying for them according to the  
terms of the treaty with: Great-Bri­  
tain. I foppofe it will not be de­  
nied to them. But&#x27;if, under presence  
that a weffel is bound .10 a beficged or  
blockaded port, when ftheis not, either  
Franee or Great Britain should seize  
or detain her, it is&#x27;an injury not au­  
thorized by the treaty, or the law of  
nations. This is what ‘both nations  
have done, when their interest or ne­  
cessities required it=~fometimes with,  
and&#x27;often without any apology~and  
what they will often continue to do,  
I fear, ds long as-they know we can­  
not punish them fority = -  
These injuties: are said to have been  
received while .every obje@ around  
reminds us of the tyranny of Britain  
and the generous Affiltance of  
France, during the American war.  
The generosity of Franee and the  
ingratitude of the United States have  
been often fuggefied by some of our  
own Citizens&#x27; and. we. are now s  
proached with it by France herfelf,

rose in her demands during the cam.  
peign of 1777, when our affairs pre­  
sented the molt threatening alped.  
Me rorials were presented in Ayguft  
and September of that year, while  
Gen. Burgoyne”was advancing from  
Canada, in a stile of importunity,  
proportioned to the danger we were  
in from a jun&amp;ion of the two armies ;  
and they were received with increa­  
sed coldnels from the fame cause.  
But when the knowledge of the cap­  
ture ot Burgoyne’s army arrived in  
December, tearing we might be able  
to do ihe business without them, the  
French Couit began to change its  
tone. Io January the Britith minis.  
ter gave norice in the House of Com­  
~mons, that he meant to prépofe  
- terms of accommodation with Ame­  
rica. The French ministry, on the  
atrival of this intelligence in France,  
immediately prefled the conclusion  
of the treaty which they had resisted  
for three years, and proposed terms  
muach ‘more favorable for s, than  
those sar Commiflioners had offered,  
and they had refufed’ thre¢ months  
before. The treaty was signed on  
the Bth February. I perceive no ge­  
nerosity in all this. They did then,  
as we have done now, and as every  
discerning nation will do, they regar­  
ded only their own interest and ad­  
vantage, and not that of any other  
nation. In the interval between the  
declaration of independence and the  
“alliance, with France, that Court  
sometimes ordered away our priva­  
teers, and sometimes restored their  
prizes : They ¢ efufed to reccive an  
ambaflador, or acknowledge our in­  
dependence : All of which was for  
fear of bringing France prématurely  
intg the war. The fat is, that the  
French spoke of very different terms,  
as the condition of their assistance,  
before the Capture of Burgoyne,  
from those aftually agreed on after­  
wards. There can be no doubt, that  
our success on that occasion, and the  
disposition it aypeared to have pro­  
duced in the British ministry, were  
the immediate causes of that alliance.  
It was cerrainly the interest of the  
French to unite with América in the  
war against Great Britain. They  
therefore aéted right in doing this at  
lait, tho’ with two much refinement  
in putting it of so long ; but it is not  
the interelt of the United States to  
be engaged in any war whatfoever—  
much less do they desire to imbrue  
their hands in the blood of cne na­  
tion, to gratify the batred, cr serve  
the intereit of another. We have a&amp;-  
ed right hitherto, in laying it down  
as a principle, not to fuffer ourselves  
to be drawn into the wars of Europe,  
‘and if we must have a war, I hope it  
will be for refufing to depart from  
this principle. . gt  
Our government has afted with  
firmnefs, consistency and mdderation,  
in repelling the unjust pretensions of  
the belligerent powers, as far as rea­  
-fon and argument could have weight.  
it.it has not attempted, in every in­  
stance, 1o preserve our rights by force,  
wherein the remedy would have been.  
worse than the disease, they havenot  
vielded them by concession, in any  
ipftance. lnto whosoever hands the  
adminiftrition of the government  
may now ¢ome, they are called on  
by rhe fuggtitions of a wile policy,  
and the voice of their country to pur­  
sue the fame general line of condu&amp;,  
that has been hitherto pursued, with­  
out vielding to the violence of party  
on either fide. -  
Thev then will be sure of the ap­  
probation and support of the most  
virtnous, which it is hoped are the  
most numerous part, of 1l parties.  
On the contrary, if, departing from  
these principles, they unnecessarily  
involve their country in the_horrors  
of war, they will meet the merited  
execration of good men, and in the  
end, the punithment justly due to  
such condu, from an injured peo­

A Commentary on the marine Laws of France,

How is foreign commerce to be protected within our
