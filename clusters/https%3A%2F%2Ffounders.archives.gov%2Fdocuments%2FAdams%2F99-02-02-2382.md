Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives  
United States 19 March 1798.  
  
The Dispatches, from the Envoys Extraordinary of the United States to the French Republic which were mentioned in my Message to both Houses of Congress of the fifth instant, have been examined and maturely considered.  
While I feel a Satisfaction in informing you, that their Exertions for the Adjustment of the Differences, between the two Nations have been sincere and unremitted, it is incumbent on me, to declare, that I perceive no ground of expectation, that the Objects of their mission, can be accomplished on terms compatible, with the Safety, the honour, or the essential interests of the Nation.  
This result, cannot with Justice be attributed to any want of moderation on the part of this Government, or to any indisposition to forego Secondary interests, for the preservation of Peace. Knowing it to be my Duty, and believing it to be your wish, as well as that of the great Body of the People, to avoid by all reasonable concessions, any participation in the contentions of Europe, the Powers vested in our Envoys were commensurate, with a liberal and pacific Policy, and that high confidence, which might justly be reposed, in the Abilities, Patriotism and Integrity of the Characters, to whom the negotiation, was committed. After a careful review of the whole Subject, with the Aid of all the information I have received, I can discern nothing, which could have insured, or contributed to Success, that has been omitted on my part, and nothing further which can be attempted, consistently with Maxims, for which our Country has contended, at every hazard, and which constitute the Basis, of our national Sovereignty.  
Under these circumstances, I cannot forbear to reiterate the recommendations, which have been formerly made, and to exhort you, to adopt, with promptitude, decision and unanimity, Such measures, as the ample resources of the Country afford, for the protection of our Seafaring and commercial Citizens; for the defence of any exposed portions of our Territory; for replenishing our arsenals, establishing foundries and military Manufactures; and to provide such efficient revennue, as will be necessary to defray extraordinary expences, and Supply the Deficiencies, which may be occasioned by depredations on our commerce.  
The present State of Things is, So essentially different, from that, in which Instructions were given to the Collectors to restrain Vessells of the United States from Sailing in an armed condition, that the Principle on which those orders were issued has ceased to exist. I therefore deem it proper to inform Congress, that I no longer conceive myself justifiable in continuing them, unless in particular Cases where there may be reasonable ground of Suspicion that Such Vessells are intended to be employed contrary to Law.  
In all your Proceedings, it will be important, to manifest a Zeal, Vigour and concert in defence of the National Rights, proportioned to the danger, with which they are threatened.

Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentle-

THE difpatches from the Envoys  
Extraordinary of the United States  
to the French Republic, which were  
mentioned in my meffage to both  
Houfes of Congrefs of the fifth inft.  
have been examined and maturely  
confidered.  
  
While I feel a fatisfaction in in-  
forming you, that their exertions for  
the adjuftment of the differences be-  
tween the two nations have been fin-  
cere and unremitted, it is incumbent  
on me to declare, that I perceive no  
ground of expectation that the objects  
of their miflion can be accomplilhed,  
on terms compatible with the fafety,  
honour, or the effential interefts of the  
nation.  
  
This refult cannot, with juftice, be  
attributed to any want of moderation  
on the part of this government, or to  
any indifpofition to forego fecondary  
interefts, for the prefervation of peace.  
Knowing it to be my duty, and be-  
lieving it to be your wifh, as well as  
that of the great body of the people,  
to avoid, by all reafonable concef-  
fions, any participations in the con-  
tentions of Europe, the powers vefted  
in our Envoys were commentfurate  
with a liberal and pacific policy, and  
that high confidence which might  
juftly be repofed in the patriotiim,  
abilities, and integrity of the charac-  
ters to whom the negociation was  
committed. After a careful review  
of the whole fubjet, with the aid of  
all the informacion I have received, I  
can difcern nothing which could have  
infured or contributed to fuccefs, that  
has been omitted on my part—and  
nothing further which can be at-  
tempted, confiftently with maxims for  
which our country has contended, at  
  
every hazard, and which conftitute  
the bafis of our national fovereignty.  
  
Under thefe circumftances, I can-  
not forbear to reiterate the recom-  
mendations which have been formerly  
made, and to exhort you to adopt,  
with promptitude, decifion, and una-  
nimity, fuch meafures as the ample  
refources of the country afford, for  
the protection of our commercial and  
fea-faring citizens; for the defence  
of any expofed portions of our terri-  
tory; for replenifhing our arfenals ;  
eftablifhing founderies and military  
manufactures ; and to provide fuch  
efficient revenue, as will be neceffary  
to defray extraordinary expences, and  
fupply the deficiencies which may be  
occafioned by depredations on our  
commertce.  
  
The prefent ftate of things is fo  
effentially different from that, in  
which inftructions were given to col-  
lectors to reftrain veffels of the United  
States from failing in an armed con-  
dition, that the principle on which  
thofe orders were iffued has ceafed to  
exift. I therefore deem it proper to  
inform Congrefs, that I no longer  
conceive myfelf juftifiable in conti-  
nuing them, unlefs in particular cafes,  
where there may be reafonable ground  
of fufpicion that fuch veffels are in-  
tended to be employed contrary to  
law.  
  
In all your proceedings, it wiil be  
important to manifeft a zeal, vigour,  
and concert in defence of the national  
rights, proportioned to the danger  
with which they are threatened.

call for papers will be attempted, if  
for no other reason but to take time.  
- The fafety of the Envoys, who pofli­  
bly, though not probably, remain at  
Paris, is the-reason of secrecy on the  
~ part of the Executive, as to the detail  
|of their dispatches. In every other  
view, the most open communication  
is desirable, and was I believe at firft  
intended ; for it is said they contain

THE Dispatches, from the Envoys  
Extraordinary of the United States,  
to the French Republic, which were

Houses of Congress, of the fifth inst.  
have been examined and maturely

WHiLe I feel a fatisfadion in in­

! - THis result, cannot with justice, be  
. attributed, to any want of moderation  
! on the part of this government, or to  
i any indisposition to forego secondary  
| inter?, for the preservation of peace.  
| Knowing it to be my duty and believ­  
i ing it to be your wish, as well as that  
of the great body of the people, to

Envoys were commensurate with a  
liberal and pacific policy, and that  
high confidence, which might juitly  
be répofed in the abilities, patriotism  
and integrity of the .charadters to  
whom the negociation was committed.  
After a careful review of the whole

nothing, which could have insured or  
contributed to success, that has been  
omitted on my part, and nothing  
further which can be attempted, con­  
{iftently with maxims for which our  
country has contended, at every haz­  
ard, and which constitute the basis of  
our national sovereignty.  
Unxper these circumfitances, I can­  
not forbear to reiterate the recom­

‘made, and to exhort you to adopt  
with promptitude, decision and unani­  
mity, such measures as the ample re­  
sources of the country afford, for the

mercial citizens ; for the defence of  
any exposed portions of our territory ;  
for replenishing our Arsenals, establish­  
ing Foundries and military Manufac­

Revenue, as will be neceflary to de­  
fray extraordinary expenses, and {up­  
ply the deficiencies which may be oc­  
casioned by depredations on our com­  
merce. | |  
Tue present state of things, is so  
eflentially different, from -that, in  
which inftruéions were given to col­  
le&amp;ors to restrain veflels of the United  
States from failing in an armed con­  
dition, that the principle, on which  
those orders were iflued, has ceased to  
exist. I therefore deem it proper to  
inform Congress, that I no longer  
conceive myfelf juftifiable in continu­

where there may be reasonable ground  
of suspicion ; that such veflels are in­  
tended to be employed contrary. to

Ix all your proceedings, it will be  
important to manifelt a zeal, vigour
