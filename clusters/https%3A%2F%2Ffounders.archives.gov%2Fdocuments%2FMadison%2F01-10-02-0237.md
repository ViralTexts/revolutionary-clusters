The constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under two general points of view. The first relates to the sum or quantity of power which it vests in the government, including the restraints imposed on the states. The second, to the particular structure of the government, and the distribution of this power, among its several branches.  
Under the first view of the subject two important questions arise; 1. Whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be unnecessary or improper? 2. Whether the entire mass of them be dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several states?  
  
Is the aggregate power of the general government greater

le abuses which must be incident to every power or trust of which a beneficial use can be made. This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good sense of the people of America. It may display the subtlety of the writer; it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation; it may inflame the passions of the unthinking, and may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking. But cool and candid people will at once reflect, that the purest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice must always be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the greater, not the perf

; and that in every political institution, a power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may be misapplied and abused. They will see therefore that in all cases, where power is to be conferred, the point first to be decided is whether such a power be necessary to the public good; as the next will be, in case of an affirmative decision, to guard as effectually as possible against a perversion of the power to the public detriment.  
That we may form a correct judgment on this subject, it will be proper to review the several powers conferred on the government of the union; and that this may be the more conveniently done, they may be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following different objects; 1. Security against foreign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercourse with foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the states; 4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general utility; 5. Restraint of the states from certain injurious acts; 6. Provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers.  
The powers falling within the first class, are those of declaring war, and granting letters of marque; of providing armies and fleets; of regulating and calling forth the militia; of levying and borrowing money.  
Security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential object of the American union. The powers requisite for attaining it, must be effectually confided to the federal councils.  
Is the power of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this question in the negative. It would be superfluous therefore to enter into a proof of the affirmative. The existing confederation establishes this power in the most ample form.  
  
Is the power of raising armies, and equipping fleets necessary? This is involved in the foregoing power. It is involved in the power of self-defence.  
But was it necessary to give an indefinite power of raising troops, as well as providing fleets; and of maintaining both in peace, as well as in war?  
The answer to these questions has been too far anticipated, in another place, to admit an extensive discussion of them in this place. The answer indeed seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion in any place. With what colour of propriety could the force necessary for defence, be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offence? If a federal constitution could chain the ambition, or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations, then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own government, and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety.  
How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit in like manner the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation? The means of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will in fact be ever determined by these rules, and by no others. It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain; because it plants in the constitution itself necessary usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains constantly a disciplined army ready for the service of ambition or revenge, it obliges the most pacific nations, who may be within the reach of its enterprises, to take corresponding precautions. The fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in time of peace. They were introd

he veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valour of all other nations, and rendered her mistress of the world.  
Not less true is it, that the liberties of Rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs, and that the liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few exceptions been the price of her military establishments. A standing force therefore is a dangerous, at the same time that it may be a necessary provision. On the smallest scale it has its inconveniences. On an extensive scale, its consequences may be fatal. On any scale, it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution. A wise nation

.  
The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed constitution. The union itself which it cements and secures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous. America, united with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition, than America disunited, with an hundred thousand veterans ready for combat. It was remarked on a former occasion, that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular situation and her maritime resources, impregnable to the armies of her neighbours, the rulers of Great-Britain have never been able, by real or artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extensive peace establishment. The distance of the United States from the powerful nations of the world, gives them the same happy security. A dangerous establishment can never be necessary or plausible, so long as they continue a united people. But let it never for a moment be forgotten, that they are indebted for this advantage to their union alone. The moment of its dissolution will be the date of a new order of things. The fears of the weaker or the ambition of the stronger states or confederacies, will set the same example in the new, as Charles VII. did in the old world. The example will be followed here from the same motives which produced universal imitation there. Instead of deriving from our situation the precious advantage which Great-Britain has derived from hers, the face of America will be but a copy of that of the continent of Europe. It will present liberty every where crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of disunited America will be even more disastrous than those of Europe. The sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits. No superior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations, inflame their mutual animosities, and render them the instruments of foreign ambition, jealousy and revenge. In America, the miseries springing from her internal jealousies, contentions and wars, would form a part only of her lot. A plentiful addition of evils would have their source in that relation in which Europe stands to this quarter of the earth, and which no other quarter of the earth bears to Europe. This picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be too highly coloured, or too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may cherish in his heart a due attachment to the union of America, and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it.  
Next to the effectual establishment of the union, the best possible precaution against danger from standing armies, is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to their support. This precaution the constitution has prudently added. I will not repeat here the observations, which I flatter myself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory light. But it may not be improper to take notice of an argument against this part of the constitution, which has been drawn from the policy and practice of Great-Britain. It is said that the continuance of an army in that kingdom, requires an annual vote of the legislature; whereas the American constitution has lengthened this critical period to two years. This is the form in which the comparison is usually stated to the public: But is it a just form? Is it a fair comparison? Does the British constitution restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year? Does the American impose on the congress appropriations for two years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy themselves, that the British constitution fixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the legislature, and that the American ties down the legislature to two years, as the longest admissible term.  
Had the argument from the British example been truly stated, it would have stood thus: The term for which supplies may be appropriated to the army establishment, though unlimited by the British constitution, has nevertheless in practice been limited by parliamentary discretion, to a single year. Now if in Great-Britain, where the house of commons is elected for seven years; where so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small a proportion of the people; where the electors are so corrupted by the representatives, and the representatives so corrupted by the crown, the representative body can possess a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term, without desiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a single year; ought not suspicion herself to blush in pretending that the representatives of the United States, elected freely, by the whole body of the people, every second year, cannot be safely entrusted with a discretion over such appropriations, expressly limited to the short period of two years?  
A bad cause seldom fails to betray itself. Of this truth, the management of the opposition to the federal government is an unvaried exemplification. But among all the blunders which have been committed, none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on that side, the prudent jealousy entertained by the people, of standing armies. The attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that important subject; and has led to investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal conviction, not only that the constitution has provided the most effectual guards against danger from that quarter, but that nothing short of a constitution fully adequate to the national defence, and the preservation of the union, can save America from as many standing armies as it may be split into states or confederacies; and from such a progressive augmentation of these establishments in each, as will render them as burdensome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the people; as any establishment that can become necessary, under a united and efficient government, must be tolerable to the former, and safe to the latter.  
The palpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the constitution against a spirit of censure, which has spared few other parts. It must indeed be numbered among the greatest blessings of America, that as her union will be the only source of her maritime strength, so this will be a principal source of her security against danger from abroad. In this respect our situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of Great-Britain. The batteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprizes on our safety, are happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government against our liberties.  
The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of them deeply interested in this provision for naval protection, and if they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of licentious adventurers; if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden invaders, these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of those from whom it claims allegiance, but to causes that are fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern frontiers, no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on this subject than New-York. Her sea coast is extensive. The very important district of the state is an Island. The state itself is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great emporium of its commerce, the great reservoir of its wealth, lies every moment at the mercy of events, and may almost be regarded as a hostage, for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the result of the precarious situation of European affairs, and all the unruly passions attending it, be let loose on the ocean, our escape from insults and depredations, not only on that element but every part of the other bordering on it, will be truly miraculous. In the present condition of America, the states more immediately exposed to these calamities, have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now exists; and if their single resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against the danger, the object to be protected would be almost consumed by the means of protecting them.

 of labour, the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers multiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands not called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures will decrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote stage, the imports may consist in considerable part of raw materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation, and will therefore require rather the encouragement of bounties, than to be loaded with discouraging duties. A system of government, meant for duration ought to contemplate these revolutions, and be able to accommodate itself to them.  
Some who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation, have grounded a very fierce attack against the constitution on the language in which it is defined. It has been urged and echoed, that the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States,” amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alledged to be necessary for the common defence or general welfare. No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labour for objections, than their stooping to such a misconstruction.  
Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congress been found in the constitution, than the general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection might have had some colour for it; though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy the freedom of the press, the trial by jury or even to regulate the course of descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very singularly expressed by the terms “to raise money for the general welfare.”  
But what colour can the objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms, immediately follows; and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon. If the different parts of the same instrument ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear it; shall one part of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent and the clear and precise expressions, be denied any signification whatsoever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural or common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars, which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection, or on the authors of the constitution, we must take the liberty of supposing, had not its origin with the latter.  
The objection here is the more extraordinary, as it appears, that the language used by the convention is a copy from the articles of confederation. The objects of the union among the states as described in article 3d, are, “their common defence, security of their liberties, and mutual and general welfare.” The terms of article 8th, are still more identical. “All charges of war, and all other expences, that shall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in congress shall be defrayed out of a common treasury, &amp;c.” A similar language again occurs in article 9. Construe either of these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on the new constitution, and they vest in the existing Congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever. But what would have been thought of that assembly, if attaching themselves to these general expressions, and disregarding the specifications, which ascertain and limit their import, they had exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defence and general welfare? I appeal to the objectors themselves, whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning in justification of congress, as they now make use of against the convention. How difficult it is for error to escape its own condemnation.

- © The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier, are all of them deeply in-  
terested in this provision for naval protection, and if they have hitherto  
been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds; if their property has remained  
safe against the predatory spirit of licentious adventurers; if their mari-  
time towns have not yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the  
terrors of a conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of sudden and daring  
invaders, these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the  
capacity of the existing government for the protection of those from whom  
it claims allegiance, but to causes that are fugitive and fallacious. If we ex-  
cept perhaps Virginia and Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on  
their eastern frontiers, no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety  
on this subject than New York. Her sea coast is extensive. A very im-  
portant district of the state, is an island. The state itself, is penetrated by a  
large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great emporium of its  
commerce, the great reservoir of its wealth, lies every moment at the  
mercy of events, and may almost be regarded as a hostage, for ignominious  
compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy; or even with the rapa-  
cious demands of pirates and barbarians. Should a war be the result of the  
precarious situation of European affairs, and all the unruly passions attend-  
ing it be let loose on the ocean, our escape from insults and depredations, not  
only on that element, but every part of the other bordering on it will be truly

Some, who have not denied tin* necessity of the  
|H&gt;vyero| luxation, Imve grounded a very tierce attack  
agaiiiM the constitution,on ll&gt;r language in vvl:icti it  
is defined. It lias been uiged anil cc.lmcil, that the  
power “ to lay and roller I taxes, duties, impost, and  
excises, to pay debts, and provide for tin: common  
deleave and general welfare of tin: United States,”  
annnoils to an uiiliuiitcd commission to exercise eve­  
ry pewir, vv li it li may be alleged to lie lieecssarv for  
lln- common delence. or gcnei al welfare. No stronger  
prool could In* given ol the distress under vvbicli  
these writers lal&gt;&lt;&gt;r for objections, than their stooping  
to such a misconstrue) ion.  
Iltul no other enumeration or definition of the  
powers ol the congress been found in the constitution,  
than the general expressions just cited, the authors  
ol the objection might have had some colour for it *,  
though it would have been dillicult to find a reason  
lor so awkward a form of describing an authority to  
legislate in nil possible cases. A power to destroy  
the freedom ol the press, the trial by jury, or ev en to  
regulate the course of descents, or the forms of con­  
veyances, must be very singularly expresied by the  
terms “ to raise money for the general welfare.’’  
But what colour can the objection have, when a  
specification of llie object, alluded to by these gene­  
ra! terms, immediately follows : and is not even sepa­  
rated by a longer pause than a semicolon.&#x27; If I lit*  
different parts of tin? same instrument ought to be so  
expounded, »* to give meaning to every pail which  
will bear it ; shall one part of the same sentence lie  
excluded altogether from a share in tin* meaning ;  
and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be  
i claim&#x27;d in their full extent, and the clear and precise  
expressions, be denied any signification whatsoever ?  
I-or vvliat purpose could the cmiuirrntioii of pari i&lt; ular  
powers he inserted, if these and all others w ere to be  
included in the precedinggener.il power ? Nothing  
is more naiiir.il or common, than first to use a general  
phtnse, and then to explain ami (jualiiy it by a recital  
ol particulars. But the idea ol an enumeration of  
particulars, which neither explain nor ipialify the ge­  
neral meaning, anil can have no other cfl’ccl than to  
confound ami mislead, is a*i absurdity vvbicli, as we  
are reduced to the dilemma of charging cither on the  
authors of the objection, or on the authors ofllie  
constitution, we must take the liberty of supposing,  
had not its origin with the hitter.  
1 he objection here is llie more cxtronrdnmrv :i. it  
  
appears, licit the language used In the convention, is  
a copy (rout the articles of confederation. The ob­  
jects of the union among the states, as described in  
article 3d, ace, “ their coinmon defence, security of  
&#x27;[ ibeir liberties, and mutual and general welfare.”  
1 lie terms of article fit It, are still more identical.—  
“ All charges of war, and all other expenses, that  
“ shall he incurred for the common defence or getter*  
*• al welfare, and allowed by the United States in  
congress, ^ shall be defrayed out ol a common  
treasury, 6lo. ’ A similar language again occurs in  
article 9. Construe either of these at tides, by the  
rules which would justify the construction put on the  
new constitution, and they vest in the existing eou­  
gress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever.—  
lint what would have, been thought nf that assembly,  
it attaching (hciusrlves to these general expressions,  
and disregarding the specification-, which ascertain  
and limit tlicir import, they had exercised an unlimit­  
ed power of providing for the coarnoii defence and  
general welfare ? | appeal to the objectors them­

friendly to a Government even stronger than the present ; who  
were, therefore, not likely to diminish the powers actually  
granted by the Constitution; and whose exposition was made  
before time and circumstances could induce them to modify any  
opinions on the doctrines and powers of the Constitution, from  
personal or party considerations.  
  
It now remains to examine the clauses of the Constitution  
itself, and endeavour to ascertain their import, their actual  
extent, and their proper and necessary limitations.  
  
The powers conferred on the Government of the Union, say  
the authors of the ‘‘ Federalist,” (No.41,) may be reduced into  
different classes, as they relate to the following different objects:  
Ist. Security against foreign danger; 2d. Regulation of the  
intercourse with foreign nations; 3d. Maintenance of harmony  
and proper intercourse among the States; 4th. Certain miscel-  
laneous objects of general utility ; 5th. Restraint of the States  
from certain injurious acts ; 6th. Provisions for giving due efficacy  
to all these powers.

use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of

neither explain or qualify the general meaning, and can have no other

by the ome ?  
|. Mr. D. read from the 41st No. of the “Federal-  
| ist’? upon this point:  
  
“Next to the effectual establishment of the Union, the  
| hest possible precaution against danger from standing ar-  
| mies, is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be  
appropriated to their support. This precaution, the Consti-  
tution has prudently added. [ will not repeat here the obser  
| vations which, I flatter myself, have placed the subject in a  
just and satisfactory tight. But it may not be improper to  
take notice of an argument against this part of the Consti-  
| tution, which has been drawn from the policy and practice  
of Great Britain. It is said that the continuance of an army  
| in that kingdom requires an annual vote of the legislature ;  
| whereas the American Constitution has lengthened this  
| critical period to two years. This is the form in which the  
| comparison is usually stated to the public: but is it a just  
form ?—is ita fair comparison? Does the British Constita-  
tion restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year? Does  
the American impose on the Congress appropriations for two  
| years? On the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors  
| of the fallacy themselves, that the British Constitution fixes  
  
|| no limit whatever to the discretion of the legistature, and that  
|| the American ties down the legislature to two years, as the  
|| longest adiwissible term.  
  
Had the argument from the Brit  
ish example been truly stated, it would have steod thus:  
the term for which supplies may be appropriated to the army  
  
i} establishment, though unlimited by the British Constiiution,  
  
| has nevertheless in practice been limited, by parliamentary  
discretion, to a single year. Now, if, in Great Britain, where  
the House of Commons is elected for seven years; where  
so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small  
a proportion of the people; where the electors are 80 cor-  
rupted by the representatives, and the representatives so  
corrupted by the Crown, the representative body can jfos-  
séss a power to make appropriations to the army for an in-  
definite term, without desiring, or without daring to extend  
| the term beyond a single year; ought not suspicion herself  
| to blush, in pretending that the Representatives of the Uni-  
ted States, eleeted freely by the whole body of the people  
every second year, cannot be aafely intrusted with a discre-  
appropriations, expreesly limited to the short  
period of two years ?  
  
A bad cause seldom fails to betray itself. Of this truth,  
the management of the opposition to the Federal Govern-  
ment is an unvaried exemplification. But among all the  
blunders which have been committed, none is more striking  
than the attempt to inlist on that side the prudent jeal-  
ousy entertained by the cs ge of standing armies. he  
attempt has awakened fally the public attention to that  
important subject, and has led to investigations which must  
| terminate in a thorough aad universal conviction, not only  
that the Constitution has provided the most effectual guards  
against danger from that quarter, but that nothing short of  
a Constitution fully adequate to the national defence, and  
the preservation of the Union, can save America from as  
many standing armies as it may be split into States or Con-  
federacies; and from such a progressive augmentation of  
these establishments in each, as will render them as bur-

notices the similarity of the general ae of the article in  
the Constitution to the description of the objects of the asso-  
ciation of the States, given in the third and eighth articles of  
the agreement for ‘the confederation, which was the only  
comp - until the present Constitution was adopted in 1787  
The object of the Union, as described in the thir 1 article, was  
for the ‘common defence, security of their ] entees, and  
mutual ar a ‘al welfare. In article eight ; is agreed,  
“that all cha arees a war, and all other expens¢ 3 that Shall be  
incurred for the common defence or general welfare, —  
allowed by the United States, in Congress assembled, shall  
be defrayed out of a common treasury.” As Madison justly  
remarks, these articles, construed by the rules ju tify ing the  
construction put upon the new Constitution by those who  
attach so large a meaning to the general words preceding and  
concluding the grant of specific powers, would Sie ive vested a  
the old Federal Congress a power to legislate in all cas  
whatsoever.

But Madison, who was, in the convention, sufficiently inclined  
to invest the new government with large powers, answers this  
proposition with the weight of his authority. In the forty-first  
number of the Federalist, he notices the objection, that the power  
given ‘‘to provide for the common defence and general welfare  
of the United States,”” amounted to ‘‘ a commission to exercise  
every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common  
defence, or general welfare.’’ But he says that “no stronger  
proof could be given of the distress under which these writers  
labor for objections, than their stooping to such a misconstruction.  
Had no other enumeration, or definition, of the powers of Congress  
been found in the Constitution, than the general expressions just  
cited, the authors of the objection might have had some color for  
it, though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so  
awkward a form for describing an authority to legislate in all  
possible cases. But what color can the objection have, when a  
specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms  
immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause  
than a semi-colon? For what purpose could the enumeration of  
particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant  
to be included in the preceding general power ?”

here. He calls attention to a circumstance which conclusively  
established the interpretation given by him to these general words.  
The third and eighth articles of the confederation contain precisely  
the same idea and expression. The object of the union of the  
colonies, as described in the third article, was for “‘ their common  
defence, security of their liberties, and mutual and general wel-  
fare.”’ In article eighth, it was agreed “ that all charges of war,  
and all other expenses which shall be incurred for the common  
defence, or general welfare, and allowed by the United States, in  
Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury.”

In addition to the above, let us see the opinion of Mr. Madison, as to the  
import of this phrase, as found in the Federalist, a work by no means favor-  
able to State supremacy. “Some,” says he, ‘ have grounded a fierce attack  
upon the Constitution on the language in which it is defined.” It has been  
urged and echoed that the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,  
and excises; to pay the public debts, and to provide for the common defense  
and general welfare, amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every  
power which may be alleged to be necessary for common defense and wel-  
fare.” Nostronger proof could be given of the distress under which these  
writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such misconstruction.  
Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of Congress been  
found in the Constitution, than the general expression just cited, the authors  
of the objection might have had some color for it, though i  
difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describi

to legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy the freedom of the  
press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate the course of descents, or the  
forms of conveyances, must be very singularly expressed by the terms “to  
raise money for the general welfare.” The objection here is more extraordi-  
nary, as it appears the language used by the Convention is a copy of the  
articles of confederation. The objects of Union among the States, as de-  
scribed in Article 3d, are, ‘‘Their common defense and general welfare.” Th¢  
terms of the Sth article are more identical: “All charges of war and othe:  
expenses, that shall be incurred for the common defense and general welfare,  
and allowed by the United States in Congress, shall be defrayed out of the  
common treasury.” A similar language occurs in Article 9th. Construe either  
  
of these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on  
the new Constitution, and they vest in the existing Congress a power to  
legislate in all cases whatever. But what would have been thought of that  
assembly, if, attaching themselves to these general expressions, and disre-  
garding the specifications which ascertain and limit their import, they had  
exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense and gene  
ral welfare? I appeal to the objectors themselves, whether they would, in  
that case, have employed the same reasoning in justification of Congress, as  
they now make use of it against the Convention? “ How difficult is it for  
error to escape its own condemnation !” (Page 315.

&quot;The clearest marks of this prudence are  
stamped on the proposed Constitution. The  
Union itself, which it cements and secures, de­  
stroys every pretext for a military establishment  
which could be dangerous. America united,  
with a handful of troops, or without a single sol­  
dier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign  
ambition than America disunited with a hundred  
thousand veterans ready for combat. It was re  
marked, on a former occasion, that the want of  
this pretext had saved tbe liberties of one nation  
in Europe. Being rendered by her insular situ­  
ation, and her maritime resources, impregnable  
to the armies of her neighbors, tbe rulers of  
Great Britain have never been able, by real or  
artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an ex­  
tensive peace establishment. The distance of  
the United States from the powerful nations of  
tbe world, gives them the same happy security.  
A dangerous establishment can never be neces­  
sary or plausible, so long as they continue a uni­  
ted people. But let it never for a moment be for  
gotten, that they are indebted for this advantage  
to their union alone. The moment qf its dissolu­  
tion will be the date of a new order of things.—  
The fears of the weaker, or the ambition of the  
stronger States, or Confederacies, will set the  
same example in tbe new as Charles VII did in  
the old world. The example will be followed  
here, from the same motives which produced  
universal imitation there. Instead of deriving  
from our situation the precious advantage which  
Great Britain has derived from hers, tbe face of  
American will be but a copy of that of the con­  
tinent oi Europe. It will present liberty every­  
where crushed between standing armies, and per­  
petual taxes. The for tunes of disunited America  
will be even more disastrous than those of Europe.  
The sources of evil in the latter are confined to  
her own limits. No superior powers of another  
quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival na­  
tions, inflame tbeir mutual animosities, and ren­  
der them the instruments of foreign ambition,  
jealousy and revenge. In America the miseries  
springing from her internal jealousies, conten­  
tions and wars, would form a part only of her  
lot. A plentiful addition of evils, would have  
their source in that relation in which Europe  
stands to this quarter of the earth, and which no  
other quarter of the earth bears to Europe.  
This picture of the consequences of disunion  
cannot be too highly colored, or too of tin exhibi­  
ted. Every man who loves peace ; every man who  
loves his country; every man who loves liberty,  
ought to have it ever before his eyes, that he may  
cherish in his heart a due attachment to the  
UNION of America, and be able to set a due  
value on the means of preserving it.

and conclusive, as scarcely to justify such a discussion in  
any place. With what color of propriety could the force  
necessary for defence be limited by those, who cannot limit  
the force of offence? If a Federal Constitution could re-  
strain the ambition, or set bounds to the exertions of all  
other nations, then, indeed, might it prudently restrain the  
discretion of its own government, and set bounds to the ex-  
ertions for its own safety.”

a measure which he considered so indispensable to the public  
good, or ‘general welfare,’ of the country? Just about as  
much as he cared for the idle whistling of the wind.  
  
We have said that Mr. Madison’s reasoning was absolutely  
conclusive. Let the reader examine it and judge for himself.  
Here it is: ‘Had no other enumeration or definition of the  
powers of the Congress been found in the Constitution than  
the general expression just cited, the authors of the objection .  
might have had some color for it, though it would have been  
difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing  
an authority to legislate in all possible cases. A power to  
destroy the freedom of the press, the trial by jury, or even to  
regulate the course of descents, or the forms of conveyances,  
must be very singularly expressed by the terms “to raise money  
for the general welfare.”  
  
‘But what color can the objection have, when a specifica-  
tion of the objects alluded to by these general terms immedi-  
ately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause  
than a semi-colon? If the different parts of the same instru-  
ment ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every  
part which will bear it, shall one part of the same sentence  
be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning, and shall  
the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full  
extent, and the clear and precise expressions be denied any  
signification whatever? For what purpose could the enumer-  
ation of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others  
were meant to be included in the preceding general power?  
Nothing is more natural or common than first to use a general  
phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of par-  
ticulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars, which  
neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have  
no other effect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity  
which, as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either  
on the authors of the objection or on the authors of the Con-  
stitution, we must take the liberty of supposing had not its  
origin with the latter.  
  
‘The objection here is the more extraordinary, as it appear

that the language used by the Convention is a copy from the  
Articles of Confederation. The object of the union among  
the States, as described in article third, are “their common  
defence, security of their liberties, and mutual and general  
welfare.” The terms of article eight are still more identical:  
“‘ All charges of war, and all other expenses that shall be in- |  
curred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed  
by the United States in Congress, shall be defrayed out of a  
common treasury,” etc. A similar language again occurs in  
article nine. Construe either of these articles by the rules  
which would justify the construction put on the new Consti-  
tution, and they vest in the existing Congress a power to legis-  
late in all cases whatsoever. But what would have been  
thought of that assembly if, attaching themselves to these  
general expressions, and disregarding the specifications which  
ascertain and limit their import, they had exercised an unlim-  
ited power of providing for the common defence and general  
welfare? 1 appeal to the objectors themselves, whether they  
would in that case have employed the same reasoning in justi-  
fication of Congress as they now make use of against the Con-  
vention. How difficult it is for error to escape its own con-  
demnation !’

the Constitution, and should therefore be re­

The inquiry to which Madison here addresses

late for, and that it shall not ene money ex-  
cept for the Feneral welfare. No. 41 of the  
  
ederalist I find these words: It has been  
urged and echoed that the power to lay and col-  
lect taxes, duties, rmposts, and excises; to pay  
the debts and provide for the common defense  
and general welfare of the United States, amounts  
to an unlimited commission to exercise any

stronger proof could be given of the distress  
under which these writers labor for objections  
than their stooping to such a misconstruction.  
Had no other enumeration or definition of the  
powers of Congress been found in the Constita-

&quot;Some, who have not denied the  
neceBsityof tbe power of taxation,  
have grounded a very fierce attack  
against the constitution, on the lan­  
guage i:i which it is defined. It  
has been urged and echoed, that the  
power &quot;to lay and collect taxes, du  
ties, imposts, and excises, to pay J  
debts, and provide for the common  
defence and general welfare of the  
United States,&quot; amounts to an un­  
limited commission to exercise e­  
ery power, which may -be alleged to  
be necessary for the common de­  
fence or general welfare No stron­  
ger proof could be given of tho dis­  
tress under which these writers la­  
bour for objections,&#x27; than their  
stooping to such a miconstruct-  
ion. i  
&quot;Had no other enumeration or  
definition of tbo powers of the con  
gress been found in the constitution,  
than the general expressions just  
cited, the authors of the objection  
might have had some colour for it;  
though it would haye been difficult  
to find a reason for so awkward a  
form of describing an authority to  
legislate in all possible cases. A  
power to destroy the freedom of the  
press, the trial by jury, or even to  
regulate the course of descents, or  
the forms of conveyances, must be  
very singularly expressed by the  
terms &quot;to raise maney for the gen­  
eral welfare.&quot;  
&quot;But what colour can the ob­  
jection have, when a specification of  
the objects alluded to by these gen­  
eral terms, immediately fellowsjand  
is not even separated by a longer  
Sause - than a semicolon? If i the  
ifferent parts cf th same instru­  
ment ought-.to-be so expounded, as  
to give meaning to every part which  
will bear it; shall one part of the  
same gentenco.be excluded altogeth  
  
er from a share in the meaning; and  
shall the mora doubtful and inde­  
finite term be retained in their full  
extent and th6 clear and express  
declarations ba denied any significa­  
tion whatsoever? For what purpose  
could the enumeration of particular  
powers be inserted, if thess and all  
others were meant to be included ic  
the preceding general power? Noth­  
ing is more natural or common, than  
first to use a general phrase, and  
thee to explain und qualify it by a  
recital of particulars. Bat the idea  
of an exnumeration of particulars  
which neither explain nor  
qualify the general meaning  
and can have no other effect  
than to confound and mislead,  
is an absurdity which, as we are re­  
duced to the dilemma of charging  
either on the authors of tho.object­  
tion,or on the authors of the consti­  
tution, we must take the liberty of  
supposing, had not its oriein with  
the latter.-&quot;  
Trie same writer then goes on to  
say that the &quot;general welfare elapse&quot;  
was copied from tho old Articled of  
Confederation and is used in that  
instrument three times. Now the  
old Confederacy was a very weak  
government, ytt it gave to the Con­
