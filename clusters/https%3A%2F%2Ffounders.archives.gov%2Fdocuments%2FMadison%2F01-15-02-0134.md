[30 January 1794]  
  
  
The Committee of the Whole continued its consideration of JM’s resolutions.  
  
  
As it appeared, he said, that most of the objections against the proposed Resolutions, had been made by those who meant to combat them, and that a question would soon be called for; it might perhaps be expected that he should review those objections, and assign the reasons which induced him to continue in the opinion he at first entertained. He wished it not to be understood, that he meant to examine every particular argument, which in the course of so extensive a discussion, had been opposed to the measure. The Committee must have perceived, that some of them had been of a nature not to merit an answer; and that others had sufficiently answered themselves. He should extend his observations to such topics only as might be thought to need explanation, and to have an influence on the question.  
Previous, however, to this general survey of the ground which had been travelled over, he should so far presume on the patience of the committee, as to recur to the original opposition made by the member from South Carolina (Mr. Smith); and to take notice of some particulars in what had been urged by him, which were left unanswered at the time.  
The gentleman had thought proper to introduce his discourse with a very unmerited attack on the late Secretary of State, and to mingle with it a variety of criticisms on the facts and opinions stated in his report, on the subject under consideration. The spirit and manner in which the attack had been made, and which could not have escaped the attention of the committee, would be left in that silence which may best express the sentiment they must have inspired. He should indeed have thought it less necessary to take further notice than he had already done, of the matter of the gentleman’s remarks; if attempts had not been made particularly by a friend of the gentleman (Mr. Ames) to give a weight to his statements and inferences, which it would be shewn they did not merit; and if the task did not afford an opportunity of elucidating some particular points relied on, by the opponents of the resolutions.  
It was made a charge against the secretary of State, that he takes no notice of the higher duty imposed by Great Britain on other foreign tobacco, than is imposed on American, (the former being 3/6 ster. a pound, the latter ⅓) whilst he takes care to mention the high duty imposed on the American; although the discrimination is in favour of the United States, and is against Portugal, a country in particular connection with Great Britain; and although the high duty of ⅓ is immaterial to the United States, being paid by the consumer of the Tobacco in Great Britain.  
It was unfortunate for the gentleman that this charge is fallacious in every member of it.  
1. The discrimination is not in favour of the United States, either in its intention, or in its operation: not in its intention, because it was made in reference to this country, when it was a part of the British Empire, and not in reference to us as Independent States; not in its operation, because if the discrimination were abolished, it would bring no rival of our tobacco into the British market. This is proved by the fact, that in other markets, as that of France, where no such discrimination exists, the American tobacco is without a rival. It was well known that this and the other apparent favours to this country, were a remnant of the Old Colo

ial code, which having become a dead letter in the Statute book, had not yet been struck out of it.  
2. If the discrimination had no effect in favor of the United States, it could not, for the same reason, be a prejudice to Portugal. If it were necessary and proper to go into the enquiry, more direct proofs could be given on this point.  
3. High duties do affect the United States which produce the article, though paid by the British consumers. They have a double effect: They lessen the quantity called for; and by lessening the competition, they lessen also the price. This was a truth that could need no comment.  
It was to be remarked however, that the zeal of the gentleman on this subject was such, that it had led him to extend the fallacy of his reasoning to rice, the staple article of his own State. This article pays a duty of 7/4 ster. per hundred weight, but like the duty on tobacco, being paid by the consumer, was said to be of little concern to us.  
Call the price of rice 10/ sterling: the duty is 7/4. The whole class of people, then, in Great-Britain, between the class who cannot afford to eat rice at the price of 10/. and the class who are willing to eat it at 17/4 are prohibited the consumption by the duty. Was this a circumstance of no concern to the rice planters? The gentleman should have been reminded of his error by his own arguments.  
As an apology for the duty imposed in Great-Britain, he tells us it was meant to prevent the use of rice as a substitute, for the bread-stuffs produced by Great-Britain herself. Without the preventing duty then, rice would have been substituted in place of wheat, in the opinion of the British Parliament, and the demand for it, in the British market, so far increased.  
  
As a merit in the British West-India regulations over those of France, it was stated by the gentleman, that rice in the West-Indies is a common food; that in the British, the importation of it is free, in the French, subject to a duty, though an inconsiderable one. In Britain then, where there is a high duty, rice is not an article of common food: in the islands where there is no duty, it is a common food; and the advantage of the British West-India market to us over the French, is, that the duty in the latter favors cheaper substitutes.  
Another proof of the disposition of Great-Britain to favor the United States in the West-India market, is the prohibition of all foreign rice but the American. The same remark may be repeated here, which was applied to the discrimination in favor of our tobacco. It is an old colony regulation that has no effect whatever. What other foreign rice could be brought to the West-Indies? Is it the East-India rice? That is prohibited by its distance. Is it the rice of Portugal? That is prohibited by the laws of Portugal, and probably also by the lower price of the Carolina rice.  
The inference which the gentleman had drawn from the comparative regulations of Great-Britain and France on the subject of rice was so curious that it was worth a moment’s attention.  
The facts Mr. M. observed, stood thus. In France the duty is ⅓ per cent. In Great-Britain 7/4 sterling a hundred. In the French islands the duty is 1 per cent. In the British free with a prohibition of other foreign rice.  
As the duty of 1 per cent. is scarcely sensible, and the prohibition, as shewn, is merely nominal, the inequality in the islands may be regarded as too immaterial to affect the comparison.  
Passing to the two parent states, the duty in France is ⅛ per cent. The duty in Great Britain, 50 or 60 per cent.  
Here then is nearly an equality in one part, and a difference of 50 or 60 per cent. in the other part of the two dominions; and yet the gentleman could say, it was not easy to pronounce, whether the article of rice stands on a better footing in the system of one, than in the system of the other.  
Another charge against the secretary of state is, that his report calls the discriminating duties in Great Britain in favor of American wood, small, whereas they are considerable, and in several instances, high.  
Mr. M. said he had not found leisure to trace this branch of our exports into all the details necessary to decide in what degree the duties were small or considerable, and in what proportion the several dutied articles went to Great Britain. He observed in general that the greater part of our woods were exported to the West Indies, not to Great Britain. That in the ship-woods at least the Baltic nations were not rivals to the United States. It was known that Sweden and Denmark were so deficient in Oak that their public navies were supplied from Germany, and that the ship timbers of Russia were transported a thousand or twelve hundred miles from her interior dominions. The Fir, of which the Swedish and Danish merchant ships were built, does not last more than seven or eight years, and could not therefore be a rival to the durable woods of the United States.  
He observed also that lumber, and particularly the ship woods of this country, were so precious and so sure of being in demand, that they never could fear a rival, or need a foreign bounty. This was an article very different from such as were an annual product of the earth, and as could be raised wherever the climate and soil permitted, according to the occasional demand. The forests that were to supply the ship yards were the growth of centuries, and where once destroyed, as they generally are in Europe, are rarely replaced at all, and never can become the rival to America, which enjoys them as the spontaneous gift of nature.  
To enhance the merit of the British regulations, the gentleman had told us, that wood was subject to a duty of 1 per cent. in the French Islands, and in the British free, with a prohibition of other foreign wood. This was of little consequence. The duty was a trifle, and falling on a necessary article to be got no where else, probably was paid by the French islanders. And the prohibition was ideal, the American wood being the only resource for the British market.  
The article of Fish, was admitted by the gentleman himself to be more favored by the French than the British system, tho’ he admits it with reluctance and diminishes the difference as much as possible. The case however is so clear, and the facts so palpable, that they speak for themselves. Under the French regulations, this important article of our commerce, is subject to duties only, in Europe and the West Indies. Under the British, it is under prohibition in both. The amount of the whole export is 383,237 quintals of dry, and 57,424 barrels of pickled fish. Of this the French consumption, is 252,171 quintals and 45,164 barrels; that is, nearly ⅔ of the dry, and 4/5 of the pickled fish.  
Here Mr. M. proceeding to the subject of whale oil, called the attention of the committee particularly to the representation and language of Mr. Smith as to the conduct of France, in inviting the fishermen of Nantucket to remove and settle at Dunkirk. Mr. Smith, he said, had not only undervalued the monopoly of the French market granted to the United States, but had, by a mutilated quotation of a report of the secretary of state on the fisheries, changed the true aspect of the attempt to draw away the Nantucket fishermen. The fact was, that although the

duct of France was very different from what was to have been wished, as well as from what was contemplated by the marquis la Fayette, who had patronized the interest of the fishermen, yet that the project of tempting them to emigrate had originated in Great-Britain, and was a counter-project on the part of France. How the gentleman happened to omit the antecedent attempt of Great-Britain, and thereby exaggerate that of France, Mr. M. did not undertake to explain: but it was the more extraordinary, as the whole account of the transaction was contained in the same page of the report, nay in the same paragraph, from which the gentleman had extracted his information.  
Here he read the passage in that report and produced the British statute, inviting the whale-fishermen, by an offer of certain privileges to emigrate to Great-Britain.  
A further charge against the secretary of state is that in his statement of the tonnage of the United States employed in the trade with the French and British dominions, he founds it, not on the actual number of ships, but on the number of entries. This charge was as singular as it was uncandid.  
The report stated the fact, that the American tonnage entering our ports from the several nations with which the United States traded, was so and so; and, in this statement, it pursued the official returns made on the subject. What more was to be required?  
In giving the fact, the Secretary imposed on no one, because he stated the tonnage to be entry tonnage, as it really was.  
He followed the best guide that existed, an official return from the proper offices.  
No return of the actual tonnage, as distinguished from the entry tonnage, had at the time, ever been made from any office, or called for by any act, of Congress.  
The first return ever made in the latter form, was called for since the Resolutions on the table were proposed.  
These considerations might have restrained the gentleman from this unwarranted attack on the accuracy of the Report.  
But he ought at least to have been sure, that whilst he was charging the Secretary with following an erroneous guide, he was himself following one that was not erroneous. The examination of this point involved facts which merited the particular attention of the committee.  
The statement of the entry tonnage of the United States in foreign trade for 1792, lately called for and reported, is 415,331 tons. The statement of the actual tonnage for the same year is 289,394 tons.  
On comparing these two quantities, it was evident that both could not be right. If the entry tonnage was no more than was stated, it was inconceivable that the actual tonnage could be as much as was stated. It would allow the vessels in the European and West India trades together, but some what more than one voyage and a third a year. It could never be supposed, that this corresponded with the fact. How then was the inconsistency in the two statements to be explained? Mr. M. said, as he did not know by what rule the actual tonnage was made up, he would form no conjecture on the subject. He hoped, and wished that some gentleman more conversant with it, would solve the phenomenon. He did not call on the gentleman from South Carolina, because he most of all, must be puzzled to account for it; having stated that our vessels in the trade to Europe make two voyages, and in the West India trade four voyages a year.  
Besides the evidence contained in this comparison of the aggregate tonnage in the two different forms, in which it had been reported, the existence of error somewhere, and probably in the account of the actual tonnage resulted from a comparative view of our exports to the British dominions, for the two years of 1790 and 1792, and of the whole tonnage American and British employed in conveying them.  
In the former year the exports were 9,363,416 dollars. In the latter 8,269,495 dollars: the excess for 1790, 1,093,921 dollars.  
The entry tonnage, British and American for 1790, was 273,580 tons.  
The British entry tonnage for 1792 was 206,384 tons. The actual American tonnage for 1792, was, according to the official statement, 66,582 tons: which turned into entry tonnage, according to the proportion of the whole actual, to the whole entry tonnage for that year, makes the American entry tonnage, in the trade to Great Britain about 95,000 tons. Adding this to the British entry tonnage of 206,384 tons, the British and American together for 1792, amounts to 301,384 tons; which exceeds the tonnage of 1790 no less than 27,804 tons.  
According to this calculation, which embraces the actual tonnage as stated to the house, there would be 27,804 tons more, employed in transporting 1,093,921 dollars less; making our tonnage to increase in that proportion as the employment of it decreased.  
There was a possibility, Mr. M. observed, that the course of trade in the two years, might be such that more of the vessels employed in the exportations to Great Britain, might be entered in 1790 as coming from some other country, than in 1792; but as there was no known circumstance which authorized this solution, and as it seemed demonstrable in general, that error existed somewhere in the statements, and most probably in those of the actual tonnage, he concluded that it ought to be referred to that source; and consequently, that the guide followed by the secretary of state, to wit, the entry tonnage, the only one he had to follow, was not more inaccurate, than the actual tonnage would have been, which guided the member from South Carolina.  
Another position of the secretary of state on which a charge is founded is, “that the greater part of what Great Britain receives from the United States is re-exported.” This position, Mr. M. reminded the committee, related to Great Britain, without comprehending the West India islands; which formed a distinct branch in the secretary’s report. How far it was liable to the exceptions taken against it, would appear from an examination of facts.  
To obviate criticisms, Mr. M. said he would take for the basis of his calculations, the statement given in detail by the gentleman himself, of the exports for 1790 to the French and British dominions; which though not extended to every item, approached so near to a full view of the trade, as to be adequate to the purpose.  
In this statement the exports to Great Britain stand at 6,651,429 dollars: from which must be subtracted, for the comparison, the amount of the several re-exportations as far as they can be liquidated.  
Tobacco. It appears from an official document, that the tobacco exported to Great-Britain in 1791, was 67,286 hogsheads. A return for another year states the quantity to be 52,505 hogsheads. It appeared from the revenue returns of Great-Britain, that the consumption of this article amounted to 9,600 hogsheads. The proportion re-exported might then be reasonably set down at four-fifths of the quantity imported.  
Rice. To obtain the proportion of rice re-exported, we may take the medium quantity imported for three years immediately preceding the revolution, which, according to a table in Anderson’s History of Commerce, was 486,543 cwt. By another table for the same period, the medium quantity exported was 349,653 cwt. The difference marks the consumption, and is 136,890 cwt. The quantity exported to Great Britain from the United States in 1792, was 58,978 barrels, equal to 294,890 cwt. Comparing the quantity consumed with this quantity, it appears that more than half, though less than two-thirds, is re-exported—call the reexportation one-half only of the present importation.  
Indigo. According to a statement in Anderson, the medium importations into Great-Britain, for three years immediately preceding the revolution, were about thrice the medium quantity exported. Call the proportion re-exported now, however, one-fifth only, which is probably below the fact.  
From these proportions, and the data furnished by the gentleman’s own statements, results the following justification of the report of the Secretary on this point.

Here, then, it appears, that the re-exportations of the four articles alone, of Tobacco, Rice, Indigo and Wheat, are greater than the whole consumption in Great-Britain, of the articles imported from the United States, although the most unfavourable year has been taken, for the enquiry; and, consequently, that the position of the Secretary of State, was well founded.  
If it were necessary to investigate the full amount of re-exportations, several articles might have been added to the list, such as Whale-Oil, Ginseng, Flax-Seed, &amp;c.  
Nor would it be unfair, perhaps, to include the primitive value of the articles, re-exported in the new forms given to them by art. A great proportion of what is sent from the United States to Great Britain, in a rude state, is worked into articles of merchandize, and exported in the course of trade. Take, for example, the two articles of Pot and Pearl Ashes, and Indigo.  
The amount of the export of the former to Great-Britain, is stated at 747,078 dollars; of which, if no part is re-exported in its unaltered state, the whole enters into British manufactures. Supposing one-third of these particular manufactures, to be exported, which appears to be nearly the general proportion, the value of Pot and Pearl Ashes re-exported, is 249,026 dollars. The Indigo used in Great-Britain has appeared to be 379,064 dollars, one-third of which re-exported as an ingredient in manufactures, is 126,354⅔ dollars. These two items alone amount to 375,380⅔ dollars, and with many others, might be added to the mass of re-exportations. But they are stated rather to throw light on the general character of our trade with G. Britain, than to be relied on in the present case, which has been sufficiently elucidated by more direct and simple views of it.  
Mr. M. proceeded to apply the calculations he had made, to the question discussed by Mr. Smith, in relation to the comparative importance of the French and British markets to the productions of the United States.  
By deducting the 3,501,067 dollars, re-exported, from the 6,651,429 dollars, imported into Great Britain, he reduced her actual consumption to 3,150,362 dollars, to which adding the 1,805,744 exported to the West India market, the whole British consumption stands at no more than 4,956,106 dollars. On comparing this with the exports to the French dominions (which re-export none of any consequence) to wit, 4,424,336, the subject took a very different aspect from that which had been given to it.  
But there was, Mr. M. observed, a circumstance of the utmost importance to a fair view of this question, which had been wholly overlooked by the gentleman from S. Carolina, and which cut up his calculations by the roots. The re-exportations from G. Britain were not only to be subtracted from the consumption of G. Britain, but in a great degree being made to France, were to be added to the value of her market to the agriculture and commerce of the United States.  
The re-exportations from G. Britain to France, could not be accurately fixed by any documents to be had here. In general, they were known to be great. He would, he said, confine himself to the two articles of Tobacco and Flour, of which he estimated the amounts as follows:  
The Tobacco exported from the United States, appears to be about 100,000 hhds. It is valued in the return of our exports at 4,349,567 dollars. It is known that France consumes about ¼ of the whole quantity exported, that is, 1,087,392 dollars. It appears, by the return of our exports, that the direct exports of this article to France, stands at 384,642 dollars. The indirect supplies

n to France, not appearing in the returns of our exports, and to be added to them, is 702,750 dollars.  
Of the Flour and Grain sent to Great-Britain, allowing, as above stated, ¼ to have been there consumed, which is probably beyond the truth, the re-exportation amounted to 815,880 dollars. It is well understood, that France was the market where these articles were finally consumed. The account may now be stated,

Thus it appears, without taking into the account the other articles re-exported to France, that the market of that country for our exports, was worth to the U. States nearly a million more than the market of Great Britain—and yet the gentleman from South Carolina had represented the British market as exceeding the French in the annual amount of between three and four millions; and had pronounced, without hesitation that G. Britain in reference to our productions, was a more important customer than France, almost in the ratio of two to one.  
Mr. M. returning to the Secretary’s report said, he hoped after what had been shewn, it would be needless to trouble the committee, with further remarks on the subject. In dismissing it however, he could not do justice to his own impressions, without declaring his entire confidence, that the report would be regarded by all discerning and unprejudiced judges, as one of the many monuments which its Author had left behind him, of the zeal, the talents, and the patriotism with which he had discharged the duties of his station; and that he had carried with him into retirement, a purity, both in his public and private name, which nothing that could be said within or without the walls of Congress, could tarnish.  
Having gone thro’ the particular observations into which he had been led by the attack made on the report of the Secretary of State before the committee, he should proceed, to a more general view of what had been urged by the opponents of the resolutions he had introduced.  
Among other things it had been alledged in the latter stages of the debate, that the friends of the resolutions had involved themselves in inconsistency, by shifting the ground of argument from commercial to political considerations. In answer to this charge, he remarked, that if in any instance of his public life he was free from the charge of inconsistency, it was on the subject of vindicating our national interests, against the policy of Great-Britain towards us: that in all the public stations with which he had been honored since the peace, and on every occasion which had occurred, his conduct had been marked by an adherence to this principle: that the resolutions he had last proposed were founded on this principle: that if in the first arguments supporting them, he had dwelt chiefly on commercial topics, it would be recollected that he kept the door open for political ones, if the turn of the discussions should require them: that he had forborne to enlarge on the political sides of the question, because he thought it defensible on commercial grounds, and was willing to meet it on those grounds, because he did not wish to mingle unnecessarily, irritating ideas in the discussion, and because he had supposed that every thing relating to the treaty of peace, the Indians, the Algerines, the spoliations, &amp;c. were sufficiently imprinted on every mind, and would have all the effects they ought to have, without being particularly enforced.  
Whilst he could thus repel the charge of inconsistency brought against himself; it must be evident he thought, how much room there was for retorting the charge. In the early stages of the discussion, there seemed but one sentiment as to the conduct of Great-Britain, at least in a political view; the difference turned on the question, whether we could or ought to counteract her conduct. In the latter stages of the discussion, palliations if not justifications had been multiplied &amp; labored; not only with respect to her commercial policy, but with respect to the detention of the posts, the Indians, the Algerines, and even the spoliations of our neutral commerce; on the unlawfulness of which our executive had grounded the remonstrance and demand of indemnification lying on the table.  
In addition to this, he stated the inconsistency between those who maintained and those who rejected the theory of leaving commerce perfectly free; the inconsistency of rejecting this theory, and yet refusing to meet restrictions on one side, with restrictions on the other; the inconsistency of condemning a commercial discrimination between nations, as contrary to the wise example of Great-Britain, and claiming for Great-Britain the credit of making such discriminations in favor of the United States: The inconsistency of predicting that the measure would destroy the revenue, and insisting that the dutied articles would continue to be imported from the same source, through more expensive channels: The inconsistency of exclaiming against topics and remarks which may awaken the passions, and endeavoring themselves to alarm our fears; of exhorting the committee to consult its judgment alone, and substituting for argument continued addresses to the imagination.  
Particular pains, he remarked, had been taken to exhibit a picture of our national prosperity, which might flatter our wishes, and forbid experiments. It was readily admitted, he said, that there were many features in the face of our affairs, which were proper themes of mutual congratulation, whether compared with the situation of other countries, or with our own, under other circumstances. And it gave him much pleasure to add, that the degree of prosperity we enjoyed, though not to be exclusively credited to the change of our federal government, or to particular measures under it, according to the exaggerations of some, was yet so far, and so evidently the fruit of that change, as to do honor to the people of America in adopting it. He mentioned two innovations making part of the constitution, which must alone, have had a powerful effect in meliorating the condition of this country, to wit: The prohibition of paper money or other violations of contracts, and the abolition of incoherent and rival regulations of trade, among the several states. But notwithstanding the flourishing state of our affairs, when viewed under certain aspects, it was equally certain that there were others, which suggested very different reflexions.  
He then went into a review of the actual state of our commerce, particularly in relation to Great-Britain; and of the several injuries of another sort, which that nation had superadded to her commercial restrictions.  
He repeated what he had formerly maintained, that there was more of reciprocity in the footing of commerce between Great-Britain and other countries, and between other countries and the United States, than between Great-Britain &amp; the United States. To prove the first point he remarked that in some instances Great-Britain had treaties with other countries which defined &amp; stipulated reciprocal privileges; in other instances, her restrictions were countervailed by laws imposing restrictions on her. To prove the second point, he remarked that no other nation with which the United States carried on commerce, had a navigation act similar to that of Great-Britain.  
With respect to the intercourse between the United States and Great-Britain, there was, he insisted, a want of reciprocity throughout, that must strike the most superficial observer.  
In the article of navigation this had been sufficiently pointed out, and being admitted on all sides, need not be repeated.  
In the trade between the two countries, our best staples, wheat and flour, fish and oil, salted provisions, which amount to considerably more than one-third of our exports, were shut out of her markets; whilst all her best staples, her woolens, her cottons, her manufactures of the metals, of leather, and of silk, were admitted on moderate duties, and enjoyed in a manner a monopoly of our market.  
In the articles of superfluity mutually admitted, there was nothing to compensate the inequality in other cases. Our tobacco paid a tax of four or five hundred per cent, our rice fifty or sixty per cent. and our manufactures of every sort would not be admitted if we were ever so able to send them. On the other hand, her superfluities were received under duties, which in general did not exceed from seven and an half to fifteen per cent.  
In the West-India trade, besides the exclusion of our vessels, whilst her own were left free, there were a number of our productions which were not admitted into the market there, whilst our laws refused nothing that was brought to the market here.  
He next turned his attention to the injuries and losses we suffered in other respects.  
As he had not possessed himself of the evidence, he should, he said, leave it to those who had, to shew how far the Indians were or were not spurred on to war against us, by the agents or partisans of Great-Britain. It was a sufficient ground of complaint, that the posts were wrongfully detained; that the detention had a baneful influence on the sentiments and conduct of the Indians; and that the supplies for their warfare, were derived from a trade, authorised by the British government, and protected by the posts which of right were ours, and ought to be used for our defence. He combined this proceeding of Great-Britain, with the lawless seizure of our vessels under her instructions of the 8th of June last, observing, that whilst on one side, she violated the laws of nations, by carrying on a trade in contraband articles with those at war with us; she was on another side, violating the laws of nations, by intercepting our trade with those at war with her, in articles not contraband.  
The Indian war he observed, cost us annually a sum, exceeding by one million, the sum that would probably be sufficient for the defence of our frontier, if the posts were in our hands. The fur trade depending on the posts might, he thought, be fairly valued at two hundred thousand dollars more.  
The Algerine depredations appeared to have proceeded from the steps taken in pursuance of the views of the British government. If they were not immediately pointed against us, it must have been known that our trade would be the victim. The evil therefore may at least be charged to an unfriendly disregard of our interests, if not to a positive hostility to them. The pecuniary amount of this evil, cannot be rated at less than the expence of the armament proposed as a remedy. This is stated at six hundred thousand dollars for the outfit; and he did not expect that the annual expence would average much less; to which may be added, at a very low computation, for insurance remaining after the armament, two hundred thousand dollars.  
The spoliations committed on our neutral commerce by Great-Britain, must be of considerable, though very uncertain amount; and the consequential detriment to our trade in general from these interruptions and dangers, of a very great, though equally uncertain amount. In order to bring both within a safe estimate, he said he would state the former at the limited sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and the latter at no more than four hundred thousand dollars.  
In addition to the foregoing estimates he said there was another item, which, though of a different character, fell under a comprehensive view of our situation; and being reducible to an amount tolerably definite, ought to find a place here. He referred to the statement before quoted from a report of the Secretary of State, which shewed that the loss to the United States from a dependence on British bottoms for the carriage of their produce was no less annually, in time of war than, three million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and in war and peace averaged, no less than one million three hundred ninety-two thousand eight hundred fifty-seven dollars. Allowing about one third of this carriage for the reasonable share of Great-Britain (and for reasons formerly derived from the character of our exports this was a full share) the annual loss from the dependence might be called about one million of dollars.  
These calculations he recapitulated thus:  
  
  
Indian war  
1,000,000  
dollars  
  
  
Fur trade  
200,000  
  
  
  
Algerine depredations  
600,000  
  
  
  
Insurance not reduced by the naval armament  
200,000  
  
  
  
British spoliations  
150,000  
  
  
  
Consequential detriment to our trade  
400,000  
  
  
  
Dependence on British bottoms  
1,000,000  
  
  
  
  
3,550,000  
dollars  
  
  
From this view of things, it was impossible to deny, that however prosperous the U. States might be in some respects, they were in others laboring under violations of their rights and interests, which demanded the serious attention of the legislature. Besides the unreciprocal footing of their commerce, and the indignities offered them, it was seen that they were burdened with an enormous extra expence, and involved in unjust losses, amounting to more than three and a half millions of dollars a year; a tax nearly equal to the heavy one they had been obliged to impose on themselves.  
Having taken this view of our situation, he proceeded to consider how far a remedy was comprised in the resolutions before the committee, by tracing the probable operation of them, if passed into a law. (In this stage of his observations, the hour of adjournment being nearly arrived, he sat down, with an intimation that the subject would be renewed

*4tcoP.  
  
[Whole No. 528.]  
  
Congress of the United States«  
  
House of Representatives.  
January 30.  
In committee of the whole on Mr. Madifun&#x27;s  
  
refulut&#x27;ions,  
  
The following ought to have preceded  
Mr. S, Smith&#x27;s Speech publilhed laffi  
Saturday.  
  
Speech of Mr. Madison.  
AS it appeared, he said, that most of  
the objections against the proposed Reiu­  
iutious. had been made by those who*  
meant to combat them, and that a ouef­  
tion would soon be called for ; it might  
perhaps be expected that he should review  
those objections, arid affijjn the rrafon*  
which induced him to continue in the opi­  
nion lie at firft entertained. He wilhed it  
not to be understood, that he meant to  
examine every particular argument, which  
in thecourfe of fo&#x27;extenfive a difcuflion,  
had been opposed to the measure. The  
committee mud have perceived that some  
of them had been of a nature not to me­  
rit an answer ; and that others had fufß­  
ciently answered themselves. He should  
extend his observations to such topics on­  
ly as might he thought to need explanati­  
on, and to have an influence on the quet  
  
tion,  
  
Previous, however, to this general fur1-  
vey of the ground which had been- tra&gt;  
veiled over, he fliould so far presume on  
the patienee of the committee, as to re­  
cm&#x27; to the original opposition made by  
the member from South Carolina (Mr.  
Smith); and to take notice of some par­  
ticulars in what had been urged by him,  
which were left unanswered at the time.  
  
The gentleman had thought proper to  
introduce his discourse with a very un­  
merited attack on the late Secretary of  
State, and to mingle with it a variety of  
criticisms on the facts and opinions stated  
in his report, on the fubjeft under consi­  
deration. The spirit and manner in  
which the attack had been made, and  
which could not have escaped the atten­  
tion of the committee, would be left in  
that silence which may best express the  
sentiment they must have inspired.  
He (hould indeed have thought it left  
necefiary to take further notice than he  
had already done, of the matter of the  
gentleman&#x27;s remarks ; if attempts&#x27;had not  
been made, particularly by a friend of the  
gentleman (Mr. Am?s) to give a weight  
to his ftatcments aiid Inferences, which it  
would be {hewn they did not merit ; and  
if the task did not afford an opportunity  
of elucidating some particular points relied  
on, by the opponents of the.Resolutions.  
  
It was made a charge against the Secre­  
tary of State, that he takes no notice of  
the higher duty imposed by Great Britain  
on other foreign tobacco, than is imposed  
on American, (the former being 3s. 6d.  
(ler. per pound, the latter is. 3d.) wl.ilft  
he takes care to mention the high duty  
imposed on the American ; although the  
diferimination is in favor of the United  
States, and is againit Portugal, a country  
in particular connexion with Great Bri­  
tain ; and although the high duty of r/3  
is immaterial to the United States, being  
paid by the consumer of tobacco in Great  
Britain.  
  
It was unfortunate for the gentleman  
that this charge is- fallacious in every mem&#x27;  
ber of it.  
  
I. The discrimination is not j&#x27;n favour  
of the United States, either in its inten­  
tion, or in its operation : not in its inten­  
tion, because it was made in reference to  
this country, when it was a part of the  
British Empire, and not in reference to  
us as Independent States j not in its ope­  
ration, because if the discrimination were  
abolished, it would bring no rival of our  
tobacco into the British market. This is  
proved by the fa£t, that ill other markets,  
as that of France, where no such discri­  
mination exiftfr, the American tobacco i«  
without a rival. It was well known that  
this and the other apparent favors to this  
country, were a remnant of the Old Colo

1. If the difcr imitation ha Jno efiTe&amp; in  
f: .-r (.1 the United States, it conld-not,  
si the iame rcalon, be a prejudice to Por­  
tugal. If it were neccflary and proper to  
go into the euquiry» more dircdt proofs  
CtoulJ he give# on thispoint.  
3. High duties do affect the United  
STaU&#x27;S whiclV pioducc the article,&#x27;though  
j&#x27;.niil by the Britifti containers. They  
he a double effect: They leiTcn tlie  
quantity called for; and by leflening the  
competition, they lessen also the price.  
1 ilis wis a truth that could need no com-  
  
rrie.it.  
  
It was to be remarked however, that  
the zeal of the gentl:m«Ti cn this fubjeit  
y. &#x27;s that it had led him to extend  
ti.e fallacy of his reasoning to rice, the  
II • pie article of his own state. This arti­  
c&gt;- &#x27;-&quot;.&#x27;s 1 duty of 7/4 fter. per hundred  
weighty but like the duty on tobacco, be­  
ing pafd by the consumer, was laid to be  
  
oi little concern to us.  
  
vali liie price or rice los ftfcrli ner S the  
  
d.ilv i;  
t!. m G:  
  
\v:ui cannot aiford to eat ric*e at the price  
o» i of, and the class who are willing to eat  
it at 17/4 are prohibited the confu.mption  
by the duty. Wa3 this a circumstance of  
no concern to rhe rice planters ?—The  
gentleman (hould have been reminded of  
his error by It is own arguments.  
  
As an apology for the duty impofedirt  
Great Britain, he tells* us it was meant to  
prevent the use of ric? as a fuhjiitutr, for  
the brea J-ftuffs produce d by Great Britain  
herfelf. Without the preventing duty  
th !i, rice would have b.&#x27;on fuljiltutcd in  
place of wheat, in the opinion of the Bri­  
ti &#x27;i Pirl unent, a;id the demand for it, 111  
the Brit fh market, fa far increased.  
  
As a merit in the Britilh Weft-India  
  
rc-;.!l ; .ions ov-r thofc ot Fiance, it was  
fined by tiie gentleman, that rice in the  
Welt-Indies is a common food ; that in  
the BHtifh, the importation bf it is free,  
in the Fier.ch, subject to a duty* though  
an inconsiderable one. It. Britain th.n,  
W&gt; .re there Is a high duty, rice &quot;s not an  
ni i.ele of common f*&gt;ori *. in the islands  
wnere there is no duty, it is a common  
so »d ; and th? advantage of the British  
vrc &#x27;l I market to us over the French,  
i :, t:\at the duty in the latter favors cheap-  
  
ef fubjiituta  
  
Another proof of the dlfpofition of  
G,cat-Britain to favor the United States  
in tie Weft-India market, is the prohibi­  
tiijn of al! fbroi rice but the American.  
The fame remark may be repeated here,  
wli vh was applied to the discrimination in  
t.nvor of our tobacco. It is an oldcoloi:y  
re atioo that has no effeil whatever.  
What other foreign rice couid be brought  
to the Weft-Indies ? Is it the East India  
lie ■ ; That is prohibited by its dil&#x27;rance.  
Is it the liee oi Portugal ? That is prohi­  
!&lt;:.&#x27;«! by the laws of Portugal, and proba­  
bly also by the lower price e£ the Carolina  
rice.  
  
The inference which the gentleman had  
d iwr.j&#x27;Yoni the comparative regulations of  
Great Britain and Fiance on the fubjeft of  
rice was so curious that it was worth a  
moment&#x27;s attention.  
  
The fdtfts Mr. M. observed, stood thus.  
In France the duty is 1-8 per cent. In  
the French iflandt the duty is 1 percent.  
In the British free with a prohibition of  
other foreign rice.  
  
As the duty of 1 per cent, is scarcely  
and the prohibition, as (hewn, is  
merely nominal, the inequality in the  
illands may be regarded as too immaterial  
to affe&amp; the cotnparifon.  
  
Pal Ting to the two prcfent states, the  
duty in France is 1-8 per cent.—The du­  
ty in Great Britain, 50 or 60 percent.  
Here then is nearly an equality in one  
pait, and a difference of 50 or 60 per  
ceot. in the other part of the two domini­  
ons ; and yet the gentleman could fay,   
vus not easy to pronounce, whether the  
article of rice Hands on a better footing  
in the system of one, than in the system  
of the other.  
  
An&#x27;rther charge ngainft the Secretary  
of State is, that his report calls the discri­  
minating duties in Great Britain in favor  
&lt;&gt;t American wood, small, whereas thev  
;.re confiderabie, and iu several inllances,

Congress of the United States*  
  
House of Reprefentativet.  
January 30.  
  
In committee of the whole on Mr. Madison*  
resolutions.  
  
Speech of Mr. Madtfan.  
[continued.]  
  
Another charge again ft the Secretary  
€&gt;f State is, that his report calls the difcri­  
rtiinatirrg duties in Great Britain hi favor  
of American woody small, whereas they  
are considerable* and in fbveral in fiances,  
high.  
  
Mr. M. said he had not found Jeifure to  
trace this branch of our exports into alt  
the details neeeflarv to decide in what de­  
gree the duties were small or confidcrable,  
and in what proportion the several dutied  
articles went to Great Britain. He ob­  
served in general that the greater part of  
our woods were exported to the Weft-In­  
dics, not to Great Britain. That in the  
(hip-woods, at least the Baltic nations wertf  
not iivali to the United States. It wa*  
known thai Sweden and Denmark were  
so deficient in oak, that their public navies­  
were supplied from Germany, and that  
the (hip timbers of Ruflia were tjanfporu  
ed a thousand or twelve hundred miles from  
her interior dominions. The fir, of which  
the Swedi(h and Dani(h merchant ship*  
were built, does not lad more than feverc  
or eight years, and could not therefore  
be a rival to the durable wood* of the  
nited States*  
  
He observed also ffiat timber, and par­  
ticularly the (hip woods of this country,  
were so precious and so sure of being iiv  
demand, that they never could fear a ri­  
val, or need a foreign bounty. This was  
an article very different from such as were  
an annual product of the earth: and as  
could be raised wherever the climate and  
foil permited, according to the occasional  
demand. The forefts that were to sup­  
ply the /hip-yards were the growth of  
centuries, and where once destroyed, as  
they generally are in Europe, are rarely­  
replaced at aslr and never can become the  
rival to America, which enjoys them a»  
the spontaneous gift of nature.  
To enhance the merit of the Briu&#x27;fh  
regulation, the gentleman had told us,  
that wood was fubjeft to a duty of i per  
cent, in the French I (lands, and in the  
Britilh free, with a prohibition of other  
foreign wood. This was of little conse­  
quence. The duty was a trifle, and fal­  
ling on a ncccfTary article to be got no­  
where else, probably was paid by the  
French I(landers. And the prohibitionl  
was ideal, the American wood being the  
only resource for the Britifti market.  
  
The article of Fish, was admitted by  
the gentleman himfelf, to be more favor­  
ed&#x27; by the French than the British fyflem,  
though he admits it with relu&amp;ance and  
diminishes the difference as much as pos­  
sible. The cafe however is so clear, and  
the facts so palpable, that they speak for&#x27;  
ihemfelves. Under the French regulati­  
ons, this important article of our com­  
merce, is fubjeft to duties onlyrin Europe  
and the Weft-Indies. Under the British,  
it is under prohibition in both. The a­  
mount of the whole exports is 383,237  
quintals of dry, and 57,424 bands of  
picklcd fifTi. Of this the French eonfump­  
tion, is 2 2,1&quot; 1 quintals and 45* 164 bar­  
rels ; that is, nearly § of the dry, and 4-e  
of the pickled fifh.  
  
Here Mr. M. proceeding to the fubjeft  
of whale oil, called the attention of the  
committee particularly to the representa­  
tion and language of Mr. Smith as to the  
the conduit of France, in inviting the fifh­  
ermen of Nantucket to remove and fet­  
tle at Dunkirk. Mr. Smith, he fold, had  
not only undervalued the monopoly of  
the French market granted to-the United  
States, but had, by a mutilated quotation  
of a report of the secretary of State on the  
fi(heries, changed the true afpeft of the at­  
tempt to draw away the- Nantucket fifli­  
ermen. The faS was, that although- tfce

what was to have been wished, as well as

prujeft of tempting tht ro to emigrate had  
  
origina ed in Gtvat-I&#x27;.ritain, and was a  
counUr-prujcC on the part of France. How  
ttw happened to omit the an­  
tecedent attempt of Great-Britain, and  
thereby exaggerate that of France, Mr.  
M. did not undertake to explain : but it  
wjs the more extiaoidir.ary, at. the whole  
acixmnt of the tranfaclion was contained  
in the fame page of the report, nay in the  
fame paragraph, from which the gentle­  
man hrfd extracted &quot;his information.

A further charge again (I the Secretaiy  
of St*te is, that in his flattmeut of the  
tonnage of the United States employed  
in tn.Atrade with the French and Bntilh  
dominions, he founded it,net on the aSual  
number of Jbift, but on the number of en­  
tries. This charge was as lingular as it  
was uncandid.  
  
The re-port Hated the fad, that the A­  
mencan ton nage mitring our ports from  
the several nations with which the United  
loded, was so and so; and in this  
ilaumcat, it pursued the official returns  
made or. the fubjeft. What more was to  
be required ?  
  
In giving the tact, the secretary irr.pof­  
ed «.;i no one, because he Hated the ton­  
ua 0 to be entry tonnage, as it really  
  
He followed the best guide that ex -  
illrd, an official icturn from the proper  
  
No return of the aftuai tonnage, as dif-  
from the entry tonnage, had  
at the time, ever been made from any of­  
fice, or ca&#x27;ied tor by any act of Con­  
gress.  
  
The firft return ever made In the latter  
form, was called for tince the refolutious  
on the table were proposed.  
  
TKeleconfideratichsmigh? have re ft rain­  
ed the gentleman from this unwarrant­  
ed attack on the accuracy of ths report.  
  
Bui he ought at leatf to have been lure,  
th \ whftft h * was charging the Secretary  
  
\*;&#x27;:i following an erroneous guide, he  
\ t him ft If following one that was noter­

i&quot; Ived facts which iperited the particu-

the V M.&#x27;ted States in foreign trade for I 792  
lately called for and reported, 15415,331  
  
t. -&#x27;W.  
  
for the fame year is 289,394 toHs.  
  
On comparing t&#x27;nefe two quantities, it  
was evident that both could not be right.  
If the entry tonnage was no more than  
was (lated, it was inconceivable that the  
afiual tonnage could be as much as was  
ftp.ud. It would allow the veflels in the  
Kuropean and Weft India trades together  
but (omcwhat more than one voyage and  
a third a year. It could never l»e suppos­  
ed, thai this corresponded with the fa&amp;.  
liow then was the inconsistency in the  
two ftatemcnts to be explained ?  
  
Mr. M. said, as he did not know by  
what rule the achial tonnage was made  
up, he would form no cor.jedhire on the  
fhl ject. He hoped,and wished that some  
gcn&#x27;leman more conversant with it, Would  
{llvc the phenonenoon. He did not call  
011 the gentleman from South Carolina,be­  
cause he moll of all, must he puzzled to  
account for it ; having stated that onr ves­  
sels in the trade to Europe make two voy­  
ages, and in the Weft India trade four  
voyages a year.  
  
Betides the evidence contained in this  
companion of the aggregate tonnage in  
the two different forms, in which it had  
heen reported,the exiitence of error some­  
where, and probably in the acconnt of  
the a&amp;ual tonnage resulted from a compa­  
rative view of our exports to the British  
dominions, for the two years of 1790  
and 1792, and of the whole tonnage A­  
rr - itHn and British employed in convey­  
%  
  
ing titCßi*  
  
In the former year the exports were  
f,363,416 dollars. Intlirlatter 8,269,495  
dollars; the txceft for 1790, 1,093,921  
iuflars.  
  
Tlie entry tonnage, British and Ame­  
rican for 1790, was 272,580 tons.  
  
The British miry tonnage for 1792.  
was 206, $84 tons. The aßual American  
to-&gt;n&quot;VT&lt; for 1792, was according to t&lt;ie  
official llateir.cnt, 66,581 tons; which  
  
turned into entry tonnage, according to  
the proportion of the whole actual, to  
the whole enti-y tonnage for that year,  
mikes the American entry tonnage, in  
the trade to Great Britain about 95,000  
  
tons.  
  
Adding this to the Britilh entry ton­  
nagt of 296,384 tor:3&gt; the Britilh and  
American together for 1792, amounts to  
301,384 tons ; which exceeds the ton­  
nage of 1790 no lcfs thai&gt; 27,804 tons.  
  
According to this calculation, which  
embraces the actual tonnr.gc as ltated to  
die house, there would be 27,804 tons  
more,employed in tranfpoiting 1,193,921  
dollars Ids; making our tonnage to in­  
crease in that proportion as the employ­  
ment of itdecrcafed.  
  
There was a pollibflity, Mr. M. ob­  
fened, that the course of trade in the  
two years, might be such that more of  
the vessels employed in the expertations  
to Great Britain might be entered in 1790  
as coming from some other country, than  
in 1792 i but as there was no knov.n cir­  
cumftar.ee which authorized this folutior,  
and as it seemed denionltiable in general,  
that error existed somewhere in the flate­  
ments, and molt probably in thofc of the  
actual tonnage, he concluded that it ought  
to be referred to that source ; and confe­  
qnently, that the guide followed by the  
Secretary- of State, to wit, the entry  
tonnage, the only one he had to follow,  
was not more inaccurate, than the a&lt;stual  
tonnage would have been, which guided  
the member from South Carolina.  
  
Another position of the Secretary of  
State on which a charge is founded, is,  
&quot; that the greater part of what Great  
Britain receives from the United States is  
re-exported.&quot; This, polition, Mr. M.  
reminded the committee, related to Great  
Britain without comprehending the Weft  
India iflanda, which formed a diltinCt  
branch in the Secretary3! report. How  
far it was liable to the exceptions taken  
againlt it, would appear from an exami­  
tion of facts.  
  
To obviate critieifms, Mr. M. said he  
would take for The baiis of his calcula­  
tions, the ilatement given in detail by the  
gentleman himfelf, of the exports for  
1790, to the -French and British domi­  
nions ; which though not&#x27; extended to  
every item, approached so near to a fuOl  
view of the tiade, as to be adequate to  
the purpose.  
  
In this ftatcment the exports to Great  
Britain (land at dollars j from  
which must be iubtra&amp;eu, for the compa­  
rison, the amount of the fcveral re-exper­  
tations as far as they can be liquidated.  
  
Tobacco. It appears from an official  
document, that the tobacco exported to  
Gteat Britain in 1791, was 67,216 hogs­  
heads. A return for another year Hates  
the quantity to be 52,505 hogsheads. It  
appeared from the revenue returns of  
Great Britain, that the consumption of  
this article amounted to 9,600 hogsheads.  
The proportion re-exported might then  
be reafpnably set down at four-fifths of the  
quantity imj&gt;orted.  
  
Rice. To obtain the proportion of  
rice re-exported, we may take the medi­  
um quantity imported for three years,  
immediately preceding the revolution,  
which, accordingly to a table in Ander­  
fon&#x27;s Hiflory of Commerce, was 486,543  
cwt. By another table for the fame pe­  
riod, the medium quantity exported was  
349,653 cwt. Tbe difference marks the  
confamption, and is 136,890 cwt. The  
quantity exported to Great Britain from  
the United States in 1792, was 58,978  
barrels, equal to 294,890 cwt. Compar­  
ing the quantity consumed with this quan­  
tity, it appears that more than half, tho&#x27;  
less than two thirds, is re-exported—call  
the re-exportation one half only qf the  
present importation.  
  
Indigo. According to a statement in  
Anderi&#x27;on, the medium importations into  
Greal-Britain, for three years immedi­  
diately preceding the revolution, were a­  
bout thrice the medium quantity re-ex­  
portei&#x27;. Call the proportion re-exported  
now, however, one-fifth only, which it  
probably below the faA.  
  
From these proportions, and the data  
furnilhed by the gentleman&#x27;s own state­  
ments, results the following juftification  
of the report of the Secretary on this  
point.  
  
Dollars.  
Exports to Great Britain 6,651,429  
  
Dollars.  
Tobacco 2,754,493

Britain, in the two  
succeeding years, tho&#x27;  
the aggregate exports  
thither were left than  
in the year here ta­  
ken : Say, however,  
that one fourth was  
consumed, and let the

Here, then, it appears, that the re-ex­  
portations of the four articles alone, of  
Tobacco, Rice, Indigo and Wheat, are  
greater than the wlu&gt;le confuroption in  
Great Britain, of the articles imported  
from the United States, although the  
most unfavorable year has been taken, for  
the enquiry ; and, consequently, that the  
position of the Secretary of State, was  
well founded.

If it were neoeflary to investigate the  
full amount of re-exportations, several ar­  
ticles might have been added to the lift,  
such as Whale-Oil, Ginseng, Flax-Seed,  
&amp;c.  
  
Nor would it be unfair, perhaps, to in­  
clude the primitive value of the articles,  
re-exported in the new forms given to  
them by art. A great proportion of what  
is sent from the United States to Great-  
Britain, in a rude state, it worked into  
articles of merchandize, and exported in  
the course of trade. Take, for example,  
the two articles of Pot and Pearl A (lies,  
and Indigo.  
  
The amount of the «xport of the form­  
er to Great-Britain, is Hated at 747,078  
dollars ; of which, if no part is re-export­  
ed in its unaltered state, the whole enters  
into British manufa&amp;ures. Supposing one  
third of these particular manufa&amp;ures, to  
be exported which appears to be nearly  
the general proportion, the value of Pot  
and Pearl Afties re-exported, is 249,026  
dollars.  
  
The indigo used in Great Britain has  
appeared to be 379,064 dollars. One  
third of which re-exported as an ingredi­  
ent in manufactures, is 126,254 1-2 dol­  
lars. These two items alone amount to  
375&#x27;350 2&quot;3 dollars,and with many others  
might be added to the mass of re-expor­  
tations. But they are stated rather to  
throw light on the general chara&amp;er of  
our trade with Great Britain, than to be  
relied on in the present cafe, which has  
been fufficiently elucidated by more direst  
and simple views of it.  
  
Mr. M. proceeded to apply the cal­  
culations he had made, to the question  
discussed by Mr. Smith, in relation to the  
comparative importance of the French and  
Britifti matkets to the productions of the  
United States.  
  
By deducting the 3,501,067 dollars, re­  
exported, from the 6,651,429 dollars, im­  
ported into Great Britain, he reduced her  
actual consumption to 3,150,362 dollars,  
to which adding the 1,805,744 exported  
to the Weft-India market, the whole Bri­  
tish consumption Hands at no more than  
4&gt;9j6,106 dollars. On comparing this  
with the exports to the French dominions  
(who re-export none of any consequence)  
to wit, 4,424,336, the fubjift took a ve­  
ry different aspect from that which h?d  
been given to it.  
  
But there was, Mr. M. observed, a cir­  
cumstance of the utmost importance to a  
fair view of this question, which had been  
wholly overlooked by the gentleman from  
Scuth-Carolina, and which cut up his cal­  
culations by the roots.  
The re-exportations from G. Britain,  
were not only to be fubt rafted from the  
consumption of G. Britain, but in a great  
degree being made to France, were to he  
added to the value of her market to the a -  
griculture and commerce of the United  
  
States  
  
The re-exportations from G. Britain to  
  
France, could not be accurately fixed bv  
- any documents to be had here. In gene­  
ra!, they were known to be great. Jie  
would, he said, confine himfelf ro the  
two articles of Tobacco and Flour, of  
which he estimated the amounts as fol­  
lows :  
  
The tobacco exported from the United  
States, appears to be about loc.ooo  
hhds. It is valued in the return of our  
  
exports at 4,349,567 dollars.  
  
It is known that France consumes about  
1-4 of the whole quantity exported, that  
is, 1,087.392 dollars. It appears, by the  
return of our exports, that the dired ex­  
ports of this article to France, -(lands at  
3 8+.641 dollars. The indirect fupplios

Km Lc Fiance, not appealing in the re­  
turn* of oar exports, and tu be added to  
them, is 702,750dollars.  
  
Of the Flour sad Grain feat to Great-  
Britain, ailovriug, as above stated, 1-4 to  
have been there coaltuaed, which is pro­  
bably beyond the tcuLh, the re-exporta­  
tion amounted tu 81 £,880 dollars. It is  
well uuLi.tuod, that France v is the mar­  
ket where these articles were finally con­  
fwned. The acconnt may now be liated.

Thus it appears, without taking into  
the account the other articles re-exported  
to France, thit the market of that coun­  
try for our exports, was worth to the U­  
nited States nearly a million more than  
the market of Great Britain, and yet the  
gentleman from South Carolina had re­  
presented the Britifli market as exceeding  
the French in the annual amount of be­  
tween three and four millions ; and hod  
pronounced, without hesitation that G.  
Britain in reference to our productions,  
was a more important cujlomer than France  
almoil in the ratio of tivo to one.  
  
Mr. M. returning to the Secretary&#x27;s  
report said, he hoped after what had  
been (he\vn, it would be needless to trou­  
ble the committee, with further remarks  
on thi InbjeCt. In dismissing it however,  
he could not do justice to his own im­  
prelTijns, without declaring his entire con­  
fidence, that the report would be regard­  
ed by ail difceroing and unprejudiced jud­  
ges, as one of the many monuments  
which its author had left behind him, of  
the zeal, the talents, and the patriot ism  
with which he had dilcharged the duties  
of his ftstion j and that he bad carried  
with him into retirement, a purity, both  
in his public and private name, which no­  
.thing that could be (aid within or without  
the walls of Cougrefs, could tarnilh.  
  
Having gone thro&#x27; the particular ob­  
servations into which he had been led by  
the attack made on the report of the Se­  
cretary of State before the committee, he  
(hould procceed to a more general view of  
what had been urged by the opponents of  
the resolutions he had introduced.  
  
Among other things it had been alledg­  
ed in the latter stage of the debate, that  
the friends of the resolutions had involved  
themselves in inconsistency, by Ihifting the  
ground of argument from commercial to  
political ronfiderations. In answer to this  
charge, he remarked, that if in any in­  
stance of his public life he was free from  
the charge of inconsistency, it was on the  
fubjeSt of vindicating our national inter­  
ests, against the policy of Great Britain  
towards us : that in all the public stations  
with which he had been honored since the  
peace, and on every occasion which had  
occurred, his conduct had been marked  
by an adherence to this principle : that if  
in the firft arguments he  
had dwelt chiefly on commercial topics,  
it would be recollected that he kept tjiti  
door open for political ones, if the turn of  
the difcuflions require them : that  
he had forborne to enlarge on the political  
fides of the question, because he thought  
it defenfible on commercial grounds, and  
was willing to meet it on those grounds,  
because he did not with to mingle unne­  
ceflarily, irritating ideas in the difcuflion,  
and because he had supposed that every  
thing relating to the tieaty of peace, the  
Indians, the Algerines, the spoliations  
&amp;c. were fufficiently imprinted on every  
mind, and would have all the rffefts they  
ought to have, without being particular­  
ly enforced.  
Whilst he could thus repel the charge  
of inconsistency brought against himfelf;  
it mull be evident he thought, how much  
room there was for retorting the charge.  
In the early stages of the difcuflion,there  
seemed but one sentiment as to the cori­  
duft of Great Britain, at least in a politi­  
cal view; the difference turned on the  
question, whether we could or ought to  
counteract her condud. In the latter  
stages of the difcuflion, palliations if not  
j unifications had been multiplied and la­  
bored ; not only with refpeft to her com­  
mercial poKcy, but with refpefl to. the  
detention of the polls, the Indians, the  
Algerines, and even the spoliations &lt;jf our  
  
ventral commerce ; on the u*lawfulnef»  
of which -our executive lad grounded the  
remonii ranee and demand of iwdetnuilica­  
tion lyiug on the table.  
in addition to tins, he stated the in­  
consistency between tnofe who maintained  
andthoie who reje&amp;eil the theory of leav­  
ing commerce yerfe£Uy free; the iucon-  
Cftency of rejecting this theory, and yet  
refilling to meet rellri&amp;ions on one fide,  
with re&amp;ri&amp;ionson the other : the rocon­  
filtency of condemning a cummercikl dis­  
crimination between nations, as contrary  
to the wife example of &lt;G. Britain, and  
claiming for G. Britain the credit ofmak­  
iug such discriminations in favor of the  
United States: The inconfittcncy of pre­  
dicting that the measure would dellroy the  
revenue, and infilling that the dutied arti­  
cles would continue to be imported from  
the lame source thro&#x27; more expenfivechan­  
nels : The inconliftency of exclaiming a­  
gainst topics and remarks which may a­  
waken the paflions, and endeavonring  
themselves to alarm our fears; of exhort­  
ing the committee to consult its judgment  
alone, and substituting for argument con­  
tinued addreflesto the imagination.

Partigular pains, he remarked,had been  
taken tu exhibit a picture of our nation­  
al prosperity, which might flatter our  
withes, and forbid experiments. It was  
readily admitted, he said, that there were  
many features in the face of our affairs,  
which were proper themes of mutual con­  
gratulation, whether compared with the  
fttuation of other countries, or with our  
own, under other circumstances. And  
it gave him much pieafure to add, that  
the degree of prosperity we enjoyed, tho&#x27;  
not to be exclusively credited to the  
change of our federal government, or to  
particular measures under it, according to  
the exaggerations of some, wss yet so  
far, and so evidently the fruit of that  
change, as to do honor to the people of  
Amenca in adopting it. He mentioned  
two innovations making part of the con­  
stitution, which must alone, have had a  
powerful effefi in meliorating the condi­  
tion of this country, to wit: The prohi­  
bition of paper money or other violations  
of contra£ts, and the abolition of inco­  
herent and rival regulations of trade,amang  
the several states. But notwithstanding  
the flourilhing state of our affairs, when  
viewed under certain aspeCts, if was equal­  
ly certain that there were others, which  
suggested very different reflections.

HE then went into a review of the  
a&amp;ual Hate of our commerce, particular­  
ly in relation to Great Britain ; and of  
the several injuries of another fort, which  
that nation had fuperadded to her com­  
mercial reftri&amp;ions.  
  
He repeated w&#x27;.iat hp had formerly  
maiutaihed, that there was more of reci­  
procity in the footing of commerce be­  
tween Great Britain and other countries,  
and between other countries and the Uni­  
ted States. To prove the firft point he  
remarked that in some instances G. Bri­  
tain had treaties with other countries  
which defined and stipulated reciprocal  
privileges ; in other instances, her restric­  
tions were counter-vailed by laws impos­  
ing reftri&amp;ions on her. To prove the se­  
cond point, he remarked that no other na­  
tion, with which the United States carried  
on commerce, had a navigation adl limi­  
lar to that of Great Britain.  
  
With refpeft to the intercourfc be­  
tween the United States and Great Bri­  
tain, there was, he infilled, a want of re­  
ciprocity throughout, that mult strike  
the mod fuperfieial observer.  
  
In the article of navigation this had  
been fufficiently pointed out, and being  
admitted on all lides, need not be repeat­  
ed.  
  
In the trade between the two countries,  
our belt llaples, wheat and flour, fi(h and  
oil, &amp; salted provisions, whichamo unt to  
considerably more than one third of our  
exports, were (hut out of her markets ;  
whilst all her staples, her woolens, her  
cotton-., her manufactures of the metals,  
of leather, and of silk, were admitted on  
moderate duties, and enjoyed in a man­  
ner a monopoly of our market.  
  
In the articles of fuperfluity mutually  
admitted, there was nothing to compen­  
sate the inequality in other cases. Our  
tobacco paid a tax of 4or 500 per cent,  
our rice 53 or 60 per cent, and our manu­  
factures of every fort would not be admit­  
ted if we were ever so able to fend them.  
On the other hind, her fuperfluities were  
received under duties, which in general  
did not exceed from leven and an half to  
fifteen per eent.  
  
In the Well India trade, besides the  
exclusion of our veflels, whild her own  
were left free, there were a number of our  
productions which were not admitted in­  
to the market there, whilit our laws re­  
fufed nothing that wasbrought to the mar­  
ket here.  
  
He next turned his attention to the in­  
juries and losses we fuffered in other ref­  
peits.  
  
As he had not poflefled himfelf of the  
evidence, he should, he said, leave it to  
those who had, to shew how far the Indi­  
ans were or were not spurred on to war a­  
gainll us, by the agents or partisans of G.  
Britain. It was a fufficient ground of  
complaint, that the polls were wrongful­  
ly detained ; that the detention had a  
baneful influence on the sentiments and  
conduft,of the Indians ; and that the sup­  
plies for their warfare, were derived from  
a trade, authorised by the British govern­  
ment, and protected by the polls which of  
right were ours, and ought to be used for  
our defence.  
  
He combined this proceeding of G.  
Britain, with the lawless feizuie of our  
▼effek under her inftru&amp;ioni of the Bth  
of June last, observing, that whilst on  
one fide (he violated the laws of rations,&quot;  
  
by cairying on a trade in contraband arti­  
cles with those at war with us j (he was  
on another fide, violating the laws of na­  
tions, by intercepting our trade with those  
at war with her, in articles not contra­  
band.  
  
The Indian war he observed, co.l us  
annually a sum, exceeding by one million,  
the sum that would probably be fufficient  
for the defence of our frontier, if the  
ports were in our hands. The fur trade  
Spending on the poits might, he tho&#x27;t,  
be fairly valued at two hundred thousand  
dollars mote.  
  
The Algerine depreditions appeared to  
have proceeded from the steps taken in pur­  
suance of the views of the British govern­  
ment. If they were not immediately  
pointed againtt us, it must have been  
known that our trade would be the vic­  
tim. The evil therefore may at lead be  
charged to an unfriendly dil&#x27;regard of our  
interests, if not a poiitive hollility to  
them. The pecuniary amount of this  
eTil, cannot be rated at less than the ex­  
pence of the armament proposed as a re­  
medy. This is itated at 600,000 dollars  
for the outfit ; and he did not expect that  
the annual expence would average much  
less; to which may be added, at a very  
low computation, for insurance remaining  
after the armament, 200,000 dollars.  
  
The spoliations committed on our neu­  
tral commerce by Great Britain, mull be  
of considerable. though very uncertain a­  
mount ; and the consequential detriment  
to our trade in general from these inter­  
ruptions and dangers, of a very great,  
though equally uncertain amount.  
  
In order to bring both within a fafe es­  
timate, he said he would state the former  
at the limited film of 150,000 dollars,and  
the latter at no more than 400,000 dol­  
lars.  
  
In addition to the foregoing ellimates,  
he said there was another item, which,  
though of a different chara&amp;er, fell under  
a comprehensive view of our situation ;  
and being reducible to an amount tolera­  
bly definite, ought to find a place here.  
He referred to the flatement before quot­  
ed from a report of the Secretary of (late  
which (hewed that the loss to the United  
States from a dependence on Briti(h bot­  
toms for the carriage of their produce  
was no less annually, in time of war than  
3,250,000 dollars, and in war and peace  
averaged, no less than 1,392,857 dollars.  
Allowing about one tht&#x27;rd of this carriage  
for the reasonable (hare of Great Britain  
(and for reasons formerly derived from  
the character of our exports this was a  
full (hare) the annual loss from the depen­  
dence might be called about one million  
of dollars.  
  
These calculations he recapitulated  
thus : Dollars.  
Indian war 1,000,000  
Fuit trade  
  
Algerine depredations  
  
Insurance not reduced by the  
naval armament  
British spoliations  
Consequential detriment to  
our trade  
Dependence on British bot­  
tom» 0 1,000,000  
  
Total 3,550,000  
  
From this view of things, it was impos­  
sible to deny, that however prosperous the  
United States might be in some refpe&amp;s..  
they were in others laboring under viola­  
tions of their rights and interests, which  
demanded the serious attention of the Le­  
gislature. Besides the unreciprocal foot­  
ing of their commerce, and the indignities  
offered them, it was seen that they were  
burdened with an enormous extra expence,  
and involved in unjust lodes, amounting to  
more than three and a half millions of dol­  
lars in a year ; a tax nearly equal to the  
heavy one they had been obliged to im­  
pose on themselves.  
  
Having taken this view of our situation,  
he proceeded to consider how far a reme­  
dy wascomprifed in the resolutions before  
the committee, by tracing the probable  
operation of them, if parted into a law.  
[In this stage of his observations, the hour  
of adjournment being nearly arrived, he fat  
down, with an intimation that the fubjecft  
would be renewed.

Great Brit,,in had treaties with other!  
count! | and stipe  
&#x27; rocal privileges ; in other iost.in- )  
wore countervailed  
log restrictions on her.  
To prpve d point, he remark­  
ed, that «o »ther nation with which the  
U.S. carried on commerce, had a na­  
vigation act similar to that of Great  
Britain.  
With respect to the intercourse be­

, Was, he insisted, a want of recipe

I nufactures ol&#x27; the m&lt; tals, of leather, sod  
jof silk, were admitted on moderate du­  
j ties, and enjoyed in a manner amoi  
j ly of our market.  
In the articles of superfluity mutually  
I admitted, there was nothing tocompen­

I per COnt, and &lt; or in an n fact ores of every  
sort would not be admitted it we  
everso able to send them. On the other  
i hand, her superfluities were received  
J under ditties, which in general did not  
j exceed from seven and au hilf to-fifveeh  
percent.  
In the West rndia trade, besides the i  
exclusion of ..or vessels, whilst her ewh |

“ He then went into n review of the ac­  
tual state of rur c,t u mere*, prrticui&#x27; i lv in  
relation to Gnat Britain ; andot die seve­  
ral injuries of another sort, which that rm­  
tion had superadded tuhet commercial res­  
trictions.  
He repeated whathe.had formerly mr*in­  
tnined, that there was more of rcri*pr&gt;&lt;citr  
in the footing ot commerce between Great  
Britain .and other countries. • and between  
j other countries and the U S than between  
: Great Britain and die U S. To prove tlie  
! first point he remarked, that in some in­  
stances Great Hr tain h id treaties with o­  
thcr countries which defined and stipula­  
ted reciprocal privileges ; in other instan­  
ces, her restrictions were countervailed  
by laws imposing restrictions on her. To  
prove the second point, he remarked, that  
no other nation with which the U. S. car­  
ried on commerce, had a navigation act si­  
milar to that ot Great Britain.  
With respect to the intercourse between  
the U. S. and G. Britain, there was, he in­  
sisted, a want of reciprocity throughout,  
that mutt strike the most sup’ei licial obser­  
ver.  
In the article of navigation this had  
been sufficiently pointed out, and being  
admitted on all sides ne* d no* -e ie e ted.  
In the trade between the two countries,  
our best staples, wheat and flour, fish ..ml  
oil, salted provisions, which am* unt to con­  
siderable moie than one third of our ex­  
ports, were shut out ot her markets ; w hi st  
all her best staples, her woollens, heV cot­  
tons, her manufactures of the metais, of  
leather, and of silk, were admitted on mo­  
derate duties, and enjoyed in a manner a  
monopoly of our market.  
. In the articles cf superfluity mutually ad­  
I mitted, there was naming to compensate  
  
the inequality in other eases. Our tobacco  
p lid a tax of lour or five hundred per cent,  
ur nee S iy or sixty per cent, ar.&#x27;i our ma­  
nufactures of. every sort Would not be ad­  
mitted! T7- i ere ever soablc to sendthem.  
On the other hand, her superfluities were  
received under duties, which iu general  
did not exceed from seven and an half t.i  
fifteen per cent.  
In tiio West India trade, besides tUe ex­  
c U&#x27;-oti cl .or it ssels, wlnst lier own wciu  
!e t free, t .?k* were a number ot* our pro­  
ductions v. iiich wtre not admitted into the  
market? there, whilst our lavs refused no­  
thing that was oi tni lit to rhe marl.Lt here.  
He next turned his attention to the in­  
juries and losses we suffered in other res­  
pects.  
As he had not possessed himself of the  
evidence, he should, ne said, leave it to  
those who had, to shew how far the Indians  
were or were not spurted on tow ir against  
us, by Mu agents or partisans oi Great Bri­  
tain. It was a sufficient gr und of com­  
plaint, that the posts wire wrongfully de­  
tained ; that the deumti«’:i had a baneful  
influence on the sentiments and c.nhduct o»  
the Indians ; and that the supplies for  
their warfare, were derived from a tr.ule,  
authorised by the British gurtriuuent, and  
protected by the posts whichof right were  
ours, and ought to he used for our (It fence,  
lit combined this proceeding or (j Britain,
