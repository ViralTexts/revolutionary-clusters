On the other hand, I am never satiated with rambling through the fields and farms, examining the culture and cultivators, with a degree of curiosity which makes some take me to be a fool, and others to be much wiser than I am.  I have been pleased to find among the people a less degree of physical misery than I had expected. They are generally well clothed, and have a plenty of food, not animal indeed, but vegetable, which is as wholesome. Perhaps they are over worked, the excess of the rent required by the landlord, obliging them to too many hours of labor, in order to produce that, and wherewith to feed and clothe themselves. The soil of Champagne and Burgundy I have found more universally good than I had expected, and as I could not help making a comparison with England, I found that comparison more unfavorable to the latter than is generally admitted. The soil, the climate, and the productions are superior to those of England, and the husbandry as good, except in one point; that of manure. In England, l

It is a pleasure you have to come, and an improvement to be added to the many you have already made. It will be a great comfort to [you to know, from your own inspection, the condition of all the provinces of your own country, and it will be interesting to them at some future day to be known to you. This is perhaps the only moment of your life in which you can acquire that knolege. And to do it most effectually you must be absolutely incognito, you must ferret the people out of their hovels as I have done, look into their kettles, eat their bread, loll on their beds under pretence of resting yourself, but in fact to find if they are soft. You will feel a sublime pleasure in the course of this investigation, and a sublimer one hereafter when you shall be able to apply your knolege to the softening of their beds, or the throwing a morsel of meat into the kettle of vegetables. You will not wonder at the subjects of my letter: they are the only ones which have been present to my mind for some time

great comfort to you to know, from your own inspection,  
the condition of all the provinces of your own country, and  
it will be interesting to them at some future day, to be  
known to you. This is perhaps the only moment of your  
life in which you can acquire that knowledge. And to do  
it most effectually you must be absolutely incognito; you  
must ferret the people out of their hovels as I have done,  
look into their kettles, eat their bread, loll on their beds  
under pretence of resting yourself, but in fact to find  
if they are soft. You will feel a sublime pleasure in the  
course of this investigation, and a sublimer one hereafter,  
when you shall be able to apply your knowledge to the  
softening of their beds or the throwing a morsel of meat  
into their kettle of vegetables.”
