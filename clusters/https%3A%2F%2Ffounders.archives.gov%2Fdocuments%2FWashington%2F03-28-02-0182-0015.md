Greyhound Schooner Flag of TruceDobbs Ferry [NY.] October 2d 1780  
Sir,  
  
A Note I have from General Green leaves me in doubt if his Memory had Served him to relate to you with Exactness the Substance of the Conversation that had passed between him &amp; myself on the Subject of Major Andrè. In an Affair of so much Consequence to my Friend, to the two Armies, and Humanity, I would leave no Possibility of a Misunderstanding and therefore take the Liberty to put in writing the Substance of what I said to Genl Green.  
I offered to prove by the Evidence of Colonel Robinson and the Officers of the Vulture, that Major Andrè went on Shore at General Arnold’s desire in a Boat sent for him with a Flag of Truce; that he not only came ashore with the Knowledge and under the Protection of the General who commanded in the District, but that he took no Step while on Shore but by the Direction of Genl Arnold, as will appear by the inclosed Letter from him to your Excellency.  
Under these Circumstances I could not, and hoped you would not, consider Major André as a Spy, for any improper Phrase in his Letter to you. The Facts he relates correspond with the Evidence I offer—but he admits a Conclusion that does not follow. The Change of Cloaths and Name was ordered by General Arnold, under whose Direction he necessarily was while within his Command. As General Green and I did not agree in Opinion, I wished, that disinterested Gentlemen of Knowledge in the Law of War and Nations might be asked their Opinion on the Subject; and mentioned Monsieur Knyphausen and General Rochambault.  
I related that a Captain Robinson had been delivered to Sir Henry Clinton as a Spy, and undoubtedly was such. But that it being signified to him that you were desirous that this Man should be exchanged, he had ordered him to be exchanged.  
I wished that an Intercourse of such Civilities, as the Rules of War admit of, might take off many of its Horrors. I admitted that Major André had a great Share of Sir Henry Clintons Esteem, and that he would be infinitely obliged by his Liberation; and that if he was permitted to return with me I would engage to have any Person you would be pleased to name set at Liberty.  
  
I added that Sir Henry Clinton had never put to Death any Person for a Breach of the Rules of War, tho’ he had, and now has, many in his Power. Under the present Circumstances much Good may arise from Humanity, much ill from the Want of it. If that could give any Weight, I beg leave to add that your favorable Treatment of Major Andrè, will be a Favor I should ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.  
My Memory does not retain with the Exactness I could wish the Words of the Letter, which General Green show’d me from Major André to your Excellency. For Sir Henry Clintons Satisfaction I beg you will order a Copy of it to be sent to me at New York. I have the Honor to be Your Excellency’s Most Obedient and Most humble Servant

that Major Andre had a great fhare of Six

that if he was permitted to return with me,  
I would engage to have any perfon, you would

I added, that Sir Henry Clinton had ne-

has, many in his power. Under the prefent

Dobbs’s Ferry, O&amp;. 2, 1780.  
SIR,  
A NOTE I have from Gen. Greene,  
leaves me in doubt if his memory had  
ferved him.to relate to you with exactneis  
the fubftance of the conversation that  
had pafled between him and mytelf, on  
the iubject of Major André. In an af-  
fair of fo much confequence to my triend,  
to the two armies, and humanity, I  
would leave no poffibility of a mifunder-  
ftanding, and therefore take the liberty to  
put in writing the fubftance of what I  
faid to General Greene.  
  
I offered to prove, by the evidence of  
Colonel Robinian, and the officers of the  
Vulture, that Major André went on fhore  
at General Arnold’s defire, in a boat fent  
for him with a flag of truce; that he  
not only came afhore with the knowledge  
and under the proteétion of the General  
who commanded in the diftriat, but that  
he took no ftep while on fhore, but by  
the dire&amp;tion of General Arnold, as will  
appear by the enclofed letter from him to  
your Excellency. Under thefe circum-  
ftances I could not, and hoped you would  
not confider Major André as a Spy, for  
any improper phrafe in his lett.s to you.  
  
The faéts he relates cxrrefpond with  
the evidence I offer; but he admits 4  
. conclufion. that does not follow. The  
change of clothes and name was ordered  
  
by.General Arnold, under whofe direc-  
tions he neceflarily was while within mis  
« command.  
  
As Gen. Greene and I did not agree in  
, opinion, I withed thai difintercited gentle-  
men of knowledge of the law of war and

S IR, |  
A NOTE Ihave from Gen. Greene,  
leaves me in doubt it his memory had served  
him, 1o relate to you with exaétnefs the  
substance ot the converfaiion that had pass­  
ed between him and myfelf; on the fubje&amp;  
ot Major Andre. In an aftair of so niuch  
consequence to my friend, to the two armies  
and humanity, I would leave no poflibility  
of a 2 mifunderitanding, and theretore take  
the libarty toiut in writing the fubflance  
of what I faid&quot;to Generai Greene:  
I oftered to prove, by the evidence of Col  
Robinson and the officers of the Vulture,  
that Major Andre went on shore at General  
Arnold’s desire, in a beat sent for him with  
a flag of truce ; that he not only came on  
thore with the knowledge and underthe pro­  
t~étion of the Generai who commanded in  
the district, but that he took no step while  
on thore but by direétion of General Arnold,  
as will appear by the incioted leiter from  
him to your Excellency. .  
Under ticfe circun:i?ances [ could not,and  
hoped you would not, confider Mzjor Andre  
2s a ipy, for any improper phrase in his let­  
ter to you, by # X  
The taéts he relaizs correspond with the  
evidence I offer ; but he admits a conclusion  
that does not follow. The change of cloaths  
and name was ordersd by Generzl Arnold,  
under .whose direétion he necefarily was,  
while within kis command. As General  
Greene and I did not agree in opinion, |  
wish-d thatdifinterefled gentlemen of knows  
iedge of the law of war and nations, might  
be atkzed rheir opinions on the fubjeét ; and  
nienticned Montieur Knyphauien, and Ge­  
nerai Kochambanit,  
I relatad that a Capt. Robinson had been  
deliversd to Sir Henry Clinton as a spy, and  
undoubtedly was such, but that it being fig­  
nitied to fim that you were desirous that this  
man fhcu&#x27;d be exchanged, he hiad ordered  
him tc be exchanged: :  
1 withed that an intercourse of such civili­  
ties, as the rules of war admit of,might take  
off many of its horrors. I admitted that M­  
ajor Andre had a great thare of Sir H. Clin­  
ton’s esteem, and that he would be infinitely  
obliged by his liberation ; and that if he was  
permitted to return with me, I would engage  
to have sry person you would be pleased to  
name, sot at liberty, - ‘  
1 added, that Sir Henry Clinton had ne­  
ver put to death any person for 2 breach of  
the rules -of war, though he had, and now  
has, many in his power. Under the present  
circumstances, much good may arise from  
humanity, much ill from the want of it. llf  
that could give any weight, I begileave to  
add, that your favourable treatment of Ma­  
jor Andre, will be a favour I should ever be  
intent to return to any you hold dear.  
My memory does not retain, with the  
exa&amp;tanefs I could wish, the words of the let­  
ter which General Greene shewed me from  
Major Andre to your Excellency. For Bir  
Henry Clinton’s fatisfaction, I beg you will  
order a copy of it so be sent to me at New-  
York., I have the honor to be,  
Your Excellency’s most  
Obedient and most humble

- Greyhound Schooner, Flag of Truce,  
Sir, Dobb’s-ferry, Oct. 2, 1780.  
  
A note I have from General  
Greene leaves me in doubt if his  
memory had served him to relate  
to you, with exactness, the sub-  
Stance of the conversation that had  
passed between him and myself,  
on the subject of Major André: in  
an allair of so much consequence  
to my friend, to the two armies,  
and humanity, I would leave no  
possibility of a misunderstanding,  
and therefore take the liberty to  
put in writing the substance of  
what I said to General Greene.  
  
I olfered to prove, by the evi-  
dence of Colonel Robinson, and  
the officers of the Vulture, that  
Major André went on shore at Ge-  
neral Arnold’s desire, in a boat  
sent for him witha flag of truce;  
that he not only came ashore with  
the knowledge and under the pro-  
tection of the general who com-  
manded in the district, but that he  
took no step while on shore, but by  
the direction of General Arnold, as  
will appear by the enclosed letter  
from him to your Excellency. Un-  
der these circumstances | could  
not, and hoped you would not,  
consider Major André as a spy, for  
any improper phrase in his letter  
to you.  
  
The facts he relates correspond  
with the evidence I offer; but he  
admits a conclusion that does not  
follow. The change of cloaths and  
name was ordered by General Ar-  
nold, under whose directions he  
necessarily was while within his  
command.  
  
As General Greene and I did not  
agree in opinion, I wished, that dis-  
interested gentlemen of knowledge  
of the law of war and nations  
might be asked their opmion on  
the subject, and mentioned Mon-  
sieur Knyphausen and General  
Bochambault.

son had heen delivered to Sir Henry  
Clinton as a spy, and undoubtedly  
iwas such; but that it being signi-  
fied to him, that you were desirous  
| that the man should be exchanged,  
he hadordered him to be exchanged.  
  
I wished that an intercourse of  
such civilities as the rules of war  
admit of might take off many of its  
horrors. I admitted that Major  
André had a great share of Sir  
Henry Clinton’s esteem, and that  
he would be infinitely obliged by  
his liberation; and that, if he was  
permitted to return with me, I  
would engage to have any person  
you woull be pleased to fame set  
at liberty.  
  
I added, that Sir Henry Clinton  
had never put to death any person  
fora breach of the rules of war,  
though he had, and now has, many  
in his power. Under the present  
circumstances, much geod may  
arise from humanity, much ill from  
the want of it. Uf that could give  
any weight, I beg leave to add,  
that your favourable treatment of  
Major André will be a favour I  
shouid ever be intent to return to  
any you hold dear.  
  
My memory does not retain, with  
the exactness I could wish, the  
words of the letter which General  
Greene shewed me from Major An  
dré to your Excellency. For Sir  
Henry Clinton’s satisfaction, I beg  
you will order a copy of it to be  
sent to me at New York.  
  
I hate the honour to be, your  
Excellency’s most obedient and  
most humble servant,  
  
James ROBERTSON

Robertson also urged that Andre possessed a  
great share of Sir Henry Clinton’s esteem; and  
that he would be infinitely obliged if he should  
be spared. He offered that in ease Andre was  
permitted to return with him to New York, any  
person whatever, that might be named, should  
be set at liberty. All these arguments and en-  
treaties having failed, Robertson presented a  
long letter from Arnold, in which he endeavor-  
ed to exculpate Andre, by acknowledging him-  
self the author of every part of his conduct,  
‘sand particularly insisted on his coming from
