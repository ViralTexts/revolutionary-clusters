Fontainebleau Oct. 28. 1785.  
Seven o’clock, and retired to my fireside, I have determined to enter into conversation with you; this is a village of about 5000 inhabitants, when the court is not here and 20,000 when they are, occupying a valley thro’ which runs a brook, and on each side of it a ridge of small mountains most of which are naked rock. The king comes here, in the fall always, to hunt. His court attend him, as do also the foreign diplomatic corps. But as this is not indispensably required, &amp; my finances do not admit the expence of a continued residence here, I propose to come occasionally to attend the king’s levees, returning again to Paris, distant 40 miles. This being the first trip, I set out yesterday morning to take a view of the place. For this purpose I shaped my course towards the highest of the mountains in sight, to the top of which was about a league. As soon as I had got clear of the town I fell in with a poor woman walking at the same rate with myself &amp; going the same course.  
  
Wishing to know the condition of the labouring poor I entered into conversation with her, which I began by enquiries for the path which would lead me into the mountain; &amp; thence proceeded to enquiries into her vocation, condition &amp; circumstance. She told me she was a day labourer, at 8. sous or 4 d. sterling the day; that she had two children to maintain, &amp; to pay a rent of 30 livres for her house (which would consume the hire of 75 days) that often she could get no emploiment, and of course was without bread. As we had walked together near a mile &amp; she had so far served me as a guide, I gave her, on parting, 24 sous. She burst into tears of a gratitude which I could perceive was unfeigned, because she was unable to utter a word. She had probably never before received so great an aid. This little attendrissement, with the solitude of my walk led me into a train of reflections on that unequal division of property which occasions the numberless instances of wretchedness which I had observed in this country &amp; is to be observed all over Europe. The property of this country is absolutely concentered in a very few hands, having revenues of from half a million of guineas a year downwards. These employ the flower of the country as servants, some of them having as many as 200 domestics, not labouring. They employ also a great number of manufacturers, &amp; tradesmen, &amp; lastly the class of labouring husbandmen. But after all these comes the most numerous of all the classes, that is, the poor who cannot find work. I asked myself what could be the reason that so many should be permitted to beg who are willing to work, in a country where there is a very considerable proportion of uncultivated lands? These lands are kept idle mostly for the sake of game. It should seem then that it must be because of the enormous wealth of the proprietors which places them above attention to the increase of their revenues by permitting these lands to be laboured. I am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable. But the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind, legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property, only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind. The descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children, or to all the brothers &amp; sisters, or other relations in equal degree is a politic measure, and a practicable one. Another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, &amp; to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. The earth is given as a common stock for man to labour &amp; live on. If, for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated, we must take care that other employment be furnished to those excluded from the appropriation. If we do not the fundamental right to labour the earth returns to the unemployed. It is too soon yet in our country to say that every man who can not find employment but who can find uncultivated land, shall be at liberty to cultivate it, paying a moderate rent. But it is not too soon to provide by every possible means that as few as possible shall be without a little portion of land. The small landholders are the most precious part of a state.  
The next object which struck my attention in my walk was the deer with which the wood abounded. They were of the kind called Cerfs and are certainly of the same species with ours. They are blackish indeed under the belly, &amp; not white as ours, &amp; they are more of the chesnut red. But these are such small differences as would be sure to happen in two races from the same stock, breeding separately a number of ages. Their hares are totally different from the animal we call by that name: but their rabbet is almost exactly like him. The only difference is in their manners; the land on which I walked for sometime being absolutely reduced to a honeycomb by their burrowing. I think there is no instance of ours burrowing. After descending the hill again I saw a man cutting fern. I went to him under pretence of asking the shortest road to the town, &amp; afterwards asked for what use he was cutting fern. He told me that this part of the country furnished a great deal of fruit to Paris. That when packed in straw it acquired an ill taste, but that dry fern preserved it perfectly without communicating any taste at all. I treasured this observation for the preservation of my apples on my return to my own country. They have no apple here to compare with our Newtown pipping. They have nothing which deserves the name of a peach; there being not sun enough to ripen the plumbpeach &amp; the best of their soft peaches being like our autumn peaches. Their cherries &amp; strawberries are fair, but I think less flavoured. Their plumbs I think are better; so also the gooseberries, and the pears infinitely beyond any thing we possess. They have no grape better than our sweet-water. But they have a succession of as good from very early in the summer till frost. I am tomorrow to go to mr Malsherbes (an uncle of the Chevalr. Luzerne’s) about 7. leagues from hence, who is the most curious man in France as to his trees. He is making for me a collection of the vines from which the Burgundy, Champagne, Bourdeaux, Frontignac, and other the most valuable wines of this country are made. Another gentleman is collecting for me the best eating grapes, including what we call the raisin. I propose also to endeavor to colonise their hare, rabbet, red &amp; grey partridge, pheasants of different kinds, &amp; some other birds. But I find that I am wandering beyond the limits of my walk &amp; will therefore bid you Adieu. Yours affectionately  
Th: Jefferso

FONTAINEBLEAU, Oct. 28, 1795.  
  
Dear Str: Seven o&#x27;clock, and retired to my  
fireside, I have determined to enter into conversa-  
tion with you. This is a village of about 5,000 inha  
bitants, when the court is not here, &amp; 20,000 when  
they are, occupying a valley thro’ which runs a  
brook and on each side of it a ridge of small moun-  
tains most of which are naked rock. The King  
comes here, in the fall always, to hunt. His court  
attend him, as do also the foreign diplomatic corps,  
but as this is not indispensably required &amp; my  
finances do not admit the expense of a continued  
  
  
  
residence here, I propose to come occasionally to  
attend the King’s levees, returning again to Paris,  
distant forty miles. This being the first trip I set  
out yesterday Morning to take a view of the place.  
For this purpose I shaped my course towards the  
highest of the mountains in sight, to the top of  
which was aboutaleague. Assoon asI had got clear  
of the town I fell in with a poor woman walking at  
the same rate with myself &amp; going the same  
course. Wishing to know the condition of the la-  
boring poor I entered into conversation with her,  
which I began by enquiries for the path which would  
lead me into the mountain: &amp; thence proceeded to  
enquiries into her vocation, condition &amp; circum-  
stances. She told me she was a day laborer at  
8 sous or 4d. sterling the day: that she ,/had two  
children to maintain, &amp; to pay arent of 30 livres  
for her house (which would consume the hire of 75  
days), that often she could get no empioiment, and of  
course was without bread As we had walked together  
near a mile &amp; she had so far served me as a guide,  
I gave her, on parting, 24 sous. She burst into tears  
of a gratitude which I could perceive was unfeigned  
because she was unable to utter a word. She had  
probably never before received so great an aid.  
This little attendrissement, with the solitude of my  
walk led me into a train of reflections on that un-  
equal division of property which occasions the  
numberless instances of wretchedness which I had  
observed in this country &amp; is to be observed all  
over Europe. The property of this Country is abso  
lutely concentred in a very few hands, having  
revenues of ffom half a million of guineas a year  
downwards. These employ the flower of the coun-  
try as servants, some of them having as many as  
2u0 domestics, not labouring. They employ also a  
great number of manufacturers &amp; tradesmen,  
&amp; lastly the class of labouring husbandmen. But  
after all there comes the mest numerous of all  
classes, that is, the poor who cannot find work.  
I asked myself what could be the reason so many  
should be permitted to beg who are willing to work,  
in a country where there is a very Considerable pro  
portion of uncultivated lands? These lands are un-  
disturbed only for the sake of game. It should  
seem then that it must be because of the enormous  
wealth of the proprietors which places them above  
attention to the increase of their revenues by per-  
mitting these lands to be laboured. I am conscious  
that an equal division of property is impracticable,  
but the consequences of this enormous inequality  
producing so much misery to the bulk of Mankind,  
legislators cannot invent too many devices for sub-  
dividing property, only taking care to let their sub-  
divisions go hand in hand with the natural affections  
of the human mind. The descent of property of  
every kind therefore to all the children, or to all the  
brothers &amp; sisters, or other relations in equal de-  
gree is a politic measure, and a practicable one.  
Ancther means of silently lessening the inequality  
of property is to exempt all from taxation below a  
certain point, &amp; to tax the higher portions or pro-  
perty in geometrical progression as they rise.  
Whenever there is in any Country uncultivated lands  
and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of  
property have been so far extended as to violate  
natural right. The earth is given as a common  
stock for man to labour &amp; live on. If for the en-  
couragement of industry we allow it to be appro-  
priated, we must take care that other employment  
be provided to those excluded from the appropria  
tion. If we do not, the fundamental right to labour  
the earth returns to the unemployed. It is too soon  
yet in our country to say that every Man who can-  
not find employment, but who can find uncultivated  
land shall be at liberty to cultivate it, paying a  
moderate rent. But it is not too soon to provide by  
every possible means that as few as possible shall  
be without a little portion of land. The small land-  
holders are the most precious part of a state.—The  
next object which struck my attention in my walk  
was the deer with which the wood abounded. They  
were of the kind called ** Cerfs,”’ and not exactly of  
the same species with ours. They are blackish  
indeed under the belly, &amp; not white as ours, &amp;  
they are mcre of the chestnut red, but these are  
such small differences as would be sure to happen  
in two races from the same stock breeding sepa-  
rately a number of ages. Their hares are totally  
different from the animal we call by that name;  
but their rabbet is almost exactly like him, The  
  
  
  
only difference is in their manners; the land on  
which I walked for some time being absolutely re-  
duced to a honeycomb by their burrowing. I think  
there is no instance of ours burrowing. After  
descending the hill again I saw a man cutting fern.  
I went to him under pretence of asking the shortest  
road to town, and afterwards asked for what use he  
was cutting fern. He told me that this part of  
the country furnished a great deal of fruit to Paris.  
That when packed in straw it acquired an ill taste,  
but that dry fern preserved it perfectly without  
communicating any taste at all. I treasured this  
observation for the preservation of my apples on  
my return to my own country. They have no  
apples here to compare with our Rentown pipping.

but they have a succession of as good from very

determined to enter into conversation with you. This is a village  
of about 5000 inhabitants when the court is not here, and 20,000

and on each side of it a ridge of small mountains, most of which  
are naked rock. The King comes here in the fall always to hunt.
