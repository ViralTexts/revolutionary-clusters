N. York Sunday Evening [July 20, 1788]  
My dear Sir  
Yours of yesterday is this instant come to hand &amp; I have but a few minutes to answer it. I am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen to propositions of the nature you describe. My opinion is that a reservation of a right to withdraw if amendments be not decided on under the form of the Constitution within a certain time, is a conditional ratification, that it does not make N. York a member of the New Union, and consequently that she could not be received on that plan. Compacts must be reciprocal, this principle would not in such a case be preserved. The Constitution requires an adoption in toto, and for ever. It has been so adopted by the other States. An adoption for a limited time would be as defective as an adoption of some of the articles only. In short any condition whatever must viciate the ratification. What the new Congress by virtue of the power to admit new States, may be able &amp; disposed to do in such a case, I do not enquire as I suppose that is not the material point at present. I have not a moment to add more. Know my fervent wishes for your success &amp; happiness.

This idea of reserving right to withdraw was started at Richmd. &amp; considered as a conditional ratification which was itself considered as worse than a rejection

Yours, of yesterday, is this instant eome to

I am sorry that your situation obliges you to listen  
to propositione of the nature you describe. My  
opinion is. that a reservation tfa,right to with  
draw, rf amendments be not decided on under the  
form of the Consiitution within a certain time, fs  
a conditional ratification ; that it does not make  
New York a member of the hew Union, and con  
scquently that she could not be received on that  
plan. Compacts must be reciprocal this prlncT  
pie would not in snch a ease be preserved. The  
Constitution requires an adoption w toio and for­  
ever. It has been so adopted by the other Statea.  
An adoption fof a limited time would le as de  
fee live as an adoption of some ef th articles&#x27; only.  
In short, any condition whatever most vitiate the  
ratification. What the new Congress, by virtue  
of the power to admit new States, may be nib  
and disposed to do in snch case, ( do not inquire,  
as I Appose thatH is Hoi&#x27; tire material -point at

The idea et reserving right to -withdraw was

islature to adopt the most effective means to­  
wards the same end.  
The right of secession, as claimed by the Sd.  
of the above resolutions-, is a new doctrine, and  
one not -admitted by the founder of the Consti­  
tution; and the Statesmen of that day. The fol­  
lowing letter from Mr. Madison to Alexander  
Hamilton is explicit on this point. The State  
of New York, while delilerating in regard to  
adopting the new constitution, wished certain  
amendments to be made, or if not made, to with-,  
draw from tho confederacy. Mr. Hamilton ad­  
dressed Mr. Madison on the sulject, and the  
following is bis reply.  
I am sorry that your situation obliges yon to  
listen to propositions of the uatore you describe.  
My opinion is, that a reservation of a right to  
withdraw, if amendments be not decided on un­  
der the form of the Constitution within a cer­  
tain time, is a conditional ratification; that it does  
not make New York n member of the new Union  
and consequently that .-he could not be received  
on that plan. Compacts must tie reciprocal;  
this principal would not in such a case be pre­  
served. The constitution requires an adoption  
in toto and forever. &quot;It has been so adopted by  
the other States. An adoption for a limited  
lime would lie as defective as an adoption of  
some of the articles only . In short, any condi­  
tion whatever mui-t vitiate the ratification.  
What the new Congress by virtue of ihe power

to do in audi case, I do not inquire, as I suppose  
that it is not the material point at present. I  
have not a moment to add more than my fervent

New York, Sunday evening.  
Sir—Yours of yesterday is this

to answer it. lam sorry that your situation  
obliges you to listen to propositions of the na­  
ture you describe. My opinion is that a re­  
servation of a right to withdraw, if amend­

York a member ot the new Union, and conse­

principle would not in such case be preserved.  
The constitution\requircs an adoption in toto and

other states. An Adoption for a limited time  
wou’d be as defective as an adoption  
of some of the articles only. In short, any

Tut; Right of Secession.—The right of a  
Stale to secede irjin the Union Would ap­  
pear to have been considered and decided by  
the framers of the Constitution. New York  
was unwilling to accept the Union which it  
created, unless she could lei inmate her con­  
nection with it at pleasure. Her proposal  
was to join for live or six years, with the  
rigid then to withdraw if she desired. Gen.

proposition, and he wrote to Mr. Madison in  
regard to it in July, 178 S. This was Mr.

It is true, also, that in some of the ratifying conventions  
attempts were made to adopt the Constitution conditionally,  
with a reserved state power to secede, unless certain amend.  
ments should be inserted within a specified time. This battle  
had to be fought out in the convention of the people of New  
York, and in others. But in every case the adoption was  
ultimately made final and without conditions. Whilst this  
question was pending in New York, Madison wrote in reply to  
certain questions from Hamilton, the following words: “The  
reservation of a right to withdraw is a conditional ratification  
. . . it does not make New York a member of the new union,  
and consequently she could not be received on that plan. The  
Constitution requires ag.adoption in toto, and for ever. It has

The Constitution requires an aiption in toto  
and forever. It has been so adopted by the  
other States. An adoption for c limited time  
would be as defective as an adoption of some  
of the articles onlv. la short, any condition  
whatever must vitiate the ratification. What the

such a care, I do not inquire, as I suppose that  
is not the material point at present.

ed upon that instrument by a certain time, that  
she should be allowed to withdraw, and Mr.  
Hamilton wrote to Mr. Madison, asking his  
opinion as to such a ratification—that is, &quot;is to  
whether there could be a conditional ratiflea­  
tiop. Mr. Madison replied as follows:  
“My opinion is, that a reservation of tiie right  
to withdraw, if amendments be not decided up­  
on under tiie form of the Constitution within a  
certain time, is a conditional ratification ; that  
it does not make New York a member of the  
new union, and, consequently, that she could  
not be received on that plan. Compacts must be  
reciprocal, this principle would not, in such a  
case, he preserved. Tiie Constitution requires

be that only a conditional ratification  
could be obtained, and he wrote to Madi-  
son to ask if a State could adopt the Con-  
stitution conditionally and afterward  
withdraw from the Union if its proposed  
amendments were not adopted. Madison  
replied: ‘A conditional ratification does  
not make a State a member of the Union.  
The Constitution requires an adoption in

by the other States. An adoption for a

one of those named by Mr. Lodge, signed  
the circular letter of the New-York onven-

declaration: ‘‘Our attachment to our sis-

not be more forcibly demonstrated than by  
acceding to a Government which,many of  
us think very imperfect, and devolving the
