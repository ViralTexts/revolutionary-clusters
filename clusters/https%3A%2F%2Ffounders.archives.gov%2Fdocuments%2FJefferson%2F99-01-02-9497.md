My Children, Deputies of   
  
the Cherokee Upper Towns   
  
Jan. 9. 1809.  
  
I have maturely considered the Speeches you have delivered me and will now give you answers to the several matters they contain  
You inform me of your anxious desires to engage in the industrious pursuits of agriculture &amp; civilized life; that finding it impracticable to induce the nation at large to join in this you wish a line of separation to be established between the upper and lower Towns, so as to include all the waters of the Hiwassee in your part, and that having thus contracted your Society within narrower limits you propose within these to begin the establishment of fixed laws &amp; of regular government. you say that the lower Towns are satisfied with the division you propose, and on these Several matters you ask my advice and aid.—  
With respect to the line of division between yourselves &amp; the lower Towns, it must rest on the joint consent of both parties. the one you propose appears moderate reasonable &amp; well defined. we are willing to recognize those on each side of that line as distinct societies and if our aid shall be necessary to mark it more plainly than nature has done, you shall have it. I think with you, that on this reduced scale it will be more easy for you to introduce the regular administration of laws.—  
In proceeding to the establishment of laws you wish to adopt them from ours, &amp; such only for the present as suit your present condition; chiefly indeed those for the punishment of crimes &amp; the protection of property. but who is to determine which of our laws suit your condition &amp; shall be in force with you? all of you being equally free, no one has a right to say what shall be law for the others— our way is to put these questions to the vote, and to consider that as law for which the Majority votes. the fool has as great a right to express his opinion, by vote, as the wise, because he is equally free &amp; equally master of himself. but as it would be inconvenient for all your men to meet in one place, would it not be better for every Town to do as we do, that is to say, chuse by the vote of the Majority of the Town and of the country people nearer to that than to any other Town, one, two, three or more, according to the size of the Town, of those whom each voter thinks the wisest &amp; honestest men of their place and let these meet together and agree which of our laws suit them. but these men know nothing of our laws. how then can they know which to adopt. let them associate in their Council our beloved man living with them, Colo. Meigs, and he will tell them what our law is on any point they desire. he will inform them also of our methods of doing business in our Councils so as to preserve order and to obtain the vote of every member fairly. this Council can make a law for giving to every head of a family a separate parcel of land, which when he has built upon and improved, it shall belong to him &amp; his descendants forever, &amp; which the Nation itself shall have no right to sell from under his feet. they will determine too what punishment shall be inflicted for every crime. in our States generally we punish murder only by death, and all other crimes by solitary confinement in a prison.  
But when you shall have adopted Laws, who are to execute them? perhaps it may be best to permit every Town and the Settlers in it’s neighborhood attached to it, to Select some of their best men, by a Majority of its Voters to be Judges in all differences, and to execute the law according to their own judgment. Your Council of representatives will decide on this or such other mode as may best suit you. I suggest these things My Children for the consideration of the Upper Towns of your Nation, to be decided on as they think best, and I sincerely wish you may succeed in your laudable endeavors to save the remains of your Nation by adopting industrious Occupations and a Government of regular law. in this you may always rely on the counsel &amp; assistance of the Government of the U.S.—deliver these words to your people in my name &amp; assure them of my friendship

I have maturely considered the !  
speechen yon have delivered me, and &#x27;  
will now give you answers to the se- j  
ver.il matters they contain.  
You inform n;c of your anxious  
desires to engage in the industrious  
pursuits of agriculture and civiliz; d  
life ; that finding it impracticable to  
induce the nation at large t© join in :  
this, you wish a lire of separation to  
jbe established between the Upper 8t  
i Lower Towns, so as to include ~1l  
| the waters of the Ifighwassee in your  
&#x27; part ; and that having thus contract­  
ed yeur society within narrower li­  
mits, you propose, within these, to  
begin the establishment of fixed laws  
and of regular government. You  
say, th.it the Lower Towns are satis­  
fied with the division you propose,  
and on these several matters you ask  
&#x27;■ and aid.  
Wi ct to the Llfte of division  
between your-setves and the tower  
  
Town 3, it must rest en the joint coo  
sent of both par-ties, i 1 &lt; om  
propose appears moderate] r  
and well defined ; we are willir  
recognize those on each side of *  
line as distinct societies, and if our  
aid shall be necessary to mark it mora  
plainly than nature has done, you   
j have it. I think with you, that ony  
this reduced scale, it will be more  
easy-for you to introduce the regular  
administration of laws.  
In proceeding to the establishment  
of laws you wish to adopt them from  
j ours, and such only for the present  
jas suit your present condition ; chief­  
i ly indeed those for the punishment of  
1 crimes and the protection of proper­  
, ty. But who is to determine which  
of our laws suit your condition, and­  
shall be in fdrce with you ? All of  
you being equally free, no one has a  
sight to say what shall be law for the  
others. Our way is to put the c quesn  
tions to the vote, and to consider  
as law for which the majority votes—  
&#x27; the fool has as great a ri pr&lt; s«  
j his opinion by vole as the.  
cause he is equally free, and eqi  
master of himself. But as it would  
be inconvenient for all your men to  
meet in one place, would it not bo bet­  
ter for every town to do as we do-4»  
that is to say : Choose by the vol  
the majority of the town and o! ;;ie  
j country people nearer to that than to  
[ any other town, one, two, three or  
&#x27; more, according to the size of the  
i town, of those whom each voter thinks  
: the wisest and hones&#x27;iest men of their  
place, and let these meet together an »  
agree which of our laws suit them.  
But these men know nothing of out  
laws Hovr then can they know which  
to ndor&gt;i ? Let th«m ajbociate in their  
council our helot ed man living with  
i them, cob Meigs, and he will left  
i them what our law is on any poiut  
f&quot; they desire. He will inform them  
i also of our methods of doing business  
in our councils, bo a* to preserve or­  
der, and to ob«iin the vote of every  
member fairly. This council can  
make a taw for giving to every heir!  
of a family a sepaiate parcel of land,  
which, when he has built upon and  
; improved, it shall belong to him and  
his descendants forever, and which  
• the nation itself shall have no right ■•  
sell from under his feet. They will  
determine too, what punishment shall  
|be inflicted for every crime. In our­  
-1 states generally, we punish murder  
I only, by death, and all other crime*  
by solitary confinewien in a pr-  
But when you shall have adopted:  
laws, who are to execute them ? Per­  
haps, it maybe best to permit every  
town and the settlers in its neighbor­  
-1 hood attached to it, to select some  
. of their best men, by a majority oi  
its voters, to be judges in all d  
ences, and to execute the  
according to their own judgeffl  
Your council of representatives  
decide on this or such other mode an  
may best suit you. I suggest  
things, my children, for tire considera­  
tion of the Upper &#x27;Towns of your na­  
tion, to be decided on as they think  
best, and I sincerely wish you  
succeed in jour laudable r  
to save the remain*of your nation,  
by adopting industrious occupations&#x27;  
and a government of regular law«  
In this you may always rely on the  
sel h assistaoceof the govern  
of the U.S. Deliver these words to  
your people in my name, and assure  
them of ny friendship.
