Note, That Morris and Hunterdon Counties, were both in one, under the Name of Hunterdon, in 1737–8. In 1745, the Number of the People called Quakers in New-Jersey, was found to be 6079; no distinct Account was taken of them in 1737–8. Total of Souls in 1737, 47369; Ditto in 1745, 61403; Increase 14034. Query, At this Rate of Increase, in what Number of Years will that Province double its Inhabitants?

Note; No Account of Burials in the Swedish Ground, was taken in the Year 1743, and those Germans buried in the new Dutch Burying Ground, are numbered among the Strangers, who were chiefly Palatines: The Mortality among them is not owing to any Unhealthiness of this Climate, but to Diseases they contract on Shipboard, the Voyage sometimes happening to be long, and too great a Number crowded together. Exclusive of those, the Total of Deaths in seven Years is about 2100, which is 300 per Annum: By which we should have had nearly 10,500 Inhabitants during those seven Years, at a Medium; for in a healthy Country (as this is) political Arithmeticians compute, there dies yearly One in Thirty-fiv

s and upwards, 2600 Negroes, 27,420 Horse-kind of three Years old and upwards, 52,000 Neat Cattle of three to four Years old and upwards, 130,001 sheep of one year old and upwards. In 1742 there was 41,000 Polls of white Men, from 16 Years upwards. Increase of Men in seven Years 1573, which is near one Sixth. New-Jersey increased in the same Time near one Third.  
By the New-Jersey Accounts it appears, that the Number of Males, aged above 16, is nearly one fourth Part of the whole Number of Souls. If the same Proportion holds in the Massachusetts, they should have had in that Province, in 1742, about 164000 Souls. There are three other Provinces in New-England, viz. Connecticut, Rhode-Island, and New-Hampshire.  
In 1742, a Year of middling Health in Boston, were buried about 515, which multiplied by 35, makes nearly 18,000 Inhabitants. In the same Year were found in that Town, Dwelling-houses 1719, Warehouses 166, Widows 1200, of which 1000 poor; in the Almshouse III Persons; in the Work-house 36; Negroes 1514; Horses 418; Cows 141.  
In 1748–9, the Dwelling-houses in Philadelphia were 2076. The following Summer arrived 24 or 25 Sail of Ships with German Families, supposed to bring near 12,000 Souls.  
It has been computed in England, that the Colonies on the Continent, taken one with another, double the Number of their Inhabitants every Thirty Years. This quick Increase is owing not so much to natural Generation, as the Accession of Strangers. What the natural Increase of Mankind is, is a curious Question. In Breslaw, the Capital of Silesia, a healthy inland City, to which many Strangers do not come, the Number of Inhabitants was found to be generally about 34,000. An exact Register is kept there of the Births and Burials, which taken for 30 Years together, amount, as follows,  
  
  
Births per Annum,  
1238  
  
  
Deaths per Annum,  
1174  
  
  
Yearly Increase but  
64  
  
  
Let the expert Calculator say, how long it will be, before by an Increase of 64 per Annum, 34,000 People will double themselves?  
Yet I believe People increase faster by Generation in these Colonies, where all can have full Employ, and there is Room and Business for Millions yet unborn. For in old settled Countries, as England for Instance, as soon as the Number of People is as great as can be supported by all the Tillage, Manufactures, Trade and Offices of the Country, the Overplus must quit the Country, or they will perish by Poverty, Diseases, and want of Necessaries. Marriage too, is discouraged, many declining it, till they can see how they shall be able to maintain a Family.  
January. XI Month.  
  
So weak are human Kind by Nature made,  
Or to such Weakness by their Vice betray’d,  
Almighty Vanity! to thee they owe  
Their Zest of Pleasure, and their Balm of Woe.  
Thou, like the Sun, all Colours dost contain,  
Varying like Rays of Light on Drops of Rain;  
For every Soul finds Reason to be proud,  
Tho’ hiss’d and hooted by the pointing Croud.  
  
There are three Things extreamly hard, Steel, a Diamond and to know one’s self.  
Hunger is the best Pickle.

44–5, died Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria, and Emperor of Germany. ’Tis thought his Death was hastened by Grief and Vexation at the Success of the Queen of Hungary, and the Disappointments of his own Ambition. O Content! What art thou! And where to be found! Art thou not an inseparable Companion of Honour, Wealth and Power? No. This Man was rich, great, a Sovereign Prince: But he wanted to be richer, greater, and more a Sovereign. At first his Arms had vast Success; but a Campaign or two left him not a Foot of Land he could call his own, and reduc’d him to live with his Empress in a hired House at Frankfort!  
  
The bold Bavarian, in a luckless Hour,  
Tries the dread summits of Cesarean Power,  
With unexpected Legions bursts away,  
And sees defenceless Realms receive his Sway;  
Short Sway! Fair Austria spreads her mournful Charms,  
The Queen, the Beauty, sets the World in Arms;  
From Hill to Hill the Beacon’s rousing Blaze  
Spreads wide the Hope of Plunder and of Praise;  
The fierce Croatian, and the wild Hussar,  
And all the Sons of Ravage, crowd the War;  
The baffled Prince, in Honour’s flatt’ring Bloom,  
Of hasty Greatness, finds the fatal Doom;  
His Foes Derision, and his Subjects Blame,  
And steals to Death from Anguish, and from Shame.  
  
February. XII Month.  
  
We smile at Florists, we despise their Joy,  
And think their Hearts enamour’d of a Toy;  
But are those wiser, whom we most admire,  
Survey with Envy, and pursue with Fire?  
What’s he, who fights for Wealth, or Fame, or Power?  
Another Florio, doating on a Flower,  
A short-liv’d Flower, and which has often sprung,  
From sordid Arts, as Florio’s out of Dung.  
  
A Cypher and Humility make the other Figures and Virtues of ten fold Value.  
If it were not for the Belly, the Back might wear Gold.

For Liberality.  
  
Tho’ safe thou think’st thy Treasure lies,  
Hidden in Chests from Human Eyes,  
Thieves, Fire, may come, and it may be  
Convey’d, my Friend, as far from thee.  
Thy Vessel that yon Ocean sails,  
Tho’ favour’d now with prosp’rous Gales,  
Her Cargo which has Thousands cost,  
All in a Tempest may be lost.  
Cheats, Whores and Quacks, a thankless Crew,  
Priests, Pickpockets, and Lawyers too,  
All help by several Ways to drain,  
Thanking themselves for what they gain;  
The Liberal are secure alone,  
For what they frankly give, for ever is their own.  
  
March. I Month.  
  
What’s the bent Brow, or Neck in Thought reclin’d?  
The Body’s Wisdom, to conceal the Mind.  
A Man of Sense can Artifice disdain,  
As Men of Wealth may venture to go plain;  
And be this Truth eternal ne’er forgot,  
Solemnity’s a Cover for a Sot;  
I find the Fool, when I behold the Screen:  
For ’tis the Wise Man’s Interest to be seen.  
  
Wouldst thou confound thine Enemy, be good thy self.  
  
Pride is as loud a Beggar as Want, and a great deal more saucy.  
Pay what you owe, and what you’re worth you’ll know.

Why, Celia, is your spreading Waist  
So loose, so negligently lac’d?

Alas, what Pity ’tis to find  
This Fault in Half the Female kind!

Poverty, &amp;c. Yet the Turks in pillaging it, found so much Wealth among them, that even their common Soldiers were enriched: And it became a Saying, which continues to this Day, when they observe a Man grown suddenly rich, He has been at the Sack of Constantinople.  
O Avarice! How blind are thy Votaries! How often by grasping at too much, do they lose all, and themselves with it! The Thirst of More, encreases with the Heap; and to the restless Desire of Getting, is added the cruel Fear of Losing, a Torment from which the Poor are free. And Death often scatters all we have with so much Care and Toil been gathering;  
  
High built Abundance, Heap on Heap for what?  
To breed new Wants, and beggar us the more;  
Then make a richer Scramble for the Throng?  
Soon as this feeble Pulse, which leaps so long  
  
Almost by Miracle, is tir’d with Play,  
Like Rubbish from disploding Engines thrown,  
Our Magazines of hoarded Trifles fly;  
Fly diverse; fly to Foreigners, to Foes:  
New Masters court, and call the former Fool,  
(How justly!) for Dependance on their Stay,  
Wide scatter, first, our Playthings, then our Dust.

“Daphnis, says Clio, has a charming Eye;  
What Pity ’tis her Shoulder is awry?  
Aspasia’s Shape indeed—but then her Air,  
’Twould ask a Conj’rer to find Beauty there.”  
Without a But, Hortensia she commends,  
The first of Women, and the best of Friends;  
Owns her in Person, Wit, Fame, Virtue, bright;  
But how comes this to pass?—She dy’d last Night.

On the 7th of this Month, 1692, the Town of Port Royal, in Jamaica, was sunk by a fearful Earthquake.  
The Day was very clear, and afforded no Suspicion of the least Evil; but in the Space of three Minutes, about half an Hour after 11 in the Morning, that fine Town was shaken to Pieces, sunk into, and cover’d, for the greater Part, by the Sea: By the falling of the Houses, Opening of the Earth, and Inundation of the Waters, near 2000 Persons were lost, many of Note.  
For some Days afterwards, ’twas dismal to see the Harbour cover’d with the dead Bodies of People of all Conditions, floating up and down without Burial: For the great Burial Place, was destroy’d by the Earthquake; which dashing to Pieces the Tombs, whereof there were Hundreds in that Place, the Sea washed the Carcasses of those who had been buried out of their Graves.  
  
A Sickness followed, which carried off some Thousands more. During the Earthquake, Thieves robbed and plundered the Sufferers, even among the Ruins, while the Earth trembled under their Feet. Some were killed in th

Vain are the Studies of the Fop and Beau,  
Who all their Care expend on outward Show.  
Of late abroad was young Florello seen;  
How blank his Look! How discompos’d his Mien!

Attend, and here are sown Delights immense,  
For every Intellect, and every Sense.  
  
You may be too cunning for One, but not for All.  
Genius without Education is like Silver in the Mine.

 aged 60 Years. A great Storm happen’d the Night he died, from whence his Enemies took Occasion to say, The D---l fetch’d him away in a Whirlwind: But his Poet Waller, in some Verses on his Death, gave that Circumstance quite a different Turn. He begins with these lofty Lines; viz.  
  
We must resign, Heav’n his great Soul does claim,  
In Storms as loud as his immortal Fame;  
His dying Groans, his last Breath shakes our Isle,  
And Trees uncut fall for his Fun’ral Pile, &amp;c.  
  
When the King came in, Waller made his Peace by a congratulatory Poem to his Majesty: And one Day ’tis said the King asked him jocularly, What is the Reason, Mr. Waller, that your Verses on Oliver are so much better than those you made on me? We Poets, my Liege, reply’d he, always succeed better in Fiction than in Truth.  
  
Much Learning shows how little Mortals know;  
Much Wealth, how little Worldlings can enjoy.  
At best it baby’s us with endless Toys,  
And keeps us Children ’till we drop to Dust.  
As Monkies at a Mirror stand amaz’d,  
They fail to find what they so plainly see;  
Thus Men, in shining Riches, see the Face  
Of Happiness, nor know it is a Shade;  
But gaze, and touch, and peep, and peep again,  
And wish, and wonder it is absent still.  
  
October. VIII Month.  
  
With Adoration think, with Rapture gaze,  
And hear all Nature chant her Maker’s Praise;  
With Reason stor’d, by Love of Knowledge fir’d,  
By Dread awaken’d, and by Love inspir’d,  
Can We, the Product of another’s Hand,  
Nor whence, nor how, nor why we are, demand?  
And, not at all, or not aright employ’d,  
Behold a Length of Years, and all a Void?  
  
  
You can bear your own Faults, and why not a Fault in your Wife.  
Tho’ Modesty is a Virtue, Bashfulness is a Vice.  
  
Hide not your Talents, they for Use were made.  
What’s a Sun-Dial in the Shade!

s to come.  
  
  
November. IX Month.  
  
Happy, thrice happy he! whose conscious Heart,  
Enquires his Purpose, and discerns his Part;  
Who runs with Heed, th’ involuntary Race,  
Nor lets his Hours reproach him as they pass;  
Weighs how they steal away, how sure, how fast,  
And as he weighs them, apprehends the last.  
Or vacant, or engag’d, our Minutes fly;  
We may be negligent, but we must die.  
  
What signifies knowing the Names, if you know not the Natures of Things.  
Tim was so learned, that he could name a Horse in nine Languages; So ignorant, that he bought a Cow to ride on.  
The Golden Age never was the present Age.  
On the 30th of this Month, 1718, Charles XII. of Sweden, the modern Alexander, was kill’d before Fredericstadt. He had all the Virtues of a Soldier, but, as is said of the Virtues of Cesar, They undid his Country: Nor did they upon the whole afford himself any real Advantage. For after all his Victories and Conquests, he found his Power less than at first, his Money spent, his Funds exhausted, and his Subjects thinn’d extreamly. Yet he still warr’d on, in spite of Reason and Prudence, till a small Bit of Lead, more powerful than they, persuaded him to be quiet.  
  
On what Foundation stands the Warrior’s Pride?  
How just his Hopes, let Swedish Charles decide;  
A Frame of Adamant, a Soul of Fire,  
No Dangers fright him, and no Labours tire;  
O’er Love, o’er Force, extends his wide Domain,  
Unconquer’d Lord of Pleasure and of Pain;  
No Joys to him pacific Scepters yield,  
War sounds the Trump, he rushes to the Field;  
Behold surrounding Kings their Pow’r combine,  
And one capitulate, and one resign;  
Peace courts his Hand, but spreads her Charms in vain,  
“Think nothing gain’d, he cries, ’till nought remain;  
On Moscow’s Walls till Gothic Standards fly,  
  
And all is mine beneath the Polar Sky.”  
The March begins in military State,  
And Nations on his Eye suspended wait;  
Stern Famine guards the solitary Coast,  
And Winter barricades the Realms of Frost;  
He comes, nor Want nor Cold his Course delay;  
Hide, blushing Glory, hide Pultowa’s Day:  
The vanquish’d Hero leaves his broken Bands,  
And shews his Miseries in distant Lands;  
Condemn’d a needy Supplicant to wait,  
While Ladies interpose, and Slaves debate.  
But did not Chance at length her Error mend?  
Did no subverted Empire mark his End?  
Did rival Monarchs give the fatal Wound?  
Or hostile Millions press him to the Ground?  
His Fall was destin’d to a barren Strand,  
A petty Fortress, and a dubious Hand;  
He left the Name at which the World grew pale,  
To point a Moral, or adorn a Tale.  
  
December. X Month.  
  
And thou supreme of Beings and of Things!  
Who breath’st all Life, and giv’st Duration Wings;  
Intense, O let me for thy Glory burn,  
Nor fruitless view my Days and Nights return;  
Give me with Wonder at thy Works to glow;  
To grasp thy Vision, and thy Truths to know;  
To reach at length thy everlasting Shore,  
And live and sing ’till Time shall be no more.  
  
’Tis a Shame that your Family is an Honour to you! You ought to be an Honour to your Family.  
Glass, China, and Reputation, are easily crack’d, and never well mended.

From hence proceed averfion, ſtrife, -  
And all that ſours the wedded life.

Let neatneſs then, and beauty ſtrive

ON FEMALE NEATNESS AFTER MARRIAGE.  
  
Wary, Celia, is your spreading waist  
So loose, so negligently lac’d ¢  
Why must the wrapping bed-gown hide  
Your snowy bosom’s swelling pride?  
How ill that dress adorns your head,  
Distain’d and rumpled from the bed!  
Those clouds that shade vour blooming face,  
A little water might displace ;  
As nature every morn bestows  
The chrystal dew to cleanse the rose.  
Those tresses, as the raven black,  
That wav&#x27;d in ringlets down your back,  
Uncomb’d, and injur&#x27;d by neglect,  
Destroy the face which once they deck&#x27;d.  
Whence this forgetfulness of dress !  
Pray, Madam are you married ?....Yeseeu.  
Nay, then indeed the wonder ceases,  
No matter now how loose your dress is ;  
The end is won, your fortune’s made,  
Your sister now may take the trade.  
Alas! what pity ’tis to find  
This fault in half the female kind!  
From hence proceed aversion, strife,  
And all that sours the wedded life.  
Beauty can only point the dart,  
&quot;Tis neatness guides it to the heart ;  
Let neatness then and beauty strive  
  
To keep a wav’ring flame alive.

Bon APARTE.  
On what foundation stands the warrior’s pride,  
How just his hopes let history’s page decile,  
A frame of adamant, a soul of fire,  
No dangers fright him, and no labours tire ;  
O’er love, o’er fear, extends his wide domain,  
Unconguer’d lord of pleasure and of pain ;  
No joys to him pacific sceptres yield,  
War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field.  
Behold surrounding kings their powers combine,  
And one capitulate, and one resign ;  
Peace courts his hand, but spreads her charms in vain,  
‘* Think nothing gain’d,”’ he cries, * till nought remain ;  
On Moscow’s walls till Gothic standards fly,  
And all be mine beneath the polar sky.”’  
The march begins in military state,  
And nations on his eye suspended wait,  
Stern famine guards the solitary coast,  
And winter barricades the realms of frost ;  
He comes, nor want, nor cold, his course delay ;  
Hide blushing glory, hide Pultowa’s day.  
The vanquish’d hero leaves his broken bands,  
And shews his miseries in distant lands ;  
But did not chance at length her error mend ?  
Did not subverted empire mark his end ?  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Wishes of a&#x27;‘princess.  
His fall was destin&#x27;d to a barren strand,

To. point a moral, and adorn a tale.

These view young Ammon triumph o&#x27;er  
the ball :  
  
Now haughty Rome in martial rigor frowns,  
  
And bears down powerful states, and treads  
on crowns ;  
  
Bids mighty cities in a flame expire,  
  
Nor dreams of Vandal rage and Gothic fire.  
  
Mankind and theirs possess one common  
thrall ;  
  
And, like the gods that sway them, empires  
fall.  
  
Some period void of science and of fame,  
  
Scarce e’er exist, or leave behind a name ;  
  
Mere sluggish rounds to let succession  
climb ;  
  
Obscure and idle expletives of time.  
  
Lo, earth smiles wide, and radiant heaven  
looks down,  
  
All fair, all gay, and urgent to be known!  
  
Attend, and here are sown delights im-  
imense,  
  
For ev&#x27;ry intellect and ev&#x27;ry sense,  
  
With adoration think, with raptare gaze,  
  
And hear all nature chaunt her Maker&#x27;s  
praise.  
  
With reason stor’d, by love of knowledge  
fir’d,  
  
By dread awaken&#x27;d, and by bope inspir&#x27;d,  
  
Can we, the product of another&#x27;s hand,  
  
Nor whence, nor how, nor why we are,  
demand ?  
  
And, not atall, or not aright, employ’d,  
  
Behold a length of years, and all a void?  
  
Happy, thrice happy he! whose consci-  
ous heart  
Inquires his purpose, and discerns his part ;  
Who runs with heed th’ involuntary race,  
Nor lets his hours reproach him as they  
RssS ;  
Weighs how they steal away, how sure,  
how fast,  
And, as he weighs them, apprehends the  
last:  
Or vacant, or engag’d, our minutes fly ;  
We may be negligent, but we must die.
