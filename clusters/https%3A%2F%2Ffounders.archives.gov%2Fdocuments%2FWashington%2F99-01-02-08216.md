‘* HEADQUARTERS, 2/st¢ April, 1782.  
  
‘‘Str: The inclosed representation of the inhabitants of Mon-  
mouth, with testimonials of the fact, which can be corroborated  
by other unquestionable evidence, will bring before Your Ex-  
cellency the most wanton, cruel, and unprecedented murder  
that ever disgraced the arms of acivilized people. I shall not,  
because I consider it altogether unnecessary, trouble Your  
Excellency with any animadversions on this transaction.  
Candor obliges me to be explicit. To save the innocent, I de-  
mand the guilty. Captain Lippencott, or the officer who com-  
manded at the execution of Captain Huddy, must be given up ;  
or, if that officer was of inferior rank to him, so many of the  
perpetrators as will, according to the tariff of exchange, be an  
equivalent. To do this will mark the justice of Your Excel-  
lency’s character ; in failure of it, I shall hold myself justified  
in the eyes of God and man for the measures to which I shall  
resort. I beg Your Excellency to be persuaded that it cannot  
be more disagreeable to you to be addressed in this language  
than it is for me to offer it, but the subject requires frankness  
and decision. I have to request your speedy determination,  
as my resolution is suspended but for your answer.”’
