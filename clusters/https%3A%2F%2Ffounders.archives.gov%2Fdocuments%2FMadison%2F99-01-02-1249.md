No. 8.  
						Sir  
						London January 3d. 1807.  
					  
					We have the honor to transmit you a Treaty which we concluded with the British Commissioners on the 31st. of December. Altho’ we had entertained great confidence from the commencement of the negotiation, that such would be it’s result, it was not untill the  
						27th. that we were able to make any satisfactory arrangement of several of the most important points that were involved in it. On the next day we communicated to you that event by several dispatches, three of which were forwarded by vessels from Liverpool, so that we hope you  
						will receive very early intelligence of it. We commit this, with the Treaty, to Mr. Purviance, who we flatter ourselves will have the good fortune to arrive in time to deliver it to you before the adjournment of Congress.  
					The necessity we feel ourselves under to forward to you the Treaty without delay will we fear render it impossible for us to enter so fully into the subject of it, as on many considerations it might be proper to do. We are aware that such instruments must  
						be construed by an impartial view of their contents uninfluenced by extraneous matter. A knowledge however of the sense in which the several articles of a treaty were understood by the parties to it may in  cases be useful. It is also just to  
						remark that some circumstances occurred in the course of this negotiation, which, altho’ they do not appear on the face of the Instrument itself, yet as they may have no inconsiderable influence on the future relations of the two countries, it is peculiarly  
						important to explain. We shall endeavor to give such explanations, where they may be necessary, in the best manner that may be found compatible with the dispatch which the occasion so imperiously requires, and we flatter ourselves without omitting any thing  
						on any point that may be deemed of essential importance.  
					The first article of the present Treaty which stipulates that peace shall subsist between the parties is taken from that of 1794 and is found in most of the modern treaties.  
					The second article confirms those of a permanent nature in the treaty of 1794. The British Commissioners were very desirous to introduce the permanent articles of that treaty in the form of new stipulations into the present one. They insisted with great  
						earnestness that the article which relates to the trade with the Indian tribes should be so amended as to admit the traders of Canada and the Hudson Bay Company to participate with us in the trade, with the tribes in Louisiana. They seemed to admit that by a fair construction  
						of the article they could not support such a claim, but contended that it was justified by its spirit. Their solicitude on this point which they had supposed was an unimportant one to the U. States created some embarrassment and delay in the business. They intimated that it  
						proceeded from a desire to conciliate the public opinion in this country in favor of the treaty, which became necessary in consequence of the concessions which they thought they made us on other points. As we were decidedly of opinion that the article in the Treaty of 1794.  
						could not apply to territory afterwards acquired, and could see nothing in its spirit which entitled it to such an extension, and more especially as our instructions contemplated a different result, it was impossible for us to adopt that proposal. They finally agreed  
						therefore, tho’ not without evident reluctance, to the article in it’s present form.  
					We regret to say that the third article which regulates our trade with the the British possessions in India, which with one essential and most unfavorable difference is the same with the thirteenth article of the treaty of 1794., is not  
						what we had been led to hope it would be practicable to make it. Aware of the importance attached to this commerce in America, we have used the most zealous and persevering efforts, not only to prevent the introduction of new restraints upon it, but even to emancipate it from  
						some of those which the treaty of 1794. had distinctly sanctioned. The India company have however been less accomodating than was at first expected, and hence the rejection of all the amendments proposed by us, one of which sought to omit  
							entirely and (when that was refused) to modify, the provisions copied from the treaty of 1794, that our voyages from the British possessions should be direct to the U. States. This amendment, in both it’s shapes, was repelled in such  
						a manner as to convince us that nothing would be gained by continuing to press it, and we gave it up at length with great reluctance. In this stage of the business the British Commissioners insisted upon an amendment upon their part by which our voyages to British India were  
						required to be direct from the U. States. This unexpected amendment was proposed, at the instance of the India Company, after the project of the British Commissioners (which, with reference to this subject, was a literal copy of the 13. art. of the treaty of 1794) had not  
						only been presented to us, but fully discussed, and, as we understood, settled. The real intention and office of it were said by Lord Holland and Lord Auckland to be no more than to make the article speak unequivocally what was the true meaning of the article in the late  
						treaty. We replied to this that the article in the late treaty was not susceptible of this limited construction; that its obvious import was that only the voyage from India should be direct; that this had been solemnly adjudged by their own courts of law, and that the  
						practice had been and still continued to be so. We were answered by the production of a paper purporting to be a report of  that in their opinion an American vessel was not entitled to a clearance from a port in G.  
						Britain to Calcutta under the treaty of 1794. We were told moreover that Lord Grenville when he made the treaty, the India Company when it sanctioned, and the British government when it ratified it, did not mean to authorize any other than direct voyages, outward as well as  
						homeward, between the U. States and their Indian possessions, and that if the treaty was liable to any other construction, it arose from mere inadvertence in adjusting the phraseology; but that in truth it was not a fair and natural interpretation of words, which authorized a  
						commerce between two defined limits, that a commerce between one of those limits, and some third place was intended to be allowed, altho’ not a word was said about it in the article. Having given the obvious answer to these suggestions,  
						we urged as long and as zealously as was thought advisable the inconveniences to which our trade with India would be subjected by prohibiting any of the modes in which it was prosecuted, as well as the unfriendly appearance of the new restriction for which there existed no  
						adequate motive. We spoke of the sensibility which would be excited in our country by such an ill-timed and ungracious interference, the interests which it would affect, and the passions which it would enlist against the entire treaty; to all which it was finally answered  
						that the India Company could not be prevailed upon to relax upon this point; that moreover it ought not to be forgotten that this was a trade from which their own subjects were ordinarily excluded in favor of the company’s monopoly: that this monopoly, as a losing concern,  
						seemed at present to require peculiar protection: that our admission into British India at all was a boon for which we did not and could not give any equivalent, and of course that we could not justly complain, if that admission was somewhat qualified with a view to the  
						mitigation of the evils, by which it was undoubtedly attended and which it was not possible wholly to prevent; especially if we were not placed upon a more disadvantageous footing in that respect than other friendly powers, which was so far from being the case that we were  
						unquestionably admitted by the article, as they proposed to amend it, upon much better terms than any other nation, inasmuch as our commerce (exclusive of the advantage of being secured by treaty) would be subject only to British duties, whereas the Danes  
						and Swedes paid alien duties to a considerable amount, without enjoying any priviledge (whatever might be said to the contrary) to which we were not equally entitled. We were at last reduced to the necessity of accepting the article with the obnoxious amendment, rendered less  
						obnoxious perhaps by the clause, relative to the most favored nation, or making a treaty without any article upon the subject, which would have the same and probably worse effects, or of making no treaty at all. We preferred the first.  
					The fourth and fifth articles regulate the trade between the U. States and the British possessions in Europe By these, we are persuaded that much greater satisfaction will be given to our government and country, than by the preceding one. The three first  
						clauses of the fifth article which place the vessels and merchandize of each country in the ports of the other, in respect to duties and prohibitions, on the footing of the most favored nation, are taken from the treaty of 1794. To these we were not aware that any well  
						founded objection was ever made. But the subsequent clauses give a new character to this intercourse. The right which the British government reserved by the Treaty of 1794 to impose a tonnage-duty on American vessels equal to the duty which was payable on British vessels in  
						the U. States is, by the first of these clauses made reciprocal. Under that reservation or rather as we presume the pretext of it, the British govt. had actually imposed a tonnage duty on American vessels of 6/ 5  per ton, being almost  
						three times the amount of the duty which was payable on British vessels in the U. States. And as the U. States had expressly stipulated not to raise the duty on British vessels higher than it then was, it was out of their power, without a palpable violation of that  
						stipulation, to countervail the duty imposed by G. Britain on American vessels. But by making the reservation reciprocal the U. States have an unquestionable right to raise the duty on British vessels to the same level, wherever that may be. And by conjoining the reciprocity  
						strictly to the principle of national equality, that is an equality of tonnage-duties which shall be payable on the vessels of each party in the ports of the other, a right is reserved by each to give what preference it thinks fit within that limit to its own vessels and  
						people. At present such preference is given by our law, to the amount of  Cents p. ton, which is not only protected by this clause against any countervailing measure, other than by lessening the duty, but the right is secured to increase  
						it in the degree above stated. By this we do not wish to imply that it would be advisable to take all the advantage of this circumstance which the article admits of. The presumption is that the British govt. will, in case the treaty is ratified, repeal the additional duty on  
						American vessels, which will leave them charged in common with their own and those of every other nation with the sum of 4/ 5  per ton. Should our government think proper to raise the duty on British vessels to the same point, it may  
						perhaps be adviseable not to increase the present discrimination. The last clause of this article which stipulates that the same duties of exportation and importation shall be paid on all goods and merchandize, and that the same drawbacks and bounties shall be allowed in both  
						countries, whether the same be in British or American vessels, will it is also hoped be found of very essential advantage to the U. States. The right which G. Britain had reserved by the treaty of 1794, to countervail the difference of duty payable in the U. States on  
						European or Asiatic goods when imported in British or American vessels had been productive of very serious injury. The duties which had been imposed by the British govt. on American productions, on that principle, were so high, making in most cases a difference of  shillings per ton in favor of British vessels, that it must have been impossible in peace for our navigation to have borne it. The evil was the greater because the species of commercial warfare in which it engaged in consideration of the  
						comparative value and  of the articles subject to it, in each country, furnished no remedy. On the contrary as the principle was unfavorable the farther it was carried the worse would be it’s effect. By this clause it is presumed that the evil  
						will be completely done away, while we flatter ourselves that the stipulation in favor of drawbacks and bounties, without exposing us to any inconvenience, will be productive of some advantage.  
					It is proper to remark that we did not omit to propose an arrangement on the subject of export duties by which the U. States should at least be placed in that respect upon the footing of all other nations. The discrimination to our prejudice in the British  
						duties on exportation which took their rise in the convoy duty of the last war has undoubtedly an unkind and oppressive effect. This discrimination is found in the 43. Geo. 3. ch. 68:, a permanent act (which repealed the then existing duties, and substituted others) and in  
						the 43. Geo. 3. ch. 70. which imposes additional duties during the present war. Taking the war duty and the permanent duty together, the consumers in the U. States of certain British manufactures (for the duties in question apply only to British manufactures, and not to all  
						of them; British cotton, yarn and manufactures, and some other articles being excepted) pay 2 1/ 2 percent ad valorem more than the consumer in Europe, or within the Straights, pays on the same goods.  
					The only mode in which it could be supposed to be possible that this unpleasant distinction could be removed, was by applying to the subject the rule of the most favored nation. G. Britain was not likely in her present situation to stipulate against all  
						export duties or even to agree to a maximum. Neither was she likely by considering the actual duties as originally and even now convoy duties, and therefore in their principle applicable only to the navigation which her convoys protect, to relieve from them wholly or in part  
						such merchandize as should be carried to our country in American vessels and leave them to oppress her own tonnage, thus offering a bounty in favor of American ships against her own. The rule of the most favored nation was therefore finally suggested with a hope that it would  
						meet with no objection. It was however perseveringly opposed. We were told that the single effect of such an arrangement would be to compel G. Britain to raise the export duties against other countries, not to reduce them as to us, and that this would be of no advantage to  
						the U. States, but might be a serious embarrassment to G. Britain. It was urged on our part that, if G. Britain could not give up entirely the excess of export duty now paid by us, it did not follow that it might not be fairly distributed among the consumers of her  
						merchandize in every part of the world so as still to produce the same revenue with more regard to justice; that as her best customers we had a right to be placed upon at least an equal footing with other nations, and to complain if we were rather distinguished by the  
						peculiar burthens which she undertook to impose upon us; that the discrimination against us upon the notion, that the duty had reference to convoy, was a fallacy, since part of the discrimination was permanent, and of course a peace as well as a war duty; since we who paid  
						the duty derived no benefit from the convoy, which was professed to be the consideration of it; and since, the protection of their own trade in their own navigation being a general and national concern, there was no sound reason why the relative expence of particular convoys  
						should be allowed to suggest the relative measure of the duties, which were to supply the means of affording them. They replied to the idea of distributing the amount of the discrimination among all the consumers of their merchandize by referring us to the present state of  
						Europe. They reminded us that their own colonies in America paid the same export duty that was paid by us, and repeated that, as it was only the discrimination between the U. States and Europe of which we could have any right to complain, we could not demand to have any part  
						of the duty against which we remonstrated, withdrawn from us, and that we could gain nothing by forcing this country to add to the burthens of others, already overwhelmed and impoverished by the calamities of war. We were obliged, tho’ very reluctantly, to abandon this  
						object.  
					The sixth article relates to the commerce with the West Indies which it was found impossible to arrange in a satisfactory manner. There were many serious obstacles to an agreement on this point, some of which seemed to be peculiarly applicable to the  
						present time. The British W. India merchants had at an early stage represented that by the trade which our citizens enjoyed with the colonies of their enemies, we had so completely stocked the markets of the continent with W. India productions as to shut those markets on  
						them. They had remonstrated earnestly against any arrangement of that point which should sanction in any degree our trade with those colonies. This question had taken deep hold of the minds of a great proportion of this community, among whom may be classed, not those in the  
						mercantile line only, who were immediately engaged in the trade, but the whole commercial interest, and many in other circles of great consideration in the country. Of this fact sufficient proof was furnished by the debate which took place in the last session of Parliament on  
						the bill for regulating the intercourse between the U. States and the W. Indies. The British Commissioners seemed to have taken from that debate, more especially from the support which their opponents apparently received from the public in it, a very strong admonition not to  
						touch the subject by treaty at this time. They were apprehensive that any regulation of this trade, however fair it might be, which should accompany their sanction of that with the colonies of their enemies, would produce the worst effect with all parties and endanger any  
						treaty which might be formed. They were therefore desirous of postponing the subject for the present: to which we agreed. In the stipulation which provides for the postponement we have as you will perceive, in conformity with our instructions, reserved the right to our govt.  
						to counteract any regulations by which the British govt. may exclude us from a fair participation in that commerce. While the war lasts we shall enjoy it in a certain degree with the consent of the British govt. by necessity. And the reservation cannot fail  
						to be considered by it, as a permanent weapon of defence, to be used, when occasion calls for it. It must be seen that it will be impossible for the Congress to prohibit an intercourse between the U. States and the W. Indies in British vessels, without producing a very  
						serious effect on their whole navigation and commercial interests. We flatter ourselves therefore that it may be found practicable, and perhaps not difficult to arrange this business hereafter to the satisfaction of both countries.  
					The seventh article relates to the appointment of Consuls by each party in the territories and ports of the other. It was taken from the treaty of 1794.  
					The eighth article which specifies the causes for which vessels may be captured or detained, including among them the circumstance of their having enemies property on board is (except the last clause) a transcript of the 17. art. of the treaty of 1794. The  
						stipulation contained in that clause, that the parties shall be allowed adequate damages and charges of the trial in all cases of unfounded detention or other contravention of the regulations of the present treaty, will, we presume, produce the salutary effect contemplated by  
						it. There is perhaps no principle, in the maritime pretensions of this country, which has been more abused in practice, than that which this provision is intended to remedy. That damages should be allowed in all such cases is, it is true, a doctrine recognized by the court of  
						admiralty. It cannot however be doubted that by providing for them in the treaty, the obligation to allow them will acquire greater force with the court and even the govt. itself, while it cannot fail to give an useful admonition to the cruisers.  
					The ninth article regulates what shall be deemed contraband of war. You will observe that tar and turpentine, except when destined to a place of naval equipment, are not comprized in it, and that provisions are altogether omitted. We endeavoured to exclude  
						from it naval stores but without effect. We succeeded however in exempting the vessel on the return voyage, after depositing her cargo at the port of her destination, from being detained on the pretence, that it consisted of contraband articles.  
					The provision in the tenth article, relative to vessels sailing without knowledge of a blockade, is somewhat altered from the treaty of 1794. The precise effect of the change cannot perhaps be pronounced with certainty; but it seems to be clear that it  
						cannot be otherwise than advantageous. The alterations consist in the introduction into the preamble of &quot;the distance and other circumstances incident to the situation of the contracting parties&quot;, and of the word &quot;such&quot; into the provision which follows. The first amendment  
						appears to justify an inference that, on account of the peculiar circumstances, local and relative, thus recited as the reasons why in the opinion of the contracting parties &quot;it may frequently happen that vessels may sail for a port or place without knowing that it is  
						besieged, blockaded or invested&quot;, our vessels ought not to be liable to be judicially affected with knowledge of a blockade, so as to subject them to penalty, by the evidence usually held to be sufficient for that purpose. Sir W. Scott decided in 1799, that, in consequence of  
						the distance of the U. States from Europe, we were entitled to a more favorable rule in that respect than other countries, and our article may be fairly considered as adopting that idea and acting upon it. On the foundation of the single fact of distance Sir W. Scott  
						justified a conjectural destination from America to Amsterdam, altho the blockade of that port had been notified; and the parties concerned were proved to have known of the commencement of it. The article, as it now stands, seems necessarily to imply at least the same  
						indulgence: and, if it does, it certainly goes farther than Sir W. Scott’s opinion, which does not admit that an inquiry can be made of the blockading force, as our article unquestionably does, in the cases to which it applies. It does not appear to be unreasonable to hold  
						that, a peculiar motive being now assigned in the preamble for the provision which it introduces, a corespondent peculiar effect is contemplated by that provision; and no such effect can follow from it, if it be not that (as our distance makes it impossible &quot;that we should  
						have constant information of the state of the blockade, whether it continues, or is relaxed&quot;) the mere notification of the blockade or even the knowledge that the blockade has been commenced de facto, shall not be sufficient to make the destination illegal, but that,  
						notwithstanding such notification or knowledge, we shall receive warning at the port or place blockaded. The words &quot;without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded or invested&quot; will admit of this interpretation, since, by reason of our distance, it may in our case  
						be truly said (and has in substance been judicially said) to be one thing to know that a blockade has been notified or instituted, and another that it continues. We endeavoured without success to obtain the consent of the British Commrs. to the article proposed in your  
						project. They would only agree as you will perceive to take its preamble and engross it upon the article of 1794, observing that this would give to that article a new and more favorable, tho’ certainly an undefined character, and that, at a moment, when their maritime efforts  
						in this mode of hostility might more than ever become indispensable to the national safety, it was impossible to do more. We pressed them long and earnestly to connect with the clause a definition of blockade, to which in the early stages of our negotiation it was believed  
						there would be no objection. We found them however decidedly averse from such a definition by treaty, notwithstanding the precedent afforded by Lord St. Helen’s convention with Russia. They maintained that the British doctrine was already as explicit on this point as any  
						definition could make it, that it was difficult if not impracticable to agree upon one which should be at the same time accurate and complete; that the clause in it’s present form would do much towards the accomplishment of our object; and that what remained it would be in  
						their power, as it certainly was in their inclination, to supply, as effectually as in the treaty itself, by taking occasion to state, in a letter which it was intended should be delivered to us on their part at the time of the signature of the treaty, which you will  
						hereafter find explained, the theory and practice of the British government on this subject.  
					This reasoning was in no degree satisfactory and it was resisted accordingly, but without effect. The proposed substitute for a definition by treaty might be of some value and was not therefore opposed; but it was obvious that it would be greatly impaired  
						if not wholly destroyed by the nature of the letter of which we had received a full explanation and in which the suggested document was to be inserted.  
					The eleventh article regulates the great question of our commerce with enemies colonies, the interruption of which was one of the principal causes of the late disagreement between the two countries. We trust that the compromise which has been made on this  
						point will be advantageous to our commercial interest and satisfactory to our government. The British Commrs. were very desirous of burthening this intercourse with several severe restrictions, to place, as they did not hesitate to state, their own merchandise on an equal  
						footing, in the great markets of the continent, with those of the U. States. With that view, and to settle all questions concerning the continuity of the voyage, they proposed, that all articles of W. India produce should be stored in the U. States for the term of one month,  
						be transported thence to Europe in another ship from that in which they were brought, and be likewise subjected to a duty of at least four per cent on re-exportation. They finally agreed however to relinquish all these pretensions, except the landing of the goods in the U.  
						States and the payment (by which is understood the securing of the payment in the mode prescribed by our law) of one per cent on such European articles as may be carried thence to the colonies, and of two per cent on such W. India productions as may be carried to Europe,  
						including the parent and every other country. We are persuaded that this arrangement will be attended with less inconvenience to the parties than the other restrictions above mentioned or either of them. The storing of the goods especially for a month seemed to be peculiarly  
						objectionable, as it would have subjected us to a serious injury without being attended with any circumstances to alleviate the regret inseparable from it. We flatter ourselves that the sum agreed to be paid will not be felt as a heavy one on our merchants, whose patriotism  
						will be gratified by the recollection that the duty which they pay will redound to the advantage of their country. By the compromise which is made the practical enjoyment of the rights of each party is forborne, in the manner stated and for the term specified, while the  
						rights themselves are reserved. The stipulation being in the form of a concession on the part of G. Britain is intended to mitigate her principle where it applies but in no respect to enlarge the sphere of its operation. No judicial decision of the court of admiralty in this  
						country has hitherto extended the British principle to enemies colonies in the East Indies, and it is understood that it does not apply to the greater part, if to any, of them. Some cases are depending before it, from the vice admiralty courts of Halifax and Columbo, which  
						will bring the point into question. Should the opinion of the court be that the principle is applicable to the colony to which the cause relates, then the party will have the advantage of the provision contained in this article; should it on the contrary decide, that it does  
						not apply to such colony, then the trade between it and the parent country will be free. This view of the subject was entertained equally by the British commrs. and ourselves, and is that, as they assure us, which the court of admiralty will adopt in its decisions. We  
						endeavoured to exempt this branch of the trade with enemies colonies from the operation of the British principle; but that was found to be impracticable. We flatter ourselves that the arrangement made respecting it will be deemed the next most eligible one that could have  
						been adopted, and that it will produce in practice, in a great measure, if not altogether, the same effect.  
					The twelfth article establishes the maritime jurisdiction of the U. States to the distance of five marine miles from their coast in favor of their own vessels and the unarmed vessels of all other powers who may acknowledge the same limit. This govt.  
						contended that three marine miles was the greatest extent, to which the pretension could be carried by the law of nations, and resisted, at the instance of the admiralty and the law officers of the crown in Doctors Commons, the concession which was supposed to be made by this  
						arrangement with great earnestness. The Ministry seemed to view our claim in the light of an innovation of dangerous tendency, whose admission, especially at the present time, might be deemed an act unworthy of the government. The outrages lately committed on our coast, which  
						made some provision of the kind necessary as an useful lesson to the commanders of their squadrons, and a reparation for the insults offered to our govt., encreased the difficulty of obtaining any accommodation whatever. The British commrs. did not fail to represent that  
						which is contained in this article as a strong proof of a conciliating disposition in their govt. towards the govt. and people of the U. States. The limit established was not so extensive as that which we had contended for and expected to have obtained. We persuade ourselves  
						however that the great object which was contemplated by any arrangement of the subject will result from that which has been made. The article in the treaty, in connexion with the causes which produced it, forms an interesting occurrence in the history of our country which  
						cannot fail to produce the most salutary consequences. It is fair to presume that the sentiment of respect which G. Britain has shewn by this measure for the U. States will be felt and observed in future by her squadrons in their conduct, on our coast, and in our bays and  
						harbours. It is equally fair to presume that the example of consideration which it affords in their favor by a nation so vastly preponderant at sea, will be followed by other powers.  
					By the thirteenth article it is agreed that the sum for which bonds shall be given by the commanders of privateers before they receive their commission, to indemnify those who shall be injured by their misconduct, shall be increased to a greater amount than  
						was required by the 19th. article of the treaty of 1794. It is also enjoined in stronger and more definite terms on the belligerent, in this than in the former article, to see that it’s ships of war and privateers shall observe in a manner the most favorable to neutrals the  
						acknowledged principles and rules of the law of nations in the search of merchant vessels. We endeavoured to obtain an arrangement more adequate to the object, and relinquished the pursuit of it with regret. While the subject of visitation and search was under consideration  
						the British commrs. assured us that their govt. would regulate it in a satisfactory manner to the U. States by Act of Parliament, especially in respect to privateers; which assurance was repeated when the treaty was signed.  
					The following articles to the twenty first inclusive are taken from the treaty of 1794. The British Commrs. shewed a desire to retain them, and, as it appeared that they had in substance been introduced into the Treaty with France of 1801, and that an  
						attempt on our part to omit them would be thought unaccommodating and captious, we agreed to them.  
					The twenty second article contains a new and useful provision in favor of the unfortunate in the case of shipwreck.  
					The twenty third article, after declaring that it is the intention of the high contracting parties that the people of their respective dominions shall be on the footing of the most favored nations, stipulates that in case either of the parties shall  
						hereafter grant any additional advantages in navigation or commerce to any other nation, the citizens or subjects of the other party shall fully participate in them. This article is deemed particularly important in many views, but more especially in it’s application to the  
						British possessions in the E. Indies. If it can be shewn that any peculiar accomodation is or shall be hereafter granted to any other powers we become entitled to it of course.  
					The twenty-fourth article engages that the parties shall communicate to each other the laws which their respective legislatures may enact for the abolition or limitation of the African slave trade, and that they will also use their best endeavors to procure  
						the co-operation of other powers for the complete abolition of that trade. As this engagement reposes on our laws, it follows that it does not enjoin any obligation unknown to them. If it should be acted on at all by our govt., farther than by communicating to this the laws  
						of Congress, as is proposed in the first part of the article, the sphere of its operation would be a very contracted one till the year 1808. After that period such a co-operation on a more enlarged scale would become a constitutional measure of the govt., and as we think a  
						suitable one. Mr. Fox had taken great interest in this question, and it is understood that in suggesting the idea, in the address of the house of Commons to the King, of obtaining the co-operation of other powers, the U. States were held particularly in view. The British  
						Commrs. proposed the article and shewed great desire that we should agree to it. As this stipulation was not comprized within the scope of our instructions, we have thought it our duty to explain to you the cause to which its admission into the treaty is to be attributed.  
					The twenty fifth article was introduced for the purpose of protecting other powers having treaties with either party, in the enjoyment of the rights secured by them. The stipulation contained in our treaty with France in 1803, of certain commercial  
						priviledges in favor of French and Spanish subjects for a defined term in Louisiana, made such a provision particularly necessary  
					The twenty sixth article fixes the term of the treaty at ten years from the date of the exchange of the ratifications.  
					We are sorry to add that this treaty contains no provision against the impressment of our seamen. Our dispatch of the 11. of Novr. communicated to you the result of our labours on that subject, and our opinion that altho’ this govt. did not feel itself at  
						liberty to relinquish formally by treaty it’s claim to search our merchant vessels for British Seamen, it’s practice would nevertheless be essentially if not completely abandoned. That opinion has been since confirmed by frequent conferences on the subject with the British  
						commrs., who have repeatedly assured us that in their judgement we were made as secure against the exercise of their pretension by the policy, which their govt. had adopted in regard to that very delicate and important question, as we could have been made by treaty. It is  
						proper to observe however that the good effect of this disposition and its continuance may depend in a great measure on the means which may be taken by the Congress hereafter to check desertions from the British service. If the treaty is ratified, and a perfect good  
						understanding produced by it between the two countries, it will be easy for their governments by friendly communications to state to each other what they respectively desire and in that mode to arrange the business as satisfactorily, as it could be done by  
						treaty.  
					We regret also to be under the necessity of stating that no provision has been made by the treaty to indemnify our citizens for their losses by the late seizures and other violations of the law of nations. This object engaged our attention in every stage of  
						the negotiation, and was not abandoned by the signature of the treaty. On the day it was signed we stated in explicit terms to the British commrs. that we could not conclude without having a satisfactory assurance by them of the part their govt. intended to take equally in  
						regard to the vessels and cargoes which had been condemned and the suits that were depending. The principle established in the correspondence between Mr. King &amp; Lord Hawkesbury we admitted should form the bounda of our claim in respect to the seizures for an imputed  
						illegal trade, for every violation of which in cases of condemnation we expected a full indemnity, and a dismission of all the causes still depending that were protected by it. The British commrs. observed that it was neither their wish nor expectation that we should  
						relinquish our claim; on the contrary they were willing we should preserve it: with which view they proposed that we should present them a paper, bearing date prior to the signature, which should make the reservation in such form as we thought best suited to the object. They  
						intimated that in cases of vested right it was not in the power of their govt. to interfere to the prejudice of the parties, and that it wou’d be hard on the govt. and unpopular in the ministry to apply the public mony to such a purpose; still they said nothing to preclude  
						that expectation, on the contrary they encouraged it, and were still more explicit in suggesting that the depending cases would not be unfavorably adjudged. They seemed desirous that, while we should resume our claim, their government should retain a right to pursue such a  
						course of conduct in regard to it as might be dictated hereafter by circumstances. To enter into an engagement in favor of our claim in the present state of things appeared to them as being likely to expose their govt. to the imputation of having done it by coercion, and to  
						deprive it of a claim to any merit for such an accommodation as it might under other circumstances be disposed to yeild. Should the circumstances of collision which had taken place between the two countries be done away, and their commerce and friendly relations be  
						re-established, as they hoped was already in a great measure done, and would be so completely by this treaty, their govt. they thought would feell itself more at liberty to yeild accommodations on this topic than in the actual state. This was the substance of the  
						communication made us on this subject by the British commrs. before the signature of the treaty, on which and our declaring explicitly that we would reserve the right in the manner they had proposed in full confidence that their govt. would respect it, we proceeded to sign  
						the treaty. We have had an interview with the British commrs. since the signature, and were happy to find that they had not forgotten what had passed between us on that occasion. We had asked the interview, as we informed them, for the purpose of conferring on this subject,  
						and of obtaining their sentiments in so distinct a form, as to leave us under no embarrassment in the communication it was our duty to make to you on it. Nothing passed in this interview on their part to change the ground on which the business had been placed in the former  
						one. They intimated however that it might be advantageous, and would certainly be proper for us, in the present stage, to confer with Lord Howick on this subject, since any declaration from him could not fail, according to it’s import, to merit the peculiar attention of our  
						government. We have accordingly seen and conferred with Lord Howick upon this topic, whose sentiments appeared to correspond strictly with those which had been delivered to us by the British commrs. He intimated however that it would be better for us to address the note which  
						should contain a reservation of our rights to indemnity, to him than to the Commrs., to which we assented, as we could not perceive that that circumstance would make any difference in the case. We are engaged in preparing this paper which we now expect to present to his  
						Lordship in a few days, tho we fear it will not be ready in time to enable us to obtain his answer to it to be forwarded to you with this dispatch. We shall not fail to communicate to you without delay whatever may occur on this subject. We think it our duty however to add  
						that we do not wish our govt. to be too sanguine in the expectation of a satisfactory result. In the deliberations on this subject it may perhaps be better to presume that such a one may not be obtained, as it is not provided for in the treaty. The above statement is  
						nevertheless perfectly correct, and we beg you to be assured that we shall continue to exert our best endeavors to secure an object which we consider of so much importance. We shall send you a statement of the cases of condemnation, and of the causes still depending, which is  
						less extensive in both views than may have been supposed.  
					It happened, when the negotiation had reached a very advanced stage, that an account was received here of the decree of the Emperor of the French at Berlin of Nov. 21., which declared G. Britain and Ireland in a state of blockade, and all British  
						manufactures and the produce of British colonies lawful prize. This circumstance produced a strong impression on this govt., which was very seriously felt in our concerns. It seemed probable for some days that it would subject the negotiation to a long suspension, if it did  
						not entirely defeat its object. The British commrs. informed us that the decree of the govt. of France had opposed a powerful obstacle to the conclusion of any treaty with us, before our govt. should be consulted on the subject, and it’s answer obtained as to the part it  
						might take in regard to it: that in case the U. States submitted to a violation of their neutral rights by France in the manner contemplated by that decree, it would be impossible for G. Britain to respect them: that by concluding a treaty with the U. States, by which they  
						should not only bind themselves to the observance of such rights, but agree to concessions or relaxations of what they conceived to be their unquestionable rights of war, after knowing the contents of that decree, they might be understood to restrain themselves from  
						counteracting the policy of France, which it would be improper to do, unless our govt. should engage to support its rights against the measures of France. In consideration of these circumstances they proposed that we should proceed in the business so far as to agree on all  
						the articles of the treaty, to reduce them to form, and then transmit the instrument to the U. States, to become obligatory in case our govt. should enter into a satisfactory engagement of the kind proposed. We replied in very explicit terms to the British commrs. that we  
						considered their proposition altogether inadmissible on our part, and not likely to accomplish, if we could agree to it, the object which they contemplated by it: that such a proposition to our government, under the circumstances attending it, would amount, in substance to an  
						offer to it of the alternative between the treaty and a war with France, since if our govt. refused to give the satisfaction which they desired, the treaty would be lost; and if such satisfaction was given and the treaty concluded, and France should persist to execute her  
						decree, according to the construction given of it here, war seemed to be inevitable; that if it should happen that our govt. should approve the treaty it was not to be presumed that it would make any sacrifice, or stipulate anything not contained in the instrument, especially  
						so very important an act as that alluded to, as the condition on which it was to be obtained: that the arrangement of our differences and other concerns with G. Britain was an affair which rested on it’s own ground, and had no connexion with our relations with France: that  
						his Majesty’s government ought to suppose that the U. States would not fail in any case to support with becoming dignity their rights with any power, and that it must be sensible that it would be more at liberty to enter into suitable friendly explanations with the govt. of  
						France on the subject of the decree in question, after the adjustment of their differences with G. Britain than while they existed, as it likewise must be that the prospect of obtaining satisfactory explanations on that point of France would be better while they acted under  
						their own impulse as an independant and friendly power than it would be in case they entered into an engagement of the kind proposed with her adversary. The British Commrs. admitted that these considerations were entitled to much attention: at length however after the subject  
						had been, as we had reason to believe, maturely weighed in the Cabinet, they informed us that their government still thought it incumbent on it to make a reservation of their right to counteract the policy of France in case our govt. did not give them the satisfaction they  
						desired, either by suitable assurances before the ratification of the treaty or by it’s conduct afterwards. With this view they presented us a paper which we have the honor to transmit with this dispatch. In transmitting to you this paper it is our duty to observe that we do  
						not consider ourselves a party to it, or as having given it in any the slightest degree our sanction. The incident which produced the paper was unexpected on our part, and without entering into its merits we used our best exertions to diminish it’s effect in relation to the  
						objects of our negotiation. The British Commrs. brought the incident into view, and made it the subject of discussion in the manner above stated, as they did the part which it became their govt. to take in the depending negotiation in consequence of it. We therefore thought,  
						not only that we were at liberty but that it was imperiously our duty, to use our best exertions to make the paper which they proposed to present to us, in reference to the degree of France, as little injurious as possible, and even to urge that decree as a strong reason why  
						G. Britain should be more explicit and satisfactory in her definition of neutral rights, as well for the purpose of vindicating herself against the strong denunciation it contained, as to enable our govt. to urge with more force with the govt. of France, it’s objections to  
						the decree. We were glad to find that these remarks were not altogether without effect, as will appear by the paper referred to, especially the definition it gives of a blockade, which is tolerably correct.  
					You will observe that the commerce between the U. States and the British colonies which bound them to the East and North, has not been regulated by this treaty. The British commrs. refused to agree to any arrangement of it in consequence of our declining to  
						admit their Canada and Hudson Bay traders into Louisiana. It has occurred to us that it might be advantageous to the U. States and consistent with the views of our govt. to comprize both these objects, under suitable regulations, in a separate Convention, especially if they  
						can be made instrumental to a satisfactory establishment of our boundaries. We have reason to think that in the form of a new act, in connection with these other objects, it would be more agreeable to this govt. to settle the question of boundary, according to the views of  
						the President and Senate, than by ratifying the Convention already entered into with the exception of the 5th: article. The British Commrs. have expressed their willingness to proceed in the business for the purpose of arranging all these topics in a satisfactory manner, as  
						Lord Howick has likewise done; and it seems to be highly important to take advantage of this disposition to settle amicably with this govt. at the present time every remaining cause of strife, so far as it may be practicable. Should we undertake to form such a convention, the  
						commercial part of it will of course be limited to the same term, not to exceed that of the treaty. We shall also be attentive to the conditions on which the traders with the Indian tribes are to be admitted into Louisiana; by being particularly careful that it be done on  
						such conditions as to render it impossible for them to do any injury. We are persuaded that such regulations might be adopted, as would even at this time have that effect. We are confident that our population will have so far spread over the whole surface of that country, by  
						the time the treaty would expire, as to supercede the necessity of renewing it. We have the honor to be with great consideration &amp; esteem, Sir Your most obedient Servts

LETTER  
Of Messrs. Monroe and Pinckney to  
Mr. Madison, accompanying the  
treaty concluded on the 3\st of De­  
cember, 1806.  
LovnoN, Jan. 3, 1807.  
(Continued. )  
The only mode in which it could be  
supposed to be possible that this tin-,  
pleasant distinction could be removed, |  
was by applying to the subject the  
rule of the most favored nation.  
Great Britain was not likely in her  
! present situation, to stipulate against  
all export duties, or even to agree to  
a maximum. Neither was she likely  
}by considering the actual duties, as  
| originally &amp; even now convoy duties  
i and therefore in their principle appv.-  
I cable only to ihe navigation which her  
| convoys protect, to relieve iron) them  
I wholly or in part such merchandize  
• as should be carried to our country in  
American vessels, and leave them to  
oppress her own tonnage : thus offer*­  
-1 ing a bounty in favor of American  
j ships against her own. The rule of  
l the most favored nation was therefore  
i finally suggested with a hope that it  
would meet with no objection. It  
was however persevcringly opposed.  
We were told that the single effect  
of such an arrangement would be lot  
compel Great Britain to raise tin  
port duties against other countries, not  
;to reduce them as to us, and that this  
would be of no advantage to the Unit­  
ed States, but might be a serious em­  
barrassment to G.eat Britain. It was  
urged on our part that if Great Britain  
could not give up entirely the excess  
of export duty now paid by us, it did  
not follow that it might not be fairly  
distributed among the consumers of  
her merchandize in every part of the  
world, so as still to produce the same  
revenue with more regard to justice ;  
that a* her best customers, we had a  
  
rigtit to be placed upon at least en.  
equal footing with other nations, md  
to complain if we were rather dis­  
tinguished by the peculiar  
which she undertook to impose upou  
us ; that the discrimination i  
upon the notion that the duty had re­  
ference to convoy was a fallacy, since  
part of the discrimination was perma­  
nent and of course a peace As well as*  
a war duty, since we who paid the  
duty derived no benefit from the con­  
voy which was professed lo be the  
consideration of it, and since the pro­  
tection of their own trade in thcEown  
11 n igaiion being a general ai  
al concern, there was no sound reason  
why the relative expense of particu­  
lar convoys should ]-  
gesi the relative me isur&lt; of the du­  
des, which were to supply the means  
ot affording thent. They replied to  
the idea of distributing the amount of  
tne discrimination among all the con­  
sumers of their nietchaniiize by re­  
ferring us to ihe present sta&#x27;e oi Eu­  
rope. They reminded us that their  
own colonies in America paid the  
same export duty that was paid by us,  
and repeated thai as it was only the  
discrimination between the U. Stales  
and Europe, of which we could not  
demand to have any part of the duty  
against which we have any right to  
complain withdrawn from us, and we  
coulu gain nothing by forcing this  
country to add to the burthens of o­  
thers already ovcrwhelnud and im­  
poverished by the calamities of war.  
We were obliged though very reluc­  
tantly to abandon this object.  
The sixth ar icle relates to die  
commerce with the W. Indies, which  
it was found impossible to arrange in  
a satisfactory manner. There were  
many serious obstacles to an agree­  
ment on this point, some of which  
seemed lo be peculiarly applicable lo  
the present time. The British \&gt; est  
India merchants had, at an early stage,  
represented that by the trade which  
our citizens enjoyed with the colo­  
nies of their enemies, we had so com­  
pletely stocked the markets of the  
continent with West-lluiia produc­  
tions, as to shut those markets on  
them. They had remonstrated ear­  
nestly against any arrangement of  
that point, which should sanction, in  
any degree, our trade with those, co­  
lonies. This question had taken deep  
hoid of the mint sofa great proportion  
of mis community, among whom may  
be classed, not those in the me-can­  
tile only, who were immediately en­  
gaged in the trade, but the whole  
commercial interest, and many in  
other circles of great consideration  
in the country. Of this fact sufficient  
proof was furnished by the debate  
which look place in the Est session of  
parliament, on the bill for regulating  
the intercourse between the Eaiited  
States and the West Indies. ihe  
British comnii.sioners seemed to  
have taken from that debate, more  
especially from the support which,  
their opponents apparently received  
from the public, a very strong admo­  
nition not to touch tin- subject by trea­  
ty at this time. They were appre­  
hensive Unit any regulation ot this  
trade, however fair E might be, which  
should accompany their sanction of  
that with ihe colonies of their ene­  
mies, would produce tiie worst effect.  
with all parties, and endanger any  
treaty which might be formed. They  
were therelore desirous of postpon­  
ing the subject for the present ; to  
which we agreed. In the stipulation  
whitn provides for the postponement}  
we have, as you wi.l perceive, in con­  
formity with our instructions, reset v­  
ed the right to our government to  
counteract any regulations by which  
the British government may exclude  
us horn a fair participation in that  
commerce. While the v. ar lasts we  
shall enjoy it in a certain degree by  
the consent of the British govern­  
ment, by necessity. And the reser­  
vation cannot fail to be considered by­  
it as a powerful weapon of d_ fence, lo be  
used, when occasion calls for it. It most  
be seen that it win be impossible for  
the Congress to pronibit an inter­  
course between the United States  
and the West Indies in British vessels,  
without producing a very serious ef­  
fect on their whole navigation and  
commercial interests. We flatter  
ourselves therefore., that if may be  
found practicable, and perhaps net  
iiiihcui. to ai range this business h  
after, to the satisfaction of both coun­  
tries.  
The seventh article relates to the  
appointment of consuls by each parly  
:in the territories and ports of tlie  
oiher. It was taken from the treaty  
of 1794

No.&#x27;8. London, January 3, 1807.  
SIR,  
We have the honor to transmit you a  
treaty, which wc concluded with the British  
commissioners, on the 31st of December.  
Although we had entertained great confi­  
dence from the Commencement o&#x27; the nego­  
tiation, that such would be its result, it was  
not until the 27th, that we were able to make  
any satisfactory arrangement of several of  
the most important points, that were invol­  
ved in it. On tlic next day, we communica­  
ted to you that event by several dispatches,  
three of which were forwarded by vessels  
from Liverpool, so that we hope you will re­  
ceive very early intelligence of it. We com­  
mit this, with the treaty, to Mr. Purviance,  
who, we flatter ourselves, will have the good  
fortune to arrive iu time to deliver it to you  
before the adjournment of congress.  
The necessity we feel ourselvet, under, to  
forward to you the treaty without delay, will,  
we fear, render it impossible for us to enter  
so fully on the subject of it, as on many con­  
siderations it might be proper to do. We  
are aware that such instruments must be  
construed, by an impartial view of their con­  
  
iL iua uij imiuciKai uy CAuaiu;uua nidUL i .—  
A knowledge however of the sense in which  
the several articles of a treaty were under­  
stood by the parties to it, may in most cases  
be useful. It is also just to remark that some  
circumstances occurred in the course of this  
negotiation, which, although they do not ap­  
pear on the face of the instrument itself,  
vet as they may have no inconsiderable influ­  
ence on the future relations of the two coun­  
tries, it is pecularly important to explain.  
We shall endeavor to give such explanations  
where they may be necessary, in the best  
manner that may be found compatible with  
the dispatch which the occasion so imperious­  
ly requires, and we flatter ourselves without  
omitting any tiling on any point that maybe  
deemed of essential importance.  
The first article of the pesent treaty which  
stipulates that peace shall subsist between  
the parties is taken from that of 1794, and is  
found in most of the modern treaties.  
The second article confirms those of aper­  
manent nature in the treaty of 1794. The  
British commissioners were very desirous  
to introduce the permanent articles of that  
treaty in the form of new stipulations, in the  
present one. They insisted with great ear­  
nestness that the article which relates to the  
trade with the Indian tribes, should be soa­  
mended as to admit the traders of Canada  
and the Hudson bay company to participate  
with us in the trade, with the tribes in Lou­  
isiana. They seemed to admit that by a  
fair construction of the article they could not  
support such a claim, but contended that it  
was justified by its spirit. Their solicitude  
on this point, which they had supposed wa9  
an unimportant one to the U. States, creat­  
ed some embarrassment and delay in the bu­  
siness. They intimated that it proceeded  
from a desire to conciliate the public opinion  
in this country in favor of the treaty,  
which beGame necessary in consequence of  
the concessions which they thought they made  
us on other points. As we were decidedly of  
opinion that the article in the treaty of 1794  
could not apply to territory afterwards acqui­  
red, and could see nothing in its spirit which  
entitled it to such an extension, and more  
  
especially as our instructions contemplated  
a different result, it was impossible for us  
to ddopt that proposal. They finally agreed  
therefore, though not without evident reluc­  
tance, to the article in its present form.  
VVc regret to say that the third article  
which regulates our trade with the British  
possessions in India, which, with one essen­  
tial and most unfavorable difference, is the  
same with the thirteenth article of the trea­  
ty of 1794, is not what wc had been led to  
hope it would be practicable to make it. A­  
ware of the importance attached to this com­  
merce in America, we have used the most  
zealous and preserving efforts, not only to  
prevent the introduction of new restraints up­  
on it, but even to emancipate it front some  
of those which the treaty of 1794, had dis­  
tinctly sanctioned. The India company have  
however been less nccomodatiugthan was at  
first expected, and hence the rejection of all  
the amendments proposed by us, one of which  
sought to omit entirely, and (when that was  
refused) to modify, the proviso copied from  
the treaty of 1794, that our voyages from the  
British possessions should be direct to the U.  
States. &#x27;This amendment, in both its shapes,  
was repelled In such a manner astoconvince  
us that nothing would be gained by continu­  
ing to press it, and we gave it up at length  
with great reluctance. In this stage of the  
| business, the British commissioners insisted  
upon an amendment upon their part, by which  
our voyages to British India were required  
to be direct from the U. Slates. This unex­  
  
pecto-u amendment was proposed, at the in­  
stance of the India Company, after the pro­  
ject of the llritish commissioners (which,  
witli reference to this subject, was a literal  
copv of the loth article of the treaty of 1794)  
  
had not only been presented to us, but fully  
discussed, and, as wc understood, settled.—  
The real intention and office of it were said,  
by lord Holland Hi lord Auckland, to be no  
more than to make the article speak unequi­  
vocally what was the true meaning of the arti­  
cle in the late treaty. We replied to this that  
the article in the late treaty was not suscep­  
tible of this limited construction; that its  
obvious import wasthat only the \oy age from  
India tUoun be direct; that this had been so­  
lemnly adjudged by their own courts of law  
and that the practice had been and still con­  
tinued to be so.  
We v.cre answered by the production of  
•. paper purporting to be a report of  
that in their opinion an American vessel  
was not entitled to a clearance from a port  
in Great-Hritain to Calcutta, under the trea  
ty ol 1794. Wc were told moreover, that  
lord Grenville when he made the treaty,&#x27;  
  
the India company when it sanctioned, and  
the .British government when it ratified it,  
did not mean to authorize any other than di­  
rect voyages, outward, as well as homeward  
between the United States and their Indian  
possessions and that if die treaty was lia­  
ble to any other construction, it arose from  
mere inadvertence in adjusting the phrase­  
ology ; but that in truth it was not a lair and  
natural iutcrpreUtion cf words, which au­  
thorized a commerce between two defined  
limits ; that a commerce between one of those  
limits and some t^ird place was intended to  
be allowed, althotig h not a word was said a­  
bout it in the article. Having given the ob­  
vious answer tot hoe suggestions, we urged,  
as long and as zcabusly us was thought ad­  
visable, the inconveniences to which our  
trade with India wiuld be su./jected, by pro­  
hibiting any of the {nodes in which it was  
prosecuted, as well as the unfriendly appear­  
ance of the new restriction, for which there  
existed no a&lt;l*&lt;ju«:e motive. We spoke Oi  
i the sensibility which wouVI be excited in  
! out* country by such an ill-ti^cd and uugra­  
icious interference, the intetests which i.  
would affect, and the passitns which, it  
would inlist against the entire tmatv : to all  
which it was finally answered thi* the India  
| company could not be prevailed u&gt;on to re­  
lax upon this point: that moreover it ought  
not to be forgotten that this was a trade  
from which their own subjects werfiordina­  
&#x27; rilv excluded in favor of the compares mo­  
nopoly ; that this monopoly, as a lositg con­  
cern, seemed at pretent to require peculiar  
protection ; that our admission into British  
1 India at all, was a boon for which we dilnot  
  
; and could not give any equivalent, aal of  
! course that we could not justly complain; ii  
i that&#x27;admission was somewhat qualified with  
a view to the mitigation of the evils by which  
j it was undoubtedly attended, and which i\
i was not possible wholly to prevent; especially  
i if wc were not placed upon a more disad­  
i vantageous footing ir that respect than other  
i friendly powers, which was so far from be­  
ing the case, that ve were unquestionably  
admitted by the artcle, as they proposed to  
amend it, upon much better terms than any  
other nation, inasnuch as our commerce  
i (exclusive of the advantage of being secured  
by treaty) would b; subcct only to British  
duties, whereas the Danes and Swedes paid  
alien duties to a coasiderable amount, with­  
out enjoying any privilege, (whatever might  
be said t® the contrary) to which we were  
not equally entitled. We were at last re­  
duced to the necessity of accepting the ar­  
ticle with the obnoxious amendment, ren­  
dered less obnoxious, perhaps, by the clause  
relative to the mos: favored nation, or ma­  
king a treaty without any article upon the  
subject, which would have the same, and  
propably worse effects, or of making no trea­  
ty at ail. We preferred the first.  
The fourth and fifth articles regulate the  
trade between the United States and the  
British possessions in Europe. By these w*  
are persuaded that much greater satisfacti­  
on will be given to our government and coun­  
try, than by tlie preceding one. The three  
first clauses of the fifth article, which place  
the vessels and merchandise of each countr&gt;  
in the ports of che other, in respect to duties  
and prohibitions, on the footing of the most  
favored nation, are taken from the treaty of  
1794. To these we were not aware that any  
well founded objection ’••.sever made. But  
the subsequent clauses g vc a new character  
to this intercourse. The right which the  
British government reserved by the treaty  
of 1794 to impose a tonnage duty on Ame­  
rican vessels equal to the duty which was  
payable on British vessels in the United  
States, is by the first of these clauses, made  
reciprocal. Under that reservation, or ra­  
ther as we presume the pretext of it,  
the British government had actually impo­  
  
sea a tonnage uuty on American vessels oi  
6#. 5d. per ton, being almost three times  
the amount of the fluty •which was payable  
on British vessels in the United States. And  
as the United States had expressly stipula­  
ted not to raise the duty on British vessels  
higher than it then was, it was out of their  
power, without a palpable violation of that  
stipulation, to countervail the duty imposed  
by Great-Britain on American vesse&#x27;s. But  
by making the reservation reciprocal, the  
United States have an unquestionable right  
to raise the duty on British vessels to the  
same level, wherever that maybe. And by  
confining the reciprocity strictly to the prin­  
ciple of national equality, that is, an equa­  
lity of tonnage duties which shall be paya­  
ble on the vessels of each party in the ports  
of the other, a right is reserved by each to  
give what preference it thinks fit, within  
that limit, to its own vessels and people.  
At present such preference is given by our  
law to the amount of forty-four cents per ton,  
which is not only protected by this clause a­  
gainst any countervailing measure, other  
than by lessening the duty, but the right is  
secured to increase it in the degree above  
stated. By this we do not wish to imply  
that it would be advisable to take all the  
advantage of this circumstance which the  
article admits of. The presumption is, that  
the British government will, in case the trea­  
ty is ratified, repeal the additional duty on  
American vessels, which will leave them  
charged in aommon with their own, anti  
those of every other nation, with the sum ol  
  
4*. 5a. per ton. should our government  
think, proper to raise the duty on British  
vessels to the same point, it may, perhaps,  
he advisable not to increase the present dis­  
crimination. The last clause of this article,  
which stipulates that the same duties of ex  
portatiou and importation shall he paid or  
all goods and merchandise, and that tlu  
same drawbacks and bounties shall be allow­  
ed in both countries, where the same be  
in British or American vessels, will, it h  
also hoped, be found of very essential aelvan  
tape tothe United States. The right whicl  
(ireat-Britain had reserved by the treaty o  
1794, to countervail the difference of dut}  
payable in the United States on Europe a i  
and Asiatic goods, when imported in Hritisl  
or American vessels, had been productive  
of very serious injury. The duties whicl  
had been imposed by the British governmen  
on American productions, on that principle  
were so high, making in most cases a differ  
encc of fthillirgr* per ton, in favor o  
British vessels, tlnijAt must have been im  
possible in peAceJ^^&#x27;tr navigation lo havi  
  
borno it. The evil was the greater, because  
the species of&quot; commercial warfare in which  
it engaged us in consideration of the com­  
parative value and bulk of the articles sub­  
ject to it. in each country, furnished no re­  
medy. On the contrary, as the principle  
was unfavorable, the farther it was carried  
the worse would be its effect. By this clause  
it is presumed that the evil will be com­  
pletely done away, while we flatter our­  
selves that the stipulation in favor of draw­  
backs and bountie*, without exposing us to  
any inconvenience, will be productive of  
som- advantage.  
It is proper to remark that we did not  
omit to propose an arrangement on the sub­  
ject of export duties, by which the United  
States should at least be placed in that re­  
spect upon the footing of all other nations.  
The discrimination to our prejudice in the  
British duties on exportation, which took  
their rise in the convoy duty of the last War,1  
has undoubtedly an unkind and oppressive  
effect. This discrimination is found in the  
43. Geo. 3. ch. 68, a permanent act, (which  
ropcalct! the then existing duties, and sub­  
stituted others&#x27;) and in the 43. Geo. 3. ch. 70  
which imposes additional duties during the  
present war. Taking the war duty and the  
permanent duty together, the consumers in  
the United States of certain British manufac­  
tures [for the duties ih question apply only  
to British manufactures, and not to all of  
them ; British cotton-yarn and manufac­  
tures, and some other articles being except­  
ed] pay two and a half per cent, ad valorem,  
more than the consumer in Europe, or with­  
in the streights, pays on the same goods.  
The only movie in which it could be sup­  
posed to be possible, that this unplea .ant  
distinction could be removed was by applying  
to the subject the rule of the most favored  
nation. Great-Britain was not likely in her  
nresent situation to stinnlate atrainst all ex  
  
port duties, or even to agree to a maximum.  
Neither was she likely, by considering the  
actual duties as originally, a.id even n«w  
convoy duties, and therefore in their princi­  
ple applicable only to the navigation which  
her convoys protect, to relieve from them  
wholly or in part, such merchandize as  
should be carried to our country in Ameri­  
can vessels, and leave them to oppress her  
own tonnage : thus offering a bounty in favor  
of American ships against her own. The  
rule of the most favored nation was there­  
fore finally suggested, with a hope that it  
would meet with no objection. It was how­  
ever, pers veringly opposed. We were told  
that ihe single effect of such an arrangement,  
would be to compel Great-Brrtain to raise  
the export duties against other countries,  
not to reduce them as to us, and that this  
would be of no advantage to the United  
•States, but might be a serious embarrass­  
ment to Great-Britain. It was urged on our  
p i t that if Cl. Britain could not gi\e up en­  
tirely the excess of export duty, noar paid  
by us, it did not follow that it might not lie  
fairly distributed among the consumers of  
her merchandize, in every part of the world  
so stili to produce the same revenue, with  
more regard to justice : that as her best cus­  
tomers, we had a right to be placed upon at  
least an equal footing with other nations, &amp;  
&#x27;to tomplain if we were rather distinguished  
by the peculiar burthens which she under­  
took to impose upon us ; that the discrimi­  
nation against us upon the notion, that the  
duty had reference to convoy, was a fallacy,  
snee part of the discrimination was perma­  
nent, and of course a peace, as well us a war  
duty; since we, who paid the duty, derived  
nio benefit from the convoy, which was pro­  
fessed to lie the consideration of it ; and  
since the protection of their own trade, in  
their own navigation, being a general and  
  
national concern, mere was no sounu reason  
why the relative expencu of particular con­  
voys should be allowed to suggest the rela­  
tive measure of the duties, which were to  
supply the means of affording them. They  
replied to the idea of distributing the a­  
mount of the discrimination among all the  
consumers of their merchandize, hy refer­  
ring us to the present state of Europe.—  
They reminded us that their own colonies in  
America paid the same export duty that was  
paid by us, and repeated that, as it was only  
the discrimination be&#x27;ween the United States  
  
and Europe, of &quot;which wc could have any  
right to complain, wc could not demand to  
have any part of the duty against which we  
remonstrated, withdrawn from, and that wc  
could gain nothing by forcing this country to  
add to the burthens of others, already over­  
whelmed arid impoverished by the calami­  
ties of war. We were &#x27; hligcd, though very  
reluctantly, to abandon this object.  
The sixth article relates to the commerce  
with the West Indies, which it was found  
impossible to arrange in a satisfactory man­  
ner. There were many serious obstacles to  
an agreement on this point, some of which  
seemed to be peculiarly applicable to the  
present time. The British West-India mer­  
chants, had at an early stage represented,  
that by the trade which our citizens enjoyed  
with the colonics of their enemies, wc had so  
completely stocked the markets of the con­  
tinent with West-India productions, as to  
shut those markets on them. They had re­  
monstrated earnestly against any arrange­  
ment of that point which should sanction, in  
any degree, our trade with those colonies.  
This question had taken deep hold of the  
minds of a great proportion of this commu­  
nity, among whom may be classed, not those  
in the mercantile line only, who were imme­  
diately engaged in the trade, but the whole  
commercial interest, and many in other cir­  
cles of great consideration in the country  
Of this fact, sufficient proof j,was furnished  
by the debate which took place in the last  
session of parliament, on the bill for regula­  
ting the intercourse between the United  
States and the West-Indies. The British  
i commissioners seemed to have taken from  
f that debate, more especially from the sup­  
port which their opponents apparently recei­  
i ved from the public in it, a very strong ad­  
i monition not to touch the subject by treaty at  
■ this time. They were apprehensive that a­  
i »y regulation of this trade, however fair it  
t might be, which should accompany tluir  
, sanction of that with the colonies of their en­  
- sillies, would produce the worst effect with  
f all parties and endanger any treaty which  
- might he formed. They were, tlierefoi e, dc­  
: sirous of postponing the subject lor lU« pre*  
  
scut f to which we agreed. In the stimulati­  
on which provides for the postponement, we  
have, as you will perceive, in conformity with  
our instructions, reserved the right &quot;to our  
government to counteract any regulations by  
which the British government may exclude  
us from a fair participation in that commerce  
— \v hile the war lasts, we shall enjoy it in  
a certain degree with the consent of the Bri­  
tish government by necessity. And the re­  
servation cannot fail to be considered bv it  
as a powerful weapon of defence, to be usde  
when occasion cads for it. • It must be seen  
that it will be impossible for ilie Congress  
to prohibit an intercourse between the Uni­  
ted States and the West Indies, in British  
vessels, without producing a very serious ef­  
fect on their wh&lt;*.le navigation and commer­  
cial interests. We fl.n ter ourselves, there­  
fore, that it mav he found practicable, and  
perhaps not diffc-U, to -i^r-Xi.-jr? this  
heveanct&#x27;i to the satisfaction&#x27; of boil! cyuii­  
tries.  
The seventh article relates to the appoint­  
ment of colon’s by each party in the territo­  
ries and ports of the other. It was taken  
from the treaty of 1 “94.  
The eighth article, which Specifies the cau­  
ses for which vessels may be captured or de­  
tained, including among them,* the circum­  
stance of their h iving enemies property on  
board, is (except the last cluuse) a trans­  
cript of the 17th article of the treaty of  
1/91. The stipulation contained in that  
c mitt, that the parties shall be a Honed a­  
dequatc damages and charges of the trial in.  
all cases of unfounded detention or other con­  
travention of tiie regulation of the present  
treaty, will-, we presume, produce the salu­  
tary effect contemplated by it. There is  
perhaps, no principle in the maritime precenl  
sums of this country, which has been more  
abused in pr -ctice, than that whifeli this pie­  
i  
  
‘ is to remeciv.  
-. . . u a;iniu«ce»  
should be showed m all such cases U, it  
true, a doctrine recognized bv the court of  
admiralty. It cannot, however,be doubted  
that l*_v providing lor them in the treaty the  
obligation to all &gt;w them, will acquire great­  
ct t&gt;t cc inc coin t, aiid even iJic &lt;rovtrn«  
ment itself, while it cannot fail to give an  
u-ct ii admonition to the erwizers.  
The nin It article regulates what shall be  
deemed contraband of war You will ob* erve  
th at tar and turpentine, except when destin­  
ed to a place ol naval equipment are not  
comprised in it, ami that provisions are a to­  
gether omitted. We endeavored to exch-!&lt;•  
from it naval Stores, but without edect We  
succeeded, ho we ter, in exempd y tlie v.-s­  
sel on the return voyage, after depositing hV-r  
cargo at the port of her destination fiv u ba­  
mg detained on the pretence that it conned  
ot contraband articles.  
The provision in the tenth article, relative  
to vessels sailing without knowledge ot *  
blockade, is somewhat altered from the trea­  
ty of 1794. The precise effect of the clmm e  
cannot perhaps lie pronounced with ccrtum­  
ty ; but it seems to bec.eartiuit it cannot *&#x27; «  
otherwise than advantageous. The alter iti­  
ons consist in the introduction imo ri,e ,m.  
amide ot “the distance and other circ in­  
stances incident to the situation &lt;&gt;. the con­  
tracting parties,&quot; and of the word • such&quot;  
into the provision which follows. The hrsc  
amendment appears to justify an inference  
that, on account of the peculiar circmns’un­  
ces local and relative, thus recited as ’the  
reasons, why, in the opinion of the contac­  
ting parties, “ it may lrequentlv hannei,  
that vessels may sail fora port or id «Ji,h*  
  
out Knowing it is besieged, b  
vested,” our vessels oujrht not  
oci&#x27;; ided or in­  
, . _0... not io be liable to  
be judicially affected witli knowledge of *  
blockade, so as to subject them to pennlt’  
bv tlie evidence usually held u, be sufficient  
for that purpose, Sir VV. Scott decided^*  
1799, that, in consequence of the distnne- *1  
the UnitedStatesfro.n Europe, we v.-re en­  
titled to a more favorable rule in that res­  
pect tlim other countries, and our articl*  
uiavbe fairly considered as adoptin&#x27;* that 1­  
dca and acting upon it. On the foundation of  
the single fact of distance, Sir \V. Scott justi­  
hed a conjectural destination from Am,  
  
[O Amsterdam, although the blockade of that  
port had been hotificd ; smd the parries c-u­  
cevned were proved to have known of ih*  
commencement oi’it. The article as it amir  
stands, seems necessarily to imply, a* 1eat  
the same indulgence} arid, if it dies &#x27;it cer­  
tainly goes farther than bit- VV. Scott’s opi­  
nion, which dors not admit that an enq liry  
can be made of the blockading force, as out  
article unquestionably does, in th» s to  
which it applies. It*does not appear to do  
unreasonable to hold, that, a peculiar mot ■ «  
being now assigned in the preamble lor dm  
provision which it introduces, a correspon­  
dent peculiar effect is contemplated by tint  
provision ; and no such effect can folio* from  
it, if it be not, that [as oifr distance makes  
it impossible “ that we should have constant  
information of the state of the blockade  
whether it continues, or is relaxed”] the  
mere notification of the blockade or e.en the  
knowledge that the blockade has been com­  
menced dc facto, shall not br sufSci-nt &#x27;j  
make the destination illegal, but tlmt^noi­  
withstanding such not ideation or knowledge  
we shall receive warning at the port or place  
blockaded. I he word.-. “ without kno.vin­  
that the same is either besieged, blockaded  
or invested” will admit of this infc» pret uti­

Tat the clause in its present form would do  
much towards the »«compli*Uineut of our oli­  
ject ; and that What remained it wonhl be  
in their power, as it ‘certainly War In their  
inclination, to supply, as effectually as in the  
treaty itself, by taking occasion to state, in  
a letter which it was intended should be de­  
livered to us on their part at the time of the  
signature of the treaty, which * u will here­  
after find explained, the theory and prac-,  
tice ®f the (hitish government on tins sub­  
^cr- .  
This reasoning was in no degree satisfac­  
tory, and it was resisted accordingly, but  
without eirect. Tli^y oposcd aibstittitc tor  
a definition by treaty might be of some value,  
and was not therefore opposed; but it wa&gt;  
&#x27;obvious that it would bi great lv impaired,  
if not wholly destroyed, by the nature of tlie*  
letter, of which we had received a full ex­  
planation. and in whichthesuggested state­  
ment was to lie inserted.  
Tht eleventh article regulates the great&#x27;  
question of our comnic&#x27; ce with enemies co­  
lonies, the interruption of which was one of  
the principal-causes of the late disagreement  
between the two countries. \Yc trust that  
the coin] roittisc which has been made on this  
point, will he advantageous to our commer­  
cial interest, and satisfactory to our gnverti­  
nu-nt. The British commissioners were ve­  
ry desirous of burthening this intercourse  
with several severe restrictions, to place,  
as they did not hesitate to state, their own  
merchants on an equal footing, in the great  
markets of the continent, with those of the  
I1J. States. With that view and to settle all  
questions concerning the continuity of the  
|oyage, they proposed that nil articles of  
|Vost-Ind:a produce should be stored in the  
  
ffj. states irr a term ot one month, he trans­  
ported thence u&gt;. Europe in another ship from  
that in which they were brought, and he  
likewise subjected to a duty of at least four  
per ce t. -n re-exportation. They finally a­  
grted however to relinquish, all these nrefen­  
sions, except the landing of the goods in the  
U. States, and the payment (hr which is un­  
der-.itvxl the sec-1ring of the payment in the  
nine. ■ pir-scrib- • by our law.) of due per cent.,  
on such Tiurupean articles as may he carried  
thence-to t&gt; j colonies, and of two per cent,  
on *uch West Indi-i productions as may  
be carried to Europe, including the parent  
and-every &gt;r&#x27;-jr country. Wc are pnrsuadc &lt;11  
that this : rangemeiit will be attended with  
le«s ii:C nvenienceto the parties than the o­  
ther restrictions uhove mentioned, or either  
ot t* jr.tr The storing of-the goods especial­  
ly cr a month seemed to’be peculiarly objec­  
^tienable, as it would have subjected* us to a  
PJeiious injury without being attended with  
any-circumstance to alleviate the regret in­  
separable from it. We flat :.er ourselves that  
the sum agreed to be paid will not be fc&#x27;t as  
a heavy one on our merchants, w hose patri­  
otism will be gratified by thr recollection that  
the duty whit h they pay will re found tt the  
advantage oftlieir ccuntrv By the compro­  
mise ^vh^ch is insde, the practical enjoyment  
of the rights of each party is forborne, in the  
manner stated and for the term specified,  
■while the rights themselves air reserved_  
Tiie stipulation being in the form of a con­  
cession on the part of Greut-hritain, is in­  
tended to mitigate her principle where it ap­  
] lies, but in no respect to enlarge the sphere  
of its operation, No judicial decisn :: oi the  
•court of Admiralty ;n this country h s hither­  
to extended the British principle to enemies  
■polrnies in the lvisl Indies, and it is unders­  
rt&gt; o.l th l it duoxiict apply to the greater part  
if 10 any of them. Some cases are depending  
before it. from tlic vice admiralty courts of  
Halifax and Colombo, which will bring the  
point into question. Should the opinion of  
the court he that the principle is applicable  
to the colony to which the cause relates,  
then the party will have the advantage of  
  
the provision contained in this article ; should  
it on the contrary decide that it does not ap­  
• plv to such coiony, then the trade between it  
and the parent country will be free. Tnis  
view of the subject was entertained equally  
bv tbe Brit;sh commissioners and ourselves,  
and is tliat, as they assure us, which the court  
of admiralty will adopt in its decision&#x27;s. YYfc  
endeavored to exempt this branch of the  
trade with enemies colonies from thcopera­  
tion &lt; the British principle ; but that was  
X&#x27; ml in •practicable. We flatter ourselves  
that tiie arrangement made respecting it will  
I be deemed tbe next most eligible one that  
Icould have been adopted, and that it will  
* produce in practice, in a e-cat measure, if  
not altogether, the same effect.  
The twelfth article establishes the mari­  
time jurisdiction of the U. States to the dis­  
tance o: five marine miles from tlieir coast,  
in favor of their &gt;wn vessels and unarmed  
vessels of all other pow rs who may acknow­

it the present tin.e, might be denned an act

c g‘. *cn by the  
  
greater amount than was  
rw[iiired l»v the i9th article of the treaty of  
17ft*1. It is also enjoined in stronger  
and more definite terms on the beU.gerent,  
in this than the former article, to *»e that its  
ships of w ar and privateers shall observe, in  
a manner the most favorable to neutrals, *he  
acknowledged principles and rules of the law  
of nations, in tire search of merchant vessels.  
We endeavored to obtain an arrangement  
more adequate tothcobjdet, and relinquish­  
ed the pursuit of it with regret. While the  
subject of visitation and search was under  
Consideration, the British commissioners as­  
sured us that ‘heir government would ’ emu­  
late it in a satisfactory manner to the Uni*,  
ed States by act of parliament, especially in  
v«#pect to privateers, which assurance was  
repealed when the treaty was&#x27;signed.  
Tite following articles, to the 21st illu­  
sive, are taken from the tre.itv of 1/9*1 —  
&#x27;I he British&#x27;commissioners she. cd a de ire  
to ret till them, and as it appeared that they  
had in suhstatibe l»cen int&gt; oduoed into flic  
treaty with France, of 1S01, and that an at­  
tempt on our part to omit them would be  
thought unaccommodating uml-captious, w&#x27;c  
agreed to them.  
The twenty-second article contains a new  
and useful provision in favor of the unfortu­  
nate in the case of shipwreck.  
The twcntV&#x27;-third article, after declaring  
that it is the intention of the high contract­  
ing parties that the jteople of their respec-&quot;1  
tive dominions shall be on tlte&#x27;footinrg of the  
most favored nations, stipulates that in case  
either of the parties shall hereaft r grant  
ny additional advantages in navigation or  
commerce to any other nation, the citizens  
or subjects of the other party shall fully par­  
ticipate in them. This article is deemed  
peculiarly important in many views, but  
more especially in its application to the Bri­  
tish possessions in the East-Indies. If it  
can be shewn that any peculiar accommoda­  
tion is or shall be hereafter granted to an’  
other powers, we become entitled to it of  
course.  
  
The twenty-fourth article engage* that  
the parties shall communicate to each other  
tlie laws which their respective lcgislatuies  
n.ay enact lor the abolition or limitation of  
the African slave trade, and that they &quot;&#x27;ill  
also use their &quot;best endeavors to procure the  
co-operation of other powers for the com­  
plete abolition of that trade. As this en­  
gagement reposes on our laws, it follows  
that it does not enjoin anv obligation  
unknown to them. If it shmild be act­  
ed on at all by our government, farther­  
than by communicating to this the laws of  
congress, as is proposed in the first part of  
the article, the sphere of its&#x27;operation would  
be a very contracted one, till the ycar&#x27;1808.  
After that period such a co-operation on a  
more enlarged scale would become a consti­  
tutional mfcasure of the government, and, as  
we think, a suitable one. Mr. Fox had ta- &gt;  
ken great interest in th;s question, audit is  
understood that in suggesting the idea, in  
the address of the House of commons to the  
king, ol obtaining the co-operation of other  
powers, the United States were held parti­  
cularly in view. The British commission­  
ers proposed the article, and shewed great  
desire that we should agree to it. As this  
stipulation was not comprised within the  
scope of our instructions, we have thought it  
our duty to explain to vou the cause to  
which its admission into the treaty is to be  
attributed.  
The twenty-fifth article &#x27;Was introduced  
for the purpede of T”otecting other powers  
haying treaties with either party, in the en­  
joyment of the rights secured by them.—  
I he stipulation contained in our treaty with  
France, in 180$, of certain commercial pri­  
vileges in favor of French and Spanish sub­  
jects for a defined term in Louisiana, made  
such a provision particularly necessary.  
The twenty-sixth article fixes the term of  
the treaty at ten years from the date of the  
exchange of the ratifications.  
  
YVe are sorry ‘to add that this treaty &#x27;con­  
tains noprovision against the impressment of  
r»nr seamen. Our dispatch of the 1 It,: of  
November, communicated to you the result  
of our labors on. that subject, and our opini on  
“hat. although this government did not feel  
it clt at liberty to relinquish, &#x27;formally by  
treaty, its claim to search our merchant ves­  
sels fur British seamen, its practice would  
nevertheless, be essentially if not complete­  
ly abandoned. That opinion lias been since  
confirmed bv frefjucnt conferences on the sub­  
ject with the British commissioners, who  
have repeatedly assured us that in their  
judgment, we were made as secure against  
the exercise of their pretension by the policy  
which their government had adopted, in re­  
gard to that very delicate and important  
question, as we could have been made by  
treaty. It is proper to observe, however, that  
the good effect of this disposition and its con­  
tinuance may depend in a great measure on  
the means which may be taken by the con­  
gress hereafter to check desertions from the  
British service. If the treaty is ratified, Sc  
a perfect good understanding produced by it  
between the two count res, it will be easy for  
their governments, by friendly commhnica­  
ions, to st itc to e ich other what thev re­  
spectively desire, and in that mode toarrange  
the business as satisfactorily as it could be  
done by treaty.  
We regret also to be under the necessity  
ot stating, that no provision has been made  
by the treaty to indemnify our citizens for  
their losses by the late seizures, and other  
violations of the law of nations. This object  
engaged our attention in every stage of the  
ncgorialion, and was not abandoned by the  
signature of the treaty. On the day it was  
signed, we stated in explicit terms to the  
British commissioners, that we could not  
conclude, without having a satisfactory a *  
suranre, by them, of *he part their go­  
vernment intended to take, equAlly in regard  
to the vessels and cargoes which had been  
condemned, and the suits that were depend­  
ing. The principle established in the cor­  
respondence between Mr. King and lord  
H iwkesbury, we admitted should form the  
boundary of our claim, in respect to the sei­  
zures for an imputed illegal trade ; for e­  
verv violation of which, in cases of condem­  
nation, we expected a full indemnity, and a  
dismission of ail the Causes still depending,  
that were protected by it. The British  
commissioners observed, that it was neither  
their wish nor expectation, that we should  
••eliiiquish our claim ; on the contrary, thev  
were willing we should preserve it, with  
hich view they proposed thatwe should pre­  
si nt them a paper, bearing date prior to the  
signature, which should make the rt nervati­  
on in such form as we thought best suited to  
the object They intimated that in bases of

that-expectation; oil the contrary, they en­  
couraged it. and we&#x27;re still more explicit in  
suggesting-that the depending cases would  
not lie unfavorably adjudged. They seetped  
desirous that, while we should reserve our  
claim, their government shoifid retain a right  
to pursue such a -course of conduct in re­  
gard to it as might be dictated hereafter by  
circumstances. To enter intoan engagement  
in favor of our claim in the present state of  
ihings, appeared to them as being likely to  
expose tlirir government to the imputation  
&quot;f having done it by coercion, and to deprive  
•t of h claim to any merit for snehan accom­  
modation as k might under other circum­  
stances be disposed to yield. Should the  
circumstances of collision which had taken  
place between the two countries be done a­  
wUy, and llieiY commerce and friendly rela  
hit mns be re-established, as they hoped was  
already in a&#x27;great measure done, and would  
be so completely by this treaty, their go­  
vernment. they thought, would feel itself  
more at liberty to vic&#x27;d accommodations on  
this topic than in the actual state. This  
was the substance of the communication  
made us bh the subject bv thi British com­  
missioners before the signature of the trea­  
ty, on which, and our declaring explicitly  
that we would it serve theright in the man­  
ner they ii d proposed, in full confidence  
that their govcrtipiciu world respect it, we  
proceeded to sign the treaty. We have had  
an interview with the British commission­  
ers&#x27;since the signature, md were happy to  
find that they had not forgotten what had  
passed bet een us on that occasion. We  
had asked the interview, as we informed  
them, for the purpose of. conferring on&#x27;this  
subject, and cf obtaining th*»i«* »ntimenn in  
so ck tinct a form ns to leave! us under no  
embarrassment ir the communication it was  
  
« uuiv in w you on n. iro ning  
passed in this interview on their part to  
change the g-omul on -which the business  
had been pijccd in the former one. They  
intimated, however, that it might he advan­  
tageous, ard would certainly be proper for  
us, in the iresent stage, to confer with lord  
Iiowick or this subject,’since any declarati­  
on from Vim con hi n &gt;t fail, according to its  
import, t&gt; merit the peculiar attentj m ot  
our government. \Vc have accordingly  
seen anc conferred with lord Hawick upon  
this tone, whose sentiments appeared to  
correspond strictly with those which had  
been delivered to us by the British commis­  
sioners. He intimated, however, that it  
wouli bt better fur ns to address the note  
which should contain a reservation of our  
rights to indemnity, to him than to the com­  
missioners, to which we assented, as we  
cruld not perceive, that that circumstance  
voukl make any difference in the case. We  
ire engaged in preparing this paper, which  
we expect to present to his lordship in a  
frw days, though we fear it will not be rea­  
dy in tune to enable ns toobtain his answer  
to it to be forwarded to you with this dis­  
patch- We shall not fail to communicate  
to yoU, without delay, whatever may occur  
on this subject. We think it our duty, how­  
ever, to add that we do hot wish our govern­  
ment to he too sanguine in tke expectation  
of a satisfactory result. In the deliberations  
on this subject it may. perhaps, he better to  
presume that such a one may not be obtain­  
ed, as it is not provided for in the treaty —  
The above Statement is nevertheless perfect­  
ly cor; ect, hnd we beg you to be assured  
that wc shall continue to exert our best en­  
deavours to secure an object which we con­  
sider of So dutch importance. We shall send  
you a statement of the cases of condemnati­  
on,. and of the causes still depending, which  
is less extensive in both views than may  
have been supposed.  
  
it nappeneu, wnen tnc negotiation hncl  
reached a very Advanced stage, that an ac­  
count was received here of the decree of  
the emperor of the French at Berlin, of No­  
vember 21, which declared Great-Britaih &amp;  
Ireland in a state of blockade, and all British  
manufactures and the produce of British cof­  
lonie&#x27;s lawful pri.ee. &#x27;I his circumstance pro­  
duced a-strong impression on this govern­  
ment, which was very seriously felt in our  
Concerns, k seemed probaole for some days  
that it would subject the negotiation to a  
long suspension, if it did not entirely defeat  
its object. The British commissioners in­  
formed us, that the decree of the govern­  
ment of France, had opposed a power­  
ful obstacle to the conclusion of afiy treaty  
with us, before our government should  
be consulted on the subject, and its an­  
swer obtained as to the part it might  
take in regard to it : that in case the  
United States submitted to a violation of  
their neutral rights by France in the man­  
ner contemplated by that decree, it would  
be impossible for Great-Britajn to respedt  
them ; thatjiy concluding a treaty with the  
United States, by which they should not only  
bind themselves, to the observance of such  
rights, but agree to concessions or relaxati­  
ons of what they conceived to be their un­  
questionable rights of war, after knowing  
the contents of that decree, they might be  
understood to restrain themselves from  
counteracting the policy of France, which it  
would be improper to do, unless our govern­  
ment should engage to support its rights a  
gainst the measures .of&#x27; Frahce. In consi­  
deration of these circumstance?;,, they propo­  
sed that we should proceed in the business  
so far as to agree on all the articles of the  
treaty, to reduce them to form, and then  
transmit the instrument to the United States.  
  
to become obligatory in case our government  
should enter into a satisfactory engagement  
of the kind proposed. We replied in vc.y  
explicit terms to the British commissioners  
that we considered their proposition altoge­  
ther inadmissible on our part, and not likely  
to ccnmplinh, if we could agree to if, the  
object which they contemplated by it:, that  
such a proposition to our government, under  
the circumstances attending it, would a­  
mount, in substance, to an offer to it of the  
Rite, native between the treaty, and a war  
with France, since if our government&#x27;refused  
to give the satisfaction which they desired,  
the treaty would be lost: and if such satis­  
faction was given and the treaty concluded,  
and France should persist tn execute her  
decree, according to the construction given of  
it here, war seemed to he inevitable: that  
it it should happen that our g vernment  
should approve the treaty, it was not to be  
presumed that it would make anv sacrifice,  
or stipulate any thing not contained in the  
instrument, especially so ve**y important an  
act as that alluded to, as the condition on  
which it was to he obtained ; that the ar­  
rangement of our differences and other con­  
cerns with (»rcat-Britain, was an affair  
which rested on its own ground, and had no  
connection with our relations with France;  
that his majesty’s government ought to sup­  
pose that the United States would not fail  
  
mast ue ifcJRJble that It would be more at  
liberty to enter into suitable friendly ex­  
planations with the government of France,  
on the subject of the decree in question, af­  
ter the adjustment of their differences with  
Great-Rritain, than while they existed, as  
it likewise nufet be, that the prospect of I  
obtaining satisfactory explanations on that j  
point, ofFrartce, would be better while they  
acted under their own impulse as an inde­  
pendent and friendly power, titan it would be  
in case they entered int &gt; an engagement of  
the kind proposed with her adversary.—  
The British commissioners admitted that  
these considerations were entitled to much  
attention: at length, however, after the sub­  
ject had been, as we had reason to believe,  
maturely weighed in the cabinet, they in­  
formed ns that their government still iho’t  
it incumbent on it to make a reservation of  
their i ight to counteract the pol.cv of France,  
in case our government did not give them  
the satisfaction they desired, either by suit­  
able assurances before the ratification of the  
treaty, or by its conduct afterwards. With  
this view they presented us a paper which  
we have the honor to transmit with this dis­  
patch. In transmitting to you this paper,  
it is our duty to observe that we do not con­  
sider ourselves a party to it* or as having  
given&#x27;u in any the slightest degree our sanc­  
tion. The incident which produced the pa­  
per wits unexpected on our pavt, and without  
entering into its merits, we used our best  
exertions to diminish its effect in relation to  
the objects of our negotiation. The British  
commissioners brought the incident into view,  
and made it the subject of discussion in the  
manner above stated, as they did the purt  
which it became their government to take  
in the depending negotiation in consequence  
of it. We therefore thought, not only that  
  
we were at liberty, but that it was impe­  
riously our duty to use our best exertions to  
make the paper w hich they proposed to pre­  
sent to us, in reference to the decree of  
France, as little injurious as possible, nnde­  
ven to urge that decree as a strong reason  
why Great-Britain sir uld be more explicit  
and satisfactory in her definition of neutral  
rights, as wc’l for the purpose of vindicating  
hi rself against the strong denunciation it  
contained, as to enable our &#x27;government to  
urge with more fo.ee with the government­  
ofFrahce Its o.jections to the decree. We  
were glad to find that these remarks were  
not altogether without effect, as will appear  
by the paper referred to, especially the de­  
finition it gives of a blockade, which is to­  
lerably correct.  
Yon will observe, that the comtnerce be­  
tween the United States and the British co­  
lonies which bound them to the east &amp; north  
has not been regulated by this treaty. The  
British commisaionors refused to agree to a­  
ny arrangement of it in consequence of our  
declining to admit their Canada and Hudson­  
Bay traders intoTouisi i.ia. It has occurred  
to 11s, that it might be advantageous to the U­  
nited States, arid consistent with the views  
of our &#x27;government to comprise botri these  
objects, under suitable regulations, in a  
parate convention, especially if they car. be  
made, instrumental to a satisfactory estab­  
lishment nf our boundaries. We have rea-:  
son to think, that in the form of a new act,  
in connection with these oilier objects, it  
wouul be more agTdeable to this gn\ eminent  
&gt;o settle the question of boundary, according  
to the views of the preside in and senate,  
than by ratifying the convention already en­  
tered iftto, with the exception of the 5th ar­  
ticle. The British cornmis .loners-h ive ex­  
pressed their willingness to proceed in the  
business, for the purpose of arranging all  
these topics in a satisfactory manner, as lord  
Hawick has likewise done ; and it seems  
highly important to take advantage of this  
  
disposition, to settle amicably with tins go­  
vernment, at the present time, o&#x27;ery re­  
maining cause of strife, so far as it may he  
practicable. Should we undertake to form  
such a convention, the commercial part of it  
will of course be limited to the same term,  
not to exceed that of the treaty. \\re shall  
also be attentive to the cbnditions on which  
the traders with the Indian tribes are to be  
admitted into Louisiana ; by being particu­  
larly careful that it be done on such conditi­  
ons as to render it impossible for them to do  
any injury. We are persuaded that such re­  
gulations might be adopted, as would, even  
at this time, have that effect. We arc con­  
fident that our population will have so far  
spread over the whole surface of that coun­  
try, bv the time the treaty would expire, as  
to supercede the necessity of renewing it.  
We have the honor to be,  
With great consideration 8c estecirt.  
Sir,  
\ our must obedient servant

jwe were entitled to a more favorable  
1 rule in that respect than other coun­  
- and our article may be fairly  
; considered as adopting that idea and

tion from America. ni, al- .  
I though ihe blockade of that port had .

of the commencement of it. The ar­

rily to imply at least the s.mio indul­  
gence, an j, if it does, it certainly  
goes farther than sir W. Scott&#x27;s opi­  
nion, which does not admit that an  
enquiry can be made of the blockad­  
ing force, as our article unquestion­  
ably does, in the cases to which it  
applies. It does not appear to be un­  
reasonable to hold that, a peculiar  
motive being now assigned it) the pre­  
amble for the provision which it in­  
troduces, a correspondent peculiar  
effect is contemplated by that provi­  
sion ; and no such effect can follow  
from it, if it be not that (as our dis­  
tance makes it impossible &quot; that we  
should have constant information of  
the state of the blockade, whether ii  
continues, or is relaxed) the mere  
notification of the blockade, or even  
the knowledge that the blockade has  
been commenced de facto, shall not  
be sufficient to make the destination  
illegal, but that, notwithstanding such  
notification or knowledge, we shall  
receive warning at the port cr place  
blockaded. The words &quot; without  
knowing thai the same is either be­  
sieged, blockaded, or invested,*&#x27; will  
admit of this interpretation, since by  
reason of our distance, it may in our  
case be truly said (and has in sub­

iment, towards the government  
and people of the ET. S. The limit  
dished was net so extensive as  
which we had contended for, and  
expected to have obtained. We per- |  
Stiade ourselves, however, that the !  
object which was contemplated  
by any arrangement of the subject,  
will result from that which has been,&#x27;  
made. The article in the treaty, in I  
exion With the causes which pro- J  
duced it, forms an interesting occur-f  
vence in the history of our country, j  
i cannot fail to produce the most  
ary consequences, It is fair to  
presume that the sentiment of respect  
b G. Britain  
meanurc for the U.S. will be felt and j  
observed in future by ] irons!  
tn thcif conduct on our coasts, and in  
our bays and harbors. It is equally  
fait- to presume that, the example of  
ion which it affords in their  
favor, by a nation :*o vastly prepon­  
derant at sea, will be followed by q­  
ther &gt;.)■&#x27;.* ■  
By &#x27; ccnth article, it is a­  
. the sum for whi&lt; h bonds  
shall be given by the commanders of  
privateers before they receive their  
commissions, to indemnify those who  
shall be injured by their misconduct, |  
shall be increased to z greater amount &#x27;  
than was required by the i&#x27;-Hh article  
of the treaty of 1794. It is also en­  
joined, in stronger and more definite  
terms on the belligerent in this than  
in the former article, to see that its ,  
ships of war and privateers Shall oh- j  
serve in a manuer the most favorable

in tlu- search of merchant vessels.  
dvored to obtain an aft  
ment more adequate to the 6b  
and relinquished the pursuit of it with  
regret. While the subject of visita­  
tion and search was under considera­  
tion, the British commis doners assu­  
red us that their government would  
regulate it in a satisfactory manner to ,  
the ET. S. by act of Parliament, i

sphere of its operation would be a  
very contn c, till the year I  
After that period such a co-operation  
on a more en. lie, would be­  
come a constitutional measure of the  
government, and as we think, a lultft­  
nc. Mr. Pox had taken great mi­  
i in ibis question, and ir is ttn«  
tood, that in suggesting the idea,  
in the address of the House of Com­  
mons to the ICing, of obtaining the  
co-operation of other powers, the  
United States were held particularly  
in view. The British commissioners  
proposed the article, and shewed  
great desire that we should accede to  
it. As this stipulation was not comp­  
rised within tii&quot; .cope of our inst rue­  
wc have thought it our duty to  
explain to you, .he cause to which its  
admission into the treaty is to be attil­  
buted.  
The twenty-fifth article was intro­  
duced for the purpose df protecting  
other powers, having treaties with ei­  
ther party, in the enjoyment of the  
j rights secure J by them. The sttpu­  
! I alio n contained in our treaty with  
! Prance, in 1803, of certain commer­  
cial privileges in favor of Frexw h and I  
; Spanish subjects, for a defined term  
&#x27;in Louisiana, made such a proi  
particularly necessary.  
The twenty-sixth article fixes the  
ftcrm of the treaty to ten years, from  
i the date of ihe exchange of the rati­  
ons.  
We are sorry to add, that this tr&lt;  
contain, no provision against the Im­  
, pressment of our seamen. On  
■ of the 11th of November, com*  
! municated to you the result of our  
labors on that subject, and our opinion  
that although this government did  
not feel itself at liberty to relinquish,  
formally, by (re cli im, to  
search our mCrcht Is for Bri­  
tish seamen, its practice would never­  
theless i. iaHy, il not I  
pleteiy abandoned, &#x27;&#x27;&quot;hat opinion has  
. since confirmed by frequent  
I conferences on &#x27;he subject with the  
j British commissioners, who have re­  
peatedly assured us, that in their  
judgment, we were made as secure  
! against the exercise of their preten­  
&#x27; sicn by the policy which their govern- j  
ment had adopted, in regard to that  
very delicate ai.d important question  
as could have been made by treaty.  
It is proper to observe, however, mat  
the good effect of this disposition,  
! and of its continuance, may depend j  
jin a great measure on the means j  
I which may be taken by the C&#x27;-tigress,  
hereafter to check desertions from the  
British service. If the treaty is ra­  
tified and a perfect good Understand­  
ing produced by it between Ih  
countries, it will be easy for their go­  
vernments, by friendly communica­  
tion-;, to- ich other what they  
respectively desire, and in that mode  
to arrange the business as suisfacfo­  
&#x27; rily as it couid be done by treaty.  
We regret also to be under the ne­  
cessity of staling, that r*o provision  
J has been made by the treaty, to in­  
demnify our citizens for their It.  
Iby the late seizures, and other viola­  
tions of the law of nations. This ob­  
ject engaged our attention in every  
[Stage ...--gociation, and was not  
| abandoned by ihe signature of the  
deaty. On the day it was signed, we  
| stated in explicit terms to the* British  
j commissi, tat we could not con-  
I elude without having a satisfactory as­  
surance by them, of tne part their  
i government intended to take, equally,  
lin regard to the vessels and cargoes  
j which had hi d, and to  
the suits &#x27;catfkuieiinr.;. The  
| principle csta! Spoil­  
: dence between Air. King and Lord  
Ilawkesbury, we admitted, should  
form the bottnd of our claim in re­  
i tothesei  
gal trade ; for m cry violation of which,  
in cases of condemnation, we expect­  
full indemnity, and a dismission  
!of ail the causes still depending that  
1 were protected by it. The British  
j commissioners observed, that it was  
i neither their wish or expectation, that  
;we should relinquish our claim ; on  
j the contrary, they were willing we  
ye it; with which view  
the/ proposed thai ltd present  
them a paper, be c prior to  
the signature, Which should make the  
i reservation in i as we th&lt;  
i best suited to the object. They inti­  
■ mated th; ol vested right, it  
j was not in the power of their govern­  
j ment to interfere to the prejudice of  
j the parlies, and that it would be hard  
on tin; government, and unpopular in  
the ministry, to apply the public mo­  
ney io such a purpose ; still Liny said  
nothing to preclude that exp  
:on the contrary, |  
|and we • still mote explicit in  
■  
! would ie  
] They seen rl  
1 shotlid reserve out  
government should retain a right to  
pursue such a&lt; : &lt;s« of conduct in  
regard to it, as mi ;ht. be di­  
hereafter by circumstances. To i  
into an engagement in favor of our  
  
clatm, in the present state of things, ! t  
appeared to them, as being likely to .1  
,c their government to the impu- i  
tation of having done it by coercion, \
and to deprive it of a claim to any me- t  
rit for such accommodation, as it t  
might under other circumstances be t  
disposed to yield. Should the circum- i  
stances of collision, which had taken i  
place between the two countries, he t  
done away, and their commerce and I  
friendly relations be re-established, as &lt;  
they hoped was already in a great  
measure done, and would be so com- ]  
pletely by ibis treaty, their govern- &lt;  
ment the) thought would feel itself ]  
more at liberty to yield accommoda- j  
tions on this topic, than in tlie actual t  
state. This was Hie substance of the 1  
communication made us on this sub- i  
ject by the Btitish commissioners, be- i  
fore the signature of the treaty, on I  
which, and our declaring explicitly,  
that we would reserve the right in the I I  
manner they had proposed, in foil i  
confidence that their government t  
would respect it, we proceeded to 1  
sign the treaty. We have had an i  
interview with the British comniE- , ;  
sion ers since the signature, and j  
were happy to find that they had not t  
forgotten what had passed between us j ■  
on that occasion. We had asked the .; i  
interview, as we informed them, fori  
j the purpose of conferring on this i  
subject, aifferipbtaining their scnti- i  
! ments in s I a form, as to leave i  
us under no embarrassment in the  
communication it was out* duty to i  
make to you on it. Nothing passed ; i  
in this interview on their part, to ! i  
change the ground on which the bu- ;  
siness had been placed in the former i  
e&gt;ne. They intimated however, that  
ii might be advantageous, and would j  
certainly be proper for us in the pre- j•,  
sent stage, to confer with lord How- j i  
ick on this subject, since any declare- j i  
tion from him could not fail, accord- |  
| ngto its import, to merit the pecu- i  
| liar attention of our government. —  
jWe have accordingly seen and - on- .  
I ferred with lord Howick upon this to­  
j pic, whose sentiments appeared to  
{ correspond strictly with those which  
I had been delivered to us by the Bri- i  
[ tish commissioners. He intimated,  
however, th tit would be better for  
lus to address the note which should  
I contain a reservation of our rights to j  
| indemnity to him than to the commis-  
I sioneri ; to which we assented, as we  
; could not perceive that that circum­  
j stance would make any difference in  
&#x27; the case. We are engaged in prepar­  
ing- ,his paper, which we expect to  
present to his lordship m a few days,  
though we fear it will not be ready in  
time to enable us to obtain his answer  
.I to it, to be forwarded to you with  
. this dispatch. We shall not fail to  
; communicate to you, without delay,  
I whatever may occur on this subject, i  
.i We think it our duty, however, to  
that we do not wish our govern­  
. j ment lobe too sanguine in the expec­  
tation of a satisfactory result. In tne  
, deliberation on this subject it may |  
perhaps be better to presume  
that such a one may not be ■  
obtained, as it is not provided for  
in the treau*. The above State-  
I ment is nevertheless perfectly cor­  
; | rect, and we beg you to be assured  
: i that we shall continue to exert our  
i j best endeavors to scouie an object  
. which we consider of so much im­  
. portancc. Wre shall send you a state- j  
• ment of the cases of condemnation, I  
, ; and of the causes s.&#x27;ill depending,  
I I which is less extensive in both views  
i than may have been supposed.  
; j It happened when the negotiation j  
. ! had reach y advanced stage, j  
I that an accoun*. was received here of (  
| I the decree of the emperor of Prance, |  
Berlin, of November 31, which,  
.ritaiii and Ireland in a  
of blockade, and all British  
■ lures and the produce of British  
i , colonies lawful prize. This circtim­  
• oduced a strong impression  
i&#x27; on this government, which was very  
j { seriously felt in our conc.-ioa. It  
.led probable iur some days that  
i, il would subject tie negooiation to a  
; long suspension, ii it did noi entirely  
r defeat its object. The British com­  
t missioners informed uslh.it that de­  
&gt; cree of the government ol Erance had  
■ opposed a powerful obstacle to the j  
:. conclusion of any treaty with us, by- I  
. fore out* government snouid be con­  
t suited on the subject, and its answer  
. obtained as to the part it might lake  
f in regard to it : I hat in case the U. S.  
I submitted to a violation of their neu­  
i tral rights by Erance in the manner  
. contemplated by that (Perec, it would  
Ibe impossible forG. Britain to re »p&lt; ■•&lt;  
; them : th tt by concluding a treaty  
, with the U. S. I.y which tiicy should  
-! not only bind tb.emselves.to the obser­  
, vance of such rights, but agree to  
. &#x27; concessions or relaxations of what they  
: conceive to be th jstionabie  
rights of war, afier knowing the -COS­  
i tents of that decree, they might be  
understood to restrain tl  
from counteracting the policy of  
Erance, which it would be improper  
to do, unless our government should i  
  
i engage to support its rights against &lt;  
the measures of France. In conside- j t  
ration of these circumstances, they j &lt;  
proposed that we should proceed in 11  
the business so far as to agree on all j (  
the articles of a treaty, to reduce them ; 1  
to form, and then transmit the instru- ,   
ment to the U. S. to become obligato- j I  
ry in case our government should en- j *  
let* into a satisfactory engagement of ]  
the kind proposed. W&quot;e replied, in ]  
very explicit terms to the British com- &#x27;•  
missioners, that we considered their &#x27;  
proposition altogether inadmissible on 1  
our part, and not likely to accom­  
plish, if we could agree to it, the ob- [  
ject which they contemplated by it:  
that such a proposition to our govern­  
ment under the circumstances attend- &#x27;  
ing it, would amount in substance to  
an offer to it of the alternative be- [  
tween the treaty and a war with  
Prance, since, if our government re­  
! fused to give the satisfaction which  
they he treaty would be lost ; &#x27;  
and il such satisfaction was given and  
the treaty concluded, and France  
should persist to execute her decree :  
, according to the construction given of  
it here, war seemed to be inevitable ;  
that if it should happen that our go­  
vernment should approve the treaty. &#x27;  
it Was not to be presumed that it would  
make any sacrifice, or stipulate any  
i not contained in the instrument &#x27;  
especially so very important an act as  
that alluded to, as the conditio?! on  
which it was to be obtained : that the  
arrangement of our differences and !  
| other concerns with (E Britain, was  
an affair which rested on its own &#x27;  
ground, and had no connexion with &#x27;  
our relations with Erance : that his  
majesty&#x27;s government ought to Sup­  
pose that the U. S. would not 1  
; any case to support with beco  
dignity their rights with any po  
i and that it must be sensible that it ,  
&#x27; would be mote ht liberty to enter i to  
suitable friendly Explanations wit  
; government of Prance, on tl&quot;- si ject  
of the decree in question, aftei  
■ adjustment of theii differences wiin  
tin, than while they existed, a it  
likewise must be h spe&lt; iof  
ol tiniiij ■• y explanations on j  
that poinf-of Prance, would he better  
, while they acted under their own im- !  
pulse as an indepc : friendly  
. power, than it. woultl lie in case they  
* enti reel into an engifgom nt of the !  
kind proposed with her adversary. I  
Tne British commissioners admitted ]  
that these considerations were entitled  
&#x27; to much attention : at length, howe­  
-1 ver, after tho subject had been, as we  
&gt; had reason to believe, maturely  
weighed by the cabinet, tfiey inform­  
ed us that their government still  
1 thought it incumbent on it. to make  
&#x27; v reservation of their right to coun­  
» terset the policy of Erance, in case  
■ ! our govern ment did not give them the  
&#x27; satisfaction they desired, either by j  
suitable assurances before the ratifi­  
&quot; cation of the treaty, or by its conduct .  
; afterwards. WTith this view they pre- j  
&#x27; &#x27; sented us a paper which we have the  
: honor to transmit with this dispaich.  
- , In transmitting to you this paper. X is ;  
&#x27; ; our duty to observe that we do not j  
■ consider ourselves a party to it, or as  
&quot; having given it in any the slightest de- i  
* gree our sanction. &#x27;I he incident j  
:&quot; which produced the paper was unex- j  
: peeled on our part, and without en-.  
&quot; t tering into its merits we used om  
&quot; j exertions to diminish its effect in re- |  
i j lation to the objects of our ncgocia- j  
&#x27; tion. The British commissioners I  
* | brought the incident info view, and  
le it the subject of dEcussion in ;  
1 j the rrrfhiner above stated, as they did !  
&gt; i the part which it became their go  
* I ment lo lake in the depending ■  
&#x27; j ciation in consequence of it. We i  
1 thcrefoie thought, not only that we |  
1 were tit liberty, but that it was impc- j  
■ r ously our duty to use our best ex- |  
ons to make the paper which they I  
&quot; proposed to present to us, in refer- i  
1 c.. eto the. decree of Prance, as little j  
&#x27; injurious as pebble, and even to urge  
decree as a strong reason why G. i  
1 Britain should be more explicit and |  
1 satisfactory in her definition of neutral I  
&#x27; rights, as weii for the purpose of vin­  
* cheating herself against the strong dc- i  
&quot; nunciation it contained, as to enable |  
* our government to urge with more  
; j force with the government of Piance,  
&quot;&#x27;] its objections to the decree. We were  
&quot; glad to (md, that these remarks were  
r not altogether without effect, as will  
•• appear by the j iper t ■ ferred to, espe­  
* cially the definition it gives of a bloc­  
* kade, which is toleraidy correct.  
p You will observe that the commerce  
&#x27; bt tween the United States and the  
1 British colonies, which bound them  
&#x27; to the cast and north, has not been rc­  
l gnlated by this treaty. The British  
* commissioners refused to agree to  
* any arrangement of it, in consequence  
&#x27; of our declining to admit their &lt;  
; daand IE1 &#x27;son-bay traders into E.E  
* siana. Il has occurred to us t  
J migE -to the United  
1 States and consistent with die views  
f oi or. government,to i i both  
c objects under suitable legula­  
-1 tions in a separate convention, cspc­  
  
cially if they can be made instrtn  
J tal to a satisfactory establishment e&gt;f  
j our boundaries. We have reason to  
, think that in the form of a new act, in  
j connexion with these other objects, it  
: would be more agreeable to this go­  
i vcrnment to settie (he question of  
I boundary, according to ihe views of  
; the President and Senate, than by ra­  
tifying the convention already entered  
into with the exception of the fifth  
article. The British commissioners  
have expressed their willingness to  
proceed in the business for the pur­  
pose of arranging all ihcse topic*; in a  
satisfactory manner, as lord Ho&quot;  
has likewise dor.c ; and it si-cms to lie  
highly important lo take advantage of  
| this disposition tosettle amicably with  
this government, at the present time,  
every remaining cause of strife so far  
as it may be practicable. Should wo  
undertake to form such a convention,  
the commercial part of it, with res­  
pect to Louisiana as well as the British  
provinces, will of course he limited to  
the same term, not to exceed that of  
: the treaty. We shall also be attentive&#x27;  
to the conditions on which the traders  
with the Indian tribes are to be adroit­  
tedintoLouisiana,by being particularly  
careful that it be done on such condi­  
tions as to rentier il impossible for  
them to do any injury. We are per­  
suaded that such regulations might bo  
adopted, as would even at this time,  
have that effect. We are confident that  
our population will have so far spread  
over the whole surface of that country,  
by the time the treaty would exp  
as to supercede the necessity ol  
newing it.  
We have the honor to be, with,  
great consideration and esteem,  
Sir, Your most obedient servants

“ It happened, when the negotiation had reached  
a very advanced stage, that account was received  
tieve ol the decree of the einperour of the French  
at Berlin, of November 21, which declared Great  
Britain and Ireland in a state of blockade, and all  
British manufactures aad the produce of British co­  
lonics lawful prize. This circumstance produced h  
strong impression on this government, which was  
very seriously felt in our concerns. It seemed pro­  
bable for sorpp days that It would subject the negoti­  
ation to a Jong suspension, if it did not entirely de­  
feat iu object. I he British commissioners inform­  
ed us, that the decree of the gaverunu nt of Fr-.nce  
hud upposed » powerful obstacle to the conclusion t f  
any treaty with us, before our government should  
he consulted on the subject, and its onswer obtained  
ns to tho part it might take in regard to it : that  
in case the tpiiled States submitted to a violation  
of their neutral lights by France in the manner  
contemplated by that declaration, it would be im&lt;  
possible for Great Britain to respect them ; that by  
concluding a treaty with the United States, by which  
they should not only bind themselves to the observ­  
ance of such rights, but agree to concessions or re­  
laxations of what they conceived to he their unques­  
tionable rights of war, after knowing the contents  
&#x27;•f that decree, they might he understood to restrain  
themselves from counteracting the policy of France,  
winch it Would be improper to do, unless our guvern­  
meut should engage to support ils rights against the  
measures ot France. In consideration of these cir  
cumstances, they proposed that we should proceed  
in the business so far as to.agree on all the articles  
of the treaty, to reduce them to form, and then  
transmit the instrument to the United States, to be,  
comejobligatory iu case our government should come  
into a satisfactory engagement of the kind proposed.
