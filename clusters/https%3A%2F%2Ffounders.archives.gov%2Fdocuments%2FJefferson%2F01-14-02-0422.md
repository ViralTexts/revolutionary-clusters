had become indolent as most of our countrymen are in matters of correspondence.  
The change in this country, since you left it, is such as you can form no idea of. The frivolities of conversation have given way entirely to politicks—men, women and children talk nothing else: and all you know talk a great deal. The press groans with daily productions, which in point of boldness make an Englishman stare, who hitherto has thought himself the boldest of men. A complete revolution in this government has, within the space of two years (for it began with the Notables of 1787) been effected merely by’ the force of public opinion, aided indeed by the want of money which the dissipations of the court had brought on. And this revolution has not cost a single life, unless we charge to it a little riot lately in Bretagne which begun about the price of bread, became afterwards political and ended in the loss of 4. or 5. lives. The assembly of the states general begins the 27th. of April. The representation of the people will be perfect. But they will be alloyed  by an equal number of nobility and clergy. The first great question they will have to decide will be Whether they shall vote by orders or persons. And I have hopes that the majority of the nobles are already disposed to join the tiers etat in deciding that the vote shall be by persons. This is the opinion à la mode at present, and mode has acted a wonderful part in the present instance. All the handsome young women, for example, are for the tiers etat, and this is an army more powerful in France than the 200,000 men of the king. Add to this that the court itself is for the tiers etat, as the only agent which can relieve their wants: not by giving money themselves (they are squeezed to the last drop) but by pressing it from the non-contributing orders. The king stands engaged to pretend no more to the power of laying, continuing or appropriating taxes, to call the States general periodically, to submit letters de cachet to legal restriction, to consent to freedom of the press, and that all this shall be fixed by a fundamental constitution which shall bind his successors. He has not offered a participation in the legislature, but it will surely be insisted on. The public mind is so ripened on all these subjects, that there seems to be now but one opinion. The clergy indeed think separately, and the old men among the Nobles. But their voice is suppressed by the general one of the nation. The writings published on this occasion are some of them very valuable: because, unfettered by the prejudices under which the English labour, they give a full scope to reason, and strike out truths as yet unperceived and unacknoleged on the other side the channel. An Englishman, dozing under a kind of half reformation, is not excited to think by such gross absurdities as stare a Frenchman in the face wherever he looks, whether it be towards the throne or the altar. In fine I beleive this nation will in the course of the present year have as full a portion of liberty dealt out to them as the nation can bear at present, considering how uninformed the mass of their people is. This circumstance will prevent their immediate establishment of the trial by jury. The palsied state of the executive in England is a fortunate circumstance for France, as it will give them time to arrange their affairs internally. The consolidation and funding their debts will give them a credit which will enable them to do what they please. For the present year the war will be confined to the two empires and Denmark against Turkey and Sweden. It is not yet evident whether Prussia will be engaged. If the disturbances of Poland break out into overt acts, it will be a power divided in itself, and so of no weight. Perhaps by the next year England and France may be ready to take  the feild. It will depend on the former principally, for the latter, tho she may be then able, must wish still a little time to see her new arrangements well under way. The English papers and English ministry say the king is well. He is better, but not well: no malady requires a longer time to ensure against it’s return, than insanity. Time alone can distinguish accidental insanity from habitual lunacy.  
The operations which have taken place in America lately, fill me with pleasure. In the first place they realize the confidence I had that whenever our affairs get obviously wrong, the good sense of the people will interpose and set them to rights. The example of changing a constitution by assembling the wise men of the state, instead of assembling armies, will be worth as much to the world as the former examples we had given them. The constitution too which was the result of our deliberations, is unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented to men, and some of the accomodations of interest which it has adopted are greatly pleasing to me who have before had occasions of seeing how difficult those interests were to accomodate. A general concurrence of opinion seems to authorize us to say it has some defects. I am one of those who think it a defect that the important rights, not placed in security by the frame of the constitution itself, were not explicitly secured by a supplementary declaration. There are rights which it is useless to surrender to the government, and which yet, governments have always been fond to invade. These are the rights of thinking, and publishing our thoughts by speaking or writing: the right of free commerce: the right of personal freedom. There are instruments for administering the government, so peculiarly trust-worthy, that we should never leave the legislature at liberty to change them. The new constitution has secured these in the executive and legislative departments; but not in the judiciary. It should have established trials by the people themselves, that is to say by jury. There are instruments so dangerous to the rights of the nation, and which place them so totally at the mercy of their governors, that those governors, whether legislative or executive, should be restrained from keeping such instruments on foot but in well defined cases. Such an instrument is a standing army. We are now allowed to say such a declaration of rights, as a supplement to the constitution where that is silent, is wanting to secure us in these points. The general voice has legitimated this objection. It has not however authorized me to consider as a real defect, what I thought and still think one, the perpetual re-eligibility of the  president. But three states out of 11. having declared against this, we must suppose we are wrong according to the fundamental law of every society, the lex majoris partis, to which we are bound to submit. And should the majority change their opinion, and become sensible that this trait in their constitution is wrong, I would wish it to remain uncorrected as long as we can avail ourselves of the services of our great leader, whose talents and whose weight of character I consider as peculiarly necessary to get the government so under way as that it may afterwards be carried on by subordinate characters.  
I must give you sincere thanks for the details of small news contained in your

THE tranfaiftions which have taken place in our  
country, fill every patriotic mind with pleal&#x27;ure ;  
inasmuch as they realize the confidence which had  
been reposed in the native good sense of the peo­  
ple ; that whenever their public affairs get obvi­  
ouf.y wrong, they would interfere, and set them  
to rights.—The example of changing a conllitu­  
tion, by aflemb|ing the wife men of the States,  
inlleaa of aflembling armies, will be worth as  
much to the world, as the former examples Ame­  
rica has given it.—The conllitution which has  
been the result of our deliberations, is unqueltion­  
ably, the wisest ever yet presented to men ; and  
the accommodations of interells, which it has  
adopted, are greatly pleasing to those, who have  
been anxiously concerned upon this point, having  
realized how difficult it was to accommodate thole  
interells.  
A concurrence of opinion, however,  
autliorifes to fay, that this conllitution has some  
defects: It is, perhaps, not one ofthe least, that  
the important rights, not placed in lecurity by  
the frame ofthe conllitution itfelf, were not ex­  
plicitly secured by a supplementary declaration.  
There are rights, which it is useless to surrender  
to the government; and which, yet, governments  
have been always fond to invade :—There are the  
rights of thinking, and publilhing our thoughts,  
by speaking and writing: the rights of free com­  
merce : the right of personal freedom : There  
are inilruments for adminilleriiig the govern­  
ment, so peculiarly trult-wortliy, that we lliould  
never leave the legillature at liberty to change  
them.—The new conllitution has secured these in  
the legiflativeand executive departments ; but not  
in the judiciary.—lt Ihould have ellablifhed trials  
by the people tliemlelves, that is to fay by jury.  
There are inilruments so dangerous to the rights  
of the nation, and which place tliemf&#x27;o totally at  
the mcrcy of their governors, that those gover­  
nors, whether legillative or executive, lliould be  
rellrainedfrom keeping such inilruments on foot,  
but in well defined cases. Such an inllrument is  
a llandi.&#x27;g army.  
Such a supplement to the conllitution, where  
that is lilent, is wanting to secure us in these  
points. The general voice has legitimated this ob­  
jection ;and though it does not authorise us to con­  
lideras a defect, the perpetual re-eligibilitv ofthe  
Prelidcnt, but three States out of eleven having  
declared againll this, it may nevertheless be con­  
fulercd as one, and lliould the majority change  
their opinion, as to this point, yet it is devoutly  
to be w.ilhed, that this may remain unaltered, as  
long as we can avail ourf&#x27;elves of the services of  
our great leader, whose talents, and whose weight  
of character, are peculiarly necellary, to get the  
government so under way, as that it may after­  
wards be carried on by subordinate characters

we can form 110 idea of. The frivolities 01

Men women, and children talk notning elie :  
That the press groans with daily productions,  
which in point of boldness, make an Engliftiman  
stare who has hitherto thought liiinfelf the bol­  
tleft of men. A compleat revolution in the go­  
vernment of that country, has, within wvo years  
/Winning with the Notables of 1 787) been effect­  
ed merely by the force of public opinion ; and this  
revolution has not cost a single life :  
That the allembly of the States&#x27; General was  
to beain the -.:7th of April, in which the repre­  
sentation of the people will be perfect, but will be  
alloyed by an equal number of the Clergy and  
Nobility. The hrft question they will have to  
decide will be, Whether they lhall vote by orders,  
or by persons. It is fuppol&#x27;ed, upon good grounds,  
that the majority of the Nobles arc already dilpof­  
odto join the Twrs Etat—in deciding that the vote  
lhall be by persons ; this is the opinion a-la-mode  
at present, and mode has acted a wonderful part  
in the present instance : all the handsome young  
women, for example, are for the Tiers Etat— and  
this is an army, more powerful in France, than  
000,000 men of the King ; add to this, that the  
cpurt itfelfis for the Tiers Ei.it, as the only agent  
that can call forth resources which, have hitherto  
lain dormant in the hands of the non-contributing  
orders :  
That the King has engaged to relinquilh the  
power of laying, continuing, or appropriating  
taxes He has engaged also to call the S i&#x27;AT ES­  
GENERAL periodically—to l&#x27;ubmit Letters de  
Cachet to lepal relti iction—to conlent 10 the free­  
dom of the prels ; and that all this lhall be fixed,  
by a fundamental Confbitution, which lhall bind  
his fuccellors :  
That a participation in the Lcgillature will be  
hi lilted 011—the public mind being l&#x27;o 1 ipened up­  
on all these subjeCts, that there leems now to he  
but one opinion : That the C lergy, however, have  
an opinion of tlieir own, and different from this—  
also the old men among the Nobles ; but tlieir  
voice is fupprefled among the general one of the  
&#x27; nation :  
That thewriiings which have been published  
onthisoccafion, are some of them very valuable,  
bccaule Unfettered by the prejudices under which  
the Englilli labor. They give a full lcope to rea  
foil, and strike out truths as yet unperceived, and  
unacknowledged in Britain : An Englifliman, doz­  
ing under a kind of half-reformation, is not exci­  
ted to think, by such gross absurdities as Hare a  
frenchman in theface wherever he looks,whether  
it be towards the throne, or towards the altar.  
■ It appears upon the whole, that France will  
&#x27;&#x27;nave as full a portion of liberty dealt our to her as  
ihe can bear at prefent,confideringhow uninform­  
ed the mass of her people is : This circumstance  
may prevent an immediate eftablilhment of the  
trial by jury.  
The pallied state of the executive in England,  
is a fortunate circumstance for France, a* it affords  
them time to arrange their affairs internally : The  
consolidation and funding of their debts, will give  
France atredit which will enable them to do what  
theypleafe.  
It is pretty certain, that the war, for the present  
year, will be confined to the two Empires and Den­  
mark, against Turkey and Sweden : Pruflia may  
be engaged : The disturbances of Poland may  
break out into overt aiits ; but it will be a power  
divided in itfelf, and so of no weight. France and  
England may be ready to take the iield next yeas.  
The Engliih papers, and the Englilli ministry  
fay their King is well. He is better ; but not well.  
•No malady requires a longer time to ensure a-  
its letum, than insanity : Time alone can  
difb accidental insanity from habitual lu­  
nacy. ,  
That nation, however, lias in its own true stile,  
run into all the extravagance of expensive re­  
joicings on this event : How far this spirit lias  
been aided by the reflection, that Mr. Pitt, ill  
consequence, is to continue at the head of

minister was ever more popular—nor held that  
popularity upon more independent principles.

difficult, if not impossible, to employ it to any dangerous extent  
upon the people and their electors ; and the result was the adoption  
of the clause permitting repeated consecutive reélections as it now  
stands. Jefferson, who was in France while the Convention was in  
session, thus writes of this provision. Alluding to the fact that the  
general voice of the country had legitimated an objection by him  
previously mentioned upon another point, he adds :  
  
“Tt has not, however, authorized me to consider as a réal defect  
what I thought and still think one, the perpetual reéligibility of the  
President. But three States out of eleven having declared against  
this, we must suppose we are wrong according to the fundamental  
law of every society, the lex majoris partis, to which we are bound  
to submit. And should the majority change their opinion, and  
become sensible that this trait in their Constitution is wrong, I  
would wish it to remain uncorrected as long as we can avail our-  
selves of the services of our great leader, whose talents and whose  
weight of character I consider as peculiarly necessary to get the  
Government so under way as that it may afterward be carried on  
by subordinate characters.”  
  
It was this conviction of the peculiar fitness of Washington for  
the place he had filled during eight years which led many, opposed

“The operations which have taken place in America lately fill me with  
pleasure. In the first place, they realize the confidence I had that when-  
ever our affairs go obviously wrong the good sense of the people will in-  
terpose and set them to rights. The example of changing a constitution  
by assembling the wise men of the State instead of assembling armies will  
be worth as much to the world as former examples we had given them.  
The Constitution, too, which was the result of our deliberations, is unques-

So did the fathers who are gone to their account shout and  
vaunt their champions, and vote; so fora hundred years and  
more have the whole American people done, and only on one  
dread question was the fateful appeal taken from the ballot to  
the bullet.

merely by the force of public opinion, aidéd, indeed, by the  
want of money, which the dissipations of the court had  
brought on. And this revolution has not cost a single  
life, unless we charge to it a little riot lately in Bretagne,  
which began about the price of bread, became afterward  
political, and ended in the loss of four or five lives. ...  
The writings published on this occasion are, some of them,  
very valuable; because, unfettered by the prejudices under  
which the English labor, they give a full scope to reason,  
and strike out truths as yet unperceived and unacknowl-  
edged on the other side the Channel. An Englishman doz-  
ing under a kind of half reformation is not excited to think  
by such gross absurdities as stare a Frenchman in the face  
wherever he looks, whether it be towards the throne or the  
altar. In fine, I believe this nation will, in the course of  
the present year, have as full a portion of liberty dealt out  
to them as the nation can bear at present, considering how  
uninformed the mass of their people is. This circumstance  
will prevent the immediate establishment of the trial by
