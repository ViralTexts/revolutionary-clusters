ouse Esqr.” The paper was read to the American Philosophical Society on June 20, 1788. When it appeared in the society’s next volume of Transactions (1793), it bore the title “A new and curious Theory of Light and Heat; in a letter from Dr. B. Franklin to David Rittenhouse, Esq.”  
  
  
  
  
[June 25, 1784]  
  
Universal Space, as far as we know of it, seems to be fill’d with a subtil Fluid, whose Motion, or Vibration; is called Light.  
This Fluid may possibly be the same with that which being attracted by and entring into other more solid Matter, dilates the Substance, by separating the constituent Particles, and so rendering some Solids fluid, and maintaining the Fluidity of others: of which Fluid when our Bodies are totally depriv’d, they are said to be frozen; when they have a proper Quantity, they are in Health and fit to perform all their Functions; it is then called natural Heat; when too much it is called Fever; and when forc’d into the Body in too great a Quantity from without, it gives Pain by separating and destroying the Flesh &amp; is then called burning,—and the Fluid so entring &amp; acting is called Fire.  
While organiz’d Bodies animal or vegetable are augmenting in Growth, or are supplying their continual Waste, is not this done by attracting and consolidating this Fluid, called Fire, so as to form of it a Part of their Substance; and is it not a Separation of the Parts of such Substance which dissolving its solid State, sets that subtil Fluid at Liberty, when it again makes its appearance as Fire.  
For the Power of Man relative to Matter, seems limited to the dividing it, or to mixing the various kinds of it, or changing its Form and Appearance by different Compositions of it, but does not extend to the making or creating of new Matter, or annihilating the old: Thus if Fire be an original Element or kind of Matter its Quantity is fix’d and permanent in the Universe. We cannot destroy any Part of it, or make addition to it. We can only separate it from that which confines it &amp; so set it at Liberty, as when we put Wood in a Situation to be burnt; or transfer it from one Solid to another, as when we make Lime by burning Stone, a Part of the Fire dislodg’d from the Wood being left in the Stone.  
  
May not this Fluid when at Liberty be capable of penetrating &amp; entring into all Bodies organiz’d or not: quitting easily in totality those not organiz’d, and quitting easily in part those which are; the part assum’d and fix’d remaining till the Body is dissolv’d.—  
Is it not this Fluid which keeps asunder the Particles of Air, permitting them to approach or separating them more in Proportion as its Quantity is diminish’d or augmented?  
Is it not the greater Gravity of the Particles of Air, which forces the Particles of this Fluid to mount with the Matter to which it is attach’d as Smoke or Vapour?  
Does it not seem to have a great Affinity with Water, since it will quit a Solid to unite with that Fluid, &amp; go off with it in Vapour, leaving the Solid cold to the Touch, &amp; the degree measurable by the Thermometer?—  
The Vapour rises attach’d to this Fluid but at a certain height they separate, and the Vapour descends in Rain retaining but little of it, in Snow or Hail less. What becomes of that Fluid? Does it rise above our Atmosphere and mix with the universal Mass of the same kind?  
Or does a Spherical Stratum of it, denser or less mix’d with Air, attracted by this Globe, &amp; repell’d or push’d up only to a certain height from its Surface by the greater Weight of Air remain there, surrounding the Globe and proceeding with it round the Sun.  
In such case, as there may be a Continuity or Communication of this Fluid thro’ the Air quite down to the Earth, is it not by the Vibrations given to it by the Sun that Light appears to us; and may it not be, that every one of the infinitely small Vibrations, striking common Matter with a certain Force, enters its Substance, is held there by Attraction, and augmented by succeeding Vibrations, till the Matter has receiv’d as much as their Force can drive into it?—  
Is it not thus that the Surface of this Globe is continually heated by such repeated Vibrations in the Day, &amp; cooled by the  
  
Escape of the Heat when those Vibrations are discontinu’d in the Night, or intercepted &amp; reflected by Clouds?  
Is it not thus that Fire is amass’d in and makes the greatest Part of the Substance of combustible Bodies?  
Perhaps when this Globe was first form’d and its original Particles took their Place at certain Distances from the Centre in proportion to their greater or less Gravity the Fluid Fire attracted towards that Center might in great Part be oblig’d as lightest to take place above the rest, and thus form the Sphere of Fire above suppos’d Which would afterwards be continually diminishing by the Substance it afforded to organiz’d Bodies, and the Quantity restor’d to it again by the Burning or other Separating of the Parts of those Bodies?  
Is not the natural Heat of Animals thus produc’d, by separating in digestion the Parts of Food, and setting their Fire at Liberty?—  
Is it not this Sphere of Fire which kindles the wandring Globes that sometimes pass thro’ it in our Course round the Sun, have their Surface kindled by it, and burst when their included Air is greatly rarified by the Heat on their burning Surfaces?—  
May it not have been from such Considerations that the antient Philosophers suppos’d a Sphere of Fire to exist above the Air of our Atmosphere

their functions; it is then calied natu-  
rai heat: When too much, it is called  
fever ; and when forced into the body  
intoo great a quantity trouwithout, it  
gives pain by teparating and deliroying  
the fleth, and 1s then called burning ;  
and the fluid fo entering and acting is  
called fire.  
  
W hile organized bodies, animal or  
vegetable, are augmenting in growth,  
or are {up plying their continual watte,  
is not this done by attracting and con-  
folida&#x27;ing this And cailed fire, fo as to  
form of it a part of their fubftance;  
and is it not a feparation of the parts  
of fuch fubliance, which, diffolving its  
folid ftate, fets that fubtie fluid at lib-  
erty, when it again makes its appear-  
ance as fire ?  
  
For the power of mean relative to  
matter feems limited to the dividing it,  
or mxing the various kinds of it, or  
changing its form and appearance by  
different compofitions of it; but does  
not extend tu the making or creating  
of new matter, or annihilating the  
old ;: Thus if fire be an original  
element, orkind of matter, its quantity  
is fixed and permanent in the world.  
We cannot deitroy any part of it, or  
make addition toit; wecan only fep-  
avate it from that which confines it,  
and fo fet it at liberty, as when we  
put wood in a fituation to be burnt ;  
or transfer it from one folid to anoth-  
er, as when we make lime by burning  
ftone, a part of the fire diflodged from  
the wood being left in the flone.  
May not this fluid when at liderty be  
Capable of penetrating and entering  
into all bodies organized or not, quit-  
ting eafily in totali&#x27;y thofe not organ-  
ized; and quitting eafilyin part thofe  
which are; the part affumed and  
fixed remaining till the body is dif.  
folved ?  
  
Is it not this fluid which keeps a-  
funder the particles of air, permit-  
ting them to approach, or feparat-  
ing them more, in proportion as its  
quantity is diminithed or augmented ?  
Is it not the greater gravity of the  
particles of air, which forces the par-  
ticles of this fluid to mount with the  
matter to which it is attached, as  
fmoke or vapour?  
  
Does it not feem to have a great af-  
  
finity with water, fince it will quit a fol.  
id to unite with that fluidjand go off  
with it in Vapour,ieaving the folid cold  
to the touch, and the degree mealura-  
ble by the thermometer?  
  
The vapour r:fes attached to this  
fluid, but at a certain height they fep-  
arate, and the Vapour deicends in  
rain, retaining but tittle of it, in fuow  
or hail leis. What becomes of that  
fluid ? Does it rife above our atmof.  
phere, and mix equally with the uni-  
verlal mats of the tame kiadi Or  
does a fpherical ftratum of it, denier,  
or lefts mixed with air, attracted by  
this globe, andrepelied or puthed up  
only toa certain height from its ture  
tuce, by che greater weight of air, ree  
main there furrounding the globe,  
and proceeding with it round te  
fun.  
  
In fuch cafe, as there may be a  
continuity or communication of this  
fiuid through the air quite down to the  
earth, isit not by the vibrations given  
to it by the fun that light appears to  
us; and may tt not be, that every  
one of the infinitely {mall vibrations,  
firiking common matter with acertain  
force, enter its fubiiance, are eld  
there by attraction, and augmented  
by fucceeding vibrations, ull. the  
matter has received as much as their  
force can drive into it ?  
  
Is it not thus that the furface of  
this globe is continuaily heated by  
fuch repeated vibrations in the day,  
and cooled by the efcape of the heat,  
when thofe vibrations are difcontnu-  
edin the night, or intercepted and  
reflected by clouds ?  
  
Js it not thus that fire is amaff-  
ed, and makes the greate(t part  
of the fubltance of combullible bo-  
dies?  
  
Perhaps when this globe was firft  
formed, and its original particies  
took their place at certain didances  
from the centre, in proportion to  
their greater or lefs gravity. the fluid  
fire, attracted towards that centre,  
might in great part be obliged, as  
lighteft, to take place above the reft,  
and thus form the {phere of fire above  
fappofed, which would afterwards be’  
continually diminifhing by the fub-  
{tance it afforded to o ganized bodies,  
and the quantity reitored to it co

Anew and curious Theory of Light and Heat ; ina letter  
Srom Dr. B. Franklin to David Rittenhoufe, E/9.:  
  
Read June NIVERSAL fpace, as far as we know of  
were, it, feems to be filled with a fubtil fluid, whofe  
motion, or vibration, is called light. This.  
  
  
  
6 THEORY or  
  
This fluid may poflibly be the fame with that which  
being attracted by and entering into other more folid mat-  
ter, dilates the fubftance, by feparating the conftituent par-  
ticles and fo rendering fome folids fluid, and maintaining  
the fluidity of others; of which fluid when our bodies  
are totally deprived, they arefaid to be frozen; when they  
have a proper quantity, they are in health, and fit to per-  
form all their fundtions; it is then called natural heat ;  
when too much, it is called fever; and when forced into  
the body in too great a quantity from without, it gives  
pain by feparating and deftroying the flefh, and is then  
called burning; and the fluid e entering and acting is  
called fire.  
  
While organized bodies, animal or vegétable, are aug-  
menting in growth, or are fupplying their continual wafte,  
is not this done by attrating and confolidating this fluid,  
called fire, fo as to form of it a part of their fubftance ;  
and is it not a feparation of the parts of fuch fubftance,  
which diffolving its folid ftate, fets that fubtil fluid at lib-  
erty, when it again makes its appearance as fire?  
  
For the power of man relative to matter, feems limited  
to the feparating or mixing the various kinds of it, or  
changing its form and appearance by different compofiti-  
onsof it; but does not extend to the making,or creating  
of new matter, or annihilating the old: thusif fire be an  
original element or kind of matter, its quantity is fixed and  
permanent in the univerfe. We cannot deftroy any part  
of it, or make addition to it. Wecan only feparate it  
from that which confines it, and fo fet it at liberty, as when  
we put wood in a fituation to be burnt; or transfer it from  
one folid to another, as when we make lime by burning  
ftone, a part of the fire diflodged from the fuel being left  
in the ftone. May not this fluid when at liberty be capa-  
ble of penetrating and entering into all bodies, organized  
  
or not: quitting eafily in totality thofe not organized, and  
quitting  
  
  
  
-  
  
LIGHT ann HEAT. 4  
  
quitting eafily in part thofe which are; the part affumed  
and fixed remaining till the body is diffolved?  
  
Is it not this fluid which keeps afunder the particles of  
air, permitting them to approach, or feparating them more  
in proportion as-its quantity is diminifhed or augmented?  
  
ds it not the greater gravity of the particles of air,  
which forces the particles of this fluid to mount with the  
matters to which it is attached as {moke or vapour?  
  
Does it not feem to havea great affinity with water,  
fince it will quit a folid to unite with that fluid, and go off  
with it in vapour ;. leaving the folid cold to the touch, and  
the degree meafurable by the thermometer?  
  
The vapour rifes attached to this fluid, but at a certain  
height they feparate, and the vapour defcends in rain re=  
taining but little of it, in fnow or hail lefs. What be+  
comes of that fluid? Does it rife above our atmofphere, and  
mix with the univerfal mafs of the fame kind?  
  
Or does a fpherical fhell or ftratum of it, denfer, as lefs  
mixed with air, attracted by this globe; and repelled or  
pufhed up only to a certain height from its furface by the  
greater weight of air, remain there furrounding the globe  
and proceeding with it round the fun ?:  
  
In fuch cafe, as there may be a continuity or commu~  
nication of this fluid through the air quite down to the  
earth, is it not by the vibrations given to it by the fun that  
light appears to us; and may it not be, that every one of  
the infinitely fmall vibrations, ftriking common matter  
with a certain force, enters its fubftance, is held there by  
attraction, and augmented by fucceeding vibrations, till  
the matter has received as much as their force can drive  
into it ?  
  
Is it not thus that the furface of this globe is continually  
heated by fuch repeated vibrations in the day, and cooled  
by the efcape of the heat when thofe vibrations are difcon—  
tinued in the night, or intercepted and reflected by clouds?  
  
Is  
  
  
  
T H E.O-R, ¥ 2 o  
  
Is it not thus that4ire is amaffed and makes the greateft  
part of the fubftance of combuftible bodies ?  
  
Perhaps when this globe. was firft formed and its origi-  
nal particles took their place at certain diftances from the

Anew and curious Theory of Light and Heat ; ina letter  
JSrom Dr. B. Franklin to David Rittenhoufe, E/q.  
  
Read June NIVERSAL fpace, as far as we know of  
wy ST it, feems to be filled witha fubtil fluid, whofe  
motion, or vibration, is called light. This:  
  
  
  
  
  
6 THEORY or  
  
This fluid may poflibly be the fame with that which  
being attracted by and entering into other more folid mat-  
ter, dilates the fubftance, by feparating the conftituent par-  
ticles and fo rendering fome folids fluid, and maintaining  
the fluidity of others; of which fluid when our bodies  
are totally deprived, they are faid to be frozen; when they  
have a proper quantity, they are in health, and fit to per-  
form all their functions; it is then called natural heat ;  
when too much, it is called fever; and when forced into  
the body in too great a quantity from without, it gives  
pain by feparating and deftroying the flefh, and is then  
called burning; and the fluid fe entering and acting is  
called fire.  
  
While organized bodies, animal or vegetable, are aug-  
menting in growth, or are fupplying their continual wafte,  
is not this done by attraGting and confolidating this fluid,  
called fire, fo as to form of it a part of their fubftance ;  
and is it not a feparation of the parts of fuch fubftance,  
which diffolving its folid ftate, fets that fubtil fluid at lib-  
erty, when it again makes its appearance as fire ?  
  
For the power of man relative to matter, feems limited  
to the feparating or mixing the various kinds of it, or  
changing its form and appearance by different compofiti-  
ons of it; but does not extend to the making, or creating  
of new matter, or annihilating the old: thusif fire be an  
original element or kind of matter, its quantity is fixed and  
permanent in the univerfe. We cannot deftroy any part  
of it, or make addition to it. We can only feparate it  
from that which confines it, and fo fet it at liberty, as when  
we put wood in a fituation to be burnt; or transfer it from  
one folid to another, as when we make lime by burning  
ftone, a part of the fire diflodged from the fuel being left  
in the ftone. May not this fluid when at liberty be capa-  
ble of penetrating and entering into all bodies, organized  
  
or not: quitting eafily in totality thofe not organized, and  
: quitting  
  
  
  
  
  
LIGHT ann’ HEAT. 5  
  
quitting eafily in part thofe which are; the part affumed  
and fixed remaining till the body is diffolved?  
  
Is it not this fluid which keeps afuncer the particles of  
air, permitting them to approach, or feparating them more  
in proportion as:its quantity is diminifhed or augmented?  
  
Is it not the greater gravity of the particles of air,  
which forces the particles of this fluid to mount with the  
matters to which it is attached as f{moke or vapour?  
  
Does it not feem to havea great affinity with water,  
fince it will quit a folid to unite with that fluid, and go off  
with it in vapour ;. leaving the folid cold to the touch, and  
the degree meafurable by the thermometer?  
  
The vapour rifes attached to this fluid, but at a certain  
height they feparate, and the vapour defcends in rain re=  
taining but little of it, in fnow or hail lefs. What be+  
comes of that fluid? Does it rife above our atmofphere, and  
mix with the univerfal mafs of the fame kind?  
  
Or does a fpherical fhell or ftratum of it, denfer, as lefs  
mixed with air, attracted by this globe, and repelled or  
pufhed up only to a certain height from its furface by the  
ereater weight of air, remain there furrounding the globe  
and proceeding with it round the fun ?.  
  
In fuch cafe, as there may be a continuity or commu~  
nication of this fluid through the air quite down to the  
earth, is it not by the vibrations given to it by the fun that  
light appears to us; and may it not be, that every one of  
the infinitely fmall vibrations, ftriking common matter  
with a certain force, enters its fubftance, is held there by  
attraction, and augmented by fucceeding vibrations, till  
the matter has received as much as their force can drive  
into it ?  
  
Is it not thus that the furface of this globe is continually  
heated by fuch repeated vibrations in the day, and cooled  
by the efcape of the heat when thofe vibrations are difcon~  
tinued in the night, or intercepted and reflected by clouds?  
  
Is  
  
  
  
T H E.O:-R ¥ °: or  
  
Is it not thus thatire&#x27;i is amafled and makes the greateft  
part of the fubflance of combuttible bodies ?  
  
Perhaps when this globe was firft formed and its origi-  
nal particles took their place at certain diftances from the  
centre in proportion to their greater or lefs gravity, the  
fluid fire attracted towards that centre might in great part  
be obliged, as lighteft, to take place above the reft, and  
thus form the {phere of fire above fuppofed; which would  
afterwards be continually diminithing by the fubftance it  
afforded to organized bodies, and the quantity reftored to  
it avain by the burning or other feparating of the parts  
of thofe bodies ?  
  
Is not the natural heat of animals thus produced by fe-  
parating in digeftion the parts of food, and fetting their  
fire at liberty?  
  
Is it not this fphere of fire which kindles the wandering  
elobes that fometimes pafs through it in our courfe round  
the fun, have their furface kindled by it, and burft when  
their included air is greatly rarefied by the heat on their

UNIVERSAL Ipacc, as tar as we  
k now of it, feems to be tilled with a fubile  
fluid, w hofe motion, or vibration,  
called light. This fluid may pullibly be  
the fame with that which being at¬  
tracted by, and entering into other more  
lolid matter, dilates the fubftance by  
ieparatii.g the conflituent particles,  
and fo rendering fomc foiids fluids, and  
maintaining the fluidity of others ; of  
which fluid when our (3odics are totally  
deprived, they arc faid to be frozen;  
wlun they have a proper ipiantiiy, they  
arc in health, and tit to perform all  
their functions ; it is then called natu¬  
ral heat ; when too much, it is called  
fevir ; and when forced into the body  
in too great quantity from without, it  
gives pain by fv-paraimg and deflroying  
the lle!h,and is then called burning, and  
the fluid fo entering aid adting b called  
lire.  
  
W&#x27;hilc organized bodies, animal or  
vegetable, arc augmenting in growth,  
or arc fupplying their continual waftc,  
is not this done by attradting and con-  
folidaiing this fluid called fire, fo as to  
form’of it a part of their fubflance  
And is it not a feparation of the parts  
of fuch fubftance, which, diflblving its  
folid Ifatc, fets that fubtic fluid at li¬  
berty, when it again makes its appear¬  
ance as tire ?  
  
For the power of man relative to  
matter feems limited to the dividing  
it, or mixing the various kinds of it, or  
changing its form’ and appearance by  
dirt&#x27;erent compofiiio&#x27;ns of it ; but dots  
not extend to the making or treating  
of new matter, or annihilating the old.  
Thus, if fire be an original element,  
or kind of matter, its quantity is fixed  
and permanent in the world. We can¬  
not deftroy any part of it, or make ad¬  
dition to it; we can only feparate it  
from that which confines it, and fo fet  
it at liberty ; as when we put wood in a  
fituarion to be burnt; or transfer it from  
one folid to another, as when we make  
lime by burning ftonc, a part of the tire  
difl&lt;Hlgcd from the wood being left in  
the ftonc. May not this fluid, when at  
libirty, be capable of penetrating and  
entering mto till bo&lt;lits, organized or  
not, quilting c.ifilv in totality thofe not

any part of it, or make addition to  
it. We can only feparate it from  
that which confines it, and fo fet it  
at liberty, as when we put wood in a  
fituation to be burnt} or transfer it  
from one folid to another, as when  
we make lime by burning done, a

It is not the greater gravity of the

matters to which it is attached, as  
finoke or vapour ?  
  
Does it not feem to have a great

a folid to unite with that fluid, and

The vapour riles attached to this  
fluid ; but at a certain height they  
feparate, and the vapour defeends in  
rain, retaining but little of it, in fnow  
or bail lels. What becomes of that

assy, June 25, 1784,  
® UNIVERSAL space, as far as we know of it, seems to be  
ay with subtle fluid, whose motion, or vibration, is called  
ight.  
  
*This fluid may possibly be the same with that which, be.  
ing attracted by and entering into other more solid matter,  
dilates the substance, by separating the constituent particles,  
and so rendering some solids fluid, and maintaining the fluid-  
ity of others re which fluid when our bodies are totally de.  
prived, they are said to be frozen ; when they have a  
quantity they are in health, and fit to perform all their func.  
tions; it is then called natural heat: when too much, it is  
called fever; and when forced into the body in too great a  
quantity from without, it gives pain by separating and de.  
stroying the flesh, and is then called burning ; the fluid  
so entering and acting is called fire.  
  
While organized bodies, animal or vegetable, are augment.  
ing in growth, or are supplying their continual waste, is_not  
this done by attracting and consolidating this fluid called fire,  
so as toform of it a part of their substance? and is it nota  
separation of the parts of such substance, which, dissolving  
its solid state, sets that subtle fluid at liberty, when it again  
makes its appearance as fire ?  
  
For the power ofman relative to matter seems limited to  
the dividing it, or mixing the various kinds of it, or changing  
its form and appearance by different compositions of it; but  
does not extend to the making or creating of new matter, or  
annihilating the old: thus, if fire be an original element, or  
kind of matter, its quantity is fixed and permanent in the  
world. We cannot destroy any part of it, or make addition  
to it; we can only separate it from that which confines it,  
and set it at liberty, as when we put wood in a situation to  
be burnt; or transfer it from one solid to another, as when  
we make lime by burning stone, a part of the fire dislod  
from the wood being left in the stone. May not this fluid  
when at liberty be capable of penetrating and entering into  
all bodies, organized or not; quitting easily in totality those  
not epuaieal and quitting easily in part those which are;  
the part assumed and fixed remaining till the body is dise  
solved?  
  
It is not this fluid which keeps asunder the particles of air,  
permitting them to approach, or separating them more, in  
proportion as its quantity is diminished or argumented, Is it  
not the greater gravity of the particles of air, which forces  
the particles of this fluid to mount with the matters to which  
it is attached, as smoke or vapour ?  
  
Does it not seem to have a great affinity with water, since  
it will quit a solid to unite with that fluid, and go off with it  
in vapor, leaving the solid cold to the touch, and the degree  
measurable by the thermometer ?  
  
The vapor rises attached to this fluid; but at a certain  
height they separate, and the vapor descends in rain, retain  
ing but little of it, in snow or hail less, What becomes of  
that fluid? Does it rise above our atmosphere,.and mix  
equally with the universal mass of the same kind ? Or-does a  
spherical stratum of it, denser, or less mixed with air, ate  
tracted by this globe, and repelled or pushed up only to a cere  
tain height from its surface, by the greater weight of air, re-  
main there surrounding the globe, and proceeding with it  
round the sun ? é  
  
In such case, as there may be a continuity or communi-  
cation of this fluid through the air quite down to the earth, is  
it not by the vibrations given to it by the sun that light ap-  
  
ears to us; and may it not be, that every one of the infinite-  
k small vibrations, striking common matter with a certain  
+ hea enter its substance, are held there by attraction, and  
augmented by succeeding vibrations, till the matter has re-  
  
ceived as much as their force can drive into it?  
  
Ts it not thus that the surface of this globe is continually  
heated by such repeated vibrations in the day, and cooled by  
the escape of the heat when those vibrations are discon-  
tinued in the night, or intercepted and reflected by clouds ?  
  
Is it not thus that fire is amassed, and makes the greatest  
part of the substance of combustible bodies ? pe  
  
Perhaps when this globe was first formed, and its original  
particles took their place at certain distances from the centre,  
in proportion to their greater or less gravity, the fluid fire,  
attracted towards that centre, might in great part be obliged,  
as lightest, to take place above the rest, and thus form the  
sphere of fire above supposed, which would afterward be  
continually diminishing by the substance it afforded to 4  
nized bodies; and the quantity restored to it again by the  
burning or other separating of the parts of those bodies,  
  
Is not the natura! heat of animals thus produced, by sepa-  
rating in digestion the parts of food, and setting their fire at li  
berty?  
  
HY it not this sphere of fire which kindles the wandering  
globes that sometimes pass through it in our course round the  
sun, have their surface kindled by it and burst when their in-  
cluded air is greatly rarifted by the heat on their burning sur  
faces
