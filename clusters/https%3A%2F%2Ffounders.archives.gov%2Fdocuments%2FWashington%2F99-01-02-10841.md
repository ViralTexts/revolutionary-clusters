Resolved,  
That the unanimous thanks of the Officers of the Army be presented to His Excellency the Commander in Chief, for his excellent address, and the communications he has been pleased to make to them, and to assure him that the Officers reciprocate his  
affectionate expressions with the greatest Sincerity of which the human heart is capable.  
The address from the Army to Congress, the Report of the Committee from the Army, and the Resolutions of Congress of the 25th January being read.  
On a motion by General Putnam, seconded by Genl Hand  
Voted  
That a Committee be appointed immediately to draw up some Resolutions, expressive of the business before us, and to report in half an hour, that this Committee consist of one General, one Field Officer, and one Captain. That General Knox, Colonel Brooks and  
Captain Howard compose the said Committee.  
The Report of the Committee having been brought in and fully considered Resolved Unanimously That at the commencement of the present War, the Officers of the American Army engaged in the service of their Country from the purest love and attachment to the  
rights and liberties of human nature, which motives still exist in the highest degree: and that no circumstances of distress or danger shall induce a conduct that may tend to sully the reputation and Glory of which they have acquired at the price of their blood, and eight  
years faithful services.  
Resolved Unanimously That the Army continue to have an unshaken confidence in the justice of Congress and their Country, and are fully convinced that the representatives of America will not disband or disperse the Army,  
untill their Accounts are liquidated. Balances accurately ascertained and adequate funds established for Payment And in this arrangement the Officers expect that the half Pay or a commutation of it, should be efficaciously comprehended.  
Resolved Unanimously That His Excellency the Commander in Chief be requested to write to His Excellency the President of Congress earnestly entreating the most speedy decision of that Honorable body upon the subjects of our late address, that was forwarded  
by a Committee of the Army, some of whom are waiting upon Congress for the result. In the alternative of Peace or War, this event would be highly satisfactory, and would produce immediate tranquility in the minds of the Army: and prevent any further machinations of designing  
men to sow discord between the civil and Military powers of the United States.  
Resolved Unanimously That the Officers of the American Army view with abhorrence, and reject with disdain the infamous propositions contained in a late anonymous address to the Officers of the Army, and resent with indignation the secret attempts of some  
unknown persons to collect the Officers together in a manner totally subversive of all discipline and good order.  
Resolved Unanimously That the thanks of the Officers of the Army be given to the Committee who presented to Congress the late address of the Army, for the wisdom and prudence with which they have conducted that business and that a Copy of the proceedings of  
this day be transmitted by the President to Major General McDougall, and that he be requested to continue his Solicitations at Congress untill the objects of his mission are accomplished.  
The Meeting was then desolved.

thanks “‘ to His Excellency, and assuring  
him that the officers reciprocated his  
affectionate expressions with the greatest  
sincerity of which the human heart is  
capable.” The resolution was carried  
by a unanimous vote, and a committee  
appointed to prepare resolutions express-  
ing the sentiment of the convention on  
the business that had brought them to-  
gether.  
  
The resolutions were reported in half  
an hour, and were passed unanimously.  
They expressed a firm confidence in the  
justice of Congress and its desire and  
ability to liquidate the claims of the  
officers against the country. It was  
also resolved, “ That the officers of the  
American army view with abhorrence  
and reject with disdain the infamous  
propositions contained in a late anony-  
mous address to the officers of the army,  
and resent with indignation the secret  
attempts of some unknown persons to  
collect the officers together in a manner  
totally subversive of all discipline and  
good order.”  
  
Thus right triumphed, while the spirit  
of misrule withdrew abashed.  
  
A few weeks later — April 19 — the  
Temple was the theatre of another most  
impressive scene,—the publishing of the  
proclamation of Congress announcing the  
cessation of hostilities.  
  
Washington had been in receipt of  
news of peace for some days, but hesi-  
tated to publish it to the army, lest  
the troops who had enlisted for the  
war should consider their engagement  
filled and demand a discharge. But on  
the 18th, unable longer to conceal the  
good news, he issued his orders, direct-  
ing that the proclamation of Congress
