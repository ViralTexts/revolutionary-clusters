(Circular)  
Sir  
Head Quarters Newburgh June 8-21st 1783  
  
The great object, for which I had the honor to hold an Appointment in the service of my Country being accomplished, I am now preparing to resign it into the hands of Congress, and to return to that domestic retirement; which it is well known I left with the  
greatest reluctance, a retirement for which I have never ceased to sigh through a long and painfull absence, and in which (remote from the noise and trouble of the World) I meditate to pass the remainder of life, in a state of undisturbed repose: But before I carry this  
resolution into effect, I think is a duty incumbent on me, to make this my last official communication, to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been pleased to produce in our favor, to offer my sentiments respecting some important subjects which appear to  
me to be intimately connected with the tranquility of the United States, to take my leave of your Excellency as a public Character, and to give my final blessing to that Country, in whose service I have spent the prime of my life, for whose sake I have consumed so many  
anxious days and watchful nights, and whose happiness, being extremely dear to me, will always constitute no inconsiderable part of my own.  
Impressed with the liveliest sensibility on this pleasing occasion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the more copiously on the subjects of our mutual felicitation—When we consider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtfull nature of  
the Contest, and the favorable manner in which it has terminated, we shall find the greatest possible reason for gratitude and rejoycing—This is a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent &amp; liberal Mind, whether the event in contemplation be considerd  
as the source of present enjoyment or the parent of future happiness; and we shall have equal occasion to felicitate ourselves, on the lot which Providence has assigned us, whether we view it in a natural, a political, or a moral point of light.  
The Citizens of America, placed in the most enviable condition, as the sole Lords and Proprietors of a vast tract of Continent, comprehending all the various Soils and Climates of the World and abounding with all the necessaries and conveniences of life,  
are now, by the late satisfactory pacification, acknowledged to be possessed of absolute freedom and Independancy—They are from this period to be considered as the Actors, on a most conspicuous Theatre, which seems to be peculiarly designated by Providence for the display of  
human greatness and felicity, here they are not only surrounded with every thing which can contribute to the completion of private and domestic enjoyment, but Heaven has crowned all its other blessings by giving a fairer opportunity for political happiness, than any other  
Nation has ever been favored with—Nothing can illustrate these observations more forcibly than a recollection of the happy conjuncture of times and circumstances under which our Republic assumed its Rank among the Nations—the foundation of our Empire was not laid in the  
gloomy Age of ignorance and superstition, but at an Epocha when the rights of Mankind were better understood and more clearly defined, than at any former period—The researches of the human Mind after social happiness have been carried to a great extent, the treasures of  
knowledge acquired by the labours of Philosophers, Sages and Legislators, through a long succession of years, are laid open for our use and their collected wisdom may be happily applied in the establishment of our forms of Government. The free cultivation of letters, the  
unbounded extension of Commerce, the progressive Refinement of manners, the growing liberality of sentiment, and, above all, the pure and benign light of Revelation, have had a meliorating influence on Mankind and encreased the blessings of Society. At this Auspicious period  
the United States came into existence as a Nation, and if their Citizens should not be completely free &amp; happy, the fault will be entirely their own.  
Such is our situation, and such are our prospects: but nowithstanding the Cup of blessing is thus reached out to us, notwithstanding happiness is ours if we have a disposition to seize the occasion and make it our own, yet it appears to me there is an  
option still left to the United States of America; that it is in their choïce and depends upon their conduct, whether they will be respectable and prosperous or contemptible and Miserable as a Nation. This is the time of their political probation: this is the moment when the  
eyes of the whole World are turned upon them—This is the moment to establish or ruin their National Character for ever—This is the favorable moment to give such a tone to our fœderal Government, as will enable it to answer the ends of its institution—or this may be the ill  
fated moment for relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the cement of the Confederation and exposing us to become the sport of European Politicks, which may play one State against another, to prevent their growing importance and to serve their own interested purposes;  
for according to the System of Policy the States shall adopt at this moment, they will stand or fall, and by their confirmation or lapse, it is yet to be decided whether the Revolution must ultimately be considered as a blessing or a curse: a blessing or a curse, not to the  
present Age alone, for with our fate will the destiny of unborn Millions be involved.  
With this conviction of the importance of the present Crisis, silence in me would be a crime; I will therefore speak to your Excellency the language of freedom and sincerity without disguise. I am aware, however, that those who differ from me in political  
sentiment may perhaps remark I am stepping out of the proper line of my duty, and they may possibly ascribe to arrogance or ostentation what I know is alone the result of the purest intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which disdains such unworthy motives; the part I  
have hitherto acted in life; the determination I have formed of not taking any share in public business hereafter; the ardent desire I feel and shall continue to manifest of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of War, the benefits of a wise and liberal  
Government, will, I flatter myself, sooner or later convince my Country men that I could have no sinister views in delivering, with so little Reserve, the opinions contained in this address.  
There are four things, which I humbly conceive are essential to the well being, I may even venture to say to the existence, of the United States as an independent Power.  
1st An indissoluble Union of the States under one federal Head.  
2ndly A sacred regard to public Justice.  
3dly The adoption of a proper Peace Establishment—and   
4thly The prevalence of that pacific and friendly disposition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and policies, to make those mutual concessions which are requisite to the general prosperity, and, in  
some instances, to sacrifice their individual advantages to the interest of the community.  
These are the pillars on which the glorious fabrick of our Independancy and National Character must be supported —Liberty is the basis—and whoever would dare to sap the foundation or overturn the Structure under whatever specious pretexts he may attempt it,  
will merit the bitterest execration and the severest punishments which can be inflicted by his injured Country.  
On the three first Articles I will make a few observations, leaving the last to the good sense and serious consideration of those immediately concerned.  
Under the first head, altho it may not be necessary or proper for me in this place to enter into a particular disquisition of the principles of the Union and to take up the great question which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and  
requisite for the States to delegate a larger proportion of Power to Congress or not, yet it will be a part of my duty, and that of every true Patriot; to assert without reserve and to insist upon the following positions—That unless the States will suffer Congress to exercise  
those prerogatives they are undoubtedly invested with by the Constitution, every thing must very rapidly tend to Anarchy and confusion—that it is indispensible to the happiness of the individual States that there should be lodged somewhere, a supreme power to regulate and  
govern the general concerns of the confederated Republic, without which the Union cannot be of long duration—That there must be a faithfull and pointed compliance on the part of every State with the late proposals and demands of Congress, or the most fatal consequences will  
ensue; that whatever measures have a tendency to dissolve the Union, or contribute to violate or lessen the Sovereign Authority, ought to be considered as hostile to the Liberty and Independancy of America and the Authors of them treated accordingly; and lastly, that unless  
we can be enabled, by the concurrence of the States, to participate of the fruits of the Revolution, and enjoy the essential benefits of civil Society, under a form of Government so free and uncorrupted, so happily guarded against the danger of oppression as has been devised  
and adopted by the Articles of Confederation, it will be a subject of regret that so much blood and treasure have been lavished for no purpose; that so many sufferings have been encounter’d, without a compensation and that so many sacrifices have been made in vain.  
Many other considerations might here be adduced to prove, that without an entire conformity to the spirit of the Union we cannot exist—as an independant Power. It will be sufficient for my purpose, to mention but one or two which seem to me of the greatest  
ïmportance. It is only in our United Character, as an Empire, that our Independance is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded or our Credit supported among foreign Nations—the Treaties of the European Powers with the United States of America will have no validity on a  
dissolution of the Union. We shall be left nearly in a State of Nature, or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and necessary progression from the extreme of Anarchy to the extreme of Tyranny, and that arbritary power is most easily established  
on the ruins of Liberty abused to Licentiousness.  
As to the second Article, which respects the performance of public justice, Congress have in their late address to the United States almost exhausted the Subject, they have explained their ideas so fully and have enforced the obligations the States are  
under to render compleat justice to all the public Creditors, with so much dignity and energy, that in my opinion no real friend to the honour and Independancy of America, can hesitate a single moment respecting the propriety of complying with the just and honorable measures  
proposed—If their Arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence, especially when we recollect that the System referred to, being the result of the collected wisdom of the Continent, must be esteemed, if not perfect, certainly the  
least objectionable of any that could be devised, and that if it shall not be carried into immediate execution, a National bankruptcy, with all its deplorable consequences, will take place before any different plan can possibly be proposed and adopted, so pressing are the  
present circumstances! and such is the alternative now offerd to the States!  
The ability of the Country to discharge the debts which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted, an inclination I flatter myself will not be wanting: the path of our duty is plain before us—honesty will be found on every experiment to be the  
best and only true policy—let us then as a Nation be just—let us fulfill the public Contracts which Congress had undoubtedly a right to make for the purpose of carrying on the War, with the same good faith we suppose ourselves bound to perform our private engagements; in the  
mean time let an attention to the chearfull performance of their proper business as individuals and as members of Society be earnestly inculcated on the Citizens of America—then will they strengthen the hands of Government &amp; be happy under its protection, every one will  
reap the fruit of his Labours, every one will enjoy his own acquisitions without molestation and without danger.  
In this state of absolute freedom and perfect security, who will grudge to yield a very little of his property to support the common interests of Society and ensure the protection of Government? who does not remember the frequent declarations at the  
commencement of the War that we should be completely satisfied, if at the expence of one half, we could defend the remainder of our possessions! where is the Man to be found who wishes to remain indebted for the defence of his own person and property to the exertions, the  
bravery and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honor and of gratitude? In what part of the Continent shall we find any Man or body of Men who would not blush to stand up and propose measures purposely calculated to rob the Soldier of  
his Stipend and the public Creditor of his due and were it possible that such a flagrant instance of injustice could ever happen, would it not excite the general indignation and tend to bring down upon the authors of such measures the aggravated vengeance of Heaven?  
If after all, a spirit of disunion or a temper of obstinacy and perverseness should manifest itself in any of the States; if such an ungracious disposition should attempt to frustrate all the happy effects that might be expected to flow from the Union; if  
there should be a refusal to comply with the Requisitions for funds to discharge the annual Interest of the public Debts and if that refusal should revive again all those jealousies and produce all those evils which are now happily removed, Congress, who have, in all their  
transactions, shewn a great degree of magnanimity and justice, will stand justified in the sight of God and Man and the State alone which puts itself in opposition to the aggregate wisdom of the Continent and follows such mistaken and pernicious councils, will be responsible  
for all the Consequences.  
For my own part, conscious of having acted, while a servant of the public, in the manner I conceived best suited to promote the real interests of my Country, having in consequence of my fixed belief, in some measure, pledged myself to the Army that their  
Country would finally do them compleat and ample Justice and not wishing to conceal any instance of my official conduct from the eyes of the World, I have thought proper to transmit to your Excellency the inclosed collection of papers relative to the half-pay &amp;  
commutation granted by Congress to the Officers of the Army. From these communications my decided sentiment will be clearly comprehended, together with the conclusive reasons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this measure in the most earnest  
and serious manner. As the proceedings of Congress, the Army and myself are open to all and contain in my opinion sufficient information to remove the prejudices and errors which may have been entertained by any, I think it unnecessary to say anything more, than just to  
observe, that the resolutions of Congress now alluded to, are undoubtedly as absolutely binding upon the United States, as the most solemn Acts of Confederation or Legislation. As to the idea which, I am informed, has in some instances prevailed, that the half pay and  
Commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious Light of a pension, it ought to be exploded forever—that provision should be viewed as it really was, a reasonable compensation offerd by Congress at a Time when they had nothing else to give to the Officers of the Army for  
services then to be performed. It was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the Service—it was a part of their hire, I may be allowed to say, it was the price of their blood and of your Independancy—it is therefore more than a common debt, it is a debt of honor—it  
can never be considered as a pension or gratuity nor be cancelled untill it is fairly discharged.  
With regard to a distinction between Officers and Soldiers, it is sufficient that the uniform experience of every Nation of the World combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the discrimination—Rewards in proportion to the Aids the Public  
derives from them, are unquestionably due to all its Servants—In some Lines, the Soldiers have perhaps generally had as ample a compensation for their Services, by the large bounties which have been paid them, as their Officers will receive in the proposed commutation; in  
others, if besides the donation of Lands, the payment of Arrearages of Cloathing and Wages (in which Articles all the component parts of the Army must be on the same footing) we take into the estimate the bounties many of the Soldiers have received and the gratuity of one  
years full pay which is promised to all, possibly their situation (every circumstance being duly considered) will not be deemed less eligible than that of the Officers, should a farther Reward however be judged equitable, I will venture to asert no one will enjoy greater  
satisfaction than myself, on seeing an exemption from Taxes for a limitted time (which has been petitioned for in some instances) or any other adequate compensation or immunity, granted to the brave defenders of their Countrys cause; but neither the adoption or rejection of  
this proposition, will in any manner affect, much less militate against, the Act of Congress by which they have offer’d five Years full pay in lieu of half pay for life, which had been before promised to the Officers of the Army.  
Before I conclude the Subject of public justice, I cannot omit to mention the obligations this Country is under to that meritorious class of veteran non Commission’d Officers and Privates who have been discharged for inability, in consequence of the  
resolution of Congress of the 23d April 1782, on an annual pension for life; their peculiar sufferings, their singular merits and claims to that provision, need only be known, to interest all the feelings of humanity in their behalf; nothing but a punctual payment of their  
annual allowance, can rescue them from the most complicated misery, and nothing could be a more melancholy and distressing sight, than to behold those who have shed their blood or lost their limbs in the service of their Country, without a shelter, without a friend and  
without the means of obtaining any of the necessaries of life or comforts of life compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door! Suffer me to recommend those of this description belonging to your State to the warmest patronage of your Excellency and your  
Legislature.  
It is necessary to say but a few words on the third topic which was proposed and which regards particularly the defence of the Republic—As there can be little doubt but Congress will Recommend a proper Peace Establishment for the United States in which a  
due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the Militia of the Union upon a regular and respectable footing—If this should be the case, I would beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the strongest terms—the Militia of this Country must be considerd as the  
Palladium of our security and the first effectual resort, in case of hostility; It is essential therefore, that the same system should pervade the whole—that the formation &amp; discipline of the Militia of the Continent should be absolutely uniform and the same species of  
Arms, Accoutrements &amp; Military Apparatus should be introduced in every part of the United States. No one, who has not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expence &amp; confusion which result from a contrary System, or the vague Arrangements which have  
hitherto prevailed.  
If in treating of political points, a greater latitude than usual has been taken in the course of this address—the importance of the Crisis and the magnitude of the objects in discussion, must be my apology—It is, however, neither my wish or expectation,  
that the preceding observations should claim any regard, except so far as they shall appear to be dictated by a good intention, consonant to the immutable rules of Justice—calculated to produce a liberal system of Policy and founded on what ever experience may have been  
acquired by a long and close Attention to public business—Here I might speak with the more confidence, from my actual observations and if it would not swell this Letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds I had prescribed myself, I could demonstrate to every mind open to  
conviction, that in less time &amp; with much less expence than has been incurred, the War might have been brought to the same happy, conclusion if the resources of the Continent could have been properly drawn forth—that the distresses and disappointments, which have very  
often occurred, have in too many instances resulted more from a want of energy in the Continental Government, than a deficiency of means in the particular States—That the inefficacy of measures, arising from the want of an adequate authority in the supreme Power, from a  
partial compliance with the requisitions of Congress in some of the States and from a failure of punctuality in others, while it tended to damp the Zeal of those which where more willing to exert themselves, served also to accumulate the expences of the War and to frustrate  
the best concerted plans; and that the discouragement, occasioned by the complicated difficulties &amp; embarrasments in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long ago produced the dissolution of any Army, less patient, less virtuous and less persevering  
than that which I have had the honor to Command. But while I mention these things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our Federal Constitution, particularly in the prosecution of a War, I beg it may be understood, that as I have ever taken a pleasure in gratefully  
acknowledging the assistance and support I have derived from every class of Citizens, so shall I always be happy to do justice to the unparralled exertions of the individual States on many interesting occasions.  
I have thus freely disclosed, what I wished to make known, before I surrendered up my Public trust to those who committed it to me—the task is now accomplished—I now bid adieu to your Excellency, as the Chief Magistrate of your State at the same time I bid  
a last farewell to the cares of Office and all the employments of public life.  
It remains then to be my final and only request, that your Excellency will communicate these sentiments to your legislature at their next meeting and that they may be considered as the Legacy of one who has ardently wished on all occasions to be usefull to  
his Country and who even in the shade of Retirement will not fail to implore the divine benediction upon it.  
I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would have you and the State over which you preside, in his holy protection that he would incline the hearts of the Citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination &amp; obedience to Government, to entertain a  
brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow Citizens of the United States at large and particularly for their brethren who have served in the field—and finally that he would most graciously be pleas’d to dispose us all to do Justice, to love mercy and to  
demean ourselves, with that Charity, humility &amp; pacific temper of mind, which were the Characteristicks of the Divine Author of our blessed Religion &amp; without an humble immitation of whose example in these things, we can never hope to be a happy Nation. With the  
greatest regard and esteem, I have the honor to be Sir Your Excellency’s Most Obedient and most humble Servant  
  
Go: Washington

H E great object for which I had  
the honour to hold an appointment  
in the ſervice of my country being  
accompliſhed, I am now preparing to reſign  
it into the hands of Congreſs, and return to  
that domeſtic retirement, which, it is well:  
known, I left with the greateſt reluQance  
a retirement for which I have never ceaſed!  
to ſigh through a long and painful abſence,  
in which (remote from the noiſe and trou-  
ble of the world) I meditate to paſs the re-  
mainder of life in a ſtate of undiſturbed re-  
poſe : but, before I carry this reſolution inta  
offect, I think it a duty incumbent on me  
to make this my laſt official communication,

to congtatulate you on the glorious events  
which Heaven has been pleaſed to produce  
in our favour, to offer my ſentiments re-  
ſpecting ſome important ſubjects, which ap-  
pear to me to be intimately connected with  
the tranquility of the United States, to take  
my leave of your Excellency as a public  
character, and to give my final bleſſing to  
that country in. whoſe ſervice J have ſpent  
the prime of my life; for. whoſe fake 1

watchful nights; and whoſe happineſs, be-  
ing extremely dear to me, will always con-  
ſtitute no inconſiderable part of my own, _  
Impreſſed with the hvelieſt ſenſibility on  
this pleaſing occaſion, I will claim the indul-  
gence of dilating the more copiouſly on the  
ſubject of our mutual felicitation. When we  
conſider the magnitude of the prize we con-  
tended for, the doubtful nature of the con-  
teſt, and the favourable manner in which it  
has terminated, we ſhall find the greateſt  
poffible reaſon for gratitude and rejoicing :  
this is a theme that will afford infinite de-

whether the event in contemplation be con-

or the parent of future happineſs ; and we  
ſhall have equal occaſion to felicitate ourſelves  
on the lot which Providence has aſſigned us,  
whether we view it in a natural, political,  
or moral point of light.  
  
The citizens of America, placed in the  
moſt enviable condition, as the ſole lords  
and proprietors of a vaſt tract of continent,  
comprehending all the various ſoils and cli-  
mates of the world, and abounding with all  
the neceſſaries and conveniencies of life, are  
now, by the late ſatisfactory pazification,  
acknowledged to be poſſeſſed of abſolute  
freedom and independency; they are from  
this period to be conſidered as the actors on  
a moſt conſpicuous theatre, which ſeems to  
be peculiarly deſignated by Providence for the  
diſplay of human greatneſs and felicity : here  
they are not only ſurrounded with every  
thing that can contribute to the completion  
of private and domeſtic enjoyment, but  
Heaven has crowned all its other bleſſings  
  
by giving a ſurer opportunity for political  
B 2 happineſs,  
  
N  
happineſs, than any other nation has ever  
been favoured with. Nothing can illuſtrate  
theſe obſervations more forcibly than a recol-  
lection of the happy conjuncture of times  
and circumſtances, under which our Re-  
public aſſumed its rank among the na-  
tions.— The foundation of our empire was  
not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and  
  
  
rights of mankind were better underſtood,  
and more clearly defined, than at any former  
period : reſearches of the human mind af-  
ter ſocial happineſs have been carried to a  
great extent ; the treaſures of knowledge  
acquired by the labours of philoſophers,  
ſages, and legiſlators, through a long ſuc-  
ceſſion of years, are laid open for uſe ; and  
their collected wiſdom may be happily ap-  
plied in the eſtabliſhment of our forms of  
government: the free cultivation of letters,  
the unbounded extenſion of commerce, the  
progreſſive refinement of manners, the grow-  
ing liberality of ſentiment, and, above all,  
the pure and benign light of Revelation,  
have had a meliorating influence on man-  
* 1 — kind,  
  
  
WE  
kind, and increaſed the bleſſings of ſociety.  
At this auſpicious period the United States  
came into exiſtence as a-nation ; and if their  
citizens ſhould not be completely free and  
happy, the fault will be entirely their own.  
Such is our ſituation, and ſuch are our  
proſpects; but notwithſtanding the cup of  
blefling is thus reached out unto us; not-  
withſtanding happineſs is ours, if we have  
a diſpoſition to ſeize the occaſion, and make  
it our own ; yet it appears to me, there is  
an option ſtill left to the United States of  
America, whether they will be reſpectable  
and proſperous, or contemptible and miſera-  
ble, as a nation; this is the time of their po-  
litical probation ; this is the moment, when  
the eyes of the whole world are turned upon  
them ; this is the moment to eſtabliſh or  
ruin their national character for ever ; this  
is the favourable moment to give ſuch a tone |  
to the fœderal government, as will enable it  
to anſwer the ends of its inſtitution ; or this  
may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the  
powers of the union, annihilating the ce-

went of the confederation, and expoling us to  
become the ſport of European politics, which  
may play one State againſt another, to pre-  
vent their growing importance, and to ſerve  
their own intereſted purpoſes. For, accord-  
ing to the ſyſtem of policy the States ſhall  
adopt at this moment, they will ſtand or  
fall; and, by their confirmation or lapſe,  
it is yet to be decided, whether the revolu-  
tion muſt ultimately be conſidered as a bleſ-  
ſing or a curſe; a bleſſing or a curſe, not to  
the preſent Age alone, for with our fate will  
the deſtiny of unborn millions be involved.  
Wich this conviction of the importance of  
the preſent criſis, filence in me would be a  
crime ; I will therefore ſpeak to your Excel-  
lency the language of freedom and fincerity,  
without diſguiſe. I am aware, however,  
thoſe who differ from me in political ſenti-  
ments may perhaps remark, I am ſtepping  
out of the proper line of my duty ; and they  
may poſſibly aſcribe to arrogance or oſtenta-  
tion, what I know is alone the reſult of the  
pureſt intention: but the rectitude of my  
own. heart, which diſdains ſuch unworthy  
  
motives z  
  
(178)  
  
motives; the part I have hitherto afted im  
life; the determination I have formed of not  
taking any ſhare in public buſineſs hereafter z.  
the ardent deſite I feel, and ſhall continue to  
manifeſt, of quietly enjoying in private life,  
after all the toils of war, the benefits of a  
wiſe and liberal government, will, I flatter.  
myſelf, ſooner or later, convince my couns,  
trymen, that I could have no ſiniſter views in,  
delivering, with ſo little reſerve, the opi-  
nions contained in this addreſs,  
  
There are four things which, I 9  
conceive, are eſſential to the well - being, I  
may even venture to ſay to the exiſtence, of  
the United States as an Independent Power;

bliſhment, And,  
  
4thly, The prevalence of that pacific nl  
friendly diſpoſition among the people of the  
United States, which will induce: them to  
forget their local prejudices and policies, to  
make thoſe mutual congelizons which are re-

quiſite to the general proſperity, and, in  
ſome inſtances, to ſacrifice their individual  
advantages to the intereſt of the community.  
Theſe are the pillars on which the glo-  
rious fabric of our independency and na-  
tional character muſt be ſupported.— Liberty  
is the baſis and whoever would dare to ſap  
the foundation, or overturn the ſtructure,  
under whatever ſpecious pretexts he may at-  
tempt it, will merit the bittereſt execration,  
and the ſevereſt puniſhment which can be  
inflicted by his injured country.  
  
On the three firſt articles I will make a  
few obſervations, leaving the laſt to the good  
ſenſe and ſerious conſideration of thoſe im-  
mediately concerned.  
  
Under the firſt head, although it may not  
be neceffary or proper for me in this place to  
enter into a particular diſquiſition of the  
principles of the union, and to take up the  
great queſtion which has been frequently  
agitated, whether it be expedient and requi-  
fite for the States to delegate a larger pro-  
portion of power to Congreſs, or not; yet it  
will be a part of my duty, and that of every  
5 trug  
  
1

to infiſt upon the following poſitions ;—  
That unleſs the States will ſuffer Congreſs  
to exerciſe thoſe prerogatives they are un-  
doubtedly inveſted with by the Conſtitution,  
every thing muſt very rapidly tend to anarchy  
and confuſion.— That it is indiſpenſible to  
the happineſs of the individual States, that  
there ſhould be lodged ſomewhere a ſupreme  
power to regulate and govern the general  
concerns of the confederated Republic, with-  
out which the union cannot be of long du-  
ration. — That there muſt be a faithful and  
pointed compliance on the part of every  
State with the late propoſals and demands  
of Congreſs, or the moſt fatal conſequences  
will enſue.—That whatever meaſures have  
a tendency to diſſolve the union, or contri.  
bute to violate or leſſen the ſovereign autho-  
rity, ought to be conſidered as hoſtile to the  
  
liberty and independency of America, and  
the authors of them treated accordingly.—  
  
And laſtly, That unleſs we can be enabled  
by the concurrence of the States to partici-  
  
pate of the fruits of the revolution, and

enjoy the eſſential benefits of civil ſociety,  
  
under a form of government ſo free and  
uncorrupted, ſo happily guarded againſt the  
danger of oppreſſion, as has been deviſed and  
adopted by the articles of confederation, it  
will be a ſubject of regret, that ſo much  
blood and treaſure have been laviſhed for no  
purpoſe ; that ſo many ſufferings have been  
encountered without a compenſation, and  
that ſo many ſacrifices have been made in  
vain. Many other conſiderations might here  
be adduced to prove, that without an entire  
conformity to the ſpirit of the Union, we  
cannot exiſt as an independent power. It  
will be ſufficient for my purpoſe to mention  
but one or two, which ſeem to me of the  
greateſt importance. It is only in our united  
character, as an empire, that our indepen-  
  
  
be regarded, or our credit ſupported among  
Foreign Nations, The treaties of the Eu-  
  
ropean Powers with the United States of  
America will have no validity, on a diſſolu-  
tion of the union. We ſhall be left nearly  
in a ſtate of nature; or we may find by our  
  
| own  
  
  
  
tural progreſſion from the extreme of anarchy  
to the extreme of tyranny ; and that arbi-  
trary power is moſt eaſily eſtabliſhed on the  
ruins of liberty abuſed to licentiouſneſs.  
  
As to the ſecond article, which reſpects  
the performance of public juſtice; Congreſs  
have; in their late Addreſs to the United  
States; almoſt exhauſted the ſubject; they  
have explained their ideas fo fully, and have  
enforced the obligations the States are under  
to render complete juſtice to all the public  
creditors; with ſo much dignity and energy,  
that, in my opinion, no real friend to the  
honour and independency of America can  
heſitate a ſingle moment reſpecting the pro-  
priety of complying with the juſt and ho-  
nourable meaſures propoſed: If their argu-  
ments do not produce conviction, I know of  
nothing that will have greater influence, ef-  
pecially when we recolle&amp; that the ſyſtem  
referred to, being the reſult of the collected  
wiſdom of the Continent, muſt be eſteenied,  
if not perfect, certainly the leaſt objection-  
able of any that could be deviſed ; and that,  
  
C2 If  
  
N.  
if it ſhall not be carried into immediate  
  
  
fore any different plan can poſſibly be pro-  
poſed or adopted; ſo preſſing are the preſent  
  
  
The ability of the country to diſcharge the  
  
  
I flatter myſelf, will not be wanting ; the  
  
  
will be found, on every experiment, to be  
the beſt and only true policy. Let us then,  
  
  
contracts which Congreſs had undoubtedly  
a right to make for the purpoſe of carrying  
on the war, with the ſame good faith we  
ſuppoſe ourſelves bound to perform our pri-  
vate engagements. In the mean time let an  
attention to the cheerful performance of theit  
proper buſineſs, as individuals, and as mem-

ſtrengthen the hands of government, and  
be happy under its protection. Every one  
will reap. the fruit of his labours; every one  
will enjoy his on acquiſitions, without mo-  
leſtation and without danger. 4giltma  
| In this ſtate of abſolute freedom and per-  
ſect ſecurity, who will grudge to yield a verx  
little of his property to ſupport the common  
intereſts of ſociety, and enſure the protection  
  
of government? Who does not remember  
the frequent declarations at the commence-  
  
ment of the war, That we, ſhould be com-  
pletely ſatisfied, if, at the expence of one  
half, we could defend the, remainder of our  
| poſſeſſions? Where is the Man to be found,  
who wiſhes to remain indebted for the de-  
fence of his own. perſon and property to ihe  
| exertions, the bravery and the blood of  
others, without, making one generous effort  
to repay the debt of honour and of grati-  
tude ? In what part of the Continent ſhall  
we find any man, or body of men, Who  
would not bluſh to ſtand up, and propoſt  
meaſures purpoſely calculated to rob the ſol.  
dier of his ſtipend, and the public creditor of  
his  
  
( #4 )  
  
his due? And were it poſſible that ſuch a  
flagrant inſtance of injuſtice could ever hap-  
pen, would it not excite the general indig-  
nation, and tend to bring down upon the  
authors of ſuch meaſures, the aggravated  
vengeance of Heaven ? If after all, a ſpirit  
of diſunion, or a temper of obſtinacy and  
perverſeneſs, ſhould manifeſt itſelf in any of  
the States ; if ſuch an ungracious diſpoſition  
ſhould attempt to fruſtrate all the happy ef-  
fects that might be expected to flow from  
the union; if there ſhould be a refuſal to  
comply with requiſitions for funds to diſ-  
charge the annual intereſt of the public  
debts; and if that refuſal ſhould revive all  
thoſe jealouſies and produce all thoſe evils  
which are now happily removed; . Congreſs,  
who have in all their tranſactions ſhewn a  
great degree of magnanimity and juſtice, will  
and juſtified in the fight of God and man!  
and that State alone, which puts itſelf in op-  
poſition to the aggregate wiſdom of the Con-  
tinent, and follows ſuch miſtaken and per-  
nicious councils, will be ref ponfible for all  
the conſequences,  
  
  
For my own part, conſcious of having  
ated, while a ſervant of the public, in the  
manner I conceived beſt ſuited to promote  
the real intereſts of my country ; having, in  
conſequence of my fixed belief, in ſome mea-  
ſure pledged myſelf to the army, that their  
country would finally do them complete and  
ample juſtice ; and not wiſhing to conceal  
any inſtance of my official conduct from the  
eyes of the world; I have thought proper  
to tranſmit to your Excellency the incloſed  
collection of papers, relative to the half - pay  
and commutation granted by Congreſs to  
the officers of the army: from theſe commu»  
nications, my decided ſentiments will be  
clearly comprehended, together with the con-  
cluſive reaſons which induced me, at an ear-  
ly period, to recommend the adoption of this  
meaſure in the moſt earneſt and ſerious man-  
ner. As the proceedings of Congreſs, the  
army, and myſelf, are open to all, and con-  
tain, in my opinion, ſufficient information  
to remove the prejudice and errors which  
may have been entertained by any, I think  
it unneceſſary to ſay any thing more, than  
juſt  
  
  
«46-3  
  
juſt to obſerve, that the reſolutions of Con-  
  
  
and abſolutely binding upon the United  
States, as the moſt ſolemn acts of confedera-  
tion or legiſlation. |  
As to the idea which, I am informed,  
has in ſome inſtances prevailed, that the  
half-pay and commutation are to be regard-  
ed merely in the odious light of a penſion,  
it ought to be exploded for ever. That pro-  
viſion ſhould be viewed, as it really was, a  
reaſonable compenſation offered by Congreſs,  
at a time when they had nothing elſe to  
give to officers of the army for ſervices then  
to be performed. &#x27; It was the only means to  
prevent a total dereliction of the ſervice: it  
was a part of their hire; I may be allowed  
to ſay, it was the price of their blood, and  
of your independency ; it is therefore more  
than a common debt, it is a debt of honour;  
it can never be conſidered as a penſion, or  
gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly diſ-  
charged. |  
With regard to the diſtinction between  
officers and ſoldiers, it is ſufficient that the  
  
uniform  
  
  
uniform experience of every nation of the  
world, combined with our own, proves the  
utility and propriety of the diſcrimination,  
Rewards in proportion to the aid the Public  
draws from them, are unqueſtionably due  
to all its ſervants. In ſome lines, the ſoldiers  
have perhaps generally had as ample compen-  
ſation for their ſervices, by the large bounties  
which have been paid them, as their officers  
will receive in the propoſed commutation ;  
in others, if, beſides the donation of land,  
the payment of arrearages of clothing and  
wages (in which articles all the component  
parts of the army muſt be put upon the ſame  
footing), we take into the eſtimate the boun-  
ties many of the ſoldiers have received, and  
the gratuity of one year&#x27;s full pay, which is  
promiſed to all, poſſibly their fituation (every  
circumſtance being duly conſidered) will not  
be deemed leſs eligible than that of the of-  
ficers. Should a further reward, however, be  
judged equitable, I will venture to aſſert, no  
man will enjoy greater ſatisfaction than my-  
ſelf at an exemption from taxes for a limited  
time (which has been: petitioned for in ſome  
  
D | inſtances),  
  
*  
  
(18 )  
  
inſtances), or any other adequate immunity  
or compenſation granted to the brave defen-  
ders of their country&#x27;s cauſe : but neither the  
adoption or rejection of this propofition will  
in any manner affect, much leſs militate  
againſt, the act of Congreſs, by which they  
have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the  
half -pay for life which had been before  
promiſed to the officers of the army.  
  
Before I conclude the ſubject of public  
juſtice, I cannot omit to mention the obli-  
gations this country is under to that meri-  
torious claſs of veterans, the non-commiſ-  
ſioned officers and privates, who have been  
diſcharged for inability, in conſequence of  
the reſolution of Congreſs, of the 23d of  
April, 1782, on an annual penſion for life :  
their peculiar ſufferings, their ſingular  
- merits and claims to that proviſion, need  
only to be known, to intereſt the feelings  
of humanity in their behalf: nothing but  
a-punctual payment of their annual allow-  
ance can reſcue them from the moſt com-  
plicated miſery; and nothing could be a  
  
more melancholy and diſtreſſing fight, than  
to  
  
| ( 29 )  
to bebold thoſe who have ſhed their blood,  
or loſt their limbs, in the ſervice of their  
country, without a ſhelter, without a friend,  
and without. the means of obtaining any of  
the comforts or neceſſaries of lite, compel-  
led to beg their daily bread from door to |  
door. Suffer me to recommend thoſe of. this  
deſcription, belonging to your State, to the  
warmeſt patronage of your Excellency and  
your Legiſlature, *  
It is neceſlary to ſay but a few words on  
the third topic which was propoſed, and  
which regards particularly the defence of  
the Republic. As there can be little doubt  
but Congreſs will recommend a proper peace  
[eſtabliſhment for the United States, i in which  
a due attention will be paid to the i impor-  
tanceof placing the militia of the Unionupon  
2 regular and, reſpectable footing z. if this  
ſhould be the caſe, , I ſhould. beg leave to

ficulty, EXPENCE, and confuſion which  
  
  
  
If, in treating of political points, a greater  
  
  
muſt be my apology : : it is, however, neither  
my wiſh nor expectation, that the preced-  
ing obſervations ſhould claim any regard,  
  
except ſo far as they ſhall appear to be dic-  
tated by a good intention, conſonant to the  
immutable rules of juſtice, calculated to  
produce a liberal ſyſtem of policy, and  
founded o on whatever experience may have  
  
( 21 )  
been acquired by a long and cloſe attention  
to public buſineſs. Here I might ſpeak  
with more confidence, from my actual ob-  
ſervations ; and if it would not ſwell this  
Letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds

to every mind open to conviction, that in  
leſs time, _— with much leſs expence than  
has been incurred, the war might have been  
brought to the ſame happy concluſion, if  
the reſources. of the Continent could have  
been properly called forth: that the diſtreſſes  
and diſappointments which have very often  
occurred, have, in too many inſtances, re-  
. ſulted more from want of energy in the  
Continental Government, chan a deficiency  
of means in the particular States : that the  
inefficacy of meaſures ariſing. from the want

requiſitions. of © Congreſs in ſome of the

concerted plans; and that thediſcouragement  
occaſioned by the complicated difficulties  
and embarraſiments in which our affairs  
were by this means involved, would have  
long ago produced the diſſolution of any  
army, leſs patient, leſs virtuous, and leſs  
perſevering, than that which I have had the  
honour to command, But while I mention  
thoſe things, which are notorious facts, a8  
the defects of our fœderal conſtitution, pas-  
ticularly in the proſecution of a war, I beg  
it may be underſtood, that as I have ever  
taken a pleaſure in gratefully acknowledging  
the aſſiſtance and ſupport I have derived  
from every claſs of citizens, ſo ſhall I al-

It remains, then, to be my final and only  
requeſt, your Excellency will communicate  
theſe ſentiments to your Legiſlature, at their  
next meeting; and that they may be conſi-  
dered as the legacy of one who has ardently  
wiſhed, on all occaſions, to be uſeful to his  
country, and who, even in the ſhade of re-  
tirement, will not fail to implore the divine  
benediction upon it.  
  
I now make it my earneſt prayer, that  
God would have you, and the State over  
which you preſide, in his holy protection;  
that he would incline the hearts of the ci-  
tizens to cultivate a ſpirit of ſubordination  
and obedience to Government; to entertain  
a brotherly affection and love for one another, -  
for their fellow-citizens of the United States  
at large, and particularly for their brethren  
who have ſerved in the field ; and finally,  
that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to  
diſpoſe us all to do juſtite, to love mercy,  
and to demean ourſelves with that charity,

were

inclination, I flatter inyfelf, will not l&gt;c

revive again all thofc jcaloufies and pio-  
iluce all thofc evils which arc now hap¬  
pily removed ; Congrefs, who have in  
all their tranfaffions mewn a great degree  
of magnanimity and jnflicc, will ftandjulti-  
fied in the hght of God and man 1 and  
that State alone, which puts &#x27;itfelf in  
oppofition to the aggregate wlfdom of the  
continent, and follows Inch mlflaken and  
pernicious councils, will be relponhble  
for all the confequcnces.  
  
For inv own part, cotifcioiis of having  
afted, while a Servant of the public, in  
the manner 1 conceived heft lulled to  
romoic the real iniercft of my country ;  
avlng, in confequence of my fixed be¬  
lief, in fomc meafurc, pledged myfelf  
to the army, that their country woiihl  
finally do them complete and ample jnf¬  
licc, and not wiftiing to conceal any in-  
ftance of my oirieial conduct frotn tlie  
eves of the world, 1 have thought pro¬  
per to tranfmit to your Excellency the  
inclofed collc6tion of papers relaiixc to  
the half-pay and commutation granted by  
Congrefs to the officers of the armv;  
from tlicfe communications, my decided  
fenilments will be clearly comprehended,  
together with the conchillve realons,  
whiclt induced me, at an^carly period, to  
recommend the adoption ot this meafurc  
In t!)c moft earneft and ferious manner.  
As the proceedings of Congrefs, ilie ar-  
inv, and myfelf are open to all, and con¬  
tain, in my opinion, fufficlent informa¬  
tion to remove the prejudices and errors  
whiih may have been entertained bv any,  
  
1 think it unneceftary&#x27; to fay any thing  
more, than jnit to obftrve, that the re-  
loljfions of (&#x27;ongrefs, now alluded to,  
are .is nndouhfedly and abfoluielv bind¬  
ing upon the nniicd States, as the in(M&gt;  
fvilcinn ads of confederation or le  
  
tioo.  
  
As to flic idea, which, I am inf rmed,  
has, in lomc liiftinccs prevailej, rliar&#x27;il.j  
half-pay and commutafK)ii me fo b* re-  
gardrd merely in the odiosis li;’ht or a  
pcnfion, it ought fo be exploded for ever:  
&quot;I&#x27;hat piovinon fhould be VK‘u\*d, as it  
really was, a rcafonabic toinpcuratiuu of¬  
  
fered by Congrefs, at a kmc when they  
had nothing elfc to give to the ofHccii of  
the army, for fervlce&gt;theii to be performed:  
it was tlie only means to prevent a total  
dcrelidion to the ieivlcc : it was a pan of  
their hire : 1 mav he allovvcu to fav, it  
w’as the price of their 1»1 ov.h&lt;, and of )our  
independency ; it is therefoic more thaa  
a common debt, it is a debt of honour ;  
it can never he coidideied as a peniion,  
or gratuity, nor cancelled until It is fair¬  
ly difcliargcd.  
  
Witli regard to the dilllndion between  
ofheers and foldieis, tt is (uHi.ieiit that  
the uniform experience of every iiatton  
of the world, combined wlih our own,  
proves the utility and propriety of the  
difcrimiriation. Rewards in propottioii  
to the ai&lt;is the public draws liom tlieid,  
are uncptciliondhle due to all itsieivants.  
  
In foine lines, the loldiers have perhapt  
generally had as ample compenlaiioii for  
their iei vices, by the large houniies which  
have been paid to iliem, as. their officers  
will receive in the propofed coinnuiiaii-

land, the payment of arieatages of cloth¬

component paifs of the army iniiil be  
pul upf?n the fame footing) we take Into  
the elllmaic*, the bounties many of the  
foldiers have received, and the gratiiitv  
of one veil’s full pav, which is piomiled

be judged equitable, I will veuiuir to

Heat Quarters, Newburgh, Fune 18,1733.  
  
SIR,  
*HE great objedt for which i had the ho»  
nour to hold an eppointmert in the fers  
  
vice of my country bging accomplithed, Jam  
new preparing to refign t into the hands of  
Congrefs, and return to that domeftic retiree  
ment which, it is well known, I left with the  
greateft relu&amp;ances a retirement for whith I  
have never ceaied to figh through a long and  
painful abfence, in which (remote from the  
noife and trouble of the’ world) I meditate ta  
pais the r nder of Jife, in a ftate of undif~  
turbed repofe: but, before I carry this refolu-  
tion into effect, I thnk it a duiy incumbent  
cn me to make this my laft official communi-  
cation, to congratulate you on the glorious  
events which Heaven has been pleafed to pros  
duce in our favouk, to offer my\fentimeors re-  
fpefing foe important fubjeéis, which ap-  
pear to me to be intimately connected with  
the tranquillity of the United States, to take  
my leave of your Excellency as a publiccha-  
ratte, and to give my final bleffing to chat  
country’ in whofe fervice I have {pent the  
  
prime  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
400 General Wafhington’s Circular Letter on his Refignation.  
  
prime of my life; for whofe fake I have con-  
fumed: fo many anxious days and watchful  
nights; and aviofe happinefs, being extremely  
dear to me, will always conftitute no inconfi-  
derable part of my own.  
  
Impwéifed with the livelieft fenfibility on  
this pleafing occafion, I will claim the indol-  
gence of dilating the more copivufly on the  
Subje&amp; ef os: mutval felicitation, When we  
confider the magnituce of the prize we con-  
tended for, the doubtful nature of the conteft,  
and the favourable m-nner in which it has  
terminated, we fhall find the greateft poffible  
reafon for gratitude and cejoicing. This is a  
theme thet wil! affird infinite delight to every  
benevolent and iiberal mind, whether the event  
in contempl:tion be confidered as the fource  
of prefent enjoyment, or the parent of future  
happinefs; and we fhall have equal occafion  
to felicitate ourfelves on the lot which Provi-  
dence has affigned us, whether we view it in a  
natural, a political, or moral point of light.  
  
The citizens of America, placed in the moft  
enviable condition, as che fole lords and pro-  
prietors of a vait traét of continent, compre-  
hending all the various foils and climates of  
the world, and abounding with all the neceffa-  
ries and conveniences of life, are now, by the  
late faiisfagtary pacification, acknowledged to  
be poflefied of abfolure freedom and independ-  
ency; they are, from this period, to be confi-  
dered at the a¢tors on a moft confpicuoue  
theatre, which feems to be peculiarly defig-  
nated by Providence for the difplay of human  
greatnefs and felicity. Here they are not fur-  
rounded with every thing that contribute to  
the completion of private 2nd domeftic enjoy-  
ment; but Heaven has crowned all its other  
bleffings by giving a fuser opportunity for. po-  
litical happinefs than any cther nation has  
ever been favoured with. Nothing can illuf-  
trate thefe obfervations more forcibly than a  
recolicétion of fhe happy conjunéture of times  
and circumflances under which our republic  
afflumed its rank among the nations.—The  
founda:ion of our empire was not laid in the  
gloomy age of ignorance and fuperftition, but  
at an epocha when the rights of mankind were  
bettex undesitood, and more clearly defined,  
than at any former period. Refearches of the  
howan mind after focial happinefs have been  
carried to 2 great extent; the treafures of  
knewledge acquired ty the labours of philo-  
fophers, faves and legiflators, through a long  
fucceffion of ye:rs, are Jaid open for vfe, and  
the&#x27;r collected wifdom may be happi&#x27;y applied  
in the efaulithment of our forms of govern-  
meat. The free cultivation of letters, the  
unbounded extenGion of commerce, the pro-  
grefive refinement of mansers, the growing  
liberality cf fentiment, and, above 2jl, the  
pure and benign light of revelation, have had  
2 melorating influence on mankind, and in-  
crcated the bieflings of focieiy, At this auf-  
picious period the Unned States came into  
exiflence asa nation, and if their titizens  
fhovld-not be completely free and hép;y, the  
fauit will be entirely their own,  
  
Such is our fituation, and fuch are our pro-  
fpeéts; but, notwithftanding the cup of blef-  
fing is thus reached out to us; notwithftand-  
happinefs is ours, if we have a difpofition to  
feize the ozcafion, and make it ovr own; yet  
it appears to me there is an option ftill left to  
the United States of America, whether they  
will be refpe€table and profpercus, or con-  
temptitle and miferable, as a nation; this is  
the time of their political probation; this is  
the moment, when the eyes of the whole  
world are turned upon them; this is the mo-  
ment to eftablifh or ruin their national cha-  
racter forever; this is the favourable moment  
to give {uch a tone to the federal government  
as will enable it to anfwer the ends of its in«  
ftitution; or this may be the ill-fated moment  
for relaxing the powers of the union, annihi-  
Jating the cement of the confederation, and  
expofing us to become the fpoit of Europcan  
politics, which may play one ftate againft an-  
other, to prevent their growing importance,  
and to ferve their own interefted purpofes. For  
according to the fyftem of policy the States  
fhall adopt at this moment, they wi&#x27;l ftand or  
fall; and, by their confirmation or lapfey it  
is yet fo be decided, whether the revolution  
muft ultimately be confidered as a bleffing ora  
curfe: —a blefling or a curfe, not to the prefent  
age alone, for with our fate will the deftiny of  
unborn millions be involved.  
  
With this convi€tion of the importance of  
the prefent crifis, filence in me would bea  
crime: I will therefore fpeak to your Excel-  
Jency the language of freedom and fincerity,  
without difguife. 1am aware, however, thofe  
who differ from me in political fentimen:s  
may, perhaps, remark, I am ftepping out of  
the proper line of my duty; and they may  
poflibly afcribe to arrogance or oftentation  
what I know is alone the refult of the pureft  
intention: but the reétitude of my own heart,  
which difdains fuch unworthy motives, the  
part I have hitherto aéted in life, and the de-  
termination I have formed of not taking any  
fhare in public bufinefs hereafter; the ardent  
defire | feel, and thall continue to manifeft, of  
quietly enjoying in private-life, after ali tke  
toils of war, the benefits of a wife and liberal  
government, will, I flatter myfelf, fooner or  
Jater, convince my countrymen that I could  
have no finifter views in’ delivering, with fo  
little referve, the opinions comtained in thie  
addrefs.  
  
Thre are four things, which, I humbly  
conceive, are effential to the well-being, I  
may even ventuse te fay, to the exiftence of  
the United States as an independent power.  
  
ift. An indiffoluble union of the States un:  
der one federal head.  
  
2dty. A facred regard to public juftice.  
  
gdly. The adoption of a proper peace eftab-  
lifhm-nt. And,  
  
4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and  
frien ly diipefstion among the people of the  
United States, which will induce them to for-  
get theis iocai prejudices and policies, to _  
  
thole

a = ex oe O NS  
  
  
  
  
  
Ceremonial of the Englith A nbaffadrefs at Verfailles,  
  
thofe mutual conceffions wh:ch are requifite  
to the profperity, and, in fome indances, to  
facrifice their individual advantages to the in-  
tereft of the community.  
  
Thete are the pillars on which the glorious  
fabric of our :mdependency and national cha-  
rater mutt be fupvorted. Liherty is the bafis  
—and whocver would dare &lt;o fap the founda-  
tion, or overturn she ftructure, under whatever  
fpecious pretext” he may attempt it, wil merit  
the bitrere? excerasions, and the fevereft pu-  
nifhment, whiche.n be inflifted by his injured  
coun&#x27;ry.  
  
Oa the three firft articles I wil! make a few  
obfervations, leaving the laft to the good fenfe  
and fer-ous confide:ation of thofe immediately  
concerned.  
  
Under the fir head, although it may not be  
neceflary or propenfer me on ihrs pla € to enter  
into a partivulor &lt;fquifition of the principles  
of the union, and to talte up the great quetion  
which has teen frcquenrly agitated, whether it  
be expevicn and requ fire for the States to de-  
legate w Jarger proportion of power to Con-  
grefs, or not; yet it will be 2 part of my duty,  
and that of every true patriot, to alert without  
referve, and to infift upon, the following pro-  
pofitionss That, unlefs ihe S ates wiil fuffer  
Congrefs to exercife thofe prerogatives they are  
uodoubtecly invefted with by the Confitution,  
every. thing muit very rapidiy tend to anarchy  
and confufion. That it is in:i‘penfable to the  
happincfs of the individua! Staies, that there  
fhould be lodges, fomewhere, a fupreme pow-  
er, to regulte and govern the general concerns  
of the confederated repusiic, wi hout which  
the union cannot be of Jo.ig duration  
  
That there moft be a faithtul and pointed  
eormpliance, on the part of every state, with  
the Jate propofals and demands of Cengrefs, or  
the moft fatal confequences wille:foe. That  
whatever meafures have a tendency to diffolve  
the union, or contribute to violate or leifen the  
fovereign authority, ought to be coafidered as  
hoftile to the liberty ‘and independetety of  
America, and the authors of them treated ac-  
cordingly. And, lalily, that anlefs we can be  
enabled, by the concurren:e of the States, to  
participate of the fruits of the revolution, and  
enjvy the effential benefics of civil fociety, un-  
der a form of government fo free and uncor-  
rupted, fo happily guarded againft the danger of  
oppreflion, as has been deviled and adopted by  
the articles of confederation, it wil! be a fub-  
je&amp; of regret, that fo much blood and treafure  
have be-n lavifhed for no purpofe; that fo  
many fufferings have been encountered with-  
out a compenfation, and that fo many facrifices  
have bees made in vain. Many other confi-  
derations might here bé adduce4, toprevs tha’,  
wifkout an entire conformity to the fpirit of  
the union, we cannot exift as am independent  
power. 1+ will be fuffi.ient for my purzofe te  
mention but one or two, which feem to me of  
the greateft importance. It is onl: in o2r  
umited cha:aéter, a3 an empire, that our inde-  
penden.c is cknowiedg:J, thatour power can  
  
7OL  
be regarded, or our credit fapported, among foe  
reign nations. The treaties of the European  
powers with the United States of America will  
have no valigity on a diffolution of the union,  
We fhall be left nearly in a flate of natures  
or we may find, by our own anhapoy experi.  
ence, that there is a natural progreffisn from  
the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of ty.  
ranny; and that arbitrary power is moft eafily  
eftablifhed on the ruins of liberty abufed to  
licentioufnefs.  
  
As to the fecond article, which re(pects the  
performance of public juttice, Congrefs have,  
in their late. Addrefs to the United States, al-  
moft exnaufted the fabje&amp;; they have explains  
ed their ideas fo fully, and have enforced the  
obligations the States are under to render come  
plete juftice to all the public creditors, with  
fo much cignity and energy, that, in my opi-  
nion, no real friend to the honour and inde  
pendency of America can heficate a fingle mo-  
ment refpecting the propriety of complying  
with the juit and honourable meafures propo-  
fed. If their arguments do not produce con-  
viction, 1 know of nothing that will have  
greaier influence, efpecially when we recolle&amp;  
that the fyftem referred to, being the refult of  
the collected wifdom of the Continent, muft be  
efteemed, if not perfeét, cercainly the leaft ob-  
jectionable of any that cou!d-be devifed; and  
that, if ic fhail not be carried into immediate  
execution, a national bankruptcy, will all its  
deplorable confequences, will take place before  
any different plan can poflibly be propofed or  
adopt+d; fo preffing are the prefent circum-  
ftanices, and fuch is the alternative now offered  
to the States.— (The Conclusion of this interche  
ing Letter foall be given in our next.)

be a more melancholy and diitrefling fight, than  
to behold thofe who have fhed their blood, of  
lott their limbs in the [ervice of their country,  
without a fhelter, without a friend, and without  
the means of obtaining any of the comforts or  
neceflaries of life, compelled to beg their daily  
bread trom door to door, Suffer me to recom-  
mend thofe of this defcription, belonging to your  
State, to the warmetft patronage of your Excel.  
lency and your legiflature.  
  
It is neceflary to fay but a few words on the  
third topic which was propofed, and which re-  
gards particularly the defeace of the Republic ;  
as there can be little doubt but Congrefs will  
recommend a proper peace citablifhment fot  
the United States, in which a due attention will  
be paid to the importance of placing the militia  
of the Union upon a regular and refpectable  
footing; if this thould be the cafe, I fhould beg  
leave to urge the great advantages of it in the  
itrongeft terms.  
  
The militia of this country muft be confidered  
as the palladium of our fecurity, and the firit  
effectual refort in cafe of hoftility: it is effen-  
tial, therefore, that the fame fyitem fhould  
pervade the whole; that the formation and dit-  
cipline of the militia of the Continent fhould be  
abfolutely uniform; and that the fame {pecies of  
arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus,  
fhould be introduced in every part of the United  
States. No one, who has not learned it from  
experience, can conceive the difficulty, expence,  
and confufion which refult from a contrary  
fyitem, or the vague arrangements which have  
hitherto prevailed.  
  
If, in treating of political points, a greater lat  
tude than ufual has been taken in thecourfe of this  
addrets, the importance of the crifis, and the mag-  
nitude of the objects in difcuffion, mult be my apo-  
logy : Itis, however, neither my with nor expecta-  
tion, that the preceding obfervations fhould claim  
any regard, except fo far as they thall appear to be  
dictated by a good intention; confonant to the  
immutable rules of juitice; catculated to produce  
a liberal fytezn of policy, and tounded on whate  
ever experience may have been acquired bya long  
and clofe attention to public bufinefs. Here  
‘might fpeak with more confidence, from my  
a‘tual obfervations; and if it would not fwell  
this letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds  
I had prefcribed myfelt, I could demonitrate to  
every mind open to conviction, that in lefs time,  
and with much lefs expence than has been in-  
curred, the war might have been brought to the  
fame happy conclufion, if the refources of the  
Continent could have been properly called forth ;  
that the dittrefles and dilegpelatments which  
have very often occurred, have, in too many  
inftances, refulted more from a want of 7  
in the Continental Government, than a  
ciency of means in the particular States: That

Head Quarters, Newburgh,  
June 18, 1783.  
  
SIR,  
IIE great obje&amp; for which I had  
the honour to hold an appointment  
in the fervice of my country, being ac-  
complifhed, I am now preparin, to refign  
it into the hands of Congrefs, and return  
to that domeftic ret&#x27;rement, which, it is weil  
known, I left with the greaieft reluétance ;  
a retirement for which I have never ceafed  
to figh through a long and painful ab-  
fence, in which (remote from the noife and  
trouble of the world) I meditate to pais  
the remainder of life in a ftate of undif-  
turbed repofe: but, before I carry this  
refolution into effeét, I think it a duty  
incumbent on me to make this my lat  
official comraunication, to congratulate  
you on the glorious events which Heaven  
has been pleafed to produce in our favour,  
to offer my fentiments reipeéting fome im-  
portant fubje&amp;ts, which appear to me to  
be intimately conneéted with the tranquil -  
lity of the United States, to take my leave  
of your Excellency as a public charaéter,  
and to give my final blefling to that coun-  
try in whofe lervice I have {pent the prime  
of my life; for whofe fake I have con-  
fumed fo many anxious days and watch-  
ful nights; and whofe happinefs, being  
extremely dear to me, will always coniti-  
tute no inconfiderable part of my own.  
Impreffed with the livelieft fenfibility on  
this pleafing occafion, I will claimthe in-  
dulgence of dilating the more copioufly on  
thefubjeé of ourmutual felicitation, When  
we confider the magnitude of the prize we  
  
contended for, the doubtful nature of the  
conteft, and the favourable manner in  
which it has terminated ; we fhal! find the  
greateft poffible reafon for gratitude and  
rejoicing : this is a theme that will afford  
infinite delight to every benevolent and  
liberal mind, whether the event in con-  
templation be confidered as the fource of  
— enjoyment, or the parent of future  
appinefs ; and we fhall have equal oc-  
cafion to felicitate ourfelves on the Jot  
which Providence has affigned us, whe-  
ther we view it ina natural, a political  
or moral point of light. :  
The citizens of America, placed in the  
moft enviable condition, as the fole lords  
and proprietors of a vail traét of Continent,  
comprehending all the various foils and  
climates of the world, and abounding with  
all the neceffaries and conveniencies of  
life, are now, by the late fatisfa&amp;tory paci-  
fication, acknowledged to be poffeffed of  
abfolute freedom, and independency ; the  
are from this period to be confidered xh  
the aétors on a molt confpicuous theatre  
which feems to be peculiar&#x27;y defignated by  
Providence for the difplay of humaa  
greatnefs and felicity: here they are not only  
furrounded with every thing that can contri-  
bute to the completion of private and/do-  
meftic enjoyment, but Heaven has crown-  
ed all its other bleflings by giving a furer  
opportunity for political happ‘nefs, than  
any other nation has ever been favoured  
with. Noth ng can illuftrate thefe obfer-  
vations more forcibly than a recolleétion  
of the happy conjunétures of times and  
circumftances, under which our Republic  
affumed its rank among the nations.—  
The foundation of our empire was not  
laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and  
fuperitition, but at an epocha when the  
rights of mankind were better underftood  
and more clearly defined, than at any for-

84 THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
mer period: refearches of the human  
mind after focial happinefé have been car-  
ried to a great extent: the treafures of  
knowledge acquired by the labours of  
Philofophers, Sages, and Legiflators, thro”  
a long fucceffion of years, are ‘aid open  
for ufe, and their collected wiflom may  
be happily applied in the eftablifiment of  
our forms of government: the free culti  
  
vation of letters, the unbounded extenfion  
of commerce, the progreffive refinement of  
manners, the growing liberality of fenti-  
ment, and, above a!], the pure and benign  
light of revelation, have had a meliorating  
influence on mankind, and encreafed the  
bleflings of fociety. At this aufpicious  
period she United States came into exift-  
ence as a nation, and if their citizens  
fhould not be completely free and happy,  
the fault will be entirely their own.  
  
Such is our fituation, and fuch are our  
ae mag ; but notwithftanding the cup of  
  
ing is thus reached out to us, not-  
withftanding happinefs is ours, if we have  
2 difpofition to feize the occafion, and make  
it our own ; yet it appears to me, there is  
an option fill lef to the United States of  
America, whether they will be refpeétable  
and profperous, or contemptible and mife-  
rable as a nations this is the time of their  
political probation ; this is the moment,  
when the eyes of the whole world are  
turned upon them; this is the moment,  
to eftablifh or ruin their national charaéter  
for ever; this is the favourable moment  
to give fuch a tone to the federal govern-  
ment, as will enable it to anfwer the ends  
of its inftivution; or this may be the ill-  
fated moment for relaxing the powers of  
the union, annihilating the cement of the  
confederation, and expofing us to become  
the fport of European politics, which may  
play one flate againft another, to prevent  
their growing importance, and to ferve their  
own interefted purpofes. For, according  
to the fyftem of policy, tue tates fhall  
adopt at this moment, they will ftand or  
fall ;—and, by their confirmation or re-  
japfe, it is yet to be decided, whether the  
revolution muft ultimately be confid-red  
as a bleffing or a curfe ;—a bleffing ora  
eurfe, not to the prefent age alone, for  
with our fate will the deftiny of unborn  
millions be involved.  
  
With this convigtion of the importance  
of the prefent crifis, filence in me would  
beacrime ; I will therefore {peak to your  
Excellency the language of freedom and  
fincerity, without difguife. I am aware,  
however, thofe who differ from me in poli-  
tical fentiments may perhaps remark, J  
  
am ftepping out of the proper line of m  
  
den; tak Oe may pofhibly aferibe &gt;  
arrogance or oftentation, what I know is  
alone the refult of the pureft intention ;  
but the re&amp;titude of my own heart, which  
difdains fuch unworthy motives ; the part  
I have hitherto acted in life, the deter-  
mination I have formed of not taking  
any fhare in public bufinefs hereafter ;  
the ardent defire I feel and fhall continue  
to manifeft, of quietly enjoying in prie  
vate life, after all the toils of war, the  
benefits of a wife and liberal government,  
will, I flatter myfelf, foover or later, con-  
vince my countrymen, that I could have  
no finitter views in delivering, with fo  
little referve, the opinions contained ig this  
Addre(s.  
  
There are four things which I humbly  
conceive are effential to the well-being, I  
may even venture to fay, to the exiitence  
of the United States as an Independent  
Power.  
  
1ft. An indiffoluble union of the States  
under one federal head,  
  
2dly. A facred regard to public juftice,  
  
3dly. The adoption of a praper Peace  
Eftablifhment. And,  
  
4thly. ‘The prevalence of that pacific  
and friendly ditpofition among the people  
of the United States, which will induce  
them to forget their local prejudices and  
politics, to make thofe mutual conceffions  
which are requifite to the general profpe-  
rity, and, in fome inftances, to facrifice  
their individua] advantages to the intereft  
of the community,  
  
Thefe are the pillars on which the glo-  
rious fabric of our independency and na-  
tional charaéter mutt be fupported.—Li-  
berty is the bafis—and whoever would  
dare to fap the foundation, or overturn  
the ftruéture, under whatever {pecious pre-  
texts he may attempt it, will merit the  
bittereft execration, and the fevereft pu-  
pifhment, which can be infli¢ted by his  
injured country.  
  
On the three firft articles I will make °  
  
a few obfervations, leaving the laft to the  
good fenfe and ferious confideration of thofe  
immediately concerned.

quently agitated, whether it be expedient

without referve, and to infift upon the fol-  
lowire pofitions.— That unicis the States  
will fuiles Congrefs to exercile thofe pre-  
rogatives they are undoubtedly invetted  
with by the Conftitution, every thing mutt  
very rapidly tend to anarchy and confution,  
That it is indifpenfabic to the happinels of  
the individual States, that there fhould be  
lodged, tomewhere, a fupreme power, to  
regulate and govern the general concerns  
of the confede:ated Republic, without  
which the union cannot be of long duration.  
  
That there mutt be a faithful and  
  
inted compliance on the part of every  
State with the late propofals and demands  
of Congres, or the moit fatal confequences  
will enfue.—&#x27;] hat whatever meafures have  
a tendency to diffolve the union, or con-  
tribute to violate or leflen the jovereign  
authority, ought to be confidered as hof-  
tile to the jiberty and independency of  
America, and the authors of them treated  
accordingly.— And laftly, that unlefs we  
can be enabled by the concurrence of the  
States to participate of the fruits of the  
Revolution, and enjoy the eflential benefits  
of civil fociety, under a form of govern-  
ment fo free and uncorrupted, fo happily  
guarded againtt the danger of oppretiion,  
as has been devifed and adopted by the  
articles of confederation, it will be a fub-  
ject of regret, that fo much blood and  
treafure have been lavifhed for no purpofe ;  
that fo many fufferings have been encoun-  
tered without a compenfation, and that  
fo many facrifices have been made in vain.  
Many other confiderations might here be  
adduced to prove, that without an entire  
conformity to the {pirit of the union, we  
cannot exiit as an Independent Power.  
It will be fufficient for my purpofe to  
mention but one or two, which feem to  
me of the greateft importance. It is only  
in our united charaéter, as an empire,  
that our Independence is acknowledged,  
that our power can be regarded, or our  
credit fupported among foreign nations.  
The Treaties of the European Powers,  
with the United States of America, will  
have rfo validity on a diflolution of the  
wnion. We fhall be left nearly in a ftate  
of Nature; or we may find by our own  
unhappy experience, that there is a natu-  
ral and neceflary progreffion from the ex-  
treme of anarchy to the extreme of ty-  
ranny ; and that arbitrary power is moit  
eafily eftablifhed on the ruins ‘of liberty  
abvied to licentioufnels.  
  
As to the fecond article, which refpeéts  
the performance of public juftice, Congreis  
  
have, in ihgis hate Addref$ to the Ynited  
  
FOR AUGUST, 1783. 85  
  
States, almoft exhautted the fubject ; they  
have explained their ideas fo fully, and  
have enforced the obligations the States  
are under to render complete juftice to all  
the public creditors, with fo much dig-  
nity and energy, that, in my opinion, ne  
real friend to the honour and indepen-  
dency of America can hefitate a fingle  
moment re{pecting the propriety of com-  
plying with the juft and honourable mea-  
fures propofed ; if their arguments do not  
produce conviétion, { know of nothing  
tha: wall have greater influence, efpecially  
when we recolleé that the fyftem referred  
to, being the refult of the colleéted wif-  
dom of the Continent, mutt be efteemed,  
if not peifeét, certainly the leait objeétion-  
able of any that could be devifed; and  
that, if it fhall not be carried into imme-  
diate execution, a national bankruptcy, with  
all its deplorable confequences, will take  
place before any different plan can poffibly  
be propofed or adopted ; fo prefling are  
the prefent circumttances, and {uch is the  
alternative now offered to the States.  
  
The ability of the country to difcharge  
the debts, which have been incurred in its  
defence, is not to be doubted. An incli-  
nation, I flatier myfelf. will not be want-  
ing ; the path of our duty is plain before  
us; nd will be found, in every ex-  
periment, to be the beit and only true  
policy. Let us then, as a nation, be juft;  
let us fulfil the public contiaéts which  
Congrefs had undoubtedly a right to make  
for the purpofe of carrying on the war,  
with the fame good faith, we fuppofe our-  
felves bound to perform our private en-  
gagements. In the mean time let an at-  
tention to the cheerful performance of their  
proper bufinefs, as individuals, and as  
Members of fociety, be earneftly incul-  
cated on the Citizens of America ; then  
will they ftrengthen the hands of Govern-  
ment, and be happy under its proteétion.  
Every one wil] reap the fruit of his labours ;  
every one will enjoy his own acquifitions,  
without moleftation and without danger,  
  
In this ftate of abfolute freedom and  
perfe&amp;t fecurity, who will grudge to yield  
a very little of his property, to fupport the  
common interetts of fociety, and enfure the  
protetion of Government ? Who does not  
remember the frequent declarations at the  
commencement of the war, That we  
fhould be completely fatisfied, if, at the  
expenfe of one half, we could defend the  
remainder of our poffeflions? Where is  
the man to be found, who wifhes to re.

perfon and property to the exertions, the

brayery and the blocd of others, without  
making one generous effurt to repay the  
debt of honour and of gratitude ? In what  
part of the Continent fhall we find any  
man, or body of men, who would not  
blufh to ftand up, and propofe mealures  
  
urpofely calculated to rob the foldier of  
his ftipend, and the public creditor of his  
due? And were it ‘poffible that fuch a  
flagrant inftance of injuftice could ever  
happen, would it not excite the general  
indignation, and tend to bring down, upon  
the authors of fuch meafures, the aggra-  
vated vengeance of Heaven? If after all, a  
fpirit of difunion, or a temper of. obftinacy  
and perverfenefs, fhou!d attempt to fruftrate  
all the happy effects that might be expeét-  
ed-to flow from the union ; if there fhould  
bea refufal to comply with requifitions for  
funds to difcharge the annual intcreft of  
the public debts, and if that refufal thould  
revive all thofe jealoufies, and produce all  
thofe evils which are now happily removed:  
Congrefs, who have in all their tranfaétions  
fhewn a great degree of magnanimity and  
juttice, will ftand jultified in the fight of  
God and Man! And that State alone,  
which puts itlelf in oppofition to the «g-  
gregate wifdom of the Continen&#x27;, and  
follows fuch miltaken and_ pernicious  
Councils, will be refponfible for all the  
confequences.  
  
For my own part, confcious of having  
aéted, while a fervant of the public, in the  
manner I conceived heft fuited to promote  
the real interefts of my country; having,  
in confequence of my fixed belief, in fome  
meafure, pledged myfelf to the Army,  
that their country would finally do them  
complete and ample juftice, and not with-  
ing to conceal any initance of my official  
condu&amp; from the eyes of the wo: ld, I have  
thought proper to tranimit to your Excel-  
lency the inclofed colleétion of papers, re-  
Jative to the half pay and commutation  
granted by Congrefs to the Officers of the  
Aimy; from thefe.communications my  
decided fentiments will be clearly compre-  
hended, together with the conclufive reafons  
which induced me, at an early period, to  
recommend the adoption of this meafure in  
the moft earneft and ferious manner. As  
the proceedings of Congrefs, the Army,  
and myfelf, are open to all, und contain,  
in my opinion, fufficient information to  
remove the prejudice and eriors which may  
have been entertained by any, I think it  
unneceflary to fay any thing more, than  
jut to obferve, that the, refolutions of  
Congrefs now alluded to, are as unavoi-  
  
dably and abfolutely binding upon the  
  
¢  
  
United States, as the moft folemn a&amp;ts of  
confederation or legiflation.  
  
As to the idea, which I am informed  
has in fome inftances prevailed, that the  
half-pay and commutation are to be re-  
garded merely in the odious light ef a  
penfion, it ought to be exploded for ever:  
that provilion fhould be viewed, as it  
really was, a reafonable compenfation affer-  
ed by Congyefs, at a time when they had  
nothing elle to give to Officers of the  
Army for fervices then to be performed 5  
it was the only means to prevent a total  
dereliction of the fervice; it was a part of  
their hire; I may be allowed to fay, it was  
the price of their blood, and of your in-  
dependency; it is therefore more than a  
common debt, it is a debt of honour; it  
can never be contidered as a penfion or  
gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly  
difcharged.  
  
With regard to the diftin&amp;tion between  
Officers and foldiers, it is fufficient that  
the uniform experience of every nation of  
the world, combined with our own, proves  
the utility and propriety of the difcrimina-  
tion. Rewards in proportion to the aids  
the public draws from them, are unquef-  
tionably due to all its fervants. In fome  
lines, the foldiers have perhaps generally  
had as ample compenfation for their fer-  
vices, by the large bounties which have  
been paid them, as their Officers will re-  
ceive in the propofed commutation; in  
other, if befides the donation of land, the  
  
ayment of arrearages of clothing and  
wages (in which articles all the component  
parts of the army mutt be put upon the  
fame footing) we take into the eftimate the  
bounties many of the foldiers have received,  
and the gratuity of one year’s full pay,  
which is promifed to all, poffibly their  
fituation (every circumftance being duly  
coniidered) will not be deemed lefs eligible  
than that of the Officers. Should a furs  
ther reward, however, be judged equitable,  
I will venture to affert, no man will enjoy  
greater fatisfa€tion than myfelf in an  
exemption from taxes for a limited time  
(which has been petitioned for in fome  
inftances), or any other adequate immu-  
nity or compenfation granted to the brave  
detenders of their country’s caufe; but  
neither the adoption or rejection of this  
propofition will in any manner afle&amp;, much  
lefs militate againft, the aét of Congrefs,  
by which they have offered five years full-  
pay, in lieu of the half-pay for life, which  
had been before promifed to the Officers of  
the Army.

juftice, I cannot omit to mention the ob-  
ligations this country is under to that me-  
ritcrious clafs of veterans, the non com-  
miffioned Officers and privates, who have  
been difcharged for inability, in confe-  
quence of the refolution of Congrefs, of  
the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual  
penfion for life; their peculiar fufferings,  
their fingular merits and claims to that  
provifion need only to be known, to in-  
tere(t the feelings of hwmanity in their be-  
half: nothing but a punétual payment of  
their annua! allowance can yefcue them  
from the mott complicated milery ; and  
nothing could be a more melancholy and  
diftrefling fight, than to behold thofe who  
have fhed their blood, or loft their limbs  
in the fervice of their country, without a  
fhelter, without a friend, and without the  
means of obtaining any of the comforts or  
weceflaries of life, compelled to beg their  
daily bread from door to door. Sutter me  
to recommend thofe of this defcription, be-  
longing to your State, to the warmeft pa-  
tronage of your Excellency and your Le-  
giflature.  
  
It is neceffary to fay but a few words  
on the third topie which was propoled, and  
which regards particularly the defence of  
the Republic. As there can be little doubt  
but Congrefs will recommend a proper  
peace eftablifhment for the United States,  
m which a due attention will be paid to  
the importance of placing the Militia of  
the Union upon a regular and refpectable  
footing ; if this fhould be the cafe, I fhould  
beg leave to urge the great advantage of it  
in the ftrongett terms.  
  
The Muitia of this country mutt be  
confidered as the palladium of our fecurity,  
and the firtt effe€tual refort in cafe of hof-  
tility: It is eflential, therefore, that the  
fame fyftem fhould pervade the whole ;  
that the formaton and difcipline of the  
Militia of the Continent, fhould be abfo-  
lutely uniform ; and that tne fame fpecies  
of arms, accoutrements, and military ap-  
paratus, fhould be introduced in every part  
of the United States. No one, who has  
not learned it from experience, can con-  
ceive the difficulty, expenfe, and confufion  
which refult from a contrary fyftem, or  
the vague arrangements which have hitherto  
prevailed.  
  
If, in treating of political points, a  
greater latitude than ufual has been taken  
in the courfe of the addrefs, the impor-  
tance of the crifis, and the magnitude of  
the objects in difcuffion, muft be my apo-  
logy: It is, however, neither my with  
ner expestation, that the preceding obicr-  
  
FOR AUGUST, 1783.  
  
vations fhould claim any regard, except fe  
far as they fhould appear to be diétated by  
a good intention: confonant to the immu-  
table rules of juftice; calculated to pro-  
duce a liberal /yltem of policy, and found.  
ed on whatever experience may have been  
acquired by a long and clofe attention to  
public bufinefs. Here I might {peak with  
more confidence, from my actual obferva-  
tions ; and if it would not {well this letter  
(+lready too prolix) beyond the bounds I  
had preferibed mylelf, I could demonftrate  
to every mind, open to conv tion, that in  
lefs time, and with much lefs expenfe than  
has been incurred, the war might have been  
brought to the fame happy conclufion, if  
the refources of the Continent could have  
been properiy called forth: That the dif-  
trefles and difappointments’ which have  
very often occurred, have, in too many  
inftances, refulted more from a want of  
energy in the Continental Government,  
than a deficiency of means in the particu-  
lar States : That the inefficacy of meafures,  
arifing from the want of an adequate au-  
thority in the fupreme power, from a par-  
tial compliance with the requifitions of  
Congrefs in fome of the States, and from  
a failure of punctuality in others, while  
they tended to damp the zeal of thofe who  
were more willing to exert themfelves,  
ferved alf2 to accumulate the expenfes of  
the war, and to fruftrate the beit concerted  
plans; and that the difcouragement oc-  
cafioned by the complicated difficulties and  
embarraflments, in which our affairs were  
by this means involved, would have long  
  
° ° _ a  
ago produced the diffolution of any Army,  
lefs patient, lefs virtuous and lefs perfeve-  
ring, than that which I have had the ho-  
nour to command.—But while I mention  
thofe things, which are notorious” fa&amp;ts,  
as the defe&amp;ts of our foederal conititution,  
particulary in the profecution of a war, I  
beg it may be underftood, that as I have  
ever taken a pleafure in gratefully acknow-  
ledging the affiftance and fupport I have  
derived from every clafs of citizens, fo fhall  
I always be happy to do juftice to the un-  
paralleled exertions of the individual States,  
on many interefting occations.  
  
I have thus freely difclofed what I  
wifhed to mske known before I furrender-  
ed up may public truit to thofe who com-  
mitted it to me: The tafk is now accom-  
plithed ; I now bid adieu to your Excel-  
lency, as the Chief Magittrate of your  
State; at the fame time I bid a laft fare.  
well to the cares of office, and all the em-  
ployments of public life.  
  
It remains then, to be my final and only

nxious days and watchful nights; and  
  
hole happinefs, being extremely dear to  
  
2, will always conftitute no inconfider-  
  
of my own. :  
  
“Teaeft-d with the livelieft fenfibility on  
his pleafing occafion, I witl claim the in-  
dulgence of dilating the more a on  
  
¢ fubjest of our mutual felicitatien,  
  
When we confider the magnitude of the  
vrize we contended for, the doubtful na-  
  
re of the conteft, and the favourable  
manner in which it has terminated ; we  
hall find the greateft poffible reafon for  
patitude and rejoicing: This is a theme  
that will afford infinite delight to every  
enevolent and liberal mind, whether the  
  
vent in contemplation be confidered as  
i fource of prefent enjoyment, or the  
pent of future happinefs ; and we fhall  
have equal occaficn to felicitate ourfelves  
in the lot which Providence has afligned  
us, whether we view it in a natural, a po-  
litical, or moral point of light. :  
  
The citizens of America, placed in the  
mot enviable condition, as the fole lords  
and proprietors of a vatt traét of continent,  
comprehending all the various foils and  
cimates of the world, and abounding  
with all the neceflaries and conveniences of  
life, are now, by the late fatisfaétory pa  
tification, acknowledged to be poffefled of  
abfolute freedom, and independency ; they  
at from this period to be confidered as the  
afors on a moft confpicuous theatre, which  
feems to be peculiarly defigned by Pro-  
vidence for the difplay of human great-  
nels and felicity: Here they are not only  
furounded with every thing that can con-  
tribute to the completion of private and  
domeftic enjoyment, but heaven has  
crowned all its other bleffings, by giving  
afurer opportunity for political happinefs,  
than any other nation has ever been fa-  
voured with, Nothing can illuftrate thefe  
obfervations more forcibly than a recol-  
ktéion of the happy conjunéture of times  
and ciicumftances, under which our Re-  
public aflumed its rank among the nations.  
~The foundation of our Empire was not  
id in a gloomy age of ignorance and  
fuperttition, but at an epocha when the  
nghts of mankind were better underftood  
and more clearly defined, than at any  
  
tmer period: Refearches of the human  
mind after focial happinefs have been car-  
ied to a great extent; The treafures of  
  
4if  
knowledge acquired by the labours of phi«  
lofophers, fages and legiflators, through  
a long fucceflion of years, are laid open  
for ufe, and their colleéted wifdom may  
be happily applied in the eftablifhment of  
our forms of government: The free cul-  
tivation of letters, the unbounded extenfion  
of commerce, the progreffive refinement of  
manners, the growing liberality of fenti-  
ment, and, above all, the pure and  
benign light of Revelation, have had a  
meliorating influence on mankind, and  
encreafed the bleflings of fociery. At this  
aufpicious period the United States came  
into exiftence as a nation, and if their ci-  
tizens fhould not be completely tree and  
happy, the fault will be entirely their  
own.  
  
Such is our fituation, and fuch are our  
profpeéts ; but notwithftanding the cup of  
blefling is thus reached out to us, note  
withftanding happinefs is ours, if we have  
a difpofition to feize the occafion, and  
make it our own; yet it appears to me,  
there is an option {till left to the United  
Staces of America, whether they will be  
refpeétable and profperous, or contemptible  
and miferable as a nation ; this is the time  
of their political probation; this is the  
momeut, when the eyes of the whole  
world are turned upon them; this is the  
moment, to eftablifh or ruin their national  
charaéter for. ever; this is rhe favourable  
moment to give fuch a tone to the foederal  
government, as will enable it to anfwer  
the ends of its inftitution ; or this may be  
the ill-fated moment for relaxing the  
powers of the union, annihilating the ce-  
ment of the confederation, and expofing  
us to become the {port of European po-  
litics, which may play one ftate againft  
  
another, to prevent their growing im-  
  
portance, and to ferve their own interefted  
purpofes, For, according to the fyftem  
of policy, the States fhall adapt at this  
moment, they will ftand or fall:—and, by  
their confirmation or lapfe, it is yet to be  
decided, whether ihe Revolution muft ul-  
timately be confidered as a biefling or a  
curfe ;—a blefling or a curfe, not to the  
prefent age alone, for with our fate will  
the deftiny of unborn millions be in-  
volved.  
  
With this conviction of the importance  
of the prefent crifis, filence in me would  
be a crime; I will therefore fpeak to your  
Excellency the language of freedom and  
fincerity, without difguife. I um arware,  
however, thofe who differ from me im poe  
litical fentiments, may, perhaps, remark,  
L am ftepping eut of the proper line of my  
  
aF 2 duty 5  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
412 Wathington’s  
duty ; and they may poflibly afcribe to  
arrogance or oftentation, what I know is  
alone the refult of the purett intention ;  
but the restitude of my own heart, which  
difdains fuch unworthy motives ; the part  
I have hitherto aéted in life, the determi-  
nation I have formed of not taking any  
fhare in public bufinefs hereafter; the  
ardent defire I feel and fhall continue to  
manifeft, of quietly enjoying in privaje  
life, after all the to:ls of war, the benefits  
of a wife and liberal government, will, I  
flatter myfelf, fooner or later, convince  
my countrymen, that I could have no  
finifter views in delivering, with fo little  
referve, the opinions contained in this  
addrefs.  
  
There are four things which I humbly  
conceive are eflential to the well being, I  
may even venture to fay, to the exilience  
of the United States, as an independent  
‘power.  
  
ift, An indiffoluble union of the States  
under one foederal head.  
  
adly. A facred regard to public juftice.  
  
gdly. The adoption of a proper peace  
eftablifhment. And,  
  
4thly. The prevalence of that pacific  
and friendly difpofition among the people  
of the United States, which will mduce  
them to forget their local prejudices and  
  
policies, to make thofe mutual conceflions  
which are requifite to the general pro-  
fperity, and, in fome inttances, to facrifice  
their individual advantages to the intereit  
of the community,  
  
Thefe are the pillars on which the glo-  
rious fabric of our independency and na-  
tional charaéter muft be fupported.—Li-  
berty is the bafis—and whoever would  
dare to fap the foundation, or overturn  
the ftru&amp;ture, under whatever fpecious pre-  
texts he may attempt it, will merit the  
bittereft execration, and the fevereft pu-  
nifhment, which can be inflicted by his  
injured country.  
  
On the three firft articles I will make a  
few obfervations, leaving the laft to the  
good fenfe and ferious confideration of  
thofe immcdiately concerned.  
  
Under the firft head, although it may  
  
-not be néceffary or proper for me in this  
place to enter into a particular difquifition  
of the principles of the union, and to take  
up the great queftion which has been fre-  
quently agitated, whether it be expedient  
and requifite for the States to delegate a  
large proportion of power to Congrefs, or  
not; yet it will be a part of my duty; and  
that of every true patriot, to affert, with-  
out referye, and to infift upon the follow-  
  
Circular’ Better.  
  
ing pofitions.—That unlefs the §  
fulfer Congrefs to exercife thofe a  
tives they are undoubtedly invelted wit  
by the conftitution, every thing mut  
  
ra idly tend to anarchy and confufor  
That it is indifpenfible to the happinefs ¢  
the individual States, that there thould be  
lodged, fomewhere, a fupreme power, t  
regulate and govern the general concern  
of the confederated Republic, without  
which the union cannot be of long d  
ration.  
  
That there muft be a faithful and  
poiuted compliance on the part of ey  
State with the late propofals and demand  
of Congrefs, or the molt fatal cong  
quences will enfue.—That whatever m  
fures have a tendency to diffulve the union  
or contribute to violate or leffin the fove  
reign authority, ought to be confidered  
hottile to the liberty and independency of  
America, and the authors of them treated  
accordingly.—And laftly, that unlefs we  
can be enabled by the concurrence of th  
States to participate of the fruits of th  
revolution, and e:.joy the effential benefits  
of civil fociety, under a form of goven-  
ment fo free and uncorrupted, fo happil  
guarded againft the danger of oppreifion  
as has been devifed and adopted by the  
articles of confederation, it will be  
fubject of regret, that fo much blood and  
treafure have been lavifhed for no purpole;  
that fo many fufferings have been encoun  
tered without a compenfation, and that {o  
many facrifices have been made in vai  
Many other confiderations might here be  
adduced to prove, that without an entire  
conformity to the fpirit of the union, we  
cannot exift as an independent power. It  
will be fufficient for my purpole to men-  
tion but one or two, which fe-m to me off  
the greateft importance. It is only in ou  
united character, as an empire, that ou  
independence is acknowledged, that o  
power can be regarded, or our credit fa  
ported among foreign nations. The trea  
ties of the European powers, with th  
United States of America,’ will have no  
validity on the diffolution of the union.  
We hall be left nearly in a ftate of  
nature; or we may find by our own un  
happy experience, that there is a natural  
and neceflary progreffion from the extreme  
of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny ; and  
that arbitrary power is moft eafily eft  
biithed on the ruins of liberty abufed to  
licentioufnefs.  
  
As to the fecond article, which refpels  
the performance of public jultice, Con- i  
grefs have, in their Mate addres fe

sited State’ alinoft exhaufted the fub-  
  
; they have explained ther ideas fo  
ily, and have enforced the obligations  
he States are under to render complete  
hitice to all the pablic creditors, with fo  
much dignity and energy, that in my opi  
rica, no real friend to the honeur and  
hndependency of America can hefitate a  
fingle moment refpetting the propriety of  
omplying with the juft and honourable  
pedures propofed; if their arguments  
dz not produce convi€tion, I know of  
pothing that will have greater influence,  
efpecially when we refle&amp;t that the fyi-  
tem referred to, being the relult of the  
colieQted wifdom of the continent, mult  
teefleemed, if not perfe&amp;, certainly the  
Jat objectionable of any that could be  
devifed ; and that, if it Mall not be car-  
ried into immediate execution, a naticnal  
bankruptcy, with all its deplorable con-  
fequeaces, will take place before any dif-  
ferent plan can poffibly be propoled or  
adopted ; fo preffing are the prefent cir-  
cumftances, and fuch is the alternative  
now offered to the Statcs.  
  
The ability of the country to diftharge  
the debts, which have been incurred in its  
defence, is not to be doubted. An in-  
dination, I flatter myfelf, will not be  
wanting; the path of our duty is plain  
before us; honetly will be found, on  
every experiment, to be the beft and oniy  
true policy. Let us then, as a nation,  
be juit; let us fulfil the public contracts  
which Congrefs had undoubtedly a ri. ht  
to make for the pus pole of carrying on the  
war, with the fame good fuith, we fup-  
po ourfelves bound to perform our pri-  
vate engagements. In the mean time let  
anattention to the chearful performance  
of their proper bufinefs, as individuals,  
and as members of fociety, be earnettly  
inculeated on the citizens of America ;  
then will they trengthen the bands of go-  
verament, and be happy under its pro-  
tetion. Every one will reap the fiuit  
ot his labours; every one will enjoy his  
own acquifitions, without moleftation and  
without danger. : :  
  
In this ttate of abfolute freedem and  
peifett fecurity, who will grudge to yield  
avery little of his property to fupport  
the coninon interefts of fociety, and en-  
fure the proteétion of government ? Who  
does not remember the frequent declara-  
tions at the commencement of the war,  
That we fhould be completely fatisfied,  
  
Wat the expence of one half, we could’  
  
defend the remainder of our poffeffions ?

Where is the man to he found, whe  
wifhes to remain indcited for the defence  
of his own pe:fon and property te the  
exertions, the bravery, and the blood of  
others, without maiimg one cencrons ef-

of men, who would not b&#x27;uth to Land Ups

hat provifion fhould be viewed, as it  
really was, a reafonable compenfation of-  
fered by Congreis, at a tine when they  
had nothing elie to give to officers of the  
army, for fervices then to be performed :  
It was the only means to prevent a total  
dereli€tion of the fervice: It was a part  
of their hire, 1 may be allowed to fay,  
it was the price of their blood, and of  
your independency ;_ it is therefore more  
than a common debt, it is a debt of  
honour; it can never be confidered asa  
penfion or gratuity, nor cancelled until it  
as fairly difcharged. -  
  
With regard to the diftin&amp;ion between  
officers and foldiers, it is fufficient that  
the uniform experience of every nation of  
  
the world, combined with our own, proves,  
  
the utility and propriety of the difcrimi-  
nation. Rewards in propcrtion to the  
aids the public draws from them, are un-  
quettionably due to all its fervants. In  
dome limes, the foldiers have perhaps ge-  
nervally had as ample compenfation for  
their fervices, by the large bounties which  
have bven paid them, as their officers will  
receive in the propoled commutation ;  
in others, if befides the donation of land,  
the payment of arrearages of clothing  
and wages (in which articles al] the com-  
ponent parts of the army muft be put  
upon the fame footing) we take into the  
eitimate,, the Lounties many of the ful-  
diers have received, and the gratuity of  
one year’s full pay, which is promifed to  
all, poffibly their fituation (every circum-  
ftance being duly confidered) will not be  
deemed lefs eligible than that of the officers,  
Should a further reward, however, be  
judged equitable, I wit] venture to af-  
fert, no man will enjoy greater fatistaQion  
than myfelf, an exemption from taxes for  
a limited time (which has been petitioned  
for in fome inftances) or any other ade-  
quate immunity or compenfation granted

been difcharged for inability, in conf.  
quence of the refolution of Congres, of  
the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual  
pention for life: their peculiar fofferin  
their fingular merits and claims to a  
provifion need only to be known, to in.  
tereft the feelings of humanity in ther  
behalf: nothing but a punétual payment  
of their annual allowance can refcue them  
from the ‘moft complicated miffery ; and  
nothing could be a more melancholy and  
difttefing fight, than to behold thofe who  
have thed their blood, or loft their limbs  
in the fervice of their country, withouta  
fhelter, without a friend, and without the  
means of obtaining any of the comforts or  
neceffaries of life, compelled to beg their  
daily bread from door to door, Suffer  
me to recommend thofe of this deferip-  
tion, belonging to your State, to the  
warmeft patronage of your Excellency  
and your Legiflature.  
  
It is neceflary to fay but a few words  
on the third topic which was propofed,  
and which regards particularly the defence  
¥ the Republic, As there can be little  
  
abt but Congrefs will recommend a  
proper peace eftablifhment for the United  
States, in which a due attention will be  
paid to the importance of placing the mi-  
litia of the Union upon a regular and re-  
fpeétable footing ; if this fhould be the  
cafe, I fhould beg leave to urge the great  
advantage of it in the ftrongelt terms.  
  
‘The militia of this country mut be  
confidered as the palladium of our fecu-  
rity, and the firft effectual refort in cafe  
of hoftility: It is effential, therelore,  
that the fame fyftem fhould pervade the

of the militia of the Continent fhould be  
abfolutely uniform ; and that the fame  
fpecies of arms, accoutrements, and milie  
tary apparatus, fhould be introduced in  
every part of the United States. No one,  
who has not learned it fron: experience,  
can conceive the difficulty, expence, an

Head-Qyarters, Newburgh, June 18, 1783.  
STR, . iets  
4 f SHE preat ebjeQfor. which -T had the hongar to held an  
appointment in the fervice of my country; being accom.  
plithed, I anr now preparing to refign it into the hands of Con-  
grefs, and return yo, that domeitic retirement, which, it 1s  
well known, TI Jefe with the greateft reluctance ; a retirement  
for which I have. never ceafed to figh through a long and pain-  
ful abfence, in which (iemote from the noife and trouble of the  
world) EF mediate ro pafg the remainder of life, in a {hate  
of undiftarbed repofe, But, before I carry. this refolution inte  
effe&amp;t, I think ita dary incumbent on me to make this my lait  
official communication,’ to congratulate you oa the glorious ¢-  
vents which Heaven has been pleafed to produce in our favour,  
10 offer my fentiments refpecting fome important tubjects, which  
appear to me tobe intimately connected with the tranquillity of  
the United States, to take my leave of your Excellency as a  
public character, and to give my final blefling to that country,  
in whofe fervice I have {pent the prime of my life; for whofe  
fake I ave confamed fo many anxjous days and watchful  
nights, and, whofe happinefs, being extremely dear to me, will  
always conftitute no eonfiderable part of my own.  
  
Impreffed with the fivelieft fenfibility on this pleafing occa-  
fion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the more copioufly  
on the fubjeSt’ of our niutual felicitation, When we confider  
the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubrful na-  
ture of the contefl, and the favourable manner in which it has  
terminated, we fhall find the. greatelt poflible reafon for grati-  
rade and rejoicing + .tbis is a theme that will afford infinite de-  
light to every*benevolent and fiberal mind, whether the event  
in contemplation be conlidered as the. fource of prefent enjoy-  
ment, or the parent of furmre happinefs ; and we fall have e-  
qual occafian to felicitate-ourfelves on the lot which Providence  
has affigned us, whether we view it jn a natural, a political, or  
a moral point of light. : ey  
  
The Cyrizens of Amerita, placed. in the molt enyiable con-  
dition, ag the fole Lords and proprietors ofa vatt tract of con-  
tinent, ing all the warions foils and climares of the  
world, and abounding with allthe neceffaries and convenicn-  
cies of life, are now, by the late fatisfactory pacification, ac-  
knowledged to be poffefled of abfolure’ freedom and indepen-  
dente ; they are from this period t6 be confidered as the actors  
ov a moft confpicnows theatre, which feems to be peculiarly  
defigned by Providence for the difplay of human greatnefs and  
felicity : Here they are not only farréunded with every thing  
that can contribute to the conypletion.of private and ‘domeitic  
enjoyment, but Heaven a Geseed - te bgt ble flings a  
  
iving a furer opportunity for political happinefs, than any other  
rn. ever-been faveared act Nothing can iluftrate thefe  
  
obfervations more forcibly than a recollection of the happy&#x27;con-  
  
jun@ure of times and circumftances, under-which our Repu-  
Tie affamcd its rank emong the nations. —The foundation of  
our Empire was vot laid in the gloomy age of igaorance and  
fuperftition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were  
better underftood, and more clearly defined, than at any former ~  
period :-Refearches of the human mind after focial happinefs  
have been carried to a great extent ; the treafures of knowledge  
acquired by the labours of philofophers, fages and legiffators,  
through a long faccefion of years, are laid open for afe, and  
their collegted wifdom may be-happily ‘applied in the eftablith- ©  
ment of our forms of Government : The freg cultivation of let-  
ters, the unbounded extenfion of commerce, the progreflive re-  
finement.of manners, the growing: liberality of fentiment, and,  
above all, the purer and benign light of Revelation, have had  
a meliorating influence oa mankind, and increafed the bleflings  
of fociety. _ At this qufpicious period, the United States came  
into exiltence as. a Wation, and if their.citizens fhould. not. be  
completely free-and happy, the fault wilt be entirely their own.  
Such is our fituation,: and-fach arg. our. profpects ; but not-  
withftanding the cup of bleffing is thus reached gut to us, not-  
withftanding happinefs is ours, if we have a difpofition to feize  
the occafion, and make ‘it our own, yet it appears to me, there  
is an option {till Jeft ‘to the Uniréd States of America, whether  
the vil be refpectable and profperous, or contemptible and mi-  
ferable as a nation ; this is the time of their political probation ;”  
this is the. moment, when the eyes of the whole world are  
turned upon them ; this is the moment: to eftablith or ruin  
their national character for ever; this js the favourable mo-  
meit to give fuch a tone to the. foederal Government, as will  
enable it to anfwer the ends of its inftitution ; or this may be  
the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the univn, an-  
nihilating the cement of the confederation, and expofing us to  
become the fport of European politics, which may play one  
State again{t another, to prevent their. growing importance, and  
to ferve their owh interefted_purpofes. For, according to the  
fyftem of policy the Stares fhalt adopt at-this moment, they will  
fiand or fall ;—and, by their confirmation or lapfe, it is yet to  
be decided, whether the revolution muft ultimately be confi-  
dered: as a blefling or a curfe ;-—a bleffing.or a curfe not to the  
prefent age alone, for with our fate will the deftiny of unborn  
millions be involved. : = ae  
With this conviétton of the irhportance of the prefent crifis,  
filence in me would be acrime; I will, therefore, fpeak to  
your Excellency the language of freedom and of fincerity, with-  
out difguife. I am aware, however, thofe who differ from me  
in political fentiments may, perhaps, remark, I am {tepping out  
of the proper line of my dary ; and they may. poflibly afcribe to  
arrogance or oftentation, what I know 1s alone the refult of the  
pureit intention: but the. rectitude of my own heart, which  
difdains fach unworthy motives ; the part I have hitherto acted  
m lifes; the determipation I have formed of not.takiog any fhare  
in public bofinefs hereafter 5 the ardent defite I fecl, and thall  
continue to manifeit, of quietly enjoying in private life, after  
all the toils of war, the benefits of a wifé and liberal Govern-  
ment, will, I flatter myfel¥, fooner or later, convince my ‘coun-  
trymen, that I could have no finifter views in delivering with  
fo little referve, the opinicns contained in this addrefs.  
  
There are four things which I hambly coaceive are cffential  
ro the well-being, I may even venture to fay, to the exiftence  
of the United States as an independent power.

On the three firft articles 1 will make.a few obfrvations 5  
leaving the laft to the good fenfe, and fetious contideration of-  
thofe immediately concerned.  
  
Under the fir heal, although it may not be neceffary or  
proper for me ia this place to enter into a particular difquifirion  
of the principlés’of the union, and to take up the great queltion  
which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and  
requifite for tie Stares to delegarg a larger proportiun of power  
to Congrefs, or fot; yer it will&#x27;bea part of my duty, and that of  
every trye patriot, 10 effurt without referve, and to infilt upon  
the following. pofitions :—That unlefs the States will fuifer  
Congrefs to éxercife thofe prerogatives they are undoubtedly  
  
tend to anarchy and confuflon+#Phat it is indifpenfible to the  
happinefs of the individwal Sates, that there fhould be  
Jodged fomewhere, a fupreme power to regulate and go-  
vern the general concerns of the confederated Republic,  
without which the union cagnor -be of long duration. ~That  
there malt be a, faithfal’ and pointed compliance on the pait  
of every State with the Jate:propofals and demands of Con.  
grefs, or the molt fatal confequences will enfue:-—T hat. what-  
ever meafures have a tendency to diffulve the union, or contri-  
bate to violate or leffen.the fovereign authority, ought to be  
confidered as holtile to the Jiberty and independency of Ame-  
rica, and the aathors of them treated accordingly. —A nd lait-  
ly, that unlefs we-can be, enabléd by the concurrence of the  
States tu participate: of the fruits of the revolution, and enjoy  
the effential benefits of civil fegicty;.under a form of govern-  
ment fo free and uncorrupted, happily. guarded againft the  
danger of oppreffion, as Pai devifed and adopted by the  
articles of confederation, it wi bea fubje&amp; of regret, that fo  
much blood and. 4reafure:-haye..been lavished for no purpofe,  
that fo many fufferings have. been-encountered without a com-  
ptnfation, and that fo many facrifices have been made ia yain,  
Many other conliderations .might here be adduced to prove,  
that without an entire conformity. to the fpirit of the union, we  
cannot exift as an-independent power. It will be fufficient for  
my purpofe to mention byt one or two, which feem to me of  
the greateft importance. It is only in our united character, as  
an empire, that our independence is acknowledged, that our  
power can be regarded, or our credit fupported among foreign  
nations. ‘The, treaties of the European powers, with the Uni-  
ted States of America, will: have-ne validity on a diflolution of  
the union. We thall be left nearly in a ftate of nature, or we  
may find by our own unhappy experience, rhat there is a na-  
tural and neceflary progreffion from the extreme of anarchy to  
the extreme of tyranny 5. and thaf arbitrary power is moft eafj-  
ly eftablifhed on the ruins of liberty. abufed to licentioufnefs.  
  
As to the fecond article, which: refpeéts the,performance of  
public juftice, Congrefs have, in their late addrefs to.the Uni-  
ted States, almoft exhaufted the fubjec&amp;t ; they. have explained  
their ideas fo fully, and have enforced the obligations the States  
are under to render complete juftice to all the public creditors,  
with fo much dignity and energy, that, in my opinion, no real  
friend to the honour and independency. of America can hefi-  
tate a fingle moment refpecting the propriety of complying with  
the juft and honourable -meafures propofed. If their arguments  
do not produce conviction, J. .koow,of nosing that will have  
greater influence, efpecially when. we recolleét that the fy{tem  
referred to, being the refiiR of the collegted wifdom df the con-  
tinent, muft be efteemed, ifpot perfect, éértainly the leat ub-  
jectionable of any that bold be deviled ; and that, if ir thall  
not be carried into imimediatéeXecution, a national bankrupt-  
cy, with all its deplorable confequences, will take place before  
any different plan can poflitdy be propofed or adopted ; fo pref-  
fing are the prefent circumttances, ‘and fuch is the alternative  
now offered to the States.  
  
The ability of this: counsry to difcharge the debts which  
have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted. An  
inclination, I flatter myfelf, will not be wanting ; the path of  
our duty is plain before us; honetty. will-be found, on every  
experiment, to be the-beft and only true policy. Let us then,  
as a nation, be juft; let us fulfil the public contrags which  
Congrefs had undoubtedly a right to make for the purpo’e of  
carrying on the war, with the fame good faith we fuppofe our-  
felves bound to pérform. our private engagementz.. In the  
  
, mean time, let an attention t6 the cheerful performances of  
  
their proper bufinefs, as. individuals, and as members of foe  
ciety, be earneitly incyleated on the citizens of America: then  
will they ftrengthen : the bands ‘of government, i  
under its protection. ~-Every ‘ore will reap the fruit of his la-  
bours ; every one will enjoy his own acquifitions, without mo-  
leftation and without danger.  
  
&#x27; Is this ftate of -abfolure freedom and petfe&amp;t fecurity, who  
will gradge to yield a very&quot;little of his property to fupport the  
common intere{ts of fociety, and infure the protection of go-  
vernment? Who does not remember the frequent declarations  
at the commencement of thé war, That we thould be com-

who wifhes to remain ‘indebted for the defence of his own per-  
fon and property to the exertions, the brave: y, and the blood. of  
others, without making ofe generous effort to repay the debt  
of honour and of gratitude? In what part of the Continent

S I R,  
  
great object for which I had Ihc  
X honour to hold an appointment in  
the fcrvice of my country being accom-  
plilbed, 1 am now preparing to refign it  
into the hands of Congrefs, and return to  
that domeftic retirement, which, it is  
well known, I left with the greateft rc-  
luftancc—a retirement for w hich I have  
never ceafed to figh through a long and  
painful abfence, in which (remote fiom  
the noife and trouble of the w’orld) I me¬  
ditate to pafs the remainder of my life  
in a Itate of undillurbed repofe; but,  
before I carry this refolution into efiet^f,  
  
1 think it a duty incumbent on me to  
make this mylaft oflicial communication,  
to congratulate you on the glorious events  
which heaven has been pleafedto produce  
in our favour, to ofler iny lentimeiits rc-  
fpectiug fome important fulness, which,  
appear to me to be intimately conneded  
with the tranquility of the United States,  
to take my leave of your Excellency as  
a public charader, and to give my  
final blclTing to that country in w&#x27;hofe  
fcrvice I have fpent the prime of my life;  
for whofe falCe 1 have cunfumed fo many  
anxious days and watchful nights, and  
Whofe happinefs, being extremely dear  
to &#x27;me, will alw&#x27;ays conflitiitc no incun-  
iiderable part of my own.  
  
ImprefTed with the livelicfi fenfibility on  
this plcafing occafion, I will claim the  
indulgence of dilating the more copiouf-  
ly on the fubjed of our mutual felicita¬  
tion. When wc conlidcr the magnitude  
  
of the conteft, and the favourable man¬  
ner in which it w&#x27;as terminated, we lhall  
find the greatell polfiblc rcafon for gra¬  
titude and rejoicing. This is a theme  
that will afford infinite delight to every  
benevolent and liberal mind, whether the  
event in contemplation be confidei ed as  
the fouice of prefent enjoyment, or the  
parent of future happinefs ; and we fhall  
have equal occafion to felicitate oiirfelvcs  
on the lot which providence has alfigned  
us, whether w’e view it in a natural, a  
political, or moral point of light.  
  
The citizens of America, placed iu  
the molt enviable condition, as the foie  
lords and proprietors of a valt trad of  
Continent, comprehending all the various  
iuHs and climates of the w&#x27;orld, and a-  
hounding with all the nccclTancs and  
conveniences of life, are now, by the late  
fati.sfawtory pacification, acknowledged  
to be poirefled of abfolute freedom and  
independence ; they are from this peri¬  
od to be amfidered as the adors on a  
moft confpicnons theatre, wdiich feems  
to be peculiarly defigned by providence  
for the dJl&#x27;play of human greatnefs and  
felicity. Here they arc not only fur-  
rounded with every thing that can con¬  
tribute to the completion of private and  
domefiic enjoyment, but heaven has  
crowned all its other blellings, by giving  
a fiirer opportunity for political happinefs  
than any other nation has ever been favou¬  
red with. Nothing can illuftrate thefe ob-  
fervations more forcibly than a recollec¬  
tion of the happy conjuudure of times  
and circumftances, under w&#x27;hich our Rc- &#x27;  
public allumcd its rank among the na¬  
tions. The foundation of our empire  
was not laid in the gloomy age of igno¬  
rance and fupcrftition, hut at an epocha  
when the rights of mankimi were better  
underltood, and more clearly defined,  
than at any former period. Refi&#x27;arches  
of the human mind after focial happinefs  
have been carried to a great extent; the  
treafures of knowledge, acquired by the  
labours of philofophers, fages, and Itgif-  
lators, through a long fucc^ion of years,  
are laid open for nfe, and their colieded  
wifdom may be happily applied in the  
cfiablifbmcnt of our forms of Govern¬  
ment. The free cultivation of letters, the  
unbounded extenfion ofcommcrce,thcprc-  
preflive refinement of manners, the grow¬  
ing liberality of fentiment, and above ail,  
the pure and benign light of revelation,  
have had a meliorating influence on  
mankind, and incrcafed the blciliogs of .

which the Union cannot be of long du¬  
ration : That there mull be a faithful and  
pointed compliance on the part of every  
State with the late propofals and demands  
of Congrcfs,orthemoft fatal confcqucnces  
will enfuc : That whatever meafurcs  
have a tendency to diflblve the Union, or  
contribute to violate or leflen the fove-  
reign authority, ought to be conlidcred  
as hoftilc to the liberty or independency  
of America, and the authors of them  
treated accordingly. And laftly, that  
unlefs we can be enabled by the concur¬  
rence of the States to participate of the  
fruits of the revolution, and enjoy the ef-  
fential benefits of fociety under a form  
of government fo free and uncorrupted,  
fo happily guarded againfi the danger of  
oppreflion, as has been devifed and  
adt)pted by the articles of confederation,  
it will be a fubje&lt;5l of regret that fo  
much blood and treafurc have been la-  
vifhed for no purpofe; that fo many  
fufferings have been encountered with¬  
out a com pen ration, and that fo many  
facrificeshavc been made in vain. Many  
other confiderations might here be addu¬  
ced to prove, that without an entire  
conformity to the fpirit of the Union, we  
cannot exift as an independent power.—  
It will be fufficient for my purpofe to  
mention but one or two, wdiich feem to  
me of the greateft importance. It is only  
in our united character, as an empire,  
that our powerican be regarded, or our  
credit fupported among foreign nations.  
The treaties of the European powers  
with the United States of America will  
have no validity on a diflblution of the  
Union. We fliall be left nearly in a  
(late of nature, or we may find, by our  
own unhappy experience, that there is a  
natural and neceffary progreflion from  
the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of  
tyranny; and that arbitrary power is  
mod eafily efiahlifhed on the ruins of li¬  
berty abided to licentioufnefs.  
  
As to the fecond article, which re-  
fpccls the performance of public jullicc,  
Congrefs have, in their late addrefs to  
the United States, almofl exhaufted the  
fubjed; they have explained their ideas  
fo fully, and have enforced the obliga¬  
tions the States are under to rcn&lt;lcr  
complete jullice to all the public credi¬  
tors, with fo much dignity and energy,  
that, in my opinion, no real friend to the  
honour and independency of America  
can hefitatc a tingle moment rcfp&gt;cding  
  
the propriety of complying with the juft  
and honourable mcafures propofed. If  
their arguments do not produce convic¬  
tion, 1 know of nothing that will have  
greater influence, efpccially when we re¬  
coiled that the fyllem referred to being  
the refull of the colleded wifdom of the  
continent, mull be efteemed, if not per-  
fed, certainly the lead objedionable of  
any that could be devifed ; and that .if  
it lhall not be carried into immediate exe¬  
cution, a national bankruptcy, with all  
its deplorable confequences, will take  
place before any diflerent plan can polli;  
  
• bly be propofed or adopted; fo prefling  
are the prefent circumftances, .and fuch  
is the alternative now offered to the  
States. •  
  
The ability of the country to dlfchar^  
the debts which have been incurred in  
its defence, is not to be doubted. An  
inclination, I flatter irtyfclf, will not be  
wanting; the path of our duty is plain  
before us ; honefty will be found on eve¬  
ry experiment to be the bell and only  
true policy. I.et us then, as a nation, be  
juft ; let us fulfill the public cbntrads  
which Congrefs had undoubtedly a right  
to make for the purpofe of carrying on  
the w’ar, with the fame good faith wc  
fuppofc ourfelves bound to perform our  
private engagements. In the mean time,  
let an attention to the chearful perfor¬  
mance of their proper bufinefs, as indi¬  
viduals, and as members of fociety, be  
carneftly inculcated on the citizens of  
America; then will they ftrength’en the  
hands of government, and be happy un¬  
der its protedlion. Every one will reap  
the fruit of his labours ; every one will  
enjoy his own acquifitions without mo-  
leilation, .and without danger.  
  
, In this ftatc of abfolute freedom and  
pcrfe4fl fecurity, who will grudge to yield  
a very little of his property to fiipport  
the common intcrefts of fociety, and en-  
fure the protedlion of government.^ Who  
docs not remember the frequent decla¬  
rations at the commencement of the  
war, that we fliould be completely fii-  
tisfied, if at the expence of one half, wc  
could defend the remainder of our pof-  
feflions? Where is the man to be found  
who wifhes to remain indebted for the  
defence ()f his own perfon and property  
to the exertions, the bravery, and ^thc  
bloiKl of others, without making one’ge¬  
nerous effort to repay the debt of honour  
and of gratitude ?—In what part of the  
  
THEEDIN BURGH  
  
J70  
  
continent we find any man, or body  
of tncii, who would not bliilli to ftand  
up, and oppofe mcafurcs purpofely cal-  
cniatrd to rob the foldicr of his (tipeiid,  
and the public creditor of his due ?—And  
w&#x27;cre it poflibic that fuch a flagrant in-  
ftance of injurtice could cter happen,  
would it not excite the general indigna¬  
tion, and tend to bring down upon the  
authors of fuch meafurcs the aggravate&lt;! &#x27;  
ver.geance of heaven : If after all, a fpi-  
rit of difunion, or a temper of obftinac)  
and perverfeneft fiiould manifeft itfelf in  
any of the States ; if fuch an ungracious  
difpofition Ihoiild attempt to fruftrate all  
the happy effeds that might be expetfted  
to flow from the Union ; if there ihould  
be a lefufal to comply with requifit^ons  
for funds to difeharge the annual intcreft  
of the public debts, and if that rcfiifal  
fhould revive all thofc jealoiilics, and  
produce all thofe evils which are now  
happily removed, Congrefs, who have in  
all their tranfaCtions Ihown a great de¬  
gree of magnanimity and juft ice, will  
ftand jiiftified in the fight of God and  
man ! And that State alone, which puts  
itfelf in oppolition to the aggregate wif-  
dom of the continent, and follows fuch  
millakcn and pernicious councils, will be  
rtfponfible for all the confcquences.  
  
For my own part, confeious of having  
af^ed, while a fervant of the public, in  
the manner 1 conceiNxd beft fuited to  
promote the real intereftsof my country;  
ha\ing in confeqiiencc of my fixed be¬  
lief, in fome meafure, pledged myfelf to  
tlie aimy, that their country would final¬  
ly do them complete and ample jiiftice,  
and not wiihing to conceal any inftance  
of my official condiKft from the eyes of  
the worhl,—I have thought proper to  
tranfmit to your Excellency the inclofcd  
colle^lit&gt;n »&gt;f pa|&gt;ers, relative to the half¬  
pay and commutation granted by Con¬  
grefs to the officers of the army; from  
thefe ciuumunications, my decided fen-  
tijnents will be clearly comprehended,  
together with the condufive reafons  
winch induced me, at an early period, to  
recommend the adoption of this meafure  
in the moft earneft and ferious manner.  
As the proceedings of Congrefs, the  
anny, and myfelf, are open to all, and  
contain in my opinion, fufficient informa¬  
tion to rtan4»vc the prejudices and errors  
which may have been entertained by any,  
1 think it unneceffary to fay any thing  
more, tha!i juft to obferve, that the refo-  
lutior.s of Cun^rtfs, now alluded to, arc  
  
as unavoidably and abfolutcly binding  
upon the States as the moft folemn syCts  
of confederation or legifl«ation.  
  
As to the idea which I am informed ha8|  
in fome inftances, prevailed, that the  
half-pay and commutatmn are to be re¬  
garded merely in the odious light pf,^  
penfion, it ought to be exploded for ever.  
That provifion ffiould be view&#x27;ed, as it  
really was, a realoiiable compenfatio&#x27;n  
offered bv Congrefs, at a time when they  
had nothing elfe to give to the officers  
of the army, for fcrviccs then to be per¬  
formed. It was the only means to, pre¬  
vent a total derelidion of the fervice.; it  
was a part of their hire : I may be .si-  
lowed to (ay it w&#x27;as the price of ,theif  
blood, and of your independency ; it is  
therefore more than a common debt, it  
is a debt of honour! It can never be con-  
fidcred as a penfion or gratuity, nor can¬  
celled until it is fairly difeharged.  
  
With regard to the diftin(5lion between  
officers and foldiers, it is fufficicn\ that  
the uniform experience of every nation  
of the w orld, combined wfith our*^ own,  
proves the utility and propriety, of the  
diferimination. Rewards in proportion  
to the aids the public draw’s from them  
arc unqucftionably due to all its ferv’ants*  
In fome lines the foldiers have, oerhaps,  
generally had as ample compenlation for,  
their fervices, by the large bounties whicll  
have been paid them, as their officers,  
will receive in the propofed commutati¬  
on ; in others, if, befides the donation  
of land, the payment of arrearages of.  
clothing and wages (in which articles all  
the component parts of the army muft  
be put upon the fame footing), we take  
into the eftimate the bounties many qf  
the foldiers have received, and the gra¬  
tuity of one year&#x27;s full pay, which is pro^  
inifed to all, poffibly their fitiiatiun  
(every’ circiimftance being duly confider-  
ed) w ill not be deemed lefts eligible than  
that of the officers. Should a further  
reward, how&#x27;cver, be judged equitable,!  
w’ill venture to affert, no man will enjoy  
greater fatisfadlion than myfelf in an ex¬  
emption from taxes for a limited time  
(wliich has been petitioned for in  
fome inftances), or any other adequate  
immunity or compenfation granted ta  
the brave defenders of their country’s  
caufe. But neither the adoption or re¬  
jection of this propofition will in anr  
manner aft&#x27;eCt, much lefts militate agaioir  
the aCt of Congrefs, by which they have  
offered five years fuU pay in lieu of the  
  
WEEKLY MAGAZINE.  
  
2n  
  
h^ilf-pAy for life, which had been before t  
promifed to the officers of the army. ^  
  
Before 1 conclude the fubje(ft of public ^  
juftice, 1 cannot omit to mention the j  
obligation&#x27;, this country is under to that ,  
meritorious clafs of veterans, the non- &#x27;*  
commiffioned officers and privates who ,  
have been difeharged forin.ability, in con- •  
ftqucnce of the refolution of Congrefs, |  
of the 23d of Apiil 1782, on an annual 1  
penfion for life. Their peculiar fuffer- !  
ings, their fingular merits, and claims to  
that provifion need only to be known, to  
intereft the feelings of humanity in their  
behalf ; nothing but a pundual payment  
of their annual allowance can refeue  
them from the molt complicated mifery;  
and nothing could be a more melancholy  
and diftreffing fight, than to behold thofc  
who have Ihed their blood, or lolt their  
limbs in the fervice of their country,  
without a (belter, without a friend, and  
without the means of obtaining any of  
the comforts or nccclTarics of life, com¬  
pelled to beg their daily bread from door  
to door. Suffer me to recommend thofC  
of this defeription, belonging to your  
State, to the warmed patronage of your  
Excellency and your legiflature.  
  
It is necedary to fay but a few wortls  
on the third topic w’hich was propofed,  
and which regards particularly the de¬  
fence of the republic, as there can be lit¬  
tle doubt but Congrefs will recommend  
a proper peace cflablilbment for the Uni¬  
ted States, in w&#x27;hich a due attention will  
be paid to the importance of placing the  
militia of the Union upon a regular and  
rcfpcflable brnting. If this (hould be  
the cafe, I Ihould beg leave to urge  
the great advantage of it in the flrongeff  
terms.  
  
I&#x27;he militia of this country mud be  
conlidcrtd as the palladium of our fecu-,  
rity, and the fird cffe&lt;dual refort in cafe  
of hodility. It is edential, therefore,  
that the fame fydem ffiould pervade the  
whole ; that the formation and difciplinc  
of the militia of the continent fliould be  
abfolutely uniform; and that the fame fpe-  
cies of arms, accoutrements, and military  
apparatus, (hould be introduced in every  
part of the United States. No one,  
who has not learned it from experience,  
can conceive the difficulty, expcnce, and  
confufion which rcfult from a contrary  
fydem, or the vague arrangements which  
have hitherto prevailed.  
  
If, in treating of political points, a  
greater latitude than nfual has liecn ta¬  
ken in the courfe of this addrefs, the im¬  
  
portance of the crifis, and the magnitude  
of the objcdls in difcullion, mud be my apo¬  
logy. It is, however, ueilhcr my wifli  
nor expedtation, that the preceding ob-  
fervatioos Ihould claim any regard, ex¬  
cept fo far as they (hall appear to be dic¬  
tated by a good intention; confonant to  
the immutable rules ofjudice, calculated  
to prinluce a liberal fydem of policy, and  
founded on whatever experience may  
have lieen acquired by a long and clofe  
attention to public bunnefs. Here I  
might fpeak with more confidence from  
my adlual obfervations ; and if it would  
not fwell this letter (already too prolix)  
beyond the bounds 1 had preferibed to  
myfeif,! could dcmonftralc to every mind  
opciijto conviction, that in Icfs time, and  
with much Icls expcnce than has been,  
incurred, the war iniglit have been  
brought to the fame J»appy concluiioii,  
if the refources of the continent could  
have been properly called forth. That  
the didreffes and difappointments which  
have very often occurred, have, in too  
many indances,refulted more from a want  
of energy in the continental government,  
than a deficiency of means in the parti¬  
cular States. Thai the inefficacy of mea-  
fiires, arifing from the want of an ade¬  
quate authority in tlic fupreme power,  
from a partial compliance with the re-  
quilitions of Congrefs in fomc of the  
States, and from a failure of punduality  
in others, while they tended to damp the  
zeal of thofe who were more willing to  
exert themfelves, ferved alfo to accumu¬  
late the expences of the war, and to fi ni¬  
trate the Ixd concerted plans ; and that  
the difcouragemenl occaiioned by the  
complicated difficulties and embarrad-  
ments, in which our affairs were by this*  
rueans involved, w&#x27;ould have long ago  
produced the diffolutiun of any array  
icfs patient, lefs virtuous, and lefs per-  
fevering, than that which I have had the  
honour to command. But while I men¬  
tion thofe tilings, which are notorious  
fiu^ts, as the deftifts of our fnederal  
conditution, particularly in theprofccu-  
tion of a w^ar, I beg it may be under ft ood,  
that as I have ever taken a pleafure in  
gratefully acknowledging the affiftance  
and fupport I have derived from every  
clafs of citizens, fo fliall I alw&#x27;ays be hap¬  
py to dojudiceto the unparalleled exer¬  
tions of the individual States on many in-  
tcreding ixcariuns.  
  
I have thus freely clifclofeil what I  
wiihed to make known before I furren-  
(lercd up my public truft to thofe w^g

HE ability of the country to difcharge  
  
the debts which have been incurred in  
its defence is not to be doubted. An inclina-  
tion, I flatter myfelf, will not be wanting: the  
path of our duty is plain before us: honefty  
will be found, in every experiment, to be the  
beft and only true policy. Let us then, as a  
nation, be juft; let us fulfill the public con-  
tracts which Congrefs has undoubtedly a right  
to make for the purpofe of carrying on the  
war, with the fame good faith wefuppofe our-  
felves bound to perform our private engage-  
ments, In the mean time let an attention to  
the chearful performance of their proper bufi-  
nefs, as individuals, and as members of fociety,  
be earneftly inculcated on the citizens of Ame-  
rica; then will they ftrengthen the hands of  
government, and be happy under its protection.  
Every one will reap the fruit of h&#x27;s labours;  
every one will enjoy his own acquifitions,  
without moleftation, and without danger.  
  
In this ftate of abfolute freedom and perfect  
fecurity, who will grudge to yield a very little  
of his property to fupport the common inte-  
refts of fociety, and enfure the protection of  
government? Who does not remember the  
frequent declarations at the commencement of  
the war, That we fhould be completely fatise  
fied, if, at the expence of one half, we could  
defend the remainder of oug poffeffions? Where  
is the man to be found who withé¢s to remain  
indebted, for the defence of his own perfon and  
property, to the exertions, the bravery, and the  
blood of others, without making one generous:  
effort to repay the debt of honour and of grati  
tude? In what part of the Continent thal! we  
find any man, or body of men, who would  
not blufh to ftand up and propofe meafures  
purpofely calculated to rob the foldier of his  
itipend, and the public creditor of his due?  
And were it poflible that fuch a flagrant in  
ftance of injuftice could ever happen, would  
it not excite the general indignation, and tend  
to bring down, upon the authors of fuch meae  
fures, the aggravated vengeance of Heaven ?  
If, after all, a {pirit of difunion, ora temper  
of obftinacy and perverfenefs, fhould manifet  
itfelf in any of the States; if fuch an ungrae  
cious difpofition fhould att-mpt to fruftrate all  
the happy effeéts that might be expeéted to  
flow from the union; if there fhould be a re-  
fufal to comply with requifitions for funds to  
difcharge the annual intereft of the public debte,  
and. if that refufal fhould revive all thofe jea-  
loufies, and produce ali thofe evils, which are  
now happily removed; Congrefs, who have,  
in all their tranfactions, fhewn a great degree  
of magnanimity and juftice, will (tand juftified  
in the fight of Gop and man! And that State

; {uel

fuch miftaken and pernicious councils, will be  
refponfible for all thé confequences.  
  
For my own part, confcious of having aéted,  
while a fervant of the publick, in the mancer  
I conceived beft fuited to promote the real in-  
terefts of my country; having, in confequence  
of my fixed belief, in fome meafure pledged  
myfelf to the army. that their country would  
finally do them complete and ample juftice ;  
and not wifhing to conceal any inftance of my  
Official conduct from the eyes of the world; I  
have thought proper to tran/mit to your Excel-  
lency the inclofed collection of papers, relative  
to the half-pay and commutation granted by  
Congrefs to the officers of the army: from  
thefe communications my decided fentiments  
will be clearly comprehended, together with  
the conclufive reafons which induced me, at  
an early period, te recommend the adoption of  
this meafure.in the moft carneft and ferious  
manner. As the proceedings of Congrefs, the  
army, and mylelf, are open to all, and contain,  
in ‘ny opinion, fufficien: information to remove  
the prejudice and errors which may have been  
entertained by any, I think it unneceffary to  
fay any thing more than juft to obferve, that  
the refolutions of Cangrefs now alluded to are  
as unavoidably and abfolutely binding upon the  
United States as the moft folema atts of con-  
federation or legiflation.  
  
As to the idea, which, I am informed, has  
in fome inftances prevailed, that the half-pay  
and.commotation are to be regarded merely in  
the odious light of a penfion, it ought to be  
exploded for ever; that provifion fhould be  
viewed, as it really was, a reafonable compen-  
fation, offered by Congrefs at a time wh-n  
they bad nothing elfe to give, to officers of the  
aroy for fervices therf to be performed; it wes  
the only means.to prevent a total dere):Ction of  
the fervice; it-was a part of their hire; { may  
be allowed to fay it was the price of their  
blood, and of your independency; it is there-  
fore more thana common debt; it isadett of  
honeur; it can never be confidered as a per-  
fion or gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly  
difcharged.  
  
With regard to the diftinétion between offi-  
cers and foldiers, it is fafficient that the uni-  
form experience cf every nation of the world,  
  
* cambined with our own, proves the utility ard  
propriety of the difcrimination. Rewards, in  
proportion to the aids the publick draws from  
them, are ungoeft&#x27;cnably due to all its fervants.  
Jn fome lines the foldiers have, perhaps, gene-  
rdlly had as amp&#x27;e compenfation fer their fer-  
vices; by the large bounties which have been  
paid them, as their officers. will receive in the  
propofed commutation; in others, if, befides  
the donation of land, the payment of arrear-  
ages. of clothing and wages (ia which ariicies  
aljthe component parts of the army mutt be  
put ypon the fame footing) we take into the  
eftimate the bounties many of the foldiers have  
received, and the gratuity of one year’s full  
pay, which is promifed to ail, poffibly their fi-  
tuation (every circumftance being duly confi  
  
General Wahhington’s Circular Letter on bis Refignation.  
  
gered) will not be deemed lefs eligible thay  
that of the officers. Should a further reward,  
however, be judged equitable, I will venture to  
affert, no man will enjoy greater fatisfattion  
than myfelf in an exemption from taxes for a  
limited time (which has been petitioned for in  
fome inftances), or any other adequate immu-  
nity or compenfation granted to the brave de,  
fenders of their country’s caufe; but neither  
the adoption or rejeétion of this propofition  
will in any manner affe€t, much lefs militate  
againtt, the aéts cf Congrefs, by which they  
have offered five years fu!l-pay, in lieu of the  
hailf-pay for life, which had been before pro-  
mifed to the officers of rhe army,  
  
Before I conclude the fubje€t of public juf-  
tice, I cannot omit to mention the obligations  
thig country is under to that meritorious clafs  
of veterans, the non-comm. ffioned officers and  
privates, who have been difcharged for inability  
in confequence of the refolution of Congrefs of  
the 23d of April 1782, on an annual penfion  
for lite: their pecuhar fufferings, their fingular  
merits and claims to that provifion, need only  
to be known, to intereit the feelings of huma-  
nity in their behalf: nothing but a punétual  
payment of- their annual allowance can refcue  
them from the moft complicated mifery; and  
nothing could be a more melancholy and dif-  
treffing fight than to behold thofe who Rave’  
thed their blood, or loft their limbs in the fer-  
vice of their country, without a fhelter, withs  
out a friend, and without the means of obtains  
ing any of the comforts or neceffaries of fife,”  
compelled to beg their daily bread from door to  
door. Suffer me to recommend thofe of this  
defcription, belonging to your State, to the  
warmeft patronage of your Excellency and  
your Legiflature.  
  
It is neceffary to fay but a few words on the  
third topic which was propofed, and which re-  
gerds particularly the defence of the republic.  
As .here can be litle doubt but Congrefs wil]  
recommend a proper peace-eftablifhment for  
the United States, in which a due attention  
will be paid to the imprtance of placing the  
militia of the Unioa upon a regular and refpect-  
able footing; if this fhould be the cafe, T fhoold  
beg leave to urge the great advantage of it, in  
the ftrongef terms.  
  
The militia of this country mu‘ be confi-  
dered as the palladium of our fecurity, and the  
firtt effeétual xgigrt in cafe of hoftility: it is  
effential theref6rc, that the fare fyftem fhould  
pervade the whole; that the formation and  
difcipline of them: litia of the Cuntinent fhould  
be abfolutely uniform; and that the fame f,e-  
cies of arms, accoutrements, and military-ap-  
paratus, fhou&#x27;d be introduced in every part of  
the United Stites. No one, who has not  
learned’ it from experience, can conceive the  
difficuliy, expence, and tonfufion, which refult  
from a contrary fyRem, or the vague arrange-  
ments which have hitherto prevailed.  
  
If, in treating of politics! point’, a greater la-  
titude than ufual has been taken in the courfe  
of the addrefs, the importance of the crifis, “s

the magnitude of the objects in difcuffion, mutt  
be my apology. It is, however, neither my  
with nor expectation that the preceding obfer-  
  
vations fhould claim any regard, except fo far ,  
  
as they fhould appear to be digtated by a good  
intention; confonant to the immutable rules of  
juftice; calculated to produce a liberal fyftem  
of policy, and founded on whatever experience  
may have been acquired by a long and clofe at-  
tention to public bufinefs. Here 1 might fpeale  
with more confidence, from my actual obfer-  
vations; and if it would not fwell this letter  
{already too prolix) beyond the bounds I hed  
preferibed myfelf, 1 could cemonftrate to every  
mind, open to conviction, that in Icfs time,  
and with much lefs expence than has been in-  
curred, the war might have been brought to  
the fame happy conclofion, if the refources of  
the Continent could have been properly called  
forth: that the diftreffes and difappointments,  
which have very often occurred, lave, in too  
many inftances, refulted more from a want of  
energy in the Continental Government, than  
a deficiency of means in the particular States:  
that the inefficacy of meafures, arifing from  
the want of an adequate authority in the fu-  
preme power, from a partial compliance with  
the requifitions of Congrefs in fome of the  
States, and from a failure of punétuality in  
others, while they. tended to damp the zeal of  
thofe who were more willing to exert them-  
felves, ferved alfo to accumolate the expences  
of the war, and to fruftrate the beft-concerted  
plans; and that the difcouragement occafioned  
by the complicated difficulties and embarraff-  
ments, in which our affairs were by this means  
involved, would have long aga produced the  
dilfolution of any army, lefs patient, lefs vir-  
tuous, and lefs perfevering, than that which.J  
have had the honour to command.—But, while  
J mention thofe things, which are notorious  
faéts, as the defeét: of our federal conftitu-  
tion, particularly in the profecution of a war,  
I beg it may be underftood that, as I have ever  
taken a pleafure in gratefully acknowledging  
the affiftance and fupport I have derived from  
every clafs of citizens, fo 1 fhall always be  
happy to do juflice to the unparalleled exer-  
tions of the individual:States, on many inter-  
hing occafions.  
  
Ihave thus freely difclofed what I wifhed  
to make known before I furrendered up my  
public truft to thofe who committed it to me,  
‘The tefk is now accomplifhed; 1 now bid  
adiew to your Excellency, as the chief magiftrate  
of your State; at the fame time I bida lait  
farewell to the cares of office, and all the em-  
ployments of public life.  
  
It remains then to be my final and only  
requ:ft, that your Excellency will communicate  
thefe fentiments to your Legiflature, at their  
next meeting; and that they may be confi-  
dered asthe legacy of one who has ardently  
wifhed, on all occaGons, to be ufeful to his  
country, and who, even in the fhade of retire-  
ment, will not fail to implere the divine bene-  
dition upon it,  
  
I now make it my earneft prayer, that Gow  
would have you, and the State over which you’  
prefide, in his holy protection: that he would  
incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a  
{pirit of fubordination and obedience to Goe.  
vernment; to entertain a brotherly affe€tion  
and love for one another, for their fellow-ci-  
tizens of the United States at large, and pare  
ticularly for their brethren who have ferved in  
the field; and finally, that he would moft gra-  
cioufly be pleafed to difpofe us all to do juftice,  
to love mercy, and to demean ourfelves with  
that charity, humility, and pacific temper of  
mind, which were the charaéteriftics of the  
Divine Author of our bleffed religion; with-  
out an humble imitation of whofe example, in  
thefe things, we can never hope: to: be: achappy

Head Quarters, Newburgh,  
  
une 18, 1783.  
  
SIR,  
  
HE great object, for  
  
which I had the honour  
to hold an appointment in the  
fervice of my country, being  
accomplifhed, I am now pre~  
paring to refign it into the  
hands of congrefs, and ret rn  
to that domeftic retirement,  
which, it is well known, I left  
with the greateft reluctance 3  
  
a retirement for which I have  
never ceafed to figh through a  
long and painful abfence, and  
in which, (remote from the  
noife and trouble of the world)  
I meditate to pafs the remain-  
der of life, in a ftate of undif-  
turbed repofe: but, before I  
carry this refolution into ef-  
fect, I think it a duty incum-  
bent on me, to make this my  
Ja{t official communication, to  
congratulate you on the glo-  
rious events which heaven has  
been pleafed to produce in  
our favour ; to offer my fenti-  
ments refpecting fome impor-  
tant fubjects, which appear to  
me to be intimately connected  
with the tranquility of the  
united ftates ; to take my leave  
of your excellency as a public  
character ; and to give my fi-  
nal bleffing to that country,  
in whofe fervice I have fpent  
the prime of my life ; for  
whofe

whofe fake I have confumed  
fo many anxious days and  
watchful nights ; and whofe  
happinefs, being extremely  
dear to me, will always contti-  
tute no inconfiderable part of  
my own.  
  
Impreffed with the livelict  
fenfibility on this pleafing r OC-  
cafion, I will claim the indul-  
gence ‘of dilating the more co-  
pioufly on the fubject of our  
  
mutual felicitation. When we  
confider the magnitude of the  
prize we contended for, the  
doubtful nature of the ‘con-  
teft, and the favourable man-  
ner in which it has termina-  
ted—we fhall find the greateft  
poffible reafon for gratitude  
and rejoicing: this is a theme  
that will afford infinite delight  
to every benevolent and libe-  
ral mind, whether the event  
in contemplation be confider-  
ed asa agpage of prefent en-  
joyment, or the parent of fu-  
ture Seeuiects; ; and we fhall  
have equal occafion to felici-  
tate ourfelves on the lot which  
providence has affigned us,  
whether we view it In a natu-  
ral, a political, or moral point  
of light.  
  
The citizens of America,  
placed in the moft enviable  
condition, as the fole lords  
and proprictors of a vaft  
tract of continent, compre-  
hending all the various foils  
and climates of the world,  
and abounding with all the ne-  
ceffaries and converiencies of  
life, are now, by the late fatis-  
  
factory pacification, acknow-  
ledged to be poffeffed of abfo-  
  
_lute freedom.and independen-  
t  
  
cy. They are from this period  
to be confidered as actors on  
a molt confpicuous theatre,  
which feems to be peculiarly  
defioned ! by providence ior the  
difvlav of human preatnefs  
and felicity. Here they are  
not ouly furrounded with  
every thing that can contri-  
bute to the completion of pri-  
vate and domeftic enjoyment ;  
but heaven has crowned all its  
other bleifings by giving  
  
furer opportunity for political  
happinefs, than any other na-  
tion has ever been favoured  
with. Nothing can illuftrate  
thefe obfervations more forci-  
bly than a recollestion of  
the happy conjuncture of  
times and circumflances, un-  
der which our republic af-  
fumed its rank among the na-  
tions. The foundation of cur  
empire was not laid in a gloo-  
my age of ignorance and fu-  
perftition, but at an epocha  
when the rights of mankind  
were better ‘underftood, and  
more Clearly defined, than at  
any former period. Refearches  
  
- of the human mind aiter focial  
  
happinefs have been carried to  
a great extent; the treafures  
of knowledge acquired by the  
labours of philoforhers, fages,  
and legiflators, through a long  
fucceMfion of years, are laid  
open for ufe, and their collec-  
ted wifdom may be happily  
applied in the efiablifiment of  
  
our  
  
  
  
Circular Letter of General Wafhington.  
  
our forms of government. The  
free cultivation of letters, the  
unbounded extenfion of com-  
merce, the proereflive refine-  
ment of manners, the growing  
liberality of fentiment, and,  
above all, the pure ana benign  
licht of revelation, have hada  
teh te laiiecines on man-  
kind, and increafed the blef-  
fings of fociety. At this auf-  
picious period, the united  
{tates came into exiftence as a  
nation: and if their citizens  
fhould not be completely free  
and happy, the faule will be  
entirely their own.  
Such is our fituation,  
fuch are our profpects : but  
notwithi{tandi a the cup of  
bleffing is thus reached out to  
us——notwithfta inding happi-  
nefs is ours, if we have a dif-  
  
and  
  
po: Stion to Solon the oc cafi ( mn,  
and make it our own—yet it  
  
appears to me there is  
tion ftill left to the waited  
ftates of America, whether  
they will be refpectable and  
profperous, or contemptible  
and miferable as a nation.  
This is the time of their politi-  
cal probation. This is the mo-  
ment when the ; of the  
whole world are turned upon  
them. This is the moment  
to eftablifh or ruin their na-  
tional character for ever. This  
is the favourable moment  
to give SUCH A TONE  
TO THE FRBDERAL GO-  
/t RNMENT, aswillenable  
it to anfwer the ends of its in-  
f{ticution; or, this may b: the  
  
an op=  
  
389  
ill-fated moment for relaxing  
the powers of the union, anni-  
hilating the cement o! ‘the con-  
federation, and expofing us to  
become the fort of European  
politics, which may play one  
itate againft another, to pre-  
vent their growing impor-  
tance, and to ferve their own  
interefted purpoles. For, ac-  
cording to the iyftem of po-  
licy the ftates fhall adopt at  
this moment, they will ftand  
or falk; and, by their confir-  
mation or lapfe, it is yet to be  
decided, whether the revolu-  
tion muft ultimately be confi-  
dered as a bleiling or a curfe;  
a blefiing or a curfe, not to  
the prefent age alone, for with  
our fate will the deftiny of  
unborn millions be involved.  
With this conviction of the  
importance of the prefent cri-  
fis, filence in me would be a  
crime. I will therefore {peak  
to your excellency the lan-  
guage of freedom and fince-  
rity, without difguife. I am  
aware, however,, thofe who  
differ from me in ecenaney fen-  
timents, may, thaps, re-  
mark, I am hepping out of  
the proper line of my duty ;  
and they may poflibly afcribe  
to arrogance or oftentation,  
what I know is alone the refule  
of the pureft intention. But the  
rectitude of my own heart,  
which difdains fuch unworthy  
motives---the part I have hi-  
therto acted in life---the de-  
termination I have formed of  
not taking any fhare in p iblic  
buiinels

defire I feel, and fhall conti-

fits of a wife and liberal go-  
vernment, will, I flatter my-  
felf, fooner or later, convince  
my countrymen, that I could  
have no finifter views in deli-  
vering with fo little referve the  
opinions contained in this ad-  
drefs.  
  
There are four things which  
I humbly conceive are effen-

even venture to fay, to the

which will induce them to for.  
get their local prejudices and  
policies, to make thofe mutual  
conce‘figns which are requifite  
to the general profperity, and,  
in fome inftaaces, to facrifice  
their individual advantages to  
the intereft of the community.  
Thefeare the pillars on which  
the glorious fabric of our inde-  
pendency and national cha-  
racter muft be fupported. Li-  
berty is the bafis---and whoe-  
ver would dare to fap the foun-  
dation, or overturn the ftruc-  
ture, under whatever fpecious  
pretext he may attempt.it, will  
merit the bitrereft execrat.on,  
and the fevereft punifhment,  
which can be inflicted by his  
injured country. :  
On the 3 firft.articles, I will  
make a few obfervations } leav-  
  
ing the laft to the good fenfe  
and fericus confideration of  
thofe immediately concerned.  
Under the firft head, altho’  
it may not be neceffary or pro-  
  
per for mein this place to enter  
intoa particular difquifition of  
the principles of the union,  
and to take up the great quef-  
tion which has been frequent  
ly agitated, whether it be ex-  
pedient and requifite for the  
flares to delegate a larger pro-  
portion of power to congrefs,  
or not; yet it will bea part of  
my duty, and that of every  
true patriot, to affert, without  
referve, and toinfift upon the  
following pofitions: That ur-  
lcfs the feates will fuffer con-  
erefs to excreife thofe preroga-  
oe amiss tives

tives they are undoubtedly in-  
vefted with by the conftitution,  
every thing muft very rapidly  
tend to anarchy and confufion.  
That it is indifpenfable to the  
happinefs of the individual  
ftates, that there fhould be  
lodged, fomewhere, a SU-  
PREME POWER to regulate  
and govern the general con-  
cerns of the prod Sentont re~  
public, without which the uni-  
on cannot be of long dtiration.  
That there muft be a faithful  
and pointed compliance on the  
part of every ftate with the late  
lake ye als and demands of con-  
grefs, or the moft fatal confe-  
quences wilkenfue—that what-  
ever meafures have a tendency  
to diffolve the union, or contri-  
bute to violate or lefJen the fo-  
vereign authority, ought to be  
confidered as hoftile to the li-  
berty and independency of A-  
merica, and the authorsof them  
treated accordingly---and laft-  
ly, that unlefs we can be ena-  
bled by the concurrence of the  
{tates to participate of the fruits  
of the revolution, and enjoy  
the effential benefits of civil fo-  
ciety, under a form of govern-  
ment fo free and uncorrupted,  
fo happily guarded againft the  
danger of oppreffion, as has  
been devifed and adopted by  
the articles of confederati-  
on, it will be a fubject of re-  
gret, that fe much blood and  
treafure have been lavifhed  
for no purpofe; that fo many  
fufferings have been encoun-  
tered Without a compenfation,  
  
398  
and that fo many facrifices  
have been made in vain. Many  
other confiderations might  
here be adduced to prove, that  
without an entire conformity  
to the fpirit of the union, we  
cannot exift as an independent  
power. It will be fufficient for  
my purpofe to mention but  
one or two, which feem to me  
of the greateft importance. It  
is only in our united charac-  
ter, as an empire, that our in-  
dependence is acknowledged,  
that our power can be regard-  
ed, or our credit fupported  
among foreign nations. The  
treaties of the European pow-  
ers, with the united ftates of  
America, will have no validity  
on a diffolution of the union.  
We fhall be left nearly ina ftate  
of nature, or we may find by  
our own unhappy experience,  
that there is a natural and ne-  
ceffary progreffion from the ex-  
treme of anarchy to the ex-  
treme of tyranny; and that ar-  
bitrary power is moft eafily ef-  
tablifhed on the ruins of liber-  
ty abufed to licentioufnefs.  
As to the fecond article,  
which refpects the perfor-  
mance of public juftice, con-  
grefs have, in their late ad-  
drefs to the united ftates, al-  
moft exhaufted the fubject.  
They have explained their  
ideas fo fully, and have en-  
forced the obligations the  
ftates are under to render com-  
plete juftice to all the public  
creditors, with fo much digni-

opinion, no real friend to the  
  
honour and independency of  
  
America, can hefitatea fingle  
moment rei pecting the propri-  
ety of complying with the juft  
and honourable meafures pro-  
pofed. It their arguments do

the refult of the collected W if-  
dom of the continent, muft be

tainly the ‘eat objectionable

pothbly be propofed or adopt-  
  
ed; fo pref lang are the prefent  
circum(ftat ces, and fuch is the  
alternative now offered to the  
ftates.  
  
The ability of the country  
to difcharge the debts which  
have been incurred in its de-  
fence, is not to be doubted:  
and inclination, I flatter my-  
felf, will not be wanting. The  
path of our duty is plain be-  
tore us. Honefty will be found,  
on every experiment, to be  
the beft and only true po-  
licy. Let us then, as a nation,  
be juft. Let us fulfil the pub-  
lic contracts which congrefs  
had undoubtedly a right to  
make, for the purpofe of car-  
rying on the war, with the  
  
fame good faith we fuppofe  
ourfelves bound to pertorm  
our private engagements. In  
the mean time, let an atten-  
tion to the chearful perfor-  
mance of their proper bufinefs,  
as indivi iduals, andas members  
of fociety, be carne ‘tly incul-  
cated en the citizens of Ame-  
rica. Then will they ftrength-  
en the hands of government,  
and be happy uncer its protec.  
tion. Every one will reap the  
fruit of his labours. Every one  
will enjoy his own acquifi-  
tions, without moleflation,  
and without danger.  
  
In this {tate of abjolute free-  
dom and perfect fecurity, who  
will grudge to yielda very lit-  
tle of his property to fupport  
the common interg{ts of foci-  
ety, and infure thé protection  
of government ? Who does  
not remember the frequent de-  
clarations at the commence-  
ment of the war, That we  
thould be completely fatisfed,  
if, at the expence of one half,  
we could defend the remain-  
der of our poffeffions? Where  
is the man to be found, who  
wifhes to remain in debt for  
the defence of his own perfon  
and property, to the exertions,  
  
the bravery, and the blood of  
  
others, without one generous  
effort to repay the debr of ho-  
nour and of gratitude? In  
what part of the continent  
fhall we find any man, or bod  
of men, who would not bluth

fures purpofely calculated .

and the public creditor of his

fuch a flagrant inftance of in-  
juftice could ever happen,  
would it not excite the gene-  
ral indignation, and tend to  
bring down upon the authors  
of fuch meafures the aggrava-

fervant of the public, in the  
manner I conceived fuited to  
promote the real interefts of  
  
5  
  
$93  
my country; having, in con-  
fequence of my fixed belief, in  
fome meafure, pledged myfelf  
to the army, that their country  
would finally do them com-  
plete and ample juftice, and  
not wifhing to conceal any in-  
ftance of my official conduét  
from the eyes of the world, I  
have thought proper to tranf-  
mit to your excellency the in-  
clofed collection of papers, re-  
lative to the half-pay and com-  
mutation nail by congrefs  
to the officers of the army.  
From thefe communications,  
my decided fentiment may be  
comprehended, together with  
the conclufive reafons which  
induced me, at an early period,  
to recommend the adoption of  
this meafure, in the moft ear--  
neft and ferious manner. As  
the proceedings of congrefs,  
the army, and myfelf, are open  
to all, and contain, in my opi-  
nion, fufficient information to  
remove theprejudices and er-  
rors which may have been en-  
tertained by any, I think it  
unneceflary to fay any thing  
more, than juft to obferve,  
that the refolutions of con-  
grefs, now alluded to, are as  
undoubtedly and abfolutely  
binding upon the united ftates,  
as the moft folemn acts of con-  
federation or legiflation.  
  
As to the idea, which, Iam  
informed, has, in fome inftan-  
ces, prevailed, that the half-  
pay and commutation are to  
be regarded merely in the  
odious light of a penfion, it  
B ought  
  
  
  
394  
ought to be exploded for ever.  
That provifion fhould be  
viewed, as it really was, a rea-  
fonable compenfation offered  
by congrefs, at a time when  
they had nothing elfe to give  
to the officers of the army,  
“for fervices then to be per-  
formed. It was the only means  
to prevent a total dereliction  
of the fervice. It was a pait of  
their hire. £ may be allowed  
to fay, it was the price of  
their blood, and of your inde-  
pendency. It is therefore more  
than a common debt. It is a  
debt of honour. [t can nevet  
be confidered as a penfion, of  
gratuity ; nor cancelled until  
it is fairly difcharged:  
  
With regard to the diftitic-  
tion between officers and fol-  
diers, it is fufficient that the  
uniform experience of every  
nation of the world, combined  
with our own, proves the uti-  
lity and propriety of the. dif-  
crimination. Rewards, in pro-  
portion to the aids the public  
draws from them, are unquef-  
tionably cue toall its fervants.  
In fome lines, the foldiers  
have perhaps generally had as  
ample compenfation for their  
feryices, by the large bounties  
which have been paid them,  
as their officers will receive in  
the propofed commutation :  
in others, if, befides the dona-  
tion of land, the payment of  
arrearages of clothing and wa-  
ges (in which articles all the  
component parts of the army  
muft be put on the fame foot-  
  
* Circular Letter of General Wafhington.  
  
ing), we take into the eftiniate  
the bounties many of the fol:  
diers have received, and the  
gratuity of one year’s full pay,  
which is promifed to all, pof-  
fibly their fituation (every cir-  
cumftance being duly confi-  
dered) will not be deemed lefs  
eligible than that of the of-  
ficers. Should a further re-  
ward, however, be judged  
equitable, I will venture to af-  
fert, no man will enjoy greater  
fatisfaction than myfelf, if an  
exemption from taxes for a li-  
mited time, (which has been  
petitioned for in fome inftan-  
ces), or any other adequate  
immunity or compenfation be  
granted to the brave defenders  
of their country’s caufe. Bur  
neither the adoption or rejec-  
tion of this propofition, will,  
in any manner, affect, much  
lefs militate againft, the act of  
congrefs, by which they have  
offered five years’ full pay, in  
lieu of the half-pay for life,  
which had been before pro-  
mifed to the officers of the  
army.  
  
Before I conclude the fub-  
ject of public juftice, I cannot  
omit to mention the obliga-  
tions this Country is under to  
that meritorious clafs of vete-  
rans, the non-commiffioned  
officers and privates, who have  
been difcharged for inability,  
in confequence of the refolu-  
tion of congrefs, of the 23d of  
April, 1782, on an annual  
penfion for life. Their pecu-  
liar fufferings, their fingular  
  
merit:  
  
  
  
Circular Letter oy General Wafiington.  
merits, and claims to that pro-.  
  
vifion, need only to be known,  
to intereft the feelings of hu-  
manity in their behalf. No-  
thing but a punctual payment  
of their allowance, can refcue  
them from the moft complica-  
ted mifery : and nothing could  
be a more melancholy and dif-  
treffing fight, than to behold  
thofe who have fhed their  
blood, or loft their limbs, in  
the fervice of their country,  
without a fhelter, without a  
friend, and without the means  
of obtaining any of the com-  
forts or neceflaries of life,  
compelled to beg their dail  
bread from door to door. Suf-  
fer me to recommend thofe of  
this defcription, belonging to  
your ftate, to the warmeft pa-  
tronage of your excellency  
and your legiflature.  
  
It is necefflary to fay but a  
few words on the third topic  
which. was propofed, and  
which regards particularly the  
defence of the republic---as  
there can be little dowbt -ut  
congrefs will recommend a pro-  
per peace eftablifliment for the  
united ftates, in which a due  
attention will be paid to the  
importance of placing the mi-  
litiaof the union, upon a regu-  
lar and refpectable footing; if  
this fhould be the cafe, I fhould  
beg leave to urge the great ad-  
vantage of it in the ftrongeft  
terms.  
  
The militia of this country  
muft be confidered as the pal-  
ladium of our fecurity, and the  
  
395  
firft effectual refort in cafe, of  
hoftility. Itis effential, there-  
fore, that the fame fyftem  
fhould pervade the whole; that  
the formation and difcipline  
of the militia of the continent,  
fhould be abfolutely uniform ;  
and that the fame {pecies of  
arms, accoutrements, and mi-  
litary apparatus, fhould be in-  
troduced in every part of the  
united ftates. No one, who has  
not learned it from experience,  
can conceive the difficulty,  
expence, and confufion, which  
refult from a contrary fyftem,  
or the vague arrangements  
which have hitherto prevailed.  
If, in treating of political  
points, a greater latitude than  
ufual, has been taken in the  
courfe of this addrefs,.the im-  
portance of the crifis, and the  
magnitude of the objects in  
difcuffion, muft be my apolo-  
gy. Itis, however, neither my  
wifh nor expectation, thar the  
preceding obfervations fhould  
claim any regard, except fo  
far as they fhall appear to be  
dictated by a good intention,  
confonant to the immutable  
rules of juftice, calculated to  
‘aegis a liberal fyftem of po-  
icy, and founded on whatever  
experience may have been ac-  
quired by a long and clofe at-  
tention to public’ bufinefs.  
Here I might fpeak with more  
confidence, from my a2tual ob-  
fervation: and, if it would not  
{well this letter (already too  
prolix) beyond the bounds I  
fad prefcribed myfelf, I could,  
demonftrate  
  
  
  
396 Circular Letter of General Wafhington.  
  
demonftrate to every mind,  
open to conviction, that in  
lefs time, and with much lefs  
expence than has been in-  
curred, the war might have  
been brought to the fame hap-  
py conclufion, if the refources  
of the continent could have  
been properly called forth ;  
that he diftreffes and difap-  
pointments which have very  
often occurred, have, in too  
many inftances, refulted more  
from a WANT OF ENERGY  
IN THE CONTINENTAL  
GOVERNMENT, than from  
a deficiency of means in the  
particular ftates ; that the in-  
efficacy of meafures, arifing  
from the want of an adequate  
authority in the fupreme pow-  
er, from a partial compliance  
with the requifitions of con-  
grefs, in fome of the ftates,  
and from a failure of punctu-  
ality in others, while they  
tended to damp the zeal of  
thofe who were more willin  
  
to exert themfelves, ferved alfo  
to accumulate the expences of  
the war, and to fruftrate the  
beft concerted plans ; and  
that the difcouragement oc-  
cafioned by the complicated  
difficulties and  embarraff-  
ments, in which our affairs  
were by this means involved,  
would have long ago produced  
the diffolution of any army,  
lefs patient, lefs virtuous, and  
lefs perfevering, than that  
which I have had the honour  
to command. But while I men-  
tion thofe things, which ar  
  
notorious facts, as the defects  
of our federal conftitution,  
particularly in the profecution  
of a war, I beg it may be under-  
ftood, that as [ have ever taken  
a pleafure in gratefully ac-  
knowledging the affiftance  
and fupport I have derived  
from every clafs of citizens,  
fo fhall I always be happy to  
do juftice to the unparalleled  
exertions of the individual  
ftates, on many interefting oc-  
cafions.  
  
I have thus freely difclofed  
what I wifhed to make known,  
before I furrendered up my  
public truft, to thofe who com-  
mitted it to me. The task is  
now accomplifhed. I now bid  
adieu to your excellency, ‘as  
the chief magiftrate of your  
ftate ; at the fame time, I bid  
a laft farewell to the cares of  
office, and all the employ-  
ments of public life.  
  
It remains, then, to be my  
final and only requeft, that  
your excellency will commu-  
nicate thefe fentiments to your  
legiflature, at their next meet-  
ing; and that they may be  
confidered as the legacy of  
one, who has ardently wifhed,  
on all occafions, to be ufeful  
to his country, and who, even  
in the fhade of retirement,  
will not fail to implore the  
divine benediction upon it.

The of America, placed in  
the inoll enviable condition, as the sole  
Lords and Proprietors of a vast trail of  
continent, comprehending all the vari­  
ous foils and climates of the world, and  
and abounding with all the neceflaries  
and conveniencies of life, are acknow­  
ledged to be poflefled of Absolute Free­  
dom and Independency.  
They are to be considered as adlors  
on a moll conspicuous theatre, which  
seems to be peculiarly deiigned by Di  
vine Providence for the display of hu­  
man felicity. Here they are not only  
surrounded with every thing that can  
contribute to the completion of private  
and domellic enjoyments ; but Heaven  
has crowned all its other blefiings by  
affording surer means for ftcuring per­  
manent political happiness, than any  
other nation has ever been favored with.  
Nothing can ilhrftrate these observations  
more forcibly than a recolledlion of the  
happy conjundlure of times and circum­  
(lances, under which our Republic as­  
sumed it» rank among the nations. The  
foundation was not laid in a gloomy  
ag;e of ignorance and fi&#x27;.perllition, but  
at a time when the Rights of Man were  
better uridei Hood, and more clearly de­  
fined, than at any former period. Re­  
fearehes of the human mind after social  
happiness have been carried to a great  
extent; the treasures of knowledge ac­  
quired by the labors of Philosophers,  
sages, and legislators, through a long  
fucceflion of years, are laid open for use,  
and their collcfted wisdom be hap­  
pily applied. The free cultivation of  
letters, the unbounded extenfiorrof com- i  
merce, the progressive refinement of  
manners, the growing liberality of sen­  
timent, and, above all, the pure and  
benign light of Revelation, have had a  
meliorating influence on mankind, and  
increased the blefiings of society.  
Such is our situation, and such are  
our profpedls ; but notwithstanding the  
cup of blelling is thus reached out to us  
—notwithstanding happiness is ours, if  
we seize the occasion, and make it our  
own—yet it appears to me there is an  
option still left to the United States of  
America, whether they will be refpefl­  
able and prosperous, or contemptible  
and miserable as a nation—this is the  
moment to establish or ruin their nation­  
al character forever—This is the favor­  
able moment to give such a tone to the  
&quot;Federal Government as will enable it to  
answer the end of its institution ; or,  
this may prove the ill fated moment for  
telaxing the powers of the Union, an­  
nihilating the cement of the constituti­  
on, and exposing us to become the sport  
of European politics, which may play  
one Hate against another, to prevent  
their growing importance, and to serve  
their own interelled purposes. For ac­  
cording to the system of policy of the  
Hates they will Hand or fall. By our  
success or failure it i» yet to be decided  
whether the Revolution mud ultimately  
be considered as a blessing or a curse;  
not to the present age alone, for with  
our fate will the deltiny of unborn mil­  
lions be involved

ir.g remarks, which wc think extremely

1 we recommend to the serious attention of  
thw lVa$hin((ton Jtencvolent Societies :  
“ It will be a part of my duty, aod that of  
evety true patriot, toassert,without reserve,  
and to hoist upon the following positions  
I That unless the States -will softer Coiigrcsl  
to exercise those prerogatives they ate un­

everything must very rapidly tend to d;i.  
urchy and confusion. That it is iudispen.

that there should be lodged, somewhere, a  
supreme power, to regulate ant! govern the  
general concerns of the confederated repub­

long duration. That there mu-t he a faith*  
ful and pointed compliance on the part of  
every state with the late proposals and de­  
mands of Congress, or the most fatal con­  
sequences will ensue. That whatever mta­  
•urea have a tendency to dissolve t/w union,  
0/ contribute to violate or letacn the sever,  
r/gvi authority, ought to be considered as  
hos&#x27;ile to the liberty and independency of A­  
merica, and the uuthora of them treated ac­  
cordingly. And lastly, that unless we can

to p^ncyafe of the fruits of the revolution,  
anti erajftthe essential benefits of civil socie­

for 110 purpose; that so n:u:ty sufferings  
fi-vc been encountered without a compensa­  
tion, and that so many sacrifices have been  
wade in vain. Many other considerations  
might here be adduced to prove, that with*  
out an entire conjormily to the spirit of the  
union, v.- car not exist as an independent  
power. It will be sufficient for my pur  
pose to mention but one or two, which seem  
to me of the greyest importance. It Uon­  
ly in our united character, as nn empire,  
that our independence is acknowledged, that  
our power can be regarded, or our credit  
supported among foreign nations. The trea­  
ties of (he European powers with th*e Uni  
ted States of America, will have no validity  
on Lite dissolution of the union. YVe shall

mu cDnueiivn .-i me importance ol the present  
crisis, silence in me would l&gt;c a crime; I will therefore  
speak lo your Excellency the language of freedom anil  
sinceriiy, without disguise. 1 am aware, however, those  
who.Idler fiom me in political sentiments may perhaps re.  
mark, I am stepping out of the proper line of my duty; ami  
they may possibly ascribe to airogance or ostentation,  
what I know is alone tha result of the purest intentions:  
but the rectitude of my own heart, which disdains such un­  
worthy motives; the part I have hitherto acted in life, the  
determination I have formed of not taking any share in  
public business hereafter, the ardent desire 1 feel anil shall  
continue to manifest, of quietly enjoying in piivate life,  
alter all the toils of war, the benefits ol a wise and liberal  
government, will, I flatter myscll sooner or later, convince  
my countrymen, that I could have no sinister tiews in de­  
livering, with so little reserve, the opinions contained in  
this Address  
There are four things w hich 1 humbly conceive arc es­  
sential to tbo well-being, I may even venture to say, lo  
the existence of the United States a* an Independent Pow­  
er.  
1st. An Indissoluble Union of the States under one fed­  
eral head, -r  
2&lt;lly. A sacred regard to public justice.  
3dly. The adoption ol a proper Peace Establishment  
And,  
“■Hilly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly dis­  
position among the people of the U. States, which will in­  
duce them to lorgct their local prejudices and politic.*, to  
make those mutual concessions which arc requisite lo the  
general prosperity, and, in some instances, to sacrifice  
their individual advantages to the interest of the commu­  
nity.  
“These are the pillars on which the glorious fabiic ol  
nur independence and national character must be support­  
ed. Liberty is the basis—and whoever would dare to sap  
the fountain, or overturn the structure, under whatever  
specious pretexts he may attempt it, will merit the bit­  
terest execration, and the severest punishment which can  
be inflicted by bis injure! country.  
“On the three fust articles I wall make a few observa­  
tions, leaving the last to the good sense and serious consi­  
deration ot tho»e immediately concerned.  
“Under llie first lua.l, although it may not be necessary  
or proper for me in this place to enter into a particular dis­  
quisition of the principles of the Union, and to take up the  
great question which lias been rroqtienlly agitated, whe­  
ther it he expedient and requisite lor the States to dele­  
gate a larger proportion of power to Congress or not; yet it  
will he a part of my duty, and that of every true Patriot,  
to assert, without reserve, and to insist upon tlic following  
positions: That unless the Stales will suffer Congress to  
exercise those prerogatives they arc undoubtedly invested  
with by the Constitution, every thing must very rapidly  
tend to anarchy and confusion; that it is indispensable lo  
the happiness of the individual States, that there should be  
lodged, somewhere, a supreme power, to regulate and go­  
vern the general concerns of the confederated Republic,

“ I hat there must lie a faithful and pointed compliance  
on the part of every Slate with the late proposals and de­  
mands of Congress, Dr the most fatal consequence* will  
ensue. That whatever measures have a tendency to  
dissolve the Union, or couliibntc to violate or lessen the  
sovereign authority, ought to be considered as hostile to  
tho liberty and Independency of America, and the au­  
thors ol them treated accordingly. And lastly, that un­  
less we can he enabled by the concurrence ol the Slates  
to participate ol the fruits ol the Revolution, and enjoy  
the essential benefits of civil society, under a form ol go­  
vernment so free and lincorrnpted, so happily guarded  
against the danger of oppression, as has been devised and  
adopted by the articles ofronfe.lerstion, it will be a subject  
of regret, tliat so niurli blood and Measure have been la­  
vished for no purpose ; that so many sufferings have been  
encountered without a compensation, and that so many sa­  
crifices have been made in vain. Many other considera­  
tions might here be adduced to prove, that without an en­  
tire conformity to the spirit ol the Union, we cannot exist  
as an Independent Power. It will he sufficient for m&gt;  
purpose to mention hut one or two, which seem to me of  
the greatest importance. It is only in our united charac­  
ter, as an empire, that our independence is acknowledged,  
that our power can be regarded or our credit supported  
among foreign nations. The Treaties of tho European  
Power*, with (he United .State* ol America, will have no  
| validity on a dissolution of the Union, tt&#x27;e shall he left  
nearly in a state ol nature; or we may find by our own  
unhappy oxpeiience, that there is a mturalaiid necessary  
progression from tho extreme of anarchy to the extreme  
of tyranny; and that arbitrary power is most easily esta­  
blished on the ruin* of liberty abused to licentiousness.’’

evils which followed trom the rejection of the  
revenue system of Congress. His observations  
were as follows: ‘*As to the second article,  
which respects the performance of public jus-  
tice, Congress have in their late address to the  
United States almost exhausted the subject.—  
They have explained their ideas so fully, and  
have enforced the obligations the states are un-  
der to render complete justice to all the public  
creditors, with so much dignity and energy,  
  
that in my opinion no real friend to the honor |  
  
and independency of America, can hesitate a sin-  
gle moment respecting the propriety of comply-  
ing with the just and honorable measures pro-  
posed. If their arguments do not produce con-  
viction, I know of nothing that will have great-  
  
er influence, especially when we recollect that |  
  
the system referred to, being the result of the  
collected wisdom of the continent, must be es-  
teemed, if not perfect, certainly the least objec-  
tionable of any that could be devised, and that  
if it shall not be carried into immediate execution,  
a national bankruptcy with all its deplorable con-  
sequences will take place, before any different  
plan can possibly be proposed or adopted. So  
  
pressing are the present circumstances, and |  
  
such is the alternative now offered to the states.

his farewell advice to his countrymen. “ Unless,” he says, “the states  
  
will suffer congress to exercise those prerogatives which they are i le  
edly vested with by the constitution, every thing must very rapidly tend  
to anarchy and confusion. It is indispe ‘nsable to the happiness of the *  
individual states that there should be lodged somewhere a supreme power  
to regulate and govern the general concerns of the confederated republic,  
without which the Union cannot be of long duration. There must be a  
faithful and pointed compliance on the part of every state with the late  
proposals and demands of congress, or the most fatal consequences will  
ensue. Whatever measures have a tendency to dissolve the Union, or  
contribute to violate or lessen the sovereign authority, ought to be con-  
sidered hostile to the liberty and independence of America, and the au-  
thors of them treated accordingly . And lastly, unless we can be enabied,  
by the concurrence of the states, to participate of the fruits of the revo-  
lution, and enjoy the essential benefits of civil society, under a form of  
government so free and uncorrupted, so happily guarded against the dan-  
ger of oppression, as has been devised by the articles of confederation, it

tered without compensation, and that so many sacrifices have been made  
in vain.”

army for service then to be performed. It was the onl  
means to prevent a total dereliction of the service. It was  
part of their hire. I may be allowed to say it was the pric

 question of  
State Rights, and Federal authority. This  
is not a new question; but one that was  
the subject of grave consideration, when our  
Federal Government was established. Gen.  
Washington, after his election to the Pres­  
idency, in his solicitude for the welfare of  
the country, issued a circular to the Gov-  
ernors of the several States, in which he  
presented his views at length. His was the  
hand that safely started the Ship of State  
on its carser, and we give below an extract  
from this circular, embracing these views.  
Speaking of the option of Government left  
to the United States, ho says:  
This is the time of their political pro-  
bation; this is the moment when the eyes  
of the whole world are turned upon them;  
this is the moment to establish or ruin their  
national character forever; this is the fav-  
orable moment to give such a tone to our  
federal government as will enable it to an-  
swer the ends of its institution, or this may  
be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the  
powers of the Union, annihilating the ce­  
ment of the confederation and exposing us  
to become the sport of European politics,  
which may play one State against another  
to prevent their growing importance, and  
to serve their own interested purposes. For,  
according to the system of policy the States  
shall adopt at this moment, they will stand  
or fall; for by their confirmation or lapse,  
it is yat to be decided whether the Revolu  
tion must ultimately be considered as a  
blessing or a curse--a blessing or a curse,  
not to the present age alone, for with our  
fate will the destiny of unborn millions be  
involved.  
&quot;There are four things which I humbly  
conceive are essential to the well-being, I  
may even venture to say to the existence of  
the United States as an independent power  
&quot;Ist. An indissoluble Union of the States  
under one federal hend.  
21. A sacred regard to public justice.  
&quot;3d. The adoption of a proper peace  
establishment; and  
&quot;1th. The prevalence of that pacific and  
friendly cisposition among the people of the  
United States, which will induce them to  
forgat their local prejudices and politics, to  
make these mutual concessions which are  
requisite to the general prosperity, and in  
some instances to sacrifice their individual  
advantages to the interests of the communt­  
ty  
&quot;These are the pillars on which the

At this auspicious period, tbe United States  
came into existence as a Nation, and if their cit­  
izens be not completely free and happy the fault  
will be entirely their own. Such is our situa­  
tion, and such are our prospects ; but notwith­  
standing the cup of blessing is thus reached out  
to us, notwithstanding happiness is ours, if we  
have a disposition to seize the occasion and make  
it our own, yet it appears to me there is an op­  
tion still left to the United States of America,  
whether they will still be respectable and pros­  
perous, or contemptible and miserable as a na­  
tion. Tbis is the time of their political proba­  
tion ; tbis is tbe moment when the eyes of tbe  
whole world are turned npon them : tbis is the  
moment to establish or ruin tbeir national char­  
acter forever; this is tbe favorable moment to  
give such a tone to tbe Federal Government as  
will enable it to answer the ends of its institu­  
tion ; or tbis may be the ill-fated moment for  
relaxing tbe powers of the Union, annihilating  
the cement of the Confederation, and exposing  
us to the sport of European politics, which may  
array one State against another, to prevent tbeir  
growing importance, and to serve their interest­  
ed purposes. For according to the system of  
policy the States shall adopt at tbis moment,  
tbey will stand or fall—and by tbeir confirma­  
tion or lapse, it is yet to be decided whether the  
Revolution must ultimately be considered a  
hies .rig or a curse—a blessing or a curse not to  
tbe present age alone, for with our fate will the  
destiny of unborn millions be involved.  
With tbis conviction of tbe importance of the  
present crisis, silence in me would be a crime;  
I will, therefore, speak to your Excel&#x27;ency the  
language of freedom and of sincerity, without  
disguise. ******  
There are four things which I humbly con­  
ceive are essential to the well being, I may ven­  
ture to say the existence of the United States as  
an independent power.  
Ist. An indissoluble union ot tbe States under  
one confederated bead.  
  
2nd. A sacred regard to public justice.  
3rd. The adoption of a proper peace estab­  
lishment.  
4th. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly  
disposition among the people of the United  
States, which will induce them to forget tbeir  
local prejudice., to make those mutnal conces­  
sions which are requisite to the general prosper­  
ity, and iv some instances to sacrifice their indi­  
vidual advantages to the interest of the commu­  
nity.  
These are the pillars on which tbe glorious  
fabric of our independency and national charac­  
ter mu.-t be supported. Liberty is tbe basis;  
and whoever wonld dare to sap the foundation,  
or overturn the structure, under whatever specious  
pretext he mag attempt it, will merit the bitter*  
est execration, and the severest punishment, which  
can be inflicted by his injured country. * *  
Yet it will be a part ot my duty, and that of  
every true patriot, to assert without reserve, and  
! to insist upon the following propositions:  
That, unless the States will suffer Congress to  
| exercise those prerogatives they are undoubtedly  
invested with by the Constitution, everything  
must very rapidly tend to anarchy an_ confusion.  
That it is indispensable to tbe happiness «4 the  
individnal States, that there should be lodged  
some where a supreme power to regulate and  
govern the general concerns of the confederated  
Republic, without which the Union cannot be of  
long duration.  
That there must be a faithful and pointed  
compliance on tbe part of every State with late  
proposals aud demands ot Congress, or the most  
j fatal consequences will ensue. That whatever  
j measures have a tendency to dissolve the Union,  
or contribute to violence, or lessen the sovereign  
authority, ought to be considered as hostile to the  
liberty and independence of America, and the  
authors of them treated accordingly. Aud lastly,  
that, unless we can be enabled by tbe concur­  
rence of tbe States to participate of the fruits of  
the Revolution, and enjoy tbe essential benefits  
of civil society, under a form of government so  
free and uncorrupted, so happily guarded against  
the danger of oppression, as has been advised  
and adopted by tbe articles of confederation, it  
will be a subject of regret that so much blood  
and treasure have been lavished to no purpose;  
that so many sufferings have been encountered  
without a compensation, and that so many sac­  
rifices have beeu made in vain. Many other  
considerations might here be adduced to prove  
that, without an entire conformity to the spirit  
of the Union, we cannot exist as an independent  
power. It will bo sufficient for my pnrpose to  
mention but one or two which seem to me of  
tbe greatest importance. It is only in our uni­  
ted character, as an empire, that our independ­  
ence is acknowledged, that our power can be  
regarded, or our credit supported, among foreign  
nations. The treaties of European powers with  
the United States ot America v.iil havo no va­  
lidity on a dissolution of tbe Union. We shall  
be left Dearly in a state of nature ; or we may  
find, by our own unhappy experience, that there  
is a natural and necessary progression from the  
extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny;  
and that arbitrary power is most easily estab­  
lished on the ruins of liberty abused to licen­  
tiousness.

&#x27;Sir: The great object for which t hnd  
the honor to hold an appointment in the  
. service of my country being accomplish­  
ed, I am now prepming to fesijm it into  
the hands of Congress, and return to that  
domestic retirement which, it is well  
&#x27; known, I left With greatest reluctance.  
, . . . The foundation of  
our empire was not laid in the gloomy  
age of ignorance and superstition, hut at  
an epoch when the rights of mankind  
Were better understood and more dourly  
than at any fornior period.  
At this axupicious period, the United  
blutes oatna into existence as a nation,  
and if their citizens be not completely  
free and happy the fault will be entirely  
their own. Such is our situation, and  
such are our prospects ; but notwithsUnd­  
ing the cup of blessing is thus reached  
n out to us, notwithstanding happiness is  
ours, if we have a disposition to seize the  
occasion and make it our own, yet it ap­  
pears to me there is an option still left to  
the United States of America, whether  
Ihey will still be respectable and prospe­  
rous, or contemptible and miserable as a  
nation. This is the time of their political  
probation; this is the moment when the  
eyes of the whole world are turned upon  
Ihcm; this is the moment to estublu.li or  
ruin their national character forever; this  
is favorable moment to givesuch a tone to  
the Federal Government as will enable it  
to answer the ends of its institution; or  
this niay.be the ill-fated moment for re­  
laxing the &#x27;powers of tho Union, unnihi­  
htting the cement of the confederation,  
and exposing us to the sport of Km opean  
politics, which may array one State against  
another, to prevent their growing impor­  
tance, and to serve their own interested  
purposes. For according to the system  
of policy tiie States shall adopt at this  
moment, they will stand or fall and by  
their confirmation or lapse, it is yet to be  
decided whether the revolution must ul­  
timately be considered a blessing or a  
curse a blcs-ing or a curse not to the  
present age alone, for with our fate will  
tho destiny of unborn millions be in­  
volved.With this conviction of the importance  
of the present crisis, silence in me would  
be a crime; I will, therefore, speak to  
your Excellency tho language of freedom  
and of sincerity, without disguise.  
&#x27;i&#x27;hero are four things which I humbly  
conceive are essential to the well being, I  
may venturo to sny the existence of tho  
United States as an independent power.  
1st. An indissoluble union of the.States  
Under ono confederated head.  
2d. A saored regard to publio justice  
3d. The adoption of a proper peace  
establishment.  
And 4th. The prevalenco of that pa­  
cilic and friendly disposition among the  
people of the United States, which will  
induce them to forget their local prejudi­  
ces, to make tliuse mutual concessions  
  
which are requisite to the general pros­  
perity, and in somo instances to snerifico  
their individual advantages to tho in­  
terest of the community.  
These are the pillars on which tho glo­  
rious fabric of our independency and na­  
tional character must be supported. Lib­  
erty is the basis; and whoever would  
daro to sap the foundation, or overturn  
the structure, under whatever specious  
pretext he may attempt it, will merit the  
bittgrest execration, and tho severest  
lunislitiic-nt, which can be inflicted by  
lis injured country. -

Vet it will be a purl of my duty, and  
that of every true patriot, to assort with­  
out reserve, and to insist upon the fol­  
lowing propositions:  
&quot;That, unless the States will suiter Con­  
gress to exercise those prerogatives they  
are undoubtedly invested with by the  
Constitution, every thing must very rapid­  
ly tend to anarchy and confusion. That  
it is indispensable to the happiness of the  
individual States, that there should be  
lodged somewhere a supreme power to  
regulate and govern the general concerns  
of the - confederated Kepublio, without  
which the Union oannot be of long du­  
ration.That there must be a faithful and point­  
ed compliance on the part of every State  
with late proposals and demands of Con­  
gress, or the most fatal consequences will  
- ensue. That whatever measures have a  
tendency to dissolve the Union, or con­  
tribute to violenoe, or lessen the sovereign  
authority, ought to be considered as hos­  
tile to the liberty and independency of  
America, and the authors of them treated  
accordingly. And lastly, that, unless we  
can bo enabled by the concurrence of the  
States to participate of the fruits of the  
revolution, and enjoy the essential bene­  
fits of civil society, undor a form of gov­  
ernment so free and uncorrupted, so hap­  
pily guarded against tho danger of op­  
pression, as has been advised and adopt­  
ed by the articles of confederation, it  
will be a subject of regret that so much  
blood and treasure have been lavished to  
no purpose; that so many sufferings have  
been, in countered without a compensa­  
tion, and that so many sacrifices hare  
been made in vain. - Many other consid­  
erations might here be adduced to prove,  
that, without an entire conformity to the  
Bpiritof theUuion, we cannot exist as  
an independent power. It will be suffi­  
cient for my purpose to mention but one  
or two which seem to me of the greatest  
importance. It is only in .our united  
character, as an empire, that our inde­  
pendence is acknowledged, that our pow­  
er can be regarded, or our credit support­  
ed, among foreign nations. . The treaties  
of European powers with the United  
States of America will have po validity  
on a dissolution of the Union. We shall  
be left nearly iu estate of nature; or we  
may find, by our own unhappy experience,  
that there la a natural and necessary pro­  
gression from the extreme of anarchy to  
the extreme of tyranny; and that arbi­  
trary power is most easily established on  
tho ruins of liberty abused to licentious­  
ness. &quot;&#x27; . ,.&quot;,-&quot;&#x27;-&#x27;.&quot; r ..  
If, after all, a spirit of disunion, or a  
, temper of obstinacy and perverseness  
should manifest itself in any of the  
States, if such an ungraoious disposition  
ahould attempt to frustrate all the happy  
effects that might be expected to now  
from the Union, that State alone  
which puts itself into opposition to the  
aggregate wisdom of the Continent, and  
follows -such mistaken and pernicious  
counsels, will be responsible for all the  
consequences. &quot; &#x27; &#x27;.&#x27;.. - &quot;u

excite a belief that there is a real difference of lo­

1783: , ,  
Sib: The great object for which I had  
the honor to hold an appointment in the ser­  
vice of my country being accomplished, I  
am now preparing to resign it into the hands  
; of Congress, and return to that domestio re  
tirement which, it is well known, I left with  
great reluctance.  
The foundation of our empire was not laid  
in the gloomy age of igaorauce and super?  
stition, but at an epoch when the rights of  
mankind were better understood and more  
clearly than at any former period.  
At thi auspicious period the United  
States came into existence as a nation, and  
if their citizens be not completely free and  
happy the fault will be entirely their owa.  
Such is our situation, and such are our  
prospects.  
But, notwithstanding the cup of blessing  
is thus reached out to us; notwithstanding  
happiness is ours, if we have the disposition  
; to seize tne occasion ana make  
it our own

There are lour things which I humblv  
4 . - a  
eonceive are essential to the well being, I  
may venture to say the existence, of the  
United States as an independent power.  
1. An indissoluble uniou of the titates un­  
der one confederated head.  
2. A sacred regard to public justice-  
3. The adop&#x27;ion of a proper peace estab­  
lishment.And 4i.h. The prevalence of that pacific  
and friendly disposition among the people of  
the United States which will induce them to  
j forget their local prejudices, to make those  
mutual concessions which are requisite to  
the genera prosperity, and in some instances  
to sacrifice their individual advantages to  
the interest of the community.  
These are the pillars on which the glori­  
ous fabric of our independency and nation­  
al character must be supported. Liberty  
is the basis; and whoever would dare to sap  
the foundation, or overturn the structure,  
under whatever pretext ho mav attempt it,  
will merit the bitterest execration and the j  
severest puuisumeai wnicu can Da inniciea  
by his injured country.  
Tet it will be a part of my duty, and that  
of every true patriot, to assert, without re­  
serve, and to insist npon the following prop­  
ositions:Tbat, unless the States will suffer Con­  
gress to exercise these prerogatives they are  
undoubtedly invested with by the Constitu­  
tion, everything must very rapidly tend to  
anarchy and confusion. That it is indispen­  
sable to the happiness of the individual  
States that there should be lodged  
where a supreme power to regulate and :  
govern the general concerns of the confede­  
rated Republic, without which the Union  
cannot be of long duration. That there  
must be a faithful and pointed compliance  
on the part of every State with late propo  
sals and demands of Congress, or tbe most  
fatal consequences will ensue. Tbat what­  
ever measures have a tendency to dissolve  
the Union, or contribute to violence, or less  
en the sovereign authority, ought to be con  
sidered as hostile to tbe liberty and indepen­  
dence of America, and the authors of them  
treated accordingly. And, lastly, that, un­  
less we can be enabled by the concurrence  
of the States to participate of the fruits of  
the revolution, and enjoy the essential bene­  
fits of civil society, under a form of govern­  
ment so free and nncorrupted, so happily  
guarded against the danger ot oppression,  
as has been advised and adopted by the ar-  
I tides of Confederation, it will be a subject

without compensation, and that ao many

Uaaj other considerations might here be  
adduced to prove that, without an entire  
conformity to the spirit of the Union, we  
cannot exist as an independent Power. It  
wOl be sufficient for my purpose to mention  
bat one or two which seem to me of the  
greatest importance. It is only in oar ani­  
tmA iWrtr. ma an e moire, that our inde-

A can be  
regarded, or our credit ; supported  
among foreign nations. The treaties of Eu­  
ropean Powers with the United States of  
America will have no validity on a dissolu  
tion of the Union. We shall be left nearly  
in  
a state of natare; or we may fiad, by our

natural and necessary progression from the  
extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyran­

At this auspiciou period, the United

if their citizens be not completely free snd

pectable and prosperous, or contemptible  
and miserable aa a nation. Thia ia the  
time of their political probation; thia is the  
moment whea the eyes of the whole world  
ere turned upon thm, thi is tbe moment  
to establish or ruin their national character  
forever; thia 1 a favorable moment te give

sincerity,&quot; Without disgiiiso.&#x27; -; &quot;&#x27;  
There are four things which I humbly  
eonoeive are essential to the well bting, I  
  
may venture to say the existence of the  
  
United Statee aa an independent power.  
  
1st. An indissoluble union ef the States

: 3d. The adoption of a proper peace ev  
tablishment. &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;  
  
And 4th. The prevalence of that paeifio  
and friendly disposition among the people  
  
of the United State, which will induce  
them to forget their local prejudice, to  
make those mutual concessions which ere  
  
some instsnceo tb sacrifice their individual  
  
advantage to the interest of tbe community.  
,. These are the pillars on which the glori-,  
  
oos fabrie of our independency and national  
character must be supported. Liberty is  
  
the basis; and whoever would dare te sap  
  
the foundation, or overturn- the structure,  
ander whatever speeieue . pretext he may  
  
attempt it, will merit the bitterest execra­  
tion and the eeereA punishment, which  
  
ean be inflicted by his injured country.  
  
Yet it will be a part of mj duty, and that

prepe.iUpn.?,;:. &quot; &#x27; V&#x27;S&#x27;l .  
  
That, unless the States will sufr Con?

are undoubtedly tnveeted with by, the Ca:  
tit ition, every thing must Try &#x27; rapidly,

that so many sacrifices have been made In  
vaia. Many other oensiderationa mighty  
here be adduced to prove, that, without ,an  
entire ceBfermily to the spirit of the Union,&#x27;

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot;SiR: The great object for which I  
had the honor to hold an appointment  
in the service of my country being ac­  
complished, I am now preparing to re­  
sign it into the hands of Congress, and  
return to that domestic retirement which,  
it is well known, I left with great re­  
luctance.   
The foundation of our empire was not  
laid in the gloomy age of ighorance and  
superstition, but at an epoch when the  
rights of mankind were better understood  
and more clearly than at any former  
period.   
At this auspicious period the United  
States came into existence as a nation,  
and if their citizens be not completely  
free and happy the fault will be entire­  
ly their own. Such is our situation, and  
such are our prospects.  
But notwithstanding the cup of bles­  
sing is thus reached out to us; notwith­  
standing happiness is ours; if we have  
a disposition to seize the occasion and  
make it our own, yet it appears to me  
there is an option still left to the Uni­  
ted States of America whether they will  
still be respectable and prosperous or  
contemptible and miserable as a  
nation. This is the time of their polit­  
ical probation; this the moment whon  
the eyes of the whole world are turned  
upon them; this is the moment to es-  
  
 ea a ite   
ai o on te aoa aae  
 forever; this is the fvorable moment to  
 give such a tone to the Federal Govern-  
 ment as will enable it to answer the  
end of its intitution, or this may be  
the ifated momentor relaning the  
 powers of the Union, annihilating the  
e cement of the Confederation, and e­  
 posing us to the sport of European pol­  
tics, which may array one State against  
another, to prevent thtir growing impor­  
tance and to serve their own interested  
 puroe or aoin o the ee  
eof policy the States shall adopt at this  
 moment they will stand or fall, and by  
 their confirmation and lapse, it is yet to  
e be decided whether the revolution must  
utimatey e conidered a besing or a  
 curse--a blessing or a curse not to the  
 present age alone, for with our fate will  
the destiny of unborn millions be involy­  
ed. With this conviction of the impor,  
tane o te een ciis siene in e  
 would be a crime. I will, therefore,  
speak to your Excellency the language  
of freedom and of sincerity, without dis­  
guise.     
There are four things which I hun­  
by conceive are essentia to the we be­  
ing. I may venture to say the existence,  
of the United States as an independent  
Power  
I. An indissoluble union of the States  
under one confederated head.  
. A sacred regard to public justice.  
 The adoption of a proper peace es­  
tablishment.  
d. The prevalence of that pacific and  
friendly disposition among the people of  
 the United States which will induce  
them to forget their local prejudices, to  
make those mutual concessions which  
are requisite to the general prosperity,  
 and in some instance to sacrifice their  
individual advantages to the interest of  
 the community.  
the ar the piar on whic the  
 glorious fabric of our independency and  
national character must be supported.  
Liberty is the basis; and whoever  
 would dare to sap the foundation, or  
 overturn the structure, under whatever  
specious pretext he may attempt it, will  
merit the bitterest execration and the  
severest punishment which can be in-  
flicted by his injured country.   
Yet it will be a part of my duty, and  
that of every true patriot, to assert with­  
 out reserve, and to insist upon the follow­  
ing propositions:  
That, unless the States will suffer Cor­  
 gress to exercise these prerogatives they  
are undoubtedly invested with by the Con­  
stitution, every thing must rapidly tend  
to anarchy and confusion. That it is in­  
dispensible to the happiness of the indi­  
vidual States that there should be lodged  
somewhere a supreme power to regulate and  
 govern the general concern of the con­  
federatod Republic, without which the  
Uuion cannot be of long duration. That  
there must be a faithful and pointed  
compliance on the part of every State  
with late proposals and demands of Con­  
gress or the most fatal consequences will  
ensue. That whatever micasures have a  
tendency to dissolve the Union, or contri­  
bute to violence, or lessen the sovereign  
authority, ought to be considered as hos­  
tile to the liberty and independence of  
America, and the authors of them treated  
accordingly. And, lastly, that, unless  
we can be enabled by the concurrence of  
the States to participate of the fruits of the  
revolution, and enjoy the essential  
benefits of civil society, under a  
form of government so free and  
uncurrupted so happily guarded against  
 the danger of opposition, as has been ad­  
vised and adopted by the Articles of Con­  
federation, it will be a subject of regard  
that so much blood and treasure have been  
lavished to no purpose, that so many suf­  
ferings have been encountered without a  
compensation, and that so many sacrifices  
have been in vain.  
Many other considerations might be  
here adduced to prove that without an  
entire conformity to the spirit of the n­  
ion, we cannot eaist as an independent  
Power.- It will be sufficient for my pure  
pöse to mention but one or two which seem  
to me of the greatest importance. It is  
only in our united character, as an eme  
pire, that our independence is acknow­  
edged, that our power can be regarded.  
and our credit supported among foreign na­  
tions. The treaties of European Powers  
with the United States of America will  
have no validity on a dissolution of the  
Union. We shall be left nearly in a  
state of nature; or we may find, by our  
own unhappy experience, that there is a  
natural and necessary progression from the  
extreme of anarchy to the extreme of ty­  
ranny; and that arbitary power is most  
easily established on the ruins of liberty  
abused to licentiousness.   
If, after all, a spirit of disunion or a  
temper of obstinacy and perverseness should  
manifest itself in any of the States, if such  
an ungracious disposition should attempt  
to frustrate all the happy effects that might  
be expected to flow from the Union,   
that State alone which puts itself into op­  
position to the aggregate wisdom of the  
continent and follows such mistaken and  
pernicious counsels will be responsible for  
all consequences.  
I hae thus frely lisclosed what I  
  
aNO 13  
  
wished to make known before I sutren­  
dered up my public trust to those who  
ieo e   i  
I now make it my earnest prayor that  
God wold have yon an the States over  
which you preside in His holy protection:  
a e o ini te e o te it­  
in o etite a sir o uorintien  
 and obedience to gorernment; to entertain  
a brotherly affaction and love for one an-  
othee, for their fellow citisens of the n  
ited States at large, and particularly for  
 their brethre who hav served in the  
field; and finally, that he would most  
graciously be pleased to dispose us all to  
 do justice, to love mercy, and to demean  
ourselves with that charity, humility and  
pacific temper of mind, which were the  
charateisti of the divie Auor of our  
e blessed religion. Without an humble in  
timation of these things we can never hope  
to be a happy nation.

Washington&#x27;s Political Maxims.  
THE FOCR PILLAHs oF inDErENDENCE.  
There are four things which, I humbly  
conceive, are essential to the well-being, I  
may even venture to say to the existence  
of the United States as an independent  
P&#x27;ower.  
First. An indissoluble Union of the  
States under one Federal Head.  
Second. A sacred regard to Public Jus­  
tie hird. The adoption of a proper Peace  
Establishment.  
Fourth. The prevalence of the practice  
and friendly disposition among the peo­  
ple of the United States, which will in­  
duce them to forget their local prejudices  
and politics; to make those national con­  
cessions which are requisite to the gen­  
eral prosperity; and, in some instances,  
to sacrifice their individual advantage  
to the interest of the community.  
These are the pillars on which the  
glorious fabric of our independence and  
national character must be supported.  
Liberty is the basis. And whoever  
would dare to sap the foundation, or  
overturn the structure, under whatever  
specious pretext he may attempt it, will  
merit the bitterest execrations and the  
severest punishment which can be in  
flicted by his injured country.  
Unless the States will suffer Congress  
to exercise those prerogatives they are  
undoubtedly invested with by the Con­  
stitution, everything must very rapidly  
tend to anarchy and confusion

Without swelling this list, let us close with an extract  
from the circular letter of the “ Father of our country,”  
dated June 8, 1783: “ The free cultivation of letters, the  
unbounded extension of commerce, the progressive refine-  
ment of manners, the growing liberality of sentiment, and  
above all, the pure and benign light of revelation, have  
had an ameliorating influence on mankind, and increased  
the blessings of society.  
  
“T now make my earnest prayer that God would have  
you and the State over which you preside, under His holy  
protection ; that He would incline the hearts of the citizens  
to cultivate the spirit of subordination and obedience to  
the government, to entertain a brotherly affection and love  
for one another, for their fellow-citizens of the United  
States at large, and particularly for their brethren who  
have served in the field; and finally, that he would be most  
graciously pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love  
mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humil-  
ity, and pacific temper of mind, which were the character-  
istics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion, and without  
an humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can  
never hope to be a happy nation.”

federation became glaringly appar­

er refused outright or neglected to  
pay into the treasury the sums ap-  
Dortioned to them, and some of  
them even failed to observe the  
treaties entered into by Congress.  
The credit of the nation was utterly  
prostrated, and statesmen every  
where saw signs of a speedydissolution-

remedy should be applied. Wash

a Gue attention will be paid to the importance of placing the

Several States  
The citizens of America, placed in the most  
enviable condition as the sole lords and pro  
prietors of a vast tract of continent, compre  
hending all the various soils and climates of  
the world, and abounding with all the neces­  
saries and conveniences of life, are now, by the  
late satisfactory pacification, acknowledged to  
be possossed of absolute freedom and inde  
pendency. Thoy are from this period to be  
considered as the actors on a most conspicuous  
thoatre, which sooms to be pecultarly designed  
by Providence for the display of human great  
ness and felicity. Here they are not only sur­  
rounded with everything that can contribute to  
the completion of private and domestic enjoy­  
ment, but Heaven has crowned all its other  
blessings by giving a surer opportunity for  
political happiness than any other nation  
has ever been favored with. Nothing can  
illustrate these observations more forcibly  
than the recollection of the happy conjuncture  
of times and circumstances under which our  
republic assumed its rank among the nations  
The foundation of our empire has not been  
laid in a gloomy age of ignorance and supersti­  
tion, but at an epocha when the rights of man­  
kind were better understood and more clearly  
defined than at any former period. Researches  
of the human mind after social happiness have  
been carried to a great extent; the treasures of  
knowledge, acquired by the labors of philoso­  
phers, sages, and legislators through a long  
succession of years, are laid open for use, and  
their collocted wisdom may be happily appifed  
in the establishment of our forms of govern­  
ment. The free cultivation of letters, the  
ment. The free cultivation of lotters, the un­  
bounded extension of commerce, the progres­  
sive refinement of manners, the growing liber.­  
ality of sentiment, and, above all, the pure and  
benign light of revelation, have had a meliorat  
ing influence on mankind and increased the  
blessings of society. At this auspicious pe­  
riod the United States came into existence as­  
a nation, and if their citizens should not be  
completely free and happy, the fault will be  
entiroly their own.

anniversary of the entry of the United States  
army under General Scott into the city of Mexico,  
and the vast territory added to the area of the  
United States by the treaty of Guadalupe  
Hidalgo, then a wilderness, now great States  
and Territories, it has occurred to me, old, gray,  
and battle-scarred in our country&#x27;s service, that  
it would not be out of place for you in your  
columns to quote these words of wisdom ad­  
dressed by General Washington in his &quot;Cir­  
cular Letter,&quot; headquarters, Newburgh, June  
18, 1783, to the Governors of the several States:  
There are four things which I humbly conceive are  
essential to the well being, I may even venture to say  
to the existonce, of the United States as an indepen­  
dent power.  
First- An indissoluble Union of the States under one  
Federal head.  
Secondly-A sacred regard to public justice.  
Thirdly-The adoption of a proper peace establish­  
ment; and  
Fourthly- The prevalence of that pacific and friend.  
  
ly disposition among the people of the United States  
which will induce them to forget their local preju-  
dices and politics, to make those mutual concessions  
which are requisite to the general prosperity, and in  
some instances to sacrifice their individual advan­  
tages to the interests of the community.  
These are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of  
our independence and national character must be  
supported. Liberty ts the basts, and whoever would  
dare to sap the foundation or overturn the strue­  
ture, under whatever specious pretext he may at­  
tempt it, will merit the bitterest execration and the  
severest punishment which can be inflicted by his  
infured country.  
The ability of the country to discharge the debts  
which have been incurred in its defence is not to be  
doubted. An inclination, I flatter myself, will not be  
wanting, the nath of duty is plain before us; honesty  
will be found, on every experiment, to be the best and  
only true poley. Let us, then, as a nation be just; let  
us fulfil the pubite contracts, which Congress had un­  
doubtedly a right to make for the purpose of carrying  
on the war, with the same good fatth we suppose our­  
scives bound to perform our private engagements.  
There is much more pregnant with wisdom.  
There was trouble in the land then. The word
