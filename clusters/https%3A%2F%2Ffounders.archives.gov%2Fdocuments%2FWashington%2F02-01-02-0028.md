ning French encroachments. “I have sometime ago heard of their Robberies &amp; Murders,” he wrote Pennsylvania governor James Hamilton, “&amp; if they are allow’d a peaceable Settlemt on the Ohio, I think the Consequence will be attend’d with the Ruin of our Trade with the Indians &amp; also in Time will be Destruction to all our Settlemts on the Continent; . . . And We further think it wou’d be absolutely necessary, for all the Colonies to join together,  
  
in raising a proper Force to prevent the French settling on the Lands of the Ohio.” Dinwiddie also lost no time in reporting French activities on the Ohio to the Board of Trade. On 16 June 1753 he transmitted the latest reports of the French advance: “I hope you will think it necessary to prevent the French taking Possession of the Lands on the Ohio, so Contiguous to Our Settlements, or indeed in my private Opinion they ought to be prevented making any Settlements to the Westward of Our present Possessions.” The crown’s reply to Dinwiddie on 28 Aug. transmitted through the earl of Holderness, secretary of state, instructed the governor to investigate further the reports of the French invasion and, “if You shall find, that any Number of Persons, whether Indians, or Europeans, shall presume to erect any Fort or Forts within the Limits of Our Province of Virginia, . . . You are to require of Them peaceably to depart, and not to persist in such unlawfull Proceedings, &amp; if, notwithstanding Your Admonitions, They do still endeavour to carry on any such unlawfull and unjustifiable Designs, We do hereby strictly charge, &amp; command You, to drive them off by Force of Arms.”

the whole Journey we met with nothing but one continued Series of cold wet Weather.” GW reached Belvoir on 11 Jan. 1754, “where I stop’d one Day to take necessary rest; and then set out for, &amp; arrived at Williamsburg, the 16th. &amp; waited upon His Honour the Governor with the Letter I had brought from the French Commandant, &amp; to give an Account of the Proceedures of my Journey.”

Governors Dinwiddie and Hamilton were  
informed of the expedition; so, too, the  
governor of Maryland. Scarcely had  
Miamis’ vanguard appeared at Presquisle,  
when Dinwiddie warned the home govern-  
ment of the danger, and urged, what he  
had before urged in vain on the Virginia  
assembly, the immediate building of forts

onthe Ohio. There came in reply a letter  
signed by the king, authorizing him to  
build the forts at the cost of the colony;  
and to repel force by force in case he was  
molested or obstructed. Moreover, the  
king wrote :  
  
If you shall find that any number of persons shall  
presume to erect’ any fort or forts within the limits  
of our province of Virginia, you are first to require  
of them peaceably to depart, and if, notwithstanding  
your admonitions, they do still endeavor to carry  
out any such unlawful and unjustifiable designs, we  
do hereby strictly charge and command you to drive  
them off by force of arms.*

quences will be attended with the ruin of  
our trade with the Indians, and also in  
time will be destructive to all our settle-

governor thought it would be absolutely  
necessary for all the colonies to join to-  
gether in raising a proper force to prevent  
the French settling on the lands of the  
Ohio; “in such case,” said he, “‘ we shall

this cannot be done immediately.”  
Hamilton, the governor of Pennsylva-

twenty-second of May, he said :
