Mount Vernon, July 15 1773.  
  
The subscriber, having obtained patents for upwards of 20,000 acres of land, on the Ohio and great Kanhawa, being part of 200,000 acres, granted by proclamation, in 1754, (10,000 of which are situated on the banks of the first mentioned river, between the mouths of the two Kanhawa’s; the remainder on the Great Kanhawa or New River, from the mouth, or near it, upwards in one continued survey) proposes to divide the same into any sized tenements that may be desired, and lease them upon moderate terms, allowing a reasonable number of years, rent free; provided that, within the space of two years from next October, three acres for every fifty contained in each lot, and proportionable for a lesser quantity, shall be cleared, fenced, and tilled, and that by or before the time limitted for the commencement of the first rent, five acres for every hundred, and proportionably, as above, shall be inclosed and laid down in good grass for meadow; and moreover that at least fifty good fruit trees, for every like quantity of land, shall be planted on the premises.  
Any persons inclinable to settle upon these lands, may be more fully informed of the terms, by applying to the subscriber, near Alexandria, in Virginia, or, in his absence, to Mr Lund Washington; and will do well in communicating their intentions before the 1st of October next, in order that a sufficient number of lots may be laid off to answer the demand.  
As these lands are among the first which have been surveyed, in the part of the country where they lie, it is almost needless to premise, that none can exceed them in luxuriency of soil, or convenience of situation; all of them lying upon the banks either of the Ohio, or Kanhawa, and abounding in fine fish and wild fowl of various kinds, as also in most excellent meadows, many of which (by the bountiful hand of nature) are in their present state almost fit for the scythe.  
From every part of these lands water carriage is now had to Fort-Pitt, by an easy communication, and from Fort-Pitt up the Monongahela to Red Stone, vessels of convenient burthen may, and do pass continually; from whence, by means of Cheat River, and other navigable branches of Monongahela, it is thought  
  
the portage to Patowmack may, and will be reduced within the compass of a few miles, to the great ease and convenience of the settlers, in transporting the produce of their lands to market; to which may be added that, as patents have now actually passed the seals, for the several tracts here offered to be leased, settlers on them may cultivate and enjoy the land in peace and safety, notwithstanding the unsettled councils, respecting a new colony on the Ohio; and as no right money is to be paid for these lands, and a quitrent of two shillings sterling a hundred, demandable some years hence only, it is highly presumable that they will always be held upon a more desirable footing, than where both these are laid on with a very heavy hand. It may not be amiss further to observe, that if the scheme for establishing a new government on the Ohio, in the manner talked of, should ever be effected, these must be among the most valuable lands in it, not only on account of the goodness of the soil, and the other advantages above enumerated, but from their contiguity to the seat of government, which more than probable will be fixed at the mouth of the Great Kanhawa.

‘¢Mount VERNON IN VIRGINIA, July 15, 1773-  
  
*‘The Subscriber having obtained Patents for  
upwards of TWENTY THOUSAND Acres of  
LAND, on the Okio and Great Kanhawa (Ten  
Thousand of which are situated on the banks of  
the first mentioned river, between the mouths of  
the two Kanhawas, and the remainder on the  
  
276  
  
STEAM FIRE-ENGINES AND THEIR INVENTOR.  
  
  
  
Great Kanhawa, or New River, from the mouth,  
or near it, upwards, in one continued survey) pro-  
poses to divide the same into any sized tenements  
that may be desired, and lease them upon mode-  
rate terms, allowing a reasonable number of years  
rent free, provided, within the space of two years  
from next October, three acres for every fifty con-  
tained in each lot, and proportionably for a lesser  
quantity, shall be cleared, fenced and tilled ; and  
that, by or before the time limited for the com-  
mencement of the first rent, five acres for every  
hundred, and proportionably as above, shall be  
enclosed and laid down in good grass for meadow;  
and moreover, that at least fifty good fruit trees  
for every like quantity of land shall be planted on  
the premises.  
  
‘* Any persons inclinable to settle on these  
lands may be more fully informed of the terms by  
applying to the subscriber, near A/exandria, or in  
his absence to Mr. LUND WASHINGTON ; and  
would do well in communicating their intentions  
before the 1st of October next, in order that a  
sufficient number of lots may be laid off to answer  
the demand.  
  
‘* As these lands are among the first which have  
been surveyed in the part of the country they lie  
in, it is almost needless to premise that none can  
exceed thetn in luxuriance of soil, or convenience  
of situation, all of them lying upon the banks  
either of the Ohio or Kanhawa, and abounding  
with fine fish and wild fowl of various kinds, as  
also in most excellent meadows, many of which  
(by the bountiful hand of nature) are, in their  
  
  
  
present state, almost fit for the scythe. From  
every part of these lands water carriage is now  
had to Fort Pitt, by an easy communication ; and  
from Fort Pitt, up the A/onongahela, to Redstone,  
vessels of convenient burthen may and do pass  
continually; from whence by means of Cheat  
iver, and other navigable branches of the Monon-  
gahela, it is thought the portage to Potowmack  
may, and will, be reduced within the compass of  
a few miles, to the great ease and convenience of  
the settlers in transporting the produce of their  
lands to market. To which may be added, that  
as patents have now actually passed the seals for  
the several tracts here offered to be leased, settlers  
on them may cultivate and enjoy the lands in  
peace and safety, notwithstanding the unsettled  
counsels respecting a new colony on the Ohio;  
and as no right money is to be paid for these lands,  
and quitrent of two shillings sterling a hundred  
demandable some years hence only, it is highly  
presumable that they will always be held upon a  
more desirable footing than where both these ave  
laid on with a very heavy hand. And it may not  
be amiss further to observe, that if the scheme for  
establishing a new government on the Ohio, in  
the manner talked of, should ever be effected,  
these must be among the most valuable lands in  
it, not only on account of the goodness of soil,  
and the other advantages above enumerated, but  
from their contiguity to the seat of government,  
which more than probable will be fixed at the  
mouth of the Great Kanhawa.  
‘*GEORGE WASHINGTON.”

As these lands are Htnong the first

to promise thai none can exceed tic ih

in order that a sufficient number of lots may be laid off to  
answer the demand.  
  
As these lands are among the first which have been sur-  
veyed in the part of the country they lie in, it is almost  
needless to premise that none can exceed them in luxuri-  
ance of soil, or convenience of situation, all of them lying  
upon the banks either of the Ohio or Kanawha, and abound-  
ing with fine fish and wild fowl of various kinds, as also in  
most excellent meadows, many of which (by the bountiful  
hand of nature) are, in their present state, almost fit for the  
scythe. From every part of these lands water carriage is  
now had to Fort Pitt, by an easy communication; and from  
Fort Pitt, up the Monongahela, to Redstone, vessels of con-  
venient burthen, may and do pass continually; from whence  
by means of Cheat River, and other navigable branches of  
the Monongahela, it is thought the portage to Potowmack  
niay, and will, be reduced within the compass of a few miles,  
to the great ease and convenience of the settlers in trans-  
porting the produce of their lands to market. To which  
may be added, that as patents have now actually passed the  
seals for the several tracts here offered to be leased, settlers  
on them may cultivate and enjoy the lands in peace and  
safety, notwithstanding the unsettled counsels respecting a  
new colony on the Ohio; and as no right money is to be  
paid for these lands, and quitrent of two shillings sterling  
a hundred, demandable some years hence only, it is highly  
presumable that they will always be held upon a more de-  
sirable footing than where both these are laid on with a  
very heavy hand. And it may not be amiss further to ob-  
serve, that if the scheme for establishing a new government  
on the Ohio, in the manner talked of, should ever be  
effected, these must be among the most valuable lands in  
it, not only on account of the goodness of soil, and the  
other advantages above enumerated, but from their con-  
tiguity to the seat of government, which more than probable  
will be fixed at the mouth of the Great Kanawha.

oa by proclamation, in 1754, (10,000 of which are situated on the

quantity, shall be cleared, fenced, and tilled, and that by or before the  
time limited for the commencement of the first rent, five acres for every  
hundred, and proportionably, as above, shall be enclosed and laid down  
in good grass for meadow; and moreover, that at least fifty good fruit  
  
trees, for every like quantity of land, shall be planted on the premises.  
“ Any person inclined to settle upon these lands, may be more fully  
informed of the terms, by applying to the subscriber, near Alexandria,  
in Virginia, or in his absence, to Mr. Lund Washington ; and will do  
well in communicating their intentions before the 1st of October next,  
in — that a sufficient number of lots may be laid off to answer the  
  
demand.  
  
“ As these lands are among the first which have been surveyed, in the  
part of the ot where they lie, it is almost needless to premise, that  
none can exceed them in luxuriency of soil, or convenience of situation ;  
all of them lying upon the banks either of the Ohio, or Kanhawa, and  
abounding in fine and wild fowl of various kinds, as also in most  
excellent meadows, many of which (by the beautiful hand of nature)  
are in their present state almost fit for the scythe.  
  
“From every part of these lands water is now had to Fort Pitt,  
  
  
  
  
  
Notes and Queries. 479  
  
by an easy communication, and from Fort Pitt up the Monongahela to  
Stone, vessels of convenient burthen may, and do pass continually ;  
from whence, by means of Cheat River, and other navigable branches  
of Monongahela, it is thought the portage to Patowmack may, and will  
be reduced within the compass of a few miles, to the great ease and con-  
venience of the settlers, in transporting the produce of their lands to  
market ; to which may be added that, as patents have now actually  
passed the seals, for the several tracts here offered to be leased, settlers  
on them may cultivate and enjoy the land in peace and safety, notwith-  
standing the unsettled councils, respecting a new colony on the Ohio;  
and as no right money is to be paid for these lands, and a quit rent of  
two shillings sterling a hundred, demandable some years hence only, it  
is presumable that they will always be held upon a more desirable foot-  
ing, than where both are laid on with a very heavy hand. It may not  
be amiss further to observe, that if the scheme for establishing a new  
a on the Ohio, in the manner talked of, should ever be ef-  
ected, these must be among the most valuable lands in it, not only on  
account of the goodness of the soil, and the other advantages above  
enumerated, but from their contiguity to the seat of government, which  
more than probable will be fixed at the mouth of the Great Kanhawa.  
“GEORGE WASHINGTON.”  
  
The above is printed on the upper part of a half-sheet of foolscap;  
the lines begin on the left and run up the sheet. Beneath this is the  
following, the lines running across the sheet and being in Washington’s  
well-known hand:  
  
“Note. For further explanation of the above Advertisement, and  
better understanding the terms on which these lands will be granted, the  
subscriber proposes  
  
“To give Leases for the term of Twenty-one years, or three Lives with  
proper Covenants for securing the Rights of each Party.  
  
“To allow an exemption of four years from payment of Rent under the  
provisos in the above printed advertizement (where no improvements  
are made) after which four pounds Sterling for every hundred acres  
contained in the Lease and proportionably for Lesser quantity to be  
demanded and paid in the Currency of the Country, at the exchange  
prevailing at the time of making such payment.  
  
“To erect within the space of Seven years from the date of the Lease,  
a decent dwelling House and good Barn fit for a common farmer; Plant  
Orchards of noon | fruit Trees in proportion to the quantity of Land Let;  
and for every Hundred Acres contained in the Tenement Improve at  
least five Acres into Meadow; which five Acres or the like quantity of

As these lands are among the first which have been  
surveyed in the part of the country they lie in, it is  
almost needless to promise that none can exceed  
them in luxurianceof soil or convenience of situation,  
all of them lying upon the banks either of the Ohio

fowl of various kinds, as also in most excellent  
meadows, many of which, (by the bountiful hand of  
nature) are, in their present state, almost fit for the

riage is now had to Fort Pitt, by an easy communica-

Redstone, vessels of convenient burthen may and do  
pass continually, from whence, by means of Cheat  
River, and other navigable branches of the Monon-  
gahela, it is thought the portage to Potowmack may,  
and will, be reduced within the compass of a few  
miles, to the greatest ease and convenience of the  
settlers in transporting the produce of their land to  
market. To which may be added, that as patents  
have now actually passed the seals for the several  
tracts here offered to be leased, settlers on them may  
cultivate and enjoy the lands in peace and safety,  
notwithstanding the unsettled counsels respecting a  
new colony on the Ohio; and as no sight money is to  
be paid for these lands, and quitrent of two shillings  
sterling a hundred, demandable some years hence  
only, it is highly presumable that they will always be  
held upon a more desirable footing than where both  
these are laid on with a very heavy hand. And it  
may not be amiss further to observe, that if the  
scheme for establishing a new government on the  
Ohio, in the manner talked of, should ever be  
effected, these must be among the most valuable lands  
in it, not only on account of the goodness of soil, and

ginia. July 15, 1773,&quot; advertises as follows:  
&quot;The subscriber, having obtained patents for  
  
upwards of 20,000 acres of land on tho Ohio  
and Great Kanawha, proposes to divldo tho  
  
same Into any sized tenements that may be  
desired, and lease them upon moderate  
terms.&quot; The following sentence shows that  
the language of the real estate agent was  
eloquently handled by the great Virginian:  
&#x27;&quot;It is almost needless to premise that none  
can exceed them (the lands) in luxuriance  
of soil or convenience of situation, all of  
them lying upon the banks eitherof the Ohio  
or Kanawha, and abounding with fine fish  
and wild fowl of various kinds, as also In  
most excellent meadows, many of which (by

i Moant Vernon, in Virginia, July 15,  
mi.  
The subscriber having obtained  
Patents for upwards of TWENTY  
r THOUSAND acres of LAND oa  
the Ohio and Great Kenhawa, (ten  
! thousand of which aro situated on  
the banks of the first-mentioned  
r river, between the mouths ol the  
i two Kenhawa a, and the remainder  
on the Great Kenhawa, or Few  
River, from the uiouth or near it up.  
I wards, in one continued survey) pro  
i poses to divide the same into any  
t fixed tenements that may be desired  
| and lease them upon moderate terms  
; allowing a reasonable number of  
1 years rent free, provided, within the  
- space ol two yearB from next Octo­  
ber, three acres for every filty con­  
&#x27; tained in such lot, and proportion­  
j ably for a lesser quantity, shall be  
cleared, fenced, and tilled; and that  
by or before the time limited, for  
&gt; the commencement of the first rent,  
five acres lor every hundred, and  
. proportionally, as above, shall be  
enclosed and laid down in good  
grass for meadows; and moreover,  
that at least fifty good fruit trees  
3 for everylike quantity of land, shall  
3 be planted on the Premises. Any  
. persons inclinable to settle on these  
* lands may bo more fully informed of  
r the terms by applying to the sub­  
’ scriber, near Alexandria, or in his  
t absence, to Mr. LUND WASH­  
i INGTON; and would do well in  
1 communicating their intontions bc­  
’ fore the 1st of October next, in  
j order that &#x27;a sufficient number of  
j lots may be laid off to answer the de­  
t mend.  
e As these lands are among the first  
which have been surveyed in the  
part of the country they lie in. it is  
almost needless to premise that  
none can exceed them in luxuriance  
r of soil, or convenience of situation,  
e all of them lying upon the banks el­  
* ther of the Ohio or Kenhawa, and  
* abounding with fish and wild fowl  
of various kinds, as also in most cx­  
jj ccllent meadows, many of which (by  
I the bountiful band of natuie) are in  
a their present state, almost fit for the  
scythe. From every psrt of these  
lands water carriage is now had to  
Fort Pitt, by an easy commuuica­  
e tion; and from Fort ’Pitt up the  
Monongahela, to Redetone, vessels of  
convenient burthen, may and do  
j pais continually; from whence, by  
means of Cheat River, and other  
K navigable branches of the Mononga­  
gshtla, it is thought the portage to  
rotowmack, m»y and will be reduc­  
^ ed within the compass of a few miles  
to the great esse and convenience of  
e the settlers in transporting the pto­  
1 duce of their lands to market.  
And it may not be amiss to fur­  
B ther observe, that if the scheme for  
establishing a new government on  
Ic the Ohio, in the manner talked of,  
■- should ever be affected, lucre mast  
be smoag the most valuable lands  
f in it, not only tu account of-the  
t goodness of the soil and the other  
advantages enumerated, but from  
e tbeir contiguity to the sea&#x27;, of gov­  
ernment, which more than probable,  
will be fixed the mouth of the  
&#x27; Great Kenhaioa.
