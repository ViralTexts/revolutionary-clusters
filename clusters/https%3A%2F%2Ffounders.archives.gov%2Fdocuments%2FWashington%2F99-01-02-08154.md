se the Law of nature, and of Nations, points to Retalliation, as the only measure which can in such cases give any degree of security that the practice shall not become  
general—Thirdly—because the Honorable the Continental Congress, did on the thirtyeth day of October one thousand seven hundred and seventy eight, resolve in the following words.  
&quot;We therefore, the Congress of the United States of America Do solemnly declare and proclaim, that ifour enemies presume to execute their threats, or persist in their present career of barbarity, we will take such  
exemplary vengeance as shall deter others from a like conduct—We appeal to that God who searcheth the heart of men, for the rectitude of our intentions: and in his holy presence, declare, that as we are not moved by any light, and hasty suggestions of  
anger, or revenge, so through every possible change of fortune, we will adhere to this our determination&quot;—Fourthly—Because the minds of the people are justly irritated, and if they have not compensation through a public channel, they may  
in vindicating themselves, open to view a  which humanity itself may shudder.
