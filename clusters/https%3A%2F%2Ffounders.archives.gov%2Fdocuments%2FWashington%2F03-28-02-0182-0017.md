 Ulto addressed to Major General Greene—and since, Your very obliging Letter of the 29th, for which I beg leave to return You my acknowledgements. I have written to Sir Henry Clinton in consequence of the former and requested him to make the desired communications. When these are received, they shall be transmitted.  
I have the honor to inclose Congress a Copy of the proceedings of a Board of General Officers (No. 1) in the case of Major André, Adjutant General to the British Army. This Officer was executed in pursuance of the opinion of the Board, on Monday the 2d Instant at 12 OClock, at our late Camp at Tappan. He acted with great candor, from the time he avowed himself after his capture, untill he was executed. Congress will perceive by a Copy of a Letter I received from him of the 1st Instant, that it was his desire to be shot, but the practice &amp; usage of war,  circumstanced as he was, were against the indulgence.

Their conduct merits our warmest esteem and I beg leave to add, that, I think, the public will do well to make them a handsome gratuity. They have prevented in all probability our suffering one of the severest strokes that could have been meditated against us. Their names are John paulding—David Williams and Isaac Van Wart.
