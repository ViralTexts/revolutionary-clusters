—The appointment of the Generals Washington and Lee, gives universal satisfaction. The people have the highest opinion of Lees abilities, but you know the continuation of the popular Breath, depends much upon favorable events.

I told him I should be very happy to see him there, and accordingly sent Mr. Thaxter to Cambridge with a card to him and Mr. Read Reed to dine with me. Mrs. Warren and her Son were to be with me.

Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine  
His Souls the Deity that lodges there.
