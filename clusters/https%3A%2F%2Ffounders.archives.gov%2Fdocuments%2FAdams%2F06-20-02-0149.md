 Febry. 3d. 1790  
To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States,  
  
The Memorial of the Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, the relief of free Negroes unlawfully held in bondage, &amp; the Improvement of the Condition of the African Race—  
Respectfully Sheweth,  
  
That from a regard for the happiness of Mankind an Association was formed several years since in this State by a number of her Citizens of various religious denominations for promoting the Abolition of Slavery &amp; for the relief of those unlawfully held in bondage. A just &amp; accurate Conception of the true Principles of liberty, as it spread through the land, produced accessions to their numbers, many friends to their Cause, &amp; a legislative Co-operation with their views, which, by the blessing of Divine Providence, have been successfully directed to the relieving from bondage a large number of their fellow Creatures of the African Race— They have also the Satisfaction to observe, that in consequence of that Spirit of Philanthropy &amp; genuine liberty which is generally diffusing its beneficial Influence, similar Institutions are gradually forming at home &amp; abroad.  
That mankind are all formed by the same Almighty being, alike objects of his Care &amp; equally designed for the Enjoyment of Happiness the Christian Religion teaches us to believe, &amp; the Political Creed of America fully coincides with the Position. Your Memorialists, particularly engaged in attending to the Distresses arising from Slavery, believe it their indispensible Duty to present this Subject to your notice— They have observed with great Satisfaction, that many important &amp; Salutary Powers are vested in you for “promoting the Welfare &amp; securing the blessings of liberty to the People of the United States.” And as they conceive, that these blessings ought rightfully to be administered, without distinction of Colour, to all descriptions of People, so they indulge themselves in the pleasing expectation, that nothing, which can be done for the relief of the unhappy objects of their care, will be either omitted or delayed—  
From a persuasion that equal liberty was originally the Portion, &amp; is still the Birthright of all Men, &amp; influenced by the strong ties of Humanity &amp; the Principles of their Institution, your Memorialists conceive themselves bound to use all justifiable endeavours to loosen the bands of Slavery and promote a general Enjoyment of the blessings of Freedom. Under these Impressions they earnestly intreat your serious attention to the Subject of Slavery, that you will be pleased to countenance the Restoration of liberty to those unhappy Men, who alone, in this land of Freedom, are degraded into perpetual Bondage, and who, amidst the general Joy of surrounding Freemen, are groaning in Servile Subjection, that you will devise means for removing this Inconsistency from the Character of the American People, that you will promote Mercy and Justice towards this distressed Race, &amp; that you will Step to the very verge of the Powers  
  
vested in you for discouraging every Species of Traffick in the Persons of our fellow Men.

But he signed another constitution, a few months  
after endorsing “the compact.” It was that of the  
“Pennsylvania Society for the abolition of slavery,”  
the preamble of which recognizes the doctrines  
which are maintained by abolitionists of the present  
day, and expresses the “incendiary” desire of dif-  
fusing them “wherever the evils of slavery exist.” Of  
this society Dr. Franklin was elected President, and ,  
Dr. Rush, Secretary. In 1790, this society present- |

Tho follow ing memorial of tho Pennsylvania  
Society for promoting tho Abolition of Slavery,  
ho relief of frco nogroos unlawfully held in  
&gt;ondage, and tho improvement of the condition  
if tho African race, was presented and read: ]  
Tho memorial respectfully showoth?  
That, from a regard for tho happiness of  
nankind, an association was formed several  
fears since, in this State, by a number of her  
ntizens, of various religious denominations, for  
promoting the abolition of Slavery, and for the  
relief of thoxo unlawfully held in bondage. A  
just and ueuto conception of the true principles  
of liberty, as it spread through tho land, pro.liistail  
a/imuiuinna hi FKaiv nnmKoru wflnu iVinniU  
  
to thoir cause, and a legislative co operation  
with their views, which, by the blessings of  
Divine l&#x27;rovidonco, have boon successfully directed  
to the relieving from bondago a large  
number of their fellow creatures of the African  
race. They have also the satisfaction to observe,  
that in consequence of that spirit of philanthropy  
and genuino liberty which is generally  
diffusing its beneficial influence, similiar  
institutions aro forming, at home and abroad.  
That mankind aro all formed by the same  
Almighty Being, aliko objects of bis care, and  
equally designed for the enjoyment of happiness,  
tho Christian religion teaches us to believe,  
and tho political creed of Americans  
fully coincides with the position. Your memorialists,  
particularly engaged in attending to  
tho distresses arising from Slavery, lielicvo it  
thoir indispensable duty to present this subject  
to your notice. They have observed, with real  
satisfaction, that many important and salutary  
powers are vested in you for 4&#x27; promoting the  
welfare and securing the blessings of liberty to  
tho people of the United States, &quot; and as they  
conceive that these blessings ought rightfully  
to be administered, without distinction of color,  
to all descriptions of people, so they indulge  
themselves in tho pleasing expectation that  
nothing can ho done for tho rcliof of the unhappy  
objects ol their care will be either omitted  
or delayed.  
From a persuasion that equal liberty was  
originally tno portion and is still the birthright  
of all men, and influenced by tho strong  
ties of humanity nnd the principles of their  
institution, your memorialists conceive themselves  
bound to use all justifiable endeavors to  
loosen the bands of Slavery, and promoto a  
general enjoyment of the blessings of freedom.  
Under these impressions, they earnestly entroal  
your serioas attention to tho subject of Slavery]  
that yon will lie pleased to countenance the  
restoration of liberty to those unhappy men  
who alone, in thin land of freedom, are degra  
ded into perpetual bondage, and who, ainidsl

said this remarkable document, &quot;particularly  
&quot;engaged in attending to the distresses arising  
&quot;Hrom Slavery, believe it their indispensable  
&quot;duty to present this subject to your notice.  
&quot;They have observed with real satisfaction that  
&quot;many important and salutary powers are  
&quot;vested in you for promoting the welfare of and  
securing the blessings of Liberty to the people  
of the United States; and as they conceive  
&quot;that these blessings ought rightfully to be ad-­  
&quot;ministered, without distinction of color, to  
all descriptions of people, so they indulge  
&quot;themselves in the pleasing auticipation that  
&quot;rothing which can be cone for the relief of  
&quot;the unhappy objects of their care will be  
either omitted or delayed. From a persuasion  
&quot;that equal liberty was originally the portion  
&quot;and is still the birthright of all men, and ine­  
&quot;fluenced by the strong ties of humanity, and  
the principles of the Constitution, your

&quot;justifiable endeavors to loosen the bonds of  
&quot;Slavery, and promote a general enjoyment of  
the blessings of Freedom. Under these im­

of liberty to these unhappy men who alone in

Memorial respectfully showeth; That  
from a regard for the happiness of man-

years since in this State, by a number of  
her citizens, of various religious denomi-  
nations, for promoting the Abolition of  
Slavery and for the relief of those un-  
lawfully held in bondage. A just and  
acute conception of the true principles of  
liberty, as it spread through the land,  
produced accessions to their numbers,  
many friends to their cause, and a legis-  
lative codperation with their views, which,  
by the blessing of Divine Providence,  
have been successfully directed to the re-  
lieving from bondage a large number of  
their fellow-creatures of the African race.  
They have also the satisfaction to ob-  
serve that, in consequence of that spirit  
of philanthropy and genuine liberty  
which is generally diffusing its beneficial  
influence, similar institutions are forming  
at home and abroad.
