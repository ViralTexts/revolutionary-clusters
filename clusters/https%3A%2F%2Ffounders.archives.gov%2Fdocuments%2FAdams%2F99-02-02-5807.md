“The Similitude between 1773 and 1774: and 1811 and 1812 is obvious. It is now said by the Tories that we were unanimous in 1774. Nothing can be further from the Truth. We were more divided in 74 than We are now. The Majorities in Congress in 74 on all the essential points and Principles of the Declaration of Rights, were, only one, two or three, Indeed all the great critical questions abought Men and Measures from 1774 to 1778 were decided by the vote of a Single State, and that Vote was often decided by a Single Individual. Jumble and Chaos as this Nation appears at this moment, I never knew it better United—It is always So. The History of this World is nothing else but a narration of Such divisions. The Stuarts abdicated or were turned out and William came in by one or two Votes. I was turned out by the Votes of S. Carolina, not fairly obtained. Jefferson came in by one Vote, after 37 Tryals between him and Burr. Our Expedition against Cape Breton and consequent Conquest of Louisburg in 1745 which gave Peace to the World was carried in our House of Representatives of Massachusetts, by one Single Vote. The Abolition of Old Tenor in 1750 was decided by one vote. What is more awful than all. The Trinity was  carried in a general Council by one Vote against a Quaternity: the Virgin M
