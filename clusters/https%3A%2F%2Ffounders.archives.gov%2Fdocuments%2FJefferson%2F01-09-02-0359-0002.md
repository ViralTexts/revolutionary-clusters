Art. 6. That the Vessels of either party loading within the ports or jurisdiction of the other may not be uselesly harrassed or detained, it is agreed that all examinations of goods required by the Laws shall be made before they are laden on board the vessel and that there shall be no examination after, nor shall the Vessel be searched at any time unless articles shall have been laden therein clandestinly and illegally in which case the person by whose order  they were carried on board, or who carried them without order, shall be liable to the laws of the land in which he is. But no other person shall be molested, nor shall any other goods nor the Vessel be seized or detained for that Cause.  
Art. 7. Each party shall endeavour by all the means in their power to protect and defend all the Vessels and other effects belonging to the subjects or the Citizens of the other, which shall be within the extent of their Jurisdiction by sea or by land; and shall use all their efforts to recover and cause to be restored to the right owners their Vessels and effects which shall be taken from them within the extent of their said Jurisdiction.  
Art. 8. The Vessels of the subjects or Citizens of either party coming on any coast belonging to the other  
  
N. 10me

N. 11  
  
nor to render an account of their Cargo.  
Art. 9th. When any Vessel of either party shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise damaged on the Coasts or within the dominions of the other, their respective subjects or Citizens shall receive, as well for themselves as for their Vessels and effects the same assistance which would be due to the Inhabitants of the Country where the Damage happens, and shall pay the same Charges and dues only as the said Inhabitants would be subject to pay in a like case and if the operations of repair shall require that the whole or any part of their Cargo be unladed, they shall pay no duties, Charges or fees, on the part which they shall relade and carry away. The ancient and barbarous right to wrecks of the sea shall be entirely abolished, with respect to the subjects or Citizens of the two Contracting Parties.

And where on the death of any person holding real estate within the limits of the one party such real estate would by the laws of the Land Descend on a Citizen or Subject of the other were he not disqualified by alienage, such subject or Citizen shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell the same and to withdraw the proceeds without molestation.  
Art. 11th. The most perfect freedom of Conscience and of worship is granted to the Citizens or subjects of either party within the jurisdiction of the other, without being liable to molestation in that respect for any cause other than an insult on the religion of others:

Moreover when the subjects or Citizens of the one party shall die within the jurisdiction of the other, their Bodies shall be buried in the usual burial grounds or other decent and suitable places, and shall be protected from Violation or disturbance.  
Art. 12th. If one of the contracting parties should be engaged in a War with any other power the free intercourse and commerce of the subjects or Citizens of the party remaining neuter with the belligerent powers shall not be interrupted. On the Contrary in that Case, as in full peace the vessels of the neutral Party, may navigate freely to and from the ports and on the Coasts of the belligerent Parties, free Vessels making free goods, insomuch that all things shall be judged free which shall be on board any vessel

In case any Vessel shall be so stopped for articles deemed contraband if the master will deliver out the goods supposed to be of contraband Nature, he shall be admitted to do it, and the Vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on her voiage nor shall any such articles be subject to be taken or delayed in any case if they be not in greater quantity than may be necessary for the use of the ships, or of the persons in it.

But if the said vessel be under convoy of one or more Vessels of War belonging to the neutral party, the simple declaration of the Officer commanding the Convoy that the said vessel belongs to the party of which he is, shall be considered as establishing the fact, and shall relieve both parties from the trouble of further examination.  
Art. 15th. And to prevent entirely all disorder and violence in such cases, it is stipulated, that when the vessels of the neutral  Party sailing without convoy, shall be met by any Vessel of War, public or private of the other party, such vessel of War shall not approach within Cannon shot of the said neutral Vessel, nor send more than two or three men in their boat on board the same to examine her sea-letters or pass-ports and all persons belonging to any vessel of War public or private who shall molest or injure in any manner whatever the people, vessels or effects of the other party shall be responsible in their persons and property for damages and interest, sufficient security for which shall be given by all Commanders of private armed Vessels before they are Commissioned.  
Art. 16th.

Art. 17. If any Vessel or effects of the neutral Power be taken by an Enemy of the other or by a pirate, and retaken by that other they shall be brought into some port of one of the parties and delivered into the Custody of the officers of that port in order to be restored entire to the true proprietor as soon as due proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.

N. 16  
  
which shall have made prizes on the subjects of His Most Christian Majesty the King of France shall have a right of assylum in the ports or havens of the said U. S. and if any such be forced therein by tempest or dangers of the sea, they shall be obliged to depart as soon as possible according to the tenor of the treaties existing between His said Most Christian Majesty and the said United States.]  
Art. 20th. No Citizen or Subject of either of the Contracting parties shall take from any power with which the other may be at War any Commission or Letter of Marque for arming any Vessell to act as a Privateer against the other on pain of being punished as a pirate, nor shall either party hire, Lend or give any part of their naval, or military force to the enemy of the other to aid them offensively or defensively against that other.  
Art. 21st. If the two contracting parties should be engaged in a War against a Common Enemy the following points shall be observed between them. 1st. If a Vessel of one of the parties retaken by a privateer of the Other shall not have been in possession of the Enemy more than twenty four hours, she shall be restored to the first owner, for one third of the Value of the vessel and Cargo, but if she shall have been more than twenty four hours in possession of the Enemy she shall belong wholly to the recaptors. 2d. If in the same case the recapture were by a public Vessel of War of the one party restitution shall be made to the owner for one thirtieth part of the Value of the Vessel and Cargo, if she shall not have been in possession of the Enemy more than twenty four hours; And one tenth of the said value where she shall have been longer: Which sums shall be destributed in gratuities to the recaptors. 3d. The restitution in the Cases aforesaid shall be after due proof of property and surety given for the parts to which the recaptors are entitled. 4th. The Vessels of War public and private of the two parties shall be reciprocally admitted with their prizes into the respective ports of each, but the said prizes shall not be discharged, nor sold there untill their legality shall have been decided according to the Laws and regulations of the state to which the Captor belongs. 5th. It shall be free to each party to make such regulations as they shall judge necessary for the Conduct of their respective Vessels of War public and private, relative to the vessels which they shall take and carrey into the ports of the two parties.  
  
  
Art. 22d. Where the parties shall have a common Enemy, or shall both be neutral, the Vessels   
  
N. 17  
  
of war of each shall upon all occasions take under their protection the Vessels of the other going the same Course, and shall defend such Vessels as long as they hold the same Course against all force and Violence in the same manner as they ought to protect and defend vessels belonging to the party of Which they are.  
Art 23d. If war should arise between the two contracting parties, the Merchants of either Country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect their debts   
  
N. 18  
  
and settle their affairs and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects, without molestation or hindrance: and all Women and Children, scholars of every faculty, cultivators of the Earth, artizans, Manufacturers and fishermen unarmed, and inhabiting unfortified Towns, Villages or places, and in general all others, whose occupations are for the common subsistance and benefit of Mankind shall be allowed to continue their respective employments, and shall not be molested in their persons, nor shall their houses or goods be burnt or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by the armed force of the Enemy into whose power by the events of war, they may happen to fall: but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price and all Merchant and trading Vessels employed in exchanging the products of different places and thereby rendering the necessaries, conveniencies and Comforts of human Life more easy to be obtained and more general, shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested, and neither of the contracting Powers shall grant or issue any Commission to any private armed Vessels empowering them to take or destroy such trading Vessels or interrupt such Commerce.  
Art. 24th. And to prevent the destruction of prisoners of War by sending them into distant and inclement Countries, or by crouding them into close and noxious places, the two contracting Parties solemnly pledge themselves to each other and to the World that they will not adopt any such practice. That neither will send the prisoners whom they may take from the other into the East Indies, or any other parts of Asia or africa: but that they shall be placed in some part of their dominions in Europe or America in wholesome situations, that they shall not be confined in dungeons, prison-ships, nor prisons, nor be put into Irons, nor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs, that the officers shall  be enlarged on their paroles within convenient districts and have comfortable Quarters and the Common Men be disposed in cantonments open and extensive enough for air and exercise, and lodged in barracks as roomly and good as are provided by the party in whose power they are for their own troops, that the officers shall also be daily furnished by the party in whose power they are with as many rations and of the same articles and Quality, as are allowed by them, either in kind or by commutation to officers of equal rank in their own Army, and all others shall be daily furnished by them with such ration as they allow to a common soldier in their own service, the Value whereof shall be paid by the other party on a mutual adjustment of accounts for the subsistance of prisoners at the close of the War, and the said accounts shall not be mingled with or sett off against any others nor the balances due on them be withheld as a satisfaction or reprisal for any other article or for any other cause real or pretended whatever, that each party shall be allowed to keep a Commissary of Prisoners of their own appointment with every seperate cantonment of prisoners in possession of the other, which Commissary shall see the Prisoners as often as he pleases, shall be allowed to receive and distribute whatever Comforts may be sent to them by their friends and shall be free to make his reports in open Letters to those who employ him. But if any officer shall break his parole, or any other Prisoner shall escape from the limits of his cantonment after they shall have been designated to him, such Individual officer or other prisoner shall forfeit so much of the benefit of this Article as provides for his enlargement on parole or cantonment. And it is declared that neither the pretence that War disolves all treaties, nor any other whatever shall be considered as annulling or suspending this and the next preceding article, but on the contrary that the state of War is precisely that for which they are provided, and during which they are to be as sacredly observed as the most acknowledged articles in the law of nature or Nations.  
Art. 25th. The two contracting parties grant to each other the liberty of having each in the ports of the other, Consuls, Vice Consuls, agents and Commissaries of their own appointment whose functions shall be regulated by particular agreement whenever either party shall chuse to make such appointment, but if any such Consuls shall exercise Commerce they shall be submitted to the same laws and usages to which the private Individuals of their nation are submitted in the same place.  
  
Art. 26. If either party shall hereafter grant to any other nation any particular favor in navigation or Commerce, it shall immediately become common to the other party, freely where it is freely granted to such other nation, or on yielding the compensation where such nation does the same.  
Art. 27th. Her Majesty the Queen of Portugal and the United States of America  
  
N. 19  
  
agree that this treaty shall be in force during the term ofyears from the exchange of ratifications and if the expiration of that term should happen during the course of a War between them then the articles before provided for the regulation of their Conduct during such a War shall continue in force untill the conclusion of the treaty which shall reestablish Peace and that this treaty shall be ratified on both sides and the

XXIV. And toprevent the deftruétion of prifoners of war, by fending them into  
diftant and ing@ement countries, or by crouding them into cloie and noxious places,  
the two contraéting parties folemnly pledge themfelves to each other, and to the  
world, that they willnot adopt any fuch praétice ; thatneither will fend the pri-  
foners, whom they may take from the other, into the Ealt Indies, or any other parts  
of Afiaor Africa; but that they fhall be placed in fome part of thet dominions  
in Europe or Ameviea, in wholefome fituations ; that they fha:l not be confined in  
dungeons, prifon-thips, nor prifons; nor be put into irons, nor bound, nor other-  
wife refrained in the ufe of their limbs; that the officers thall be enlarged on their  
paroles within convenient diftriéts, and have comfortable quarters ; and the com-  
mon men be difpofed in cantonments, open and extenfive enough for air and exer-  
cife, and lodged in barracks, as roomy and good as are provided by the party, in  
whofe power they are, for their own troops ; that the officers fhall alfo be daily  
furnithed by the party, in whofe power they are, with as many rations, and of  
the fame articles and quality, as are allowed by them, either in kind or by com.  
mutation, to officers of equal rank in their own army ; and ali others thall be daily  
furnithed by them with fuch rations as they allow to a common {oidier in their own  
fervice ; the value whereof fhall be paid by the other party, on mutual adjuftment  
of accounts, for the fubfittence of prifoners, at the clofe of the war: and the fai  
accounts fhall not be mingled with, or fet off againft, any others, nor the balances  
due on them, be withheld as a fatisfa&amp;tion or reprilal for any other article, or for  
any other caufe, real or pretended, whatever ; that each party fhail be allowed to  
keep acommiflary of prifoners of their own appointment, with every feparate can-  
tonment of prifoners, in poffeffion of the other: which commuiflary hall fee the pri-  
foners as often as he pleafes ; fhall be allowed to receive and diftribute whatever  
comforts may be fent to them by their friends ; and thall be free to make his re-  
ports in open letters to thofe who employ him: but if any officer fhall break his  
parole, or any ether prifoner fhall efcape from the limits of his cantonment, after  
they fhall have been defignated to him, fuch individual officer o other prifone:  
fhall forfeit fo much of the benefit ef this article, as provides tor his enlargement  
@n parole or cantonment. And it 1s declared, that neither the pretence, that war  
diffolves all treaties, nor any other whatever, fhali be confidered as annulling or  
fufpending this and the next preceding article; but on the contrary, that the ftate  
of war is precifely that for which they are provided, and during which they are  
to be as ficredly obferved, as the mo acknowledged articles in the law of nature or

confuls thal] exerciie commerce, they fhall be fubmuitted to the fame laws and u-  
ages, to which the private individuals of their nation are fubmitted in the fame

 which their Government  
was in duty bound to secure to them  
In more modern times the tendency of na­  
tions has been towards the discontinuance of  
this mode of warfare. The United States,  
from the foundation of the Governmnent, has  
acted persistently on the principle that pri­  
vate property should be exempt from cap­  
ture by armed vessels, and has lost no oppor­  
tunity to impress upon the nations with  
which it was in diplomatic intercourse the im­  
portance of prohibiting this mode of warfare  
by treaty stipulations. As early as 1785, in  
concluding a treaty with Prussia, it was stip­  
ulated that &quot;all merchant and trading vessels  
emyloyed in the exchange of the products of  
different places, and thereby rendering the ne­  
cessaries conveniences, and comforts of human  
life more easy to be obtained and more gene­  
ral, shall be allowed to pass free and unme­  
lested; and neither of the contracting powers  
shall grant or issue any commission to any  
private armed vessels, empowering them to  
take or destroy such trading vessels or inter­  
rupt such commerce.&quot; This stipulation was  
not renewed in the treaty of 1797. The treaty  
of the United States with the Netherlands in  
1782, France in 1788, England in 1794, Peru  
1799, Prussia 1795, and Spain 1735, contain  
provisions prohibiting the subjects of either  
power from taking letters of marque against  
the other from any power with which it is at  
war, under the penaly of being treated, if  
taken, as pirates.  
But notwithstanding these stipulations,  
the practice of the Government has always  
been to employ the services of privateers i
