It is thus evident, that the President as Commander in Chief, cannot employ these vessels, or the navy, in acts of war, previous to war being declared by the Congress; nor in acts of reprisals, short of war, for the same reason, Congress alone having the power to authorise the one or the other.  
As to the laws of the United States. By the “act providing a naval armament passed the 1st of July 1797. The President of the U.S. is empowered “should he deem it expedient to cause the Frigates United States, Constitution &amp; Constellation to be manned and employed” The same act authorises the President, if circumstances should hereafter arise, which in his opinion may render it expedient to increase the strength of the Revenue Cutters, so that the number of men employed, do not exceed 30 marines and seamen to each Cutter, and to cause the said Revenue Cutters, to be employed to defend the sea coast, and repel any hostility to their vessels and commerce within their jurisdiction.”  
The act providing an additional armament for the further protection of the trade of the U.S. and for other purposes, passed the 27th of April 1798 is silent even on the subject of employing the vessels.  
From the foregoing laws, the President cannot derive authority to do more than employ the ships as convoys, nor extend the instruction to their
