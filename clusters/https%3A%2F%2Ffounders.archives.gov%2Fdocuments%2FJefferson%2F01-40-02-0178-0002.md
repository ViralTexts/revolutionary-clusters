Syllabus of an Estimate of the merit of the doctrines of Jesus, compared with those of others.  
  
  
  
In a comparative view of the Ethics of the enlightened nations of antiquity, of the Jews, and of Jesus, no notice should be taken of the corruptions of reason, among the antients, to wit, the idolatry &amp; superstition of their vulgar, Nor of the corruptions of Christianity by the over learned among it’s professors.  
  
  
  
Let a just view be taken of the moral principles inculcated by the most esteemed of the sects of antt. philosophy, or of their individuals; particularly Pythagoras, Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero, Epictetus, Seneca, Antoninus.  
  
  
I. Philosophers.  
1. Their precepts related chiefly to ourselves, and the government of those passions which, unrestrained, would disturb our tranquility of mind.  
*To explain, I will exhibit the heads of Seneca’s &amp; Cicero’s philosophical works, the most extensive of any we have recieved from the antients. of 10. heads in Seneca, 7. relate to ourselves, to wit, de irâ, Consolatio, de tranquilitate, de constantiâ sapientis, de otio sapientis, de vitâ beatâ, de brevitate vitae. 2. relate to others, de clementia, de beneficiis. &amp; 1. relates to the government of the world, de providentiâ.   of 11. tracts of Cicero, 5 respect ourselves, viz. de finibus, Tusculana, Academica, Paradoxa, de Senectute. 1. de officiis, partly to ourselves, partly to others. 1. de amicitiâ, relates to o

nis.  
in this branch of Philosophy they were really great.  
  
  
  
2. In developing our duties to others, they were short and defective. they embraced indeed the circles of kindred &amp; friends; and inculcated patriotism, or the love of our country in the aggregate, as a primary obligation: towards our neighbors &amp; countrymen, they taught justice, but scarcely viewed them as within the circle of benevolence. still less have they inculcated peace, charity, &amp; love to our fellow men, or embraced, with benevolence, the whole family of mankind.  
  
  
II. Jews.  
1. Their system was Deism, that is, the belief of one only god. but their ideas of him, &amp; of his attributes, were degrading &amp; injurious.  
  
  
  
  
2. their Ethics were not only imperfect, but often irreconcileable with the sound dictates of reason &amp; morality, as they respect intercourse with those around us: &amp; repulsive, &amp; anti-social, as respecting other nations. they needed reformation therefore in an eminent degree.  
  
  
III. Jesus.  
In this state of things among the Jews, Jesus appeared.  
his parentage was obscure, his condition poor, his education null, his natural endowments great, his life correct &amp; innocent; he was meek, benevolent, patient, firm, disinterested, &amp; of the sublimest eloquence.  
  
  
  
The disadvantages under which his doctrines appear are remarkeable.  
  
  
  
  
  
1. like Socrates &amp; Epictetus, he wrote nothing himself.  
  
  
  
  
2. but he had not, like them, a Xenophon or an Arrian to write for him. on the contrary, all the learned of his country, entrenched in it’s power &amp; riches, were opposed to him, lest his labours should undermine their advantages: and the committing to writing his life &amp; doctrines, fell on the most unlettered, &amp; ignorant of men: who wrote too from memory, &amp; not till long after the transactions had passed.  
  
  
  
  
3. according to the ordinary fate of those who attempt to enlighten and reform mankind, he fell an early victim to the jealousy &amp; combination of the altar and the throne; at about 33. years of age, his reason having not yet attained the maximum of it’s energy, nor the course of his preaching, which was but of about 3. years, presented occasions for developing a compleat system of morals.  
  
  
  
  
4. Hence the doctrines which he really delivered were defective as a whole. and fragments only of what he did deliver have come to us, mutilated, mistated, &amp; often unintelligible.  
  
  
  
  
5. they have been still more disfigured by the corruptions of schismatising followers, who have found an interest in sophisticating &amp; perverting the simple doctrines he taught, by engrafting on them the mysticisms of a Graecian Sophist, frittering them into subtleties, &amp; obscuring them with jargon, until they have caused good men to reject the whole in disgust, &amp; to view Jesus himself as an impostor.  
  
  
  
Notwithstanding these disadvantages, a system of morals is presented to us, which, if filled up in the true style and spirit of the rich fragments he left us, would be the most perfect and sublime that has ever been taught by man.  
  
  
  
The question of his being a member of the god-head, or in direct communication with it, claimed for him by some of his followers, and denied by others, is foreign to the present view, which is merely an estimate of the intrinsic merit of his doctrines.  
  
  
  
  
1. He corrected the Deism of the Jews, confirming them in their belief of one only god, and giving them juster notions of his attributes and government.  
  
  
  
2. His moral doctrines relating to kindred &amp; friends were more pure &amp; perfect, than those of the most correct of the philosophers, and greatly more so than those of the Jews.  
  
  
  
and they went far beyond both in inculcating universal philanthropy, not only to kindred and friends, to neighbors and countrymen, but to all mankind, gathering all into one family, under the bonds of love, charity, peace, common wants, and common aids. a developement of this head will evince the peculiar superiority of the system of Jesus over all others.  
  
  
  
3. the precepts of Philosophy, &amp; of the Hebrew code, laid hold of actions only. he pushed his scrutinies into the heart of man; erected his tribunal in the region of his thoughts, and purified the waters at the fountain head.  
  
  
  
4. he taught, emphatically, the doctrine of a future state: which was either doubted or disbelieved by the Jews: and wielded it with efficacy, as an important incentive, supplementary to the other motives to moral conduct

disinterested, and of the sublimest  
eloquence.  
  
he disadvantages under which his  
doctrine appear are remarkable,  
  
1. Like Socrates and Epictetus he  
wrote nothing himself.  
  
2. But he had not like them a  
Xenophon or Arrian to write for  
him. On the contrary, all the learned  
of his country, entrenched in. its  
power and riches, were op dl to  
him, lest his labours should under-  
mine their advantages. And the com-  
mitting to writing his life and doc-.  
trines fell on the most unlettered and  
ignorant of men, who wrote too from  
memory, and not till long after the,  
transactions had passed.  
  
3. According to the. ordinary. fate  
of those, who attempt to enlighten  
and reform mankind, he fell an early  
victim to the jealousy and combination  
of the altar and the throne at about  
thirty-three years of age, his reason  
having not yet attained the maximum:  
of its energy; mor the course of his  
preaching, which was but of about  
three years, presented occasions of  
developing a complete system of moral,  
duties. ,  
  
4. Hence the doctrines, which he  
really delivered, were defective as a  
whole, and fragments only of what he  
did deliver, have come to us, muti-  
lated, misstated, and often unintel-  
ligible.  
  
5. They have been still more. dis-+.  
figured by the corruptions of sehigma;, ,  
tising followers, who have founds amy.  
interest in sophisticating and. pervert. -  
ing the simple doctrines he taught, by  
engrafting on them the mysticisms of  
a Grecian sophist, frittering them,  
into subtleties, and obscuring, them.  
with jargon, until they have caused;  
good men to reject the whole in dis-.  
ust, and to view Jesus himself as an-  
impostor. div  
  
Notwithstanding these disadvan-.  
tages, a system of morals is presented,  
to us, which, if filled up in the true.  
style and spirit of the rich fragmepts  
he left us, would be the most perfect  
and sublime that has ever been taught  
by man.  
“The question of his being a mem~  
bet of the Godhead, or, in direct com-  
munication with it, claimed for him  
by some of his followers, and denied  
by others, is foreign to the. present  
view, which is a estimate of  
the intrinsic merit of his doctrines. +»

“II. Jews. 1. Their system was Deism;  
that is, the belief in one only God. ‘But  
their ideas of him and of his attributes  
were degrading and injurious. 2. Their  
Ethics were not only imperfect, but often  
irreconcilable with the sound dictates of  
reason and morality, as they respect in-  
tercourse with those around us; and re-  
pulsive and anti-social, as respecting other  
nations. They needed reformation, there-  
fore, in an eminent degree.  
  
“Til. Jesus. In this state of things  
among the Jews, Jesus appeared. His  
parentage was obsure; his condition poor;  
his education null; his natural endow-  
ments great; his life correct and inno-  
cent; he was meek, benevolent, patient,  
firm, disinterested, and of the sublimest  
eloquence.  
  
“The disadvantages under which his  
doctrines appear are remarkable. 1. Like  
Socrates and Epictetus, he wrote nothing  
himself. 2. But he had not, like them, a  
Xenephon or an Arrian to write for him.  
I name not Plato, who only used the name  
of Socrates to cover the whimsies of his  
own brain. On the contrary, all the learn-  
ed of his country, entrenched in its power  
and riches, were opposed to him, lest his  
labours should undermine their advan-  
tages; and the committing to writing his  
life and doctrines fell on unlettered and  
ignorant men; who wrote, too, from me-

early victim to the jealousy and combina-  
tion of the altar and the throne, at about  
thirty-three years of age, his reason hav-  
ing not yet attained the maximum of its  
energy, nor the course of his preaching,  
which was but of three years at most, pre-  
sented occasions for developing a com-  
plete system of morals. 4. Hence the  
doctrines which he really delivered were  
defective as a whole, and fragments only  
of what he did deliver have come to us,  
mutilated, misstated, and often unintelligi-  
ble. 5. They have been still more disfi-  
gured by the corruptions of schismatising  
followers, who have found an interest in  
  
sophisticating and perverting the simple *  
  
doctrines he taught, by engrafting on  
them the mysticisms of a Grecian sophist,  
frittering them into subleties, and obscur-  
ing them with jargon, until they have  
caused good men to reject the whole in  
disgust, and to view Jesus himself as an  
impostor.  
  
“ Notwithstanding these disadvantages,  
a system of morals is presented to us,  
which, if filled up in the style and spirit  
of the rich fragments he left us, would be  
the most perfect and sublime that has ever  
been taught by man.  
  
“The question of his being a member  
of the God-head, or in direct communica-  
tion with it, claimed for him by some of  
his followers, and denied by others, is fo-  
reign to the present view; which is mere-  
ly an estimate of the intrinsick merit of  
his doctrines. 1, He corrected the Deism  
of the Jews, confirming them in their be  
lief of one only God, and giving the juster  
notions of his attributes and government.  
2. His moral doctrines, relating to kindred  
and friends, were more pure and perfect  
  
than those of the most correct of the phi-.  
  
losophers, and greatly more so than those  
of the Jews; and they went far beyond  
both, in inculcating universal philanthro-  
py, not only to kindred and friends, to  
neighbours and: countrymen, but to all  
mankind, gathering all into one family,  
under the bonds of love, charity, peace,  
common wants and common aids. A de-  
velopment of this head will evince the pe-  
culiar superiority of the system of Jesus  
over all others. S. The precepts of phi-  
psophy, and of the ikeew code, laid  
hold of actions only. He pushed his scru-  
tinies into the heart of man; erected his  
tribunal in the region of his thoughts, and  
purified the waters at the fountain head.  
4. He taught, emphatically, the doctrines  
ofa future state, which was either doubt-  
ed, or dishelieved by the Jews: and wield-  
ed it with efficacy, as an important incen-  
tive, supplementary to the other motives

terval of public cares he was in the habit of hav-  
ing with his friend, Doct. Rush on moral and  
philosophical subjects, he promised to give him  
in writing, his views of the christian religion. In  
accomplishing this, he formed in his mind a  
comparison of christianity with the ethics of the  
most celebrated philosophers of antiquity. The  
appearance some time after of Dr. Priestley’s  
treatise of “Socrates and Jesus compared,” which

‘Syllabus of an estimate of the Merit of the  
@octrines of&quot; Jesus;, compared with those of  
others, by Thomas Jefferson.  
In a comparative view of the Ethics-of the  
enlightened nations of antiquity, of the Jews,  
and of Jesus, no notice should be taken of  
the corruptions of reason among the ancients,  
to evil, the idolatry and superstition of the  
vulgar, nor of the corruptions of christianity  
by the learned among its professors.  
Let a just view be taken of the moral prin­  
ciples inculcated by the most esteemed of  
the sects of ancient philosophy, or of their  
individnals ; particularly, Pythagoras, Socra­  
tes, Epicurus, Cicero, Epictetus, Seneca,  
Antonius.  
  
L. Philosophers. 1. their precepts related  
chiefly to ourselves, and the government of  
those passions which, unrestrained, would  
disturb our tranquility of mind. In this‘  
branch of philosophy they were really great.  
2. In developing our duties to others, they  
were short and defective. They embraced,  
indeed, the circles of kindred and friends,  
and inculeated patriotism, or the love of our  
country in the aggregate, as a primary obli­  
gation ; towards cur neighbor and country­  
men they taught justice, but scarcely viewed  
them as within the eircle of benevolence.—  
Still less have they inculcated peace, charity,  
and love to our fellow men, or embraced  
with benevolence the whole family of man­  
kind.  
  
11. Jews. 1. Their system was Deism ;  
that is, the belief in one only God. But their  
ideas of him and of his attributes were de­  
gradir&#x27;xlg and Injurious.  
2. Their Ethics were not only imperfect,  
but often irreconcilable with the sound dic­  
tates of reason and morality, as they respect  
‘intercourse with those around us; and repul­  
sive and anti-social, as respecting other na­  
tions. They needed reformation, therefore,  
in an eminent degree.  
IH. Jesus. In this state of things among  
the Jews, Jesus appeared. His parentage  
was obscure ; his condition poor ; his educa­  
tion null ; his natural endowments great ; his  
life correct and innocent, he was meek, be­  
nevolent, patient, firm, disinterested, and of  
the sublimest eloquence. }  
The disadvantages under which his doc­  
trine appear are remarkable.  
1. Like Socrates and Epictetus, he wrote  
nothing himself. .  
2. But he had not, like them, Xenophon  
or an Arrian to write for him. I name not  
Plato, who only used the name of Socrates  
to cover the wiimsies of his own brain. On  
the contrary, all the learned of his country,  
entrenched in its power and riches, were op­  
posed to him, lest his labors should under­  
mine their advantages ; and the committing  
to writing his life and doctrines fell on unlet­  
tered and ignerant men ; who wrote, too,  
from memory, and not till long after the  
transactions had passed. Y T  
.- 8. According to the ordinary fate of those  
&#x27;who attempt to enlighten and reform man­  
kind, he feﬁ an ealr% victim to the jealousy  
and combination of t{leval;ar and the throne,  
at about thirty-three years of age, his reason  
having not .{let attained the maximum of ‘its?!  
cmtiy,nor,t e course of his preaching, which {  
was but three years at most, presented occa­  
sion for, deniopmg’:g comp‘iﬁ;e‘ system of  
s i  
4; Hence the doctrines which he.really de­  
livered were defective as a whole, andl frag­  
ments only of what he did deliver have come  
  
to us, mutilated, misstated, and often umin­  
elligible. sl s  
5. They have been still more disfigured by  
the corruptions of schismatizing followers,  
who have found an‘imterest in sophisticating  
and perverting thesimple doctrineshe taught,  
by engrafting on them the mysticisins of a  
Grecian sophist,frittering them into subtleties,  
and obscuring them with jargon, until they  
have caused good-men to reject the whole in  
disgust, and to view Jesus himself as an im­  
poster.  
Notwithstanding these - disadvantages, a  
system of morals is presented to us, which,  
if filled up in the style and spirit of the.rich  
fragriients he left us, - would be the most per­  
fect and sublime that has ever been taught  
by man. : T :  
  
The question of his being a member of the  
God-head,or in direct communication with it,  
claimed for him by some of his followers, and  
denied by others, is foreign to the present  
view, which is mainly an estimate of the in­  
trinsic merit of Bis doctrines.. -  
1. He corrected the Deism of the Jews,  
confining them in their beliet of&#x27; ome only God,

pushed his scrutinies into the heart of man;  
erected his tribunal in the region of his

pleméntary to the other motives to moral  
conduct. ;

&quot;The disadvantages under which the  
loctrines of Jesus appear are remarkable.  
Like Socrates and Epictetus, he wrote  
nothing himselt. Rut he had not, like  
them a xenophon or an Arrian to write  
for him, I name not Plato, who only  
used the name of Socrates to cover the  
whimsies of his own braln. On the con  
trary, all the learned of his country, en­  
trenched in its power and riches, were op­  
posed to him, lest his labors should under­  
mine their advantages; and the commit­  
ing to writing of his life and doctrine  
fell on unlettered and ignorant men, who  
wrote, too, from memory, and not till long  
after the transactions had passed.  
According to the ordinary fate of those  
who attempt to enlighten and reform man­  
kind, he fell an carly vietiin in theee  
and combination of the altar and the  
throne, at about thirty-three years of age,  
his reason having not yet attained the  
maximum of its energy, nor the course of  
his preaching, which was but of three  
years at most, presented occasions for de­  
veloping a complete system of morals.  
&quot;Hence the doctrines which he really  
delivered were defective as a whole, and  
fragments only of what he did deliver  
have come to us mntilated, misstated, and  
often unintelligible.  
&quot;They have been still more disfigured  
by the corruptions of schismatizing fol­  
lowers, who have found an interest in so­  
phisticating and perverting the simple­  
doctrines he taught, by engrafting on  
them the mysticisms of a Grecian sophist,  
frittering them into subtleties, and ob­  
scuring them with jargon, until they have  
caused good men to reject the whole in  
disgust and to view Jesus himself as an  
impostor.  
Notwithstanding these disadvantages,  
a system of morals is presented to us,  
which, if filled up in the style and spirit  
of the rich fragments he left us, would be  
the most perfect and sublime that has ever  
been taught by man.

He then draws a parallel between the  
doctrines of the most famous heathen  
philosophers and those of Christ,showing  
the superiority of the latter. He says  
that the ancients failed to teach benevo­  
lence toward all men, and that the&quot;moral  
doctrines of Christ relating to country  
and friends, were more pure and perfect  
than those of the most correct of the  
philosophers, and went far beyond both  
(Pagans and Jews) in inculcating univer­  
sal philanthropy, not only to friends and  
country, to neighbors and kinsmen,but to  
all mankind gathering all into&#x27;one family  
under the bonds of love, charity peace,  
common wants and common aids. A  
developing of this head will evince the  
peculiar superiority of the system of  
Jesus over all others. The precepts of  
the philosophers and of the Hebrew code  
laid hold of actions only—he pushed his  
commandments to the heart of man—he  
erected his tribunal in the region of the  
thoughts and purified the waters at the
