had been recently discovered within this state, and promised a communication on the subject as soon as we could recover what were still recoverable of them.  It is well known that the substratum of the country beyond the Blue ridge is a lime-stone, abounding with large caverns, the earthy floors of which are highly impregnated with nitre; and that the inhabitants are in the habit of extracting the nitre from them. In digging the floor of one of these caves, belonging to Frederic Gromer in the county of Greenbriar, the labourers, at the depth of 2. or 3. feet came to some bones, the size and form of which bespoke an animal unknown to them. The nitrous impregnation of the earth had served to preserve them till such a degree of petrification was brought on as had secured them from further decay. The importance of the discovery was not known to those who made it. Yet it excited conversation in the neighborhood, and led persons of vague curiosity to seek and take away the bones. It was fortunate for science that one of it’s zealous and well informed friends, Colo. John Stewart, of that neighborhood, heard of the discovery, and, sensible from their description that they were of an animal not known, took measures without delay for saving those which still remained. He was kind enough to inform me of the incident, and to forward me the bones from time to time as they were recovered. To these I was enabled accidentally to add some others by the kindness of a Mr. Hopkins of New York, who had visited the cave. These bones are 1. a small fragment of the femur or thigh bone, being in fact only it’s lower extremity, separated from the main bone at it’s epiphysis, so as to give us only the two condyles. But these are nearly entire.  
2. a Radius, perfect.  
3. an Ulna or fore-arm, perfect, except that it is broke in two.  
  
4. three claws, and half a dozen other bones of the foot; but whether of a fore or hinder foot is not evident.  
About a foot in length of the residue of the femur was found. It was split thro’ the middle, and in that state was used as a support for one of the saltpetre vats. This piece was afterwards lost; but it’s measures had been first taken as will be stated hereafter.  
These bones only enable us to class the animal with the Unguiculated Quadrupeds, and, of these, the lion being nearest to him in size, we will compare him with that animal of whose anatomy Monsr. Daubenton has furnished very accurate measures in his tables at the end of Buffon’s natural history of the lion. These measures were taken as he

said to be produced. I shall select from his measures only those where we have the corresponding bones, converting them into our own inch and it’s fractions, that the comparison may be more obvious: and to avoid the embarrasment of designating our animal always by circumlocution and description, I will venture to refer to him by the name of the Great-claw, or Megalonyx, to which he seems sufficiently entitled by the distinguished size of that member.

Were we to estimate the size of our animal by a comparison with that of the lion on the principle of ex pede Herculem, by taking the longest claw of each as the module of their measure, it would give us a being out of the limits of nature. It is fortunate therefore that we have some of the larger bones of the limbs which may furnish a more certain estimate of his stature. Let us suppose then that his dimensions of height, length and thickness, and of the principal members composing these, were of the same proportions with those of the lion. In the table of M. Daubenton, an Ulna of 13.78 inches belonged to a lion 42 1/2 inches high over the shoulders: then an Ulna of 20.1 inches bespeaks a Megalonyx of 5 f.—1.75 I. height. And as Animals who have the same proportions of height, length and thickness, have their bulk or weight proportioned to the  
  
  
Buff. XXII. 121.  
  
cubes of any one of their dimensions, the cube of 42.5 I. is to 262. ℔ the height and weight of M. Daubenton’s lion, as the cube of 61.75 inches to 803. ℔ the height and weight of the Megalonyx: which would prove him a little more than three times the size of the lion. I suppose that we should be safe in considering, on the authority of M. Daubenton, his lion as a large one. But let it pass as one only of the ordinary size; and that the Megalonyx whose bones happen to have been found was also of the ordinary size. It does   
  
Buff. XVIII. 15.  
  
appear that there was dissected for the academy of sciences at Paris a lion of 4 f.—9 3/8I. height. This individual would weigh 644. ℔ and would be in his species what a man of 8. feet height would be in ours. Such men have existed. A Megalonyx equally monstrous would be 7. feet high, and would weigh 2000. ℔. But the ordinary race, and not the monsters of it, are the object of our present enquiry.  
  
I have used the height alone of this animal to deduce his bulk, on the supposition that he might have been formed in the proportions of the lion. But these were not his proportions. He was much thicker than the lion in proportion to his height, in his limbs certainly, and probably therefore in his body. The diameter of his radius at it’s upper end is near twice as great as that of the lion, and at it’s lower end more than thrice as great, which gives a mean proportion of 2 1/2 for 1. The femur of the lion was less than 1 1/4 I. diameter. That of the Megalonyx is 4 1/4 I. which is more than three for one. And as bodies of the same length and substance have their weights proportioned to the squares of their diameters, this excess of caliber compounded with the height would greatly aggravate the bulk of this animal. But when our subject has already carried us beyond the limits of nature hitherto known, it is safest to stop at the most moderate conclusions, and not to follow appearances through all the conjectures they would furnish, but leave these to be corroborated, or corrected by future discoveries. Let us only say then, what we may safely say, that he was more than three times as large as the lion: that he stood as preeminently at the head of the column of clawed animals as the Mammoth stood [at that of the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus: and that he may have been as formidable an antagonist to the mammoth as the lion to the elephant].  
A difficult question now presents itself. What is become of the Greatclaw? Some light may be thrown on this by asking another question. Do the wild animals of the first magnitude in any instance fix their dwellings in a thickly inhabited country? Such I mean as the Elephant, the Rhinoceros, the lion, the tyger? As far as my reading and recollection serve me, I think they do not: but I hazard the opinion doubtingly because it is not the result of full enquiry. Africa is chiefly inhabited along the margin of it’s seas and rivers. The interior desart is the domain of the Elephant, the Rhinoceros, the lion, the tyger. Such individuals as have their haunts nearest the inhabited frontier, enter it occasionally and commit depredations when pressed by hunger: but the mass of their nation (if I may use the term) never approach the habitation of man, nor are within reach of it. When our ancestors arrived here, the Indian population below the falls of the rivers was about the twentieth part of what it now is. In this state of things an animal resembling the lion seems to have been known even in the lower country. Most of the accounts given by the earlier adventurers to this part of America, make a lion one of the animals of our forests. Sr. John Hawkins mentions this in 1564.

in his account of Virginia written about 1627. He says he drew his information from Pierce, Willoughby, Claiborne and others who had been here, and from his own father who had lived here 12. years. It does not appear whether the fact is stated on their own view or on information from the Indians. Probably the latter. The progress of the new population would soon drive off the larger animals, and the largest first. In the present interior of our continent there is surely space and range enough for elephants and lions, if in that climate they could subsist; and for mammoths and megalonyxes who may subsist there. Our entire ignorance of the immense country to the West and North West, and of it’s contents, does not authorize us to say what it does not contain. Moreover it is a fact well known, and always susceptible of verification, that on a rock on the bank of the Kanhawa near it’s confluence with the Ohio, there are carvings of many animals of that country, and among these one which has always been considered as a perfect figure of a lion. And these are so rudely done as to leave no room to suspect a foreign hand. This could not have been the smaller and mane-less lion of Mexico and Peru, known also in Africa both in antient and modern times, tho’ denied by M. de Buffon:  
  
Arist. Anim. 9.4. Plin. VIII. 16 Kolbe Buff. XVIII. 18  
  
because, like the greater African lion, he is a tropical animal. And his want of a mane would not satisfy the figure. This figure then must have been taken from some other prototype, and that prototype must have resembled the lion sufficiently to satisfy the figure, and was probably the Animal the description of which by the Indians made Hawkins Harriot and others conclude there were lions here. May we not presume that prototype to have been the Great claw? Many traditions are in possession of our upper inhabitants, which themselves have heretofore considered as fables; but which have regained credit since the discovery of these bones. There has always been a story current that the first company of adventurers who went to seek an establishment in the county of Greenbriar the night of their arrival were alarmed at their camp by the terrible roarings of some animal unknown to them, that he went round and round their camp, that at times they saw his eyes like two balls of fire, that their horses were so agonised with fear that they couched down on the earth, and their dogs crept in among them, not daring to bark. Their fires it was thought protected them, and the next morning they abandoned the country. This was little more than 30. years ago.—In the year 1765. George Wilson and John Davis having gone to hunt on Cheat river, a branch of the Monongehela, heard one night at a distance from their camp a tremendous roaring which became louder and louder as it approached, till they thought it resembled thunder and even made the  earth tremble under them. The animal prowled round their camp a considerable time, during which their dogs tho on all other occasions fierce crept to their feet, could not be excited from their camp nor even encouraged to bark. About daylight they heard the same sound repeated from the knob of a mountain about a mile off and within a minute it was answered by a similar voice from a neighboring knob. Colo. John Stuart had this account from Wilson in the year 1769. who was afterwards Lieutt. Colo. of a Pensva. regiment in the revolution war, and some years after from Davies who is now living in Kentuckey. These circumstances multiply the points of resemblance between this Animal and the lion.  
  
  
G’ent. &amp; Lond. magazine for 1783.  
  
M. de la Harpe of the French academy in his abridgment of the General history of voiages speaking of the Moors, says ‘it is remarkeable that when during their huntings they meet with lions, their horses, tho’ famous for swiftness, are seized with such terror that they become motionless, and their dogs, equally frightened creep to the feet of their master or of his horse.’ Mr. Sparrman in his Voyage to the cape of good hope chap. 11. says ‘we could plainly discover by our animals when the lions, whether they roared or not, were observing us at a small distance. For in that case the hounds did not venture to bark, but crept quite close to the Hottentots; and our oxen and horses sighed deeply, frequently hanging back, and pulling slowly with all their might at the strong straps with which they were tied to the waggon. They also laid themselves down on the ground and stood up alternately, as if they did not know what to do with themselves, and even as if they were in the agonies of death.’ He adds that ‘when the lion roars, he puts his mouth to the ground, so that the sound is equally diffused to every quarter.’ M. de Buffon [XVIII. 31.] describes the roaring of the lion as, by it’s echos resembling thunder: and Sparrman c. 12. mentions that the eyes of the lion can be seen a considerable distance in the dark and that the Hottentots watch for his eyes for their government. The phosphoric appearance of the eye in the dark seems common to all animals of the Cat kind. The terror excited by these animals is not confined to brutes alone. A person of the name of Draper had gone in the year 1770. to hunt on the Kanhawa. He had turned his horse loose with a bell on, and had not yet got out of hearing when his attention was recalled by the rapid ringing of the bell. Suspecting that Indians might be attempting to take off his horse he immediately returned to him, but before he arrived he was half eaten up. His dog scenting the trace of a wild beast, he followed him on it, and soon came in sight of an animal of such enormous size, that tho one of our most daring hunters, and best marksmen he withdrew instantly and as silently as possible, checking and bringing off his dog. He could recollect no more of  the animal than his terrific bulk and that his general outlines were those of the Cat kind. He was familiar with our animal miscalled the panther, with our wolves and wild beasts generally and would not have mistaken nor shrunk from them.  
In fine, the bones exist; therefore the animal has existed. The movements of nature are in a never-ending circle. The animal species which has once been put into a train of motion, is still probably moving in that train. And if he be still in being, there is no reason to disbelieve the relations of honest men, applicable to him and to him alone. It would indeed be but conformable to the ordinary economy of nature to conjecture that she had opposed sufficient barriers to the too great multiplication of so powerful a destroyer. If lions and tygers multiplied as rabbets do, all other animal nature would have been long ago destroyed, and themselves would have ultimately extinguished after eating out their pasture. It is probable then that the Great claw has at all times been the rarest of animals. Hence so little is known and so little remains of him. His existence however being at length discovered, enquiry will be excited, and further information of him will probably be obtained.  
The cosmogony of M. de Buffon supposes that the earth and all the other planets, primary and secondary, have been masses of melted matter struck off from the sun, by the incidence of a comet on it: that these have been cooling by degrees, first at the poles, and afterwards more and more towards their Equators; consequently that on our earth there has been a time when the temperature of the poles suited the constitution of the Elephant, the Rhinoceros and Hippopotamos: and in proportion as the remoter zones became successively too cold, these animals have retired more and more towards the Equatorial regions till now that they are reduced to the torrid zone as the ultimate stage of their existence.  
  
  
2. Epoq. 233. 234.  
  
To support this theory he assumes the tusks of the Mammoth to have been those of an elephant, some of his teeth to have belonged to the hippopotamos, and his largest grinders to an animal much greater than either, and to have been deposited on the Missouri, the Ohio, the Holston when those latitudes were not yet too cold for the constitutions of these animals. He would of course then claim for the lion, now also reduced to the torrid zone and it’s vicinities, the bones lately discovered; and consider them as an additional proof of his system; and that there has been a time when our latitudes suited the lion as well as the other animals of that temperament. This is not the place to [observe that we have all seen the teeth of the Mammoth as well those ascribed to the Hippopotamos as those left to himself fixed in the same jaw and now in possession of Dr. Wistar one of the worthy Vicepresidents of our society in the city of Philadelphia, nor to] examine all the other weak  points of this system, in which indeed almost all are weak and untenable. But let us for a moment grant this with his former postulata, and ask how they will consist with another theory of his ‘qu’il y a dans la combinaison des elemens et des autres causes physiques, quelque chose de contraire a l’aggrandissement de la nature vivante dans ce nouveau monde; qu’il y a des obstacles au developpement et peut-etre a la formation des grands germes.’ XVIII. 145. He says that the Mammoth was an elephant,  
  
  
2.Ep.223.  
  
yet two or three times as large as the elephants of Asia and Africa. That some of his teeth were those of a Hippopotamus, yet of a hippopotamus four times as large as those of Africa [1. Epoq. 246. 2. Epoq. 232.] That the mammoth himself, for he still considers him as a distinct animal, ‘was of a size superior to that of the largest elephants,—that he was the primary and greatest of all terrestrial animals’ 2. Ep. 234. 235. We suppose him to claim the Megalonyx for a lion, yet certainly a lion of more than 3 times the volume of the African. I delivered to M. de Buffon the skeleton of our palmated elk called Orignal or Moose 7. feet high over the shoulders. He is often considerably higher.  
  
  
1. Catesby. Kalm I. 232. II.340.  
  
I cannot find that the European elk is more than two thirds of that height consequently not one third of the bulk of the American. He acknoleges  
  
  
XXIX. 245  
  
the palmated deer (daim) of America to be larger and stronger than that of the old world. He considers the round horned deer  
  
  
XII. 91.92. XXIX. 245. V. Supplem. 201.  
  
of these states and of Louisiana as the Roe and admits they are of three times his size. Are we then from all this to draw a conclusion the reverse of that of Monsr. de Buffon, that Nature, has formed the larger animals of America, like it’s lakes, it’s rivers and mountains on a greater and prouder scale than in the other hemisphere? Not at all. We are to conclude that she has formed some things large, and some things small on both sides of the earth for reasons which she has not enabled us to penetrate: and that we ought not to shut our eyes upon one half of her facts and build systems on the other half.  
To return to our Great claw, I deposit his bones with the Philosophical society as well in evidence of their existence and of their dimensions as for their safe keeping and I shall think it [my] duty to do the same by such others as I may be fortunate enough to obtain the recovery of hereafter.

P.S. After the preceding communication was ready to be delivered in to the society, in a  
  
  
Monthly Mag. Sep. 1796.  
  
periodical publication from London I met with an account and drawing of the skeleton of an animal dug up near the river la Plata in Paraguay and now mounted in the cabinet of Natural history at Madrid. The figure is not so done as to be relied on, and the account is only an abstract from that of Cuvier and Roumé. This skeleton is also  of the clawed kind, and having only 4 teeth on each side above and below, all grinders, is classed in this account in the family of unguiculated quadrupeds destitute of cutting teeth and recieves the new denomination of Megatherium. Having nothing of our animal but the leg and foot bones, we have few points for a comparison between them. They resemble in their stature, that being 12 f.—9 I. long, and 6 f.—4 1/2 I. high, and ours by computation 5 f.—1.75 I. high: in the colossal thickness of the thigh and leg bones also. They resemble too in having claws, but those of the figure appear very small and the verbal description does not satisfy us whether the claw-bone or only it’s horny cover be large. They agree too in the circumstance of the two bones of the forearm being distinct and moveable on each other; which however is [believed] to be so common as to form no mark of distinction. They differ in the following circumstances if our relations are to be trusted. The Megatherium is not of the cat form, as are the Lion, tyger and panther, but is said to have striking relations in all parts of it’s body with the Sloth (Bradypus) tatoo (Dasypus) pangolin (Manis) and the anteaters (Myrmecophaga and Orycteropus.) According to analogy then it probably was not carnivorous, had not the phosphoric eye, nor leonine roar. But to solve satisfactorily the question of identity the discovery of fore teeth, or of a jaw bone shewing it had or had not such teeth, must be waited for and hoped with patience. It may be better in the mean time to keep up even the difference of name

Read savas TN a letter of July 3d, I informed our late moft  
  
10, 1797 worthy prefident that fome bones of a very  
large animal of the clawed kind had been recently dif-  
covered within this ftate, and promifed a communica-  
tion on the fubject as foon as we could recover what  
were ftill recoverable of them. It is well known that  
the fubftratum of the country beyond the blue Ridge is  
a limeftone, abounding with large caverns, the earthy  
floors of which are highly impregnated with nitre ; and  
that the inhabitants are in the habit of extracting the  
nitre from them. In digging the floor of one of thefe.  
caves, belonging to Frederic Cromer in the county of  
Greenbriar, the labourers at the depth of two or three  
feet, came to fome bones, the fize and form of which  
  
befpoke

befpoke an animal unknown to them. ‘The nitrous im-  
pregnation of the earth together with a {mall degree of.  
petrification had probably been the means of their pre-  
fervation. The importance of the difcovery was not  
known to thofe who made it, yet it excited converfation  
in the neighbourhood, and led perfons of vague curiofity  
to feck and take away the bones. It was fortunate for  
icience that one of its zealous and well informed friends;  
Colonel John Stewart of that neighbourhood, heard of  
the difcovery, and, fenfible from their defcription, that  
they were ef an animal not known, took meafures with-  
out delay for faving thofe which ftill remained. - He was -  
kind enough to inform me of the incident, and to for-  
ward me the bones from time to time as they were re-  
covered. To thefe I was enabled accidentally to add fomé  
others by the kindnefs of a Mr. Hopkins of New-York,  
who had vifited the cave. Thefe bones are,  
  
if, A-{mall fragment of the femur or thigh bone ;  
being in fact only its lower extremity, feparated from the  
main bone at its epiphyfis, fo as to give us only the two  
condyles, but thefe are nearly entire.

- 3d. An ulna, or fore-arm, perfect, except that it is  
broken i in two.  
  
4/b. Three claws, and half a dozen other bins of the  
foot ; but whether of a fore or hinder foot, is not evident.  
  
About a foot in length of the refidue of the femur was  
found, it was fplit through the middle, and in that ftate  
was ufed as a fupport for one of the falt petre vats, this  
piece was afterwards loft, but its meafures had been firlt  
taken as will be ftated hereafter.  
  
Thefe bones only enable us to clafs the animal witli  
the unquiculated quadrupeds ; and of thefe the lion being  
neareft to him in fize, we will compare. him with that  
animal, of whofe anatomy Monfieur Daubenton has fur-

the limits of nature. It is fortunate therefore that we  
have fome of the larger bones of the limbs which may  
furnifh a more certain eftimate of his ftature. Let us  
juppote then that his dimenfions of height, length and  
thicknefs, and of the principal members compofing thefe,  
were of the fame proportions with thofe of the lion. In  
the table of M. Daubenton an ulna of 13.78 inches be-  
longed to a Jion 424 inches high over the fhoulders : then  
an ulna of 20.1 inches befpeaks a megalonyx of 5 feet  
1.75 inches height, and as animals who have the fame  
proportions of height, length, and thicknefs have their  
bulk or weights proportioned to the cubes* of any one  
of their dimenfions, the cube of 42.5 inches is to 262 Ib.  
the height and weight of M. Daubenton’s lion as the  
cube of 61.75 inches to 803 lb. the height and weight of  
the magalonyx; which would prove him a little more  
than three times the fize.of the lion. I fuppofe that we  
fhould be fafe in confidering, on the authority of M.  
Daubenton, his lion as a large one. But let it pafs as  
one only of the ordinary fize, and that the megalonyx  
whofe bones happen to have been found was alfo of the  
ordinary fize. It does appear that there was diflected  
for the academy of fciences at Paris, a lion of 4 feet  
g} inches height. This individual would weigh 644 lb.  
and would be in his fpecies, what a man of eight feet  
height would be in ours. Such men have exifted. A  
megalonyx equally monftrous would be 7 feet high, and  
would weigh 2000 lb. but the ordinary race, and not the  
monfters of it, are the objéé&amp; of our prefent enquiry. “”

not his proportions, he was much thicker than the lion  
in proportion to his height, in his limbs certainly, and  
probably therefore in his body. The diameter of his ra-  
dius, at its upper end, is near twice as great as that of  
the lion, and, at its lower end, more than thrice as great,  
which gives a mean proportion of 21 for 1, The femur  
of ‘the lion was lefs than 14 inch diameter. That of the  
megalonyx is 44 inches, which is more than three for  
one. And as bodies of the fame length and fubftance  
have their weights proportioned to the fquares of their  
diameters, this excefs of caliber compounded. with the  
height, would greatly aggravate the bulk of this animal.  
But when our fubje&amp; has already carried us beyond the  
limits of nature hitherto known, it is fafeft to ftop at the  
moft moderate conclufions, and’‘not to follow appear-  
ances through all the conjeCtures they would furnifh,  
but leave thefe to be corroborated or corre&amp;ted by future  
difcoveries, Let us only fay then, what we may fafely  
fay, that he was more than three times as large as the  
lion: that he ftood as pre-eminently at the head of the  
column of clawed animals as the mammoth ftood at that  
of the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus: and that  
he may have-been as formidable an antagonift to the  
mammoth as the lion to the elephant.  
- Acdifficult queftion now prefents itfelf. What is be-  
come of the great-claw? Some light may be thrown on  
this by afking another queftion. Do the wild animals of  
the firft magnitude in any inftance fix theirdwellings in  
a thickly inhabited country? fuch, 1 mean, as the ele-  
phant, the rhinoceros, the lion, the tyger? as far as my  
reading and recolle€tion ferve me, I think they do not :  
but I hazard the opinion doubtingly, becaufe it is not  
the refult of full enquiry. Africa is chiefly inhabited  
along the margin of its feas and rivers. The interior  
defart is the domain of the elephant, the rhinoceros, the:

lion, the tyger. Such individuals as have their haunts  
neareft the inhabited frontier, enter it occafionally, and  
commit depredations when prefled by hunger: but the  
mafs of their nation (if I may ufe the term) never ap-  
proach the. habitation of man, nor are within reach of it.  
When our anceftors arrived here, the Indian population,  
below the falls of the rivers, was about the twenti¢gth  
part of what it now is. In this ftate of things, an ani-  
mal refembling the lion feems to have been known even  
in the lower country. Moft of the accounts given by  
the earlier adventurers to this part of America make a  
lion one of the animals. of our forefts. Sir John Haw-  
kins * mentions this in 1564. ‘Thomas Harriot, a man  
of learning, and of diftinguifhed candor, who refided  
in Virginia in 1587-4 does the fame, fo alfo does Bul-  
lock in his account of Virginia,t written about 1627,  
he fays he drew his information from Pierce, Willough-  
by, Claiborne, and others who had been here, and from  
his own father who had lived here twelve years. It does  
not appear whether the fac is ftated on their own view,  
or on information from the Indians, probably the latter.  
The progrefs of the new population would foon drive  
off the larger animals, and the largeft firft.. In the pre-  
fent interior of our continent there is furely. {pace and  
range enough for elephants and lions, if in that climate  
they could fubfift; and for mammoths and megalonyxes  
who may fubfit there. Our entire ignorance of the im-  
menfe country to the Weft and North-Weft,. and. of its  
contents, does not authorife us to fay what it does not  
contain.

Kanhawa, near its confluence with the Ohio, there are  
carvings of many animals of that country, and among  
thefe one which has always been confidered as a perfect  
figure ofa lion. And thefe are fo rudely done as to leave  
no room to fufpe&amp; a foreign hand. ‘This could not  
have been of the fmaller and manelefs lion of Mexico  
and Peru, known alfo in Africa both in* ancient and 4-  
modern times, though denied by {M. de Buffon: be-  
caufe like the greater African lion, he is a tropical ani-  
mal; and his want ofa mane would not fatisfy the figure.  
This figure then muft have been taken from fome other  
prototype, and that prototype muft have refembled the  
lion fuffigiently to fatisfy the figure, and was probably  
the animal the defcription of which by the Indians made  
Hawkins, Harriot, and others conclude there were lions  
here. - May we not prefume that prototype to have been  
the great-claw ?  
  
Many traditions are in poffeflion of our upper inha-  
bitants, which themfelves have heretofore confidered as  
fables, but which have regained credit fince the difcovery  
of thefe bones. There has always been a ftory current  
that the firft company of adventurers who went to feek  
an eftablifhment in the county of Greenbriar, the night  
of their arrival were alarmed at their camp by the ter-  
rible roarings of fome animal unknown to them: that he  
went round and round their camp, that at times they  
faw his eyes like two balls of fire, that their horfes were  
fo agonifel with fear that they couched down on the  
earth, and their dogs crept in among them, not daring  
to bark, Their fires, it was thought, protected them,  
and the next morning they abandoned the country. This  
was little more than 30 years ago.—In the year 176s,

on Cheat river, a branch of the Monongahela, heard one  
night, at a diftance from their camp, a tremendous roar-  
ing, which became louder and louder as it approached,  
till they thought it refembled thunder, and even made  
the earth tremble under them. ‘The animal prowled  
round their camp a confiderable time, during which their  
dogs, though on all other occafions fierce, crept to their  
feet, could not be excited from their camp, nor-even en-  
couraged to bark. About day light they heard the fame  
found repeated from the knob of a mountain about a  
mile off, and within a minute it was anfwered by a fimi-  
lar voice from a neighbouring knob. Colonel John  
Stewart had this account from Wilfon in the year 1769,  
who was afterwards Lieutenant Colonel of a Pennfyl-  
vania regiment in the revolution-war; and fome years  
after from Davies, who is now living in Kentucky.  
  
Thefe circumftances multiply the points of refem-  
blance between this animal and the lion. M. de la Harpe  
of the French Academy, in his abridgment of the Gene-  
ral Hiftory of Voyages, {peaking of the Moors, fays *  
** it is remarkable that when, during their huntings, they  
meet with lions, their horfes, though famous for fwift-  
nefs, are fiezed with fuch terror that they become motion-  
lefs, and their dogs equally frightened, creep to the feet  
of their mafter, or of his horfe.” Mr. Sparrman in his  
voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, chap. 11. fays, “ we  
could plainly difcover by our animals when the lions,  
whether they roared or not, were obferving us at a {mall  
diftance. For in that cafe the hounds did not venture to  
bark, but crept quite clofe to the Hottentots; and our  
oxen and horfes fighed deeply, frequently hanging back,  
and pulling flowly with all their might at the ftrong  
ftraps with which they were tied to the waggon. They

alfo laid themfelves down on the ground, and ftood up  
alternately, as if they did not know what to do with  
themfelves, and even as if they were in the agonies of  
death.” He adds that ‘‘ when the lion roars, he puts  
his mouth to the ground, fo that the found is equally  
diffufed to every quarter.” M. de Buffon (xviii. 31.)  
defcribes the roaring of the lion as, by its echoes refem-  
bling thunder: and Sparrman c. 12. mentions that the  
eyes of the lion can be feen a confiderable diftance in the  
dark, and that the Hottentots watch for his eyes for their  
government. ‘The phofphoric appearance of the eye in  
the dark feems common to all animals of the cat kind.  
  
The terror excited by thefe animals is not;confined to  
brutes alone. A perfon of the name of Draper‘had gone  
in the year 1770, to hunt on the Kanhawa. He had  
turned his horfe loofe with a bell on, and had not yet  
got out of hearing when his attention was recalled by the  
rapid ringing of the bell. Sufpecting that Indians might  
be attempting to take off his horfe, he immediately re-  
turned to him, but before he arrived he was half eaten  
up. His dog fcenting the trace of a wild beaft, he fol-  
lowed him on it, and foon came in fight of an animal of  
fuch enormous fize, that though one of our moft daring  
hunters and beft markfmen, he withdrew inftantly, and  
as filently as poffible, checking and bringing off his dog.  
He could recolle&amp;t no more of the animal than his terrific  
bulk, and that his general outlines were thofe of the cat  
kind. He was familiar with our animal mifcalled the  
panther, with our wolves and wild beafts generally, and  
would not have miftaken nor fhrunk from them.  
  
In fine, the bones exift: therefore the animal has ex-  
ifted. ‘The movements of nature are in a never ending  
c.vic. The animal fpecies which has once been put into  
a train of motion, is {till probably moving in that train.

animals, and oppofed by the thoufands and thoufands of  
inftances of the renovating power conftantly exercifed by  
nature for the reproduction of all her fubjeéts, animal,  
vegetable, and mineral. If this animal then has once  
exilted, it is probable on this general view of the move-  
ments of nature that he ftill exifts, and rendered ftill  
more probable by the relations of honeft men applicable  
to him and to him alone. It would indeed be but con-  
formable to the ordinary economy of nature to conjec-  
ture that fhe had oppofed fufficient barriers to the too  
great multiplication of fo powerful a deftroyer. If lions  
and tygers multiplied as rabbits do, or eagles as pigeons,  
all other animal nature would have been long ago def-  
troyed, and themfelves would have ultimately extin-  
guifhed after eating out their pafture. It is probable  
then that the great-claw has at all times been the rareft  
of animals. Hence fo little is known, and fo little re-  
mains of him. His exiftence however being at length  
difcovered, enquiry will be excited, and further infor-  
mation of him will probably be obtained.  
  
The Cofmogony of M. de Buffon fuppofes that the  
earth and all the other planets primary and fecondary,

fun by the incidence of a comet on it: that thefe have  
been cooling by degrees, firft at the poles, and after-  
wards more and mere towards their Equators: confe-  
quently that on our earth there has been a time when  
the temperature of the poles fuited the conftitution of the  
elephant, the rhinoceros, and hippopotamus: and in  
proportion as the remoter zones became fucceflively too  
cold, thefe animals have fetired more and more towards

the torrid zone as the ultimate ftage of their exiftence.  
To fupport this theory, he *affumes the tufks of the  
mammoth to have been thofe of an elephant, fome of his  
teeth to have belonged to the hippopotamus, and his  
largeft grinders to an animal much greater than either,  
and to have been depofited on the Miffouri, the Ohio,  
the Holfton, when thofe latitudes were not yet too cold  
for the conftitutions of thefe animals. Should the bones  
of our animal, which may hereafter be found, differ only  
in fize from thofe of the lion, they may on this hypo-  
thefis be claimed for the lion, now alfo reduced to the  
torrid zone, and its vicinities, and may be confidered as  
an additional proof of this fyftem; and that there has  
been a time when our latitudes fuited the lion as well as  
the other animals of that temperament. This is not the

animals.” If the bones of the megalonyx be afcribed to  
the lion, they muft certainly have been of a lion of more  
than three times the volume of the African. I delivered  
to M. de Buffon the fkeleton of our palmated elk, called  
orignal or moofe, 7 feet high over the fhoulders, he is  
often confiderably higher. 1 cannot find that the Euro-  
pean elk is more than two thirds of that height: confe-  
quently not one third of the bulk of the American. He*  
acknowledges the palmated deer (daim) of America to be  
larger and ftronger than that of the Old World. He+  
confiders the round horned deer of thefe States and of  
Louifiana as the roe, and admits they are of three times  
his fize. Are we then from all this to draw a conclu-  
fion, the reverfe of that of M. de Buffon. That nature,  
has formed the larger animals of America, like its lakes,  
its rivers, and mountains, on a greater and prouder fcale  
than in the other hemifphere ? Not at all, wé are to con-  
clude that fhe has formed fome things large and fome  
things fmall, on both fides of the earth for reafons which  
fhe has not enabled us to penetrate ; and that we ought  
not to fhut our eyes upon one half of her fafls, and build  
fyftems on the other half.  
  
To retutfn to our great-claw ; I depofit his bones with  
the ‘Philofophical Society, as well in evidence of their  
exiftence and of their dimenfions, as for their fafe-keep-  
ing ; and I fhall think it my duty to do the fame by fuch

P.S. March 10th, 1797. After the preceding commu-  
nication was ready to be delivered in to the Society, in a  
* periodical publication from London | met with an ac-  
count and drawing of the fkeleton of an animal dug up  
near the river La Plata in Paraguay, and now mounted in  
the cabinet of Natural Hi:tory of Madrid. The figure  
is not fu done as to be relied on, and the account is only  
an abftrac&amp;t from that of Cuvier and Koume. This fke-  
leton is alfo of the clawed-kind, and having only four  
teeth on each fide above and belo, all grinders, is in  
  
this account clafled in the family of unquiculated qua- °  
  
drupeds deftitute of cutting teeth, and receives the  
new denomination of megatherium, having nothing  
of our animal but the leg and foot bones, we have few  
points for a comparifon between them. They refemble  
in their ftature, that being 12 feet g inches long, and  
6 feet 44 inches high, and ours by computation 5 feet 1.75  
  
inches high: they are alike in the coloffal thicknefs of the”  
  
thigh and leg bones alfo. They refemble too in having  
claws: but thofe of the figure appear very fmall, and the  
verbal defcription does not fatisfy us whether the claw-  
bone, or only its horny cover be large. They agree too  
in the circumftance of the two bones of the fore-arm  
being diftin&amp; and moveable on each other; which hoéw-  
ever is believed to be fo ufual as to form no mark of dif-  
tinction. They differ in the following circumftances, if  
our relations are to be trufted. The megatherium is not  
of the cat form, as are the lion, tyger, and panther, but  
is faid to have ftriking relations in all parts of its body  
with the bradypus, dafypus, pangolin, &amp;c. According  
to analogy then, it probably was not carnivorous, had  
not the phofphoric eye, nor leonine roar. But to folvé

Reed aia a letter of July 3d, I informed our tate moft  
  
10, 1797- worthy prefident that fome bones of a very  
large animal of the clawed kind had been recently dif-  
covered within this ftate, and promifed a communica-  
tion on the fubject as foon as we could recover what  
were ftill recoverable of them. It is well known that  
the fubftratum of the country beyond the blue Ridge is  
a limeftone, abounding with large caverns, the earthy  
floors of which are highly impregnated with nitre ; and  
that the inhabitants are in the habit of extrating the  
nitre from them. In digging the floor of one of thefe.  
caves, belonging to Frederic Cromer in the county of  
Greenbriar, the labourers at the depth of two or three  
feet, came to fome bones, the fize and form of which  
  
be{poke  
  
  
  
On CERTAIN BONES, &amp;ce. 249  
  
befpoke an animal unknown to them. The nitrous im-  
pregnation of the earth together with a {mall degree of.  
petrification had probably been the means of their pre-  
fervation. The importance of the difcovery was not  
known to thofe who made it, yet it excited converfation  
in the neighbourhood, and led perfons of vague curiofity  
to feck and take away the bones. It was fortunate for  
icience that one of its zealous and well informed friends;  
Colonel John Stewart of that neighbourhood, heard of  
the difcovery, and, fenfible from their defcription, that  
they were of an animal not known, took meafures with-  
out delay for faving thofe which {till remained. . He was -  
kind enough to inform me of the incident, and to for-  
ward me the bones from time to time as they were re-  
covered. To thefe I was enabled accidentally to add fomé  
others by the kindnefs of a Mr. Hopkins of New-York,  
who had vifited the cave. Thefe bones are,  
  
if, A-{mall fragment of the femur or thigh bone ;  
being in fact only its lower extremity, feparated from the  
  
main bone at its epiphyfis, fo as to give us only the two  
condyles, but thefe are nearly entire.

broken i in two.  
  
4(h. Three claws, and half a dozen other TE of the  
foot ; but whether of a fore or hinder foot, is not evident.  
  
About a foot in length of the refidue of the femur was  
found, it was {plit through the middle, and in that ftate  
was ufed as a fupport for one of the falt petre vats, this  
piece was afterwards loft, but its meafures had been firlt  
taken as will be ftated hereafter.  
  
Thefe bones only enable us to clafs the animal witts  
the unquiculated quadrupeds ; and of thefe the lion being  
neareft to him in fize, we will compare. him with that  
animal, of whofe anatomy Monfieur Daubenton has fur-  
  
Li2 nifhed

nifhed very accurate meafures in his tables at the end

Africa,” in which quarter the largeft + are faid to be pro-  
duced. I fhall feleé&amp;t from his meafures only thofe where  
we have the correfponding bones, converting them into  
our own inch and its fractions, that the comparifon may  
be more obvious: and to avoid the embarrafiment of de-  
fignating our animal always by circumlocution and def-  
cription, | will venture to refer to him by the name of  
the Great-Claw or Megalonyx, to which he feems fuf-

dule of their meafure, it would give us a being out of  
the limits of nature. It is fortunate therefore that we  
have fome of the larger bones of the limbs which may  
furnifh a more certain eftimate of his ftature. Let us  
fuppote then that his dimenfions of height, length and  
thicknefs, and of the principal members compofing thefe,  
were of the fame proportions with thofe of the lion. In  
the table of M. Daubenton an ulna of 13.78 inches be-  
longed to a Jion 424 inches high over the fhoulders : then  
an ulna of 20.1 inches befpeaks a megalonyx of ¢ feet  
1.75 inches height, and as animals who have the fame  
proportions of height, length, and thicknefs have their  
bulk or weights proportioned to the cubes* of any one  
of their dimenfions, the cube of 42.5 inches is to 262 Ib.  
the height and weight of M. Daubenton’s lion as the  
cube of 61.75 inches to 803 lb. the height and weight of  
the magalonyx; which would prove him a little more  
than three times the fize of the lion. I fuppofe that we  
fhould be fafe in confidering, on the authority of M.  
Daubenton, his lion as a large one. But let it pafs as  
one only of the ordinary fize, and that the megalonyx  
whofe bones happen to have been found was alfo of the  
ordinary fize. It does appear that there was diffected  
for the academy of fciences at Paris, a lion of 4 feet  
g¢ inches height. This individual would weigh 644 lb.  
and would be in his fpecies, what a man of eight feet  
height would be in ours. Such men have exifted. A  
megalonyx equally monftrous would be 7 feet high, and  
would weigh 2000 Ib. but the ordinary race, and not the  
montters of it, are the objé&amp; of our prefent enquiry.  
  
I have ufed the height alone of this animal to deduce;  
his bulk, on the fuppofition that he might have been  
formed in the proportions of the lion, But thefe were

not his proportions, he was much thicker than the lion  
in proportion to his height, in his limbs certainly, and  
probably therefore in his body. The diameter of his ra-  
dius, at its upper end, is near twice as great as that of  
the lion, and, at its lower end, more than thrice as great,  
which gives a mean proportion of 24 for 1. The femur  
of ‘the lion was lefs than 14 inch diameter. That of the  
megalonyx is 4+ inches, which is more than three for  
one.. And as bodies of the fame length and fubftance  
have their weights proportioned to the fquares of their  
diameters, this excefs of caliber compounded. with the  
height, would greatly aggravate the bulk of this animal.  
But when our fubje&amp; has already carried us beyond the  
limits of nature hitherto known, it is fafeft to ftop at the  
moft moderate conclufions, and ‘not to follow appear-  
ances through all the conjectures they would furnifh,  
but leave thefe to be corroborated or corrected by future  
difcoveries, Let us only fay then, what we may fafely  
fay, that he was more than three times as large as the  
lion: that he ftood as pre-eminently at the head of the  
column of clawed animals as the mammoth ftood at that  
of the elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus: and that  
he may have-been as formidable an antagonift to the  
mammoth as the lion to the elephant.  
  
A difficult queftion now prefents itfelf. What is be-  
come of the great-claw? Some light may be thrown on  
this by afking another queftion. Do the wild animals of  
the firft magnitude in any inftance fix their‘dwellings in  
a thickly inhabited country? fuch, I mean, as the ele-  
phant, the rhinoceros, the lion, the tyger? as far as my  
reading and recolle€tion ferve me, I think they do not:  
but I hazard the opinion doubtingly, becaufe it is not  
the refult of full enquiry. Africa is chiefly inhabited  
along the margin of its feas and rivers. The interior  
defart is the domain of the elephant, the rhinocergs, the  
  
hon,,  
  
  
  
252 On THe DISCOVERY or  
  
lion, the tyger. Such individuals as have their haunts  
neareft the inhabited frontier, enter it occafionally, and  
commit depredations when prefled by hunger: but the  
mafs of their nation (if I may ufe the term) never ap-  
proach the habitation of man, nor are within reach of it.  
When our anceftors arrived here, the Indian population,  
below the falls of the rivers, was about the twenti¢th  
part of what it now is. In this ftate of things, an ani-  
mal refembling the lion feems to have been known even  
in the lower country. Moft of the accounts given by  
the earlier adventurers to this part of America make a  
lion one of the animals of our forefts. Sir John Haw-  
kins * mentions this in 1564. ‘Thomas Harriot, a man  
of learning, and of diftinguifhed candor, who refided  
in Virginia in 1587-4 does the fame, fo alfo does Bul-  
lock in his account of Virginia,t written about 1627,  
he fays he drew his information from Pierce, Willough-  
by, Claiborne, and others who had been here, and from  
his own father who had lived here twelve years. It does  
not appear whether the fac is ftated on their own view,  
or on information from the Indians, probably the latter.  
The progrefs of the new population would foon drive  
off the Jarger animals, and the largeft firft. In the pre-  
fent interior of our continent there is furely. {pace and  
range enough for elephants and lions, if in that climate  
they could fubfift; and for mammoths and megalonyxes  
who may fubfit there. Our entire ignorance of the im-  
menfe country to the Weft and North-Weft,. and. of its  
contents, does not authorife us to fay what it does not  
contain.

Kanhawa, near its confluence with the Ohio, there are  
carvings of many animals of that country, and among  
thefe one which has always been confidered as a perfect  
figure ofalion. And thefe are fo rudely done as to leave  
no room to fufpe&amp; a foreign hand. This could not  
have been of the fmaller and manelefs lion of Mexico  
and Peru, known alfo in Africa both in* ancient and 4-  
modern times, though denied by {M. de Buffon: be-  
caufe like the greater African lion, he is a tropical ani-  
mal; and his want ofa mane would not fatisfy the figure.  
This figure then muft have been taken from fome other  
prototype, and that prototype muft have refembled the  
lion fuffigiently to fatisfy the figure, and was probably  
the animal the defcription of which by the Indians made  
Hawkins, Harriot, and others conclude there were lions  
here. May we not prefume that prototype to have been  
the great-claw ?  
  
Many traditions are in poffeflion of our upper inha-  
bitants, which themfelves have heretofore confidered as  
fables, but which have regained credit fince the difeovery  
of thefe bones. There has always been a ftory current  
that the firft company of adventurers who went to feek  
an eftablifhment in the county of Greenbriar, the night  
of their arrival were alarmed at their camp by the ter-  
rible roarings of fome animal unknown to them: that he  
went round and round their camp, that at times they  
faw his eyes like two balls of fire, that their horfes were  
fo agonife with fear that they couched down on the  
earth, and their dogs crept in among them, not daring  
to bark. Their fires, it was thought, protected them,  
and the next morning they abandoned the country. ‘This

254 On tHe DISCOVERY or  
  
on Cheat river, a branch of the Monongahela, heard one  
night, at a diftance from their camp, a tremendous roar-  
ing, which became louder and louder as it approached,  
till they thought it refembled thunder, and even made  
the earth tremble under them. The animal prowled  
round their camp a confiderable time, during which their  
dogs, though on all other occafions fierce, crept to their  
feet, could not be excited from their camp, nor-even en-  
couraged to bark. About day light they heard the fame  
found repeated from the knob of a mountain about a  
mile off, and within a minute it was anfwered by a fimi-  
lar voice from a neighbouring knob. Colonel John  
Stewart had this account from Wilfon in the year 1769,  
who was afterwards Lieutenant Colonel of a Pennfyl-  
vania regiment in the revolution-war; and fome years  
after from Davies, who is now living in Kentucky.  
  
Thefe circumftances multiply the points of refem-  
blance between this animal and the lion. M. de la Harpe  
of the French Academy, in his abridgment of the Gene-  
ral Hiftory of Voyages, fpeaking of the Moors, fays *  
** it is remarkable that when, during their huntings, they  
meet with lions, their horfes, though famous for fwift-  
nefs, are fiezed with fuch terror that they become motion-  
lefs, and their dogs equally frightened, creep to the feet  
of their mafter, or of his horfe.” Mr. Sparrman in his  
voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, chap. 11. fays, “ we  
could plainly difcover by our animals when the lions,  
whether they roared or not, were obferving us at a {mall  
diftance. For in that cafe the hounds did not venture to  
bark, but crept quite clofe to the Hottentots; and our  
oxen and horfes fighed deeply, frequently hanging back,  
and pulling flowly with all their might at the ftrong  
ftraps with which they were tied to the waggon. They

alfo laid themfelves down on the ground, and ftood up  
alternately, as if they did not know what to do with  
themfelves, and even as if they were in the agonies of  
death.” He adds that ‘* when the lion roars, he puts  
his mouth to the ground, fo that the found is equally  
diffufed to every quarter.” M. de Buffon (xviii. 31.)  
defcribes the roaring of the lion as, by its echoes refem-  
bling thunder: and Sparrman c. 12. mentions that the  
eyes of the lion can be feen a confiderable diftance in the  
dark, and that the Hottentots watch for his eyes for their  
government. ‘The phofphoric appearance of the eye in  
the dark feems common to all animals of the cat kind.  
  
The terror excited by thefe animals is not,confined to  
brutes alone. A perfon of the name of Draper‘had gone  
in the year 1770, to hunt on the Kanhawa. He had  
turned his horfe loofe with a bell on, and had not yet  
got out of hearing when his attention was recalled by the  
rapid ringing of the bell. Sufpecting that Indians might  
be attempting to take off his horfe, he immediately re-  
turned to him, but before he arrived he was half eaten  
up. His dog fcenting the trace of a wild beaft, he fol-  
lowed him on it, and foon came in fight of an animal of  
fuch enormous fize, that though one of our moft daring  
hunters and beft markfmen, he withdrew inftantly, and  
as filently as pofflible, checking and bringing off his dog.  
He could recolle&amp; no more of the animal than his terrific  
bulk, and that his general outlines were thofe of the cat  
kind. He was familiar with our animal mifcalled the  
panther, with our wolves and wild beafts generally, and  
would not have miftaken nor fhrunk from them.  
  
In fine, the bones exift: therefore the animal has ex-  
ifted. The movements of nature are in a never ending  
c’:.ie. The animal fpecies which has once been put into  
a train of motion, is ftill probably moving in that train.  
For if one link in nature’s chain might be loft, another

to him and to him alone. It would indeed be but con-  
formable to the ordinary economy of nature to conjec-  
ture that fhe had oppofed fufficient barriers to the too  
great multiplication of fo powerful a deftroyer. If lions  
and tygers multiplied as rabbits do, or eagles as pigeons,  
all other animal nature would have been long ago def-  
troyed, and themfelves would have ultimately extin-  
guifhed after eating out their pafture. It is probable  
then that the great-claw has at all times been the rareft  
of animals. Hence fo little is known, and fo little re-

difcovered, enquiry will be excited, and further infor-

The Cofmogony of M. de Buffon fuppofes that the  
earth and all the other planets primary and fecondary,  
have been mafles of melted matter ftruck off from the  
fun by the incidence of a comet on it: that thefe have  
been cooling by degrees, firft at the poles, and after-  
wards more and mere towards their Equators: confe-  
quently that on our earth there has been a time when  
the temperature of the poles fuited the conftitution of the  
elephant, the rhinoceros, and hippopotamus: and in  
proportion as the remoter zones became fucceflively too  
cold, thefe animals have retired more and more towards  
the Equatorial regions, till now that they are reduced to

To fupport this theory, he *affumes the tufks of the  
mammoth to have been thofe of an elephant, fome of his  
  
tecth to have belonged to the hippopotamus, and his  
largeft grinders to an animal much greater than either,  
  
and to have been depofited on the Miffouri, the Ohio,  
  
the Holfton, when thofe latitudes were not yet too cold  
  
for the conftitutions of thefe animals. Should the bones  
  
of our animal, which may hereafter be found, differ only  
  
in fize from thofe of the lion, they may on this hypo-  
thefis be claimed for the lion, now alfo reduced to the  
torrid zone, and its vicinities, and may be confidered as  
  
an additional proof of this fyftem; and that there has  
  
been a time when our latitudes fuited the lion as well as  
  
the other animals of that temperament. This is not the  
  
place to difcufs theories of the earth, nor to queftion the  
gratuitous allotment to different animals of teeth not dif-  
fering in any circumftance. But let us for a moment  
grant this with his former poftulata, and afk how they

the lion, they muft certainly have been of a lion of more  
than three times the volume of the African. I delivered  
to M. de Buffon the fkeleton of our palmated elk, called  
orignal or moofe, 7 feet high over the fhoulders, he is  
often confiderably higher. 1 cannot find that the Euro-  
pean elk is more than two thirds of that height: confe-  
quently not one third of the bulk of the American. He*  
acknowledges the palmated deer (daim) of America to be  
larger and ftronger than that of the Old World. He+  
confiders the round horned deer of thefe States and of  
Louifiana as the roe, and admits they are of three times  
his fize. Are we then from all this to draw a conclu-  
fion, the reverfe of that of M. de Buffon. That nature,  
has formed the larger animals of America, like its lakes,  
its rivers, and mountains, on a greater and prouder {cale  
than in the other hemifphere? Not at all, wé are to con-  
clude that fhe has. formed fome things large and fome  
things fmall, on both fides of the earth for reafons which  
fhe has not enabled us to penetrate ; and that we ought  
net to fhut our eyes upon one half of her fafls, and build  
fyftems on the other half.  
  
To return to our great-claw ; I depofit his bones with  
the Philofophical: Society, as well in evidence of their  
exiftence and of their dimenfions, as for their fafe-keep-

ofhers as I may be fortunate enough’ to obtain the reco-  
very of hereafter.

P.S. March 10th, 1797. After the preceding commu-  
nication was ready to be delivered in to the Society, in a  
* periodical publication from London I met with an ac-  
count and drawing of the fkeleton of an animal dug up  
near the river La Plata in Paraguay, and now mounted in  
the cabinet of Natural History of Madrid. The figure  
is not fu done as to be relied on, and the account is only  
an abftra&amp;t from that of Cuvier and KRoume. This fke-  
leton is alfo of the clawed-kind, and having only four  
teeth on each fide above and below, all grinders, is in  
this account clafled in the family of unquiculated qua-  
drupeds deftitute of cutting teeth, and receives the  
new denomination of megatherium, having nothing  
of our animal but the leg and foot bones, we have few  
points for a comparifon between them. They refemble  
in their ftature, that being 12 feet g inches long, and  
6 feet 44 inches high, and ours by computation 5 feet 1.75  
inches high: they are alike in the coloflal thicknefs of the  
thigh and leg bones alfo. They refemble too in having  
claws: but thofe of the figure appear very fmall, and the  
verbal defcription does not fatisfy us whether the claw-  
bone, or only its horny cover be large. ‘They agree too  
in the circumftance of the two bones of the fore-arm  
being diftin&amp; and moveable on each other; which how-  
ever is believed to be fo ufual as to form no mark of dif-  
tinction. They differ in the following circumftances, if  
our relations are to be trufted. The megatherium is not  
of the cat form, as are the lion, tyger, and panther, but  
is faid to have ftriking relations in all parts of its body  
with the bradypus, dafypus, pangolin, &amp;c. According  
to analogy then, it probably was not carnivorous, had  
not the phofphoric eye, nor leonine roar. But to folveé

Description of a Quadruped of the  
Clawed kind, bones of which have  
been discovered in the weste rn parts  
of Virginia. By ‘Thoma 5 Je eficr-  
  
ent  
Vite  
  
T is well known that the sub-  
stratum of the country beyond  
the Blue Ridge, is a limestone,  
abounding with large caverns, the  
earthy floors of which are highly  
impregnated with mitre; and that  
the ini abitants are in the habit of  
extracting the nitre from them, In  
levine the floor of one of these  
Caves, belonging to Frederick Cro-  
mer, in the county of Greenbriar,  
the labourers, at the depth of two or  
three feet, came to some bones, the  
size and form of which bespoke an  
animal unknown to them. ‘The  
nitrous impregnation of the earth,  
together with a small degree ol pe-  
trification, had probably been the  
means of their preservation. The  
importance of he discovery was not  
known to those who made it, yet it  
excited conversation in the neigh-  
bourhood, and led persons of vague  
curiosity to seek and take away the  
bones. It was fortunate for science  
that one of its zealous and well in-  
formed friends, Colonel -— St  
art, of that nei ighbourhood, heard of  
the discovery; and, se nsible, irom  
their description, that they were of  
an animal not known, took mea-  
sures, without delay, for saving those  
which still rem: deed. He was kind  
enough to inform me of the inci-  
dent, and to forward me the bones  
from time to time as they were re-  
covered. ‘To these Ll was enabled  
to add some others, by the kindness  
of Mr. Hopkins of New-York,  
who had visited the cave. “These  
bones are,

in that state was used as a support  
for one of the sait-petre vats; this  
piece was alterwards lost, but its  
measures had been first taken, as  
will be stated hereafter.  
  
These bones only enable us to  
class the animal with the unquicu-  
ited quadrupeds; and of these, t! he  
lion being nearest to him in size,  
we will compare him with that ani-  
mal, of whose anatomy Monsieur  
Daubenton has furnished very ac-  
Curate measures in his tables at the  
end of Butfon’s Natural History of  
the lion. These measures were  
taken as he* informs us from * a

produced.

our present in-  
  
I have used the height alone of  
this ai 1imal to deduce his bulk, on  
the supposition that he might have  
been formed in the proportions of  
the lion. But these were not his  
proportions; he was much thicker  
than the lion, in proportion to his  
height, in his limbs certainly, and  
probably, therefore, in his body.  
‘The diameter of his radius, at its  
upper end, Is near twice as great as  
that of the lion; and, at its lower  
end, than thrice as  
gives a mean proportion of

2t fort. The femur of the lion  
was less than 14 inch diameter.  
That of the megalonyx is 4} uiches,  
which is more than three for one.  
And as bodies of the same length  
and substance have their weights  
proportioned to the squares of their  
diameters, this excess of caliber,  
compounded with the height, would  
greatly aggravate the bulk of this  
animal. But when our subjeét has  
already carried us beyond the limits  
of nature hitherto Known, it is  
safest to stop at the most moderate  
conclusions, and not to follow ap-  
pearances through all the conjec-  
tures they w ould furnish, but leave  
these to be corroborated or correct-  
ed by future discoveries. Let us  
only say, then, what we may safely  
say, that he was more than three  
times as large as the lion; that he  
stood as pre-eminently at the head  
of the column of clawed animals as  
the mammoth stood at that of the  
elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopo-  
tamus; and that he may have been  
as formidable an antagonist to the  
mammoth as the lion to the ele-  
phant.  
  
A difficult question now presents  
itself. What is become of the great-  
claw? Some light may be thrown  
on this by asking anothe er ques tion,  
Do the wild animals of the first mag-  
nitude in any instance fix their  
dwellings in a thickly inhabited  
country? such, [ mean, as the ele-  
a the “animate the lion, the  
  
veer? As faras + veadi ng and re-  
jaliel tion serve oc I think they do  
not: but [ hazard the opinion doubt-  
ingly, because it is not the result of  
fullinquiry. Africa is chiefly inha-  
bited along the margin of its seas and  
rivers. The interior desert is the  
domain of the elephant, the rhino-  
ceros, the lion, the tyger. Suc h in-

Davies, having gone to hunt on  
Cheat river, a branch of the Mo-  
noneahela, beard one night, at a  
distance from. their camp, a tre-  
mendous roaring, which became  
louder and louder as it approached,  
till they thought it resembled thun-  
der, and even made the earth trem-  
ble under them. The animal prowl-  
ed round their camp a considerable  
time, during which their dogs,  
though on all othet occasions fierce,  
crept to their feet, could not be ex-  
cited from their-camp, nor even  
encouraged to bark. About day-  
light, they heard the same sound  
repeated from the knob of a moun-  
tain about a mile off, and, within  
a minute, it was answered by a si-  
milar voice from a neighbouring  
knob, Colonel John Stewart had  
this account from Wilson, in the  
year 1769, who was aiterwards

ment in the revolutionary war; and  
some years afier from Davies, who  
is Now living in Kentucky.  
  
These circumstances multiply the  
points of resemblance between +&quot;  
animal and the lion. M. de |  
Harpe, ot the French academy, in  
his abridgement of the General His-  
tory of Voyages, speaking of the  
Moors, says,* “ it is remarkable  
that when, during their huntings,  
they meet with lions, their horses,  
though famous for swiftness, are  
seized with such terror that they  
become motionless, and their dogs  
equally frightened, creep to the feet  
of their master, or of his horse.”

that of Cuvier and Roume. This  
skeleton is also of the clawed kind,

is, in this account, classed in the  
family of unquiculated quadruped  
destitute of cutting teeth, and re-

our animal but the leg and foot  
bones; few points for a

and ours, by con nput tation, five ‘es

too, in having claws; but those o&#x27;  
the figure app ear very small, and  
he verbal description does not  
satisfy us whether the claw-bone,  
or only its horny cover, be large,  
They agree, too, in the circum-

* The Cosmogony of M. de  
Buffou supposes that the earth and  
all the other planets, primary and  
secondary, have been masses of  
melted matter, struck off from the  
sun by the incidence of a comet on  
her: that these have been cooling  
by degrees, first at the poles, and  
afterwards more and more towards  
their Equators: consequently, that  
on our earth, there has been a time  
when the temperature of the poles  
suited the constitution of the Ele-  
phant, the Rhinoceros, and Hip-  
popotamus: and in proportion as  
the remoter zones became succes-  
sively too cold, these animals have  
retired more and more towards the  
Equatorial regions, till now that  
they are reduced to the torrid zone  
as the ultimate stage of their exis-  
tence. To support this theory, he  
  
* affirms the tusks of the Mam-  
moth to have been those of an Ele-  
phant, some of his teeth to have be-  
longed to the Hippopotamus, and  
his ‘largest grinders to an animal  
much greater than either, and to  
have been deposited on the Missou-  
ri, the Ohio, the Holston, when

animals. Should the bones of ou

American Review. 31 4  
  
«* This is not the place to discuss  
theories of the earth, nor to ques-  
tion the gratuitous allotment to dii-  
ferent animals of teeth not differing  
in any circumstance. But let us  
for a moment grant this with his  
former postulata, and ask how they  
will consist with another theory of  
his, ** qu’il y a dans la combinaison  
des elemens et des autres causes  
physiques, quelque chose de con-  
traire a l’aggrandisement de la na-  
ture vivante dans ce nouveau monde;  
qu’il y ades obstacles au developpe-  
ment et peutetre a la formation des  
grands germes.”* He says that the  
Mammoth was an Elephant, yet +  
two or three times as large as the  
Elephants of Asia and Africa: that  
some of his teeth were those of a  
Hippopotamus, yet of a Hippopo-  
tamus { four times as large as those  
of Africa: that the Mammoth him-  
self, for he still considers him asa  
distinét animal,§ “ was of a size  
superior to that of the largest Ele-  
phants. ‘Phat he was the primary  
and greatest of all terrestrial ani-  
mals.” If the bones of the Me-  
galonyx be ascribed to the Lion,  
they must certainly have been of a  
Lion of more than three times the  
volume of the African. I deliver-  
ed to M. de Buffon the skeleton of  
our palmated Elk, called Orignal  
or Moose, seven feet high over the  
shoulders; he is often considerably  
higher. J cannot find that the Eu-  
ropean Elk is more than two thirds  
of that height: consequently not  
one third of the bulk of the Ame-  
rican. He || acknowledges the pal-  
mated deer (daim) of America, to  
be larger and stronger than that of  
the Old World. He considers the  
round horned deer of these States  
and of Louisiana, as the roe, and  
admits they are of three times his  
‘ize. Are we then, fromall this, to  
draw a conclusion the reverse of  
that of M. de Buffon? That nature,  
  
* Buffon, xviii. 145.  
Vor. II. No. 3.  
  
¢ 2 Epoq. 223.  
  
has formed the larger animals of  
America, like its lakes, its rivers,  
and mountains, on.a greater and  
prouder scale than in the other he-  
misphere? Not at ally we are to  
conclude that she has formed some  
things large and some things small,  
on both sides of the earth, for rea-  
sons which she has not enabled us  
to penetrate; and that we ought  
not to shut our eyes upon one half  
of her faéts, and build systems on  
the other half.”

¢ ath. Three claws, and half a dozen other bones of the foot; but  
whether of a fore or hinder foot, is not evident.”  
  
_ By comparing the measures of these bones with those of  
the lion, as given by M. Daubenton, the authcr is led to supe  
pose that the American animal was more than three times as  
Jarge as the lion.  
  
Different authorities are quoted for the existence of animals  
resembling the lion in North America: we extract the fol-  
lowing : ult,  
  
§ The terror excited by these animals is not confined to brutes  
alone. A person of the name of Draper had goue m the year 1770,  
‘to hunt on the Kanhawa. He had turned’ his horse Joose with a  
‘bell on, and had not yet got out cf hearing when his attention was  
-recalled by the rapid ringing of the bell. Suspecting that Indians  
-might be attempting to take off his horse, he immediately retatned to  
“him, but before he arrived he was half eaten up. His deg scenting  
“the trace of a wild beast, he followed him on it, and soon came in.  
sight of an animal of such enormous size, that, though one of  
our most daring hunters and best marksmen, he withdrew in-  
‘gtantly, and as silently as possible, checking and bringing off his  
dog. He could recollect no more of the animal than his terrific  
-bulk, and that his general outlines were those of the cat kind,  
He was familiar with our animal miscalled the panther, with our  
  
wolves and wild beasts generally, and would not have mistaken not  
shrunk from them.’ -  
  
Mr. Jefferson takes this occasion to refute, with great so-  
  
lidity, Buffon’s visions respecting the supposed degeneracy of  
animals in America.
