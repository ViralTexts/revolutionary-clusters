r subsequent evacuation of the island, it’s traces would soon be lost altogether. and, had it been otherwise, these innovations would have been carried with the Natives themselves when driven into Wales by the invasion and entire occupation of the rest of the Southern portion of the island by the Anglo-Saxons. the language of these last became that of the country, from that time forth, for nearly  seven centuries; and so little attention was paid among them to the Latin, that it was known to a few individuals only, as a matter of science, and without any chance of transfusion into the vulgar language. we may safely repeat the affirmation therefore that the pure Anglo-Saxon constitutes at this day the basis of our language. that it was sufficiently copious for the purposes of society in the existing conditions of arts and manners, reason alone would satisfy us from the necessity of the case. it’s copiousness too was much favored by the latitude it allowed  of combining primitive words so as to produce any modification of idea desired in this characteristic it was equal to the Greek. but it is more specially proved by the actual fact of the books they have left us in the various branches of history geography, religion, law, and poetry. and altho’, since the Norman conquest it has recieved vast additions and embellishments from the Latin, Greek, French &amp; Italian languages, yet these are but engraftments on it’s idiomatic stem. it’s original structure &amp; Syntax remain the same, and can be but imperfectly understood by the mere Latin scholar. hence the necessity of making the A-Saxon a regular branch of Academic education. in the 16th and 17th centuries it was assiduously cultivated by a host of learned men. the names Lambard, Parker, Spelman.

but it must also be evident, that learning was not so common in  
the Saxon era as at the present time. Our ancestors, having few  
opportunities for literary acquirements, could not have determined  
upon fixed rules for orthography, any more than illiterate persons  
in the present day, who, having been employed in manual labour,  
could avail themselves of the facilities which were offered: hence  
arose the difference observable in spelling the same words in  
Saxon; but a difference in orthography will not constitute a dia-  
lect. In a dialect of any language, there is a systematic alteration  
in the modification of the words, and often an introduction of new  
terms. ‘This alteration in the termination of words is said to be  
perceptible at two periods of the Saxon language. The Anglo~  
Saxon is, therefore, considered as having two dialects, called the  
Dano-Sazon, and the Norman-Sazon; according to the tim

other point of view, the correctness of the metrical opinions  
advanced in the Essay. The existence of metrical rules and  
principles in the structure of the Anglo-Saxon and other Northern  
poems is fully established; and the fact that alliteration was  
the discriminating and prominent feature of their metrical  
idioms is placed beyond dispute. That the learned Hickes ran  
into erroneous extravagance, cannot be denied, when, in the  
spirit of his age, “influenced by the desire of reducing every  
thing to some classical standard, he endeavoured to show that  
the writers whom he was recommending to the world observed  
the legitimate rules of Latin prosody, and measured their feet

cording to classical arrangements. Butthat Mr.Tyrwhitt should,  
on the other hand, have run into the extreme of declaring, ‘ that  
he can discover in the productions of our Saxon bards no traces

Franklin, that the English spelling is farther removed from  
this state than that of any other language with which he

“would remove the obstacles of uncouth spelling and  
unfamiliar characters, there would be little more difficulty
