Sir  
Monticello Mar. 21. 19.  
  
Your letter of Feb. 18. came to hand on the 1st instant; and the request of the history of my physical habits would have puzzled me not a little, had it not been for the model, with which you accompanied it, of Dr Rush’s answer to a similar enquiry. I live so much like other people, that I might refer to ordinary life as the history of my own. like my friend the Doctor, I have lived temperately, eating little animal food, &amp; that, not as an aliment so much as a condiment for the vegetables, which constitute my principal diet. I double however the doctor’s glass and a half of wine, and even treble it with a friend; but halve it’s effect by drinking the weak wines only. the ardent wines I cannot drink, nor do I use ardent spirits in any form. malt liquors &amp; cyder are my table drinks, and my breakfast, like that also of my friend, is of tea &amp; coffee. I have been blest with organs of digestion which accept and concoct, without ever murmuring whatever the palate chuses to  consign to them, and I have not yet lost a tooth by age. I was a hard student until I entered on the business of life, the duties of which leave no idle time to those disposed to fulfill them; &amp; now, retired, and at the age of 76. I am again a hard student. indeed my fondness for reading and study revolts me from the drudgery of letter writing, and a stiff wrist, the consequence of an early dislocation, makes writing both slow and painful. I am not so regular in my sleep as the Doctor says he was, devoting to it from 5. to 8. hours, according as my company or the book I am reading interests me; and I never go to bed without an hour, or half hour’s previous reading of something moral, whereon to ruminate in the intervals of sleep. but whether I retire to bed early or late, I rise with the sun. I use spectacles at night, but not necessarily in the day, unless in reading small print. my hearing is distinct in particular conversation, but confused when several voices cross each other, which unfits me for the society of the table. I have been more fortunate than my friend in the article of health. so free from catarrhs that I have not had one, (in the breast, I mean) on an average of 8. or 10. years thro’ life. I ascribe this exemption partly to the habit of bathing my feet in cold water every morning for 60. years past. a fever of more than 24. hours I have not had above 2. or 3. times in my life. a periodical head ach has afflicted me occasionally, once perhaps in 6. or 8. years, for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, which seems now to have left me; and, except on a late occasion of indisposition, I enjoy good health; too feeble indeed to walk much, but riding without fatigue 6. or 8. miles a day, and sometimes 30. or 40. I may end these egotisms therefore, as I began, by saying that my life has been so much like that of other people, that I might say, with Horace, to every one, ‘Nomine mutato, narratur fabula de te.’ I must not end however without due thanks for the kind sentiments of regard you are so good as to express towards myself; and, with my acknolegements for these, be pleased to accept the assurance of my respect and esteem.

dated Monticello, March $i, 1819.  
  
SIR,  
  
Your letter of Feb. 18th came to hand  
on the Ist inst,, and the request of my  
history of physical habits would have  
puzzled me not a little, had it not been  
for the model, with which you accom-  
panied it, of Dr. Rush&#x27;s answer to a  
similar inquiry. I live so much like other  
people that [ might refer to ordinary  
life as the history of my own. Like my  
friend, the Doctor, 1 have lived tempe-  
rately, eating little animal food, and that  
not as an aliment so much as a condi-  
ment for the vegetables, which constitute  
my principal diet. | double, however,  
the Doctor&#x27;s glass and a half of wine, and  
even treble it with a friend; but halve its  
effects by drinking the weak wines only :  
the ardent wines | cannot drink, nor do  
[ use ardent spirits of any kind; malt  
liquors and cider are my table drinks,  
aud my breakfast, like that also of my  
friend, is of tea and coffee. 1 have been  
blessed with organs of digestion which  
accept and concoct, without ever mur-  
muring, whatever the palate chooses to  
consign to them, and I have not yet lost  
4 touth by age.  
  
I was a hard student until I entered  
on the business of life, the duties of which  
leave no idle time to those disposed to  
fulil them; and now, retired, and at  
the age of 76, 1 am again a hard student.  
lndeed my foudness for reading and  
study, revolts me from the drudgery of  
letter-writing and a stiff wrist, the con-  
sequence of an early dislocation, makes  
writing both slow and painful. f am  
not so regular in my sleep as the Doctor  
says he was—devoting to it from five to  
eight hours, according as my company,  
or the book [ am reading, interests me;  
aud I never go to bed without an hour  
or balf-hour’s previous reading of some-

“I live so much like other people, that I might refer to ordinary life as  
the history of my own. Like my friend Dr. Rush, I Nave lived temperately, eating  
little animal food, and that not as an aliment, so much as a condiment for the ve-  
getables, which constitute my principal diet. I double, however, the Doctor’s  
glass and a half of wine, and even treble it with a friend ; but halve its effect  
by drinking the weak wines only. The ardent wines I cannot drink, nor do I  
use ardent spirits in any form. Malt liquors and cider are my table drinks, and  
my breakfast, like that also of my friend, is of tea and coffee. I have been blest  
with organs of digestion which accept and concoct, without ever murmuring,  
whatever the palate chooses to consign to them, and I have not yet lost a tooth  
by age. I was a hard student until I entered on the business of life, the duties  
of which leave no idle time to those disposed to fulfil them ; and now, retired,  
and at the age of seventy-six, I am again a hard student. Indeed, my fondness  
for reading and study revolts me from the drudgery of letter writing ; and a  
stiff wrist, the consequence of an early dislocation, makes writing both slow  
and painful. I am not so regular in my sleep as the Doctor says he was, devot-  
ing to it from five to eight hours, according as my company or the book I am  
reading interests me ; and I never go to bed, without an hour, or half hour’s  
previous reading of something moral, whereon to ruminate in the intervals of  
sleep. But whether I retire to bed early or late, I rise with the sun. I use spec-  
tacles at night, but not necessarily in the day, unless in reading small print. My

cross each other, which unfits me for the society of the table. I have been more  
fortunate than my friend in the article of health. So free from catarrhs, that I
