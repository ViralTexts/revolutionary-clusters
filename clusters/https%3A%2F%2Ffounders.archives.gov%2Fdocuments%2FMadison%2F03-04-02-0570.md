⟩.  
In this unprecedented state of the world, when commotion seems to be visiting it in all its parts, your Memorialists conceive that there should exist decidedly just causes of War, against Great Britain and a reasonable prospect of obtaining redress by force, before a measure of such fearful magnitude is resorted to. Without considering themselves, therefore, as debarred the exercise of their constitutional privileges in consequence of the existing state of War, your Memorialists would take the liberty of making such representations as they may deem relevant to the present subject of inquiry.  
In examining the alledged grounds of War against Great Britain, as they are contained in the message of the President compared with the report of the Committee on Foreign Relations, your Memorialists conceive that Congress could never have considered either the Blockading order of May 1806, the disavowa⟨l⟩ of the arrangement with Mr Erskine, the secret mission of John Henry, or the hostility of the Savages on our Frontiers, as distinct causes of War, but only as tending to fill up the picture of wrongs committed by Great Britain upon the United States. But even in this point of view, these several supposed subjects of complaint seem unworthy, in the apprehension of your Memorialists, of any very considerable influence.

y and Indian hostilities, your Memorialists should consider them as subjects entitled to higher attention, if sufficient evidence existed of either, to authorise the government even to demand an explanation of Great Britain; or indeed if Great Britain had not solemnly disavowed, through her Ministers in Parliament and Mr. Foster here, any disposition to excite against us the hostility of the Savage Tribes on our frontiers, or any attempts to “subvert our Government or produce a dismemberment of our happy union.”  
The grounds of War with Great Britain seem, therefore, to be principally two—the impressment of American seamen into the British service, and the British orders in Council. Unless these grounds furnish sufficient justification of an appeal to arms, the War is unjust, and the American people h
