No. 20  
						  
						Cape François, Feby. 12h: 1802  
					  
					After acknowledging the receipt of the letter which you did me the honor to write, under   
  
date of the 8th of January, and of the duplicate &amp; triplicate of the same with their enclosures, I must   
  
perform the painful task of relating the unfortunate events which have taken place here.  
					On the second of this month the French fleet, consisting of 14 sail of the line and 9   
  
frigates, appeared off this Harbour.  Everything was immediately put in motion on such an event,   
  
The whites rejoicing, and the blacks preparing for resistance.  They did not attempt to come in   
  
this day, altho the wind and weather were very favourable.  A Cutter belonging to the fleet came in,   
  
and an aid of the Admiral was sent to Genl. Christophe, who commanded the town, to deliver to him   
  
the Proclamation of the First Consul, and to know if he shod. make any opposition.  The answer   
  
from Christophe was, that he was but a subordinate Officer, and that he could not permit the Ship’s   
  
to enter without the order of the Governor.  This determination and the preparations making for   
  
opposition created, a general Alarm.  I went round to the Americans, and advised them to get   
  
themselves and their most valuable effects on board the Vessels in the harbour without delay.  At   
  
midnight, the Mayor &amp; municipality waited upon me with a request that I would attend a   
  
deputation of their body on board the fleet, to endeavour to make some accommodation that wd.   
  
save the town.  I readily consented, from motives of humanity, and from a wish to know their   
  
disposition towards the Americans here.  We embarked about 2 o’clk; and at the same time I gave   
  
orders to the American Vessels in the Road, to move over to the opposite side of the Harbour, that   
  
they might be as far as possible from the town.  The Ships having stood off in the night, we did not   
  
get on board the Admiral till one oclock of the third inst., where the deputation were received by   
  
Genl. Leclerc in a very severe manner, and informed that the Ships wd. come in the next day at all   
  
events, and without any other terms than those offered in the proclamation, of which I send a copy.    
  
After they had been dismissed, I was introduced to the General, and told him my double view in   
  
coming off.  He said as to the first, his determination had been delivered to the deputation, and as to   
  
the second, that the Americans might expect every protection he could give them.  I returned with the   
  
deputation, and we reached the town about sun set, when we went to Genl. Christophe, and the   
  
deputation informed him of the issue of their mission.  He declared he wd. not yield a point on his   
  
part—that he did not beleive the professions of insurg. freedom &amp;c. to the blacks, and that he shd.   
  
make opposition.  They used all entreaties possible to turn him from his purpose; but without effect.   
  
They left him in despair.  After they were gone, I used all the arguments I could think of to divert   
  
him from his purpose; but in vain.  I then asked him what the Americans had to depend upon.  He   
  
said he wd. give permission in the morng. for them to go on board their Vessels.  I retired to my   
  
House, and put up my most valuable papers and a few Clothes, to take on board the Am. Vessels   
  
with me in the morng.  The Town was filled with troops and other blacks from the Country during   
  
the night.  
					In the morng. at daylight, I went to Christophe’s for the Order for the Americans to   
  
embark, and also desired that all the women &amp; children &amp; other whites might be permitted to go on   
  
board the Am. Vessels, which wd. be ready to receive them.  He was mountg. his horse, and told me   
  
he wd. ride to the Water and give orders to the guard to permit the Americans only to go on board   
  
the Vessels.  I entreated for the others, but in vain.  I went to the Wharf, &amp; took the papers &amp; clothes   
  
I had put up, waited there some time, but findg. Christophe did not arrive, and the guard havg   
  
strict orders not to permit anyone to go off, I made such dispositions as to get off with a number of   
  
women &amp; children who were there; and such Americans as appeard: All but 4 or 5 havg. gone on   
  
board.  After I had been gone about half an hour Christophe came down, and not knowing I had   
  
gone off, gave the most positive orders not to suffer a soul to quit the shore, intending thereby to   
  
have kept me in the town.  This I was told by some others who got off afterward, by the same mean   
  
that effected my escape—gold.  
					The wind was light all day, and the fleet, which was close in to the reef could not enter the   
  
harbour.  In the afternoon armed men were sent on board the Am. Vessels, and every white &amp; black   
  
french man found on board were taken out &amp; carried ashore.  Just before dark one of the Ships   
  
stood in very near the port, with every appearance of entering.  The fort fired at her which was   
  
returned, and a canonading took place.  All the forts around the Harbour fired constantly, altho   
  
some were not within 6 miles of the ships.  This was the Signal for firing the town, which was   
  
immediately begun; and in about one hour it exhibited an awful scene of conflagration.  The ships   
  
did not attempt to come in.  
					Our situation on board the Vessels was not very pleasant.  We were totally defenceless, and   
  
within the power of the blacks.  And a report had come off in the afternoon, that they wd. come on   
  
board, after burning the town, &amp; destroy the vessels and massacre the people on board.  There were   
  
35 Am. Vessels in the Port (which was the whole number, a few small french   yers excepted), and as   
  
there appeared no other chance for our safety, after they shd. have gorged themselves on them, but   
  
from some of the Ships coming in (wh. they could not do in the night) or from a detachment of   
  
boats sent in by them with troops, I determined at once to go out by the Forts in a boat, and   
  
endeavour to get in a detachmt. of boats.  On passing the Forts, everything was silent, which   
  
convinced me they had abandoned them, after setting fire to the Town.  I got out safely, and as the   
  
ships had stood off, it was daylight before I got on board the Admiral.  I stated our situation to him,   
  
and he assured me he wd. go in with his Ships without delay, as they could now go in as soon or   
  
sooner than the boats.  Accordingly about 12 oclk we entered the Harbour, without a gun from the   
  
forts, which had been abandoned, as I imagined, and were blown up soon after I passed them.  We   
  
happily found the Am. shipping safe, as the blacks were still pillaging the town amidst the flames.    
  
The Troops instantly landed from the ships and the town was immediately cleared of the blacks, and   
  
a few houses, (perhaps 60 out of 600) saved.  
					To attempt to describe the scene of desolation is impossible.  The property lost by the Am.   
  
in the town was very considerable.  In goods &amp; debts due from those who have lost their all, it must   
  
be nearly 300,000 dolls.  Only one American lost his life, a Mr. Lanchester, of the House of   
  
Lanchester &amp; Richardson from Charleston (S. C)  He tarried on shore with a determination to save his   
  
property or perish with it, and unhappily suffered.  He was killed in his House, and, almost   
  
consumed in the flames.  Few other whites were killed, as they appeared to be more intent on   
  
plunder than murder.  3. Americans saved their Houses but their goods were pillaged, vizt. Mr.   
  
Dodge, Messrs. Keller &amp; Williams &amp; Messrs. D’Arcy &amp; Stevenson.  
					Captn. Rodgers of the Am. Navy, who was here, and who displayed that dauntless spirit   
  
which he is known to possess, tarried on shore through the whole, and by his good management   
  
and intrepidity saved the lives of many whom he got off from the flames, and was the means of   
  
saving several houses.  He takes this letter, and will give a more partic

d the Genl. in Chief expresses himself disposed to befriend us, in every way: But as yet no Am.   
  
Vessels have been allowed to dispose of or land their Cargoes, neither have any been permitted to   
  
sail (excepting Capt. Rodgers, who has obtained a special permission).  I am assured by the Genl.   
  
that he will give all expedition to establish the offices that the Vessels may enter &amp; clear, &amp; unload   
  
their Cargoes (such as have them)  As to taking in Cargoes it is out of the question, for there is   
  
nothing left to load a single vessel.  The destruction of the town is far greater than in the former   
  
conflagration.  The impatience of the Masters of the Am. Vessels, and many of the merchants, to   
  
have their Vessels dispatched, is such as to cause me much trouble.  I see that the situation of things   
  
here will not permit the French to make their arrangemts. for

l concerned?  
					Divisions of the Ships and troops have gone to different ports of the Island, one to Port   
  
Republican, and one to the City of Santo Domingo.  From these places we have not yet heard.  A   
  
Report was in town to-day, that the French met with a powerful opposition at Port Republican, and   
  
lost 4 or 500 men, and that the place was destroyed.  Others say there was little resistance &amp; the   
  
place saved.  They landed at Port au pais, at Limbay and at Fort Dauphin; at all which places they met   
  
with resistance; but made good their landing.  This is an evidence that opposition was determined   
  
upon from the first.  The Sons of Toussaint came over in the fleet; and were treated by the officers   
  
with great attention.  They had been in France for their education.  To Christophe it was declared by   
  
the aid of the Admiral who was sent to him on the 2 inst. that himself, Toussaint, and the other   
  
Chiefs who had conducted meritoriously in the late insurrection, would have their rank confirmed,   
  
their pay continued for life and full possession of their immense property, without its being   
  
questioned how they had acquired it, and he proposed to continue as a hostage for the fulfilment of   
  
these conditions by the General in Chief, if he wd. give up the idea of resistance: but it had no effect

Chiißophe, who commanded the town, to de- | |  
liver to him the proclamation of the Firft Con- ||  
ful, and to know if he thould make any oppofi- | :  
tion.—The anfwer from Chriftophe was, that  
he was but a fubordinate officer, and that he |  
could not permit the fhips to enter without the | |  
ordess of the Governor, This determination |  
and the preparation making for the oppofition, | |  
created a general alarm. Idt. Lear went round | |  
to the Americans, and advifed them to get them- | |  
felves and their moft valuable effe@s on board |,

der for the Americans to embark, and alfo defir- |  
ed that all the women and childrea and other |  
whites might be permitted to go on board the ‘  
American veffels, which would be ready to re- |  
ceive them, MHe was mounting his horfe, and  
told him he would ride to the water and giveor­  
ders to the goard to permit the Americans only t  
to goon hoard the veflels, Mr. Lear enrreated |  
for the others, but in vain.—Mr. Lear made  
fuch difpofition as to get off with a number of  
women and children who were there, and fuch  
Amesicans 3s appeared ; all but 4 or g having  
gone on board,  
The wind was high all day, and the fleet  
which was clofe in to the reef could not enter  
the harbor.—ln the afternoon armed men were  
fent on boatd the American veffels, and every  
white’and black French maz found on board was  
taken out and carried in there : —Juft before  
dark, one of the thips flood in very near the  
fort, with every appearance of entering. The  
fort fired at her, which was tetorned, and a can­  
onading took place, All the forts around the  
hathor fired counftantly, altho fome were not  
within 6 miles of the thips. This was the fig­  
nal for firing the town, which was immediately  
begun ; and in about oone hour it exhibited an  
awlol fcene of conflagration, The fhips did not  
ntem&#x27;? to come in,

totally defencelefs, and in the power of the  
blacks ; and a report had come off in the after­  
mnoon, that they would come on board, afier  
borning thetown, and defroy the veflels and  
maflacre the people on board,—There were 35  
American veffels in the port (which was the

had abandoned them, 2fter fetting fire to the

food off, it was daylight before he got on board

the admiral affured him he would go in with his

whites, and the defolation of the country.  
The letter feems to have been written by one  
of the leaders ; and it conc!udes with a de-

OFFICIAL NEWS FROM THE CAPE.  
A letter dated February 12, has T=  
ceived from Mr. Lear, our Conful at Cape  
Francois, from which the following cir-  
cumftantial and intercfing flatement is  
derived.

On the 24 of Febrrary the French fleet, con filling of  
14 fail of the line and 9 ir:yates, appeared cff the hare  
bour.-- Every thing was immediately put in action.  
The whites rejoicing, and the blacks prepasing for refitte  
ance. They did not attempt to come in that day, altho’  
the wind and weather were very favovrabie. A cutter  
beJonzing to the fleet came in, and an aid of the Admi-  
tai was fent to Gon Chiiftophe, who commanded the  
town,to deliver to him the proclamation of the Fit  
Coniul,and to knew if he theu&#x27;d mate any oppofirion.  
The antwer from Chriftophe was, that he was but a fub-  
ordinete cflicer, end_that he could not permit the fhips  
to enter « ithout the ordetsof the Governor. ‘This de-  
termination and the preparation making for oppofi ion,  
created a yereral arm. Mr. Leer weit round to the  
Americans, and advifed th om to get thumnfeivesand their  
moft veluab&#x27;s effe@s on tcard the vefleis in the ha: bour  
without delay. At midnight the municipality waited

tion of their body on hoard thir fleet, to endeavour to  
make fome accemmodation that would fave the town.  
He readily confented, from motives of humanity, and  
from 2 wit to know their difpofition towards the amer-  
icans They embarked about 2 0’clock, and at the fame  
time M-. Lear gave orders te the American veffe!s in  
the road, to move over to the oppofite fide of the har-  
bour, that they might be as far as poffible from the  
town. The thips having ftood off in the night, the dep-  
utation did not get on beard the Admiral till I o&#x27;clock  
of the 3d infl. where the deputation were received by  
General Leclercin a very fevere mauner, and informed  
that the thips would come in next day at ali events, and  
witho t any ether terms than th fe offered in the proc-  
Jamation. After they had been difmiffced, Me. Lear was  
introcuecd toth. general, andtold him his double view  
mm coming. He faidasto the firft, his determination had  
been delivered co the deputation, and as toth: f:cond,  
that the Americans might ex ect every preteétion he  
could give them. Mr. Lear returned with the deputa.  
tion, and they reached town about funfet, when they  
went to Gen. Chriftophe, and informed him of the iffue  
of their miffion. Heth:n afked him what the Ameri-  
canstad to depend upon. He &#x27;aid he would give per-  
miffion in the morning for them to go on board their  
velle&#x27;s. Vr Lear returned to his houfe and put up his  
moft valuable pavers and a few clothes:o take on board  
the American veffels with him in che morning. The  
town wat fi ied with troops and other blicks from the  
country curing the night. In the morning at day light,  
Mr. Lear went to Chridophe’s fog the order for the A-  
pi-ricans to embark, and aif defired thet all the women  
and children and o-her whites might be permitted to yo  
on board the American veffzis, which would be ready to  
receive them. HH: was mounting his horfe, and told  
him he would ride totne water and give orders to the  
guardto permit the Americans oaly to go on board the  
weffcls, Mr. Lear entreated for the oc:h:rs, but in vain  
Mr, Lear made {ch difpofition as to get off with a num-  
ber of women and children who were there,aud fuch A-  
mericans as appeared ; all but four or five having gone  
ou board,  
  
The wind was high all day, and the fleet which was  
clofe in to the reef, could net enterthe harbour Inthe  
afternoon armed men were {zn om board the American  
veffels, and every white and black Freach maa found on  
board wastaken out and carriedin there. Jit before  
dark, one of the fhips ftood in very near the tort, with  
every appearance of entering. ‘dh: fort fired at her,  
which was returned, and a cannonading took piace, All  
the forts around the harbour fived conuantly, althongh  
fome were not within 6 mi&#x27;es of the fhips. This was  
the fignal for firiug the town, which was immediate!y  
begun; and in abouc one hour it exhibited an awful  
fiene of conflagration, ‘he thips dia not attempt to  
gome in.  
  
The fituation of the Americans on board the vweffels  
wasnet very pleafane. They were totally dei ncelefs,  
and within the power of the blacks; anda repore had  
come off in th» afternoon.that hey wou d come on board,  
after burning the town, and deliroy the veffeis and maf-  
facre the people on board. There were 35 American  
vc ffels in the port (whi h was the whole number, a iew  
fmali French ones excepted) and asthere appearcd no  
other chances for fs‘ery, after they thould have gorged  
themfclves on fhore, but frum fome of the fhips coming  
in (which they could not co in the night) or froma de-  
  
tachment of ‘boats, fent in by them with the troops, t|

pofible. The property loft by the Americans in the  
town was very confiderable. In goods aud debts due  
from thofe whe loft their all, it muft be nearly 300,coo  
doljars. Only one American loft his life,a Mr. Lan-  
chefter, of the Loufe of Lanchafter and Richardfton from  
Charieftop, (S.C.) He tarried on fhore with a deter-  
mination to fave his preperty or perifh with it, and un-  
happily fuffered. He was killed in his houle. aad almoft  
confumed inthe flames Few other whites were killed,  
as they appeared to be more intent oa plunder than mar  
  
der. Three Americans faved their houfes, but their  
goods were pillaged, viz. Mr. Dodge, Mefirs. Hellen &amp;  
Williams, and Mefirs D’Arcy &amp; Scewenfon.  
  
Capt. Rogers, of the American navy, was there, and  
who difp ayed that dauntlefs {pirit which he is known  
to peffefs, tarricd om fhore through the whole, and by  
his good management and intrepicity fecured the lives  
of many whom he gor of from the fames, and was the  
means of faving feveral houfes.  
  
The general in chief, exprees himielf difpofed to b:&lt;-  
friend the Americans in every way , but as yet, no A-  
merican veffels have been allowed to difpofe of or land  
their cargoes, neither have any been permirted to fail-  
(excepting Capt. Rogers, who has obtained a {pecial pere  
miffion), Mr, Lear was affured by ‘he general, that he  
would give all expedition to abolifh the offices, that the  
vellcls may enter and clear and unload their cargoes  
(uch as have them), As totcking im cargees, it is our  
of the queftion ; for shere is nothing left toloeda fing):  
veffe!; the deftrudien of the town is far greater than  
in the former conflogration,

one to the city ef Santo Domingo. from thefe places

Mr.‘ ear had not heard. A report was in town, that  
the Freach met with a powerful oppefition at Port Re-  
publican and loft 4 or sco men, and that the place was  
deftroyed. Others fay, there was little rcfiftance, and  
the piace faved. They landed at Port au Prince,at j.im  
bay. and at Port Dau; hin ; atall which places they met  
with r fiftance ; but made good their landing This is  
an evidence, that oppofition was determined upon from  
the firtt. The fons of Touffaint came over in the fleet;  
and were treated by the officers with great attention.  
They had been in France for their ecucation. To Chrif-  
tophe, it was declared by the aid of the admiral who  
was fent to him on the 2d inft. that himfelf, Touffainr,  
  
; andthe other chefs who had conducted meritoricufly  
  
in the late infurre@ion, would have cheir rank confirm  
ed, their pay continued for life and full poffefiion of their  
  
| immenfe property, without its being queftioned how  
| they acquired it.  
  
And he propofed to continue as a hof-  
tage for the fulfilment of thefe condi:ions by the general  
in chief if he wou&#x27;d give up the idea oi refiftance, but it  
  
&#x27; had no effect upon him.

On the fecond of February the French fleet,  
confiding ol 12 fail of the line and 9 frigates,  
appeared off the harbenr.—Every thing was  
immediately pnt in motion. The whiles rejoic­  
ing.-and the ‘.darks preparing for refiftance.  
They did not attempt to come in that dav al  
though the wind and weather were very favour,  
alls.—A cutter belonging to the fi:&lt;t came in,  
  
and an Aid of the Admiral was fent to General  
C&#x27;hriflophe, who commanded the town to diliver  
to him the proclamations of the Firft Counful,  
and to know if he fh uld make any oppofuioii  
—The anlwer of Chriftophe wai, that he was  
Uut a fubordinate officer, and ihat he could not  
permit the fh ps to enter without the orders of  
the Governor. This determination and the  
preparation making for oppofrion, created a  
a general alarm. Mr. Lear went round to the  
Americans, andadvifed them to get themfelve*  
and their moll valuable offers on board the vef­  
fe’s in the hajbour without delay. At mid­  
night the mayor and municipality waited upon  
him, with a requeft that he would attend a de  
putation of their body on board the fleet, to en­  
deavor to make feme accomodation that  
would fave the town. He readily conferred,  
from motives of humanity, and from a wdh to  
kn&lt; w their dilpofiticn towards the Americans.  
They embarked about z’clock, and at the fame  
time Mr. Lear, gave orders to the American  
veflcls in the road, to move over to the oppo*  
fiite fide of (he harbor, that they might be as  
far as poffible from the town. The fhips, hav­  
ing flood off in the night, the deputation did  
not get on board the Admiral till one o’clock  
of the third inft where the deputation were re.  
ceived by Gen. Leclerc in a very fevere man­  
ner. and inf rmed that the fhips would come in  
next day at all events, and without ar y other  
terms than thofe offered in the proclamation  
fpubiifhed laft week). Alter they had been  
difmilfed, Mr Lear was introduced to the gen­  
eral, and told him his double view in coming.

nc -uiu me nut, ins ueici luiiiaiiou iiau  
had been delivered to the deputation, and as  
to the fecond, that the Americans m:ght expert

returned with the deputation, and they reach  
ed the town about fuafet, when they went to  
General Chriftophe, and informed h»m of the  
iflue of their million. He declared he would  
f  
not yield a point on his part—Mr. Lear th^n I  
alked him what the Americans had to depend ;  
upon He Lid*be would g;ve pcrmiilion in &#x27;he  
morning for them to go on board their veflcls.  
Mr. Lear retired to hishoufe. and put up hi  
molt valuable papers and a few clothes, to take

morning. The town was filled with troops  
and other blacks from die country luring the  
night. In the morning at day light. Mr.  
Lear went to Chriftopbe’s for&#x27;he order for

them. He was mounting his horfe, and told  
him he would ride to the water and g:ve or­

not within 6 miles of&#x27;he (hips. This was the  
lignal for firing the town, which wa* immeJi  
atcly begun, and in about one hour it exhibit  
ed an awful feene of con#! igratioa.—The ihips j  
did not attempt to come in.  
The fituat on of the Americans on board the  
fflhlt wns not vety pleafant. They were j  
totally defeocelefs, and within the power ©1 j  
&#x27; the blacks ; and a report had come off in the  
afternoon, that they would come on board, af  
ter burning the town, and deUroy the vef- j  
feis and maffacre the people on board. There »  
was 35 American velfels in the port (wfoicH  
was the whole number, a lew fm ill French  
ones excepted) and as there appeared no other  
chances tor fafety, after they lhould have gor.  
ged themfclves on fhore, but from tofhe of the  
lh&#x27;ps coming in (which they could not do in  
the night) or f n a detachment of boats fent  
in by them with the troops, Mr. Lear determi­  
ned at once to go out by the forts in a boar,  
and endeavor to get in a detachment of boats.  
—On paflirtg the foits every thing was filent,  
which convinced him they had abandoned them,  
alter fetting fire to the town.— He got out Ufe­  
ly ; and as the (hips flood off, it was daylight  
before he got on boird the Admiral. He told  
his fituation to him, and the Admiral alfured  
him he would go in with his.(hips without delay  
as they could now get in as foon or fooner than  
the boats. Accordingly about u o&#x27;clock they  
entered the harbour, without a gun from the  
forts, which had been abandoned.—They lou*d  
the AnfUtcan (hipping fafe, as the blacks were  
ftill piilaging the town amidft the flames. Fhe  
troops inftantly landed from the (hips, and the  
town was immediately cleared of c blacks,  
and a few houfes (perhaps 6o out of 6»o)  
faVed.  
To attempt to deferibe the feenes cf dcfola  
tion is impoffible. The property loft by the .  
American* in the town was very confiderab&#x27;e. j  
In goods and debts due from thofe who loft  
their all, it muft be nearly 30 000 dollars.—  
Only one American loft his life, a Mr. Lan  
chelter, «f the houfe of Lanchefter and R»ch­  
ardfun, from Cbarleftoo, S. C He tarried on  
fhore with a determination to fave his ptope^ty  
or perilh with it, and unhappily (uffered. He  
was killed iu bU houfe, and ilmoft «onfumed in  
  
tLe flames. Few other whites wers kill&#x27;d, as  
they appears 1 to be more intent on plunder  
than murder. Three Americans faved their  
hwufo, but their goods were pillageJ, viz—  
Mr. Dope, Meflis. Hellen and Williams, and  
Meflrs. IV Arc y and Stephenfon*  
Capt. Rogers, of the American navy, was  
there, and who difplayed that dauntlefs fpirit  
which he is known to poflefs, tarried on fhore  
through the whole, and by his good manage­  
ment and intrepidity fecured the lives ©1 many  
whom he got off from the flames, and was the  
means of faving federal houfes.  
The general in chief, exprefles himfelf difpof­  
ed to befriend the Americans in every way ;  
but as yet, no American veflels have been allow­  
ed to difpofe of or land their cargoes, neither  
have any been permitted to fail (excepting Capt.  
Rogers, who has obtained afpecial permifliou.)  
Mr. Lear was aflired by the general, that be  
woul J give all expedition to effablifh the offices,  
that the veflels may enter and clear and unload  
their cargoes (fuch as have them) ! As to taking  
in cargoes that is out of the queftion ; for there ts  
nothing left to load a Angle veflel ; the dcltrnc •  
lion of the town is far greater than in the for­  
mer conflagration.  
  
Uivinous ot the tfcips an 1 troops nave fone  
to different parts- of the Iflind ; or*e to Port­  
Republic.in, and one to tire city of St. Domingo ;  
from thtfe pieces Mr Lear had not heard. A  
report was in town: that the Trench met wiih a  
p werful oppofuon at Port Republican, and loft  
4 or 506 men, and that the place was dcftr«»y­  
ed. Other* fay, there w*j$ little refiftwee, and  
she plate faved, They landed at Port nu-Pa’x,  
at L^mb ty, arid at Tort Dauphin ; at all which  
places they met with refifta .ee ; but made good  
their landing. This &gt;s an evidence, that oppo  
fnion was determined upon from the rirlL The  
(hns of Touli&#x27;a iK came over in the ft ret, nnh  
were treated by the lfioei6 with great attention.  
Thev had been in France for their education,  
l o ChriUophe, it wa&#x27; declared by the aid of the  
admiral who wac fent to him on the 2d inft.  
that himfelf. To i’lfar.t, and the other chiefs who
