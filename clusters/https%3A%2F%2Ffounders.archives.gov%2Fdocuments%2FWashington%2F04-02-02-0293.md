Sir,

I purposed, so soon as I understood you intended to become the Publisher of a News Paper in Philadelphia to request that a copy of your weekly production might be sent to me. I was the more pleased with this determination, when, by a letter from  
  
my friend the Marquis de la Fayette, I found he had interested himself in your behalf.  
It has so happened, that my Gazettes from Philadelphia, whether from inattention at the Printing or Post offices, or other causes; come very irregularly to my hands: Let me pray you therefore, to address those you send me, in the appearance of a letter. The common paper, usually applied, will do equally well for the cover—It has sometimes occurred to me, that there are persons who wishing to read News Papers without being of the expence of paying for them, make free with those which are addressed to others. under the garb of a letter, it is not presumable this liberty would be taken. I am—Sir Yr most obedt Servt

- Sir—l purposed as soon as I understocd youn  
intended to become tho publisher of a News  
Paper in Philadelphia to request that a copy  
i of your weekly production might be sent to  
me.  
I was more pleased with the determination  
when, by a letter from my friend the Marquis  
de la Fayett, I found he had interested him­

It has sa happened, that my Gazettes from  
Philadelphia, whether frean inattentiomn at the  
Printers or Post Offiec, or cther cause, come  
very irregularly to my hands! Let me pray  
you, therefore, to address those you send me,  
in the ta)pearzmco of a letter. The common. pa­  
per, usthally applied, will do equally well for  
the cover,  
It has sometimes accurred to me that there  
are persons who, wishing o read News Papers,  
withput being at the expense of paying for  
them, make free with those which are ad­  
dressed to others. Under the garb of a letter,  
it is not presumable this liberty would be  
taken.-
