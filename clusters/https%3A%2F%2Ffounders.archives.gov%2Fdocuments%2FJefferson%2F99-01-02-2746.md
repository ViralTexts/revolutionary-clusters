To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the  
US. of America   
  
  
At a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion &amp; arming against each other, when those with whom we have principal intercourse are engaged in the general contest, and when the countenance of some of them towards our peaceable country, threatens that even that may not be unaffected by what is passing on the general theatre, a meeting of the Representatives of the nation in both houses of Congress has become more than usually desirable. coming from every section of our country, they bring with them the sentiments &amp; the information of the whole &amp; will be enabled to give a direction to the public affairs which the will &amp; the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.  
In taking a view of the state of our country, we, in the first place, notice the late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in his goodness gave it an early termination on this occasion, &amp; lessened the number of victims which have usually fallen before it. in the course of the several visitations by this disease, it has appeared that it is strictly local, incident to cities &amp; on the tide waters only, incommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease, or by goods carried from diseased places, that it’s access is with the autumn, and it disappears with the early frosts. these restrictions, within narrow limits of time &amp; space, give security, even to our maritime cities, during three fourths of the year, &amp; to the country always. altho’ from these facts it appears unnecessary, yet, to satisfy the fears of foreign nations, and cautions on their part not to be complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them, I have strictly enjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to certify with exact truth, for every vessel sailing for a foreign port, the state of health respecting this fever which prevails at the place from which she sails. under every motive from character &amp; duty to certify the truth, I have no doubt they have faithfully executed this injunction. much real injury has however been sustained from a propensity to identify with this endemic, &amp; to call by the same name, fevers of very different kinds which have been known at all times, and in all countries, &amp; never have been placed among those deemed contagious. As we advance in our knolege of this disease, as facts develope the source from which individuals recieve it, the State authorities charged with the care of the public health &amp; Congress with that of the general commerce, will become able to regulate with effect their respective functions in these departments. the burthen of Quarentines is felt at home as well as abroad. their efficacy merits examination. altho’ the health laws of the states should be found to need no present revisal by Congress, yet Commerce claims that their attention be ever awake to them.  
Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has considerably changed. our coasts have been infested, &amp; our harbours watched by private armed vessels, some of them without commissions, some with illegal commissions, others with those of legal form, but committing piratical acts beyond the authority of their commissions. they have captured in the very entrance of our harbors, as well as on the high seas, not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade with us, but our own also. they have carried them off under presence of legal adjudication, but, not daring to approach a court of justice, they have plundered &amp; sunk them by the way, or in obscure places, where no evidence could arise against them, maltreating the crews, &amp; abandoning them in boats, in the open sea, or on desert shores, without food or covering. these enormities appearing to be unreached by any controul of their sovereigns, I found it necessary to equip a force to cruize within our own seas, to arrest all vessels of these descriptions found hovering on our coasts, within the limits of the Gulf stream, &amp; to bring the offenders in for trial as pirates.  
The same system of hovering on our coasts, &amp; harbours, under colour of seeking enemies, has been also carried on by public armed ships, to the great annoyance &amp; oppression of our commerce. New principles too have been interpolated into the law of nations founded neither in justice, nor the usage or acknolegement of nations. according to these, a belligerent takes to itself a commerce with it’s own enemy, which it denies to a Neutral on the ground of it’s aiding that enemy in the war. but reason revolts at such an inconsistency. and the Neutral having equal right with the belligerent to decide the question, the interests of our constituents, and the duty of maintaining the authority of Reason, the only Umpire between just nations, impose on us  the obligation of providing an effectual &amp; determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable nations. indeed the confidence we ought to have in the justice of others still countenances the hope, that a sounder view of those rights will of itself induce from every belligerent a more correct observance of them.  
With Spain our negociations for the settlement of differences have not had a satisfactory issue. Spoliations during the former war for which she had formally acknoleged herself responsible, have been refused to be compensated, but on conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them. yet the same practices are renewed in the present war, &amp; are already of great amount. on the Mobille our commerce passing through that river continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties &amp; vexatious searches. Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries of Louisiana have not been acceded to. while however the right is unsettled, we have avoided changing the state of things by taking new posts, or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories, in the hope that the other power would not, by a contrary conduct, oblige us to meet their example, and endanger conflicts of authority, the issue of which may not be easily controuled. but in this hope we have now reason to lessen our confidence. inroads have been recently made into the territories of Orleans &amp; the Missisipi, &amp; our citizens have been siesed and their property plundered in the very parts of the former which had been actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular officers and souldiers of that government. I have therefore found it necessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect our citizens, and to repel by arms any similar aggressions in future. other details necessary for your full information of the state of things between this country &amp; that, shall be the subject of another communication.  
In reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers, the moderation, the firmness &amp; the wisdom of the legislature will all be called into action. we ought still to hope that time &amp; a more correct estimate, of interest as well as of character, will produce the justice we are bound to expect. but should any nation decieve itself by false calculations, and disappoint that expectation, we must join in the unprofitable contest, of trying which party can do the other the most harm. some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. where that is competent it is always the most desirable. but some of them are of a nature to be met by force only, &amp; all of them may lead to it. I cannot therefore but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for. the first object is to place our sea-port towns out of the danger of insult. Measures have been already taken, for furnishing them with heavy cannon for the service of such land batteries as may make a part of their defence against armed vessels approaching them. in aid of these it is desireable we should have a competent number of gunboats: &amp; the number, to be competent, must be considerable. if immediately begun, they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season. Whether it will be necessary to augment our land-forces, will be decided by occurrences probably in the course of your session. in the mean time you will consider whether it would not be expedient, for a state of peace as well as of war, so to organise or class the militia, as would enable us on any sudden emergency; to call for the services of the younger portions, unincumbered with the old and those having families. upwards of three hundred thousand able bodied men, between the ages of 18. &amp; 26. years, which the last Census shews we may now count within our limits, will furnish a competent number for offence or defence, in any point where they may be wanted, and will give time for raising regular forces, after the necessity of them shall become certain and the reducing to the early period of life all it’s active service, cannot but be desireable to our younger citizens of the present as well as future time, inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced age, a quiet &amp; undisturbed repose in the bosom of their families. I cannot then but earnestly recommend to your early consideration the expedience of so modifying our militia system as, by a separation of the more active part from that which is less so, we may draw from it, when necessary, an efficient corps, fit for real and active service, &amp; to be called to it in regular rotation.  
Considerable provision has been made under former authorities from Congress, of materials for the construction of ships of war of 74. guns. these materials are on hand, subject to the further will of the legislature.  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms &amp; ammunition is also submitted to your determination.  
Turning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong I congratulate you on the liberation of our fellow citizens who were stranded on the coast of Tripoli, &amp; made prisoners of war. in a government bottomed on the will of all, the life &amp; liberty of every individual citizen becomes interesting to all. in the treaty therefore which has concluded our warfare with that state an article for the ransom of our citizens has been agreed to. an operation by land, by a small band of our countrymen, &amp; others engaged for the occasion, in conjunction with the troops of the Ex-Bashaw of that country, gallantly conducted by our late Consul Eaton, and their succesful enterprise on the city of Derne, contributed doubtless to the impression which produced peace: and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities of which the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli would have availed themselves, to emulate the acts of valour exhibited by their brethren in the attack of the last year. reflecting with high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions permitted in the late Mediterranean service, I think it would be an useful encouragement, as well as a just reward to make an opening for some present promotion, by enlarging our peace establishment of captains &amp; Lieutenants.  
With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently explained. but friendly discussions with their Ambassador recently arrived, and a mutual disposition to do whatever is just &amp; reasonable, cannot fail of dissipating these. So that we may consider our peace, on that coast generally, to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that sea.  
The law providing for a Naval peace establishment fixes the number of frigates which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace: and prescribes that they shall be manned by not more than two thirds of her complement of seamen &amp; ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may be trusted to two thirds only of their proper complement of men must depend on the nature of the service on which she is ordered. that may sometimes for her safety, [or so] as to ensure her object, require her fullest complement. in adverting to this subject Congress will perhaps consider whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion in this case would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the whole service, rather than by the number of vessels. occasions oftner arise for the emploiment of small, than of large, vessels: and it would lessen risk, as well as expence, to be authorised to employ them of preference. the limitation suggested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of vessels best adapted to the service.  
Our Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them, with spirit, &amp; others beginning to engage, in the pursuits of agriculture &amp; houshold manufacture. they are becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labor &amp; more certainty than the forest: and find it their interest from time to time to dispose of parts of their surplus &amp; waste lands for the means of improving those they occupy, and of subsisting their families while they are preparing their farms. since your last session the Northern tribes have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut reserve &amp; the former Indian boundary, and those on the Ohio, from the same boundary to the Rapids, &amp; for a considerable depth inland. the Chickasaws and Cherokees have sold us the country between and adjacent to the two districts of Tennissee, and the Creeks the residue of their lands in the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatché. the three former purchases are important, inasmuch as they consolidate disjoined parts of our settled country, and render their intercourse secure: and the second particularly so as, with the small point on the river which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws, it compleats our possession of the whole of both banks of the Ohio, from it’s source to near it’s mouth, and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered for ever safe to our citizens settled &amp; settling on it’s extensive waters. the purchase from the Creeks too has been for some time peculiarly interesting to the state of Georgia. The several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both houses of Congress for the exercise of their respective functions.  
Deputations, now on their way to the seat of government, from various nations of Indians inhabiting the Missouri &amp; other parts beyond the Missisipi, come charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which they are placed with us, of their dispositions to cultivate our peace &amp; friendship and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse with us.  
A state of our progress in exploring the principal rivers of that country, &amp; of the information respecting them hitherto obtained, will be communicated so soon as we shall recieve some further relations which we have reason shortly to expect  
The reciepts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th. day of Sep. last have exceeded the sum of thirteen millions of Dollars, which, with not quite five millions in the treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us, after meeting other demands, to pay nearly two millions of the debt contracted under the British treaty and convention, upwards of four millions of principal of the public debt, &amp; four millions of Interest. these paiments, with those which had been made in three years and an half preceding, have extinguished of the funded debt nearly eighteen millions of principal.  
Congress, by their act of Nov. 10. 1803. authorised us to borrow 1,750,000 Dollars towards meeting the claims of our citizens assumed by the Convention with France. we have not however made use of this authority: because the sum of four millions and an half, which remained in the treasury on the same 30th. day of Sep. last, with the reciepts which we may calculate on for the ensuing year, besides paying the annual sum of eight millions of Dollars, appropriated to the funded debt, &amp; meeting all the current demands which may be expect

On this first occasion of addressing Congress, since, by the choice of my constituents, I have entered on a second term of administration, I embrace the opportunity to give this public assurance that I will exert my best endeavors to administer faithfully the executive department, and will zealously co-operate with you in every measure which may tend to secure the liberty, property, &amp; personal safety of our fellow-citizens, &amp; to consolidate the republican forms &amp; principles of our government.  
In the course of your session, you shall recieve all the aid which I can give for the dispatch of the public business, &amp; all the information necessary for your deliberations, of which the interests of our own country &amp; the confidence reposed in us by others, will admit a communication.

FO THE SENATE AND IIOL&#x27;SE CF  
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE  
UNITED S&#x27;fATFS OF AMERICA.  
AT a moment when the nations of Europe  
are in commotion and arming against each other,  
when those with whom we have principal Inter­  
course are engaged in the general contest, and  
when the countenance of some of them towards  
our peaceable country threatens that even that may  
not be unaffected by what is passing on the gene­  
ral thefttre, a meeting of the Representatives of  
the Nation in both Houses of Congress has become  
more than usually desirable. Coming from every  
section of our country, they bring with them the  
sentiments and the information of the whole, and  
will be enabled to give a direction to the public af­  
fairs which the will and the wisdom of the whole  
will approve and support.  
In taking a view of the state of our country, we  
in the first place notice the late affliction of two of  
our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times  
has occasionally visited our shores. Providence  
in his goodness gave it an early termination on this  
occasion, and lessened the number of victims  
which have usually fallen before it. In the course  
of the s( veal visitations by this elisease, it has ap­  
peared that it is strictly local, incident to cities  
and on the tiee waters only, incommunicable in  
the country either by persons under the disease, or  
by goods carried from diseased places ; that its ac­  
s is with the autumn, and it disappears with  
the early frosts. These restrictions within narrow  
limits oi time and space give security even to our  
maritime cities, during three-fourths of the year,  
and to the country always. Although from these  
facts it appears unnecessary, yet, to satisfy the  
fears of foreign nations, and cautions on their  
part not to be complained of ma danger whose li­  
mits are yet unknown to them, I have strictly en­  
ioined on the officers at the head of the customs to  
certify with exact truth, for every vessel sailing  
for a foreign port, the state of health respecting  
this fever which prevails at the place from which  
she sails. Under every motive from character and  
duty to certify the truth, I have no doubt they  
have faithfully executed this injunction. Much  
real injury has however been sustained from a pro­  
pensity to identify with this endemic, and to call  
by the same name, fevers (if very different kinds  
which have been known at all times, and in all  
countries, and never have been placed among  
those deemed contagious. As we advance in our  
knowledge of this disease, as facts develope the  
source from which individuals receive it, the State  
authorities charged with the care of the public  
health, and Congress with that ofthe general com­  
merce, will become able to regulate with effect  
their respective functions in these departments.  
The burthen of Quarantines is felt at home as well  
as abroad; their efficacy merits examination. Al­  
though the health laws of the states should be  
found to need no present revisal by Congress, yet  
commerce claims that their attention be ever  
wake to them.  
Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign  
relations has considerably changed, Our edasts  
have been infested, and our harbors watched by  
private armed vessels, some of them without  
commissions, some with illegal commissions,  
others with those of legal form, but committing  
piratical acts beyond the authority of their com­  
missions. They have captured in the very en­  
trance of our harbours as well as on the high seas,  
not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade  
with us, but our own also. They have earned  
them off under pretence of legal adjudication ;  
but not daring to approach a court of justice, they  
have plundered and sunk them by the way, in ob  
scure places, where no evidence could arise against  
them, maltreated the crews, and abandoned them  
in boats in the open sea, or on desert shores, with­  
out food or covering. These enormities appearing  
to be unreached by any control of their sovereigns,  
I found it necessary to equip a force, to cruise  
within our own sr-as, to arrest all vessels of these  
descriptions found hovering on our coasts, within  
the limits of the gulf stream, and to bring the  
offenders in for trial as pirates. y  
The same system of hovering on our coasts and  
harbours, under colour of seeking enemies, has  
been also carried on by public armed ships, to the  
:t annoyance and oppression of our commerce.  
New principles too have been interpolated into the  
law of nations, founded neither injustice nor the  
Usage or acknowledgment of nations. According  
to these a belligerent takes to itself a commerce  
with its own enemy, which it denies to a neutral,  
on the ground of its aiding that enemy in the war.  
But reason revolts at such an inconsistency, and  
the neutral having equal right with the belligerent  
to decide the question, the interests of our ( onsti­  
tuents, and the duty of maintaining the authority  
of reason, the only umpire between just nations,  
impose on us the obligation of providing an effec­  
tual and determined opposition to a doctrine so in­  
jurious to the rights of peaceable nations. Indeed  
the confidence we ought to have in the justice of  
others, still countenances the hope that a sounder  
view of those rights will of itself induce from every  
belligerent a more correct observance of them.

liations (hiring the former war, for which she had  
formally acknowledged herself responsible, nave  
been refused to be compensated but on conditions  
affecting other claims in no wise connected with  
them. Yet the same practices are renewed in the  
present war, and are already of great amount.  
On the Mobille our commerce passing through that  
river continues to be obstructed by arbitrary du­  
ties and vexatious searches. Propositions for ad­  
justing amicably the boundaries :.f Louisiana have  
not been acceded to, While, however, the right is  
unsettled, we have avoided changing the state of  
things, by taking new posts, or strengthening  
ourselves in the disputed territories, in the hope  
that the other power would nor, by a contrary con­  
duct, oblige us to meet their example, and endan­  
ger conflicts of authority, the issue of which may  
not be easily controlled. But in this hope we have  
now reason to lessen our confidence. Inroads have  
been recently made into the territories of Orleans  
and the Mississippi, our citizens have been seized  
and their property plundered in the very parts of  
the former which had been actually delivered up by  
Spain, and this by the regular officers and soldiers  
of that government. I have therefore found it ne­  
cessary at length to give orders to our troops on  
that frontier to be in readiness to protect our ci i­  
zens and to repel by arms nny similar aggressions  
in future. Other details, necessary for your full  
information of the state of things between this  
country and that, shall be the subject of another  
communication. In reviewing these injuries from  
some of the belligerent powers, the moderation,  
the firmness and the wisdom of the legislature will  
all be called into action. We ought still to hope  
that time and a more correct estimate of interest  
as well as of character will produce the justice we  
are bound to expect. But should any nation de­  
ceive itself by false calculations, and disappoint that  
expectation, wemustjoinin the unprofitable contest,  
of trying which party can do the other he most  
harm. Some e&lt;f these injuries may perhaps admit a  
peaceable remedy. Where that is competent it is al­  
ways the most desirable. But some of them are  
of a nature to be met by force only, and all of them  
may lead to it I cannot therefore but recommend  
such preparations as circumstances call for. The  
first object is to place our sea port towns out ofthe  
danger of insult. Measures have been already taken  
for furnishing them with heavy cannon for the ser­  
vice of such land batteries as may make a part of  
their defence against armed vessels approaching  
them. In aid of these&#x27;it is desirable we should  
have a competent number of gun-boats, and the  
number to be competent must be considerable. If  
immediately begun, they may be in readiness for  
service at the opening of the next season. Whe­  
ther it will be necessary to augment our land forces,  
will be decided by occurrences probaoly in the  
course of your session. In the mean time you will  
consider whether it would not be expedient, for a  
state of peace as well as of war, so to organise or  
class the militia, as would enable US on any sudden  
emergency, to call for the services of the younger  
portions, unincumbered with the old and those hav­  
ing families. Upwards of three hundred thousand  
able bodied men, between the ages of eighteen and  
twenty-six years, which the last census shews we  
may now count within our limits, will furnish a  
competent number for offence or defence, in any  
point where they may be Wanted, and will give time  
for raising regular forces after the necessity of them  
shall become certain ; and the reducing to the ear­  
ly period of life all its active service cannot but be  
desirable to cur younger citizens, of the present  
as well as future times hi tsrtiuch as it engages to  
them in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed  
repose in the bosom of their families. I cannot then  
but earnestly recommend to your early considera­  
tion the expediency of so modifying our militia sys­  
tem as, by a separation ofthe more active pan from  
that which is less so, we may draw from it, when  
necessary, an efficient corps, fit for real and active  
service, and to be called to it in regular rotation.  
Considerable provision has been made under for­  
mer authorities Irom Congress, of materials for the  
construction of ships of war of seventy four guns.  
These materials are on hand subject to the further  
will of the legislature.  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of  
arms and ammunition is also submitted to your de­  
termination.  
Turning from these unpleasant views of violence  
and wrong, I congratulate you on the liberation of  
our fellow-citizens who were stranded on the coast  
of Tripoli and made prisoners of war. In a govern.  
ment bottomed on fhe will of all, the life and liber­  
ty of every individual citizen become interesting to  
all. In the treaty therefore which has concluded  
our warfare with that state an article for the ran­  
som of our citizens has been agreed to. An ope­  
ration by land, by a small band of our country­  
men, and others engaged for the occasion, in con­  
junction with the troops of the Ex-Bashaw ol that  
country, gallantly condu6tcd by our late consul  
Eaton, and their successful enterprise on the cit)  
of Derne, contributed dcubtless to the impression  
which produced peace, and the conclusion of this  
prevented Opportunities of which the officers  
and men of our squadron destined flor Tripoli,  
would have availed themselves, to emulate the acts  
  
o  
of the last year. Reflecting with high satisfaction on the distin­  
guished bravery displayed whenever occafions permitted in the  
late Mediterranean service, I think ii would be-an useful encou­  
ragement, as well as a just reward to make an Opening for some  
present promotion by enlarging our peace establishment of Cap­  
tains and Lieutenants.  
With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet  
sufficiently explained, but friendly discussions with their am­  
bassador recently arrived, and a mutual disposition to do what­  
ever is just and reasonable cannot fail of dissipating these. So  
that we may consider our peace on that coast, generally, to be on  
as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding tune. Still  
it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole­  
of our force from that sea.  
The law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the  
number of frigates which shall be kept in constant service in  
time of peace ; and prescribes that they shall be manned by not  
more than two thirds of their complement of seamen and ordinary  
seamen. Whether a frigate may trusted to two thirds only of  
her proper complement of men must depend on the nature ofthe  
service on which she is ordered. That may sometimes for her  
safety, as well as to ensure her object, require her fullest com­  
plement, in adverting to this subject, Congress will perhaps  
consider whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion  
in this case would not be by the number of seamen which may be  
employed in the whole service, rather than by the number of ves­  
sels. Occasions oftener arise for the employment of small, than  
of large vessels ; and it would lessen risk as well as expense, to  
be authorised to employ them of preference. The limitation sug­  
gested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of ves­  
sels best adapted to the service.  
Our Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them wfth spi­  
rit, and others beginning to in the pursuits of agriculture  
and household manufacture. They are becoming sensible that  
the earth yields subsistence with less labor than the forest, and  
find it their interest from time to time to dispose of parts of their  
surplus and waste lands for the means of mi: roving those they  
occupy, and of subsisting their families while they are preparing  
their farms. Since your last session, the northern tribes have  
sold to us the lands between the Connecticut reserve and the for­  
mer Indian boundary, and those on the Ohio, from the same  
boundary to the rapids, and for a considerable depth inland. &#x27;J he  
Chickasiws and Cherokees have sold us the country between and  
adjacent to the two districts of Tenncsee, and the Creeks the re­  
sidue of their lands in the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofau­  
hatehe. The three former purchases are important, inasmuch  
as they consolidate disjoined parts of our settled country, and ren­  
der their intercourse secure ; and the second particularly so as,  
with the small point on the river which we expect is by this time  
ceded by ihe Piankeshaws, it compleats our possession of the  
whole of both banks of the Ohio, from its source to near its  
mouth, and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered fore­  
ver safe to our citizens settled and serving on its extensive wa­  
ters. The purchase from the Creeks too has been for some time  
particularly interesting to the state of Georgia.  
The several treaties which have been mentioned will be sub­

ng so.  
On this first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the  
choice of my constituents, I have entered on a second term of  
administration, I embrace the opportunity to give this public as­  
surance that I will exert my best endeavors to administer faith­  
fully the Executive Department, and will zealously co-operate  
with you in any measure which may tend to secure the liberty,  
property&quot;, and personal safety of our fellow-citizens, and to con­  
solidate ihe republican forms and principles cf our government.  
In the course of your session you shall receive all the aid  
which I can give for the dispatch of the public business, and all  
the information necessary for your deliberations of which the in­  
terests of our own country, and the confidence reposed in us by  
others, will admit a communication.  
TH; JEFFERSON.

To the Senat. and Houfe of Refirrfntjtivce of the United  
States of America.  
AT a moment when the nations of Europe  
m:c in commotion andarming againlt each other,  
w ren thofe with whom we have principal inter­  
enurfe are engaged in the general conteft, and  
when the countenance of fomeof them towards  
otir peaceable country threatens that event that  
may not be unaffedted hv what is pa fling on the  
general theatre, a meeting of the Representa­  
tives of the Nation in both Houfes of Congrefs  
has become more than ufuaily deftrable. Com­  
&#x27;«? fioni every fection ol our country* they  
bring with them the Sentiments and the infor­  
mation of the whole, and will he enabled to give  
a direction to the punlic affairs which the will  
and the wifdom of the whole will approve and  
fupport.  
in talcing a view of the fta»e of our country,  
we in the firft place notice the late afllidlion of  
two of our cities under the fatal fever which in  
latter times has occ.tfionally vifited our (Korea.  
Providence in his goodnefs gave it an early ter­  
mation oil this otcaflon, and leflened the mini,  
herofvtdiims which have ufuaily fallen before  
it. In theeourfe of the fcveral violations by  
this difeafe, it has appeared that it is flridlly lo­  
cal, incident to cities and on the tide waters on­  
ly, nicommunit able in the counter either by  
per funs under the difeafe, or by goods carried  
from difcafid places ; that itsaccefs is with the  
autumn, and it difappenrs with the early froft-*.  
Thcfc rcflridtirns within narrow limits of time  
and fpace give fecurity even to our maritime ci­  
ties, during three-fourtho of the year, and to&#x27;he  
country always. Although from thefe fa,‘ts it  
appears unnecefTary, vet, to fatisfy the fear*  
ot foreign nations, and cautions on their put  
not to be complained of in a danger whole li­  
mits are yet unknown to them, I have ftridlly  
enjoined on the officers at the head of the cut&#x27;­

0 hcrpovvci would n e, by a contrary conduct, I  
oblige us to meet their example, and endanger  
conflicts ,,f authority, the ifltie of which may  
not he eafily controlled. But in this hope we  
time now reafon toleflen our confidence. In­  
roads l ive been recently made into the territo­  
ries of Orleans and the MiTiflippi, our citizens  
| have been feized and their property plundered  
in the very parts of the former which had been  
actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the  
regular officers and foltHers of that government.  
1 have therefore found it neceflary at length to  
give orders to our troops on that frontier to be  
&quot;» rc;,(linefs to protect our citizens and to repel  
by arms any fimilar aggreflions in future. Other  
details, ticceflary for your full information of the  
(bite of things between this country and that,  
(hall be the fubjeift of another communication.  
In reviewing thefe injuries from fome of the  
belligerent powers, the moderation, the fi m­  
nefs and the wifdom of the lc iflature will all

that time and a more correift eftimate of inte-elt  
as well as of character, will oroduce the juftice  
we are bound to expea. Big (hould any nati­  
on deceive itfelf by falfe calculations, and dif­  
appoint that expedlation, we mnft join in the  
unprofitable conteft, of trying which party can  
do the other the moft harm. Some of thefe in­  
juries may perhaps admit a peaceable rerr.e tv.  
Where that is competent it is always the rroft  
dcfirable. But fome of them are of a nature o

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
United States of America.  
At a moment when the nations of Europe are in  
commotion and awning against each other, when  
those with whom we have principal intercourse are  
engaged in the general contest, and when the coun­  
tenance of some of them towards our peaceable coun­  
try threatens that even that may not be unaffected bv  
what is passing on the general theatre, a meeting of  
the Representatives of the nation in both Houses of  
Congress has become more than usually desirable.—  
Coming from every section o! our country, they bring  
with them the sentiments and the information of the  
whole, and will be enabled to give a direction to the  
publicF affiirs which the will and the wisdom of the  
whole will approve and support.  
In taking a view of the state of our country, we in  
the first place notice the late affliction of two of our  
cities under the fatal fever which in latter times has  
occasionally visited our shores. Providence in his  
  
goodness gave it :in early termination on this occasion,  
ami lessened the number of victims which have usual­  
ly fallen before it. In the course of the several visi­  
tations by this disease, it has appeared that it is strict­  
ly local, incident to the cities and on the tide waters  
only, incommunicable in the country either by per­  
sons under the disease, or by goods carried from  
diseased places; that its access is with the autumn,  
and it disappears with the early frosts. These re­  
strictions within narrow limits of time and space,  
give security even to our m tratimu cities, during  
three-fourths of the year, and to the country always.  
Although from these facts it appears unnecessary,  
yet, to satisfy the (cars of foreign nations, and cauti­  
ons on their port not to be complained of in a danger  
whose limits are vet unknown tothem,I have strictly  
enjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to  
certify with exact truth, for every vessel sailing for  
a foreign port, the state of health respecting this fe­  
ver, which prevails at the place, from which she  
sails. Under every motive from character and duty  
to certify the truth, 1 have no doubt they have faith­  
fullv executed this injunction. Much real injury has  
however been sustained from a propensity to identi­  
fy with this endemic, and to call by the same name,  
fevers of very different kinds which have been  
known at all times and in all countries, and never  
have been placed among those deemed contagious.  
As we ndv nice in our knowledge of this disease, as  
facts develope the source from which individuals re­  
ceive it, the state authorities charged with the care  
of the publick health, and Congress with that of the  
general commerce, will become able to regulate with  
effect their respective functions in these departments.  
The burthen of quarantines is felt at home as well as  
abroad ; their efficacy merits examination. Altho&#x27;  
the health laws of the states should be found to need  
no present revisal by Congress, yet commerce claims  
that their attention be ever wake to them.  
Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign re­  
lations has considerably changed. Our coasts have  
hern infested, and our harbours watched by private  
armed vessels, some of them without commission,  
son.-.- with illegal commissions, others with those of  
illegal form, but committing piratical acts beyond  
the authority of their commissions. They have  
captured in the very entrance of our harbours as well  
ns on the high seas, not only the vessels of our friends  
coining to trade with us, but our own also. They  
carried them off under pretence of legal adjudication;  
but not daring to approach, a court of justice, they  
have plundered and sunk them by the way, in ob­  
scure places, where no evidence could arise against  
them, maltreated the crews, and abandoned them in  
boats in the open sea, or on desal t shores, without  
food or covering. These enormities appearing to be  
unreached by any controul of their sovereigns, I  
found it necessary to equip a force, to cruise within  
cur own se ts, to arrest all vessels of these desefipti­  
ons found hovering on our coasts, within the limits of  
the gulf stream, and to bring the offenders in for tri­  
al as pirates.  
The same system of hovering on our coasts and  
harbours, under colour of seeking enemies, has been  
also carried on by publick armed ships, to the great  
annoyance and oppression of our commerce. New  
principles too have been interpolated into the law of  
nations, founded neither injustice nor the usage nor  
acknowledgment of nations. According to these a  
belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its own  
enemy, which it denies to a neutral, on the ground  
of its aiding that enemy in the war. But reason re­  
volts at such an inconsistency, and the neutral hav­  
ing equal right with the belligerent to decide the  
question, the interests of our constituents, and the  
duty of maintaining the authority of reason, the only  
umpire between just nations, impose on us the obli­  
gation of providing an effectual and determined oppn.  
lition to a doctrine so injurious to the rightsof peace­  
able nations. Indeed the confidence we ought to  
have in the justice of others, still countenances the  
hope that a sounder view of those rights will of itself  
induce from every belligerent a more correct obser­  
vance of them.  
  
W it!i bp-iin our negotiations for a settlement of  
differences h ive not had a satisfactory issue. Spoli­  
ations during the former war, for winch she had ac­  
knowledged herself responsible, have been re fused to  
be compensated but on conditions affecting other  
claims in no wise connected with them. Vet the  
same practices are renewed in the present war, and  
Ere already of great amount. On the Mobile our  
commerce passing through that river continues to he  
-obstructed by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches.  
Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries  
-of Louisiana have not been acceded to. While,  
however, the right is unsettled, we have avoided  
changing the state of tilings, by taking new posts, or  
strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories,  
-in the hope that the other power would not, by a  
contrary conduct, oblige us to meet their example,  
»nd endaiiger conflicts of authority, the issue of  
■which may not he easily contrculed. But in this  
hope we have now reason to lesson our confidence.  
Inroads have been recently made into tile territories  
of Orleans and the Mississippi, our citizens have  
been seized, and their property plundered ill the  
■very parts of the former which had been actually de­  
livered up by Spain, and this by the regular officers  
and soldiers of that government, I have therefore  
pound it necessary at. length to give orders to our  
troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect  
’ «iur citizens and to repel by arms any similar ag­  
gressions in future. Other details, necessary for  
your full information of the state of things between  
this country and that, shall be the subject of another  
communication, in reviewing these injuries from  
some of the bilhgerent |wiwers, the moderation, the  
firmness and the wisdom of the legislature will all be  
called into action. We ought still to hope that time  
iuu}a more correct estimate of interests as well  
r.sof character will produce the justice we are  
bound to expect. But should any nation deceive  
it-elf bv false calculations, and disappoint that ex­  
pectation, we must join in tire unprofitable contest  
  
of trying which party can do the other the most harm.  
Sotne of these injuries may perhaps admit a  
peaceable remedy. Where that is competent it is al­  
ways the most desirable. Rut some of them are  
ot a nature to be met by force only, ami all of them  
may lead to it. I cannot therefore but vecommend  
such preparations as circumstances call for. The  
first object is to place our sea port towns out of the  
danger of insult. Measuies have been already taken  
for furnishing them with heavy cannon for the service  
of such land batteries as may make a part of their  
defence against armed vessels approaching them.—  
In aid of these it is desirable we should have a com­  
petent number of gun-boats, and the number to be  
competent must be considerable. If immediately be­  
gun, they may be in readiness for service at the  
opening of the next season. Whether it will be ne­  
cessary to augment our land forces, will be decided  
by occurrences probably in the course of your session.  
In the mean time you will consider whether it would  
not be expedient, for a state of peace as well as of  
war, so to organise or class the militia, as would  
enable us on any sudden emergency, to Call for the  
services of the younger portions, unincumbered with  
the old and those having families. Upwards of three  
hundred thousand able bodied men, between the ages  
of 18 ic twenty-six years, which the last census shews  
we may now count within our limits, will furnish a  
competent number for offence or defence, in any  
point where they may be wanted, and will give time  
for raising regular forces after the necessity of them  
shall become certain ; and the reducing to the early  
period of life all its active service cannot but be de­  
sirable to our younger citizens, of the present as well  
as future times, inasmuch as it engages to them in  
more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose  
in the bosom of tilth- families. I cannot then but ear­  
nestly recommend to your early consideration the ex­  
pediency of so modifying our militia system as, by a  
separation of the more active part from that which  
isMess so, we may draw from it, when necessary, an  
efficient corps, fit for real and active service, and to  
be called to. it in regular rotation.  
Considerable provision has been made under for­  
mer authorities from Congress,&#x27;of materials for the  
construction of *hips of war of seventy four guns.  
These materials are on hand subject to the farther  
will of the legislature.  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of  
arms and ammunition is also submited to your deter­  
mination.  
  
l timing from these unpleasant views of violence  
and UT.iii,;, I congratulate you on tlie liberation of  
our fellow citizens who were stranded on the coast  
of Tripoli and made prisoners of war. In a govern­  
ment bottomed on the. will of all, the life and liberty  
of every individual citizen become interesting to all.  
In the treaty therefore which lias concluded our  
warfare with that state an article for the ransom of  
our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by  
land by a small&#x27;band of our countrymen, and others  
engaged for the occasion, in conjunction with the  
troops ot the Ex-Bashaw of that country, gal­  
lantly conducted by cur late consul Eaton, and  
their successful anterprize on the city of Dcrne, con­  
tributed doubtless to the impression which produced  
peace, and the conclusion ot this prevented opportu­  
nities of which the officers and tnen of our squadron  
destined for 1 ripoli, would have availed themselves,  
to emulate the acts of valour exhibited by their bre­  
1,1,011 in the attack of the last year. ’ Reflecting  
with high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery  
displayed whenever occasions permitted in the late  
Mediterranean service, I think it would be an useful  
encouragement, as well as a just reward to make an  
opening fur some present promotion by enlarging our  
peace establishment of Captains and &#x27;Lieutenants.  
With Tunis some misunderstanding have arisen  
not yet sufficiently explained, but friendly discussions  
with their ambassadcur recently arrived, and a  
mutual disposition to do whatever is just and reason­  
able cannot fail of dissipating these. So that we may  
consider our peace on that coast, generally, to be oil  
as sound a footing ns it has been at anv preceding  
time. Still it will not be expedient to withdraw im­  
mediately the whole of our force from that sea.  
The law providing for a naval peace establishment  
fixes the number of frigates which shall be kept in  
constant service in time of peace and prescribes that  
they shall be manned by not more than two thirds of  
their complement of seamen and ordinary seamen.  
Whether a frigate may be trusted to two thirds only  
of her proper complement of men must depend on  
the nature of the service on which she is ordered.  
That may sometimes for her safety, as well as to  
insure her object, require her fullest complement.  
In adverting to this subject. Congress will perhaps  
consider whether the best limitation on the execu­  
tive discretion in this Case would not be by the num­  
ber of seamen which may be employed in the whole  
service, rather than by the number&#x27;of vessels. Oc­  
casions oftener arise for the employment of small,  
than large vessels ; and it would lessen risk as well of  
as expense, to be authorised to employ them of pre­  
ference. The limitation suggested by the number of  
se.linen would admit a selection of vessels best adapt­  
ed to the service.  
  
t.»ur Indian neighbours are advancing, many of  
them with vpirit, and others beginning to engage in  
the pursuits of agriculture and household m.uiutac­  
ttire, They are becoming sensible that the earth  
yields subsistence with less labour than the forest,  
and hnd it to their interest from time to time to dis­  
pose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the  
means of improving those they occupy, and of subsis­  
ting their families while they are preparing their  
tu rns, Since your last session, the northern tribes  
have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut  
reserve and the former Indian boundary, and those  
on the Ohio, from the same boundary to the rapids,  
and for a considerable depth inland.&#x27; The Chicka­  
saw&#x27;s and Cherokees base sold us the country be­  
tween and adjacent to the two districts of Tennessee,  
and the Creeks the residue of their lands in the fork,  
of Ocmulgee up to the Uieofauhatch. The three  
former purchases are important, inasmuch as they  
consolidate adjacent parts of our settled country, and  
render their intercourse secure; and the sec &gt;nd parti­  
cularly so as, with the small point on the river which  
we expect is by this time ceded by the Tiankeshaws,  
it compleats our possession of tiie whole of both banks  
of the Ohio, from its source to near its mouth, and  
the navigation of that river is thereby rendered fore­  
ver safe to our citizen; settled and settling on its ex­  
tensive waters. The purchase from the Creeks too  
has been for some time particularly interesting to  
the state of Georgia.  
The several treaties which have been mentioned  
will be submitted to both Houses of Congress fur the  
exercise of their respective functions.  
Deputations now cr. their way to the seat of go­  
vernment, from various nations of Indians, inhabit­  
ing the Missouri and other parts beyond the Mis­  
sissspi, come charged with assurances of their satis­  
faction with the new relations in which thev are plac­  
ed with us, of their disposition to cultivate our  
peace and friendship, and their desire to enter into  
commercial intercourse with us. A state of our pro­  
gress in exploring the principal rivers of that coun­  
try and oi the information respecting them hitherto  
ontained, will be communicated so soon as we shall  
receive some further relations which we have reason  
shortly to expect.  
The receipts at the treasury during the vear end­  
ing on the Sutli day of September last have exceed­  
ed the sum of thirteen millions of dollars, which,  
with not quite live million* io the treasury at the be­  
ginning of the year, have enabled us alter meeting  
  
othcf demands, to psy nearly two millions of the&#x27;  
debt contracted under the British treaty and conven­  
tion,. upward^

To the Senate and Houfe of Reprofentatives of the United States of dmericas g  
AT_a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion ard arming  
againft euch other, when thofe with whom we have principal interconrl: are  
emgaged in the general contelt, and when the countenance of fome of them to­  
watds aur peaceable country threatens that even that may not be unaifelted by €  
what is pafling on the general theatre, a mecting of the Reprelentatives of the  
Nation in both Houfes of Congrefs has become more than ufuaily defirable.  
Coming from every fection of our country, they bring with them the fentim­  
ents &amp; the information of the whole, and will be enabled to give a direclion tothe &amp;  
public affairs which the will and the wildomofthe whole willapprove and [upport. g  
. In taking a view of the ftate of our country, we in the firlt place notice ;!  
the late afllition of two of our cities under the fatal fever, which in latter times  
has occafionally vifited our fhores. Providence in kis goodnels gave it an early  
termination on thisoccafion, and leffened the number of victims which have  
ufually fallen before it. In the courfe of the feveral vifirations by this difeale, &amp;  
it has appeared that it is {tritly local, incident to cities and on the tidg wat­  
ers only, incommunicable in the country either by perfons under the dileale, or  
by goods carrizd from difealed nlaces : that its acrefs is with the autumn, and  
it difappaars with the early frofts, Thefe reftrittions within nagrow limits of  
time and fpace give fecurity even to our maritime cities, during three fourths b  
of the year, and to the country always. = Although from thefe fa&amp;s it appears  
unneceflary ; yet, to farisfy the fears of foreign nations, and cautions on their  
part not to be complained of in a danger whole limits are yet unkaown to  
them, 1 have trictly enjoined on the officers at the head of the cultoms to cers  
tify with exa’t truih, for every veilel failing for a foreign port, the ftare ofy  
health rcfpe&amp;i:}&#x27;g this fever which prevails at the place from which fhe fails, ¥  
Under every motive from charaéter and duty to certify the truth, I haveno  
doubt they have fuithfuly execoted thisinjunétion. Much real injury has how. &amp;  
ever been fuftained from a propenfity to identify with this epidémic, and to é  
call by the fame name, fevers of very different kinds which have been known  
at all times and in all countries, and never have been placed #mong thofe deem- g  
ed contagious. As we a«zvzmce in our knowledge of this dileafe, as faéls dev- %4  
elope the fource from which individuals receive it, the State authorities charg- §  
el with the care of the public health, and Congrefs with that of the general &amp;  
commerce, will become able to regulate wirh effet their refpective funélions in &amp;  
thefe departments.—The burthien of quarantines is felt at home as well as a. £  
broad ; their efficacy merits examination. Although the health laws of the &quot;3  
{tates fhould be tound to need no prefent reviful by Congrefs, yet commerce ¢,  
claims that their attention thoul} be ever awake to them. Z  
&quot; Since our laft meeting the alpett of our foreign relations has confiderably A  
cﬁanged. Out coalts have been infefted, and cur harbors watched by priva(c ﬁ  
armed veflels, fome of them without commiflions, fome with illegai commil- A  
fions, others with thofe of legal form, but commitiiny piratical ats beyond ¢  
the authority of their commi{lions, They have captured in the very entrance %  
of our harbors as well as on the high feas, not only the veflils of our friends ¢  
coming to trade with us, but our own alfo, They have carried them off under ¢  
pretence of legal adjudication ; but not daring to approacha court of juftice, 5  
tS-ey have plundcred and funk them by the way, in obfenre places, where noev- §  
idence couldarife azainft them,maltreated thecrews,and abandoned them in boats g  
on the open fea, or on defert fhores, without food or coverina,—~Thefe enor- y‘  
mities appearing to be unreached by any control of their fovercigns, | found %  
it néceﬂgry to equip a force, to cruife within our own feas, to arrelt ail veflels 4  
of thefe defcriptions found hovering on our coalts, wirhin the limits of the é  
gulph ftream, and bring the offenders in for trial as pirates. ¥  
- Thé fame fyflem of hovering on our coaits and harbors, under color of  
{ecking enemies, has been alfo carried on by public armed (hips, to the great i  
annoyance and oppreflion of our commerce. New principles toa have been  
interpolated into the law of nations; founded neither in juftice nor the ufage b  
or ackriowledgement of nations. According to thele a belligerent takes toit­  
felf a&#x27; commerce with its own enemy; which it deniesto a neutral, on the  
ground of its aiding that enemy in the war, But realon revolts at fuch incon- %  
fiftency, and the neutral having equal right with the belligerent to decide the  
Teﬂion, the interefts of our conflituents, and the duty of maintaining the au­  
thority of reafon, the only umpire between juit nations, impofe on us the&#x27;ob­  
i gation of providing an effeGual and determined oppofition to a doctrine fo 2  
in urious to the rights of peaceable nations. Indeed the confidence we ought  
to lave in the juftice of others, {till countenances the hope that a founder view  
of ;bg‘;ggﬂ will of itfelf induce from every belligerent a morccorred oblerva £  
ance of them.  
With Spain our negociations for a fettlement of differences have not had g  
a fatisfalliory iffue. Spoilations clm;inbpi the former war, for which fhe had ?  
formaly acknowledged herfelf refponfible, have been refufed to be compenfat ¥  
;3 but on_conditions,, alfeéling other claims in no wile connected with them. ¥  
Yet: the fame praltices are renewed in the prefent war, and are already of  
great amount. On the Mobileour commerce pafling throughthat river continues  
to bé obftrulied by arbitrary duties and vexatious f2arches. Propofitions for  
sdj-ﬂwi amicably the boundaries of Louifiana have not yet been acceded to.  
While, however, the right is unfettled, we have uoidel changing the ftate

of things by taking new pofts or flrengthening ourfelves in the dilputed territs  
ories, in the hope that the other power would ndt, by a contrary conduct, ob­  
&#x27;life us to meet their example, and endanget conflicts of authority, the illue  
~of which may not be eafily controled. But in this hope we have now reafon to  
leflen our confidence, Inroads have been recently made into the territories of |  
~Orleans and the Mifliflippi, our citizens have been {eized and their property  
plundered in the very parts of the former which had been aétually delivered up  
by Spain, and this by the regular officers and (old®rs of that government. [  
have therefoie found it neceflary at length to give orders to our troops on that  
{rontier, to be in readinefs to protett our citizens, and to repel by arms any  
fimilar aggreflions in future.~Other details, neceflary for your full informa­  
tion ol the ftate of things between this country and that, fhall be the fubject of  
another communication, In reveiwing thefe injuries from fome of the bellig­  
erent powers, the moderation, the firmne(s, and the wildom of the Legiflature  
will all be called into aétion. We ought ftill to hope, that time, and a more  
correct eltimate ot interelt as well as of charalter, will produce the juftice we  
are bound to expect. But fhould any nation deceive itlelf by falle calculations,  
and difappoint that expeQation, we mult ‘join in the unprofitable contelt, of  
trying which party can do the other the moft harm. Some of thefe injuries  
may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. Where that is competent, it is al«  
ways the molt defirable. But fome of tgem are of a nature to be met by force  
only, and all of them may lead to it. 1 cannot therefore but recommend  
fuch preparations as circomitances call for. &#x27;Lhe firlt object is to place our  
{ea-port towns out of the danger of infult. Meafures have been already taken  
for I’urni{hing them with heavy cannon for the fervice of fuch land batteries as -  
may make a part of their defence againlt armed veflels approaching them, In  
~aid of thefe it is defirable we fhould have a competent number ol gun.boats  
and the number to be compent, muil be confiderable. It immediately begun,  
they may be in readinefs E)r fervice; at the opening of the next feafon.—  
Whether it will be necellary to augment our land forces, will be decided by  
occurrences, probably in the courfe of your feflion. In the mean time, you  
will confider whether it would not be expedient for a flate of peace, as well ag  
of war, fo to organize or clals the militia, as would enable us on any fudden  
emergency, to call for the fervices of the younger portions, unincumbered with  
“the old, and thofe having familes,  
- Upwards of three hundred thoufand able-bodiéd men, between the ages of  
@ﬁ?’nen ani) twenty-lix years, which the lalt cenfus fhews we may now count  
‘within our limits, will -fursith, a competent number fot oftenice. o defence;  
“in‘any point where they may be Wimcr and will give time for raifing Tegu.  
lar forces after the neceflity of them fhall become certain ; and the reducing to  
the early period of life all its a&amp;ive fervice, cannot but be defirable to our  
younger citizens of the prefent as well as future timeg, inafmuch.as it engages  
to them in more advanced age a quiet and undiltutbed repofe in the bofom of  
their families. 1 cannot then but earneflly recommend to your early confider­  
tion the expediency of fo moditying our militia [yltem as, by a feparation of  
the more active part from that which is lels fo, we may draw from it, when  
neceflary, an efficient corps, fit for real and active fervice, and to be alled to­  
it in regular :otation. |  
Confiderable provifion has been made, under former authorities from  
Congrefs, of materials tor the conftruction of thips of war of feventy-four guns,  
Thele materjals aréon hand, fubjet to the further will of the legiflature.  
An immediate probibition of the exportation of arms and ammunition is  
alfo [ubmirted to your determination.  
~ T&#x27;urning from thefeunpleafant viewsofviolence &amp; wrongs, Icongratulateyow  
on the liberationof our fe!row-&#x27;citizcns, who were ftranded on the coaft of Trip­  
oli, and made prifoners of war. In a government bottomed on the will of all,  
the life and liberty of every individual citizen becomes intcre’ﬂin{: toall. In  
the treaty therefore, which has concluded our warfare with that itate, an arti­  
cle for the ranfom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land,  
by a fmall band of our countrfymcn, and others engaged for the occalion, in  
conjuntion with the troops of the Ex-Bafhaw of that country, gaillantly con.  
duéted by our late conful Eaton, and their fuccefsful enterprize on the city of  
Derne, contribnted doubtlefs to the impreflion which produced peace, and the  
conclufion of this prevented opportunities of ‘which the officers and men of  
our fquadron deftined for Tripoii, would have availed themfelves, to emuilate  
the aéts of valor, exhibited by theiz brethren in the attack of &#x27;he laft year.  
Refle@ing with high fatisfaction on the diltinguilhed bravery difplayed, whena  
ever occahons permitted in the late Mediterranean fervice, I think it would be  
an vfeful encouragement, as well as a jult reward, to make an opening for fome  
prefent promotion, by enlarging our peace eftablilhment of captains and licus  
tenants. . :  
With Tunis fome mifunder{tandings have arifen, not yet fufficiently ex.  
plained, but friendly difcuflions with their ambaflador, recently arrived, and a  
mutuz! difpofition to do whatever is juft and reafonablé, cannot fail of diffipat­  
ing thefe. So that we may confider our peace on that coalt, generally, to be  
on as found a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still it will not  
be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that fea.  
The law providing for a maval peace eftablithment, fixes the number of  
frigates which tha!l be kept in conltant fervice, in time of &#x27;Peace; and prefcribes  
that they fhalt be manned by not more than two thirds of their complement ot  
feamen and ordinary feamen. Whether a frigate may be trufted to twos  
“thirds oply of her proper complement of nien, muit dependon the nature of the  
fervice on which fhe is crdered. That may fometimes for her fafety, as  
well as&#x27;to enfure her obje, require her fullelt complement. - In adverting to  
&#x27; this fubject, Congrefs will perhaps confider whethet the beft limitation on the  
&#x27; Executive dilcretion in this cafe,would not be by the number of feamen which  
! may be employed in the whole fervice, rather than by the number of veflels,  
&#x27; Occafions oftener arife for the employment of mall, than of large veffels ; and

2V the Senate and House  
of Representatives of the  
Unitei States,  
AT. a moment when the na­  
tions of J&amp;rope are in commotion  
j -A(Tinttcach other,when  
those with whomwe have principal  
intercourse are engaged in the gen­  
eral contest, and when the counte­  
nance ot -some of them towards  
our peacahle country threatens  
that even that may not be unaffect­  
ed by what is passing on the ger.e­  
raltheatre, a meeting of the Re­  
presentatives of the Nation in both  
Houses of Congress has become  
wore than usually desireahle.  
Coming from every section of our  
country, they bring with them the  
sentiments and the inibrmation of  
the whole, end will, be enabled to  
cive a direction to the public affairs  
6 . . . . -i j : :r  
which the win ana uic wisuum ui  
the whole will approve and support.  
In taking a view of the state of  
our country, we in the first place  
notice the late affliction of two of  
cur cities under .the fatal fever  
which in latter times has occasion­  
ally visited our shores Providence  
m his goodness gave it an ea;iy  
termination en this occasion, and  
lessened the number of victims  
which have usually fallen before it.  
Ia the course of the several visita  
tions by this disease, it has ap­  
peared that it is strictly local, in­  
cident to cities and cn the tide wh-  
;t?rs enly, incommunicable in  
the country either. by persons, un­  
der the disease orMjV goods car-  
ried from diseased p&#x27;aqes. ; &#x27; that its  
access is with the autumn, and it  
disappears with the early frosts.  
These restrictions wkhin nan ov.  
limits of time and spate give secu­  
rity even to cur maritime cities,  
during three-fourths ct the yer.i  
and to the countrv alwavs. Al  
though from these facts it appears&#x27;  
unnecessary, yet,-to satis ty tht  
fears of foreign nations, awo  
cautions on their part net to bt  
complained of in a danger w hose­  
limits are yet unlcnown to tht-m, I  
have strictly enjoined on the offi  
cers at the head of the customs to&#x27;  
certify with exact truth, fcr every  
vessel sailing for a.-foreign port,  
w the state ot health respecting this  
fever whichprevailsatthe place from  
which she sans. Under evei-y mo­  
tive from chara-.ter Jk dutv to cer  
my me truth, l have no doubtShey  
-have faithfully executed thisiiv.  
junction. Much real injury ha  
however been sustained from  
propensity to identify with this en  
demicand to call by the same  
name, &quot;fevers of very different  
kinds which have been&#x27; known at  
all times, and in all countries, and  
and never have been placed among  
those deemed contagious. As wc  
advance in our knowledge of this j  
msease, as iacts develone the ,  
0. source from which individuals -re  
active it, the State amhoritirs  
charged with the care of the public  
Health, and Congress widi that ol  
the general commerce, will lie­  
come able to regulrte with effect  
their respective fu.nc.bns in these  
department?. The burthen ol  
Quarantines is felt at home as well  
as abroad; their efficacy- merits  
examination. Although the health  
laws of the states should be found  
.to need no present revisal by Gon-  
g ess, yet commerce claims thai  
their &quot;attention be ever awake to  
nee: our ast mect-n; theaspct  
01 u&#x27;d&quot; foreign reladous has coubide-  
  
  
  
rablv changed. Oar coasts have  
  
been - infested, and our harbors  
watched by private anned vessels,  
some of them without commissions,  
some with illegal commissions,  
others with those of legal form,  
but committing piratical acts be­  
yond the authority of their com­  
missions. They have captured in  
the very entrance of our harbours  
as well as on the high seas, not  
only the vessels of our friends  
coming to trade, but our own also.  
They have carried them,off under  
pretence of legal adjudication ; but  
not daring to approach a court of  
justice, they have plundered and  
sunk them by the way, in obscure  
places, where no evidence cculd  
arise against themi maltreated the  
crews &amp; abandoned them in boats ia  
rpin se.i, or desert shores,  
without food or covering. The?  
enormities appearing to be un­  
reached by any control of their so  
vereigns, I found it necessary to e­  
quip a foice, tcfcruisc within our  
own seas, &#x27; to. arrest all vessels of  
tnese cesciripnons-iounu nuvermg  
on our coastfthm the limits of  
the gulf kreatn, and to bring the  
offenders inTor trial as pirates.  
The same svstem oi novermg  
on our coasts and harbours, under  
colour of seeking enemies, has  
been carried on by public armed ;  
ships, to the great annoyance and;  
oppression of our commerce. New j  
principles too have been interpoh- j  
ted into the law of nations found- j  
ed neither injustice nor the usage  
or acknowledgment of nations.  
According to these a belligerent  
takes to itself a commerce with its  
own enemy, which it denies to a  
neutral, on the ground of its aid­  
ing that enemy in the war. But  
reason revolts at such an inconsis­  
tency&quot;, and the neutral havipg equal  
right with the belligerent to decide  
the question, the interests of our  
constituents, and the duty of main­  
taining the authority of reason, the  
only umpire between just nations&#x27;, j  
impose on us the obiijr.ition of pro- i  
viding an effectual and determined  
opposition to a doctrine sc inju­  
rious to the lights of peaceable na­  
tions. Indeed the confidence we  
ou:  
rht to have ia the justice o-  
r.heri, still coiiutemtnccs the hope

renewed in the present war, and  
are already of great amount. On  
ths Mobile our commerce passing  
dirough diat river continues to be ,  
obstructed by arbitrary duties and  
vexatious searches. Propositions  
for adjusting amicably the bounda­  
ries of Louisiana have not been ac­  
ceded to. While, however, the  
right is unsettled, we have avoided  
changing the state of things, by ta­  
king new posts, or strengthening  
jjt&#x27;urselves in the disputed territo  
ries, .in the hope that the other  
power would not, by a contrary  
conduct, oblige ns to meet their  
example, and endanger conflicts  
of authority, the issue of which  
mav not be easdv controled. But .  
in chis hope We have now reason j  
to lessen our confidence. Inroads j  
have been &#x27;recently made into the i  
territories of Orleans and the M is­  
sissippi, our citizens have been  
seized and their property7 plunder­  
ed in the very parts of the for  
mer which had actually been  
delivered up , by Spain, and  
this by the regular officers and sol­  
diers of that government. 1 have  
therefore found it necessary at  
length to give orders to our troops  
oa that frontier to be ia readiness  
  
A to protect our citizens and to repel  
  
by arms, any similar aggressions in  
future. Other details, necessary  
for your full information of the  
state of things between this coun­  
try and that, shH be the subject of  
another communication.&#x27; In re­  
vievyng these injiiries from some  
of the belligerent powers, the mo­  
deration, the firmness and the wis  
dom of the legislature will all be  
called into action. We ought still to  
hope that time &amp; a more correct es­  
timate of interest as wells of cha­  
racter will produce the justice we  
are bound to expect. But should  
any nation deceive itself by false  
calculations, and disappoint that  
expectation, we must join in the  
unprofitable contest, of , trying  
which party can do the other the  
most harm. Some of those inju­  
ries may perhaps admit a peaceable  
remedy. Where that is com­  
petent, it is&quot; always most desira­  
ble But some of them are  
of a nature to be metby force only,  
and all of them mav lead to it. I  
cartnot therefore but recommend  
such preparations as circumstances  
call for. &#x27;lliejnrst object is to place  
our sea port towns out of the dan­  
ger of insultiMeasurcs have been  
already t:ikcn for furnishing them  
with heavy cannon for the service  
Of such l.-.nd batteries as ma&quot; make

should have a competent number

competent mustVbe considerable.

Considerable provision has been  
made under former authorities  
from Congress, of materials for  
the construction cf ships of war  
of seventy four ... guns. These  
materials are on band subject to  
the further will of the Legislature,  
An immediate prohibition of the  
exportation of arms and amuni-

termination.  
Turning from these unpleasant  
views of violence and wrong, I  
congratulate you on the liberation

stranded on the coast of Tripoli  
and made prisoners of war. In a

Lieutenants.  
W&#x27;th Tunis some misunder­  
standings have arisen not yet suffi­  
ciently explained, but friendly dis­  
cussions with their ambassador re­  
cently arrived, and a mutur.l dis­  
positton to do whatever is just and  
reasonable cannot fail of dissipa­  
ting these. So that we may con­  
sider cur peace on that coast, gen­  
erally, to be cu as sound a f.oting  
as it has been at any preceding  
time, Stiii itvill not be expedi­  
ent to withdraw immediately, the  
wnole of our fon e from that sea.  
Hie law providing&#x27; for a naval  
peace establishment fixes the  
numborof frigates which shall be  
lyfipt in constant service in time of  
peace ; and prescribes that they  
shall be manned bv not more than  
two thirds of their-complement of  
seamen and ordinary seamen.  
Whether a f. igate may be trusted  
io two-thirds only of her proper  
com.iiiment of men must depend  
on tl. nature of the service on  
which she is ordered. That may  
sometimes tor tier salet  
as we  
ii  
as to. ensure her object, require  
r.er  
tin?  
:st complement.  
In adver-  
)rtu,-,.s coasiaer wnetrrcr tne best  
limitation on the Executive dis-  
creticn in this case would not be  
by the number ot seaman which ji  
mav beemnloved m the whole ser-  
vice, rather than bv the number !  
&#x27;  
of vessels. Occasions c ftener arise  
the employment ot small, than  
  
oi large vessels anu it wouia ies- i, atea to me funded debt, and meet­  
sen rh.k as well as expence, to b? j; ingrdl the current demands whirh  
  
authorised to employ them oi pre-  
lerence. 1 he limitation suggested  
by the number of seamen w ould  
admit a selection of. vessels best  
adapted to the service.  
Our Indian neighbours are ad  
vancing, many of them with spirit,  
and others beginning to engage m  
the pursuits of agriculture and  
household manufacture. They arc  
becoming sensible that the earth  
yields subsistence with less labour  
than the forest, and find it their  
waste lands for the means of im-  
proving those they occupy, and of  
subsisting their families w hile they  
are prenarinsr their farms. Since  
your last session, the northern  
I tribes have sold to us the lands be-  
tween the Connecticut reserve and  
the former Indian boundary, and  
j those on the Ohio, from the same  
boundary to the rapids, and for a  
considerable depth inland. The  
j Chickasawrs and Chcrokees have  
sold us the country between and  
adjacent to the two districts of  
Tennessee, and the Creeks the re­  
sidue of their lands in the fork of  
Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatche.  
The three former purchases are  
important, inasmuch as they con­  
solidate disjoined parts of our set­  
tled country, and render their in­  
&quot; i  
-ii tercourse secure ; ana tne sc-unu  
:-.y, particularly so, as, with the .nall  
  
point on the river which we expert  
is bv this time ceded by the Pian  
  
Ohio, from its source to near  
its mouth, and the navigation of  
that river is thereby rendered: fore-  
vcr safe to our citizens settletl and  
settliug on its extensive waters.  
tlrThe purchase from the Creeks too  
has been for some time particular-  
, iy interesting to he State of  
Lrecrgia,

been mentioned wui be submitted

- I? the Senate and Utufe of Representatives, of  
the U/nted States of s?/9fr&#x27;*ea.  
Ai a moment when the nAjkms of Ei*­  
rope are in commotion aBi armed a­  
gain it each other, when thofe with whom  
we have principal intercourse are engaged in  
the general conteft, and when the counten­  
ance ct Some ot them towards onr peaceable  
country threatens that -v&#x27;n that may not be  
unaffected by what is palling on the general  
theatre, a meeting of the Representatives of  
the Nation in both Houles ot Congrefs, has  
become more than ufuv y dehrable. Com­  
ing from every lection of our country, they  
bring with them the Sentiments and the in­  
foraiation of the whole, and will be ena­  
biedto g’ve a direction to the public affairs,  
which the will and the wifdom of the whole  
will approve and fupport.  
In taking a review of the ftate of otir  
country, we in the firft place, notice the late  
atliuStion ot two of our cities under the fatal  
lever, which in latter times has occaliofially  
vihted our thores. Providence in his good­  
neis gave it early termination on this occa­  
sion, and leffened the number of victims  
which have ufually fallen before it. In the  
courie of the Several vifkations by this dif­  
eaSe, it has appeared that it is ftrictly local,  
ticident to cities and tide waters only; in­  
* 9  
communicable in the country, either bv per­  
sons under the difeafe, or by goods carried  
from difeaSed places ; that its acceSs is with  
the autumn, and it disappears when the ear­  
ly frofts come. Thefe restrictions, within  
narrow limits of time and Space, gtve Secu­  
rity even to our maratime cities, duHng  
three fourths of the yea/, and to the country -  
always.  
  
Although trom thcie tads it appears tin­  
necetTury, yet to fatisfy the fears of foreign  
nations, ami cautious on their part not to be  
complained of in a danger whole limits are  
yer unknown to them, I h:ve ftrictly enjoin­  
ed on the officers at the head of tlie cuftoms,  
to certify with exact truth, for every velVel  
tailing tor a foreign port, the ftate of health  
refpeding this fever, which prevails at the  
place from which fhe fails ; under every  
motive from character and duty to certify  
the truth, l have no doubt they have faith­  
fully executed this injunction. Much real  
injury, has however been fuftained from a  
propenhty to identify with this epidemic, and  
to call by the fame name, fevers of very dif­  
ferent kinds, which have been known at all  
times, and in ail countries, and never have

As we advance in our knowledge of this dif­  
cafe, or tacts devclope the fo uvee, fro in which  
individuals receive it, the State authorities  
charged with the care of the public health,  
and Congrefs with that of the general com  
merce, will become able to regulate with ef  
fe&amp; their refpe&amp;ive functions in thefe depart  
ments. ike burthen of quarantines is fel  
at home as well as abroad ; their efficacy  
merits examination. Although the health  
law of the States fhould be found to need no  
prelent revilal by Congrels, yet commerce  
claims that their attention fhould ever be a­  
wake to them.  
Since our lail meeting theafped of our for­  
eign relations has contiderably changed. Our  
coafts have been infelted and our harbours  
watched by private armed velVcls, fome of  
them without commiffions, fome of them  
with illegal commiffions, others with thole  
of legal form, but committing piratical ads  
beyond the authority of their commiffions.  
I liey have captured, in the very entrance of ,  
cur harbours, as well as on the high leas,not  
only the vellels of our friends, coming to |  
trade with us, but our own alio. They have  
carried them o.*f under pretence of le­  
gal adjudicatn**., but not daring to approach  
a court of iultice, they have plundered and  
lunk them by the way in obfeure places,  
when no evidence could arife agarnif them,  
uial-trcated the crews anJ abandoned them  
in boats, on the open fca, or on dclcrt fhores  
without food or covering.  
  
TheiWhormities appearing to be unreach­  
J bv anv controul of iheir fovereigns,! found  
t neceiiiry to equip a force, to crude within  
jttr own lea;, to arrell all veflbls of thcie de­  
scriptions found hdveripg on our coaiis.u&#x27;ito­  
tn the limits of the gulpb stream, and to bring  
them in‘for trial*as pirates.  
The fame f) item of liovdringon our coaits  
and harbors, under colour cf ieckihg ene­  
mies, kns alfo been carried on be public arm­  
ed ihips, to the great annoyance and eppref­  
lion of our commerce. New principles too  
have been interpolated into the laws ol na- j  
tions : founded neither in juftice, tier the •  
ufage, or acknowledgment of nations;  
according to thefe a beiigerent takes  
to itfclf a commerce with its own enemy,  
which it denies to a neutral, on the ground of  
its aiding that enemy in the war. Hut rea­  
fon revolts at fuch an inconfiftency—and the  
neutral having equal right with the bcliger­  
ent to decide the queftion, the intcreft of our  
conftituems and the duty of maintaining the  
authority of reafon, the only umpire between  
juft nations, impofe onus the obligation of  
providing an effectual and determined oppo­  
lition to a doctrine fo injurious to the rights  
of peaceable nations.—Indeed the confidence  
we ought to have in the iulticc of others, ftill  
•countenances the hope, that a founder view of  
thole rights, will of itfelf induce from every  
beiigerew, »tnore correct observance of them.  
With Spain our negociations for a fertlement  
of differences have not had a fatisf.ietory if- i  
  
iuc. Spoliations during the former war, lor  
which ihe had formerly acknowledged her-:  
(elf rcfponlible, have been refilled to be com­  
penfated but on conditions affe&amp;ing other  
claims in no wife connected with them. ^ et  
the fame practices are renewed in the prefent |  
war, and are already of great amount. On  
the Mobile, onrcommerce palling through  
that river continues to be obftru&lt;fked by arbi­  
trary duties, and vexatious fearches. Propor­  
tions for adjufting amicably the bounderies ot  
Louiliana have not yet been acceded to.—  
While the right is unfettled, we have avoided  
changing the ftate of things, by taking new  
pofts, or ftrengthening ourfelves on thedif­  
puted territories, in the hope that the other  
power would not by a contrary conduct, o­  
blige us to meet their example, and endanger  
conflicts of authority, the ifliie of which may  
not eaftly be conrrouled •, but in this hope  
We have now reafon to leflcQ our confi­  
dence—Inroads have been recently made  
into the territory of Orleans and the Mif­  
fifllppi; our citizens have been fkv.ed and  
their property plundered in the very ports  
of the former which had been aft-iallv de­  
4  
livered up by Spain, and this by the regu­  
lar officers and foldiers of that govern­  
ment. I have therefore four.* it riecelury  
at length, to give orders to our troops on  
that frontier to be in readinefs to protect  
our citizens, and repel by arms any limilar  
aggreflions in future—Other details t&gt;ecef­  
fary for your full information of the ftate  
of things between this country and that,  
, fhall be the fubject of another communica­  
tion.  
In reviewing thofe injuries from fome of  
the beligerent powers, the moderation, the  
Iirmnefs, and the wifdom of the legiflaturc,  
will allbe called into a&amp;ion.  
  
\V e onght lull to her. * that time ana a more  
correct ettimate of interefi as well as of char­  
acter, will produce the juftice we are bound  
to expert. But lhould any nation deceive  
itfelf by faife calculations, and difappoint that  
expectation, we mufi join in the unprofita­  
ble contefi, of trying which party can do the  
other the ir.oft harm ; Some of thel&#x27;e injuries  
may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy,where  
that ii competent, it is always the molt defir­  
able—but Some of them are of a nature to be  
met by force oniy, and all of them may lead  
to it. I carAiOt therefore but recommend  
iuch preparations as circuiftftances call for.  
t he firft obicCt is to place our lea-port towns  
out of the danger of inlult. Meafures have  
been already taken for furnifiling them with  
heavy cannon for the Service of Such land bat­  
teries as may make a part of their defence a­  
gainft armed veffcls approaching them. In  
aid ofthefe it is defirable we lhould have a  
competent number of gun-boats \ and the  
number to be competent mufi be considera­  
ble. If immediately bepun, they mav be in  
readinefs for Service at the opening of the  
next fefiion. Whether it will be necelTarv  
4  
to augment our land forces, will be decided  
by occurrences probably in the courl&#x27;e of our  
Sefilon. In the mean time, you will confid­  
er whether it would not be expedient, tor a  
State of peace as well as of war, So to organ­  
ize or clais the militia a; would enable us, cr.  
any ludden emergency to call for the Services  
of the younger portions, unincumbered with  
the old, and thofe having families. Upward  
of three hundred thoufand able bodied men,  
between the ages of eighteen and twenty-fix  
years, which the lafi cenfus {hews we may  
now count within our limits, will furtfilh a  
competent number for offence or defence, in  
any puint whtre thev nuv be wanted, r.nd  
will give time for railing regular forces aftei |  
the ncceflity of them {hall become certain ; |  
and the reducing to the early period of 1ft j  
all its active Service, cannot but be defirable j  
  
%  
to our vounger citizens, of the p* iusnt .w&gt; wcu  
as future times, hn as much a&gt; it engages  
-O them in a more advanced age, a quiet ana  
undifturbed repofe in the bofoui of their *a‘U­

mend to your early cmiUdcration, the expe­  
diency of fo modifying our militia fyftem as,  
oy a I Separation of the more active part from  
that which is lets fo, we may draw from it,  
when necer&#x27;ary an efficient corps, fit tor real  
and active i&#x27;ervice, and to be called to it in  
regular rotation.  
Confiderable prmificn has been made un­

An immediate prohibition cf the expor­

mitted to your determination. I  
Turning from tirTe unplealant views oT  
violence and wrongs, I congratulate you on  
the liberation cf our fellow-citizens who j  
were branded bn the coaft of Tripoli, and  
made prifoners of war. In a government I  
bottomed on the will cf all, the life and liber­  
tv of every citizen, becomes interefting to all. !  
in the treaty, therefore, which has concluded  
our warfare with that bate, an article for the  
i an torn of cur citizens has been agreed to.  
An operation bv land, bv a liisall band of ottr  
countrymen, and ethers engaged fj»* the uC­  
caiion, in conjunction with the troops Oithe  
ex-lhilh.iw, of that comftry, gallantly con­  
ducted by our late Confuh KatOn, and their !  
iuccctsf.il entei&#x27;prizes on the cits of l^-rac,  
  
contributed doublets to the nnprelhon  
which produced ptace j and the concltiliou e&#x27;e ,  
this prevented opportunities of wnich the *&gt; &#x27;  
deers and men of our lquadroh ueftined ibr  
Tripoli, would have availed themfeives t(P  
emulate the acls of valor exhibited by their  
brethren in the attack of ‘ ho laid year. K­  
fte^Hng with high tatisf.x; on on the diftin­  
tinguillied bravery displayed whenever oc­  
calions permitted in the late Mediterranean  
fervice, I think it would be a ufefui encour­  
agement, as well as a juft reward, to make  
an opening for fome prefont promotion by  
enlarging our peace eiiablifhment of captains  
and lieutenants.  
With Tunis fome nifunderftandings  
have arilen, not vet fulHciemivexplained,but  
friendly difeuftions with their ambaffador  
recently arrived, and a mutual difpofition to  
do whatever is juft and reufonable, cannot fail  
ol dillipating thefe. So that we may contider  
our peace on that coaft generally, to be on as  
found a footing as it has been at any pre­  
ceding time.—Still it will not be expedent to  
withdraw immediately, the whoie of our  
force from that fea.  
The law providing for a naval peace  
eftabliflnnent, fixes the number of fri­  
gates which fhall be kept in con Runt  
lervice in time of peace ; and preferibes  
ihat they fhall be manned by not more  
than two thirds of the compliment of  
fea men and ordinary feamen. Whether  
a irigate may be trtitled to two thirds  
only of the proper component of men,  
mull depend oil the ix. me of the for vice

i J j  
  
times for her fafetv, as well as to cnfure

k Coagrefs will perhaps coniider whether  
[the belt limitation on the Executive  
diferetion in this cafe, would not be bv

hich in Utter times has occasionally visited

&quot;of dissipating these; So that we may consU

At 12 ¢’clock, tlie President’s Secretary presented the following  
s MESSA@E: &amp; v - b  
AT a moment when the nations of Eurspe are in commotion and armied’a­  
gainlt each other, when those with whom we have principal intercourse-are en­  
gaged iu the general contest, and when the countenance of some of them towards  
our peaceabie country threatens that even that may nog be snaffe@ed by what  
is pafling on the general theatre, a meeting of the representatives of the #lion  
in both Houles of Congrels, has become more than ufinally delirable. Coming  
from every fe&amp;ion of our country, the_y bring ng‘l them the fentimants and the  
information of the whole, and will be enabled to give a direion to the publc |  
affairs, whieh the will and the wisdom of the whole will ap® ove and fuppaort.  
. n raking a view of the Rlate of our cotiatry, we in the firlt place, notice ths  
late afflic¢tion of two of our cities under the fatal fever, which in latter times has  
occasionally visited our shores. . Providence in his goodnels gave it .earlp termi­  
nation oo this occalion, and leffened.the number of vitims which haye usually  
fallen before it, In the course of the several visitations by this difzafe, it bas  
appzared that it is @Rkrily local, incident to ,citf_‘e‘s&#x27;)énd&#x27;ti_de waters Only ; iacom­  
tunicable in the country either by persons toder’the difeafz, or by goods, carri­  
ed from difealed places; that its accels is with tlie autpin, and it disappears  
when the early frolts come. These restrictions, within nzirow limits of time  
and space, give security even to our maratime ciiizs, auring three fourths of tha:.

ble remedy, where that is competent, it is always the moflt defirable—-bltfome  
of them are of a nature to be.met by foree onlyyand all of them may lead toit. ¢  
1 cannot therefore but recommend such preparations as circumﬁzncepcﬁﬁfcr.  
The firft oby=&amp; is to place our sea-port towns.ont of the danger cf insult, DMea­  
fures have been already taken for furnifhing them with heavy cannon fer &#x27;the  
service of such land bartteries as‘f&#x27;méy make a part of their defence a’gain(’c Arm­  
ed veflels approaching them.. In aid of these it is desirable we should have a  
competent number of gun-boats : and the number to be competent mult be  
confliderable. If immediately begun, they may beé in readiness for service at  
the opening of the next season. Whether it will be neceflary to augment our  
land forces, will be decided by occurrences probably in the course of your Sef- .  
fion. lln the mnean tifne, you will confider whether it would not be expedient,  
for a state of peace as wellas of war, so to organize or class the militia, as would  
enable us, on any sudden emargency to call for the services of the younger por­  
tions, Wnicumbered with the old, and those having families. Upwards of three  
hundred tkoufand able bodied men, betweer the ages of 18 and 26 years, which  
the last census shews we may now count within our limits, will furnifh a compe­  
teat number for offence or defence, in any point where they may be wanted,  
and will give time for raising regular forces ‘after the necessity of them shall.  
become certain ; and the reducing to ihe early period of life all its a&amp;ive {ervice,  
cannot but be desirable to our younger citizens, of the present as well as futur:  
times, in as much as it engages to them in more advanced age, a quiet and un­  
disturbed repose in the bosom of their families. I cannot then but earnestly re­  
commend to your early consideration the expediency of so modifying our mili­  
tiz system as by a separation of the more a&amp;ive part: from that which is less {o,  
Wwé may&#x27; draw from it, when necessary, an efficient corps, fit for real and a&amp;ive  
service, and to be called to it in regular.rotation.  
Considerable provision has been made, under former authorities from Con­  
gress of materials for the confru&amp;ion of ships of wat, of 74 guns, these materi­  
als.are #h hand {ubjeét to the further will of the Legislature. ,  
An immediate proliibition of the exportation of armsand ammunition is also  
submitted to your determination. | el  
Turning from these unpleafunt views of violence and wrongs, I congratulate  
you on the liberation of our fellow citizens, who were firanded on the coast of  
Tripoli, and&#x27;made prisoners of war. * Ina government bottomed on the will of  
all, the life and liberty of every citizen become-interefling to all. In the treaty,  
therefore, which has coneluded our warfare with that. state, an article for the  
ransom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land, by a {mail  
band o&amp;qqr countrymen, and. others engaged for the occasion, in conjunétion  
with the&#x27;ttoops of the ex-Bufliaw, of that country, gallantly condu&amp;ed by our

AT a moment when the nations of Eu-  
rope are in commotion and arming again  
each other, when thofe with whom we  
have principal intercourle are engaged in  
the general conteft, and when the counte-  
nance of fome of them towards our peace-  
able country threatens that even that may  
not be unaffeéted by what is palling on the  
general theatre, a meeting of the reprefen-  
tatives of the nation in both houfes of con-  
grefs bas become more than vfually defir-  
able. Coming from every feétion of our  
country, they bring withthem the [enti-  
ments.and the information of the whole,  
and will be enabled to give a dire€tion to  
the public affuirs which the will and the  
wifdom of the whole wi!l approve and  
fupport.  
  
In taking a view of the ftate of our  
country, we in the fi: ft place notice the  
late affliction of two ot our cities underthe  
fatal fever which in latter times has occa-  
fionally viGited our fhores. Providence in  
his gooduefs gave it an early termination  
on this occafion, and leffzned the number  
of viétims which have ufually fallen be-  
fore it. Inthe courfe of the feveral vifit-  
ations by this difeafe, it has appeared that  
it is ftri€tly local, incident to cities and on  
the tide waters only, incommunicable in  
the country eher by perfons under the  
difeafe, or by goods carried trom difeafed  
places ; that its accefs is with the autumn,  
and it difappears with the carly frolts, Thefe  
reftrictions within narrow hmits of time  
and {pxce give fecurity even to our mara-  
time cities, during three fourths of the  
year, andto the country always. Altho’  
from thefe fafts it appears uaneceffary,  
yet, to fatisfy the fears of foreign nations,  
and cautions on their part not to be com.  
plained of in 4 danger whofe limiis are yet  
unknown te them, | have frilly enjoined

fel failing tor a foreign port, the flate of  
health refpe€ting this tever which prevails  
at the place from whictt the fails. Under  
every motive from charaGer and duty to  
certify the trath, 1 have no doubt they  
have faitifully executed this injun€tion.  
Much real injury has however been fof.  
tained trom a propenfity to identity with  
this endemic, and to call by the fame name,  
fevers of very different kinds which have  
been known at all times, and in ai] coune  
tries, and never have been placed emong  
thofe deemed contagious. As we advance  
in our knowledge of this difeafe, as taéis  
  
| develope the fource from which ikxdividu-  
  
als receive it, the ftate authorities Charged  
with the care ot the pubiie health, and  
congrefs with that of the general com-  
merce, will become able to regulate with  
effe€t their refpe&amp;tive fun@ions in thefe  
departments. The burthen cf quaran-  
tines is felt at home as well as abroad:  
their efhicacy merits examination. Altho’  
the health-laws ef the flate fhould be tound  
to need no prefent revifal by congreis, yer,  
cominerce claims that their attention be’  
ever awake to them. ree  
  
Since our laft meeting the afpeétef our  
foreign relations has confiderably em Ay  
Our coafls have been infefted and ha  
watched by private armed veffels, fome.ot  
them without commiffions, fome with ille-  
gal commiflions, others with thofe of le.  
gal form, but committing piratical as be-  
yond the authority of their commiffions.  
They have captured in the very entrance  
of our harbours as well as on ihe high feas,  
not only the veifels of our triends coming  
to trade with us, but ovr own alfo. They  
have carried them off under pretence of  
legal adjudication; but not daring to ap.  
proach a court of juftice, they have plua-  
dered and funk them by the way, in ob-  
{eure places, where no evidence could a.  
rife againt them, maltreated the crews,  
and abandoned them in boats in the open  
fea, or on- defert fhores, without tood or  
covering. Thele enormities appearing to

force, to crutle within our feas, to arreft |  
ali vefiels of thefe defcriptions found hov- |  
  
ering on our coafis,within the limus of the  
gulph flream, and bring the offenders in  
for trial as pirates.  
  
The fame fyftem of hovering on our  
coafts and harbors, under colour of feek-  
ing enemies, has been alfo carried on by  
public armed fhips, to the great annoyance  
and oppreflion of our commerce,  
  
into the law of nations, founded nei.  
  
ther in juftice. mor the uflage or ac- |  
  
knowledgment of nations. According to  
thefea belligerent takes to itfeli a commerce  
with its own enemy. which it denies to a  
neutral, on the ground of its aiding thet  
enemy inthe war. But reafon revolts at  
fuchan inconfiflency, &amp; the neutral having  
equal right with the belligerent to decide  
tne queilion, the interefts of our conflitu-  
ents, and the duty of maintaining the au-  
thority of reafon, the only umpire be-  
tween juft nations, impofe on us the  
obligation of providing an effeétual and de-  
termined oppofitiou to a do€trine fo inju-  
rious tothe rights of peaceable nations.  
Indeed the confidence we ought to have  
in the juflice of others flill countenances  
the hope that a founder view of thofe  
sights will of itfelf induce from every bel-  
ligerent a more correct obfervance of  
them.  
  
With Spain our negociations for a fet-  
tlement of diffzrences have not had a fat-  
isfaflory iflue. Spoliations during the  
former war, for wliich fhe had formally ac-  
knowledged herfelf refponfible, have been  
retufed to be compenfated but on condi-  
tions affe€iing other claims in no wife con-  
netted with them. Yetthe fame pra€tices  
are renewed in the prefent war and are al-  
ready of great amount. On the Mobile  
our commerce pafling through that river  
  
continues to he obftru@ed by arbitrary |  
  
dupies and vexatious fearches. Propofi-  
_ tions for adjufting amicably the boundaries  
of Louifiana have been acceded to. While  
however, the rightis unfettled, we have a-  
voided changing the flate of things, by ta-

Congrefs will perhaps confijer whether  
the beit limitation on the Executive dif-  
cretion in this cafe would not be by the  
number of feamen which may be employ-  
ed in the whole fervice, rather than by the  
number of veifzis. Occafions often arile for  
the employment of {mail, than of large  
yelfels ; and it would le(fen rifque as well  
as expence, to be authorized to employ

by the number of feamen would admit a  
feleétion of veffels belt adapted to the ler-

Our Indian neighbors are advancing,  
many ot them with fpirit, and others begin-

lat (efiion,the northern tribes have fold tuus  
the lands between the Conneéticut referve  
and the former Indian boundary, and thofe  
on the Ohio, from the fame boundary to  
the rapids, and fora confiderable depth in-

that may not be unafiected by what is pass-  
ing on the general theatre, a meeting of  
the Repre-entatives of the Nation in both  
Houses of Congress has become more than  
usua ly desirable. Coming from every scc-  
tion of our country, they bring with them  
the sentiments and the information of the  
whole, and will be enabled to give a direc-  
tion to the public affairs, which the will  
and the wisdom of the whole approve and  
support.  
  
«* In taking a view of the state of ovr  
country, we, in the first place, notice the  
late affliction of two of our cities under the  
fatal fever which in latter times has occa-  
sionally visited our shores. Providence, in  
his goodness, gave it an early termination  
en this occasion, and lessened the number  
of victims which have usually fallen before  
it. In the course of the several visitations  
by this disease, it has appeared that it is  
strictly local, incident to cities and on the  
tide waters only, incommunicable in the  
country either by persons under the disease,  
er by goods carried from diseased places ;  
that its access is with the autumn, and it  
disappears with the carly frosts. ‘These re-  
strictions, within narrow limits of time and  
space, give security even to our maritime  
citie:, during three-fourths of the year, and  
to the country always. Although from  
these facts it appears unnecessary, yet, to  
  
atisfy the fears of foreign pations, and cau-  
tions on their part not to be complained of  
in a danger whose limits are yet unknown  
to them, [ have strictly enjoined on the of-  
ficers at the head of the customs to certify,  
with exact truth, for every vessel sailing  
for a foregn port, the state of-health re-  
specting this fever, which prevails at the  
place from which she sails: under every  
motive from character and duty to ce:tify  
  
the truth, I have no doubt they have faith-  
fully executed this injunction. Much real  
injury has, however, been sustained from a  
propensity to identify with this endemic,  
and to ca&#x27;l by the same name fevers of very  
different kinds, which have been known at  
all times, and in all countries, and never  
been placed among thoe deemed conta-  
gious. As we advance in our know-edge  
of this disease, as facts develope the source  
from which individuals receive it, the State  
Authorities charged with the care of the  
public health, and Congress with that of  
the general commerce, will he able to ree  
gulate with effect their respective functions  
in these departments. The burthen of qua-  
rantines is felt at home as well as abroad;  
their efficacy merits examination. Although  
the health law of the States should be found  
to need no present revisal by Congress, yet  
commerce claims that their attention should  
ever be awake to them. .  
  
‘© Since our iast meeting, the aspect of  
our foreign relations has considerably chan-  
ged. Our coasts have been infested, and  
our harbours watched by private armed ves-  
sels, some of them without commissions,  
some with illegal commissions, others with  
those of legal form, but committing pirati-  
cal acts, beyond the authority of their com-  
missions. ‘They have captured, in the very  
entrance of our harbours, as well as on the  
high seas, not only vesseis of our friends  
coming to trade with us, but our own also.  
They, have carried them off, under pre-  
tence of legal adjudication; but, not dar-  
ing to approach a eourt of justice, they  
have plundered and sunk them by the way,  
in obscure places, where no evidence could  
arise against them, maltreated the crews,  
and abandoned them in boats on the open  
sea, or on desart shores, without food or  
covering. ‘These enormities appearing to  
be unreached by any controul of their sove-  
reigns. I found it necessary to equip a force,  
to cruise within our own seas, to arrest all  
vessels of these descriptions found hover-  
ing on our coasts, within the limits of the  
gulf stream, and to bring them in for trial  
@&gt; purate .  
  
‘© The same system of hovering on our  
coasts and harbours, under colour of seek-  
ing enemics, has been also carried on by  
pubiic armed ships, to the great annoyance  
and oppression of our commerce.—  
New principles, too, have been interpo-  
lated into the law of nations, founded  
neither in justice, nor the usage or, 2zeknow-  
ledgment of nations. Accorciig to these  
a belligerent takes to it cif a commerce  
with its own enemy, which it denies to a  
uspiral, on the ground of ite aiding chet

such an inconsi&#x27;tency, and the neutral hav-  
ing equal right with the bellice ent to de-  
cide the question, the interest of cur con-  
stituents, and the duty cf maintaining the  
authority of reason, the only umpire be-  
tween just nations. impore on us the obli-  
gation of providing an effectua: and deter-  
mined oppo ition to a doctr $0 injurious  
to the rights of peaceable nation. Indeed,  
the confidence we ought to have on the  
justice of others, still countenances the  
Reon, that a -ounder view of those ri  
will of itself induce from every belligerent  
a more correct observance of t]

settlement of differences, have rot had a

acknowledged herself respensible, have

practices ave renewed in the present war,  
and are already of great emount. On the  
Mobille, cur commerce, paving through  
that river, continues to be ob tructed by  
arb&#x27;trary duties, and vexatious sear hes.—  
Proporitions for adjusting amicably the  
boundaries of Louisiana hive not been ac-  
ceded to.  
  
“ While the rieht is unsettled, we have  
avoided changing the state o i by  
taking new posts, or strep  
selves in the disputed territc  
hope that the other pewer would ne  
contrary conduct, oblige us to met th  
example, and endanger comlicts ef autno-  
rity, the issue of which may not be gasily  
controuled; bet in this hope we have now  
reason to lessen our confidence. Imroads  
have been recently made into the territo-  
ries of Orleans and the Mississippi; our  
citizens have been seized, and their pro-  
  
erty pluridercd, in the very parts of the  
oa r, which had been actuaily delivered  
up by Spair, and thi, by the reguiar off-  
cers and soldicrs of that government. I  
have, therefore, found it necessary at length  
to give orders to our troops on that frontier,  
to be in readiness to p-otect our citizens,  
and to repel by arms any sivelar aggres-  
sions in future. Other details necessary for  
  
our full information of the state of things  
tween this country and that, shall be the  
subject of another communication.  
  
“ In reviewing these injuries from some  
of the belligerent powers. the moderation,  
the firmnes,, and the wi.dom of the legis-  
fature, will all be calied into action. We  
orght still to heve that time, and a more  
correct estimate of interest, as well as of  
eharacter, will produce the ju-tice we are  
bound to expect. But should apy nation

appoint that expectation, we must jel in  
  
State Papers:  
  
the unprofitable contest, of trving which  
party can do the other the most harm.  
  
“ Some of these injuries may, perhaps,  
admit a peaceable remedy; where that is  
competent, it is always the most de irable;  
but some of them are of a nature to be met  
by force only, and all of them may lead to  
it. | cannot, therefore, but re ommend such  
preparations as circumstances call for. The  
first object is to place ou: sea-port towns  
out of the danger of insult. Measures have  
been already taken for furni:hing them with  
heavy cannon, for the service of such land  
batteries as may make a part of their de-  
fence against armed vessels approaching  
them. In aid of these, it is desirable we  
should have a competent number of gun-  
boats; and_the number to be competent  
mut be considerable. If immediately be-  
gun, they may be in readiness for service  
at the opening of the next season.  
  
“ Whether it will be necessary to aug=  
ment our land forces, will be decided by  
occurrences probably in the course of your  
sevsion. In the mean time, you will cos-  
sider whether it would not he expedient, for  
a state of peace as wellas of war, soto or-  
ganize or class the militia, as would enable  
us, on any sudden emergency, to call for  
the services of the younger. portions, .unip-  
cumbered with the old and those havin  
families. Upwards of three hundred thou-  
sand able-bodied men, between the ages of  
eighteen and twenty-six years, which the  
last cen-us shows we may now count. within  
our limits, will furnish a competent num-  
ber for offence or defence, in any point  
where they may be wanted, and will give  
time for ra r recular forces, after the ne=  
cessity of them shall become certain; and  
the reducing to the early period of life all  
its active services, cannot but be desirable  
to our younger citizens, of the present as  
weil as future times, ina-much as it enga-  
ges to them, in more advanced age, a quiet  
and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their  
families. I cannot, then, but earnestly re-  
commend to your early. consideration the  
expediency of so modifying our militia sys-  
tem, as, by a separation of the more active  
part from that which is less so, we may  
draw from it, when necessary, an efficient  
corps, fit for real and active service, and to  
be called to it in regular rotation.

were stranded on the coast of Tripoli, and  
made prisoners of-war. In a government  
bottomed on the will of all, the life and li-  
berty of every citizen becomes interesting  
toall. In the treaty, therefore, which has  
concluded our warfare. with that State, an  
article for the ransom of our citizens has  
been agreed to. An operation by land, by  
a small band of our countrymen, and others  
engaged for the occasion, in conjunction  
with the troops of the Ex-bashaw of that  
country, gallantly conducted by our late  
Consul . Eaton, and their successful enter-  
prise on the city of Derne, contributed,  
doubtless, to the impression which produced  
peace; and the conclusion of this prevented  
opportunities, of which the officers and men  
of our squadron, destined for Tripoli, would  
have availed themselves, to emulate the  
acts of valour exhibited by their brethren  
in the attack of the last year. Reflecting,  
with high satisfaction, on the distinguished  
bravery displayed, whenever occasions per-  
mitted, in the late Mediterranean service,  
I think it would be an useful encourage-  
ment, as well as a just reward, to make an  
opening for some present promotion, by en-  
larging our peace establishment of captains  
and lieutenants.  
  
“ With Tunis, some misunderstandings  
have arisen, not yet sufficiently explained;  
but friendly. discussions with their ambas-  
sadors, recently arrived, and a mutual dis-  
position to do whatever is just and reason-  
able, cannot fail of dissipating these; so  
that we may consider our peace on that  
coast, generally, to be on as sound a foot-  
ing as it has been at any preceding time.—  
Still it will not be expedient to withdraw  
immediately the-whole of our force from  
that sea.  
  
“ The law, providing for a naval peace  
establishment, fixes the number of frigates  
which shall be kept in constant service in  
time of peace; and prescribes that they  
shall be manned by not more than two-  
thirds of their complement of seamen and  
ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may  
be trusted to two-thirds only of the proper  
complement of men, must depend on the  
nature of the service on which she is or-  
dered, that may sometimes for her safety,  
as well as to insure her object, require her  
fullest complement. In adverting to this  
subject, Congress will, perhaps, consider,  
whether the best limitation on the execu-  
tive discretion in this case would not be by  
the number of seamen which may be em-  
ployed in the whole service, rather than by  
the number of vessels. Occasions oftener  
arise for the employment of small, than  
of large vessels; and it would lessen risk,  
as well as expence, to be authorised to em-  
ploy them in preference. The limitation  
suggested by the number of seamen, would  
  
Vor. V,

admit a selection of vessels best adapted to  
the service.  
  
“ Our Indian neighbours are advancing,  
many of them with spirit, and others be-  
ginning to engage in the pursuits of agri-  
culture and household manufacture. They  
are becoming sensible that the earth yields  
subsistence with less labour than the forest ,  
and find it their interest, from time to time,  
tu dispose of parts of their surplus and  
waste lands, for the means of improving  
those they occupy, and of subsisting their  
families while they are preparing their  
farms.  
  
*¢ Since your last session, the northera  
tribes have sold to us the lands between the  
the Connecticut reserve, and the former  
Indian boundary, and those on the Ohio,  
from the same boundary and its rapids, and  
for a considerable depth inland. The Chic-  
kasaws and Cherokees have sold us the  
country between and adjacent the two dis-  
tricts of Tennessee; and the Creeks, the  
residue of their lands in the fork of Oc-  
mulgee, up to the Ulcofauhatehe. The three  
former purchases are important, inasmuch  
as they consolidate parts of our settled  
country, and render their intercourse se-  
cure; and the second particularly so, as,  
with the small point on the river, which  
we expect is by this time ceded by the  
Piankeshaws, it completes our possession  
of the whole of both banks of the Ohio,  
from its source to near its mouth, and the  
navigation of that river is thereby rendered  
for ever safe to our citizens, settled and  
settling, on its extensive waters; the pur-  
chase from the Creeks too has been for  
some time particularly interesting to the  
State of Georgia. eee

termination on this 6ccasion, and- lessened  
the number of victims which have usually  
fallen before it. In the course of the several]  
visitations by this disease, it has appeared  
that it is strictly local, incident to cities and  
on the tide waters only ; incommiunicable in  
the cguntry either by persons. under the dis-  
ease, or by goods carried from diseased pla-  
than its access is with the autumn, and

restrictions, within narrow limits of. time  
and space, give security even. to. our maari-  
time cities, dering three-fourths of the year,  
to the country always. , Although from these  
facts it appears unnecessary ; yet, to satisfy  
the fears of foreigh nations, and cautions ou  
their part not to be complained of in a dan-  
  
| ger whose limits are yet unknewn to then,  
  
I have strictly @njoived on the officers at the  
head of the eustenmas to certify with exact  
truth, for every vessel sailing for a foreign  
port, the state of health respecting this fever,  
which prevails at the place from which she  
  
sails; under every motive from character  
&#x27; and duty to certify the truth, I have no  
  
doubt they have faithfully executed this in-  
  
| junction.—Much real injury has, however,  
  
been ‘sustained from a propensity io iden-  
  
| tify with this endemic, and to call by the  
  
same name, fevers of very different king  
  
which have beer! known at all tumes, and ia  
J  
all countries, and never haye been placed  
  
among those deemed contagious. As we  
advance in our knowledge of this disease, a3  
facts develope the source from which indiv.-  
duals receive it, the state authorities charged  
with the care of the public health, and cou-  
vress with that of the general commerce,  
will become able to regulate with effect  
their respective functions in these depar-  
ments. The burthen of quarantines-is fe!  
at home as well as abroad, their efficacy me-  
rits examination. Although the health Jaw  
of the states should be found to need no pre:  
sent revisal, by congress, yet cojnmnel¢  
clains-that their attention should ever. b¢  
awake to them. Since our last meeting,  
the aspect of onr sovereignrelations has col  
siderably changed. Our coasts have beet  
infested, and our harbours watched by pt  
vate armed vessels, sume of them withvul  
commissions, some with illegal commissions  
others with those of legal torm, but comml  
ting piratical acts beyond the authority “

‘ enemies, has been also carried on by public

have been recently made into the territories

some of the belligerent powers, the. modera-  
tion, the firmuess, and the wisdam of the je~  
gislature will all be called into dction. We  
ought stil] to hope that time and a more cor-  
rect estimate of interest as well as of charac-  
ter, will produce the justice we are bound to  
expect. But should any nation deceive itself  
by false calculations, and disappoint that ex-  
pectation, we must join m the unprofitable  
contest, of tyying which party can do the  
other the most harm ; some ef these injurk $  
| may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy,  
where that is competent, it is always the  
mast desirable; but some of them are of a  
nature to be met by force only, and all of  
them may lead to it. I cannot, therefore,  
but recommend such preparations as circum,  
stances cal] for, The first object is to place  
our sea-port towns out of the danger of in-  
sult. Measures have been already taken for  
furgishing them with heavy cannon for the  
service ot such Jani batteries as may make a  
part of their defence against armed vessels  
approaching them. In aid of these it ts de-  
sirable we should have a‘competent number  
of gun-boats ; and the number to be coinpe-  
tent must be considerable. If immediately  
begun, ‘they may,be in readiness for service  
at the opening of the next season. Whe-  
ther it will be necessary to augment our Jand  
forces, will be decided by occurrences pto-  
bably in the course of your session. In the  
mean time you wili ‘consider whether it  
would not be expedient; for’a state of peace  
as well as of war, so to organize or class the  
militia, as would enable us on any, sudcen  
emergency, te tal] for the ‘services of the  
younger portions, unincumbered with the  
old or those having families... Upwards of  
three hundred ‘thousand able-bodied mey,  
between theages of 18 and 26 years, which  
the Jast census shews we may count within

trom these unpleasant views of violence and  
wrongs, I congratulate you on the liberation  
of our fellow citizens, who Were stranded  
on the coast of Tripoli, and made prisoners  
of war. In a government bottomed on the |  
will of all, the life and liberty of every citi-  
zen becomes interestins to all. In the trea-  
ty therefore which has concladed our war-  
tare with that state, an article for the ransom  
of our citizens has been agreed to. An ope-  
ration by land, by a small band of our coun-  
trymen, and others engaged for the occasion, |  
in conjunction with the treops of the ex-ba-  
shaw of that country, gallantly conducted  
by our late consul Eaton, and their successful  
enterprize on the cityof Derne, contributed  
doubtless to the impression which produced  
peace: aud the conclusion of this prevented  
opportunities of which the officers and men  
of our squadron destined for Tripoli, would  
have availed themselves to emulate the acts  
of valour exhibited by their brethren in the  
attack of the last year. Reflecting with  
high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery  
displayed whenever occasions permitted in  
the late Mediterranean service, I think it  
would be an useful encouragement, as well  
u$ a just reward, to make an opening for  
some present promotion by enlarging our

unaffected by whai Is passing on the general theatre, a meet-  
ine of the representatives of the nation in both houses of  
  
congress, has become inore than usually desirable. Com-  
  
ing from every section of our country, they bring with them  
the sentiments and the information of the whoie, and wil! be  
enabled to give a direction to the pubiic affairs, which the  
will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.  
In taking a view of the state of our country, we, in the  
first place, notice the late affliction of two of our cities under  
the fatal fever, which in latter times has occasionally visited  
our shores. Providence in his goodness gave it an early  
termination on this occasion, and lessened the number of  
victims which have usually fallen before it. In the course  
of the several visitations by this disease, it has appeared that  
it is strictly local, mecident to cities and tide-waters only —  
incommunicabie in the couniry either by persons under the  
disease, or by goods carried from diseased places; that its  
access is with the autumn, and it disappears with the early  
frosts. These restrictions, within narrow limits of time and  
space, five security even to our maritime cities, during  
three fourths of the year, and to the country always.  
Although from these facts it appears unnecessary ; yet, te  
satisfy the fears of foreign nations, and cautions on their  
part not to be complained of in a danger whose limits are  
yet unknown to them, I have strictly enjoined on the officers  
at the head of the customs to certify with exact truth, for  
every vessel sailing for a forcign port, the state of health ree  
specting this fever, which prevails at the piace from which  
she sails—under every motive from character and duty to  
certify the truth, I have no doubt they have faithfully exe-  
cuted this injunction. Much real injury has, however, been  
sustained from a propensity to identify with this endemic  
and to call by the same name, fevers of very different kinds  
which have been known at all times, and in all countries, and  
never have been placed upon those deemed contazious. As  
  
we advance in our knowledge of this disease, as facts deve-

lope the source from which individuals receive it, the state  
authorities charged with the care of the public health, and  
congress with that of the general commerce, will become  
able to regulate with effect their respective functions in these  
departments. The burthen of quarantines is felt at home  
as well as abroad, their efficacy merits examination. Al-  
thouch the health law of the states should be found to need  
no present revisal by congress, yet commerce claims that  
their attention should ever be awake to them.  
  
Since our Jast meeting, the aspect of our foreign relations  
has considerably changed. Our coasts have been infested,  
and our harbors watched by private armed vessels, some of  
them without commissions, some with illegal commissions,  
others with those of legal form, but committing piratical  
acts beyond the authority of their commissions. They  
have captured in the very entrance of our harbours, as well  
as on the high séas, not only the vessels of our friends com-  
ing to trade with us, but our own also. They have carried  
them off under pretence of legal adjudication, but not daring  
to approach a court of justice, they have plundered and sunk  
them by the way in obscure places, where no evidence could  
arise against them, mal-treated the crews and abandoned  
them in boats, on the open sea, or on desart shores, without  
food or covering. These cnormities appearing to be un-  
reached by any controul of their sovereigns, I found it neces-  
sary to equip a force, to cruise within our own seas, to arrest  
all vessels of these descriptions found hovering on our coasts,  
within the limits of the gulph stream, and to bring them in  
for trial as pirates.  
  
The same system of hovering on our coasts and harbours,  
under colour of seeking enemies, has been also carried on by  
public armed ships, to the great annoyance and oppression  
ofourcommerce. New principles too have been interpolated  
into the law of nations, founded neither in justice nor the  
Usage or acknowledgment of nations; according to these a

belligerent takes to itselfa commerce with its own enemy&gt;  
which it denies to a neutral, on the ground of its aiding that  
enemy in the war. But reason revolts at such an inconsist-  
ency—and the neutral having equal right with the bellige-  
rent to decide the question, the interests of our constituents,  
and the duty of maintaining the authority of reason, the only  
umpire between just nations, impose on us tle obligation of  
providing an effectual and determined opposition to a doc-  
trine so injurious to the rights of peaceable nations ; indeed  
the confidence we ought to have on the justice of others,  
still countenances the hope, that a sounder view of those  
rights will of itself induce from every belligerent a more  
correct observance of them.  
  
With Spain our negociations for the settlement of differ-  
ences have not hada satisfactory issue. Spoliations during  
  
the former war, for which she had formally acknowledged  
  
herself responsibie, have been refused to be compensated  
but on conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected  
with the m—yet the same practices are renewed in the pre-  
sent war, and are already of great amount. On the Mobile,  
our commerce passing through that river continues to be  
obstructed, by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches.  
Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries of Louisi-  
ana have not yet been acceded to. While the right is unset-  
tled, we have avoided changing the state of things, by taking  
new posts, er strengthening ourselves in the disputed terri-  
tories, in hope that the other power wouid not, by a contrary  
conduct, oblige us to meet their example, and endanger con-  
flicts of authority, the issue of which may not be easily con-  
trolcd ; but in this hope we have reason to lesser our conii-  
dence. Inroads have been recently made into the territories  
of Orleans and the Missisippi; our citizens have been  
scized, and their property plundered in the very parts of tiie  
former which had actually been delivered up by Spain, and  
this by the regular oiicers and soldiers of that government.

our citizens, and repel by arms any similar aggressions in  
futures Other details necessary for your full information of  
the state of things between this country and that, shall be the  
subject of another communication.  
  
In reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent  
powers, the moderation, the firmness, and the wisdom of  
the legislature will be called into action. We ought still to  
hope, that time and a more correct estimate of interest as  
well as of character, will produce the justice we are bound  
toexpect. But should any nation deceive itself by false cal-  
culations, and disappoint that expectation, we must join in  
the unprofitable contest, of trying which party can co the  
ether the most harm; sonae of these injurics may perhaps  
admit a peaceable remedy, where that is competent, it is  
always the most desirable; but some of them are of a na-  
ture to be met by force only, and all of them may lead to it.  
I cannot, therefore, but recommend such preparations as  
circumstances call for. ‘The first ebject is to place our sea-  
port towns out of the danger of insult. Measures have —  
already been taken for furnishing them with heavy cannon  
for the service of such land batteries as may make a part of  
their defence against armed vessels approaching them. Jn  
aid of these it is desirable we shouid have a competent num-  
ber of gun-boats: and the number to be competent must  
be considerable. If immediately begun they may be in  
readiness for service at the cpening of the next season.  
Whether it will be necessary to augment our land forces,  
will be decided by occurrences probably in the course of your  
session. In the mean time, you will consider whether it  
will not be expedient, for a state of peace as well as of war,  
£0 to organize the militia, as would enable us, on any sudden  
emergency, to call for the services of the younger portions,  
unincumbered with the old and those having families. Up-  
wards of three hundred thousand able-bodied men, between  
the ages of eighteen and twenty-six years, which the last  
census shews we may count within our limits, will furnish a

competent number for offence and defence, in any point  
where they may be wanted, and willgive time for the raising  
of regular forces after the necessity of them sail become  
certain; and the recucing to the early period of life all its  
active service, cannot but be desirable to all our younger  
citizens, of the present, as well as future times, in. as much  
as it engages to them in more advanced age a quiet and un-  
disturbed repose in the bosoms of their families. I cannot  
then, but earnestly recommend to your early consideration,  
the expediency of so modifying our militia system, as, by a  
separation of the more active part from that which is less so,  
we may draw from it, when necessary, an efficient corps,  
fit for real and active service, and to be called to it in regu-  
  
lar rotation.  
  
Considerable provision has been made uncer former ay-  
thorities from congress of materials for the construction of  
ships of war of 74 guns; these materials are on hand sub-  
  
ject to the further will of the legislature.  
  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms-and  
ammunition, is also submitted to your determination.  
  
Turning from these urpleasant views of violence and  
wrongs, I congratulate you on the liberation of our fellow-  
citizens, who were stranded on the coast of Tripoli, and  
made prisoners of war. Jn a government bottomed on the  
will of ajl, the life and liberty of every citizen become in-  
teresting to all. In the treaty, therefore, which has con-  
cluded our warfare with that state, an article for the ransom  
of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land,  
by a smal! body of our countrymen, and others engaged for  
the occasion, in conjunction with the troops of the ex-ba-  
shaw of that country, gallantly conducted by our late consul,  
Eaton; and their successful enterprise on the city of Derne;,  
contributed doubtless to the impression that produced peace ;  
and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities, of which  
the officers and men of our squadron, destined for Tripoli,  
would have availed themselves, to emulate the acts of valour

exhibited by their brethren in the attack of the last year.—  
Reflecting, with high satisfaction, on the distinguished bra=  
very displayed, whenever oc¢assion permitted, in tne Jate  
  
Mediterranean service, I think it would be an useful encou-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ragement, as well asa just reward, to make an opening for  
some present promotion, by enlarging our peace establish-  
ment of captains and lieutenants.  
  
With Tunis, some misunderstandings have arisen, not yet  
sufficiently explained; but friendly discussions with their  
ambassador, recently arrived, and a mutual disposition to do  
whatever is just and reasonable, cannot fail of dissipating  
these. So that we may consider our peace, on that coast,  
generally, to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any  
time. Still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediate-  
ly the whole of our force from that sea.  
  
The law, providing for a naval peace establishment fixes  
the number of frigates which shall be kept in constant ser-  
vice in time of peace; and prescribes that they shall be  
manned by not more than two thirds of their complement of  
seamen and ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may be  
trusted to two thirds only of the proper complement of men,  
must depend on the nature of the service on which she is  
ordered, that may sometimes, for her safety, as well as to  
ensure her object, require her fullest complement. In ad-  
verting to this subject, congress will perhaps, consider  
whether the best limitation on the executive discretion in  
this case, would not be by the number of seamen which may  
be employed in the whole service, rather than by the number  
of vessels. Occasions ofiener arise for the employment of  
small, than of Jarge vessels: and it would lessen risk as  
well as expence to be authorised to employ them of prefer-  
ence. The limitation suggested by the number of seamen  
would admit of a selection of yessels best adapted to the  
service.

agriculture and household manufacture. They are becoming  
  
sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labour  
than the forest, and find it their interest from time to time,  
to dispuse of parts of their surplus and waste lands, for the  
means of improving those they occypy, and of ‘subsisting  
their families while they are preparing their farms: since  
your last session the northern tribes have sold to us the  
lands between the Connecticut reserve and the former  
Indian boundary; and those on the Ohio, from the same  
boundary and its rapids, and for a considerable depth inland.  
The Chickasaws and Cherokees have sold us the country  
adjacent to the two districts of Tennessee; and the Crecks  
the residue of their lands in the fork of the Ocmulvee up  
the Ulcosauhatche; the three former purchases are impor-  
tant, in as much as they consolidate parts of our settled  
country, and render their intercourse secure; and the  
second particularly so, as, with the small point on the river,  
which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws,  
it completes our possession of the whole of both banks of  
the Ohio, from its source to near its mouth, and the navi-  
gation of that river is thereby rendered forever sale to our  
citizens settled and settling on its extensive waters; the  
purchase from the Creeks, too, has been for sometime par-

cas the whole, and will be enabled to give a dire¢tion to the publick affairs, which the will  
the and the wifdom of the whole will approve and fapport. In taking a view of the.

different kinds, which have been known at all times and in all countries, and never  
have been placed among thofe deemed contagious. As we advance in our knowl-  
edge of this difeafe, as facts develope the fource from which individuals receive it,  
the ftate authorities charged with the care of the publick health, and congrefs with  
that of the general commerce, wiil become able to regulate with effect their refpec-  
tive functions in thefe departments. ‘The burthen of quarantines is felt at home ds  
well as abroad ; their merits examination. Although the health laws of  
the ftates fhould be found to need no prefent revifalby Congrefs, yet commerce  
claims that their attention be ever awake to them.  
  
Since our laft meeting, the afpect of our foreign relations has confiderably chang-  
ed. Our coafts have been infefted, and our harbours watched, by private armed  
veflels, fome of them without commiffions, fome with illegal commiffions, others,  
with thofe of legal form, but committing piratical acts beyond the authority of  
their commiiffions. They have captured in the very entrance of our harbours, as  
well as on the high feas, not only the veffels of our friends, coming to trade with  
us, but our own alfo. They have carried them off under pretence of legal adjudica-  
tion, but, not daring to approach a court of juftice, they have plundered and funkthem  
by the way,or in obfcrre places, where no evidence could arife againft them, mal-  
treated. the crews, and abandoned them in boats, in the open fea, or on defert fheres,  
without food or covering. ‘Fhefe enormities, appearing to be unreached by any con-  
trolof their fovereigns, F found it neceflary to equip a force, to cruize within our  
own feas, to arreft all veffels of thefe defcriptions found hovering on our coafts with-  
in the limits of the Gulf Stream, and to bring the offenders in for trial as pirates.  
  
The fame fyftem. of hovering on our coafts and harbours, under colour of feeking  
enemies, has been alfo carried on by pubiick armed fhips, to the great annoyance  
and opprefiion of our commerce. New principles too have been interpolated into  
the law of nations, founded neither in juftice, nor the ufage or acknowledgment of  
wations. According to thefe, a belligerent takes to itfelf a commerce with its own  
enenry, which it denies to a neutral, on the ground of its aiding that enemy in the  
war. But reafon revolts at fuch an ineonfiftency ; and the neutral, having equal  
right with:the belligerent to decide the queftion, the interefts of our conftituents,  
and the duty of maintaining the authority of reafon, the only umpire between juft  
nations, impofe on us the obligation of providing an effectual and determined oppo-  
fition to a. doctrine fo injurious to the rights of peaceable nations. Indeed the con-  
fidence we ought to have in the juftice of others, fill countenances the hope, that a  
founder view of thofe rights will of itfelf induce from every belligerent a more cor-  
rect obfervance of them. |  
  
Witlt Spain our negociations for a fettlement of differences have not had a fatis-  
factory iilue. Spoliations during the former war, fer which fhe had formally ac-  
knowledged herfelf refponfible, have been refufed to be compenfated but on con-  
ditions affecting other claims in no wife connected with them. Yet the fame prac~-  
tices are renewed in the prefent war, and are already of great amount. On the  
Mobile, our commerce, pafling through that river, continues to be obftructed by ar-  
bitrary duties and vexatious fearches. Propefitions for adjufting amicably the boun-  
daries of Louifiana have not been acceded to. While however the right 1s unfettled,  
we have avoided changing the ftate of things, by taking new pofts, or ftrengthen-  
ing ourfelves in the difputed territories, inthe hope that the other power would not  
bya contrary conduct, oblige us to meet their example, and endanger conflicts of  
authority, the iflue of which may not be eafily controlled. But im this hope we  
have now reafon to leflen our confidence. Inroads have been recently made into  
the territories of Orleans and the Mifiifippi. Our citizens have been feized and  
their property plundered in the very parts of the former which had been actually  
delivered up by Spain : and this by the regular officers and foldiers of that govern~  
ment. I have, therefore, found it neceflary at length to give orders to our troops om  
that frontier, to be in readinefs to protect our citizens, and to repel by arms any  
fimilar aggreflions im future. Other details neceflary for your full information of  
the {tate of things between this country and that, thall be the fubject of another  
communication.  
  
In reviewing thefe injuries from fome of the belligerent powers, the moderation,  
the &amp;rmnefs, and the wifdom of the legiflature will all be called into action. We

aught fill to hope, that time and a more correct eftimate-of interéft, as well as of  
charatter, will produce the juftice we are bound to expec.  
But fhould any nation deceive itfelf by falfe calculations, and difappoint that ex-  
tion, we muft join in the unprofitable conteft, of trying which party.can do the  
other the moft harm. Some of thefe injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable rem-  
edy. Where that is competent, it is always the mroft defirable. But fome of them  
are of a nature to be met by force only, and all.of them may lead to it. I cannot  
therefore but recommend fuch preparations as circumftances call for. The firft ob-  
ject is to place our fea-poert towns out of the danger of infult. Meafures have been  
already taken for furnifhing them with heavy cannon, fer the fervice of fuch land  
batteries, as may make a part of their defence againft armed veffels approaching  
them. In aid of thefe, it is defirable we fhould havea competent number of gun-  
boats: and the number, to be competent, muft be confiderable. If immediately bes  
gun, they may be in readinefs for fervice at the opening of the next feafon. Wheth-  
er it will be neceffary to augment our land forces, will be decided by occurrences  
probably in the courfe of your feffion. In the mean time, you will confider, whether  
  
&#x27; at would not be expedient, for a ftate of peace as well as of war, fo to organize or  
  
clafs the militia as would enable us, on a fudden emergency, to call for the fervices  
of the younger portions, unincumbered with the old and thofe having families.  
Upwards of three hundred thoufand able bodied men, between the ages of eighteen  
and twenty-fix years, which the laft cenfus fhews we may now couat within our  
timits, will furnifh a competent number for offence or defence, in any point where  
they may be wanted, and will give time for raifing regular forces, after the neceffit  
of them fhall become certain: and the reducing to the early period of life all its ac-  
tive fervice, cannot but be defirable to our younger citizens of the prefent, as welt  
as future times ; inafmuch as it engages to them, in more advanced age, a quiet and  
undifturbed repofe in the bofom of their families. I cannot then but earneftly re-  
commend to your early confideration, the expediency of fo modifying our militia  
fyftem, as, by a feparation of the more active part from that which is lefs fo, we  
may draw from it, wheneceflary, an efficient corps, fit for real and active fervice,  
and to be called to it in regular rotation.  
  
Confiderable provifion has been made under former authorities from Congrefs, of  
materials for the conftruction of fhips of war of 74 guns--thefe materials are on  
hand, fubject to the further will of the legiflature.  
  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms and ammunition is alfo fub-  
mitted to your determination.  
  
Turning from thefe ynpleafant views of violence and wrong, I congratulate you  
on the liberation of our fellow citizens, who were ftranded on the coafts of Tripoli,  
and made prifoners of war. Ina government bottomed on the will of ali, the life  
and liberty of every individual citizen becomes interefting to all. In the treaty  
therefore which has concluded our warfare with that ftate, an article for the ranfom  
of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land by a {mall band of our  
countrymen, and others engaged for the occafion, in conjunction with the troops of  
the ex-bathaw of that country, gallantly conduéted by our late conful Eaton, and  
their fuccefsful enterprize on the city of Berne, contributed doubtiefs to the im-  
Preffion which produced peace: and the conclufion of this prevented opportunities,  
of which the officers and men of our fquadron deftined for Tripoli would have a-  
vailed themfelves to emulate the acts of valour exhibited by their brethren in the  
attack of the laft year. Reflecting with high fatisfaction on the diftinguifhed brave-  
ry, difplayed whenever occafions permitted in the late Mediterranean fervice, I think  
it would be an ufeful encouragement, as well as a juft reward, to make an opening  
for fome prefent promotion, by enlarging our peace eftablifhment ef captams and  
lieutenants.  
  
With Tunis fome mifunderftandings have arifen not yet fufficiently explained ;  
but friendly difeuffions with their ambaffador, recently arrived, and a mutual difpo-  
fition to do whatever is ju@ and reafonable cannot fail of diffipating thefe. So that  
we may confider our peace, on that coaft generally, to be on as found a footing as it  
has been at any preceding time. Still it will not be expedient to withdraw immedi-  
ately the whole of our force from that fea.

To the Senate and House of Representatives  
of the United States of America.  
  
At a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion  
and arming against each other, when those with whom we have  
principal intercourse are engaged in the general contest, and  
when the countenance of some of them towards our peaceable  
country threatens that even that may not be unaffected by what  
is passing on the general theatre, a meeting of the representa-  
tives of the nation in both Houses of Congress has become  
more then usually desirable. Coming from every section of  
our country, they bring with them the sentiments and infor-  
mation of the whole, and will be able to give a direction to  
the public affairs which the will and the wisdom of the whole  
will approve and support.  
  
In taking a view of the state of our country, we in the first  
place notice the late affliction of two of our cities under the  
fatal fever which in latter times has occasionally visited our  
shores. Providence in his goodness gave it an early termina-  
tion on this occasion, and lessened the number of victims  
which have usually fallen before it. In the course of the se-  
veral visitations by this disease, it has appeared that it is strict-  
ly local, incident to cities and on the tide waters only, incommu-  
nicable in the country either by persons under the disease, or  
by goods carried from diseased places ; that its access is with

restrictions within narrow limits of time and space give secu-  
rity even to our maritime cities, during three-fourths of the  
year, and to the country always. Although from these facts it  
appears unnecessary, yet, to satisfy the fears of foreign na-  
tions, and cautions on their part not to be complained of ina  
danger whose limits are yet unknown tothem, I have strictly  
enjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to certify  
with exact truth, for every vessel sailing for a foreign port, the  
state of health respecting this fever which prevails at the piace  
from which she sails. Under every motive from character  
and duty to certify the truth, I have no doubt they have faith-  
fully executed this injunction. Much real injury has how-  
ever been sustained from a propensity to identity with this  
endemic, and to call by the same name, fevers of very differ-  
ent kinds which have been known at all times, and in all coun-  
tries, and never have been placed among those deemed con-  
tagious. As we advance in our knowledge of this disease,  
as facts develop the source from which individuals receive  
it, the State authorities charged with the care of the public  
health, and Congress with that of the general commerce, will  
become able to regulate with effect their respective functions  
inthese departments. The burthen of Quarantine is felt at  
home as well as abroad; their efficacy merits examination.  
Although the health laws of the states should be found to  
need no present revisal by Congress, yet commerce claims  
that their attention be ever awake to them.  
  
Since or last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has  
considerably changed. Our coasts have been infested, and  
  
  
  
our harbours watched by private armed vessels, some of them:  
  
without commissions, some with illegal commissions, others  
with those of legal form, but committing piratical acts beyond  
the authority of their commissions. They have captured in  
the very entrance of our harbours as well as on the high seas,  
not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade with us,  
but our own also. “They have carried them off under pre-  
tence of legal adjudication; but not daring to approach a  
court of justice, they have plundered and sunk them by the  
way, in obscure places, where no evidence coul

 too have been interpolated  
into the law of nations, founded neither in justice nor the  
usage or acknowledgment of nations. According to these a  
belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its own enemy,  
which it denies to a neutral, on the ground of its aiding that  
enemy in the war. But reason revolts at such an inconsis-  
tency, and the neutral having equal right with the belligerent  
to decide the question, the interests of our constituents, and  
the duty of maintaining the authority of reason, the only um-  
pire between just nations, impose on us the obligation of pro-  
viding an effectual and determined opposition to a doctrine so  
injurious co the rights of peaceable nations. Indeed the con-  
fidence we ought to have in the justice of others, still counte-  
nances the hope that a sounder view of those rights will ot  
itself induce from every belligerent a more correct observance  
of them.  
  
With Spain our negociations for a settlement of differences  
have not had a satisfactory issue. Spoliations during the for-  
mer war, for which she had formally acknowledged herself  
responsible, have been refused to be compensated but on con-  
ditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them.  
Yet the same practices are renewed in the present war, and  
are already of great amount. On the Mobile our commerce  
passing through that river continues to be obstructed by ar-  
bitrary duties and vexatious searches. Propositions for ad-  
  
justing amicably the boundaries of Louisiana have not been  
  
acceded to. While, however, the right is unsettled, we have  
avoided changing the state of things, by taking new posts, or  
strengthening ourselves inthe disputed territories, in the hope

that that power would not, by a contrary conduct, oblige us to  
meet their example, and endanger conflicts of authority, the  
issue Of which may not be easily controlled. But in this hope  
we have now reason to lessen our confidence. Inroads have  
been recently made into the territories of Orleans and the Mis-  
sisippi, our citizens have been seized and their property plun-  
dered in the very parts of the former which had been actually  
delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular officers and  
soldiers of that government. I have therefore found it ne-  
cessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier  
to be inreadiness to protect our citizens and to repel by arms  
any similar aggressions in future. Other detaiis, necessary  
for your full information of the state of things between this  
country and that, shall be the subject of another communica-  
tion. In reviewing these injuries from some of the belliger-  
ent powers, the moderation, the firmness and the wisdom of  
the legislature will all be called into action. We ought still  
to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as  
well as of character will produce the justice we are bound to  
expect. But should any nation deceive itself byfalse calcula-  
tions, and disappoint that expectation, we must join in the  
unprofitable contest, of trying which party can do the other  
the most harm. Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a  
peaceable remedy. Where that is competent it is always most  
desirable. But some of them are of a nature to be met by  
force only, and all of them may lead toit. I cannot therefore  
but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for.  
The first object is to place our sea port towns out of the dan-  
ger of insult. Measures have been already taken for furnish-  
ing them with heavy cannon for the service of such land bat-  
teries as may make a part of their defence against armed ves-  
sels approaching them. In aid of these it is desirable we  
should have a competent number of gun-boats, and the num-  
ber to be competent must be considerable. If immediately  
begun, they may be in readiness for service at the opening of  
thenext season. Whether it will be necessary to augment our  
land forces will be decided by occurrences probably in the  
course of your session.—In the mean time you will consider  
whether it would not be expedient, for a state of peace as well

as of war, so. to organize or class the militia, as would enable  
ws. on any sudden emergency, to call for the services of the  
younger portions, unincumbered with the old and those havy-  
ing families. Upwards of three hundred thousand able bodi-  
ed men, between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six years,  
which the last census shews we may now count within our  
limits, will furnish a competent number for offence or defence,  
in any point where they may be wanted, and will give time for  
raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall become  
certain ; and the reducing to the earlier period of life all its  
active service cannot but be desirable to our younger citizens,  
of the present as well as future times, inasmuch as it engages  
to them in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose  
in the bosom of their families.—I cannot then but earnestly re-  
commend to your early consideration the expediency of so  
modifying our militia system as, by-a separation of the more  
active part from that which is less so, we may draw from it,  
when necessary, an efficient corps, fit for real and active ser-  
vice, and to be called to it in regular rotation.  
  
Considerable provision has been. made under former author-  
ities from Congress, of materials for the construction ot ships  
of war of seventy-four guns. ‘These materials are on hand  
subject tothe further will of the legislature.  
  
An immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms and  
ammunition is also submitted to your determination.  
  
Turning from these unpleasant views of violence and&#x27;wrong,  
I congratulate you on the liberation of our fellow-citizens who  
were stranded on the coast of Tripoli and made prisoners of

tion with the troops of the Ex-Bashaw of that country, gal-

squadron destined for Tripoli, would have availed themselves  
to emulate the acts of valour exhibited by their brethren in the  
attack of the last year. Reflecting with high satisfaction on  
the distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions per-  
mitted in the late Mediterranean service, I think it would be  
an useful encouragement, as well as a just reward, to make an  
opening for some present promotion by enlarging our peace  
establishment of Captains and Lieutenants.  
  
WithTunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet suf-  
ficiently explained, but friendly discussions with their ambas-  
sador recently arrived, and a mutual disposition to do whate-  
ver is just and reasonable cannot fail of dissipating these. So  
that we may consider our peace on that coast, generally, to be  
on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still  
it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole  
of our force from that sea.  
  
The law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the  
number of frigates which shall be kept in constant service in  
time of peace ; and prescribes that they shall be manned by  
not more than two thirds of their complement of seamen and  
ordinary seamen.— Whether a frigate may be trusted to two  
thirds only of her proper complement of men must depend on  
the nature of the service on which she is ordered. That may  
sometimes for her safety, as well as to ensure her object, re-  
quire her fullest complement. In adverting to this subject  
Congress will perhaps consider whether the best limitation on  
the Executive discretion in this case would not be by the num-  
ber of seamen which may be employed in the whole service,  
rather than by the number of vessels, Occasions oftener arise  
for the employmert of small, than of large vessels: and it  
would lessen risk as well as expense, to be authorized to em-  
ploy them of preference. The limitation suggested by the  
number of seamen would admit a selection of vessels best  
adapted to the service.  
  
Our Indian neighbours are advancing, many of them with  
spirit, and others beginning to engage, in the pursuits of agri-  
culture and household manufacture. They are becoming sen-  
sible that the earth yields subsistence with less labour than  
the forest, and find it their interest from time to time to dis-

pose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the means of  
improving those they occupy, and of subsisting their families  
while they are preparing theirfarms. Since your last session,  
the northern tribes have sold to us the lands between the Con-  
necticut reserve and the former Indian boundary, and those  
on the Ohio, from the same boundary to the rapids, and fora  
considerable depth inland. ‘The Chickasaws and Cherokees  
have sold us the country between and adjacent to the two dis-  
tricts of Tennesee, andthe Creeks the residue of their lands  
m the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatche. The three  
former purchases are important, inasmuch as they consolidate  
disjointed parts of our settled country, and render their inter-  
course sectire; and the second particularly so as, with the  
small point onthe river which we expect is by this time ceded  
by the Piankeshaws, it completes our possession of the whole  
of both banks o* the Ohio, from its source to near its mouth,  
and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered forever  
safe to our citizens settled and settling on its extensive waters.  
The purchase from the Creeks too has been for some time  
particularly interesting to the state of Georgia.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of  
* America.  
  
AT a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion, and arm-  
ing against each other, when those with whom we have principal inter-  
course are engaged in the general contest, and when the countenance of  
some of them towards our peaceful country threatens that even that may  
not be unaffected by what is passing on the general theatre, a meeting of  
the representatives of the nation in both houses of congress has become  
more than usually desirable. Coming from every section of our country,  
they bring with them the sentiments and the information of the whole, and  
will be enabled to give a direction to the public affairs which the will and  
the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.  
  
In taking a view of the state of our country, we, in the first place, no-  
tice the great affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which, in  
latter times, has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in his good-  
ness gave it an early termination on this occasion, and lessened the num-  
ber of victims which have usually fallen before it. In the course of the se-  
veral visitations of this disease, it has appeared that it is strictly local, inci-  
dent to cities, and on the tide water only; incommunicable in the country, ei-  
ther by persons under the disease, or by goods carried from diseased places ;  
that its access is with the autumn, and it disappears with the early frosts.  
These restrictions, within narrow limits of time and space, give security  
even to our maritime cities, during three-fourths of the year, and in the  
country always. Although from these facts it appears unnecessary, yet, to  
satisfy the fears of foreign nations, and cautions on their part not to be  
complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them, I have  
strictly enjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to certify with  
exact truth, for every vessel sailing for a foreign port, the state of health  
respecting this fever which prevails at the place from which she sails.  
Under every motive from character and duty to certify the truth, I have  
no doubt&#x27;they have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real injury  
has, however, been sustained from a propensity to identify with this en-  
demic, and to call by the same name, fevers of very different kinds, which  
have been known at all times, and in all countries, and never have been  
placed among those deemed contagious. As we advance in our knowledge  
of this disease, as facts develope the source from which individuals re-  
ceive it, the state authorities charged with the care of the public health,

300,000 able-bodied men, between the ages of 18 and 26 vears, which the  
last census shows we may now count within our limits, will furnish a com-  
petent number for offence or defence, in any point where they may be

An operation by land, by a small band of our countrymen, and others en-

4 THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE,  
  
portunities of which the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tri®  
poli would have availed themselves, to emulate the acts of valour exhi-  
bited by their brethren in the attack of the last year. Reflecting with high  
satisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions  
permitted in the Mediterranean service, I think it would be a useful en-  
couragement, as well as a just reward to make an opening for some pre-  
sent promotion by enlarging our peace establishment of captains and lieu-  
tenants.  
  
With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently ex-  
plained, but friendly discussions with their ambassador recently arriv-  
ed, and a mutual disposition to do whatever is just and reasonable, cannot  
fail of dissipating these : so that we may consider our peace on that coast,  
generally, tobe on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time.  
Still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our  
force from that sea.  
  
The law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the number of  
frigates which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace ; and  
prescribes that they shall be manned by not more than two-thirds of  
their complement of seamen and ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate  
may be trusted to two-thirds only of her proper complement of men must  
depend on the nature of the service on which she is ordered. That may  
sometimes for her safety, as well as to ensure her object, require her ful-  
lest complement. In adverting to this subject, congress will perhaps con-  
sider whether the best limitation on the executive discretion in this case  
would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the  
whole service, rather than by the number of vessels. Occasions oftener  
arise for the employment of small, than of large vessels ; and it would les-  
sen risk as well as expence, to be authorised to employ them of preference.  
The limitation suggested by the number of seamen would admit a selec-  
tion of vessels best adapted to the service.  
  
Our Indian neighbours are advancing, many of them with spirit, and  
others beginning to engage, in the pursuits of agriculture and household  
manufacture. ‘They are becoming sensible that the earth yields subsis-  
tence with less labour than the forest, and find it their interest from time  
to time to dispose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the means  
of improving those they occupy, and of subsisting their families while  
they are preparing their farms. Since your last session, the northern  
tribes have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut reserve and the  
former Indian boundary, and those on the Ohio, from the same boundary  
to the rapids, and for a considerable depth inland. The Chickasaws and  
Cherokees have sold us the country between and adjacent to the two dis-  
tricts of Tenessee, and the Creeks the residue of their lands in the fork  
of Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatche. The three former purchases are  
important, inasmuch as they consolidate disjointed parts of our settled  
country, and render their intercourse secure ; and the second particularly  
so as, with the small point on the river which we expect is by this time  
ceded by the Piankeshaws, it completes our possession of the whole of both  
banks of the Ohio, from its source to near its mouth, and the navigation  
of that river is thereby rendered for ever secure to our citizens settled  
and settling on its extensive waters. The purchase from the Creeks too  
has been for some time particularly interesting to the state of Georgia.  
  
The several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to  
both houses of congress for the exercise of their respective functions.  
  
Deputations now on their way to the seat of government, from various  
nations of Indians, inhabiting the Missouri and other parts beyond the  
Mississippi, come charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the  
new relations in which they are placed with us, of their disposition to cul

the state of our country, we, in the first place, notice the late  
affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever, which in  
latter times has occasionally visited our shores. Providence,  
  
in his goodness, gave it an early termination on this occasion,.  
  
and lessened the number of victims which have usually fallen  
before it. In the course of the several visitations by this disease,  
it has appeared that it is strictly local, incident to cities, and on  
the tide waters only, incommunicable in the country, either by  
persons under the disease, or by goods carried from diseased  
places; that its access is with the autumn, and it disappears  
with the early frosts. ‘These restrictions, within narrow limits

object is to place our sea port towns out of the danger of in-  
sult; measures have already been taken for furnishing them  
with heavy cannon, for the service of such land batteries as  
may make a part of their defence against armed vessels ap-  
peeeene them. In aid of these, it is desirable we should  
  
ave a competent number of gun boats, and the number to be  
competent must be considerable. If immediately begun they  
may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next ses-

liance with France. Mr. Jefferson in his message to Con­  
gressof the Sd December, 1305, gave a general but just  
view of our foreign relations. Ho said—* Since out last  
‘ meeting, the aspect ol our foreign rotations ha* conside­  
rably changed. Our coasts have been infested and our  
harbors watched by private armed vessels, sdinu ol them  
* without commissions, somo with illegal commissions,  
others with those of legal form, hut committing piratical  
acts bo)omJ the autkoiity of their commission?. They  
* havo captured iu the very entrance of our harbours as well  
as on tho high seas, not only the vessels of our friends co­  
ining to tiade with us, but our own also. They have car­  
* ried them off-, under pretcucc of legal adjudication; but not  
daiiug to appioach a court of justice, they have pluiuler­  
‘ sd and sunk them by the way, iu obscure places where no  
* evidence could arise against them; maltreated the crows  
am) ahaudouod them iu boat* iu tho open aea# or on dc­  
* sert shores, without lood or covering. Tiles* enormities  
‘appearing to be unreached by any control of their *o­  
‘ voreigns, I lound it necessary to equip a loice, to cruise  
* within our own seas, to arrest all vessels ol these do­  
* srnptions (ouml hovering on our coasts, within the limit.  
*.d the Gulpli stream, and to bring the offenders iu lor trial |  
* pii4te?. 1 h»j same system of hovering on our coast? 1  
* and harbors, under color ol seeking enemies, has been!  
* also carried on by public armed ships, to the groat annoy- 1  
‘ at.ee and oppression ot our commerce. New principles ■  
* too, have been iuieipolaled into the law ol nations, found- 1  
4 rd neither in justice nor lh* tH.tgc or acknowledgment «  
‘ V&#x27;r.. Avcording to Hieso, a belligerent takes to  
•itself a commerce will, ils own enemy, which it denies to I  
•a neutral, on the ground ol its aiding that enemy iu the j  
‘war. But reason revolts at such an incondstabcy; and &#x27;

0 providing *ii effectual and determined opposition to a 1  
* doctrine ...» injurious to (he rights ol peaceable nation..  
* Indeed, the confidence we ought lo hav« in the justice  
* of others, still countenances the hope, that a sounder i  
•view ol those rights will of itself induce from every,  
* belligerent a more correct observance of them.—Willi j

connected with them. \ el the same practices are re- I  
newrd in the present war, and are already ol great i  
amount. On the Mobile, our commerce paadnnr through  
■ that rive, continues to he obstructed by arbitrary dulir* ;  
‘ and icxatiou. searches. Propositions lor sdjutlin*&#x27; atni­  
* cahly the. boundaries of Louisiana, have not been acceded &#x27;

conllirls ol authority, the i.suc of which may not he ea­

‘ Irnrn our confidence. Inroads havo been recently made •

injuries from some of the bclligeient power*, Ihe mode

‘not but be desirable to our youngest citizens of the present cs well as

Subsequent experience has demonstrated the necessity of separating  
the more active portion of the militia from the less so, but this should  
not be done by an arbitrary divjsion according to age. Not all young  
men are active, nor do they all have any military taste or ability, or

“In taking a view of the state of our country, we, in th  
first place, notice the late affliction of two of our citiog  
under the fatal fever which,in latter times, has occasionally  
visited our shores. Providence, in his goodness, gave jt an  
early termination on this occasion, aa lessened the num  
ber of its victims which have usually fallen before jt In  
the course of the several visitations of this disease, jt has  
appeared that it is strictly local, incident to cities and oy  
the tide-waters only, incommunicable in the country either  
by persons under the disease or by goods carried from  
diseased places; that its access is with the autumn and jt  
disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions within  
narrow limits of time and space give security even to our  
maritime cities during three-fourths of the year, and to the  
country always. Although from these facts it appears  
unnecessary, yet, to satisfy the fear of foreign nations, and  
cautions on their part, not to be complained of ina danger  
whose limits are unknown to them, I have strictly enjoined  
on the officers at the head of the customs to certify with  
exact truth for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the  
state of health respecting this fever which prevails at the  
place from which she sails. Under every motive from char.  
acter and duty to certify the truth,I have no doubt they  
have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real injury  
has, however, been sustained from a propensity to identify  
with this endemic, and to call by the same name fevers of  
very different kind, and which have been known at all  
times and in all countries, and never have been placed  
among those deemed contagious. As we advance in our  
knowledge of this disease, as facts develop the sources from  
which individuals receive it, the State authorities charged  
with the care of the public health, and Congress with that  
of the general commerce, will become able to regulate with  
effect their respective functions in those departments. The  
burdens of quarantine are felt at home as well as abroad;  
their efficacy merits examination. Although the health laws  
of the States should be found to need no present revisal by  
Congress, yet, commerce claims that their attention be ever  
awake to them”.

Congress Jefferson recommended it to consider  
&quot;whether it would not be expedient for a state  
of peace as well as of war so to organize a class  
of the militia as would enable us, on a sudden  
emergency, to call for the service of the younger  
portions, unincumbered with the old or those  
having families.&quot; He estimated that there were  
then &quot;upward of three hundred thousand able­  
bodied men, between the ages of 18 and 20  
years,&quot; that could be counted on &quot;to furnish a  
competent number for offence or defence in any  
  
point where they may be wanted and give time  
for raising regular forces after the necessity of  
them shall become certain.&quot; &quot;I cannot, then,&quot;  
he added, &quot;but earnestly recommend to your  
consideration the expediency of so modifying  
our militia system as, by a separation of the  
active from that which is less so, we may draw  
from it, whenever necessary, an efficient corps  
fit for real and active service, and to be called  
to it in regular rotation.
