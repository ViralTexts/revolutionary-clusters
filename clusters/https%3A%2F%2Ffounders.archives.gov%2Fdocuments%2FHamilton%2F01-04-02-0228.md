be urged as the chief objections to reposing the power in question in a body of men.  
Those who have themselves reflected upon the subject, or who have attended to the observations made in other parts of these papers, in relation to the appointment of the President, will I presume agree to the position that there would always be great probability of having the place supplied by a man of abilities, at least respectable. Premising this, I proceed to lay it down as a rule, that one man of discernment is better fitted to analise and estimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular offices, than a body of men of equal, or perhaps even of superior discernment.  
The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will on this account feel himself under stronger obligations, and more interested to investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the fairest pretentions to them. He will have fewer personal attachments to gratify than a body of men, who may each be supposed to have an equal number, and will be so much the less liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of affection. A single well directed man by a single understanding, cannot be distracted and warped by that diversity of views, feelings and interests, which frequently distract and warp the resolutions of a collective body. There is nothing so apt to agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations, whether they relate to ourselves or to others, who are to be the objects of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices by an assembly of men, we must expect to see a full display of all the private and party likings and dislikes, partialities and antipathies, attachments and animosities, which are felt by those who compose the assembly. The choice which may at any time happen to be made under such circumstances will of course be the result either of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the first, the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party will be more considered than those which fit the person for the station. In the last the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested equivalent—“Give us the man we wish for this office, and you shall have the one you wish for that.” This will be the usual condition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the advancement of the public service will be the primary object either of party victories or of party negociations.  
The truth of the principles here advanced seems to have been felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault with the provision made in this respect by the Convention. They contend that the President ought solely to have been authorized to make the appointments under the Fœderal Government. But it is easy to shew that every advantage to be expected from such an arrangement would in substance be derived from the power of nomination, which is proposed to be conferred upon him; while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power of appointment in the hands of that officer, would be avoided. In the act of nomination his judgment alone would be exercised; and as it would be his sole duty to point out the man, who with the approbation of the Senate should fill an office, his responsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the final appointment. There can in this view be no difference between nominating and appointing. The same motives which would influence a proper discharge of his duty in one case would exist in the other. And as no man could be appointed, but upon his previous nomination, every man who might be appointed would be in fact his choice.  
But might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it might, yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by himself. The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference, though perhaps not in the first degree. It is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled. The Senate could not be tempted by the preference they might feel to another to reject the one proposed; because they could not assure themselves that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They could not even be certain that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them: And as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected; and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate; it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal.  
To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though in general a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. And, in addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.  
It will readily be comprehended, that a man, who had himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body; and that body an entire branch of the Legislature. The possibility of rejection would be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger to his own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body, whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who had no other merit, than that of coming from the same State to which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.  
To this reasoning, it has been objected, that the President by the influence of the power of nomination may secure the compliance of the Senate to his views. The supposition of universal venality in human nature is little less an error in political reasoning than the supposition of universal rectitude. The institution of delegated power implies that there is a portion of virtue and honor among mankind, which may be a reasonable foundation of confidence. And experience justifies the theory: It has been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of the most corrupt governments. The venality of th

actical exposition assumed on the first  
occasion, which seems to have occurred in President Washington’s adminis-  
tration, was, that the option belonged to the executive to adopt either mode,  
and the Senate might advise before, as well as after, the formation of a treaty.  
Since that period, the Senate have been rarely, if ever, consulted, until after  
a treaty has been completed, and laid before them for ratification.”  
  
The section of the Commentaries on the power of the president  
to appoint to office, will be read with peculiar attention and inter-  
est. The Judge thinks, and we agree with him, that “one man  
of discernment is better fitted to analyze and estimate the peculiar  
qualities adapted to particular offices, than any body of men of

that our experience will warrant the Judge in what follows.  
  
‘‘ His sole and undivided responsibility will naturally beget a livelier sense

ower of appointment is not  
vested in the President, but only the right to make a  
norination, which becomes an appointment only when  
the nomination has been confirmed by the Senate, the  
power of removing a public officer calinot be deemed an  
executive power solely within the meaning of this pror  
vision of the Constitution.  
This view of the subject is in harmony with the opinion  
expressed in the seventy-sixth number of the Federallet.  
After stating with great force the objections which exist  
to the &quot;exereise of the power of appointing to office by  
an assembly of men,&quot; the writer proceeds to say:  
The truth of the principles here advanced seems to hare been felt  
by the most ratelligent of those whe have found fault with the pror­  
vision made in this respect by the conventien. They coatend that  
the President ought sulely to have been authorised to make the  
appointinents under the Pederal Government. But it is easy to  
thow thet every adrantags to be expected from such an arrange­  
menl would in substance be derived from the power of homt­  
autton, which ls proposed to he conferred upon him, while several disad­  
vaniages which might attend the alaolute power af appointment in the  
hands of that offcer would he avolded. In the act of nomlnating his judg­  
mneat alone would be exereiaed, and as it would be bis sole duty to peint  
out the man who with the approbation of the Srnate sbould all an pilice,  
his responsibility would be at coinplete as if he wers to make the final  
appointment. There can in this view, be no difference betneen nomalm­  
ting and appolating. The ssme motives which would inttucace a piroper  
discharge of his duty le one case would wrirt in the wther, sad as no sas  
could be appointed but upon his prenions nomination, every mat tho  
might be appointed would be in fact his chulce.  
Bat his pomisation may be overruled. This it certainly may, yet it  
can ouly be ta aake placs for ansther nemination by hinselt. The per­  
ton ultimately sppemted wust be the ouject of his preference, though,  
perhaps not in the inghest degree. I is also not very prohabile that his  
Lomination would often be overruled. The Senate could not be tempted  
by the preference thef might feel to another to reject the one proposed  
because they coald nol assure themselves that the person they might wish  
would be brought forward by a secoind, ar by any subsequent amiaination.  
They ceald not even be certain that a future nomination would present a  
thadidete in any segres more seceptable to them. Ane as their thascat  
might cast a Yind of ath ma upon the indirjdual rejected, and might have  
the appesrance of a reslection upon the judgment of the Chief Magistrate,  
st is hot likely thit their sanctinn would often be relused, where thers  
vere not special and strong reasoar for the refusl,  
i Te what purpose then require the cooperation of the Senate? I  
mhawer that the becessity of their cobcurrence would have a powerfal,  
though in general, a silent operation. It would be as excellent eheck  
wpen the spirit of tavoritiam in the Prerident, and would tend greailr to  
preversing the appointment of unit characters, from State prejadice,  
hom family conavetion, from personal attachment, ar fro a lew te  
populerity. And, in addition to this, is would be an esteaciens source of  
stability in the administration.  
It will readily be comprehended that a man who had himself the sole,  
diapsaltioa of eftes would be geverned much more by his privats inclihs.  
tions and interests than when be was bound to submnit the propriety of his  
cbeice to the dictation and etermination of a different and lndependent  
body, and that body an extire branch of the begislatare. The potsibilty  
of rejection woald be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger  
ofhis ew a reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his  
political erlalence, from betraving a spirit of lavoritian, or in unbecomlay  
purswit of papularity, to the ohservation of a body yhess opinion would

When the President has made a nomination for a par-­

not imagine an unworthy man in the Presidential chair. Hamilton had written

ary control should be

was where it should be placsd. That it  
ought to be in a body independent of the  
executive, and not in any council of min

essary&#x27; independence with the othsr quail­  
ties needful for a right exercise of this&quot;  
power.  
This subject Is considered in one of the  
Federalist papers written by Alexander  
Hamilton. After defending the wisdom of  
the provision giving to the President the  
right to nominate to office, he says:  
To what purpose, then, require theco-operation  
of the Senat3? I answer, that the  
necessity of k their concurrence would have  
a powerful, though. In genraL a silent

the appointment of unfit characters from  
State prejudlc?, from family connection,  
from personal attachment, or from a view  
to popularity. In addition to this, it would

administration. It will readily be compre­  
hended that a man who haa himself the  
sole disposition of offices, would be gov­  
erned much more by private inclinations  
and interests, than when he was bound  
to submit the propriety of his choice to  
the discussion and determination of a dif
