 which is a limestone quarry, and also my interest in a tract of land lying in Louisa county, reputed  
to contain two hundred acres and not far from the said limestone quarry.  
I devise my house and lot or lots in the city of Washington to my beloved wife and her heirs.  
I give and bequeath my ownership in the negroes and people of colour held by me to my dear Wife, but it is my  
desire that none of them should be sold without his or her consent or in the case of their misbehaviour; except that  
infant children may be sold with their Parent who consents for them to be sold with him or her, and who consents to be  
sold.  
I give all my personal estate of every description, ornamental as well as useful, except as herein after  
otherwise given, to my dear Wife; And I also give to her all my manuscript papers, having entire confidence in her  
discreet and proper use of them, but subject to the qualification in the succeeding clauses.  
Considering the peculiarity and magnitude of the occasion which produced the Convention at Philadelphia in  
1787, the Characters who composed it, the Constitution which resulted from their deliberations, its effects during a  
trial of so many years on the prosperity of the people living under it, and the interest it has inspired among the  
friends of free Government, it is not an unreasonable inference that a careful and extended report of the  
proceedings and discussions of that body, which were with closed doors, by a member who was constant in his  
attendance, will be particularly gratifying to the people of the United States, and to all who take an interest in the  
progress of political science and the cause of true liberty, It is my desire that the Report as made by me should be  
published under her authority and direction, and as the publication may yield a considerable amount beyond the necessary  
expenses thereof; I give the net proceeds thereof to my Wife charged with the following legacies to be paid  
out of that fund only—first I give to Ralph Randolph Gurley Secretary of the American Colonization Society to  
his executors and administrators the sum of two thousand dollars, in trust nevertheless that he shall appropriate the same  
to the use and purposes of the said Society whether the same be incorporated by law or not.  
I give fifteen hundred dollars to the University of Virginia, one thousand dollars to the College of Nassau  
Hall at Princeton, New Jersey, and one thousand dollars to the College at Uniontown Pensylvania, for the benefit of their  
respective libraries; and it is my Will that if the said fund should not be sufficient to pay the whole of the three last  
legacies that they abate in proportion.  
I further direct that there be paid out of the same fund to the guardian of
