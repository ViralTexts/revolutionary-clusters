 I pay no attention to the result, leaving that to yourself who alone have a view of the whole ground. Christopher Ellery, the subject of the inclosed letter from mr Collins was one of the most active of our friends in R.I. at in the times of our trials whether our government should be republican in practice as well as profession. he came into the Senate when I came into the administration and assisted in giving us a majority in that body. nor was there a more zealous or active one in it. he is a good republican, a good man and of good understanding.

King is ready to risk the union for any chance of restoring his party to power and wriggling himself to the head of it. nor is Clinton without his hopes nor scrupulous as to the means of fulfilling them.
