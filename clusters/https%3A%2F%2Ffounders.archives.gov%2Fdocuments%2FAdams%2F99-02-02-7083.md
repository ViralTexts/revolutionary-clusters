Dear Sir — I thank you ior your address  
to the New Bedford Auxiliary Society for  
the suppression ol intemperance, which  
I have read with pleasure and edification.  
It abounds in ingenuity and information.  
It is eloquent and pathetic, it is pious  
and virtuous—it addresses itself to the  
understanding and the heart.  
A drunhaul is the most selfish being in  
the universe. He has no sense ol modesty,  
shame or disgrace; he has no sense of  
duty, or sympathy of affection w ith his  
father or mother, his brother or sister, his  
f riend or neighbour, bis wife or children ;  
no reverence for his God ; no sense of  
futurity in this world or the other—all is  
swallowed upin the mad selfish joy of the  
moment.  
Is it not humiliating that Mahometans  
and Hindoos should put to shame the  
whole Christian world, by their superior  
examples ol temperance ? Is it not de­  
grading to Englishmen and Americans,  
that they are so infinitely exceeded by  
the French in this cardinal virtue ? And  
is it not mortify ing beyond all expression,  
that we Americans should exceed all o­  
ther eight millions of people on the globe,  
as I verily believe we do, in this degrad­  
ing, beastly vice ot Intemperance ? I  
am, sir, your obedient friend and humble  
•e^ant, JOHN ADAMS

INTEMPERANCE.  
In testimony against the vice, we take pleasure  
in citing the following extract of a letter from a late  
President of the U. S. It furnishes texts for vol­  
umes of useful comment. It would be an easy task  
to verify these forcible, but just expressions, by citing  
copiously from the best histories of mankind, and  
[-Esacx Patriot.  
&quot; A drunkard, (says he,) is the most selfish being  
in the universe, He has no sense of modesty,  
shame or disgrace ; he has no sense of duty, or  
sympathy of affection with his father or mother, his  
brother or sister, his friend or neighbour, his wife  
or children; nor reverence for his God; no sense of  
futurity in this world or the other—all is swallowed  
up in the mad, mad, selfish joy of the moment.  
Is it not humiliating, that Mahometans and Hindoos  
should put to shame the whole Christian world,  
by their superior examples of temperance ? I« it  
not degrading to Englishmen and Americans, that  
they are so infinitely exceeded by the French, in  
this cardinal virtue ? And is it not mortifying, beyond  
„11 expression, that we Americans should exceed all  
other eight millions of people on the globe, as I verily  
believe we do, in this degrading, beastly vice of  
intemperance ?

Dear Bir: 1 tbankyou for your addrest  
to the Mew Bedford Auxiliary Society for  
the Suppression of Intemperance, which  
I have read with pleasure and edification.  
It abounds In lugenuity and information:  
it la elegant and pathetic j it is pious and  
virtuous-, it addresses itself to the under­  
standing and the heart.  
A drunkard is the most selfish being In  
tiie universe, lie hu no sense ol modesty,  
shame or disgrace, lie has no sense ol  
duty, or sympathy {ol afiectlon with hit  
father or mother, his brother or slater, his  
friend or neighbor, his wife or children;  
no reverence for his Ued; no sense of to  
turlty In this world or the other?all ii  
swallowed np In the mad, selfish Joy ol  
&#x27; the moment.  
Is It not humiliating, that Mahometani  
. and Hindoos should put to shame the  
whole Uhrlstlan world, by their superloi  
examples .of temperance? I* It not de­  
grading to Knglishmen and American!  
that .they are eo Infinitely exceeded b]

Is it not tnortllylng bevond all expression

Quincy, February 21, 1819.  
Dear Sir :  
I thank you for your address  
to the New Bedford Auxiliary So­  
ciety for the suppression of intem­  
perance, which I have read with  
pleasure and edification. It abounds  
in ingenuity and information, it  
is elegant and pathetic; it is pi­  
ous and virtuous; it addresses it­  
self to the understanding and the  
heart.  
A drunkard is the most selfish  
being in the universe. He has no  
sense ol duty, or sympathy or af­  
fection with his father or mother,  
brother-or sister, his friend or neigh­  
bor, his wife or children; no rever­  
ence for his God; no sense of tm  
turity in this world or the other—  
all ie swallowed up in the mad,  
selfish joy of the moment.  
Is it not humiliating, that Ma­  
hommedans and Hindoos should  
put to shame the whole Christian  
world, by their superior example  
of Temperance? Is it not de­  
grading to Englishmen and Amer­  
icans that they are so infinitely  
exceeded by the French in this  
cardinal virtue? And is it not  
mortifying beyond all expression,  
that we Americans should exceed  
all other eight miliione of people  
on the globe, as I verily believe  
we do, in this degrading, beastly  
vice of intemperance?  
I am, Sir, your obliged friend  
and humble servant,  
John Adams
