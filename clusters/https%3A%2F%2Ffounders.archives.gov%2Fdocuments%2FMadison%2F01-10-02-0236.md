January 1788]  
The second point to be examined is, whether the convention were authorised to frame and propose this mixed constitution.  
The powers of the convention ought in strictness to be determined by an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their respective constituents. As all of these however, had reference, either to the recommendation from the meeting at Annapolis in September, 1786, or to that from congress in February, 1787, it will be sufficient to recur to these particular acts.  
The act from Annapolis recommends the “appointment of commissioners to take into consideration the situation of the United States, to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union; and to report such an act for that purpose, to the United States in congress assembled, as, when agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state, will effectually provide for the same.”  
The recommendatory act of congress is in the words following: “Whereas there is provision in the articles of confederation and perpetual union, for making alterations therein, by the assent of a congress of the United States, and of the legislatures of the several states: And whereas experience hath evinced, that there are defects in the present confederation, as a mean to remedy which several of the states, and particularly the state of New-York, by express instructions to their delegates in congress, have suggested a convention for the purposes expressed in the following resolution; and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing in these states, a firm national government.”  
“Resolved, That in the opinion of congress, it is expedient, that on the 2d Monday in May next, a convention of delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several states, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation, and reporting to congress and the several legislatures, such alterations and provisions therein, as shall, when agreed to in congress, and confirmed by the states, render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union.”  
  
From these two acts it appears, 1st. that the object of the convention was to establish in these states, a firm national government; 2d. that this government was to be such as would be adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union; 3d. that these purposes were to be effected by alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation, as it is expressed in the act of congress, or by such further provisions as should appear necessary, as it stands in the recommendatory act from Annapolis; 4th. that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to congress, and to the states, in order to be agreed to by the former, and confirmed by the latter.  
From a comparison and fair construction of these several modes of expression, is to be deduced the authority under which the convention acted. They were to frame a national government, adequate to the exigencies of government and of the union, and to reduce the articles of confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes.  
There are two rules of construction dictated by plain reason, as well as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every part of the expression ought, if possible, to be allowed some meaning, and be made to conspire to some common end. The other is, that where the several parts cannot be made to coincide, the less important should give way to the more important part; the means should be sacrificed to the end, rather than the end to the means.  
Suppose then that the expressions defining the authority of the convention, were irreconcileably at variance with each other; that a national and adequate government could not possibly, in the judgment of the convention, be effected by alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation, which part of the definition ought to have been embraced, and which rejected? Which was the more important, which the less important part? Which the end, which the means? Let the most scrupulous expositors of delegated powers; let the most inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention, answer these questions. Let them declare, whether it was of most importance to the happiness of the people of America, that the articles of confederation should be disregarded, and an adequate government be provided, and the union preserved; or that an adequate government should be omitted, and the articles of confederation preserved. Let them declare, whether the preservation of these articles was the end for securing which a reform of the government was to be introduced as the means; or whether the establishment of a government, adequate to the national happiness, was the end at which these articles themselves originally aimed, and to which they ought, as insufficient means, to have been sacrificed.  
But is it necessary to suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcileable to each other; that no alterations or provisions in the articles of the confederation, could possibly mould them into a national and adequate government; into such a government as has been proposed by the convention?  
No stress it is presumed will in this case be laid on the title, a change of that could never be deemed an exercise of ungranted power. Alterations in the body of the instrument, are expressly authorised. New provisions therein are also expressly authorised. Here then is a power to change the title; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long as a part of the old articles remain? Those who maintain the affirmative, ought at least to mark the boundary between authorised and usurped innovations, between that degree of change which lies within the compass of alterations and further provisions; and that which amounts to a transmutation of the government. Will it be said that th

ntial reform had not been in contemplation. Will it be said that the fundamental principles of the confederation were not within the purview of the convention, and ought not to have been varied? I ask what are these principles? Do they require that in the establishment of the constitution, the states should be regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns? They are so regarded by the constitution proposed. Do they require that the members of the government should derive their appointment from the legislatures, not from the people of the states? One branch of the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures; and under the confederation the delegates to congress may all be appointed immediately by the people, and in two states  
Connecticut and Rhode-Island.  
are actually so appointed. Do they require that the powers of the government should act on the states, and not immediately on individuals? In some instances, as has been shewn, the powers of the new government will act on the states in their collective characters. In some instances also those of the existing government act immediately on individuals: In cases of capture, of piracy, of the post-office, of coins, weights and measures, of trade with the Indians, of claims under grants of land by different states, and above all, in the case of trials by courts-martial in the army and navy, by which death may be inflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil magistrate; in all these cases the powers of the confederation operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual citizens. Do these fundamental principles require particularly that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of the states? The confederation itself authorises a direct tax to a certain extent on the post-office. The power of coinage has been so construed by congress, as to levy a tribute immediately from that source also. But pretermitting these instances, was it not an acknowledged object of the convention, and the universal expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be submitted to the general government in such a form as would render it an immediate source of general revenue? Had not congress repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the confederation? Had not every state but one, had not New-York herself, so far complied with the plan of congress, as to recognize the principle of the innovation? Do these principles in fine require that the powers of the general government should be limited, and that beyond this limit, the states should be left in possession of their sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new government as in the old, the general powers are limited, and that the states, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction.  
The truth is, that the great principles of the constitution proposed by the convention, may be considered less as absolutely new, than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of confederation. The misfortune under the latter system has been, that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it; and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new system, the aspect of an entire transformation of the old.  
In one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from the tenor of their commission. Instead of reporting a plan requiring the confirmation of all the states, they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed and may be carried into effect by nine states only. It is worthy of remark, that this objection, though the most plausible, has been the least urged in the publications which have swarmed against the convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting the fate of twelve states, to the perverseness or corruption of a thirteenth; from the example of inflexible opposition given by a majority of one sixtieth of the people of America, to a measure approved and called for by the voice of twelve states comprising fifty-nine sixtieths of the people; an example still fresh in the memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and prosperity of his country. As this objection therefore, has been in a manner waved by those who have criticised the powers of the conventio

to the liberty and prosperity of the United States. They had seen in the origin and progress of the experiment, the alacrity with which the proposition, made by a single state (Virginia) towards a partial amendment of the confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They had seen the liberty assumed by a very few deputies, from a very few states, convened at Annapolis, of recommending a great and critical object, wholly foreign to their commission, not only justified by the public opinion, but actually carried into effect, by twelve out of the Thirteen States. They had seen in a variety of instances, assumptions by congress not only of recommendatory, but of operative powers, warranted in the public estimation, by occasions and objects infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed. They must have reflected, that in all great changes of established governments, forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former, would render nominal and nugatory, the transcendent and precious right of the people to “abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness”  
Declaration of Independence.  
; since it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally, to move in concert towards their object; and it is therefore essential, that such changes be instituted by some informal and unauthorised propositions, made by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number of citizens. They must have recollected that it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the people plans for their safety and happiness, that the states were first united against the danger with which they were threatened by their antient government; that committees and congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts, and defending their rights; and that conventions were elected in the several states, for establishing the constitutions under which they are now governed; nor could it have been forgotten that no little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for adhering to ordinary forms were any where seen, except in those who wished to indulge under these masks, their secret enmity to the substance contended for. They must have borne in mind, that as the plan to be framed and proposed, was to be submitted to the people themselves, the disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it for ever; its approbation blot out all antecedent errors and irregularities. It might even have occurred to them, that where a disposition to cavil prevailed, their neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them, and still more their recommendation of any measure whatever not warranted by their commission

.  
Had the convention under all these impressions, and in the midst of all these considerations, instead of exercising a manly confidence in their country, by whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished, and of pointing out a system capable in their judgment of securing its happiness, taken the cold and sullen resolution of disappointing its ardent hopes of sacrificing substance to forms, of committing the dearest interests of their country to the uncertainties of delay, and the hazard of events; let me ask the man, who can raise his mind to one elevated conception; who can awaken in his bosom, one patriotic emotion, what judgment ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world, by the friends of mankind, by every virtuous citizen, on the conduct and character of this assembly, or if there be a man whose propensity to condemn, is susceptible of no controul, let me then ask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve states who usurped the power of sending deputies to the convention, a body utterly unknown to their constitutions; for congress, who recommended the appointment of this body, equally unknown to the confederation; and for the state of New-York in particular, who first urged, and then complied with this unauthorised interposition.  
But that the objectors may be disarmed of every pretext, it shall be granted for a moment, that the convention were neither authorised by their commission, nor justified by circumstances, in proposing a constitution for their country: Does it follow that the constitution ought for that reason alone to be rejected? If according to the noble precept, it be lawful to accept good advice even from an enemy, shall we set the ignoble example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our friends? The prudent enquiry in all cases, ought surely to be not so much from whom the advice comes, as whether the advice be good.  
The sum of what has been here advanced and proved, is that the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers, except in one instance little urged by the objectors, has no foundation to support it; that if they had exceeded their powers, they were not only warranted but required, as the confidential servants of their country, by the circumstances in which they were placed, to exercise the liberty which they assumed,

1828. } The Federal Constitution. 4A]  
  
On the 21st of February, 1787, and four months after the  
passage of the act of the Virginia Assembly, the Congress of  
the United States made the first constitutional step towards the  
formation of our present Constitution, by the following reso-  
lution :-—  
  
“ Whereas there is provision in the articles of confederation and per-  
petual union, for making alterations therem, by the assent of a Congress  
of the United States, and of the Legislatures of the several States; and  
whereas, experience hath evinced that there are defects in the present  
confederation, as a mean to remedy which, several of the States, and  
particularly the State of New-York, by express instructions to their  
delegates in Congress, have suggested a convention for the purposes ex-  
pressed in the following resolution ; and such convention appearing to  
be the most probable mean of establishing in the States, a firm national  
government,* Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress, it is expe-  
dient, that on the second Monday of May next, a convention of dele-  
gates, who shall have been appointed by the several States, be held at  
Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of  
confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several Legislatures,  
such alterations and provisions therein, as shall, when agreed to in Con-  
gress, and confirmed by the States, render the Federal Constitution  
adequate to the exigencies of Government, and the preservation of the  
Union.”—Jour, Conv. p. 5.

experience has falsified all their prophecies and dissipated their

proposition is, unfortunately for us in the South, too true.  
  
A national government was contemplated by some, earlier  
than is generally imagined. ‘This appears, as our author  
thinks, from the word * national” being introduced into the pre-  
amble of the resolution of the old Congress which called the  
Convention. It expressed an opinion ‘that a Couvention was

scembled, and ratified on the 9th of July, 1778, by a subsequent  
  
Congress ; and, under its sanction, the affairs of the Confede-  
  
. racy were for many years administered.  
  
On the 21.1 of Febraary, 1787, the following preamble and  
resolutions were adopted by the Congress, acting under these  
articles :  
  
“Whereas, there is provision, in the Articles of Confederation and  
Perpetual Union, for making alterations therein, by the assent of a Con-  
gress of the United States, and of the Legislatures of the several States  
—and whereas, experience hath evinced that there are defects in the  
present Confederation, as a mean to remedy which, several of the States,  
and particularly the State of New York, by express instructions to their  
Delegates in Congress, have suggested a Convention, for the parposes  
expressed in the following resolution ; and such Convention appearing  
  
to be the most probable mean of establishing, in these States, a firm Na-  
tional (;overnment—  
  
“ Resolred, That, in the opinion of Congress, it is expedient, that, on  
the second Monday of May next, a Convention of Delegates, who shall  
have been appointed by the several States, be held, at Philadelphia, for  
the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation,  
and reporting to Congress, and the several Legislatures, such alterations  
and provisions therein, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and con-  
firmed by the States, render the Federal Constitution adequate to the ex-  
iencies of Government, and the preservation of the Union.”  
  
From the foregoing resolution it appears—  
  
First. That the convocation of the proposed Convention was  
‘for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of  
Confederation” then existing between the thirteen sovereign,  
free, and independeni States.  
  
Secondly. That the Convention of Delegates were to be cho-  
sen by the several States. And,  
  
Thirdly. That the alterations and provisions to be recom-  
mended by the Convention, should, before going into opera-  
tion, receive the sanction of Congress

Mr. Madison says, (Federalist, No. XL,) “In one particular  
it is admitted that the Convention have departed from the te-  
nor of their commission. [ostead of reporting a plan requiring  
the confirmation of ali the States, they have reported a plan  
which is to be confirmed, and may be carried into effect, by  
nine States only. It is worthy of remark, that this objection,  
though the most plausible, has been u.e least urged in the pub-  
lications which have swarmed against the Constitution. The  
forbearance can only have proceeded from an irresistible con-  
viction of the gross absurdity of subjecting the fate of twelve  
States to the perverseness or corruption of a thiiteenth, from  
the example of inflexible opposition given by a minority of one-  
sixtieth of the People of America, to a measure approved and  
called for by the voice of twelve States, comprising filty-nine  
sixtieths of the People—au example still fresh in the memory  
and indignation of every citizen who felt for the wounded ho-  
ner and prosperity of his country.”

This was a highly important, a critical era in our governmental history.  
The peculiar circumstances of our situation impressed on the minds of  
all the serious and reflecting, the lovers of liberty and of the human race,  
the necessity of a more perfect and permanent union between the states.

They (the members of the convention) must have reflected

changes be instituted by some informal and wnauthorized

was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to  
the people plans for their safety and happiness, that the States  
were first united azainst the danger, with which they were  
threatened by their ancient government; that committees

in the several States for establishing the constitutions under

ernment in which we may trace the first germ of the Consti-  
tution. With his keen and rapid insight into the true, princi-  
ples of representative government, he saw at once the nature  
of the difficulties under which the country was languishing,  
and the remedy ; and from that time he labored to impress  
his views upon those having the direction of public affairs.  
He was so far successful in this endeavor, that the Convention  
held at Annapolis in September, 1786, of which he was a  
member, determined to recommend a general Convention of  
delegates from all the States. They accordingly proposed a  
Convention at Philadelphia, “to devise such further provisions  
as might appear to be necessary to render the Constitution of  
the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the  
Union.”  
  
When this Convention met, in the following spring, the  
Revolutionary Congress and the Confederation had both had  
a fair trial, and both had failed to meet the real wants of the  
country. In the lapse of time all the inherent defects of a  
mere federal compact had become apparent. From the neg-  
. lect of the States to comply with the requisitions of Congress,  
and the want of authority in that body to enforce its ow

with which  
this proposal had to contend. It is enough to  
say that. the diiliouliics of conducting the gov­  
ernment, under the articles of confederation,  
become daily more apparent. Commissioners  
to remedy the federal defects were appointed  
by some of the States, who met at Annapolis  
in 1780 ; and their recommendations were  
communicated to their respective Legislatures,  
and also to the Congress of the United States.  
In February, 1737, Congress took this com­  
muniention into consideration, and in the course  
of discussion adopted a proposition recom­  
mending a convention ofdelcgatcs in May, 1787,  
at Philadelphia, “ for the sole and express purv  
pose of revising the articles of confederation,  
and reporting to Congress and the several Legis—

ﬁrmed by the States, rendcrthc federal consti­

and the preservation of the Union.”  
This convention, called for a. limited purpose  
abut happily assuming a. larger duty—organ­  
ized on the 25th May, 1787, and the Constitu­  
tion, under which we live, is the work of its  
hand. What that Constitution means—what.  
powers it gives, and what powers it reserves to

vernmcnt is to be appointed by these I.o- &#x27;  
latures; and under the Confederation, the 1  
egatcs to Congress raay all be appointed mediately  
by the people; and in two States

wo, the powers of the new Government will c  
on the States in their collective characters. *  
some instances, also, those of the existing  
vernment act immediately on individuals,  
cases of capture, of piracy, of the post t  
ce, of coins, weights and measures, of trade i  
h the Indians, of claims under grnats of! t

e of trials by court-martial in the army or h  
y, by which death may be inflicted with- t  
the intervention of a jury, or even of a (  
il magistrate. ?  
&#x27;In ail these cases the power of the confede- *  
ion operates immediately ou the persons and j

uental principles require, particularly, that 1  
tax should be levied, without the interme- t

assumed by, the Convention, was to provide a Constitution  
adequate to the preservation and government of such a Union.

the Articles of Confederation, and reporting to  
Congress and the several Legislatures such altera­  
tions and vrovuions therein as shall, when agreed  
to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, render  
the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies  
of government and the preservation of the Union &quot;  
.&quot;&quot;&quot;From these two acts it appears, 1st, that the  
object of the Convention was to establish in tnese  
States a Jtnn national government ; 2d, thab.this  
government&#x27;was to be such as would be adequate  
to the exigencies or government and the preservation  
of the Union ; 8d that these purposes were to be  
effected by alterations and provisions tn tne Ar­  
ticles of Confederation, as it is expressed in the  
act of Congress, or by such farther provisions as  
should appear necessary, as it standi in the recom  
mendatory act from annapolis; 4tn, mat tne al­  
terations and provisions were to be reported to  
Congress, and to the States, in order to be agreed  
to by the former, and confirmed by the latter.&quot;  
from a comparison and fair construction ot  
these several modes of expression, is to be deduced  
the authority under which the Convention acted.  
They were to frame a national government, adequate  
to the exigences of government, and of the Union, and  
to reduce the articles of Confederation into such form  
as to accomplish these purposes.  
There are two rules of construction dictated by  
reason, as well as founded on legal axioms. The  
one is, that every part of the expression ought, if  
possible, to be allowed some meaning, and be made  
to conspire to some common end. The other i3,  
that when the several parts cannot be made to coin  
cide, the less important should give way to the more  
important part ; the means should be sacrificed to  
the end rather than the end to the&#x27;means.  
Suppose then that the expressions&#x27; defining the  
authority of the Convention were irreconcilably at  
variance witn eacn otner ; tnat a national ana ade­  
quate government could not possibly, in the judg­  
ment of the Convention, be effected by alterations  
and provisions in the articles of Confederation ;  
which part of the definition ought to have been em­  
braced, and which rejected t , Which was the more  
impoptant, which the less important part f Which  
the end, which the means ? Let the most Scrupu­  
lous expositors of delegated powers ; let the most  
inveterate objectors &#x27;against those exercised by the  
Convention, answer these questions. Let them de­  
clare whether it was of the most importance to the  
happiness of the people of America, that the articles  
of Confederation should be disregarded, and an ader  
quate government be provided, and the Union pre  
served; or that an adequate government should be  
omitted, and the articles of Confederation preserved.  
Let them declare whether the preservation of these  
articles was the end, for securing which a reform of  
the government was to be introduced as the means ;  
or whether the establishment of a government, ade­  
quate to the national happiness, was the end at  
which- these articles themselves originally arrived,  
and to which they ought, as insufficient means, to  
have beensacrificed.  
But is it necessary to. suppose that these ex  
pressions are absolutely irreconcilable to each other;  
that no alterations or provisions in the-articles of  
Confederation, could possibly mould them into a  
national and adequate government; into such a  
government as has been proposed by the Conven­  
tion T &#x27;  
No stress, it is presuu.jd. will, in this case, be  
laid on the titles ; a change of that could never be  
deemed an exercise ot ungranted power. Altera­  
tions in the body of the instrument are expressly  
authorised. Nets provisions therein are also express­  
ly authorised. Here then is a power to change the

Those who maintain the affirmative ought, at least,  
to mark the boundary between authorised and  
usurped innovations ; between that degree of change  
which lies within the compass of alterations and  
further provisions, and that which amounts to a  
transmutation of the government . The  
truth is that the great principles of the Constitution  
proposea Dy tne Convention, may be considered less  
as absolutely new, than as. the expansion of princi­  
ples which are found in the articles of Confedera­  
tion. ; The misfortune under the latter system has  
been that these principles are so feeble and confined  
as to j ustify all the charges of inefficiency which  
nave oeen urged against it ; and to require a degree  
of enlargement, which gives to the new system the  
aspect of an entire transformation of the okl&quot;

in presenting the plan they did, the Convention ex­

mained, mere was not a total cnange ; tne power  
to make new provisions and alterations had not been  
transcended. But Marion asks &quot; will Davidson as­

,&quot; The powers of the Convention ought In strict­  
ness to be determined by an inspection of the com­  
missions given to the members by their respective  
constituents. As all of these, however, had refer­  
ence either to the recommendation from the meet­  
ing at Annapolis, in September, 1780, or that frotn  
Congress, in February, 1787, it will be sufficient to  
recur to these particular acts. -  
The act from Annapolis Tecommends the ap­  
pointment of commissioners to take into, considera­  
tion the situation of the United . Sutcs, to devise  
such further provisions as shall appear to them  
necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal  
government adequate Mhe exigences of the Cn,ion;  
und to report such an act for tfiat.purpose, to the  
United Slates in Congress assembled, as, when  
agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the  
Legislature of every State, will effectually provide  
for the same.  
The recommendatory act of Congress is in the  
words following: &quot;Whereas, there is provision in  
the Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union  
for making alterations therein, by the assent of. a  
Congress of tho United-States, and of the Legisla­  
tures of the several States; and whereas, experience  
hath evinced that there are defects in the present  
Confederation, as a means to remedy which several  
of the States, and particularly the State of New  
York, by express instructions to their delegates .in  
Congress, have suggested a Convention for the pur­  
poses expressed in the following resolutions, and  
such Convention appearing to be the most probable  
means of establishing in these States a firm nation­  
al government :&quot;  
44 Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress, it is  
expedient that on the 2d Monday in May next, a.  
Convention of delegates who shall have been ap­  
pointed by the several States, be held at Philadel­  
phia for the sob and express purpose of reviling  
tie Articles of Confederation, and reporting to  
Congsess and the several Legislatures such alien  
tions and provisions therein as shall, when agreed  
to in Congress, and confirmed by the States, render  
the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies  
of government, and the preservation of the Union.!&quot;  
41 From these two acts it appears, 1st, that the  
object of the Convention was to establish rin these  
States a firm national government; 2d, that this  
government was to be such as would be adequate  
to the exigencies oj government and the preservation  
of the Union ; 3d, that these purposes were to be  
effected by alterations and provisions in the Ar­  
ticles ot Confederation, as it is expressed in the  
act of Congress, or by such further prothious as  
should appear necessary, as it stands in the recom­  
mendatory act from&#x27; Annapolis; 4th, that tho al­  
terations and provisions were to be reported to  
Congress, and to the States, in order to be agreed  
to by the former, and continued by the Utter.&quot;  
Frmn a comparison and fair construction of  
these several modes of expression, is to be deduced  
the authority under which the Convention acted.  
They were to frame a national gt wrnmenl, adequate-to  
the exigences of government, vMiiofthe Union, and  
to reduce the articles of Confederation into such form  
as to accomplish these purposes.  
There are two rules of construction dictated by  
reason, as well as founded on lega axioms. The  
one is, that every part of the expression ought, if  
possible, to be alleged some meaning, and be made  
to conspire to some common end. The other is,  
that when the several parts cannot bo made to coin­  
cide, the less important should give way to the more  
important part ; the means sh iuld be sacrificed to  
the end rather than the end to the &#x27;means.  
Suppose then that the expressions defining the  
authority-of the Convention were irreconcilably at  
variance with each other ; that a national and ade­  
quate government could not possibly, in the judg­  
ment of the Convention, be effected by alterations  
and provisions in the articles of Confederation ;  
wbicbart of the definition ought to have been em­  
braced, nd which rejected? -Which was the more  
important, which the less important part ? Which  
the end, which the means? Let the most scrupu­  
lous expositors of delegated powers ; let the inobt  
inveterate objectors&#x27; against those exercised by the  
Convention, answer these questions. Let them de­  
clare whether it wasf the most importance ta the  
happiness of the people of America, that the ti ticl s  
of Confederation should be disregarded, and an ade­  
quate government tie provided, and the. Union pre­  
served ; or that an: adequate government should be  
omitted, and the articles of Confederation preserved.  
Let them declare whether the preservation of these  
articles was the end, for securing which a reform of  
the government was to be introduced as the means;  
or whether the establishment of a government, ade­  
quate to the national happiness, was the end at  
which these articles themselves originally arrived,  
and to which they ought, as inaullicient means, to  
have beentsacrificed.  
But is it necessary to suppose that these ex­

that no alterations or provisions in the articles of  
Confederation, could psibif mould them into a  
national and adequate gjTemment; into such a  
government as h b?t-n proposed by the Conven­  
tion ?

** Had the Convention under all these impressions and in  
the midst of all these considerations, instead of exercising  
a manly coufidence in their country, by whose coufidence  
they had been so peculiarly distinguished, and of pointing  
out a system capable, in their judgment, of securing its  
happiness, taken the cold and sullen resolution of disap  
pointing its ardent hopes, of sacrificing substance to forms,  
of committing the dearest interests of their couutry to the  
hazard of events, let me ask the man who can raise his  
mind to one elevated conception, who can awaken in bis  
bosom one patriotic emotion, what judgment ought to have  
been pronounced by the impartial world, by the friends of  
mankind, by every virtuous citizen on the conduct and  
character of this assembly?) The sum of what has been  
advanced and proved is that the charge against the Conven-  
tion of exceeding their powers, except in one instanec,  
little urged by the objectors, has -no foundation to support  
it; thatil they had exceeded their powers they were not  
only warranted, but required, as the confidential servants  
of their country, by the circumstances in which they were

upon the States in their collective char­

mission by adding: &quot;As all of these lcommis­  
sionsl however, had reference either to the  
recommendation from the meeting at An­  
napolis in September, 1786, or to that from  
Congress in February, 1787, it will bo suffl­  
clent to recur to these particular acte,  
That does not seem quite sufficient. It  
might also be pertinent to ask whether,

divergences were deliberate or accidental.  
But let us listen to Madison. He points out

of devising such further provisions as shall an­  
pear to them necessary to render the Govern­  
ment existing under the Articles of Confedera­  
tion adequate to the cricencies of the Union,

ifications of the old Articles, whereas the Con­  
stitution proposes a materially different and

shall be hold for the sote and ecpress purpose of  
recising the Irticles of Confederation in such a  
way as to render the Federal Constitution ade­  
quate to the exigencies of grovernment and the  
preservation of the Union. Madison contends  
that &quot;from a comparison and fair construction  
of these several modes of expression,&quot; the  
Philadelphia Convention was authorized &quot; to  
frame a national Corernment adequate to the  
erigencies of porernment and of the Union,  
and to reduce the Articles of Confedera­  
tion into such form as to accom­  
plish these purposes.&quot; Now he is per­  
fectly alive, as he shows throughout his  
Federalist papers, to the essential distinction  
between &quot;national&quot; and &quot;Federal,&quot; and, of  
courso, the state of things prevailing under the  
then binding Articles exactly satisfled the  
definition of &quot;Federal.&quot; On that very ground  
Madison bases an ingenious argument that  
since the main purpose must be presumed to  
have been contemplated rather than the  
methods of attaining it, or that, in other  
words, the means must be sacrificed to  
the end, the authors of the recom­  
mendations named must have had in  
view a national rather than a Federal  
Government. Why? Becanse an &quot;adequate  
Government could not possibly, in the judg­  
ment of the Federal Convention, be effected by  
alterations and provisions in the Articles of  
Confederation. &quot;Let, then,&quot; is his conclusion,  
&quot;the most scrupulous expositors of delegated  
powers declare whether it was of most impor­  
tance to the happiness of the people of America  
that the Articles of Confederation should  
be disregarded, and an adequate Govern­  
ment be provided and the Union preserved,  
or that an adequate Government should  
be omitted and the Articles of Confedera­  
tion preserved. Let them declare whether  
the preservation of these Articles was the end,  
for securing which a reform of the Govern­  
ment was to be introduced as the means; or  
whother the establishment of a Government  
adequate to the national happiness was the  
end at which these Articles themselves orig-  
 a  a  
sufficient means, to have been sacrificed.

that, being frivolous, it had&quot;been in a manner  
waived by those who have criticised the powers  
of the Convention.&quot;  
In the final paragraphs of this paper, per­  
haps in its significance and influence the most  
remarkable single paper penned by Madison, he  
disposes of a criticism which undoubtedly was  
made with regard to the origin of the Constitu­  
tion, namely, that the twelve States represented  
at Philadelphia had usurped the power of send­  
ing deputies to a Federal Convention, a body  
utterly unknown to their then existing Consti­  
tution, and that Congress had also been guilty of  
usurpation in recommending the appointment  
of this body utterly unknown to the Confed­  
cration. Madison&#x27;s rejoinder is as follows:  
&quot;Granted for a moment that the IFederall  
Convention were neither authorized by their  
commission nor justifled by circumstances in  
proposing a Constitution for their country,  
does it follow that the Constitution ought for  
that reason to be rejected? The prudent in­  
quiry in all cases ought surely to be, not so  
much from whom the advice comes, as whether  
the advice be good.&quot;  
In the forty-first, forty-second, and several  
sueceeding essays Madison examines sertatim  
the functions conferred on the Fed eral Gov­  
ernment by the proposed Constitution, and en

‘* Truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed by the Con-  
vention, may be considered less, as absolutely new than as the expression of the  
principles which are found in the Articles of Confederation. The misfortune under  
the latter system has been that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify

Washington one of the delegates from that State to attend a proposed gen-

subsequently recommended by Congress in the foregoing resolution.  
Washington at first declined the appointment, but at the urgent solicitation

and commissioners from all the States were invited tu meet on  
the first Monday of September, 1786, at Annapolis.  
  
Bat five states responded, and the outlook did not seem en-  
eouraging. However, before adjourning, the assembly adopted  
an address urging that commissioners be appointed by all the  
states to meet in convention at Philadelphia in the following  
May, “ to devise such further provisious as shall appear to them

hesitation approved and adopted what was going on. Of the  
thirteen states, Rhode Island alone refused to take any part in

the constitutional convention of the United  
States. The New York delegates followed  
the instructions of their state legislature,  
and, by the aid of the Massachusetts dele-  
gates in the Congress, secured the passage  
of a proposition by the Congress recom-  
mending the assembly of the convention,  
which was, however, rather the Massachu-  
setts proposition than the one offered by the  
New Yorkers.  
  
The resolution of the Congress was passed  
on February 21, 1787, and was expressed in  
the following language:  
  
“That, in the opinion of Congress, it is expedient  
that, on the second Monday in May next, a conven-  
tion of delegates, who shall have been appointed by  
the several states, be held at Philadelphia, for the  
sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of  
Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the  
several legislatures such alterations and provisions  
therein as shall, when agreed to in Congress and con-  
firmed by the states, render the Federal Constitu-  
  
tion adequate to the exigencies of government and  
the preservation of the Union.”  
  
There are certainly some departures in  
this language from what has been employed  
before this in regard to this subject. In-  
stead of reading, “ when agreed to by Con-  
gress and afterwards confirmed by the legis-  
lature of every state,” it read, “confirmed by,  
the states’’; andinstead of reading, “render  
the Articles of Confederation,” it read, “ ren-  
der the Federal Constitution.” Still, I hardly  
think that these changes in the expression
