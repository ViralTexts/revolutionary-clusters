Monti cello, April .&gt;, 1825.  
Dear Sir: Your favor of March 25,  
has been duly received. The fact is  
unquestionable, that the Bill of Rights  
and the Constitution of Virginia were  
drawn originally by Georgf. Mason,  
one of our really great men, and of the  
first order of greatness. The history  
of the preamble to the latter is as fol­  
lows. I was then at Philadelphia with  
Congress, and knowing that the con­  
vention of Virginia was engaged in  
forming a plan of* government, I  
drew a sketch or outline of a Constitu­  
tion, with a preamble, which I sent to  
Mr. Pendleton, president of the con­  
vention, on the mere possibility that it  
might- suggest something worth in­  
corporation into that beiorc the con­  
vention. He informed me afterwards  
by letter, that he received it on the day  
on which the committee of the whole  
had reported to the House the plan they  
had agreed to; that that had been so  
long in hand, so disputed, inch by inch,  
and the subject of so much altercation  
and debate, that they were worried  
with the contentions it had produced;  
and could not, from mere lassitude,  
have been induced to open the instru­  
ment again: but that, being pleased  
with the preamble to mine, they adopt­  
ed it in the House, by way of amend­  
ment to the report of the Committee;  
and thus my preamble became tacked  
to the work of George Mason. The  
Constitution, with the preamble, was  
passed on the 29lh of June, and the  
Committee of Congress had, only the  
day before that, reported to that body  
the draught of the Declaration of In­  
dependence. The fact is, that that  
preamble was prior in composition to  
the Declaration; and both having the  
same object, of justifying our separa­  
tion from Great Britain, they used ne­  
cessarily the same materials of justifi­  
cation; and hence their similitude.  
W ithdrawn by age from all other  
public services and attentions to public  
things, I am closing the last scenes of  
life by fostering and fashioning an es­  
tablishment for the instruction of those  
who are t&lt;5 come after us. 1 hope its  
influence on their virtue, freedom, fame  
and happiness, will be salutary and  
permanent. The form and distribu­  
tions of its structure arc original and  
unique, the architecture chaste and  
classical, and the whole well w orthy of  
attracting the curiosity of a visit.—  
Should it so prove to yourself at any  
time, it will be a great gratification to  
me to see you once more at Monticello;  
and I pray you to be assured of my  
continued and high respect and esteem.

I was then st Philadelphia with Congress, and

“The fact is unquestionable, that the Ti H of Right*  
ami the Constitution of Virginia, were drawn oiiginatly  
hy George Ma-on, one ol our renliy groat men, and of  
trio tirft order of greatne**. Thf history of ih» pr*«mn*  
to till* latter !• a* follow: —l w.n then at I’tiiUM­  
pbia^wi&#x27;h Congress, and knowing that (lie Convention  
of \ irgtnia was engaged in forming a plan ol govern­  
ment, I turned my mind to the same subject and drew  
a ‘ketch or outline of a Constitution wi&#x27;h a preamble,  
whirh I sent to Mr. Pendleton, President of the Con­  
vention, on the mere possitiility that it might suggest  
something worth incorporation into that before the Con­  
vention. He informed me afterwards, by letter, that  
lie received it oil the day on which the committee of  
the whole had reported to the House the plan they had  
agreed to; that that had been so long in li ind, so disput­  
ed inch by inch, and the suited of so much aberration  
and debate, that they were worried with tlio contentions  
it had produced, and could not, from in-*re lissi tide,  
have been induced to open the instrument again: but  
that being pleased with the preamble to mine, they a­  
dopted it in the House by w.iy of amendment to the re­  
port or the committee; and thus my preamble became  
tacked to the work of (leorge Mason. The Constitution  
with the preamble, was passed on the 29tl» ol June, and  
the committee of Congress tiad only (he day heiore that  
reported to that body the draft of the Declaration of In­  
dependence. 1 he fact is, that that preamble i* prior in  
composition to the declaration, and both having the same  
object of justifying our separation witli Great Britain,  
they used necessarily the same materials of jus&#x27;ifica­  
tion; and hence their similitude.
