[Enclosure]  
  
Report of the Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia,determined on at their meeting in October 1826  
To the President and Directors of the Literary fund.  
In obedience to the law requiring that the Rector &amp; Visitors of the University of Virginia, should make a Report annually, to the President &amp; Directors of the Literary fund, (to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding meeting) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, &amp; a general Statement of the condition of the said University, the said Rector &amp; Visitors make the following  
Report:  
The first act required of the Board at their present meeting, was that of providing for the vacancy in the Rectorship, occasioned by a loss which clothed the whole land in mourning, &amp; has fallen with peculiar force on the institution committed to their care. To that lamented event the Board cannot refer, without feeling that some tribute is due on their part, to the memory of a patriot &amp; sage so distinguished by his various &amp; invaluable Services to his country; and so eminently entitled to manifestations of grateful affection from every portion of its citizens. After discharging with a zeal which never abated, and with abilities which commanded universal admiration, all the labours imposed by a series of most important public trusts, he did not cease in his retirement from them, to cherish that love of country and of liberty, which had been the ruling principle of his life. Reflecting more particularly on the great truth, that as no people can be happy but with a free Government, so no government can long be free, without knowledge for its conservative element, he determined to close his illustrious career by devoting the resources of his genius and his vast acquirements, to the erection of this monument of Science &amp; Liberty: indulging to the last hour of his protracted existence, the gratifying confidence that under the auspices of the state to which it was dedicated, it would more than repay whatever might be done for it, by the lights it would diffuse, and the characters it would rear for the service &amp; ornament of the Republic.  
With an origin so propitious, and the continued patronage of the state, the Board are encouraged to expect that no part of the promised blessings will be disappointed, in the progress of the University to its destined usefulness.  
Since the Report last made, the acquisition of a Professor of Law has completed the number required for the existing arrangement, and the matriculated students have encreased to 177: the state of the schools being,

This encrease justifies the expectation that additions to the number will continue to be made, as the benefits of the institution shall be unfolded, and regulations for extending and ensuring them shall be suggested by experience. The enactments now made with this view, will be laid before the Legislature as soon as they shall be duly prepared for the purpose.  
From a comparative view of the tasks of the Professors of Law &amp; Moral Philosophy, it was found convenient &amp; mutually agreeable to the parties that the science of Political Economy should be taught in the school of the latter, instead of the former.  
On a further consideration of the most eligible period for the session of the University, it has been provided that the next session shall commence on the first of February, and terminate on the Fourth of July, and that all future sessions shall commence on the twentieth of August in each year, and terminate on the fourth of July ensuing; but that there shall be one recess of all the schools, &amp; no more, during each session: to commence on the fifteenth and terminate on the thirty first of December.  
In pursuance of what was communicated in the last report, the Library room in the Rotunda has been nearly completed, and the books put into it. Two rooms for the professors of Natural Philosophy and of Chemistry, and one large lecture room, have also been fitted for use. The work of the Anatomical Hall is so far advanced that it may be used early in the next session. The Portico of the Rotunda has been finished, with the exception of the flight of steps and the laying of the marble flags, which have been received and paid for. The work remaining to be done, is the finishing one large oval room, one small one, and the entrance Hall of the Rotunda with the unfinished parts of the Portico and about one fourth of the anatomical Hall. Some small additions are also necessary for the better accommodation of the Professors in their Pavilions, and of the students in their Dormitories, and for a few other minor objects.  
The receipts by the collector, of arrearages of subscriptions since the date of the last report, amount to $644.84 cents, leaving a balance still due of 8161.68 of which 3661.68 are considered sperate.  
The accounts for the receipts, disbursements &amp; funds on hand for the  
  
year ending with the month of September, as rendered by the Bursar &amp; Proctor are given with this report as is required by Law.  
In looking to the future, the Board, notwithstanding their anxiety to bring the establishment into a complete state, without exceeding its current resources, find, on comparing with these, the engagements and estimated demands for the present &amp; the next year, that at the end of the next, an adverse balance will exist of not less than twenty thousand dollars; the extinguishment of which will require the estimated annual surplus of income, thereafter, for a period of about seven years.  
In submitting this unavoidable result, the Board venture to hope that a favorable view will be taken by the General Assembly, of the advantage to the Institution from a public liberation of its funds from the debts otherwise weighing upon them; and of the prospect thence opened of earlier enlargements of its scope of action and usefulness

The first act required from the Hoard at thfcir

cancy in the Rectorship, occasioned by a loss which  
clothed the whole land in mourning; and which lias  
fallen with peculiar force on the Institution cam­  
muted to their care. To that lamented event the  
Board cannot refer, without feeling that some tri­  
bute is due on their part, to the memory of a pa­  
triot and sage, ho distinguished by his various and  
invaluable services to his country; and so eminent­  
ly entitled to manifestations of grateful affection  
fiom every portion of its citizens. After discharg­  
ing with a zeal which never abated, and with abil­  
ties which commanded universal admiration, all  
the labours imposed by a series of most important  
public trusts, lie did not cease in his retirement  
Irom them, to cherish that love of country and of  
liberty, which had been the ruling principle of hi*  
life. Reflecting more particulaily on the great  
truth, that as no people can be happy, but with  
a free Government, so no government cap. long be  
lree, without knowledge for its conservative ele­  
ment, he determined to close his illustrious carter  
by devoting the resources of his genius, and his  
vast acquirements to the erection of this monument  
to Science and liberty; indulging to the last hour  
of his protracted existence, the gratifying confi­  
dence, that under the auspices of the State, to  
which it was dedicated, it would more than repay  
whatever might be done for it, by the lights it  
would diffuse, and the characters it would rear (br  
the &gt;-ervice and the ornament of the Republic.  
With an origin «-o propitious, and the continued  
patronage of the Stale, the Board are encouraged  
to expect that no part of the promised blessings  
will be disappointed, in the progress of the Uni­  
versity to its destined usefulness.  
  
^ mure the Keport last made, the acquisition of a  
Professor of Law has completed the number re­

To the Pres d nt a it D r,,ctor$ of the  
L ter ary Fund.  
la obedience t&gt; tne &#x27;aw ivquit ing that  
the •t’jSc/or and Vi•»i10r3 oi the Universi­  
ty ot Virginia, should make a report an  
uuallv, to the President and Directors  
of tha Literary Fund, (to be laid beloro  
the Legislature at their next succeeding  
meeting.) embracing a full account ot  
the disbu&#x27;sement&#x27;1, the funds on band,  
awl a general statement of the condition  
of* the said University, the said Rector  
and Visiters mike the following d-eport­  
The first act required from the Hoard  
at their present meeting, was that of  
providing for tha vacancy of the Rector­  
ihip, iccasioned by a loss which clothed  
the whole land in mourning; and wbieh  
has fallen with peculiar force on the ln­  
atitu&#x27;ion committed to their care. To  
that lamented ev-a! the Board cannot  
refer, without feeling that some tribute  
is due, on their part, to the memory of a  
Satriot and a sare, so distinguished by  
is various and invaluable services to  
his country; and so eminently entitled  
to manifestations of grateful atlection  
from every portion of its citizens. Af­  
ter discharging witn Zeal which never  
aoaled, and with abilities which cum­  
minded universal admiration, all the  
labors imposed by a series of most im  
p »rtant public trusts, ire did not cease,  
in bis retirement from them, to cherish  
that love of country and of liberty winch  
had been the ruling principle of his life  
Reflecting more particularly on the  
great truth, that as no people Cnn be  
bappv without a free government, so no  
government cati long be free without  
k mwledge for its conservative, element,  
b- determined to close his illustrious  
career be ri sv-i&#x27;ing the resources ol his  
g nious and vquiremen&#x27;S to the erpe­  
&#x27; tion of this mono merit to science end  
liberty, indulging in the Inst hour of his  
protracted existence, the gratifying con­  
fide ice. that, under the auspices of the  
I at»te, to which it was dedicated, it  
I would more than repay whatever might  
H be done for it, by the lights it would dif  
| fuse, and the characters it would rear  
i for the service aed ornaments of the re­  
  
pubuc.  
With an origin to propitmns, end the  
continued patronage ol tbo state, the  
Board are -encouraged to expect thnf no  
part of the promisrd bleating** will he  
disappointed, in the progress of the  
University to its destined usefulness  
&quot;ince the Report last made, the »c­  
q l&#x27;-sition of a Professor of Law has com­  
pleted the numb*!- required for the ex  
isring arrangement, and the matriculated  
students have been increased to 177; the  
•state of ihe school being—In the School  
(of Ancient Languages, 107; Modern

tural Philosophy, 43, Natural History,  
45; Anatomy and Medicine, 16; Moral  
Phi ntmphy, 28; Law, (opened in July,)  
twenty six  
This increase justifies the expectation,  
that additions to the number will con­  
tinue to be made, as the benefit of the  
institution shall he unfolded, and regula­  
tions for extending aud ensuring them  
shall be suggested bv experience. 1&#x27;he  
enactments bow made with this view,  
will be laid before the legislatui e as soon  
as they shall be duly prepared for the  
purpose.  
From a comparative view of the tasks  
of the Professors of Law and Mora  
Philosophy, it w **■ found convenient and  
mutually agreeable to th« parties, tha&#x27;  
the science of Political Lconoray shook  
be taught in the school of the Utter, in  
stead of the former.  
tin a further consideration of the mos  
eligible periodfor the session of the Uni­  
versity, it has been provided that th&lt;  
next session shall commence on the firs  
ol 1- ebi naiy, ami tci nonate on the fourtl  
ol July. ami that all future sessions sha!  
commence on the twentieth of Angus  
in each year, and terminate on th*  
fourth of July ensuing: but that tiler  
shall he one recess of all the school*  
and no more during each session, P  
commence on the fifteenth, and teimi  
na*e on thp thirty-first of December.  
In pursuance of what was eommuui  
rated in (lie last report, the library roor  
in the Rotunda has been ueaily com  
plcfr-d, and the books put into it. Tw  
rooms for the Professors of Natural Phi  
lo*opny, and of Uhemisijj., and ©n  
V  
i  
  
large lecture room, have also been  
fitted for use. The work &gt;1 the Anato­  
mical IIall i- so far advanced that it may  
be used earlv in the near »e«*ci &gt;n The  
portico of the Rotunda lias neen finished,  
with the exception ol t»e flight of steps  
and the laying ol the marbie flags, which  
have been received and paid tor. I&#x27;tie  
work remaining to b** d me,is the finish­  
ing one other l arge ovsl mom, one small  
one, and the entram e nail of ttte Rotun­  
da, with the Unfinished parts of thft por  
tico, and about one fourth of the Ana­  
tomical Kail. Some small additions arc  
also necessary for the hotter acconamo !  
dation of lb» professors in their pavilions,  
and rtf the students in their d ormitories, I  
and for a few other minor objects.  
The receipts by the collector of hr |  
rearages of subscriptions since &lt;h» dn*e  
of the. last report, amount to $644 HI  
i cents, leiv:; g x balance still due of 101  
dollars 64 cents, of which $3661 66 are  
considered separate.  
The account* for th» receipt*, dis­  
bursements, and funds on hand, for the  
ye tr ending with the month of Septem  
her. as rendeted by the B,ir*\r and Free  
tor are given with this report as i* re  
quitad by the law.  
In looixhig to the future, the Hoard,  
notwithstanding tjeir anvety to bring  
! the establishment into a complete stale,  
| without exceeding it* current resources,  
! find, on comparing with these, the en  
j gag wnents and estimated demand* for  
the present and rt. xt yflgr, th»t at the  
end of the next an adverse balance w.il  
exist of not less than twenty thousand  
dollars; the extinguishment of which  
will require tne estimated annual sur-1  
plus of income thereafter for a period  
of about seven years.  
In submiiting thi* unavoidable result,  
j the Hoard ventures to hope tbs- e favor­  
j able vi«w will be taken by the f»ea ral  
j Assembly of the advantage (o the Inati*  
! tution, from a public hberati»fc of its  
I funds from the debts otherwise weighing  
! upon them; and of the prospect there*
