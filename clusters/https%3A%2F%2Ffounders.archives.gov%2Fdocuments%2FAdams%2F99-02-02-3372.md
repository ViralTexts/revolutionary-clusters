BY THE PRESIDENT Of the United States of America.A Proclamation.  
6 March 1799  
  
As no truth is more clearly taught in the volume of inspiration, nor any more fully demonstrated by the experience of all ages, than that a deep sense and a due acknowledgment of the governing providence of a Supreme Being and of the accountableness of men to Him as the searcher of hearts and righteous distributor of rewards and punishments, are conducive, equally, to the happiness and rectitude of individuals and to the well being of communities; as it is, also, most reasonable in itself, that men who are made capable of social acts and relations, who owe their improvements to the social state, and who derive their enjoyments from it, should, as a society, make their acknowledgments of dependance and obligation to Him who hath endued them with these capacities, and elevated them in the scale of existence, by these distinctions; as it is, likewise, a plain dictate of duty, and a strong sentiment of nature, that in circumstances of great urgency and seasons of imminent danger, earnest and particular supplications should be made to Him who is able to defend or to destroy; as, moreover, the most precious interests of the people of the United States are still held in jeopardy, by the hostile designs and insidious arts of a foreign nation, as well as by the dissemination among them of those principles subversive of the foundations of all religious, moral and social obligations, that have produced incalculable mischief and misery in other countries; and as, in fine, the observance of special seasons for public religious solemnities, is happily calculated to avert the evils which we ought to deprecate, and to excite to the performance of the duties which we ought to discharge,—by calling and fixing the attention of the people at large to the momentous truths already recited, by affording opportunity to teach and inculcate them, by animating devotion and giving to it the character of a national act:—For these reasons, I have thought proper to recommend, and I do hereby recommend accordingly, that Thursday, the 25th day of April next, be observed, throughout the United States of America, as a day of solemn humiliation, fasting and prayer—That the citizens, on that day, abstaining as far as may be from their secular occupations, devote the time to the sacred duties of religion, in public and in private: That they call to mind our numerous offences against the most High GOD, confess them before him with the sincerest penitence, implore his pardoning mercy, through the great Mediator and Redeemer, for our past transgressions, and that, through the grace of his Holy Spirit, we may be disposed and enabled to yield a more suitable obedience to his righteous requisitions in time to come: That he would interpose to arrest the progress of that impiety and licentiousness in principle and practice, so offensive to himself and so ruinous to mankind: That he would make us deeply sensible that “righteousness exalteth a nation, but that sin is the reproach of any people”: That he would turn us from our transgressions and turn his displeasure from us: That he would withhold us from unreasonable discontent,—from disunion, faction, sedition and insurrection: That he would preserve our country from the desolating sword: That he would save our cities and towns from a repetition of those awful pestilential visitations under which they have lately suffered so severely, and that the health of our inhabitants, generally, may be precious in his sight: That he would favour us with fruitful seasons, and so bless the labors of the husbandman as that there may be food in abundance for man and beast: That he would prosper our commerce, manufactures, and fisheries and give success to the people in all their lawful industry and enterprize: That he would smile on our colleges, academies, schools and seminaries of learning, and make them nurseries of sound science, morals and religion: That he would bless all magistrates from the highest to the lowest, give them the true spirit of their station, make them a terror to evil doers and a praise to them that do well: That he would preside over the councils of the nation at this critical period, enlighten them to a just discernment of the public interest, and save them from mistake, division and discord: That he would succeed our preparations for defence, and bless our armaments by land and by sea: That he would put an end to the effusion of human blood, and the accumulation of human misery, among the contending nations of the earth, by disposing them to justice, to equity, to benevolence and to peace: And that he would extend the blessings of knowledge, of true liberty, and of pure and undefiled religion, throughout the world.  
And I do, also, recommend that with these acts of humiliation, penitence and prayer, fervent thanksgiving to the author of all good be united, for the countless favors which he is still continuing to the people of the United States, and which render their condition as a nation eminently happy, when compared with the lot of others.  
Given under my hand and the seal of the United States of America, at the city of Philadelphia, this sixth day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine and of the Independence of the said States the twenty-third.  
  
John Adams.By the President,Timothy Pickering,Secretary of State

AS no truth is more clearly taught  
in the volume ct inlpiratica, nor any more  
demonflratcd by the experience of all  
ages, than that a dsep sense and a due ac­  
knowledgment cf the, governing providence  
of a Supreme Bsift,? and 6f the   
blenels of n • 11 to Han as the searcher of  
hearts and righteous diflributor of rewards  
and punifnments, are&#x27;conducive, equally, to  
the happinef: and rectitude of individuals  
and to the well bei 113- of communities ; as it  
is, also, most reaConablc in itlelf, that men  
who are made capable of fecial,acts and rela­  
tions, who owe their improvements to the  
social state, and who derive their enjoyments  
from it, ihould, as a focietv, make their ac­  
knowledgments of dependence and obligation  
to Him who hath endued them with &#x27;.hele  
elevated them in the scale of  
exigence by these diftmcYiohs ; as it is,  
like wife, a di&amp;ate of duty, and a strong&#x27;  
fentiment&#x27;atnature, .that in tircuniftar.ces cf  
great urgencj and seasons of imminent clan­  
ger, fearsieft and particular fuppllcations  
should lie made to Him who is able to defend  
or to deftrov; as, moreover, the most pre­  
cious interefb of the people of ti.; United  
Spates are Kill held in jeopardy, by the hos­  
tile designs and inlidtcas arts of a foreign  
nation, as well as by the difTeinination among  
them of those principles ftibverfrve of the  
foundations of all religious, frtor.il and fo­  
cinl obligations, -that have produced incalcu­  
lable mifchief and rr&lt;»ier.y in other countries ;  
and as, in fine, the obfervnnce cf special  
seasons for public religious folemnitk s, is  
happily calculated to avert the evils which  
we ought to deprecate, and to excite to the  
performance of the duties which we ought  
to &lt;3ifcharge,—by calling and.fixing the at­  
tention of the people at large to the mo­  
mentous truths already recited, by affording  
opportunity to teach and inculcate them, by  
animating devotion and giving to itthecha­  
rafter of ?. national ad :. For these reasons,  
I haw thought proper to recommend, and  
I &lt;to hereby recommend accordingly, that  
Thursday, the 25th day of April next, be  
observed, throughout the United States of  
America, as a day of solemn humiliation,  
fa ft ing and prayer—That the citirens, on  
that day, abfiaining as far as may be from  
their secular occupations, devote the time to  
the facrcd duties of religion, in public and in  
private : That they call to mind our nu­  
merous offences again ft the most High GOD,  
coufefs them before him with the Gncereft  
penitence, implore his pardoning mercy,  
through the great Mediator and Redeemer,  
for our past transgressions, and that, through i  
the grace of his Holy Spirit, we may bedif­  
pofed and enabled to yield a more suitable  
obedience to his righteous requisitions in  
time to come: That he would interpose  
to arrest the progress of that impiety and  
licentiousness in principle and pradice,  
so offenfive to himfelf and so ruinous to man­  
kind : That -he would malfe us deeply .sensi­  
ble that &quot; righteousness exalteth a nation but  
that fin is the reproach of any people&quot;:  
1 hat he would, turn us from our transgres­  
sions and turn his displeasure from us : That  
he would withhold us from unreasonable dif­  
contenl,—from disunion, faction, sedition  
and infurreftion : That he would preserve  
our country from the desolating fvvord :  
That he wo»ld favc our cities and towns  
: from a repetition of those awful peflilential  
visitations under which they have lately fuf­  
fered so severely, and that the health of our  
inhabitants, generally, may be precious in  
his fight : That he- would &quot;favor us with  
fruitful seasons, and so bless the labors of the  
husbandman as that there may be food in abun­  
dance for man ahdbeaft: That h&quot;c would pros­  
per our commerce, manufactures, Jtndfifheriei  
and g&#x27;ive success to the people in all their law­  
ful industry and enterprise-: That he would  
smile on our colleges, academies, fchoolsand  
feminariesof learning, and make them nur­  
series of found science, morals and religion.:  
That he would bless all magistrates, from  
the highest to the lowest, give them the true  
f&#x27;pirit of their station, make them a terror to  
evil doers and a praise to them that do well :  
That he would preside over the councils of  
the nation at this critical period, enlighten  
them to a just discernment cf the public in­  
terest, and lave them from mistake, divilion,  
and discord : That he would succeed our  
preparations for defence, and bless our arma­  
ments by land and by lea : That he would  
put an end to the effufion of human blood,  
and the accumulation of human milery, ;  
among the Contending nations of the earth, i  
by disposing tliem to justice, to equity, to :  
benevolence and to peace : And that he  
would extend the blcffings of of ;  
true liberty, and of pure and undefiled reli­  
gion, throughout the world.  
And I do, alio, recommend that with !  
these afts of humiliation, penitence and ;  
prayer, fervent thanksgiving to the author of j  
all good be united, for the countless favors j  
which he is still continuing to the people of  
the United States, and which render their  
condition as a nation eminently happy, when  
compared with the lot of others.

Q Sno truth is more clearly

a plain dictate of duty and a strong

BY THE PRESIDENT  
Of the Ukirsv Slaves of A tier ic &#x27;s,  
  
&#x27;% proclamation.  
  
AS no truth is more clearly taught in  
the volume of inspiration, nor any more ful­  
ly demonstrated by the experience of all  
ages, than that a deep sense and a due ac­  
knowledgment of the governing providence  
of a Supreme b ing and of the accountable­  
refs ofmcn to Him a? the searcher of hearts  
ana righteous distributor of rewards and pu­  
nifhmerils, are conducive,, equally, to the  
happiiufs and redtitude of individuals and to  
the well being of communities ; as it is, al­  
so, molt reafor.able in itfelf, that men who  
are made capable of social aflsand relations,  
who owe their improvements to the social  
state, and who derive their enjoyments from  
it, (hould, as a focicty, make their acknow­  
ledgments of dependance and obligation to  
Him who bath endued them with these ca­  
pacities, and elevated them in the scale of  
existence, by these diftinftions; as i&#x27;t is, like­  
wise, a plain diftateof duty, and a strong sen­  
timent of nature, that in circumltances of  
great urgency and seasons of imminent dan­  
ger, earnest and particular supplications  
should, be made to Him who is able to defend  
or to deltroy ) as, moreover, the mod pre­  
cious interests of the people ef the United  
States are ft ill held in jeopardy, by the ho­  
ftiledefigrs and insidious aits of a foreign  
nation, as well as by the domination among  
them of those principles subversive of the  
foundations of all religious, moral and so­  
cial obligstiors, that have produced incalcul­  
able mifcfiicf and misery in other countries;  
and as, in fine, the observance of special sea­  
sons for public religions solemnities, is hap­  
pily calculated to avert the evils which we  
ought to deprecate, and to etfeite to the  
performance of the duties which we ought  
to discharge,—by calling and fixing the at­  
tention of the people at large to the momen­  
tOHS truths already recited, by affording op­  
portunity to teich and inculcate them, by  
animating devotion and giving to it the cha­  
rafter 6f a national aft :—For these reasons  
I have thought proper to recommend, and I  
do hereby recommend accordingly, &quot;that  
Thursday, the 25th day of April next, be  
observed, throughout the United States of  
America, as a day of solemn humiliation,  
fading and prayer—That citizens, on that  
tlay, abltaining as far as may be from their  
secular occupations, devote the time to the  
sacred duties of religion, in public and in  
private.. That they call to miwd our nume­  
rous offen es against the most High GOD,  
csufefs them before him with the fincereft  
penitence, implore his pardoning mercy,  
through the great Mediator and Redeemer,  
for our pad tranfgreffiooß, and that, thro&#x27;  
the grace of his Holy. Spirit, we may be  
disposed and enabled to yield a more suitable  
obedience to his, righteous requifuion* in  
time to come : That he would interpose to  
arrest the progref? of that impiety and licen­  
tioufnef? in principle and praftice, so offen­  
five to himfelf and so ruinous to mankind :  
That he would make us deeply sensible that  
&quot; righteousness exalteth a nation, but that  
fin is the reproach of any people That  
he would turn us from our tranfgreflions  
and turn his displeasure from us: That he  
would withhold us from unreasonable dif­  
content—from disunion, faftion, sedition  
and infurreftion :That he would preserve  
our country from the desolating sword:  
That he would save our cities and towns  
from-a repetition of those awful pestilential  
visitations under which they have lately fuf­  
fered so fsverely, and that the health of our  
inhabitants generally, may be precious in  
his fight : That he would favor us with  
fruitful seasons, and so bless the labors of the  
husbandman as that there may be food in  
abundance for man and bead : That he  
would prosper our commerce, manufactures  
and fifheries, and give success to the people  
in all their lawful indullry and enterprize :  
That he would-fmile on our colleges, acade­  
mies, schools and seminaries of learning, and  
make them nurseries of found fciencc, mo­  
rals and religion : That he would bless all  
magistrates from the highest to the lowest,  
give them the true, spirit of their (tation,  
make them a terror to evil doers and a praise  
to them that do well : That he would pre­  
side over the councils of the nation at this  
critical period, enlighten them to ajull dis­  
cernment of the public interest, and save  
them from mistake, division and discord :  
That he would succeed our preparations for  
defence, and bless our armaments by land  
and by sea : That he would put an end to  
the effufion of human blood, and the accu­  
mulation of human misery, among &quot;the con­  
tending nations of the earth, by disposing  
them to justice, to equity, to benevolence  
and to peace: And that he would extend  
the bleflings of knowledge, o? true liberty,  
and of pure and undefiled religion, through­  
out the world.  
  
And I do, also, iccommend that with  
these a£ls of hirmfliation, penitence and  
prayer, fervent thankfgiWng to the author,  
of all good be united, for the countless fa­  
vors which fie still continuing to the peo­  
ple of the United States, and which render  
their condition as a nation eminently happy,  
when compared with the lot of others.  
Given under my hand and the seal  
cf the United States ef America,  
  
at the city of Philadelphia, this  
  
sixth day of March in the year  
(L. S.) of our Lord one thou land seven
