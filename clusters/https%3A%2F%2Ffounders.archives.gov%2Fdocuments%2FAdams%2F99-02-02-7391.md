 head. these views are so obvious that I am sure they would have required but a second thought to reconcile the reviewer to their location under the head of Pure Mathematics. for this word location, see Bailey Johnson, Sheridan, Walker Etc. but if Dictionaries are to be the Arbitors of language, in which of them shall we find neologism? no matter. it is a good word, well sounding, obvious, and expresses an idea which would otherwise require circumlocution. the Reviewer was justifiable therefore in using it; altho’ he noted at the same time, as unauthoritative, centrality, grade, sparse; all which have been long used in common speech and writing. I am a friend to neology. it is the only way to give to a language copiousness &amp; euphony. without it we should be still held to the vocabulary of Alfred or of Ulphilas; and held to their state of science also: for I am sure they had no words which could have conveyed the ideas of Oxigen, cotyledons, zoophytes, magnetism, electricity, hyaline, and thousands of others expressing ideas not then existing, nor of possible communication in the state of their language. What a language has the French become since the date of their revolution, by the free introduction of new words! the most copious and eloquent in the living world; and equal to the Greek, had not that been regularly modifiable almost ad infinitum. their rule was that whenever their language furnished or adopted a root, all it’s branches, in every part of speech, were legitimated by giving them their appropriate terminations. αδελφος, αδελφη, αδελφιδιον, αδελφοτης, αδελφιξις, αδελφιδους, αδελφικος, αδελφιζω, αδελφικως. and this should be the law of every language. thus, having adopted the adjective fraternal, it is a root, which should legitimate fraternity, fraternation, fraternisation, fraternism, to fraternate, fraternise, fraternally. and give the word neologism to our language, as a root, and it should give us it’s fellow-substantives, neology, neologist, neologisation; it’s adjectives neologous, neological, neologistical, it’s verb neologise, &amp; adverb neologically. Dictionaries are but the depositories of words already legitimated by usage. society is the work-shop in which new ones are elaborated. when an individual uses a new word, if illformed it is rejected in society, if well-formed, adopted, and, after due time, laid up in the depository of dictionaries. and if, in this process of sound neologisation, our transatlantic brethren shall not chuse to accompany us, we may furnish, after the Ionians, a second example of a colonial dialect improving on it’s primitive.—but enough of criticism: let me turn to your puzzling letter of May 12. on matter, spirit, motion Etc. it’s croud of scepticisms kept me from sleep. I read it, &amp; laid it down: read it, and laid it down, again, and again: and to give rest to my mind, I was obliged to recur ultimately to my habitual anodyne, “I feel: therefore I exist.” I feel bodies which are not myself: there are other existencies then. I call them matter. I feel them changing place. this gives me motion. where there is an absence of matter, I call it void, or nothing, or immaterial space. on the basis of sensation, of matter and motion, we may erect the fabric of all the certainties we can have or need. I can concieve thought to be an action of a particular organisation of matter, formed for that purpose by it’s creator, as well as that attraction is an action of matter, or magnetism of loadstone. when he who denies to the Creator the power of endowing matter with the mode of action called thinking shall shew how he could endow the Sun with the mode of action called attraction, which reins the planets in the tract of their orbits, or how an absence of matter can have a will, and, by that will; put matter into motion, then the materialist may be lawfully required to explain the process by which matter exercises the faculty of thinking. when once we quit the basis of sensation “all is in the wind.” to talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. to say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial, is to say they are nothings, or that there is no god, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise: but I believe I am supported in my creed of materialism by Locke, Tracy, &amp; Stewart. at what age of the Christian church this heresy of immaterialism  this masked atheism, crept in, I do not know. but a heresy it certainly is. Jesus taught nothing of it. he told us indeed that “God is a spirit,” but he has not defined what a spirit is, nor said that it is not matter. and the antient fathers generally, if not universally, held it to be matter: light and thin indeed, an etheriel gas; but still matter.

Rejecting all organs of information therefore but my senses, I rid myself of the Pyrrhonisms with which an indulgence in speculations hyperphysical and antiphysical so uselessly occupy and disquiet the mind. a single sense may indeed be sometimes decieved, but rarely; and never all our senses together, with their faculty of reasoning. they evidence realities; and there are enough of these for all the purposes of life, without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams &amp; phantasms. I am satisfied, and sufficiently occupied with the things which are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may indeed be, but of which I have no evidence.

himself: ‘These views are so obvious, that I am sure they would  
have required but a second thought to reconcile the reviewer to  
their /ocation under the head of pure mathematics. For this word  
location, see Bailey, Johnson, Sheridan, Walker, &amp;c. But, if  
dictionaries are to be the arbiters of language, in which of them  
shall we find neologism? No matter. It is a good word, well  
sounding and obvious, and expresses an idea which would other-  
wise require circumlocution. The reviewer was justified, therefore,  
in using it, although he noted at the same time as unauthoritative,  
centrality, grade, sparse ; all of which have long been used in com-  
mon speech and writing. I ama friend to xeology. It is the only  
way to give a language copiousness and euphony. Without it we  
should still be held to the vocabulary of Alfred or of Ulphilas ; and  
to their state of science also: for 1 am sure they had no words  
which could have conveyed the ideas of oxygen, cotyledons, zoo-  
phytes, magnetism, electricity, hyaline, and thousands of others  
expressing ideas then not existing, nor of possible communication  
in the state of their language. What a language has the French  
become since the Revolution, by the free introduction of new  
words! The most copious and eloquent in the living world, and  
equal to the Greek, had not that been regularly modifiable almost  
ad infinitum. Their rule was that whenever their language  
furnished or adopted 4 root, all its branches in every part of speech  
  
  
  
NOTES. 213  
  
were legitimated by giving them their appropriate terminations. . .  
.... And this should be the law of every language. Thus  
having adopted the adjective fraternal, it is a root which should  
legitimate fraternity, fraternation, fraternisation, fraternism, to  
fraternate, fraternise, fraternally. And give the word neologism  
to our language as a root, and it should give us its fellow substan-  
tives, neology, neologist, neologisation; its adjectives, neologous,  
neological, neologistical,; its verb neologize; and adverb, neologic-  
ally. Dictionaries are but the depositories of words already legiti-  
mated by usage. Society is the workshop in which new ones are  
elaborated. When an individual uses a new word, if ill formed, it  
is rejected in society; if well formed, adopted, and after due time,  
laid up in the depository of dictionaries. And if, in this process  
of sound neologisation, our trans-Atlantic brethren shall not choose  
to accompany us, we may furnish, after the Ionians, a second ex-

himself: ‘These views are so obvious, that I am sure they would  
have required but a second thought to reconcile the reviewer to  
their /ocation under the head of pure mathematics. For this word  
location, see Bailey, Johnson, Sheridan, Walker, &amp;c. But, if  
dictionaries are to be the arbiters of language, in which of them  
shall we find neologism? No matter. It is a good word, well  
sounding and obvious, and expresses an idea which would other-  
wise require circumlocution. The reviewer was justified, therefore,  
in using it, although he noted at the same time as unauthoritative,  
centrality, grade, sparse; all of which have long been used in com-  
mon speech and writing. Iam a friend to xeology. It is the only  
way to give a language copiousness and euphony. Without it we  
should still be held to the vocabulary of Alfred or of Ulphilas ; and  
to their state of science also: for 1 am sure they had no words  
which could have conveyed the ideas of oxygen, cotyledons, zoo-  
phytes, magnetism, electricity, hyaline, and thousands of others  
expressing ideas then not existing, nor of possible communication  
in the state of their language. What a language has the French  
become since the Revolution, by the free introduction of new  
words! The most copious and eloquent in the living world, and  
equal to the Greek, had not that been regularly modifiable almost  
ad infinitum. Their rule was that whenever their language  
furnished or adopted a root, all its branches in every part of speech

were legitimated by giving them their appropriate terminations. . .  
  
And this should be the law of every language. Thus  
having adopted the adjective fraternal, it is a root which should  
legitimate fraternity, fraternation, fraternisation, fraternism, to  
Sraternate, fraternise, fraternally. And give the word neologism  
to our language as a root, and it should give us its fellow substan-  
tives, neology, neologist, neologisation,; its adjectives, neologous,  
neological, neologistical; its verb neologize; and adverb, neologic-  
ally. Dictionaries are but the depositories of words already legiti-  
mated by usage. Society is the workshop in which new ones are  
elaborated. When an individual uses a new word, if ill formed, it  
is rejected in society; if well formed, adopted, and after due time,  
laid up in the depository of dictionaries. And if, in this process  
of sound neologisation, our trans-Atlantic brethren shall not choose  
to accompany us, we may furnish, after the Ionians, a second ex-  
ample of a colonial dialect improving on its primitive.” By refer
