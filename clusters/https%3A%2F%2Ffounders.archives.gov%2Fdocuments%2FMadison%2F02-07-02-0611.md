The Captain of His Majesty’s Ship Leander having been informed of the Circumstances above related, has requested of me to make Application to the Government of the United States for the n[e]cessary Orders to be issued for the Ship Eugenia to be restored to him, together with her Cargo, and all the Papers that were found on board of her, which had been sealed up and directed to the Vice Admiralty Court at Halifax.  
  
In having the Honor, Sir, to submit this Case to your Consideration, it is hardly necessary for me to observe, that the Right of visiting and searching Merchant Ships on the high Seas, whatever the Ships, their Cargoes, or their Destinations, may be; as well as that of sending the Ships into Port for the Investigation of the Admiralty Court of the belligerent Party, when cause of Suspicion shall present itself, are the incontestible Rights of a lawfully commissioned Cruizer of a belligerant Nation, since I believe that those Rights are fully acknowledged by the Government of the United States. It is, then, only requisite for me to advert particularly, in the Case in question, to the Suspicio

I will beg Leave to add, that the Case in question seems moreover to acquire a very great Importance, and to demand the Remedy solicited by the Restitution of the Ship and Cargo, from the Consideration, that if neutral Crews may be allowed to resort to Violence to withdraw themselves out of the Possession taken by a lawful Cruizer for the Purpose of Legal Inquiry the whole Business of the Detention of neutral Ships must become a Scene of mutual Hostility and Contention, and the Crews of neutral Ships must necessarily be guarded with all the Severity and Strictness practiced upon actual Cruizers

“neutral ship to make no resistance. Annoying as the exercise of this right
