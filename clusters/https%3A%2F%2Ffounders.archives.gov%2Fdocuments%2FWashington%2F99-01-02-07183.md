MvLord: I had the honor to receive  
your&#x27;Lordship&#x27;s letter of this day. , The ar­  
dent desire to spare every effusion of blood  
will readily incline me to listen to such terms  
for the surrender of your posts, -York and  
Gloucester, as are admissible. I wish, pre­  
vious to the meeting of commissioners, that  
your Lordship&#x27;s proposals in writing may be  
sent to the American lines, for which pur­  
pose a cessation of hostilities, during two  
hours from the delivery of this letter will be  
granted. I have the honor to be, etc.
