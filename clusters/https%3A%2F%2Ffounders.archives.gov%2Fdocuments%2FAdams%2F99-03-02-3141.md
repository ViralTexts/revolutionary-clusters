My ever dear Sir  
Quincy July 22nd. 1816  
  
“Chain’d to his Throne, a Volume lies,  
With all the Fates of Men:  
With every Angels form and Size  
Drawn by th’ eternal Pen.  
His Providence unfolds the Book  
And makes his Counsells Shine;  
Each Opening leaf; and every Stroke  
Fulfills Some deep design.  
Here he exalts, neglected Worms  
To Sceptres and a Crown:  
Anon the following Page he turns  
And treads the Monark down.  
Nor Gabriel asks the Reason Why,  
Nor God the Reason gives;  
Nor dares the favourite Angel pry  
Between the folded Leaves.  
Dr. Watts’s Lyric Poems.

 great measure, owing  
to the renovating storms wliieh have, in for­  
mer ages, passed over our country.  
Hence we may truly say with the lamented  
Bishop Heber, the admired poet, distin­  
gushed divine and devoted missionary,  
Tile Lord ol nature, o&#x27;er this changeful ball  
Decrees the rise of empires and the fall:  
Wondrous in all his ways, unseen, unknown,  
He treads the wine-press of the earth alone ;  
And robed in darkness and surrounding fears,  
Speeds on their destined road the march of years.  
Or in the words of another, well worthy of  
a place with Heber both as poet and divine,  
the good Dr. Watts,  
Chain&#x27;d to His throne a volume lies.  
With all the fates of men.  
With every angel&#x27;s form and size  
• Drawn by tlr eternal pen.  
His providence unfolds the book,  
And makes his counsels shine.  
Each op’ning leaf and cv&#x27;ry stroke  
Fulfils some deep design.  
Here he exalts neglected worms  
To sceptres and a crown.  
Anon the foH’wiug page he turns.  
And treads the monarch down.  
Not Gabriel asks the reason why.  
Nor God Uie reason gives ;  
Nor dares the fav&#x27;riie angel pry  
Between the folded leaves.
