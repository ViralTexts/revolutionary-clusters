Universal Peace.  
Among the various reforms which have been offered to the world, the projects for universal peace have done the greatest honor to the hearts, though they seem to have done very little to the heads of their authors. Rousseau, the most distinguished of these philanthropists, has recommended a confederation of sovereigns, under a council of deputies, for the double purpose of arbitrating external controversies among nations, and of guaranteeing their respective governments against internal revolutions. He was aware, neither of the impossibility of executing his pacific plan among governments which feel so many allurements to war, nor, what is more extraordinary, of the tendency of his plan to perpetuate arbitrary power wherever it existed; and, by extinguishing the hope of one day seeing an end of oppression, to cut off the only source of consolation remaining to the oppressed.  
  
A universal and perpetual peace, it is to be feared, is in the catalogue of events, which will never exist but in the imaginations of visionary philosophers, or in the breasts of benevolent enthusiasts. It is still however true, that war contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason; and if any thing is to be hoped, every thing ought to be tried.  
Wars may be divided into two classes; one flowing from the mere will of the government, the other according with the will of the society itself.  
Those of the first class can no otherwise be prevented than by such a reformation of the government, as may identify its will with the will of the society. The project of Rousseau was, consequently, as preposterous as it was impotent. Instead of beginning with an external application, and even precluding internal remedies, he ought to have commenced with, and chiefly relied on the latter prescription.  
He should have said, whilst war is to depend on those whose ambition, whose revenge, whose avidity, or whose caprice may contradict the sentiment of the community, and yet be uncontrouled by it; whilst war is to be declared by those who are to spend the public money, not by those who are to pay it; by those who are to direct the public forces, not by those who are to support them; by those whose power is to be raised, not by those whose chains may be riveted the disease must continue to be hereditary like the government of which it is the offspring. A⟨s⟩ the first step towards a cure, the government itself must be regenerated. Its will must be made subordinate to, or rather the same with, the will of the community.  
Had Rousseau lived to see the constitutions of the United States and of France, his judgment might have escaped the censure to which his project has exposed it.  
The other class of wars, corresponding with the public will, are less susceptible of remedy. There are antidotes, nevertheless, which may not be without their efficacy. As wars of the first class were to be prevented by subjecting the will of the government to the will of the society, those of the second, can only be controuled by subjecting the will of the society to the reason of the society; by establishing permanent and constitutional maxims of conduct, which may prevail over occasional impressions, and inconsiderate pursuits.  
Here our republican philosopher might have proposed as a model to lawgivers, that war should not only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits: but that each generation should be made to bear the burden of its own wars, instead of carrying them on, at the expence of other generations. And to give the fullest energy to his plan, he might have added, that each generation should not only bear its own burdens, but that the taxes composing them, should include a due proportion of such as by their direct operation keep the people awake, along with those, which being wrapped up in other payments, may leave them asleep, to misapplications of their money.  
To the objection, if started, that where the benefits of war descend to succeeding generations, the burdens ought also to descend, he might have answered: that the exceptions could not be easily made; that, if attempted, they must be made by one only of the parties interested; that in the alternative of sacrificing exceptions to general rules, or of converting exceptions into general rules, the former is the lesser evil; that the expense of necessary wars, will never exceed the resources of an entire generation; that, in fine, the objection vanishes before the fact, that in every nation which has drawn on posterity for the support of its wars, the accumulated interest of its perpetual debts, has soon become more than a sufficient principal, for all its exigencies.  
Were a nation to impose such restraints on itself, avarice would be sure to calculate the expences of ambition; in the equipoise of these passions, reason would be free to decide for the public good; and an ample reward would accrue to the state, first, from the avoidance of all its wars of folly, secondly, from the vigor of its unwasted resources for wars of necessity and defence. Were all nations to follow the example, the reward would be doubled to each; and the temple of Janus might be shut, never to be opened more.  
Had Rousseau lived to see the rapid progress of reason and reformation, which the present day exhibits, the philanthropy which dictated his project would find a rich enjoyment in the scene before him: And after tracing the past frequency of wars to a will in the government independent of the will of the people; to the practice by each generation of taxing the principal of its debts on future generations; and to the facility with which each generation is seduced into assumptions of the interest, by the deceptive species of taxes which pay it; he would contemplate, in a reform of every government subjecting its will to that of the people, in a subjection of each generation to the payment of its own debts, and in a substitution of a more palpable, in place of an imperceptible mode of paying them, the only hope of universal and perpetual peace.

UNIVERSAL PEACE.  
AMONG the various reforms which have  
been offered to the world, the pro­  
jects for universal peace have done the  
greatelt honor to the hearts, though they  
seem to have done very little to the heads  
of their authors. Roufieau, the mo ft dis­  
tinguished of these philanthropies, has re­  
commended a conrederation of sovereigns,  
under a council of deputies, for the double  
purpose of arbitrating external controver­  
sies among nations, and of guaranteeing their  
relpective governments against internal re­  
volutions. He was aware, neither of the  
itnpofiibility of executing hi pacific plan  
among governments which feel so many al­  
lurements to war, nor, what is more ex­  
traordinary, of the tendency of his plan to  
perpetuate arbitrary power wherever it  
exilted ; ar.d, by extinguishing the hope of  
one day feeing an end of oppreiliou, to cut  
off the only source of consolation remaining  
to the opprefled.  
A universal and perpetual peace, it is to  
be feared, is in the catalogue of events,  
which Will never exiit but in the imagina­  
tions of visionary philosophers, or in the  
breads of benevolent enthulialh. It is flill  
however true, that war contains so much  
folly, as well as wickedness, that much is  
to be hoped from the progress of reason :  
and if any thing is to be hoped, every thing  
ought to be tried.  
Wars may be divided into two classes;  
one flowing from the mere will of the  
government, the other according with the  
will of the society itfelf.  
Tliofe of the firit class can no otherwise  
be prevented than by such a reformation of  
the government, as may identify its will  
with the will of the society. The project  
of Roufieau, was, consequently, as prepos­  
terous as it was impotent. Instead of be­  
ginning with an external application, and  
even precluding internal remedies, he ought  
to have commenced with, and chiefly reiTed  
on the latter prescription.  
He fnould have said, whilfl war is to de­  
pend on tliofe whole ambition, whose re­  
venge, whole avidity, or whose caprice may  
contradict the sentiment of the community,  
and yet be uncontrolled by it ; whilst war  
is to be declared by thole who are to spend  
the public money, not by those who are to  
pay it; by those who are to dire it the pub­  
lic forces, not by those who are to support  
  
Js-mi ; 1 v those whnft pnr.&#x27;er L to be raised.  
not bv thpfe whose chains inay be riveted  
-Vie disease must coijtinue to be hereditary  
like the government of which it is the pff­  
rpring. As the firft step towards a cure,  
the government itfelf must be regenerated.  
Its wiH must be made subordinate to, 01  
rather the fame with, the will of the com­  
munity.  
Had Ron fie mi lived to fee the conftrfuti­  
ons of the United State* and of France, hi;  
judgment might have escaped the cenfurc  
to which his prajeft has exposed it.  
The other claf; of war;, correfpondins  
with the public will, are less susceptible ol  
remedy- There are antidotes, neverthe­  
less, which may not be without their effica­  
cy. As wars of the firft class were to be  
prevented by fubjefting the will of the gov­  
ernment to the will of the society, thole ol  
the second, can only be controuled by fub­  
iefting the will of the society to the reSkfor  
&gt;f the society; byeftablifhing permanentanc  
ronftitutional maxims of conduCt, whicl  
may prevail over occasional impressions.  
ind inconsiderate pursuits.  
Here our republican philosopher S»ighi  
lave proposed as a model to lawgivers; thai  
ivar should not only be declared by th(? au­  
hority ofthe people, whose toUs and trea­  
&quot;uresare to support its burdens, instead o:  
:he government which is to reap its fruits  
nit that each generation fliocld be made t(  
iear the burden of its own wars, inftend o  
■arryiug them 011, at the expence of tithe;  
.fenerations. And to give the fill!c-ft ejer  
;y t6 hi&#x27;- plan, he might have added, tha  
each generation should not only bear   
jurdens, but that the taxes   
hould include a due proportion of ftich a  
jy i heir direct operation keep the peoph  
iwake, along with those, which being wrap  
&quot;&gt;ed up in other payments, may leavejhSn  
ifleep. to misapplications of their money.  
To the objection, if llarted, that when  
:he benefits of v.-ar descend to fucceedin;  
generations, the burdens ought also to de­  
scend. he might have answered ; that th&lt;  
exceptions could not be easily made f that  
f attempted, they must be made by one on­  
y of &quot;the p irties interested : that in th&lt;  
ilternative of facrificing exceptions So ge­  
leral rules, or of converting exception:  
nto general rules, the former is the leflei  
-vil ; that the expense of ncceflaryw-er*, wil

UNIVERSAL PEACE.  
MONG the various reforms which have been offered to the world, the  
projects for univerfal peace have done the greateft honour to the hearts,  
though they feem to have done very little to the heads of their authors. Rou€-  
feav, the moft diftinguithed of thefe philanthropifts, has recommended a confe-  
deration of fovereigns, under a council of deputies, for the double purpoie of  
arbitrating external controveifies among nations, and of guaranteeing t“eir re-  
fpeftive governments againft internal revolutions. He was aware, neither of  
the impoffibility of executing his pacific plin among governments which feel fo  
many allurements to war, nor, what is more extraordinary, of the tendency of  
his plan to perpetutte arbitrary power wherever it exilted ; and, by extinguith-  
ing the hope of one day feeing an end of oppreffion, to cut off the only fource  
of confolation remaining to the oppreffed.  
  
An univerfal and perpetual perce, it is to be feared, is in the catalogue of  
events, which will never exift but in the imaginations of vifionary philofo-  
phers, or in the breafts of benevolent enthufiafts. It 1s ftill, however, true,  
that war contains fo much folly, as well as wickednefs, that much is to be  
hoped from the progreis of reafon: and if any thing is to be hoped, every  
thing ought to be tried. .  
  
Wars may be divided into two claffes; one flowing from the mere will of  
the government, the other according with the will of the fociety itfelf.  
  
Thofe of the firtt clafs can no otherwife be prevented than by fuch areforma-  
tion of the government as may identify its will with the will of the fociety.  
The proje&amp; of Roufleau was, confequently, as prepoftercus as it was impo-  
tent. Inftead of beginning with an external application, and even precluding  
internal remedies, he ought to have commenced with, and chiefly relied on  
the latter prefcription.  
  
He fhould have faid, while war is to depend on thofe whofe ambition, whofe  
revenge, whoie avidity, or whole caprice may contradié the fentiment of the  
community, and yet be uncontrouled by it—while war is to be declared by  
thofe who are tofpend the public money, net ty thofe who are te pay it—by thofe  
who are to direé the public forces, not by thofe who are to fupport themn—by  
thofe whole power is to be railed, not by thofe whofe chains may be rivetted, .  
the difeafe mult continue to be hereditary, like the government, of which it is  
the offspring. As the firtt fteptowards a cure, the government itfelf muft be  
regenerated, Its will muft be made {ubordinate to, or rather the fame with, the  
wiilof the community.  
  
Had Roufferu lived to fie the conftitution of the united ftates and of France,  
his judgment might have efcaped the cenfure to which his project has ex pofed it.  
‘The other ciais of wars, correfponding with the public will, are lefs futceptible  
of remedy. There are antidotes, neverthelefs, which may not be witheut their  
efficacy. As wors of the fi ft ciafs are to be prevented by fubjecting the will  
of the government to the will of the fociety, thofe of the fecond can only he  
controuled by fubjeéting te willof the fociety to the reafon of the fociety—by  
eitablithing permanent and conftitutional maxims of conduét, which may pre-  
vail over eccafional imprefions, and ingonfiderate purfuits.  
  
Here our republican phil fopher might have propofed as a maxim to lawgi-  
vers, that war fhould not enly be declared by the authority of the people, whofe  
t ils and treatures are to fupport its burdens, inftead of the government, which  
is to reap itstraits : but that each generation fhould be made to bear the bur -  
den of is own was, infteadof cariving them on at the expenie of other gene-  
rations. And to give the fullett energy to this plan, he might have added, thot  
eac) generation fhonld not eniy bear its own burdens, but that the taxes com-  
pofing them, fhould include a due proportion of fuch as by their dire&amp;t operas

other payments, may Jeave them afleep, to mifapplications of their money,  
  
To the objc&amp;tion, if ftarted, that where the bene fits of war defcend to fuc-  
ceeding generations, the burdens ought alfo todefcend, he might have anfwered ;  
that the exceptions could not he eatily made ; that, if attempted, they mutt be  
made by one only of the parties interefted ; that in the alternative of facrificing  
exceptions to general rules, or of converting exceptions into general rules, the  
former is the Jeffer evil; that the expenfe of neceflary wars, will never exceed  
the refources of an entire generation ; that, in fine, the objeftion vanifhes be-~  
fore the faét, that in every nation which has drawn on pofterity for the fupport  
of its wars, the accumulated intereft of its perpetual debts, has foon become  
more than a fufficient principal, for all its exigencies.  
  
Were a nation to impofe fuch reftraints on ifelf, avarice would be fure to  
calculate the expenfes of ambition ; in the equipoiie of thefe paffions, .reafon  
would be free to decide for the publie good; and an ample reward would ac-  
crue to the flate, firft, from the avoidance of ali its wars of folly; fecondly,  
from the vigour of its unwafted refources for wars of neceffity and defence.  
Were all nations to follow the exainple, the reward would be deuble te each ;  
and the temple of Janus might be fhut, never to be opened more.  
  
Had Rouffeau lived to fee the rapid progrefs of reafon and reformation,  
which the prefent day exhibits, the philanthropy which di&amp;tated his project  
would find a rich enjoyment in the feene before him : and after tracing the  
patt frequency of wars to a will in the government independent of the will of  
the people—to the practice by each generation of taxing the principal of its  
debts on future generations—and to the facility with which each generation is  
feduced into affumptions of the intereft, by the deceptive {pecies of taxes which  
pay it; he would contemplate, in a reform of every government, fubjefting its  
will to that of the people, in a fubjeftion of each generation to the payment ef  
its own debts, and in a fubftitution of a more palpable, in place of an imper-  
ceptible mode of paying them, the only hope of UNIVERSAL AND PERPE-
