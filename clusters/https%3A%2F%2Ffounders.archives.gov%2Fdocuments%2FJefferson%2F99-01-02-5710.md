I WASHINGrON, June 7, 1807.  
Sin: Your favor of March 30 never reached my hands  
till May 1. The friendly views it expresses of my con  
duct in general give me great satisfaction. For these  
testimonies of the approbation of my fellow-citizens, I  
know that I am indebted more to their indulgent dispo-­  
sitions than to any peculiar claims of my own. For it  
can give no great claims to any one to manage honestly  
and disinterestedly the concerns of others trusted to  
him. Abundant examples of this are always under our  
eye. That I should lay down my charge at a proper sea-  
son is as much a duty as to have borne it faith-  
fully. Being very sensible of bodily decays from  
advancing years I ought not to doubt their effect on the  
mental faculties. To do so would evince either great  
self-love or little observation of what passes under our  
eyes, and I shall be fortunate if I am the first to per-­  
ceive and to obey this admonition of nature. That  
there are in our country a great number of characters  
entirely equal to the management of its affairs cannot  
be doubted. Many of them, indeed, have not had op-­  
portunities of making themselves known to their fellow-­  
citizens; but many have had, and the only difficulty  
will be to choose among them. These changes are neces  
sary, too, for the security of republican government.  
If some period be not fixed, either by the Constitution  
or by practice, to the services of the Firat Magistrate,  
his office, though nominaily elective, will, in fact, be for  
life, and that will soon degenerate into an inheritance
