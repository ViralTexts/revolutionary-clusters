[6 July 1775]  
  
A Declaration by the Reprensentatives of the United Colonies of North-America, now met in Congress at Philadelphia, setting forth the Causes and Necessity of their taking up Arms.  
if it was possible for Men, who exercise their Reason to believe, that the Divine Author of our Existence intended a Part of the human Race to hold an absolute Property in, and an unbounded Power over others, marked out by his infinite Goodness and Wisdom, as the Objects of a legal Domination never rightfully resistible, however severe and oppressive, the Inhabitants of these Colonies might at least require from the Parliament of Great-Britain some Evidence, that this dreadful Authority over them has been granted to that Body. But a Reverence for our great Creator, Principles of Humanity, and the Dictates of Common Sense, must convince all those who reflect upon the Subject, that Government was instituted to promote the Welfare of Mankind, and ought to be administered for the Attainment of that End. The Legislature of Great-Britain, however, stimulated by an inordinate Passion for a Power not only unjustifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very Constitution of that Kingdom, and desperate of Success in any Mode of Contest, where Regard should be had to Truth, Law, or Right, have at Length, deserting those, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic Purpose of enslaving these Colonies by Violence, and have thereby rendered it necessary for us to close with their last Appeal from Reason to Arms. Yet, however blinded that Assembly may be, by their intemperate Rage for unlimited Domination, so to Slight Justice and the Opinion of Mankind, we esteem ourselves bound by Obligations of  Respect to the Rest of the World, to make known the Justice of our Cause.  
Our Forefathers, Inhabitants of the Island of Great-Britain, left their Native Land, to seek on these Shores a Residence for civil and religious Freedom. At the Expence of their Blood, at the Hazard of their Fortunes, without the least Charge to the Country from which they removed, by unceasing Labour and an unconquerable Spirit, they effected Settlements in the distant and inhospitable Wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike Nations of Barbarians. Societies or Governments, vested with perfect Legislatures, were formed under Charters from the Crown, and an harmonious Intercourse was established between the Colonies and the Kingdom from which they derived their Origin. The mutual Benefits of this Union became in a short Time so extraordinary, as to excite Astonishment. It is universally confessed, that the amazing Increase of the Wealth, Strength, and Navigation of the Realm, arose from this Source; and the Minister, who so wisely and successfully directed the Measures of Great-Britain in the late War, publicly declared, that these Colonies enabled her to triumph over her Enemies. Towards the Conclusion of that War, it pleased our Sovereign to make a Change in his Counsels. &gt;From that fatal Moment, the Affairs of the British Empire began to fail into Confusion, and gradually sliding from the Summit of glorious Prosperity to which they had been advanced by the Virtues and Abilities of one Man, are at length distracted by the Convulsions, that now shake it to its deepest Foundations. The new Ministry finding the brave Foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet still contending, took up the unfortunate Idea of granting them a hasty Peace, and of then subduing her faithful Friends.  
These devoted Colonies were judged to be in such a State, as to present Victories without Bloodshed, and all the easy Emoluments of statuteable Plunder. The uninterrupted Tenor of their peaceable and respectful Behaviour from the Beginning of Colonization, their dutiful, zealous, and useful Services during the War, though so recently and amply acknowledged in the most honourable Manner by his Majesty, by the late King, and by Parliament, could not save them from the meditated Innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious Project, and assuming a new Power over them, have in the Course of eleven Years given such decisive Specimens of the Spirit and Consequences attending this Power, as to leave no Doubt concerning the Effects of Acquiescence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our Money without our Consent, though we have ever exercised an exclusive Right to dispose of our own Property; Statutes have been passed for extending the Jurisdiction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty beyond their ancient Limits; for depriving us of the accustomed and inestimable Privilege of Trial by Jury in Cases affecting both Life and Property; for suspending the Legislature of one of the Colonies; for interdicting all Commerce to the Capital of another; and for altering fundamentally the Form of Government established by Charter, and secured by Acts of its own Legislature solemnly confirmed by the Crown; for exempting the “Murderers” of Colonists from legal Trial, and in  Effect, from Punishment; for erecting in a neighbouring Province, acquired by the joint Arms of Great-Britain and America, a Despotism dangerous to our very Existence; and for quartering Soldiers upon the Colonists in Time of profound Peace. It has also been resolved in Parliament, that Colonists charged with committing certain Offences, shall be transported to England to be tried.  
But why should we enumerate our Injuries in detail? By one Statute it is declared, that Parliament can “of right make Laws to bind us in all Cases whatsoever.” What is to defend us against so enormous, so unlimited a Power? Not a single Man of those who assume it, is chosen by us; or is subject to our Controul or Influence; but on the Contrary, they are all of them exempt from the Operation of such Laws, and an American Revenue, if not diverted from the ostensible Purposes for which it is raised, would actually lighten their own Burdens in Proportion, as they increase ours. We saw the Misery to which such Despotism would reduce us. We for ten Years incessantly and ineffectually besieged the Throne as Supplicants; we reasoned, we remonstrated with Parliament in the most mild and decent Language.  
Administration sensible that we should regard these oppressive Measures as Freemen ought to do, sent over Fleets and Armies to enforce them. The Indignation of the Americans was roused, it is true; but it was the Indignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate People. A Congress of Delegates from the United Colonies was assembled at Philadelphia, on the fifth Day of last September. We resolved again to offer an humble and dutiful Petition to the King, and also addressed our Fellow Subjects of Great-Britain. We have pursued every temperate, every respectful Measure; we have even proceeded to break off our commercial Intercourse with our Fellow Subjects, as the last peaceable Admonition, that our Attachment to no Nation upon Earth should supplant our Attachment to Liberty. This, we flattered ourselves, was the ultimate Step of the Controversy: But subsequent Events have shewn, how vain was this Hope of finding Moderation in our Enemies.  
Several threatening Expressions against the Colonies were inserted in His Majesty’s Speech; our Petition, tho’ we were told it was a Decent one, and that his Majesty had been pleased to receive it graciously, and to promise laying it before his Parliament, was huddled into both Houses among a Bundle of American Papers, and there neglected. The Lords and Commons in their Address, in the Month of February, said, that “a Rebellion at that Time actually existed within the Province of Massachusetts-Bay; and that those concerned in it, had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful Combinations and Engagements, entered into by his Majesty’s Subjects in several of the other Colonies; and therefore they besought his Majesty, that he would take the most effectual Measures to inforce due Obedience to the Laws and Authority of the Supreme Legislature.” Soon after, the commercial Intercourse of whole Colonies, with foreign Countries, and with each other, was cut off by an Act of Parliament; by another, several of them were intirely prohibited from the Fisheries in the Seas near their Coasts, on which  they always depended for their Sustenance; and large Re-inforcements of Ships and Troops were immediately sent over to General Gage.  
Fruitless were all the entreaties, arguments, and eloquence of an Illustrious Band of the most distinguished Peers, and Commoners, who nobly and strenuously asserted the Justice of our Cause, to stay, or even to mitigate the heedless fury with which these accumulated and unexampled Outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitless was the interference of the City of London, of Bristol, and many other respectable Towns in our Favour. Parliament adopted an insidious Manoeuvre calculated to divide us, to establish a perpetual Auction of Taxations where Colony should bid against Colony, all of them uninformed what Ransom would redeem their Lives; and thus to extort from us, at the Point of the Bayonet, the unknown sums that should be sufficient to gratify, if possible to gratify, ministerial Rapacity, with the miserable indulgence left to us of raising, in our own Mode, the prescribed Tribute. What Terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remorseless Victors to conquered Enemies? In our circumstances to accept them, would be to deserve them.  
Soon after the Intelligence of these proceedings arrived on this Continent, General Gage, who in the course of the last Year had taken Possession of the Town of Boston, in the Province of Massachusetts-Bay, and still occupied it as a Garrison, on the 19th day of April, sent out from that Place a large detachment of his Army, who made an unprovoked Assault on the Inhabitants of the said Province, at the Town of Lexington, as appears by the Affidavits of a great Number of Persons, some of whom were Officers and Soldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the Inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the Troops proceeded in warlike Array to the Town of Concord, where they set upon another Party of the Inhabitants of the same Province, killing several and wounding more, until compelled to retreat by the country People suddenly assembled to repel this cruel Aggression. Hostilities, thus commenced by the British Troops, have been since prosecuted by them without regard to Faith or Reputation. The Inhabitants of Boston being confined within that Town by the General their Governor, and having, in order to procure their dismission, entered into a Treaty with him, it was stipulated that the said Inhabitants having deposited their Arms with their own Magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking with them their other Effects. They accordingly delivered up their Arms, but in open violation of Honour, in defiance of the obligation of Treaties, which even savage Nations esteemed sacred, the Governor ordered the Arms deposited as aforesaid, that they might be preserved for their owners, to be seized by a Body of Soldiers; detained the greatest part of the Inhabitants in the Town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their most valuable Effects behind.  
By this perfidy Wives are separated from their Husbands, Children from their Parents, the aged and the sick from their Relations and Friends, who wish to attend and comfort them; and those who have been used to live in Plenty and even Elegance, are reduced to deplorable Distress.  
  
The General, further emulating his ministerial Masters, by a Proclamation bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the grossest Falsehoods and Calumnies against the good People of these Colonies, proceeds to “declare them all, either by Name or Description, to be Rebels and Traitors, to supersede the course of the Common Law, and instead thereof to publish and order the use and exercise of the Law Martial.” His Troops have butchered our Countrymen, have wantonly burnt Charlestown, besides a considerable number of Houses in other Places; our Ships and Vessels are seized; the necessary supplies of Provisions are intercepted, and he is exerting his utmost Power to spread destruction and devastation around him.  
We have received certain Intelligence, that General Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is instigating the People of that Province and the Indians to fall upon us; and we have but too much reason to apprehend, that Schemes have been formed to excite domestic Enemies against us. In brief, a part of these Colonies now feel, and all of them are sure of feeling, as far as the Vengeance of Administration can inflict them, the complicated Calamities of Fire, Sword, and Famine. We are reduced to the alternative of chusing an unconditional Submission to the tyranny of irritated Ministers, or resistance by Force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary Slavery. Honour, Justice, and Humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that Freedom which we received from our gallant Ancestors, and which our innocent Posterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding Generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary Bondage upon them.  
Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal Resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign Assistance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as signal Instances of the Divine Favour towards us, that his Providence would not permit us to be called into this severe Controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike Operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With hearts fortified with these animating Reflections, we most solemnly, before God and the World, declare, that, exerting the utmost Energy of those Powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the Arms we have been compelled by our Enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every Hazard, with unabating Firmness and Perseverence, employ for the preservation of our Liberties; being with one Mind resolved to die Freemen rather than to live Slaves.  
Lest this Declaration should disquiet the Minds of our Friends and Fellow-Subjects in any part of the Empire, we assure them that we mean not to dissolve that Union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored. Necessity has not yet driven us into that desperate Measure, or induced us to excite any other Nation to War against them. We have not raised Armies with ambitious Designs of separating from Great-Britain, and establishing Independent States. We fight not for Glory or for Conquest. We exhibit to  Mankind the remarkable Spectacle of a People attacked by unprovoked Enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of Offence. They boast of their Privileges and Civilization, and yet proffer no milder Conditions than Servitude or Death.  
In our own native Land, in defence of the Freedom that is our Birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late Violation of it—for the protection of our Property, acquired solely by the honest Industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against Violence actually offered, we have taken up Arms. We shall lay them down when Hostilities shall cease on the part of the Aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.  
With an humble Confidence in the Mercies of the supreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the Universe, we most devoutly implore his Divine Goodness to protect us happily through this great Conflict, to dispose our Adversaries to reconciliation on reasonable Terms, and thereby to relieve the Empire from the Calamities of civil War.

uncer Charters frem the Crown, and an harmonious  
intercourſe was eſtabliſhed between the Colonies and  
the Kingdom from which they derived their origin. The  
invtuai benefits of this union became in a ſhort time fo

ration of ſuch laws; and an American reve-  
nue, if not diverted from the oftenſible purpoſes for  
which it is raiſed, would actually lighten their own bur-  
dens in proportion as they increaſe ours. We ſaw the  
miſery to which ſuch deſpotiſm would reduce us. We  
for ten years inceflantly and inefteAQually befieged the  
Throne as ſupplicants; we reaſoned, we remonſtrated  
with Parliament in the moſt mild and decent language.  
But Adminiſtration, ſenſible that we ſhould regard theſe  
oppreſſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, ſent over  
fleets and armies to enforce them. The indignation of  
the Americans was rouled, it is true; but it was the in-  
dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people.  
A Congreſs of Delegates from the United Colonies was  
aſſembled at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of laft Septem-  
ber. We reſolved agzin to offer an humble and duriful  
Petition to the King, and alſo addreſſed our fellow-ſub-  
jects of Great-Britain, We have purſued every tempe-  
rate, every reſpectful meaſure ; we have even proceeded  
to break off our commercial intercourſe with our fellow-  
ſubjects, as the laſt peaceable admonition, that our attach-  
ment to no nation upon earth ſhould ſupplant our at-  
tachment to liberty. This we flattered ourfſ-lves was  
the ultimate ſtep of the controverſy ; but the ſubſequent  
events have ſhewn, how vain is this hope of finding mo-  
deration in our enemies.  
  
Several threatening expreſſions againſt the Colonies  
were inſerted in his Majeſty&#x27;s Speech. Our Petition,  
though we were told it was a decent one, that his  
Majeſty nad been pleaſed to receive it graciouſly, and  
to promiſe dying it before his Parliament, was huddled  
into both Houſes amongſt a bundle of American papers,  
and there neglected. The Lords and Commons in their  
Addreſs, in the month of February, ſaid, That a re-  
&lt;&lt; bellion at that time actually exifted within the Pro-  
  
© vince  
  
a2  
  
« vince of Maſſachuſet&#x27;s Bay; and that thoſe con-  
« cerned in it had been countenanced and encourage.  
« by unlawful combinations and en ments, entered  
„into by his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects in teveral of the other  
« Colonies; and therefore they beſought his Majeſty,  
that he would take the molt effectual meaſures to en-  
« force due obedience to the laws and authority of the  
« Supreme Legiſlature. Soon after the commercial  
intercourſe of whole Colonies, with foreign countries,  
and with each other, was cut off by an Ad of Parlia-  
ment ; by another, ſeveral of them were entirely prohi-  
bited from the fiſheries in the ſeas near their coaſts,  
on which they always depended for their ſuſtenance ;  
and large reinforcements of ſhips and troops were im-  
mediately ſent over to General Gage.  
  
Fruitleſs were all the entreaties, arguments and elo-  
quence of an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhed  
Peers and Commoners, who nobly and ſtrenuouſly aſſerted  
the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay or even to mitigate the  
heedleſs fury with which theſe accumulated and unex-  
ampled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitleſs was  
the interference of the City of London, of Briſtol, and  
many other reſpectable towns, in our favour. Parlia-  
ment adopted an infidious manceuvre, calculated to di-  
vide us, toeftabliſh a perpetual auction of taxations, where  
Colony ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of them uninform-  
ed what ranſom ſhould redeem their lives; and thus to  
extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the un-  
known ſums that ſhould be ſufficient to gratify, if poſſi-  
ble to gratify, Miniſterial rapacity, with the miſerable  
indulgence to us of railing in our own mode the  
preſcribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humili-  
ating could have been dictated by remorſeleſs victors to  
conquered enemies ? In our circumſtances, to accept  
  
them would be to deſerve them.  
  
Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceedings arrived  
on this Continent, General Gage, who in the courſe of  
the laſt year had taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſton,  
in the province of Maffachuſet&#x27;s-Bay, and ſtill occupied  
it as a garriſon, on the 19th day of April ſent out from  
that place a large detachment of his army, who made an  
  
P 2 unprovoked  
  
( 108 ]  
  
unprovoked aſiault on the inhabitants of the ſaid province,  
at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of  
a great number of perſons, ſome of whom were officers  
and ſoldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the  
inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence  
the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of  
Concord, where they ſet upon another party of the inha-  
bitants of the ſame Province, killing ſeveral, and wound-  
ing more, until compelled to retreat by the country  
people ſuddenly aſſembled to repel this cruel  
Hoſtilities thus commenced by the Britiſh have  
been ſince proſecuted by them without regard to faith  
or reputation. The inhabitants of Boſton being con-  
fined within that town by the General their Governor,  
and having in order to their diſmittion entered  
into a treaty with him, it was ſtipulated that the faid  
inhabitants, having depoſited their arms with their own  
Magiſtrates, ſhould have liberty to depart, taking with  
them their other effects. They accordingly delivered  
up their arms; but in open violation of honour, in de-  
fiance of the obligation of treaties, which even ſavage  
nations eſteem ſacred, the Governor ordered the arms  
depoſited as aforeſaid, that they might be for  
their owners, to be ſeized by a body of ſoldiers; de-  
tained the greateſt part of the inhabitants in the town,  
and — the few who were permitted to retire, to  
leave their moſt valuable effects behind.  
  
By this perfidy wives are ſeparated from their huſ-  
4 children from their parents, the and ſick  
trom their relations and friends, who with to attend  
and comfort them ; and thoſe who have been uſed to live  
3 I and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable  
  
iſtrets.  
  
The General, further emulating his Miniſterial maſ-  
ers, by a proclamation, bearing date on the 12th day  
ks bu A after venting the groſſeſt falſehoods and calum-  
ntes againſt the good people of theſe Colonies, proceeds  
ro © declare them all, either by name or deſcription,  
* to be rebels and traitors, to ſuperſede the courſe of  
* the common law, and inſtead thereof to publiſh and  
6 order the uſe and exerciſe of the law martial. His  
  
troops  
  
  
troops have butchered our countrymen; have wantonly  
durnt Charles Town, beſides a conſiderable number of  
houſes in other places; our ſhips and veſſels are ſeized ;  
the neceſlary ſupplies of proviſions are intercepted, and he  
is exerting his utmoſt power to ſpread ion and  
devaſtation around him.  
  
We have received certain intelligence, that General  
Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is inſtigating the  
people of that Province and the Indians to fall upon us;  
and we have but too much reaſon to apprehend, that  
ſchemes have been formed to excite domeſtic enemies  
againſt us. In brief, a part of theſe Colonies now feels,  
  
r  
of Adminiſtration can inflict them, the compli cala-  
mities of fire, fword and famine. We are reduced to the  
alternative of chufing an unconditional ſubmiſſion to the  
  
ny of irritated Miniſters, or reſiſtance by force.  
The Inter is our choice. We have counted the coſt  
of this conteſt, and find nothing fo dreadful as volun-  
tary ſlavery. Honour, juftice and humanity, forbid us  
tamely to ſurrender that freedom which we received  
from our gallant anceftors, and which our innocent  
poſterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot  
endure the infamy and guilt of reſigning ſucceeding  
generations to that wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits  
them, if we baſely entail hereditary bondage upon them.  
  
Our cauſe is juſt : our ___ Ay { —  
reſources are great, and if x

as ſignal inftances of Divine favour towards us, that his  
Providence would not permit us to be called into this ſe-

clare, that, exerting the utmoſt energy of thoſe powers

Leſt this Declaration ſhould diſquiet the minds of our  
friends and fellow · ſubjects in any part uf the empire, we  
aſture them, that we mean not to difloive that union  
which has ſo long and fo happily ſubſted between us,  
and which we — wiſh to ice reſtored. Neceſſity  
has not yet driven us into that deſperate meaſure, oc in-

adminiſtered tor the attainment of that end. The Legi-  
flature of Great Britain, however, ftimulated by an in-  
ordinate paſſion for a power not only unjultifiable, but  
which they know to be. peculiarly reprobated by the  
very conſtitution of thit Kingdom, and detperate of ſuc-  
ceſs in any mode of conteſt, where regard ſhould be had  
to truth, law, or right, have at length, deſerting thoſe,  
attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpoſe of  
enſlaving theſe Colonies by violence, and have thereby  
rendered it neceſſary for us to cloſe with their laſt ap-  
  
al from reaſon to arins.—Y et, however blinded that  
Aſſembly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimit-  
ed domination, fo to flight juitice and the opinion of  
mankind, we eſteem ourſelves bound by obligations of  
reſpect to the reſt of the world, to make known the juſtice  
of our cauſe.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland of Great  
Britain, left their native land, to ſeek on theſe ſhores a  
reſidence for civil and religious freedom. At the ex-  
pence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes,  
without the leaſt charge to the country from which they  
removed, by unceafing labour, and an unconquerable  
ſpirit, they effected ſettlements in the diſtant — inhoſ-  
pitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous  
and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or go-  
vernments, veſted with perfect legiſlatures, were formed  
under Charters from the Crown, and an harmonious in-  
tercourſe was eſtabliſhed between the Colonies and the  
Kingdom from which they derived their ori.in. The  
mutual benefits of this union became in a ſhort time  
ſo extraordinary, as to excite aſtoniſhment. It is uni-  
verſaliy confeſſed, that the amazing increaſe of the  
wealth, ſtrength, and navigation ot the realm aroſe  
trom this fource; and the Miniſter who to writely  
and ſucceſsfully directed the meatures of Great Bri-  
tain in the late war, publickly declared, that theſe  
Colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies.  
— &quot;Towards the concluſion ot that war it pleaſed our  
Sovereign to make a change in his Councils.—F rom  
that fatal moment the aflairs of the Britiſh Empire be-  
gan to fall into conſufion, and gradually fi;ding from  
ihe ſummit of glorious proſperity, to which they 00  
  
cen  
  
L203  
  
been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man,  
are at length diſtracted by the convultions that now ſhake  
it to its deepeſt foundation. Tie new Ximittry nading  
the brave toes of Britain, though trequently ucreated,  
yet ſtill contending, took up the untortunate idea of  
grarting them a haſty peace, and of then wbduing her  
faithful friends.  
  
Theſe devoted Colonices were judged to be in ſucha  
ſtate as to preſent victories without bloodſhed, and all  
the eaſy emolumcnts of ſtatuteable plunder. The un-  
interrupted tenor of their peaceable and reſpectful be-  
haviout from the beginning of Colonization, their du-  
tizu), zealous, and utctul fervices during the war, tho”  
ſo recently and amply acknowledged in the molt lo-  
nourable manner by his Majeſty, by the late King,  
and by Parliament, could not ſave them from the medi-  
tated innov tions. Parliament was influenced to adopt  
the pernicious project, and aſſuming a new power over  
tiem, have, in the courſe of eleven years, given ſuch  
&amp;:.ihve ſpecimens of the ſpirit and conſequences attend-  
ing this power, as to |cave no doubt concerning the ef-  
fects of acquieſcence under it. They have undertaken  
to give and grant our money without our conſent, tho?  
we have ever exerciſed an excluſive right to diſpoſe of  
our own Property. Statutes have been paſſed for extend-  
ing the juriſdiction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-  
Admiralty beyond their ancient limits, for depriving us  
of the accuſtomed and ineſtumable privilege of trial by  
Jury in caſes affecting both lite and property; tor ſuſ-  
  
ing the legiflature ot one of the Colonies; for in-  
terdicting all commerce ot another; and for altering  
fundamentally the form of government, eſtablithed by  
charter, and ſecured by Acts of its on Legiſlature ſo-  
maln confirmed by the Crown; for exempting th2  
* Murd-rers” of Coloniſts from legal trial, and, in  
eſtect trom punithment ; tor eredding in a neighbour-  
ing Province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Bri-  
tain and America, a deſpotiſm dangerous to our very ex-  
iſtence; and tor quartering feiviers upon the Colontits  
in time of profound peace. It has allo been reſolved in  
Parliament, that Coloniits charged with committing  
certain  
  
55  
  
certain offences, ſhall be tranſported to England to be  
tried.  
  
But why ſhould we enumerate our injuries in detail?  
Ry one Statute it is decl.red, that Parliament can * of  
ri.-ht make laws to bind us in all caſes whatſoever”  
What is to defend us againſt fo enormous, ſo unlimit-  
ed a pewer? Not a ſingle man of thoſe who aſſume  
it, is choſen by us, or is ſubject to our controul or in-  
fluence ; but, on the contrary, they are all of them ex-  
empt from the opc ration of ſuch laws; and an American  
revenue, if not diverted from the oſtenſihle purpoſes for  
which it is raiſed, would actually lighten their own  
burdens in proportion as they increaſe ours. We faw  
the miſery to which ſuch de ſpotiſm would reduce us.  
We for ten years inceſſantly and ineffeQtually beſieged  
the Throne as ſupplicants; we reaſoned, we remonſtrated  
with Parliament in the moſt mild and decent language.  
But Adminiſtration, ſenſible that we ſhould regard theſe  
opprefſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, ſent over  
flo ets and armies to enforce them. The indignationof  
the Americans was rouſed, it is true; but it was the in-  
dignation of a virtuous, loyal and affectionate people,  
A Congreſs of Delegites from the United Colonies was  
»(Tembl-.4 at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of laſt Septem-  
ber. We refolved again to offer an humble and duti-  
ful Petition to the King, and alſo addreſſed our fel-  
low-ſubjects of Great-Britain, We have purſued every  
temper.:te, every reſpectiul meaſure; we have even pro-  
ceeded to break off our commercial intercourſe with  
our ſellow- ſubjects, as the laſt peaceable admonition,  
that our attachment to no nation upon earth ſhould ſup-  
plant cur attachment to liberty. This we flattered our-  
{Ives was the ultimate ſtep of the controverly ; but the  
ſubſ. quent events have ſhewn, how vain is this hope cf  
tinding moderation in our CNEmies,

to both Houſes amorgſt a bundle of American Papers,  
and there neglected. The Lords and Commons in their  
  
  
bellion at that time actually exiſted within the Province  
of Mafſachul. t&#x27;s Bay; and that thoſe concerned in it Ba.  
been countenanced and encouraged by unlawtul corhi-  
nations and engagements, entered into by his Nlajeſty&#x27;s  
jubjects in ſeveral of the other Colonies; and th. refure  
they beſought his Majeſty, that he would take the moi  
eſſe cual meaſures to enforce due obedience to the laws  
and authority of the Supreme Legiflature.” Soon after  
the commercial irtercourle of whole Colomes, with to-  
reien countries, and with each other, was cut off by an Act  
of Parliament; by another, ſeveral of them were entirely  
prohibited from the fiſheries in the ſeas near their coaſts,  
on which they always depended fer their ſuſtenance;  
and large reintorcements of 18 and troops were im-  
mediatcly ſent over to General Gaye.  
  
Fruitleſs wcre all the entreaties, arguments and elo-  
quence f an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhcd  
Peers and Commoners, whonobly and ſtrenuouſly aſſerted  
the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay or even to mitigate the  
heedlets fury with which theſe accumvlated and unexam-  
pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitleſs was the  
interference of the City of London, of Eriſtol, and many  
other reſpectable towns, in our favour. Parliament  
adopted an inſidious manœuvre, calculated to divide us,  
to eſtabliſh a perpetuai auction of taxations, where Colony  
ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of them uninformed what  
ranſom ſhould redeem their lives, and thus to extort from  
us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown ſums that  
ſhould be ſufficient to gratif , if poſſible to gratify, Mi-  
niiterial rapac ty, with the miſerable indulgence leſt to  
us of raiſing in cur own mode the preſcribed tribute.  
What terms more rigid an! humiliiting could have been  
dictated by remoricleis victors to conquered enemies? In  
our circuinſtances, to accept them would be to defcrie  
them.  
  
Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceedings arrived  
on this Cuntinent, General Gage, who in the courſe of  
the  
  
1  
the laſt year had taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſton,  
  
in the province of Maſlachutct&#x27;s-Bav, and fhil occu ied  
it as a garriſon, on the 19th day of April ſent cut ton  
that place a large cetachment of his army, who made an  
unprovoked aſſault on the inhabitants of the fat province,  
at the tuwn of Lexington, as appears b! the atrcavite of  
a great numbur of perions, forme &amp; wits w 2 utheers  
  
and ſoldiers of that detaclnunt, t of the  
inhabitants, and wounded many uu: un thence  
the troops precceded in warlike atray to! * wn of  
  
Concord, where they ft upen eri of tHe  
habitants «f the me Frovince, kvlirg 1 viral, and  
* ounde d miete, until cone cd to retreat by the ccun-  
try people ſusdenl) affe m | d to repel this cru àggreſ-  
fen. Hoefti&#x27;ities ti us commenced by the Eritifh troops,  
Lave Leen fince | tetecuted Ly them wit cu“ regard to  
faith or reputaten. he inhebitarts c .,ofton be;  
confined within that town by the General their Gover-  
nor, and having in «&lt;rcer to procure chert diimiſſion en-  
tered into a treaty with Him, it was ſtipulated that the  
Gid inhabitar ts, havirg depoſited their arms with t cir  
own M-giftrates, ſhould have liberty to depart, taking  
with them their other efleAs. They accerdingi) del-  
vered up their arms; but in open violation of Eoncur,  
in defiance of the obligation ot treaties, which even ſa-  
  
nations eſteem lacred, the Governor ordered the  
arms depoſited as aforeſaid, that they might be preſerved  
for their owners, to be ſeized by a body of ſoldiers; de-  
tained the greateſt part of the inhabitants in the town,  
and compelied the few who were permitted to retire, to  
leave their moſt valuable effects behind.  
  
By this perfidy wives are ſeparated from their huſbands,  
children trom their parents, the aged and ſick from their  
relations and triends, who wiſh to attend and comfort  
them; and thote who have been uſed to live in plenty,  
and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable diſtreis

to © declare them all, either by name or deſcription, to  
be rebels and traitors, to ſuperſede the courſe of the  
common law, and inſtead thereof to publiſh and order the  
uſe and exerciſe of the law martial.” His troops have  
butchered our countrymen; have wantonly burnt Charles  
Town, beſides a conſiderable number of houſes in other  
places; our ſhips and veſſels are ſeized; the  
  
ſupplies of proviſions are intercepted, and he is exerting  
his utmoſt power to ſpread deſtruction and devaſtation  
around him.  
  
We have received certain intelligence, that General  
Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is inſtigating the  
people of that Province and the Indians to fall upon us;  
and we have but too much reaſon to apprehend, that  
ſchemes have been formed to excite domeſtic enemies  
againſt us. In brief, a part of theſe Colonies now feels,  
and all of them are ſure of feeling, as far as the vengeance  
of Adminiſtration can inflit them, the complicated cala-  
mitics of fire, ſword and famine. We are reduced to the  
alternative of chuſing an unconditional ſubmiſſion to the  
tyranny of irritated Miniſters, or reſiſtance by force.  
The latter is our choice. We have counted the coſt of  
this conteſt, and find nothing fo dreadful as v  
ſlavery. Honour, juſtice and humanity, forbid us tamely  
to ſurrender that freedom which we received from our  
gallant anceſtors, and which our innocent poſterity have  
a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the inta-  
my and guilt of reſigning ſucceeding generations to that  
wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits them, if we baſely  
entail hereditary bondage upon them.  
  
Our cauſe is juſt; our union is perſect: our internal  
reſources are great, and if neceſſary, foreign aſſiſtance 1  
undoubtedly attain ble. We grateiully acknowledge, as  
ſignal inſtances of Divine favour towards us, that his Pro-  
vidence would not permit us to be called into this ſevere  
controverſy, until we were grown up to our preſent  
ttrength, had been previiully exerciied in warlike opera-  
tions, and poil. fled of the means of detending ouriclves.  
With h- arts fortified with theſe animating reflections, we  
moſt iulemnly before God and the world declare, that,  
exerting the utmoſt energy of thote powers which our  
  
beneficent Creator hath graciouſly beſtowed upon us,

abating firmneſs and perſevtrance, employ fer the  
ſervation ot our liberties, being with one mind refolved  
to die treemen rather than to hive ſlaves.  
  
Left this declaration ſhould diſquiet the minds of our  
friends and fellow ſubjeQs in any part of the empire, we  
aſſure them, that we mean not to diſſolve that union  
which has fo long and fo happily ſubſiſted between us,  
and which we fincercly wiſh to tee reſtored. Neceſſity  
has net yet driven us into that deſperate meaſure, or in-  
duced us to excite any cther nation to war  
them. Me have not raiſcd armics with ambitious de-  
ſigns of ſeparating from Great Pritzin, and «ſtabliſhing  
inde pendant ſtates, We fight nut for glory or for con-  
queſt. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable ſpeQacle  
of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without a  
imputation, or even ſuſpicion of offence. &quot;They  
of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no  
milder conditions than ſervitude or death.

With humble confidence in the mercies of the Supreme

f our exiitence intended  
a part of the human race to hold an ab-  
folute property in, and an unbounded  
power over others, marked out by his in-  
-finite goodnefs and wifdom, as the ob-  
jects of a legal domination, never right-  
fully refiftible, however fevere and op-  
preffive, the Inhabitants of thefe Colo-  
nies might at leaft require from the Par-  
liament of Great-Britain, fome evidence,  
that this dreadful authority over them  
has been granted tothat body. Buta  
reverence for our great Creator, princi-  
ples of humanity, and the dittates of  
common fenfe, muft convince all thofe  
who reflect upon the fubjed, that go-  
vernment was inftituted to promote the  
welfare of mankind, and ought to be ad-  
miniftered for the attainment of that  
end. The legiflature of Great-Britain,  
however ftimulated by an inordinate paf-  
fion for a .power not only unjuttifiable,  
but which they know to be peculiarly re-  
probated by the very conftitution of  
that kingdom, ard defpesate of fuccefs  
in any mode of conteft, where regard  
fhould be had to truth, law, or right,  
have at length, deferting thofe, at-  
tempted to effect their crucl and impolitic  
purpofe of enflaving thefe Colonies by vi-  
olence, and have thereby rendered it ne-  
ceflary for us to clofe with their lait ap-  
peal from Reafon to Arms.—Yet, how-  
ever blinded that aflembly may be, by  
their intemperate rage for unlimited do-  
mination,, fo to flight juflice and the opi-  
nion of mankind, we efteem ourfelves  
bound by obligations of refpeét to the  
reft of the warld, to make known the  
joftice of our caufe.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the i-  
fland of Great-Britain, left their native  
jand, to feek-on thefe thores a refidence  
for civil and religious freedom. At the  
expence of their blood, at the hazard of  
their fortunes, without the leat charge  
to the equntry from which they removed,

by unceafing labor and an unconquerablé  
{pirit, they effected fettlements in the  
diftant and inhofpitable wilds of Ameri  
ca, then filled with numerous and war.  
like nations of barbarians. —Societie’* op  
governments, vefted with perfeet legit.  
tures, were formed, under charters from  
the crown, and an harmonious inter.  
courte was eftablithed between the colo~  
nies and the kingdom from which  
derived their origin. The mutual bene-  
fits of this union became in a fhort tine  
fo extraordinary, as to excite aftonifhe  
ment. It is, univerfally confefled, that  
the amazing increafe of the wealth,  
ftrength and navigation of the realm, a  
rofe from this fource; and the miniter  
who fe wifcly and fuccefsfully diroéted  
the meafures of Great-Britain in the late  
war, publicly declared, that thefe colo  
nies enabled her to triumph over her ene  
mies.—Towards the conclufion of that  
war, it pleafed our fovereign to make a  
change in his counfels.—From that fatal  
moment, the affairs of the Britifh empi  
began to fall into confufion, and g:  
ly fliding from the fummit of glorious  
profperity to which they had been ade  
vanced by the virtues and abilities of ong  
man, are at length diftraéted by the  
convulfions, that now hake it to its  
deepett_ foundations. —The new mintiftry  
finding the brave foes of Britain, though  
frequently defeated, yet {till egntend  
ing, took up the unfortunate idea of  
granting them a hafty peace, and  
then fubduing her faithful friends,  
Thete devoted colonies were judged to  
be in fuch a ftate, as to prefent victories  
without bloodfhed, arid all the eafy emo-  
luments of ftatuteable plunder.—The  
uninterrupted tenor of their peaceable  
and refpeétful behaviour from the begin-  
ning of colonization, their dutiful,. zea  
lous and ufeful fervices during the wat,  
though fo recently and amply acknow-  
ledged in the moft honorable manner by  
his Majefty, by the late king, and by  
Parliament, could not fave them from  
the meditated innovations —Parliament  
was influenced to adopt the perpicious  
project, and afluming a new pert over  
them, have in the courfe of eleven years  
given fuch decifive fpecimens of the {pitt  
and confequences attending this powtts  
as to leave no doubt concerning the ef  
feéts of acquiefeence under it. They  
have undertaken to give and grant our  
money without our confent, though we  
have ever exercifed an exclufive right t  
difpofe of our own property 5 ane  
have been paffed for extending the hd  
  
didtion of courts of Admiralty oa ae  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Admiralty’ beyond their ancient limits :  
for depriving us of the accuftomed and  
ineftimable privilege of trial by jury in  
cafes affecting both life and property ;  
for fafpending the legiflature of one of  
the colonies; for interdiéting all com-  
merce of another; and for altering fun-  
damentally the form of government efta-  
blitied by charter, and fecured by acts  
of its own legiflature folemnly confirmed  
by the crown; for exempting the  
murderers” of colonifts from legal tri-  
al, and in effe&amp;t, from punifhment; for  
ereéting in a neighbouring province, ac-  
quired by the joint arms of Great -Britain  
and America, a defpotifm dangerous to  
our very exiftence; and for quartering  
foldiers upon the colonifts in time of pro-  
found peace. It has alfo been refolved  
in parliament, that colonifts, charged  
with committing certain offences, fhall  
be tranfported to England to be tried.  
  
But why fhould we enumerate our in-  
juries in detail? By one ftatute it is de-  
‘clared, that parliament can ‘* of right  
make laws to bind us 1N ALL CASEs  
‘WHATsorveR.” What is to defend us  
‘gaint fo enormous, fo unlimited a pow-  
tr? Not a fingle man of thofe who af-  
fume it, is chofen by us; or is fubjeét to  
our controul or influence: but on the  
contrary, they are all of them exempt  
from the operation of fuch laws, and an  
American revenue, if not diverted from  
the oftenfible purpofes for which it is  
raifed, would a¢tually lighten their own  
burdens in proportion, as they increafe  
ours. We faw the mifery to which fuch  
defpotifin would reduce us. We for ten  
years inceflantly and ineffectually beiieg-  
ed the Throne as fupplicants; we rea-  
foned, we remonftrated with parliament  
in the moft mild and decent language.  
But adminiftration fenfible that we  
thould regard thefe oppreffive meafures as  
  
men ought to do, fent over fleets and  
armies to enforce them. ‘The indigna-  
tion of the Americans was roufed it is  
true; but it was the indignation of a vir-  
tuous, loyal, and affeétionate people.  
  
A Congrefs of Delegates from the united  
  
colonies was affembled at Philadelphia,  
on the fifth day of laft September. We  
tefolved again to offer an humble and  
dutiful petition tothe King, and alfo  
addreffed our fellow fubjeéts of Great-  
Britain. We have purfued every tempe-

the ultimate ftep of the controverfy :  
But fubfequent events have thewn, how  
vain was this hope of finding moderation  
in our enemies.  
  
Several threatening expreffion againft

were told it was a decent one, that his

the troops proceeded in warlike array to  
the town of Concord, where they {t up-  
pon another party of the inhabitants of  
the fame province, killing teveral and  
wounding more; until compelled to re-  
treat by the country people fuddenly af-  
fembled to repel this cruel aggreilion.  
Hoftilities thus: commenced by the Bri-  
tifh troops, have been fince profecuted  
by them without regard to faith or repu-  
tation. Theinhabitants of Bofton being  
confined within that town by the Gene-  
ral their Governor, and having in order  
to procure their difsviffion, entered in-  
to a treaty with him, it was ftipulated  
that the faid inhabitants having depofit-  
ed their arms with their own magittrates,  
fhould have liberty to depart, taking  
with them their other effects. They ac-  
cordingly delivered up their arms, but in  
Open violation of honor, in defiance of  
the obligation of treaties, which even fa-  
vage nations efleem facred, the Gover-  
nor ordered the arms depofited as afore-  
faid, that they might be preferved for  
their owners, to be feized by a body of  
foldiers ; detained the greateft part of  
  
‘the inhabitants in the town, and com-  
  
peiled the few who were permitted to re-  
tire, to leave their moft valuable effeéis  
behind.  
  
By this perfidy, wives are feperated  
from their hufbands, children from their  
parents, the aged and the fick from their  
tclations and friends, who with to at-  
tend and comfort them ; and thofe who  
have been ufed to live in plenty, and e-  
wen elegance, are reduced to deplorable  
diftrefs.  
  
The General further emulating his  
minifterial matters, by a proclamation  
bearing date on the 12th day of June,  
after venting the grofleft falfehoods and  
calumnies againft the good people of  
thefe colonies, proceeds to * declare

number of houfes in other places; our  
thips and veffels are feized ; the neceflary.  
fupplics of provifions are seoeel  
and he is exerting his utmoit power to  
i pread deftruction and devettation around

We have received certain intelligence  
that General Carleton, the Governor of  
Canada, is inftigating the people of that  
province and the Indians to fall. upon  
us; and we have but too much reafon to  
apprehend, that fchemes have been  
formed to excite domeftic enemies ar  
gainft us. In brief a part of thefe colo  
nics now feels, and all of them are {ure  
of feeling, as far asthe vengeance of ad-  
miniftration can infli€t them, the come  
plicated calamities of fire, {word and fa  
mine.—We are reduced to the alterna  
tive of chofing an unconditional fubmif-  
fion to the tyranny of irritated minifters,  
or refiftance by force.—The latter is our  
choice.—We have counted the coft of  
this conteft, and find nothing fo dread-  
ful as voluntary flavery.--Honor, ju  
tice, and humanity forbid us tamely to  
furrender that freedom which we receiv-  
éd from our gallant anceftors, and which  
our innocent pofterity have a right to re-  
ceive from us. We cannot endure the  
infamy and guilt of refigning fucceeding  
generations to that wretchednefs which  
inevitably awaits them, if we bafely en-  
tail hereditary bondage upon them.  
  
Our canfe is juft. Our union is pet-  
feét. Our internal refources are great  
and if neceflary, foreign affiftance Is un-  
doubtedly attainable-—We gratefully  
acknowledge, as fignal inftances of the  
Divine favour towards us, thathis Pro-  
vidence would not permit us to be :  
inte this fevere controverfy, until we  
were grown up to our prefent feng  
had been previoufly exercifed in war ike  
operations, and poffeffed of the means of  
defending ourfelves.—With hearts forti-  
fied with thefe animating reflections, we  
moft foiemnly, before Gop and the .  
world declare, that, exerting the utm  
energy of thofe powers, which our bene-  
ficient Creator hath gracioufly hefhawed  
upon us, the arms we have been compe’  
led by our enemies to affume, we wilt

the minds of our friends and fellow fub-  
jedls in any part of the empire, we ailure  
them, that we mean not todiffolve that  
Voion which has fo long and fo happily  
fubfifted between us, and which we. fin-  
cerely with to fee reftored.—Neceflity has  
not yet driven us into that defperate  
meafure, or induced us to excite any o-  
ther nation to war againft them.—We  
have not raifed armies with ambitious  
deligns of feperating from Great-Britain,  
and eftablifhing independant itates.—We  
fight not for glory or for conqueft. We  
exhibit to mankind the remarkable fpec-  
tacie of a people attacked by unprovoked  
encmies, without any imputation, or e-  
ven fufpicion, of offence. They boat of  
their. privileges and civilization, and yet  
  
offer no milder conditions than fervi-  
tade or death.—  
  
In our own native land, in defence of  
the freedom that is our birthright, and  
which we ever enjoyed till the late viola-  
tion of it—for the proteétion of our pro~  
perty, acquired folcly by the honeft in-  
duftry of our fore-fathers and ourielyes,

The following is a Declaration by the  
Reprefentatives of the United Co-  
Jonies of North America, now met  
in General Congres at Philadelphia,  
fetting forth the Caufes and Neceffity  
of their taking up Arms.  
  
1 it was poffible for men, who exer-  
cife their reafon, to belicve that the  
  
Divine Author of our exiftence intend-  
  
ed a part of the human race to hold an  
  
abfolute property in, and an unbound-  
ed power over others, marked out by  
his infinite goodnefs and wifdom as  
the objeéts of a legal domination, ne-  
ver rightfuily refittible, however fevere  
and oppreflive, the inhabitants of thefe  
  
Colonies might at leaft require from  
  
the Pariiament of Great- Britain fome  
  
evidence, that this dreadful authority  
over them has been. granted to that  
body. But a reverence for our Great  
  
Creator, principles of humanity, and  
  
the digtates of common fenfe, muft con-  
  
“vince all thofe who refleét upon the  
  
fubje&amp;t, that government was initituted  
to promote the welfare of mankind,  
and ought to be adminiftered for the  
— of that end. The legifla-  
ure of Great Britain, however, flimu-  
lated by an inordinate paflion fora power  
not only unjuftifiable, but which they  
know to be peculiarly reprobated by the  
very conftitution of that kingdom, and  
defperate of fuccefs in any mode of  
conteft, where regard fhould be had to  
truth, law, or right, have, at length,  
defeiting thofe, attempted to affect  
their cruel and impolitic purpofe of en-  
flaving thefe Colonies by violence, and  
have thereby rendered it neceffary for  
us to clofe with their lait appeal from  
reafon to arms. Yet, however blinded  
that aflembly may be, by their intempe-  
rae rage for unlimited domination, fo  
to flignt juftice and the opinion of  
mankind, we eftcem ourfelves bound  
by obligations of reipeé to the reft of  
the world, to make known the juftice of  
our caule,  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the  
iland of Great-Britain, Jeft their na-  
tive land, to feek on thefe fhores a re-  
fidence for civil and religions freedom,  
At the expence of their lives, at the  
hazard of their fortunes, without the  
leatt charge to the country from which  
they removed, by unceafing labour, and  
an unconquerable ipirit, they eff. Ged  
  
fettlements in the diftant and inhofpi-  
table wilds of America, then filled  
with numerous and warlike nations of  
barbarians. Societies gr governments,  
velted with perfeét legiflature, were  
formed under charters from the crown,  
and an harmonious intercourfe was ef.  
tablifhed between the Colonies and the  
kingdom from which they derived their  
origin. The mutual benefits of this  
  
‘union became ina fhort time fo &lt;xtwa-  
  
ordinary, as to excite aftonifhment. It  
is. univeifally confefled, that the amaz-  
ing increale of the wealth, ftrength,  
and navigation’ of the realm, arofe  
from this fource ; and the minifter who  
fo wiftly and fuccefsfully dire&amp;ted the  
meafures of Great-Britai in the late  
war, publicly declared, that thefe Co-  
lonies enabled her to triumph over her  
enemies.— Towards the conclufion of  
that war, it pleafed our fovereign to  
make a change in his counfels.—From  
that fatal.moment the affairs of the Bri-  
tith Empire began to fall into confu-  
fion, and gradually fliding from the  
fummit of glorious profperity, towhica  
  
&#x27; they had been advanced by the virtues  
  
and abilities. of one man, are at length  
diftraéted by the convulfions that now  
fhake it to its deepeft foundations. The  
new miniftry finding the brave foes of  
Britain, though frequently defeated,  
yet Rill contending, took up the unfor-  
tunate idea of granting them a hafty  
peace, and of then ftibduing her faith-  
ful friends,  
  
Thefe devoted Colonies were judged  
to be in fuch a ftate, as to prefent vic-  
tories without bloodfhed, and all the  
eafy emoluments of ftatutable plunder,  
The uninterrupted tenor of their peace-  
able and refpe&amp;tful behaviour from the  
beginning. of colonization, their duti-  
ful, zealous, and ufcful fervices dur-  
ing the war, though fo recently and

dignation of the Americans was routed,  
it&#x27;s trye ; but it. was the indignation  
of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate  
people. A-Congrefs of De&#x27;egates from  
the United-Colonies was afvembled ar  
Ph ladelphia on the .gth day of Jaf

fhould fupplant our attachment to di.  
berty. This, we flattered ourfelves,  
was the ultimate ftep of the contro-  
verfy: but fubfequent events. have  
fhewn, how vain was this hope of  
finding moderation in our enemies,  
Several threatening expreflions againtt  
the Colonies were infected in his Ma-  
jefty’s Speech. Our petition, though  
we were told it was a decent one, that  
his Maje(ty had been pleafed to receive

encouraged by unlawful combinations

fought his Majefty that he would take  
the moft effeQual meafures to enforce  
due obedienceto the Jaws and autho-  
rity of the fupreme legiflature.”” Soon  
after, the commercial intercourfe of  
whole Colonies, with foreign countries  
and with each other, was cut off by an  
aét of Parliament; by another, feveral  
of them were intirely p:ohibited from  
the fitheries in the feas near their coatts,  
  
on which they always depended for ,  
  
their fuftenance; and large reinforces

‘detachmént of his army, who  
made an unprovoked affault on the tn-  
habitants of the faid province, at the  
town of Lexington, as appears by the  
affidavits of a great number of perfons,  
fone of whom were officers and fol-  
diers of that detachment, murdered  
éight of the inhabitants, and wounded  
many others. From thence the troops  
proceeded, in warlike array, to the  
town. of Concord, where they fet upon  
another party of the inHabitants of  
the fame province, killed ‘feveral, and  
wounded more, until compelled to  
retreat by the country-people, fuddenly  
affembled to repel this cruel aggreffion.  
Hoftilities thus commenced by the Bri-  
tith troops, have been fince profecuted  
by them, without regard to faith or  
reputation, The inhabitants of Bot-  
ton being confined within that: town,  
by the General their Governcr, and  
having, in order to procure their dif-  
miffion, entered into a treaty with him,  
it was ftipulated that ‘the faid inhabi-  
tants, having depofited their arms with  
their own magiftrates, fhonld have li-  
berty fo depart, taking with them their  
other effefls. They accordingly deli-  
vered up their arms; but in open vio-  
lation of honour, in defiance of the  
obligation of treaties, which even fa-  
vage nations efteem facred, the Gover-  
nor ordered the arms depofited as afore-  
faid, that they might be preferved for  
their owners, to be feized by a body of  
foldiers; detained the greateft part of  
the inhabitants in the town, and com-  
pelled the few who were permitted 16  
retire, to leave their molt valuabie ef-  
feé&amp;ts behind.  
  
By this pe. fidy wives are feparated  
from ‘their hufbands, children ftom  
their parents, the aged and fick fiom  
their relations and friends, who wifh to  
attend and comfort them; and thofe  
who have been ufed to live in plenty,  
  
and even elegance, ate reduced to de-  
plorable diftiefs.  
  
The General, further emulating his  
minifterial ‘mafters, by a proclamation,  
bearing date ‘on the s2th-day of June,  
after venting the grofleit faithodds and  
calumnies againit the good people of  
thefe Colonies, Bedcteds to ** decidre  
** them all, either by name or defcrip-  
‘tion, to be rebels and traitors, to  
‘* fuperfede the courfe of the common

the neceffary fupplies of provifions are

We have received certain intelligenct,.  
that General Carleton, Governor of  
Canada, is inftigating the people of  
that province and the Indians to fall  
upon us; and we have but too much  
reafon to apprehend, that fchemes have  
been formed to excite domeftic enemies  
againft us. In brief, a part of thefe  
Colonies now feels, and all of them  
are fure of feeling, as far as the ven-  
geance of Adminiftration ean infliét

fire, fwoid, and famine. We are ree

have ever exercifed an exclufive right to  
difpofe of our own property. Statutes  
have heen paffed for extending the jurifdic-  
tion of Courts of Admiralty and Vice Ad-  
miralty beyond their ancient limits, for de-  
priving us of the accuftomed and ineftima-  
ble privilege of trial by jury, in cafes affect-  
ing both life and property ; for fufpending  
the Legiflature of one of the Coionies ; for  
interdiéting all commerce of another ; and  
for altering fundamentally the form of go-  
vernment eftablifhed by charter, and fecu-  
red by aéts of its own Legiflature folemnly  
confirmed hy the Crown; for exempting  
the ¢ murderers’ of Colonifts from legal  
trial, and, in effe&amp;t, from punifhment ; for  
erecting in a neighbouring province, acqui-  
red by the joint arms of Great Britain and  
America, a defpotif dangerous to our  
very exiftence ; and for quartering foldiers  
upon the Colonifts in time of profound  
peace. It has alfo been refolved in Parlia-  
ment, that Colonifts, charged with commit-  
ting certain offences, fhall be tranfported to  
England to be tried.  
  
But why thould we enumerate our inju-  
ries in detail ? By one ftatute it is declared,  
that Parliament can ‘ of right make laws  
to bind us in all cafes whatever.” What is  
to defend us againit fo enormous, fo unlimi-  
ted a power? Not a fingle man of thofe  
who affume it is chofen by us, or is fub-  
je&amp; to our controul or influence: But, on  
the contrary, they are all of them exempt  
from the operatien of fuch laws, and an  
American revenue, if not diverted from the  
oftenfible purpofes for which it is raifed,  
would aétually lighten their own burdens,  
in proportion as they increafe ours. We  
faw the mifery to which fuch defpotifm  
would reduce us. We for ten years in-  
ceflantly and ineffcétually befieged the  
Throne as fupplicants ; we reafoned, we re-  
monftrated with Parliament in the mott  
mild and decent language. But Admini-  
ftration, fenfible that we fhould regard  
thefe oppreffive meafures as freemen ought  
to do, fent over fleets and armies to inforce  
them. ‘The indignation of the Americans  
was rouled, it is true; but it was the in-  
  
dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affeftion-  
ate people. A Congrefs of Delegates from  
the United Colonies was aflembled at Phi-  
ladelphia, on the sth day of laft September.  
We refolved again to offer an humble and  
dutiful petition to the King, and alfo ad-  
dreffed our fellow- fubjeéts of Great Britain.  
We have purfued every temperate, every  
refpe€tful meafure ; we have even proceeded  
to break off our commercial intercourfe  
with our fellow fubjeéts, as the lait peace-  
able admonition, that our attachment to na  
nation upon earth would fupplant our at-  
tachment to liberty. ‘This we flatter our-  
felves was the ultimate ftep of the contro-  
verfy : But fubfequent events have fhewn  
how vain was this hope of finding modera-  
tion 1n our enemies.  
  
Several threatening expreffions againft  
the Colonies were inferted in his Majefty’s  
fpeech. Our petition, though we were told  
it was a decent one, that his Majefty had  
been pleafed to receive it gracioufly, and to  
promife laying it before his Parliament,  
was huddled into both Houfes amongtt a  
bundle of American papers, and there neg-  
lef&amp;ted. The Lords and Commons, in  
their addrefs, in the month of February,  
faid, ‘that a rebellion at that time aétu-  
ally exifted within the province of Maffa-  
chufett’s-bay ; and that thofe concerned in  
it had been countenanced and encouraged  
by unlawful combinations and engage-  
ments, entered into by his Majefty’s fub-  
jects in feveral of the other Colonies ; and  
therefore they befought his Majetty that he  
would take the molt effe&amp;tual meafures to  
inforce due obedience to the Jaws and au-  
thority of the fupreme Legiflature.&quot; Soon  
after the commercial intercourfe of whole  
Colonies, with foreign countries and with  
each other, was cut off by an Aé&amp;t of Parlia-  
ment ; by another, feveral of them were in-  
tirely prohibited from the fifheries in the  
feas near their coafts, on which they always  
depended for their fuftenance ; and large  
re-inforcements of fhips and troops were  
immediately fent over to General Gage.  
  
Fruitlefs were all the intreaties, argu-  
ments and eloquence of an illuftrious band,  
of the moft diftinguifhed Peers and Com-  
moners, who nobly and ftrenuoufly afferted  
the juftice of our caufe, to ftay or even to  
mitigate the heedlefs fury with which thefe  
accumulated and unexampled outrages  
were hurried on. Equally fruitlefs was  
the inteference of the city of London, of  
Briftol, and many other refpeétable towns,  
in our favour. Parliament adopted an  
infidious manceuvre, calculated to divide

us, to eftablith a perpetual auétion of tax-  
ations, where Colony fhould bid againft  
Colony, all of them uninformed what ran-  
fom fhould redeem their lives; and thus to  
extort from us at the point of the bayonet  
the unknown fums that fhould be fufficient  
to gratify, if poffible to gratify, Minilterial  
rapacity, with the miferable indulgence left  
to us of railing in our own mode the pre-  
feribed tribute. What terms more rigid  
and humiliating could have been diétated  
by remorfelefs Viétors to conquered ene-  
mies? In our circumstances, to accept them  
would be to deferve them.  
  
Soon after the intelligence of thele pro-  
eeedings arrived on this continent, General  
Gage, who, in the courfe of the Jaft year,  
had taken poffeffion of the town of Bofton,  
in the province of Maflachufett’s. bay, and  
ftill occupied it as a garrifon, on the 19th  
day of April fent out from that place a  
Jarge detachment of his army, who made  
an unprovoked affault on the inhabitants  
of the faid province, at the town of Lex-  
ington, as appears by the affidavits of a great  
number of perfons, fome of whom were Ofi-  
cers and foldiers of that detachment; mur-  
dered eight of the inhabitants, and woun-  
ded many others. From thence the troops  
proceeded in warlike array to the town of  
Concord, where they fet upon another party  
of the inhabitants of the fame province,  
killing feveral and wounding more, until  
compelled to retreat by the country- people  
fuddenly affembled to repel this cruel ag-  
greflion. Hottilities, thus commenced by  
the Britifh troops, have been {ince profecu-  
ted by them without regard to faith or re-  
putation. The inhabitants of Bofton be-  
sng confined within tliat town by the Gene-  
yal, their Governor ; and having, in order  
to procure their difmiffion, entered into a  
treaty with him ; it was ftipulated that the  
faid inhabitants, having depofited their  
arms with their own Magiftrates, thould  
have liberty to depart, taking with them  
their other effects. They accordingly deli-  
vered up their arms; but, in open viola-  
tion of honour, in defiance of the obligation  
of treaties, which even favage nations  
efteem facred, the Governor ordered the  
arms depofited as aforefaid, that they might  
be preferved for their owners, to be feized  
by a body of foldiers ; detained the greateft  
part of the inhabitants in the town, and  
compelled the few, who were permitted to  
retire, to leave their moit valuable effects  
behind.  
  
By this perfidy wives are feparated from  
their hufbands, children from their parents,  
  
q .  
  
the aged and fick from their relations and  
friends, who with to attend and comfort  
them ; and thofe who have been ufed to  
live in plenty, and even elegance, are re=  
duced to deplorable diftrefs.  
  
The General, further emulating his Mi-  
nifterial Mafters, by a Proclamation bearing  
date on the 12th day of June, after vent-  
ing the grofleft falfehoods and calumnies  
againft the good people of thefe Colonies,  
proceeds to * declare them all, either by  
name or defcription, to be Rebels and  
Traitors, to fuperfede the courfe of the com-  
mon Jaw, and inftead thereof to publith  
and order the ufe and exercife of the law  
martial.’—His troops have butchered our  
countrymen ; have wantonly burnt Charles-  
town, befides a confiderable number of  
houfes in other places; our fhips and vef-  
fels are feized; the neceflary fupplies of  
provifions are intercepted; and he is ex  
erting his utmoft power to fpread deftruc-  
tion and devaftation around him.  
  
We have received certain intelligence,  
that General Carleton, the Governor of Ca-  
nada, is inftigating the people of that pro-  
vince and the Indians to fall upon us; and  
we have but too much reafon to appre-  
hend, that {chemes have been formed to  
excite domeltic enemies againft us. In  
brief, a part of thefé Colonies: now feels,  
and all of them are fure of feeling, as far as  
the vengeance of Adminiftration can infli&amp;t  
them, the complicated calamities of fire,  
fword, and famine. We are reduced, to  
the alternative of chufing an unconditional  
fubmitfion to the tyranny of irritated Mi-  
nitters, or refiftance by force. The latter  
is our choice. We have counted the coft  
of this conteft, and find nothing fo dread-  
ful as voluntary flavery. Honour, juf-  
tice, and humanity forbid us tamely to  
furrender that freedom which we received  
from our gallant anceftors, and which our  
innocent pofterity have a right to receive  
from us. We cannot endure the infamy  
and guilt of refigning fucceeding genera-

A DECLARATION by the REPRESENTATIVES of the UNITED  
COLONIES of NORTH AMERICA, now met in GENERAL CON.  
GRESS at PHILADELPHIA, fering forth the CAUSES and NECEs-  
  
SITY of their taking up ARMS,  
|’ it was pofiible for men who exercife their  
reafon to believe that the Divine Author of  
our exifience intended a part of the hyman  
race to hold an abfolute property in, and an un-  
bounded power over others, marked out by his  
infinite gooinefs and wifdom, as the objects of  
a legal domination, never rightfully refiftible,  
however fevere and oppreflive ; the inhabitants  
of thefe Colonies might at Jeaft require from  
the Parliament of Great-Britain fome evidence,  
that this dreadful authority over them bas beca  
granted to that bedy. Buta reverence for our  
Great Creator, principles of humanity. and the  
diétates of common-fenfe, muft convince all  
thofe who reflect upon the fubjed, that Go-  
Yerament was inftituted to promote the welfare  
of mankind, and ought to be adminifiered for  
the attainment of thatend. The Legillature  
of Great-Britain, however, ftimulated by an in-  
jinate pafiion for a power not only unjuftifi-  
ich they know to be peculiarly re-  
probated by the very conftitution of that king-  
dom, and defperate of fuccels in any mode of  
conteft, where regard fhoula be had to truth,  
Jaw, or .right, have at length, deferting thofe,  
attemped to effect their cruel and impolitic  
purpoie of enflaving thefe Colonies by violence,  
and have thereby rendered it neceflary for us to  
clofe with their lait appea} from_sealon to arms.

able, buts  
  
—Yet, however blinded that Ailembly may  
be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited do-  
tnination, fo to flight juftice and the opinion of  
mankind, we efteem ourfelves bound by obli-  
gations of refpect to the reft of the world, to  
wake known the juflice of our caufs,  
  
Our Forefathers, inhabitants of the ifland of  
Great-Britain, left their native land to feek on  
thefe thores a refidence for civil and religious  
freedom, At the expence of their blood, at the  
hazard of their fortunes, without the leaft charge  
to the country from which they removed, by  
unceafing labour, and an unconquerable fpirit,  
they effected fettlements in the diftant and in-  
hofpitable wilds of America, then filled with  
numerous and warlike nations of Barbarians.  
Societies or Governments, vefted with perfect  
Legiflatures, were formed under charters from  
the Crown, and an harmonious intercourfe was  
eftablifhed between the Colonies and the King-  
dom from which they derived their origin, The  
mutual benefits of this union became in a fhort  
time fo extraordinary, as to excite aftonithment.  
It is univerfally confefled, that the amazing in-  
creale of the wealth, ftrength, and navigation  
of the geaim, arofe from this fource 3; and the  
Minifter who fo wifely and fuccefsfully dire&amp;t-  
ed the meafures of Great-Britain in the late  
war, publicly declared, that thefe Colonies en-  
abled her to triumph over her enemies, —To-  
wards the conclufion of that war it pleafed our  
Sovereign to make a change in his Counfels,—  
From this fatal moment the affairs of the Britith  
Empire began to fall into confufion, and gradu.  
aliy fliding from the fummit of glorious pro-  
{perity, to which they had been advanced by  
the virtues and abilities of one man, are at  
Jength diftraéled by the convulfions that now  
fhake it toits deepef foundations. The new  
Miniftry finding the brave foes of Britain,  
though frequently defeated, yet fill contend-  
  
ing,  
  
  
  
  
  
424  
  
ing, took up the unfortunate ides of granting  
them a hafty peace, and of then fubduing her  
faithful friends.  
  
Thefe devoted Colonies were judged to be in  
fuch a ftate, as to prefent victories withovt  
bloodthed, and all the ealy emoluments of fla-  
tuteable plunder, The uninterrupted tenor of  
their peaceable and refpe€ful behaviour from  
the beginning of Colonization, their dutiful,  
zealous, and ufeful fervices during the war,  
though fo recently and amply acknowledged in  
the moft honourable manner by his Majefty,  
by the lite King, and by Parhatnent, could  
not fave them from the meditated innovations,  
Parliament was influenced to adopt the perni-  
cious project, and afluming a new power over  
them, have in the courfe of eleven vears given  
fuch decifive fpecimens of the {pirit and confe-  
quences attencing this power, as to leave no  
doubt concerning the eife@ts of acquiefcence  
uncer it. They have undertaken to give and  
grant our money v ithout our confent, though  
we have ever exercifed an exclufive right to  
difpofe of our own property. Statutes have  
been paffed for extending the jurifdiétion of  
Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty be-  
yond their antient limits; for depriving us of  
the accuftomed and ineftimable privilege of trial  
by Jory, in cafes affecting both life and pro-  
perty ; for fufpending the Legiflature of one of  
the Colonies; for interdicting all commérce of  
another; and for altering tundamentally the  
form of Government, eftablifhed by charter,  
and fecured by aéts of its own Legiflature fo-  
Jemnly confirmed by the Crown ; for exempt-  
ing the * Murderers” of Colonifts from legal  
trial, and in effect from punifhment ; forerect-  
ing ina neighbouring Province, acquired by the  
joint arms of Great-Britain and America, a de-  
{potifm dangerous to our very exiftence; and  
for quartering foldiers upon the Colonifts in time  
of profound peace. It has alfo been reiolved  
in Parliamest, that Colonifts charged with  
committing certain offences, fhall be tran{port-  
ed to England to be tried.  
  
But why fhoukd we enumerate our injuries  
in detail ? By one Statute it is declared, that  
Parliament can “ of right make laws to bind  
usin all cafes whatfoever.”” What is to defend  
us againft fo enormous, fo unlimited a power ?  
Not a fingie man of thofe who affume it, is  
chofen by us, or is fubject to our controul or  
influence: but, on the contrary, they are all  
of them exempt from the operation of fuch  
laws ; end an American revenue, if not divert  
ed from the oftenfible pur pofes for which it is  
raifed, would a¢tually lighten their own bur-  
dens in proportion as they increafe ours, We  
faw the mifery to which iuch defpotifm would  
reduce us. We for ten years tnceflantly and  
ineff-ctually befieged the Throne as fupplicants 5  
we reafoned, we remonftrated with Parliament  
in the moft mild and decent language. But  
Adminiftration, fenfible that we fhould regard  
thefe oppreffive meafures 2s Freemen ought to  
do, fent over fisets and araiies to enforce them,  
  
Caufes and Neceffity of the Americans taking up Arms explained.  
  
The indignation of the Americans was roufed,  
it is true; but :t was the indignation of a vir-  
tuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A Con-  
grefs of Delegates trom the United Colonies  
was aflembled at Philadelphia, en the cth day  
of laft September. We refolved again to offer  
an humble and dutiful Petition to the King,  
and allo addrefied our fellow-fubjeéts of Greare  
Britain. We have purfued every temperate,  
every refpeétful meafure; we have even pio-  
ceeded to break off our commercial intercourfe  
with our fellow-fubjects, as the !aft peaceable  
admonition, that our attachment to no nation  
upon earth fhould fupplant our attachment to  
liberty. This, we flatter our telves, was the  
ultimate ftep of the comroverfy: But fubfe-  
quent events have fhewn, how vain was this  
hope of fincing moderation in our enemie ,  
  
Several threatening expreflions againft the  
Colonies were inferted in his Majefly’s Speech.  
Our Petition, though we were told it  
decent one, that his Majefty had been pleafed  
to receive it gracioufly, and to promile Jaying  
it before his Parliament, was huddled into both  
Houfes amongft a bundle of American papers,  
and there neglected, The Lords and Commons,  
in their Addrefs, in the month of February,  
faid, that * a Rebellion at that time attually  
exified within the Province of Maffachufetts-  
Bay ; and that thofe concerned in it had been  
countenanced and encouraged by unlawful com-  
binations and engagemen&#x27;s entered into by his  
Maijefty’s fubjects tn feveral of the other Co-  
lonies ; therefore they befought his Ma-  
jefty that he would takethe moft effectual  
meatures to enforce due obedience to the laws  
and authority of the Supreme Legifleture.’?  
Soon after the commercial ‘intercourfe of  
whole Colonies, with foreicn countries and  
with each other, was cut off by an A&amp; of Par-  
liament 5; by another, feveral of them were  
intirely prohibited from the fitheries in the  
feas near their coafts, on which they always  
depended for their fuftenance ; and large rein-  
forcements of thips and troops were imunedi-  
ately fent over to General Gage.  
  
Fruitlefs were all the entreaties, arguments  
and eloquence of an illuffrious band of the  
moft diftinguifhed Peers and Commoners, who  
nobly and ttrenuoufly afferted the juftice of our  
caufe, to ftav or even to mitigate the-heediefs  
fury with which thefe accumulated and un-  
exampled outrages were hurried on. Equa&#x27;ly  
fruitlefs was the interference of the City of  
London, of Briftol, and many other refpect-  
2ble towns, in our favour, Parliament adopt-  
ed an infidious mancuvre, calculated to di-  
vide us, to eftablifh a perpetual auétion of tax-  
ations, where Colony fhould bid againft Colo-

nce of thefe proceed-  
ings arrived on this Continent, General Cage,  
who in the courie of the laft year had taken  
poileffion of the Town of Bofton, in the Pro-  
vince of Maffachuietts- Bay, ar ill occupied  
it as a garrifon, on the sgth day or April tent  
out from that place a large detachment of his  
army, who made an unprovoked affault upon  
the inhabitants of the fatd Province, at the  
town of Lexington, as appears by the affida-  
vits of a great number of perfons, fome of  
whom were Officers and foldiers of that de-  
tachment, murdered eight oi the inhabitants,  
and wounded many others, From thence the  
troops proceeded im warlike array to (he town  
of Concord, where they fet upon another party  
of the inhabitants, of the fame Province, kill-  
ing feveral and wounding more, untii compe led  
to retreat by the country people tuddenly eiiem-  
bled.to repel this cruel aggreffion, Hodfiilities  
thus commenced by the Britith troops, have  
been fince profecuted by them without regard to  
faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Bofton  
being confined within that town by the General  
their Governor, and having in order to pro-  
cure their difmiffion entered into a treaty with  
him, it was ftipuiated that the faid inhabitants,  
having depofited their arms with their own  
Magittrates, fhouid have liberty to depart,  
taking with them their other efiects, ‘They  
accordingly delivered up their erms ; but in  
open violation of honour, in defiance of the  
obligation of treaties, which even favage na-  
tions efteem facred, the Governor ordered the  
arms depofited as aforefaid, that they might  
be preferved for their owners, to be {cized by  
a body of foldiers; detained the greateft part  
of the inhabitants in the town ; and compelled  
the few who were permitted to retire, to leave  
their moft valuable effects behind.  
  
By this perfidy wives are feparated from their  
hufbands, children from their parents, the aged  
and the fick from their relations and triends,  
who with to attend and comfort them; and  
thofe who have been ufed to live in plenty, and  
even elegance, are reduced \o deplorable diftrefs,  
  
The General, further emulating his Minitfic-  
rial mafters, by a Proclamation, bearing date  
on the 12th day of June, after venting the  
grofie falfehoods and calumnies aga nft the  
good people of thefe Colonies, proceeds to “ de-  
clare them all, either by name or éefeription,  
to be Rebels and Traitors, to fuperfede the  
courfe of the common law, and infiead thereof  
to publifh and order the ufe and exercife of the  
Law Martial.’&quot;—His troops have butchered  
our countrymen; have wantonly burnt Charles-  
Town, befides a confiderable number of houies  
in other places; our thips and veileis are feized ;  
the neceffary fupplies of provifions sre inter-  
cepted, and he is exerting his utmoft power to  
fpread deftruction and devaftation around him,  
  
Caufes and Neceffity of the Americans taking up Arms explained. 435  
  
We have received certain intelligence, that  
General Carleton, the Governor ot Canada, is  
inftigating the people of that Province and the  
Indians to fall upon us; an@ we have but too  
much reafon to apprehend, that f{chemes have  
been formed to excite domeftic enemies againft  
us. In brief, a part of thefe Colonies now  
feels, and al! of them are fure of feeling, as  
tar as the vengeance of «dminiitration can  
in Gi them, the complicated calamities of fire,  
{word and famine. We are reduced to the  
alternative of chufing unconditional fub-  
miffion to the tyranny of irritated Minifters,  
or refiftance by force The latter is our choice.  
We have counted the c ‘ of this conteft, and  
find nothing fo dreadful as voluntary flavery,  
Honour, juftice, and humanity, forbid us tame-  
ly to durrender ti at freedom which we received  
from our gallant Anceflor’ and which our  
innocent puferity have a rigat to receive from  
us, We ce inot endure the infamy and guilt of  
refigning fucceeding generations to that wretch-

part of the human race to hold an abfo*

infinite goodnefs and wifdom as the ob¬

might at Icaft require from the parlia¬

ycrnmtnt was indituted to promote the

end. The legiflature of Great Britain,  
however, dimulated by an inordinate  
padiua for a pow’cr not only unjudidable,  
but which they know to be peculiarly  
reprobated by the very conditution of  
that kingdom, and defperate of fuccefa

of mankind, oue edeem ourfklves bound  
by obligations of tefpeft to the reft of  
the world, to make known the juftice of  
our caufe.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the if*  
land of Great Britain, left their nati^  
land, to feck on thefe Ihorcs a refidcnce  
for ervil and religious freedom. At the  
expence of their blood, at the hazard of  
their fortunes, without the Icaft charge  
to the&#x27;country from which they remo¬  
ved; by unceadng labour and an uncnii-  
querable fpirif, they effeded fettlements  
in the diftant and inhofpitable wilds of  
America, then filled with numerous and  
warlike nations of barbarians.—&#x27;Societies  
or governments, vefted with perfect If  
gidatures, were formed under charter#  
from the crown, and an harmonious in-  
tercourfe was eftablifhcd between the  
colonies and the kingdom from which  
they derived their origin. The mutual  
benefits of this union became in a Ibort  
time fo extraordinary, as to excite afto-  
nifhment. It is univerfally confefled,  
that the amazing iocreafe of the wealth;  
ftrength, and navigation of the realm, a-  
rofe from this fource; and the minifter  
who fo wifely and fuccefsfully dire^cd  
the meafures of Great Britain in the Utc  
war, publicly declared, that thefe colo¬  
nies enabled her to triumph over her c-  
ncmies.—Towards the conclufion of  
that war, it plcafed our fovcrcign to make  
a change in bis counfels.—From that fa¬  
tal moment, the affairs of the Britifh  
empire began to fall into confufiop, and  
gradually Aiding from the fummit of  
glorious profperity to which they had  
been advanced by the virtues and abili¬  
ties of one man, are at length diftrafted  
by the convulfion^ that now (liake it to  
its deepeft foundations.^-Thc new mi-  
niftry finding the brave foes of Britain,  
though frequently defeated, yet ftill con¬  
tending, took up the unfortunate idea of  
panting them a hafty peace, and of then  
I&#x27;ubduing her faithful friends.  
  
Thefe devoted colonies were judged  
to be in fuch a ftate, as to prefent victo¬  
ries without bloodihed, and all the cafy  
emoluments of ftatuieablc depredation.  
—The uninterrupted tenor of their  
peaceable and refpeCtful behaviour from

HISTORY.  
  
i  
  
fineA we reinon(!rated with parliament in the  
moft rmld and decent Unguajire. But admini-  
(h^ation, ienlible that we fhould regard thclc  
opprcflivc mcafurcs as free men ought to do,  
ient over fleets and armies to inforco them.  
The indignation of the An&gt;ericans wasroufed,  
it it true ; but it was the indignation of a vlr-  
tuoir?, loyaty and alfrOionate people. A con-  
grtfs of delegates from the united colonics was  
afrembled at l*hi1^e)phia, on the 5th day of  
laft December. We rcfolTed again to offer an  
bomble and dutiful petition to the King, and  
alfo addrcficd our fcllow-fuhje^ls of Great  
Britain. We haTc p^fued evrr&gt;’ temperate, c-  
rery refpeftful mcafure; we have even pro¬  
ceeded to bicak off cur commercial inteicourfc  
with our fellow-rub}e 05 , as peaceable  
  
adnioniiion, that our attachment to no nation  
upon eartli ihooid fupplant our attachment to  
’ liberty. This, we flattered oit^fclvcs, was the  
ultimate ftep of the controverfy; but fui fe-  
&lt;^cnt events have (hewn, how vain was this  
hope of finding moderation in out enemies.  
  
* Fruitlefs were all the intreaties, arguments,  
and eloquence of an illuOrious banil of the  
moll dillrnguiihcd peers and commoners, who  
nobly and flrenuouf^ aflerted the jwlVicc of  
our caufe, to flay, or even to mitigate the  
hcedlcfs fury with which thefc accumulated  
• and unexampled out^ejes were hurried on.—  
. Equally fruitlefs was the interference of the  
aty of London, of Briflol, and many other  
refreftable towns m our fatour. Pariiament  
adopted an inJiJious manoeuvre, calculated to  
divide m, to eOablilK a perpetual auffion of  
taxations where colony (hould bid againfl co¬  
lony, all of them uninformed what ranfom  
ihould red^m their lives, and thus to extort  
from iiV, at the point of the bayonet, the un-  
.known fyms that (hould be fuflicient to grati¬  
fy, if pojfihle to gratify, miniltcrial rapacity,  
with the miferable indulgence left to us of  
railing in our own mode the preferibed tribute*  
What terms more rigid and humtiiating o&gt;uld  
have been dictated by remorfelefs vigors to  
conquered enemies ? In our circumfiances, to  
accept them would be to dcfcrve them.  
  
‘ Soon after the intelligence of ihefe pro¬  
ceedings arrived on this continent, General  
Gage, w ho, in the courle of the lad year, had  
taken poflefTion «&#x27;f the town of Buflon in the  
provin^&#x27;C « f M. fl&#x27;^cf&#x27;ufeti’s Bay, and Hill oc¬  
cupied it as a garntun, on the 19th day of  
April, fent out from that place a large de¬  
tachment of his artny, who made an ur.pro^  
•vaked affault on the inhabitants of the laid  
yjrovincc, at the town of Lexing’^on, as ap*  
pears by the affidavits of a great number of  
perfbns, feme of whom were officers and fol-  
dicrs of that detachment, murdered eight of  
the inhabitants, and wounded many others.  
From thence the troops proceeded in warlike  
&#x27;array to the town of CoDCor(l&gt; vrkcrc they fc(  
  
upon another party of the inhabitants of M  
fame province, killing icveral, and wounding  
more, until compelled to retreat by the coun¬  
try people iiiddcnly affemblcd to repel this  
cruel aggrefErn, Hoftilities thus commenced  
by the Britifh troops, have been fince profe-  
cuicJ by them, without regard to faith or re-  
putation .— The inhabitants of Bollon being  
confiiicd within that town by the general their  
governor, and having, in order to procure  
their difiniflion, entered into a treaty with  
him, it was (lipulated, that the faid inhabi-  
lants, having depcfited their arms with their  
own magiflrates, (Lould have liberty to de¬  
part, taking with them their own cflefls.  
They accordingly delivered up their arms ;  
but, ia open violation of in defiance  
  
of the obligation of treaties, which even fa-  
vage nations efleem facred, the governor or¬  
dered the arms depofited as aforefaid, that  
they might be prclcrved for their owners, to*  
be feiaed by a body of Idldicrs, detained the  
greateil part of the Inhabitants in the town,  
and compelled the few who were pcrrrritted  
to retire, to leave their mod valuable effedts  
behind.  
  
‘ rhegeneral further emulating his minide-  
ridl mailers, by a proclamation, bearing date  
on tlie 12th day of June, after venting the  
groded faljeheodr and carumnies agdiuft the  
good people of ihofe colonies, proceeds to  
‘ declare them all, c^hcr by name or deferip-  
  
* tion, to be rebels and traitors, to ruperlcde  
‘ the courfe of the common law; and, in-  
  
* llead thereof, to publifh,&#x27; and order the ule  
of the law martial.&#x27; His troops have hUi^  
  
chered our countrymen ; have wantonly burnt  
Charles-town, brfiics a confiderable number  
of houfes in other places; our (hips and vef-  
fcls arc feized ; tbe necedary fupplies of pro-  
vidons ate Intercepted, and he is exerting his  
■utmod power to fpread dedru^tion &#x27;and de-  
vadatioo around him.

A DECLARATION,  
BY THE  
Reprefentatives of the United Colonies  
of NoRTH-AMERICA,  
  
Now met in General Congres at Philadelphia,  
Setting forth the Caufes and Neceflity of  
their taking up Arms,  
  
F it was poffible for men, who exercife  
their reafon, to believe, that the divine  
Author of our exiftence intended a part of  
the human race to hold an abfolute property  
in, and an unbounded power over others,  
marked out by his infinite goodnefs and wif-  
dom, as the objeéts of a legal domination,  
never rightly refiftable, however fevere and  
oppreffive, the inhabitants of thefe colonies  
might at leaft require from the Parliament  
of Great-Britain, fome evidence, that this  
dreadful authority over them has been grant-  
ed to that body. But a reverence for our  
great Creator, principles of humanity, and  
the diétates of common fenfe, muft convince  
all thofe who refie&amp; upon the fubjeé, that  
government was inftituted to promote the  
welfare of mankind, and ought to be admi-  
niftered for the attainment of that end, 7 he  
legiflature of Great Britain, however, ftimu-  
lated by an inordinate paffion for a power  
not only unjuttifiable, but which they know  
to be peculiarly reprobated by the very con-  
ftitution of that kingdom, and defperate .  
fuccefs in any mode of conteft, where regar  
fhould be had to truth, law, or right, we

ying thefe colonies by violence, and have  
thereby rendered it neceffary for us to clofe  
with their laft appeal from reaton to aris,  
Yet, however blinded that affembly may be,  
by their intemperate rage for unlimitted do-  
mination, fo to flight juftice and theopinicn  
of mankind, we efteem ourfelves bound by  
oblizations of refpeét to the ret of the world,  
to make known the juitice of our caufe,  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the ifland  
of Great-Britain, left their native land, to  
feek on thefe fhores a refidence for civil and  
religious freedom, At the expence of their  
blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, with-  
out the leaft charge to the country from  
which they removed, by unceafing labour,  
and an unconqnerable fpirit, they effected  
fettlements in the diftant and inhofpitable  
wilds of America, then filled with numerous  
and warlike nations of barbarians, Socie-  
ties or governments, vefted with perfec le-  
giflatures, were formed under charters from  
the crown, and an harmonious intercourfe  
was eftablifhed between the colonies and the  
kingdom from which they derived their ori-  
gin, The mutual benefits of this union be-  
came ina fhort time fo extraordinary as to  
excite aftonifhment, Itis univerfally con-  
feffed, thatthe amazing increafe of the wealth,  
ftrength, and navigation of the realm, arofe  
from this fource; and the minifter who fo  
wifely and fuccefsfuily direfted the meafurcs  
of Great Britain in the late war, pubiicly  
declared, that thefe colonies enabled her to  
triumph over her enemies, Tewards the con-  
clufion of that war it pleafed our fovereign  
tomake a change in his counfel, From that  
fatal moment, the affairs of the Britifh em-  
pire began to fall into confution, and gradu-  
ally fliding from the fummit of glorious prof-  
perity to which they had been advanced, by  
the virtues and abilities of one man, are at  
length diftra&amp;ted by convulfions, that now  
fhake it to its deepeft foundations, The new  
miniftry finding the brave foes of Britain,  
though frequently defeated, yet ftill contend-  
ing, took up the unfortunate idea of grant-  
ing them an hafty peace, and of then fubdu-  
ing her faithful friends,  
  
Thefe devoted colonies were judged to be  
infuch a ftate as to prefent victories without  
bloodfhed, and all the eafy emoluments of  
ftatuteable plunder, The uninrerrupted te-  
nor of their peaceatle and refpeétful behavi-  
our from the beginning of colonization, their  
dutiful, zealous and ufefulfervices during the  
war, though fo recently and amply acknow-  
ledged in the moft honourable manner by  
his Majefty, by the late King, and by  
ament, could not fave them from the medi-  
tated innovations, Parliament was influ-  
enced to adopt the pernicious projeét; and

common fenfe, muft convince all thofe  
who reflect upon the fubject, that go-  
vernment was imftituted to promote the  
welfare of mankind, and ought to be  
adminiftered for the attainment of that  
end, The legiflature of Great- Britain,  
however, ftimulated by an inordinate  
affion for a power not only unjuftifiable,  
but which they know to be peculiarly  
reprobated by the very conftitution of  
that kingdom, and defperate of fuccefs  
in any mode of conteit, where regard  
fhould be had to truth, law, or right,  
have, at length, deferting thofe, at-  
tempted to affect their cruel and impoli-  
tic purpofe of enflaving thefe Colonies  
by violence, and have thereby rendered  
it neceflary for us to clofe with their laft  
appeal trom reafon to arms. Yet, how-  
ever blinded that aflembly may be, by  
their intemperate rage for unlimited do-  
mination, fo to flight juftice and the  
opinion of mankind, we cfteem ourfelves  
bound, by obligations of refpect to the  
reft of the world, to make known the  
juflice of our caufe.  
  
‘© Our forefathers, inhabitants of the  
ifland of Great-Britain, left their native  
Jand, to feek on thefe fhores a refidence  
for civil and religious freedom, At the  
expence of their lives, at the hazard of  
their fortunes, without the leaft charge  
to the country from which they removed,  
by uncealing labour, and an unconquer-  
able fpirit, they effected fettlements in  
the diftant and inhofpitable wilds of  
America, then filled with numerous and  
warlike nations of barbarians. Societies  
or governments, vetted with perfect le-  
giflature, were formed under charters  
from the crown, and an harmonious in-  
¢ercourte was eftablifhed between the Co-  
lonies and the kingdom trom which they  
derived their origin. ‘The mutual bene-  
hts of this union became in a fhort time  
fo extraordinary, as to excite aftonifh -  
ment. It is univerfally confetled, that  
the amazing increafe of the wealth,  
flrereth, and navigation of the realm,  
arofe from this fource; and the minifter  
who to wifely and fuccefsfully directed  
the meafures of Great-Britain in the late  
war, publicly declared, that thefe Colo-  
nies enabled her to triumph over her  
enemies.— Lowards  
that war, it pleafed our fovereign to  
make a change in his countels.—from  
that fatal moment the affairs of the Brn.

for depriving us of the accuflomed and  
ineftimable privilege of trial by jury, in

mild and decent language: but Admi-

thefe oppreilive meafures as freemen  
ought to do, fent over fleets and armies  
to enforce them, The indignation of the  
Americans was roufed, it is true; but it  
was the indignation of a virtuous, loyal,  
and affectionate people. A Congrefs of  
Delegates from the United Colonies was  
aflembied at Philadelphia on the sth day  
of lait September. We refolved again  
to offer an humbie and dutiful petition  
to the King, and alfo addreffed our fel-  
low fubjetts of Great-Britain. We have  
purfued every temperate, every re{pect-  
tul meafure ; we have even proceeded to  
break off our commercial intercourfe with  
our fellow-fubjects, as the laft peaceable  
admonition, that our attachment to no  
nation upon earth fhould fupplant our  
attachment to liberty. ‘This, we flatter-  
ed ourfelves, was the ultimate fiep of  
the controverfy: but fubfequent events  
have fhewn, how vain was this hope in  
finding moderation in our enemies.  
  
* Several threatening exprefflions a-

we were told it was a decent one, that

from the fifheries in the feas near their  
coatts, on which they always depended  
for their fuftenance ; and large reinforce-  
ments of fhips and troops were immedi-  
ately fent over to General Gage.  
  
‘¢ Fruitlefs were all the entreaties,  
arguments, and eloquence, of an illuf-  
trious band of the moft diftinguifhed  
Peers and Commoners, who nobly and  
firenuoufly aflerted the juftice of our  
caufe, to flay or even to mitigate the  
heedlefs fury with which thefe accumu-  
lated and unexampled outrages were hur-  
ried on, Equally fruitlefs was the inter-  
ference of the city of London, of Briftol,  
and many other refpectable towns, in  
our favour. Parliament adopted an in-  
fidious manoeuvre, caiculated to divide

fhould be fufficient to gratify, if pofhible  
to vratify, minifterial rapacity, with the  
milerable indulgence left to us of raifing  
in our own mode the preferibed tribute.  
What terms more rigid and humihating  
could have been dictated by remorfelets  
victors to conquered enemies? In our  
circumitances, to accept them would be  
to. deferve them,  
  
‘&lt; Soon alter the intelligence of thefe  
proceedings arrived on this continent,  
General Gage, who, in the courfe of  
the laft year, bad taken pofleffion of the  
town of Boiton, in the province of Maf-  
fachufet’s Bay, and {till occupied it as a  
garriion, on the rgth day of April fent  
out irom that place a large detachment  
of his army, who made an unprovoked  
affault on the inhabitants of the faid  
province, at the town of Lexington, as  
appears by the allidavits of a great num-  
ber of perfons, fome of whom were offi-  
cers and foldiers of that detachment,  
murdered eight of the inhabitants, and  
wounded many others. From thence the  
troops proceeded, in warlike array, to

upon another party of the inhabitants  
ot the fame province, killed feveral, and  
wounded more, until compelled to re-  
treat by the country people, fuddenly  
alfembled to repel this cruel aggreffion,

tended a part of the human race to hold an 1bfolute pro-  
perty in, and an unbounded power over others, marked  
out by his infinite goodneſs and wiſdom as ihe objects of  
a legal domination, never rightfully reſiſtible, however.  
ſevere and oppreſſive; the inhabitants of theſe Colonies  
might at leaſt require from the Parliament of Great Bri-  
tain ſome evidence, that this dreadful authority over  
them has been granted to that body. But a reverence  
for our Great Creator, principles of humanity, and the  
dictates of common ſenſe, muit convince all thoſe who  
reflect upon the ſubject, that Government was inſtitut-

- Nature cf Great Britain, however, ſtimulated by an in-  
ordinate paſſion for a power not only unjuſtifiable, but  
which they know to be . peculiarly reprobated by the  
very contiitution of that Kingdom, and deſperate of ſuc-  
ceſs in any mode of centeit, where regard ſhould be had  
to truth, law, or right, have at length, deſerting thoſe,  
attempted to effect tneir cruel and impolitic purpoſe of  
enſlaving theſe Colonies by violence, and have thereb  
rendered it neceſſary for us to cloſe with their laſt ap-  
peal from reaſon to arms. --Vet, however blinded that  
Aſlembly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimit-  
ed domination, fo to flight juſtice and the opinion of  
mankind, we eſteem ourſelves bound by obligations of  
reſpect to the reſt of the world, to make known the juſtice  
of our cauſe,  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland 6f Great  
Britain, left their native land, to ſeek on theſe ſhores a  
reſidence for civil and religious freedom. At the ex-  
pence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes,  
without the leaſt charge to the country from which they  
removed, by unceaſing labour, and an unconquerable  
ſpirit, they effected ſettlements in the diſtant and inhoſ-  
pitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous  
and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or go—  
vernments, veſted with perfg&amp; legiſlatures, were formed  
under Charters from the Crown, and an harmonious in-  
tercourle was eſtabliſned between the Colonies and the  
Kingdom from which they derived their origin. The  
mutual benefits of this un on became in a thort time  
ſo extraordinary, as to excite altoniſhment, It is uni-  
verſally confefled, that the amazing increaſe of the  
wealth, ſtrength, and navigation of the realm aroſe  
from this ſource; and the Miniſter who ſo wiſely  
and fucceſsfully directed the meaſures of Great Bri-  
tain in the late war, publickly declared, that theſe  
Colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies.“  
--- l owards the concluſion of that war it pleaſed our  
Sovereign to make a change in his Councils.---From  
that fatal moment the affairs of the Britiſh Empire be-  
gan to fall into confuſion, and gradually ſliding from

been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man,  
are at length diſtracted by the convu! [tions that nov ſhake  
it to its deepeſt foundation. Ihe new Miniltry finding  
the brave Rs of Britain, though frequently defeated.  
yet ſtill contending, took up the unfortunate idea of  
  
oranting them a haity peace, and of then ſubduing her  
taithful triends,  
  
Theſe devoted Colonies were judged to be in ſuch a  
Nate, as to preſent victories without bloodſhed, and all  
the eaſy emoluments of ſtatuteable plunder. &quot;The un-  
interrupted tenor of their peaceable and reſpectful be-  
haviour from the beginning of Colonization, their du-  
tiful, zealous, and uſeful ſervices during the war, tho&#x27;  
ſo recently and amply acknowledged in the moſt ho-

them, have, in the courſe of eleven years, given ſuch  
deciſive ſpecimens of the ſpirit and conſequences attend=

peration of ſuch laws ; and an American  
revenue, if not diverted from the oſtenſible purpoſes for  
which it is raiſed, would actually lighten their own  
burdens in proportion as they increaſe ours. We ſaw  
the miſery to which ſuch deſpotiſm would reduce us.  
We for ten years inceſſantly and ineffeQually beſieged  
the Throne as ſupplicants ; we reaſoned, we remonſtrated  
with Parliament in the molt mild and decent language,  
But Adminiſtration, ſenſible that we ſhould regard theſe  
oppreſſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, ſent over  
fleets and armies to enforce them, The indignation of  
the Americans was rouled, it is true; but it was the in-  
dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people.  
A Congreſs of Delegates from the United Colonies was  
aſſembled at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of laſt Septem-  
ber. We reſolved again to offer an humble and duti—  
ful Petition to the King, and alſo addreſſed our fel-  
low- ſubjects of Great-Britain, We have purſued every  
temperate, every reſpectful meaſure; we have even pro-  
ceeded to break off our commercial intercourſe with  
our fellow- ſubjects, as the laſt peaceable admonition,  
that our attachment to no nation upon earth ſhould ſup-  
plant our attachment to liberty, This we flattered our-  
ſelves was the ultimate ſtep of the controverſy ; but the  
ſubſequent events have ſhewn, how vain is this hope of  
finding moderation in our enemies. |  
  
Several threatening expreſſions againſt the Colonies  
were inſerted in his Majeſty&#x27;s Speech. Our Petition,  
though ws were told it was a decent one, that his Ma-  
jeſty had been pleaſed to receive it graciouſly, and ta  
promiſe laying it before his Parliament, was huddled in-  
  
| ta

to both Houſes amongſt a bundle of American papers,  
and there negiected, The Lords and Commons in their  
Addicts, in tue month of February, ſaid, &quot;That © a re-  
bellion at that time actually exiſted within the Province  
of Maſlachuſet&#x27;s Bay; and that thoſe concerned in it had  
been countenanced anc encouraged by unlawful combi-  
nations and engagements, entered into by his Majeſty&#x27;s  
ſubjects in ſeveral of the other Colonies; and therefore  
they beſought his Majeſty, that he would take the mot  
eff tual nicaſures to enforce due obedience to the} laws  
and authority of the dupreme Legiſlature.” Soon after  
the commerc1al intercourſe of whole Colonies, with fo-  
reian cou tries, and with each other, was cut off by an Act  
of Parliam it ; by another, ſeveral of them were entirely  
proh bd from the fiſheries in the ſeas near their coaſts,  
on wich ney always depended for their ſuſtenance ;  
and large reinforcements of ſhips and troops were im-  
metiatcly ienc over to General Gage.  
  
Fruitleſs were all the entreaties, arguments and elo-  
quence of an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhed  
Fe-rs and Commoners, who nobly and ſtrenuouſly aſſerted  
the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay or even to mitigate the  
hee cſs fury with which theſe accumulated and unexam-  
pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitleſs was the  
interference of the City of London, of Briſtol, and many  
other reſpectable towns, in our favour, Parliament  
adopted an infidious manœuvre, calculated to divide us,  
to eſtabliſh a perpetual auction of taxations, where Colon  
ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of them uninformed what  
ranſom ſhould redeem their lives, and thus to extort from  
us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown ſums that  
ſhould be ſufficient to gratiiy, if poſſible to gratify, Mi-  
niſterial rapacity, with the miſerable indulgence left to  
us of raiſing in our own mode the preſcribed tribute.  
What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been  
dictated by remorſeleſs victors to conquered enemies? In  
  
our Circumſtances, to accept them would be to deſerve  
  
Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceedings arrived  
on this Continent, General Gage, who in the courſe of  
8 5 &quot;  
  
11  
  
  
in the province of Maljachuſet&#x27;s-Bay, and ſtill occupied  
it as a garriſon, on the 19th day of April ſent out from  
that place a large detachment of his army, who made an  
unprovoked aflault on the inhabitants of the ſaid pr=vince,  
at the town of Lexington, as appears by the afidavits of  
a great number of perſons, ſome of whom were officers  
and ſoldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the  
inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence  
the troops proceeced in warlike array to the town of  
Concord, where they ſet upon another party of the in-  
habitants of the ſame Province, killing ſeveral, and  
wounded more, unti] compelled to retreat by the coun-  
try people ſuddenly aſſembled to repel this cruel aggreſ-  
ſion. Hoſtilities thus commenced by the Britiſh troops,  
have been ſince proſecuted by them without regard to  
faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Boſton being  
confined within that town by the General their Gover-  
nor, and having in order to procure their diſmiſſion en-  
tered into a treaty with him, it was ſtipulated that the  
ſaid inhabitants, having depoſited their arms with their  
own Magiſtrates, ſhould have liberty to depart, taking  
with them their other effects. They accordingly deli-  
vered up their arms; but in open violation of honour,  
in deftance of the obligation of treaties, which even ſa-  
vage nations eſteem ſacred, the Governor ordered the  
arms depoſited as aforeſaid, that they might be preſerved  
  
  
tained the greateſt part of the inhabitants in the town,  
and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to  
leave their moſt valuable effects behind, |  
  
By this perfidy wives are ſeparated from their huſbands,  
children from their parents, the aged and ſick from their  
relations and friends, who with to attend and comfort  
them; and thoſe who have been uſed to live in plenty,  
and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable diſtreſs.

to * declare them all, either by name or deſcription, to  
be rebels and traitors, to ſuperſede the courſe of the  
common law, and inſtead thereof to publiſh and order the  
uſe and exerciſe of the law martial.“ His troops have  
butchered our countrymen ; have wantonly burnt Charles  
Town, beſides a conſiderable number of houſes in other  
places; our ſhips and veſlels are ſeized ; the neceſſary  
ſupplies of proviſions are intercepted, and he is exerting  
his utmoſt power to ſpread deitruction and devaſtation  
around-him,  
  
We have received certain intelligence, that General  
  
  
people of that Province and the Indians to fall upon us;  
and we have but too much reaſon to apprehend, that  
ſchemes have been formed to excite domeſtic enemies  
againſt us. In brief, a part of theſe Colonies now feels,  
and all of them are ſure of feeling, as faras the vengeance  
of Adminiſtration can inflict them, the complicated cala-  
mities of fire, ſword and famine. We are reduced to the  
alternative of chuſing an unconditional ſubmiſſion to the  
  
tyranny of irritated Miniſters, or reſiſtance by force.  
  
  
this conteſt, and find nothing fo dreadful as voluntary  
ſlavery, Honour, juſtice and humanity, forbid us tamely  
to ſurrender that freedom which we received from our  
gallant anceſtors, and which our innocent poſterity have  
a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infa-  
my and guilt of reſigning ſucceeding generations to that  
wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits them, if we baſel  
  
entail hereditary bondage upon them, |  
  
Our cauſe is juſt : our union is perfect: our internal  
  
reſources are great, and if neceſſary, foreign aſſiſtance is  
undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as  
ſignal inſtances of Divine favour towards us, that his Pro-  
vidence wauld not permit us to be called into this ſevere  
controverſy, until we were grown up to our preſent  
ſtrength, had been previouſly exerciſed in warlike opera-  
tions, and poſſeſſed of the means of defending ourſelves.  
With hearts fortified with theſe animating refleions, we  
molt ſolemnly before God and the world declare, that,  
exerting the utmoſt energy of thoſe powers which our  
bencficent Creator hath graciouſly beſtowed upon us,

allure them, that we mean not to diflo&#x27;ve that union  
which has ſo long and ſo happily ſubſiſted between us,  
and which we iincerely with to ſee reſtored. Neceſſity  
has not yet driven us into that deſperate meaſure, or in-  
duced us to excite any other nation to war againſt  
them. We have not raiſed armies with ambitious de-  
ſigns of ſeparating from Great Britain, and eſtabliſhing  
independant ſtates. We fight not for glory or for con-  
queſt, We exhibit to mankind the remarkable ſpectacle  
of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any  
imputation, or even ſuſpicion of offence. They boaſt  
of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no  
milder conditions than ſervitude or death,  
  
In our own native land, in defence of the free—  
dom that 1s our birthright, and which we ever en-  
joyed till the late violation of it; for the protection of  
our property, acquired ſolely by the honeſt induſtry of our  
forefathers and ourſelves, againſt violence actually offer-  
ed, we have taken up arms, We ſhall lay them down  
when hoſtilities ſhall ceaſe on the part of the aggreſſors,  
and all danger of their being renewed ſhall be removed,  
—and not before.  
  
With an humble confidence in the mere ies of the Supreme  
and Impartial Judge and Ruler of the Univerſe, we moſt  
devoutly implore his divine goodneſs to conduct us hap-

BY THE

OF THE  
  
UNITED COLONIES ox NORTH AMERICA,  
NOW MET IN  
  
GENERAL CONGRESS AT PHILADELPHIA,  
  
SETTING FORTH

it was poſſible for men who exerciſe their reaſon to belicre,  
that the Divine Author of our exiſtence intended a part of the  
&#x27;-haman race to hold an abtolute property in, and an unbounded pow-  
er over others, marked out by his infinite goodneſs and wiſdom as  
the objects of a legal domination, never rightfully reſiſtible, how-  
ever ſevere and oppreſſive; the inhabitants of thefe Colonies might  
at leaſt require from the Parliament of Great Britaiu ſome evi-  
dence, that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to  
that badly. But a reverence for our great Creator, principles of  
humanity, and the dictates of common ſenſe, muſt convince all  
| thoſe who reflect upon the ſubject. that Government was inſtituted  
to promote the welfare of mankiad, and ought to be adminiſtered  
for the attainment of that end. The | cgiflature of Great Britain,  
however, ſtimulated by an inordinate paſſion for a power not only  
unjuſtifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by  
the very conſtitution of that Kingdom, and defperate of ſucceſs in  
any mode of conteſt, where regard ſhould be had to truth. law, or  
right, have at length, deſerting thoſe, attempted to eſſect their  
cruel and impolitic purpoſe of enſlaving theſe Colonies by violence,  
and have thereby rendered it neceſſary tor us to cloſe with their laſt  
appeal from reaton to arms. Vet, however blinded that Aſſem-  
bly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimited domination,  
&amp; to ſlight juſtice, * of mankind, we eſteem our-  
  
J 70 J  
ſelves bound by obligations of reſpect to the reſt of the world, ts  
make known the juitice of our cauſe.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland of Great Britain, left  
their native land, to feck on theſe ſhores a reſidence for civil  
religious freedom. At the expence of their blood, at the hazard  
of their fortunes, without the leaſt charge to the country from  
which they removed, by unccaſing labour, and an unconq  
ſoirit, they eſſected ſettlements in the diſtant and inhoſpitable  
wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike nations  
of barbarians. Societies or governments, veſted with perſect le.  
giſlatures, were formed under Charters from the Crown, and an  
harmonious intercourſe was eſtablithed between the Colonies and  
the kingdom from which they derived their origin The mutual  
benefits of this union became in a ſhort time ſo extraordinary, ag  
to excite aftonithment. It is univerſally confeſſed, that the amaz.  
ing increaſe of the wealth, ſtrength, and navigation of the realm  
aroſe from this ſource; and the Miniſter who fo wiſely and fuccefs.  
fully direcled the meatures of Great Britain in the late war, pu-  
blicly declared, that theſe Colonies. enabled her to triumph over  
her encmics.—-Towards the concluſion of that war it pleaſed our  
Sovereign to make a change in his Councils. From that fatal mo-  
ment the affairs of the Britith Empire began to fall into confuſion,  
and gradually ſliding from the ſummit of glorious proſperity, to  
which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one  
man, are at length diſtracted by the couvultions that now ſhake it  
to its deepeſt foundation. The new Miniſtry finding the brave  
focs of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet ſtill contending,  
took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a haſty peace, and  
of then tubdluing her faithful friends.  
  
Thoſe devoted Colonies were judged to be in ſuch a ſtate, as ts  
preſent victo ies without bloodſhed, and all the caty emo&#x27;uments of  
ſtatut cable plunder. The uninterrupted tenor of their peaceable  
and retpectful behaviour from the beginning of Colonization, their  
dutifu!, zcalous, an4 uieful ſervices during the war, though re»

them from the meditratcd innovations. Parliament was influenced  
  
  
them, have, in the courſe of cleven years, given ſuch deciſive ſpe»  
  
  
leave no doubt concerning the effects of acquieſcence under it.  
They bave undertaken to give and grant our money without our  
conſent, though we have ever exerciſed an excluſive right to dif  
poſe of our own property. Statutes have been paſſed for extending  
the juriſdiction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty be-  
yond their antient limits, for depriving us of the accuſtomed and

for interdicting all commerce of another; and for a&#x27;tering funda-  
mentally the form of government, eſtabliſhed by charter, and ie-  
cured by Acts of its own Legillature fol:mnly confirmed by the  
crown; for exempting the Murderers“ of Coloniſts * legal

douring Province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain and  
America, a detpotiſm dangerous to our very exiftence; and for  
quertering ſoldiers upon the Coloniſls in time of protound peace.  
It has alto been refolved in Parkament, that Colonitts charged  
with committing certain offences, thall be tranſported to England  
  
be tricd. &#x27;  
  
wo why ſhould we — our injuries in detail? By one  
Statute it is declared, that Parliament can of right make laws to  
« hind us in all caſes whatſoever.” What is to defend us againſt fo  
enormous, fo unlimited a power? Not a fingle man of thoſe who  
aſſume it. is choſen by us, or is ſubje&amp; to our controul or influence;  
but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt from the opera-  
tion of ſuch laws; and an American revenue, if not diverted from the  
eltenſible purpoſes for which it is raiſed, would actually lighten their  
own burdens in proportion as they increaſe ours. We ſaw the mi-  
ſery to which ſuch deſpotiim would reduce us. We for ten years  
inceffantly and ineſſectually beficged the Throne as tupplicants; we  
reaſoned, we remonſtrated with Parliament in the moſt mild and  
decent language. But Adminiſtration, ſenſible that we thould regard  
theſe oppreſſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, fent over fleets  
and armies to enforce them. The indignation of the Americans  
was rouſed, it is true, but it was the indignation of a virtuovs, loy-  
al, and affeftionate people. A Congreſs of Delegates from the U-  
nited Colonies was aſſembled at Philadelphia, on the fifth day of  
laſt September. We reſolved again to offer an humble and dutiful  
petition to the King, and alio addre ſſed our fellow-fubjects of Great  
Britain. We have purſucd every temperate, every reſpectful mea-  
fure; we have even proceeded to break off uur commercial intercourte  
with our fellou- ſubjects, as the laſt peacenble admonition, that our  
attachment to no nation upon earth ſhould tupplant our attachment  
to liberty, This we flattercd ourſelves was the ultimate ſtep of the  
controverſy; but the fubſequent events have ſhown, how vain is  
this hope of finding moderation in our enemics.  
  
Several threatening expreſſions againſt the Colonies were inſerted  
in his Majeſty&#x27;s Specch. Our Petition, though we were told it was  
a decent one, that his Majeſty had been plcaſed to receive it gra-  
cioully, and to promite laying it before his Parliament, was huddled  
into both Houſes amongſt a bundle of American papers, and there  
neglefed. The Lords and Commons in their Addreſs, in the monthof  
  
12  
  
CL. 2  
  
February, faid, That a Rebellion at that time actually exiſted with.  
in the Province of Maſſachuſets-Bay; and that thoſe concerned init  
had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations  
and engagements, entered into by his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects in ſeveral of  
the other Colonies; and therefore they beſought his Majeſty, that  
he would take the moſt etfeftual meaſures to entorce due  
to the laws and authority of the Supreme Legiſtature.” Soon after  
the commercial intercourſe of whole Colonics, with foreign coun.  
tries, and with each other, was cut off by an Act of Parli  
by another, ſeveral of them were entircly prohibited from the fiſh.  
eries in the ſeas near their coaſts, on which they always depended  
for their ſuſtenance; and large reinforcements of ſhips and troogs  
were immediately ſent over to General Gage.  
  
Fruit leſs were all the entreaties, arguments and eloquence of an  
Uluſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhed Peers and Commonem  
who nobly and ftrenuouſly afferted the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay  
or even to mitigate the heedleſs fury with which theſe accumulated  
and uncxampled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitleſs was  
the interference of the City of London, of Briſtol, and many other  
reſpectable towns, in our favous, Parliament adopted an infidiou  
manoeuvre, calculated to divide us, to eitabliſſi a perpetual auction  
of taxations, where Colony ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of them  
  
informed what ranſom ſhould redeem their lives, and thus to  
extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown ſums  
  
Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceedings arrived on this  
Continent, General Gage, who in the courſe of the laſt year had  
taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſton, in the province of Maſh-  
chuſcts-Bay, and till occupied it as a garriſon, on the nineteenth  
day of April ſent out from that place a large detachment of his  
army, who made an unprovoked aſſault on the inhabitants of  
the faid province, at the town of Lexington, as appears by the  
afhdavits of a great number of perſons, ſome of whom were officers  
and foldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants,  
and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in  
warlike array to the town of Concord, where they ſet upon another

Boſton being confined within that town by the General their Go-  
vernor,, and having, in order to procure their diſmiſſion, entered  
into a treaty with him, it was ſtipulated that the faid inbabitants,  
having depoſited their arms with their own magiſtrates, ſhould,  
have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects.  
accordingly delivered up their arms; but, in open violation of ho-  
nour, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even favage  
nations citeem facred, the Governor ordered the arms depoſited as  
aforeſaid, that they might be preſerved for their owners, to be ſeized  
by a body of ſoldiers; detained the greateſt part of the inhabitants  
in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire,  
to leave their moſt valuable eſſects behind.

will, in defiance of every hazard, w:th unabating firmneſs and per.

Neceſſity has not yet driven us into that deſperate meature, or indu»

But why ſhould we enumerate our injuries in detail?  
By one Statute it is declared, that Parliament can © of  
$ right. make Jaws to bind us in all cafes whatſoever.”  
What is to defend us againſt ſo enormous, ſo unlimited  
a power? Not a ſingle man of thoſe who aſſume it,  
is Choſen by us, or is ſubject to our controul or influ-  
ence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt  
from the operation of ſuch laws; and an American reve-  
nue, if not diverted from the aſtenſible purpoſes for  
which it is raiſed, would actually lighten their own bur-  
dens in proportion as they increaſe ours. We ſaw the  
miſery to which ſuch deſpotiſm would reduce us. We  
for ten yeags inceſſantly and ineffectually beſieged the  
Throne as ſupplicants; we reaſoned, we remonſtrated  
with Parliament in the moſt mild and decent language.  
But Adminiſtration, ſenſible that we ſhould regard theſe  
oppreſſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, ſent over  
fleets and armies to enforce them, The indignation of  
the Americans was rouſed, it is true; but it was the in-  
dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people.  
A Congreſs of Delegates from the United Colonies was  
aſſembled at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of laſt Septem-  
ber, We reſolved again to offer an humble and dutiful  
Petition to the King, and alſo addreſſed our fellow-ſub-  
jects of Great-Britain, We have purſued every tempe-  
rate, every reſpectful meaſure ; we have even proceeded  
to break off our commercial intercourſe with our fellow-  
ſubjects, as the laſt peaceable admonition, that our attach-  
ment to no nation upon earth ſhould ſupplant our at-  
  
  
the ultimate ſtep of the controverſy ; but the ſubſequent  
events have ſhewn, how vain is this hope of finding mo-  
deration in our enemies.  
  
Several threatening expreſſions againſt the Colonies  
were inſerted in his Majeſty&#x27;s Speech. Our Petition,  
though we were told it was a decent one, that his  
Majeſty had been pleaſed to receive it graciouſly, and  
to promiſe laying it before his Parliament, was huddled  
into both Houſes amongſt a bundle of American papers,  
and there neglected, The Lords and Commons in their  
Addreſs, in the month of February, ſaid, That © a re-  
t bellion at that time actually exiſted within the Pro-

ce vi of Maſſachuſet&#x27;s Bay ;, and that thoſe con-  
cerned in it had been countenanced and encouraged  
by unlawful combinations and engagements, entered  
into by his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects in ſeveral of the other  
&lt;« Colonies; and therefore they beſought his Majeſty,  
that he would take the moſt effectual meaſures to en-  
force due obedience to the Jaws and authority of the  
„ Supreme Legiſlature.” Soon after the commercial  
intercourſe of whole Colonies, with foreign countries,  
and with each other, was cut off by an Act of Parlia-  
ment; by another, ſeveral of them were entirely prohi-  
bited from the fiſheries in the ſeas near their coaſts,  
on which they always depended for their ſuſtenance ;  
and large reinforcements of ſhips and troops were im-  
mediately ſent over to General Gage. SS:  
  
Fruitleſs were all the entreaties, arguments and elo-  
quence of an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhed  
Peers and Commoners, who nobly and ſtrenuouſly aſſerted  
the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay or even to mitigate the  
heedleſs fury with which theſe accumulated and unex-  
ampled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitleſs was  
the interference of the City of London, of Briſtol, and  
many other reſpectable towns, in our favour.  Parlia-  
ment adopted an infidious manceuvre, calculated to di-  
vide us, to eſtabliſh a perpetual auction of taxations, where  
Colony ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of them uninform-  
ed what ranſom ſhould redeem their lives; and thus to  
extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the un-  
known ſums that ſhould be ſufficient to gratify, if poſſi-  
ple to gratify, Miniſterial rapacity, with the miſerable  
indulgence left to us of raiſing in our own mode the  
preſcribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humili-  
ating could have been dictated by remorſeleſs victors to  
conquered enemies? In our circumitances, to accept  
them would be to deſerve them.  
  
Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceedings arrived  
on this Continent, General Gage, who in the courſe of  
the Jaſt year had taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſton,  
in the province of Maſiachuſer&#x27;s-Bay, and ftill occupied  
it as a garriſon, on the 19th day of April ſent out from  
that place a large detachment of his army, who made an  
  
Ef unprovoked  
  
  
I 268}  
  
unprovoked aſſault on the inhabitants of the ſaid province,  
at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of  
a great number of perſons, ſome of whom were officers  
and ſoldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the  
inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence  
the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of  
  
  
bitants of the ſame Province, killing ſeveral, and wound-  
ing more, until compelled to retreat by the country  
  
  
been ſince proſecuted by them without regard to faith  
or reputation. The inhabitants of Boſton being con-  
  
  
and having in order to procure their diſmiſſion entered  
  
  
inhabitants, having depoſited their arms with their own  
Magiſtrates, ſhould have liberty to depart, taking with  
them their other effects. They accordingly delivered  
up their arms ; but in open violation of honour, in de-  
fiance of the obligation of treaties, which even ſavage  
nations eſteem ſacred, the Governor ordered the arms  
depoſited as aforeſaid, that they might be preſerved for  
their owners, to be ſeized by a body of ſoldiers ; de-  
tained the greateſt part of the inhabitants in the town,  
  
  
By this perfidy wives are ſeparated from their huſ-  
bands, children from their parents, the aged and ſick  
  
  
and comfort them; and thoſe who have been uſed to live  
in plenty, and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable  
diſtreſs. ;  
  
The General, further emulating his Miniſterial maſ-  
ters, by a proclamation, bearing date on the 12th day  
of June, after venting the groſſeſt falſehoods and calum-  
nies againſt the good people of theſe Colonies, proceeds  
to declare them all, either by name or deſcription,  
c to be rebels and traitors, to ſuperſede the courſe of  
« the common law, and inſtead thereof to publiſh and  
« order the uſe and exerciſe of the law martial.” His  
  
troops  
  
{ 109 ]  
  
troops have butchered our countrymen ; have wantonly  
burnt Charles T&#x27;own, beſides a conſiderable number of  
houſes in other places; our ſhips and veſſels are ſeized ;  
the neceſſary ſupplies of proviſions are intercepted, and he  
is exerting his utmoſt power to&#x27; ſpread deſtruction and  
deyaſtation around him.  
  
We have received certain intelligence, that General  
Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is inſtigating the  
people of that Province and the Indians to fall upbn us;  
and we have but too much reaſon to apprehend, that  
ſchemes have been formed to excite domeſtic enemies  
againſt us. In brief, a part of theſe Colonies now feels,  
and all of them are ſute of feeling, as far as the vengeance  
of Adminiſtration can inflict them, the complicated cala-  
mities of fire, ſword and famine. We are reduced to the  
alternative of chuſing an unconditional ſubmiſſion to the  
tyranny of irritated Miniſters, or reſiſtance by force.  
  
he latter is our choice, We have counted the coſt  
of this conteſt, and find nothing fo dreadful as volun-  
tary ſlavery. Honour, juſtice and humanity, forbid us  
tamely to ſurrender that freedom. which we received  
from our gallant anceſtors, and which our innocent  
poſterity have a right to receive from us. We cannot  
endure the infamy and guilt of reſigning ſucceeding  
generations to that wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits  
them, if we baſely entail hereditary bondage upon them.  
  
Our cauſe is juſt : our union is perfect: our internal  
reſources are great, and if neceſſary, foreign aſſiſtance  
is undoubtedly attainable, We gratefully acknowledge,  
as ſignal inſtances of Divine favour towards us, that his  
Providence would not permit us to be called into this ſe-  
vere controverſy, until we were grown up to ow  
preſent ſtrength, had been previouſly exerciſed in warlike  
operations, and poſſeſſed of the means of defending our-  
ſelves. With hearts fortified with theſe animating reflec-  
tions, we moſt ſolemnly before God and the world de-  
clare, that, exerting the utmoſt energy of thoſe powers  
which our beneficent Creator hath graciouſly beſtowed  
upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our ene-  
mies to aſſume, we will, in defiance of every hazard,

preſervation of our liberties, being with one mind reſolved

friends and fellow- ſubjects in any part of the empire, we  
aſſure them, that we mean not to diſſolve that union  
which has ſo long and ſo happily ſubſiſted between us,  
  
and which we ſincerely wiſh to ſee reſtored, Neceſſity  
| has not yet driven us into that deſperate meaſure, or in-  
duced us to excite any other nation to war againſt  
them. We have not raiſed armies with ambitious deſigns  
of ſeparating from Great Britain, and eſtabliſhing in-  
dependent ſtates. We fight not for glory or for con-  
queſt,

A  
DECLARATION  
BL FRY  
FEPRESENTATIVTS  
  
OF THE  
  
UNITED COLONIES or NORTH AMERICA,  
  
NOW MET IN  
GENERAL CONGRESS ar PHILADELPHIA,  
  
SETTING FORTH  
  
Tux CAUSES and NECESSITY or THEIR TAKING UP ARMS.  
  
F it was poflible for men who exerciſe their reaſon to  
believe, that the Divine Author of our exiſtence in-  
tended a part of the human race to hold an abfolute pro-  
perty in, and an unbounded power over others, marked  
out by his infinite goodneſs and wiſdom as the objects of  
a legal domination, never rightfully refiſtible, however  
ſevere and oppreſſive ; the inhabitants of thefe Colonies  
might at leaſt require from the Parliament of Great Bri-  
tain ſome evidence, that this dreadful authority over  
them has been granted to that body. But a reverence  
for our Great 8 principles of humanity, and the  
dictates of common ſenſe, muſt convince all thoſe who  
reflect upon the ſubject, that Government was inſtitut-  
ed to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be  
  
; N adminiſtered  
  
1  
adminiſtered for the attainment of that end. The Legi-  
ſlature of Great Britain, however, ſtimulated by an in-  
ordinate paſſion for a power not only unjuſtifiable, but  
which they know to be peculia:ly reprobated by the  
very conſtitution of that Kingdom, and deſperate of ſuc-  
ceſs in any mode of conteſt, where regard ſhould be had  
to truth, law, or right, have at length, deſerting thoſe,  
attempted to etfect their crue] and impolitic purpoſe of  
enſlaving theſe Colonies by violence, and have thereby  
rendered it neceſſary for us to cloſe with their laſt ap-  
peal from reaſon two arms..--Yet, however blinded that  
Aſſembly may be, by their inten perate rage for unlimit-  
ed domination, fo. to flight juſtice and the opinion of  
mankind, we eſteem ow ſelves bound by obligations of  
  
reſpect to the reſt of the world, to make known the juſtice  
of our cauſe.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland of Great  
Britain, left their native land, to ſeek on theſe ſhores a  
reſidence for civil and religious freedom. At the ex-  
pence of their blood, at the hazard If their fortunes,  
without the leaſt charge to the country from which tbey  
removed, by unceaſing labour, and an unconquerable  
ſpirit, they effected ſettlements in the diſtant and inhol-  
pitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous  
and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or go-  
vernments, veſted with perfe&amp; legiſlatures, were formed  
under Charters from the Crown, and an harmonious in—  
tercourſe was eſtabliſhed between the Colonies and the  
Kingdom from which they derived their origin, The  
mutual benefits of this un on became in a thort time  
to extraordinary, as to excite aſtoniſhment. It is uni-  
verſally confrſſed, that the amazing increaſe of the  
wealth, ſtrength, and navigation of the realm aroſe  
from this ſource; and the Miniſter who ſo wiſely  
and ſucceſsfully directed the meaſures of Great Bri-  
| tain in the late war, publickly declared, that theſe  
  
Colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies.  
---] owards the concluſion of that war it pleaſed our  
Sovereign to make a change in his Councils.---From  
  
that fatal moment the affairs of the Britiſh Empire be-  
  
gan to fall into confuſion, and gradually ſliding from  
  
  
£04  
  
been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man,  
are at length diſtracted by the convulſions that now ſhake  
it to its deepeſt foundation. The new M nittry finding  
the brave foes of Britain, though frequently eteated,  
yet ſtill contending, took up the unfortunate idea of  
  
granting them a haſty peace, and of then ſubduing her  
faithful friends.  
  
Theſe devoted Colonies were judged to be in ſuch a  
Nate, as to preſent victories without bloodſhed, and all  
the eaſy emoluments of ſtatuteable plunder. The un-  
interrupted tenor of their peaceable and reſpectful be-  
haviour from the beginning of Colonization, their du-  
tiful, zealous, and uſeful ſervices during the war, tho&#x27;  
ſo recently and amply acknowledged in the moſt ho-  
nourable manner by his Majeſty, by the late King,  
and by Parliament, could not fave them from the medi-  
tated innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt  
the pernic:ous project, and aſſuming a new power over  
them, have, in the courſe of eleven years, given ſuch  
deciive ſpecimens of the ſpirit and conſequences attend-  
ing this power, as to leave n6 doubt concerning the ef-  
fects of acquieſcence under it They have undertaken  
to give and grant our money without our contient, tho?  
we have ever exerciſed an excluſive right to diſpoſe of  
our own property. Statutes have been paſſed for extend-  
ing the juriſdiction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-  
Admiralty beyond their antient limits, for depriving us  
of the accuſtomed and ineitimable privilege of trial by  
Jury in caſes affecting both life and property; for ſuſ-  
pending the legiſlature of one of the Colonies; for in-  
terdicting all commerce of another; and for altering  
fundamentally the form of government, eſtabliſhed by  
charter, and ſecured by Acts of its own Legiſlature ſo-  
lemnly confirmed by the Crown; for exempting the  
« Murderers” of Coloniſts from legal trial. and, in  
effect, from puniſh nent; for erecting in a neighbours  
ing Province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Bri-  
tain and America, a deſpotiſm dangerous to our very ex-  
iſtence; and for quartering ſoldiers upon the Coloniſts  
in time of profound peace. It has alſo been reſolved in  
Parliament, that Coloniſts charged with committing

What is to defend us againſt ſo enormous, fo unlimit-  
ed a power? Not a ſingle man of thoſe who aſſume  
it, is choſen by us, or is ſubje&amp; to our controul or in-  
fluence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them ex-  
empt from the operation of ſuch laws; and an American

be rebels and traitors, to ſuperſede the courſe of tne

We have received certain intelligence, that General

. and all of them are ſure of feeling, as faras the vengeance  
  
of Adminiſtration can inflict them, the complicated cala-  
mities of fire, ſword and famine. We are reduced to the  
alternative of chuſing an unconditional ſubmiſſion to the  
tyranny of irritated Miniſters, or reſiſtance by force.  
The latter is our choice. We have counted the coſt of  
this conteſt, and find nothing ſo dreadful as voluntary  
ſlavery, Honour, juſtice and humanity, forbid us tame]  
N to ſurrender that freedom which we received from our  
gallant anceſtors, and which our innocent poſterity have  
a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infa-

wretchedneſs which inevitably awaits them, if we baſely  
entail hereditary bondage upon them.

Causkzs AND NzcCEssSITY OF THEIR TAKING UP ARMS,  
  
I. it was poſſible for men who exerciſe their  
reaſon to believe, that the Divine Author of our  
exiſtence intended a part of the human race to hold  
an abſolute property in, and an unbounded power  
over others, marked out by his infinite goodneſs  
and wiſdom as the objects of a legal domination,  
never rightfully reſiſtible, however ſevere and op-  
preſſive; the inhabitants of theſe Colonies might  
at leaſt require from the Parliament of Great Bri-  
tain ſome evidence, that this dreadful authority  
over them has been granted to that body, But a  
reverence for our Great Creator, principles of hu-  
manity, and the dictates of common ſenſe, mult  
convince all thoſe who reflect upon the {ubject  
  
that Government was inſtituted to promote the

welfare of mankind, and ought to be admini-  
  
giſlature of Great Britain, however, ſtimulated by  
&#x27;an-inordinate paſſion for a power not only upjult-  
fiable; but which they know to be peculiarly  
Po and by the very conſtitution of that King-  
  
„where regard ſhould be had to truth, law, or  
Tight, have at length, deſerting thoſe, attempted to  
effect their cruel and impolitic purpoſe of enſlav-  
ing theſe Colonies by. violence, and have pr  
rendered it neceſſary for us to cloſe with their la  
appeal from reaſon to arms.---Yet, however blind-  
ed that Aſſembly may be, by their intemperate rage  
for unlimited domination, ſo to flight juſtice and  
the opinion of mankind, we eſteem ourſelves  
bound by obligations of reſpect to the reſt of the  
world, to make known the juſtice of our cauſe.  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland of  
Great Britain, left their. native land, to ſeek on  
theſe ſhores a reſidence for civil and religious free-  
  
  
hazard of their fortunes, without the leaſt charge  
to the country from which they removed, by un-  
ceaſing labour, and an unconquerable ſpirit, they  
effected ſettlements in the diſtant and inhoſpitable  
wilds of America, then filled with numerous and  
warlike nations of barbarians. - Societies or go-  
vernments, veſted with perfe&amp; legiſlatures, were  
  
  
the Colonies and the Kingdom from which they  
  
  
union became in a ſhort time ſo extraordinary, as  
to excite aſtoniſhment, It is univerſally con-  
  
  
ſtrength, and navigation of the realm aroſe from  
this ſource; and the Miniſter who ſo wiſely  
  
and ſucceſsfully directed the meaſures of Great  
Britata  
  
  
1 88 ) 2  
Britain in the late war, publickly declared,  
that theſe Culonies enabled her to triumph over  
her enemies. Towards the conchifion of that  
war it pleaſed our Sovereign to make a change  
in his Councils.---From that fatal moment the  
  
  
confuſion, and gradually ſliding from the ſumi  
of glorious proſperity, to which they bad been  
advanced by the virtues and abilities of one  
man, are at length diſtracted by the convulſidns  
that now ſhake it to its deepeſt foundation. The  
new Miniſtry finding the brave ſoes of Britain,  
though frequently defeated, yet ſtill contending,  
took up the unfortunate idea of 2 them  
a haſty peace, and of then ſubduing her faithful  
friends. p | N _  
Theſe devoted Colonies were judged to be in  
ſuch a tate, as to preſent vidories without blood-  
ſhed, and all the eaſy emoluments of ſtatuteable  
plunder. The uninterrupted tenor of their peace-  
able and reſpectful behaviour from the beginning  
of Colonization, their dutiful, zealous, and uſe-  
ful ſervices&#x27; during the war, tho* fo recently and  
amply Nr in the moſt honourable  
manner by his Majeſty, by the late King, an d  
by Parliament, could not ſave them from the me-  
ditated innovations. Parliament was influenced  
to adopt the pernicious project, and aſſuming 2  
new power over them, have, in the courſe of eleven  
years, given ſuch deciſive ſpecimens of the ſpirit  
and conſequences attending this power, as to leave  
no doubt concerning the effects of acquieſcence  
under it. They have undertaken to give and grant  
our money without our conſent, tho&#x27; we have ever  
exerciſed an excluſive right to diſpoſe of our own  
. Statutes have been paſſed for extending  
the juriſdiction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-  
Admiralty beyond their antient limits, for depriv-  
ing us of the accultomed and ineſtimable priv

and property; for ſuſpending the legiſlature of one  
of the Colonies; for interdifting all commerce  
of another; and for altering. fundamentally the  
form of government, eſtabliſhed by charter, and  
—&lt; ſecured by Acts of its own Legiſlature ſolemnly  
| ws by the Crown; for exempting the  
  
ee Murderers” of Coloniſts from legal trial, and;  
in effect, from puniſhment; for erecting in a  
neighbouring Province, acquired by the joint  
arms of Great Britain and America, a deſpotiſm  
dangerous to our very exiſtence ; and for quarteri  
ſoldiers upon the Coloniſts in time of —  
| It has alſo been reſolved in Parliament,  
that Coloniſts charged with committing certain  
offences, ſhall be tranſported to England to be  
tried. ,  
  
But why ſhould we enumerate our injuries is  
detail? By one Statute it is declared, that Parlia-  
ment can of right make laws to bind. us in  
all caſes whatſoever.” What is to defend us  
againſt ſo enormous, ſo unlimited a power? Not  
a fingle man of thoſe who aſſume it, is choſen  
by us, or is ſubject to our controul or influence;  
but, on the contrary, they are all of them exempt  
from the operation of ſuch laws; and an American  
revenue, if not diverted from the oſtenſible pur-  
poſes for which it is raiſed, would actually lighten  
their own burdens in proportion as they increaſe  
aurs. We ſaw the miſery to which ſuch deſpo-  
tiſm would reduce us. We for ten years inceſ-  
ſantly and inefteQually beſieged the Throne as ſup-  
plicants; we reaſoned, we remonſtrated with Parlia-  
ment in the moſt mild and decent language, But  
Adminiſtration, ſenſible that we ſhould regard theſe  
oppreſſive meaſures as freemen ought to do, ſent  
over fleets and armies to enforce them. The in-  
dignation of the Americans was rouſed, it is true;  
  
but it was the indignation of a virtuous, loyal, and

afſectionate people. A Congreſs of Delegates from  
the United Colonies was aſſembled at Philadelphia,  
en the 5th day of laſt September. We reſolved  
  
the King, and alſo addreſſed our fellow-ſubjets:  
of Great-Britain, We have purſued every tempe-  
rate, every reſpectful meaſure; we have even pro-  
ceeded to break off our commercial intercourſe  
with our fellow- ſubjects, as the laft peaceable ad-  
  
  
earth ſhould ſupplant our attachment to liberty.  
This we flattered - ourſc Ives was the ultimate ſtep  
of the controverſy ; but the ſubſequent events have  
ſhewn, how vairr is this hope of finding. moderation  
in our enemies. | 3  
Several threatening expreſſions againſt the Co-  
  
lonies were inſerted in his Majeſty&#x27;s Speech. Our  
Petition, though we were told it was a decent”  
one, that his Majeſty had been pleaſed to receive  
it graciouſly, and to promiſe laying it before his  
Parliament, was huddled into both Houſes amongſt  
a bundle of American papers, and there neglected,  
The Lords and Commons in their Addreſs, in the  
month of February, ſaid, That „a rebellion at  
that time actually exiſted within the Province of  
Maſſachuſet&#x27;s Bay; and that thoſe concerned in  
it had been countenanced and encouraged by un-  
lawful combinations and engagements, entered in-  
to by his Majeſty&#x27;s ſubjects in ſeveral of the other  
Colonies ; and therefore they beſought his Majeſty,  
that he would take the moſt effectual meaſures to  
enforce due obedience to the laws and authority  
of the Supreme Legiſlature,” Soon after the  
commercial intercourſe of whole Colonies, with  
  
  
by an Act of Parliament; by another, ſeveral of  
them were entirely prohibited from the fiſheries in  
the ſeas near their coaſts, on which they always:

Fruitleſs were all the entreaties, arguments and  
eloquence of an illuſtrious. band of the moſt diſtin-  
guithed Peers and Commoners, who nobly and ftre-  
  
  
even to mitigate the heedleſs fury with which  
ele accumulated and unexampled outrages were  
humied on. Equally fruitleſs was the interference  
of the City of London, of Briſtol, and many ether  
reſpectable towns, in our favour. Parliament  
adopted an inſidious manœuvre, calculated to di-  
vide us, to eſtabliſh a perpetual auction of taxations,  
where Colony ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of  
them uninformed what ranſom ſhould redeem their  
lives, and thus to extort from us, at the point of  
the bayonet, the unknown ſums that ſhould be  
ſuſhcicnt to gratiſy, if poſſible to gratify, Miniſte-  
rial rapacity, with the miſerable indulgence left  
to us of railing in our own mode the preſcribed  
tribute, What terms more rigid and bumiliating  
could have been dictated by remorſeleſs victors to  
conquered enemies ? In our circumſtances, to ac-  
cept them would be to deſerve them. &#x27;  
Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceedings  
arrived on this Contineat, General Gage, who in  
the courſe of the laſt year had taken poſſeſſion of  
the town of Boſton, in the province of Maſſnebu-  
ſer&#x27;s-Bay, and ſtill occupied it as a garriſon, on the  
19th day of April. ſent out from that place a large  
detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked +  
aſſault on the inhabitants of the ſaid province, at the  
town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of  
a great number of perſons, fome of whom were  
officers and ſoldiers of that detachment, murdered  
eight of the inhabitants, and waunded many  
others. From theace the troops proceeded in  
warlike array to the town of Concord, where they  
ſet upon another party of the inhabitants of the  
  
ſame  
  
89 J  
  
ſame Province, killing ſeveral, and wounding:  
more, until compelled to retreat by the country  
  
people ſuddenly aſſembled to repel this cruel ag-  
greſon. Hoſtilities thus commenced by the Bri-  
tiſh troops, have been ſince proſecuted by them.  
without regard to faith or reputation, The in-  
habitants of Boſton being confined within thaß  
town by the General their Governor, and having.  
in order to procure their diſmiſſion entered into a.  
treaty with him, it was ſtipulated that the ſaid  
inhabitants, having depoſited their arms with  
their own: Magiſtrates, ſhould. have liberty to de-  
  
taking with them their other effects. They  
accordingly delivered up their arms; but in open  
violation of honour, in defiance of the obligation  
of treaties, which even ſavage nations eſteem ſa-  
cred, the Governor ordered the arms depoſited  
as aforeſaid, that they might be preſerved for their.  
owners, to be ſeized by a body of foldiers; de-  
tained the greateſt part of the inhabitants in the  
town, and compelled the ſew who were permitted.  
eee leave their moſt valuable effects be-  
  
. By this perfidy wives are ſeparated: from their  
huſbands, children from their parents, the aged:  
and ſick from their. relations and friends, who  
wiſh to attend and comfort them; and thoſe who  
Have been uſed to live in N and even ele-  
  
ince, are reduced to deplorable diſtreſs.  
  
The General, further emulating. his Miaiſte--  
rial maſters, by a proclamation,, bearing date on:  
the 12th day of June, after venting. the groſſeſt  
falſehoods and calumnies againſt the good people of  
theſe Colonies, proceeds to- declare them all,  
either by name or. deſcriptien, to be rebels and  
traitors, to ſuperſede. the courſe of the common  
law, and inſtead thereof to publiſh and order the  
uſe and exerciſe of the law martial.“ His. troops

end. The Legiſlature of Great Britain, however,

on] unjuſtifcable, but which they know to be pecu—

theſe Colonies by violence, and have thereby render.  
ed it neceſſary for us to cloſe with their laſt appeal  
from reaſon to arms. Yet, however blinded that  
Aſſembly may be, by their intemperate rage for un-  
limited domination, ſo to ſiight juſtice and the opi-  
nion of mankind, we eſteem ourſelves bound by ob-  
ligations of reſpect to the reſt of the world, to make  
known the juſtice of our cauſe.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the iſland of Great  
Britain, left their native land, to feek on theſe ſhores  
a reſidence for civil and religious freedom. At the  
expence of their blood, at the hazard of their for-  
runes, without the leaſt charge to the country from  
which they removed, by unceaſing labour, and an  
unconquerable ſpirit, they effected ſettlements inthe  
diſtant and inhoſpitable wilds of America, then ſil-  
led with numerous and warlike nations of barbari-  
ans. Societies or governments, veſted with perfect  
legiſlatures, were formed under Charters from the  
crown, and an harmonious intercourſe was elta-  
bliſhed between the Colonies and the Kingdom from  
which they derived their origin. The mutual bene-  
fits of this union became in a ſhort time ſo extraor-  
dinary, as to excite aſtoniſhment. It is univerſally  
confeſſed, that the amazing increaſe of the wealth,  
ſtrength, and navigation of the realm aroſe from this  
ſource; and the Miniſter who fo wiſely and ſuccels-

or Munmit of glorious proſperity, to which they had  
deen advanced, by the virtues and abilities of one  
nan, are at length diſtracted by the convulſions  
that now ſhake it to its deepeſt foundation. Ihe

do, ſent over fleets and armies to enforce them.  
The indignation of the Americans was rouſed, it 18  
true; but it was the indignation of a virtuous, loy-  
al, and affectionate people. A Congreſs of Dele-  
| gates  
  
  
*; proceeded to break off our commercial intercourſe  
| affith our fellow-ſubjects, as the laſt peaceable ad-  
  
meMnonition, that our attachment to no nation upon

This we flattered ourſelves was the ultimate ſtep of  
nale controverſy ; but the ſubſequent events have  
hewn, how vaia is this hope of finding moderation  
ain our enemies |  
Several threatening expreſſions againſt the Colo-

Petition, though we were told it was a decent one,  
at his Majeſty had been pleaſed to receive ic gra-

February, ſaid, That * a rebellion at that time  
Kually exiſted within the Province of Maſſachuſett&#x27;s

ſent over to General Gage.  
  
Fruitleſs were all the entreaties, arguments, and  
eloquence of an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtin  
guiſhed Peers and Commoners, who nobly and ftre  
nuouſly aſſerted the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay, ©  
even to mitigate the heedleſs fury with which theſe

|  
accumulated and unexampled outrages were hurried  
on. Equally fruitleſs was the interference of the  
  
City of London, of Briſtol, and many other reſpect  
able towns, in our favour. Parliament adopted a  
inſidious mancenvre, calculated to divide us, to eſta  
bliſh a perpetual auction of taxationg, where Colon  
ſhould bid againſt Colony, all of uninformed  
what ranſom Thould redeem their lives, and thus ti

cireumſtances, to accept them would be to deſery

Soon after the intelligence of theſe proceeding  
arrived on this Continent, General Gage, who 1

a legal domination never rightfully reſiſtible, however  
ſevere and oppreſſive, the inhabitants of theſe colonies

however, ſtimulated by an inordinate paſſion for a power  
not only unjuſtifiable, but which they know to be pecu-  
liarly reprobated by the very conſtitution of that kingdom,  
and deſperate of ſucceſs in any mode of conteſt, where  
regard ſhould be had to truth, law, or right, have at

we were told it was a decent one, and that his majeſty had  
been pleaſed to receive it graciouſly, and to promiſe laying  
it before his parliament, was huddled into both houſes  
&quot;among a bundle of American papers, and there neglected.  
The rds and commons in their addreſs, in the month of  
February, ſaid; that a rebellion at that time actually ex-  
iſted within the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay; and that  
thoſe concern in it, had been countenanced and encou-  
raged by unlawful combinations and en nts, entered  
into by Bis majeſty&#x27;s ſubjeQs in ER other co-  
lohies ; and therefore they beſought his majeſty, that he  
would take the moſt effectual meaſures to inforce due obe-  
dience to the laws and authority of the ſupreme legiſlature.”  
Soon after the commercial intercourſe of whole colonies,  
with foreign countries, and with each other, was cut off  
by an act of parliament; by another, ſeveral of them  
were entirely prohibited from the fiſheries in the ſeas near  
their coaſts, on which they always depended for their ſuſte-  
nance; and large reinforcements of ſhips and troops were  
immediately ſent over to general Gage.  
  
„% FRUITLESS were all the entreaties, arguments, and  
eloquence of an illuſtrious band of the moſt diſtinguiſhed  
peers and commoners, who nobly and ſtrenuouſly aflerted  
the juſtice of our cauſe, to ſtay, or even to mitigate the  
heedleſs fury with which theſe accumulated and unexam-  
pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitlefs was the  
interference of the city of London, of Briſtol, and many  
other reſpectabſe towns, in our favour. Parliament adopted  
an inſidious manceuvre calculated to divide us, to eftabliſh  
a perpetual auction of taxations where colony ſhould bid  
againſt colony, all of them uninformed what ranſom ſhould ©  
redeem their lives; and thus to extort from us, at the  
  
int of the bayonet, the unknown ſums that ſhould be

in our on mode, the preſcribed tribute. What terms  
more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by  
remorſeleſs victors to conquered enemies? In our circum-  
ſtances to accept them, would be to deſerve them.  
  
„ Soo after the intelligence of theſe proceedings ar-  
rived on this continent, general Gage, who in the courſe  
of the laſt year had taken poſſeſſion of the town of Boſton,  
in the province of Maſſachuſett&#x27;s-Bay, and ſtill occupied  
it as a garriſon, on the 19th day of April, ſent out from  
that place a large detdehment of his army, who made an  
unprovoked aſſault on the inhabitants of the ſaid province,  
at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of  
a great number of perſons, ſome of whom were officers  
and ſoldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the  
inhabitants, and wounded many others, From thence the  
troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord,  
where they ſet upon another party of the inhabitants of  
the ſame province, killing ſeveral and wounding more,  
until compelled to retreat 5 the eountry people ſuddenly  
  
  
commenced by the Britiſh troops, have been ſince proſe-  
cuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The  
inhabitants of Boſton being confined within that town by  
the general their governor, and having, in order to pro-  
cure their diſmiſſion, entered into a treaty with him, it  
was ſtipulated, that the ſaid inhabitants having depoſited  
their arms with their own magiſtrates, ſhould have liberty

After taking notice of the manner in which their anceRors left Bri-  
tain, the happinefs attending the mutual friendly commerce betwixt  
that country and her colonies, and the remarkable fuccefs of the laté  
war, they proceed as follows: * The new miniltry, finding the brave  
foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet ftill contending, took  
up the unfortunate idea of granting them a hafty peace, and of then  
fubduing her faithful friends.  
  
“* Thefe devoted colonies were judged to be in fuch a ftate&#x27;as to pre-  
fent vitories without bloodfhed, and all the eafy emoluments of ftatu-  
table plunder. The uninterrupted tenor of their peacable and re{pett-  
ful behaviour from the beginning of their colonization; their dutiful,  
zealous, and ufeful fervices during the war, though fo recently and  
amply acknowledged inthe moft honourable manner by his majefty,  
by the late king, and by parliament, could not fave them from the in-  
tended innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the perni-  
cious proje&amp; ; and affuming a new power over them, has, in the courfe  
of eleven years, given fuch decifive fpecimens of the {pirit and confe-  
quences attending this power, as to leave no doubt of the effe&amp;s of  
acquiefcefice under it.  
  
‘** They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our  
confent, though we have ever exercifed an exclufivejright to difpofo  
of our own property. Statutes have been paffed for extending the ju-  
cifdiétion of the courts of admiralty and vice-admiralty beyond their  
ancient limits ; for depriving us of the accuftomed and ineftimable  
rights of trial by jury, in cafes affeting both life and property ; for  
fulpending the legiflature of one of our colonies ; for interdi&amp;ting all

moft mild and decent language ; but adminiftration, fenfible that we  
fhould regard thefe meafures as freemen ought to do, fent over fleets

‘We have purfued every temperate, every refpectful meafure; we

fellow-fubjefts, as our laft peaceable admonition, that our attachment  
to no nation on earth would fupplant our attachment to liberty ; this

{ubfequent events have fhown how vain was this hope of finding mo-  
deration in our enemies !  
  
‘¢ The Lords and Commons, in their addrefs in the monthof Febru.  
ary, faid, that a rebellion at that time a€tually exifted in the province  
of Maffachufetts-Bay ; and that thofe concerned in it had been coun-  
tenanced and encouraged by unlawful combinations and engagements  
entered into by his majefty’s fubjects in feveral of the colonies ; and  
therefore they befought his majefty, that he would take the moft effec.  
tual meafures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of  
the fupreme legiflature. Soon after the commercial intercourfe of  
whole colonies with foreign countries was cut off by an act of parlia.  
ment ; by another, feveral of them were entirely prohibited from the  
fitheries in the feas near their coafts, on which they always depended  
for their fubfiftance; and large reinforcements of fhipsand troops were  
immediately fent over to Gen. Gage.

ent of Great Britain  
some evidence, that this dreadful authority over  
them has been granted to that body. But a reve-  
rence for our great Creator, principles of humanity,  
and the dictates of common sense, must convince  
all those who reflect upon the subject, that govern-  
Ment was instituted to promote the welfare of man-  
kind, and ought to be administered for the attain-  
ment of thatend. The legislature of Great Britain  
however, stimulated by an inordinate passion for a  
  
  
  
  
  
power not only unjustifiable, but which they know  
  
to be’ peculiarly reprobated by the very constitution  
of that kingdom, and desperate of success in any  
mode of contest, where regard should be had to  
truth, law, or right, have at length, deserting those,  
at tempted to eflect their cruel and impolitic purpose  
of enslaving these colonies by violence, and have  
thereby rendered it necessary for us to close with  
their last appeal from reason to arms. Yet how-  
ever blinded that assembly may be, by their intem-  
perate rage for unlimited domination, so to slight  
justice and the opinion of mankind, we esteem our-  
selves bound by obligations of respect to the rest of  
the world, to make known the justice of our cause.  
  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the island of  
Great Britain, lett their native land, to scek on  
these shores a residence for civil and religious free-  
dom. At the expence of their blood, at the haz -  
  
‘ard of their fortunes, without the least charge to  
  
the country from which they removed, by unceas-  
ing labour and an unconquerable spirit, they effect-  
ed settlements in the distant and inhospitable wilds  
of America, then filled with numerous and warlike  
nations of barbarians.—Socictics or governments,  
vested with perfect legislatures, were formed under  
charters from thé crown, and an harmonious inter-  
course Was established between the colonies and the  
  
kingdom from which they derived their origin.—  
The mutual benefits of this union became in a short  
time so extraordinary, as to excite astonishment.

crease of wealth, strength, and navigation of the

sures of Great Britain in the late war, publicly de-  
eclared, that these colonies enable her to triumph  
over her enemies. Towards the conclusion of  
that war, it pleased our sovereign to make a change  
in his councils. From that fatal moment, the at-  
fairs of the British empire began to fall into con-  
fusion, and gradually sliding from the summit of  
glorious prosperity to which they had been advan-  
ced by the virtues and abilities of one man, are at  
Jength distracted by the convulsions that now shake  
it to its deepest foundations. The new ministry  
finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently  
‘defeated, yet still contending, took up the unfortu-  
nate idea of granting thema hasty peace, and of  
then subduing her faithful friends,  
  
These devoted colonies were judged to be in  
such a state, a8 to present victories without blood-  
shed, and all the easy emoluments of statuteabie  
plunder. ‘The uninterrupted tenor of their peacea-  
ble and respectful behaviour from the beginning  
of colonization, their dutiful, zealous, and useful  
services during the war, though so recently and  
amply acknowledged in the most honourable man-  
ner by his majesty, by the late king, and by par-  
liament, could not save them from the meditated  
innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt  
the pernicious project, and assuming a new power  
over them, have in the course of cleven years given  
such decisive specimens of the spirit and  conse-  
quences attending this power, as to leave no doubt  
concerning the effects of acquiescence under it.  
The have undertaken to give and grant our money  
  
  
  
without our consent, though we have ever exercised  
an exclusive right to dispose of our own proper-  
ty; statutes have been passed for extending the  
jurisdiction of courts of admiralty and vice admi-  
ralty beyond their ancient limits ; for depriving us  
of the accustomed and inestimable privilege of trial  
by jury in cases affecting both life and property ;  
for suspending the legislature of one of the colo-  
nics; for interdicting all commerce to the capital  
of another; and for altering fundamentally the  
form of government established by character, and se-  
cured by acts of its own legislature, solemnly con-  
firmed by the crown; for exempting the “mur-  
derers” of colonists from legal trial, and in effect,  
from punishment; for erecting in a neighbouring  
province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Bri-  
tain and America, a despotism dangerous to our  
very existence ; and for quartering soldiers upon  
the colonists in time of profound peace. It has also  
been resolved in parliament, that colonists charged  
  
  
  
with committing certain offences, shall be trans-  
ported to England to be tried.  
  
But why should we enumerate our injuries in  
detail? By one statute it is declared, that parliament  
can “of right make laws to bind us in all cases  
whatsoever.’ What is to defend us against so enor-  
mous, so unlimited a power? Nota single man of  
those who assume it is chosen by us; or is subject  
to our controul or influence ; but on the contrary,  
they are all of them exempt from the operation  
of such laws, and an .4merican revenue, if not di-  
verted from the ostensible purposes for which it is  
raised would actually lighten their own burdens  
in proportion as they increase ours. We saw the  
misery to which such despotism would reduce us.  
We for ten years incessantly and ineffectually be-  
sieged the throne as supplicants ; we reasoned, we  
remonstrrted with parliament in the most mild and  
decent language.  
  
Administration, sensible that we should regard  
these oppressive measures as freemen ought to do  
  
indignation of the Americans was roused, it is fruez  
but it was the indignation of a virtuous, loyal, and  
affectionate people. A congress of delegates from  
the united colonies was assembled at Philadelphia  
on the fifth day of last September. We resolved again  
to offer an humble and dutiful: petition to the  
king, and also addressed our fellow subjects of  
Great Britain. We have pursued every tempe-  
rate, every respectful measure ; we have even pro-  
ceeded to brake off our commercial intercourse  
with our fellow subjects, as the last peaceable ad-  
monition, that our attachment to no nation upon  
earth, should supplant our attachment to liberty.  
This, we flattered ourselves was the ultimate step  
of the controversy; but susequent events have  
shewn, how vain was this hope of finding modera-  
tion in our enemies. :  
  
Several threatening expressions against the co-  
lonies were inserted in his majesty’s speech; our  
petition though we were told it was a decent one,  
and that his majesty had been pleased to receive it  
graciously, and to promise laying it before his par-  
liament, was huddled into both houses among a bun-  
dle of American papers, and there neglected. The  
lords and commons in their address, in the month  
of February said, that “a rebellion at that time  
actually existed within the province of Massuchu-  
setts Bay ; and that those concerned in it, had been  
countenanced and encouraged by unlawfnl com-  
binations and engagements, entered into by his  
majesty’s subjects in several of the other colonies;  
and therefore they besought his majesty, that he  
would take the most effectual measures to enforce  
due obedience to the laws and authority of the  
supreme legislature.”—Soon after, the commercial  
intercourse of whole colonies, with foreign coun-  
tries, and with each other, was cut off by an act of  
parliament; by another, several of them were  
entirely prohibited from the fisheries in the seas  
near their coasts, on which they always depended  
for their sustenance ; and large reinforcements of  
shipsand troops were immediately sent over to  
general Gage.  
  
Fruitless were all the entreaties, arguments, and,  
eloquence of an illustrious band of the most dis-  
tinguished peers and commoners, who nobly and  
strenuously asserted the justice of our cause te  
stay, or even to mitigate the heedless fury with  
which these accumulated and unexampled outrages  
were hurried on. Equally fruitless was the inter-.  
ference of the city of London, of Bristol and many  
other respectable towns in our favour. Parliament  
adopted an insidious maneuvre calculated to divide  
us, to establish a perpetual auction of taxation,  
where colony should bid against colony, all of them  
uninformed what ransom would redeem their lives;  
and thus extort from them at the point of the bayo-  
net the unknown sums that should be sufficient to  
gratify, if possible to gratify, ministerial rapacity,  
with the miserable indulgence left to us of raising  
in our own mode, the prescribed tribute. Wha  
terms more rigid and humiliting could have been  
dictated by remorseless victors to conquered ene-  
mies? In our c:reumstances to accept them, would  
be to deserve them.  
  
Soon after the intelligence of these proceedings  
arrived on-this continent, general Gage, who in the  
course of the last year had taken possession of the  
town of Boston, in the province of Massachusetts  
Bay, and still occupied: it as a garrison, on the 19th  
of April, sent out from that place a large detach-  
ment of his army, who made an unprovoked assault  
on the inhabitants of the said province, at the town

number of persons, some of whom were officers,  
and soldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of  
the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From  
thence the troops proceeded in a warlike array to  
the town.of Coneerd, where they set upon another  
party of the inhabitants of the same prov.nce, killing  
several and wounding more, until compelled to re-  
treat by the country people suddenly assembled to  
repel his cruel oppression. Hostilities, thus com-  
menced by the British troops, have been since prose-  
cuted by them w:thout regard to faith or reputation.  
The inhabitants of Boston being confined within  
that town by the general their goveraor, and having  
im order to procure their dismission, entered into a  
treaty with him; it was stipulated that the said in-  
habitants having depysited their arms with their own  
magistrates, should have liberty to depart, taking  
with them their own effects. They accordingly  
delivered up their arms, but in open violation of  
honor, in defiance of the obligation of treaties,  
which even savage nations esteem sacred the govern-  
or ordered the arms deposited as aforesaid, that  
they might be preserved for their owners, to be  
seized by a body of soldicrs ; detained the greatest  
part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled  
the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their  
waluabie effeets dehind.  
  
By this perfidy, wives are separated from their  
husbands, children from their parents, the aged and  
the sick from their relations and friends, who wish  
to attend and comfort them; and those who have  
been used to live in plenty and even elegance, are  
reduced to deplorable distress.  
  
The general, further emulating his ministerial  
masters; by a proclamation bearing date on the 12th  
day of June, after venting the grossest falsehoods  
and calumnies against the good people of these  
colonies, proceeds to “ declare them all either by  
name or description, to be rebels and traitors, to  
supercede the course of the common law, and  
instead thereof to. publish and order the use and  
exercise of the law martial.’ His troops have  
butchered our countrymen, have wantonly burnt  
Churlestown, besides a considerable number of hous-  
es in other places; our ships and vessels are seized ;  
the necessary supplics of provisions are intercepted,  
and he is exerting his utmost power to spread de-  
struction and devastation around him.  
  
We have received certain intelligence, that gene-  
ral Carlton the governor of Canada, is instigating  
the people of that province and the Jndians to fall  
  
upon us; and we have but too much reason to  
apprchend that schemes have been formed to excite  
domestic enemies against us. In brief, a part of  
these colonies now feel, and all of them are sure of  
feeling, as fur as the vengeance of administration  
» can inthct them, the complicated calamities of fire,  
y sword and famine. We are reduced to the alterna-  
ci, tive of choosing an unconditional submission to  
starthe tyranny of irritated ministers, or resistance by  
eottorce. ‘The latter is our cheice. Ws aaveE coun-  
TED THE COST CF THIS CONTEST, AND FIND  
NOTHING SO DREADFUL AS VOLUNTARY SLAVERY  
F oor, justice ana humanity forbid us tamely to’sur-  
render that freedom which we received from our gal-  
Jan cestors. and which our innocent posterity have .  
a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the in-  
fumy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations  
to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them,  
if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.  
  
Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our  
inte. wai resources are great, and, if necessary, fo-  
reign assistince is undoubtedly attainable. We  
gravelully acknowledge, as signal instances of the  
  
Divine favour towards us, that his providence would  
not permit us to be called into this severe controver.  
sy until we were grown up to our present strength,  
had been previously exercised in Warlike operations,  
and possessed the means of defending ourselves.  
With hearts fortified by these anmat.ng reflections,  
we most solemniy, betore Goud and the world,  
DECLARE, that, exerung the utmost energy of those  
powers, which our beneficent Creator hath graci-  
ously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been  
compelied by our enemies to assume, we will, in  
defiance of every hazard, with unabaung firmness  
and perserverance, employ for the preservation of  
our liberties ; being with one mind resolved to dic  
treemen rather than to live slaves.  
  
Lest this declaration should disquiet the minds of  
our friends and fellow-subjects in any part oi the  
empire, we assure them that we mean not to dis-  
solve that union which has so long and so happily  
subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish  
to see restored. Necessity has not yet driven us  
into that desperate measure or induced us to ex-  
cite any other nation to War against theu:. We have  
not raised armies with ambitious designs 0 sepa,  
rating from Great Britain, and esiabiushing inde-  
}pendent states. We fight not for glory or tor con-  
quest. We exhibit to, mankind the remarkable  
spectable of a people attacked by unprovoked enc-  
mies, without any imputation or even suspicion of  
offence. They boast ot their privileges and civili-  
zation, and yet prolier no milder condition than  
servitude or deaih.  
  
In our own native land, in defence of the free-  
dom that is our birth right, and which we ever en-  
joved till the Jaie violation of i1t—for the protection  
of our property, acquired solely by the honest in-  
dustry of our forefathers and ourselves, against vio-  
lence actually offered, we have taken up arms.—  
We shali lay them down when hostilities shall  
cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger  
of their being renewed shall be removed, and not  
before.  
  
With an humble confidence in the mercies of the  
supreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the  
universe, we most devoutly implore his Divine  
  
}goodness to protect us happily through this great  
  
conflict to dispose our adversaries to reconciliation  
on reasonable terms, and thereby to relieve the  
empire from the calamities of civil war

idable to the Americans than be-  
fore, Congress proceeded to justi-  
  
fy their proceedings, in a decla-.  
  
ration drawn up in terms more  
expressive, and well calculated to  
cxcite attention. “Were it pos-

ercise their reason, to beHeve that  
th: Divine Author of our exist-  
ence intended a part of the human  
race to hold an absolute property

others, marked out by his infinite  
gooduess as objects of a legal.  
domination, never to be resisted  
however severe and oppressive.  
The inhabitants of these colonies  
might at least require from the  
  
parliament of Great Britain, some |.

for our great Creator, principles

common sense, must convince all  
those who reflect on the subject,  
that government was instituted to  
promote the welfare of mankind,  
aid ought tobe administered to  
the attainment of that end.  
  
The legislature of Great Brit-  
ain, stimulated by an inordinate  
passion for power, not only un.  
justifiable, byt which they knew  
to be peculiarly repugnant to the  
constitution of that kingdom, and  
despairing of success in any  
mode of eontest where regard  
should be had to law, or truth, or  
right, have at length, deserting  
those, attempted to effect their  
cruel and impolitic purpose of en-  
  
slaving these colonies, by violence, |

Cessary for us to close with their  
last appeal from season, to arms.

ceeded as follows:. “The new  
ministry finding the brave foes  
of Britain, though frequently de-  
. feated, yet still contending, look  
up to the unfortunate idea of  
granting them a hasty peace and  
‘of then subduing her faithful,

These devoted colonies were  
pate to be in such a state as to  
prevent victories without blood-

usefull services, during the war,

fluenced to adopt the pernicious

of eleven years, given such des  
cisive specimens of the spirit and  
consequences attending this pow-  
er, as to leave no doubt of the af  
fects of acquiescence under if.  
  
They have undertaken to give

a single person, who assumes it,

The lords and commons in their  
address in the month of February  
1775, said that a rebellion at that  
time actually existed in the pro-

engagements entered into by his  
majesty’s subjects in several oth-

besought his majesty that he  
would take the most affectual  
measures to enforce due obedi-  
ence to the laws and authority of  
the supreme legislature. Soon  
after, the commercial intercourse  
of those colonies with foreign,  
countries was cut of by an act of.  
parliament; by another, several  
of them were entirely prohibited  
from the fisheries in the seas  
near their coasts, on which they  
always depended for their sub-  
sistance; and large  reinforce-.  
ments of ships and troops were  
immediately sent over to general,  
Gage. Fruitless were all the en-

forbid us tamely to surrender that  
freedom which we received from our  
gallant ancestors, and which our  
innocent posterity have a right to  
receive from us. We cannot endure the  
infamy of resigning succeeding  
generations to that wretchedness which  
inevitably awaits them if we basely  
entail upon them hereditary bondage. Our  
cause is just-our union is perfect-our  
internal resources are great-and, if  
necessary, foreign assistance is  
undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully  
acknowledge, as a signal instance of his  
divine favour towards us, that his  
providence would not permit us to be  
called into this severe controversy  
until we were grown up to our present  
strength. (Three Millions). With hearts  
fortified by these animating  
reflections, we most solemnly, before  
God and the world, DECLARE, that  
exerting the utmost energy of those  
powers which our beneficent Creator hath  
graciously bestowed, the arms we have  
been compelled by our enemies to assume,  
we will, in defiance of every hazard,  
employ for the preservation of our  
liberties, being with one mind resolved  
TO DIE FREEMAN, RATHER THAN LIVE AS  
SLAVES!&quot; &amp;nbsp; This first congress sat

A DECLARATION by the REPRESENTA­  
TIVES of United CsjNiV ofNorth-America,  
now met in G-Krau-CoiosKsosr Philadelphia,  
getting forth tho Causes arid NcaiTT of their  
taking up ARMS.  
If it was possible for men who exercise their reason  
to believe that the Divine Author Mlow&#x27;existence  
inteuded a&#x27; part of lb human race to bald an abtrfrtule  
property hi, and nnbounpVd power over, others,  
marked ouTby his infinite goodness and. wisdom, as  
the) objects of a legal domination, never rightfully re­  
sistiibie, however severe and oppressive, the inhabi­  
tants of these Colonies might at lea.it require ftom the  
Parliament of Great-Brit-in some evidence, that this  
dreadful authority over them has been (fronted to that  
body. But a reverence for our great Creator, prin­  
ciples of humanity, ami the dictates of common sense,  
must convince all those who reflect upon the sabjoet,  
that government was instituted to promote the wel­  
fare of mankind, and ought to bo administered for  
the attainment of that end. The legislature ? Great­  
Britain, howeVer stimulated hy an inordinate passion  
for a power not only unjustifiable, but which they  
know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very constitu­  
tion of that kingdom, aud desperate of success in any  
mode of contest, where regard should be had to truth,  
law or right, have at length, deserting those, at  
tempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpose of  
nslttvmg these Coioiues by.vtolcuce, and have lliere­  
.by rendered it necessary for na to close with their  
last appeal from Reason to Arms. Yet, however  
blinded that amlly may be, by timer itileinperule i  
rairo for nulimited rule, so to sli.-nl invitee aud (I f  
opinion of mankind, r esteem ourselves bo::uJ by  
obligation of respect to the rest of tha woild, to muke  
known the justice of our cause.  
Our forefathers, inhabitants of the n&#x27;snd of Great­  
Brltaiu, Isrt their native land, to seek on these sl.ores  
residence for civil and reli.jious freedom. At the  
expence of their blow), at the luiiard of their fsrtiirl.es.  
without the least charge to I tie country torn which  
they removed, by unceasing labor and aa uncoiiquera  
ble spirit, they eilctJ settlement! in the di-Uut anil  
iuhosuilakle wuds of Amer.ca, Oiru ruled with nu  
merous aud warlike nations of barbarian. Societies  
or governments, vented with perfect legislatures,  
were formed uuder charter from the crown, auu un  
harmonious intercourse was established betwee the  
colonies and ilia kingdom from which tliey derived  
their origin. TUo mutual benefits of this union be  
came in a short lime so eatraordihury, as to excite  
astonishment. It is universally ceufessed, that the  
amazing iacroasc of the wealth, strength and navii&#x27;u  
tion of the realm, anwa from this source ; and the  
minister who ae wisely and surcesafully directed the  
measures of Ureal bntuin in tlio Into war, pubiiciy  
declared, that these o a  
o Delegates from the united eolonies  
were assembled at Philadelphia, on the fifth day of  
last September. - We resolved agam to oltt-r an hum­  
ble and dutiful petition to the Kin?, and also ad  
dressed our fellow-subjects of Great-Britain. W  
bava pursued every temperate, evury respectful  
measure, we have oven prueewled to bieak oil our  
commercial intercourse whh our fellow-subjects, as  
the last peaceable admonition, that our altuchuient  
to no nation upon earth should supplant our attach­  
ment to liberty. This, we fluttered ourselves, was  
the ultimate step of the controversy. Hut subsei.u nl  
events have shewu, how vaiu was thu bupe of iiud­  
Ing moderation In our enemies.  
Several threatening expressions against the eolcn s  
were inserted in his Majesty&#x27;s speech ; our peliuon,  
though w wore told it was a deceut one, that Lis  
Majesty bad been pleased to receive il graciously , and  
to promise laying il before hia Parliament, was huddled  
lulo both Houses amongst a bundle of Americuu  
papers, aud there neglected. Tho Lords aud Com­  
mons in their address, in the mouth of February, said,  
that &quot; a rebellion at that time actually existed w it tun  
the province of Massachusetts-Bay, aud that those  
concerned ua it had been countenanced and en­  
couraged by unlawful combiua&#x27;.ious and engagements,  
entered into by his Majesty&#x27;s subjects in several of the  
other colonies ; ind therefore they besought his  
Majesty, that bo would take the most effectual meas­  
ures to enforce duo obedience to the laws aud au­  
thority of tho supremo legislature.&quot; Soon after the  
commercial intercourse of whole colonies, with foreign  
countries and with each other, was cut off by au act  
of Parliament ; by another, several of them were  
entirely prohibited from the fitheries in the aeaa near  
their coasts, on which they always depended for their  
sustenance ; and large reinforcements of ships aud  
troops were immediately sent over to General Lage.  
Fruitless were all the iutreaties, arguments and elo  
quence of an illustrious baud of the most distinguished  
Peers and Commoners, who nobly ana strenuously  
asserted the justice of our cause, to stay or even  
mitigate the heedless fury wttb which these accumuia  
ted and unexampled outrages were hurried on.  
Equally fruitless was the interference of the city of  
London, of Bristol, and many other respectable towns  
In our favor. 1 urliame nt adopted an insidious ma­  
noeuvre calculated to divide us, to establish a perpetual  
uctioo of taxation where colony should bid against  
colony, all of them nuiuformed what ransom would  
redeem their lives, and thus to exit rt from us at the  
point of the bayonet, the unknown sums that should  
be eufllcieut to gratify, if possible to gratify, minis  
terial rapacity, with the miserable indulgence left to  
ns of raising in our own mode the prescribed tribute,  
&quot;tt&#x27;hat terms mora rigid and humiliutiug could have  
been dictated by remorseless victors to conquered  
enemies t In our circumstances to accept them  
would be to deserve them  
Boon after the intelligence of these proceedings

tho infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding genera­  
tion to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits  
them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon  
Uiera.  
Our causa is just. Our onion is perfect. Our in-  
Urual resources are great, anil, if necessary, foreign  
assistance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully  
acknowledge, as signal instances of the Divine favour  
towards us, that his Providence would not permit us

Were grown up to our present strength, had been pre­

onr beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon

to assume, we will, in dehauce of every hazard, with  
tinabatiag firmness and perseverance, employ for the  
preservation of our liberties, being wiln one maid re

Lest this declaration should disquiet the minds of

between us, end fwhich we sincerely wish to -see

desperate measure, or Induced us to excite any-other  
atioo to war against them. We have pot raised  
armies with ambitious designs of separating from

Wo fight not for glory or for eouqnest. We exhibit

ies of Nartl mi, now  
Cangres of Phildelphia, setling forta the  
causes ond necemity of their tuling ts aems.  
It it was poss ble for men, who exers  
cise their resson to believe, that the dis  
vine Author of our existenes intended a  
part of the human sare to held an abselute  
properiy in, and an uabeunedpowerover  
others, marked out by his mfinins  
ess and wisdom, as the ofjects of a lesal  
dimination never righifully resiatible,  
however severe and oppressive, the in­  
habitants of these colonies might at least  
require from the parlesment of Grest-Brt  
thin some exidence, that this dreadiul st­  
thorty over them has been granted to  
thet body. But a reserence for our grest  
Creator, principles of bumanity, and the  
diet tes of common sense, must sonvine  
all those who reflect upon the subject, that  
government was insttuted to promote the  
welfare of mankind, and ought to be ad­  
ministered for the stiasnment of that end,  
The legiel ture of Great-Biitain, how-  
ever, stimulsied by an mnordinsis passion  
for a power not only unjus fieble, but  
which they know to be peculiarly repro­  
bated by the very consttution of that  
kingdom, and desperste of success in any  
mode of contest, where regard should be  
had t truth, law, or tight, have st length,  
deserting those, attempted to eff el their  
 cruel and imnoluic purpase of enslavin  
these colonies by tiolence, and have  
thereby rendered it necessary for us to  
close with their last sppeal from reason  
o arms. Yet, however blinded that as-  
sembly may be, by their intemp raye  
rage for unlimited domination, so to alight  
justice and the opinion of markind, we  
esteem ourseles bound by pbligstions of  
respect to the tes of the world, to make  
known the justice of our cause.  
Our farefathers, inhabitants of the isl-  
artefs&#x27;orbeit gadn&#x27;t lismtwe  
civil and rel-gious freecom. At the ex  
pense of their blood, at the hazard of their  
fortunes, without the least charge to the  
country from which they removed, by  
unceasing libor, and an unconquerible  
spirit, they effecied set lements in the dis­  
tant and inhospitable wilds of Americs,  
then filled with numerous and wardike ns-  
tions of barbarians. Societes or govern­  
ments, vested with perfect legultures,  
were formed under chatters from the  
crown, and an harmonious interechrse was  
stablished between the colontes and the  
kingdom from which they derived their or­  
igin. The muius! benefits of this unton be­  
came in a short time so extraordinary as to  
excite astonishment. It is universally con­  
tessed, that the amazing increase of the  
wealth, strength, and navigation of the  
realn, srose from this source; and the  
minister, who so wisely and sncces-fully  
direcied the measures of Great-Britain in  
the late war, publicly declared, that these  
colonies enabled her to trinmph over her  
enemies. Towards the conclusion of that  
war, it pleased our sovereign to make a  
change in his counsels. From that faisl  
woment, the affaus of the Brissh empire  
begin to fall isto conlusion, and gradae  
elihing from the sumint of glotious  
prospetity, to which thes had been ad­  
vanced by the virtues and abilities of one  
man, are at length distracted by the con  
vulsions, that now shake it to its deepest  
foundat ons. The new ministry finding  
the brave foes of Beitain, thugh frequent­  
ly defested, yet still contending, teuk up  
the unfortunate ides of granting the m a  
hsety peace, and of then subduing her  
faithtul friends,  
These devoted colonies a ere judgedt  
be in such a srate, as to priselt eictores  
 without bloodshed, and all the easy omos  
luments of statuteable plonder. The  
uninterrpted tenor of their pe-cable and  
reep ectful behavior from the beginning  
of colonization, their duttfol, zealons, and  
useful services during the war, though  
so recently and amply acknow ledged in  
the most honorable manner by his mays­  
ty the lae king, and by parliament, codd  
not save them from the meditated innova­  
tions. Parliament was influenced to as,  
dopt the pernicious project, and assuming  
a new power over them, have in the course  
of eleven vears given such decisive spe­  
cimens of the spirit and consequence  
attending this power, as to leave an doubt  
concerning the effects of acquiescence  
undert. They have undertaken to give  
and grant our money without our consent.  
hough we have ever exercised an exelu  
sive right to dispose of our own proper  
ty; Statutes have been passed for ex end  
ing the jorisdiction of courts of admiralty  
and vice-ad nialty beyond their ancient  
limits; for depriving us of the aecn-tomed  
and mestimable privlege of uiel by jary,

besieged the throne as supplicants;  
ressoned, ae temonsirsied with paglis­  
ment, in the inoet mild and decent lan

miee to enforee them. The indigustion  
of the Americans was roused, it is tree;  
ut it was the indignstion of s virtuous,  
nd affectionate people. A Con­  
gress of delegaies from the United Col  
hies was sssembled st Philadelphis, on  
  
the fifth day of list September. We re­  
solved sgain to offer so humble and dan­  
ful petition to the king, and slvo sddressed  
ur fellow-subjects of Grest Britain. W  
have pursued every temperste, svery ra-

to bresk eff our commercisl intercours  
with our fellow-rubjects, as the lagt pese  
ble semunition, that our sttschment to  
no nation upon earth showid supplant our  
suschment to liberty. This, we flattered  
  
urselves, was the ultimate step of th  
contgoversy; but subsequent events  
  
hown, how vain was this hops of find  
ing moderstion in our enemies.&quot;  
  
Several threstening axpressions again  
  
the colonies were inserted in his majes

told it was a decent one, and that his ma

therefore they besought his majesty, that  
he would take the most effeciusl me asures  
  
to enforce due obedience to the laws aud  
  
acthotity of the supreme legisisture.&quot;  
  
oon sfier, the commercial intercourse of  
whole colonies, with forsign countries and  
  
wiht each other, was cut off by an act of  
  
parliament; by abother several of them  
were entirely prohibited from the fisheries  
in the seas near their coasts, on which they  
slw ays depended for their sustenence; and  
farge reinforcements of ships and troops
