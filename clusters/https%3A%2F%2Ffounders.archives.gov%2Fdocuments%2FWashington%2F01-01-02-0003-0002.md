On Wednesday the 31st. of October 1753 I was Commission’d &amp; appointed by the Honble. Robert Dinwiddie Esqr. Governor &amp;ca. of Virginia To visit &amp; deliver a Letter to the Commandant of the French Forces on the Ohio, &amp; set out on the intended Journey the same Day. The next I arriv’d at Fredericksburg, &amp; engag’d Mr. Jacob Vanbraam, Interpreter,  
  
Jacob Van Braam, born about 1729 in Bergen op Zoom, Holland, had come to America in 1752, where he solicited employment as a teacher of French (Md. Gaz., 30 July 1752). In 1753 he was living in the vicinity of Fredericksburg. For his subsequent career, see entry for 2 April 1754.  
  
&amp; proceeded with him to Alexandria where we provided Necessaries. From thence we went to Winchester &amp; got Baggage Horses &amp;ca. &amp; from there we pursued the new Road to Wills Creek,  
  
Now Cumberland, Md.  
  
where we arriv’d the 14th: of November. Here I engag’d Mr. Gist

y 1757, DLC:GW).  
  
to Pilot us out, &amp; also hired four others as Servitors (vizt.) Barnaby Currin, &amp; John McGuier (Indian Traders) Henry Steward, &amp; William Jenkins;  
  
Barnaby Currin was a Pennsylvania trader who had been associated in the Indian trade with George Croghan. In 1750 he accompanied Gist on his explorations for the Ohio Company (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 35). Toner notes that McGuire (McGuier) served as a soldier from Fairfax County in 1754 (DLC: Toner Collection). Jenkins was frequently employed by Dinwiddie as a messenger.  
  
&amp; in Company with those Persons I left the Inhabitants the Day following. The excessive Rains &amp; vast Quantity of Snow that had fallen prevented our reaching Mr. Frazer’s, an Indian Trader at the Mouth of Turtle Creek, on Monongehela, ’til Thursday.  
  
John Fraser (Frazier), a Pennsylvania gunsmith and Indian trader, had established a trading post at Venango in the 1740s. Forced to leave by a French force that occupied the post in 1753, he resumed his trading operations at another trading post he had already established at the mouth of Turtle Creek on the Monongahela about ten miles above the present site of Pittsburgh (DONEHOOGeorge P. Donehoo. A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania. Harrisburg, Pa., 1928., 235–36).  
  
22d: We were inform’d here, that Expresses were sent a few Day’s ago to the Traders down the River to acquaint them with the General’s Death,  
  
Pierre Paul de La Malgue, sieur de Marin (1692–1753), commandant of the French army on the Ohio during its advance into the Ohio country in 1753, died at Fort Le Boeuf 29 Oct. 1753. Shortly before his death the major part of the French forces were sent into winter quarters; most returned to Montreal, except for a garrison force in the frontier forts (KENTDonald H. Kent. The French Invasion of Western Pennsylvania, 1753. Harrisburg, Pa., 1954., 64).  
  
&amp; return of Major Part of the French Army into Winter Quarters. The Waters were quite impassable, without Swimming our Horses, which oblig’d us to get the loan of a Canoe from Mr. Frazer, &amp; to send Barnaby Currin &amp; Henry Steward down Monongehela, with our Baggage to meet us at the Forks of Ohio, about 10 Miles to cross Allegany. As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, &amp; the Land in the Fork, which I think extreamly well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 Feet above the common Surface of the Water; &amp; a considerable Bottom of flat well timber’d Land all around it, very convenient for Building. The Rivers are each a quarter of a Mile, or more, across, &amp; run here very nigh at Right Angles; Allegany bearing N: E: &amp; Monongehela S: E: The former of these two is a very rapid swift running Water the other deep &amp; still, with scarce any perceptable Fall. About two Miles from this, on the S: E: Side of the River, at the Place where the Ohio Company intended to erect a Fort; lives Singess, King of the Delawars; We call’d upon him to invite him to Council at the Logstown.

 the Treaty of Lancaster.  
  
As I had taken a good deal of Notice Yesterday of the Situation at the Forks; my Curiosity led me to examine this more particularly; &amp; my Judgement [is] to think it greatly inferior, either for Defence or Advantages, especially the latter; For a Fort at the Forks wou’d be equally well situated on Ohio, &amp; have the entire  
  
Command of Monongehela, which runs up to our Settlements &amp; is extreamly well design’d for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep still Nature; besides a Fort at the Fork might be built at a much less Expence, than at the other Place. Nature has well contriv’d the lower Place for Water Defence, but the Hill whereon it must stand, being a quarter of a Mile in Length, &amp; then descending gradually on the Land Side, will render it difficult &amp; very expensive making a sufficient Fortification there. The whole Flat upon the Hill must be taken in, or the Side next the Descent made extreamly high; or else the Hill cut away: otherwise the Enemy will raise Batteries within that Distance, without being expos’d to a single Shot from the Fort. Singess attended us to Logstown, where we arriv’d between Sunsetting &amp; Dark, the 25th: Day after I left Williamsburg. We travel’d over some extream good &amp; bad Land to get to this Place. As soon as I came into Town, I went to Monacatoocha  
  
Monacatoocha, a pro-English Oneida chief also known as Scarouady, apparently ranking only below the Half-King in authority. He had been sent by the Six Nations to superintend the Shawnee at Logstown.

The Half-King, or Tanacharison, a Seneca chief, represented the Onondaga Council of the Six Nations among the Seneca. Considered one of the most reliable of England’s Indian allies, he was one of the most prominent of the Indian chiefs at the Treaty of Logstown in 1752 and accompanied GW on his 1754 expedition.

that I was sent a Messenger to the French General, &amp; was ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations, to acquaint them with it. I gave him a String of Wampum, &amp; a twist of Tobacco, &amp; desir’d him to send for the Half King; which he promis’d to do by a Runner in the Morning, &amp; for other Sachems. I invited him &amp; the other Great Men present to my Tent, where they stay’d an Hour &amp; return’d. According to the best Observations I cou’d make, Mr. Gist’s  
  
new Settlement (which we pass’d by) bears about W: N: W: 70 Miles from Wills Creek, Shanapins,  
  
Gist’s “new Settlement” was above the headwaters of Red Stone Creek in the vicinity of present-day Mount Braddock, Pa.  
  
  
  
  
Shanopin’s Town was a Delaware village near the Forks of the Ohio. When Gist was there on his journey for the Ohio Company in 1750, he found about 20 families living in the village (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 34).

I enquir’d into the Situation of the French on the Mississippi, their Number, &amp; what Forts they had Built: They inform’d me that there were four small Forts between New Orlians, &amp; the Black Islands,  
  
Van Braam, in translating the deserter’s information, understood Isles Noires for Illinois, which was at that time an administrative district of the province of Louisiana.  
  
Garrison’d with about 30 or 40 Men, &amp; a few small Pieces of Cannon in each. That at New Orlians, which is near the Mouth of the Mississippi, there is 35 Companies of 40 Men each, with a pretty strong Fort, mounting 8 large Carriage Guns; &amp; at the Black Islands there is several Companies, &amp; a Fort with 6 Guns. The Black Islands is about 130 Leagues above the Mouth of the Ohio, which is 150 above New Orlians: They also acquainted me, that there was a small Palisadoed Fort on the Ohio, at the Mouth of the Obaish,  
  
Either the deserters were misinformed, or Van Braam misinterpreted their information; the French had no fort at this place. The reference may have been to Vincennes.  
  
about 60 Leagues from the Mississippi: the Obaish heads near the West End of Lake Erie, &amp; affords the Communication between the French on Mississippi, &amp; those on the Lakes. These Deserters came up from the lower Shawnesse Town, with one Brown an Indian Trader, &amp; were going to Philadelphia.  
  
Lower Shawnee Town was located near present-day Portsmouth, Ohio. The Indian trader was possibly James Brown, who signed a treaty with the Indians at Logstown in May 1751 (PA. ARCH. COL. REC.Colonial Records of Pennsylvania. 16 vols. Harrisburg, 1840–53., 5:532).  
  
About 3 o’Clock this Evening the Half King came to Town; I went up &amp; invited him &amp; Davison privately to my Tent, &amp; desir’d him to relate some of the Particulars of his Journey to the French

King’s speeches and Marin’s replies reported in this source differ considerably from the account given to GW by the chief.  
  
He told me that the nearest &amp; levelest Way was now impassable, by reason of the many large miry Savannas; that we must be oblig’d to go by Venango,  
  
Venango was an important French trading and supply post at the juncture of French Creek and the Allegheny River. It is now Franklin, Pa.  
  
&amp; shou’d not get to the near Fort under 5 or 6 Nights Sleep, good Traveling. When he went to the Fort he said he was receiv’d in a very stern Manner by the late Commander, who ask’d him very abruptly, what he had come about, &amp; to declare his Business; which he says he did in the following Speech.   
FATHERS I am come to tell you your own Speeches, what your own Mouths have declar’d. FATHERS You in former Days set a Silver Bason before us wherein there was the Leg of a Beaver, and desir’d of all Nations to come &amp; eat of it; to eat in Peace &amp; Plenty, &amp; not to be Churlish to one another; &amp; that if any such Person shou’d be found to be a Disturber; I here lay down by the Edge  
  
of the Dish a rod, which you must Scourge them with; &amp; if Me your Father shou’d get Foolish in my old Days, I desire you may use it upon me as well as others.  
NOW FATHERS it is you that is the Disturber in this Land, by coming &amp; building your Towns, and taking it away unknown to us &amp; by Force. FATHERS We kindled a Fire a long Time ago at a Place call’d Morail,  
  
Presumably the Half-King is referring to the council held at Montreal in 1732 between the French administration and the Shawnee and the Seneca.  
  
where we desir’d you to stay, &amp; not to come &amp; intrude upon our Land. I now desire you may dispatch to that Place; for be it known to you Fathers, this is our Land, &amp; not yours. FATHERS I desire you may hear me in Civilness; if not, We must handle that rod which was laid down for the Use of the obstropulous. If you had come in a peaceable Manner like our Brothers the English, We shou’d not have been against your trading with us as they do, but to come Fathers, &amp; build great Houses upon our Land, &amp; to take it by Force, is what we cannot submit to.  
FATHERS Both you &amp; the English are White. We live in a Country between, therefore the Land does not belong either to one or the other; but the GREAT BEING above allow’d it to be a Place of residence for us; so Fathers, I desire you to withdraw, as I have done our Brothers the English, for I will keep you at Arm’s length. I lay this down as a Tryal for both, to see which will have the greatest regard to it, &amp; that Side we will stand by, &amp; make equal Sharers with us: Our Brothers the English have heard this, &amp; I come now to tell it to you, for I am not affraid to discharge you off this Land. This, he said, was the Substance of what he said to the General, who made this Reply.  
NOW MY CHILD I have heard your Speech. You spoke first, but it is my Time to speak now. Where is my Wampum that you took away, with the Marks of Towns in it? This Wampum I do not know, which you have discharg’d me off the Land with; but you need not put yourself to the Trouble of Speaking for I will not hear you: I am not affraid of Flies or Musquito’s; for Indians are such as those; I tell you down that River I will go, &amp; will build upon it according to my Command: If the River was ever so block’d up, I have Forces sufficient to burst it open, &amp; tread under my Feet all that stand in Opposition together with their Alliances; for my Force is as the Sand upon the Sea Shoar: therefore here is your Wampum, I fling it at you. Child, you talk foolish; you say this Land belongs to you, but there is not the  
  
Black of my Nail yours, I saw that Land sooner than you did, before the Shawnesse &amp; you were at War: Lead

8.  
  
They also ask’d what sort of a Boy it was that was taken from the South Branch; for they had, by some Indians heard, that a Party of French Indians had carried a White Boy by the Cuscusa Town, towards the Lakes.  
  
This may have been the child referred to by Claude Pierre Pécaudy, sieur de Contrecoeur, who informed the commander of the British forces on the Ohio that, learning that Indians of the Six Nations “had fallen upon, and destroyed an English Family towards Carolina; he stopped their Passage, and obliged them to deliver him up a little Boy belonging to that Family, and who was the only one left alive; he was brought back to Boston” (MEMOIR[Jacob Nicolas Moreau].

“Cuscusa” is a reference to Kuskuskies, a Delaware village in the vicinity of present-day New Castle, Pa.  
  
26th: We met in council at the Long House, about 9 o’Clock, where I spoke to them as follows,   
BROTHERS I have call’d you together in Council, by Order of your Brother the Governor of Virginia, to acquaint you that I am sent with all possible Dispatch to visit &amp; deliver a Letter to the French Commandant of very great Importance to your Brothers the English: &amp; I dare say to your their Friends &amp; Allies. I was desir’d Brothers, by your Brother the Governor, to call upon you, the Sachems of the Six Nations, to inform you of it, &amp; to ask your Advice &amp; Assistance to proceed the nearest &amp; best Road to the French. You see Brothers I have got thus far on my Journey. His Honour likewise desir’d me to apply to you for some of your young Men to conduct and provide Provisions for us on our Way: &amp; to be a Safeguard against those French Indians, that have taken up the Hatchet against us. I have spoke this particularly to you Brothers, because His Hon. our Governor, treats you as good  
  
Friends &amp; allies, &amp; holds you in great Esteem. To confirm what I have said I give you this String of Wampum.  
After they had considered some Time on the above, the Half King got up &amp; spoke.   
NOW MY BROTHERS. In Regard to what my Brother the Governor has desir’d of me, I return you this Answer. I rely upon you as a Brother ought to do, as you say we are Brothers, &amp; one People. We shall put Heart in Hand, &amp; speak to our Fathers the French, concerning the Speech they made to me, &amp; you may depend that we will endeavour to be your Guard.  
BROTHER, as you have ask’d my Advice, I hope you will be ruled by it, &amp; stay ’til I can provide a Company to go with you. The French Speech Belt is not here, I have it to go for to my hunting Cabbin likewise the People I have order’d are not yet come, nor can ’til the third Night from this, ’till which Time Brother I must beg you to stay. I intend to send a Guard of Mingoes, Shawnesse, &amp; Delawar’s, that our Brothers may see the Love and Loyalty We bear them.  
As I had Orders to make all possible Dispatch, &amp; waiting here very contrary to my Inclinations; I thank’d him in the most suitable Manner I cou’d, &amp; told that my Business requir’d the greatest Expedition, &amp; wou’d not admit of that Delay: He was not well pleas’d that I shou’d offer to go before the Time he had appointed, &amp; told me that he cou’d not consent to our going without a Guard, for fear some Accident shou’d befall us, &amp; draw a reflection upon him—besides says he, this is a Matter of no small Moment, &amp; must not be enter’d into without due Consideration, for I now intend to deliver up the French Speech Belt, &amp; make the Shawnesse &amp; Delawars do the same, &amp; accordingly gave Orders to King Singess, who was present, to attend on Wednesday Night with the Wampum, &amp; two Men to their Nation to be in readiness to set off with us next Morning. As I found it impossible to get off without affronting them in the most egregious Manner, I consented to stay. I gave them back a String of Wampum that I met with at Mr. Frazer’s, which they had sent with a Speech to his Honour the Governor, to inform him, that three Nations of French Indians, (vizt.) Chippaway’s, Ottaway’s, &amp; Arundacks, had taken up the Hatchet against the English, &amp; desired them to repeat it over again; which they postpon’d doing ’til they met in full Council with the Shawnesse, &amp; Delawar Chiefs.  27th: Runners were dispatch’d very early for the Shawness Chiefs, the Half King set out himself to fetch the French Speech Belt from his hunting Cabbin.

28th: He return’d this Evening, &amp; came with Monacatoocha &amp; two other Sachems to my Tent, &amp; beg’d (as they had comply’d with his Honour the Governor’s Request in providing Men, &amp;ca.) to know what Business we were going to the French about? This was a Question I all along expected, &amp; had provided as satisfactory Answers as I cou’d, which allay’d their Curiosity a little. Monacatoocha Informed me, that an Indian from Venango brought News a few Days ago; that the French had call’d all the Mingo’s, Delawar’s &amp;ca. together at that Place, &amp; told them that they intended to have been down the River this Fall, but the Waters were geting Cold, &amp; the Winter advancing, which obliged them to go into Quarters; but they might assuredly expect them in the Spring, with a far greater Number; &amp; desired that they might be quite Passive, &amp; not intermeddle, unless they had a mind to draw all their Force upon them; for that they expected to fight the English three Years, (as they suppos’d there would be some Attempts made to stop them) in which Time they shou’d Conquer, but if they shou’d prove equally strong, that they &amp; the English wou’d join to cut them off, &amp; divide the Land between them: that though they had lost their General, &amp; some few of their Soldiers, yet there was Men enough to reinforce, &amp; make them Masters of the Ohio. This Speech, he said, was deliver’d to them by an Captn. Joncaire, their Interpreter in Chief, living at Venango, &amp; a Man of Note in the Army.

s at Venango about 1 Dec. 1753.  
  
29th: The Half King and Monacatoocha came very early &amp;  
  
beg’d me to stay one Day more, for notwithstanding they had used all the Diligence in their Power, the Shawnesse Chiefs had not brought the Wampum they order’d, but wou’d certainly be in to Night, if not they wou’d delay me no longer, but send it after us as soon as they arriv’d: When I found them so pressing in their request; &amp; knew that returning of Wampum, was the abolishing of Agreements; &amp; giving this up was shaking of all Dependence upon the French, I consented to stay, as I believ’d an Offence offer’d at this Crisis, might have been attended with greater ill Consequence than another Day’s Delay. They also inform’d me that Singess cou’d not get in his Men, &amp; was prevented from coming himself by His Wife’s Sickness, (I believe by fear of the French) but that the Wampum of that Nation was lodg’d with Custaloga, one of their Chiefs at Venango.  
  
Custaloga was a Delaware chief. Custaloga’s Town (Meadville, Pa.) was on the west side of French Creek. In July 1753 Pennsylvania trader William Trent noted that Custaloga’s people were helping the French move their supplies across the Presque Isle portage (DARLINGTONMary Carson Darlington, ed. History of Colonel Henry Bouquet and the Western Frontiers of Pennsylvania, 1747–1764. Privately printed, 1920., 18–19). By 1754 the chief was openly supporting the French.  
  
In the Evening they came again, &amp; acquainted me that the Shawnesse were not yet come, but it shou’d not retard the Prosecution of our Journey. He deliver’d in my Hearing the Speeches that were to be made to the French by Jeskakake, one of their old Chiefs,  
  
Jeskakake is presumably the Cayuga referred to in PAPIERS CONTRECOEURFernand Grenier, ed. Papiers Contrecœur et autres documents concernant le conflit anglo-français sur l’Ohio de 1745 à 1756. Quebec, 1952., 189, as Déjiquéqué. He became a supporter of the French and was given for his services a commission de chef in June 1754.  
  
which was giving up the Belt the late Commandant had ask’d for, &amp; repeating near the same Speech he himself had done before. He also deliver’d a String of Wampum to this Chief, which was sent by King Singess to be given to Custaloga, with Orders to repair to, &amp; deliver up the French Wampum. He likewise gave a very large String of black &amp; white Wampum, which was to be sent immediately up to the Six Nations, if the French refus’d to quit the Land at this Warning, which was the third &amp; last Time, &amp; was the right of this Jeskakake to deliver. 30th: Last Night the great Men assembled to their Council House to consult further about this Journey, &amp; who were to go; the result of which was, that only three of their Chiefs, with one of their best Hunters shou’d be our Convoy: the reason they gave for not sending more, after what had been propos’d in Council the 26th. was, that a greater Number might give the French Suspicion of some bad Design, &amp; cause them to be treated rudely; but I rather think they cou’d not get their Hunters in.  We set out about 9 o’Clock, with the Half King, Jeskakake, White Thunder, &amp; the Hunter;  
  
White Thunder, or Belt of Wampum, was an Iroquois chief (SARGENT [1]Winthrop Sargent, ed. The History of an Expedition against Fort Du Quesne, in 1755; under Major-General Edward Braddock, Generalissimo of H.B.M. Forces in America. Philadelphia, 1856., 378).

 where we were kindly and complaisantly received by Monsieur Joncaire, the French interpreter for the Six Nations” (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 81).  
  
This is an old Indian Town, situated on the Mouth of French Creek on Ohio, &amp; lies near No. about 60 Miles from the Logstown, but more than 70 the Way we were oblig’d to come. We found the French Colours hoisted at a House where they drove Mr. John Frazer an English Subject from: I immediately repair’d to it, to know where the Commander resided: There was three Officers, one of which, Capt. Joncaire, inform’d me, that he had the Command of the Ohio, but that there was a General Officer at the next Fort, which he advis’d me to for an Answer. He invited us to Sup with them, &amp; treated with the greatest Complaisance. The Wine, as they dos’d themselves pretty plentifully with it, soon banish’d the restraint which at first appear’d in their Conversation, &amp; gave license to their Tongues to reveal their Sentiments more freely. They told me it was their absolute Design to take Possession of the Ohio, &amp; by G—— they wou’d do it, for tho’ they were sensible, that the English cou’d raise two Men for their one; yet they knew their Motions were too slow &amp; dilatory to prevent any Undertaking of theirs. They pretended to have an undoubted right to the river from a Discovery made by one La Sol 60 Years ago, &amp; the use of this Expedition is to prevent our Settling on the River or Waters of it, as they have heard of some Families moving out in order thereto. From the best Intelligence I cou’d get, there has been 1,500 Men this Side Oswago Lake, but upon the Death of the General, all were recall’d to about 6 or 7 Hundred, which were left to Garrison four Forts, 150 or thereabouts in each, the first of which is on French Creek, near a small Lake, about 60 Miles from Venango near N: N: W: the next lies on Lake Erie, where the greatest Part of their Stores are kept about 15 Miles from the other; from that it is 120 Miles from the Carrying Place, at the  
  
Fall of Lake Erie, where there is a small Fort, which they lodge their Goods at, in bringing them from Morail, the Place that all their Stores come from; the next Fort lies about 20 Miles from this, on Oswago Lake; between this Fort &amp; Morail there are three others; the first of which is near the English Fort Oswago. From the Fort on Lake Erie to Morail is about 600 Miles, which they say if good Weather, requires no more than 4 Weeks Voyage, if they go in Barks or large Vessells that they can cross the Lake; but if they come in Canoes, it will require five or six Weeks for they are oblig’d to keep under the Shoar. 5th: Rain’d successively all Day, which prevented our traveling. Capt. Joncaire sent for the half King, as he had but just heard  
  
that he came with me: He affected to be much Concern’d that I did not make free to bring him in before; I excused it in the best Manner I was capable, &amp; told him I did not think their Company agreeable, as I had heard him say a good deal in dispraise of Indians in General. But another Motive prevented my bringing them into his Company: I knew that he was Interpreter, &amp; a Person of very great Influence among the Indians, &amp; had lately used all possible means to draw them over to their Interest; therefore I was desirous of giving no more Opportunity than cou’d be avoided. When they came in there was great Pleasure express’d at seeing them, he wonder’d how they cou’d be so near without coming to visit him, made several trifling Presents, &amp; applied Liquors so fast, that they were soon render’d incapable of the Business they came about notwithstanding the Caution that was given.

6th: The Half King came to my Tent quite Sober, &amp; insisted very much that I shou’d stay &amp; hear what he had to say to the French. I fain wou’d have prevented his speaking any Thing ’til he came to the Commandant, but cou’d not prevail. He told me that at this Place Council Fire was kindled, where all their Business with these People were to be transacted, &amp; that the Management of the Indian Affairs was left solely to Monsieur Joncaire. As I was desirous of knowing the Issue of this, I agreed to stay, but sent our Horses a little Way up French Creek, to raft over &amp; Camp, which I knew wou’d make it near Night. About 10 oClock they met in Council, the King spoke much the same as he had done to the General, &amp; offer’d the French Speech Belt which had before been demanded, with the Marks of four Towns in it, which Monsieur Joncaire refused to receive; but desired him to carry it to the Fort to the Commander. 7th: Monsieur La Force, Commissary of the French Stores,  
  
Michel Pépin, called La Force, was captured by the British near Great Meadows in the spring of 1754 and sent to Williamsburg as a hostage after the surrender of Fort Necessity. His abilities were as respected by the British as by the French: “looseing La Force, I really think, w’d tend more to our disservice, than 50 other Men, as he is a Person whose active Spirit, leads him into all parlys, and brought him acquainted with all parts, add to this a perfect use of the Indian Tongue, and g’t influence with the Indians” (GW to Dinwiddie, 29 May 1754, DLC:GW).  
  
&amp;  
  
three other Soldiers came over to accompany us up. We found it extreamly difficult getting the Indians off to Day; as every Stratagem had been used to prevent their going up with me. I had last Night left John Davison (the Indian Interpreter that I brought from Logstown with me) strictly charg’d not to be out of their Company, as I cou’d not get them over to my Tent (they having some Business with Custaloga, to know the reason why he did not deliver up the French Belt, which he had in keeping,) but was oblig’d to send Mr. Gist over to Day to fetch them, which he did with great Perswasion. At 11 o’Clock we set out for the Fort, &amp; was prevented from arriving there ’till the 11th: by excessive rains, Snows, &amp; bad traveling, through many Mires &amp; Swamps, which we were oblig’d to pass to avoid crossing the Creek, which was impassible either by Fording or Rafting, the Water was so high &amp; rapid. We pass’d over much good Land since we left Venango, &amp; through several extensive &amp; very rich Meadows, one of which was near 4 Miles in length, &amp; considerably wide in some Places.

This Commander is a Knight of the Military Order of St: Lewis, &amp; named Legadieur St. Piere, he is an elderly Gentleman, &amp; has much the Air of a Soldier; he was sent over to take the Command immediately upon the Death of the late General, &amp; arriv’d here about 7 Days before me. At 2 o’Clock the Gentleman that was sent for arriv’d, when I offer’d the Letters &amp;ca. again, which they receiv’d, &amp; adjourn’d into a private Appartment for the Captain to translate, who understood a little English, after he had done it, the Captain desir’d I wou’d walk in &amp; bring my Interpreter to peruse &amp; correct it, which I did.  
  
Gist’s diary entry for this day reads:  
  
  
  
  
“Wednesday 12.—The Major gave the passport, showed his commission, and offered the Governor’s letter to the commandant; but he desired not to receive them, until the other commander from Lake Erie came, whom he had sent for, and expected next day by twelve o’clock” (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 83).  
  
13th: The chief Officer retired to hold a Council of War, which gave me an Opportunity of taking the Dimensions of the Fort, &amp; making what Observations I cou’d. It is situated on the South or West Fork of French Creek, near the Water, &amp; is almost surrounded by the Creek, &amp; a small Branch of it which forms a Kind of an Island, as may be seen by a Plan I have here ann

n that Manner &amp; of that Dimensions. 4 Houses compose the Sides; the Bastions are made of Piles drove into the Ground, &amp; about 12 Feet above sharpe at Top, with Port Holes cut for Cannon &amp; Small Arms to fire through; there are Eight 6 lb. Pieces Mounted, two in each Bastion, &amp; one of 4 lb. before the Gate: In the Bastions are a Guard House, Chapel, Doctor’s Lodgings, &amp; the Commander’s private Store, round which is laid Platforms for the Cannon &amp; Men to stand on: there is several Barracks without the Fort for the Soldiers dwelling, cover’d some with Bark, &amp; some with Boards, &amp; made chiefly of Logs, there is also several other Houses such as Stables, Smiths Shop &amp;ca: all of which I have laid down exactly as they stand, &amp; shall refer to the Plan for Explanation. I cou’d get no certain Account of the Number of Men here; but according to the best Judgement I cou’d form, there is an Hundred exclusive of Officers, which are pretty many. I also gave Orders to the People that were with me, to take an exact Account of the Canoes that were haled up, to convey their Forces down in the Spring, which they did, and told 50 of Birch Bark, &amp; 170 of Pine; besides many others that were block’d out, in Readiness to make.  
  
The entry for this day in Gist’s diary states:  
  
  
  
  
“Thursday 13.—The other General came. The Major delivered the letter, and desired a speedy answer; the time of year and business required it. They took our Indians into private council, and gave them several presents” (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 83).  
  
14th: As the Snow increased very fast, &amp; our Horses daily got weaker, I sent them off unloaded, under the Care of Barnaby Currin &amp; two others, to make all convenient Dispatch to Venango, &amp; there wait our Arrival, if there was a Prospect of the Rivers Freezing, if not, then to continue down to Shanapin’s Town at the Forks of Ohio, &amp; there wait ’till we came to cross Allegany; intending my Self to go down by Water, as I had the Offer of a Canoe or two. As I found many Plots concerted to retard the Indians Business, &amp; prevent their returning with me, I endeavour’d all in my Power to frustrate their Schemes, &amp; hurry them on to execute their intended Design. They accordingly pressed for admittance this Evening, which at length was granted them privately with the Commander, &amp; one or two other Officers. The Half King told me that he offer’d the Wampum to the Commander, who evaded taking it, &amp; made many fair Promises of Love &amp; Friendship; said he wanted to live in Peace &amp; trade amicably with them; as a Proof of which, he wou’d send some Goods immediately down to the Logstown for them, but I rather think the Design of that is to bring away all of our stragling traders that they may meet with; as I privately understood they intended to carry an Officer, &amp;ca. with them; &amp; what rather confirms this Opinion, I was enquiring of the Commander by what Authority he had taken &amp; made Prisoners of several of our English Subjects. He told me the Country belong’d to them, that no English Man had a right to trade upon them Waters; &amp; that he had Orders to make every Person Prisoner that attempted it on the Ohio or the Waters of it. I enquir’d of Capt. Riparti about the Boy that was carried by, as it was done while the Command devolved upon him, between the Death of the late General &amp; the Arrival of the Present. He acknowledg’d that a Boy had been carried past, &amp; that the Indians had two or three white Scalps, (I was told by some of the Indians at Venango 8) but pretended to have forgot the Name of the Place that the Boy came from, &amp; all the Particulars, tho’ he Question’d him for some Hours as they were carrying him past. I likewise enquired where &amp; what they had done with John Trotter, &amp; James McClocklan, two Pensylvania Traders, which they had  
  
taken with all their Goods: they told me that they had been sent to Canada, but were now return’d Home.  
  
See note 41.  
  
This Evening I receiv’d an Answer to His Honour the Governor’s Letter from the Commandant.

“As I have the honor of commanding here in chief, Mr. Washington delivered me the letter which you wrote to the commander of the French troops.  
  
  
  
  
“I should have been glad if you had given him orders, or he had been inclined, to proceed to Canada to see our General, to whom it belongs, rather than to me, to set forth the evidence and the reality of the rights of the King, my master, to the lands situated along the Belle Rivière, and to contest the pretensions of the King of Great Britain thereto.

“As to the summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it. Whatever may be your instructions, I am here by virtue of the orders of my General, and I entreat you, Sir, not to doubt for a moment that I have a firm resolution to follow them with all the exactness and determination which can be expected of the best officer.  
  
  
  
  
“I do not know that anything has happened in the course of this campaign which can be construed as an act of hostility, or as contrary to the treaties between the two Crowns; the continuation of which interests and pleases us as much as it does the English. If you had been pleased, Sir, to go into detail regarding the deeds which caused your complaints, I should have had the honor of answering you in the most positive manner, and I am sure that you would have had reason to be satisfied.  
  
  
  
  
“I have made it a particular duty to receive Mr. Washington with the distinction owing to your dignity, his position, and his own great merit.

15th: The Commander order’d a plentiful Store of Liquor, Provisions &amp; ca. to be put on board our Canoe, &amp; appear’d to be extreamly complaisant, though he was ploting every Scheme that the Devil &amp; Man cou’d invent, to set our Indians at Variance with us, to prevent their going ’till after our Departure. Presents, rewards, &amp; every Thing that cou’d be suggested by him or his  
  
Officers was not neglected to do. I can’t say that ever in my Life I suffer’d so much Anxiety as I did in this affair: I saw that every Stratagem that the most fruitful Brain cou’d invent: was practis’d to get the Half King won to their Interest, &amp; that leaving of him here, was giving them the Opportunity they aimed at: I went to the Half King and press’d him in the strongest Terms to go. He told me the Commander wou’d not discharge him ’till the Morning; I then went to the Commander &amp; desired him to do their Business, &amp; complain’d of ill Treatment; for keeping them, as they were Part of my Company was detaining me, which he promis’d not to do, but to forward my Journey as much as he cou’d: He protested he did not keep them but was innocent of the Cause of their Stay; though I soon found it out. He had promis’d them a Present of Guns, &amp;ca. if they wou’d wait ’till the Morning. As I was very much press’d by the Indians to wait this Day for them; I consented on a Promise that Nothing shou’d hinder them in the Morning. 16th: The French were not slack in their Inventions to keep the Indians this Day also; but as they were obligated, according to promise, to give the Present: they then endeavour’d to try the Power of Liquor; which I doubt not wou’d have prevail’d at any other Time than this, but I tax’d the King so close upon his Word that he refrain’d, &amp; set off with us as he had engag’d. We had a tedious &amp; very fatiguing Passage down the Creek, several Times we had like to have stove against Rocks, &amp; many Times were oblig’d all Hands to get out, &amp; remain in the Water Half an Hour or more, getting her over the Shoals: on one Place the Ice had lodg’d &amp; made it impassable by Water; therefore we were oblig’d to carry our Canoe across a neck Land a quarter of a Mile over. We did not reach Venango ’till the 22d: where we met with our Horses. This Creek is extreamly crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort &amp; Venango can’t be less than 130 Miles to follow the Meanders.

23d: When I got Things ready to set off I sent for the Half King, to know whether they intended to go with us, or by Water. He told me that the White Thunder had hurt himself much, &amp; was Sick &amp; unable to walk, therefore he was oblig’d to carry him down in a Canoe: As I found he intended to stay a Day or two here, &amp; knew that Monsieur Joncaire wou’d employ every Scheme to set him against the English, as he had before done; I told him I hoped he wou’d guard against his Flattery, &amp; let no fine Speeches Influence Him in their Favour: He desired I might not be concern’d, for he knew the French too well, for any Thing to engage him in their Behalf, &amp; though he cou’d not go down with us, he wou’d endeavour to meet at the Forks with Joseph Campbell,  
  
Campbell was an unlicensed Pennsylvania trader in 1747 and 1748, employed by Alexander Moorhead. He was represented by George Croghan to be “a bad man, and corrupted by the French” (PA. ARCH. COL. REC.Colonial Records of Pennsylvania. 16 vols. Harrisburg, 1840–53., 5:693). He was killed by an Indian of the Six Nations at Parnell’s Knob in Sept. 1754 (PA. ARCH.Samuel Hazard et al., eds. Pennsylvania Archives. 9 ser., 138 vols. Philadelphia and Harrisburg, 1852–1949., 1st ser., 2:173).  
  
to deliver a Speech for me to carry to his Honour the Governor. He told me he wou’d order the young Hunter to attend us, &amp; get Provision &amp;ca. if wanted. Our Horses were now so weak &amp; feeble, &amp; the Baggage heavy; as we were oblig’d to provide all the Necessaries the Journey wou’d require, that we doubted much their performing it; therefore my Self &amp; others (except the Drivers which were oblig’d to ride) gave up our Horses for Packs, to assist along with the Baggage; &amp; put my Self into an Indian walking Dress, &amp; continue’d with them three Day’s, ’till I found there  
  
was no Probability of their getting in, in any reasonable Time; the Horses grew less able to travel every Day. The Cold increas’d very fast, &amp; the Roads were geting much worse by a deep Snow continually Freezing; And as I was uneasy to get back to make a report of my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor; I determin’d to prosecute my Journey the nearest way through the Woods on Foot. Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in Charge of our Baggage, with Money and Directions to provide Necessaries from Place to Place for themselves &amp; Horses &amp; to make the most convenient Dispatch in. I took my necessary Papers, pull’d off my Cloths; tied My Self up in a Match Coat; &amp; with my Pack at my back, with my Papers &amp; Provisions in it, &amp; a Gun, set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same Manner, on Wednesday the 26th. The Day following, just after we had pass’d a Place call’d the Murdering Town  
  
Murdering Town, or Murthering Town, was a Delaware village on Conoquenessing Creek, a subsidiary of Beaver Creek. According to Gist’s diary it was about 15 miles from Logstown (GISTWilliam M. Darlington, ed. Christopher Gist’s Journals with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries. Pittsburgh, 1893., 81).  
  
where we intended to quit the Path &amp; steer across the Country for Shanapins Town, we fell in with a Party of French Indians, which had laid in wait for us, one of them fired at Mr. Gist or me, not 15 Steps, but fortunately missed. We took this Fellow into Custody, &amp; kept him ’till about 9 o’Clock at Night, &amp; then let him go, &amp; then walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making any Stop; that we might get the start, so far as to be out of the reach of their Pursuit next Day, as were well assur’d they wou’d follow upon our Tract as soon as it was Light: The next Day we continued traveling ’till it was quite Dark, &amp; got to the River about two Miles above Shanapins; we expected to have found the River Froze, but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shoar; the Ice I suppose had broke up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities. There was no way for us to get over but upon a Raft, which we set about with but one poor Hatchet, &amp; got finish’d just after Sunsetting, after a whole days Work: We got it launch’d, &amp; on board of it, &amp; sett off; but before we got half over, we were jamed in the Ice in such a Manner, that we expected every Moment our Raft wou’d sink, &amp; we Perish; I put out my seting Pole, to try to stop the Raft, that the Ice might pass by, when the Rapidity of the Stream through it with so much Violence against the Pole, that it Jirk’d me into 10 Feet Water, but I fortunately saved my Self by catching hold of one of the Raft Logs. Notwithstanding all our Efforts we cou’d not get the Raft to either Shoar, but were oblig’d, as we were pretty near an Island, to quit our Raft &amp;  
  
wade to it. The Cold was so extream severe, that Mr. Gist got all his Fingers, &amp; some of his Toes Froze, &amp; the Water was shut up so hard, that We found no Difficulty in getting off the Island on the Ice in the Morning, &amp; went to Mr. Frazers. We met here with 20 Warriors that had been going to the Southward to War, but coming to a Place upon the Head of the Great Cunnaway, where they found People kill’d &amp; Scalpt, all but one Woman with very Light Hair, they turn’d about; &amp; ran back, for fear of the Inhabitants rising &amp; takeing them as the Authors of the Murder: They report that the People were lying about the House, &amp; some of them much torn &amp; eat by Hogs; by the Marks that were left, they say they were French Indians of the Ottaway Nation, &amp;ca. that did it.

, that we could hardly get water to drink.  
  
  
  
  
“Thursday 27.—We rose early in the morning, and set out about two o’clock. Got to the Murthering town, on the southeast fork of Beaver creek. Here we met with an Indian, whom I thought I had seen at Joncaire’s, at Venango, when on our journey up to the French fort. This fellow called me by my Indian name, and pretended to be glad to see me. He asked us several questions, as how we came to travel on foot, when we left Venango, where we parted with our horses, and when they would be there, etc. Major Washington insisted on travelling on the nearest way to forks of Alleghany. We asked the Indian if he could go with us, and show us the nearest way. The Indian seemed very glad and ready to go with us. Upon which we set out, and the Indian took the Major’s pack. We travelled very brisk for eight or ten miles, when the Major’s feet grew very sore, and he very weary, and the Indian steered too much north-eastwardly. The Major desired to encamp, to which the Indian asked to carry his gun. But he refused that, and then the Indian grew churlish, and pressed us to keep on, telling us that there were Ottawa Indians in these woods, and they would scalp us if we lay out; but to go to his cabin, and we should be safe. I thought very ill of the fellow, but did not care to let the Major know I mistrusted him. But he soon mistrusted him as much as I. He said he could hear a gun to his cabin, and steered us more northwardly. We grew uneasy, and then he said two whoops might be heard to his cabin. We went two miles further; then the Major said he would stay at the next water, and we desired the Indian to stop at the next water. But before we came to water, we came to a clear meadow; it was very light, and snow on the ground. The Indian made a stop, turned about; the Major saw him point his gun toward us and fire. Said the Major, ‘Are you shot?’ ‘No,’ said I. Upon which the Indian ran forward to a big standing white oak, and to loading his gun; but we were soon with him. I would have killed him; but the Major would not suffer me to kill him. We let him charge his gun; we found he put in a ball; then we took care of him. The Major or I always stood by the guns; we made him make a fire for us by a little run, as if we intended to sleep there. I said to the Major, ‘As you will not have him killed, we must get him away, and then we must travel all night.’ Upon which I said to the Indian, ‘I suppose you were lost, and fired your gun.’ He said, he knew the way to his cabin, and ’twas but a little way. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘do you go home; and as we are much tired, we will follow your track in the morning; and here is a cake of bread for you, and you must give us meat in the morning.’ He was glad to get away. I followed him, and listened until he was fairly out of the way, and then we set out about half a mile, when we made a fire, set our compass, and fixed our course, and travelled all night, and in the morning we were on the head of Piney creek.

arge. He assures me that they had begun another Fort at the Mouth of the Creek, which he thinks will be finish’d by the Month of March. There were in the Fort where the Commander resided, about 300 regular Forces; &amp; nine hundred more were gone to Winter Quarters (in order to save their Provisions) to some Forts on Lake Erie &amp;ca. but that they were to return by the Month of March; then they fully determin’d with all the Forces they cou’d collect, which he understood wou’d be fifteen hundred regulars, besides Indians, to go down the River Ohio, &amp; propose building many other Forts, &amp; that their chief residence wou’d be at the Logstown; &amp; that they had near three hundred Canoes to transport their Soldiers, Provisions &amp; Ammunition &amp;ca.” (P.R.O., C.O.5/1328, ff. 43–44).  
  
  
  
  
Almost immediately upon GW’s return to Williamsburg, Dinwiddie ordered publication of his journal. It appeared as The Journal of Major George Washington, Sent by the Hon. Robert Dinwiddie, Esq; His Majesty’s Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief of Virginia, to the Commandant of the French Forces on Ohio. To Which Are Added, the Governor’s Letter, and a Translation of the French Officer’s Answer (Williamsburg: William Hunter, 1754). GW prefaced the publication with the following “Advertisement”:  
  
  
  
  
“As it was thought adviseable by his Honour the Governor to have the following Account of my Proceedings to and from the French on Ohio, committed to Print; I think I can do no less than apologize, in some Measure, for the numberless Imperfections of it.  
  
  
  
  
“There intervened but one Day between my Arrival in Williamsburg, and the Time for the Council’s Meeting, for me to prepare and transcribe, from the rough Minutes I had taken in my Travels, this Journal; the writing of which only was sufficient to employ me closely the whole Time, consequently admitted of no Leisure to consult of a new and proper Form to offer it in, or to correct or amend the Diction of the old; neither was I apprised, or  
  
did in the least conceive, when I wrote this for his Honour’s Perusal, that it ever would be published, or even have more than a cursory Reading; till I was informed, at the Meeting of the present General Assembly, that it was already in the Press.  
  
  
  
  
“There is nothing can recommend it to the Public, but this. Those Things which came under the Notice of my own Observation, I have been explicit and just in a Recital of:—Those which I have gathered from Report, I have been particularly cautious not to augment, but collected the Opinions of the several Intelligencers, and selected from the whole, the most probable and consistent Account.

We were informed here, that Expreſſes had been

River, to acquaint them with the French General&#x27;s  
Death, and the Return of the major Part of the  
French Army into Winter Quarters.  
  
The Waters were quite impaſſable, without  
ſwimming our Horſes; which obliged us to get  
the Loan of a Canoe from Frazier, and to ſend  
Barnaby Currin, and Henry Steward, down the  
Monongabela, with. our Baggage, to meet us at

As had taken a good deal of Notice ROY  
of the Situation at the Forks, my Curioſity led me  
to examine this more particularly, and I think  
it greatly inferior, either for Defence or Advanta-  
ges; eſpecially the latter: For a Fort at the Forks  
would. be equally well ſituated on the Ohio, and have  
the entire Command of the Monongabela ; which runs  
722 to our Settlements and is extremely well de-  
ned for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep ſtill

at a much leſs Expence, than at the other Place. —  
Nature has well contrived this lower Place, for  
Water Defence; but the Hill whereon it muſt ſtand  
hel ng about a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and  
en deſcending gradually on the. Land Side, will  
render it difficult, and very exptnſive, to make a  
ſufficient Fortification there.—The whole Flat upon  
the Hill muſt be taken-in, the Side next the De-

in former Days, ſet a Silver Baſon before us, wherein  
  
there was the Leg of a Beaver, and defir* d all the  
Nations to come and eal of it ; to eat in Peace and  
Plenty, and not lo be churhſh to one another: And

you may uſe it upon me as well as others. :  
Now Fathers, it 1s you who are the Difturbers i in  
this Land, by coming and building your Towns; and  
taking it away unknown to us, and by Force,  
Fathers, We kindled a Fire a long Time ago, at a  
Place called Montreal, where we defired you to ſtay,  
and not to come and intrude upon our Land. I now  
deſire you may diſpatch to that Place; for be it known  
zo you, Fathers, that this 1s our Land, and not  
  
  
Fathers, I deſire you may foo me in Civilneſs , if  
not, we muſt handle that Rod which was laid down  
for the Uſe of the abſtreperous. If you had come in  
a peaceable Manner, like our Brothers the Engliſh,  
we ſhould not have been againſt your trading with us,  
as they do; BUT TO COME, FATHERS, AND BUILD  
Housks upon ouR LAND, AND TO TAKE IT BY  
  
  
Fathers, Both you and the Engliſh are white, we

to neither one nor Pother : But the Great Being above  
  
  
Brothers the Engliſh : For I will keep you at Arms  
  
  
which will have the greateſi Regard to it, and that

is my Wampum that you took away, with the Marks  
of Towns.init ? This  ampum 1 do not know, which  
you have diſcharged me off the Land with: But you  
need not put yourſelf to the Trouble of ſpeaking, for I  
will not hear yeu. I am not afraid of Flies, or Muſ-

Monofatoocha, and two other Sachems to my Tent;  
and begged (as they had complied with his Ho-  
nour the Governor&#x27;s Requeſt, in providing Men,  
Sc.) to know on what Buſineſs we were going to  
the French ? this was a Queſtion I all along ex-

to, as I could; which ayes their Curioſity a  
little.

French had called all the Mings*&#x27;s, Delawares, &amp;c.  
  
. at that Place; ** told them, that they ,  
| intended  
  
(15)  
leaded to have been down the River this Fall,  
but the Waters were growing cold, and the Winter  
advancing, which obliged them to go into Quarters :  
But that they might aſſuredly expect them in the  
Spring, with a far greater Number; and deſired  
that they might be quite paſſive, and not to in-  
termeddle, unleſs they had a Mind to dray all  
  
their Force upon them: For that they expected to  
fight the Eugliſb three Years (as they ſuppoſed there  
would be ſome Attempts made to ſtop them). in  
  
  
they ſnould prove equally ſtrong, they and the  
Engliſh, would join to cut them all off, and divide  
the Land between them: That though they had  
loſt their General, and ſome few of their Soldiers,  
yet there were Men enough to reinforce en  
and make them Maſters of the Ohio. ©

one Captain Joncaire their Interpreter in Chief,

very early, and begged 1 me to ſtay one Day more:

the Wampum they ordered, . but would certainly  
be in To-night ; if not, they would delay me no

arrived. When I found them ſo preſſing in  
  
  
pum was the aboliſhing of Agreements; ; and  
giving this up, was ſhaking- off all Dependance  
upon the French, I conſented te ſtay, as I believed  
an Offence offerct at this Criſis, might be attended

We found the French Colours hoiſt at a Houſe:  
  
_ Engliſh Subject. 1 immediately repaired to it, to  
know where the Commander reſided. There were  
three Officers, one of whom, Capt. Joncaire, in-  
  
formed me, that he had the Command of the  
  
Ohio : But that there was a General Officer at the.  
  
near Fort, where he adviſed me to apply for an.  
  
Anſwer. He invited us to ſup with them; and  
  
treated us with the greateſt Complaiſance,  
  
rifully with it, ſoon baniſhed the Reſtraint which  
at fift appeared in their Converſation z and gave a  
Licence to their Tongues to reveal their Sentiments  
more freely.  
  
They told me, Thar it was their abſolute De-  
ſign to take Poſſeſſion of the Ohio, and by G they  
would do it: For that altho&#x27; they were ſenſible the  
Eng liſb could raiſe two Men for their one; yet they  
  
knew, their Motions were too flow and dilatory to  
  
prevent any Undertaking of theirs. They pretend  
ts bave an undoubted Right to the River, from a  
Diſcovery made by one La Solle 60 Years ago; and  
  
  
tling on the River or Waters of it, as they had  
; heard of ſome Families moving-out in Order  
thereto. From the beſt Intelligence I could ger,

Like: But upon the Death of the General all were  
recalled to about 6 or 500, who were left to gar-  
riſon four Forts, 150 or there abouts in each. The  
firſt of them is on French-Creek, near a ſmall  
Lake, about 60 Miles from Venango, near N. N. W.  
the next lies on Lake Erie, where the greater Part  
of their Stores are kept, about 15 Miles from the  
other, From this it is 120 Miles to the carrying  
Place, at the Falls of Lake Erie, where there i is a  
| ſmall Fort; which they lodge their Goods at, in  
bringing them from —— the Place whence all  
their Stores come from. The next Fort lies about  
20 Miles from this, on Ontario-Lake. Between  
this Fort and Montreal there are three others, the  
firſt of which is near oppoſite to the Exgliſb Fort  
Ofwego. From the Fort on Lake Erie to Montreal  
is about 600 Miles, which they ſay requires no  
more, if good Weather, than four Weeks Voyage,  
if they go in Barks or large Veſſels, ſo that they may  
croſs the Lake : But if they come in Canoes it will  
require 5 or 6 Weeks, for hey are obliged to keep  
under the Shore.

our Travelling. Capt. Joncaire ſent for the Half-  
King,as he had but uſt heard that he came with me:  
He affected to be much concerned that I did not  
make free to bring them in before. I excuſed it in  
the beſt Manner I was capable, and told him, I  
did not think their Company agreeable, as I had  
heard him ſay a good deal in Diſpraiſe of Indians in  
general. But another Motive prevented me from  
bringing them into his Company: I knew he was  
Interpreter, and a Perſon of very great Influence  
among the Indians, and had lately uſed all poſſible  
| Means to draw them over to their Intereſt; there-  
fore I was deſirous of giving no Opportunity that  
teuld be avoided: — When

When they came in, there was great Pleaſure ex-  
preſſed at ſeeing them. He wondred how they could  
de ſo near without coming to viſit him; made ſe-  
veral trifling Preſents; and applied Loquor ſo fat,  
that they were ſoon rendred incapable of the Buſinefs  
they came about, notwithſtanding the Caution which  
was given. e

and there wait our Arrival, if there was&#x27; a Poſpect  
of the Rivers freezing: If not, then to continue  
down to Shanapin&#x27;s Town, at the Forks of Obio,  
and there to wait till we came to croſs Aliganey; in-  
tending myſelf to go down by Water, ay J had  
the Offer of a Canoe or too ee  
As I found many Plots concerted to retard the  
  
Indians Buſineſs, and prevent their returning with  
  
  
fruſtrate their Schemes, and hurry them on to exe-  
cute their intended Deſign. They accordingly preſ-  
ſed for Admittance this Evening, which at Length  
was granted them, privately, with the Commander  
and one or two other Officers, The Half-King told  
me, that he offer&#x27;d the Wampum to the Comman-  
der, who evaded taking it, and made many fair  
Promiſes of Love and Friendſhip ; ſaid he wanted  
to live in Peace, and trade amicably with them, as  
a Proof of which he would ſend ſome Goods imme-  
diately down to the Logg*s-Town fer them. But I  
  
  
our ſtraggling Traders they meet with, as I pri-  
vately underſtood they intended to carry an Officer,  
Se. with them. And what rather confirms this  
Opinion, I was enquiring of the Commander, by  
  
  
our Engliſh: Subjects. He told me that the Country  
  
  
it on the Ohio, or the Waters of it.  
  
4  
  
L enquir&#x27;d of Capt. Riparti about the Boy who was  
carried by this Place, as it was done while the Com-  
mand devolved on him, between the Death of the late  
General, and the Arrival of the preſent. He ac-  
knowledged, that a Boy had been carried paſt; and  
that the Indians had two or three white Men&#x27;s  
Scalps, (I was told by ſome of the Indians at Venango  
Eight) but pretended to have forgotten the Name of  
the Place which the Boy came from, and all the Par-  
ticular Facts, though he had queſtion&#x27;d him for  
ſome Hours, as they were carrying him paſt. I  
likewiſe enquired what they had done with Jobn  
Trotter and James Mac Clocklan, two. Penſylvania  
Traders, whom they had taken, with all their  
Goods. They told me, that they had been ſent  
to Canada, but were now returned Home.  
This Evening I received an Anſwer to his Honour  
the Governor&#x27;s Letter from the Commandant.

to carry out Canoe acroſs a Neck of Land, a Quar-  
ter of a Mile over. We did not reach Venango, till  
the 22d, where we met with our Horſes.  _

a Place called the Murdering-Town (where we in-  
tended to quit the Path, and ſteer acroſs the Country  
for Shannapins Town)we fell-in witha Party of French  
Indians, who had lain in Wait for us. One of them

might ger the Start, ſo far, as to be out of the

well affured they would follow our Tract as ſoon as  
it was light. The next Day we continued travelling  
till quite dark, and got to the River about two Miles  
above Shannapins. We expected to have found the  
River frozen, but it was not, only about 50 Yards  
from each Shore: The Ice I ſuppoſe had broken up  
above, for it was driving in vaſt Quantities: _  
There was no Way for getting over but on a Raft :

Way over, we were jammed in the Ice, in ſuch a  
Manner that we expected every Moment our Raft to  
fink, and ourſelves to periſh, I put-out my ſetting

And further told him, that three nations  
of French Indians had taken up the  
hatchet againft the Englifh.  
  
“* Here, fays he, another Indian king in-  
formed me, that an Indian from Venango  
brought news, a few days ago, that the  
French had called all the Mingo’s, Dela-  
wares, gc. together at that place ; and  
told them, that they intended to have  
been down the river this fall, but the wa-  
ters were growing cold, and the winter  
  
advancing, which obliged them to go into C  
  
quarters: But that they might affuredly  
expect them in the fpring, with a far  
greater number; and defired that they  
might be quite paffive, and not to inter-  
meddle, unlefs they had a mind to draw  
all their force upon them : For that they  
expected to fight the Englifh three years  
(as they fuppofed there would be fome  
attempts made to ftop them) in which  
time they fhould conquer: But that if  
they fhould prove equally ftrong, they and  
the Englith would join to cut them all  
off, and divide the land between them :  
That tho’ they had loft their general, and  
fome few of their foldiers, yet there wete  
men enough to reinforce them, and make  
them matters of the Ohio.”  
  
This fpeech, he faid, was delivered to  
them by one captain Joncaire, their inter-  
preter in chief, living at Venango, and a  
man of note in the army.

guard of four Indians, and travelled on  
the road to Venango, where we arrived  
the ath of December, without any thing  
remarkable. happening but a continued  
ferits of bad weather.  
. This is an old Indian town, fituated at  
the moath of French creek on the Ohio ;  
and lies mear N. about 60 miles from the  
Loggs- Town, but more than 70 the way  
we were odliged fo go.  
  
We found the French colours hoifted at  
a houfe, from which they had driven Mr.  
fohn Frazier, an Englifh fubject. I im-  
inediately repaired to it, to know where  
the commander refided. There were  
three officers, one of whom, Capt. Jon-  
  
caire, informed me, that he had the com-  
  
mand of the Ohio: But that there was.a  
  
general officer at the near fort,-where -he:  
advifed me to apply foran anfwer. He  
  
invited us to fup withthem ; and treated  
  
us with the greateft complaifance.  
  
The wine, as they dofed themfelves  
pretty plentifully with it,-foon baniithed  
the reftraint which at firft appeared in  
their converfation ; and gave a licence to  
their tongues to reveal their fentiments  
more freely.  
  
They told me, that it was their abfolute  
defign to take poffeffion of the Ohio, and  
by G— they would doit: For that altho’  
they were fenfible the Englith could raife  
two men for their one ; yet they knew,  
their motions were too flow and dilatory  
to prevent any undertaking of theirs.  
They pretend to have an undoubted right  
to the river, from a difcovery made by  
one La Solle 60 years ago ; and the rife  
of this expedition is, to prevent our fet-  
tling on the viver or waters of it, as they  
had heard of fome families moving out in  
order thereto. &#x27; From the beft intelligence  
I could get, there have been 1500 men  
on this fide Ontario lake ;: But upon the  
death of the general all, were recalled to  
about 6 or 700, who were left to garifon  
four forts, 150 or thereabouts in each.  
The firft of them is on French-creek, riear’  
a fmall lake, about 60 miles from Ve-  
nango, near N,N. W. the next lies on  
lake Erie, where the greater part of their  
ftores are kept, about 15 miles from the  
other, From this it is 120 miles to the  
carrying place, at the falls of lake Erie,  
where there is a fmall fort ; which they  
lodge their goods at, in bringing them  
from Montreal, the place whence all their  
  
E ftores come from. The next fort lies  
  
about 20 miles from this, on Ontario-  
lake. Between this fort and Montreal  
there are three others, the firft of which  
is near oppofite to the Englith fort Of-  
wego. From the fort. on lake Erie to  
Montreal is about 600 miles, which they  
fay requires no more, if good weather,  
than four weeks voyage, if they go in  
barks or large veffels, fo that they may  
crofs the lake: Butif they come in canoes,  
it will require 5 or 6 weeks, for they are  
  
obliged to keep under the thore.  
sth, Rained exceffively all day, which  
prevented our travelling. Capt. Joncaie  
fent for the half-king, as he had but juft  
heard that he came with me: He affected  
to be much concerned that I did not make  
free to bring them in before, I excufed  
it in the beft manner I was capable, and  
told him, I did not think their company  
agreeable, as I had heard him fay a good  
deal in difpraife of Indians in genezal.

But another motive prevented me from  
bringing them into his company: I knew  
she was interpreter, and a perfon of very  
great influence among the Indians, and  
had lately ufed all poffible means to draw  
them over to their intereft ; therefore I  
was defirous of giving no opportunity  
that could be avoided.  
  
When they came in, there was great  
pleafure expreffed at feeing them. He  
wondered how they could be fo near  
without coming to vifit him ; made feveral  
trifling prefents ; and applied liquor fo  
fatt, that they were foon rendred incapable  
of the bufinefs they came about, not-  
withftanding the caution which was given.  
  
6th. The half-king came to my tent,  
quite fober, and infifted very much that  
1 thould ftay and hear what he had to fay  
to the French. I fain would have pre-  
vented his fpeaking any thing, till he  
came to the commandant ; but could not  
prevail. He told me, that at this place a  
council fire was kindled, where all their  
bufinefs with thefe people was to be tranf-  
aéted ; and that the management of the  
Indian affairs was left folely to Monfeur  
Joncaire. AsI was defirous of knowing  
the iffue of this, I agreed to ftay: But  
fent our horfes a little way up French-  
creek, to raft over and encamp ; which  
I knew would make it near night.  
  
About 10 o’clpck they met in council.  
The king fpoke much the fame as he had  
before done to the general ; and offered  
the French fpeech-belt which had before  
been demanded, with the marks of four  
towns on it, which Monfieur Joncaire re-  
fufed to recieve ; but defired him to carry  
it to the fort to the commander.  
  
7th. Monfieur la Force, commiffary of  
the French ftores, and three other foldiers  
came over to accompany us up. We  
found it extremely difficult to get the  
Indians off to-day, as every ftratagem  
had been ufed to prevent their going-up  
with me. I had laft night left John  
  
- Davifon (the Indian interpreter whom I  
  
brought with me from town) and ftriGlly  
charged him not to be out of their com-  
pany, as I could not get them over to my  
tent ; for they had fome bufinefs with  
Kuftaloga, chiefly to know the reafon  
why he did not deliver up the French  
belt which he had in keeping: But I was  
obliged to fend Mr. Gift over to-day to  
  
fetch them ; which he did with great  
  
perfuafion.

23th. The chief officers retired, to hold  
a council of war; which gave me an op-  
portunity of taking the dimenfions of the  
fort, and making what obiervations I could.  
  
It is fituated on the fouth, or weft fork  
of French-creek, near the water ; and is  
almoft furrounded by the creek, and a  
fmall branch of it which forms a kind of  
ifland. Four houfes compofe the fides,  
The baftions are made of piles driven inte  
the ground, ftanding more than 12 feet  
above it, and fharp at top ¢ With porte  
holes cut for cannon, and loop-holes for  
the fmall arms to fire through, There  
are eight 6lb. pieces mounted, in each  
baftion ; and one piece of four pound  
before the gate. In the baftions are a  
guard-houfe, chapel, do€tor’s lodging,  
and the commander’s private ftore; round  
which are laid plat-forms for the cannon  
and men to ftand on. There are feveral  
barracks without the fort, for the foldiers  
dwelling ; covered, fome with bark, and  
fome with boards, made chiefly of logs.  
There are alfo feveral other houfes, fuch  
as ftables, fmiths-fhop, 4c,  
  
1 could get no certain account of the  
number of men here: But according to  
the beft judgment I could form, there are  
an bundred cxclufive af officers, Of which

the people who were with me, to take  
an exact account of the canoes which  
were hauled up to convey their forces  
cown in the fpring. This they did, and  
told so of birch bark, and 170 of pine;  
beiides many others, which were block-  
ed out, in readinefs to make,

and our horfes daily became weaker,  
J fent them off unloaded; under the care  
of Barnaby Currin and two others, to  
ma.e ail convenient difpatch to Venango,  
and there waitovur arrival, if there was  
a profpect of the river&#x27;s freezing : If not,  
then to continue down to Shanapin’s  
town, at the forks of Ohio, and there  
to wait till we came to crofs Aliganey ;  
intencing myfelf to go down by water,  
as I had the offer of a canoe or two,

invent to fet our own Indians at variance  
with us, to prevent their going till after  
our departure; prefents, rewards, and  
every thing which could be fuggefted  
by him or his officers. —I cannot fay that  
ever in my life I fuftered fo much anxiety  
as I did in this affair: I faw that every  
ftratagem, which the moft fruitful brain  
could invent, was practifed, to win the

cute their intended defign. ‘They accor-  
dingly preffed for admittance this evens  
ing, which at length was granted them,  
privately, with the commander and. one  
or two other officers. The half-king  
told me, that he offered the wampum to  
* the commander, who evaded taking it,  
and made many fair promifes of love and  
friendfhip; faid he wanted to live in  
peace, and trade amicably with them,  
asa proof of which he would fend fome  
goods immediately down to the Lugg’s-  
town for them. But I rather think the  
detign. of that is, to bring away all our  
ftraggling traders they meet with, as I  
privately underftood they intended to  
carry an officer, &amp;c. with them.  
what rather confirms this opinion, I was  
enquiring of the commander, by what  
authority he had made prifoners of feveral  
of ovr Englith fubje&amp;ts. He told me,  
that the country belonged to them ; that  
no Englifhman had a right to trade upon  
thofe waters ; and that he had orders  
to make every perfon prifoner who at-  
tempted it on the Ohio, or the waters of it.

the half-king and prefs’d him in the  
ftrongeft terms to go: He told me the  
commandant would not difcharge him  
till the morning. I then went to the  
commandant, and defired him to do their  
bufinefs, and complained of ill treat-  
ment: For keeping them, as they were  
part of my company, was detaining me.  
This he promifed not to do, but to for-

was ignorant of the caufe of their ftay ;  
though I foon found it out :—He had  
promifed them a prefent of guns, &amp;c,  
if they would wait till the morning,  
  
And — As I was very much preffed, by the  
  
Indians, to wait this day for them, I  
confented, on a promife, that nothing  
fhould hinder them inthe morning.

their inventions to keep the Indians this

they then endeavoured to try the power  
of liquor ; which I doubt not would have  
prevailed at any other time than this:

teft the inhabitants the next day.  
  
The exceflive rains and vaft quan-  
tity of fnow which had fallen, pre-  
vented our reaching Mr. Frazier’s,  
an Indian trader, at the mouth of  
Turtle Creek, on Monongahela  
siver, till Thurfday the 22d. We  
were informed here, that expreffles  
had been fent a few days before to  
the traders down the river, to ac-  
quaint them with the French Gen-  
eral’s death, and the return of the  
major part of the French army into  
winter quarters.  
  
The waters were quite impaffa-  
ble, without {wimming our horles ;  
which obliged us to get the loan of  
a canoe from Frazier, and to fend  
Barnaby Currin, and Henry Stew-  
ard, down the Monongahela, with  
our baggage, to meet us at the Forks  
of Ohio, about 10 miles, there to  
crofs the Aligany.*  
  
As I got down before the canoe,  
I {pent fome time in viewing the  
rivers, and the land in the Fork;  
which I think extremely well fitu-  
ated for a fort, as it has the abfolute  
command of both rivers. Theland  
atthe point is 20 or 25 feet above  
the common furface of the water ;  
anda confiderable bottom of flat,  
well timbered land all around it,  
very convenient for building : The  
rivers are each a quarter of a mile,  
or more, acrofs, and run here very  
near at right angles: Aligany bear-  
ing N. E.and Monongahela S. E.  
The former of thefe twa is a very  
rapid and {wift running water ; the  
other deep and itill, without any  
perceptible fall.  
  
About two miles from this, on the  
South Eaft fide of the river, at the  
place where the Ohio Company in-  
tended to ere&amp; a fort, lives Shingils,  
King of the Delawares : We called  
upon him, to invite him to counci!

tice yefterday of the fituation at the  
Forks, my curiofity led me to ex-  
amine this more particularly, and [  
think it greatly inferior, either for  
defence or advantages ; efpecially  
the latter: For a fort at the Forks  
would be equally well fituated on the  
Ohio, and have the entire com-  
mand of the Monongahela ; which  
runs up to our fettlements and is ex-  
tremely well defigned for water  
carriage, as it is of adeep ftill na-  
ture. Befides a fort at the Fork  
might be built at a much lefs ex-  
nie,than at the other place.  
Nature has well contrived this  
lower place, for water defence; but  
the hill whereon it muft ftand being  
about a quarter of a mile in length,  
and then defcending gradually on  
the land fide, will render it difficult  
and very expenfive, to make a fuf-  
ficient fortification there. The  
whole flat upon the hill muft be  
taken in, the fide next the defcent  
made extremely high, or elfe the  
hillitfelf cut away : Otherwife, the  
enemy may raife batteries within  
that diftance without being expofed  
to a fingle fhot from the fort.  
Shingifs attended us to the Loggs  
Town, where we arrived between  
fun fetting and dark, the e5th day  
after I left Williamfburg. We  
travelled over fome extreme good  
and bad land, to get to this place.  
As foon as I came into town, I  
went to Monakatoocha (as the half  
king was out at his hunting cabbin  
on little Beaver Creek, about 15  
miles off) and informed him by John  
Davifon my Indian interpreter, that  
I was lent a meflenger to the French  
General ; and was ordered to call  
upon the fachems of the fix nations,  
to acquaint them withit., I gave  
him a ftring of wampum, t and a  
twilt of tobacco, and defired him to  
fend for the half king ; which he  
promifed te do by a runner in the  
morning, and for otherfachems. I

I enquired into the fituation ot  
the French, on the Mififippi, their  
number, and what forts they had  
built, They informed me, that  
there were four {mall forts between  
New Orleans and the Black Iflands,  
garrifoned with about 30 or 40 men,  
and a few {mall pieces in each : That  
at New Orleans, which is near the  
mouth of the Miffifippi, there are  
35 companies, of 40 men each, with  
a pretty {trong fort, mounting 8 car-  
riage guns ; and at the Black Iflands  
there are feveral companies, and a  
fort with 6 guns, The Black Iflands  
are about 130 leagues above the  
mouth of the Ohio, which is about  
350 above New Orleans. They  
alfo acquainted me, that there was a  
fmail pallifadoed tort on the Ohio,  
at the mouth of the Obaifh, about 60

der 5 or 6 nights fleep, good travel-  
ling. When he went to the fort,  
he faid he was received in a very  
{lern manner by the late command-  
er ; who afked him very abruptly,  
what he had come about, and to de-  
clare his bufinefs : Which he faid  
he did in the following {peech :—  
  
«* Fathers, I am come to tell you  
your own {peeches ; what your own  
mouths have declared. Fathers,  
you, in former days, fet a filver  
bafon before us, wherein there was  
the leg of a beaver, and defired ail  
the nations to come and eat of it; to  
eat in peace and plenty, and not te  
be churlifh to one another: And  
that if any fuch perfon fhould be  
found to be a difturber, I here lay  
down by the edge of the difh a rod,  
which you mutt fcourge them with ;  
and if I your father, fhould get fool-  
ifh, in my old days, I defire you may  
ufe it upon me as well as others.  
  
‘+ Now fathers, it is you who are  
the diiturbers in this land, by com-  
ing and building your towns; and  
taking it away unknown tous, and  
by force.  
  
‘+ Fathers, we kindled a fire along  
time ago, at a place called Montreal,  
  
where

where we defired you to ftay,and  
not to come and intrude upon our  
land. I now defire you may dif-  
patch to that place ; for be it known  
to you, fathers, that this is pur land,  
and not yours,  
  
«‘ Fathers, I defire you may hear  
me in civilnefs; if not, we mutt  
handle that rod which was laiddown  
for the ufe of the obftreperous, If  
you had come in a peaceable man-  
ner, like our brothers the Englifh,  
we fhould not have been againft  
your trading with us, as they do ;  
But to come, Fathers, and build houfes  
upon our land, and to take it by force,  
is what we cannot fubmit to.  
  
« Fathers, both you and the Eng-  
lifh are white, we live in a country  
between ; therefore the land belongs  
to neither one nor the other: But  
the great Being above allow’d it to  
be a place of refidence for us ; fo  
fathers, 1 defire you to withdraw,  
as I have done our brothers the  
Englifh : For I will keep you at  
arms length. I lay this down asa  
trial for both, to fee which will have  
the greateft regard to it, and that  
fide we will ftand by, and make  
equal fharers with us. Our brothers  
the Englifh have heard this, and I  
come now to tell it to you; for I  
am not afraid to dilcharge you off  
this land.”  
  
This he faid was the fubftance of  
what he {poke to the General, who  
made this reply.  
  
** Now my child, I have heard  
your {peech ; You {poke firft, but  
it ismy time to {peak now. Where  
is my wampum that you took away,  
with the marksof towns in it ? This  
wampum I do not know, which  
you have difcharged me off the land  
with: But you need not put your-  
{elf to the trouble of {peaking, for I  
will not hear you. I am not afraid  
of flies, or mufquitos, for Indians  
are fuch as thofe. I tell you, down  
that river I will go, and build upon  
it, according to my command. If  
‘ae river was block’d up, I have  
  
forces fufficient to burft it open,  
and tread under my feet all that  
ftand in oppofition, together with  
their alliances ; for my force is as  
the fand upon the fea fhore : There-  
fore, here is your wampum, I fling  
itatyou. Child, you talk foolifh ;  
you fay this land belongs to you,  
but there is not the black of my

‘«¢ Child, you think it a very great  
hardfhip that I made prifoners of  
thofe two people at Venango. Don’t  
you concern yourfelf with it: We  
took and carried them to Canada, to  
get intelligence of what the Englifh  
were doing in Virginia.”  
  
He informed me that they had  
built two forts, one on Lake Erie,  
and another on French Creek, near  
afmall Lake about 15 miles afunder,  
and a large waggon road between :  
They are both built after the fame  
model, but different in fize ; that on  
the Lake the largeft. He gave me  
a plan of them, of his own drawing.  
  
he Indians enquired iy. partic-  
ular after their brothers in Carolina  
oal.  
  
They alfo afked what fort of a  
boy it was who was taken from the  
South Branch ; for they were told  
by fome Indians, that a party of  
French Indians had carried a white  
boy by Kufkufka Town, towards the  
Lakes.  
  
26th. We met in council at the  
Long Houfe about 9 o’clock, where  
I fpoke to them as follows :—

« Brothers, I have called you to-  
&quot;rer in council, by order of your  
  
rother the Governour of Virginia,  
to acquaint you, that I am fent, with  
all poffible difpatch, to vitt, and  
deliver a letter to the French com-  
mandant, of very great importance  
to your brothers the Englifh : and I  
dare fay to you, their friends and  
allics.  
  
“* I was defired, brothers, by your  
brother the Governor, to call upon  
you, the Sachems of the nations, to  
inform you of it, and to afk your  
advice and affitance to proceed the  
neareft and beft road to the French.  
You fee, brothers, I have gotten  
thus far on my journey.  
  
&amp; His honor likewile defired me  
to apply to you for fomeof your  
young men, to conduft and pro-  
vide provifions for us on our way ;  
and be a fafeguard againft thofe  
French Indians who have taken up  
the hatchet againft us. I have {poke  
this particul larly to you, brothers,  
becaufe his honor our Governor  
treats you as good friends and allies ;  
and holds you in great eftecm. To  
confirm w hat I have faid, I give  
you this {tring of wampum.”  
  
After they had confidered for  
cag time onthe above difcouriec,  
he half king got up and {poke :—  
  
“« Now my brother, in ‘regard to  
what my brother the Governor had  
cefired me, I return you this anfwer.  
  
‘I rely upon you as a brother  
ought to do, as you fay we are broth-  
crs vand one people : We fhall put  
heart in hand, and {peak to our  
fathers the French concerning the  
  
{peech they made tome ; and you  
may depend that we will endeavor  
to be your guard,  
  
«“ Brother, as you have afked my  
advi ice, Lhope you will be ruled by  
it, and flay till l can provide acom-  
  
pany to go wi ith you. The French  
fpeech belt is not here, I have it to  
go for to my hunting + cabbin: Like-  
  
wife the peonle whom I have or-  
  
  
  
Major George Wafbington’s “fournal.  
  
dered in, are not yet come, norean.  
not till the third night from this ; til  
  
which time, brother, I mutt ‘bes  
you to ftay.  
  
«T intend to fend the guard of  
Mingos, Shannoahs, and Delawares,  
that our brothers may fee the love  
and loyalty we bear them,”  
  
As I had orders to make all pof-  
fible difpatch, and waiting here was  
very contrary to my inclination, I  
thanked him in the moft fuitable  
manner I could ; and told him, that  
my bufinefs required the greateft  
expedition, and would not admit  
of that delay. He was not well  
pleated that I fhould offer to gobe-  
fore the time he had apelin and  
told me, that he could not confent  
to our going without a guard, for  
fear fome accident fhould befal us,  
and draw a refle&amp;ion upon him,  
Befides, fays he, this is a matter of  
no {ma!l moment, and muift not be  
entered into without due confidera-  
tion : For now I intend to deliver  
up the French {peech belt, and make  
theShannoahs and Delswaresdid the  
fame. And accordingly he gave  
ordcrs to King Shingils, who was  
prefent, to attend on Wednefday  
night with the wampum ; and two  
men of their nation to be in readi-  
nefs to {et out with us mext morn-  
ing. &lt;As I found it was impoflible  
to “get off without affronting them  
in the moft egregious manner, I  
confented to ftay.  
  
I gave th em back a ftring of  
wampum w! hich I met with at Mr  
Frazier’s, and which they fent with  
a {peech to his honor the Governor,  
to inform him, that three nations  
of French Indians, viz. Chippo  
ways, Ottoways, and Orundaks,  
had taken up the hatchet again:  
the Englith ; ‘and defired them t to re-  
  
eat it over again : But this they

queftion I all along expeéted, and  
had provided as fatisfattory an-  
fwers to, as I could; which allay-  
ed their curiofity a little.  
  
Monokatoocha informed me, that  
an Indian from Venango brought  
news, a few days ago, that the  
French had called all the Mingos,  
Delawares, &amp;c. together at that  
place ; and told them that they in-  
tended to have been down the river  
this fall, but the waters were grow-  
ing cold, and the winter advancing,  
which obliged them to go into quar-  
ters: But that they might afluredly  
expeé them in the fpring, with a  
far greater number ; and defired  
that they might be quite paflive, and  
not to intermeddle, unlefs they had  
a mind to draw all their force upon  
them: For that they expected to  
fight the Englifh three years (as they  
fuppofed there would be fome at-  
tempts mace to {top them) in which  
time they fhould conquer: But that  
if they fhould prove equally {trong,  
they and the Englifh, would join to  
cut them all off, and divide the land  
between them: That though they  
had loft their General, and fome  
few of their foldiers, yet there were  
men enough to reinforce them, and  
make them matters of the Ohio.  
  
This fpeech, he faid, was deliver-  
ed to them by one Capt. Joncaire  
their interpreter in chief, living at  
Venango, and a man of note in the  
army.  
  
29th. The half king and Mono-  
Kato@cha, came very carly and beg-  
  
ournatl. 351  
  
ged me to {lay one day more &gt; For  
notwithitanding they had ufed all  
the diligence in their power, the  
Shanoah chiefs had not brought the  
wampum they ordered, but would  
certainly be in to night ; if not they  
would delay me no longer, but  
would fend it after us as foon as  
they arrived. When I found them  
{fo prefling in their requeft, and  
knew that returning of wampum  
was the abolifhing of agreements ;  
and giving this up, was fhaking off  
all dependence upon the French, I  
contented to ftay, as I believed an  
offence offered at this crifis, might  
be attended with greater ill confe-  
quence, than another day’s delay.  
They alfo informed me, that Shingifs  
  
could not getin his men; and was.  
  
revented trom coming himfelf by  
his wife’s ficknels, (1 believe, by fear  
of the French) but that the wampum  
of that nation was lodged with  
Kuftaloga one of their chiefs at  
Venango.  
  
In the evening late they came  
again and acquainted me that the  
Shannoahs were not yet arrived,  
but that it fhculd not retard the pro-  
fecution of ourjourney. He deliv-  
ered in my hearing, the f{peeches  
that were to be made to the French  
by Jefkakake, one of their old  
chiefs, which was giving up the  
belt the late commandant had afked  
for, and repeating near the fame  
{peech he himfelf had done before,  
  
He alfo delivered a {tring of  
wampum to this chief which was  
fert by King Shingils, to be given to  
Kuftaloga, with orders to repair to  
the French, and deliver up the  
wampum.  
  
He likewife gave a very large  
ftring of black and white wampum,  
which was to be fent up immediate-  
ly to the fix nations, if the French  
refufed to quit the land at this warn-

This is an old Indian town, fitu-  
ated at the mouth of French Creek  
on Ohio ; and lies near N. about 60  
miles from the Loggs Town, but  
more than 70 the way we were  
obliged to go, :  
  
  
  
We found the French colours  
hoifted at a houfe from which they  
had driven Mr, John Frazier, an  
Englifh fubje&amp;t. I immediately re-  
paired to it, to know where thecom-  
mander refided. There were three  
officers, one of whom, Capt. Jon-  
caire, informed me, that he had the  
command of the Ohio: But that  
there was a general officer at the  
near fort, where he advifed me to  
apply for an anfwer. He invited  
us to fup with them ; and treated us  
with the greateft complaifance.  
  
The wie, as they dozed them-  
felves pretty plentifully with it, foon  
banifhed the reftraint which at firlt  
appeared in their converfation ; and  
gave a licence to their tongues to  
reveal their fentiments more freely.  
_ They told me, that it was their  
abfolute defign to take poffeffion of  
the Ohio, and by G--d they would  
do it: For that although they were  
fenfible the Englifh could raife too  
men for their one } yet they knew,  
their motions were too flow and  
dilatory to prevent any undertaking  
of theirs. They pretend to have  
an undoubted right to the river,

from a difcovery made by one La  
  
Salle 60 years ago ; and the rile of  
  
this expedition . is, to prevent our  
jettling on the river or waters of it,  
as they had heard of fome families  
moving outin order thereto. From  
  
the belt intelligence I could get,  
  
there have been 1500 men on this  
fide Ontario Lake : But upon the  
death of the General. all weye re-  
called to about 6 or 700, who were  
left to garnfon four forts, 150 or  
there abouts im each. The firft of  
them ison French Creek, near a  
{mall lake, about 60 miles from Ve-  
nango, near N,N. W. the nexties  
on Lake Ene, where the greater  
part of their flores are kept, about  
15 miles from the other, From this  
it is 120 miles to the carrying place,  
at the falls of Lake Eric, where there  
isa {mall fort; which they lodge  
their goods at, in’ biinging them  
from Montreal, the place whence  
all their ftores come from. The  
next fort lies about 29 miles from  
this, on Ontario Lake. Between  
this fort and Montreal there are three  
others, the firit of which is nearly  
oppofite to the Englith fort Olwego.  
From. the fort on Lake Erie tn  
Montreal is about 600 miles, which  
they fay requires no more, if good  
  
weather, than four weeks voyage, tf  
they go in barks or large vefiels, fo  
  
that they may crofsthe Lake: But  
if they come in canoes it will re-  
uire £ or 6 weeks, for they are  
obliged to keep under the fhere.

which preven&#x27;vd &gt; our travelling.  
Capt. | oneaire fent for the half king,  
ashe had but juft heard that he  
came with me: He affe&amp;ed to be  
much concerned that I did not make  
free to bring them inbecfore. I ex-  
cufed itin the beft manner! was  
capable, and told him, I did not  
think their company agreeable, as I  
had heard him fay a good deal in  
difpraife of Indians in general. But  
ancther motive prevented me from  
  
bringing them into his company: J  
knew he was interpreter, and a per-  
fon of very great inflaence amon  
the Indians, and had lately ufed all  
poffible means to draw them over  
to their intereft; therefore I was  
defirous of giving no opportunity  
that could be avoided.  
  
When they came in, there was  
great pleafure expreffed at {ecing  
them. He wondered how they  
could be fo near without coming te  
vit him ; made feveral trifling pref-  
ents ; and applied liquor fo faft,  
that they were foon rendered in-  
capable of the bufinefs they came  
about, notwithitanding the caution  
which was gi en.

6th. The half king came to my  
tsmt, quite tober, and infiited very  
much that] fhould ftay and hear  
what he had to fay to the French.  
I fain would have prevented his  
{peaking any thing, till he came to  
the commandant ; but could not pre-  
vail. He told me, that at this place  
a council fire was kindled, where  
all their bufinefs with thefe people  
was to be tranfaéted; anda that the  
management of the Indian. affairs  
was left folely to Monficur Joncaire,  
As I was defirous of knowing the  
iffue of this, I agreed to flay: But  
fent. our horfes a little ways up  
French Creek, to raft over and en-  
camp ; which | knew would make  
jt near night.  
  
About 10 o’cleck they met in  
council, The king {poke much the  
fame as he had before done to the  
General ; and offered the French  
{peech beit w hich had before been  
demanded with the marks of four  
towns on it, which Monifieur Jon-  
caire refufed to receive : but detived  
him to carry it to the fort to the  
commander.

off to day, as every ftratagem had  
been ufed to prevent their going up  
with me. I had laft night left John  
Davifon (the Indian interpreter)  
whom I brought with me from  
town, and ftriétly charged him&#x27;not  
to be out of theix compary, as 1  
could not get them over to my tert &gt;  
for they had fome bufinefs with  
Kuftaloga, chiefly to know the rea-  
fon why he did ‘not deliver up the  
French belt Which he had in cae  
ing : But I was obliged’to fend Mr.  
Gift over to day to fetch them ;  
which he did with great perfuafions  
  
At 12 o&#x27;clock we fet out fdr the’  
fort, and were prevented from ar-  
riving there till the arth by excef-  
five rains, {nows, and bad travel-  
ling, through many mires and  
  
fwamps. Thefe we were obligéd  
to pals, to avoid croffir’g the cteck,  
which was impoffible, erther by  
fording or rafting, the water was lo  
high and rapid.  
  
We paffed over much good land

. 14th. Asthe fnow imcreaied very  
fait, and our horfes daily became  
weaker, I fent them off unloaded;  
under the care of Barnaby Currin  
and two others, to make a‘! conve-  
nient dilpatchto Venango,and these  
wait our arrival, if there was a prof-  
pect of the river’s freezing : If not,  
then to continue down to Shana-  
pin’s town, at the forks of Ohio,  
and there to wait till we came to  
crofs Aligany ; intending mylelf to  
go down by water, as 1 had the of-  
ter of a canoe or two. -  
  
As | found many plots concerted  
to retard the Indians’ bufinefs, and  
poorest their returning with me ;  
  
endeavoured all that lay in my  
power to frultrate their {chemes,  
and hurry them on to execute their  
intended defign. They according-  
ly preffed for admittance this even-  
ing, which at length was granted  
them, privately, with the command-  
cr and one or two other oflicers.  
The half king told me, that he of-  
fer&#x27;d the wampum to the command-  
er, who evaded taking it, and made  
many fair promifes of love and  
friendthip ; faid he wanted to live  
in peace, and trade amicably with  
them, as a proof of which he would  
fend fome goods immediately down  
to the Loggs Town for them, But  
[ rather think the defign of that is,  
to bring away all our ftraggling  
traders they meet with, as I private-  
ly underftood they intended to car-  
ry an officer, &amp;c. with them. And  
what rather confirms this opinions  
I was enquiring of the commander,  
by what authority he had made  
  
rifoners of feveral of our Englifh  
Fibjetts, Hetold me that the coun-  
try belong’d to them; that no Eng-  
lifhman had a right to trade upon  
thole waters; and that he had or-  
ders to make every perfon prifoner  
who attempted it on the Ohio, or  
the waters of it,  
  
I enquir’d of Capt. Riparti about  
the boy who was cared by this  
place, as it was done while the com-  
mand devolved on him between the  
death of the late General, and the  
arrival of the prefent. He acknow-

The exceffive rains and vaft  
quantity of {now which had faller,  
prevented our reaching Mr. Fra-  
zier’s, an Indian trader at the  
mouth of Turtle Creek, on Mo-  
nongahela river, till Thurfday the  
22d. We were informed here, that  
exprefies had been fent a few days  
betore to the traders down the ri-  
ver, to acquaint them with the  
French general’s death, and the re-  
turn of the major part of the  
French army into winter quarters.  
  
‘The waters were quite impafia-  
ble, without fwimming our hortfes;  
which obliged us to get the loan  
of a canoe from Frazier, and to  
fend Barnaby Currin, and Henry  
Steward, down the Monongahela,  
with our baggage, to mect us at  
the Forks of Ohio, about 10 miles,  
there to crofs the Aligany.”  
  
As I got down before the canoe,  
I fpent fome time in viewing the  
rivers, and the land in the Fork;  
which I think extremely well fitu-  
ated for a fort, as it has the ab-  
folute command of both rivers.  
‘The land at the point is 20 or 25  
feet above the common furface of  
the wacer; and a coniiderable bot-  
tom of flac well-timbered land ail  
around it, very convenient for  
building: Uhe rivers are each a

thefe two is a very rapid and {wife  
running water; the other deep and  
{iill, without any perceptible fall.  
  
About two miles from this, on  
the South Eait fide of the river, at  
the place where the Ohio company  
intended to ereét a fort, lives Sbin-  
gifs, King of the Delawares : We  
called upon him, to invite him to  
council at the Loggs ‘Town.  
  
As Thad taken a good deal of  
notice yefterday of the fituation at  
the Forks, my curiolity ied me to  
examine this more particularly,  
and i think it greatly inferior,  
either for defence or advantages 3  
cfpecially the latter: Fora fort at  
the Forks would be equally weil  
fituated on the Ohio, and have the  
eatire command of the Mononga-  
hela; which runs up to our fettle-  
ments, and isextremely well defig-  
ned for water carriage, as it is of a  
deep {till nature. Befides a fort at  
the Fork might be built at a much  
lefs expenie, than at the other place.  
  
Nature has well contrived this  
lower place for water defence; but  
the hill whereon it mult itand being  
about a quarter of a mile in Migtii  
and then defcending gradually on  
the land fide, will ‘render it diih-  
cult and very expenfive, to make a  
fufhicient fortification there. Tlie  
whole fat upon the hill muft be  
taken in, the fide mext the defcent  
made extremely high, or elfe the  
hill itfelf cut away : Otherwife, the  
enemy may raife batteries within  
  
that dtftance without being expofed  
to a ingle {hot from the fort.

As foon as I came into town, I  
went to Monakatoocha (as the half  
king was out at his hunting cabbin  
on little Beaver Creek, about 16  
miles off) and informed him by  
John Davifon my Indian interpre.  
ter, that I was fent a meflenger to  
the French general; and was order.  
ed tocall upon the fachems of the  
fix nations, to acquaint them with  
it. k gave him a ftring of wampum,  
+anda twilt of tobacco, and defired  
him to fend for the half king;  
which he promifed to do by a run-  
ner in the morning, and for other  
fachems. I invited him and the  
other great men prefent, to my  
tent, where they ftay’d about an  
hour and returned.  
  
According to thebeft obfervations  
I could make, Mr. Giff’s new fet-

50 miles from that: and from  
thence to the Loggs Town, the

Frenchmen who had deferted from

lies at the mouth of this river. I got  
the following account fron them.  
‘They were fent from New- Orleans  
with roo men, and 8 canoe loads  
of provifions to this place ; where  
they expected to have met the fame

I enquired into the fituation of  
the French, on the Milhéppi, their  
number, and what forts they had  
built. They informed me, tha itthere  
were four {mall f forts between New-  
Orleans and the Black-Iflands, gar-  
rifoned with about 30 or 4o men,  
and a few {mall pieces ineach: That  
at New-Orleans, whch is near the  
mouth of the Miffifippi, there are  
35 companies, of go men each, with  
a ead ftrongffor morning 8 car-  
and at the Black.

and a fort with 6 guns. ‘The Black-  
  
Ifiands are about 130 leagues above  
  
the mouth of the Ohio, which is  
about. 350 above New-Orleans.  
‘Uhey alio acquainted me, that there  
was a fmall pallifadoed fort on the  
Ohio, at the mouth of the Obaith,  
about 60 leagues from the Mifh-

irom the lower Shanoah Town  
with one Brown, an Indian tra-  
der, and were going to Phila-

About 3 o’clock this evening  
the half king came to town. I went  
up and invited him with Davifon,

went to the fort, he faid hawas  
received ina very ftern manner by  
the late commander; who atked  
him very abruptly, what he had  
come about, and to declare his bu-  
finefs: which he faid he did in the  
following {peech :—  
  
« Fathers, I am come to tell  
you your own {peeches; what your  
own mouths have declared. Fae .  
thers, you, in former days, fet a  
filver bafon before us, wherein  
there was the leg of a beaver, and  
defired all the nations to come  
arul eat of it; to eat in peace and  
plenty, and not to be churlifh to  
one another: And that if any fuch  
perfon fhould be found to bea dif-  
turber, I here lay down by the  
edge of the difha rod, which you  
mult feourge them with; and if I  
your father, fhould get foolifh in  
my old days, I defire you may ufe  
it upon me as well as others,  
  
“&lt; Now,dathers, it is you who  
are the difturbers in this land, *by  
coming and building your towns ;  
and taking it away unknown to  
us, and by force.  
  
«&lt;« Fathers, we kindled a fire a  
long time ago, ata place called  
Montreal, where we defired you to  
itay, and not to come and intrw Je  
upon our land. I now defire you  
may difpatch to that place; for be  
it known to you, fathers, that this  
is our land, and not yours.  
  
«&lt; Fathers, I defire you may hear  
me in civilnefs; if not, we mutt  
handle that rod which was laid  
  
down for the ufe of the obitrepe-  
rous. If you had come in a peace  
able manner, like our brothers the  
Englifh, we _thould not have been  
again{t your trading with us, as  
they do; But to come, Fathers, and  
build houfes upon our land, and to  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
2 Memoirs of George  
  
sande by force, is what we cannot  
ubmut to.  
  
Fathers, both you and the Eng-  
lifh are white, we live in a coun-  
try between ; therefore, the land  
belongs to neither one nor the  
other ; But the great Being above  
allowed it to be a place of refidence  
for us; fo fathers, I defire you to  
withdraw, as I have done our bro-  
thers the Englifh : For I will keep  
you at arms length. I lay this  
down asa trial for both, to fee  
which will have the greate{t re-  
gard to it, and that fide we will  
ftand by, and make equal tharers  
with us. Our brothers the Englifh  
have heard this, and I come now  
to tell it to you; for I am not  
afraid to difcharge you off this  
land.”  
  
This he faid was the fubftance  
of what he fpoke to the general,  
who made this reply.  
  
«Now, my child, Ihave heard  
your fpeech: You {poke firft, but  
it is my time to {peak now. Where  
is my wampum that you took away,  
with the marks of towns in it?  
This wampum I do not know,  
which you have difcharged me off  
the land with: Butyou need not put  
yourfelf to the trouble of fpeaking,  
for I will not hear you. 1am not  
afraidof flies, or mufquitoes, for In-  
dians are fuch as thofe. I tell you,  
down that river I will go, and  
build upon it, according to my  
command. If the river was block-  
ed up, | have forces fufficient to  
burft it open, and tread under my  
feet all that ftand in oppofition,  
together with their alliances; for  
my force is as the fand upon the  
fea-fhore : Therefore, here is your  
wampum, | fling it at you. Child,  
  
you talk foolish ; you fay this land  
  
  
  
Wafbington, E/y.  
  
belongs to you, but there is not  
the black of my nail yours. I faw  
that land fooner than you did, be-  
fore the Shannoahs and you were  
at war: Lead was the man who  
went down and took poffeffion of  
that river: It is my land, and I will  
have it, let who will {tand up for  
or fay againft it. Pll buy and fell  
with the Englifh (mockingly.) If  
people will be rul’d by me, they  
may expect kindnefs, but not  
elfe.”  
  
The half king told me he had  
enquired of the general after two  
Englifhmen who were made pri-  
foners, and received this anfwer:—  
  
«© Child, you think it a veiy  
great hardfhip that I made prifon-  
ers of thofe two people at Venan-  
go. Don’t concern yourfelf with  
it: We took and carried them to  
Canada, to get intelligence of what  
the Englith were doing in Virgi-  
nia.”  
  
He informed me that they had  
built two forts, one on Lake Erie,  
and another on French Creek,  
near a {mall lake about fifteen miles  
afunder, and a large waggon-road  
between: They are both built af  
ter the fame model, but different  
in fize; that on the lake the largeft.  
He gave me a plan of them, of  
his own drawing.  
  
The Indians enquired very par-  
ticular after their brothers in Ca-  
rolina jail.  
  
They alfo afked what fort of a  
boy it was who was taken from  
the South Branch; for they were  
told by fome Indians, that a party  
of French Indians had carried a  
white boy by Kufkufka Town, to-  
wards the lakes.

and came with Monokatoocha, and  
two other fachems, to my tent;  
and begged (as they had complied  
with his honor the governor’s res  
queft, in providing men, &amp;c.) to  
know on what bufinefs we were  
going to the French? This was a  
gueftion I all along expected, and  
had provided as fatisfactory an-  
fwers to, as I could, which aliayed  
their curiofity a little.  
  
Monokatoocha informed me,  
that an Indian from Venango  
brought news, a few days ago, that  
the French had called all the Min-  
gos, Delawares, &amp;c. together at  
that place; and told them that they  
intended to have been down the ri+  
ver this fall, but the waters were  
growing cold, and the winter ad-  
vancing, which obliged them to  
go into quarters: but that they  
night ailuredly expect them ina

ber 5 and de! ired that they might  
be quite paflive, and not to inter=

for that they expected to fight the  
Englifh three years (as they fup-  
pofed there would be fome attempts  
made to ftop them) in which time  
theyfhould conquer: but thatif they  
fhould prove equally ftrong, they

bad Jo&amp; their general, and fome  
few of their foldiers, yet there  
were men enough to reinforce  
them, and make them mafters of  
the Ohio,  
  
This fpeech, he faid, was deli-  
yered to them by one captain Jon-  
caire, their interpreter in chief, li-  
ying at Venango, and a man of  
note in the army.  
  
agth, The half king and Mono-  
katoocha came very early and beg-  
ged me to ftay one day mors ; for,  
notwithftanding they had ufed all  
the diligence in their power, the  
Shannoah chiefs had not brought  
the wampum they ordered, but  
would certainly be in to night; if  
not, they would delay meno lon  
ger, but would fend it after us as  
foon as they arrived, When |  
found them fo prefling in their re+  
queft, and knew that the reture  
ning of wampumn was the abolifh-  
ing of agreements, and giving  
this up, was fixaking off al] depen-  
dence upon the French, [ confen-  
ted to ftay,as I believed an offence  
offered at this crifis, might be at-  
tended with greater ill confequence  
than another day’s delay. They al-  
fo informed me that Shingifs could  
not get in his men; and was pre-  
vented from coming himfelf by his  
wife’s ficknefs, (1 believe, by fear  
of the French) but that the wam-  
pum of that nation was lodged  
with Kuftaloga one of their chiefs  
at Venango.  
  
In the evening late they came  
  
again and acquainted me that the  
  
Shannoahs were not yet arrived,  
tut that it fhould net retard the  
-profecution of our journey. He de-  
  
liveredin my hearing, the fpeeches  
‘that were to be made to the French  
by Jefkakake, onc of their ol¢ chiefs  
which was giving up the belt the  
Jate commandant had afked for,  
  
Laté Prefident of the United States.  
  
. Englifh fubject,  
  
and repeating near the fame fpeechy  
he himfelf had done befere.  
  
He alfo delivered a ftring of  
wampum to this chief which was  
fent by king Shingifs, to be giver  
to Kuftaloga, with orders to res  
pair ta the French, and deliver up  
the wampum.  
  
Fe likewife gave a very large  
ftring of black and white wampum  
which was ta be fent up. immedi~  
ately to» the fix nations, if the  
French refufed to quit the land at  
this warning; which was the  
third and jaft time, and was the  
right of this Jefkakake to deliver,  
  
goth. Lait night the great men  
aflembled at their council hou, to  
confult further about this journey,  
and who were to go: the refule of  
which was, that only three of theig  
chiefs, with one of theis beft hun-  
ters, fhould be our convoy. The  
reafon they gave for nat fending  
more, after what had been jSropo-  
fed at council the 26th, was, that  
a greater number might give the  
French f ufpicions of fome bad de~  
fign, and caufe- them to be treated  
rudely: but I rather think they  
could not get their hunters in.

This is,an old Indian town, fitu-  
ated at the mouth of French Creek  
on Ohio; and lies near N. about  
fixty miles from the Loggs town,

prired to it, to know where the  
commander refided. There were  
three officers, one of whom, capt.  
Joncaire, informed me, that he  
had the command of the Ohio:  
but that there was a genera! offi-  
cer at the near fort, where he advi-  
ed me to apply for an anfwer. He  
invited us to fup with them ; and  
treated us with the greateft com-  
plaifance.  
  
The wine, as they dozed them-  
felves pretty plentifully with it,  
foon banifhed the reftraint which  
at firft appeared in their converfa-  
tion ; and gave a lifcence to their  
tongues to reveal their fentiments  
more freely.  
  
They told me, that it was their  
abfolute defign to take poflefiion  
of the Ohio, and by G-—d they  
would do it: for that although  
they were fenfible&amp; the Englith  
could raife two men for their  
one;* yet they knew, their mo-  
tions were too flow and dilatory  
to prevent any undertaking of  
thews. They pretend to have  
an undoubted right to the ri-  
ver, from a difcovery made by one  
La Solle fixty years ago; and the  
rife of this expedition is, to pre-  
vent our fettling on the river or  
waters of it, as they had heard of  
fome families moving out in order  
thereto. From the bett intelligence  
J could get, there have been 1500  
menon this fide Ontario Lake;  
but upon the death of the general,  
all were recalled to about fix or  
feven hundred, who were left to  
garrifon four forts, one hundred  
and fifty or thereabouts in each.  
The firft of them is on French  
Creek, near a fmall Lake, about  
fixty miles from Venango, near  
N. N. W. The next lies on Lake

miles from the other. From this it  
is one hundred and tweniy miles to  
the carrying place, at the falls of  
Lake Erie, where-there is a final}  
fort; which they lodge their goods  
at, in bringing them from Mon.  
treal, the place whence all their  
ftores come from. The next: fort  
lies about twenty miles from this,  
on Ontario Lake. Between this  
fort and Montreal there are three  
others, the firft of which is nearly  
oppofite to the Englith fort Ofwe-  
go. From the fort on Lake Erie  
to Montreal is about fix hundred  
miles, which they fay requires no  
more, if good weather, than four  
weeks voyage, if they go in barks  
or large veiiels, fo that thes? may  
crofs the lake: but if they come  
in canoes it wiil require five or fix  
weeks, for they are obliged to keep  
under the fhore.  
  
5th. Rained exceffively all day,  
which prevented our travelling.  
Captain Joncaire fent for the half  
king, as he had but juft heard that  
he came with me: he affected to  
be much concerned that I did not  
make free to bring them in before.  
I excufed it in the beft manner I  
was capable, and told him, I did  
not think their company agreeable,  
as I had heard him fay a good deal  
in difpraife of Indians in general.  
But another motive prevented me  
from bringing them into his com-  
pany: [| knew he was interpreter,  
and a perfon of very. great influ-  
ence among the Indians, and had  
lately ufed all poflible means to  
draw them over to their intereft ;  
therefore I was defirous of giving  
no opportunity that could be avoi-  
ded.  
  
When they came in, there was  
great pleafure expreffed at feeing  
them. He wondered how they could  
  
be fo near without coming to vifit

him; made feveral trifling pre-  
fents; and applied liquor {fo faft,  
that they were foon rendered  
incapable of the bufinefs they came  
about, notwithftanding the cau-  
tion which was given.  
  
. 6th. The half king came tomy  
tent, quite fober, and infifted ve-  
ry much that I fhould ftay and  
bear what he had to fay to the  
French. I fain would have preven-  
ted his fpeaking any thing, till he  
came to the commandant; but  
could not prevail. He told me,  
that at this place a council fire was  
kindled, where, all their bufinefs  
with thefe people was to. be tranf-  
acted: and that the management  
of the Indian affairs was lett folely  
tomonfieur Joncaire. As I was  
defirous of knowing the iflue of  
this, I agreed to ftay: but fent  
our horfes a little ways up French  
Creek, to raft over and encamp;  
which I knew would make it near  
night.  
  
About 10 o’clock they met in  
council. The king fpoke much  
the fame as he had before done to  
the general ; and offered the French  
{peech belt which had before been  
demanded with the marks of four  
towns on it, which -monfieur Jon-  
caire refufed to recieve; but defired  
him to carry it to the fort to the  
cummander.  
  
7th. Monfieur La Force, com-  
miflary of the French ftores, and  
three other foldiers, came over to  
accompany us up. We found it  
extremely difficult to get the In-  
dians off to-day, as every ftrata-  
gem had been ufed to prevent their  
going up with me. I had laft night  
left John Davifon (the Indian in-  
terpreter) whom I brought with  
me from town, and ftrictly char-  
ged him not to be outof their com-  
pany, as I could aot get them over  
  
Late Prefident of the United Statess*

to my tent: for they had fome bu~  
finefs with Kuftaloga, chiefly to  
know the reafon why he did not  
deliver up the French belt which  
he had. in keeping: but I was  
obliged to fend Mr. Gift over to-  
day to fetch them; which he did  
with great perfuafion. |  
  
At 12 o’clock we fet out for the  
fort, and were prevented from ar-  
riving there till the rith, by exe  
ceflive rains, {nows, and bad tra-  
velling, through many mires and  
fwamps. Thefe we were obliged  
to pafs, to.avoid crofling the creek,  
which was impoflible either by  
fording or rafting, the water was  
fo high and rapid. dist.  
  
We pafled over much good fand  
fince we left Venango, and through  
feveral extenfive and very rich  
meadows ; one of which, I believe,  
was near four miles in length, and  
confiderably wide in fome places.

14th. As the fhow increafed vee  
ry fait, and our horfes daily became  
weaker, I fent them off unloaded  
under the care of Barnaby Currin,  
and two others, to make all conw  
venient difpatch to Venango, and  
there wait our arrival, if there was  
a profpect of the river’s freezing :  
if not, then to continue down ta  
Shannapin’s town, at the forks of  
Ohio, and there to wait till wecame  
to crofs Aligany ; intending myéelf  
to go down by water, as | had the  
offer of a canoe or two.  
  
As I found maay plots concers  
ted to retard the Indians’ bufinefs,  
and prevent .their returning with  
me; I endeavoured all that lay in  
my power to fruftrate their fchemes  
and hurry them an to execute their

ly prefied for admittance this evens  
ing, which at length was granted  
them, privately, with the comman-  
der and one or two other officers:  
‘The half kiag told me, that he ofs  
fered the wampum to the coms  
mander, who evaded taking it, and  
made many fair promifes of love  
and friendihip ; faid he wanted to  
live in peace, and trade amicably  
with them, as a proof of which he  
would fend fome goods immediates

our ftraggling traders they meet  
with, as I privately underftood  
they intended to carry an officer,

confirms this opinion, I was en-

about the boy who was carried by  
this place, as it was done while the  
command devolved on him be-

raly and the arrival of the prefent.  
He acknowledged, that a boy had  
been carried paft; and that the  
Indians had two or three white  
men’s fealps, (1 was told by fome  
ope Indians at Venango eight)  
but pretended to have forgotten the

would have prevailed at any o-

had engaged.  
  
We had a tedious and very fa-  
tiguing paflage down the creek.  
Several times we had like to have  
been ftaved againit the rocks;  
and many times were obliged all  
hands to get out and remain in  
the water half an hour or more,  
getting over the fhoals. At one  
place the ice had lodged and made  
it impaflable by water ; therefore  
we were obliged to carry our ca-  
noe acrofs a neck of land, a quar-  
ter of a mileover. We did not  
reach Venango, till the 22d,  
where we met with our horfes.  
  
This creek is extremely crook-  
ed. I dare fay the diftance be-  
tween the fort and Venango can’t  
be lefs than 120 miles to follow  
the meanders.

to fet off, I fent for the half king,  
to know whether he intended to  
go with us, or by water. He  
told me that White Thunder had  
hurt himfelf much, and was fick  
and unable to walk; therefore  
he was obliged tocarry him down  
in a canoe. As I found he in-  
tended to itay here a day or two  
and knew that Monfier Joncaire  
would employ every {cheme to fet  
him againit the Englith as he had  
before done; I told him I hoped  
he would guard againft his flat-

defired I might not be concerned,

to deliver a {peech for me to car-  
ry to his Honor the Governor.  
He told me he would order the  
young hunter to attend us, and  
get provifion, &amp;c. if wanted,  
  
Our horfes were now fo weak  
and feeble, and the baggage fo  
heavy (as we were obliged to  
provide all the neceflarics which  
the journey would require) that  
we doubted much their perform-  
ing it: Therefore myfelf and o-  
thers (except the drivers who  
were obliged to ride) gave up  
our horfes for packs, to affift a-  
long with the baggage. I put  
myfelfin an Indian walking drefs,  
and continued with them three  
days, till I found there was no  
probability of their getting home  
in any reafonable time. The hor-  
fes grew lefs able to travel every  
day ; the cold increafed very nuit;  
and the roads were becoming  
much worfe by a deep fnow, con-  
tinually freezing: Therefore, as  
I was uneafy to get back, to make  
report of my proceedings to his  
Honor the Governor, I determi  
ned to profecute my journey the  
neareft way through the woods,  
on foot.  
  
Accordingly I left Mr. Van-

with money and directions, to  
provide neceflaries from place to  
piace for themfelves and horfes,  
and to make the moit convenient

and provifions, I fet out with  
Mr. Gift, fitted im the fame man-  
ner, on Wednefday the 26th.  
The day following, juft after we  
had patted a place called the  
Murdering Town, (where we in-  
tended to quic the path, and fteer  
acrofs the country for Shanna-  
pins Tewn) we fell in with a  
arty of French Indians, who  
had laid in wait for us. One of  
them fired at Mr. Giftor me, not  
15 fteps off, but fortunately mif-  
fed. Wetook this fellow into  
cuftody, and kept him till about  
nine o’clock at night: Then let  
him go, and walked all the re-  
maining part of the night with-  
out makine any ftop; that we  
might get the ftart, fo far, as to  
be out of the reach of their pur-  
fuit the next day, fince we were  
well aflured they would follow  
our track as foon as it was light.  
The next day we continued tra-  
velling till quite dark, and got  
tothe river about two miles a-  
beve Shannapins. We expected  
to have found the river frozen,  
but it was not, only about 50  
yards from each fhore: The ice  
I fuppofe had broken up above,  
for it was driving in vait quan-  
tities.  
  
There was no way for getting  
over but on a raft: Which We  
fet about, with but one poor  
hatchet, and finithed juft after  
fun fetting. ‘his was a whole  
days work: We next got it  
launched, and went on board of  
it: Then fet off But before we  
were half way over, we were  
jammed in the ice, in fuch a man-  
ner that we expected every mo-  
ment our raft to fink, and our-  
felves to perifh. TF put out my  
fetting pole to flop the raft, that  
the ice might pais by; when the

rapidity of the ftream threw ic  
with fo much violence againft the  
pole, that it jirked ime out into  
ten feet water: But I fortunate-  
ly faved myfelf by catching hold  
of one of the raftlogs. Notwith-  
ftanding all our efforts, we could  
not get to either fhore; but were  
obliged, as we were near an  
ifland, to quit out raft and make  
to it.  
  
The cold was fo extremely  
fevere, that Mr. Gift had all his  
fingers, and fome of his toes fro-  
zen; and the water was fhut up  
fo hard, that we feund no dif-  
ficulty in getting off the ifland,  
on the ice, in the morning, and  
went to Mr. Frazier’s. We met  
here with 20 warriors who were  
going to the fouthward to war :  
But coming to a place upon the  
head of the great Kunnaway,  
where they found feven people  
killed and fealped: (all but one  
woman with very light hair)they  
turned about and ran back for fear  
the inhabitants fhould rife and  
take them as the authors of the  
murder. They report that the  
bodies were lying about the houfe,  
and fome of them much torn and  
eaten by hogs: By the marks  
which were left, they fay they  
were French Indians of the Or-  
toway nation, &amp;c. whe did it.

him till about nine o’clock at night; then let him go, and  
walked all the remaining part of the night, without making any  
flop, that we might get the fart fo far as to be out of the reach  
of their purfuit the next day, fince we were well affured that  
they would follow our track as foon as it was light. The next  
day we contined travelling till quite dark, and got to the river,  
about two miles above Shannapins. We expeéted to have found  
the river frozen, but it was not, only about fifty yards from  
each fhore: the ice I fuppofed had broken up above, for it was  
driving in vaft quantities.  
  
There was no way for getting over but on a raft, which we  
fet about with but one poor hatchet, and finifhed juft after fun.  
fetting. This was a whole day’s work ; we next got it launched;  
then went on board of it and fet off: but before we were half  
way over, we were jammed in the ice in fuch a manner, that we  
expeted every moment our raft to fink and ourfelves to perihh.  
I put out my fetting pole totry to ftop the raft, that the ice  
might pafs by : when the rapidity of the ftream threw ic with fo  
much violence againft the pole, that it jerked me out into ten feet  
water. But I fortunately faved myfelf, by catching hold on one  
the raft logs. Notwithftanding all our efforts, we could not get  
  
to either fhore; but were obliged, as we were near an ifland, to  
quit our raft and make to it.  
  
The cold was fo extremely fevere, that Mr. Gift had all his  
fingers and fome of his toes frozen ; and the water was {hut up  
fo hard, that we found no difficulty in getting off the ifland on  
the ice inthe morning, and went to Mr. Frazier’s. We met  
here with twenty warriors who were going to the fouthward to  
war. But coming toa place on the head of the Great Kanaw,  
where they found feven people killed and fcalped, (all but one  
woman with very light hair,) they turned about and ran back,  
for fear the inhabitants fhould rife, and take them as the authors  
of the murder. ‘They report that the bodies were lying about  
the houfe, and fome of them much torn and eaten by the hogs.  
By the marks which were left, they fay they were French Indi-  
ans of the Ottoway nation, &amp;c. who did it.

December to the 15th, there was but one day in which it did

steps off, but fortunately missed. We took the fellow into custody, and kept him till  
nine o’clock at night, then let him go, and walked the remaining part of the night with-  
out making any stop, that we might get the start so far as to be out of the reach of  
pursuit the next day, since we were well assured they would follow our track as soon as  
it waslight. The next day we continued travelling until quite dark, and got to the river  
about two miles above Shanopin. We expected to have found the river frozen, but it  
was not, except about fifty yards from the shore. The ice, I suppose, had broken up  
above, for it was driving in vast quantities.  
  
“There was no way of getting over but on a raft, which we set about with but one poor

off the island the next morning on the ice.”

 and pack on my back, in which were my papers and pro.

we had passed a place called Murdering Town, (where  
we intended to quit the path and steer across the country for  
Shannopins Town,) we fell in with a party of French In.

Gist or me, not fifteen steps off, but fortunately missed.  
We took this fellow into custody, and kept him until about  
nine o&#x27;clock at night, then let him go, and walked all the re.

we might get the start so far, as to be out of the reach of

 would follow our track as soon as it was light. The next  
 day we continued travelling until quite dark, and got to the  
river about two miles above Shannopins. We expected to  
have found the river frozen, but it was not--only about fif.

up above, for it was dividing in vast quantities.  
&quot;There was no way for getting over but on a raft, which  
we set about making, with but one poor hatchet, and tinished  
 just after sun-setting. This was a whole day&#x27;s work; we next  
got it launched, then went on board of it and set off; but be­  
fore we were half way over, we were jammed in the ice in  
 such a manner, that we expected every moment our raft to

pidity of the stream threw it with such violence against the  
pole that it jerked me out into ten foot water; but I fortu.  
nately saved myself by catching hold of one of the raft logs,  
Notwithstanding all our efforts, we could not get to either  
shore, but were obliged, as we were near an island, to quit  
our raft and make for it.  
&quot;The cold was so intensely severe, that Mr. Gist had all  
his fingers and some of his toes frozen, and the water was  
shut up so hard that we found no difficulty in getting off the  
island on the ice in the morning, and went to Mr. Frazier&#x27;s.&quot;

ass by, when the rapidity of the

into ten feet water, but I fortunately  
saved myself by catching hold of one  
of the raft logs. Notwithstanding all  
our efforts, we could not get to either  
shore, but were obliged, as we were near  
an island, to quit our raft and make to  
it.  
&quot;The cold was so intensely severe,  
that Mr. Gist had all his fingers and  
some of his toes frozen, and the water  
was shut up so hard that we found no

« The excessive rains and vast quantities of snow which had fallen, pre-  
vented our reaching Mr. Frazier’s, an Indian trader, at the mouth of ‘Turtle  
creek, on Monongahela river, till Thursday the 22d. We were informed  
here, that expresses had been sent a few days before to the traders down  
the river, to acquaint them with the French general’s death, and the return  
of the major part of the French army into winter quarters.  
  
« The waters were quite impassable without swimming our horses, which  
obliged us to get the loan of a canoe from Frazier, and to send Barnaby  
Currin and Henry Steward down the Monongahela, with our baggage, to  
meet us at the forks of Ohio, about ten miles below; there, to cross the  
Allegheny.  
  
* As I got down before the canoe, | spent some time in viewing the rivers,  
and the land in the fork, which I think extremely well situated for a fort,  
as it has the absolute command of both rivers. ‘The land at the point is  
twenty-five feet above the common surface of the water ; and a considerable  
bottom of flat well timbered land all around it very convenient for building.  
The rivers are each a quarter of a mile or more across, and run here very  
nearly at right angles; Allegheny, bearing north-east; and Monongahela,  
south-east. The former of these two is a very rapid and swift running  
water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible fall.  
  
« About two miles from this, on the south-east side of the river, at the  
place where the Ohio company intended to erect a fort, lives Shingiss, king  
of the Delawares. We called upon him, to invite him to a council at  
Logstown.

«“ As [ had taken a good deal of notice yesterday of the situation at the  
fork, my curiosity led me to examine this more particularly, and I think it  
greatly inferior, either for defence or advantages ; especially the latter.  
For a fort at the fork would be equally well situated on the Ohio, and have  
the entire command of the Monongahela, which runs up our settlement,  
and is extremely well designed for water carriage, as it is of a deep, still  
nature. Besides, a fort at the fork might be built at much less expense,  
than at the other place.  
  
“‘ Nature has well contrived this lower place for water defence; but the  
hill whereon it must stand being about a quarter of a mile in length, and  
then descending gradually on the land side, will render it difficult and very  
expensive to make a sufficient fortification there. ‘The whole flat upon the  
hill must be taken in, the side next the descent made extremely high, or  
else the hill itself eut away : otherwise, the enemy may raise batteries with-  
| in that distance without being exposed to a single shot from the fort.

fort with six guns. The Black Islands are about a hundred and thirty  
leagues above the mouth of the Ohio, which is about three hundred and fifty  
above New Orleans. ‘They also acquainted me, that there was a small  
pallisadoed fort on the Ohio, at the mouth of the Obaish, about sixty  
leagues from the Mississippi. The Obaish heads near the west end  
of lake Erie, and affords the communication between the French on the  
Mississippi and those on the lakes. These deserters came up from the  
lower Shannoah town with one Brown, an Indian trader, and were going  
to Philadelphia.  
  
“ About three o’clock this evening the Half-King * came totown. I went  
up and invited him with Davidson, privately, to my tent ; and desired him  
to relate some of the particulars of his journey to the French commandant  
and of his reception there ; also, to give me an account of the ways and  
distance. He told me, that the nearest and levellest way was now impas-  
sable, by reason of many large miry savannas ; that we must be obliged to  
go by Venango, and should not get to the near fort in less than five or six  
nights sleep, good travelling. When he went to the fort, he said, he was  
received in avery stern manner by the late commander, who asked him  
very abruptly, what hehad come about, and to declare his business ; which  
he said he did in the following speech :  
  
««¢ Fathers, I am come to tell you your own speeches, what your own  
mouths have declared. Fathers, you, in former days, set a silver basin be-  
fore us, wherein there was the leg of a beaver, and desired all the nations  
to come and eat of it, to eat in peace and plenty, and not to be churlish to  
one another ; and that if any such person should be found to be a disturb-  
er, I here lay down by the edge of the dish a rod, which you must scourge  
them with ; and if your father should get foolish, in my old days, I desire  
you may use it upon me as well as others.  
  
« « Now, fathers, it is you who are the disturbers in this land, by coming  
and building your towns, and taking it away unknown to us, and by force.  
  
«¢ Fathers, we kindled a fire a long time ago, at a place called Montreal,  
where we desired you to stay, and not to come and intrude upon our land.  
I now desire you may despatch to that place; for be it known to you,  
fathers, that this is our land and not yours.

that rod which was laid down for the use-of the obstreperous. If you had

off this land.’  
  
“ This, he said, was the substance of what he spoke to the general, who  
made this reply :  
  
“* Now, my child, I have heard your speech ; you spoke first, and it is  
my time to speak now. Where is my wampum that you took away, with  
the marks of towns on it? ‘This wampum I do not know, which you have  
discharged me off the land with; but you need not put yourself to the  
trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you. Iam not afraid of flies or  
musquetoes, for Indians are such as those ; I tell you that down that river  
I will go, and build upon it, according to my command. If the river was  
blocked up, I have forces sufficient to burst it open, and tread under my  
feet all that stand in opposition, together with their alliances ; for my force  
is as the sand upon the sea shore ; therefore here is your wampum; I sling  
itat you. Child, you talk foolish; you say this land belongs to you, but  
there is not the black of my nail yours. I saw the land sooner than you  
did, before the Shannoahs and you were at war; Lead was the man who  
went down and took possession of that river. It is my land, and I will  
have it, let who will stand up for, or say against it. I will buy and sell  
with the English (mockingly.) If people will be ruled by me, they may  
expect kindness, but not else.’  
  
‘“‘ The Half-King told me he had inquired of the general after two Eng-  
lishmen, who were made prisoners, and received this answer.  
  
“« Child, you think it is a very great hardship that I made prisoners of  
those two people at Venango. Don’t you concern yourself with it; we  
‘ook and carried them to Canada, to get intelligence of what the English  
were doing in Virginia.’  
  
“‘ He informed me, that they had built two forts, one on lake Erie, * and  
another on French Creek, near a small lake, about fifteen miles asunder,  
  
  
  
* These two forts were one at Presquile, where Erie now stands; the other where the  
village of Waterford is situated.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
| and a large wagon road between. ‘They are both built after the same  
| model, but different in size; that on the lake the largest. He gave mea  
| plan of them of his own drawing.  
  
“ The Indians inquired very particularly after their brothers in Carolina  
  
goal.  
  
“They also asked what sort of a boy it was, who was taken from the  
South Branch ; for they were told by some Indians, that a party of French  
Indians had carried a white boy by Kuskuska Town,* towards the lakes.

18 THE OLDEN TIME.  
  
“ As 1 had orders to make all possible dispatch, and waiting here was  
  
very contrary to my inclination, I thanked him in the most suitable manner -  
  
I could, and told him that my business required the greatest expedition, and  
would not admit of that delay. He was not well pleased that I should offer  
to go before the time he had appointed, and told me, that hé could not con-  
sent to our going without a guard, for fear some accident should befall us,  
  
and draw a reflection upon him. Besides, said he, this is a matter of no |  
  
small moment, and must not be entered into without due consideration ; for  
I intend to deliver up the French speech-belt, and make the Shannoahs and  
Delawares do the same. And accordingly he gave orders to King Shingiss,  
who was present, to attend on Wednesday night with the wampum; and  
  
two men of their nation to be in readiness to set out with us the next |  
  
morning. As | found it was impossible to get off without affronting them  
in the most egregious manner, I consented to stay.  
  
“1 gave them back a string of wampum, which I met with at Mr. Fra- |  
  
zier’s, anl which they sent with a speech to his Honor the Governor, to  
  
inform him that three nations of French Indians, namely, Chippewas, ||  
  
Ottoways, and Orundaks, had taken up the hatchet against the English ;  
and desired them to repeat it over again. But this they postponed doing  
until they met in full council with the Shannoah and Delaware chiefs.  
  
**27th.—-Runners were despatched very early for the Shannoah chiefs.  
The Half-King set out himself to fetch the French speech belt from his  
hunting cabin.

s 28th.—He returned this evening, and came with Monakatoocha, and two  
other sachems to my tent; and begged (as they had complied with his  
honor the Governor’s request, in providing men, &amp;c.,) to know on what  
business we were going to the French? ‘This was a question I had all long  
expected, and had provided as satisfactory answers to as I could; which  
  
allayed their curiosity a little.  
  
** Monakatoocha informed me, that an Indian from Venango brought news,  
a few days ago, that the French had called all the Mingoes, Delawares, &amp;c.,  
together at that place; and told them that they intended to have been down  
  
| the river this fall, but the waters were growing cold, and the winter advanc-  
  
ing, which obliged them to go into quarters ; but that they might assuredly  
expeet them in the spring, with a far greater number ; and desired that  
they might be quite passive, and not intermeddie unless they had a mind  
  
| to draw all their force upon them: for that they expected to fight the Eng-  
  
lish three years, (as they supposed there would be some attempts made  
  
| to stop them,) in which time they should conquer. But that if they should  
  
prove equally strong, they and the English would join to cut them all off,  
and divide the land between them: that though they had lost their general  
  
_ and some few of their soldiers, yet there were men enough to reinforce  
  
| them, and make them masters of the Ohio.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
NOTICES OF THE SETTLEMENT. 19  
  
  
  
“ This speech, he said, was delivered to them by one Captain Joncaire,  
  
| their interpreter in chief, living at Venango, and a man of note in the army.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
29th.—The Half-King and Monakatoocha came very early, and begged  
  
me to stay one day more; for notwithstanding they had used all the dilf- |  
  
gence in their power, the Shannoah chiefs had not brought the wampum  
  
_ they ordered, but would certainly be in to-night; if not, they would delay  
me no longer, but would send it after us as soon as they arrived. When I |  
found them so pressing in their request, and knew that returning of wam- |  
  
pum was the abolishing of agreements; and giving this up was shaking off  
all dependence upon the French, I consented to stay, as 1 believe an of-  
fence offered at this crisis, might be attended with greater ill consequence,  
than another day’s delay. ‘They also informed me, that Shingiss could not  
get in his men; and was prevented from coming himself by his wife’s sick-  
ness ; (I believe, by fear of the French,) but that the wampum of that na-  
tion was lodged with Kustalogo, one of their chiefs at Venango.  
  
“In the evening, late, they came again, and acquainted me that the Shan-  
  
&#x27; noahs were not yet arrived, but that it should not retard the prosecution of  
  
our journey. He delivered in my hearing the speech that was to be made  
to the French by Jeskakake, one of their old chiefs, which was giving up  
the belt the late commandant had asked for, and repeating nearly the same  
  
_ speech he himself had done before.  
  
“ He also delivered a string of wampum to this chief, which was sent by  
  
King Shingiss, to be given to Kustalogo, with orders to repair to the French  
  
and deliver up the wampum.  
  
‘‘He likewise gave a very large string of black and white wampum,  
which was to be sent up immediately to the Six Nations, if the French re-  
fused to quit the land at this warning ; which was the third and last time,  
and was the right of this Jeskakake to deliver.  
  
‘* 30¢h.—Last night, the great men assembled at their council house, to  
consult further about this journey, and who were to go; the result of which  
was, that only three of their chiefs, with one of their best hunters, should  
be our convoy. ‘The reason they gave for not sending more, after what  
had been proposed at council the 26th, was, that a greater number might  
give the French suspicions of some bad design, and cause them to be treated  
rudely ; but I rather think they could not get their hunters in.  
  
“We set out about nine o’clock with the Half-King, Jeskakake, White  
‘Thunder, and the Hunter, and travelled on the road to Venango, where we  
arrived the fourth of December, without any thing remarkable happening  
but a continued series of bad weather.  
  
“This is an old Indian town, situated at the mouth of French creek, on  
Ohio ; and lies near north about sixty miles from the Logstown, but more  
than seventy the way we were obliged to go.  
  
“« We found the French colors hoisted at a house from which they had

driven Mr. John Frazier, an English subject. I immediately repaired to it,  
to know where the commander resided. ‘There were three officers, one of  
whom, Captain Joncaire, informed me that he had the command of the  
Ohio ; but that there was a general officer at the near fort, where he advised  
  
me to apply for an answer. He invited us to sup with them, and treated |  
  
us with the greatest complaisance.  
“The wine, as they dosed themselves pretty plentifully with it, soon  
  
_ banished the restraint which at first appeared in their conversation, and gave  
&#x27; a license to their tongues to reveal their sentiments more freely.  
  
“They told me, that it was their absolute design to take possession of the  
Ohio, and by G—d they would do it; for that, although they were sensi-  
ble the English coutd raise two men for their one, yet they knew their mo-  
tions were too slow and dilatory to prevent any undertaking of theirs.  
They pretend to have an undoubted right to the river from a discovery  
made by one La Salle, sixty years ago: and the rise of this expedition is,  
to prevent our settling on the river or waters of it, as they heard of some  
families moving out in order thereto. From the best intelligence I could  
get, there have been fifteen hundred men on this side Ontario lake. But  
upon the death of the General, all were recalled to about six or seven hun-  
dred, who were left to garrison four forts, one hundred and fifty or there-  
about in each. ‘The first of them is on French creek, near a small lake,  
about sixty miles from Venango, near north north-west; the-next lies on  
lake Erie, where the greater partof their stores are kept, about fifteen miles  
  
| from the other: from this it is one hundred and twenty miles to the carry-  
  
ing place, at the falls of lake Erie, where there is a small fort, at which they  
should lodge their goods in bringing them from Montreal, the place from  
whence all their stores are brought. ‘The next fort lies about tweniy miles  
from this, on Ontario lake. Between this fort and Montreal, there are three  
others, the first of which is nearly opposite to the English Fort Oswego.  
From the fort on lake Erie to Montreal is about six hundred miles, which,  
they say, requires no more (if good weather,) than four weeks voyage, if  
they go in barks or large vessels, so that they may cross the lake: but if  
they come in canoes, it will require five or six weeks, for they are obliged  
to keep under the shore.  
  
* December 5th.—Rained excessively all day, which prevented our  
travelling. Captain Joncaire sent for the Half-King, as he had but just  
heard that he came with me. He affected to be much concerned that I did  
not make free to bring them in before. 1 excused it in the best manner of  
whieh I was capable, and told him I did not think their company agreeable,  
as I had heard him say a good deal in dispraise of Indians in general; but  
another motive prevented me from bringing them into his company ; I  
knew that he was an interpreter, and a person of great influence among the  
Indians, and had lately used all possible means to draw them over to his

interest ; therefore I was desirous of giving him no opportunity that could |  
  
be avoided.  
  
_ * When they came in, there was great pleasure expressed at seeing them. |  
He wondered how they could be so near without coming to visit him, |  
  
made several trifling presents, and applied liquor so fast, that they were  
  
_ soon rendered incapable of the business they came about, notwithstanding  
| the caution which was given.  
  
“ 6th.—The Half-King came to my tent, quite sober, and insisted very  
much that I should stay and hear what he had to say to the French. I  
fain would have prevented him from speaking any thing until he came to  
the commandant, but could not prevail. He told me, that at this place a  
council-fire was kindled, where all their business with these people was to  
be transacted, and that the management of the Indian affairs was left solely  
to Monsieur Joncaire. As I was desirous of knowing the issue of this, I  
agreed to stay ; but sent our horses a little way up French Creek, to raft  
over and encamp; which I knew would make it near night.  
  
“ About ten o’clock they met in council. ‘The King spoke much the |  
same as he had done before to the general; and offered the French speech- |  
  
belt which had before been demanded, with the marks of four towns on it,  
  
| which Monsieur Joncaire refused to receive, but desired him to carry it to  
  
the fort to the commander.  
  
“&#x27;7th.—Monsieur La Force, commissary of the French stores, and  
  
| three other soldiers, came over to accompany us up. We found it extremely  
| difficult to get the Indians off to-day, as every stratagem had been used to  
  
prevent their going up with me. I had last night left John Davidson (the  
  
| Indian interpreter.) whom I brought with me from town, and strictly  
  
| charged him not to be out of their company, as I could not get them over  
  
to my tent; for they had some business with Kustalogo, chiefly to know  
why he did not deliver up the French speech-belt which he had in keeping ;  
but I was obliged to send Mr. Gist over to-day to fetch them, whieh he did  
with great persuasion.  
  
“ At twelve o’clock, we set out for the fort, and were prevented arriving  
there until the 11th by excessive rains, snows, and bad travelling through  
many mires and swamps: these we were obliged to pass to avoid crossing  
the creek, which was impassible, either by fording or rafting, the water  
was so high and rapid.  
  
“« We passsed over much good land since we left Venango, and through  
several very extensive and rich meadows, one of which, I believe, was  
nearly four miles in length, and considerably wide in some places.  
  
“*12th.—I prepared early to wait upon the commander, and was received  
  
and conducted to him by the second officer in command. I acquainted  
him with my business, and offered my commission and letter; both of

which he requested me to keep until the arrival of Monsieur Reparti, cap-  
tain at the next fort, who was sent for and expected every hour.  
  
“The commander is a knight of the military order of St. Louis, and  
named Legardeur de St. Pierre. He is an elderly gentleman, and has  
much the air of a soldier. He was sent over to take the command imme-  
diately upon the death of the late general, and arrived here about seven  
days before me.  
  
“ At two o’clock, the gentleman who was sent for arrived, when I offered  
  
  
  
the letter, &amp;c., again, which they received, and adjourned into a private  
  
apartment for the captain to translate, who understood a little English.  
  
_ After he had done it, the commander desired I would walk in and bring my  
  
interpreter to peruse and correct it, which I did.  
13th.—The chief officers retired to hold a council of war, which gave  
  
| me an opportunity of taking the dimensions of the fort, and making what  
| observations 1 could.  
  
“Ji is situated on the south or west fork of French Creek, near the  
water ; and is almost surreunded by the creek, and a small branch of it,  
which form a kind of island. Four houses compose the sides. The bas-  
tions are made of piles driven into the ground, standing more than twelve  
  
_ feet above it, and sharp at the top, with port-holes cut for cannon, and loop-  
  
holes for the small arms to fire through. ‘There are eight six pound pieces  
mounted in each bastion, and one piece of four pounds before the gate. In  
the bastions are a guard-house, chapel, doctor’s lodging, and the commander’s  
private store, round which are laid platforms for the cannon and men to  
stand on. ‘There are several barracks without the fort, for the soldiers’  
dwellings, covered, some with bark, and some with boards, made chiefly of  
  
| logs. ‘There are also several other houses, such as stables, smith’s

«I could get no certain account of the number of men here; but, accord-  
ing to the best judgment I could form, there are a hundred, exclusive of offi-  
cers, of whom there are many. I also gave orders to the people who  
were with me, to take an exact account of the canoes, which were hauled  
up to convey their forces down in the spring. ‘This they did, and told  
fifty of birch bark, and a hundred and seventy of pine; besides many  
others, which were blocked out, in readiness for being made.  
  
“14th.—As the snow increased very fast, and our horses daily became  
weaker, I sent them off unloaded, under the care of Barnaby Currin and  
two others, to make all convenient dispatch to Venango, and there to wait  
our arrival, if there was a prospect of the river’s freezing: if not, then  
to continue down to Shanapin’s town ;* at the forks of Ohio, and there to  
  
  
  
* Shanapin’s was an Indian town, situated on the east side of the Allegheny river, extending  
from the two mile run down towards the Forks.

by water, as I had the offer of a canoe or two.  
“As I found many plots concerted to retard the Indians’ business, and  
  
  
  
|| prevent their returning with me; I endeavored all that lay in my power to |  
  
frustrate their schemes, and hurried them on to execute their intended |  
  
design. They accordingly pressed for admittance this evening, which at  
  
length was granted them, privately, to the commander and one or two |  
other officers. ‘The Half-King told me that he offered the wampum to the |  
commander, who evaded taking it, and made many fair promises of love |  
  
and friendship ; said he wanted to live in peace and trade amicably with  
them, as a proof of which, he would send some goods immediately down  
to the Logstown for them. But I rather think the design of that is, to  
bring away all our straggling traders they meet with, as I privately under-  
stood they intended to carry an officer, &amp;c., with them. And what rather  
confirms this opinion, I was inquiring of the commander by what authority  
he had made prisoners of several of our English subjects. He told me  
  
that the country belonged to them ; that no Englishman had a right to trade  
  
upon those waters ; and that he had orders to make every person prisoner  
  
| who attempted it on the Ohio, or the waters of it.  
  
“T inquired of Captain Reparti about the boy that was carried by ‘this  
place, as it was done while the command devolved on him, between the  
  
death of the late general, and the arrival of the present. He acknowledged |  
  
that a boy had been carried past; and that the Indians had two or three  
white men’s scalps, (I was told by some of the Indians at Venango, eight)  
  
but pretended to have forgotten the name of the place where the boy came |  
  
from, and all the particular facts, though he had questioned him for some  
hours, as they were carrying past. I likewise inquired what they had  
done with John Trotter and James M’Clocklan, two Pennsylvania traders,  
whom they hed taken with all their goods. ‘They told me that they had  
been sent to Canada, but were now returned home.  
  
« This evening, I received an answer to his honor, the Governor’s letter  
from the commandant.

forward my journey as much as he could. He protested he did not keep  
them, but was ignorant of the cause of their stay ; though I soon found it  
out. He had promised them a present of guns, &amp;c., if they would wait  
until the morning. As I was very much pressed by the Indians to wait

the present, they then endeavored to try the power of liquor, which I doubt  
not would have prevailed at any other time than this: but I urged and in-  
sisted with the King so closely upon his word, that he refrained, and set off  
with us as he had engaged.

times we had like to have been staved against rocks ; and many times were  
obliged all hands to get out and remain in the water half an hour or more,  
getting over the shoals. At one place, the ice had lodged, and made it im-  
Pony by water; we were, therefore, obliged to carry our canoe across

“23d.—When 1 got things ready to set off, I sent for the Half-King, to  
know whether he intended to go with us, or by water. He told me that  
White Thunder had hurt himself much, and was sick, and unable to walk ;  
  
| therefore, he was obliged to carry him down in a canoe. As I found he  
&#x27;| intended to stay here a day or two, and knew that Monsieur Joncaire would  
&#x27;| employ every seheme to set him against the English, as he had before done

Indian walking dress, and continued with them three days, until I found  
there was no probability of their getting home in reasonable time. The  
borses became less able to travel every day; the cold increased very fast ;  
and the roads were becoming much worse by a deep snow, continually  
freezing: therefore, as | was uneasy to get back, to make report of my  
proceedings to his Honor the Governor, I determined to prosecute my  
  
| journey, the nearest way through the woods, on foot.  
  
“Accordingly, I left Mr. Vanbraam in charge of our baggage, with money  
and directions to provide necessaries from place to place for themselves and  
horses, and to make the most convenient dispatch in travelling.  
  
“I took my necessary papers, pulled off my clothes, and tied myself up in  
a watch coat. ‘Then, with gun in hand, and pack on my back, in which  
were my papers and provisions, I set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same  
manner, on Wednesday the 26th. ‘The day following, just after we had  
passed a place called Murdering town, (where we intended to quit the path  
and steer across the country for Shannapin’s town,) we fell in with a party  
of French Indians, who had laid in wait for us. One of them fired at Mr.  
Gist or me, not fifteen steps off, but fortunately missed. We took this fel-  
low into custody, and kept him until about nine o’clock at night, then let  
him go, and walked all the remaining part of the night without making any  
stop, that we might get the start, so far, as to be out of the reach of their  
pursuit the next day, since we were well assured they would follow our  
track as soon as it was light. ‘The next day we continued travelling until  
quite dark, and got to the river about two miles above Shannapin’s. We  
expected to have found the river frozen, but it was not, only about fifty yards  
from each shore. The ice I suppose had broken up above, for it was driv-  
ing in vast quantities.  
  
“ There was no way for getting over but on a raft; which we set about,  
with but one poor hatchet, and finished just after sun setting. ‘This was a  
whole day’s work: we next got it launched, then went on board of it, and  
set off: but before we were half way over, we were jammed in the ice, insuch  
a manner, that we expected every moment our raft to sink, and ourselves to  
perish. I put out my setting pole to try to stop the raft, that the ice might  
pass by; when the rapidity of the stream threw it with so much violence  
against the pole, that it jerked me out into ten feet water: but I fortunately  
saved myself by catching hold of one of the raft logs. Notwithstanding  
all our efforts, we could not get to either shore, but were obliged, as we  
were near an island to quit our raft and make to it.  
  
“The cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. Gist had all his fingers  
and some of his toes frozen, and the water was shut up so hard, that we  
  
  
  
found no difficulty in getting off the island on the ice in the morning, * and |

going to the southward to war; but coming to a place on the head of the  
Great Kenhawa, where they found seven people killed and scalped (all but  
one woman with very light hair,) they turned about and ran back, for fear  
the inhabitants should rise and take them as the authors of the murder.  
They report that the bodies were lying about the house, and some of them  
much torn and eaten by the hogs. By the marks which were left, they  
say they were French Indians, of the Ottoway nation, who did it.

them, I went up about three miles to the mouth of the Youghiogany, to  
  
| visit Queen Aliquippa, who had expressed great concern that we passed  
  
her in going to the fort. I made her a present of a watch-coat and a bottle  
of rum, which latter was thought much the better present of the two.  
* Tuesday, the first of January, we left Mr. Frazier’s house, and arrived  
  
at Mr. Gist’s, at Monongahela, the second, where | bought a horse and saddle. |  
  
The sixth, we met seventeen horses loaded with materials and stores for a  
fort at the Fork of the Ohio, and the day after, some families going out to  
settle. ‘This day, we arrived at Will’s Creek, after as fatiguing a journey  
as it is possible to conceive, rendered so by excessive bad weather. From  
the first day of December to the fifteenth, there was but one day on which  
it did not rain or snow incessantly; and throughout the whole journey, we  
met with nothing but one continued series of cold, wet weather, which  
occasioned very uncomfortable lodgings, especially after we had quitted our  
tent, which was some screen from the inclemency of it.  
  
“On the 11th I got to Belvoir, where I stopped one day to take necessary  
rest ; and then set out and arrived in Williamsburg the 16th, when I wait-  
ed upon his Honor the Governor, with the letter I had brought from the

and chief study throughout the prosecution of it.”

“‘ We rose early in the morning, and set out about two o’clock, and got  
to the Murderingtown on the south-east fork of Beaver Creek. Here  
we met an Indian, whom I thought I had seen at Joncaire’s, at Venango,  
when on our journey up to the French fort. ‘This fellow called me by my  
Indian name, and pretended to Le glad to see me.  
  
“I thought very ill of the fellow, but did not care to let the Major know  
I mistrusted him. But he soon mistrusted him as much as I did. The  
| Indian said he could hear a gun from his cabin, and steered us more north-  
wardly. We grew uneasy, and then he said two whoops might be heard  
from his cabin. We went two miles further. Then the Major said he  
  
| The Major saw him point his gun towards us, and he fired. Said the  
Major, ‘Are you shot?’ ‘No,’ said 1; upon which the Indian ran for-  
ward to a big standing white oak, and began loading his gun, but we were  
soon withhim. J would have killed him, but the Major would not suffer  
  
  
  
  
  
took care of him. Either the Major or I always stood by the guns. We |  
made him make a fire for us by a little run, as if we intended to sleep there. |  
I said to the Major, ‘As you will not have him killed, we must get him |  
away, and then we must travel all night ;? upon which I said to the Indian,  
‘I suppose you were lost, and fired your gun.’ He said he knew the way  
to his cabin, and it was buta little way. ‘* Well,’ said I, ‘do yougo home ;  
and, as we are tired, we will follow your track in the morning, and  
here is a cake of bread for you, and you must give us meat for it in the |  
morning.’ He was glad to get away. I followed him, and listened, until  
he was fairly out of the way ; and then we went about a half a mile, when  
we made a fire, set our compass, fixed our course, and travelled all night.  
In the morning we were on the head of Piny Creek.”

own mouths have declared. Fathers, you,  
in former days, set a silver basin before  
us, wherein was the leg of a beaver, and  
desired all the nations to come and eat of  
it, to eat in peace and plenty, and not to  
be churlish to one. another; and that if  
any such person should. be found to be a  
disturber, I here lay down by the edge  
of the dish a rod which you must sco  
them with; and if your father should  
get foolish in my old days, I desire you  
may use it upon me as well as others.;  
  
“ Now, fathers, it is you who are the  
disturbers in this land, by coming and  
building your towns, and taking it away  
unknown to us, and. by force. &#x27;  
  
“ Fathers, we kindled a fire-a longtime  
ago, at a place called Montreal, where we  
desired you to stay, and:not to. come? and  
intrude upon our land. -I now desire you  
may dispatch to. that place, for, be it.  
known to you, fathers, that. this is:our

brothers the English, have heard this, and  
I come now to tell it to you; forl am  
not afraid to discharge you off this land.”  
  
The French commandant seems to have  
replied in a very truculent spirit, as re-  
  
by the Indian chief:  
  
“Now, my child, I have heard your  
speech ; you spoke first, but it is my time  
to speak now. Where is my wampum,  
that you took away with the marks of  
towns upon it? This wampum I do not  
know, which you have discharged me off  
the land with; but you need not put your-  
self to the trouble of speaking, for I will  
not hear you. I am not afraid of flies or  
musquitoes, for Indians are such as those ;  
I tell you, down that river I will go, and  
build upon it, according to my command.  
If the river was blocked up, I have forces  
sufficient to burst it open, and tread under  
my feet all that stand in opposition, to-  
gether with their alliances ; for my force is  
as the sand upon the sea-shore; therefore  
here is your wampum; I sling it at you.  
Child, you talk foolish ; you say this land  
belongs to you, but there is not the black  
of my nail yours. I saw that land sooner  
than you did. before the Shannoahs and  
you were at war; Lead was the man who  
went down and took possession of that  
river. It is my land, and I will have it,  
let who will stand up for or say against  
it. I will buy and sell with the English.  
If people will be ruled by me they may  
expect kindness, but not else.”  
  
Mr. Sparks, remarking upon these  
speeches, says well, “The high-minded  
savage was not aware that, as far as he  
and his race were concerned, there was

at the mouth of French Creek, on the Ohio,  
“without any thing remarkable ha  
ing,” says Washington, “but a continued  
series of bad weather.”  
  
Here they fell in with Captain Joncaire,  
an interpreter, and one who had great in-  
fluence over the Indians. He assumed to  
be the commander of the Ohio, but re-  
commended to the young commissioner to  
carry his business to the general, who had  
his quarters at the near fort. At first the  
French were extremely civil, but when  
the wine began to go round, they verified  
the proverb by telling much that they had  
intended to conceal: that it was their  
absolute design to take possession of the  
Ohio, and that they would do it too; for  
although they knew the English could  
raise two men for their one, yet their  
motions were too slow and dilatory to  
prevent any undertaking of the French.  
Captain Joncaire plied the Indians with  
liquor, and used every possible artifice to  
entice them to go no further, but after  
much difficulty the party was once more  
on the road, and, travelling four days  
more through “ excessive rains, snows, and  
bad travelling through many mires and  
swamps,” they at length sashes the fort

of the Ohio,  
  
The Sieur St. Pierre was profuse in  
civilities, but did every thing in his power  
to separate the Indian convoy from the  
party. Washington says, in the journal,  
  
“T cannot say that ever in my life I

new hardships in the new way of travel.  
“ Several times,” writes the chief, in his  
Report, “we had like to have been staved  
against rocks; and many times we were  
obliged, all hands, to get out and remain  
in the water half an hour or more, getting  
over the shoals. At one place the ice had  
lodged and made it impassable by water ;  
we were therefore obliged to carry our  
canoe across the neck of land, a quarter of  
a mileover. We did not reach Venango till  
the 22d, where we met with our horses.”

“There was no way for getting over but  
on a raft, which we set about with one  
poor hatchet, and finished just after sun-  
setting. This was one whole day’s work.  
We next got it launched, then went on  
board of it and set off; but before we  
were half way over, we were jammed in  
the ice in such a manner that we e  
every moment our raft to sink and our-  
selves to perish. I put out my setting-  
pole to try to stop the that the ice  
might pass by, when the rapidity of the  
stream threw it with so much violence  
against the pole, that it jerked me out into  
ten feet water, but I fortunately saved  
myself by catching hold of one of the raft-  
logs: Notwithstanding all our efforts, we  
could not get to either shore, but were  
obliged, as we were near an island, to  
quit our raft and make to it. The cold  
was so extremely severe that Mr. Gist  
had all his fingers and some of his toes  
frozen, and the water shut up so hard  
that we found no difficulty in getting off  
the island on the ice in the morning.”  
  
We have seen several picturings of the  
scene on the raft, and one of Washington  
struggling in the icy water, but we should  
like to see one that would express the  
condition of the two half-frozen travellers

one continued series of cold, wet weather,

at that time no human being resided. “As I got down before the canoe,  
I spent some time in viewing the river and the land in the fork, which I  
think extremely well suited for a fort, as it has the absclute command of  
both rivers. The land at the point is 25 feet above the common surface of  
the waters, and has a considerable bottom of flat, well-timbered land all  
around it, very convenient for building. The rivers are each a quarter of a  
mile across, and run very nearly at right angles, Alleghany bearing north-  
east and Monongahela bearing southeast. The former is a very rapid  
and swift-running water—the other deep and still, without any perceptible

“ Fathers, I am come to tell you your own  
speeches—what your own word.« have declared.  
Fathers, you, in former days, set a silver basin  
before us, wherein there was the leg of a bea¬  
ver (symbol of thrift and confederation), and  
desired all the nations to come and eat of it, to  
eat in peace and plenty, and not to be churlish  
to one another; and if any such person should  
be found to be a disturber, I here lay down by the  
edge of the basin a rod, which you must scourge  
them with ; and if your father should get fool¬  
ish in his old days, I desire you to use it upon  
me os well as the others.”

“ Now, fathers, it it you who are the disturbers in  
this land; you come and build your towns, and  
take away the land unknown to us by force.  
  
“ Fathers, we kindled a fire, a long time ago,  
at a place called Montreal, where we desired you  
to stay, and not come and intrude upon our  
land. I now desire you to go back to that  
place; for, be it known to you, fathers, this land  
is our land, and not yours.  
  
“ Fathers, I desire you may hear me in civil¬  
ness ; if not, we must handle that rod which was  
laid down by the basin for the use of the ob¬  
streperous.”  
  
An honorable and timely warning. Tanacha

It seems that the French were considered more aggres-  
sive than the English by some of the Ohio tribes, whose  
chief, called the ‘‘ Half King,” repaired to a French post  
on the shores of Lake Erie, where he made the following  
complaint : ‘‘ Fathers, you are the disturbers of this  
land, by building towns and taking the country from us  
by fraud and force. We kindled a fire a long time since  
at Montreal, where we desired you to stay, and not to  
come and intrude upon our land. I now advise you to  
return to that place, for this land is ours. If you had  
come in a peaceable manner, like our brothers the Eng-  
lish, we should have traded with you as we do with  
them. But that you should come and build houses on  
our land and take it by force, is what we cannot sub-  
mit to. Both you and the English are white. We live  
in a country between you both; the land belongs to  
neither of you. The Great Being allotted it to us as a  
residence. So, fathers, I desire you, as I have desired  
our brothers the English, to withdraw, for I will keep  
you both at arm’s-length. Whichever most regards this  
request, that side we will stand by and consider our  
friends. Our brothers the English have heard this, and  
I now tell it to you, for I am not afraid to order you off

was opened from Presque Isle to Le Beeuf. Washington visited Fort Le  
Boeuf late in the year 1753, and thus describes it in his journal:  
  
It is situated on the south, or west, fork of French creek, near the water, and is almost surrounded  
by the creek and a small branch of it, which form a kind of island. Four houses compose the sides.  
The bastions are made of piles driven into the ground, standing more than twelve feet above it, and  
sharp at the top, with port-holes cut for cannon, and loop-holes for the small arms to fire through. There  
are eight six-pound pieces mounted in each bastion, and one piece of four pounds before the gate. In  
the bastions are a guard house, chapel, doctor&#x27;s lodging and the commander&#x27;s private store, round which  
are laid platforms for the cannon and men to stand on. There are several barracks without the fort for the  
soldiers’ dwellings, covered some with bark and some with boards, made chiefly of logs, There are  
also several other houses, such as stables, smiths’ shops, etc.

another fort at an Indian town called Ganagarahare, at the mouth o

cluded that it was greatly inferior, “either for defence or advantages,” to  
the point. “A fort at the fork,” he observes, “would be equally well  
situated on the Ohio, and have the entire command of the Monongahela,  
which runs up our settlement, and is extremely well designed for water  
carriage, as it is of a deep, still nature. Besides, a fort at the fork might be  
built at much less expense than at the other place. Nature has well con-  
trived this lower place for water defence,” he continues ; “ but the hill where-  
on it must stand being a quarter of a mile in length, and then descending  
gradually on the land side, will render it difficult and very expensive to  
make a sufficient fortification there. The whole flat upon the hill must be  
taken in, the side next the descent made extremely high, or else the hill  
itself must be cut away; otherwise, the enemy may raise batteries within  
that distance without being exposed to a single shot from the fort.”

“We kindled a fire a long time ago, at a place called Montreal, where we  
desired you to stay, and not-to come and intrude upon our land. I now  
desire you may dispatch to that place; for be it known to you, fathers,  
that this is our land and not yours.” To this speech the French officer  
replied: “You need not put yourself to the trouble of speaking, for I will  
not hear you. I am not afraid of flies or mosquitoes, for Indians are such  
as those ; I tell you, that down that river I will go, and build upon it, ac-

seashore ; therefore, here is your wampum ; I sling it at you.” The Half-  
King informed Washington that the nearest and most level way to the

he would be obliged to go by way of Venango, and that he would not

ton describes it as “an old Indian town, situated at the mouth of French  
Creek, on Ohio; and lies near north about sixty miles from the Logstown,  
but more than seventy the way we were obliged to go.”  
  
Here Washington met Captain Joncaire. He found him and two other  
French officers at a house upon which the French colors were flying. This  
house was one from which John Frazier, an English trader and gunsmith,  
had been driven by Celoron some years before.’ Washington immediately  
repaired to this house, to inquire where the French commander resided.  
Joncaire treated him very affably; told him that he, Joncaire, had com-  
mand of the Ohio, but that there was a general officer at the near fort—  
Fort Le Boeuf—and advised him to apply there for an answer to Governor  
Dinwiddie’s letter ; and ended by inviting him to sup with him and his  
brother officers. “The wine,” says Washington, “as they dosed themselves  
pretty plentifully with it, soon banished the restraint which at first ap-  
peared in their conversation, and gave a license to their tongues to reveal  
their sentiments more freely.” They told him, among other things, that it  
was their absolute design to take possession of the Ohio, and they vowed  
their determination to do it; for though they were sensible the English  
could raise two men to their one, yet they knew the motions of the Eng-  
lish were too slow and dilatory to prevent any enterprise that the Frenc

The next day it rained excessively, and Washington was prevented from  
resuming his journey. Meantime Joncaire had learned that the Half-  
King had come to the town in Washington’s party, and pretended to be  
much concerned that Washington had not made free to bring him and the  
other sachems to the house. ‘I excused it in the best manner of which I  
was capable,” says Washington, “and told him I did not think their com-  
pany agreeable, as I had heard him say a good deal in dispraise of Indians  
in general. But another motive prevented me from bringing them into his  
company. I knew that he was an interpreter, and a person of great influ-  
ence among the Indians, and had lately used all possible means to draw  
them over to his interest ; therefore I was desirous of giving him no oppor-  
tunity that could be avoided.” However, Joncaire sent for the chiefs, and  
when they came in he expressed great pleasure at seeing them. He  
wondered, he said, how they could be so near without coming to visit him.  
He was quite effusive over them. He made them several trifling presents,  
and treated them so abundantly with fire-water that in a short time they  
were as drunk as possible, in spite of all of Washington’s advice.

that detaining the Indians, since they were part of his company, was de-  
taining him. St. Pierre protested he did not keep them, but that he was  
ignorant of the cause of their delay. The cause was not difficult to learn—  
he had promised them a present of guns, etc., if they would wait until the  
next morning. As the Indians were very desirous of remaining, Washing-  
ton consented, on a promise that nothing should hinder them in the  
morning.  
  
The next day, the 16th, the French renewed their attempts to detain the  
Indians still longer; but Washington held the Half-King so closely to his  
word that he at length set off as he had promised. The passage down the  
creek was very tedious and fatiguing. A number of times the canoes came  
near being staved against the rocks, and frequently all hands were obliged  
to get out and remain in the water half an hour or more, getting over the  
shoals. Such had been the difficulties of the voyage that they did not  
reach Venango until the 22d. Here they found the horses waiting for  
them.

The next day Washington resumed his journey. “When I got things  
ready to set off,” he says, “I sent for the Half-King to know whether he  
intended to go with us, or by water. He told me that White Thunder had  
hurt himself much, and was sick, and unable to walk; therefore, he was  
obliged to carry him down in a canoe. AsI found he intended to stay  
here a day or two, and knew that Monsieur Joncaire would employ every  
scheme to set him against the English, as he had before done, I told him I  
hoped he would guard against his flattery, and let no fine speeches influence  
him in their favor. He desired I might not be concerned, for he knew the  
French too well for anything to engage him in their favor ; and that though  
he could not go down with us, he yet would endeavor to meet at the forks  
with Joseph Campbell, to deliver a speech for me to carry to his Honor the  
Governor. He told me he would order the Young Hunter to attend us,  
and get provision, etc., if wanted.  
  
“Our horses were now so weak and feeble, and the baggage so heavy  
(as we were obliged to provide all the necessaries which the journey would  
require), that we doubted much their performing it. Therefore, myself and  
the others, except the drivers, who were obliged to ride, gave up our horses  
for packs, to assist along with the baggage. I put myself in an Indian walk-

ing dress, and continued with them three days, until I found there was no  
probability of their getting home in reasonable time. The horses became  
less able to travel every day; the cold increased very fast ; and the roads  
were becoming much worse by a deep snow, continually freezing ; therefore,  
as I was uneasy to get back, to make report of my proceedings to his Honor  
the Governor, I determined to prosecute my journey the nearest way  
through the woods, on foot.  
  
“ Accordingly, I left Mr. Vanbraam in charge of our baggage, with  
money and directions to provide necessaries from place to place for them-  
selves and horses, and to make the most convenient dispatch in traveling.  
  
“TI took my necessary papers, pulled off my clothes, and tied myself up  
in a watch coat. Then, with gun in hand, and pack on my back, in which  
were my papers and provisions, I set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same  
manner, on Wednesday, the 26th. The day following, just after we had  
passed a place called Murdering town (where we intended to quit the path  
and steer across the country for Shannopin’s town), we fell in with a party  
of French Indians, who had laid in wait for us. One of them fired at Mr.  
Gist or me, not fifteen steps off, but fortunately missed.* We took this  
fellow into custody, and kept him until about nine o’clock at night, then let  
him go, and walked all the remaining part of the night without making any  
stops, that we might get the start, so far as to be out of the reach of their  
pursuit the next day, since we were well assured they would follow our tracks  
as soon as it was light. The next day we continued traveling until quite  
dark, and got to the river about two miles above Shannopin’s. We expected  
to have found the river frozen, but it was not, only about fifty yards from  
each shore. The ice, I suppose, had broken up above, for it was driving in  
vast quantities.  
  
“ There was no way for getting over but on a raft; which we set about,  
with but one poor hatchet, and finished just after sunsetting. This was a  
whole day’s work; we next got it launched, then went on board of it and  
set off, but before we were half-way over we were jammed in the ice in such  
a manner that we expected every moment our raft to sink and ourselves to  
perish. I put out my setting pole to try to stop the raft that the ice might  
pass by, when the rapidity of the stream threw it with so much violence

Complying with his request, he desired Half King to re-  
late some of the particulars of a journey to the French  
commandant and of his reception there, and also to com-  
muniéate some of the ways and distances. Half King  
told Washington that the nearest and levelest way was  
then impassable by reason of many large miry savannas ;  
  
  
  
that he must go by Venango (now Franklin, in Venango  
County, Pa.), and could not get to the near fort in less  
than five or six days. He stated that he was received at  
the fort in a very stern manner by the commander, who  
asked him what he wanted, and to declare his business,  
which he said he did in the following speech: ‘‘ Fathers,  
I am come to tell you your own speeches—what your own  
mouths have declared. Fathers, you in former days  
set a silver basin before us, wherein was the leg of a  
beaver, and desired all the nations to come and eat of  
it—to eat in peace and plenty—and not to be churlish to  
one another ; and that if any such person should be  
found to be a disturber, I here lay down by the edge of  
the dish a rod, which you must scourge them with.  
And if your father should get foolish in my old days, I  
desire you may use it upon me as well as others.  
  
‘*Now, fathers, it is you who are disturbers in this  
land, by coming and building your towns and taking it  
away unknown to us, and by force.  
  
‘* Pathers, we kindled a fire a long time ago at a place ©  
called Montreal, where we desired you to stay, and not  
to come and intrude upon our land. I now desire you  
may dispatch to that place, for, be it known to you,  
fathers, that this is our land and not yours.  
  
‘** Fathers, I desire you may hear me in civilness ; if  
not, we must handle the rod which was laid down for  
the use of the obstreperous. If you had come in a peace-  
ful manner like our brothers, the English, we would not  
have been against your trading with us as they do; but  
to come, fathers, and build houses upon our land, and to  
take it by force, is what we cannot submit to.  
  
‘*Fathers, both you and the English are white; we  
live in a country between. Therefore, the land belongs  
neither to one nor the other. But the Great Being above  
allowed it to be a place of residence for us. So, fathers,  
I desire you to withdraw, as I have done our brothers,  
the English, for I will keep you at arm’s-length. I lay  
this down as a trial for both, to see which will have the  
greatest regard to it, and that side we will stand by and  
make equal shares with us. Our brothers, the English,  
have heard this, and I come now to tell it to you, for I  
am not afraid to discharge you off this land.”  
  
The French general replied to this speech in a defiant  
spirit, expressing a determination to go down the river  
and build upon it according to his command, adding :  
‘Child, you talk foolish. You say the land belongs to  
you; but it is my land, and I will have it, let who wil

ton spoke as follows : ‘‘ Brothers, I have called you to-  
gether in council, by order of your brother, the Governor  
of Virginia, to acquaint you that Iam sent with all pos-  
sible dispatch to visit and deliver a letter to the French  
commandant, of very great importance to your brothers,  
the English ; and, I dare say, to you, their friends and  
allies.  
  
**T was desired by the Governor, your brother, to call  
upon you, the Sachems of the Nations, to inform you of  
it, and to ask your advice and assistance to proceed by  
the nearest and best road to the French. You see,  
brothers, I have gotten thus far on my journey.  
  
**His Honor likewise desired me to apply for some of  
  
  
  
  
  
your young men to conduct and provide provisions for  
us on our way, and be a safeguard against those French  
Indians who have taken up the hatchet against us. I  
have spoken thus particularly to you, brothers, because  
His Honor, our Governor, treats you as good friends and  
allies, and holds you in great esteent. To confirm what  
I have said, I give you this string of wampum.”  
  
After they had considered for some time on the above  
discourse, Half King got up and spoke :  
  
** Now, my brother, in regard to what my brother, the  
Governor, had desired of me, I return you this answer :  
  
“IT rely upon you as a brother ought to do; as you  
say, we are brothers and one people. We shall put our  
heart in hand :nd speak to our fathers, the French, con-  
cerning the speech they made to me ; and you may de-  
pend that we will endeavor to be your guard.  
  
‘Brother, as you have asked my advice, I hope you  
will be ruled by it, and stay until I can provide a com-  
pany to go with you. The French speech-belt is not  
here ; I have to go for it to my hunting-cabin. Likewise,  
the people whom I have ordered in are not yet come, and  
cannot until the third night from this ; until which time,  
brother, I must beg you to stay.”

thanked Half King, stating his business would not admi

that there was a general officer at the near fort, on French

communicative, under the influence of the wine in which  
they had freely indulged. They avowed their absolute de-  
sign to take possession of the Ohio, and would do it;

In his journal Washington says : ‘‘ We had a tedious and  
very fatiguing passage down the creek. Several times we  
had like to have been staved against rocks, and many  
times all hands were obliged to get out and remain in the  
water half an hour or more, getting over the shoals. At  
one place the ice had lodged and rendered it impassable  
by water, and we had to carry our canoe across the neck  
of land a quarter of a mile. We did not reach Venango

NoTE II.—The reply of the French commandant  
at Fort Le Boeuf to the Half King as related by the  
latter to Washington, at Logstown, on the twenty-  
fifth of November, 1753, was as follows:  
  
‘*Now, my child, I have heard your speech. You  
spoke first, but it is my time to speak now. Where  
is my wampum that you took away with the marks  
of towns upon it? This wampum I do not know,  
which you have discharged me off the land with  
[referring to some presented by the Half King at his  
speech just given]. But you need not put yourself  
to the trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you.  
I am not afraid of flies or mosquitoes, for Indians  
are such asthose. I tell you, down the river I will  
go, and will build upon it according to my command.  
If the river was blocked up, I have forces sufficient  
to burst it open and tread under my feet all that  
stand in opposition, together with their alliances; for  
my force is as sand upon the sea shore; therefore,  
here is your wampum, I fling it at you. Child, you  
talk foolish. You say this land belongs to you, but  
there is not the black of my nail yours. I saw that  
and sooner than you did, before the Shawanese and  
you were at war. Lead was the man who went  
down and took possession of that river. It is my  
land, and I will have it, let who will stand up for, or  
say against it. I will buy and sell with the English  
(moekingly). If people will be ruled by me, they  
may expect kindness, but not else.”

three officers—one of whom, Captain  
Joncaire, informed me that he had the  
command of the Ohio [as the Alleghany  
was still frequently spoken of]; but  
that there was a general officer at the  
near fort [Le Boeuf], where he advised  
me to apply for an answer. He invited  
us to sup with them and treated us with  
the greatest complaisance. The wine,  
as they dosed themselves plentifully  
with it, soon banished the restraint  
which at first appeared in their conver-  
sation, and gave a license to their  
tongues to reveal their sentiments more  
freely. They told me that it was their  
absolute design to take possession of  
the Ohio [meaning the Alleghany and  
Ohio combined], and by G— they  
would do it; for that, although they  
were sensible the English could raise  
two men for their one, yet they knew  
their motions were too slow and dila-  
tory to prevent any undertaking of theirs.  
They pretend to have an undoubted  
right to the river from a discovery made  
by one La Salle, sixty years ago; and  
the rise [object] of this expedition is to  
prevent our settling on the river or  
waters of it, as they heard of some fami-  
lies moving out in order thereto.”

Boeuf, where they arrived on the elev-  
enth. “ Ourinterpreter”’ [Van Braam],  
says Gist, “gave the commandant no-

The next day Washington prepared  
early to wait upon the commander—  
Legardeur de Saint-Pierre—and was re-  
ceived and conducted to him by the  
second officerincommand. The major  
acquainted him with his business and  
offered his commission and letter, both  
of which Legardeur desired him to keep  
until the arrival of the captain in com-  
mand of Fort Presquisle, who had been  
sent for and who was expected every  
hour. Washington describes the French  
commander as an elderly gentlemen  
who had much the air of a soldier.  
“‘ He was sent over to take the command  
immediately upon the death of the late  
general [Marin], and arrived here about  
seven days before me,’ are Washing-  
ton’s words. At two o’clock the cap-  
tain from the other fort arrived, when  
  
the major again offered his passport,  
commission and the letter, which they  
received, and adjourned into a private  
apartment for the captain to translate,

without the fort for the soldiers’ dwell-  
ings, covered, some with bark and some  
with boards made chiefly of logs. There  
were also several other houses near,  
such as stables, smiths’ shops and the  
like.

Fort Le Beoeuf; “but,” says he, “ ac-

S1r :—As I have the honor of commanding here

which you wrote to the commandant of the French  
troops. I should have been glad had you given  
him orders or had he been inclined to proceed to

than to me to set forth the evidence and reality of  
the rights of the king, my master, upon the lands  
situated along the River Ohio and to contest the  
pretentions of the king of Great Britain thereto. I  
shall transmit your letter to the Marquis Duquesne.  
His answer will be a law to me; and if he shall  
order me to communicate it to you, sir, you may be

assured I shall not fail to dispatch it to you forth.  
with, :  
  
As to the summons you send me to retire, I do  
not think myself obliged to obey it. Whatever may  
be your instructions, I am here by virtue of the  
orders of my general; and I entreat you, sir, not to  
doubt for one moment but that I am determined to  
conform myself to them with all the exactness and  
resolution which can be expected from the best  
officer. I do not know that, in the progress of this  
campaign, anything has passed which can be reputed  
an act of hostility or that is contrary to the treaties  
which subsist between the two crowns, the continua-  
tion whereof as much interests and is as pleasing to  
us as to the English. Had you been pleased to  
have particularized the facts which occasioned your  
complaint, I should have had the honor of answer-  
ing you in the fullest, and, Iam persuaded, most  
satisfactory manner.  
  
{ have made it my particular care to receive Mr.  
Washington with a distinction suitable to your dig-  
nity as well as to his own quality and great merit.  
I flatter myself that he will do me this justice before  
you, sir, and that he will signify to you in the man-  
ner I do myself, the profound respect with which I  
am, sir, your most humble and most obedient ser-  
vant.*

where they intended to quit the path  
- and steer across the country for Shan-  
oppin’s town, they fell in with a party  
of French Indians who had lain in wait  
for them. “One of them,” says Major  
Washington, “fired at Mr. Gist or me,  
not fifteen steps off,}] but fortunately  
missed. We took this fellow into cus-  
tody and kept him till about nine  
o’clock at night; then let him go and  
walked all the remaining part of the  
night without making any stop, that we  
might get the start so far as to be out  
of the reach of their pursuit the next  
day, since we were well assured they  
would follow our tract as soon as it was  
light.* The next day we continued  
traveling till quite dark and got to the  
river [Alleghany] about two miles  
above Shannapins [Shanoppin’s]. We  
expected to have found the river frozen,  
but it was not, only about fifty yards  
from shore. The ice, I suppose, had  
broken up above, for it was driving in  
vast quantities.”  
  
‘“‘ There was no way of getting over,”  
continues Washington, “‘ but on a raft,  
which we set about making, with but one  
poor hatchet, and finished just after

sun-setting. This was a whole day’s  
work. We next got it launched and went  
on board of it, then set off; but before  
we were half way over we were jammed  
in the ice in such a manner that we ex-  
pected every moment our raft to sink  
and ourselves to perish. I put out my  
setting-pole to try to stop the raft that  
the ice might pass by, when the rapidity  
of the stream threw it with so much  
violence against the pole that it jerked  
me out into ten feet of water; but I  
fortunately saved myself by catching  
hold of one of the raft logs. Notwith-  
standing all our efforts, we could not  
get the raft to either shore, but were  
obliged, as we were near an island, to  
quit our raft and make to it.”  
  
“ The cold was so extremely severe,”  
adds the major, “ that Mr. Gist had all  
of his fingers and some of his toes  
frozen ; and the water was shut up so  
hard that we found no difficulty in get-

“Then,” continues Dinwiddie, “ they  
fully determined, with all the forces  
they could collect, which he [Washing-  
ton] understood would be fifteen hun-  
dred regulars, besides Indians, to go  
down the River Ohio [Alleghany and

Mr. Gist says: ‘‘ We rose early in the morning [of  
the twenty-seventh], and set out about two o&#x27;clock.  
Got to the Murthering town, on the southeast fork  
of Beaver creek. Here we met with an Indian  
whom I thought 1 had seen at Joncaire’s, at Ve-  
nango, when on our journey up to the French fort.  
This fellow called me by my Indian name, and pre-  
tended to be glad to see me. He asked us several  
questions as, how we came to travel on foot ; when  
we left Venango; where we parted with our horses,  
and when they would be there, etc. Major Wash-  
ington insisted on traveling on the nearest way to  
the forks of the Alleghany [now Pittsburgh]. We  
asked the Indian if he could go with us and show  
us the nearest way. The Indian seemed very glad  
and ready to go with us, upon which we set out, and  
the Indian took the major’s pack. We traveled  
very brisk for eight or ten miles when the major’s  
feet grew very sore and he very weary, and the  
Indian steered too much northeastwardly. The  
major desired to encamp, to which [when] the  
Indian asked to carry his gun, but he refused that, .  
and then the Indian grew churlish, and pressed us  
to keep on, telling us that there were Ottawa Indians  
in these woods and they would scalp us if we lay out ;  
but go to his cabin and we should be safe. J thought  
very ill of the fellow, but did not care to let the  
major know I mistrusted him. But he soon mis-  
trusted him as much as I. He said he could  
hear a gun to his cabin [that is, that they were so  
near his cabin that, if a gun was fired there, they  
could hear it where they then were] and [he] steered  
us more northwardly.’ We grew uneasy, and then  
he said two whoops might be heard to his cabin  
[that is, they were only twice as far away from his  
cabin as a whoop ‘could be heard]. We went two  
miles further, then the major said he would stay at  
the next water, and we desired the Indian to stop at  
the next water.”  
  
‘* Before we came to water,” adds Mr. Gist, ‘‘we  
came to a clear meadow; it was very light and snow  
on the ground. The Indian made a stop, [and]  
turned about. The major saw him point his gun to-  
ward us and fire. Said the major: ‘Are you shot?’  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
‘No,’ said I. Upon which the Indian ran forward  
to a big standing white oak, and began loading his  
gun; but we were soon with him. I would have  
killed him, but the major would not suffer me to do  
so. We let him chargehis gun; we found he put in  
  
a ball ; then we took care of him. The major or I  
always stood by the guns; we made him make a fire  
for us by a little nay, as if we intended to sleep there.  
I said to the major: ‘ As you will not have him killed  
we must get him away, and then we must travel all  
Upon which I said to the Indian: ‘I sup-  
He said he  
  
night.’

knew the way to his cabin and it was but alittle dis-  
tance. ‘Well,’ said I, ‘do you go home, and as we  
are much tired, we will follow your track in the  
morning; and here is a cake of bread for you, and  
you must give us meat in the morning.’ He was  
glad to get away. I followed him and listened until  
he was fairly out of the way, and then we set out  
about a half a mile, when we made a fire, set our  
compass and fixed our course and traveled all  
night.”

Str: As I Have the honor to be here the com-  
mander-in-chief, M. Washington delivered to me the  
letter which you wrote to the commandant of the  
French troops. I should have been pleased that  
you had given him order, or that he had been dis-  
posed to go to Canada to see our general to whom it  
better belongs than to me, to set forth the evidence  
of the incontestable rights of the king, my master,  
to the lands along the Ohio, and to refute the pre-  
tentions of the king of Great Britain thereto. I  
shall transmit your letter to M. the Marquis du  
Quesne. His reply will be law to me, and if he shall  
order me to communicate with you, you may be as-  
sured that I shall not fail to act promptly.  
  
As to the summons you send me to retire, I do not  
think Iam obliged to obey. Whatever may be your  
instructions, I am here by order of my general, and  
I beg you not to doubt for a moment but that I am  
determined to conform with the exactness and reso-  
lution which becomes a good officer. I do not know  
that in the progress of this campaign anything has  
passed which can be regarded an act of hostility, or  
contrary to the treaties between the two crowns, the  
continuation of which pleases us as much as it does  
the English, If you had been pleased to enter into  
particulars as to the facts which caused your com-  
plaint, I should have been honored to give as full  
and satisfactory reply as possible.  
  
I have made it a duty to receive M. Washington

and his personal worth. I have the honor to be,

Washington’s Journal: ‘‘ It is situated  
  
.on the South or West Branch of the  
  
French Creek, near the water, almost  
surrounded by the creek, and a small  
branch of it that forms a kind of island.  
Four houses composed the sides; the  
bastions were of piles driven into the  
ground, standing more than twelve feet  
above it, and sharp at the top; with port  
holes cut for cannon, and loop holes  
for small arms. There are eight six-  
pound pieces mounted in each bastion,  
and one four-pounder before the gate.  
In the bastions were a guard-house,  
chapel, surgeon’s lodgings, and a com-  
mandant’s pfivate store.’’
