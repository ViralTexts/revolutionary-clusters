May 10. 17.  
  
Your favor of Apr. 25th is duly recieved. I am very sensible of the partiality with which you are so good as to review the course I have held in public life; and I have also to be thankful to my fellow citizens for a like indulgence generally shewn to my endeavors to be useful to them. they give quite as much credit as is merited to the difficulties supposed to attend the public administration. there are no mysteries in it. difficulties indeed sometimes arise; but common sense and honest intentions will generally steer thro’ them, and, where they cannot be surmounted, I have ever seen the well-intentioned part of our fellow citizens sufficiently disposed not to look for impossibilities. we all know that a farm however large is not more difficult to direct than a garden, and does not call for more attention or skill.  
I hope with you that the policy of our country will settle down with as much navigation and commerce only as our own exchanges will require, and that the disadvantage will be seen of our undertaking to carry on that of other nations. this indeed may bring gain to a few individuals, and enable them to call off from our farms more laborers to be converted into lackies &amp; grooms for them; but it will bring nothing to our country but wars, debt, &amp; delapidation  dilapidation. this has been the course of England, and her examples have fearful influence on us. in copying her we do not seem to consider that like premisses induce like consequences. the bank-mania is one of the most threatening of these imitations. it is raising up a monied aristocracy in our country which has already set the government at defiance, and altho’ forced at length to yield a little on this first essay of their strength, their principles are unyielded and unyielding. these have taken deep root in the hearts of that class from which our legislators are drawn, and the sop to Cerberus from fable, has become history. their principles lay hold of the good, their pelf of the bad, and thus those whom the constitution had placed as guards to it’s portals, are sophisticated or suborned from their duties. that paper money has some advantages is admitted. but that it’s abuses also are inevitable and, by breaking up the measure of value, makes a lottery of all private property, cannot be denied. shall we ever be able to put a constitutional veto on it?   You say I must go to writing history. while in public life, I had not time: and now that I am retired, I am past the time. to write history requires a whole life of observation, of enquiry, of labor and correction. it’s materials are not to be found among the ruins of a decayed memory. at this day I should begin where I ought to have left off. the ‘solve senescentem equum’ is a precept we learn in youth, but for the practice of age; and were I to disregard it it would be but a proof the more of it’s soundness. if any thing has ever merited to me the respect of my fellow-citizens, themselves, I hope, would wish me not to lose it by exposing the decay of faculties of which it was the reward. I must then, dear Sir, leave to yourself and your brethren of the rising generation to arraign at your tribunal the actions of your predecessors, and to pronounce the sentence they may have merited or incurred. if the sacrifices of that age have resulted in the good of this, then all is well, and we shall be rewarded by their approbation, and shall be authorised to say ‘go ye, and do likewise.’ to yourself I tender personally the assurance of great esteem &amp; respect

Monticello, May 10, 1817.  
Dear Sir—Your lavor, April 25th, is duly re-1  
ceived. I am very sensible of the partiality  
with which you are so good as to review the  
course I. have held in public life; and I have also  
to be thankful to my fellow citizens for a like in­  
dulgence generally shewn to my endeavors to  
be useful to them. They give quite as much  
credit as is merited to the difficulties supposed  
to attend the public administration. There  
are no mysteries in it; difficulties indeed some­  
times arise, but common sense and honest in­  
tentions will generally steer through them; and  
where they cannot be surmounted, I have ever  
seen the well intentioned part ofourfeliow citi­  
zens sufficiently disposed not to look for impos­  
sibilities. We all know that a farm, however  
large, is not more difficult to conduct than a  
garden, and does not call for more attention or  
skill. 1 hope, with you, that the policy of our  
country will settle down with as much naviga­  
tion and commerce only as our exchanges will  
require, and that.the disadvantage will be seen  
of our undertaking to carry on that of other  
nations. This indeed may bring gain to a few  
individuals, and enable them to call off from  
our farms more labourers to be converted into  
lackies and grooms for them, but it will bring  
nothing to our country but wars, debt and di­  
lapidation. This has been the course of Eng­  
land, and her examples have fearful influence  
on us. In copying her, we do not seem to con­  
sider that like premises induce like consequence.,  
  
The brink mania is one of the most threatening  
of these imitations; it is raising-up a monied  
aristocracy in our country, which has already  
set the government at defiance, and although  
forced at length to yield a little on the first es­  
say oft their strength, their principles are un­  
yielded and unyielding. These have taken deep  
root in the hearts of that class from which our  
legislators are drawn, and the sop to Cerberus  
from fable, has become history. Their princi­  
ples lay hold of the good, their pelf of the bad;  
and thus, those whom the constitution had placed  
as guards to its portals, are sophisticated or su­  
borned from their duties That pajjer money has  
some advantages must be admitted, but its abu­  
ses also are inevitable, and by breaking up the  
measure of value, makes a lottery of all private  
properly, cannot be denied. Shall we ever be  
able to put a constitutional veto on it? You say  
I must goto writing history. While I was in  
public life I had no time, and now that I am re­  
tired I am past the time. To write history, re­  
quires a whole life of observation, of inquiry,  
of labour and correction. Its materials arc not  
to be found among the ruins of a decayed mem­  
ory. At this day I should begin where I ought  
to have left off. Theisolve senescentum equam,*  
is a precept we learnt in youth, but for the  
practice of age, and were .1 to disregard it, it  
would be but a proof the more of its soundness.  
If any thing has ever merited to me the respect  
of my fellow citizens, themselves I hope will  
wish me not to loose it, by expressing the de­  
cay of faculties of which it was the reward.  
I must then, dear sir, leave to yourself and  
your brethren of the rising generation, to ar­  
raign at your tribunal the actions ot your pre­  
decessors, and to pronounce the sentence they  
have merited or incurred. If the sacrifices ot  
that age have resulted in the good ol this, then  
all is well, and we shall be rewarded by their ap­  
probation, and shall be authorized to say,‘go ye  
and do likewise.” To yourself I render, per­  
sonally, the assurance of great esteem and re­  
spect, THOMAS JEFFERSON

In a letter to Dr. Josephus B. Stuart  
May 10, 1817, in speaking of our dispo­  
sition to imitate England, he says  
The bank mania is one of the most  
threatening of these imitations. It is  
raising up a moneyed aristocracy in our  
country which has already set the Govern­  
ment at defiance, and although forced at  
length to yield a little on this first essay  
of their strength, their principles are un­  
yielded and unyielding. These have  
taken deep root in the hearts of that class  
from which our legislators are drawn  
and the sop to Cerberus from fable has  
become history. Their principles lay hobd  
of the good, their pelf of the bad, and  
thus those whom the Cconstitution had  
placed as guards to its portals, are  
sophisticated or suborned from their du  
ties. That paper money has some advan  
tages is admitted. But that its abuses  
also are inevitable, and by breaking up  
the measure of value, makes a lottery  
of all private property, can not be denied  
Shall we ever be able to put a constitu­  
tional veto on it?&quot;
