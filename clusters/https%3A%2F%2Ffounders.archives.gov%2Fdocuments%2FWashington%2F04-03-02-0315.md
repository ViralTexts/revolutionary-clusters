Dear Sir  
Gunston-Hall Novemr 9th 1785.  
  
The Bearer waits on you with a Side of Venison (the first we have killed this Season) which I beg Your Acceptance of.  
I have heard nothing from the Assembly, except vague Reports of their being resolved to issue a Paper Currency: upon what Principles, or Funds, I know not; perhaps upon the old thread-bare Security, of pledging solemnly the Public Credit. I believe such an Experiment wou’d prove simular to the old vulgar Adage, of carrying a Horse to the Water. They may pass a Law to issue it, but twenty Laws will not make People receive it.

GEORGE MASON.  
One of the great and influential statesmen of Vir.­  
ginia in the days of the evolution and the consti­  
tution was George Mason. His sentiments upon irre.­  
deemable currency may be seen in the following  
extract from a letter written by him to General  
Washington in 1785:  
I have heard nothing from the Assembly  
except vague reports of their being resoived  
to issue a paper currency; upon what principle or  
funds I know not; perhaps upon the old threadbare  
security of pledging solemnly the public credit. I  
beneve such an experiment would prove similar to  
the old vulgar adage of carrying a horse to the  
water. They may pass a law to issue it, but twenty  
laws will not make the people receive it
