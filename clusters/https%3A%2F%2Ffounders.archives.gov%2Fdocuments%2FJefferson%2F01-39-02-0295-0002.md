A Copy of the letter of our Lord Jesus Christ found under a Stone, and carried to the City of Iconium, and published by a person belonging to the Lady Cuba, whereon was written the Commands of Our Lord Jesus Christ the Blessed Son of God. And signed by the Holy Elect Angel called Gabriel, Ninety Eight years after the Birth of our blessed Saviour Christ.  
The Letter &amp;c.  
“Whosoever worketh on the Sabbath Day shall be accursed.”  
“I Command you to go to God’s House of Prayer, and Keep the Lords Day Holy, without doing any manner of work thereon. You shall not idle nor misspend your time in dressing yourselves with superfluities of costly array of apparel and vain cloathing: for I will have that Day Kept Holy that your sins may be forgiven you. You shall Not break my Commandments, but observe and keep. I write them with My own Hand; so write them in your hearts. Study and observe they were written with my own Hand and Spoken by My own Mouth. You must not go alone to my Houses of Prayer, but make your servants of both sexes go with you, or any other person that is well disposed: And there learn My Commandments. You shall finish your work every Saturday by Four or Six O Clock in the evening, and then prepare for the Sabbath; which prepareation then begins.  
I advise you to Fast Five Fridays in the year; beginning at with Good Friday, and the four Fridays next after in memory of the Five Bloody and cruel wounds I received for all Mine Elect. Two through either Hand, two through either Leg, and One through my side to My Heart.  
You shall diligently and peaceably labour in your respective callings, in which God hath been Pleased to place you. You shall Love one another with Brotherly Love, for I Loved you, and gave myself for you.  
And cause them who are not Christians to come to my Ministers and receive Baptism and the Lords supper; Which are my two Holy Sacraments, and be made Members thereof. In so doing I will give you prosperity and Saveing Grace and Deliverance from Sin, with all Needfull Blessings, and Comfort and Keep you with all needfull Blessings from the temptations of every devil and infernal enemies. But surely he that doth not Keep My words shall be accursed and unprofitable to his own precious soul. I will also send hardness of heart upon them, till I have destroyed them; but especially upon hardned and impenitent unbelievers. He that giveth to the poor, Shall for the sake of Christ be rewarded. And Remember to keep Holy the Sabbath Day: For I arose from the dead on the Lords Day: and thereby have made it Holy, and to be kept Holy by My servants. And he that hath a Copy of this Letter written with my own Hand and which I spoke with my Mouth, if they sincerely and truly Keep it, not boasting of it to others, Shall be Blessed of Me: and if his sins be in number as the Stars of the sky, on his truly forsaking all and every of his evil deeds, and believing in Me shall be pardoned.   
But if believes not my words, I will send the plagues of destruction upon them and consume them, their Children and Cattle. And whoever shall have a Copy of this Letter, Keeping it in their Houses and with them, Nothing shall hurt them, Not pestilence lightning nor Thunder, if they truly and humbly put their Trust in the Father Son and Holy Ghost. And if a Woman be with Child or in labour, if a Copy of this be about her, and she humbly put her Trust in Me the Almighty God Jesus Christ, she shall be safely delivered of the Child.  
You shall have no news of Me, but by the Holy Scriptures, which only is the true Word of Me the Blessed God till the day of Judgment. All Mens Peace and Salvation shall be with them, and My Angels I will Commission to guard them who treasure up My precious Gospel in their hearts inwardly, lives outwardly and Houses openly: and make My Lovely Commands to Guide and Rule by Saveing Faith, their whole lives and conve

round and large, at the foot of a cross, eigh  
teen miles from Iconium, near a village called  
Mesopotamia. Upon the stone was written  
and engraved, “Blessed be he that shall turn  
me over.” All that saw it prayed to God ear­  
nestly, and desired that he would make known  
unto them the meaning of this writing, that

Gabriel, ninety-eight years after the death of  
our blessed Saviour, and carried by a person  
belonging to Lady Cubass, and made public  
in the city of Iconium, 4c.

‘Whoever worketh on the Sabbath day shall be cursed ; —I command you to go  
to Church and keep the Lord’s day holy, without doing any manner of work. You  
shall not idly mis-spend your time in bedecking yourselves with superfluities of  
costly apparel and in dresses, for I have ordained it a day of rest — I will have it  
kept holy that your sins may be forgiven you. You shall not break my command-  
ments, but observe and keep them. Written with my own hand—write them on  
your hearts and steadfastly observe this was written with my own hand, spoken by  
my own mouth. You shall not only go to Church yourselves, but also your man  
servants and oy maid servants, and observe my words and learn my command-  
ments ; you shall finish your labor every Saturday in the afternoon by six of the  
clock, at which hour the preparation for the Sabbath begins. I advise you to fast  
five Fridays in every year, beginning with good Friday, and to continue the four  
Fridays immediately following, in remembrance of the five bloody wounds which I  
received for all mankind. You shall diligently and peaceably labor in your  
respective vocations, wherein it hath pleased God to call you. You shall love one  
another with brotherly love, and cause them that are not baptised to come to  
Church and hear the holy Sacrament, viz: Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and be  
made members thereof: in so pears | I will give you long life and many blessings,  
and your land shall replenish and bring forth abundance. I will give you many  
blessings, and comfort you in the greatest temptations, and surely he that doth the  
contrary shall be cursed and unprofitable. I will also send hardness of heart upon  
them, until I have destroyed them, but especially upon the hardened and impenitent  
unbelievers ; he that hath given to the poor shall not be unprofitable.

WHOSOEVER worketh on the Sabbath Day shall be cursed; I com-  
mand you to go to church and keep the Lord’s day holy, without doing  
any manner of work. You shall not idly mispend your time in bedecking  
yourselves with superfluities of costly apparel and vain dresses, for I have

may be forgiven you : you shall not break my commandments, but observe  
and keep them, written with my own hand, write them in your hearts  
and steadfastly observe this was written with my own hand, spoken by  
my own mouth.  
  
You shall not only go to church yourselves, but also your man servants  
and your maid servants, and observe my words, and learn my command-  
ments; you shall finish your labour every Saturday in the afternoon at  
six o’clock, at which hour the preparation for the Sabbath begins. 1 ad-  
vise you to fast five days in every year, beginning with GOOD FRIDAY,  
and to continue four Fridays immediately following, in remembrance of  
the FIVE BLOODY WOUNDS I received forall mankind. You shall  
diligently and peaceably labour in your respective vocations, wherein it  
hath pleased God to call you. You shall love one another with brotherly  
love, and cause them that are not baptized to come to church and hear  
the holy sacrament, viz:—baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and be made  
members thereof; in so doing I will give you long life and many bless-  
ings, and your land shall replenish and bring forth abundance: I will  
  
  
  
give you many blessings, and comfort you in the greatest temptation ;  
and surely he that doth to the contrary shall be cursed and unprofitable.  
I will also send hardness of heart upon them, until I have destroyed them,  
but especially upon hardened and impenitent unbelievers. He that hath  
given to the poor shall not be unprofitable. Remember to keep holy the  
Sabbath day, for the seventh day I have taken to rest myself. He that

child and in labor, and a copy of this letter be about her, and she firmly

carried to the city Ixoniam, and there pub-  
lished by a person belonging to the Lady  
Cuba. On the letter was written the com-  
mandments of Jesus Christ, signed by the  
Angel Gabriel, seventy-four years after our  
Savior’s birth.  
  
The Savior bids His children come;  
Unto His arms of mercy run ;  
  
The mothers weep no more,  
  
For Christ will infant souls restore.  
  
A Letter of JESUS CHRIST:  
  
Whoever worketh on the Sabbath day  
shall be cursed. I command you to go to  
church, and keep the Lord’s day holy, with-  
out doing any manner of work; you shall  
not idly spend your time in bedecking  
yourself with superfluous apparel and vain  
dresses, for I have ordered a day of rest.  
I will have that day kept holy, that your  
sins be forgiven you. You shall not break  
my commandments, but observe and keep  
them; write them in your hearts, and  
steadfastly observe that this was written  
with my own hand, and spoken with my  
own mouth. You shall not only go to  
church yourself, but also send your men-  
servants and maid-servants, and observe  
my word and learn my commandments.  
You shall finish your labor every Saturday  
in the afternoon by six o’clock, at which  
hour the preparation for the Sabbath  
begins.  
  
Ancient City.  
  
I advise you to fast five Fridays every  
year, beginning with Good Friday, and  
continuing the four Fridays immediately  
following, in remembrance of the five  
bloody wounds which I received for all  
mankind.  
  
You shall diligently and faithfully labor  
in your respective callings wherein it has  
pleased God to call you. You shall love  
one another with brotherly love ; and cause  
them that are baptized to come to church,  
and receive the sacraments, Baptism and  
the Lord’s Supper, and to be made mem
