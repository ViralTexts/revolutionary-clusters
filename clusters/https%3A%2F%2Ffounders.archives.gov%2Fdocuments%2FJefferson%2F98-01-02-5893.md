Monticello, February 8, IS 2d. 5  
My Bear JeJ/erson,  
I dulv received your affectionate fitter of the  
third, ami perceive there are greater doubts  
than I had apprehended whether the Legisla­  
ture will indulge me in my request to iliem.  
It is part of my mortification to perceive that I  
had so far overvalued myself as to have count­  
ed on it with too much confidence. I see, in the  
failure of this hope, a deadly blast of all nxv  
peace of mind, during my remaining days. You  
kindly encourage me to keep up my spirits—  
but oppresed with disease, debility, age and  
embarrassed affairs, this is difficult For my­  
self, I should not regard a prostration of for­  
tune. But I am overwhelmed at the prospect  
of the situation in which I may leave my fami­  
ly; my dear and beloved daughter, the cherish­  
ed companion of my early life, and nurse of my  
age, and her children, rendered as dear to me as  
if my own, from having lived with them from  
their qraclle, left in a comfortless situation, hold  
up to me nothing but future gloom-k I should  
not care were life to end with the line I am  
writing, were it not’hat I may yet be of some  
avail to the family. Their affectionate devo­  
tion to me makes a willingness to endure life a |  
duty, so long as it can be of any use to them.—  
Yourself particularly, dear Jefferson, I consid­  
er as the greatest of the God-send; which Hcav- j  
en has gianied to me?—Without you, what j  
could I do under the difficulties now environing  
me? These have been produced in some de­  
gree by my own unskilful management, and de  
voting my time to the service of my country;  
but much also by the unfoitunate fluctuations  
in tlie value of our money, and the long con­  
tinued depression of farming business. But for  
the fast, I ain confident my debts might be paid  
leaving me Monticello and the Bedford esute.  
But where there are no bidders, property, how­  
ever great, is no resource for the payment of  
debts—all may go for a little or nothing.  
Perhaps, howeVer, even in this case, I may  
have no right to complain, as these.misfortunes j  
have been held back for my last days when lew  
remain to me. I duly acknowledge that I have  
gone through a long life, with fewer circum­  
stances of affliction than are the lot of most  
men—Uninterrupted health, a competence for  
every’ reasonable want, usefujness to my fillow­  
citizens, a good portion of their esteem, no om­  
plaint against the world which has sufficiently  
honored me, and above all, a family which has  
blessed me by their affection, and never by their  
conduct given me a moment’s pain. And should  
this my last request be grunted, I may vet close  
with a cloudless sun a long and serene day of  
life. Be assured, my dear Jefferson, that l have  
a just sense of the part you have contributed to  
this, and that I bear to vou unmeasured affix  
tion. THs JEFPF.KSON

Monticei.lo, February 8, lS2t&gt;.  
My dear Jefferson,  
I duly received your affectionate letter of the 8d, I  
and perceive there are greater doubts than I iiadap- j  
prehended whether the Legislature will indulge me  
in tny request to them. It is part of my mortifi­  
cation to perceive that I had so tar overvalued my­  
self as to have counted on it, with too much couii­  
dence. I see, in the failure of this hope, a deadly  
blast of all my peace of mind, during my remaining  
days. You kindly encourage me to keep up my  
spirits—but oppressed with disease, debility, age  
and embarrassed affairs, this is diffrult. For my­  
self, I should not regard a prostration of fortune.  
Rut I am overwhelmed at the prospect of the situ­  
ation in which I tnay leave my family ; my dear  
and beloved daughter, the cherished companion of  
tny early life, and nurse of my age, and her chil­  
dren, rendered as dear to tne as if my own, from

comfortless situation, hold up to me nothing hut

MOKTICF.LI.O. I EDIK-ARY 3, 1826.  
My .dear Jefferson,—I duly received  
your affectionate letter of the third, and  
perceive there are greater doubts thqn  
l had apprehended, whether the Legis­  
lature will indulge.nn? in-my request lo  
them. It is part of my mortification to  
perceive that 1 had so far overvalued  
myself as to have counted on it with too  
much confidence. 1 see, in the failure  
of this hope, a.deadly blast of all my  
peace of mind, during ray remaining  
days. You kindly encourage me to keep  
up my spirits—but oppressed with dis­  
ease, debility, qgn and embarrassed af­  
fairs, this is difficult. For myself, 1  
should not regard a prostration of for­  
tune. But 1 am overwhelmed «t the  
prospect of the situation in which 1  
may leave my family; my dear and be­  
loved daughter, the cherished compan­  
ion of my early life, and nurse of my  
age, and her children, rendered as dear  
to me as if my own, from having lived  
with them from their cradle, left in a  
comfortless situation, hold «p to me  
nothing but future gloom—an.l,l should  
not care were life to end with the line  
l am writing, were it not that 1 may yet  
be of same avail to tl.ie family. Their  
affectionate devotion to me makes a  
willingness to endure life a duty, so  
iong as it can-be of any use to them.—  
Yourself particularly, dear Jefferson, 1  
consider liie greatest of the God-sends  
which Heaven has granted to me? —  
Without you, what could I do under the  
difficulties now environing mu ? These  
have been produced in some degree by  
my own unskilful management, and de­  
voting my time to the service of my  
country ; but much also by the unfortu­  
nate fluctuations in the value of our  
money, and the- long continued depres­  
sion of farming business. Rut for the  
last, I am cotrfident my debts might be  
paid, leaving me Monticello anti the  
Bedford cslaie. Rut where there ar£  
no bidders, property however great, is  
no resource*for the payment of debts—  
all may go for little or nothing.  
(Perhaps, however, even in this case,  
I may have no light to complain, as  
these misfortunes have been held back  
for my last days when few remain to  
me. I duly acknowledge that 1 have  
gone through a long life with fewer  
circumstances of affliction than are the  
lot of most men. Uninterrupted health,  
a competence for every reasonable

plaint against the world, which has suf­  
ficiently honored me ; and above all, a

affection, and never by their conduct  
give&quot; ine a moment’? pain. And should  
this, my last request be granted, l may  
yet close a cloudless sun a long and se­  
rene day of life. Be assured, my dear  
Jefferson, that I have a just sense ofthe

: MOXTICELLO, FEE. 2, 1826,  
My Dear Jefferson—ll duly received your  
affectionate letier of the 3d, and perceive there  
are greaier doubts than 1 had apprehended  
whether the Legislature will indulge me in my  
request to them. Itis part of my mortifica­  
tion to perceive that I bhad so far overvalued  
myself as to have counted on it with two much  
confideace. I see in the failure of this hope a  
deadly blust of all my peace of mind, during  
iny remaining days. You kindly encourage  
me to keep up my spirits=—but pppressed with  
disease, debility, age, acd embarrassed aflairs,  
this is difficult. For myself, I should nat re­  
gard a prostration of fortupe. But T am  
overwhelmed at the prospect of the situa­  
tion in which I may leave iy family ; mv  
dear and beloved daughter, the clierished  
companion of my early life, and nurse of  
my age; and her childrer, rendered =2s dear  
to me as if my own, from Laving lived with  
them from their cradle, left in a comforiless  
situation, held vp to me nothi v bu! future  
glooin—and I should nat care were life to end  
with the line I am writing, were it not that I  
may yet be of sume avail to the famiiy. Their  
affectionate devotion to ime nakes a willing­  
ness to endure life a 4 duty, so lone as it can be  
of any use to them. Yourself particularly,  
dear Jefferson, I consider s the greatest of  
the God-sends which Heaven has granted to  
ine.— Without you, what conid | do vader the  
difficulties now environing me? These have  
been produced ia soime dogree by my owo un­  
skilful managewent, and devoting my tizie to  
the service of my country ; bnt inuch aiso by  
the urfortunate {uctuaians in the value of

confident my debts might be paid, leaving me  
Monticello and the Bedford estate. But where  
there are no bidders, property, however great,

may go for little or nothing.  
: »l;erhaps, however, even in this case, I may  
have no right to complain, as these misfor­  
tunes have been held back for my last days  
when few reinain to me. Iduly acknowledge  
that 1 have gone through a long life, with  
fewer circumstances of aflliction than are the

above all, a family which has blessed me by

my last request be granted, I may yet close

I duly received your affectionate letter of the  
third, and perceive there are greater doubts than 1  
had apprehended whether the Legislatiiie will in-  
dulge me ill my request to them. It is part of iny  
mortification to perceiie that 1 had so far ovenal-  
iied myself as to have counted on it wilii too nmeh  
confidence. I see, in the Failure of this hope, a  
deadly blast of all riy peace of uiiud, during my  
remain. ug days Von kindly encourage me to keep  
up my spirits — hut oppressed with disease, dphilily,  
age and embarrassed affairs, this is ditficnlt. For  
myself, 1 should not regards prostration ot fortune.  
But I am ovei-wlielined at the prospect of Jie situa-  
tion in which 1 may leave my family ; my dear and  
beloved daughter, the. clicnslicd coiiipanion of niy  
early life, and nurse of iny age, and her children,&#x27;

courage me to keep up my spirits—but  
oppiessed with disease, debiii&#x27;y. age

For myself, I should not regard a pros­
