ong the States according to their presumed contributions: that is to their ratio of Representation in Congress. The  
advantages of this rule are its certainty, &amp; its apparent equity. The objections to it may be that, on one hand, it  
would increase the comparative agency of the Federal Govt. and on the other that the money might not be expended on  
objects of general concern; the interests of particular States not happening to coincide with the general interest in  
relation to improvements within such States  
&quot;2. A rule for the Government of Grants for Light houses, and the improvement of Harbours and rivers, which  
will avoid the objects which it is desirable to exclude from the present action of the Government; and at the same time to  
do what is imperiously required by a regard to the general Commerce of the Country&quot;

ailed in the States, (as it has done with Congress) of dividing  
the expence of certain improvements, between the funds of the State, and the contributions of those locally interested in  
them.  
Extravagant and disproportionate expenditures, on Harbours, Light Houses &amp; other arrangements on the  
SeaBoard ought certainly to be controuled as much as possible. But it seems not to be sufficiently recollected that in  
relation to our foreign Commerce, the burden &amp; benefit of accomodating &amp;  
protecting it, necessarily go together, and must do so as long &amp; as far, as the public revenue continues to be  
drawn thro’ the Custom House. Whatever gives facility and security to navigation, cheapens imports; and all who consume  
them where ever residing, are alike interested in what has that effect. If they consume they ought, as they now do, to  
pay. If they do not consume, they do not pay. The consumer in the most inland State, derives the same advantage from the  
necessary &amp; prudent expenditures for the security of our foreign navigation, as the consumer in a maritime State.  
Other local expenditures, have not of themselves a correspondent operation  
&quot;3. The expediency of refusing all appropriations for internal improvements (other than those of the  
character last referred to, if they even be so called) until the national debt is paid; as well on account of the  
sufficiency of that motive, as to give time for the adoption of some Constitutional or other arrangement, by which the  
whole subject may be placed on better grounds; an arrangement which will never be
