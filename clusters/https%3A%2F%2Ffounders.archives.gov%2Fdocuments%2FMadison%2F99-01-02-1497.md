Sir,  
						Washington March 12th: 1807  
					  
					I am charged by His Majesty to express to the Government of the United States His Majesty’s perfect Confidence in their good Sense and Firmness in resisting the unjust Pretensions contained in the Decree issued by the French government at Berlin on the  
						21st: of November, which if suffered to take Effect, must prove so destructive to the Commerce of all Neutral Nations.  
					His Majesty has learnt that the Measures announced in this Decree have already, in some Instances, been carried into Execution by the Privateers of the Enemy, and there could be no doubt that His Majesty would have an indisputable Right to Exercise a just  
						Retaliation. Neutral Nations cannot indeed expect that The King should suffer the Commerce of his Enemies to be carried on through them, whilst they submit to the Prohibition which France has decreed against the Commerce of His Majesty’s Subjects. But though this Right of  
						Retaliation would unquestionably accrue to His Majesty, yet His Majesty is unwilling, except in the last Extremity, to have Recourse to Measures which must prove so distressing to all Nations not engaged in the War against France.  
					His Majesty therefore, with that Forbearance and Moderation, which have at all Times distinguished His Conduct, has determined for the present to confine Himself to the Exercise of the Power given Him by His decided Naval Superiority, in such a Manner only  
						as is authorized by the acknowledged Principles of the Law of Nations, and has issued an Order for preventing all Commerce from Port to Port of His Enemies, comprehending in this Order not only the Ports of France, but those of other nations, as, either in alliance with  
						France or subject to her Dominion, have by Measures of active Offence, or by the Exclusion of British Ships, taken a Part in the present War.  
					His Majesty feels an entire Confidence that the Moderation and Justice of His Conduct will be duly appreciated by the United States, and has charged me to express to This Government, in the strongest Terms, the Regret He has experienced  
						in being thus compelled in His own Defence to act in a Manner which must prove in some Degree embarrassing to the Commerce of Neutral Nations, and His sincere Desire to avoid any stronger Measures, to which however, if the Injustice and Aggression of His Enemies should not be  
						resisted by those Nations whose Rights and Interests are invaded by so flagrant a violation of all publick Law, it may be ultimately necessary for The King to have Recourse. I have the Honor to be, with great Respect &amp; Consideration, Sir, Your most  
						obedient humble Servant

I am charged by Ins m ijesty to express to the go

cree is,ncd by the French government at Berlin, on  
the ~ ! s t November, which, if sutler td t.. take effect,  
must prove so instructive to the commerce of all  
o utral notions.

expert that the king should softer the commerce ol  
his enemies to he carried on through them, whilst  
they submit to the prohibition which France has

unquestionably accrue to his majesty, yet his ma­  
jesty is unwilling, except in the last extremity, to  
have recourse to measuies which must prove so uis­  
tressing to all nations not engaged in the war against  
France.  
Ins majesty*, therefore, with that lorhearance and  
moderation which have at all times distinguished  
Ins conduct, has determined, for the present, to con­  
line liimsell to the exercise of the power given him  
by his dei ided naval superiority, iu such a manner  
only as is authorised by the acknowledged princi­  
ples ol the law of nations, and has issued an order

ports of France, hut those of other nations, as ei­  
ther in alliance with France, or subject to her do­  
minion, have by measures of active offence, nr by  
the exclusion of British ships, taken a part in the  
present war.  
His majesty feels an entire confidence that the I  
moderation and justice of this conduct will be du­  
ly appreciated by the United States, and has char-,  
ged nie to express to theirgovernment, in the stron- !  
gest terms, ihe regret he has experienced iu being  
thus compelled, iu his own defence, toad in a man­

however, if the injustice and aggression of ins ene-1

Washington, March 12, 1807.  
Sill,  
I am charged, bv his majesty, to express to  
the government of the United States, his m ijes­  
ty’s perfect confidence in their good sense and  
firmness, in resisting tbe unjust pretensions con­  
tained in the decree issued by the French govern­  
ment, at Berlin, on the 21st November, which, if  
suffered to take efier.t, must prove so destructive  
to the commerce of all neutral nations.  
His majesty has learnt, that the measures, an­  
nounced in Ibis decree, have already, in some in­  
stances, been carried into execution, by tbe pri  
vateers of tbe enemy ; and there could be no  
doubt that his majesty would have an indisputa­  
ble right to exercise a just retaliation. Neutral  
nations cannot, indeed, expert that the King  
should suffer the commerce of his enemies to he*  
carried on through them, whilst they submit to  
the prohibition which F rance has decreed against  
the commerce of his majesty’s subjects. But  
though this right of retaliation would, unquesti­  
onably, accrue to his maj: sty, yet his majesty is  
Unwilling, Except in the last extremity, to have  
recourse to measures, which must prove so dis­  
tressing to all nations not engaged in the war a­  
gainst France.  
  
in:, majesty, vacrciore, who mat iiirirenraiiti:  
;r.d *« »,•» ..i all times. distin­  
guished his conduct, lias deterrtiined, for the pre­  
sent, to confine himself to the exercise of the  
power given him by his decided naval superiori­  
ty, in such a manner only, as is authorised by the  
acknowledged principles of the law of nations,  
and has issued an order for preventing all com­  
merce, from port to port, of his enemies ; com  
preliendir.g, in this order, not only the ports of  
France, but those of other nations, ns either in  
alliance with France, or subject to her dominion,  
have, by measures of active offence, or by the ex­  
clusion of British ships, taken a part in the pre­  
sent war.  
I‘Iis m-jesty feels an entire confidence, that the  
moderation and justice of this conduct will he du­  
ly appreciate by the United States, and lias  
charged me to express to their government, in  
the strongest terms, the regret he has experien­  
ced in being thus compelled, in his own defence,  
to act in a manner which must prove, in some de­  
gree, embarrassing to the commerce of neutral  
nations, and his sincere desire to avoid any stron­  
ger measures ; to which, however, if the injus­  
tice and aggression of his enemies should not he  
resisted by those nations, whose rights and inte­  
rests are invaded by so flagrant a violation of all  
public law, it may be ultimately necessary for the  
king to have recourse.  
1 have the honor to be,  
With great respect and consideration,  
Sir,  
Your most obedient humble servant
