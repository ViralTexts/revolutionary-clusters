Philadelphia, October 8th, 1777  
  
If this Letter should happen to find you in Council, or in the Field, before you read another Sentence, I beg you to take the first opportunity of retiring, &amp; weighing well its important contents.  
You are perfectly acquainted with the Part I formerly took in the present unhappy contest. I was indeed among the first to bear my public testimony against having any recourse to threats, or even indulging a Thought of an armed opposition. The torrent, however, was too strong for my feeble efforts to resist. I wished to follow my Countrymen as far only as virtue &amp; the righteousness of their cause would permit me. I was, however, prevailed upon, among the rest of my clerical brethren in this City, to gratify the pressing Desires of my fellow-citizens, by preaching a sermon to one of the City battalions. I was pressed to publish this sermon, &amp; reluctantly consented. From a personal attachment of near 20 years standing, &amp; an high respect for your character in private as well as in publick life, I took the liberty of dedicating it to you. I had your affectionate thanks for my performance, in a letter, wherein you express, in the most delicate &amp; obliging terms, your regard for me, &amp; your wishes for a continuance of my friendship, &amp; approbation of your conduct.  
Farther than this I intended not to proceed. My sermon speaks for itself &amp; utterly disclaims the idea of independency. My sentiments were well known to my friends. I communicated them, without reserve, to many respectable members of congress, who expressed their warm approbation of them. I persisted to the very last moment, in using the prayers for my sovereign, tho’ threatned with insult from the violence of a party.  
Upon the declaration of independency, I called my vestry, and solemnly put the question to them, whether they thought it best for the peace &amp; welfare of the congregations to shut up the churches, or to continue the service without using the petitions for the royal family. This was the sad alternative. I concluded to abide by their decision, as I could not have time to consult my spiritual superiors in England. They deemed it most expedient, under such critical circumstances,  
  
to keep open the churches, that the congregations might not be dispersed, which we had great reason to apprehend.  
A very few Days after the fatal declaration of independency, I received a letter from Mr Hancock sent by Express to Germantown, where my Family were for the Summer Season, acquainting me that I was appointed chaplain to the congress, &amp; desired to attend them at 9 o’Clock the next morning. Surprized &amp; distressed by an event I was not prepared to expect, obliged to give an immediate answer, without the opportunity of consulting my friends, I rashly accepted the appointment. I could have but one motive for taking this step. I thought the churches in danger, and hoped by these means to have been instrumental in preventing those Ills I had so much reason to apprehend. I can, however, with truth declare that I then looked upon independency rather as an Expedient, and a hazardous one indeed, thrown out in terrorem, in order to procure some favourable terms, than a measure, that was seriously to be persisted in at all events. My sudden change of conduct will clearly evince this to have been my Idea of the matter.  
Upon the return of the committee of congress appointed to confer with Lord Howe, I soon discovered their real Intentions. The different Accounts which each member of the Committee gave of this conference, the time they took to make up the matter for the public view, and the amazing disagreement betwixt the news-paper account, and the relation I myself had from the mouth of one of the Committee, convinced me, that there must have been some unfair &amp; ungenerous Proceedure. Their Determination to treat on no other ground than that of independency, which put it out of his Lordship’s Power to mention any terms at all, was a sufficient proof to me, that independency was the idol, which they had long wished to set up, &amp; that rather than sacrifice this, they would deluge their Country in Blood.  
From this moment I determined upon my resignation, &amp; in the beginning of October 1776, sent it in form to Mr Hancock, after having officiated only two months &amp; three weeks. And from that Time, as far as my safety would permit, I have been opposed to all their measures. This circumstantial Account of my conduct I think due to the friendship you were so obliging as to express for me, and I hope will be sufficient to justify any seeming inconsistencies in the part I have acted.  
And now, my dear Sir, suffer me, in the language of truth and real affection, to address myself to you. All the world must be convinced, that you engaged in the service of your Country from motives perfectly disinterested. You resigned every thing that was dear to you. You abandoned all those Sweets of domestic life, of which your affluent fortune gave you an uninterrupted enjoyment. But had you? could you  
  
have had the least idea of matters being carried to such a dangerous extremity? Your most intimate friends at that time shuddered at the thought of a separation from the mother-country; and I took it for granted, that your Sentiments coincided with theirs. What have been the consequences of this rash &amp; violent measure? A Degeneracy of Representation—confusion of councils—Blunders without number. The most respectable characters have withdrawn themselves, and are succeeded by a great majority of illiberal &amp; violent men.  
Take an impartial View of the present congress. What can you expect from them? Your feelings must be greatly hurt by the representation from your native province. You have no longer a Randolph, a Bland or a Braxton, Men, whose names will ever be revered, whose demands never rose above the first ground on which they set out, and whose truly generous &amp; virtuous Sentiments, I have frequently heard with Rapture from their own lips. O my dear Sir! what a sad contrast? Characters now present themselves, whose minds can never mingle with your own. Your Harrison alone remains, and he disgusted with his unworthy associates.  
As to those of my own province, some of them are so obscure, that their very names have never met my ears before, &amp; others have only been distinguished for the Weakness of their understandings, and the violence of their tempers. One alone I except from the general charge. A Man of virtue, dragged reluctantly into their measures, and restrained by some false ideas of honour from retracting, after having gone too far. You cannot be at a Loss to discover, whose name answers to this character.  
From the new-England provinces, can you find one, that as a gentleman, you could wish to associate with? unless the soft &amp; mild address of Mr Hancock, can atone for his want of every other qualification necessary for the Station he fills. Bankrupts, Attorneys &amp; men of desperate fortunes are his Collegues.  
Maryland no longer sends a Tilghman, and a Protestant Carroll. Carolina has lost its Lynch, and the elder Middleton has retired.  
Are the Dregs of a Congress, then, still to influence a mind like yours? These are not the Men you engaged to serve. These are not the Men that America has chosen to represent her. Most of them elected by a little low Faction, and the few gentlemen, that are among them, now well known to be upon the Balance, &amp; looking up to your hand alone to move the beam. ’Tis you, Sir, and you only, that support the present Congress. Of this you must be fully sensible. Long before they left Philadelphia, their Dignity &amp; Consequence was gone. What must it be now, since their precipitate Retreat? I write with freedom, but without  
  
Invective. I know these things to be true; and I write to one, whose own Observation must have convinced him that they are so.  
After this view of congress, turn to the Army. The whole world knows, that its very existence depends upon you, that your Death or Captivity disperses it in a Moment, and that there is not a Man on that Side the Question in America capable of succeeding you. As to the Army itself, what have you to expect from them? Have they not frequently abandoned even yourself in the hour of extremity? Have you, can you have the least Confidence in a Sett of undisciplined Men, &amp; Officers, many of whom have been taken from the lowest of the People, without Principle, without Courage. Take away those, that surround your Person, how very few are there, that you can ask to sit at your Table?  
Turn to your little Navy—Of that little, what left? Of the Delaware fleet, part are taken, the rest must soon surrender. Of those in the other Provinces, some taken, one or two at Sea, and others lying unmanned, and unrigged in their harbours.  
And now, where are your Resources? O my dear Sir! How sadly have you been abused by a faction void of truth, &amp; void of tenderness to you &amp; your Country? They have amused you with Hopes of a Declaration of War on the Part of France. Believe me, from the best Authority, ’twas a fiction from the first. Early in the Year 1776, a french Gentleman was introduced to me, with whom I became intimately acquainted. His Business, to all appearance, was to speculate in the mercantile way. But I believe it will be found, that in his own Country, he moved in a higher Sphere. He saw your camp. He became acquainted with all your military preparations. He was introduced to Congress, and engaged with them in a commercial contract. In the course of our Intimacy, he has frequently told me, that he hoped the Americans would never think of Independency. He gave me his Reasons. “Independency, said he, can never be supported, unless France should declare war against England. I well know the State of her Finances. Years to come will not put them in a situation to venture upon a breach with England. At this moment, there are two parties in the court of Versailles, one enlisted under the Duke de Choiseul, the other under Count Maurepas. Choiseul has no chance of succeeding. He is violent for War. Maurepas must get the better. He is for œconomy &amp; Peace.” This was his Information, which I mentioned to several members of Congress. They treated it as a fable, depending entirely on Dr Franklin’s Intelligence. The Truth of the Matter is this. Dr Franklin built upon the Success of Choiseul. Upon his arrival in France, he found him out of place, his councils reprobated, and his party dwindled to an insignificant faction. This you may depend upon, to be the true State of the court of France And  
  
further, by vast numbers of Letters found on board Prizes taken by the King’s Ships, it appears, that all Commerce with the merchants, through whom alone your Supplies have been conveyed, will soon be at an End, the Letters being full of Complaints of no remittances from America, and many Individuals having greatly suffered.  
From your Friends in England, you have nothing to expect. Their Numbers are diminished to a Cypher. The Spirit of the whole Nation is in full Activity against you. A few sounding names among the Nobility, though perpetually rung in your Ears, are without character, without influence. Disappointed Ambition has made them desperate: and they only wish to make the deluded Americans instruments of their Revenge. All Orders &amp; Ranks of Men in G. Britain are now unanimous, and determined to risque their All in the contest. Trade &amp; Manufacture are found to flourish: And new channels are continually opening, that will perhaps more than supply the loss of the old. In a word, your harbours are blocked up, your cities fall one after another, fortress after fortress, battle after battle is lost. A British army, after having passed almost unmolested thro’ a vast Extent of Country, have possessed themselves with ease of the Capital of America. How unequal the Contest now! How fruitless the expense of Blood!  
Under so many discouraging circumstances, can Virtue, can honour, can the love of your country prompt you to persevere? Humanity itself (and sure I am, Humanity is no Stranger to your Breast) calls upon you to desist. Your Army must perish for want of common necessaries; or thousands of innocent families must perish to support them. Whereever they encamp, the country must be impoverished. Where-ever they march, the Troops of Britain will pursue, &amp; must compleat the Devastation, which America herself had begun.  
Perhaps it may be said, that it is “better to die than to be Slaves.” This indeed is a splendid Maxim in theory: And perhaps in some instances may be found experimentally true. But where there is the least Probability of an happy Accommodation, surely wisdom &amp; Humanity call for some Sacrifices to be made, to prevent inevitable Destruction. You well know, that there is but one invincible Bar to such an Accommodation. Could this be removed, other Obstacles might readily be overcome. ’Tis to you, and you alone your bleeding Country looks, &amp; calls aloud for this Sacrifice. Your Arm alone has Strength sufficient to remove this Bar. May Heaven inspire you with the glorious Resolution of exerting this Strength at so interesting a Crisis, and thus immortalizing yourself as Friend &amp; Guardian of your Country!  
Your penetrating Eye needs not more explicit Language to discern my meaning. With that Prudence &amp; delicacy, therefore, of which I know you to be possessed, represent to Congress the indispensible  
  
Necessity of rescinding the hasty &amp; ill-advised declaration of Independency. Recommend (and you have an undoubted Right to recommend) an immediate cessation of hostilities. Let the Controversy be taken up, where that declaration left it, and where Lord Howe certainly expected to find it. Let Men of clear &amp; impartial characters, in or out of Congress, Gentlemen, liberal in their sentiments, heretofore independent in their fortunes (and some such may surely be found in America) be appointed to confer with his Majesty’s Commissioners. Let them, if they please, prepare some well-digested constitutional Plan to lay before them, as the Commencement of a Negociation. When they have gone thus far, I am confident, that the most happy consequences will ensue. Unanimity will immediately take place thro’ the different Provinces. Thousands, who are now ardently wishing &amp; praying for such a measure, will step forth &amp; declare themselves the zealous Advocates of constitutional Liberty; and millions will bless the Hero, that left the Field of War to decide this most important Contest, with the Weapons of Wisdom &amp; Humanity.  
O Sir! let no false Ideas of worldly Honour deter you from engaging in so glorious a Task. Whatever Censures may be thrown out by mean &amp; illiberal minds, your character will rise in the Estimation of the virtuous and noble; it will appear with lustre in the Annals of History, and form a glorious Contrast to that of those, who have sought to obtain Conquests &amp; gratify their own Ambition by the destruction of their Species and the Ruin of their Country.  
Be assured, Sir, that I write not this under the Eye of any British Officer, or Person connected with the British Army or Ministry. The Sentiments I have expressed are the real Sentiments of my own Heart, such as I have long held, &amp; which I should have made known to you by Letter before, had I not fully expected an Opportunity of a private Conference. When you passed through Philadelphia on your Way to Wilmington, I was confined by a severe Fit of the Gravel to my Chamber. I have since continued so much indisposed and Times have been so very distressing, that I had neither Spirit to write a Letter, nor Opportunity to convey it, when written. Nor do I yet know, by what means I shall get these Sheets to your Hand.  
I would fain hope, that I have said nothing, by which your Delicacy can be in the least hurt. If I have, I assure you, it has been without the least Intention, and therefore your Candour will lead you to forgive me. I have spoken freely of Congress &amp; of the Army. But what I have said is partly from my own Knowledge, &amp; partly from the Information of some respectable Members of the former, and some of the best Officers of the latter. I would not offend the meanest Person upon Earth. What I say to you, I say in Confidence, and to answer what I cannot but  
  
deem a most valuable Purpose. I love my Country. I love you. But to the Love of Truth, the Love of Peace, &amp; the Love of my God, I hope I should be enabled, if called to the Trial, to sacrifice every other inferior Love.  
If the Arguments made use of in this Letter should have so much Influence, as to engage you in the glorious Work, which I have so warmly recommended, I shall ever deem my Success, as the highest temporal Favour that Providence could grant me. Your Interposition &amp; Advice, I am confident, would meet with a favourable Reception from the Authority under which you act. If it should not, you have one infallible Resource still left. Negociate for America at the Head of your Army.  
After all, it may appear Presumption in an Individual to address himself to you on a Subject of such Magnitude, or to say, what Measures would best secure the Interest &amp; Welfare of an whole Continent. The friendly &amp; favourable Opinion you have always expressed of me emboldened me to undertake it; and, (which has greatly added to the Weight of this Motive) I have been strongly impressed with a Sense of Duty upon the Occasion, which left my Conscience uneasy, and my Heart afflicted, ’till I had fully discharged it. I am no Enthusiast. The Case is new &amp; singular to me. But I could not enjoy a Moment’s Peace, ’till this Letter was written. With the most ardent Prayers for your spiritual as well as temporal Welfare, I am Your obedt &amp; sincere Friend &amp; Servent

One alone I except from the general charge, a man of  
virtue, dragged poitiaatie into their measures, and re-  
strained by some false ideas of honor from retracting,  
after having gone too far. You cannot be at a loss to |  
discover whose name answers to this character. From  
the New England provinces can you find one, that as a  
gentlemen, you could wish to associate with, unlessthe  
soft and mild address of Mr. Hancock can atone for the  
want of every other qualification, necessary for the sta-  
tion he fills’ Bankrupts, attorneys, and men of desper- |  
ate fortune, are his colleagues. Ma&#x27;yland no longer  
sendsa Tilghman, and a protestant Carroll. Carolina  
has lost her Lynch, and the elder Middleton has retired.  
  
Are the dregs of a congress then still to influence a  
mind like yours? These are not the men, whom you  
engaged to serve. These are not the men, whom  
America has_chosen to represent her now. Most of  
them elected by a little low faction, and the few gentle-  
men that are among them, now well known to be upon  
the balance, and looking up to your hand alone to re-  
move the beam. It is you, sir, and you alone, that sup-  
port the present congress. Of this you must be fully  
sensible. Long before they left Philadelphia, their dig-  
nity and consequence was gone. What must they be  
now since their precipitate retreat? I write with free  
dom, but without invective. I know those things to be  
true; andI write to one whose own observation must  
have convinced him that they are so.  
  
After this view of congress, turnto your army. All  
the world knows that its very existence depends upon  
you; that your death, or captivity disperses it in a mo-  
ment, and that there is not a man on that side of the |  
  
uestion in America, capable of succeeding you. As to  
the army itself, what have you to expect from them?  
Have they not frequently abangoned even yourself in  
the hour of extremity? Have you, can you have the  
least confidence in the sect of undisciplined men and  
officers, many of whom have been taken from the low-  
est of the people, without principle, without courage?  
Take away those that surround your person, and how  
very few are there, that you can ask to sit at your table?  
Turn to your little Navy. Of that little, what is left?  
Of the Delaware fleet, part are taken, the rest must  
soon surrender. Of those in the other provinces, some |  
are taken, one or two at sea, and the others lying un-  
manned and unrigged in their harbours.  
  
And now, where are your resources? Oh, my dear sir!  
how sidly have you beenabused by a faction void of truth |  
and void of tenderness to you and your country? ‘They  
have amused you with the hopes of a declaration of war  
on the part.of France. Believe me, from the best autho-  
ritv, it was a fiction from the first. Early in the year  
1776, a French gentleman was introduced to me, with  
whom I became intimately acquainted. His business  
to all appearance, was to speculate in the mercantile  
way. But I believe it will be known, that in his own  
country, he moved ina higher sphere. He saw your  
camp. He became acquainted with all your military  
prep rations. He was introduced to congress, and en- |  
gaged with them in a commercial contract. In the course  
of our intimacy he has frequently told me, that he ho-  
ped the Americans would never think of Independen

he found him out of place, his councils reprobated, and  
his party dwindled to an insignificant faction. This  
you may depend upon to be the true state of the court  
of France. And further, by a vast number of letters,  
  
found on board prizes taken by the King’s ships, it ap-  
P y § p P  
  
pears, that all commerce with the merchants of France,  
through whom alone the supplies have been conveyed,  
will soon be at an end, the letters being full of com-  
plaints of no remittances from America, and many indi-  
viduals having suffered greatly on that account.  
  
From your friends in England, you have nothing to  
expect; their numbers have diminished to a cypher;  
the spirit of the whole nation is in full activity against  
you. &lt;A few sounding names among the nobility,  
though perpetually wrung in your ears, are said to be  
without charactér, without influence. Disappointed  
ambition, I am told, has made them desperate; and that  
they only wish to make the deluded Americans, instru-  
ments of their revenge. All orders and ranks of men  
in Great Britain are now unanimous, and determined to  
risk their allin the contest. ‘lrade and manufactures  
are found to flourish, and new channels are continually  
opening, that will perhaps more than supply the loss of  
the old.  
  
In a word, your harbours are blocked up, your cities  
fall one after another; fortress after fortress, battle after  
battle is lost. A British army, after having passed al-  
most unmolested through a vast extent ofcountry, have  
possessed themselves. with ease of the capital of Ame-  
rica. How unequal the contest was! How fruitless the  
expense of blood.  
  
Under so many discouraging circumstances, can vir-  
tue, can honor, can the love of your country, prompt  
you to persevere? Humanity itself (and sure I am, hu-  
manity is no stranger to your breast) calls upon you to  
desist. Your army must perish for want of common ne-  
cessaries, or thousands of innocent families must perish  
to support them. Wherever they encamp, the coun-  
try must be impoverished. Wherever they march, the  
troops of Britain will pursue, and must complete the  
devastation, which America herself had begun.  
  
Perhaps it may be said, that it is ‘‘better to die, than  
to beaslave.” This indeed is a splendid m:x m in theo-  
ry, and, perhaps, in some instances, may be found expe-  
rimentally true. But where there is the least proba-  
bility of an happy accommodation, surely wisdom and  
iyamanity call for some sacrifices to be made to prevent  
inevitable destruction. You well know there is but one  
invincible bar to such an accommodation. Could this  
be removed, other obstacles might readily be overcome,  
’ lis to you, and youalone, your bleeding country looks,  
and calls aloud for this sacrifice. Your arm alone has  
sufficient strength to remove this bar. May heaven in-  
spire yoti with the glorious resolution of exerting this  
strength at so interesting a crisis, and thus immortalizing  
yourself as the friend and guardian of your country.  
’ Your penetrating eye needs not more explicit lan-  
  
age to discern my meaning. With that prudence and  
delicacy, therefore, of which Iknow you to be possessed,  
represent to congress the indispensable necessity of re-  
scinding the hasty and ill-advised declaration of Inde-  
pendency. Recommend, and you haye an undoubted

Be assured, that I write not this under the eye of any  
British officer, or any person connected with the British  
army or ministry. The sentiments I have expressed  
are the real sentiments of my heart, such as I have long  
held, and which I should have made known to you by  
letter before, had I not fully expected an opportunity  
of a private conference. When you passed through  
Philadelphia, on your way to Wilmington, I was con-  
fined by a severe fit of the gravel to my chamber. I  
have since continued so much indisposed, and times  
have been so very distressing, that I had neither spirits to  
write aletter, nor opportunity to convey it when written.  
Nor doI yet know by what means [ shall get these  
sheets to your hands. I would fain hope that I have  
said nothing by which your delicacy can be in the least  
hurt. If 1 have, it has, I assure you, been without the  
least intention, and therefore your candor will lead you  
to forgive me. But what I have said is partly from my  
own knowledge, and partly from the information of  
some respectable members of the former, and some of  
the best officers of the latter. I would not offend the  
meanest person upon earth. What I say to you, I say  
in confidence, to answer what I-cannot but deem a  
a most valuable purpose’ I love. my country, I love  
you. But to the love of truth, the love of peace, and  
the love of my God, I hope I shall be enabled, if called  
to the trial, to sacrifice every other inferior love.  
  
If the arguments made use of in this letter, should  
have so much influence, as to engage you to the glori-  
ous work I have so warmly recommended, I shall ever  
deem my success as the highest temporal favor, that  
providence could grantme. Your interposition and ad-

PxHmaDELPHIA, OcTroBER 8, 1777.  
Sr,  
  
Tf this letter should find you in Council or in  
the field, before you read another sentence, I  
beg you to take the first opportunity of retiring  
and weighing well its important contents.  
  
You are perfectly acquainted with the part I  
have taken in this present unhappy contest. I  
was, indeed, among the first to bear my public  
testimony against having any recourse to threats,  
or even indulging a thought of an armed oppo-  
sition. The torrent soon became too strong for my  
feeble efforts to resist. I wished to follow my  
countrymen as far only as virtue and the right-  
eousness of their cause would permit me. I was,  
however, prevailed upon, among the rest of my  
clerical brethren, to gratify the pressing desires  
of my fellow citizens, by preaching a Sermon to  
one of the City Battalions. I was pressed to  
publish this Sermon, and reluctantly consented.  
  
From a personal attachment of near twenty |  
  
years’ standing, and an high respect for your  
character, in private as well as in public life,  
I took the liberty of dedicating it to you.  
I had your affectionate thanks for my perform-  
ance, in a letter wherein you expressed, in the  
  
most delicate and obliging terms, your regard |  
  
for me and your wishes for a continuance of my  
friendship and approbation of your conduct.  
  
Farther than this, I intended not to proceed.  
My Sermon speaks for itself, and utterly dis-  
claims the ideaof independency. My senti-  
timents were well known to my friends. I  
communicated them, without reserve, to many  
respectable Members of Congress, who express-  
ed a warm approbation of them. I persisted in  
using the public prayers for my Sovereign, and  
the Royal Family, to the very last moment,  
though threatened with insult from the violence  
of a party.  
  
Upon the declaration of independency, I  
called my Vestry, and solemnly put the ques-  
tion to them, whether they thought it best,  
for the peace and welfare of the Congregations,  
to shut up the Churches or to continue the ser-  
vice, without using the petitions for the Royal  
Family. This was the sad alternative. I con-  
eluded to abide by their decisions, as I could not  
have time to consult my spiritual superiors in  
England. They deemed it most expedient, un-  
der such critical circumstances, to keep open the  
Churches, that the Congregations might not be

en which we had great reason to appre-  
end. :  
  
A very few days after the fatal declaration of  
independency, I received a letter from Mr. Han-  
cock, sent by express to Germantown, where my  
family were, for the summer season, acquainting  
me, that I was appointed Chaplain to the Con-  
gress, and desired to attend at nine o’clock the  
next morning. Surprised and distressed by an  
event I was not prepared to expect; obliged to  
give an immediate answer without the opportu-  
nity of consulting my friends, I rashly accepted  
the appointment. could have but one motive  
for taking this step. I thought the Churches in  
danger, and hoped, by these means, to be instru-  
mental in preventing those evils I had so much  
cause to apprehend. I can, however, with truth,  
declare, that I then looked upon independency  
rather as an expedient, and an hazardous one, in-  
deed, thrown out in ferrorum, in order to procure  
some favourable terms, than as a measure that  
was seriously to be persisted in, at all events. My  
sudden change of conduct will clearly evince  
this to have been my idea of the matter.  
  
Upon the return of the Committee of Con-  
gress appointed to confer with Lord Howe, I  
soon discovered their real intentions. The dif-  
ferent accounts which each member of the  
Committee gave of this conference, the time  
they took to make up the matter for the pub-  
lic view, and the amazing disagreements be-  
| twixt the newspaper account and the relation I  
| myself had from the mouth of one of the Com-  
| mittee, convinced me that there must have been  
| some unfair and ungenerons procedure. Their  
determination to treat on no other ground than  
| that of independency, which put it out of his  
Lordship’s power to mention any terms at all,  
was a sufficient proof to me, that mdependency  
| was the idol which they had long wished to set  
up, and that, rather than sacrifice this, they  
would deluge their country in blood.  
  
From this moment, I determined upon my  
resignation, and, in the beginning of October,  
1776, sent it, in form, to Mr. Hancock, after hay-  
ing officiated only two months and three weeks;  
and, from that time, as far as my safety would  
permit, I have been uniformly opposed to all their  
measures. This circumstantial account of my  
| conduct I think due to the friendship you were  
so obliging as to express for me, and I hope will  
| be sufficient to justify any seeming inconsisten-  
| cies in the part I have acted.  
  
And now, my dear Sir, suffer me, in the lan-  
| guage of truth and real affection, to address  
| myself to you. Allthe world must be convinc-  
x that you engaged in the service of your  
country, from motives perfectly disinterested.  
| You risqued everything that was dear to you. You  
| abandoned all those sweets of domestic life, of  
which your affluent fortune gave you the unin-

have had, the least idea of matters being car-

are? Your most intimate friends, at that time,  
shuddered at the thought of a separation from

alone remains, and he disgusted with his un-

As to those of my own Province, some of them

| ** parties at the Court of Versailles, one enlisted  
  
whom you engaged to serve. These are not the  
men, America has chosen to represent her now.  
Most of them elected by little low faction, and  
the few gentlemen that are among them now,  
well known to be upon the balance, and looking  
  
up to your hand alone to move the beam. It is |  
  
you, Sir, and you alone, that supports the pre-  
sent Congress. Of this, you must be fully sensi-  
ble. Long before they left Philadelphia, their  
  
dignity and consequence was gone. What must

with freedom, but without invective. I know  
these things to be true: and I write to one whose  
observation must have convinced: him that they  
are so.  
  
After this view of Congress, turn to your army.  
All the world knows that its very existence de-  
pends upon you; that your derth or captivity  
disperses it in a moment; and that there is not  
a man on that side of the question, in America,  
capable of succeeding you. As to the army,  
itself, what have youto expect from them ? Have  
  
| they not frequently abandoned even yourself, in  
  
the hour of extremity ? Have you, can you have,  
the least confidence in a set of undisciplined men  
and officers, many of whom have been taken  
from the lowest of the people, without principle,  
without courage ? Take away those that surround  
your person, and how very few are there that.  
you can ask to sit at your table.  
  
Turn to your little navy. Of that little, what.  
is left? Of the Delaware fleet, part are taken,  
the rest must soon surrender. Of those in the  
  
| other Provinces, some are taken, one or two at

sea, and the others lying, unmanned and unrig-  
ged, in their harbours.  
  
And now, where are your resources? O!my  
dear Sir, how sadly have you been abused by a.  
faction void of truth, and void of tenderness to.  
you and your country ? They have amused you  
with hopes of a Declaration of War on the part.  
of France. Believe me, from the best authori-  
ty, it was a fiction from the first. Early in the  
year 1776, a French gentleman was introduced  
to me,with whom I became intimately acquaint-  
ed. His business, to all appearance, was to  
speculate, in the mercantile way. But, I believe,  
it will be found that, in his own country, he  
moved in a higher sphere. He saw your camp.  
He became acquainted with all your military  
preparations. He was eieatneel to Congres.  
and engaged with them in a mercantile contracts  
In the course of our intimacy, he has frequently  
told me that he hoped the Americans would  
never think of independency. He gave me his.  
reasons. ‘‘Independency,” said he, ‘‘can never  
‘*be supported unless France should declare  
‘*War against England. I well know the state  
Years to come, will not put,  
‘them in a situation to venture upon a breach  
‘‘with England. At this moment, there are two  
  
‘under the Duc de Choiseul and the other under  
**the Count Maurepas. Choiseul has no chance  
“‘ofsucceeding. Heis violent for war. Maure-  
‘*pas must get the better. He is for econom  
  
‘‘and peace.” This was his information, whic  
  
I mentioned to several Members of Congress.  
They treated it as a fable, depending entirely on  
the intelligence from Dr. Franklin. The truth  
  
  
  
  
  
1870.]  
  
of the matter is this, Dr. Franklin built upon the  
success of Choiseul. Upon his arrival in France,  
he found him out of place, his counsels repro-  
bated, and his party dwindled to an insignificant  
faction: This you may depend upon to be the  
true state of the Court of France. And farther,  
by vast number of letters, found on board prizes  
  
taken by the King’s ships, it appears that all |  
  
commerce with the merchants of France, through  
whom, alone, the supplies have been conveyed,  
will soon be at an end, the letters being full of  
complaints of no remittances from America, and  
many individuals having greatly suffered on that  
account.  
  
From your friends in England, you have noth- |  
  
ing to expect, their numbers are diminished to  
  
a cypher; the spirit of the whole nation is in full |  
activity against you. A few sounding names, |  
  
among the nobility, though perpetually rung in  
your ears, are said to be without character, with-  
out influence. Disappointed ambition,I am told,  
has made them desperate; and that they only  
wish to make the deluded Americans instru-  
ments of their revenge.  
  
of men, in Great Britain, are now unanimous  
and determined to risque their all on the contest.  
Trade and manufactures are found to flourish;  
and new channels are continually opening, that  
will, perhaps, more than supply the loss of the  
  
old.  
  
In a word, your harbours are blocked up;  
your cities fall, one after another; fortress after  
fortress, battle after battle, is lost. A British  
army, after having passed, almost unmolested,  
through a vast extent of country, have possessed  
themselves, with ease, of the capital of America,  
How unequal the contest, now! How fruitless  
the expense of blood.  
  
Under so many discouraging circumstances,  
ean virtue, can honour, can the Jove of your  
country, prompt you to persevere? Humanity  
itself, (and sure I am, humanity is no stranger  
to your breast) calls upon you to desist.  
army must perish for want of common necessa-  
ries, or thousands of innocent families must per-  
ish to support them. Wherever they encamp,  
the country must be impoverished. Wherever  
  
they march, the troops of Britain will pursue, |  
  
and must complete the devastation which Ame-  
rica herself had begun.  
  
Perhaps it may be said, that it is ‘‘ better to |  
  
“die than to be slaves.” This, indeed, is a  
splendid maxim, in theory, and, perhaps, in  
  
some instances, may be found experimentally |  
  
true. But where there is the least probability  
of an happy accommodation, surely wisdom  
and humanity call for some sacrifices to be made,  
to prevent inevitable destruction. You well  
know, there is but one invincible bar to such  
an accommodation. Could this be removed,  
other obstacles might readily be overcome.

|  
Tis to you, and you alone,your bleeding coun-  
| try looks and calls aloud for this sacrifice. Your  
arm alone has sufficient strength to remove this  
bar. May Heaven inspire you with the glorious  
| resolution of exerting this strength, at so inter-  
esting a crisis, and thus immortalizing yourself,  
as a friend and guardian of your country.  
  
Your penetrating eye needs not more explic-  
it language to discern my meaning. With  
that prudence and delicacy, therefore, of which  
| I know you are possessed, represent to Congress  
|the indispensable necessity of rescinding the  
| hasty and ill-advised Declaration of Independ-  
}eney. Recommend, and you have an undoubt-  
ed right to recommend, an immediate cessation  
| of hostilities. Let the controversy be taken up  
where that Declaration left it, and where Lord  
Howe expected to have found it. Let men of  
| clear and impartial characters, in or out of Con-  
gress, Gentlemen, liberal in their sentiments, here-  
tofore independent in their fortunes, and some  
;such are surely to be found in America, be  
appointed to confer with his Majesty’s Com-  
missioners. Let them, if they please, prepare  
some well-digested constitutional plan to lay be-  
| fore them, asthe commencement of anegotiation.  
When they have gone thus far, I am confident  
|that the most happy consequences will ensue.  
| Unanimity will immediately take place through  
the different Provinces. Thousands that are  
now ardently wishing and praying for such a  
measure, will step forth and declare themselves  
the zealous advocates of constitutional liberty,  
and millions will bless the hero that left the  
field of war, to decide this most important con-  
test with the weapons of wisdom and humanity.  
  
O! Sir, let no false ideas of worldly honour  
deter you from engaging in so glorious a task.  
Whatever censures may be thrown out by mean  
and illiberal minds, your character will rise in  
the estimation of the virtuous and noble. It  
will appear with lustre in the annals of his-  
tory, and form a glorious contrast to that of  
those who have sought to obtain conquest and  
| gratify their own ambition by the destruction of  
their species and the ruin of their country.  
  
Be assured, that I write not this under the eye  
of any British officer or any person connected  
with the British army or ministry. The senti-  
ments I have expressed are the real sentiments  
of my heart, such as I have long held, and  
| which I should have made known to you, before,  
had I not fully expected an opportunity of a  
private conference. When you passed through  
Philadelphia, on your way to Wilmington, I  
was confined by a severe fit of the gravel to my  
|chamber. I have since continued so much in-  
disposed, and times have been so very distress-  
ing, that I had neither spirits to write a letter,  
nor opportunity to convey it when written.  
Nor do I yet know by what means I shall get  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
6  
  
those sheets to your hands.  
  
I would fain hope, that I have said nothing,  
by which your delicacy can be in the least hurt.  
  
I have, it has, I assure you, been without the  
least intention, and therefore your candour will  
lead you to forgive me. I have spoken freely of  
Congress, and of the army. But. what I have said  
is partly from my own knowledge, and partly  
from the information of some respectable mem-  
bers of the former, and some of the best officers  
of the latter. I would not offend the meanest  
person upon earth. What I say to you I say in  
confidence, to answer what I cannot but deem a  
most valuable purpose. I love my country. I love  
you. Buttothe love of truth, the love of peace,  
and the love of God, I hope I shall be enabled,  
if called to the trial, to sacrifice every other in-  
ferior love. If the arguments made use of in  
this letter should have so much influence, as to  
engage you in the glorious work which I have so  
warmly recommended, I shall ever deem my  
success as the highest temporal favor that Prov-  
idence could grant me— Your interposition and  
advice, I am confident, will meet with a favoura-  
ble reception from the authority under which  
  
ou act. If it should not, you have one infalli-  
le resource still left,— negotiate for America  
at the head of your army.  
  
After all, it may appear presumption in an in-  
dividual to address himself to you on a subject  
of so much magnitude, or to say what mea-  
sures should best secure the interest and welfare  
of a whole Continent. The favourable and friend-  
ly opinion you have always expressed of me,  
embolden me to undertake it; and, (which has  
greatly added to the weight of this motive)  
I have been strongly impressed with a sense  
of duty, upon this occasion, which left my con-  
science uneasy, and my heart afflicted, till I had  
fully discharged it. am no enthusiast. The  
case is new and singular to me. I could not en-  
joy a moment’s peace, till the letter was written.  
  
With the most ardent prayers for your spirit-  
ual as well as temporal welfare, I am, Sir,  
  
Your most sincere friend and obedient Servant

1777, when he suddenly changed, by some  
strange conversion, from an ardent Whig
