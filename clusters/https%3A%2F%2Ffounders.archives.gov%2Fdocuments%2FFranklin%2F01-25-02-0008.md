I have never entered into any Controversy in defence of my philosophical Opinions; I leave them to take their Chance in the World. If they are right, Truth and Experience will support them.

Sir,—I am much obliged by your communication of the letter from England.  
Iam of your opinion that a translation of it will not be proper for publication  
here. Our friend’s expressions concerning Mr. Wilson will be thought too  
angry to be made use of by one philosopher when speaking of another, and on  
a philosophical question. He seems as much heated about this one point, as  
the Jansenists and Molinists were about five. As to my writing any thing on  
the subject, which you seem to desire, I think it not necessary, especially as I  
have nothing to add to what I have already said upon it in a paper read to the  
committee who ordered the conductors at Purfleet, which paper is printed in  
the last French edition of my writings. I have never entered into any contro-  
versy in defence of my philosophical opinions ; I leave them to take their chance  
in the world. If they are right, truth and experience will support them. If  
wrong, they ought to be refuted and rejected. Disputes are apt to sour one’s  
temper, and disturb one’s quiet. I have no private interest in the reception of  
my invention by the world, having never made, nor proposed to make, the least  
profit by any of them. The King’s changing his pointed conductors for blunt  
ones is therefore a matter of small importance to me. If I had a wish about  
it, it would be that he had rejected them altogether as ineffectual. For it is
