losophic Society.— I have forwarded to you in this Ship what is already publish’d.  
I thank you for your ingenious Paper in favour of the Trees. I own I wish we had two Rows of them in every one of our Streets. The comfortable Shelter they would afford us, when walking, from our burning Summer Suns, and the greater Coolness of our Walls &amp; Pavements, would I conceive in the improv’d Health of the Inhabitants, amply compensate the Loss of a House now and then, by Fire, if such should be the Consequence: But a Tree is soon fell’d; and as Axes are at hand in every Neighbourhood, may be down before the Engines arrive.—  
You do well to avoid being concern’d in the Pieces of Personal Abuse, so scandalously common in our Newspapers that I am afraid to lend any of them here, till I have examined &amp; laid aside such as would disgrace us; and subject us among Strangers to a Reflection like that us’d by a Gentleman in a Coffee-house, to two Quarrellers, who after a mutually free Use of the Words Rogue, Villain, Rascal, Scoundrel, &amp;c seemed as if they would refer their Dispute to him:—I know nothing of you or your Affair, says he; I only perceive that you know one another.  
The Conductor of a Newspaper, should, methinks, consider himself as in some degree the Guardian of his Country’s Reputation, and refuse to insert such Writings as may hurt it. If People will print their Abuses of one another, let them do it in little Pamphlets, and distribute them where they think proper. It is absurd to trouble all the World with them; and unjust to Subscribers in distant Places, to stuff their Papers with Matters so unprofitable &amp; so disagreable.  
With sincere Esteem

trymen. In a letter to a friend ho said: “ The  
conductor of a newspaper should, methinks,  
consider himself as in some degree the guardian  
of his country’s reputation and refuse to insert  
such writings as may hurt it. If people will  
print their abuses of one another, let them do  
it in little pamphlets and discharge them where  
they think proper. It is absurd to trouble all  
the world with them, and unjust to subscribers  
in distant places to stuff their paper with mat­  
ters so .unprofitable and disagreeable.” Ar

**] thank you for your ingenious paper in favor of the trees. I own I wish we  
had two rows of them in every one of our streets. The comfortable shelter they  
would afford us in walking, from our burning summer suns. and the greater cool  
ness of our walls and pavements, would, I conceive, in the improved health of  
the inhabitants, amply compensate the loss of a house now and then by fire, if  
such should be the consequence; but a tree is soon felled, and as axes are at hand  
in every neighborhood, may be down before the engines arrive.” —Dr. Benjamin  
Franklin to John Hopkinson.

I have examined and  
laid aside such as  
would disgrace us, and subject us among strangers  
to a reflection like that used by a gentleman in  
4 coffee-house to two quarrellers, who, after a  
mutually free use of the words, rogue, villain,  
rascal, scoundrel, etc., seemed as if they would  
refer their dispute to him: “I know nothing of  
you, or your affairs,” said he; “I only perceive  
that you know one another.”  
  
The conductor of a newspaper should, methinks,  
consider himself as in some degree the guardian  
of his country’s reputation, and refuse to insert  
such writing as may hurt it. If people will print  
their abuses of one another, let them do it in little  
pamphlets, and distribute them where they think  
proper. It is absurd to trouble all the world with  
them; and unjust to subscribers in distant places,  
to stuff their paper with matters so unprofitable,  
and so disagreeable.
