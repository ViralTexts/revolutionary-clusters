Mr. Madison now rose and addressed the Committee in a speech of which the following is the outline &amp;  
substance.  
Altho the actual posture of the subject before the Committee might admite a full survey of it, it is not my  
purpose in rising to enter into the wide field of discussion, which has called forth a display of intellectual resources  
and varied powers of eloquence that any country might be proud of; and which I have witnessed with the highest  
gratification. Having been for a very long period withdrawn from any participation in proceedings of deliberative bodies,  
and under other disqualifications now, of which I am deeply sensible, though, perhaps less sensible than others may  
perceive that I ought to be, I shall not attempt more than a few observations which may suggest the views I have taken of  
the subject and which will consume but little of the time of the Committee, now become precious.  
It is sufficiently obvious, that Persons and Property, are the two great subjects on which Governments are to act: and  
that the rights of persons, and the rights of property are the objects for the protection of which Government was  
instituted. These rights cannot well be separated. The personal right to acquire property, which is a natural right, gives  
to property when acquired a right to protection as a social right. The essence of Government is power; and power lodged as  
it must be, in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.  
In Monarchies the interests and happiness of all may be sacrificed to the caprice and passion of a despot: In  
Aristocracies, the rights and welfare of the many may be sacrificed to the pride and cupidity of a few: In  
Republics, the great danger is that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the Minority. Some gentlemen,  
consulting the purity and generosity of their own minds, without adverting to the lessons of experience would find a  
security against that danger in our social feelings: in a respect for character: in the dictates of the monitor within: in  
the interests of individuals in the aggregate interests of the Community.  
But Man is known to be a selfish as well as a social being. Respect for character though often a salutary  
[a] restraint is but too often overruled by other motives. When numbers of men act in a body, respect for character is often  
lost, just in proportion as it is necessary to control what is not right. We all know that conscience is not a sufficient  
safeguard, besides that conscience itself may be deluded; many being misled by an unconscious bias into acts which an  
enlightened conscience would forbid. As to the permanent interest of individuals, in the aggregate interests of the  
community, &amp; in the proverbial maxim that honesty is the best policy; present temptation is too often found to be  
an over match for those considerations. Those favorable attributes of the human character are all valuable as auxiliaries,  
but they will not, serve as a substitute, for the coercive provisions belonging to government and law. They will always, in  
proportion as they prevail, be favorable to a mild administration of both; but they can never be relied on as a guaranty  
of the rights of the minority against a Majority disposed to take unjust advantage of its power. The only effectual  
safeguard to the rights of the minority must be laid in such a basis &amp; structure of the Government itself: as may  
afford, in a certain degree, directly or indirectly, a defensive authority in behalf of a minority having right on its  
side.  
To come more nearly to the subject before the Committee, viz that peculiar feature in our Community which  
calls for a peculiar provision, in the basis of our Government, I mean the coloured part of our population; It is  
apprehended, if the power of the Commonwealth shall be in the hands of a Majority who have no interest in this species of  
property, that, from the facility with which it may be oppressed by excessive taxation, injustice may be done to its  
owners. It would seem, therefore, if we can incorporate that interest into the basis of our system, it will be the most  
apposite and effectual security that can be devised. Such an arrangement is recommended to me by many very important  
considerations. It is due to justice: due to humanity: due to truth; to the sympathies of our nature: in fine, to our  
character as a people, both abroad and at home, that they should be considerd, as much as possible, in the light of human  
beings; &amp; not as mere property. As such they are acted upon by our laws; and have an interest in our laws. They  
may be considered as making a part, tho a degraded part of the families to which they belong. If they had the complexion  
of the Serfs in the North of Europe, or of the villeins formerly in England in other terms, if they were of our own  
complexion, much of the difficulty would be removed. But the mere circumstance of complexion can not deprive them of the  
character of men. The Federal number, as it is called, is particularly recommended to attention in forming a basis of  
representation, by its simplicity, its certainty, its stability, and its permanency. Other expedients for securing justice  
in the case of taxation, while they amount in pecuniary effect to the same thing, have been found liable to great  
objections, and I do not believe that a majority of this Convention is disposed to adopt them, if they can find a  
substitute they can approve. Nor is it a small recommendation of the federal number in my view, that it is in conformity  
to the ratio recognized in the Federal Constitution. The cases it is true are not precisely the same; but there is more of  
analogy than might at first be supposed. If the coloured population were equally diffused thro’ the State, the analogy  
would fail; but existing as it does in large masses in particular part of it; the distinction between the different parts  
of the State, resembles that between the slaveholding and non-Slave holding States. And if we reject a doctrine in our own  
State whilst we claim the benefit of it in our relations to other States, other disagreeable consequences may be added to  
the charge of inconsistency which will be brought against us. If the example of our Sister States is to have weight we  
find that in Georgia the Federal number is made the basis of representation in both branches of their Legislature: and I  
do not learn that any dissatisfaction or inconvenience has flowed from its adoption. I wish we could know more of the  
manner in which particular organizations of Govt. operate in other parts of the United States. There would be less danger  
of being misled into error, and we should have the advantage of their experience as well as our own. In the case I  
mention there can I believe be no error  
Whether, therefore, we be fixing a basis of representation for the one branch or the other of our Legislature,  
or for both, in a combination with other principles the Federal Ratio is a favorite resource with me. It entered into my  
earliest views of the subject, before this Convention was assembled: and though I have Kept my mind open, have listened to  
every proposition which has been advanced, and given to them all a candid consideration, I must say that in my judgment we  
shall act wisely in preferring it to others which have been brought before us.  
Should the federal number be made to enter into the basis in one branch of the Legislature and not into the  
other, such an arrangement might prove favourable to the Slaves themselves. It may be &amp; I think it has been  
suggested, that those who have, themselves, no interest in this species of property, are apt to sympathize with the Slaves  
more than may be the case with their masters &amp; would therefore be disposed where they had the ascendancy to  
protect them from laws of an oppressive character. Whilst the Masters, who have a common interest with the slaves against  
an undue taxation, which must be paid out of their labour, will be their protectors where they have the ascendancy.  
The Convention is now arrived at a point where we must agree on some common ground, all sides relaxing in  
their opinions; not changing—but mutually surrendering a part of them.In framing a Constitution great difficulties are  
necessarily to be overcome: and nothing can ever overcome them but a spirit of compromise. Other Nations are surprised at  
nothing so much as our having been able to form Constitutions in the manner which has been exemplified in this Country.  
Even the Union of so many States is in the eyes of the world a wonder: the harmonious establishment of a common  
Government over them all, a miracle. I cannot but flatter myself, that, without a miracle, we shall be able to arrange all  
our difficulties. I never have despaired. Notwithstanding all the threatening appearances we have passed through. I have now  
more than a hope, a consoling confidence that we shall at last find that our labours have not been in vain

in a speech, of which, tho following is the outline  
1 and substance:  
Although the actual posture of the subject before

any participation in proceedings of deliberative bod  
les. and u.idor other disqualifications now, of which  
I am deeply sensible,thought perhaps Jess sensible  
than others, nmy perceive that I ought to be. 1 shall  
not attempt more than a few observations, whch may  
auggest the views I have taken of the subject, nud  
which will consume but little of the time of the Com­  
mittee, now bocutnc precious- It is sufficiently u&#x27;uvi­  
j O’.is, tlint Pursuits and Property are the two great  
subjects on which governments urc to act; that the  
rights of persons and the rights of property, uro the  
objects for the protection of which government was  
instituted. Vlicso rights cannot well be separated_  
Th&lt;} personal right to acquire property, which is c  
: n-.tural right, gives to property, when acquired;  
a right to protection, as a social right. The  
essence of government is power; and power, lodged;  
us it must be. inhuman hunds, will ever bo liable to  
above. In monarchies, the interests and happiness  
, of all may be sacrificed to the caprice and passions o.  
a dr-pot: Iu aristocracies, the rights and welfare ot

: verting to the lessons of experience, would find a se­  
curity against that danger, in onr social feelings; in  
, u respect for diameter; in tho dictates of the monitor  
; within; in t ho interest of individuals in the aggregate  
1 interests of the community. Hut man is know&quot; tc  
! be a sctilsb, ns well ana social being. Respect foi  
character, though often a salutary restraint, isbut toe  
often overruled by other motives. When number;  
of men net in n body, respect for character is often  
lost, jpst in proportion as it is necessary to control  
! what is not ri^ht. Wo nil know that conscience is nq|  
a sufficient safeguard, nnd besides that conscience it.  
1 self may br deluded; may be mi.-lcd by an unconscious  
bios. into acts which nn enlightened conscience  
! would forbid. As to the permanent interest of indi­  
viduals in the aggregate interests of the community,  
and in the proverbial imxipi that honesty i6 thelc-t  
! policy, present temptation is too ofteu found to be or  
] over mutch for those cousi lerations. Theso favour­  
able attribute* of the human character arc all  
j valuable, as auxiliaries; but thoy will not servo us a  
. substitute for the coercive provisions belonging rc  
covernment and law. They will always, in propor  
tion ns they prevail, be favourable to n mild atleums­  
l rut ion ot both: but they nover can be relief!  
on as a guaranty of the rights of the minority ogainat  
u m*joritv disposed to toko unjust ndvuntngij of it#

the minority must bo laid in such a basis and struc­  
ture ofthc government itrulf os may afford, ina cer­  
tain degree, directly, or indirectly, a defensive author­  
ity in behalf of a minority having right on its side­  
To come more nearly to the subject before the Com  
mittce, viz: that peculiar feature iii our community  
wliicti calls for n peculiar division iu tti-* basis of ouj  
government, I mean tliu coloured part ofour pepuls  
: lion: It ip apprehended, if tho power ofthc Common  
wealth shall lie in the linuds of a majority who h»v&lt;  
no interest in this spocies of property, that, from the fa  
cility with which it may be oppressed by sxcesMvt  
taxation, injustice may bo done to its owner*. It  
would icoin, therefore, if wc con incorporate that in  
turret into tho bssisofour aysteui, it w fi he the mo?  
apposite hu I off dual security ’ha&#x27; can bo devised.—  
8 ii h an arran ; mrnt is rrcominen-’cd to me by mnrn  
very important considerations. It is due to justice: du&lt;  
to humanity: due to truth: to the sympathies of oui  
nature: in hue, to our character as n peoplo.bothabroai  
and at home; that they should he considered, as mucl  
as po&gt;siblo, in the light of human beings, and not ai  
incro property. As such, they arc acted upon b;  
our laws, oml have an interest iu our laws. The;  
Uiny be considered ns unking a part, though a de  
graded part, of the families to which they belong.  
! If *hoy l.aJ tho cotnp’cxion cf tho F?rfs ja t|,  
  
*jorth of Europe, or of the villeins formerly in En­  
gland, in other terms, if they wore of our own com­  
plexion, much of the difficulty would lie removed. But  
tj.e mere cireumsterco of complexion cannot deprive  
them of the character of men. The federal number,  
a* it is called, particularly recommended to* attrn­  
ti r in forming :» taxis of representation, by its aim  
pli&lt;*ity,it3 Certainty, its stability, and itx permanency.  
Other expedients tor securing justice in theca-.? of  
ta. it ion, while they amount in pecuniary elFeof, to  
the Mine thing, havo been found liable to r*reat oh:oc­  
tions: ond 1 do not believe Ihr.t a maturity of this  
Convention L» disposed to adopt them, il they can find  
a substitute they can approve. Nor is it u entail re­  
commendation of the I Vdorul numb* : in my view,  
tint it i* in conformity to the ratio rocogoj .od jn ti.r  
1 -&#x27;Icral Constitution. The cases, it is iriu-. are not  
precisely the same, but there i* more of analogy  
than might at fir*t ho supp *?ed. It&#x27; the Coloured ik&gt;­  
pulstion were equally diffused through theornto, the  
aiialygy would fail; but existing, as it in large :  
manses, in particular parts of it, tjio distinction be­  
tween the different parts of the State, resembles  
that between ;he slave-holding and non-vlnvci\ulding !  
, State*: and, if wo reject a doctrine iu our own State,!  
! wlulst tve claim the benefit of it in our relations to j  
j other State*, other disagreeable consequences may be  
I added to the charge ot inconsistency, winch will be j  
brought against us. If the example of our bi- ’or ■  
States is to have weight, we find t:.?t in tim.rgis the ;  
Fvderal number is tnadc the ha.-is of representation  
in bo&#x27;h branches of their Legislature: and I do not &#x27;  
learn that any dissatisfaction or incur.cnience bus&#x27;  
flowed from its adoption. I wish we could know  
more of the manner in which particular organization?  
of government operate in otlnr parts of the United |  
State*. There would be lot : danger of being misled  
into error, and we should have the advantage of!  
their experience as well as our own. In the ca-.e 1  
tncntiuu, there can, I believe, be ro error.  
Whether, therefore, we be fixing a basis of repre­  
sentation, for the one branch, or the other of our  
; gislature, or for both, in a cor.bination with other  
principles, the federal ratio i a favorite i . &gt;.  
with me. It entered info my earliest views of th&lt;  
subject, before this Convention was asrembled; and  
though I have kept rny mind open, have listened to  
every proposition which has been advanced, imdgi­  
ven to them all a candid consideration, I must say.  
that iu rny judgment, weshall act wisely in preferring  
it to others, which have boon brought before us._!  
Should the federal number be ma&lt;k: to enter into the  
basis in one branch of the Legi-Iature, and not into  
the other, such nn arrangement might prove favora­  
ble to thq slaves themselves. It may be,and I think !  
it lias been, suggested, that those who havo them­  
selres no interest in this specie* of property, n:e not  
j to sympathise with the slaves, more than may be  
j the case with their masters; and would, therefore,  
! bo disposed, when they had the ascomlancv, to pro*  
j tect them from lawaof in oppressive character, wmist  
I the masters, who havo a common interc-t. with th&gt;  
i slaves, against undue taxation, which mu-tb? p . d  
; out of their labqur. will Le their protector*  
j have the ascendancv.  
  
i 1 uc Convention is now arrived at a r. r.» &lt; c  
i wo must agree on some common ground, ail •-: ! j  
j relaxing in their opinions;—not changing,—h « i -,. i. •.  
ally surrendering a part of tiicin. In training a Con­  
stitution, great difficulties are necessarily to lin over­  
come: and nothing can ever overcome* them but a  
spirit of compromise. Other nations are surp is d  
at nothing so much as our having been ub!e to form  
Constitutions iu the manner which has been exem­  
plified in this country: Even the uiu.m of to mam  
States, is, in the eyes of the world, a word :r; the har­  
■ &gt; oiomous t,otablisluiii-nt of a common govemou-nt over

Mr II vdison rose, and addressed the Committee  
in a speech, of which, the following is the outline  
and substance:  
Although the actual posture of the subject before  
the Committee might ndmit a full survey of it, it is  
not inv purpose, in rising, to enter into the wide  
field of discussion which has called forth a display of  
intellectual resources and varied powers of eloquence  
’ that any country might he pioud of; and wluch I  
have witnessed with the highest gratification. Hav­  
ing been, for n very long ,period, withdrawn from  
any participation in proceedings of deliberative bod­  
ies, and under o;her disqualifications now&#x27;, of w hich  
1 am deeply sensible,thought perhaps less sensible  
than others, may perceive tlwt i oegiu to he, l ahull  
not attempt more than a few observations, ivhch gray  
suggest the views I have taken of the subject, and  
which will consume but little of the time of the Com­  
mittee, now become precious. It is sufficiently obvi­  
ous, that Fcrscrs find Property are the two great  
subjects on which governments are to act; that the  
right3 of persons and the rights of property, are the  
objects for the protection of which govemmeut was  
instituted. These rights cannot well he separated.—  
The personal right to acquire property, which is a  
natural right, gives to property, when acquired;  
a right to protection, as a social right. The  
essence of government is power; and power, lodged,  
as it must he, inhuman hands, will ever be liable to  
abuse. In monarchies, the interests and happiness  
of all may be sacrificed to the caprice and passions of  
a despot: In aristocracies, the rights and welfare of  
the many may be sacrificed to the pride and cupid­  
ity of a few: In republics, the great danger is, that  
the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights  
of the minority. Some gentlemen, consulting the pu  
rity and generosity of their own minds, without ad­  
verting to the lessons of experience, would find a se­  
curity against that danger, in our social feelings; in  
a respect for character; in the dictates of the monitor  
within; in the interest of individuals in the aggregate  
interests of the community. Butman is known to  
be a scfflsh, ns well as a sociai being. Respe ct for  
character, though often a salutary restraint, isbut too  
often overruled by other motives- VVheu numbers  
of men act in a body, respect for character is often  
lost, just in proportion as it is necessary to control  
what is not right. -We all know that conscience is not  
a suflicicnt safeguard, and besides that conscience it­  
self may be deluded; may be misled by an unconscious  
bias, into actB which an enlightened conscience  
would forbid. As to the permanent interest of indi­  
  
victuals in the aggregate interests ot the community,  
and iii the proverbial maxim that honesty is the best  
policy, present temptation is too often found to be an  
over match Ibrthosc Considerations. These favour­  
able attribute* of the human character arc all  
valuable, as auxiliaries; but they will not serve as a  
substitute for the coercive provisions belonging to  
government and law. They will always, in propor  
tionasthey prevail,be favourable to a mild adminis­  
tration of both: but they never can be relied  
on as a guaranty of the rights of the minority against  
a majority disposed to take unjust advantage of its  
power. The only effectual safeguard to the rights of  
the minority must be laid in such n basin and struc­  
ture oftbc government itself as may afford, inn cer­  
tain degree, directly, or indirectly, a defensive author­  
ity in behalf of a minority having right on its side.  
To come more nearly to the subject before the Com­  
mittee, viz: that peculiar feature in our community,  
which calls for a peculiar division in the basis of our  
government, I mean the coloured part ofour popula­  
tion: It is apprehended, if the power of the Common­  
wealth shall be in the hands of a majority who hove  
no interest m this species of property, that, from the fa­  
cility w ith which it may be oppressed by excessive  
taxation, injustice may be done to its owners. It  
would seem, therefore, if wc c.an incorporate that in­  
terest into the basis ofour system, it will be the most  
apposite and effectual .security that can be dev ised—  
J&amp;ichan arrangement is recommended to me by many  
very important considerations. It is due to justice: dj;  
to humanity: due to truth: to the sympathies of our  
nature: in fine, to our character as a people, bothabroad  
and at home; that they should be considered, as much  
as possible, in the light of human beings, and not ns  
mero property. As such, they ore acted upon by  
our laws, ana have an interest in our laws. They  
may be considered as making a part, though a de­  
graded part, of the families to which they belong.  
If they had the complexion of the Serfs in the  
North of Europe, or of the villeins formerly in En­  
gland, in other terms, if they were of our own com­  
plexion, much of the difficulty would be removed. But  
the mere circumstance of complexion cannot deprive  
them of the character of men. The federal number,  
as it is called, is particularly recommended to atten­  
tion ir* fermin^ a bcrls cf rojwcnectation, by it# rim­  
  
pi c.ty, its certainty, its stability, and its permanency.  
Other expedients tor securing justice lu the case of  
taxation, while they amount in pecuniary effect, to  
the sa me thing, have been found liable to great objec­  
tions: and.Ido not believe that a majority of this  
Convention is disposed to adopt them, if they can find  
a substitute they ran approve. Nor is it a smaJl re­  
commendation ol the Federal number in my view,  
that it isin conformity to the ratio recognized in the  
1 e,!?rJV Constitution. The coses, it is true. ar0 not  
precisely the same, but there is more of analogy  
than might at first bo supposed. If the coloured po­  
pulation were equally diffused through theStat&quot; the  
analogy would fail; hut existing, as it does, in large  
mass.-js, in particular parts of it, the distinction ifc­  
tv.uen tee different parts &lt;^f the State, resembles i  
vhfit bet wetsuit he slave holding and non-slavcholdin£ &#x27;  
States: and, if we reject a doctrine in our own State, &#x27;  
etiitet vve claim I he benefit of it in our relations to!  
other S’-&#x27;cs, other disagreeable consequences may be  
i added to the charge of inconsistency, which will he 1  
brought against us. If the example of our sister  
States is to have weight, we find that in Georgia the  
Federal number is made the basis of representation I  
in bo h branches of their Legislature: and I do not  
learn that any^ dissatisfaction or inconvenience hog  
llowed from its adoption. I wish we could know  
more of the manner in which particular organizations  
of government operate in other parts of The United  
btiitea. 1 here would be loss danger of being misled  
into error, and vve should have the advantage of!  
their experience as well as our own. In the case I  
mention, there can, I believe, he no error.  
Whether, therefore, vve be fixing a basis of repre- &#x27;  
sentation, for the one branch, or the other of our Lc- 1  
gislature, or tor both, in a combination with other  
principles, the federal ratio is n favorite resource ®  
with me. It entered into niv earliest views of the I  
subject, before this Convention was assembled; and I  
though I have kept my mind open, have listened to  
every preposition which has beeu advanced, andgi-!  
van to them all a caudid consideration, I must sav,  
that in my judgment, we shall net wisely in prelbrring !  
it to others, which have been brought betorc us._- j  
Should the federal number be made to enter into the I  
basis in one branch of the Legislature* and not into  
the other, such an arrangement might prove favora­  
blc to the slaves themselves. It may be,and I think  
it has been, suggested, that those who have them­  
selves no interest in tills species of property, are apt  
to sympathise with the slaves, more than may be  
the case with their masters; and would, therefore,  
be disposed, when they had the ascendancy, to pro­  
tect them from laws of an oppressive character; whilst  
the musters, who have a common interest with the  
slaveq. against undue taxation, which must be paid  
out of t heir Inbour, will he their protectors when tliey  
have the ascendancy.  
  
1 hr Convention is now arrived at n point where  
we must agree on some common ground, a’l sides  
relaxing in their opinions;—not changing,— but mutu­  
ally surrendering a part of them. In framing a Con­  
stitution, great difficulties are necessarily lobe over­  
come: and nothing can ever overcome* them but a  
spirit of compromise- Other nations are surprised  
at nothing so much as our having been able to form  
Constitutions in the manner which has been exem­  
plified in this country: Kvcn the union of. so many  
States, is, in the eyes of the world, a wonder; the har­  
monious esiablislnnent of n common government over  
them a’l.a miracle. I cannot but flatter myself, that !  
without a miracle, vve shall be able to arrange ali dif­  
| Acuities I never have despaired; notwithstanding  
ail the threatening appearances we have posted  
through. I have now more than a hope—a consoling I  
confidence,—that we shall at last find that our labois !  
have not been in vain

Air. Madison io»e, and addressed the Corn­  
miner in a speech, of which, Ihe following is  
the outline and substance ;  
Although &gt;he actual posture of the subject

vey of it, it is not my purpose in rising, to en­  
ter into the wide Held ol discussion which has  
celled forth a displayed intellectual resource, is.  
varied powers of eloquence, that any country  
might tie proud of—aud which I have witness  
ed with the highest grnulicalion Having!  
been, lor a very long period withdrawn from j  
any partiupalion in proceedings of deliberative ,  
bodies, and under oilier disqualifications now, |  
ol which I am deeply sensible, though perhaps j  
less sensible than others, limy perceive that I  
ought to be, I shall not nltempt mure than a

I have taken of (lie subject, and which w il  
consume hot little uf the time ot Ihe Cuniimt­  
lee, now become precious. Ii is su.&#x27;iicieutly  
obvious that Persons and Property are lilt. t«’o  
great subjects on which govern meals are lo ,  
act—and lhat t he rights of persons, and the  
rights of property, arc the objects Ibr the pro  
lection ol which government was instituted,  
i&#x27;hcse rights cannot well he scpcraied. the  
personal right to acquiie property, which is a  
natural right, gives to properly, when acquir  
ed, a l ight to prelection, as a s icial right.  
I he essence of government is power—and  
power, lodged, us it must he in human  
  
hands, will ever tie name to aouse m  
archies, I tie interests ami happiness ol nil may  
he sacrificed lo the CH|«ice am! passimis ol a  
despot: In aristocracies, the right* and wel­  
fare ol the mmy may be sacritu d to Hi • pride  
and cupidity ol a few : In republics, the great  
danger is, that the majority may it t saflUr ut­  
ly respect the rights of the minority. Some  
gentlemen, consulting the pun y ami generost  
I, of their own minds, wittmtu advrfhiig lo  
,l,e lessons of experience, Would find a security  
against the danger, in our social leelmg—m a  
respect for character—in I lie dictate* ol the  
monitor within : in the iui rests of individuals : !  
in the Hggrenatc interests of the community.  
But man is known lo hi* a selfish, as well as a !  
social being. Kespect for tharac er, though  
oltcu a salutary restraint, is hoi too olfn ovei­  
mlfcil by other motives. U hen numbers ol  
meu act in a body, respect for character is j  
often h s .jost in proportion ns it is necessary  
to conn ol vtoial is uol nglil : We all know  
Ihai conscience is not a sufficient safeguard, j  
and besides, that conscience itself may be do j  
lulled—may be misled by an unconscious hi- J  
as into acts which an enlightened conscience |  
would forbid As to the permanent interest ot j  
individuals ill the aggregate inteicsls of the  
community, nml in the proverbial maxim that  
honesty is the hesi policy, present temptation j  
is too oftau found to be an overmatch for those ;  
considerations. These favorable attributes of;  
II, ,. human character are ail valuable, as auxil  
iailei—but they will not serve as a substitute  
for the coetcive provisions belonging to gov­  
ernment and law. They will always, in pm­  
poriinu as tliev prevail, be favorable to a mild  
administration ol both—but they can never be  
relied on as a guaranty of Hie light* ot the  
minority agam.i a majority disposed to take  
! unjust advantage ol iis power. 1 lie only ef­  
fectual safeguaid to the rights of the nimoiHy ■  
must be laid in such a basis and structure ol j  
me government itself as may atlord, in a cer­  
124111 degree, directly or mdireclly, a defensive !

iiumbei be made to enter into lliw hast ol olie  
branch ol Hie Legislature, and not into the  
other, such an arrangement 111144lit prove  
favouiable to the slave*themselves. It may f e,  
and I think it has been, suggested, that those  
who have themselves no »ot* iest m tins fp- cies  
of property, are apt lo sy mpaihy se with the  
slaves, more than may be the case with lion  
IIIHSO r ; and vv mid, therefore, be disposed,  
when they had the ascendancy, to protect  
them from laws of «*n oppressive character :  
whilst the masters, who have a common inter  
est with the slaves, against undue (Aiulion.  
which nm*t I**&#x27; paid out of tneir labour, will  
be their protector* when they liave (tic ascen  
dancy.  
The Convention Is pqw arrived at a point j  
where wt. must agree on some common ground, 1  
all sides relaxing 10 their opinions 1101 chaug j

Mr. Mapison rose, and addressed the committee in  
a speech, of which the following is the outline and sub-  
stance:  
  
Although the actual posture of the subject before the  
committee might admit a full survey of it, it is not my  
purpose, in rising, to enter into the wide field of dis-  
vussion Which has called forth a display of intellectual  
resources and varied powers of eloquence that any eoun-  
try might be proud of; and which Ll have witnessed with  
the highest gratification. Having been, for a very long  
period, withdrawn from any participation in proceedings  
of deliberative bodies, and under other disqoalifications  
now, of which I am deeply sensible, thought perhaps  
less sensible than others, may perceive that 1 ought to  
be, I shall not attempt more than a few observations,  
which may suggest the viewsI have taken of the sub-  
ject, and which will consume but little of the time of the  
committee, now become precious. It is sufficiently ob-  
vious, that persons and property are the two great sub-  
jects on which governments are to act; that the rights o!  
persons and the rights of property, are the objects for  
the protection of which government was instituted.  
These rights cannot well be separated.—The personal  
right to acquire property, which is a natural right, gives  
to property, when acquired,a right to protection, a54  
social right. The essence of government is power; a?  
  
wer, lodged, as it must be, in human hands, will ever  
™ liable toabuse. In monarehies, the interests and hap-

fare ot the many may be suwerificed to the pride and | us.  
eupidity of a few. In republics, the great danger is, |  
  
that the majority may not sufliciently respect the rights  
of the minority. Some gentlemen, consulting the puri-  
ty and generosity of their own minds, without adverting  
to the lessons of experience, would find a security against  
  
that danger,in our social feelings; in a respect tor char- |  
  
acter; in the dictates of the monitor within; in the inter-  
est of individuals, in the aggregate interests of the coim-  
munity. But man is known to be a selfish, as well asa  
social being. Respect for character, though often a sal-  
utary restraint, is but too often overruled by other mo-  
tives. When numbers of men act in a body, respect for  
character is often lost, just in proportion as it is wecessa-  
rv to control what is not right. We all kaow that con-  
science is not a sufficient safeguard, and besides that con-  
science itself may be deluded; may be misled by an un-  
conscious bias, into acts which an enlightened conscience  
would forbid. Astothe permanent interests of indivi-  
duals in the aggregate interests of the community, aud  
in the proverbial maxim that honesty is the best policy,  
present temptation is too often found to be an over match  
for those considerations. ‘These favorable attributes of  
the human character are all valuable, as auxiliaries; but  
  
they will not serve as a substitute for the coercive provi- | slaves themselves.  
They will al-  
  
sions belonging to government and law.  
  
if the example of our sister states is to have weight,  
we find that in Georgia the federal number is made the  
_ basis of representation in both branches of their legisla-  
| ture: and [ do not learn that any dissatisfaction or incon=  
| venience lias flowed trom its adoption. { wish we could  
_ know more of the manner in which particular izae  
tions of government operate in other parts of the United  
| States. There would be less cnet of being misled in-  
to error, and we should have the advantage of their  
experience as well as cur own. In the case I mens  
tion, there can, [ believe, be no error.  
Whether, therefore, we be fixing a basis of represen-  
tation, for the one braneh, or the other of our legislatare,  
or for both, in a combination with other prineiples, the.  
tederal ratio is a favorite resource with me, It enteredl  
| into my earliest views of the subject, before this conven-  
_tiou was assembled; and though I have kept my mind  
, open, have listened to every proposition which has beets  
advanced, and given to them all a candid consideration,  
| 1 must say that in my judgment, we shall act wisely in  
| preferring it to others, which have been brought before  
  
us. Should the federal number be made to enter into  
  
the basis in one branch of the legislature, and not inte the  
| other, such an arrangement might prove favorable to thé

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
To come more nearly to the subject  
before the committee, viz: that peculiar  
feature in our community, which calls  
for a peculiar division in the basis of our  
government, I mean the colored part of  
our population. It is apprehended, if the  
power of the commonwealth shall be in  
the hands of a majority who have no in-  
terest in this species of property, that,  
from the facility with which it may be  
oppressed by excessive taxation, injustice  
may be done to its owners. It would  
seem, therefore, if we can incorporate  
that interest into the basis of our system,  
it will be the most apposite and effectual  
security that can be devised.—Such an  
arrangement is recommended to me by  
many very important considerations. It  
is due to justice: due to humanity: due  
to truth: to the sympathies of our nature:  
in fine, to our character as a people, both  
abroad and at home; that they should  
be considered, as much as possible, in  
the light of human beings, and not as  
mere property. As such, they are acted  
upon by our laws, and have an interest  
  
as making a part, though a degraded  
part of the families to which they belong.  
If they had the complexion of the serfs  
in the north of Europe, or of the villeins  
formerly in England, in other terms, if  
they were of our own complexion, much  
of the difficulty would be removed. But  
the mere circumstance of complexion  
cannot deprive them of the character of  
men. ‘The federal number, as it is call-  
ed, is particularly recommended to at-  
tention in forming a basis of representa-  
tion, by its simplicity, its certainty, its sta-  
bility, and its permanency. Other expe-  
dients for securing justice in the case of  
taxation, while they amount in pecuniary  
effect, to the same thing, have been found  
liable to great objections: and I do not  
believe that a majority of this convention  
is disposed to adopt them, if they can  
find a substitute they can approve. Nor  
is it a small recommendation of the fed-  
eral number in my view, that it is in con-  
formity to the ratio recognized in the  
federal constitution. The cases, it is  
true, are not precisely the same, but there  
is more of analogy than might at first be  
supposed. If the colored population  
  
  
  
the analogy would fail; but existing, as  
it does, in large masses, in particular parts  
of it, the distinction between the diffe-  
rent parts of the state, resembles that be-  
tween the slave holding and non-slave  
holding states: and, if we reject a doc-  
trine in our own state, whilst we claim  
the benefits of it in our relations to other  
states, other disagreeable consequences  
may be added to the charge of inconsis-  
tency, which will be brought against us.  
  
know more of the manner in which par-  
ticular organizations of government ope-  
rate in other parts of the United States.  
There would be less danger of being mis-  
led into error, and we should have the  
advantage of their experience as well as  
our own. In the case I mention, there  
can, | believe, be no error.  
  
Whether, therefore, we be fixing a ba-  
sis of representation, for the one branch,  
or the other of our legislature, or for both,  
in a combination with other principles,  
the federal ratio is a favourite resource  
with me. It entered into my earliest  
views of the subject, before this conven-  
tion was assembled; and though I have  
kept my mind open, have listened to ev-  
ery proposition which has been advanced,  
and given to them all a candid considera-  
tion, I must say that in my judgment, we  
shall act wisely in preferring it to others,  
which have been brought before us.  
Should the federal number be made to  
enter into the basis of one branch of the  
legislature, and not into the other, such  
an arrangement might prove favorable to  
the slaves themselves. It may be, and !  
think it has been, suggested. that those  
who have themselves no interest in this  
species of property, are apt to sympathise  
with the slaves, more than may be the  
case with their masters; and would,  
therefore, be disposed, when they bad  
the ascendency, to protect them from  
laws of an oppressive character; whilst  
the masters, who have a common inter-  
est with the slaves against undue taxa-  
tion, which must be paid out of their la-  
bor, will be their protectors when they  
have the ascendency.  
  
The convention is noyy arrived at a  
point where we must agree on some com-  
mon ground, all sides relaxing in their  
opinions ;—not changing,—but mutually  
surrendering a part of them. In framing  
a constitution, great difficulties are neces-  
sarily to be overcome: and nothing can  
ever overcome them but a spirit of com-  
  
  
  
im our laws: They may be considered  
  
promise. Other nitions are surprised at

said that “ persons and property” are the

are to act, and that their’ protection is the

property, which is a natural right, gives to  
property when acquired, a right to protec-

“It is sufficiently obvious, said Mr. Madison, that persons and property are  
the two great objects on which Governments are to act; that the rights of per-  
sons and the rights of property are the objects for the protection of which  
Government was instituted. ‘These rights cannot well be separated. The

“In framing a Constitution, great difficulties are necessarily to be overcome,  
and nothing can ever overcome them but a spirit of compromise. Other na-  
tions are surprised at nothing so much as our having been able to form consti-  
tutions in the manner which has been exemplified in this country. Even the  
union of so many States, is, in the eyesofthe world a wonder; the harmoni-  
ous establishment of a common Government over them all, a miracle. I cannot  
but flatter myself that without a miracle, we shall be able to arrange all  
difficulties. I neverhave despaired, notwithstanding all the threatening ap-  
pearances we have passed through. I have now more than a hope —a conso-  
ling confidence —that we shall at last find that our labors have not been in  
vain.

Constitution of Virginia. He remarked that, “ the  
rights of persons, and the rights of property are the  
objects, for the protection of which Government  
was institated. ‘These rights can not well be sepa-  
rated. The personal right to acquire property,  
which is a natural right, gives to property, when  
acquired, a right to protection as a social right.  
The essence of Government is power, and power  
lodged in human hands will ever be liable to abuse.  
* * In Republics, the great danger is that the  
majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of  
the minority. * * * * * The only effectual safe-  
guard to the rights of the minority, must be laid in  
such a basis and structure of the Government itself  
as may afford, in a certain degree, directly or indi-  
rectly a defensive authority in behalf of a minority  
having right on its side. T’o come more nearly

If we can incorporate that interest into the basis of  
our system, it will be the most apposite and effec- |  
tual security that can be devised. Such an arrange-  
ment is recommended to me by many very impor-  
  
the checks and balances of the Constitution. Those  
  
who idolize the doctrine, that the majority must at  
  
all times, and under all circumstances, rule the mi-  
nority, may, at some distant day, agitate this ques-  
tion, and seek. by destroying the Constitution, to  
  
tant considerations. * * * They are acted upon by deprive the small States of the protection now  
our laws, and have an interest in ourlaws. They | afforded them.

ticularly recommended by its sinplicity, its cer-  
tainty, its stability and its permanency. * * * *  
Whether, therefore, we be fixing a basis of repre-  
sentation for the one branch or the other of our  
Legislature, or for both, in a combination with other  
principles, the Federal ratio is a favorite resource  
with me. .Jt entered into my earliest views of the  
subject, before this Convention was assembled ; and  
  
though I have kept my mind open, have listened to  
  
every proposition which has been advanced, and  
given to them all a candid consideration, I must  
say, that in my judgment we shall act wisely in pre-  
ferring it to others which have been brought before  
us.” (Debates of the Virginia Convention of 1829,

less for the East than it would secure if Mr.  
Madison’s views were carried out.  
Extracts from the remarks of Mr. Madison, in the  
Virginia Convention, on December 2d, 1829.  
“It is sufficiently obvious that persona and property  
are the two cleat subjects on which Governments are  
to ant; and that the rights of persons and the rights of  
property are the objects for the protection of which  
Government was instituted. These rights cannot well  
be separated. The person?) right to acquire property,  
which is a natural right, gives to property where ac­  
quired a right to protection as asocial right. The es­  
sence of Government is power, and power lodged, as  
it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.—  
In monarchies, the interests and happiness of all may  
tie sacrificed to the caprices and passions of a despot.—  
In Aristocracies, the rights and wellare of the many  
tnav be sacrificed to the pride and cupidity of the few.  
In Republics, the great danger is that the majority may  
not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority. *

The ouly effectual safeguard to the rights of the rnino­  
ity must be laid in such a basis and structure of the  
Government itself as may afford, in a certain degree, di­  
rectly or indirectly, a defensive authority in behalf of  
a minority having right on its side.  
* * “To come more nearly the subject before the  
  
Committee, viz : that peculiar leature in our commit­  
nitv which calls for a peculiar division in &#x27;he basis of  
our Government—1 mean the coloured part of our popu­  
lation. It is appreheoded.if he power oftheCommon­  
wealih shall be in the hands ofa majority who have no  
interest in this species ol property, that Irom tile iacility  
with which it may be oppressed by excessive taxation,  
injustice may be done to its owners. It would seem,  
therefore, if we can incorporate that interest iuto the  
basis of our system, it will ho the moat apposite and  
effectual security that can be devised. Such an arrange­  
ment is recommended to me by very important consi­  
derations. It isdue to justice, due to humanity, due to  
truth, to theeympatnies of our nature, in fine to our  
character as a people, both abroad and at home, that  
they should be considered as much as possible in the  
light of human beings, and not as mere property. As  
such they are acted upon by our laws and have an in­  
terest in our laws; they tnay be considered as making a  
part, though a degraded part, of the families to which  
they belong. If they had the complexion of the serfs in  
the north ol Europe, or iheviliier.slormerly in England—  
in other terms, if they were of our own complexion, much  
of thedifiieuliy would be removed. Hut the mere circum­  
stance ol complexion cannot deprive them ol the cha­  
racter of men; and the Federal number, as it is called, is  
particularly recommended to attention, in forming a basis  
ij\ representation, by its simplicity, its certamty, its stabi­  
lity, and its permanency. Other expedients lor secur­  
ing justice in the case of taxation, while they amount  
in pecuniary effect to the same thing, have been Inund  
list e to great objections, and I do not believe that a  
majority of this Convention is disposed to sdopt them  
If they can find a substitute they can approve. Nor is  
it a small recommendation ot the Federal number, in  
rny view,that it is in conformity to the ratio recognised  
in the Federal constitution. The cases, it is true, are  
not precisely the same; but there is more of analogy  
than ight at first be supposed; if the coloured  
population were equally diffused throughout the State,  
the an. logy would tail; but,existing, aa it does, in large  
l, .-■-■see in particular pane of it, the distinction between  
tne different parts ol the Slate resembles that between  
the slavehclding and non-slaveholding States, and il we  
reject a doctrine in our own State, while we claim the  
benefit of it in our relations to other States, other  
disagreeable consequences may he added to the charge  
of inconsistency which will be brought against us.

&quot; It is sufficiently obvious that persons and property  
are the two great subjects on which governments are  
to act, and that the rights of persons and the rights of  
property arc the objects for the jirotection of which  
government was instituted. The.se rights cannot wcl  
he scperated. The persona) right to acquire property  
whic i is a natural right, gives to property when ac­  
quired, a rljht to protection as a civil right.  
&quot;&#x27;J lie essence of government is power?and power  
lodged in human hands will ever be liablo to abuse. Iu  
monarchies the interests or happiness of all may be  
sacrificed to the caprice and passions of a despot. Iu  
aristocracies, the rights aud welfare of the many may  
be sacrificed to the pride and Cupidity of the few. Iu  
republics, the great danger is that the majorty may not  
sutlicienllv respect the rights of the minority.&quot;  
Iu auotlier part of his argument Mr. Madison pro­  
ceeds t  
&quot; To come more nearly to the subject before tlie com­  
mittee, viz: that peculiar feature in bur community  
which calls for a peculiar division in the basis of our gov­  
ernment?I mean the colored part of our population. It !  
is apprehended, if the power of the commonwealth shall |  
be iu the hands of a majority who have no interest in j  
ihis species of property, that from the facility r.-ith J  
which it may be oppressed by excessive taxation, in­  
justice may be done to its own(fc&gt;.&quot;  
This, I beg leave to remark, is precisely what I  
wish to prevent effectually by the ad valorem &quot;system of  
taxation which I propose as a part of the compromise.  
&quot; It would .?eem therefore,&quot; continues Mr. Madison,  
? if we can incorporate that iuterest into the basis of  
&gt;ur system, it will be the most apposite and effectual  
security that can be devised. Such an arrangement is  
recommended to me by many very important considera­  
ions. It is due to justice, due to humanity, due to truth,  
the xifwjMtthics of our nature ; in fine, to our character  
ts a profile both abroad and at home, that they should be  
:onsidcrrd as much as possible in the light of human be­  
nys and not as mere property. As such they are acted  
ipon by our laws, and hare uu interest in our laws,  
riiev may be considered as making a part, though a  
legraded part of the families to which they belong.&quot;  
Here it will be observed that Mr. Madison is most !  
mplmtie in regarding the slave population, a* far as
