.  
The Fœderalists committed an egregious Blunder, in a very unwarrantable and indecent Attempt, I had almost Said upon the freedom of Elections, at their previous Meeting for the Choice of Governor. The Opposite Party to be sure practice Arts nearly as unwarrantable, in secret, and by send agents with printed Votes— But this is no Justification unless upon Catos Principle In corruptâ civitate Corruptio est licita. i.e. In a corrupt City corruption is lawful!  
Elections are going the Usual Way in our devoted Country. Oh! that I had done with them.— We shall realize the raving in the Tempest, which Charles quoted to me in his last Letter.  
  
“In the Commonwealth We shall by contraries  
execute all Things: for no kind of Trafic  
shall We admit; no name of Magistrate;  
Letters will not be known, wealth, Poverty  
and Use of service none; contract, Succession  
bowen bound of Land, tilth, Vineyard none;  
No Use of Metal, corn or wine or oil;  
No Occupation, all Men idle all  
And Women too; but innocent and pure;  
No Sovereignty.  
All Things in common nature should produce  
Without sweat or endeavour; Treason Felony  
Sword Pike, knife, Gun, or need of any Engine  
Would I not have; But nature should bring forth  
of its own kind, all foizon, all Abundance  
to feed my innocent People.”  
  
This is Lubberland indeed— Le Pays de Cocain, I believe the French call it.— but it is terra incognita.— I am afraid We shall have too many of its qualities without its innocence.
