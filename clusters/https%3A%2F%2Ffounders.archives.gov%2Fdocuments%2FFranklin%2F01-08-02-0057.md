o David Hall.  
  
Philadelphia, Dec. 10, 1758  
I attended the late Treaty at Easton. I wish I could say the same Conduct as usual was not pursued. During the whole Treaty two Things were laboured with the utmost Diligence; to lessen the Power of Teedyuscung, and to save, if possible, a certain Character. In both they failed; for Teedyuscung, instead of losing has increased his Power, and established himself at the Head of five Tribes. The Indians that lie to the North of us, between us and the Lakes, consist of three Leagues: The Senekas, Mohawks, and Onondagoes, who are called the Fathers, compose the first: The Oneidas, Cayugas, Tuscororas, Nanticokes, and Conoys, (which are united into one Tribe) and the Tuteloes, compose the second League; and these two Leagues make up what we call the Six Nations. The third League is formed of the Chihohocki, (or Delawares) the Wanami, the Munseys, Mawhiccons, and Wapingers. From all these Nations, except two or three, we had the chief Sachems with us at Easton. The whole Number of Indians, by the best Account we could get, amounted to 501. I send you a Copy of what I there took down from Day to Day; it may give you some Notion of the Proceeding at Easton, and inform you of several Things which I doubt not will be misrepresented. I was careful to set down nothing but what I heard or saw myself, or received from good Authority. The Intimacy I had with several of the Indians, and the Confidence they have been pleased to repose in me, gave me an Opportunity of being acquainted with what passed at the private Council.  
On Saturday, Oct. 8, the Governor had the first Interview with the Indians, at which very little more passed than the Compliments usual at a first Meeting. Monday and Tuesday the Indians were in close Consultation among themselves. The Place of their Meeting at Croghan’s. And here let me observe, that it affords some Matter of Speculation, why Croghan, who is here in no public Capacity, should be honoured with a Guard at his Door. The Reason of the Indians meeting at his House is more easily accounted for, as he treats them with Liquor, and gives out that he himself is an Indian. The Subject in Debate these two Days, is, Whether what Teedyuscung has done shall stand, or they are to begin anew? The grand Thing aimed at by our Proprietary Managers, is to get Teedyuscung to retract the Charge of Fraud and Forgery. In order to gain this Point the Senekas and Six Nations are privately treated with and prompted to undo what has been done, in order, as is pretended, to establish their own Authority and gain the Credit of the Peace. Teedyuscung, and his People, absolutely refuse to retract any Thing they have said. He insists, that what was done in the Beginning of the War, was done by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senekas; that the Reasons he had assigned to the Governor for his striking the English, are the true and only Reasons. The Debates were warm. At Length it is agreed, that every Thing already transacted between Teedyuscung and the English shall stand; that at the opening the general Council, Teedyuscung shall make a short introductory Speech, after which the Seneka and other Chiefs, without invalidating any Thing already done, shall proceed to Business.  
Matters thus settled, they break up on Tuesday about 11 o’Clock, and expect to meet the Governor immediately, but the Meeting is deferred till next Day.  
On Wednesday Morning some of the Quakers got together the Chiefs and old Men of the several Tribes, in order to smoke a Pipe with them. After they had broken up, Mr. Chew of the Council, came to invite the Committee of Assembly to a Conference, in order to shew them the Speech the Governor intended to make to the Indians, and to take their Advice thereon; it being before agreed on, that Nothing should be said to the Indians, but what the Committee of Assembly and Commissioners should be previously made acquainted with. The Council and Commissioners being agreed, the Indians are desired to meet; while the Chiefs were calling them together the Governors agree to go to Dinner, and desire the Meeting may be deferred till four o’Clock. As the Indians were met when they received this, that they might not scatter, they agree to sit down and wait at the Place of Meeting till the Time appointed. At four the Governors came, when they had taken their Seats, Teedyuscung arose and made a Motion to speak, but the Governor of New Jersey said, as he had not yet welcomed the Indians, he desired to be heard first, and after welcoming the Indians in the Name of his Province, he recapitulated what he had done to obtain an Interview with them, confirmed what he had said in the Messages he had sent them, professed his Desire to do them Justice, and live at Peace with them, but insisted upon their delivering up those of his People they had Prisoners among them, without which, he could never be convinced of their Sincerity. He farther added, that as the Senekas and Cayugas had undertaken to answer his Message to the Munseys, he was ready to hear what they, or any other Indians there, had to say respecting his Province.  
As soon as he had done, Teedyuscung arose, and addressing the Governors said, that as he had been desired to invite down the several Nations of Indians he had any Intercourse with, he had done it; that here they were now met, and if they had any Thing to say to the Indians, or the Indians to them, they might now speak to each other; that for his own Part he had Nothing to do but to sit and hear; he had already told the Governor of Pensilvania the Cause why he had struck him, and had concluded a Peace with him, for himself and his People, and that every Thing which could be done at present was concluded and agreed upon, in order to secure a lasting Peace.  
With this he gave a String.  
Then Tagashata the Seneka arose and said, That he was very glad the Most High had brought them together with such good Countenances; but that the Day was now far spent, that the Business they were about was weighty and important; he therefore desired it might be deferred for the present, and that he might be heard To-morrow Morning early. On Thursday they met; the Conference was at first interrupted by Teedyuscung coming in drunk, and demanding of the Governor a Letter that the Alleghenians had sent by Pisquetumen. This Letter contained the Speech of the Alleghenians, in Answer to the Message delivered to them by Frederic Post. The Indians entrusted Post with the Carriage of it; but as he went from Shamokin to meet the General, he sent it down by the Indians, and by some Mistake inclosed it in a Packet to Bethlehem; so that when the Indians came to Philadelphia and met the Governor, in order to deliver their Speech and Belts, they found they had none. This gave them great Uneasiness, but the Governor informing them he expected Post at the Treaty, they agreed to go up to Easton and wait his Coming; and this they did the readier, as they had some Messages for Teedyuscung. But now being informed, that the Governor had received from Bethlehem the Letter containing their Speech, they desired Teedyuscung to request it of the Governor that it might be read, as they were eager to return, and a great deal depended on the Answer they were to carry back. As Teedyuscung was too drunk to do Business, Mr. Peters told him that the Letter should be read at another Time, and begged him to have a little Patience. This Bustle being over, Tagashata arose and spoke, approving what had been said by the Governor of the Jerseys, and declaring that the Minisinks had listened to the Advice of the Senekas, and laid down the Hatchet; and that they, the Senekas, had also sent the same Advice to the Delawares and Minisinks on the Ohio, and hoped they would regard it. After the Indians had finished their Speeches, just as the Council was going to break up, Mr. Norris, Speaker of the Assembly, arose, and craved the Ear of the Governors, letting them know that he understood Reports were propagated among the Indians to his Prejudice, and that tended to raise Uneasiness among them, and set them against the People of the Province. He then called upon Moses Tetamy, a noted Indian, to declare whether he had heard of any Person spreading a Report among the Indians, that he was concerned in the Purchase of Lands at or near Wyoming. Tetamy observed, that Teedyuscung was too drunk to enter upon that Matter now. Mr. Norris then said, that as that was the Case, and as he was obliged to go Home Tomorrow, and could not attend another Meeting, he took this Opportunity, in the Presence of both the Governors, and of all the Gentlemen present, to declare that he was neither directly nor indirectly engaged in the Purchase of any Lands at or near Wyoming; and that whoever asserted the contrary erred against Truth; and he desired Moses Tetamy would inform the Indians of this.  
This Speech was levelled against G. Croghan, who had been spreading some false Reports among the Indians, and endeavouring to set Teedyuscung against the People of the Province. As Mr. Norris had no Opportunity of canvassing the Matter publickly, in order to know what Croghan had said, he next Morning sent for Teedyuscung, who being asked what had passed between him and George Croghan respecting the Wyoming Lands, declared,  
  
That in the Beginning of this Week, G. Groghan came to him and told him, that Isaac Norris and a Quaker who lived in Philadelphia, had been concerned with the New-England People in purchasing the Lands at Wyoming, and that they had paid the Money for the said Lands; that though they endeavoured to make the Indians easy and satisfied about it, yet whenever the Indian Claim to these Lands was mentioned, they could not bear it, and were very uneasy about it; that the said G. Croghan desired him (Teedyuscung) to say nothing about this Affair to any Body at this Treaty, and that if he did not, it was in the Power of him the said George, who acted by Virtue of a Commission from Sir W. Johnson, to set that Affair right, and to settle the Indians on the said Lands, notwithstanding what these Purchasers could do. And Teedyuscung declared, that if this should prove true, neither he, nor any other Indians, would settle on these Lands, but would resent the Injury.  
This was interpreted by Moses Tetamy, in the Presence of Amos Strickland, James Wharton, James Child, and Abel James, who subscribed their Names as Evidences. And Mr. Norris, in order to satisfy Teedyuscung that the whole was a groundless Falsehood, wrote and signed and delivered to Teedyuscung a solemn Declaration, that neither he, nor any one for him, to his Knowledge, was either directly, or indirectly, concerned in the Purchase of any Lands at or near Wyoming.  
This done, he sent for G. Croghan, and read to him what Teedyuscung had charged him with; which Croghan positively denied, and appealed to another Indian who was present at the Conversation: The other Indian being called upon, confirmed every Word that Teedyuscung had said. Croghan still persisted in denying it, and told a plausible Story which he said was the Subject of their Conversation, as he could shew from his Diary. Mr. Norris told him, it was possible the Indians might have misunderstood him, and desired him to produce his Diary; but Croghan refused that, and said he would shew it to the Governors at a convenient Time, and that it should be read in public before the Conference broke up. On this one of the Indians observed, that it would be easy for him to go Home and write down what he pleased, and afterwards pretend he had done it before; that the best Way was to shew it now, and then it might have some Credit paid to it. This he was pressed to do, in Vindication of himself, and to avoid Suspicion. But he persisted in refusing, for a Reason, I suppose, you will think too obvious to mention, and went away in a Passion.  
It is evident from the Countenance and Favour Croghan meets with that he does not act of himself, in these his Endeavours to embroil Affairs among the Indians.  
On Friday, October 13, a Conference was held, at which the Governors spoke, and the Allegheny Letter was read. At the Close of the Conference, one Nichos a Mohawk made a Speech, which at Con. Wieser’s particular Request was not then interpreted in public. The Substance of the Speech, we were soon after informed, was to disclaim Teedyuscung’s Authority. This Nichos is G. Croghan’s Father-in-Law, and him ’tis thought Croghan now makes use of to raise Disturbance among the Indians, as he found himself baffled in his other Scheme. He could not prejudice Teedyuscung and set him against the People of the Province; he therefore now labours to set the Indians against him by the same Methods, I suppose, that he attempted the former.  
On Sunday, October 15, there was a private Conference at Scull’s but neither Teedyuscung nor any of his People were there. Next Day a Conference was held in public, at which were read the Minutes of what had passed: When they came to what was said Yesterday they stopped; but at the Request of the Six Nation Chiefs it was read. What concern’d Teedyuscung there, seemed little more than whether he should be considered as a King or an Emperor. They did not deny his Power over his own Nations, and he never claimed (except in his Cups, if then) any Authority over the Six Nations; nay, as the Governor observed, he expresly declared they were his Superiors, and that tho’ he acted as Head for his own four Tribes, he acted only as a Messenger from his Uncles.  
  
On Wednesday, October 8th, when the Six Nation Indians come to return an Answer, they gave us a Specimen of their Finesse in Politics. We had been harrassed with an Indian War; the Governor called upon them to declare the Causes of it. The Chiefs disclaimed all Concern in it, and declared that it was not done by the Advice or Consent of the Public Council of the Nations, tho’ they frankly owned some of their young Men had been concerned in it. As Counsellors they would not undertake to assign the Causes of their Uneasiness, or what had induced them to strike the English, lest it should appear as if they had countenanced the War, or at least had not been at due Pains to prevent it. They therefore left the Warriors to speak for themselves. The Causes they assigned were the same that had been assigned before. Our Managers were very earnest to have the Six Nations Speaker say he spoke for the Delawares. However, Teedyuscung maintained his Independancy; and as soon as Tomas King sat down, he arose and said, that as his Uncles had done, he would speak in Behalf of his own People; and as his Uncles had mentioned several Causes of Uneasiness, he would now mention one in Behalf of the Opines, or Wapings, &amp;c. This I find differently represented in the printed Treaty; but as there are several other Places liable to Objections, I shall, if I have Leisure, send you one with some Notes.  
You see by Tomas King’s Speech, that what was conjectured in the Enquiry relating to the Purchase of 1754, was not groundless, and that that Purchase was one main Cause of the War.  
  
I find the same Effect may be attributed to different Causes; for the going away of the Six Nation Chiefs, which I, who was not so clear-sighted as to discover the great Dissatisfaction said to have been visible in the Countenances of the Indians, attributed to the Coldness of the Day and the Fatigue of long sitting, I find in the printed Treaty ascribed to their Aversion to Teedyuscung and Disapprobation of what he was saying. The next Day the Munseys, dissatisfied with some Part of the Six Nations Conduct, demanded and received back the Belt by which they had put themselves and their Affairs under their Direction, and gave it to Teedyuscung. The Close of the Conference on Friday, October 20th, was nothing but Confusion. After the Governor had done, Nichos the Mohawk said the Governor left Things in the Dark; that neither he nor any of the Chiefs knew what Lands he meant; if he spoke of the Lands beyond the Mountains, they had already confessed their having sold them; but the Governor had their Deeds, why were not these produced and shewn to their Cousins the Delawares? Here C. Weiser went and brought the Deed of 1749. Nichos acknowledged the Deed. It was shewn to Teedyuscung; but he could not readily be made to understand why it was now brought, all Matters relating to Land being as he thought referred to the Determination of the King. Governor Bernard of the Jerseys, who had something to say, had several Times desired to be heard; but the Affair of the Deed so engrossed the Attention of our Governor, his Council, and Interpreter, that no Regard was paid to what Governor Bernard desired. In short their Behaviour on the Occasion was so very unpolite, that many could not help blushing for them. And at the last, the producing the Deed raised such a Commotion among the Indians, that they broke up without giving Governor Bernard an Opportunity to speak a Word.  
Next Day a private Conference was held with the Chiefs of the Indians. As our People have not thought fit to publish it, I shall give it to you as I had it from some who were present.  
Teedyuscung taking out a String of white and black Wampum, told the Council and Commissioners (the Governor was not there) that he had made Enquiry concerning the Deed produced Yesterday, and was satisfied his Uncles had sold the Land describ’d therein; he saw likewise that Nutimus the Delaware Chief had signed the Deed, and found upon Inquiry that he had received forty four Dollars, part of the Consideration-Money. This being the Case, he would make no Dispute about that Deed, but was ready to confirm it; for he wanted to be at Peace with his Brothers the English. But he observed, that his confirming that Deed would not affect the Claims he had formerly made; for the Lands he thought himself principally wronged in, lay between Tohiccon and the Kittatinny Hills. On this he gave a String. After he had delivered the String, Tokahayo, a Cayuga Chief, arose, and in a very warm Speech commended the Conduct of Teedyuscung, and at the same Time severely reprehended that of the English. He told Teedyuscung, “That he himself and the other Chiefs were obliged to him for his Candour and Openness; that they plainly perceived he spoke from the Heart, in the same Manner they used to do in ancient Times, when they held Councils together. They wished they could say as much of the English; but it was plain the English either did not understand Indian Affairs, or else did not act and speak with that Sincerity and in the Manner they ought. When the Indians delivered Belts, they were large and long; but when the English returned an Answer or spoke, they did it on small Belts and trifling little Strings.  
*Among the Indians the Size of the Belts they give with their Speeches, is always in Proportion to their Ideas of the greater or less Importance of the Matters treated of.  
And yet the English made the Wampum, whereas the Indians were obliged to buy it. But the Reason was, the Indians spoke from the Heart, the English only from the Mouth. Besides, how little the English attended to what was said appeared from this, that several of the Belts and Strings they (the Indians) had given them, were lost.” [That is unanswered; for you’ll please to observe no Answer was returned to the Complaints the Indians made respecting Carolina, the Ohio Affair, or the Opines.] “If the English knew no better how to manage Indian Affairs, they should not call them together. Here they had invited them down to brighten the Chain of Peace, but instead of that, had spent a Fortnight wrangling and disputing about Lands. What must the People of Allegheny think of this Conduct when they are informed of it by their Messengers?”  
On Tuesday a public Entertainment was given to the Indians, and in the Evening the Chiefs were called together by R. Peters and C. Weiser. Hitherto the Indians, tho’ several Times pressed to it, had deferred giving an Answer to the Proposal made on Behalf of the Proprietors to release back to the Indians the Lands of the Purchase of 1754, West of the Allegheny Mountains, provided the Indians would confirm to them the Residue of that Purchase. But the Deeds being drawn up agreeable to what the Proprietors proposed, it now remained to persuade the Indians to sign them as drawn. And To-night ’tis said that is done. I wish this may not be a Foundation of fresh Uneasiness. In public Council they declared they would confirm no more of that Land than what was settled in the Year 1754, for which only they had received the Consideration; but all the rest they reclaimed. Yet now by the Deed as drawn, ten Times, nay I may say twenty Times as much Land is conveyed as was then settled. For the English Settlements in 1754 extended but a little Way up the Juniata and Sherman’s Creek, whereas the present Grant reaches to the Allegheny Mountains. May not the Warriors to whom the Lands have been given for hunting Grounds disapprove this Grant as they did before, and maintain their Right by Force of Arms? I wish this Fear may be groundless. Besides, I could have wished that another Time than the Close of an Entertainment had been chosen for executing the Deeds, considering the Indians Fondness for Liquor.  
But I have already too much transgressed upon your Patience; I shall therefore only add that I am, &amp;c

Extract if a Letter from Philadelphia, dated Dec. 10  
  
7  
  
I attended the late Treaty at Eaſton. I wiſh I could  
ſay the ſame Conduct as uſual was not purſued. Dur-  
ing the whole Treaty two Things were laboured with  
the utmoſt Diligence; to leſſen the Power of Teedyy/-  
cung, and to ſave, if poſſible, a certain Character. In  
both they failed; for Teedyuſcung, inſtead of loſing has  
- Increaſed his Power, and eſtabliſhed himſelf at the  
  
Head of five Tribes. The Indians that lie to the  
North of us, between us and the Lakes, conſiſt of  
three Leagues: The Senckas, Mohawks, and Ononda-  
goes, Who are called the Fathers, compoſe the firſt :  
The Oneidas, Cayugas, Tuſcororas, Nanticokes, and  
Concys, (which are united into one Tribe) and the Tu-  
#eloes, compoſe the ſecond League; and theſe two  
Leagues make up what we call the Six Nations. The  
third Le ague is formed of the Chibobockz, (or Dela-  
_ wvares) the 777 anami, the Munſeys, Mawhiccons, and  
NJapingers. From all theſe Nations, except two or  
three, we had the chief Sachems with us at Egſton.  
The whole Number of Indians, by the beſt Account  
we cou&#x27;d get, amounted to 501. I ſend you a Copy  
of what I there took down from Day to Day; it may  
give you ſome Notion of the Proceeding at Eaſton,  
and inform you of ſeveral Things which I doubr nor  
will be miſrepreſented. I was careful to ſet down no-  
thing but what I heard or ſaw myſelf, or received  
from good Authority, The Intimacy I had with ſe-  
veral of the Indians, and the Confidence they have  
been pleaſed to repoſe in me, gave me an Opportunity  
of being acquainted with what palicd at the private  
Cchacif. |  
On Saturday, OF, 8, the Governor had the firſt  
  
Interview with the Indians, at which very little more  
paſſed than the Compliments uſual at a firſt Meeting.  
Monday and 7 aer the Iudians were in cloſe Conſul-  
  
tation  
  
„  
  
tation among themſelves. The Place of their Meet-  
ing at Croghan&#x27;s. And here let me obſerve, that it  
aftords ſome Matter of Speculation, why Crogban,  
who is here in no public Capacity, ſhould be honour-  
ed with a Guard at his Door. T he Reaſon of the In-  
dians meeting at his Houle is more eaſily accounted  
for, as he treats them with Liquor, and gives out  
that he himſelf is an Indian. The Subject in Debate  
theſe two Days, is, Whether what Teedyuſcung has  
done ſhall ſtand, or they are to begin anew? The grand  
Thing aimed at by our Proprietary Managers, is to  
get Teechuſcung to retract the Charge of F raud and For-  
gery. In order to gain this Point the Senetas and  
Six Nations are privately treated with and prompted  
to undo what has been done, in order, as is pretended,  
to eſtabliſh their own Authority and gain the Credit  
of the Peace. Teedyuſcung, and his People, abſo-  
lately refuſe to retract any Thing they have ſaid. He  
inſiſts, that what was done in the Beginning of the  
War, was done by and with the Advice and Conſent  
of the Senelas; that the Reaſons he had aſſigned to  
the Governor for his ſtriking the Eugliſb, are the true  
and only Reatons. The Debates were warm. At  
Length it is agreed, that every Thing already tranſ-  
acted between 7 eedyuſcung and the Enziiſh mall ſtand ;  
that at the opening the general Council, Teedyuſcung  
ſhall make a ſhort introductory Speech, after which  
the Seneta and other Chiefs, without invalidating any  
Thing already done, ſhall Proven to Buſineſs.  
  
Matters thus ſettled, they break up on Tueſday  
about 11 O&#x27;Clock, and expect to meet the Governor  
immediately, but the Meeting is deferred till next  
Day.  
On Wedneſday Morning ſome of the Quakers got  
together the Chiets and old Men of the ſeveral Tribes,  
in order to ſmoke a Pipe with them. After they had  
broken up, Mr. Chew of the Council, came to in-  
vite the Committee of Aſſembly to a Conference, in  
order to ſhew them the Speech the Governor intend-  
ed to make to the Indians, ald to take their Advice  
  
thereon;  
  
( 174 )  
thereon; it being before agrecd on, that Nothing  
ſhould be ſaid to the Indians, but what the Committee  
of Aſſembly and Commiſſioners ſhould be previouſly  
made acquainted with. The Council and Commiſ-  
ſioners being agreed, the Indians are deſired to meet;  
while the Chiefs were calling them together the Go-  
vernors agree to go to Dinner, and deſire the Meet-  
ing may be deferred till four o&#x27;Clock. As the Indi-  
ans were met when they received this, that they  
might not ſcatter, they agree to fit down and wait at  
the Place of Meeting till the Time appointed. At  
four the Governors came, when they had taken their  
Seats, Teedyuſcung aroſe and made a Motion to ſpeak,  
but the Governor of New Jerſey ſaid, as he had not yet  
welcomed the Indians, he deſired to be heard firſt,  
and alter welcoming the [ndians in the Name ot  
his Province, he recapitulated what he had done to  
obtain an Interview with them, confirmed what he  
had ſaid in the Meſſages he had ſent them, profeſſed  
his Deſire to do them Juſtice, and live at Peace with  
them, but inſiſted upon their delivering up thoſe of  
his People they had Priſoners among them, without  
which, he could never be convinced of their Sincerity.  
He farther added, that as the Senelas and Cayugas had  
undertaken to anſwer his Meſſage to the Munſeys, he  
was ready to hear what they, or any other [zdians there,  
had to ſay reſpecting his Province. | |  
As ſoon as he had done, Jeedyuſcung arofe, and  
addreſſing the Governors ſaid, that as he had been  
deſired to invite down the ſeveral Nations of Indians  
he had any Intercourſe with, he had done it ; that  
here they were now met, and if they had any Thing  
to ſay to the Indians, or the Indians to them, they  
might now ſpeak to each other ; that for his own Part  
he had Nothing to do but to fit and hear; he had al-  
ready told the Governor of Peuſilvania the Cauſe why  
he had ſtruck him, and had concluded a Peace with  
him, for himſelf and his People, and that every  
Thing which could be done at preſent was con-  
| clude:  
  
CE  
cluded and agreed upon, in order to ſecure a laſting  
Peace. IVith this he gave a String.  
  
Then Tageſhata the Serzka aroſe and ſaid, That he  
was very glad the Moſt High had brought them to-  
gether with ſuch good Countenances ; bur that the  
Day was now far ſpent, that the Buſineſs they were  
about was weighty and important; he therefore de-  
ſired it might be deferred for the preſent, and that  
he might be heard To-morrow Morning early. On  
Thurſagy they met ; the Conference was at firſt inter-  
rupted by Teechuſcung coming in drunk, and demand-  
ing of the Governor a Letter that the A. i had  
ſent by Piſguetumen. This Letter contained the Speech  
of the Alleghenians, in Anſwer to the Meſſage deliver-  
ed to them by Frederic Poſt. The Indians entruſted  
Poſt with the Carriage of it; but as he went from SHa-  
mokin to meet the General, he ſent it down by the  
  
  
to Bethlehem ; ſo that when the Indians came to Phi-  
  
  
their Speech and Belts, they found they had none.  
This gave them great Uneaſineſs, but the Governor  
informing them he expected Poſt at the Treaty, they  
agreed to go up to Eaſton and wait his Coming ; and  
this they did the readier, as they had ſome Meſſages  
for Teedyuſcung. But now being informed, that the  
Governor had received from Bethlehem the Letter con-  
taining their Speech, they deſired Teedyuſcung to re-  
queſt it of the Governor that it might be read, as they  
were eager to return, and a great deal depended on  
the Anſwer they were to carry back. As Teedvuſcung  
  
  
that the Letter ſhould be read at another Time, and  
begged him to have a little Patience. This Buſtle be-  
ing over, Tagaſbata arole and ſpoke, approving what  
hid been ſaid by the Governor of the Ferjeys, and de-  
claring that the Mini/nks had liſtened to the Advice  
of the Sexekas, and laid down the Hatchet; and that  
  
  
the  
  
IIs; cc ls  
  
(176 )  
the Delewares and Miniſints on the Ohio, and hoped  
they would regard it. After the Indians had finiſhed  
their Speeches, juſt as the Council was going to break  
up, Mr. Norris, Speaker of the Aſſembly, aroſe, and  
  
  
that he underſtood Reports were propagated among  
the Indians to his Prejudice, and that tended to raiſe  
Uneaſineſs among them, and ſet them againſt the Peo-  
ple of the Province. He then called upon Moſes Te-  
tamy, a noted Indian, to declare whether he had heard  
of any Perſon ſpreading a Report among the Indians,  
  
that he was concerned in the Purchaſe of Lands at or  
near F/yoming. Tetamy obſerved, that Teedyuſcung was  
too drunk to enter upon that Matter now. Mr. Nor-  
ris then ſaid, that as that was the Caſe, and as he was  
obliged to go Home Tomorrow, and could not at-  
tend another Meeting, he took this Opportunity, in  
the Preſence of both the Governors, and of all the  
Gentlemen preſent, to declare that he was neither di-  
ety nor indirectly engaged in the Purchaſe of any  
Lands at or near Hyomiug; and that whoever aflerted  
  
  
ſes Tetamy would intorm the Indians of this.  
  
This Speech was levelled againſt C. Crogban, who  
had been ſpreading ſome falſe Reports among the In  
diaus, and endeavouring to ſet Te edy uſ/cung againſt the  
People of the Province. As Mr. Norrzs had no Op-  
portunity of canvaſſing the Matter publickly, in order  
to know what Croghan had ſaid, he next Morning ſent  
for Tee:yuſcung, who being aſked what had paſſed be-  
tween him and George C7 oghan reſpecting the Wyoming  
Lands, declared,  
  
That in the Beginning of this Week, G. Croghan  
came to him and told him, that Yaac Norris and a  
Quaker who lived in Philadelphia. had been concerned  
  
  
at FL yoming, and that they had paid the Money for the  
faid Lands; that though they endeavoured to make  
the IJudians eaſy and ſatisfied about it, yet whenever  
the Indian Claim to theſe Lands was mentioned, they  
| | could

Hs (ink |  
could not bear it, and were very uneaſy about it ; that  
the ſaid G. Croghan deſired him (Teedyuſcung) to ſay  
nothing about this Affair to any Body at this Treaty,  
and that if he did not, it was in the Power of him  
the ſaid George, who acted by Virtue of a Commiſ-  
ſion from Sir V. Johnſon, to ſet that Affair right, and  
to ſettle the Indians on the ſaid Lands, notwithſtand-  
ing what theſe Purchaſers could do. And Teedyuſ-  
cung declared, that if this ſhould prove true, neither  
he, nor any other Indians, would ſettle on theſe Lands,  
but would reſent the Injury. I  
This was interpreted by Maſes Tetamy, in the Pre-  
ſence of Amos Strickland, Fames Wharton, Fames  
Child, and Abel Fames, who ſubſcribed their Names  
as Evidences. And Mr. Norris, in order to fatisfy  
Teedyuſcung that the whole was a groundleſs Falſe-  
hood, wrote and ſigned and delivered to Teedyuſcung  
a ſolemn Declaration, that neither he, nor any one  
for him, to his Knowledge, was either directly, or  
indirectly, concerned in the Purchaſe of any Lands at  
or near //yoming. | |  
This done, he ſent for G. Crogban, and read to him  
what Teedyuſcung had charged him with; which Crog-  
an politively denied, and appealed to another Indian  
who was. preſent at the Converſation : The other 1z-  
dian being called upon, confirmed every Word that  
  
Teedyuſcung had ſaid. Croghan ſtill perſiſted in de-  
  
  
the Subject of their Converſation, as he could ſhew  
from his Diary. Mr. Norris told him, it was poſſi-  
ble the Indians might have miſunderſtood him, and  
  
  
ſed that, and ſaid he would ſhew it to the Governors  
  
  
public before the Conference broke up. On this one  
of the Indians obſerved, that it would be eaſy for him  
to go Home and write down what he pleaſed, and  
afterwards pretend he had done it before; that the  
  
  
{ome Credit paid to it. This he was preſſed to do,

But he perſiſted in refuſing, for a Reaſon, I ſuppoſe,  
you will think too obvious to mention, and went a-  
way in a Paſſion. | „  
It is evident from the Countenance and Favour  
Croghan meets with that he does not act of himſeif,  
  
  
Indians. | :  
  
On Friday, Oflober 13, a Conference was held,  
at which the Governors ſpoke, and the Allegheny Let-  
ter was read. At the Cloſe of the Conference, one  
Nichos a Mohawk made a Speech, which at Con.  
  
  
in public. The Subſtance of the Speech, we were  
ſoon after informed, was to diſclaim Teedyuſcung&#x27;s Au-  
thority. This Nichos is G. Croghan&#x27;s Father-in-Law,  
and him &#x27;tis thought Croghan now makes uſe of to  
raiſe Diſturbance among the Indians, as he found him-  
ſelf baffled in his other Scheme. He could not  
prejudice Teedyuſcung and ſet him againſt the People of  
the Province; he therefore now labours to ſet the In-  
dians againſt him by the ſame Methods, I ſuppoſe, that  
he attempted the former.  
  
On Sunday, October 15, there was a private Con-  
ference at Scull&#x27;s but neither Teedyuſcung nor any of his  
People were there. Next Day a Conference was held  
in public, at which were read the Minutes of what  
had paſſed : When they came to what was ſaid Yeſter-  
day they ſtopped ; but at the Requeſt of the Six Na-  
tion Chiefs it was read. What concern&#x27;d Teedyuſcung  
there, ſeemed little more than whether he ſhould be  
conſidered as a King or an Emperor. They did not  
  
  
claimed (except in his Cups, if then) any Autho-  
  
  
ſerved, he expreſly declared they were his Superiors,  
  
and that tho? he acted as Head for his own four Tribes,  
  
he acted only as a Meſſenger from his Uncle.  
On Wedneſday, October 8th, when the Six Nation In-  
  
  
cimen  
  
( 179 ))  
cimen of their Fineſſe in Politics. We had been har-  
raſſed with an Indian War; the Governor called upon  
them to declare the Cauſes of it. The Chiefs diſ-  
claimed all Concern in it, and declared that it was  
not done by the Advice or Conſent of the Public  
Council of the Nations, tho* they frankly owned  
ſome of their young Men had been concerned in it.  
As Counſellors they would not undertake to aſſign the  
Cauſes of their Uneaſineſs, or what had induced them  
to ſtrike the Engliſb, leſt it ſhould appear as if they  
had countenanced the War, or at leaſt had not  
been at due Pains to prevent it. They therefore left the  
Warriors to ſpeak ſor themſelves. The Cauſes they aſ-  
ſigned were the ſame that had been aſſigned before.  
Our Managers were very earneſt to have the Six Na-  
tions Speaker ſay he ſpoke for the Delawares. How-  
ever, Teedyuſcung maintained his Independancy ; and  
as ſoon as Tomas King ſat down, he aroſe and ſaid, that  
as his Uncles had done, he would ſpeak in Behalf of  
  
  
veral Cauſes of Uneaſineſs, he would now mention  
  
one in Behalf of the Opines, or Wapings, &amp;c. This I  
find differently repreſented in the printed Treaty; but  
as there are ſeveral other Places liable to Objections, I  
  
  
You ſee by Tomas King&#x27;s Speech, that what was  
conjectured in the Enquiry relating to the Purchaſe  
of 1754, was not groundleſs, and that that Purchaſe  
was one main Cauſe of the War.  
  
I find the ſame Effect may be attributed to different  
  
  
which I, who was not ſo clear- ſighted as to diſcover the  
great Diſſatisfaction ſaid to have been viſible in the Coun-  
  
  
the Day and the Fatigue of long fitting, I find in the  
printed Treaty aſcribed to their Averſion to Teedyuf-  
cung and Diſapprobation of what he was ſaying. —

Part of the Six Nations Conduct, demanded and re-

ſelves and their Affairs under their Direction, and  
  
gave it to Teedyuſcung. The Cloſe of the Conference  
on Friday, October 20th, was nothing but Confuſion.  
  
  
ſaid the Governor left Things in the Dark; that nei:  
  
ther he nor any of the Chiefs knew: what Lands he  
meant; if he ſpoke of the Lands beyond the Moun-  
tains, they had already confeſſed their having ſold  
them; but the Governor had their Deeds, why were  
not theſe produced and ſhewn to their Couſins the De-  
lawares? Here C. Weiſer went and brought the Deed  
of 1749. Nichos acknowledged the Deed. It was  
ſhewn to Teechuſcung; but he could not readily be  
made to underſtand why it was now brought, all Mat-  
  
  
the Determination of the King. Governor Bernard  
of the Fer/eys, who had ſomething to ſay, had ſeveral  
Times deſired to be heard; bur the Affair of the Deed  
ſo engroſſed the Attention of our Governor, his  
Council, and Interpreter, that no Regard was paid  
to what Governor Bernard deſired. In ſhort their Be-  
haviour on the Occaſion was ſo very unpolite, that  
  
  
Jaſt, the producing the Deed raiſed ſuch a Commo-  
tion among the Jadians, that they broke up without  
giving Governor Bernard an Opportunity fo ſpeak a  
Word.  
Next Day a private Conference was held with the  
Chiefs of the Indians. As our People have not thought  
fit to publiſh it, I thall give it to you as J had it from  
ſome who were prefent.  
Teedyuſcung taking out a String of white and black  
Wampum, told the Council and Commiſſioners (the  
Governor was not there) that he had made Enquiry  
concerning the Deed produced Yeſterday, and was ſa-  
tisfied his Uncles had ſold the Land deſcrib&#x27;d therein;  
  
  
ſigned the Deed, and found upon Inquiry that he had  
received forty four Dollars, part of the Confideration-  
Money. This being the Caſe, he would make no

7 Diſpute about that Deed, but was ready to confirm it;  
for he wanted to be at Peace with his Brothers the  
Engliſh. But he obſerved, that his confirming that  
Deed&#x27; would not affect the Claims he had formerly  
made; for the Lands he thought himſelf principally  
wronged. in, lay between Tohiccon and the Kittatinny  
Hills, On this he gave a String. After he had  
delivered the String, Tokahayo, a Cayuga Chief, a-  
roſe, and in a very warm Speech commended the  
Conduct of Teedyuſcung, and at the ſame Time ſevere-  
ly reprehended that of the Engliſo. He told Teedyuſ-  
cung, That he himſelf and the other Chiefs were  
obliged to him for his Candour and Openneſs ; that  
they plainly perceived he ſpoke from the Heart,  
in the ſame Manner they uſed: to do in ancient  
1imes, when they held Councils together. They  
wiſhed they could fay as much of the Engliſh ; but  
it was plain the Engliſb either did not underſtand In-  
dian Affairs, or elſe did not act and ſpeak with that  
Sincerity and in the Manner they ought. When ms  
Tndians delivered Belts, they were large and long  
but when the Engliſb returned an Anſwer or ſpoke,  
they did it on ſmall Belts and trifling little Strings *.  
And yet the Engliſb made the Wampum, whereas  
the Indiaus were obliged to buy it. But the Reaſon  
was, the Indians ſpoke from the Heart, the Enghifh  
only from the Mouth. Beſides, how little the Eu-  
gliſo attended to what was ſaid appeared from this,  
that ſeveral of the Belts and Strings they (the In-  
© dians) had given them, were loſt. oy [That is unan-  
ſevered, for you&#x27;ll pleaſe to obſerve no Anſwer was  
returned to the Complaints the Indians made reſpect-  
ing Carolina, the Ohio Affair, or the Opines.] If the  
Engliſb knew no better how to manage Indian Af-  
fairs, they ſhould not call them together. Here
