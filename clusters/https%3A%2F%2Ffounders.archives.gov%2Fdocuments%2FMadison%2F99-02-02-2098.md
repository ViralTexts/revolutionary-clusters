e Rayneval’s letter to Mr Monroe.  
The quotations there made are from the original papers, to which I had access in the British office of Foreign Affairs. I  
have written to Mr Monroe, respecting the copy you allowed me to take, but have not as yet received an answer.  
Tomorrow I shall set off on a tour of five or six weeks to Quebec, and the classic regions on the Lakes,  
chiefly with the view of examining minutely the battle grounds and other localities of historical note. With the greatest  
respect and sincere regards. I have the honor to be, Sir, your much obliged &amp; most obt. servt.

[enclosure]   
&quot;The period which will close the appointment with which my fellow citizens have honoured me, being not  
very distant, and the time actually arrived at which their thoughts must be designating the citizen who is to  
administer the Executive Government of the United States during the ensuing term, it may be requisite to a more  
distinct expression of the public voice that I should apprise such of my fellow citizens as may retain their  
partiality towards me, that I am not to be numbered among those out of whom a choice is to be made.  
&quot;I beg them to be assured that the Resolution which dictates this intimation has not been taken without  
the strictest regard to the relation which as a dutiful citizen, I bear to my country; and that in withdrawing that  
tender of my service which silence in my situation might imply, I am not influenced by the smallest deficiency of zeal  
for its future interests, or of grateful respect for its past kindness; but by the fullest persuasion that such a step  
is compatible with both.&quot;  
  
  
  
&quot;The impressions under which I entered on the present arduous trust were explained on the proper  
occasion. In discharge of this trust, I can only say that I contributed towards the organization and administration of  
the Government, the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. For any errors which may have flowed  
from this source, I feel all the regret which an anxiety for the public good can excite; not without the double  
consolation however arising from a consciousness of their being involuntary, and an experience of the candor which  
will interpret them. If there were any circumstances which could give value to my inferior qualifications for the  
trust, these circumstances must have been temporary. In this light was the undertaking viewed when I ventured upon it.  
Being moreover still farther advanced into the decline of life, I am every day more sensible that the increasing  
weight of years, renders the private walks of it in the shade of retirement, as necessary as they will be acceptable  
to me. May I be allowed to add, that it will be among the highest as well as purest enjoyments that can sweeten the  
remnant of my days; to partake, in a private station in the midst of my fellow citizens, of that benign influence of  
good laws under a free Government which has been the ultimate object of all our wishes, and in which I confide as the  
happy reward of our cares and labours. May I be allowed further to add as a consideration far more important, that an  
early example of rotation in an office of so high &amp; delicate a nature, may equally accord with the republican  
spirit of our Constitution, and the ideas of liberty and safety entertained by the people.&quot;If a farewell address is to be added at the expiration of the term, the following paragraph may conclude  
the present)  
  
  
  
&quot;Under these circumstances a return to my private station according to the purpose with which I quitted  
it, is the part which duty as well as inclination assigns me. In executing it I shall carry with me every tender  
recollection which gratitude to my fellow Citizens can awaken; and a sensibility to the permanent happiness of my  
Country which will render it the object of my unceasing vows and most fervent supplications.&quot;(Should no further address be intended, the preceding clause may be omitted and the present address  
proceed as follows)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
&quot;In contemplating the moment at which the curtain is to drop for ever on the public scenes of my life, my  
sensations anticipate and do not permit me to suspend, the deep acknowledgments required by that debt of gratitude  
which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred on me,– for the distinguished confidence it has  
reposed in me,– and for the opportunities I have thus enjoyed, of testifying my inviolable attachment by the most  
steadfast services which my faculties could render. All the returns I have now to make will be in those vows which I  
shall carry with me to my retirement and to my grave, that Heaven may continue to favour the people of the United  
States with the choicests tokens of its beneficence; that their union in brotherly affection may be perpetual;– that the  
free constitution which is the work of their own hands, may be sacredly maintained;– that its administration in every  
department may be stamped with wisdom and with virtues– and that this character may be ensured to it, by that  
watchfulness over public servants, and public measures, which on one hand will be necessary to prevent or correct a  
degeneracy;– and that forbearance, on the other, from unfounded or indiscriminate jealousies, which would deprive the  
public of the best services, by depriving a conscious integrity of one of the noblest incitements to perform them:–  
that in fine, the happiness of the people of America, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete, by so  
careful, a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire them the glorious satisfaction of  
recommending it to the affection, the praise and the adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.&quot;And may we not dwell with well grounded hopes on this flattering prospect, when we reflect on the many  
ties by which the people of America are bound together, and the many proofs they have given of an enlightened  
judgment and a magnanimous patriotism.&quot;We may all be considered as the children of one common Country. We have all been embarked in one common  
cause. We have all had our share in common sufferings and common successes. The portion of the Earth allotted for the  
theatre of our fortunes, fulfils our most sanguine desires. All its essential interests are the same, whilst the  
diversities arising from climate, from soil, and from other local and lesser peculiarities, will naturally form a  
mutual relation of the parts, that may give the whole a more entire independence, than has

&quot;I beg them to be assured, that the

not influenced by the smallest deficiency  
of zeal for its future interests, or of grata  
fill respect for its pnst kindness; but by the  
fullest persuasion, that such a step is com­  
patible with both.  
&quot;Tho impressions under which I entered  
on the present arduous trust, wore explain­  
ed on the proper occasion. In discharge  
of this trust, I can only say that I contribu­  
ted, towards tho organization and adminis

&quot;If there were any circumstances, which

must have been temporary. In this light  
waB the undertaking viewed when I ven

every day more sensible, that the increas­  
ing weight of years renders the private  
  
walks of it, in the shado of retirement, as  
  
necessary as they will be acceptable to me.  
May 1 be allowed to add, that it be  
among l he highest ns welll as purest en  
joyments that can sweeten the remnant of  
my dys, to partake in a private station, lit  
tho midst of my follow cittizons, of that  
benign influence of good laws under a free  
government, which has been tho ultimata  
object of all our wishes, and in which t  
confute as the happy reward of our cares  
and labors? May I be allowed further U  
add, as a Consideration far more important  
that an early example of rotation in an  
office ofo high and delicate a nature, may  
equally accoru witn the republican spirit  
of our Constitution, and tho ideas of liberty  
ano snieiy cnicriaineu tjy the people.  
lit a larcwcll address is to be added at.  
the expiration of tho term, llie fallowing  
paragraph may conclude the present.&#x27;)  
&quot;Under these circumstances, a return to  
my private stations, according lo the pur­  
pose with which I quitted it, is the part  
which duty as well as inclination assigns  
me. In executing it, I shall carry with mo  
every lender recollection, which gratitude  
to my fellow citizens can awaken; and a  
sensibility to the permanent happiness of  
my country, which will tender it the object  
of my increasing vows and most fervent  
supplications.&quot;  
ishould no further address be intended.  
the preceding clause may bo omitted and  
the present address proceed as follows.  
&quot;In contemplating the moment at which  
the curtain is to drop forever on the pub  
lic scenes ol my life, my sensations antici­  
pate, and do not permit me to suspend,  
the deep acknowledgments required by  
that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my  
beloved country, for tho many honors it  
has conferred upon me, for llie distinguish­  
ed confidence il has reposed in me, and fat  
tho opportunities I havo thus enjoyed, of  
testifying my inviolable attachment by tho  
most steadfast services which my faculties  
could render.  
&quot;All the returns I have now to mako  
will be in those vows, which I shall carry  
with mo to my retirement and to my grave  
that Heaven may continue lo favor the  
people of llie United Siatc3 with tho  
choicest tokens of its benrficience; that  
their union nnd brotherly affection may bo

character may be ensured lo it, bv that  
watchfulness over public servants and pub­  
lic incisures, which on one hand will be  
necessary lo prevent or correct a degener­  
acy ;--aud that forbearance on the other,  
from unfounded or indiscriminate jealous­

best 6orvtcoa, by depriving a conscious in­

u-o of this blessing, as will acquire them  
the glorious satisfaction of recommending

wo reflect on llie many lies by which tho  
people of Amo&#x27;ica are bound together, and  
llie many proofs they have given of an en­

&quot;Wo may all be considered ns the chil­
