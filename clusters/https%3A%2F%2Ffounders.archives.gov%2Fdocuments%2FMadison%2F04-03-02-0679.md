r Sir  
Monticello Dec. 24. 25.  
  
I have for some time considered the question of Internal improvemt as desparate. The torrent of general opinion sets so strongly in favor of it as to be irresistable. And I suppose that even the opposition in Congress will hereafter be merely formal, unless something can be done which may give a gleam of encoragement to our friends, or alarm their opponents in their fancied security. I learn from Richmond that those who think with us there are in a state of perfect dismay, not knowing what to do, or what to propose. Mr. Gordon, our representative particularly has written to me in very desponding terms, not disposed to yield indeed, but pressing for opinions and advice on the subject. I have no doubt you are pressed in the same way, and I hope you have devised and recommended something to them. If you have, stop here and read no more, but consider all that follows as non-avenue. I shall be better satisfied to adopt implicitly any thing which you may have advised, than any thing occurring to myself, for I have long ceased to think on subjects of this kind, and pay little attention to public proceedings. But if you have done nothing in it, then I risk for your consideration what has occurred to me, and is expressed in the inclosed paper. Bailey’s propositions, which came to hand since I wrote the paper, and which I suppose to have come from the President himself, shews a little hesitation in the purposes of his party; and in that state of mind a bolt shot critically may decide the contest, by it’s effect on the less bold. The olive branch held out to them at this moment may be accepted, and the Constitution thus saved at a moderate sacrifice. I say nothing of the paper, which will explain itself. The following heads of consideration, or some of them may weigh in it’s favor.  
It may intimidate the wavering.  
It may break the Western coalition by offering the same thing in a different form.  
It will be viewed with favor in contrast with the Georgia opposition &amp; fear of strengthening it.  
It will be an example of a temperate mode of opposition in future and similar cases.  
It will delay the measure a year at least;  
It will give us the chance of better times and of intervening accidents; and in no way place us in a worse than our present situation.  
I do not dwell on these topics; your mind will develope them.  
The 1st. question is whether you approve of doing any thing of the kind. If not, send it back to me, and it shall be suppressed; for I would not hazard so important a measure against your opinion, nor even without it’s support.  
  
If you think it may be a canvas on which to put something good, make what alterations you please, and I will forward it to Gordon under the most sacred injunction that it shall be so used as that not a shadow of suspicion shall fall on you or myself that it has come from either of us. But what you do, do as promptly as your convenience will admit lest it should be anticipated by something worse. Ever and affectionately yours

[Enclosure]The solemn Declaration and Protest of the commonwealth of Virginia on the principles of the Constitution of the US. of America &amp; on the violations of them.  
We the General assembly of Virginia, on behalf, and in the name, of the people thereof do declare as follows.  
The states in N. America which confederated to establish their independance on the government of Great Britain, of which Virginia was one, became, on that acquisition, free and independant states, and as such authorised to constitute governments, each for itself, in such form as it thought best.  
They entered into a compact (which is called the Constitution of the US. of America) by which they agreed to unite in a single government as to their relations with each other, and with foreign nations, and as to certain other articles particularly specified. They retained at the same time, each to itself, the other rights of independant government comprehending mainly their domestic interests.  
For the administration of their Federal branch they agreed to appoint, in conjunction, a distinct set of functionaries, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the manner settled in that compact: while to each severally and of course, remained it’s original right of appointing, each for itself, a separate set of functionaries, legislative executive and judiciary also, for administering the Domestic branch of their respective governments.  
These two sets of officers, each independent of the other, constitute thus a whole of government, for each state separately the powers ascribed to the one, as specifically made federal, exercisable over the whole, the residuary powers, retained to the other, exercisable exclusively over it’s particular state, foreign herein, each to the others, as they were before their original compact.  
To this construction of government &amp; distribution of it’s powers, the Commonwealth of Virginia does religiously and affectionately adhere, opposing, with equal fidelity and firmness, the usurpation of either set of functionaries on the rightful powers of the other.  
But the federal branch has, assumed in some cases and claimed in others, a right of enlarging it’s own powers by constructions, inferences, and indefinite deductions, from those directly given, which this assembly does  
  
declare to be usurpations of the powers retained to the independant branches, mere interpolations into the compact, and direct infractions of it.  
They claim, for example, and have commenced the exercise of a right to construct roads, open canals, &amp; effect other internal improvements, within the territories and jurisdictions exclusively belonging to the several states, which this assembly does declare has not been given to that branch by the constitutional compact, but remain to each state among it’s domestic and unalienated powers, exercisable within itself, and by it’s domestic authorities alone.  
This assembly does further disavow, and declare to be most false and unfounded, the doctrine, that the compact, in authorising it’s federal branch to lay and collect taxes duties, imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the US. has given them thereby a power to do whatever they may think, or pretend, would promote the general welfare, which construction would make that, of itself, a complete government, without limitation of powers; but that the plain sense and obvious meaning was that they might levy the taxes necessary to provide for the general welfare by the various acts of power therein specified and delegated to them, and by no others.  
Nor is it admitted, as has been said, that the people of these states, by not investing their federal branch with all the means of bettering their condition, have denied to themselves any which may effect that purpose since, in the distribution of these means, they have given to that branch those which belong to it’s department, and to the states have reserved separately the residue which belong to them separately. And thus by the organization of the two branches taken together, have completely secured the first object of human association, the full improvement of their condition, and reserved to themselves all the faculties of multiplying their own blessings.  
Whilst the General assembly thus declares the rights retained by the states, rights which they have never yielded, and which this state will never voluntarily yield, they do not mean to raise the banner of disaffection, or of separation from their sister-states, co-parties with themselves to this compact. They know and value too highly the blessings of their union as to foreign nations and questions arising among themselves, to consider every infraction as to be met by actual resistance; they respect too affectionately the opinions of those possessing the same rights under the same instrument, to make every difference of construction a ground of immediate rupture. They would indeed consider such a rupture as among the greatest calamities which could befall them; but not the greatest. There is yet one greater, submission to a government of unlimited powers. It is only when the hope of avoiding this shall become absolutely desperate, that further forbearance could not be indulged. Should a majority of the Co-parties therefore contrary to the expectation and hope of this assembly, prefer, at  
  
this time, acquiescence in these assumptions of power by the federal member of the government, we will be patient and suffer much, under the confidence that time, ere it be too late, will prove to them also the bitter consequences in which this usurpation will involve us all. In the meanwhile we will breast with them, rather than separate from them, every misfortune save that only of living under a government of unlimited powers. We owe every other sacrifice to ourselves, to our federal brethren, and to the world at large, to pursue with temper and perseverance the great experiment which shall prove that man is capable of living in society, governing itself by laws self-imposed, and securing to it’s members the enjoyment of life, liberty, property and peace; and further to shew that even when the government of it’s choice shall shew a tendency to degeneracy, we are not at once to despair but that the will &amp; the watchfulness of it’s sounder parts will reform it’s aberrations, recall it to it’s original and legitimate principles, and restrain it within the rightful limits of self-government. And these are the objects of this Declaration and Protest.  
Supposing then that it might be for the good of the whole, as some of it’s Co-states seem to think, that the power of making roads and canals should be added to those directly given to the federal branch, as more likely to be systematically and beneficially directed, than by the independant action of the several states, this Commonwealth, from respect to these opinions, and a desire of conciliation with it’s Co-states, will consent, in concurrence with them, to make this addition, provided it be done regularly by an amendment of the compact, in the way established by that instrument, and provided also it be sufficiently guarded against abuses, compromises, and corrupt practices, not only of possible, but of probable occurrence.  
And As a further pledge of the sincere and cordial attachment of this commonwealth to the Union of the whole so far as has been consented to by the compact called “the Constitution of the US. of America” (construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning of it’s language, to the common intendment of the time, and of those who framed it) to give also to all parties and authorities time for reflection, and for consideration whether, under a temperate view of the possible consequences, and especially of the constant obstructions which an equivocal majority must ever expect to meet, they will still prefer the assumption of this power rather than it’s acceptance from the free will of their constituents, and to preserve peace in the meanwhile, we proceed to make it the duty of our citizens, until the legislature shall otherwise &amp; ultimately decide, to acquiesce under those acts of the federal branch of our government which we have declared to be usurpations, and against which, in point of right, we do protest as null and void, and never to be quoted as precedents of right.  
We therefore do enact, and be it enacted by the General assembly of Virginia that all citizens of this commonwealth, and persons and authorities  
  
within the same, shall pay full obedience at all times to the Acts which may be past by the Congress of the US. the object of which shall be the construction of postroads, making canals of navigation, and maintaining the same, in any part of the US. in like manner as if the said acts were, totidem verbis past by the legislature of this commonwealth

HIE SOLEMN DECLARATION AND PRO  
TEST OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF  
VIRGINIA, ON THE PRINCIPLES OF  
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNIT­  
ED ST AIKS OF AMERICA, AND ON  
THE VIOLATIONS OF THEM.  
We, the G. neral Assembly of Virginia, on  
behalf, and in the name of the peop.e thereof.  
Ho declare as follows:  
The States in North America which confede­  
rated to establish their independence on I lie  
| g.►vermiient of (ire.it Britain, n! which Vngi  
1 nia was one, became, on that acquisition, live  
and independent States, and a- mkm, inuii.ui;:­  
ed to constitute government*, each for i self,  
in stub form as il thought best.  
They ent» red into a compact, (which is ca1­  
led I he constitution of the United Stales ol  
America,; by which they agreed to unite in a  
single government a? to their reunions wiili ,  
eaih othei, and with foreign nations, and as  
to certain other artichs pariit ala. ly specified.  
They retained at the same tune, each to itself,  
the oilier rights of independent government, .  
comprehending mainly tneir domestic inter  
ests  
For the administration of their federal branch I  
they ngieed to appoint, in conjunction, a dis j  
finer spt of functionaries, legislative, executive, j  
and i idiciary, in the manner settled in that I  
compact; while to each, severally and of  
con*se, remained its original right of appoint- 1  
ng, each for it seif, a separate s**t of fnnciinna­  
r e , legislative, ei c &#x27;live and judiciary, also,  
fo u ministering the d mestic bianch of their  
respective governments.  
These tw » set-* of officers, each independent  
of the other, coiisuiute thus a whole&#x27;ll govern- j  
inent, for each Slate separa ely ; the powers |  
ascribed to the one, as *pe«.ifiically made fed­  
eral, exercised over the whole, the residuary  
poweis, retained to the other, exercisable ex­  
clusively uvei its particular Stale, foreign  
herein, each to the others, ms they were before  
the original compact.  
To this onstruction of government and &lt;1 i* j  
irihutiou of its powers, the Commonwealth of ,  
Virginia doe* religi .usly and affectionately ad­  
here, opposing, with equal fidelity and firm  
ness, the usui pat ion of either set of functiona­  
ries on the rightful powers of the other.  
But the federal branch has assumed in some  
case*, and claimed in others, a right of enlarg­  
| ing iisowii powers by constructions, inferences  
and indefinite dedtic ions from those due -fly  
given, which this Assembly does declare m he  
usurpations of the powers retained ♦»* the inde­  
pendent branches, mere interpolations Hilo the  
compact, and direct infractions of it.  
T» ey claim, for example, and have com­  
menced the exercise of a right to construe!  
roads, open canals, and effect other internal  
improvements within the territories and juris­  
dictions exclusively belonging&#x27; In the several .  
States, which this Assembly does declare has .  
nut been given to that branch by the constitu­  
tional rouipnot, but remains t n each St.no a­  
inohg iu domestic and nnalienated powers, ex­  
ercisable within itself and by its domestic au  
turn ities alone.  
This Assembly does further disavow, and  
declare to be most false and unfounded, ihe  
doctrine that the compact, in authorising »!••* (  
federal branch to lay and collect taxes, duties,,  
imposts and exci-.es to pay the debts and pro- j  
vide lor the common defence anti general wel­  
fare of the United States, has given them  
thereby a power to do whatever they may  
think, or pretend, would promote the general  
well tic which construction would make that,  
of itself, a complete government, without  
limitation of powers ; but that the plain sense  
and obvious meaning was, that t&lt; ey might leyy  
the faxes necessary to provide for the general  
welfare, by the various acts of power therein  
specified altd delegated to them, and by no o- ^  
tilers.  
  
Por is il admitted, as lilts been into, ttiat tin  
people of these States, by not investing Ilnur  
federal branch wilh all the means ot bettering  
their condition, have denied to themselves any  
which may eff ci.Jhat purpose ; since, in lie ,  
distribution ol&#x27;lhese means, they have given to  
that branch those which belong to its depart-j  
liients and to the Slates liave teserved, separ  
ately, .he residue which belong lo III m separ ;  
alel). Anil thus by the organisation of the,  
two branches taken together, bare completely [  
secured the Is si object of human a,«o,.i allot, I  
«lie lull linprav&lt;*iii*&#x27;it **f their con  
and reserved to me.nselves a&#x27;l the faculties ot ,  
multiplying their own hleitinfrs.  
Whilst the General A^mbly thus declares;  
tha rights retained Uy me State, rignts which ■  
they iwyer have yielded, and wr.icli this Stale ,  
will never voluntarily yield, they do not mean,  
to raise the banner of disaff’Ction, or ol sepa­  
ration from tueir sister states, co-parn s with  
themselves to this compact. They know and  
value loo highly the blessingi ol their Union  
as to foreign nations amt iiuestions arising a -  
lining themselves, to consider every ml action  
as to Of u)**f hv actual re*i*laiice. rc  
spec! too affectionately the opinions of those  
possess ng the same rights under the same  
instrument, «o itiaKe every difference ol  
construction a ground of imm bate rupture.  
They would, indeed, consider such a ruptufe  
as among the greatest calamities which  
could befell them ; but not the greatest.  
There is yet one Stealer submission to  
a goverment of unlimited power*,  
is only when the Imp* of avoiding this shall  
  
bejrtfiufc aUulutely dlipirate, mst fuiii.fr  
forbearance could not be indulged. Should  
tin* iii ijiMiin s o| the co-part in therefore,  
contrary to the expiation and hope of this  
tto«&#x27;inWjf, prefer, at tint time, acquiescence  
in these assumption* of power by ilia federal  
member ot the government we will be patient  
and suffer much.under the confidence that time,  
ere it bo too late, will prove to them hIio the  
hotter consequences in which that usurpation  
will involve u» all. In the menu while we wdl  
breast with them raher than separate  
from them, every misfortune save Hint only  
ol living under a government of nil I mi dive  
powers. We owe every other sacrifice to  
ourselves, to our federal brediern, and to  
the world nt large, to pursue with temper and  
perseverance the great experiment which shall  
prove that man is capable of living in society,  
governing itself by laws self-imposed, and  
securing to H* in ‘tubers the etijovniatit of life,  
lilmriy, property and peace; and lorther to

to think, that the power ol making roads and  
canals should he added to tlmsn direcly given  
to the federal branch, as more likely to be

lion in Congress will hereafter be feeble and formal, un-&#x27;  
lo*s something can be done which may give a gleam j  
of encouragement to «ur friends, or alarm their op &#x27;  
poueuts in their fancied edent tty. I learn Irom Rich- [  
inond, that those who think with us there, ate in a  
state of perfect dismay, uot knowing what to do, or i  
what to propose. Mr. Gordon, our representative, I  
particularly, has written to me iu very desponding !

piutou* and advice on the subject. I have no doubt you  
are pressed in the same way, and J hope you have do­  
&#x27; ised aud recommended something to them. If you  
have, stop here and read no more, but consider all that  
follows as non-arenne. I shall be better satisfied to  
adopt implicitly any thing which you may have advis­  
ed, than any tiling occurring to myselt. For I have  
long ceased to think oil subjects of this kind, and pay  
littlo attention to public proceedings Rut if you have  
done nothing iu It, then I risk tor your consideration  
what lias occurred to me, am) is expressed iu the In  
closed paper Dailey’* propositions, which catne to  
hand much I wrote the paper, and which I suppose to  
liavo come Irom the President himself, shew a Utile he  
citation in the purposes of his party; and in that state of  
mind, a bolt shot critically may decide Die contest, by  
its effect on the les* bold. The olive branch lie d out to  
(hem at tins momout may be accepted, and the consti­  
tution thus saved at a moderate sacrifice. I say nothing  
of the paper, which will explain itself. The following  
heads of consideration, or some of them, may weigh in  
jts favor.  
it tnay intimidate the wavering. It may break the  
Western coalition by offering the same tiling in a differ­  
ent form. It will be viewed with favor iu contrast with  
the Georgia oppu.-ition and fear of strengthening that  
It will be an example ol a temperate mode of opposi­

and In no way place us in a worse than our prerent sit­

dovciopo them.  
&#x27;I ho question is, whether you approve of doing any  
tiling ol the kind, ff not, send it back to me, aud it  
shall be suppressed; for I would not hazard so important  
a meaauio against your opinion, nor even without it;  
support. I f you think it may l»e a canvass on which to  
put something good, make what alterations you please,

Til: JEFFERSON.  
The solemn declaration and protest of the Common’  
wealth of I&#x27;irginia, on the principles of the Consti­  
tution of the United Slates of America, and on the  
violations oj them­  
Wo, tlie General As.«*enibly of Virginia, on behalf  
and in the uaino of the people thereof, do declare a.*  
follows:  
The Slates in North America which confederated (o  
establish (heir independence no the government of Great  
Rritaln, of which Virginia was one, became, on that  
acquisition, free and independent States, and a* such,  
authorized to constitute government*, each for itself, in  
such form as it thought best.  
They entered into a compact, (which is called the  
&lt; otislituliun of the United States of America,) by which  
they agreed to unite in a single government as (o their  
i elation* with each other, and with foreign nations, and  
c* Co certain other article* particularly epreilied. They  
retained at the same lime, each to itself, the other right*  
ol independent government, compiol.ending mainly  
their domestic interests.  
For the administration of their federal branch, (hey 1  
agreed to appoint, in conjunction, a di*tinct *et of func­  
tionaries, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the  
manner settled in that compact: while to each, several­  
ly and of course, remained its original right of appoint­  
ing. each for itself, a separate set of functionaries, le­  
gislative, executive and judiciary, also, tor administer- 1  
i.«K the domestic branch of their respective govern- .  
tnent*. 1  
Them two sets of officeis, each independent of the i  
other, constitute thus a whole of government, for each i  
State separately; the power* ascribed to tbo oue, ns spe- I  
cificully made federal, exercised over the whole, the re­  
siduary powers, retained to the other, exercisable ex-11  
• lusively over its particular State, foreign herein, each  
to the others, as they were before the original compart  
To this construction of government and distribution ol  
j&#x27;* powers, the Commonwealth of Virginia does reli­  
vtously and affectionately adhere, opposing, with equal  
iidclity and firmness, the usurpation ol either act of  
functionaries on the rightful powers of the other.  
Rut (ho federal branch has assumed iu some cu«r«, f  
8tid claimed in others, a right of enlarging its own pow­  
er* by construction*, inference*, and indefinite deduc- 1  
lijos from those diiectly given, which (his A**rmhly 1  
d ie* declare to be usurpations of the power* retained to  
the independent branches, mere interpolations into the  
compact, and direct infractions of it.  
  
iney Claim, lor example, and have commenced (he  
oxercUe of a right to construct roads, open canals, and  
effect other internal improvements within the ten ito­  
lie* and jurisdictions exclusively belonging to the sev­  
eral States, which Oils Assembly does declare has not  
been given to that branch by the constitutional com­  
pact, but remains to each State among its domestic and  
nialienated powers, exercisable within itself nud by its  
domestic authorities ulouc.  
This Assembly does further disavow, and declare to  
bo must lahe and unfounded, the doctrine that the com­  
pact, in authorising its federal branch to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and  
prov ide for the common defence and gmieial welfare of  
iiia United States, has given them tiicrcby a power to  
do whatever they may think, or pretend, would promote  
the general welfare, which construction would make  
that, of itself, a complete government, without limitation  
of powers; but that the plain sense and obvious meaning  
was, that they might levy the taxes necessary to provide  
lar the general welfare, by the various acts of power  
therein specified end delegated to them, and by no oth­  
ers.  
iN&#x27;or Is It Admitted, as lia» been said, that the people of  
these States, by not investing their federal branch with  
oil the means of bettering their condition, have denied  
to themselves any which may effect that purpose; since, i  
in the distribution of these mean*, they have given to  
&#x27;.hat branch those which belong to its departments, and  
to the States have reserved, separately, the residue  
which belong to them separately. And thus, by the or­  
ganisation of the two branches taken together, have  
completely secured the first object of human associa­  
tion, the full improvement of tlmir condition, ami ro- I  
served to themselves all the faculties of multiplying  
their own blessings. &lt;  
Whilst the General Assembly thns declares the rights  
retained l.y the State, rights which they have yielded  
and which this State will never voluntarily yield, they  
do not mean to ral e the banner of disaffection, or of  
separation from their sister States,co-parlies with them­  
selves to (his compact- They know and value (oo high­  
ly the blessings of their Union as to foreign nations and  
questions arising among themselves, to consider r/c -v  
infraction to be met by actual resistance. They res­  
pect too affectionately the opinions of those possessing  
the same lights under the same instrument, to make  
every difTuronre of cons-ti uction a ground of iminediat­  
rupture. &#x27;J hoy would, indeed, consider such a rupture  
a* among the greatest calamities which coulJ belall  
(hem; but not the greatest. There is yet ono greater  
mbmiulon ton government of unlimited powers. It is  
only when the hope of avoiding (his shall become ab*o- ■  
lirtcly desperate, that further forbearance could not ho  
indulged. Should the majorities ol (ho co-partie-*, there­  
line, contraiy (o tho expectation and hope of this as  
fcmbly, prefer, at this time, acquiescence in these  
-M.-imiption* vt power by tho federal number of  
the government, we wifi bo patient and suffer much I  
under the confidence (hat Ume, ere it l-e too late, will !  
prove to (ham also the bitter consequences in which I  
that usurpation will involve us all. In the mean while,  
will Incus! with them rather than separate from  
them, every misfortune, save that only of living under a  
government of unlimited powers. We owe every oilier  
sacrifice to ourselves, to our federal brethren, and to  
the wotld at large, to pursue with temper ami perse­  
verance the great experiment which shall prove that]  
loan is capable of living in society, governing itself by i  
laws sell-imposed, and securing to it* members the on- |  
.toy incut of life, liberty, property and peace; further to!  
•rbow that, even wheu the government of its choice |  
Gull shew a tendency to degeneracy, wo are not at )  
ciiko to despair but that the will and the watchfulness)  
»flts sounder parts will reform it« aberrations, tncall It  
to original and legitimate piinriplos, and reslr in it with­  
in the rightful limits of self-government. And these  
arc the Objects o» (hi* Declaration e l Protest.  
Supposing then, that ,t might be for the good of Ihe  
whole, as some ol its ro State* seem to think, that tiir­  
potver ol rnskingroads and, canals, should be added to  
iliom directly given to Ihe federal branch, aa more like- I  
ly to he systematically and beneficially directed, than

MorJlceliu, JJerember 24, 1S2Z.  
—. have tbr some time considered fho  
question of Internal Improvement as desperate. The  
torrent of general opinion sets so strongly in favor of  
i; as to be irresistible. And I suppose the opposition I  
in Congress will hereafter be feeble and formal, un-!  
less something can he done which may give a gleam i  
o. encouragement to our friends, or alarm their op­  
ponents in their fancied security. I Jearn from Rich  
moud, that those who think with us there are in a  
state of perfect dismay, not knowing what to do, or I  
what to propose. Mr. Gordon our representative,  
particularly, has written to me in very despond mr’ ;  
terms, not disposed to yield indeed, but pressing fu“ I  
opiuions and advice on the subject. I Luve no doubt 1  
you are pressed in the same way, and I hope you I  
have devised and recommend, d somethin* to them &#x27;  
It you have, stop here and read no more, but consid- |  
crall that follows an r.j/i ar«Wf. 1 shall be better  
satisfied to adopt implicitly any thing which you!  
may have advised, than any thing occurring to myself ;  
For I have lung ceased to think on subjects of this!  
hind, and pay little attention to public proceedings.  
Hut it you have done nothing in it, then 1 ri«k for  
your consideration what has occurred to me, and is  
ex pi eased in the endued paper. Bailev’s propositions 1  
which came to hand since I wrote the paper, and !  
which I suppose to have come from the I’res;dent !  
bimseif, shew a little hesitation m tim purposes of  
ins party; and in that state of mind, a bolt shot criti­  
cally may decide the contest, by its effect on the  
least bold. 1 ne olive branch held to them at this  
moment may be accepted, and the constitution thus  
£aved at a moderate sacrifice. I ray nothing of the  
f.nper. which will explain itself. The following heads  
of consideration, or some of them, may wei*h in its  
favor. *  
  
»v .way mimnunn: on- wavunnjr. 11 may Urcm; ttlC  
western coalition by olluring the* same thing in a dif­  
ferent form—It will be* viewed with favor in contrast  
with the Georgia opposition and fear of strengthen­  
ing l but. It will be an example of a temperate mode  
of opposition in future nod similar eases. It will ruve  
it:» the chance of better tunes and of intervening ^ac­  
cidents; and in no way place us in a w_,rse than our  
present situation. I do not dwell on these topics;  
your mind will devclope them.  
The first question is, whet Iter you approve of do­  
ing any thing of the kind. If not, send it back to  
me, and it shall be suppressed; for I would not hazard  
so important a measure against your opinion, nor  
oven without its support. If you think it may he a I  
canvass on which to put something good, make what  
oltci ations you please, and I will forward it to Gor­  
don, under the most sacred injunctions that it shall  
•bu so used as that not a shadow of suspicion shall  
fall on you or myself, that it has come from either of  
ns.—But what you do. do as prnmpt/y ns your ron- j  
vcnionce will admit, lest it should bo anticipated by •  
something worse. J

Til* JEFFERSON.  
Tha solemn declaration and protest of the common-1  
wraith of Virginia, on the principles of the Cou i  
Htilution of the United States of America md on  
the violation of them.  
Wo. the General Assembly of Virginia, on behalf,  
* and in the name of the people thereof, do declurc a^ :  
follow*:  
The states in North America which confederated  
to establish their independence of tho government of  
Grant Britain, of which Virginia was our, became, on  
that acquisition, free and independent states, and asi  
such, authorised to constitute governments, each for j  
itself, in such form os it tho’t best.  
They entered into a compact (which is Called the&#x27;  
constitution of the U. Stales of America) by which  
they agreed to unite in a single government mm to  
their relations with each other, and with foreign na­  
tions, and as to certain other article/* particularly  
specified. They retained at the same time, each to  
iteelf, the other rights of independent government,  
comprehending mainly their domestic interests.  
For the admimstrftf kia of their federal branch, they  
agreed to appoint, in conjunction, s distinct set of  
functionaries, Ir/riMl&#x27;/five, executive and judiciary, in  
tho manner settled in that compact: while to each  
severally and of courso, re mained its original right of  
appointing each for itself, s separate set of fuctiona­  
rles, legislative, ekecutive and judiciary, also, for  
administering the domestic branch of their respective  
governments.  
These twe arts of officers, each independent of  
the other, Constituto thus the wWc government, for  
^ach’state t**an&#x27;cfy; the por*** r. &gt; riK..^ f&lt;)  
  
•s speeiticsiiy muUg icd.-rui, cxe/uaod over tho whuiC,  
the rcaiduary |*owora, retained to tbe|otherat exercia­  
«wb»o exebi-mdy over ita particular atatc, foreign  
Iwrem, creh to the other?, atf they were before the  
original compact.  
To this construction of government and diatribu­  
linn of its powers, the coininonwthltlt «*f Virginia  
does religiously and affectionately adliere, opposing&#x27;,  
wiln equal fidelity and firiiinrn, the usurpation of  
cithor set of lunciii&gt;ua&lt;ics ou the rightful powers ol  
the other.  
But the federal branch lias assumed in aotne cases,  
and claimed lu others, n right of enlarging its own  
powers by construct unis, inluumcce, and indefinite

sembly duos declare to l»c usurpations of the powers  
retained to tho independent brandies, more interpola­  
tions, into flic compact, uml direct infractions of it.  
They claim for example and havo commenced the  
exorcise of a right to construct roads, open canals,  
and effect other internal improvements, within the  
&gt;crritori&lt; o and juiisdiclious exclusively belonging to  
the several states, which this Assembly docs declare  
lias not been given to that by the constitutional com­  
pact, but remains to each state among its domestic  
and unalicnatcd powers, exerciser!blc within itsell  
and by its domestic authorities alone.  
This Assembly does fur* her disavow, and declare  
to bo tlio most false and unfounded, the doctrine, tint  
the compact, in authorizing its federal brunch to lu)  
and collect taxes, duties, imposts and exercises to pay  
the debts and provide for the common defence mid «re”  
tirunl wcllaro ol the United States, has given their  
thereby a power to do whatever they may think, 01  
pretend, would promote the general welfare; whtcli  
construction would make that, of itself, a complete  
government, without limitation of power; but that the  
; plain sense and obvious moaning was, that they rn:.-*hl  
• lovy the taxes necessary to provide for the general  
j wed are. by the various acts of power therein speed!  
•cd and delegated to them, and by no others.  
• Nor is it adudttsj. ns bus been said, that the people  
,(|P*,? Uates by nor investing their federal brnncli  
; &quot; rneiins ol betturing tlioir condition, huve  
denied to themselvca any which may effect that pur­  
ikjsc; since, in the distribution of these means, thty  
• iave given to that branch those which belong to its  
t departments, and to the State? have reserved, separ­  
ately. the residue which belong to them separately.  
And thus by the organ,zalion of tho two b,anclics  
!la*eu t°scther, have completely secured the first ob­  
j&#x27; ct of human association, t»ie full improvement o!  
(their condition, and r.-s*«rvid to themselves all the  
factious of multiplying their own blessings.  
I Whilst the General Assembly thus declares the  
rights retained by the State, rigid* which »&lt;Vy  
never vieJd**d. end wfc:~h this state wifi never vol­  
untarily yield, they do nor mean m raise tint banner  
of disaffection, or of s^paratimi fn,m their si-&gt;ur  
states, co parties with tliem-elvcs to fins compact.  
‘ **!*y klMW •&#x27;»•* va,ue too highly tho blessings of  
thear union us to foreign nations aud questions arising1  
among llwtiuclvw, to consider every infraction as to I

sjrriti&#x27;.r, f!!i&gt;!n&lt;k,iio to ii fii.eriiiiK&#x27;nt of unlimited  
I powers. It is only when the hope of avoidin&#x27; this1  
! shall become absolutely desperate, that flirt her fur-’  
i bears lice con Id not be indulged. Should the major­  
tties o. the co parties therefore, contrary to the ex­  
pectation miiu hope of this assembly, prefer, at this  
ncc iu t;i--e assumptions of power hy  
the feueral member o/ the government, we will be  
patient and suffer much, ere it be too late, will prove  
to them also the bitter cbnsi-rjriom «•$ in wiiich thut  
usurpation will involve us all. In the mean while we  
will breast with rather than separate from them,eve­  
ry misfortune save that only of living under a govern­  
ment of unlimited powers. Wc owe evorv other  
sacrifice to ourselves, to our federal brethren&#x27;and to ,  
the world at large, to pursue with temper and perse-&#x27; i  
verancc the great experiment which shall prove that! i  
man s capable of living in society, governing itself  
by laws self nnpoved and securing to its tncinbers  
the enjoyment of life, liberty, property’ and peace;  
turther to show licit, even when the government of  
its choice shall shew a tendency to degeneracy, we  
nre not at once to despair, but that the will and watch­  
fulness of its soundest part* w.)l reform its aberra­  
tions, recyll it to original end legitimate principles,  
and restrain it within the righful limits of self gov­  
ernment. And these are the objects of this declara­  
tion and protest.  
Supposing then that it might be for the good of  
the whole, as some of its co Spates seem to think, l  
that the power of making road* and camls should be i  
added to those directly given to the feueral branch as :  
more likely to be hy»tematica ly anti beneficially di- i  
rected,than by the independent action of the several  
States, this commonwealth from respect to these  
i opinions, and a desire ot conciliation with its co­

XJs:an. Sir.—I have for some time considered the  
question of Internal Improvement as desperate. The  
torrent of general opinion acts so strongly in favor of  
it as to be irresistible. And l suppose the opposition  
in Congress will hereafter be feeble and formal, un­  
less something can be done which miy give a elcatn  
of encouragement to our friends, or alarm their on  
ponents in their fancied security. I learn from Rich­  
mond, that those who think with us there are in a  
state of perfect dismay, not knowing what to do. or  
what to propose. Mr. Gordon our representative,  
particularly, lias written to me in very desponding  
terms,.not disposed to yield indeed, but pressing fir  
opinions and advice on the subject. I have no doubt  
you are pressed in the same way, and I hope you !  
have devised uud recommended something to them :  
If you have, atop here and read no more, but consul- !  
crall that follows as nan avenue. I shall be better  
satisfied to adopt implicitly any thing which you  
may have udvised, than any thing occurring to mv* If.  
ISr I have ior-.g ceused to think on subjects of this  
kind, and pay little attention to public proceeding.?,  
lint if you have done nothing in it, then 1 ri&amp;k fur  
your consideration what has occurred to me, and is  
expscssedin the enclosed paper. Bailey’s propositions  
which came to hand since I wrote Ihe paper, and  
which 1 suppose to have come from the President  
himself, shew a little hesitation in the purposes of  
his part}&#x27;; and in that stale of mind, a bolt shot criti­  
cally may decide the contest, bv its effect on the  
least bold. The olive branch held to them at this  
moment may be accepted, and the constitution thus  
aiivcd ala moderate sv;;l;ce. 1 ssy nothing of the  
paper, w inch will explain itself. &#x27;I he following heads  
11 i consideration, or sonic of them, may wei°li in its  
favor.  
It may intimidate the wavering. It may break the  
western coalition by offering the same thing in a dif­  
ferent form.—It will be viewed with favor iii contrast  
with the Georgia opposition and fear of strengthen­  
ing that. It will be un example of a temperate mode  
of opposition in future and similar cases. It will give  
t&lt;s the chance of better times and of intervening ac­  
cidents; and in no way place us in a worse than om  
present situation. I do not dwell o:i these le; ics;  
your mind wilkdfivelope them.  
The first question is, whether you approve of do­  
ing any thing of the kind. If not, send it back to  
me, audit shall be suppressed; for 1 would not hazard  
so important a measure against your opinion, nor  
even without its support. If you think it may be u  
canvass on which to put something good, make what  
fiHet ations you please,and I will forward it to Gor­  
don, under the most sacred injunctions that ii shall  
be so used as that not a shadow of suspicion shall  
fall on you or myself, that it has c&lt;v,io from either of  
us.— But what you do, do as promptly as vour con­  
venience will admit, lest it should be anticipated bv  
t&gt; u.clhing worse;  
Ever and afiectionafolv yours.  
Tils JEFFERSON.  
  
:I lie so.c •»».! declaration an 1 protest of too common- j  
wealth of Virginia, on il.e principles of the Con- j  
stitutiou of tin; United States of Amenta am] on I  
tnc violation of them.  
We, the General Assembly of Virginia, on behalf  
and in the name of the people thereof, do denure a.- &#x27;  
ioliows:  
The states in North America which confederated&#x27;  
tv&gt; Cotaldish their independence of the government of!  
Great Britain, bf winch Virginia was one, became, on  
that acquisition, free and independent states, and as!  
such, authorised to constitute governments, each for  
itself, in such form ns it tho&#x27;t best.  
They entered iuio a Compact (which is called the  
constitution of the U. States of America) bv which  
they agreed to unite in a single government as to  
their relations wi»h other, nnd with foreign i.a- 1  
lions, and an to rmtui.i oilier articles particularly!  
specified. They retained at the same time, each to /  
itself, the other rights of independent government, ,  
comprehending mainly their domestic interests.  
Pur the administration of their federal branch, they  
agreed to appoint, in conjunction, a distinct set of  
functionaries, legislative, executive and judiciary, in ’  
the Mia tnior settled in that compact: while to each!  
severally and of course, remained its original right of  
u pointing, each for itself, a separate scfof fnctiona- 1  
nes, legij-lali.-e. executive and judiciary, alsj, fur&#x27;  
administering the dertn «tic brum.! ,f then :. -,!_•••;i&gt;.  
governments.  
These two sets of officers, each m.&#x27;mp.m.len of  
the other, constitute thus the whole goverinmT.t, ft,? .  
each state separably: the powers ascribed to :1m one,  
f*&gt;JCifi‘T5l?lv&#x27;tT!Sd9 fjd ’&quot;al c &#x27;C? •yv&#x27;e2

the residuary powers, retained to the^otners vxerois­  
suhlo exclusively over its particular slate, foreign  
herein, each to the others, us they were before the&#x27;  
| original compact.  
To this construction of government uml distribu­  
tion of its powers, the -commonwealth of Virginia  
• does religiously and affectionately adhere, opposing,  
: with equal fidelity and firmness, the usurpation ofj  
j (dther set of fuiicliona ics on the rightful powers ofi  
, the other.  
! Hat the federal branch lias assumed in some cases,:  
•and claimed in others, a right of enlarging its own I  
: • w ots by construct icm, 1 ueiences, and iiidefiniic |  
deduc; ions tiom those directiv given, which this *,&lt; j  
■ semldy does declare to be tmurputicus oi‘ the powi r.- j  
• retained to the independent branches, mere iuterpela- i  
i lion., into the compact, and direct infractions 01 it. [  
| They claim for example and have commenced the |  
• xercise «,f a right to construct roads, open canals, I  
and effect other internal improvements, within the-i  
1 territories and jurisdictions exclusively belonging to 1  
ti.e several states, which this Assembly d ies declare &#x27;  
. has uoi been given to that by the cunsiituiionul com- .  
pact, but remains to each state among its domestic j  
.and unalicnalcd powers, exerciseablc within itself  
j and by its domestic authorities alone,  
j &#x27;I.his Assembly does further disavow, ami declare  
j to be the most He. e and unfounded, the doctrine, that j  
iilie compact, in authorizing i‘s federal branch to lay  
j and collect taxes, duties, imposts and exercises to pay ;  
i the de’uls and provide for the common defence and ge- j  
j uera! welfare of the United States, has given them I  
I thereby a power to do whatever they may think, or ;  
I pretend, would promote the general welfare; which  
e.instruction would make ihat^of itself, a complete  
j government, w ilhout limitation of power; but tiiul the  
i plain sense and obvious meaning was, that they might  
j levy the taxes uecesstiry to provide for the general  
j welfare, by the various acts of power therein spccili  
J fed and delegated to them, and by m&gt; others.  
; ’. &gt;r is it admitted, ns has been said. that the people ,  
I of these states by nut investing their federal branch J  
; vviili ai! the means of bettering their condition, have  
, denied to tiieniselves any winch may effect that pur*

have given tu tint branch tlie.-.e which belong to its  
• depaiiui nts, and to the Stales have reserved, sopur­  
jatefy. the residue which belong to them senurutelv.  
And thus by the organization of the two hiuuches

PROTEST.  
The solemn declaration, and -protest  
of the Commonwealth of Virginia,  
on the principles of the Constitu­  
tion cf the United States of Slmc­  
rica, and. on the violations of them.  
WE, the General Assembly of Virgi­  
nia, on behalf, awl in tho name nf the  
  
people thereof, do declare as follows:  
The States in North America which  
confederated to establish their indepen­  
dence on the government of Great Bri­  
tain, of which Virginia was one, he­  
came, on that acquisition, free and inde­  
pendent States, and as such, authorized  
to constitute governments, each for it­  
self, in such form as it thought best.  
They entered into a compact, (which  
is called the Constitution cf the United  
States of America) by which they agreed  
to unite in a single government as to  
irheir relations with each other, and with  
foreign nations, and as to certain other  
articles paiticularly specified. Thev re­  
tained at the same time, each to itself,  
the other rights of independent govern­  
ment, comprehending mainly their do­  
mestic interests.  
For the administration tf their fede­  
ral branch, they agreed to appoint, in  
conjunction, a distinct set of functiona­  
ries, legislative, executive, and judicia­  
ry, in the manier settled in that coin-  
  
pact; while to each, severally and of  
  
course, remained its original right of  
appointing, each for itself, a separate set  
of functionaries, legislative, executive,  
and judiciary, also, for administering  
  
the domestic branch of their respective  
  
V prnmpnlc  
  
Uchoh of government, for each State se  
  
parately; the powers ascnoeu to me u)  
as specifically made federal, exercised  
over the whole, the residuary powers,  
retained to the other, exercisable exclu­  
sively over its particular State, foreign  
herein, each to the others, as they were  
before the original compact.  
To this construction of government  
and distribution of its powers, the Com  
  
monwealth of Virginia does religiously  
and affectionately adhere, opposing, with  
equal fidelity and firmness, the usurpa­  
tion of either set of functionaries cn the  
rightful powers of the other.  
&quot;Hut the federal branch has assumed in  
some eases, and elaimed in others, a  
right of enlarging its own powers by  
constructions, inferences, and indefinite  
deductions from those directly given,  
which this Assembly does declare to be  
usurpations of the powers retained to the  
independent branches, mere interpola­  
tions into the compact, and direct in­  
fractions of it.  
They claim, for example, and have  
commenced the exercise of a right to  
construct roads, open canals, and effect  
other internal improvements within the  
  
territories and jurisdictions exclusively  
  
belonging to the several States, which  
this Assembly does declare has not been  
given to that branch by the constitu­  
tional compact, but remains to each  
State among its domestic and unaliena­  
ted powers, exercisable within itself and  
by its domestic authorities alone.  
This Assembly docs further disavow,  
and declare to be most false and unfoun­  
ded, the doctrine that the compact, in  
authorising its federal branch to lay and  
collect taxes, duties, imposts and exci­  
ses, to pay the debts and provide for the  
  
common defence and general welfare of  
  
the United States, has given &#x27;hem there­

think, or pretend, would promote the

government, without limitation of pow  
  
ers; but that the plain sense and obvious  
meaning was, that they might levy the  
taxes necessary to provide for thi: gene­  
ral welfare, by the various acts of power  
therein specified and delegated to them,  
and by no others.  
Nor is it admitted, as has been said,  
that the people of these Slates, by not  
investing their federal branch with all  
the means of bettering their condition,  
have denied to themselves any which  
may effect that purpose; since, in the  
distribution of these means, they have  
given to that branch those which belong  
io its departments, and to the States  
have reserved, separately, the residue  
which belong to them separately. And  
thus, by the organization of the two  
branches taken together, have complete­  
ly secured the first object of human as­  
sociation, thp full improvement of their  
condition, and reserved to themselves  
all the faculties of multiplying their own  
  
blessings.  
Whilst the General Assembly thus  
declares the rights retained by the State,  
rights which they have never yielded &amp;  
which this State will never voluntarily  
yield, they do not mean to raise the  
banner of disaffection, or of separation  
from their sister Stales, co-parties with  
themselves to this compact. They know  
  
aim vaiue too Highly tne blessings of  
  
their Union as to foreign nations and  
questions arising among themselves, to  
consider every infraetion to be met by­  
actual resistance. They respect too  
affectionately the opinions of those pos­  
sessing the same rights under the same  
instrument, to make every difference of  
  
construction a ground of immediate nm-  
  
ture. Thev would, i nrtrmt ,-...:..

such a rupture as among the greatest ca­  
lamities which could befall them- but  
not the greatest. There is yet one  
greater submission to a government of  
unlimited powers. It is only when the  
hope of avoiding this shall become ab­  
solutely desperate, that further forbear­  
ance could not be indulged. Should the  
majorities of the co-parties, therefore  
contrary to the expectation and&quot; hone of  
this Assembly, prefer, at this time, ac­  
quiescence in these assumptions of pow­  
er by the federal member of the-overn-menj,  
we will be patient and suffer  
much linrlfr flio -.P..i .i .

The solemn declaration and protest of the commonwealth,  
of Virginia, on the principles of the constitution of the  
nited States of America, and on the violation of them.  
We, the general assembly of Virginia, on behalf, in the  
name of the people thereof, do declare as follows:  
  
The states in North Awerica which confederated to  
establish their independence on the government of Great  
Britain, of which Virginia was one, became, on that ac-  
  
uisition, free and independent states, and ag such, an-  
  
orised to constitute governments, each for itself, in such  
form as it thought best.  
  
They entered into a compact, (which is called the con-  
stitution of the United States of America, ) by which they

executive and judiciary, also for administering the do-

These two sets of officers, each independent of the

over its particular state, foreign her: in, each to the others,

To this construction of government and distribution of

remains to cach state among its domestic and unalienat-  
ed powers, exercisable withm itself and by its domestic  
authorities alone.  
  
This assembly does further disavow, and declare to  
be most false and unfounded, tie doctrine that the com-  
pact, in authorizing its federal branch to lay and collect  
taxes, duties, imports and excises to pay the debts and  
provide for the common detence and general welfare of  
ihe United States, has given them thereby a power to do  
whatever they may think, or pretend, would promote  
the general welfare, which construction would make  
that, of itself, « complete government, without limitations  
of powers; but that the plain sense and obvious meaning  
was, that they might levy taxes necessary to provide for the  
genera! welfare, by the various acts of power therein  
specified and delegated to them, and by no others,  
  
Nor is it admitted, as has been said, that the people of  
these states, by not investing their federal branch with  
all the means of bettering their condition, have denied to  
themselves any which may effect that purpose; since in  
the distribution of these means, they have given to that  
branch those which belong io its department and to the  
states have rcserved, separaiely, the residue which be-  
longs to them separately. And thus by the organiza-  
tion of the two branches taken together, lave complete-  
ly secured the first object of human assocnmtion, the lull  
improvement of their condition, and reserved to them-  
selves all the faculties of multiplying their own blessings.

since. &gt;  
The opinion of Mr. Jefferson of the right and  
duty of the States to separate rather than submit  
to usurpations of the federal government,  
which would make it a government ofunlimll  
cd powers,&quot; may be further seen from his resolutions  
enclosed to Mr. MadisOn, to be submitted  
to the Virginia legislature, in 1824, when the  
question oi the powers of the State And general  
governments were again under tjonsideralion as  
in 1799. He says:  
&quot;They (the assembly of Virginia] would, indeed,  
consider such a rupture as among the  
1 greatest calamaties which could befall tbtm, but  
} not the greatest. Tnere is yet one greater?  
submission to a government of unlimited p &gt;wj  
era. It is only when the hope of avoiding this  
I shall become absolutely desperate that further  
forbearance could be indulged. Should a majority  
of the co-parties, therefore, contrary to the  
&#x27; expectation and hope of this assembly, prefer  
; si this time acquiescence in these assumptions  
of power by the federal member of the government,  
wc will be patient and suffer much, under  
the confidence that time, ere it be too late, will  
prove to them also the bitter consequences in  
which that usurpation will involve us all. In  
j the mean, while we will breast with them, rather  
] than separate from them,every misfortune, save  
; that only of living under a government of unj  
limited powers.
