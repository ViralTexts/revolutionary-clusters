As evidence of the unaffected humility of Dr. Andrews,  
and also to show how strong to the last was his faith in the  
favorite truth, of which he was never weary of hearing or  
speaking —the reunion in a future world of those most  
dear in this, we may mention the fact, that he left written  
directions to have his funeral conducted with the greatest  
simplicity, and also an inscription for his grave-stone. This  
inscription, after giving his name and the usual dates, con-  
cluded thus : —  
  
“He cherished the fond hope, of meeting in the heavenly  
world the beloved friends who had gone before him.  
  
There thy bright train, immortal friendship, soar,  
No more to part, to mingle tears no more.
