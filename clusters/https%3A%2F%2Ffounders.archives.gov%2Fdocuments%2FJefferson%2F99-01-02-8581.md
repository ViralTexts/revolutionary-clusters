ime to the belligerent nations to revise a conduct as contrary to their interests as it is to our rights.  
‘In the event of such peace, or suspension of hostilities between the belligerent powers of Europe, or of such change in their measures affecting neutral commerce as may render that of the US. sufficiently safe in the judgment of the President’ he is authorised to suspend the embargo. but no peace or suspension of hostilities, no change of measures affecting neutral commerce, is known to have taken place. the orders of England, &amp; the decrees of France &amp; Spain, existing at the date of these laws, are still unrepealed, as far as we know. in Spain indeed a contest for the government appears to have arisen; but of it’s course or prospects we have no information on which prudence would undertake a hasty change in our policy even were the authority of the Executive competent to such a decision.  
You desire that, in this defect of power, Congress may be specially convened. it is unnecessary to examine the evidence or the character of the facts which are supposed to dictate such a call: because you will be sensible, on an attention to dates, that the legal period of their meeting is as early as, in this extensive country, they could be fully convened, by a special call.  
I should, with great willingness, have executed the wishes of the inhabitants of {Newbury port, the town of Boston, Providence} had peace, or a repeal of the obnoxious edicts, or other changes, produced the case in which alone the laws have given me that authority: and so many motives of justice &amp; interest lead to such changes, that we ought continually to expect them. but while these edicts remain, the legislature alone can prescribe the course to be pursued.
