there is no express grant of power in the Consti-  
tution to incorporate a United States bank. The  
  
| power to create a bank is ineidental to the powers  
  
expressly granted. The national bank proposed  
may be considered an appropriate means to carry

Government. By its provisions it has a direct re-

lecting taxes, internal duties, and excises; to that  
of borrowing money, to that of regulating com-  
merce between the States, and to that of raising  
money to maintain the Army and Navy. It would,  
no doubt, be a useful instrument in administer-  
ing the fiscal and financial operations of the Gov-

useful support to the credit of the Government, by
