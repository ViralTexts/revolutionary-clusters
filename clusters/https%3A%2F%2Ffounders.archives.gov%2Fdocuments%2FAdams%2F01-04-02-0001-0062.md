After dinner We went to the Accademy of Sciences, and heard Mr. D’Alembert as Secretary perpetual, pronounce Eulogies on several of their Members lately deceased. Voltaire and Franklin were both present, and there presently arose a general Cry that Monsieur Voltaire and Monsieur Franklin should be introduced to each other.

They shook hands. Even this was not  
enough. At length the words of the clam-  
our were distinguished : ‘ I/ faut s’embras-  
ser, @ la Francoise” ‘You must embrace,  
French fashion.’ Then, says John Adams,  
who witnessed the spectacle, ‘ the two aged  
actors upon this great theatre of philosophy  
and frivolity embraced each other by hug-  
ging one another in their arms, and kissing  
each other’s cheeks; and then the tumult  
subsided.’ Another month, and Voltaire  
lay dead.  
  
The tone of the English government was  
now changing. Secret emissaries were sent  
to Paris to sound Franklin on the subject  
of the French alliance, and to learn on  
what terms, short of tmdependence, he was  
authorized to treat for peace. Their mis-

was present. Presently there arose a general  
cry that M. Voltaire and M. Franklin should be  
introduced. They rose and bowed. This would  
not do; the company, let us suppose, somewhat  
gone in champagne. They arose and took each  
other by the hand; but this would not do, and the  
puzzled philosopher could not divine the mean-­

out cried, &quot;Il faut s&#x27;embrasser a la francaise,&quot; or.  
in other words, that they should embrace in  
French fashion. Whereupon the &quot;two aged
