Dear Sir.  
Quincy February 6th 1816  
  
I have received your kind Letter of the 23d of January and I thank you for the Pamphlets enclosed with it.  
It is very true, as my excellent Friend Mr Norton has informed you that I have read many of your Publications with pleasure.  
I have also read, almost all the days of my life, the solemn Reasonings and pathetic Declamations of Erasmus, of Fenelon, of St Pierre and many others against War, and in favour of Peace, My Understanding and my heart accorded with them at first blush. But Alass! a longer and more extensive Experience has convinced me that Wars, are as necessary and as inevitable, in our System as Hurricanes, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes.  
Our beloved Country, Sir, is Surrounded by Enemies of the most dangerous, because the most powerfull and most unprincipled Characters. Collisions of National Interests, of Commercial and manufacturing. Rivalries are multiplying around Us, Instead of discouraging a Martial Spirit, in my opinion it ought to be excited. We have not enough of it to defend Us by Sea or Land.  
Universal and perpetual Peace, appears to me, no more nor less, than everlasting Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance, The human Flock would soon be fleeced and butchered by One or a few.  
I cannot therefore Sir, be a Subscriber or a Member of your Society—  
I do, Sir, most humbly Supplicate, The Theologians, The Phylosophers and The Politicians, to let me die in Peace, I seek only repose.  
With the most cordial Esteem, however I am, / Sir your Friend and Servant  
  
John Adams.

Dzan Sin&lt;el have received your kind  
letter of the 23d of January, and I thank you  
for the pamphleis enclosed with it.  
Tt is very true, as my exccllent friend, Mr.  
Norton, has informed you, that I bave read  
many of your publications with pleasure.  
1 have also, read, almost all the days of  
my life, the selemn reasonings and pathetic  
declamations of Lirasmus, of Fenelon, of St.  
Pierre, and many others against war, and in  
favor of pcace. DMy understanding and my  
teart, accord with them, at first blush,  
Bot, alas ! a longer and more extensive ex­  
petience has convinced me, that wars ace as  
necessory and as-inevitabie, in our system, as  
burricanes, earthquakes and volcanaes.  
Our beloved country, sir, is surrounded by  
enemies, of the most dangerous, because the  
most powerful and most unprincipled char­  
acter. Collissions of national inicrest, of  
commercial and manufacturing rivairies, are  
moltiplying around us. Instead of discour­  
giog a martial spirit, in my vpinion, it enght  
1o be exeited. We have not enough of it to  
defend us by sea or land.  
Universal and perpetual peace sppears to  
me, no more nor lgss than everlasting passive  
obedience, and non-resistance. T&#x27;he human  
flock would soon be fleeced and butchared by  
one or a few,  
  
I cannot, therefore, sir, be a subscriber or  
a member of your society.  
I do, siry most humbly supplicate the olo­  
gians the philosophers, and the polilicians, to  
let me die io peace. [ seek only reposec.  
  
With the most cordial esteem, however,  
1 am, sir, your friend and servant,

acter after this life, attended by wretchedness, he, who can  
, fathom eternity, can calculate the evil of war.  
  
But, admitting that war is a great and incalculable evil,  
there are those, who consider it as unavoidable and necessary,  
and therefore will make no efforts to resist the inevitable  
doom of our species. An illustrious man, the second presi-  
dent of our country, has said this—that experience had con-  
vinced him, ‘‘ that wars are necessary, and as inevitable in  
our system, as hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanoes.
