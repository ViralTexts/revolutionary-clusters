rom Congress the Governor and council have it in contemplation to remove the Convention troops either wholly or in part from their present situation, I take the liberty of troubling you with some observations on that subject. The reputation and interests of our country in general may be affected by such a measure. It would therefore hardly be deemed an indecent liberty in the most private citizen to offer his thoughts to the consideration of the executive. The locality of my situation particularly in the neighborhood of the present barracks and the public relation in which I stand with the people among whom they are situated, together with a confidence which a personal knowlege of the members of the executive gives me, that they will be glad of information from any quarter on a subject interesting to the public, i

I am mistaken if for the animal subsistence of the troops hitherto we are not principally indebted to the genius and exertions of Hawkins during the very short time he lived after his appointment to that department by your board. His eye immediately pervaded the whole state, it was reduced at once to a regular machine, to a system, and the whole put into movement and animation by the fiat of a comprehensive mind

occupy the top and brow of a very high hill (you have been untruly told they were in a bottom). They are free from fog, have four springs which seem to be plentiful, one within 20 yds. of the picket, 2 within 50 yards, and another within 250 and they propose to sink wells within the picquet. Of  4000 people it should be expected according to the ordinary calculations that one should die every day. Yet in the space of near 3 months there have been but 4 deaths among them. 2 infants under three weeks old, two others by apoplexy. The officers tell me, the troops were never before so healthy since they were embodied.  
But is an enemy so execrable that tho in captivity his wishes and comforts are to be disregarded and even crossed? I think not. It is for the benefit of mankind to mitigate the horrors of war as much as possible. The practice therefore of modern nations of treating captive enemies with politeness and generosity is not only delightful in contemplation but really interesting to all the world, friends foes and neutrals.

Judge what an extent of ground these seeds would cover. There is little doubt that their own gardens will furnish them a great abundance of vegetables through the year. Their poultry, pigeons and other preparations of that kind present to the mind an idea of a company of farmers rather than of a camp of soldiers. In addition to the barracks built for them by the publick and now very comfortable they have built great numbers for themselves in such messes as fancied each other: and the whole corps both officers  and men seem now happy and satisfied with their situation.

 conclude. The separation of these troops would be a breach of public faith, therefore I suppose it impossible. If they are removed to another state, it is the fault of the commissaries; if they are removed to any other part of the state it is the fault of the commissaries; and in both cases, the public interest and public security suffer, the comfortable and plentiful subsistence of our own army is lessened, the health of the troops neglected, their wishes crossed and their comforts torn from them, the character of whim and caprice or, what is worse, of cruelty fixed on us as a nation, and to crown the whole our own people disgusted with such a proceeding.  
I have thus taken the liberty of representing to you the facts and the reasons which seem to militate against the separation
