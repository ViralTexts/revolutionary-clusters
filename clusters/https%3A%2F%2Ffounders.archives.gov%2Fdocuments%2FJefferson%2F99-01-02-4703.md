Sir,  
New Orleans, December 18, 1806.  
  
Since my last of the 14th inst. writs of habeas corpus have issued for the bodies of Bollman, Swartwout and  
Ogden: the two latter by judge Workman, who is strongly suspected of being connected with Burr in this conspiracy. I have  
proof this man declared some time since, that “the republican who possessed power, and did not employ it to establish a  
despotism, was a fool.” His writ for Ogden was served on captain Shaw, of the navy, who had him in charge at my request,  
on board the Etna bomb ketch, and delivered him up: and Mr. Workman discharged him without giving me a word of  
information, although he knew he was confined by my order, for a treasonable combination with Burr; and Mr. Ogden now  
struts at large. Swartwout I have sent off, and shall so report, holding myself ready for consequences. Bollman was  
required by the superior court, but I got rid of that affair also, under the usual liability for damages, in which I shall

After repeated experiments, I can say positively, I have nothing to expect from the civil authority, which does not depend on the broad letter and tardy course of the law; and, in the mean time, treason stalks abr
