of the treaty of commerce. The President manifestly inclined to the appeal to the people. He said that Mr. Morris, taking a family dinner with him the other day went largely and of his own accord into this subject, advised this appeal and promised if the Presidt. adopted it that he would support it himself, and engage for all his connections.—The Presidt. repeated this twice, and with an air of importance.—Now Mr. Morris has no family connections. He engaged then for his political friends.—This shews that the President has not confidence enough in the virtue and good sense of mankind to confide in a government [bottomed on] them, and thinks other props necessary. Knox in a foolish incoherent sort of a speech introduced the Pasquinade lately printed, called the funeral of George W—n and James W—n, king and judge &amp;c. where the President was placed on a Guillotin. The Presidt. was much inflamed, got into one of those passions when he cannot command himself. Run on much on the personal abuse which had been bestowed on him. Defied any man on earth to produce one single act of his since he had been in the government which was not done on the purest motives.  That he had never repented but once the having slipped the moment of resigning his office, and that was every moment since. That by god he had rather be in his grave than in his present situation. That he had rather be on his farm than to be made emperor of the world and yet that they were charging him with wanting to be a king. That that rascal Freneau sent him 3. of his papers every day, as if he thought he would become the distributor of his papers, that he could see in this nothing but an impudent design to insult him. He ended in this high tone. There was a pause. Some difficulty in resuming our question—it was however after a little while presented again, and he said there seemed to be no necessity for deciding it now: the propositions before agreed on might be put into a train of execution, and perhaps events would shew whether the appeal would be necessary or not.

following statement in his Anas: ‘‘The President manifestly inclined to  
the appeal to the people. Knox, in a foolish incoherent sort of a speech,  
introduced the pasquinade lately printed, called the funeral of George  
W—1, and James W——n [Judge Wilson, of the Supreme Court], King  
and Judge, &amp;c., where the President was placed on a guillotine. The  
President was much inflamed; got into one of those passions when he  
cannot command himself; ran on much on the personal abuse which had  
been bestowed on him; defied any man on earth to produce one single act  
of his since he had been in the government which was not done on the

by God he had rather be in his grave than in his present situation; that he  
had rather be on his farm than to be made Emperor of the world; and yet  
that they were charging him with wanting to bea King. That that rascal  
Freneau sent him three of his papers every day, as if he thought he would  
become the distributor of his papers ; that he could see in this, nothing but  
an impudent design to insult him: he ended in this high tone. There was  
a pause. Some difficulty in resuming our question; it was, however, after  
a little while, presented again, and he said there seemed to be no necessity  
for deciding it now; the propositions before agreed on might be put into a  
train of execution, and perhaps events would show whether the appeal  
would be necessary or not.”’
