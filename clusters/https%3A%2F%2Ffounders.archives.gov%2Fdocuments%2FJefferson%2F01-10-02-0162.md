 their Code of laws. This, with some other similar intelligence, has contributed much to convince the people of Europe, that what the English papers are constantly publishing of our anarchy, is false; as they are sensible that such a work is that of a people only who are in perfect tranquillity. Our act for freedom of religion is extremely applauded. The Ambassadors and ministers of the several nations of Europe resident at this court have asked of me copies of it to send to their sovereigns, and it is inserted at full length in several books now in the press; among others, in the new Encyclopedie. I think it will produce considerable good even in these countries where ignorance, superstition, poverty and oppression of body and mind in every form, are so firmly settled on the mass of the people, that their redemption from them can never be hoped. If the almighty had begotten a thousand sons, instead of one, they would not have sufficed for this task. If all the sovereigns of Europe were to set themselves to work to emancipate the minds of their subjects from their present ignorance and prejudices, and that as zealously as they now endeavor the contrary, a thousand years would not place them on that high ground on which our common people are now setting out. Ours could not have been so fairly put into the hands of their own common sense, had they not been separated from their parent stock and been kept from contamination, either from them, or the other people of the old world, by the intervention of so wide an ocean. To know the worth of this, one must see the want of it here. I think by far the most important bill in our whole code is that for the diffusion of knowlege among the people. No other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom, and happiness. If any body thinks that kings, nobles, or priests are good conservators of the public happiness, send them here. It is the best school in the universe to cure them of that folly. They will see here with their own eyes that these descriptions of men are an abandoned confederacy against the happiness of the mass of people. The omnipotence of their effect cannot be better proved than in this country particularly, where notwithstanding the finest soil upon earth, the finest climate under heaven, and a people of the most benevolent, the most gay, and amiable character of which the human form is susceptible, where such a people I say, surrounded by so many blessings from nature, are yet loaded with misery by  kings, nobles and priests, and by them alone. Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance; establish and improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen know that the people alone can protect us against these evils, and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in ignorance.—The people of England, I think, are less oppressed than here. But it needs but half an eye to see, when among them, that the foundation is laid in their dispositions, for the establishment of a despotism. Nobility, wealth, and pomp are the objects of their adoration. They are by no means the free-minded people we suppose them in America. Their learned men too are few in number, and are less learned and infinitely less emancipated from prejudice than those of this country. An event too seems to be prospering, in the order of things, which will probably decide the fate of that country. It is no longer doubtful that the harbour of Cherbourg will be completed, that it will be a most excellent one, and capacious enough to hold the whole navy of France. Nothing has ever been wanting to enable this country to invade that, but a naval force conveniently stationed to protect the transports. This change of

Extract of a Letter from Thomas Jef-

August 13, 1786.  
  
“If any body thinks that Kings,  
Nobles, and Priests, are good preser-  
vators of the public happiness, send  
him here. It is the best school in the  
universe to cure him of that folly. He  
will see here with his own eyes, that

Such was the condition of France  
just previous to the Revolution in that  
country. It was this state of misery  
and wretchedness indeed which caused  
the Revolution in France,—and that

## [LATEST BRITISH EXTRACTS.](http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/32073542)

#### From _The Sydney Monitor (NSW : 1828 - 1838)_

says, &quot; Our act for freedom of religionl  
is extremzely applaud. edi. The  
ambassadors and ministers of the several  
nations of Europe, resident at this  
Court, have asked of me copies of it, to  
send to their sovereigns, and it is  
inserted at full length in several of  
the books ihow in&#x27; the press among  
others in the New Encyclopœ &amp;nbsp; dia.  
I think it will produce considerable  
good, even in those countries where  
ignorance, superstition, poverty, and  
oppression of body and mind in every  
form, are so firmly settled on the mass  
of the people, that their redemption  
from men can never he hoped. If all the  
sovereigns of Europe were to set  
themselves to work to emancipate the  
sminds of their subjects from their  
present ignorance and preju. dices, amid  
that us zealously as they now endeavour  
the contrary, a thousand years would not  
place them oon thait high ground on  
which our common people are now setting  
out. Ours could -not have been so fairly  
placed under the controul of the common  
sense of the people, had they not been  
separated from their parent stock, and  
kept from contamination either from them  
or the other people of the Old World,by  
the intervention of so wide an ocean. To  
know the worth of this, one must see the  
want of it here. I think by far the most  
important bill in our own code, is that  
for the diffusion of knowledge among the  
people No other sure foundation can be  
devised for the preservation of freedom  
andt happiness If any body thlnks, that  
kings, nobles and priests are good  
conservators of the public happiness,  
send him here. It is-the best School in  
the universe to cure him of that folly.  
He will see with his own eyes, that  
these descriptions of men are an  
abandoned confederacy against the happi  
ness of the mass of the people. The  
omnipo. tence of their effect cannot be  
better proved than in this country,  
particularly where, not. withstanding  
the finest soil upon earth, the finest  
climate under heaven, and a people of  
the most benevolent, the most gay and  
amiable character of which the human  
form is susccpible;-when such a people,  
say, surrounded by so many blessings  
from nature, are loaded with misery by  
kings, nobles, and priests, and by them  
alone—preach, my dear Sir, a crusade  
against ignorance; establish and improve  
the law for educating the comnon people.  
Let our countrymen know, that the people  
alone can protect us against these  
evils; and that the -tax which will be  
paid for this purpose, is not more than  
the thousandth part of what will be paid  
to Kings, Priests, and Nobles, who will  
&amp;nbsp; rise up, among us, if we leave  
the people in ignorance. The people of  
England, I think, are less oppressed  
than here. But it needs but half an eye  
to see, when among them, that the  
foundation is laid in their dispositions  
for the establishment of a despotism.  
Nobility,wealth and pomp, are the  
objects of their admiration. They are by  
no means the free minded people we  
suppose them in &#x27;America. Their learned  
men, too, are few in number ; and are  
less learned, and infinitely less  
emancipated from prejudice, than those  
of this country.&quot; Much may be said on  
some of the points in the abov

ston oF Kxowrener.—* I think by far the  
most important bill in our whole codye. is that  
for the diffusien of knowledge among the peo­  
ple. No other sure foundation can be devised  
for the preservation of freedom and happiness.  
If any body thioks that kings, nobles, or  
priests, are good conservatives of public hap­  
piness, send him here, [to France.] It is the  
best school in the universe to cure him of that  
folly. He will sce here, with his own eyes,  
that these descriptions of men are an aban­  
doned confederacy against the happiness of  
the mass of the people. &quot;T&#x27;he omnipotence of  
their effect cannot be better proved, than in  
this country particularly, where, notwithstand­  
ing the finest climate under heaven, and a  
people of the most benevolent, the most gay  
and amiable character of which the human  
form is susceptible ; where such a people, 1  
say, surrounded by so many blessing from na­  
ture, are loaded with misery by Kings, nobles.  
and priests. and by them aﬁme. Preach my  
dear sir, a crusade against ignorance ; establish  
and improve the law for educating the com­  
mon people. Let our countrymen know that  
the people alone can protect us from those  
evils, and that the tax which will be pad for  
this purpose is no more than the thousandth  
part of what will be paid to kings, priests and  
nobles, who will rise up against us if we leave  
the people in ignoranee. The people of Eng­  
land, I think, are less oppressive than here.  
But it needs but half an eye to see, when  
among them, that the foundation is laid in  
their dispositions for the establishment of a  
despotism. Nobility, wealth and pomp are  
the objects of their admiration. They are by  
no means the free-minded people we suppose  
them in America, Their learned men, too  
are few in number and are less learned, and  
infinitely less emancipated from prejudice,  
than those of this country.”

To George Wythe, of Virginia, in  
August, 1786: “ If anybody thinks that  
kings, nobles, or priests are good con-  
servators of the public happiness, send  
him here. It is the best school in the  
universe to cure him of that folly. He  
will see here, with his own eyes, that  
these descriptions of men are an aban-  
doned conspiracy against the happiness  
of the people. Preach, my dear sir, a  
crusade against ignorance ; establish  
and improve the law for educating the  
common people. Let our countrymen  
know, that the people alone can protect  
us against these evils, and that the tax  
which will be paid for this purpose is  
not more than the thousandth part of
