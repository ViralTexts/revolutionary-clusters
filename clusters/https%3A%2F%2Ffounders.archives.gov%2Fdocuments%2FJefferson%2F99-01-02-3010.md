To the Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the US.  
  
Jan. 13 1806.  
  
I lay before Congress the application of Hamet Caramelli, elder brother of the reigning Bashaw of Tripoli,  
solliciting from the US. attention to his services &amp; sufferings in the late war against that state. and in order to  
possess them of the ground on which that application stands the facts shall be stated according to the views &amp;  
information of the Executive.  
During the war with Tripoli, it was suggested that Hamet Caramelli elder brother of the reigning Bashaw, &amp;  
driven by him from his throne, meditated the recovery of his inheritance, &amp; that a concert in action with us was  
desirable to him. we considered that concerted operations by those who have a common enemy were entirely justifiable, &amp;  
might produce effects favorable to both, without binding either to guarantee the objects of the other. but the distance of  
the scene, the difficulties of communication, &amp; the uncertainty of our information inducing the less confidence in the  
measure, it was committed to our agents as one which might be resorted to if it promised to promote our success. Mr. Eaton  
however, our late Consul, on his return from the Mediterranean, possessing personal knowledge of the scene, &amp; having  
confidence in the effect of a joint operation, we authorised Commodore Barron, then proceeding with his squadron to enter  
into an understanding with Hamet, if he should deem it useful: &amp; as it was represented that he would need some aids of  
arms &amp; ammunition, &amp; even of money, he was authorised to furnish them to a moderate extent, according to the prospect  
of utility to be expected from it. in order to avail him of the advantages of mr Eaton’s knolege of circumstances, an  
occasional emploiment was provided for the latter as an Agent for the navy in that sea. our expectation was that an  
intercourse should be kept up between the Ex-bashaw &amp; the Commodore, that while the former moved on by land our squadron  
should proceed with equal pace, so as to arrive at their destination together, &amp; to attack the common enemy by land &amp;  
sea at the same time. the instructions of June 6. to Commodore Barron, shew that a co-operation only was intended, &amp; by  
no means an union of our object with the fortune of the Ex-bashaw: &amp; the Commodore’s letters of Mar. 22. &amp; May 19.  
prove that he had the most correct idea of our intentions. his verbal instructions indeed to mr Eaton &amp; Capt Hull, if  
the expressions are accurately committed to writing by those gentlemen, do not limit the extent of his co-operation as  
rigorously as he probably intended: but it is certain, from the Ex-bashaw’s letter of Jan. 3. written when he was  
proceeding to join mr Eaton, &amp; in which he says ‘your operations should be carried on by sea, mine by land’ that he  
left the position, in which he was, with a proper idea of the nature of the co-operation. if mr Eaton’s subsequent  
convention should appear to bring forward other objects, his letter of Apr. 29. &amp; May 1. views this convention but as  
provisional, the 2d. article, as he expressly states, guarding it against any ill effect, &amp; his letter of June 30.  
confirms this construction.  
In the event it was found that, after placing the Ex-bashaw in possession of Derne, one of the most important  
cities &amp; provinces of the country, where he had resided himself as Governor, he was totally unable to command any  
resources, or to bear any part in co-operation with us. this hope was then at an end; &amp; we certainly had never  
contemplated, nor were we prepared, to land an army of our own, or to raise, pay, or subsist an army of Arabs, to march  
from Derne to Tripoli, &amp; to carry on a land war, at such a distance from our resources. our means and our authority were  
merely naval: and that such were the expectations of Hamet, his letter of June 29. is an unequivocal acknolegement. while  
therefore an impression from the capture of Derne might still operate at Tripoli, and an attack on that place from our  
squadron was daily expected, Colo. Lear thought it the best moment to listen to overtures of peace, then made by the  
Bashaw. he did so: &amp; while urging provisions for the US. he paid attention also to the interests of Hamet; but was able  
to effect nothing more than to engage the restitution of his family. and even the persevering in this demand suspended, for  
some time, the conclusion of the treaty.  
In operations at such a distance, it becomes necessary to leave much to the discretion of the agents  
employed: but events may still turn up beyond the limits of that discretion. unable in such a case to consult his  
government, a zealous citizen will act, as he believes that would direct him, were it apprised of the circumstances, &amp;  
will take on himself the responsibility. in all these cases, the purity &amp; patriotism of the motives should shield the  
agent from blame, &amp; even secure a sanction, where the error is not too injurious. should it be thought by any that the  
verbal instructions, said to have been given by Commodore Barron to mr Eaton, amount to a stipulation that the US. should  
place Hamet Caramalli on the throne of Tripoli, a stipulation so entirely unauthorised, so far beyond our views, &amp; so  
onerous, could not be sanctioned by our government. or should Hamet Caramalli, contrary to the evidence of his letters of  
Jan. 3. &amp; June 29. be thought to have left the position which he now seems to regret, under a mistaken expectation that  
we were at all events to place him on his throne, on an appeal to the liberality of the nation, something equivalent to  
the replacing him in his former situation might be worthy it’s consideration. a nation, by establishing a character of  
liberality &amp; magnanimity, gains in the friendship &amp; respect of others more than the worth of mere money. this appeal  
is now made by Hamet Caramalli to the US. the ground he has taken being different, not only from our views, but from those  
expressed by himself on former occasions, mr Eaton was desired to state whether any verbal communications passed from him  
to Hamet which had varied what we saw in writing. his answer of Dec. 5. is herewith transmitted, &amp; has rendered it still  
more necessary, that in presenting to the legislature the application of Hamet, I should present them at the same time, an  
exact statement of the views &amp; proceedings of the Executive, through this whole business, that they may clearly  
understand the ground on which we are placed. it is accompanied by all the papers which bear any relation to the  
principles of the co-operation, &amp; which can inform their judgment in deciding on the application of Hamet Caramalli.

A nation by establishing a character

I lay before Congrefs the application of Hamet  
Cnramalli, elder brother of the reigning tuftiaw  
of Tripoli, foliciting trom the United States, at­  
tention to bis fc rvices and fufferings in the late  
war ngninlt that date : and in order to poflefs  
them of the ground on which that application  
flauds, the faffs fliall be dated according to the  
▼/&quot;n g and information of the executive.  
During the war with Tripoli, it was fugpeft­  
e l that Hamet Carainnlli, elder brother of the  
reigning bafliaw, and driven by him from his i  
throne, meditated the recovery of his inherit­  
ance, and that a concert in affion w ith us was  
dcflrable to him. We confidered that concert­  
ed operations by thofc who have a common c­  
nrmy were entirely juflifiahle, and might pro­  
duce elfefls favourable to both, without binding  
either to guarantee the ohj_&lt;ffs of the other.  
But the didanee of the feene, ttic difficulties of  
communication, and the uncertainty of our in­  
formation, inducing the Itfs confidence in the  
meafure, it was committed to our agents as one  
which m;gbt he retorted to if it promil&#x27;ed to  
promote our fuccefs.  
Mr. Eaton, however, our late conful, on his  
return from the Mediterranean, pofleffing per- |  
fonal knowledge of the feene, and having con­  
fidence in the effeft of a joint operation, we  
mithorifed commodore Barron, then procce ling  
his fquadron, to enter into an underftand­  
in;» with lLiniet, if he fhonld deem it ufeful :  
and as it was nprefented that he would need  
fomt aids of arin6 and ammunition, and even of  
money, he was aufhorifed to furnilh them to a  
moderate t xtent, acco;ding to the profptff of  
utilit y to be expuffed from it. in order to avail  
him of the advantages of Mr. Eaton’s know­  
ledge u; circuit-dances, an occafional employ­  
ing nt was provided for the latter as an agent for  
t( c navy in that fea. Our expectation was,  
that an in«trcmirfc (houid lie kept up between&#x27;  
t/e ex-hafliaw and the commodore ; that wlule I  
t e former moved on by land, our fquadron  
fliould proceed with equal pace, fo as to arrive  
at their deftination together, and to attack the  
conmon enemy by land and fea at the fame  
time. Theinltrndtionsof June 6lh, to commo­  
dore Barron, fliew that a co-operation only was  
intended, and by no means an union of ourob­  
jeift with the fortune of the tx-bafliaw ; and  
the commodore’s Ittters of March 22, and May  
19, prove that he had the moft correct idea of  
our intentions. Ilia verbal inftruftions, indeed,  
to Mr. Eaton and captain Hull, if the exprefli­  
ons are accurately committed to writing by  
thofe gentlemen, do not limit the extent of hir  
co-operation as rigoroufly as he probably in­  
tended ; but it is certain from the ex-bafhaw’s  
letter of January :l, written when he was pro­  
ceeding to join Mr. Eaton, and in which he  
fays, ** your operations fliould be carried on fey  
fea, mine by land,” that he left the pulitton in  
which he was, with a proper idea of the nature  
of the co-operation. If Mr. Eaton’s fubfe­  
qnent convention fliould appear to bring for­  
ward other objects, his letter of April 2!&gt;, and  
May 1, views thta convention hut as provifion­  
nl, the 2&lt;f article, as he rxprefslv dates, guard  
i &gt;g it neainft any ill eflert, and his le tter of June  
30 confirms this confirmation. In the event it  
was found, that, after placing the ex-bafhaw in  
poflelfion of Derne, one of the mnft important  
cities and provinces of the country, where he  
had refilled himfelf as governor, he was totally  
u table to command any refourres, or to bear  
any part in co-operation with us. This hope  
was then at an end ; and we certainly had never  
contemplated, nor were we prepared to land an  
army &lt;&gt;f our own, ortoraife, pay or fubfift an  
army of Arabs, to march front Derne to Tripo­  
li, and to carry on a land war, at fuch a diftance  
from our refoufees. Our means and ocr au­  
thority were merely naval ; and that fuch were  
t ie expedlatio- s of Hamet, his letter of June  
29 is an untq.Tvoial acknowledgment. While,  
therefore, an imprefliou from the capture of  
Derne might dill operate at Tripoli, and an at­  
ta :k on that place from our fquadron was daily  
expeifted, colonel I.var thought it the bed mo­  
ment toliften to overture&#x27;* of peace then made  
by the bafliaw. He did fo, and while urging  
provifions for the United States, he paid atten­  
tion alfo to the inferefts of Hamet ; but was a­  
ble to rffe&lt;ft nothing more th in to engage the ,  
teftitution of his family, and even the perfever­  
tng in thi* demand di I pended for fome time the |  
conclufiott of this treaty.  
  
In operation* at filch a difbnee it becomes  
neceflary to leave much to the diferetion of the  
agents employed : but event* may fliil turnup  
beyond the limit* of that diferetion. Unable  
in fuch a cafe toconfult his government, a zea­  
lous citizen will a&lt;ft as he beluves that would  
direct him were it apprifed of the circumftan­  
ces, and will take on himfelf the refponfihiliry.  
In all thefe cafe*, the puritv and patriotism of  
the motive* fhould Shield the agent from blame,  
and even fecfirc a famftion where the error is not  
too injurious. Should it he thought by ary  
that the verbal instructions faid to have been  
given by commodore Boron to Mr. Eaton, a­  
mount to n ftipnlation that the United States  
flmuhi place Himet Caramalli on the throne of  
Tripoli; .1 ftipulat ion fo entirely unauthorised,  
fo far bevonel our views, anti fo onerous, could  
not be faneliomd by our government; or flinuld  
lionet Caramalli, contrary to the evidence of  
hi* letters of Ja&#x27;pary « and June V9, be thought  
to have It ft the pnlilion which he now feems to  
r-gret, under a miftaken expectation that we  
n ere at all events t*» pi see him on his ft rone,!  
an appeal to the hocrality of the nation, j  
  
(Something equivalent to the replacing him in  
his former fituation, might be worthy its conli­  
deration.  
A nation by eftablifliing s character of liber­  
ality and magnanimity, gains in the friend If. ip  
and refpclt of others more than the worth of  
mere money. This appeal is now made by  
Hamet Caramalli to the United States. The  
ground he has taken being different, not only  
from our views hut from thofeexprcflcd by him­  
felf, on former ocrafions, Mr. Elton was de­  
ITred to date whether any verbal communicati-,

To the Senate and House of Re/irescntatiacs of the  
United States.  
I lay before congress the application of Harriet Ca*  
Tamalli, elder brother of the reigning; bashaw of Tri­  
poli, soliciting tvom the United States, attention to  
his services and sufferings in the late war against  
that state : and in order to possess them of the ground  
on which that application stands, the f.-.cts shall be  
stated according to the views arid information of the  
executive.  
During the war with Tripoli, it was suggested that  
Unmet Caramdli, elder brother of the reigning b r­  
shnvv, and driven by him from his throne, meditated  
the recovery of his inheritance, and that a concert in  
iiciton with us was desirable to him. We considered  
that concerted operations by tho. • vho have a com­  
mon enemy wete entirely justi.&#x27;i.ible, and might pro­  
vince effects favourable to bulb, without binding efh.-r  
to guarantee tho objects c.f the other, lint he t&#x27;i-.­  
t.mc.e of the scene, the (blficnltic , of conininr.iration,  
and the uncertainty of our information, inducing the  
less confident e in the measure, it v. as committed to  
our agents as one vvhii h might be resorted to if i. pro­  
mised to promote our success.  
  
Mr hat &#x27;ll. however, our lute consul, on his return  
from the Mediterranean, possessing personal know­  
ledge of the scene, an.I having ccr.fi lcncc in the effect  
of a joint ( pc ration, we authorised commodure Bar­  
ron, then proceeding with his squadr-m, to enter into  
an understanding with H imct, if he should deem it  
useful: and as it was repi esentco that he would need  
some aids ot arms and ammunition, and even of mo­  
ney, he was authorized to furnish them to a moderate  
extetr, according to the prospect of utility to be ex­  
pected from it. In order to avail him cf the advan­  
tages of Mr. 1-&#x27;.-.ton&#x27;s knowledge of circumstances, an  
occasional employ ment was provided for the latter as  
an agent tor the navy in that sen Oar expect ition  
•was, that an intercourse should he kept up between  
tlie ex--hash &#x27;.w and the commodore; that while the  
former moved on by land, our sqtiadn n should pro­  
ceed with equal pace, so as to xnive at their desti­  
nation together, and to attack the common enemy In­  
land and sea at the same time. The instructions of  
June Gth, to commodore Barron, shew that a co-ope­  
ration only was intended, and by uo me ms an union  
of our object with the fortune ef the cx-hndnw ; and  
the commodore&#x27;s letters of March 1&#x27;C, an.l May 19,  
prove that he had the most correct i lea of our inten­  
tions. 11 is verbal instructions, indeed, to Mr. Katen  
and captain Huh. if the expressions arc accurately  
Committed to writing by those gentlemen, do not It- j  
mit the extent of his co-oper.ition as rigorouslv as he j  
intended ; but it is certain from the t x-hashaw’s let­  
ter of January 8, written when he was proceeding to  
join Mr. Katun, and in which he says, “ your opera­  
tions should he carried on by sea, mine bv land,” that  
fie i*-ft the position in which lie was, with a proper  
idea of the nature t i tlu- co-operation. If Mr. Ka.  
ton’s subsequent eonven&#x27;ion should appear to bring  
forward oh,vets, his letter of April 2!&gt;, and.Mav l!  
s lews this convention hut .is provisional, the 2d arti­  
cle, ash&#x27; expressly st.tes, guarding it against any ill  
effect, and his letter of June 3J confirms this construc­  
tion. In the event it was found, that, after plating  
the ex-bashaw in possession otllerne, one of the most  
important cities and provinces of the Country, where  
he had resided hum elf as gnvernour, he was totally  
tumble to command any resources, or to bear any  
part in co-operation wi.lt us. This hope was then at  
an end; and v.e certainly had never contemplated,  
nor were \vc prepared to 1 tnd an army of our ov.n,  
or to raise, pay or subsist an army of Arabs, to  
nnreli from Kerne to Tripoli, and to carry cut .t land  
war, at sue], a dlst ,nre from our resource.-. Our  
means and our authority were merely naval; and  
th it such were the expectations of Hornet, his letter  
of June u9 is an unequivocal .•ickuowletlg&#x27;Mien ._  
While, therefore, an impression from the rapture of  
Derne might still operate at lVipoli, and an attack  
on tint place from our squiidron w as 1 ,ilv expected,  
folonel l.e it- thought it the best moment to listen to  
overtures of peace then mad.&quot; by the h ,shaw. lie  
did so, and while urging provisions for the United  
States, he paid attention also to the interests ofUn­  
met; but was able to efil-r.t nothing more than to en­  
gage the restitution of his family, and even the per­  
severing in this demand suspended for some time the  
Conclusion «&gt;f the treaty.  
In operations at such a distance it becomes neces­  
sary to leave much to the discretion of the agents &lt; m­  
ploted ; but events may still turn up bcyc.id the lim­  
its of that discretion. Unable in such a case to con­  
sult his government, a zealous citiz-n will act as lie  
believes that it would direct him w&gt;-ro it apprized of  
the circumstances, c.nd will take on him.-.to the res­  
ponsibility. In all these rases, the purity and pat­  
riotism of the motives sh&lt; n.d shield the agent from  
blame, and even secure a sanction where the- error  
is not too injurious. Should it be thcuj&gt;ht by any that  
  
the verbal instructions sal,! to have been given by  
commodore Barron to Mr. Eaton, amount to a stipu­  
imion that the U. States sliould place Hamet Cara­  
tii;111 i on the throne ot Tripoli ; a stipulation so en­  
tirely unauthorized, so far beyond our views, and so  
onerous, could not be sanctioned by our government  
—or should Unmet Caramalli, contrary to the evi­  
dence of his letters of January 3, and June 29, be  
&#x27;.nought to have left the position wiiich lie now seems  
to regret, under a mistaken expectation that we were  
at all events to place him on his throne, on an appeal  
to the liberality ot the nation, something equivalent  
to the replacing him in his former situation, might  
be worthy its consideration.  
A nation lay establishing a character of liberality  
and magnanimity, gains in the friendship and res­  
pect of others more than the worth of mere money.  
1 his appeal is now made by Hamet Caramalli to the  
L. States. 1 lie ground he has taken being different,  
not only from our views but from those expressed bv  
himselt, on former occasions, Mr. flu ton was desir­  
ed to state whether any verbal communications pas­  
i sell from him to Hamet which had varied what we  
I s&#x27;l&#x27;r &#x27;n writing. His answer of December 3th, is  
herewith transmitted, and has rendered it still more  
necessary, that in presenting to the legislature the  
i application of Ilamet, I should present them at the  
same time an exact statement of the views and pro­  
ceedings of the executive, through this whole busi­  
ness, that they may clearly understand the ground  
I on which we are placed. It is accompanied by ail

1 LAY before Congress the application  
of Kamel Cftramaili, elder bi other ot the  
reigning Bashaw of Tripoli, soliciting  
from tlie United States attention to hi*  
services anti suffering* in the la-e war a  
gainst that stale: and in order to possess  
them of the ground on which that apph  
cation stands the foils shall be slated ac  
cording to the views end information of  
the executive.  
Dui mg the war with Tripoli, it wa*­  
suggested that Hamel Caramalli, elde  
bunker of the reigning Bashaw, and tlri­  
veu by him from his throne, meditated  
ih« recovery of his inhen ance, and tha  
a concert in nction with us was desirab:*  
to him. We considered that concerted  
operations by those who have a commor  
enemy were entirely justifiable, and  
might produce effects favorable to both  
without binding either to gnarai U e Ihr  
objrfU of the ether. But the di ance «  
•he veene, the difficulties of communi  
on, and the uncertainty of our rr.forituti  
on, inducing the less confidence in th  
uieasure, it was committed to «ur agn.i*  
as one which m ght be resorted lo if it pro  
timed t« promote our success.  
Mr. Eaton, however, our late consul,  
on his re’urn frori the Mediterranean,  
possessing personal knowledge of the  
scene, and having confidence in the effect  
of a jaint operation, we authorised com­  
mo,lore Barron, then proceeding withfhis  
squadron, to enter into an understanding  
h Him/if. ST rlsmiM »« I* .  
  
and as it was represented that he would  
need some aids of arms and ammunition,  
and even of money, he was authorised to  
furnish them to a moderate extent, accor­  
ding to the prnspcll of utility to be expell­  
ed from it. In order to ara&#x27;l him of the  
advantages of Mr. Eaton’s knowledge of  
circumstances, an occasional employment  
was provided far the latter ss an agent  
for the navy in that sea. Our expediti­  
on was, that an inturceuisc should be kept  
up between the ex-bashaw and the com­  
modore ; that while the former moved on  
by iand, our squadron should proceed with  
equal pace, so as to arrive at their desli  
nrvinn together, und to attack the com­  
mon enemy by land and sea at the saraa  
lime. The instrudlions of June 6;h, to  
commodore Matron, sh«w that a co ope  
ration only was intended, and by no  
means an union of our objsdl with the  
fortune of the ex-bashaw; and the eom­  
modoiVs Istlers of March 22 and Mav  
19, prove that he had the most corredl  
idea of our intentions. Hi* verbal in.  
Htrudl;or.s, indeed, to Mr. Eaton aud capt.  
Hull, if the expressions ate uccuiutely  
committed to writing by those gentlemen,  
do not limit the extent of his co-operati­  
on as rigorously as he probably intended ;  
but it is certain from the ex bashaw’s let  
ter of January 3, written when he was  
proceeding to join Mr. Eatiin, and in  
which he says, “your operations should  
be carried on by sea, mine by land,” that  
he left the position in which he was, with  
a proper idea of the nature of the co ope­  
ration. If Mr. Eaton’s sulmquent coo­  
vrmion should appear to bring forward  
i oilier nhje6ls, his letter of April 29 and  
May I, views this convention but as pro  
visional, the 2d article, as he expressly  
I stales, guarding it against eny ill effirfl  
&#x27; and his Idler of June 30, confirms this  
  
.•Coiii&#x27;iuftioo. In the event it was found

tations of Flame&#x27;, his let&#x27;.er of June 23 is  
un unequivocal acknowledgment. While,  
therein:e, an impression from the cap­  
ture of Herne might s&#x27;.ill operate at Tri  
poh, and di&lt; miack on that piacu fiom our  
sq iar*rnn was daily txpetted, col. Lear  
thought it ihe best moment to listen to

. T lay before Congrefs the application of  
Hamet Caramaili, elder broither of the reigniog  
bahaw of Tripoti, foliciting from the United  
States aitention to his fervice and futferiogs in  
the late war againft that flate : aod in order too  
poflcls them of the ground on which that appli­  
cation ftands, the facty {hall be ftated according  
to the views and information cf the ecxecotive,  
  
- Daring the war with Tripoli, it was fug­  
gefted thar Hamet Caramall’, elder brother of  
the reigning bathaw, and diivea by him from  
his throoe, meditated the recongry of his inheri­  
tance, and thar a concert in agic,n with us was  
defirable to him. “We coafi fered that coneerted  
operations by thofe who have a common enemy  
were entizely juftifable, and might prodoce ef  
fe&amp;ts favourable to both, without binding either  
to guarantee the objects of the other, Bot the  
diftance of the feene, the dificulties of commu.  
pication, and the wpncerizinty of our informa.  
tion, indyciag the lefe confidence in the meafute,  
it was committed o ouvr agents as one which  
might be refuried to if it promifed to promote  
our fuccefs,  
  
M:r. Katon, however, our late confol, on  
his retarn from the Mediterrancan, poffefing  
perfonal knowledge of the fcene, and having  
confidence in the effeét of a joint operation, we  
authorized commodore Baron, then proceeding  
with his [quadron, 1o enter into an underßand.  
jog with Hamer, if he (hould deem it ufeful :  
&amp; as it was reprefented that be would need fome  
aids of arms and ammunition,snd even of mo­  
ney, he wasauthorized o furnifh them o a mo­  
derate extent, accordiog to the prefped of util­  
ity to be expeéted from it In order to . avail  
him of the adva=m™pges of Mr, Faton’s know­  
ledge of citcumitances, an oecafional employ­  
meot was provided for the lattee as an agent for  
the navy in that fea, Ourexpelation was, that  
an interconrfe thould be kepe up beiween theex­  
bafhaw 2znd the commodore j that while the for­  
mer moved on by land, our fquadron fhould  
proceed with equal pace, fo as to arrive 2t their  
deftination togciher, and to attack the comeon  
enemy by land and fea at the fame time. The  
infru¢tions of Juoe 6th, to commodore Barron  
fhew that a co opesarion only was intended, and  
by no means an union or oar objet with the  
fortane of the ex-bathaw ; and the commodore’s  
letters of March 22 and May Ig, prove that  
he had the moft eorreét idea of oor intentions,  
His verbal inftrulions indeed, to Mr. Eaton and  
Capt. Hull, if the expreffions are accurately  
commitied to writing by thofe gentlemea, do  
not limit the extent o? his en-operation as rigor­  
oufly as A&amp; probably intended ; but it is certain  
from the ex-bathaw’s letter of January 3, writ­  
ten when he was proceeding to join Mr. Katon,  
and in whichbe fays,, ** your operations fhouid  
be carried 0a by fea, mine by land,” that he left  
the pofition in which he was, with a proper  
idea of the nature of the co.operation, If Mr,  
Eaton’s fubf: quent conventior thould appear to  
bring forwaid other objeéts, his lerter of Apni  
ag and May 1, vigw: this couvention but s  
provifiorzl, the 24, article, be exprefsly  
ftarer, goaiding it agaioft ny.zll effeéls, and  
his leteer of }ﬁ 30 confirms this conftruétion,  
In the event it was found, that, after placing the  
ex-bathaw in poficflioa of Derne, one of the moft  
  
impartaat cities and provinces of the country,  
wherethe had refided himfelf as governor, he was  
torally unble 16 command any refources, or o  
bea: any partin co.operation with ws. This  
hope was then atan end ; and we certainly had  
never contemplated, nor were we prepared to  
land wn army of our own, or to raife, pav or  
{fabfit an army of Arabs, to maren from Derne  
to Tripoii, and to carry on a land war, at fuch  
a diftance from our refources, Our means and  
our authocity were merely naval ; and thai fuch  
were (he expe@arions of Hamer, his letrer ot  
Juue 29 i 3 an anequivecal ackoowledgement,—  
While, therefore an impieflion from che caprare  
of Derne might fill opesate at Tripoli, and an  
attack oo that nlace from our fquadron was dai.  
ly expe@ed, Col, Lear thought it the beft mo­  
meont toliffen to overtures of peace then made by  
the bathaw. He did fo, and while arging pro­  
vifions tor the U, States he had paid actention  
alfo to the lerets of Hamer § but was able to  
eff-€t nothing more thai o cagage the reliito­  
won of his family, and .even cthe perfevering in  
h&#x27;s demand fufpcaded for fome time the conclu­  
fiofof the trea&#x27;y. v  
In operecions at fuch a ditance it becomes  
neceffary to leave much to the difcretion of the  
agents employed ; butevents may fill tarn un  
beyond the limiis of that difcretion,” Unable in  
fuch a cafe to confult his government, a zzalous  
eitizen will 2@ as he believes that wonla dielt  
him were it apprized of the circumilaaces, and  
will take on himfe&#x27;f the refponfitility. In all  
thele cafes the purity and patrionifm of the més  
tives hoald fheed the agent from blame and even  
fecore a {anlion » heee the error is not&#x27; oo -  
jurious, - Shoald 1t hewhovght by any thac che

commodore Barron to Mr, Eiton, amount (0 a  
ftipulacion that the United States thould | ace

at all eventy to place him on his throne,. ot an  
appeal to the liberality of the nadon, fomerthing  
cqrtvalent to the geplacing him in his former fit­  
aation, might be worthy it confideraiion.  
A nation by etablifhing a characier of liber.  
ality and magaaninidy, goios in the fiendihip  
and re(pe@ ot others mase than the worth of  
mere money. This appeal is now made by  
Hamet Caramalli tg the U, States. The ground  
he has taken being different, not only Liom our  
views but from thofe exprefled by Rimfieit, on  
former occafiors, Mr, Eaton was defired to ftate  
whether any verbal communications pafied from  
him to Hamet which had vaiied what we faw in  
writing, His anfwer of December gth, is here­  
with tzanfmitied, and has rendered it fill more  
necelary, that in prefenting to the legiflature  
the application to Hamet, 1 thould prefent them

and procecdings of the cxecutive, thiovgh this  
whole bofinefs, that they may clearly underfiand  
the groun! on which we are placeds It is se­  
companicd by all the papers, which bear aoy re­  
laiion to the princijles of the co-operation, and  
which can inform their judgement in deciding  
on the application of Hamet Carvamalli.

I I.AY before Congrtfs the np- ;  
plication of Harriet Caramalli, elder :  
brother of the reigning bafhaw of j  
of I&#x27;ripoli, foliciting from the United !  
States attention to his fervices and j  
futFerings in the late war against that  
Itate *, and in order to poileli them  
of the ground on which that applica­  
tion {lands, the fadls fhall be Hated  
according to the views of the execu­  
tive  
During the war with Tripoli, it  
was fuggefled that Ilamct Caramalli,  
elder brother of the reigning ba&#x27;liarr,  
and diiven by him from his throne,  
meditated the recovery of his inh« i i­  
11.ee, and that a concert in ketion t  
ius was deflrabie 10 liim. We  
• m m I  
  
•nrdCrcd mat corcer^a operation  
v rHTc who have a common enemy ‘  
rf entirely jullifiable ami might  
&#x27;t‘ e effects favorable to both,  
hen. binding either, to guarantee  
. hj,&#x27;cts « t ;h? other. Lint the

; i f our i..formation, inducing  
. I&gt; co fidence in the meafue, «  
ommirtetl to our agents as  
’ inch might be re farted to, if it  
. iscd to promote our fuccefs.  
Mr. Eaton, however, our late con­  
fia m his return from the Mediter­  
ranean, poffcffing perfonai knowledge  
cf th * feene, and having confidence  
in the ff (ft c?f a joint co-operation,  
we authorifed commodore Earron,  
then proceeding with his Iquadron,  
to enter into an underftnnding with  
Hacret, if he lhould deem it ufcfiil;  
and as it was represented that he  
need Tome aids of arms and ammuni­  
tion. and even of money, he was  
authorized to furnini then to a mod­  
erate extent, according to a profpe£t  
of utility to be expected from ft. In  
order to avail him of the advantages  
• O  
of Mr. Eaton’s knowledge of circum­  
Ifances, an occafional employment  
was provided for the latter, as an  
agent for the navy in that lea. Our  
expectation was, that an imeixotirfe  
lhould be kept up between the ex-ba­  
fhaw and the commodore $that while  
the former moved on by land, our  
fquadton lhould proceed with equal  
pace, fo as to arrive at their deltina­  
tion together,and to attack the com  
moil enemy by land and fea at the  
fame time. «  
  
I he inductions of Jupe 6ta, to  
Commodore Barron, dew that a co­  
operation cniy was intended, and by  
no means an union of our objeci  
w ith the fortune of the Ex-Baihaw ;  
and the Commodore’s letters of  
March 22, and May 19, proves, that *  
he had the mod correct idea of our  
intentions. His verbal inductions,  
indeed, to Mr. Eaten, and Captain  
Hull, if the expremons are accurate­  
ly committed to writing by thofe gen­  
tlemen, who do not limit the extent  
of his co-operation a« rigouroufly as  
he probably intended i but it is cer­  
tain from the Ex-Bifhaw&#x27;s letter of  
Jan 3, written when he was proceed­  
ing to join Mr Eaton, and in which  
he favs, “ your operations fhouid be  
carried on by fea, mine by land ”  
that he left the pofnion in which he  
W is, with a proper idea of the nature  
c*f the co-operation. It Mr* Eaton’s  
fublequent convention {hould appear  
to bring forward other objects, his  
litter of April 29, and May i, views  
this convention out as provisional.  
The 2d article, as he exprlsly dates,  
gua,v ng it againd any ill etFecl, and  
his letter of June 30, confirms tins  
ctndni dion. In rhe event, it wa9  
found that alter placing the Lx* Bath­  
  
zvr ill poiTciTcii of £)err.e, one of (he  
moil important cities and provinces  
of ilicmmU&#x27;Y, where he had refi  
Jed hirr.felf as Governor, he was to  
ta.ly unable to command any refour­  
ces, or tokbear any part ill co-operA­  
lien \vithf3us rius hope was rhen  
at an end ; anJ* we certainly had  
never contemplated, nor were we  
prepared to land an army of our own,  
or to raile, pay, cr fubfitl an army  
of Arabs, *o march from Perile to  
1 riooli, «nJ to carry on a land war  
4  
at iuch a dill an cc from opr re Tour­  
ers. Our means and our authority  
were merely- naval; and that fuch  
vrere ti e expectations oi&quot; Hamet, his  
letter of June 29, is an unequivocal  
acknowledgement. While, there­  
fore* an impreflion from the capture  
of Drrnc might Hill operate at Tri -  
poli, and an attack on that place frotn  
our fquadron was daily expe£led,  
Col. Lear thought it the belt mo­  
ment to lillen to overtures of peace  
then made by the Baftaaw. He did  
fo, and while urging provifions lot  
the United iStates; he paid attention  
alfo to the interrhs of Hamet; but!  
w as able to effcdl nothing more than I  
to engage the reftitution of his fam­  
ily, and evm the per fevering in this  
demand fufpended for fometime the  
conclufion of the treaty.  
In operations at fuch a diftnance  
it becomes neceflTary to leave much  
to the dicretion of.the agents em­  
ployed . But events may Hill turn  
up beyond the limits of that difcrc­  
tion. Unable in fuch a cafe to con­  
fult his Government, a zealous citi-1  
zenwill acl as he believes that would  
diiecl him were it apprifed of the  
cin urn fiances, and w ill take on him­  
ftlf the rtfponfbilitv. In all thefe  
cafes, the purity and patriotifm of,  
the motives lhould fhield the agent1  
(rom blame, and even fecurea fan&amp;-|  
  
ion where the error is not too  
Parron to Mr. Eaton amount to a  
ltipwlation that the United States*  
Ok uld place Hamit Carrimalli on &#x27;  
the throne of Tripoli ; a ftipulation

a miltaken ‘expectation that we were  
at a&#x27;l events to pdace him on his  
throne, on an apeal 10 the liberality  
of tl ie nation, fomething equivalent  
to the placing him in his former fix­

A nation by eflublifhing a charac­

in the reijecf and friendfhip of oth­

from the President, by his Secretary,  
Mr. Coles :—  
To the Senale and Heoufe of Reprefenta­  
. tives of the U. .  
I LAY before Congtels the appli­  
cation of Hamer Caramarrr elder  
brother of the reigning bathaw of Tri-.  
poli, soliciting from the United States,  
attention to his services and fufferings  
in the late war againit that state : and  
in order to poflels them of the ground  
on which that application stands, the  
faéts shall be stated according to the  
viewsand information of the executive. {  
- During the war with Tripoliyit was |  
suggested that Hamet Carmalli, elder |  
brother of the reigning bathaw, and |  
driven by him from his throne, medi- ;  
tated the recovery of his inheritance, |  
and that a concert in a&amp;ion with us |  
was desirable to him. We considered, &#x27;  
that concerted operations by :thofe |  
who have a common enemy were en- |  
tirely jultifiable and might -produce ‘  
effects favorable to both, without bind­  
ing either to guarantee the objects of |  
the other. But the distance of the i  
scene, the difficulties of commuaica­  
tion, and the uncertainty, of our infor- l  
mation, inducing the less confidence in  
the measure, it was committed o our  
agents, as one which mighe be resort.  
ed to if it promiled to promote our  
fuccefad v 1.7 et  
- Mr Eaton, however, our late con­  
{ul, on his &#x27;return from the Mediterra­  
nean, poflefling personal knowledge of {  
the scene, and baviog confidence in I  
the effeét of a joint operation, we au- ‘  
thorized commodore Barron,then pro- ;  
cecding with his squadron, to enter |  
into. an uvaderftanding with Hamet, if |  
he thould deem it uleful : and as it  
was represented that he would negd  
some aids-of aims and ammunition,  
-and even of money, he was authorized  
to furnifh them at a moderate extent,  
according to_the profpe&amp; of utility to  
be expected from it. In order to a­  
vail him of theadvantages of Mr. Ea­  
ton’s knowledge of circomftances; an  
occasional employment was provided !  
for the latter as an agent for the navy  
~inthat sea. Qur expedtation was, that  
an intercourse should be kept up bz­  
tween the ex-bathaw and the commo­  
dore ; that while the former mowed  
on by land, our squadron thould pro- |  
~ceed with equal pace, {0 as to arrive  
at their destination together, and to at­  
‘tack the commen enemy by sea and  
land at the fame time. The inltruc.  
tions of Juge 6th, to commodore Bars.  
ron, shew that a co-operation only was  
intended, and by. no means an union |  
of our object with the fortane of the |  
Ex-Bafhaw ; -and the Commodore’s  
letters of March 22, and May 19, |  
proy-g, ~that .he had . the melt cor­  
7c&amp; ‘idea of eur intentions. His  
verbal M!Wad,mmﬁm

’:]Qfﬁﬁﬁl 29, and May 1)t views this  
_convention but as provisional: The  
2d article, as he expressly Rates,guard.  
ing it against any ill effedt, and his  
Aetterof June 30,confirms this conftznc­  
tion. In the event, it was found that  
after placing ‘th: Ex-Bathaw in pof.  
fefMon of Derne, one of the molt im­  
p()rtant&#x27; cities and provinces of that  
country, where be had resided him­  
{elf as Governor, he was totally una­  
ble to cemmand ary resources, or to  
bear any part in co-operation with us.  
Tkis hope was then at an end ; and  
we certainly had never contemplated,  
nor were wc prepared to land an ar­  
my of our own, or to raise, pay, or  
subsist &#x27;an army -of Arabs, to march  
from Derne to ’L‘r&amp;oli,a‘nd to carry on  
a land war at such a distance from our  
resources. Qur means and our author­  
ty were merely naval ; aad that such  
were the expeétations of Hamet, his  
letter of June 29, is an unequivocal  
acknowledgzement. . While therefore,  
an impreflion from the capture of  
Derne might fill operate’ at Tripoli,  
and an attack on that place from our  
squadron was daily expe&amp;ed; colonel  
Lear thought it the belt moment to  
lilten to overtures of peace then made  
by the bathaw. He did so, and while  
urging provisions for the the United  
States, he paid attention also to the  
interests of Hamet; but was able to  
effett nothing more than to engage  
‘the restitution of his family, and even  
the prefevering in this demand {ufpen­  
ded for some time the conciufion of  
the treaty. A  
In operations at such a distance it  
becomes neceflary to leave much to  
the discretion of the agents employed :  
Dut events may {ill turn np beyond  
the limits of that discretion. Unable  
in such a case to corfuit his Govern­  
ment, a zealous citizen will 2&amp; as he  
believes that would direét him were it  
apprised of the circumstances, and  
will take on himfelf the responsibility.  
In al! thefecafes, the purity and pat­  
riotism of the motive should shield the  
agent from blame, and even secure a  
fan&amp;ion where the error is not teo in­  
jurious. Should it be thought by a­  
ny that the verbal inltru®ion said to  
have been given by Commodore Bar-  
RON to Mr. EaTon, amount to a Rip­  
ulation that the United States should  
place Hamer Carsmarrt ‘on the  
throne of Tripo/i ; a Ripualation so  
entirely ugauthorifed, so far beyond  
our views, and so onerous, could mot  
be fan&amp;tioned by our government ; or  
thould Hamet Caramalli, contrary to  
the evidence of his letters of Jan. 3,  
and June 29, be thought to havé left  
the position which he now {e¢ms to re­  
gret, under a miltaken expeétation  
‘that we were at all events to place him  
on his throne, on an appeal to the lib­  
erality of the nation, something equiv.  
alent to the placing him in his former ,  
firuation, might be worthy its consid­  
eration. g  
  
A nation, by efablifbing a charac­  
ter of liberality aad magnanimity,  
gains in the refpe and {riendfhip .of  
others more than the worth of mere  
money. This appeal is now madeiy  
HametCaramalli tothe U.States. 1e  
ground he has taken being different  
not only from our views but by those  
exprefled by himfelf on former occa­  
sions; Mr, ILaton was desired to state  
whether: any veabal communications  
pafled from him to Hamet which had  
varied&#x27; what we fawin writing. His  
answer of Dec. §, is herewith trans­  
mitted, and has sendered it {till more  
neceflary, that in presenting to the le­  
gislature the application of Hamet, I  
_ihould present them at the fame time  
an exalt (tatement of the views and  
proceedings of the executive, through  
this whole buficefs, that they .may  
clearly understand the ground. on  
which we are placed. It isaccompa­  
nied with all the papers which bear a­  
1y relation to&#x27;the principles of the co­  
operation, ‘and which can inform their  
judgment ‘in- deeiding ‘on the appli­  
cation of Hamet Caramalli.

(BALANCE SUMMARY  
  
—_——  
  
The Ex-Bafhaw of Tripolt.  
  
The application of Hamet Bashaw to our gov-  
érament for relief and assistance, has brought forth  
a great number of documents, which serveto shew  
the nature and extent ef the alliance or co-operation  
of our government and the gallant Earon, with  
the exiled sovereign. These documentsare highly  
interesting, but, as we observed in our last, ther  
great length compels us to reduce them to a sumi-  
Mary :-—  
  
The President in the message accompanying  
these documents, states, that on its being suggested  
that a concert in action with us was desirable tothe  
Ex-Bashaw, it was considered that concerted ope-  
rations by those who have a common enemy were  
entirely justifiable, and might produce effects favor-  
able to both, without binding either to guarantee  
the objects of the other—that the measure was  
committed to agénts—that commodore Barron was  
authorized to enter into an understanding with  
Hamet, and furnish himi with some aids of arms  
and ammunition, and even money—that in order to  
avail him of the advantages of Mr. Eaton’; know-  
ledge of circumstances, an occasional employment  
was provided for the latter as an agent for the navy  
in that sea. «* Our expectation (says Mr. Jefferson)  
was, that an intercourse sheuld be kept up between  
the Ex Bashaw and the commodore ; that whilst  
the former moved on by land, our squadron should  
proceed with equal pace, so as to arrive at their  
destination together, and to attac&#x27;? the common en-  
emy by land and séa at the same time.” The  
President refers to the instructions to Commodore  
Barron, and s¢véral cther circumstances, to shew  
that a co-operation only was inténded, and not an  
union of our object withthe fortune of the Ex-Ba-  
shaw. The President proceeds to state, that i

To the Senate and House of Refiresentatives of the United States.  
  
I LAY before congress the application of Hamet Caramalli, elder bro-  
ther of the reigning bashaw of Tripoli, soliciting from the United States  
attention to his services and sufferings in the late war against that state ;  
and in order to possess them of the ground on which that application  
stands, the facts shall be stated according to the views and information of  
the executive.  
  
During the war with Tripoli, it was suggested that Hamet Caramalli,  
elder brother of the reigning bashaw, and driven by him from his throne,  
meditated the recovery of his inheritance, and that a concert in  
action with us was desirable to him. We considered that concerted ope-  
rations by those who have a common enemy were entirely justifiable, and  
might produce effects favourable to both, without binding either to guaran-  
ty the objects of the other. But the distance of the scene, the difficulties  
of communication, and the uncertainty of our information, inducing the iess  
confidence in the measure, it was committed to our agents as one which  
might be resorted to it if promised to promote our success.  
  
Mr. Eaton, however, our late consul, on his return from the Mediter-  
panean, possessi’.g personal knowledge of the scene, and having confidence  
in the effect of a joint operation, we authorized commodore Barron, then

proceeding With his squadron, to enter into an mens with Hamety  
if he should deem it useful ; and as it was represented that:he would |  
some aids of arms and ammunition, and even of money, he was authorised to  
furnish them to a moderate extent, according to the prospect of utility to  
be expected from it. In order to avail him of the advantages of Mr. Ea-  
ton’s knowledg = of circumstances, an occasional employment was provided  
for the latter as an agent for the navy in that sea. Our expectation was,  
that an intercourse should be kept up between the ex-bashaw and the com-  
modore ; that, while the former moved on by land, our squadron should  
proceed with equal pace, so as to arrive at their destination together, and  
to attack the common enemy by land and sea at the same time. The in-  
structions of June 6th to commodore Barron show that a co-operation only  
was intended, and by no means a union of our object with the fortune of  
the ex-bashaw ; and the commodore’s letters of March 22 and May 19  
prove that he had the most correct idea of our intentions, His verbal m-  
structions, indeed, to Mr. Eaton and captain Hull, if the expressions are  
accurately committed to writing by those gentlemen, do not limit the ex-  
tent of his co-operation as rigorously as he probably intended ; but it is  
certain, from the ex-bashaw’s letter of January 3, written when he was  
proceeding to join Mr. Eaton, and in which he says, “ your operations  
should be carried on by sea, mine by land,” that he left the position in  
which he was with a proper idea of the nature of the co-operation. If  
Mr. Eaton’s subsequent convention should appear to bring forward other  
objects, his letter of April 29 and May 1 views this convention but as pro-  
visional, the second article, as he expressly states, guarding it against any  
ill effect, and his letter of June 30 confirms this construction. In the event  
it was found that, after placing the ex-bashaw in possession of Derne, one  
of the most important cities and provinces of the country where he had  
resided himself as governor, he was totally unable to command any re-  
sources, or to bear any part in co-operation with us, This hope was then  
at anend; and we certainly had never contemplated, nor were we pre-  
pared to land an army of our own, or to raise, pay, or subsist an army of  
Arabs, to march from Derne to Tripoli, and to carry on a land war at  
such a distance from our resources. Our means and our authority were  
merely naval; and that such were the expectations of Hamet, his letter  
of June 29 is an unequivocal acknowledgment. While, therefore, an im-  
pression from the capture of Derne might still operate at Tripoli, and an  
attack on that place from our squadron was daily expected, colonel Lear  
thought it the best moment to listen to the overtures of peace then made  
by the bashaw. He didso; and, while urging provisions for the United  
States, he paid attention also to the interests of Hamet, but was able to ef-  
fect nothing more than to engage the restitution of his family, and even  
the persevering in his demand suspended for some time the conclusion of  
the treaty.  
  
In operations at such a distance it becomes necessary to leave much te  
the discretion of the agents employed ; but events may still turn up beyond  
the limits of that discretion, Unable‘in such a case to consult his govern-  
ment, a zealous citizen will act as he believes that would direct him were  
it apprized of the circumstances, and will take on himself the responsi-  
bility. In all these cases the purity and patriotism of the motives should  
shield the agent from blame, and even secure a sanction. where the error  
is not too injurious. Should it be thought by any that the verbal instruc-  
tions said to have been given by commodore Barron to Mr. Eaton amount  
to a stipulation that the United States should place Hamet Caramalli on  
the throne of Tripoli ; a stipulation so entirely unauthorized, so far beyond  
our views, and so onerous, could not be sanctioned by our government ; or  
should Hamet Caramalli; contrary to the evidence of his letters of January

3 and June 29, be thought to have left the position which he now seems to  
“regret, under a mistaken expectation that we were at all events to plage  
him on his throne, on an appeal to the liberality of the nation something  
equivalent to the replacing him in his former situation might be worthy  
its consideration.  
  
A nation, by establishing a character of liberality and magnanimity,  
gains, in the friendship and respect of others, more than the worth of  
mere money. This appeal is now made by Hamet Caramalli to the  
United States. The ground he has taken being different, not only from  
our views, but from those expressed by himself on former occasions, Mp.  
Eaton was desired to state whether any verbal communications passed  
from him to Hamet which had varied what we saw in writing. His  
answer of December 5th is herewith transmitted, and has rendered it still  
more necessary, that, in presenting to the legislature the application of  
Hamet, I should present them, at the same time, an exact statement of the  
views and proceedings of the executive through this whole business, that  
they may clearly understand the grounds on which we are placed. It is  
accompanied by all the papers which bear any relation to the principles  
of the co-operation, and which can inform their judgment in deciding on  
  
the application of Hamet Caramalli.
