It is with inexpressible Concern that the General upon his first Arrival in the army, should find an Officer sentenced by a General Court Martial to be cashier’d for Cowardice—A Crime of all others, the most infamous in a Soldier, the most injurious to an Army, and the last to be forgiven; inasmuch as it may, and often does happen, that the Cowardice of a single Officer may prove the Distruction of the whole Army: The General therefore (tho’ with great Concern, and more especially, as the Transaction happened before he had the Command of the Troops) thinks himself obliged for the good of the service, to approve the Judgment of the Court Martial with respect to Capt. John Callender, who is hereby sentenced to be cashiered. Capt. John Callender is accordingly cashiered and dismissd from all farther service in the Continental Army as an Officer.  
The General having made all due inquiries, and maturely consider’d this matter is led to the above determination not only from the particular Guilt of Capt. Callenders, but the fatal Consequences of such Conduct to the army and to the cause of america.  
He now therefore most earnestly exhorts Officers of all Ranks to shew an Example of Bravery and Courage to their men; assuring them that such as do their duty in the day of Battle, as brave and good Officers, shall be honor’d with every mark of  
  
distinction and regard; their names and merits made known to the General Congress and all America: while on the other hand, he positively declares that every Officer, be his rank what it may, who shall betray his Country, dishonour the Army and his General, by basely keeping back and shrinking from his duty in any engagement; shall be held up as an infamous Coward and punish’d as such, with the utmost martial severity; and no Connections, Interest or Intercessions in his behalf will avail to prevent the strict execution of justice.  
Capt. Scotts and Capt. Styles’s Company’s from New Hampshire, are to be incorporated, or added to Col. Serjants Regiment, agreeable to the application made for that purpose. No Officer or Soldier, posted in the Lines for the defence of them, on Prospect Hill, or Winter Hill, or elsewhere, are upon any account to sleep out of their encampment or leave it at night. The Troops from New Hampshire are particularly requir’d to attend to this Order, from their particular Circumstances of situation.  
No Soldier, belonging to these Post’s, or elsewhere, to be suffered to straggle at a distance from their respective parade, on any pretence; without leave from his Officers: As an unguarded Hour, may prove fatal to the whole army, and to the noble Cause in which we are engaged. The Importance of which, to every man of common understanding, must inspire every good Officer and Soldier, with the noblest Ardour and strictest attention, least he should prove the fatal Instrument of our ruin.  
The Adjutant General is required, to make a return as quick as possible, of the Troops in Cambridge, their number, and the duty they do.  
Complaints having been made with respect to the Bread, as being sour and unwholesome; the Quarter Master General is hereby directed to enquire into the matter and report upon it: At the same time to inform the Bakers that if any Complaints are made; and they shall be found just, they will be most severely punished.  
The Guards on the Roads leading to Bunker’s Hill, are ordered not to suffer any person to pass them, unless an Officer is sent down from the Lines to order it, or they will be severely punished.  
The General has great Reason; and is highly displeased, with  
  
the Negligence and Inattention of those Officers, who have placed as Centries, at the out-posts, Men with whose Characters they are not acquainted. He therefore orders, that for the future, no Man shall be appointed to those important stations, who is not a Native of this Country, or has a Wife, or Family in it, to whom he is known to be attached. This Order is to be consider’d as a standing one and the Officers are to pay obedience to it at their peril.  
A Complaint of the most extraordinary kind, having been made to the General, that Soldiers inlisted in one Regiment, have been seduced to reinlist into others, by Agents employed for that purpose under the specious promises of money, or leave of absence from the army, a procedure so subversive of all order, discipline, and of the very Existance of the army, cannot be forgiven—the strictest Orders are therefore given against such practices, and the General most earnestly declares, that if any Agent or Soldier, shall hereafter be found so offending, he will punish them with the utmost severity.  
A General Court Martial having sat upon William Pattin and reported, that no Evidence appeared against him, to support the Charge; the General defers his decision upon the Report, untill farther consideration. In the mean time, the Adjutant General is ordered to wait on Col. Ward, by whom the Prisoner was confin’d and learn from him upon whose complaint, and what Witnesses, there are to support it.  
A regimental Court Martial is ordered to sit to morrow 10 oClock, on Samuel Bartlett of the Company late Capt. Callenders, and Col. Gridley’s Regiment, confin’d for “abusive behaviour.”  
A General Court Martial to sit to morrow, 10 oClock A:M: for the Trial of Thomas Daniely, charged with “stealing”; each of the above Prisoners to have Notice to day, and the Witnesses in like manner order’d to attend.  
In order that all the sick and wounded in the Army may be provided for, and taken Care of in the best way and manner possible: It is order’d, that when any Officer or Soldier is so ill, either by a Wound, or otherwise, that the Surgeon of the Regt to which he belongs, finds he cannot be properly taken care of in such Regt such surgeon shall send him to the Camp Hospital to which they belong, with a Certificate of the Man’s Name, the  
  
Company to which he belongs, and in that case the Surgeon of the Hospital shall receive said sick and wounded; and in case such Hospital shall be too full, in that case the surgeons of said Hospital shall send such of his patients, as may be removed with safety, to the Hospital at Water-town, with the like Certificate as above, on which the Surgeon of Water-town Hospital, is to receive, and take care of him

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
1. It is with inexpressible concern that the  
General upon his first arrival in the army,  
should find an officer sentenced by a General  
Court Martial to be cashired for cowardice a  
crime of all others the most infamous, in a  
soldier, the most injurious to an army, and  
the last to be forgiven, inasmuch as it may,  
and often does happen, that the cowardice of a  
single officer, may prove the destruction of the  
whole army. The General therefore, though  
with great concern,(and more especially as the  
transaction happened before he had command  
of the troops,) thinks himself obliged, for the  
good of the service, to approve the judgment  
of the court martial, with n spect to Capt. John  
Callender, who is hereby sentenced to be  
cashiered ; Capt. John Callender is accordingly  
• cashiered, and dismissed from further service,  
in the continental army as an officer.  
The General having made all due enquiries,  
and maturely considered this matter, is led to  
the above determination, not only from the  
particular guilt of Capt. Callender, but the  
fatal consequences of such conduct to the army  
and to the cause of America ; he now there­  
fore most earnestly exhorts officers of all ranks  
to show an example of bravery and courage to  
their men, assuring them that such as do their  
duty in the day of battle as brave and good offi­  
cers, shall be honored with every mark ot dis­  
tinction and regard, their manners and merits  
made known to the general congress and all  
America : 6n the other hand he.most positive­  
ly deciares that every officer, be bis rank what  
it may, who shall betray his country, dishon­  
ors the army and his general by basely keep­  
ing back and shrinking from duty in any en  
gagement, shall be held up as an infamous  
coward, and punished as such with the utmost  
martial severity, and no connections, interest,  
or intercession in his behalf will avail to pre­  
vent the strict execution of justice.  
2. Capt. Scott’s and Capt. Style’s compa­  
nies from New Hampshire, are to be incorpo­  
rated or added to Col. Sergeant’s regiment,  
agreeable to the application made for that pur­  
pose.  
3. No officer or soldier posted in the lines,  
for the defence of them, on Prospect Hill or  
Winter Hill or elsewhere, are upon any ac­  
count to sleep out of their encampment or  
leave it at night. The troops raised in New  
Hampshire arc particularly required to attend  
to this order from their particular circumstanc­  
es of situation.  
4. No soldier belonging to those posts or  
elsewhere to be suffered to straggle at a dis­  
tance from their respective parade, on any pre­  
tence without leave from his officers, as an un­  
guarded hour may prove fated to the whole ar­  
my, and the noble cause in which we are  
engaged, the importance of which to every  
man of common understanding must inspire  
every good officer and soldier with the noblest  
ardor and strictest attention, lest he should  
prove the fatal instrument of our rum.  
5. The adjutant .general is required to  
make a return as quick as possible of the  
troops in Cambridge, their number, and the  
duty they do.  
6. Complaints having been made with re­  
spect to the bread, as being sour and unwhole­  
some, the quartermaster is di­  
rected to inquire into the imißeK. anW report  
upon it; at the same lime to ihwriw nUAakers  
it any more complaints are inaje. thw are  
found just, they will be most severely  
ished.  
7. The guards on the roads leading to Bun­  
ker’s Hill are ordered not to suffer any person  
to pass them unless an officer is sent down  
from the lines to order it, or they will be se­  
verely punished.  
8. The general has great reason, and. is  
highly displeased with the negligence and in­  
attention of those officers who have placed as  
sentries at the outposts men with whose char  
actors they are not acquainted. He therefore  
orders that for the future no man shall be ap­  
pointed to those important stations who is not  
a native of this country, or has a wife and fam­  
ily in it, to whom he is known to be attached ;  
this order is to be considered as a standing  
one, and the officers are to pay obedience to it  
at tlieir peril.  
9. A complaint of the most extraordinary  
kind having been made to the general that sol­  
diers enlisted in one regiment have been se­  
duced to enlist into others by agents enlisted  
for that purpose, under the specious promise  
of money or leave of absence from the army, a  
procedure so subversive of ail order and disci­  
pline, and of the very existence of the army,  
cannot be forgiven ; the strictest orders are  
therefore given against such practices, and the  
general most earnestly declares that if any  
or soldier shall be found hereafter so of­  
iending, he will punish them- with the utmost  
severity.  
10th. A x eral court martial having sat  
upon Wm. Patten, and reported that no evi­  
dence appeared against him to suppuit the  
charge, the general defers decision upon the  
report, until further consideration ; and in the  
meantime, the adjutant general is ordered to  
wait on Col. Ward, by whom the prisoner was  
confined, and learn from him upon whose com­  
plaint and what witnesses there are to support  
it.  
11th. A regimental court martial is ordered  
to sit to-morrow at 10 o’clock, on Samuel Bart­  
lett of the company late Capt. Cullender’s, and  
Col. Gridly&#x27;s regiment, confined lor abusive  
behavior.  
12th. A general court martial to sit to-iuor­  
row forenoon, for the trial of Thomas Domily,  
charged with stealing. Each ot the above  
prisoners to have notice today, and the wit­  
nesses in like manner ordered to attend.  
18th. In order that all the sick and wounded  
in the army may be provided lor, and taken  
care ot m the best way and manner possible,  
it is ordered that when any officer or soldier is  
so ill, either by a wound or otherwise, that the  
surgeon of the regiment to which he belongs  
finds he cannot be properly taken care of in  
such regiment, such surgeon shall send him to  
the camp hospital to which they belong, with  
a certificate, the man’s name, the company  
and regiment to which he belongs, and in that  
case the surgeon of the hospital shall receive  
the said sick and wounded, and in case such  
hospital shall be too lull, in that case the sur­  
geon of said hospital shall send such ol his
