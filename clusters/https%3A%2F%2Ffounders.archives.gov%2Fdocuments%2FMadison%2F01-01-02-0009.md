vings there v. 22d. &amp;c  
It is said of some Turks that after they have seen Mahomets Tomb, the[y] put out their Eyes, that they may never defile them after they have seen so glorious an object. v. 29.  
Parts &amp; abilities for the ministerial function are not sufficient to warrant our undertaking of it without a regular Call  
  
  
  
  
  
Some Proverbs of Solomon.  
  
  
Chap. 9.V. 7. He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself Shame &amp;c.  
8. Reprove not a Scorner, lest he hate thee.  
  
10..17 ———; but he that refuseth reproof, erreth  
26 As Vinegar to the Teeth, and smoke to the Eyes, so is the Sluggard to them that send him.  
  
XI.13. A Tale-bearer revealeth Secrets: but he that is of a faithful Spirit concealeth the Matter 12: v. 23  
15. He that is surety for a Stranger shall smart for it: &amp; he that hateth suretyship, is Sure. VI. 1. XVII:18  
25. The liberal Soul shall be made Fat &amp;c.  
  
XII.22. Lying Lips are abomination to the Lord: but they that deal truly are his delight.  
  
XIII.12 Hope deferred maketh the Heart Sick &amp;c.  
24 He that Spareth his Rod hateth his Son: But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes  
  
XIV.29 He that is Slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of Spirit exalteth folly.  
  
XV.Argumt. Ceremonies to be retained for 3 Reasons from Melancthon  
1. A Soft Answer Turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger  
3 The Eyes of the Lord are in every Place, beholding the evil and the Good.  
5 A Fool despiseth his Father’s Instruction: but he &amp;c  
  
XVI5. Every one that is pround in heart, is an abomination to the Lord. &amp;c  
11 A Just weight &amp; balance are the Lord’s: all the weights of the bag are his work  
16 How much better is it to get Wisdom than Gold: &amp; to get understanding rather to be chosen than Silver  
24. Pleasant Words are as an Honey-comb, sweet to the Soul &amp; health to the Bones  
25. There is a way that seemeth right unto a Man, but the end thereof are the ways of Death—XIV. 12.  
28. ———; a Whisperer seperateth chief Friends  
32. He that is Slow to anger, is better than the Mighty; &amp;c  
  
XVIII8. The Words of a Tale-bearer are as Wounds, &amp; they go down into the innermost parts of the Belly  
  
13. He that Answereth a Matter before he heareth it, it is folly &amp; shame unto him.  
21. Death &amp; Life are in the Power of the Tongue; &amp; they that love it, shall eat the fruit thereof.  
22 Whoso findeth a Wife findeth a good thing, &amp; obtaineth favour of the Lord.  
  
XX3 ’Tis an honour for a Man to cease from strife: but a fool will be medling;  
9 Who can say I have made my Heart clean; I am pure from my sin  
10 Divers weights and measures are abomination to the Lord. v. 23  
14 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way then he boasteth

d follow… .”  
In a paraphrase on the Gospel of St. John, referring to the passage in which Mary Magdalene is represented as looking into the Holy Sepulchre and seeing two angels in white, one sitting at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of the Saviour had lain, he makes the following reflection:  
“Angels to be desired at our feet as well as at our head—not an angelical understanding and a diabolical conversation—not all our religion in our brains and tongue, and nothing in our heart and life.”  
In the same spirit, commenting on the chapter of Acts, where Jesus says to St. Paul, who had fallen to the earth under the light which shined round about him from heaven, “Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou shalt do,” he subjoins this as the proper deduction from the passage: “It is not the talking, but the walking and working person that is the true Christian.”  
On doctrinal points, the following brief memoranda and references taken from many others of a like character, may serve to show both his orthodoxy and his penetration:  
“Omnisciency—God’s foreknowledge doth not compel, but permits to be done.” Acts, ch. II. v. 23.  
  
“Christ’s divinity appears by St. John, ch.

We now proceed to state the more direct evidence of the  
sinful imperfection of all the saints in this life.  
  
. The first argument is derived from the direct testimony  
  
of the Bible  
  
Not a single text can be adduced, which, properly under-  
stood, attributes perfection to good men in this life. On the  
contrary, the criminal imperfection of them all is most plainly  
asserted. Witness Eccl. vii. 20: “Tor there is not a just  
man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not.” It is as  
evident from this passage that no one on earth is_ perfectly  
holy, as that any are imperfect. Prov. xx. 9: “ Who can  
say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin ?”

ND REACTION OF TALE-  
BEARING AND BACKBITING,.  
  
  
  
  
  
Some of the pithiest and profoundest pro-  
verbs are shot from God’s quiver against the  
sin of slander. Take, for example, in one  
bundle, the passage in the 26th chapter of the  
Book of Proverbs, from the 18th verse to the  
close. “ As a mad man, who casteth firebrands,  
arrows, and death, so is the man that deceiveth  
his neighbor, and saith, Am not | in sport?  
Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out;  
so, where there is no tale-bearer, the strife  
ceaseth. As coals are to burning coals, and wood  
to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife.  
The words of a tale-bearer are as wounds, and  
they go down into the innermost parts of the  
belly. Burning lips and a wicked heart are  
like a potsherd covered with silver dross. He  
that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and  
layeth up deceit within him. When he speak-  
eth fair, believe him not; for there are seven  
abominations in his heart. Whose hatred is  
covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be  
showed before the whole congregation. Who-  
so diggeth a pit, shall fall therein ; and he tha
