The question arose as to the bearing of the ecclesiastical law of the  
realm upon the civil rights, respectively, of Bohun and the bishop.  
Prisot, who appears as judge, says in substance, that the rights of  
the parties are to be ascertained by a reference to the ecclesiastical  
and civil laws, respectively, as to their bearing on the case. His  
words are as follows: ‘‘ A tel leis que ils de Seint Eglise ont en

1613, which reads as follows: ‘*To such laws of the church as  
have warrant in holy scripture our law giveth credence.” For  
authority Finch refers to Prisot, in the case already cited. He  
converts ‘‘ ancien scripture,” or canon law, into ‘* Holy Scripture,”  
and puts the duty upon common law courts of deciding how far  
English ecclesiastical law is in accordance with Holy Scriptures,  
which is a total misapprehension of the sense of the Year Book.  
  
We may remark, in passing, that Jefferson confounds the  
author of Finch’s Law, the book which he quotes, with Heneage  
Finch, Lord Nottingham, who was made Chancellor in the reign  
of Charles the Second. The author of Finch’s Law was Sir Henry
