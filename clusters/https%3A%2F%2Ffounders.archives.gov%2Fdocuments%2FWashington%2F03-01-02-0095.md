They are to furnish themselves accordingly—The Serjeants may be distinguished by an Epaulette, or stripe of red Cloth, sewed upon the right shoulder; the Corporals by one of green.  
The people employed to make spears, are desired by the General to make four dozen of them immediately, thirteen feet in lenght, and the wood part a good deal more substantial than those already made, particularly in the New Hampshire Lines, are ridiculously short and light, and can answer no sort of purpose, no more are therefore to be made on the same model.  
The Commanding Officers of the different works and posts, are once more enjoined, to furnish themselves with a sufficient Number of Gabions and Fascines, which are to stop up the Entrances of their respective Redoubts and Lines; and to repair their works which may either be damaged by the weather, or the Fire of the enemy; it is observed that several of the Entrances of the Redoubts, are still left open without any sort of defence; The Commanding Officers of each Redoubt, are therefore ordered to cut a wide deep ditch, at the entrances, and throw a bridge of strong plank across; this to be done without delay.

guish the Commissioned Officers from the  
non-Commissioned, and the non-Commission-

badges of distinction may be immediately

The people employe&lt;l to make spears are  
desired by the General to make four dozen  
of them immediately, thirteen feet in length,  
and the wood part a good deal more substan¬  
tial than those alre^y made, particularly

fore are to be made on the same model.  
  
The commanding Officers of the different  
works and posts are once more enjoined to  
furnish themselves with a sufficient number  
of Gabions &amp; Fascines which are to stop up  
the entrance of their respective redoubts &amp;  
lines, and to repair their works, which may  
either be damaged by the weather or the fire  
of the enemy. It is observed that several  
of the entrances and redoubts are still left  
open, without auy sortof defence. The Com¬  
manding Officers of each redoubt are there¬  
fore ordered to cut a wide deep ditch at the  
entrances, and throw a bridge of strong plank  
across; this is to be done without delay.

Col. Gridley’s Regt. of Artillery, tried for  
desertion and suspicion of intending to go to  
the enemy is acquitted by the General Court  
Martial.  
  
Ensign Foster accused by Col. Scamman  
of abusive and insulting language to the said  
Col. Scamman while under arrest by a Gen¬  
eral Court .Martial of which Col. John Nix¬  
on was President, the Court were unanimous¬  
ly of opinion that the prisoner is not guilty  
and do therefore acquit him with honor.  
Lieut Trofton to be forthwith released from  
his arrest Michael Beny, Capt Packer’s  
Company and Col. Prescott’s R^t tried by  
the same General Court Martial for refusing
