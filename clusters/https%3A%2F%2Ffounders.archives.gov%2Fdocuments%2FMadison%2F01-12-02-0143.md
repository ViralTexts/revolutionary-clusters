[17 June 1789]  
  
  
Debate continued on the clause in the bill establishing a foreign affairs department that declared the secretary could be removed from office by the president.  
  
  
Mr. Madison. However various the opinions which exist upon the point now before us, it seems agreed on all sides, that it demands a careful investigation and full discussion. I feel the importance of the question, and know that our decision will involve the decision of all similar cases. The decision that is at this time made will become the permanent exposition of the constitution; and on a permanent exposition of the constitution will depend the genius and character of the whole government. It will depend, perhaps, on this decision, whether the government shall retain that equilibrium which the constitution intended, or take a direction toward aristocracy, or anarchy among the members of the government. Hence how careful ought we to be to give a true direction to a power so critically circumstanced. It is incumbent on us to weigh with particular attention the arguments which have been advanced in support of the various opinions with cautious deliberation. I own to you, Mr. Chairman, that I feel great anxiety upon this question; I feel an anxiety, because I am called upon to give a decision in a case that may affect the fundamental principles of the government under which we act, and liberty itself. But all that I can do on such an occasion is to weigh well every thing advanced on both sides, with the purest desire to find out the true meaning of the constitution, and to be guided by that, and an attachment to the true spir

o the point in question. The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Sherman) has advanced a doctrine which was not touched upon before. He seems to think (if I understood him right), that the power of displacing from office is subject to legislative discretion; because it having a right to create, it may limit or modify as is thought proper. I shall not say but at first view this doctrine may seem to have some plausibility: But when I consider, that the constitution clearly intended to maintain a marked distinction between the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of government; and when I consider, that if the legislature has a power, such as contended for, they may subject, and transfer at discretion, powers from one department of government to another; they may, on that principle, exclude the president altogether from exercising any authority in the removal of officers; they may give it to the senate alone, or the president and senate combined; they may vest it in the whole congress, or they may reserve it to be exercised by this house. When I consider the consequences of this doctrine, and compare them with the true principles of the constitution, I own that I cannot subscribe to it.  
Another doctrine which has found very respectable friends, has been particularly advocated by the gentleman from South-Carolina (Mr. Smith). It is this; when an officer is appointed by the president and senate, he can only be displaced from malfeasance in his office by impeachment: I think this would give a stability to the executive department so far as it may be described by the heads of departments, which is more incompatible with the genius of republican government in general, and this constitution in particular, than any doctrine which has yet been proposed. The danger to liberty, the danger of mal-administration has not yet been found to lay so much in the facility of introducing improper persons into office, as in the difficulty of displacing those who are unworthy of the public trust. If it is said that an officer once appointed shall not be displaced without the formality required by impeachment, I shall be glad to know what security we have for the faithful administration of the government. Every individual in the long chain which extends from the highest to the lowest link of the executive magistracy, would find a security in his situation which would relax his fidelity and promptitude in the discharge of his duty.  
The doctrine, however, which seems to stand most in opposition to the principles I contend for, is that the power to annul an appointment is in the nature of things incidental to the power which makes the appointment. I agree that if nothing more was said in the constitution than that the president, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, should appoint to office, there would be great force in saying that the power of removal resulted by a natural implication from the power of appointing. But there is another part of the constitution no less explicit than the one on which the gentleman’s doctrine is founded, it is that part which declares, that the executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States. The association of the senate with the president in exercising that particular function, is an exception to this general rule; and exceptions to general rules, I conceive, are ever to be taken strictly. But there is another part of the constitution which inclines in my judgment, to favor the construction I put upon it; the president is required to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. If the duty to see the laws faithfully executed be required at the hands of the executive magistrate, it would seem that it was generally intended he should have that species of power which is necessary to accomplish that end. Now if the officer when once appointed, is not to depend upon the president for his official existence, but upon a distinct body (for where there are two negatives required either can prevent the removal), I confess I do not see how the president can take care that the laws be faithfully executed. It is true by a circuitous operation, he may obtain an impeachment, and even without this it is possible he may obtain the concurrence of the senate for the purpose of displacing an officer; but would this give that species of control to the executive magistrate which seems to be required by the constitution? I own if my opinion was not contrary to that entertained by what I suppose to be the minority on this question, I should be doubtful of being mistaken, when I discovered how inconsistent that construction would make the constitution with itself. I can hardly bring myself to imagine the wisdom of the convention who framed the constitution, contemplated such incongruity.  
There is another maxim which ought to direct us in expounding the constitution, and is of great importance. It is laid down in most of the constitutions or bills of rights in the republics of America, it is to be found in the political writings of the most celebrated civilians, and is every where held as essential to the preservation of liberty, That the three great departments of government be kept separate and distinct; and if in any case they are blended, it is in order to admit a partial qualification in order more effectually to guard against an entire consolidation. I think, therefore, when we review the several parts of this constitution, when it says that the legislative powers shall be vested in a Congress of the United States under certain exceptions, and the executive power vested in the president with certain exceptions, we must suppose they were intended to be kept separate in all cases in which they are not blended, and ought consequently to expound the constitution so as to blend them as little as possible.  
Every thing relative to the merits of the question as distinguished from a constitutional question, seems to turn on the danger of such a power vested in the president alone. But when I consider the checks under which he lies in the exercise of this power, I own to you I feel no apprehensions but what arise from the dangers incidental to the power itself; for dangers will be incidental to it, vest it where you please. I will not reiterate what was said before with respect to the mode of election, and the extreme improbability that any citizen will be selected from the mass of citizens who is not highly distinguished by his abilities and worth; in this alone we have no small security for the faithful exercise of this power. But, throwing that out of the question, let us consider the restraints he will feel after he is placed in that elevated station. It is to be remarked that the power in this case will not consist so much in continuing a bad man in office, as in the danger of displacing a good one. Perhaps the great danger, as has been observed, of abuse in the executive power, lies in the improper continuance of bad men in office. But the power we contend for will not enable him to do this; for if an unworthy man be continued in office by an unworthy president, the house of representatives can at any time impeach him, and the senate can remove him, whether the president chuses or not. The danger then consists merely in this: the president can displace from office a man whose merits require that he should be continued in it. What will be the motives which the president can feel for such abuse of his power, and the restraints that operate to prevent it? In the first place, he will be impeachable by this house, before the senate, for such an act of maladministration; for I contend that the wanton removal of meritorious officers would subject him to impeachment and removal from his own high trust. But what can be his motives for displacing a worthy man? It must be that he may fill the place with an unworthy creature of his own. Can he accomplish this end? No; he can place no man in the vacancy whom the senate shall not approve; and if he could fill the vacancy with the man he might chuse, I am sure he would have little inducement to make an improper removal. Let us consider the consequences. The injured man will be supported by the popular opinion; the community will take side with him against the president; it will facilitate those combinations, and give success to those exertions which will be pursued to prevent his re-election. To displace a man of high merit, and who from his station may be supposed a man of extensive influence, are considerations which will excite serious reflections beforehand in the mind of any man who may fill the presidential chair; the friends of those individuals, and the public sympathy will be against him. If this should not produce his impeachment before the senate, it will amount to an impeachment before the community, who will have the power of punishment by refusing to re-elect him. But suppose this persecuted individual, cannot obtain revenge in this mode; there are other modes in which he could make the situat

## Removal Power of the President, [17 June] 1789

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

 We have seen examples in the history of other nations, which justifies the remark I now have made. Though the prerogatives of the British king are great as his rank, and it is unquestionably known that he has a positive influence over both branches of the legislative body, yet there have been examples in which the appointment and removal of ministers has been found to be dictated by one or other of those branches. Now if this is the case with an hereditary monarch, possessed of those high prerogatives and furnished with so many means of influence; can we suppose a president elected for four years only dependent upon the popular voice impeachable by the legislature? Little if at all distinguished for wealth, personal talents, or influence from the head of the department himself; I say, will he bid defiance to all these considerations, and wantonly dismiss a meritorious and virtuous officer? Such abuse of power exceeds my conception: If any thing takes place in the ordinary course of business of this kind, my imagination cannot extend to it on any rational principle. But let us not consider the question on one side only; there are dangers to be contemplated on the other. Vest this power in the senate jointly with the president, and you abolish at once that great principle of unity and responsibility in the executive department, which was intended for the security of liberty and the public good. If the president should possess alone the power of removal from office, those who are employed in the execution of the law will be in their proper situation, and the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest officers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as they ought, on the president, and the president on the community. The chain of dependence therefore terminates in the supreme body, namely, in the people; who will possess besides, in aid of their original power, the decisive engine of impeachment. Take the other supposition, that the power should be vested in the senate, on the principle that the power to displace is necessarily connected with the power to appoint. It is declared by the constitution, that we may by law vest the appointment of inferior officers, in the heads of departments, the power of removal being incidental, as stated by some gentlemen. Where does this terminate? If you begin with the subordinate officers, they are dependent on their superior, he on the next superior, and he on whom?—on the senate, a permanent body; a body, by its particular mode of election, in reality existing for ever; a body possessing that proportion of aristocratic power which the constitution no doubt thought wise to be established in the system, but which some have strongly excepted against: And let me ask gentlemen, is there equal security in this case as in the other? Shall we trust the senate, responsible to individual legislatures, rather than the person who is responsible to the whole community? It is true the senate do not hold their offices for life, like aristocracies recorded in the historic page; yet the fact is they will not possess that responsibility for the exercise of executive powers which would render it safe for us to vest such powers in them. But what an aspect will this give to the executive? Instead of keeping the departments of government distinct, you make an executive out of one branch of the legislature; you make the executive a two-headed monster, to use the expression of the gentleman from New-Hampshire (Mr. Livermore); you destroy the great principle of responsibility, and perhaps have the creature divided in its will, defeating the very purposes for which an unity in the executive was instituted. These objections do not lie against such an arrangement as the bill establishes. I conceive that the president is sufficiently accountable to the community; and if this power is vested in him, it will be vested where its nature requires it should be vested; if any thing in its nature is executive it must be that power which is employed in superintending and seeing that the laws are faithfully executed; the laws cannot be executed but by officers appointed for that purpose; therefore those who are over such officers naturally possess the executive power. If any other doctrine be admitted, what is the consequence? You may set the senate at the head of the executive department, or you may require that the officers hold their places during the pleasure of this branch of the legislature, if you cannot go so far as to say we shall appoint them; and by this means you link together two branches of the government which the preservation of liberty requires to be constantly separated.  
Another species of argument has been urged against this clause. It is said, that it is improper, or at least unnecessary to come to any decision on this subject. It has been said by one gentleman, that it would be officious in this branch of the legislature to expound the constitution, so far as it relates to the division of power between the president and senate; it is incontrovertably of as much importance to this branch of the government as to any other, that the constitution should be preserved entire. It is our duty, so far as it depends upon us, to take care that the powers of the constitution be preserved entire to every department of government; the breach of the constitution in one point, will facilitate the breach in another; a breach in this point may destroy that equilibrium by which the house retains its consequence and share of power; therefore we are not chargeable with an officious interference; besides, the bill, before it can have effect, must be submitted to both those branches who are particularly interested in it; the senate may negative, or the president may object if he thinks it unconstitutional.  
But the great objection drawn from the source to which the last arguments would lead us is, that the legislature itself has no right to expound the constitution; that wherever its meaning is doubtful, you must leave it to take its course, until the judiciary is called upon to declare its meaning. I acknowledge, in the ordinary course of government, that the exposition of the laws and constitution devolves upon the judicial. But, I beg to know, upon what principle it can be contended, that any one department draws from the constitution greater powers than another, in marking out the limits of the powers of the several departments. The constitution is the charter of the people to the government; it specifies certain great powers as absolutely granted, and marks out the departments to exercise them. If the constitutional boundary of either be brought into question, I do not see that any one of these independent departments has more right than another to declare their sentiments on that point.  
Perhaps this is an omitted case. There is not one government on the face of the earth, so far as I recollect, there is not one in the United States, in which provision is made for a particular authority to determine the limits of the constitutional division of power between the branches of the government. In all systems there are points which must be adjusted by the departments themselves, to which no one of them is competent. If it cannot be determined in this way, there is no resource left but the will of the community, to be collected in some mode to be provided by the constitution, or one dictated by the necessity of the case. It is therefore a fair question, whether this great point may not as well be decided, at least by the whole legislature, as by a part, by us as well as by the executive or judicial? As I think it will be equally constitutional, I cannot imagine it will be

e there is a desire in all to see, and be guided by the benignant ray of truth, that the decision may be made with the most advantage by the legislature itself.  
My conclusion from these reflections is, that it will be constitutional to retain the clause; that it expresses the meaning of the constitution as must be established by fair construction, and a construction which, upon the whole, not only consists with liberty, but is more favorable to it than any one of the interpretatio

from one department to another—that they may narrow the ex­  
ecutive, confer new powers on the Senate, and enlarge the gene­  
jal mr.fsoft eir own authority; when I consider the confequcn­  
ces of this do&amp;rine, and compare them with the true objects o!  
theco&#x27; ftitution, I own I cannot subscribe to it.  
Another do&amp;rine, which has a very rcfpeftable patronage, is  
that when an officer is appointed, he can be removed only by im­  
peachment, for some mifdemcanor in office. This would give  
a permanency to the executive system, which would be more in­  
compatible with the genius of repubheanifm thnn any principle  
that could be advocated. The danger to liberty, the danger of  
despotism has never been found to spring so much from the diffi­  
culty of procuring virtuous men to fill the officcs of government  
as the difficulty of displacing those who have been found un­  
worthv of trull. If it be said that an officer when once appoint­  
ed, should not be removed without a crime and eonvi&amp;ion, I  
  
would be clad to know what security there would be for a faith­  
rul administration of the government.—Every individual between  
the highest aud lowest link irt the long chain of executive magif­  
racy, would find a security, which would gteatly relax his fide­  
lity in the discharge of his duty.  
Ado&amp;riiie which Hands most in opposition with the principle  
we have contended for, is, that the power to make appointments  
mplies in its own nature a power of removal as incidental to it.  
If nothing more was said in the constitution than that the Presi­  
dent, with the Senate, should appoint officers, there would be  
forcein the observation, that the power of difmifling results from  
the power of appointing. But, Sir, there is another part of the  
onftitution as explicit as that on which the gentlemen found their  
doctrine : It is that which declares that the executive power lhall  
&#x27;»e vested in the Prefidcnt of the United States. The afl&#x27;ociation  
of the Senate with the President in the exercise of one particular  
executive function, is an exception to this gen-r il principle; and  
xceptions to general rules are ever taken ftri&amp;ly. But there is  
still another part of the constitution. which in my judgment,  
clearly favors the conftruflion I give. The Prefidcnt is required,  
Sir, to take care that thelaws be faithfully executed. Ifthefaith­  
ul execution of the laws be required at the hands of the executive  
magistrate, it should seem that in general the constitution mull  
have intended that he should have that species of power m all its

head of the executive department. You may dcclare thai ?1I oft&quot;

But, Sir, another lpecies of argument has been  
urged againlt the claufe—lt has been laid that it  
is improper or at lealt unneceflary to come to any  
decillon on the lubjedt. It has been laid that it will  
be officious in this branch cf the legislature to&quot;  
expound the conllitution, so far as relates to  
tliediviiion of power between the President and  
Senate. Sir, it is undoubtedly of as much im­  
portance to thjs branch as to any other, that the  
constitution Ihould be preserved entire : It is our  
duty as well as interejl to take care that its prin­  
ciples be adhered to. A breach of the conllitu­  
tiou in one point may lead toabreachin another.  
A breach in this point may destroy that equilibri­  
um in the government, by which this House  
maintains its Share of authority.—l do not think  
we can be charged with officious interference, as  
this bill before it can have effect, is to be Submit­  
ted to both those branches who are particularly  
intercfted in it. The Senate may negative it—  
The President may objedt to it.  
Sir, an objection Strongly urged is, that the  
legislature itfelf has 210 right to expound the  
constitution ; that whenever its meaning is doubt­  
ful, you mult leaye it undecided till the judiciary  
Shall be called on to declare its meaning. I con­  
ceive, that in the ordinary coutfe of things, the  
exposition of the conllitution devolves on the ju­  
diciary. But I beg toknow 011 what principle it  
can be contended that any one department de­  
rives from the conllitution greater powers than  
another, in declaring what are the true limits of  
the conllitution. We have a great charter which  
afligns certain great boundariesand fences to the  
Several departments of government; if these conr  
ftitutional boundaries be brought into quellion,  
I cannot conceive why any one of those inde­  
pendent branches has npt a right to exprel&#x27;s its  
sentiments.  
This is perhaps an omitted cafe ; there is no  
one government that I know of, in which provi­  
sion is made for a particular authority to deter­  
mine the great conftitutionaj limits, and the great  
division or power between the branches ot go­  
vernment. In all systems there are points which  
must be fettled by the branches theinfelves, and  
to which no other power is competent. If they  
cannot be, there is no resource left, but the will  
of the community to be colle&lt;fted, cither by the  
mode which our conllitution provides, or by a  
mode dictated bynecelfity. It is therefore a fair  
quellion before us, whpthertjie great point may  
not as well be decided by the whole legillaturc as  
by a part—by us, as well as by the executive or  
the judiciary. As it will be equally conllitution­

If there is any part of the government from  
which an opinion on this capital point can come  
with lingular advantage, it is this house, who be­  
ing not so immediately interelled can form their  
opinion, and express their sense with less bias  
than any other. My conclulion from these re­  
flections is, that the clause is perfedly constitu­  
tional ; that it exprefles the meaning of the con­  
llitution as a fair conltruction mull explain it,  
and that it is not only conlillent with liberty, but  
more favorable to. it than any other poilible in­

president) will be impeachable by this house before the Senate  
for such an act of mal-administration; for I contend, that the wan-  
ton removal of meritorious men, would subject him to impeach-

when the removal is wanton, and the officer meritorious? How  
may these charges be’so strictly and directly proved, as to pro-  
duce or even warrant a conviction? If Mr. Madison relied on  
this for his opinion, he would probably give it up now. Finally,  
this power was affirmed by the vote of 34 againt 20—in the House

“The doctrine, however, which seems to stand most in op  
position to the principles I contend for, is, that the power to  
annul an appointment. I agree that if nothing more was said  
in the constitution than that the president, by and with the ad-  
vice and consent of the senate, should appoint to office, there  
would be great force in saying that the power of removal re-  
sulted by a natural implication from the power of appointing.  
But there is another part of the constitution, not less explicit  
than the one on which the gentleman’s doctrine is founded; it  
is that part which declares that the executive power shall be  
vested in a president of the United States.  
  
_ “The association of the senate with the president in exercis-  
ing that particular function, is an exception to this general rule;  
and exceptions to general rules, I conceive, are ever to be taken  
strictly. But there is another part of the constitution which  
inclines, in my judgment, to favor the construction | put upon  
it; the president is required to take care that the laws be faith-  
fully executed. If the duty to eee the laws faithfully executed  
  
required at the hands of the executive magistrate, it would  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
a a  
  
  
  
seem that it was generally intended he should have that species  
of power which is necessary to accomplish thatend. Now, if  
the officer, when once appointed, is not to depend upon the  
president for his official existence, but upon a distinct body,  
(for where there are two negatives required, either can prevent  
the removal), I confess I do not see bow the president can take  
care that the laws be faithfully executed. It is true, by a cir-  
cuitous Operation, he may obtain an impeachment, and even  
without this it is possible he may Obtain the concurrence of the  
senate for the purpose of displacing an officer; but would this  
give that species of control to the executive magistrate which  
seems to be required by the constitution? I own, if my opinion  
was not contrary to that entertained by what I suppose to be  
the minority on this question, I should be doubtful of being  
mistaken, whea I discovered how inconsistent that construc-  
tion would make the constitution with itself. I ean hardly  
bring myself to imagine the wisdom of the convention who  
framed the constitution contemplated such incongruity.’  
  
But, sir, if doubts could arise on the language of the consti-  
tution itself, then it would become proper, for the purpose of  
ascertaining the true meaning of the instrument, to resort to

The most plausible reasoning brought forward on that occa-  
sion may be fairly stated thus: **The executive power is vested  
in the president, this is the general rule of the conatitution; the  
association of the senate with the president, in exercising a par-  
ticular function belonging to the executive power, is an excep-  
tion to this general rule, and exceptions to general rules are to  
be taken strictly; therefore, though the senate partakes of the  
appointing power, by express provision, yet, as nothing is said  
of its participation in the removing power, such participation is  
to be excluded.”’ -  
  
The crror of this argument, if [ may venture to call it so, con-  
sidering who used it, lies in this. It supposes the power of re-  
moval to be holden by the president under the general grant of  
executive power. Now it is certain that the power of appoint

come the permanent exposition of the  
Constitution; and on a permanent exposi-

“There is another maxim which ought  
to direct us in expounding the Constitu-  
tion, and is of great importance, It is  
laid down in most of the Constitutions, or  
bills of rights, in the republics of Ame-  
rica; it is to be found in the political writ-  
ings of most celebrated civilians, and is  
  
THE PRESIDENTS POWERS OF REMOVAL,  
  
  
  
(April,  
  
everywhere held essential to the preserva-  
tion of liberty. That the three great de-  
partments of government be kept separate  
and distinct, and, if in any case, they are  
blinded, it is in order to admit a practical  
qualification, in order more effectually to  
guard against an entire consolidation. I  
think, therefore, when we review the seve-  
ral parts of this Constitution, where it  
says that the legislative powers shall be  
vested in a Congress of the United States  
under certain exceptions, and the execu-  
tive power vested in the President, with  
certain exceptions, we must suppose they  
were intended to be kept separate in all  
cases in which they are not blended, and  
ought, consequently, to expound the Con-  
stitution so as to blend them as little as  
possible. * * * Vest the powers of re-  
moval in the Senate, jointly with the Pre-  
sident, and you abolish at once the great  
principle of unity and responsibility in the  
executive department, which was intended  
for the security of liberty and the public  
good. If the President should alone pos-  
sess the power of removal from office,  
those who are employed in the execution  
of the law will be in their proper situation,  
and the chain of dependence be preserved;  
the lowest officer, the middle grade, and  
the highe.t, will depend on the President,  
and the President on the community. The  
chain of dependence, therefore, terminates  
in the supreme body—namely, the peo-  
ple. ”  
  
What Mr. Madison meant was  
that the President cannot be an-  
swerable to the Senate for the exer-  
cise of his executive powers of re-  
moval, as his responsibility termi-  
nates not in the Senate but in the  
whole people who elected him. The  
Constitution imposes a check upon  
the character of executive appoint-  
ments by referring them to the Se-  
nate for confirmation, but here the

“Take the other supposilion, that the  
power of removal should be vested in the  
Senate, on the principle that the power to  
displace is necessarily connected with the  
power to appoint. It is declared by the  
Constitution, that we may by law vest the  
appointment of inferior officers in the  
heads of departments, the power of re-  
moval being incidental, as stated by some  
gentlemen. Where does this terminate?  
If you begin with the subordinate officers,  
they are dependent on their superior, he  
on the next superior, and he on whom ?—  
on the Senate, a permanent body, by its  
peculiar mole of election, in reality exist-  
ing forever—a body possessing that por-  
tion of aristocratic power which the Con-  
stitution, no doubt, thought wise to be  
established in the system, but which some  
have strongly excepted against. And let  
meask, gentlemen, is there equal security  
in this case as in the other? Shall we  
trust the Senate, responsible to individual  
legislatures, rather than the person who is  
responsible to the whole community? It  
is true, the Senate do not hold their offices  
for life, like aristocracies, recorded in the  
historic page; yet, the fact is, they will not  
possess that responsibility tor the exercise  
of executive powers which would render  
it safe for us to vest such powers in them.  
What an aspect will this give to the ex-  
ecutive! Instead of keeping the depart-  
ments of government distinct, you make  
an executive out of one branch of the  
legislature; you make the executive a two-  
headed monster, to use the expression of  
the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.  
L vermore); you destroy the great princi-  
ple of resp nsibility, and, perhaps, have  
the cresiure divided in its will, defeating  
the very pur, oses for which an unity in  
the executive was instituted. * * * If  
anything in its nature is executive, it must  
be that p wor which is employed in super-  
intending and seeing that the laws are  
fiithfuily executed; the laws cannot be  
executed but by officers appointed for that  
purpose; therefore, those who are over  
  
WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE SENATE,  
  
243  
  
such officers naturally possess ‘the exect-  
tive power. If any other doctrine is ad-  
mitted, what is the consequence? You  
may set the Senate at the head of the ex-  
ecutive department, or you may rquire  
that the officers hold their places during  
the pleasure of this branch of the legisla-  
ture, if you cannot go so far as to say we  
shall appoint them; and by this means  
you link together two bianches of the  
Government which the preservation of  
liberty requires to be constantly separat-  
ed.”  
  
Such were the unanswerable ar-  
guments of the great man who has  
been called the “father of the Con-  
stitution.” Arguments delivered at  
the very foundation of the Consti-  
tution, when its character and de-  
sign were fresh in the minds of its  
framers. To the same effect we can  
quote another of the greatest minds  
of our constitutional perid. We re-  
fer to Fisher Ames, who said :  
  
*« The question, so far as it relates to the  
Constitution, is this: whether it has vested  
the sole power of removing in the Presi-  
dent alone, cr whether it is to take place b

The next question which it is proper te  
ask is. For what crimes and misdemeanors  
may; an officer be impeached? Can he be  
impeached for any other than an indictable J  
offense? The authorities certainly sustain  
the managers in asserting that he may be.  
We cannot search through all the case, as  
they are too numerous, but will call the at­  
tention of the Senate to some that should  
be regarded as good authority, and the opin­  
ions of those who should be regarded as  
learned in the law. &#x27;,  
Mr. Madison, in discussing the power of

The application of some competitive

be supplemented by requiring the Pres-

He expressed it as his opinion that under the Constitution  
the power of removal from offices filled by the President  
with the advice and conseht of the Senate rested in the  
President alone. But did he think that the President  
had the lawful power to remove meritorious officers  
merely to put party friends in their places? Let us hear  
him: ‘‘ The President who does that,’’ said Madison,  
‘‘will be impeachable by the House before the Senate  
for such an act of maladministration, for I contend that

the wanton removal of meritorious officers would subject

the spoils system still flourished as  
rankly in England as it does now in Ame-  
rica. In reading the debate of which his  
speech formed a part, it is impossible not  
to be reminded of that other debate a cen  
tury ago, as to where, under the Federal  
Constitution, the power of removal from  
office is lodged; for it was in the course  
of that early discussion that James Madi-  
son declared that a President who  
removed a faithful official in order  
to make room for a_ political friend  
of his own, would he ‘‘impeachable by  
the House before the Senate for such  
an act of maladministration; for I con-

ritorious ofticer would subject him to im-  
peachment and removal from his high  
trust.”” While Americans must regret that  
during the hundred years which have since  
elapsed our country has fallen so far away  
from Madison’s standard, they can take  
courage in the reflection that the Prime  
Minister of a country in which, when  
Madison spoke, the misuse of patronage
