Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:  
					United States, January 6, 1800.  
				  
				In compliance with the request in one of the resolutions of Congress, of the 21st of December last, I transmitted a copy of those resolutions by my Secretary, Mr. Shaw, to Mrs. Washington, assuring her of the profound respect Congress will ever bear to her person and character; of their condolence in the late afflicting dispensation of Providence, and entreating her assent to the internment of the remains of General George Washington, in the manner expressed in the first resolution.
