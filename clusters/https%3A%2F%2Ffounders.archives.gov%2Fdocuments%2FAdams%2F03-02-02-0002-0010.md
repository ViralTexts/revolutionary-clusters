The principle as laid down by Blackstone is that it “ cannot  
be forfeited, cancelled, or altered by any change of time, place,  
  
or circumstance, nor by anything but the united concurrence  
of the legislature. For it is a principle of universal law,  
  
that the natural-born subject of one prince cannot by any  
act of his own, not even by swearing allegiance to another,  
put off or discharge his natural allegiance to the former ;  
for this natural allegiance was intrinsic and primitive, and  
antecedent to the other, and cannot be divested without the
