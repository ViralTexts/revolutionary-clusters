Sir  
Head Quarters Cambridge Augt 19th 1775.  
  
I address’d you on the 11th Instant in Terms which gave the fairest Scope, for the Exercise of that Humanity &amp; Politeness, which were supposed to form a Part of your Character—I remonstrated with you, on the unworthy Treatment shewn to the Officers, and Citizens of America, whom the Fortune of War, Chance, or a mistaken Confidence had thrown into your Hands. Whether British, or American Mercy, Fortitude, &amp; Patience are most preeminent; whether our virtuous Citizens whom the Hand of Tyranny has forced into Arms, to defend their Wives, their Children, &amp; their Property; or the mercenary Instruments of lawless Domination, Avarice, and Revenge best deserve the Appellation of Rebels, and the Punishment of that Cord, which your affected Clemency has forborne to inflict; Whether the Authority under which I act is usurp’d, or founded on the genuine Principles of Liberty, were altogether foreign to my Subject. I purposely avoided all political Disquisition; nor shall I now avail myself of those Advantages, which the sacred Cause of my Country, of Liberty, and human Nature give me over you. Much less shall I stoop to Retort, &amp; Invective. But the Intelligence, you say, you have received from our Army requires a Reply. I have taken Time, Sir, to make a strict Inquiry, and find it has not the least Foundation in Truth. Not only your Officers, and Soldiers have been treated with a Tenderness  
  
due to Fellow Citizens, &amp; Brethren; but even those execrable Parricides, whose Counsels &amp; Aid have deluged their Country with Blood, have been protected from the Fury of a justly enraged People. Far from compelling, or even permitting their Assistance, I am embarassed with the Numbers who crowd to our Camp animated with the purest Principles of Virtue, &amp; Love of their Country.  
You advise me to give free Operation to Truth, to punish Misrepresentation &amp; Falshood. If Experience stamps Value upon Counsel, yours must have a Weight which few can claim. You best can tell, how far the Convulsion which has brought such Ruin on both Countries, and shaken the mighty Empire of Brittain to its Foundation, may be traced to those malignant Causes.  
You affect, Sir, to despise all Rank not derived from the same Source with your own. I cannot conceive any more honourable, than that which flows from the uncorrupted Choice of a brave and free Poeple—The purest Source &amp; original Fountain of all Power. Far from making it a Plea for Cruelty, a Mind of true Magnanimity, &amp; enlarged Ideas would comprehend &amp; respect it.  
What may have been the ministerial Views which precipitated the present Crisis, Lexington—Concord, &amp; Charlestown can best declare—May that God to whom you then appealed, judge between America &amp; you! Under his Providence, those who influence the Councils of America, and all the other Inhabitants of these united Colonies, at the Hazard of their Lives, are resolved to hand down to Posterity those just &amp; invaluable Privileges which they received from their Ancestors.  
I shall now, Sir, close my Correspondence with you, perhaps forever. If your Officers who are our Prisoners receive a Treatment from me, different from what I wish’d to shew them, they, &amp; you, will remember the Occasion of it. I am Sir, Your very Hbble Servant

Whether British or American iner-l

forced into arms, to defend their wives,

deserve the appellation of rebels, and

your affected clemency has forborne to  
inflict; whether the authority under  
which I act is usurped, or founded up­

You best can tell how far the convul-;

‘* * Head-Quarters, Cambridge, 20 August, 1775.  
  
‘sé Srr,—I addressed you, on the 11th instant, in terms which gave the  
fairest scope for that humanity and politeness which were supposed to  
form a part of your character. I remonstrated with you on the unworthy  
treatment shown to the officers and citizens of America, whom the fortune  
of war, chance, or a mistaken confidence, had thrown into your hands.—  
Whether British or American mercy, fortitude, and patience are most pre-  
eminent; whether our virtuous citizens, whom the hand of tyranny has  
forced into arms to defend their wives, their children, and their property,  
or the mercenary instruments of lawless domination, avarice, and revenge,  
best deserve the appellation of rebels, and the punishment of that cord,  
which your affected clemency has forborne to inflict; whether the authority  
under which I act is usurped, or founded upon the genuine principles of  
liberty, were altogether foreign to the subject. I purposely avelden all  
political disquisition; nor shall I now avail myself of those advantages,  
which the sacred cause of my country, of liberty, and of human nature,  
give me over you; much less shall I stoop to retort and invective ; but the  
intelligence you say you have received from our army requires a reply.—  
I have taken time, sir, to make a strict inquiry, and find it has not the  
least foundation in truth. Not only your officers and soldiers have been  
treated with the tenderness due to fellow citizens and brethren, but even  
those execrable parricides, whose counsels and aid have deluged their  
country with blood, have been protected from the fury of a justly enraged  
people. Far from compelling or permitting their assistance, I am embar-  
rassed with the numbers who crowd to our camp, animated with the purest  
principles of virtue and love to their country.  
  
‘« You advise me to give free operation to truth, and to punish misrepre-  
sentation and falsehood. If experience stamps value upon counsel, yours  
must have a weight which few can claim. You best can tell how far the  
convulsion, which has brought such ruin on both countries, and shaken the  
mighty empire of Britain to its foundation, may be traced to these malig-  
nant causes.  
  
*¢¢ You affect, sir, to despise all rank not derived from the same source  
with your own. I cannot conceive one more honorable than that which  
flows from the uncorrupted choice of a brave and free people, the purest  
source and original fountain of all power. Far from making it a plea for  
cruelty, a mind of true magnanimity and enlarged ideas would comprehend  
and respect it.  
  
«6 ¢ What may have been the ministerial views, which have precipitated the  
  
resent crisis, Lexington, Concord, and Charlestown can best declare.—  
May that God, to whom you then appeal, judge between America and you.  
Under his providence, those who influence the counsels of America, and  
all the other inhabitants of the United Colonies, at the hazard of their lives,  
are determined to hand down to posterity those just and invaluable privi-  
leges, which they received from their ancestors.  
  
‘¢¢] shall now, sir, close my correspondence with you, perhaps for ever.  
If your officers, our prisoners, receive a treatment from me different from  
that which I wished to show them, they and you will remember the occa-  
sion of it. Iam sir, your very humble servant.’ ”’

August 1!», 177&quot;&gt;.  
  
Sik:— I addressed you on the eleventh in-  
stant in terms which gave the fairest scope  
for the exercise of that humanity and po-  
liteness which were supposed to form a part  
of your character; I remonstrated with you  
OB the unworthy treatment shown to the  
ollicers and citizens ol America, whom the  
fortune of war, ehanos Of I mistaken confi-  
dence had thrown into foor hands.  
  
Whether British or American mercy, for-  
titude aud patience are moat pre aaiiaent,  
whether our virtuous citizens whom the  
hand of tyranny has forced into arms, to  
defend their w ives, their children, and their  
property, OT the mercenary instruments of  
law less domination, avarice and revenge,  
best deserve the appellation of rebels aud  
the punishment of that cord which your af-  
fected ( leniency has forborne to inflict,  
w iiether the authority under which I act is  
usurped or founded upon the genuine prin-  
ciples of libertv, ware altogether foreign to  
the subject, l purposely avoided all polit-  
ical disquisition; nor shall 1 now a\ait my-  
self of these advantages which the sacred  
cause of my country, of liberty aud human  
nature give me ever you, much less shall I  
stoop to retort an invective. Rut the intel-  
ligence you have received from our army  
requires a reply. I have taken time, sir, to  
make a strict &quot;inquiry, and find it has not  
the least foundation in truth. Not only  
your officers and soldiers have been treat-  
ed with a tenderness due to fellow-citizens  
and brethern.but oven those execrable par-  
aeides, whose counsels and aid have dtl-  
uged their country with blood, have hata  
protected from the fury of a justly enraged  
people. Far from compelling or permit-  
ttag their assistance, I am embarrassed  
w ith the numbers w ho crowd to our camp,  
animated with the purest principles of vir-  
tue and love of their country.  
  
You advise mc to give free operation to  
truth, to* punish misrepresentation and  
falsehood. It experience stamps value  
upon counsel, yours must have a weight  
which few can claim. You liest can tell  
how far the convulsion, which has brought  
ruin on both countries and shaken the  
mighty empire of Hritaiu to its foundation,  
may be traced to these maliguant causes.  
  
lou allect, sir, to despise all rank not de-  
rived from the same source as your own. I  
cannot conceive one more honorable than  
that which flows from the uncorrupted  
choice of a brave and free people, the purest  
source and original fountain of all pow er.  
Far from making it a plea for cruelty, a  
mind of true magnanimity and enlarged  
ideas would comprehend and respect u.  
What may have been the ministerial views  
which have precipitated the present crisis,  
Lexington, Concord and Charleatown can  
best declare. May that Ciod to whom you  
  
vou.  
  
Under his Providence those who inihi-  
eaee the counsels of America and all tin-  
other inhabitants of the I&#x27; nited Colonies, at  
the hazard of their lives, are determined to  
hand down to posterity those just and in-  
valuable privileges which they received  
from their ancestors. I shall now, sir,  
close my correspondence with you, perhaps  
forever. If your oilicers, our prisoners, re-  
ceive a treatment dilferent from what I  
wish to show them, they and you will re-  
member the occasion of it  
  
I am, sir, roar aery humble servant
