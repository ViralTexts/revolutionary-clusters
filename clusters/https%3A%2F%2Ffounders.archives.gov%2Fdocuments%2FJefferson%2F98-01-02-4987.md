Th: Jefferson to Th: Jefferson Smith.Monticello  
Feb. 21. 1825.This letter will, to you be as one from the dead, the writer will be in the grave before you can weigh it’s counsels. your affectionate and excellent father has requested that I would address to you something which might possibly have a favorable influence on the course of life you have to run, and I too, as a namesake, feel an interest in that course. few words will be necessary with good dispositions on your part. adore God. reverence and cherish your parents. love your neighbor as yourself, and your country more than yourself. be just. be true. murmur not at the ways of Providence. so shall the life into which you have entered be the Portal to one of eternal and ineffable bliss. and if to the dead it is permitted to care for the things of this world, every action of your life will be under my regard. farewell.The portrait of a good man by the most sublime of Poets, for your imitationLord, who’s the happy man that may To thy blest courts repair,Not, stranger-like, to visit them, But to inhabit there?‘Tis he whose every thought and deed By rules of virtue moves;Whose generous tongue disdains to speak The things his heart disproves.Who never did a slander forge His neighbor’s fame to wound;Nor hearken to a false report By malice whispered round.Who vice, in all it’s pomp and power, Can treat with just neglect;And piety, tho’ cloath’d in rags, Religiously respect.Who, to his plighted vows and trust Has ever firmly stood;And, tho’ he promise to his loss, He makes his promise good.Whose soul in usury disdains His treasure to employ;Whom no rewards can ever bribe The guiltless to destroy.The man who, by this steady course, Has happiness ensur’d,When earth’s foundations shake, shall stand, By Providence secur’d.A Decalogue of Canons for observation in practical life.1. Never put off till tomorrow what you can do to-day.2. Never trouble another for what you can do yourself.3. Never spend your money before you have it.4. Never buy a what you do not want, because it is cheap; it will be dear to you.5. Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold.6. We never repent of having eaten too little.7. Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly.8. How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened!9. Take things always by their smooth handle.10. When angry, count ten, before you speak; if very angry, an hundred.

THE TRUE GENTLEMAN.  
BT OOCVERNIEn MORRI8.  
Tis he whose every thought and deed  
By rule of virtue moves ;  
Whose generous tongue disdains to speak  
The thing his heart disproves  
Who never did a slander forge,  
. His neighbor&#x27; famo to wound ;  
Nor hearken to a false report  
By malice whispered round.  
Who vice in all its pomp and power  
Can treat with Just neglect ;  
And piety, though clothed in rags,  
Religiously respect.  
Who to his plighted word and trust  
&#x27; lias ever firmly stood ;  
And, though he promise to his loss,  
lie makes his promise good.  
Whose soul in usury disdains  
His treasure to employ ;  
Whom no rewards can ever bribo  
The guiltless to destroy.

the late Thomas Jefferson in the fourth volume,

MoNTIcElEO, FEE. 21, 1895.  
This letter will to you be as one from the  
dead. The writer will be in the grave before yow  
can weigh its counsels. Your affectionate and  
excellent Father has requested that I should ad­  
dress you something on the course of life you  
have to run: And I too as a name sake feel  
an interest in that course. dore God; reverence  
and cherish your parents. Serve your neighbor  
as yourself, and your country more than  
yourself. Be just--be true. Murmur not at  
the ways of Providence. So shall the life into  
which you have entered be the portel to one  
of inesfable bliss. And if to the dead it is per­  
mitted to care for the things of this world, every  
action of your life will be under my regard   
Farewell. THJEerSON

A LETTER WRITTEN BY THOMAS JEFFERSON A LITTLE  
WHILE BEFORE HIS DEATH.  
  
“Tus letter will, to you, be as one from the dead. The writer  
will be in the grave before you can weigh its counsels. Your  
affectionate and excellent father has requested that I would address  
to you something which might possibly have a favorable influence  
on the course of life you have run; and I too, as a namesake, feel  
an interest in that course. Few words will be necessary, with  
good disposition on your part. Adore God. Reverence and  
cherish your parents. Love your neighbor as yourself, and your  
country more than yourself. Be just. Be true. Murmur not at  
the ways of Providence. So shall the life into which you have  
entered be the portal to one of eternal and ineffable bliss. And,  
if to the dead it is permitted to care for the things of this world,  
every action of your life will be under my regard. Farewell.
