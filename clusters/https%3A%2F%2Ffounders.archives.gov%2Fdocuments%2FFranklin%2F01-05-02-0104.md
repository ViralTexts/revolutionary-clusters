Council were to raise and pay soldiers, and build forts for the  
defence of any of the Colonies, equip vessels of war to guard  
the coasts and protect the trade upon the ocean, lakes and  
great rivers ; but not to impress men in any Colony without the  
consent of the Legislature.  
  
For the purposes enumerated, they had power to make  
laws, and lay and levy such general duties, imposts or taxes, as  
to them shall appear most equal and just, (considering the  
ability and other circumstances of the inhabitants in the seve-  
ral Colonies), and such as may be collected with the least in-  
convenience to the people; rather discouraging luxury, than  
loading industry with unnecessary burdens.  
  
They were to appoint a general treasurer, and particular  
treasurers in each government when necessary ; no money to  
be paid except to the joint order of the President and Council,  
unless when provided for by standing law to be paid to the  
order of the President alone.  
  
The accounts were to be annually settled and reported to  
the several colonial assemblies.  
  
A quorum of the Grand Council, competent to act with the  
President, was to consist of twenty-five members; among  
whom was to be one or more from a majority of the Colonies.  
  
The laws passed by the Grand Council were not to be re-  
pugnant to the laws of England, but as near as possible in  
harmony with them, and were to be transmitted to England  
for the approbation of the King in council, and if not disap-  
proved within three vears after presentation, remained in  
force. &#x27;  
  
On the death of the President General, the speaker of the  
Grand Council succeeded to his place, till the King’s pleasure  
was known.

All military officers, by land and sea, were to be nominated

civil officers to be nominated by the council and confirmed by  
the President. Incase of death or removal of any officer, civil  
or military, ‘ under this Constitution,’ the Governor of the Pro-
