The Secretary of the Treasury in obedience to the order of the House of Representatives, of the 15. day of January 1790, has applied his attention, at as early a period as his other duties would permit, to the subject of manufactures and particularly to the means of promoting such, as will tend to render the United States independent on foreign nations, for military and other essential supplies: And he thereupon respectfully submits the following report.  
The expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United States, which was not long since deemed very questionable, appears at this time to be pretty generally admitted. The embarrassments, which have been imposed upon obstructed the progress of our external foreign trade, have led to serious reflections on the necessity of enlarging the sphere of our domestic commerce: the restrictive regulations, which in foreign markets abrige the vent of the increasing surplus of our Agricultural produce, in foreign markets, naturally serve to beget a an earnest desire, that a more extensive demand for that surplus may be created at home: And the complete success, which has rewarded manufacturing enterprise, in some valuable branches, concurringconspiring with the promising symptoms which attend some less mature essays, in others,

it is not difficult to find in its further extension a full in its extension, may be found, an indemnification for any external disadvantages for the effects of those external impediments which resist the tide of our prosperity, and obstruct which are or may be experienced; as well as an an accession of resources, favourable to national independence and safety.  
There still are nevertheless, respectable patrons of opinions, unfriendly to the encouragement of manufactures. The following are, substantially, the arguments by which support these opinions are defendedsupported.  
“In very country (’tis alleged) (say those who entertain them) Agriculture is the most beneficial and productive object of human industry. This position generally if not universally true, applies with peculiar emphasis to the United States, on account of their immense tracts of fertile territory uninhabited and unimproved. Nothing can afford so advantageous an employment for capital and labour, as the conversion of   
  
Qr 4  
  
so this [extensive] rude vast wilderness into cultivated farms. Nothing, equally with this, can contribute to the population strength and real riches of the country.”  
  
“To endeavour, by the extraordinary patronage of Government, to accelerate the growth of manufactures, is in fact, to endeavour, by force and art, to transfer the natural current of industry, from a more to a less beneficial channel. Whatever has such a tendency must necessarily be unwise.   
  
Qr 5  
  
Indeed, it can hardly ever [be proper] wise in a government to attempt to give a direction to the industry of its citizens: This, under the quick-sighted guidance of private interest, will, if left to itself, infallibly find its own way to wherever it can meet with[into channels where] the most profitable employment: and ’tis by such employment, that the public prosperity will be most effectually promoted. To leave industry to itself, therefore, is in almost every case the soundest as well as the safest of the simplest policy.”  
“This policy is not only recommended to the United States, by considerations which affect all nations—it is, in a manner, dictated to them   
  
Qr  
  
by the imperious force of a very peculiar situation. The smallness of their population compared with their territory—the constant allurements to emigration from the settled to the unsettled parts of the country—the facility, with which the less independent situation condition of an artisan can be exchanged for the more independent condition of a farmer—these and similar causes conspire to produce, and for a length of time, must continue to occasion, a scarcity of hands for manufacturing occupations, and dearness of labour generally. To these disadvantages for the prosecution of manufactures, a deficiency of pecuniary capital being added, the prospect of a successful competition with the manufacturers of Europe must be regarded as little less than desperate. Extensive manufactures can only be the offspring of a redundant, at least of a full population. Till the latter shall characterise the situation of this country, ’tis vain to hope for the former.”  
“If contrary to the natural course of things, an unseasonable and premature spring can be given to certain fabrics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, bounties, or by by other forced expedients; this will only be to sacif sacrifice the interests of the community to those of particular classes. Besides the misdirection of labour, a virtual monopoly will be given to the persons employed on such fabrics; and an enhancement of price, the inevitable consequence of every monopoly, must be defrayed at the expence of the other parts of the society. It is far preferable, that those persons should be engaged in the cultivation of the earth, and that we should produc procure, in exchange for with its productions, the commodities, with which foreigners are able to supply us in greater perfection, and upon better terms.”  
This mode of reasoning is founded upon facts and principles, and is espoused which have certainly very respectable pretensions. If it had governed the conduct of nations, more generally than it has done, there is room to suppose, that it mightwould have carried them faster to prosperity and greatness, than they have attained, by the pursuit of maxims too widely far opposite. Most general theories, however, admit of numerous exceptions; and there are few if any of the political kind, which do not blend a considerable portion of error, with the truths they contain inculcate. That, which has been stated, does not, it is presumed, steer clear of this imputation. In order to an accurate judgment how far this may be the case, it is necessary to advert to the considerations which are to be found in a contrary scale, and which appear to recommend the positive and special encouragement of manufactures in countries where they do not happen to prevail and particularly in the United States.  
In order to an accurate judgment how far that which has been just stated ought to be deemed liable to a similar imputation, it is necessary to advert carefully to the considerations which plead in favour of manufactures, and which, appear to recommend the special and positive encouragement of them; in certain cases, and under certain reasonable limitations.  
It ought readily to be conceded that the cultivation of the earth—as the primary and most certain source of national supply—as the immediate and chief source of subsistence to man—as the principal source of those materials which constitute are the nutriment of other kinds of labour—as including a state most favourable to the freedom and independence of the human mind—one, perhaps, most conducive to the multiplication of the human species, has intrinsically a strong claim to pre-eminence over every other kind of industry.  
But that it has a title to any thing like an exclusive predilection in any country, ought to be admitted with great caution—That it is even more productive than every other branch of Industry requires more evidence   
  
Qr  
  
than has yet been given, in support of the position—That its real interests, precious and important as, without the help of exaggeration, they truly are, may be will be advanced rather than injured by the due encouragement of manufactures, may, it is believed presumed, be fairly [clearly] satisfactorily demonstrated—And it is also it is believed that the expediency of such encouragement, in a general view may be shewn to be recommended in other respects by resulting from the by the most

cogent and persuasive motives of national policy, may be placed in a light, which it is believed, can leave little room for question or doubt.  
It has been maintained, not only that Agriculture is, not only, the most productive, but the only productive species of industry. The reality of this suggestion in either aspect has, however, not been verified by any accurate detail of facts and calculations; and the general arguments, which are adduced to prove   
  
Qr.  
  
it, are rather subtil and paradoxical than solid or convincing.  
Those which maintain its exclusive productiveness are to this effect—  
Labour, bestowed upon the cultivation of land, produces enough, not   
  
☞  
  
only to replace all the necessary expences incurred in the business, and to maintain the persons who are employed in it, but to afford, together with the ordinary profit on the stock or capital of employed by the Farmer, a nett surplus, or rent for the landlord or proprietor of the soil. But the labour of Artificers does nothing more, than replace the stock which employs them (or which furnishes materials tools and wages) and yield the ordinary profit upon that stock. It yields yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land. Neither does it add any thing to the total value of the whole annual produce of the land and labour of the country. The additional value given to those parts of the produce of land, which are wrought into manufactures, is counterballanced by the value of those other parts of that produce, which are consumed by the manufacturers. It can therefore only   
☞ Qr.  
be by saving, or parsimony, not by the positive productiveness of their labour, that the classes of Artificers can in any degree augment the nett revenue or income of the Society.  
To this system, it has been answered—  
I.   That inasmuch as it is acknowleged, that manufacturing labour reproduces a value equal to that, which is expended or consumed in carrying it on, and continues in existence the original stock or capital employed—it ought, on that account alone, ought to escape being considered as wholly unproductive: That though it should be admitted, as alleged, that the consumption of the produce of the soil, by the classes of Artificers or manufacturers, is exequactly equal to the value added by their labour to the materials upon which it is exerted bestowed; yet it would not thence follow, that it added nothing to the Revenue of the Society, or to the aggregate value of the annual produce of its land and labour. If the consumption for any given period amounted to a given sum and the increased value of the produce manufactured, in the same period, to a like sum, the total amount of the consumption and production, during that period, would be equal to the two sums, and consequently double the value of the agricultural produce consumed. And though the increment of value of produced by the classes of Artificers should at no time exceed the value of the produce of the land consumed by them, yet there would be at every moment, in the market consequence of their labour, a greater value of goods in the market, than would exist independent of it.  
That as far as it is true that the labour of of Artificers can  
II.   That the position, that Artificers can augment the nett revenue of a Society, only by parsimony, is true in no other sense than in one which is equally applicable to Husbandmen or the Cultivators. It may be alike affirmed of all these different classes, that the fund acquired by their labour and destined for their support is not, in an ordinary way, more than   
[profits may arise from Sales to foreign Nations]  
equal to it. And hence it will follow, that augmentations of the wealth or capital or wealth of the community (except in the instances of some extraordinary dexterity or skill) can only proceed, with respect to any of them, from the savings of the more thrifty and parsimonious. ext except in the instances of some extraordinary dexterity or skill.  
III.   That the annual produce of the land and labour of a country can only be increased in two ways—by some improvement in the productive powers of the useful labour, which actually exists within it, or by some increase in the quantity of that such labour: That with regard to the first, the labour of artificers being capable of greater subdivision and simplicity of operation than that of cultivators, it is susceptible, in a proportionably greater degree, of improvement in its productive powers, whether to be derived from an accession increase of skill or from the applicable application of   
  
☞  
  
ingenious machinery; in which particular, therefore, the labour employed in the culture of land can pretend to no advantage over that engaged in manufactures: That with regard to an augmentation of the quantity of useful labour, this, excluding adventitious circumstances, must depending essentially upon an increase of capital, which again must depend upon the savings made out of the revenues of those, who furnish or manage that, which is at any time employed, whether in Agriculture, or in Manufactures, or in some any other way.  
But while the exclusive productiveness of Agricultural labour has been thus denied and refuted, the superiority of its productiveness has been conceded without hesitation. As the prevalent opinion in this country corresponds with this concession, and as it involves a point of considerable magnitude, in relation to maxims of public administration, it seems nece the grounds on which it rests are worthy of seem to require a distinct and particular examination.  
One of the arguments made use of, in support of the idea may be is not less pronounced both quaint than and superficial. It amounts to this—That in the productions of the soil, nature cooperates with man; and it is inferred, that the effect of their joint labour must be greater than that of the labour of man alone.  
This however is far from being a necessary inference. It is very   
  
art and ingenuity  
  
conceivable, that the labour of man alone bestowed laid out upon an a work, requiring great skill and art to bring it to perfection, may be more productive in value, than the labour of nature and man combined, when directed towards more simple operations and objects: And when it is recollected, to what an extent the agency of nature, in the application of the mechanical powers, is made auxiliary to the prosecution of manufactures, little more than the quaintness of the suggestion remains the suggestion, which has been noticed, loses even the appearance of plausibility.  
It might also even be observed, with a contrary view, that in Agriculture the labour of man employed in Agrec Agriculture is in a great measure periodical and occasional, depending on seasons, and liable to various and long intermissions; while that occupied in many manufactures is constant, and regular, incessant, extending through the years, embracing in some instances night as well as day. It is also probable that there are among the cultivators of land more examples of remissness than among artificers. The farmer, may from the peculiar fertility of his land or some other favourable circumstance may frequently obtain a livelihood, even with a considerable degree of carelessness in the mode of cultivation; but the Artisan Greater ingenuity as well as steadiness can with difficulty effect the same objects withoutunless exerting himself pretty equally with all those who are engaged in the same pursuit. And if it may likewise be assumed as a fact, that manufactures open a wider field to exertions of ingenuity than agriculture, it would not be a strained conjecture, that the labour employed in the former, being at once more constant more uniform and more ingenious, than that which is employed in the latter, will be found at the same time moremost pro productive.  
But it is not meant to lay great stress on observations of this nature —they ought only to serve to as a counter a counter ballance to those of a similar complexion. Circumstances so vague, and general, as well as so abstract, can afford little instructionlight, in a matter of this kind.  
Another, and that which seems to be the principal argument, that has been offered for the superior productiveness of Agricultural Labour, turns upon the allegation, that labour employed in manufactures yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land; or to that nett surplus, as it is called, which accrues to the proprietor of the soil.  
But this distinction, important as it has been deemed, appears rather verbal than substantial.

nary profit on the stock or Capital of the Undertaker.”  
It is easily discernible, that what in the first instance case is divided into two parts under the denominations of the ordinary profit of the stock of the farmer and rent to the landlord is, in the second instance case united under the simple general appellation of the ordinary profit on of the stock of the Undertaker; and that this formal or verbal distribution constitutes the whole difference in the two cases. It seems to have been overlooked, that the land is itself a stock or capital, advanced or lent by its owner to the occupier or tenant, and that the rent he receives is only the ordinary profit of a certain stock in land, not managed by the proprietor himself but by another to whom he lends or lets it, and who on his part advances a second capital to stock and improve cultivate the land, upon which he also receives the usual profit. The rent of the landlord, and the profit of the farmer are therefore nothing more than the ordinary profits of two capitals, belonging to two different persons, and united in the cultivation of a farm: As in the other case, the surplus which arises upon any manufactory, after replacing the expences of carrying it on, corresponds with answers to the ordinary profits of one or more capitals engaged in the prosecution of sucha manufactory. It is said, one or more capitals; because in fact, the same thing which is contemplated in the case of the farm, sometimes happens in respect to that of a manufactory. There is one who lends furnishes a part of the capital, or lends a part of the money, by which it is carried on, and another, who carries it on, with the addition of his own capital. Out of the surplus, which remains arises, after defraying expences, an interest is paid to the money-lender for the portion of the capital adv furnished by him which corresponds with exactly agrees with the rent paid to the landlord; and the residue of that surplus constitutes the profit of the undertaking undertaken ce undertaker or manufacturer, which and agrees with what is denominated the ordinary profits on the stock of the farmer. Both together make amount to the ordinary profits of two capitals employed in a manufactory; as in the other case the rent of the landlord and the revenue of the farmer compose constitute the ordinary profits of two capitals employed in the cultivation of a farm.  
The rent therefore accruing to the proprietor of the land, far from being a criterion of exclusive productiveness as has been argued, is no criterion even of superior productiveness. The question must still be, whether the surplus, after defraying expences, of a given capital employed in the purchase andor improvement of a piece of land is greater or less than that of a like capital employed in the prosecution of a manufactory: or whether the whole value produced from a given capital and a given quantity of labour, employed in one way, be greater or less, than the value whole net value produced from an equal capital and an equal quantity of labour employed in the other way: or rather, perhaps, whether the business of Agriculture or that of Manufactures will yield the greatest product, according to a compound ratio of the quantity of Capital &amp; the quantity of labour, employed which are employed in the one or in the other.  
The solution of either of these questions is not easy; it involves numerous and capit complicated details, depending on an accurate knowlege of the objects to be compared. It is not known that the comparison has ever yet been made upon sufficient data properly ascertained and analized. To do be able to make it on the present occasion with satisfactory precision, and certainty, would req demand more previous inquiry and investigation than there has been hitherto either leisure or opportunity to accomplish. Some essays however have been made towards acquiring the requisite information; the result of which does b by no means confirm the hypothesis of the superior productiveness which is under examination.

te an opinion a supposition that manufacturing industry is more productive than that of Agriculture. They are intended rather to shew that the reconverse of this proposition is not ascertained; and that the general arguments which are brought used to establish it are not satisfactory; and consequently that a supposition of the superior productiveness of Tillage ought to be no obstacle to listening to any substantial inducements to the encouragement of manufactures, m which may be otherwise perceived to exist; on the ground if its as having a through an apprehension that they may have atendency to   
[The two employments will regulate themselves—If manufactures will consume produce, Agriculture must produce for Manufactures.]  
divert labour from a more to a less profitable employment.  
It is extremely probable, that on a full and accurate developpement of the manner matter, on the basis ground of fact and calculation, it would be discovered, that there is no material difference between the aggregate productiveness of the one and of the other kind of industry in question; and that the propriety of the encouragements, which may in any case be proposed to be given to either ought to be determined upon considerations irrelative to any exclusive of all comparison of that nature.  
  
in respect to respecting its encouragement to view the subject  
  
But without contending for the superior productiveness of Manufacturing Industry, it may conduce to a better judgment of the policy which ought to be pursued,it would be to omit doing justice to the subject not to place it in some farther light under respecting its encouragement, to view to contemplate the subject under some additional aspects, tending not only  to evince still further not only that it not only to confirm the idea still further that this kind of Industry has been improperly represented as unproductive in itself; but to evince in addition that the establishment to fur shew likewise that the establishment and diffusion of manufactures have the effect of rendering the total mass of the useful and productive labour, in a community, greater than it would otherwise be. In prosecuting this discussion, it may be necessary briefly to resume and review some of the topics which have been already touched.  
To affirm that the labour of the Manufacturer is unproductive, because he consumes as much of the produce of land, as he adds value to the raw materials, which he manufactures, is not better founded, that it would be to affirm, that the labour of the farmer, which furnishes materials to the manufacturer, is unproductive because he consumes an equal value of manufactured articles. Each furnishes a certain portion quantum of the produce of his labour to the other and each destroys a correspondent portion quantum of the produce of the labour of the other. In the mean time, the maintenance of two citizens instead of one is going on, the state has two members instead of one; and they together consume twice the value of what is produced from the land.  
If instead of a farmer and artificer, there were a farmer only, he would be under a necessity of devoting a part of his labour to the fabrication of cloathing and other articles, which he would procure of the artificer if there were in the case of there being such a person; and of course he would be able to devote less labour to the cultivation of his farm, and would draw from it a proportionably less product.quantity of produce. The whole quantity of production, in this state of things, in provisions raw materials and manufactures, would certainly not exceed in value the amount of what would be produced in provisions and raw materials only, if there were an artificer as well as a farmer.  
Again—if there were both an artificer and a farmer, the latter would be left at liberty to pursue exclusively the cultivation of his farm. A greater quantity of provisions and raw materials would of course be produced—equal at least, as has been already observed, to the whole amount of the provisions raw materials and manufactures which would exist on a contrary supposition. The artificer, at the same time, would be going on in the production of manufactured commodities, articles to an amount sufficient not only to repay the farmer, in those commodities, for the provisions and materials which were procured from him, but to furnish the Artificer himself with a supply of similar commodities for his own use. Thus then, there would be two quantities or values in existence instead of one; and the income revenue and consumption would be double in one case, what it would be in the other.  
If in place of both these suppositions, there were supposed to be two farmers, and no artificer, each of whom applied a part of his labour to the culture of his land and another part to the fabrication of manufactures—in this case, the portion of the labour of both which was each bestowed upon land would produce the same quantity of provisions and raw materials only as would be produced by the intire sum of the labour of one applied in the same manner, and the portion of the labour of both which was bestowed upon manufactures, would produce the same quantity of manufactures only, as would be produced by the intire sum of the labour of one applied in the same manner. Hence the value of the produce of the labour of the two farmers would not be greater than that of the produce of the labour of the farmer and artificer; and hence, it results is manifest, that the labour of the artificer is as positively productive as that of the farmer, and, as positively, augments the revenue of the Society.  
The labour of the Artificer replaces to the farmer that portion of his labour, with which he provides the materials of exchange with the Artificer, and which he would otherwise have been compelled to apply to manufactures: and while the Artificer thus enables the farmer to enlarge his stock of agricultural industry, a portion of which he purchases for his own use, he also supplies himself with the manufactured articles of which he stands in need. thus producing over and above the equivalent which he gives to the farmer.  
He does still more. Besides this equivalent which he gives for the portion of agricultural labour consumed by him and this supply of manufactured commodities for his own consumption use—he furnishes still a surplus, which compensates for the use of the Capital advanced either by himself or some other person, for carrying on the business. This is the ordinary profit of the stock employed in the manufactory, and is in every sense respect as effective an addition to the income of the Society as the rent of land.  
The produce of the labour of the Artificer, consequently, may justly be regarded as composed of three parts; one by which the provisions for his subsistence and the materials for his work are purchased of the farmer, one by which he supplies himself with manufactured necessaries, and a third which constitutes the profit on the Stock employed. The two last portions seem to have been overlooked in the system, which represents manufacturing industry as an barren and unproductive.  
In the course of the preceding illustrations the products of equal quantities of the labour of the farmer and artificer have been treated as if equal to each other. Simplicity and perspicuity required this mode of expression, but it will not be understood as being indicating an intention to assert an exact equality in the value of the produce of But this is not to be understood as intending to assert any such precise equality. It is merely a manner of expression adopted for the sake of simplicity and perspicuity. Whether the value of the produce of the labour of the Farmer be some what more or less than that of the Artificer is not material to the main scope of the argument which hitherto has only aimed at shewing, that the one, as well as the other, occasions a positive augmentation of the total produce and revenue of the Society.  
It is now the proper to proceed a step a further, and to enumerate the principal circumstances, from whichwhence it may be inferred—That manufacturing establishments not only occasion a positive augmentation of the Rev Produce and Revenue of the Society, but that they contribute essentially to rendering them greater than they could possibly be, without such establishments. These circumstances are—  
  
  
  
1  
The effects of a division of Labour  
  
  
2  
An extension of the use of Machinery  
  
  
3  
The Additional employment  to classes of the community not regularly ordinarily engaged in the business  
  
  
4  
  
[and the acquisition of foreign Capital—]  
The promoting of emigration from foreign countries   
  
  
5  
The furnishing greater scope for the diversity of talents and dispositions which are to be foundamong the citizens of a Country which discriminate men from each other.  
  
  
6  
The affording a more ample and various field for enterprize.  
  
  
7  
The creating in some instances a new, and securing in all, a more certain and steady demand for the surplus produce of the soil.  
  
  
Each of these circumstances has a considerable influence upon the total mass of industrious effort in a community: Together, they increase it and enhance add to it a degree of energy force and effect, which are not easily conceived. Some commentsremarks upon each of them in the order in which they have been stated may serve to explain their importance.  
I   As to the Division of Labour.  
It has justly been observed, that there is sac scarcely any thing of greater moment,importance in the œconomy of a nations, than the proper division of labour. The separation of occupations causes each to be carried on to much greater perfection, than it could possibly acquire, if they were blended. This arises principally from three circumstances—  
1 One The greater skill and dexterity naturally resulting from a constant and undivided application attention to a single object. It is evident that these properties must increase, in proportion to the separation and simplification of objects and the steadiness of the attention devoted to each; and must be less, in proportion to the complication of objects, and the number among which the attention is destracted.  
2 Another is The œconomy of time—by avoiding that the loss of it, which is naturally incident to a frequent transition from one operation to another, of a different nature. This depends on various circumstances—the transition itself—the ordinary orderly disposition of the implements, machines and materials employed in the operation to be relinquished—the preparatory steps to the commencement of a new one—the interruption of the impulse which the mind of the workman acquires from being engaged in a particular operation—the distractions hesitations and reluctances, which are apt to attend the passage from one kind of business to another.  
3 The third is An extension of the use of machinery. A man occupied on a single object will have it more in his power, and will be more naturally led to exert his imagination, invention in devising methods to facilitate and abrige labour, than if he were perplexed by a variety of independent and dissimilar operations. Besides this, the fabrication of machines, in numerous instances, becoming itself a distinct trade, the Artist who follows it, has all the advantages which have been enumerated, for improvement in his particular art; and, in both ways the invention and application of machinery are extended.  
And from these causes united, the meremere [mere] separation of the occupation of the Cultivator, from that of the Artificer, has the effect of augmenting the productive powers of labour, and with them, the total mass of the produce or revenue of a Country. In this single view of the subject, therefore, the utility of Artificers or Manufacturers, towards promoting an increase of productive industry, is apparent.  
II   As to an extension of the use of Machinery: a point which has been already, in part though partly anticipated, but which requires to be placed in some one or two additional lights.  
The employment of Machinery seems to forms an item of great   
[unincumbered too by the expence of Compensation.] ☞  
importance in the general mass of national industry. ’Tis an artificial force brought in aid of the natural force of man; and, to all the proposes of labour, is an increase of hands; an accession of strengths unincumbered too by the expence of maintaining the labourer.. May it not therefore be fairly inferred, that those occupations, which give greatest scope to the use of this auxiliary, contribute most to the general stock of industrious effort, and, in consequence, to the general product of Industry?  
It shall be taken for granted, and the truth of the position referred to observation, that manufacturing pursuits are more susceptible in a greater degree of the application of Machinery, for than those of Agriculture. If so, all the difference is lost to a country community, which, instead of manufacturing for itself, procures the fabrics requisite to itsthe supply of its wants, from other countries. The substitution of foreign for domestic manufactures is a transfer to foreign nations of the advantages accruing from the employment of Machinery in the modes, in which it is capable of being employed, with most utility and to the greatest extent.  
  
a Cotton mill ☞  
  
The Cotton Mill invented in England, within the last twenty years, is a signal illustration of the general proposition, which has been just advanced. In consequence of it, all the different processes for spining cotton are performed by means of machines, which are put in motion by water and attended chiefly by women and children; the a very small number of whom compared with the number requisite in the ordinary mode of spinning, suffices. And it is an advantage of great moment that the operations of this mill continue with convenience during the night, as well as through the day. The prodigious effect of such a machine is easily conceived. To this invention is to be attributed essentially the vast immense progress, which has been so suddenly made in great Britain, in the rela various fabrics of cotton.  
III   As to the additional employment of classes of the community, not ordinarily engaged in the particular business—  
This is not among the least valuable of the means, by which manufacturing institutions contribute to augment the general stock of industry and production. In places two towns and neighbourhoods, where those institutions prevail, they give employment besides the persons regularly engaged in them, they afford occasional and extra employment to industrious individuals and families, who are willing to devote the leisure resulting from the intermissions of their ordinary occupations pursuits to collateral labours, as a resource for the mean of multiplying their acquisitions or their enjoyments.

of the neighbouring manufactories. in his vicinity.  
  
Besides this advantage of additionaloccasional employment to classes otherwise occupied having different other occupations, there is anotherare others of a nature allied to it, and which have of a similar tendency. This is the employment of persons, who would otherwise be idle (and in many cases a burthen on the community); who either from the byass of temper, habit, infirmity of body, or some other cause, indisposing, or disqualifying them for the toils of the Country. and of Children at an earlier period It is worthy of particular remark that in general Women and Children are rendered more useful and the latter more early useful by manufacturing establishments than they would otherwise be. Of the number of persons employed in the cotton manufactories of Great Britain it is computed that 4/7 nearly are women and children, of whom the greatest proportion are children and many of them of a very tender age.  
And thus it appears to be one of the attributes of manufactures, and one of no small consequence, importance to give occasion to the exertion of a greater quantity of Industry, even by the same number of persons, wherever they happen to prevail, than would exist, if there were no such establishments.  
IV   As to the promoting of emigration from foreign Countries.  
Men reluctantly quit one course of occupation and livelihood for another, unless invited to it by very apparent and proximate advantages. Many, who would go from one country to another, if they had a prospect of continuing with more benefit the callings, to which they are have been educated, will often not be tempted to change their situation by the possibility hope of doing better, in some other way. Manufacturers, who listening to the powerful invitations of a better price for their fabrics or their labour, of greater cheapness of provisions and raw materials, of an exemption from the chief part of the taxes burthens and restraints, which they endure with which they are vexed in the old world, of greater personal independence and consequence, under the operation of a more equal government and of what is far more precious than mere the more than religious toleration—a perfect equality of religious privileges;—would probably flock from Europe to the United States to pursue their own trades or professions, if they were once made sensible of the advantages they would enjoy, and were inspired with an assurance of encouragement and employment, will, with difficulty, be induced to transplant themselves, with a view to becoming Cultivators of land.  
If it be true then, that it is the interest of the United States to open every possible avenue to emigration from abroad it well affords a a procee weighty argument for the encouragement of manufactures; which for the reasons just assigned will have the strongest tendency to multiply the inducements to it.  
Here isare perceived not only an important resource, not only for extending the population, and with it the useful and productive labour of the country, but likewise for the prosecution of manufactures, without deducting from the number of hands, which might otherwise be drawn to Tillage; and even for the indemnification of agriculture for such as might happen to be diverted from it. Many, whom manufacturing views would originally induce to emigrate, would afterwards yield to the temptation which the particular situation of this Country holds out to Agricultural pursuits. And while Agriculture would in other respects derive many signal and unmingled advantages from the growth of manufactures, it is a problem whether it would gain or lose, as to the article of the nu numbers of persons hands employed in carrying it on.  
V   As to the furnishing greater scope for the diversity of talents and dispositions, which discriminate men from each other.  
It is a s  
This is a much more powerful mean of augmenting the fund of national Industry than may at first sight appear. It is a true just observation, that minds of the strongest and most active powers for their proper objects fall below mediocrity and labour without effect if confined to uncongenial pursuits. And it is thence to be inferred, that the results of human exertion may be immensely increased by diversifying its objects. When all the different kinds of industry obtain in a community, each individual can find his proper element, and can call into activity the whole vigour of his nature. And the community is benefitted by the services of its respective members, in the manner, in which each can serve it with most effect.  
If there be any thing in a remark often to be met with—namely that there is, in the genius of the people of this country, a peculiar aptitude for mechanic improvements, it would operate as a forcible reason for giving opportunities to the exercise of that species of talent, by the propagation of manufactures.  
VI   As to the affording a more ample and various field for enterprise.  
This also is of greater consequence in the general scale of national use exertion, than might perhaps on a superficial view be supposed, and has effects not altogether dissimilar from those of the circumstance last noticed. To cherish and stimulate the activity of the human mind, by multiplying the objects of enterprise, is not among the least considerable of the expedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be promoted. Things Even things, in themselves not positively advantageous, sometimes   
  
☞  
  
become so, by their tendency to provokeexcite exertion. Every new scene which is opened to the busy nature of man to rouse and exert itself is the addition of a new energy to the general stock of efforts.  
The spirit of enterprise, useful and prolific as it is, must necessarily be contracted or expanded in proportion to the simplicity or variety of the occupations and productions, which are to be found in a Society. It must be less in a nation of mere cultivators, than in a nation of cultivators and merchants; less in a nation of cultivators and merchants than in a nation of cultivators, artificers, and merchants.  
VII   As to the creating, in some instances, a new, and securing in all a more certain and steady demand for the surplus produce of the soil—  
This is among the most important of the of all the circumstances, which have been indicated, stated is is perhaps the most important. It is a principal mean, by which the establishment of manufactures contributes to an augmentation of the produce or revenue of a country; It and has in particular an immediate and direct influence upon relation to the prosperity of Agriculture.  
It is evident that the exertions of the husbandman will be steady or fluctuating, vigorous or feeble, in proportion to the steadiness, or fluctuation, adequateness, or inadequateness of the markets on which he must depend, for the vent of the surplus, which may be produced by his labour; and that [such] that surplus in the ordinary course of things, will be greater or less in the same proportion.  
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic market is greatly to be preferred to a foreign one; because it is in the nature of things, far more to be relied upon.  
It is a primary object of the policy of nations, to be able to supply themselves with subsistence from their own soils; and manufacturing nations, as far as circumstances will permit, endeavour to procure, from the same source the raw materials necessary for their own fabrics. This disposition, urged by the spirit of monopoly, is sometimes even carried to an injudicious injurious extreme. It seems not always to be recollected, that nations, who have neither mines nor manufactures, can only obtain the manufactured articles, of which they stand in need, by means of an exchange of the products of their soils; and that, if those who can best furnish them with such articles are unwilling to give a due course to this exchange, they must of necessity make every possible effort to manufacture for themselves; the effect of which is that the manufacturing nations abrige the natural advantages of their situation, through an unwillingness to permit the Agricultural [countries] ones to enjoy the advantages benefits of theirs, and sacrifice the interests of a mutually beneficial beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling every thing and buying nothing.  
But it is also a consequence of the policy, which has been noted, that the foreign demand for the products of agricultural and countries, is, in a great degree, rather casual and occasional, than certain or constant. To what degree extent injurious interruptions of the demand for some of the staple commodities of the United States, may have been experienced, from that cause, must be referred to the judgment of those who are engaged in carrying on the commerce of the country; but it may be safely affirmed, that such interruptions are at times very inconveniently felt, and that cases occur in which markets are frequently either wanting, or so narrowed restricted narrowed, as to be very unequal to the supply are much too few and too circumscribed for the supply, which is to be disposed of cases not   
  
abundant seasons!   Independly likewise  
  
unfrequently occur, in which markets are so confined and restricted, as to render the demand very unequal to the supply.  
Independently likewise of the artificial impediments, which are created by diminution of demand, which result from the policy that has been mentioned in question, there are natural causes tending which serve to render the external demand for the surplus   
the changes on this account very disadvantageous to Agriculture ☞  
of Agricultural countries nations a precarious and flu reliance. The differences of seasons, in the countries, which are the consumers, usually buy, make imense differences in the produce of their own soils, and the degree in different years; and consequently in the degrees of their necessity for ir wants of foreign supply. Plentiful harvests with them, and especially if similar ones occur at the same time they happen in the countries which are the furnishers, neces occasion of course a distressing glut of produce in the markets of the latter.  
Considering how fast the increasing Considering how fast and how much the rapid progress of new settlements of the United States must increase, in the United States must fast increase the surplus produce of the soil, and weighing adverting to the inauspicious symptoms which characterise some late commercial regulations in various attending seriously to the tendency spirit of the system which has hitherto governed the prevails among most of the commercial nations of Europe; whatever dependence may be placed on the force of natural circumstances to counteract the effects of an artificial policy; there appear strong reasons to regard the a foreign demand for that surplus as too uncertain a reliance, and to desire a substitute for it in an extensive domestic market.  
  
To secure such a market there is no other expedient, than to promote manufacturing establishments. Manufacturers, who very constitute the most numerous class, after the cultivators of land, are must for that reason, be the principal consumers of the surplus of their labour.  
This idea of an extensive domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil is of the first consequence. It is of all things, that which best most effectually conduces to a flourishing state of Agriculture. If the effect of manufactories should be to detach a portion of the hands of which would otherwise be engaged in Agriculture Tillage, it might possibly cause a smaller quantity of lands to be under cultivation; culture, but itbut by would also a by their tendency to procure a more certain secure a steady demand for the surplus produce of the soil, they would, at the same time, cause the lands which were in cultivation to be better improvedcultivated &amp; more productive. And in while by their influence, the condition of each individual farmer would be meliorated by this circumstance, the total mass of agricultural production, would be probably be increased: For this must evidently doubtless depend as much, if not moreif not more, upon the degree of improvement, as than upon the quantitynumber of acres under culture.  
It merits particu~ observation, that The multiplication of manufactories not only furnishes a market for those articles which have been accustomed to be produced, in abundance, in a country; but it likewise creates a demand for such as were either unknown before, or produced in inconsiderable inferior quantities. The bowels as well as the surface of the earth are ransacked for articles which were formerly beforebefore neglected. Animals a plants and minerals   
  
earth fossils  
  
acquire ana utility and value which were before unknown.unexplored.  
The foregoing considerations seem alone sufficient to establish, as a general propositions, That it is the interest of nations to diversify the industrious pursuits of the individuals the who compose them—That the establishment of manufactures is calculated not only to increase the general stock of useful and productive labour; but even to improve the state of Agriculture in particular; certainly to advance the interests of those who are engaged in it. There are other views that will be hereafter taken of of the subject, which, it is conceived, will serve to confirm these inferences. Previously to a a furtherprosecution of discussion of the remaining objections to the encouragement of manufactures, which have been stated, previously to entering upon them, it will be of use to see what can be said, in reference to the particular situations of the United States, against the conclusions appearing which appear to result from the considerations which that have been stated; and in the next place what has been already offered.  
It may be observed and the Idea is of with no inconsiderable weight, that however tur true it might may be, that a state, which possessing large tracts of vacant and fertile territory, was at the same time secluded from foreign commerce, would find its interest and the interest of Agriculture, in diverting a part of its population from Tillage to Manufactures; yet it will not follow, that the same is true of a state, which having such vacant and fertile territory, has at the same abundant time ample opportunity of procuring from abroad foreigners, on good terms, all the fabrics of which it may stands in need, for the supply of its inhabitants. The power of doing this at least secures the principal great advantage of a division of labour; leaving the farmer free to pursue exclusively the culture of his land, and enabling him to procure with its products fruits the manufactured supplies requisite either to his wants or to his enjoyments. And though it should be true, that in settled countries, the diversification of Industry is conducive to an increase in the productive power of labour and to an augmentation of revenue and capital, yet it is scarcely conceiveable that there can be any thing of sosuch solid and permanent advantage to an uncultivated and unpeopled country, as to convert its wastes into fruitfulfertile fields and its deserts into cultivated and inhabited inhabited districts. If the Revenue, in the mean time, should be less. the Capital, in the event, must be greater.  
  
To these observations, the following appears to be a satisfactory answer—  
1   If the fu system of perfect liberty to industry and commerce were the prevailing system of nations—if they were every where left to their natural course, the arguments which dissuade a country, in the predicament of the U States, from the zealous pursuit of manufactures would doubtless have great force. It will not be affirmed, that they might not be permitted, with few exceptions, to serve as a rule of national conduct. In such a state of things, each country would have the full benefit of its peculiar advantages to compensate for its deficiencies or disadvantages. If one nation werewas in condition to supply manufactured articles on better terms than another, that other might find an abundant indemnification in a superior capacity to furnish the produce of the soil. And a free exchange, mutually beneficial, of the commodities which each was able to supply, on the best terms, might be carried on between them; supporting in full vigour the industry of each. And though the circumstances which have been mentioned and others which will be unfolded hereafter render it probable, that nations merely Agricultural would not enjoy the same degree of opulence, in proportion to their numbers, as those which united manufactures with agriculture; yet the progressive improvement of the lands of the former might, in the end, atone for an inferior degree of opulence in the mean time: and in a case, in which opposite considerations are pretty equally balanced, the option ought perhaps always to be, in favour of leaving Industry to its own Direction.  
But the system, which has been mentioned, is far from characterising the general policy of Nations. and to judge from some recent symptoms, the contrary spirit would seem rather to gain than to lose ground.  
The consequence of it is, that the U States are to a certain extent in the situation of a country precluded from foreign commerce. They can indeed, without difficulty, obtain from abroad the manufactured supplies, forof which they are in want; but they experience numerous and very injurious impediments to the emission and vent of their own commodities. Nor is this the case in reference to one[any a single] foreign nation only. only. The regulations of several countries, with which we have the most extensive intercourse, throw serious obstructions in the way of the principal staples of the United States.  
In such a position of things, the United States cannot exchange with Europe on equal terms on equal terms; and the want of reciprocity would render them the victim of a system, which should induce them to confine their views to Agriculture and refrain from manufactures. A constant and increasing necessity on their part, for the commodities of Europe, and only a partial and occasional demand for their own, in return, could not but expose them to a state of impoverishment, compared with the opulence to which their political and natural advantages authorise them to aspire.  
Remarks of this kind are not made in the spirit of complaint. ’Tis for the nations, whose regulations are alluded to to judge for themselves, whether by aiming at too much, they do not lose more than they gain. ’Tis for the United States to consider by what means they can render themselves least dependent on the combinations, calculations, right or wrong, of foreign policy.  
It is no small consolation, that already the measures which have embarrassed our trade have accelerated internal improvements, which   
  
[Quere] ☞  
  
upon the whole have bettered our affairs. To diversify and extend these improvements is the surest and safest best method of indemnifying ourselves for any inconveniences which those or similar measures have a tendency to beget, and will at the same time be found the most efficacious retaliation for any unkindness of disposition (if any there has been) which may have dictated them. If Europe will not take from us the products of our soil, upon terms consistent with our interest, tis our duty to ourselves our remedy is the natural remedy is to contract as fast as possible our wants of her.  
2   The conversion of their waste into cultivated lands is certainly a point of great moment in the political calculations of the United States. But the degree in which this may be possibly be retarded by the establishment encouragement of manufactories does not appear to counteract the powerful inducements to affording that encouragement.  
An observation made in another place is of a nature to have great influence upon this question. If it cannot be denied, that the interests even of Agriculture may be advanced more by having such of the lands of a state as are occupied, under good cultivation, than by having a greater quantity occupied, under very defective a much inferior cultivation; and if manufactories, for the reasons assigned, must be admitted to have a tendency to promote a more steady and vigorous cultivation of the lands occupied, than would happen without them, it will follow, that they are capable of indemnifying a country for a diminution of the progress of new settlements; and may serve to increase render both the capital value and the income of its the lands, of a nation, greater even though they should even abrige the number of acres under Tillage.  
But it does, by no means, follow, that the progress of new settlements would be retarded by the extension of manufactures. The desire of being an independent proprietor of land is founded on such strong principles in the human breast, that where the opportunity of becoming so is as great as it is in the United States, the proportion will be small of those, whose situations would otherwise lead to it, wou who would be diverted from it towards manufactures. And it is highly probable, as already intimated, that the accessions of foreigners, who originally drawn over by manufacturing views, would afterwards abandon them for Agricultural, would be more than an equivalent compensate for those of our own citizens, who might happen to be detached from them.  
The remaining objections to a particular encouragement of manufactures in the United States now require to be examined.  
One of these turns on the proposition, that Industry, if left to itself, will naturally find its way to the most useful and profitable employment: hence it may be is inferred that manufactures, without the aid of government, will grow up as soon and as fast as the naturalactual state of things and the increase of the community may require.  
Against the solidity of this hypothesis, man in the full latitude of the terms, very cogent reasons may be offered. These have relation to—the strong influence of habit and the spirit of imitation—the fear of want of success in untried enterprises—The intrinsic difficulties necessarily incident to the first essays towards a competition with those who have previously attained to perfection in the business to be attempted—the bounties premiums and other artificial encouragements with which foreign nations second the exertions of their own citizens in the very branches, in which they are to be rivalled.  
Experience teaches, that men are often so much governed by what they are accustomned to see and practice, that the simplest and most obvious improvements, in the most ordinary occupations, are adopted with hesitation reluctance and by slow gradations. The adopting ofTo substitute adopt new pursuits by a considerable in a community The spontaneous transition to introduction of new pursuits into a community long habituated to different ones may be expected to must be attended with proportionably greater difficulty. When former occupations ceased to yield a profit adequate to the bare subsistence of their followers, and or when there was an absolute deficiency of employment in them, owing to the superabundance of hands, changes would ensue; but these changes would be likely to be more tardy than might consist with the interest either of individuals or of the society. In many cases they would not happen, while a bare livlihoo support could be ensuredsecured by an adherence to ancient courses; though a resort to more profitable employment might be practicable. It may To produce the desireable changes, as early as may be expedient, may therefore require the invitation and incitement and patronage of government.  
The dread apprehension of failing in new attempts is perhaps a more serious impediment. There are dispositions apt to be attracted by the mere novelty of an undertaking—but these are not always those best calculated to give it success. To this, it is of importance, that the confidence of cautious   
[both citizens &amp; foreigners]  
sagacious capitalists both citizens and foreigners should be excited. And to inspire this description of persons with confidence, it is essential that they should be made to see in any project, which is new, and for that reason alone, if, for no other, precarious, the prospect of such a degree of countenance and support from government as may be capable of overcoming the obstacles, inseparable from first experiments.  
The superiority antecedently enjoyed by nations, who have preoccupied and perfected a branch of Industry, constitutes a more formidable obstacle, than either of those, which have been mentioned, to the introduction of the same branch into a country in which it did not before exist. To maintain, between the recent establishments of one country and the long matured establishments of another country, a competition upon equal terms, both as to quality and of price, is in most cases impracticable. The disparity in the one or in the other or in both must necessarily be so considerable as to forbid a successful rivalship, without the extraordinary aid and protection of government.  
But the greatest obstacle of all to the successful prosecution of a new branch of industry in a country, in which it was before unknown, on consists as far as the instances apply, in those the bounties premiums and others aids which are granted, in a variety of casesinstances, by the nations, in which it is previously established the establishments to be imitated are previously introduced. It is well known (and particular examples in the course of this report will be cited) that certain nations grant bounties on the exportation of particular commodities to enable their own workmen to undersell and supplant all competitors in those of the countries to which they those commodities are sent. Hence the undertakers of a new manufacture have to contend not only with the natural disadvantages of a new undertaking, but with the gratuities and remunerations wit which other governments bestow. To be enabled to contend with success, it is evident, that the positive the some interference and aid of their own government are indispensable.  
Combinations by those engaged in gen or parti in a particular branch of business in one country to frustrate the first efforts to introduce it into another, by temporary sacrifices, recompensed perhaps by extraordinary indemnifications of the government of such country, are believed to have existed, and are not to be regarded as destitute of probability. The existence or assurance of aid from the government of the country, in which the new business is to be introduced, may be essential to fortify adventurers against the dread of such combinations—to defeat their effects, if formed, and to prevent their being formed by demonstrating that they must in the end prove fruitless.  
Whatever room ground ground there may might be for an expectation that the Industry of a people, under the direction of private interest, will upon equal terms find out its the most beneficial course upon equal terms employment for itself, there is noneno room for a reliance, that it will struggle against the force of unequal terms, or will of itself surmount all the adventitious and artificial impediments barriers to a successful competition, which may have been erected by an artifice either by the advantages naturally acquired from by practice and   
  
☞  
  
previous possession of the ground, or by by those which may have sprung from positive regulations and an artificial policy.  
This general reflection alone might alone suffice as an answer to the objection, exclus under examination; consideration; exclusively of the weighty considerations which have been particularly urged.  
The remaining objections to the pursuit of manufactures in the United States which next present themselves to discussion, are of a nature more local than and peculiar those which have been hitherto discussed. They represent an impracticability of success, arising from these three causes—scarcity of hands—dearness of labour—want of capital.  
The two first circumstances are to a certain extent real, and, within due limits, ought to be admitted, as obstacles to the success of manufacturing enterprise [factories actually manual] in the United States. But there are various considerations, which greatly lessen their force, and tend seem to afford an assurance, that many they are not sufficient to prevent the advantageous prosecution of many very useful and extensive manufactories.  
With regard to scarcity of hands, the fact itself must be applied with no small qualification to certain parts of the United States. There are large districts, which may be considered, as pretty fully peopled; and in which, notwithstanding a continual drain for distant settlement, numerous are thickly interspersed with flourishing and increasing towns. are to be If these districts have not already reached the point, at which the complaint of scarcity of hands ceases, they are not remote from it, and they are approaching fast towards it: And being being having perhaps fewer advantages attractions to agriculture, than some other parts of the Union, they exhibit a proportionably stronger tendency towards other kinds of industry. In these districts, may be discerned, no inconsiderable maturity for manufacturing establishments.  
But there are circumstances, which have been already noticed with another view, that materially diminish every where the effect of a scarcity of hands. These circumstances are—the great use which can be made of women and children; on which point, a very pregnant and instructive fact has been mentioned—the vast extension which given by late improvements to the employment of machines, which substituting the agency of fire and water, has prodigiously lessened the necessity for manual labour—the employment of persons ordinarily engaged in other occupations, during the seasons, or hours of leisure; which, besides giving occasion to the exertion of a greater quantity of labour by the same number of persons, and thereby increasing the general stock of labour, as has been elsewhere remarked, may also be taken into the calculation, as a resource for obviating the inconvenience deficienc scarcity of hands—lastly the attraction of foreign emigrants. Whoever inspects with a careful eye the composition of our towns will be made sensible to what an extent this resource may be relied upon. This exhibits a large proportion of ingenious mechanics and valuable workmen, in different arts and trades, by who, by expatriating from Europe, have improved their own condition and added to the industry and wealth of the United States. It is a natural inference from the experience we have already had that as soon as if the United States shall present the countenance of a serious prosecution of manufactures—as soon as foreign artists shall be made sensible that the state of things here affords a moral certainty of employment and encouragement—competent numbers of European workmen will transplant themselves, effectually to second and execute secure ensure the success of the design. How indeed can it otherwise happen considering the various and powerful inducements, which the situation of this country pres offers; addressing themselves to so many strong passions and feelings, to so many general and particular interests?  
  
It may be affirmed inferred therefore, in respect to hands for carrying on manufactures, that we shall in a great measure trade upon a foreign stock; reserving our own, for the cultivation of our lands and the manning of our ships; as far as character and circumstances shall may incline. It is not unworthy of remark that the objection to the success of manufactures deduced from the scarcity of hands isseems alike applicable to Trade and navigation; and yet these are perceived to flourish without any sensible impediment from that cause.  
As to the dearness of labour (another of the obstacles alleged) this has relation principally to two circumstances, one that which has been just discussed, or the scanty of hands, the other, the greatness of profits.  
As far as it is a consequence of the scarcity of hands, it is mitigated by all the considerations, which have been adduced as lessening that deficiency.  
It is certain too that the disparity in this respect between some of the most manufacturing certain parts of Europe and certain parts a large proportion of the U States is not nearly so great as is commonly imagined. It is also much less in regard to Artificers and manufactur

, which are paid on their importation—the profits of the importing Merchants.  
As to the first of these items, the cost of materials, the advantage upon the whole, is at present on the side of the United States, and the difference in their favour must increase in proportion as a certain and extensive domestic demand shall induce the proprietors of land to devote more of their attention to the production of those materials. It ought not to escape observation in a comparison on this point, that some of the principal manufacturing countries of Europe are much more dependent obliged on foreign supply for a great part of the materials of most of their principalthan would be manufactures; than would be while the U States, who are capable of supplyingcan easily supply themselves, with

As to the second item, the expence of grounds buildings machinery and tools, an equality at least may be assumed; since advantages on some

particulars will counterballance temporary disadvantages in others.  
As to the third item, the wages of the pers or the article of wages, the comparison certainly turns against the U States; though as before observed, not in so great a degree as is commonly supposed.  
  
It is not unworthy of remarked that the objection to the suce  
  
The fourth item is alike applicable to the foreign and to the domestic manufacture. It is indeed more properly a result, than a particular, to be compared.  
But with regard respect to all the remaining items, they are alone applicable to the foreign manufacture, and in the strictest sense extraordinaries; constituting a sum mass of extra charge on the foreign fabric, which cannot be estimated, at leas less, than  per Cent on the cost of it at the manufactory. This estimate will not appear high when it is considered that  
amount of to not less than from  to  per Cent.  
This sumamount of extra charge may confidently be regarded as more than a counterpoise for the realany real difference which exists in the price of labour; and is a satisfactory proof that domestic manufactures may prosper in defiance of it [in the United States.]. To the general allegation,observation connected with the circumstances of scarcity of hands and dearness of labour, namely that extensive manufactures can only grow out of a redundant or full population, it will be sufficient to answer generally, that the fact has been otherwise. That the situation, alleged to be an essential condition of success, has not beenwas not that of several nations, at a periods, when they had already attained to maturity in a variety ofmade a very considerable progress in manufactures.  
  
  
☞  
  
  
The supposed want of Capital for the prosecution of manufactures in the U States is the most indefinite of the objections which are usually opposed to it.  
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing precise concerning the real extent of the monied capital of the a Country, and still more concerning the the proportion, which it bears to the objects, that invite the employment of Capital. It is not less difficult to pronounce how far the effect of any given quantity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a medium for circulating the industry and property of a nationcountry, may be increased by the very circumstance of the additional motion, which is given to it, by new objects of employment. That effect, like the momentum of descending bodies, may not improperly be represented, as in a compound ratio to mass and velocity. It seems pretty certain that a given sum of money, in a situated situation, in which the quick impulses of commercial activity were little felt, would appear inadequate to the circulation of as great a quantity of industry and property, as in one, in which their full influence was experienced.  
It is not obvious, why the same objection might not as well be made to externalforeign commerce, as to manufactures; since it is manifest that our immense tracts of land occupied cultivated and unoccupied uncultivated are capable of giving employment to more capital than is actually bestowed upon them. It is certain, that the U States offer a vast field for the advantageous employment of Capital; but it does not follow, that there will not be found, in one way or another, a sufficient fund for the successful prosecution of   
[The same remark applies ⟨to⟩ the hands employed in trade ⟨or⟩ navigation]  
any species of industry, which is likely to prove truly beneficial.  
The following considerations are of a nature to remove all inquietude on the score of want of Capital.  
  
The introduction of Banks as has been shewn on another occasion has a powerful tendency to extend the active capital of athe Country. Institutions of this kind is are becoming Experience of the utility of these institutions is multiplying them in the U States. It is probable that they will be established wherever they can exist with advantage; and wherever they can be supported, if administered with prudence, they will add new energies to all pecuniary operations.  
The aid of foreign Capital may safely, and, with considerable latitude, be taken into the calculation. Its instrumentality has been long experienced in our external commerce; and it has begun to be felt in various other modes. Not only our funds, but our agriculture and other internal improvements have been animated by it. It has already in a few instances even extended even to our manufactures. and may be expected to do it hereaf  
It is a well known fact, that there are parts of Europe, which have more capital, than profitable domestic objects of employment. Hence, among other proofs, the large loans continually furnished to foreign states. And it is equally certain that the capital of other parts may find more profitable employment in in the United States than at home. And notwithstandingthough there are weighty inducements to prefer the employment of capital at home, even at less less profit, to an investment of it abroad in foreign countries, though with somewhat greater gain; yet these inducements are overruled either by a deficiency of employment or by a very material difference in profit. Both these causes operate to to produce a transfer of foreign capital to the U States. ’Tis certain that various objects, in this country, hold out advantages which are the temptations of greater with difficulty to be equalled elsewhere; and under the increasingly favourable impressions, which are entertained of our government, the attractions will become more and more strong. These impressions will prove a rich mine of prosperity to the country, if they are confirmed and strengthened by the progress of our affairs. And to secure this advantage, little more is now necessary than to foster industry and cultivate cultivate internal order and tranquillity [and peace at home &amp; abroad] peace at home and abroad. tranquillity.  
There are It is possible [may be] It is not impossible that there may be Whatever may be the objects which persons, [disposed to] who look with a jealous eye on the introduction of foreign capital, as if it were an instrument to deprive our own citizens of the profits of our own industry. But perhaps there never was [could be] a more unreasonable jealousy. Instead of being viewed as a rival, it ought to be considered as a most valuable auxiliary; conducing to put in motion a greater quantity of productive labour and a greater portion of useful enterprise than could exist without it. It is at least evident, that in a country situated like the U States, with an   
☞ unexplained undevelloped  
infinite fund of [dormant]undisplayed resources [yet to be unfolded,] every farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in internal amelioration and in industrious establishments of a permanent nature is a precious acquisition.  
And whatever be the objects which originally attract foreign Capital, when once introduced, it may be directed towards any purpose of beneficial exertion, which is desired. And to detain it among us, there can be no expedient so beneficial effectual as to enlarge the sphere, within which it may can be usefully employed. Though introduced merely with views to speculations in the public funds, it may afterwards be rendered subservient to the interests of Agriculture commerce and Manufactures.  
  
[Facts which in relation to inland navigation &amp; Bridges &amp; manufactures which have already taken place at once suggest &amp; confirm these expectations]  
  
But the [If and] attraction of foreign Capital, wer for the direct purpose of manufactures, ought not to be deemed a chimerical expectation. There are already examples of it, as remarked in another place; and the examples, if the desposition, be cultivated, will can hardly fail to multiply. This expectation will appear the more likely to be fuffilled.  
And There are also examples of instances of another kind, a different which serve to strengthen the same expectation. Enterprises for improving the public communications, by opening new channels of by cutting canals, opening the obstructions in rivers and erecting bridges over them have received very material important aid from the same source.  
When the Manufacturing Capitalists of Europe shall advert to the many important advantages, which have been intimated, in the course of this report, he cannot but perceive very powerful inducements to a transfer of himself and his Capital to the United States. Among the reflections, which a most interesting peculiarity of situation suggests is calculated to suggest, it cannot escape his observation, as a circumstance of very great moment in the calculation, that the progressive population and improvement of the United States ensure a continually increasing domestic demand for the fabrics, which he shall produce—not to be affected by any external casualties or vicissitudes.  
There is  
But while there are circumstances sufficiently strong to authorise a considerable degree of reliance on the aid of foreign Capital, towards the attainment of the object in view, it is satisfactory to have good grounds of assurance that there are domestic resources, of themselves, adequate to it.   
  
Quare  
  
It happens that there is a species of capital actually existing within the United States, which relieves from all inquietude on the score of wanted of Capital. This is the funded debt.  
The effect of a funded debt, as a species of Capital, has been noticed upon a former occasion; but a more particular elucidation of the point seems here to be required by the stress, which is here laid upon it: This shall accordingly be attempted.  
Public funds answer the purpose of Capital, from the estimation in which they are usually held by monied men; and consequently from the ease and dispatch with which they can be turned into money. This capacity of prompt convertibility into money causes a transfer of stock to be in a   
  
[bank note or to]  
  
great number of cases equivalent to  a payment in coin. And where it does not happen to suit the party, who is to [receiving]receive, to accept a transfer of stock, the party who is to pay, is never at a loss to find elsewhere a purchaser of his stock, who will furnish him in lieu of it, of with the coin money, of which he stands in need.  
  
Hence in a sound and settled state of the public funds, a man possessed of a sum in them, can embrace any scheme of business, which offers, with as much confidence, as if he were possessed of an equal sum in coin  
This operation of public funds, as capital, is too obvious to be denied; but it is objected to the idea of their operating as an augmentation of the Capital of the community, that they serve to occasion the destruction of some other capital to an equal amount.  
The capital which alone they can be supposed to destroy must consist of—The annual revenue which is applied to the payment of the debt interest on the debt, and to the gradual redemption of the principal—And the amount of the coin which is employed in circulating the funds, or in in other words, in effecting the different alienations which they undergo.  
But the following appears to be the true and accurate view of this matter—  
1   As to the Point of the Annual Revenue requisite for payment of interest and redemption of principal—  
As a determinate proportion will tend to perspicuity in the reasoning, let it be supposed, that the annual revenue to be applied, corresponding with the modification of the 6 per Cent stock of the U States, is in the ratio of Eight upon the to a hundred, that is in the first instance, six for on account of interest and two on account for the redemption of principal.  
  
  
not obvious  
  
  
Thus far it is evident, that the capital destroyed to that the capital created, would bear no greater proportion than 8 to 100. There would be withdrawn from the total mass of other capitals a sum of Eight dollars to be paid to the public Creditor; whileand he would be put in possession possessed of a sum of 100 dollars ready to be applied to any purpose, to be embarked in any enterprise, which might appear to him eligible. Here then the augmentation of Capital, or the excess of that which is produced beyond to that which is destroyed is as equal to 9296 dollars.  
To this conclusion it may be objected that the sum of Eight dollars is to be withdrawn, annually, until the whole hundred is extinguished; and it may be inferred the from this, that in process of time as great a capital will be destroyed as equal to that which is at first created.  
But the answer to this objection is however true this may be, in an absolute sense—in a relative one the it is equally true, it is nevertheless true that to during the whole of the interval, between the creation of the capital of 100 creation of the capital of 100 Dollars and its reductionuntil it is reduced to a sum not greater than that of the annual revenue, appropriated to its redemption, and its final extinguishment, there will be a greater active capital in existence than if no debt had been contracted. existed. The sum drawn from other capitals on any one year will not exceed eight dollars; but there will be at every instant of time, during the whole period, in question, a sum which will correspondingings with so much of the principal, as remains unredeemed, in the hands of some person, or other, employed, or ready to be employed in some profitable undertaking. There will therefore constantly be more capital, in capacity to be employed, than capital taken from employment.  
The excess for the first year has been stated to be 9296 Dollars; in the second it will diminish yearly, but there always will be an excess anduntil the principal of the debt is brought to a level with the redeeming annuity, that is in the case which has been assumed by way of example to Eight dollars.  
The reality of this excessThe idea intended to be established becomes palpable, if it be supposed, as often in reality happens, that the Citizen of a foreign Country, imports into the U States 100 Dollars for the purchase of an equal sum of public debt. Here is an absolute augmentation of the mass of circulating coin to the extent of 100 Dollars. At the end of a year, the foreigner is to presumed to draw back Eight dollars on account of his principal and interest; but he still leaves 92 of his original deposit in circulation; At the end of another year he draws back another Eight dollars, leaving still 84 dollars of the primitive contribution to animate the industry of the Country as he in like manner leaves does 84 at the end of the second year drawing back then also the annuity of 8 Dollars. And thus the matter proceeds; the capital left in circulation yearly diminishing each year and coming nearer to the level of the annuity drawn back. There are however some differences in the ultimate operation of the part of the debt, which is purchased by foreigners, and that which remains in the hands of citizens. But the general effect in each case, though in different in degrees, is to add to the active capital of the Country.  
Hitherto the reasoning has proceded on a concession of the position principle, that there is a destruction of some other capital, to the extent of the annuity appropriated to the payment of the interest and the gradual redemption of the principal of the debt. But in this too much has been conceded. There is at most a temporary transfer of some other capital, to the amount of the annuity, from those who pay to the Creditor who receives; which he again restores to the circulation to invigorate for resume the offices of a capital. This he does either immediately, by employing the money in some branch of industry, or mediately by lending it to some other person, who does so employ it, or by spending it on his own maintenance. In either supposition, there is no destruction of Capital; there is nothing more than a suspension of its motion it for a time that is, while it is passing from the hands of those who pay into the public coffers, and thence, through the public Creditor into some other channel of circulation. When the payments of interest are quick and periodical and quick, and made by the instrumentality of banks, the division or suspension of Capital is very temporary indeed. may almost be denominated momentary. Hence the deduction on this account is far less than has it at first sight appears to be.  
There is evidently as far as regards the annuity no destruction nor rathereven transfer of any other Capital, than that portion of the income of each individual, which goes to make up the annuity. The land, which furnishes the farmer with his contribution, share contributory the sum which he is to contributes remains the same; and s the like may be observed of other capitals. Indeed as far as the tax, which is the object of occasions the contribution (as doubtless frequently happens, when it does not oppress by its weight) may have been a motive to greater exertion in any occupation, it may even serve to increase the contributory Capital. This idea is not without importance in the general view of the subject.  
It remains to see what further deduction is ought to be made from the increase of Capital which is created by the debt existence of the debt, on account of the coin, which is employed in the its circulation. of the debt. This is susceptible of much less precise calculation, than the article which has been just discussed. It is impossible to say what proportion of coin is carried or necessary to carry on the alienations, which. any species of property usually undergoes. The quantity indeed varies, according to circumstances. But it may always still without hesitation be pronounced, from the quickness of the roat rotation, or rather of the transitions, that the medium of circulation always bears but a small proportion to the amount of the property circulated. And it is thence satisfactorily deducible, that the coin employed in the negotiations of the funds, and which serves to give them activity, as a capital, is incomparably less than the sum of the debt negotiated for the purposes of business.  
It ought not however to be omitted, that the negotiation of the funds becomes itself a distinct business; which employs, and by employing diverts, a portion of the circulating coin from other pursuits. But making due allowance for this circumstance, there is no reason to conclude that the amount effect of the diversion of coin in w the whole operation, is an bears any considerable proportion to the amount of the capital in debt, to which it gives activity. The sum of the debt in circulation is continually at the command of any useful enterprise; the coin itself, which circulates it, is only never more than momentarily from moment to moment suspended from its ordinary functions. It inc experiences an incessant and rapid flux and reflux to and from the channels of industry to those of negotia speculations in the funds.  
  
There are strong circumstances in confirmation of this theory. The force of money moned monied Capital, which has been displayed in Great Britain, and the height, w to which every species of industry has grown up under it, defy a solution, from the quantity of coin, which that kingdom has ever possessed. Accordingly it has been, coeval with itsthe funding system of that Country, the prevailing opinion of her the men of business and of the the generality of theher most sagacious therorists of that Country that the operation of the public funds as Capital has contributed to the effect, in question. Among ourselves appearances experience has thus far favours the same conclusion. Industry in general seems to have been reanimated. There are symptions indicating an extension of our commerce. Our nag navigation has certainly of late had   
Quare this last sentence  
a considerable spring. And There appearsseems to be in many parts of the Union a command of Capital which till lately, since the revolution at least, has been was unknown. But it is at the same time to be acknowleged, that other circumstances have  concurred [(and in a very great degree)] in producing the present state of things, and that the appearances are not yet sufficiently decisive to be intirely relied upon.  
In the question under discussion, it is important to distinguish between an absolute increase of capital, or an accession of real wealth, and an artifical increase of capital, as an Engine of business, or as an instrument of industry and commerce. In the first sense a funded debt has no pretensions to being deemed an increase of Capital; in the last, it has pretensions which are not easy to be controverted. Of a similar nature is bank credit, and in an inferior degree, every species of private credit.  
But though a funded debt is not, in the first instance, an absolute increase of capital, or an augmentation of real wealth; yet by serving as a new power in the operations of industry, it has, within certain bounds, a tendency to increase the real wealth of a community; as more in like manner, as money borrowed by a thrifty farmer, to be laid out in the improvement of his farm, may, in the end, add to his stock add furnish an addition of real riches.  
There are respectable individuals persons who from a just aversion to an accumulation of public debt are unwilling to concede to it any kind of utility; who can discern in it no good to alleviate the ill, with which they suppose it pregnant; who cannot be persuaded, that it ought in any sense to be viewed as an increase of Capital, lest it should be inferred, that the more debt the more capital, the mo greater the burthens the greater the blessings of the community.  
But it interests the public councils to estimate every object as it truly is; to appreciate how far the good in any measure is compensated by the ill or the ill by the good. Either of them is seldom unmixed.  
Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of debt is desireable, because a certain degree of it operates as capital. There may be a plethora in the political as in the natural body. There may be a state of things, in which any such artificial Capital is unnecessary. The debt too may be swelled to such a size, as that the greatest part of it may cease to be useful as a capital, serving only to pamper the dissipation of idle and dissolute individuals; as that the sums required to pay the interest upon it may become oppressive, and beyond the means, which a government can employ, consistently with its tranquillity to raise them; as that the resources of taxation, to face the debt, may have been strained too far to admit of extensions adequate to exigencies, which regard the public safety.  
Where this critical point is cannot be pronounced; but it is impossible to   
Qu: ☞  
believe that there is not such a point. There exists a case, happily not in this Country, in which certain certain violent and almost convulsive expedients, seem to indicate a near approach to it.  
And as the vicissitudes of Nations beget a perpetual tendency to the accumulation of debt, there ought to be, in a every government, a perpetual anxious and unceasing effort to reduce that, which at any time exists, as fast as shall be practicable consistently with integrity and good faith.  
  
Reasonings on a subject, comprehending ideas so abstract and complex, so little reducible to precise calculation, as those which enter into the questionsubject just discussed, are always attended with a danger of running into fallacies. Due allowance ought therefore to be made for this possibility. But as far as the nature of the subject admits of it, there appears to be satisfactory ground to conclude for a belief, that the public funds operate as a resource of Capital to the citizens of the United States; and, if they are a resource at all, it is an extensive one.  
To all the arguments which are brought to evince the impracticalbility of success in manufacturing establishments in the U S it might have been a sufficient answer to have referred to the experience of what has been already done. It is certain that several important branches have grown up and flourished with a rapidity which surprises; affording an encouraging assurance of success in future attempts. Of these, it may not be improper to enumerate the most considerable.

Besides manufactories of these articles, which are carried on, as regular Trades and businesses and may have attained to a considerable degree of maturity, there is a vast scene of hos household manufacturing, which contributes more largely to the supply of the community, than could be have been imagined without making it an [who have not made] without having made it an object of particular inquiry. It is a This observation is the pleasing result of the investigation to which has been occasioned by the subject of this report has led and is applicable as well to some of that as well in the Southern as in to the middle and Northern states. Great quantities of coarse woll cloaths, coatings serges and flannels, linsey woolseys, Hosiery of wool cotton &amp; thread and even ⟨–⟩ silk, coarse fustians and jeans and muslins, cotton checked and stip striped cotton and linnen goods,  
bed ticks coverlets and counterpanes  
Tow linnens, towelings, coarse shirtings, sheetings, toweling, &amp; table linnen bed ticks coverlets counterpanes and some other articles and various mixtures of wool and cotton and of cotton and flax, are made in the household way and in some many instances to an extent not only sufficient for the supply of the families, in which they are made, but for sale, and even in some cases for exportation from one State to another andto foreign countries. It is computed in a number of districts that ⅔ ¾ &amp; even ⅘ of all the cloathing of the inhabitants are made by themselves. The importance of so great a progress as appears to have been made in household family manufactures within a few years, both in a moral and political view, renders the fact highly satisfactory interesting.  
Neither does the above enumeration comprehend all the articles that which are manufactured as regular Trades businesses. Many others occur, which are equally well established but which not being of equal importance have been omitted. And there are many attempts still in their infancy, which though they were attended with very favourable appearances, could not have been properly comprised in an enumeration of manufactories already established. which may are to be considered as having already succeeded.  
Those manufactures also There are other manufactures also of the first importance which have been omitted as not being relative articles also of great importance which though strictly speaking manufactures, are omitted as being immediately connected with husbandry; such are flour Pot &amp; Pearl Ash, Pitch Tar &amp; Turpentine and the like.  
There remains to be noticed an objection to the encouragement of manufactures of a nature different from those which question the probability of success. This is derived from its supposed tendency to give a monopoly of advantages to particular classes at the expence of the rest of the community, who, it is assumed, would be able to procure the requisite supplies of manufactured articles on better terms from foreigners than from our own Citizens, and who, it is alleged, are reduced to a necessity of paying an enhanced price for whatever they want by every measure which obstructs the free competition andof foreign commodities.  
It is not an unreasonable supposition that measures which serve to abrige the free competition of foreign articles have a tendency to occasion an enhancement of prices, and it is not to be denied that such is the effect in a number of cases; but the fact does not uniformly correspond with the theory: A reduction of prices has in several instances immediately succeeded the establishment of a domestic manufacture. Whether it be that foreign manufacturers endeavour to supplant by underselling our own or whatever else be the cause, the effect has been such as is stated, and the reverse of what might have been expected.  
But though it were true that the immediate and certain effect of regulations controuling the competition of foreign with domestic [native or national] fabrics was an increase of price, it is universally true that the contrary is the ultimate effect with every successful manufacture. When a domestic [native] manufacture has attained to perfection and has attained to perfection and has engaged in the prosecution of it a competent number of persons it invariably becomes cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges which attend the importation of foreign commodities, it can be afforded and accordingly seldom or never fails to be sold cheaper in process of time than was the foreign article for which it is a substitute. The internal competition which takes place soon does away any thing like monopoly, and by degrees reduces the price of the article to the minimum of a reasonable profit on the capital employed. This accords with the reason of the thing and with experience.  
Whence it follows that it is the interest of a community with a view to eventual and permanent œconomy to encourage the growth of manufactures. In a national view a temporary enhancement of price must always be well compensated by a permanent the posteriorreduction of it.  
It is a reflection which may with propriety be indulged here; that this eventualmaterial diminution of the prices of manufactured Articles which is the result of domestic internal manufacturing establishments has a direct and very important tendency to benefit agriculture. It enables the farmer to procure with a smaller quantity of his labor the manufactured produce of which he stands in need and consequently increases the value of his income and property.  
The objections, which are commonly made to the expediency of encouraging, and to the probability of succeeding in manufacturing pursuits, in the United States, having now been discussed; the considerations, recommending that species of industry to the patronage of the Government, which have appeared in the course of the discussion recommending that species of industry to the patronage of the Government will be materially strengthened by a few general and some particular topics which

have been naturally reserved for for subsequent Notices. not being connected with the answers that naturally suggested themselves to those objections, beenhave reserved themselves for subsequent Attention.Notice.  
I   There seems to be a moral certainty, that the trade of a country, which is both manufacturing and Agricultural, will be more lucrative and prosperous, than that of a country, which is merely Agricultural. This depends on several circumstances.  
One of these circumstances is, One reason for this is found in That general effort of Nations (which has been mentioned already taken notice of) to procure, from their own soils, the articles of prime necessity requisite to their own consumption and use, and which serves to rendering their demand for a foreign supply of such articleswhence it happens, that a foreignor external demand for articles in in a great degree occasional and precarious only. and contingent. and fluctuating. Hence while the necessities of the mearly Agricultural State for the fabrics a nations exclusively devoted to Agriculture the cultivation of the soil, for the fabrics of the manufacturing states, from which its supplies are constant and regular, the wants, of the latter of which of the latter experienced of for the products of the former are liable to very considerable great fluctuations inequalities and interruptions. The great inequalities, resulting from difference of seasons, have been elsewhere remarked. This uniformity of demand, on one side, and unsteadiness of it, on the other, must necessarily have a tendency to cause the course of general course of the exchange of commodities between the parties to turn to the prove highly disadvantageous to of the merely Agricultural States. Peculiarity of situation, a soil and climate and soil adapted to the production of peculiar commodities may sometimes produce a contrary effect contradict the rule; but there is every reason to believe conclude, that it will be found, in the main, a just one.  
Another of the circumstances alluded to as giving which gives a superiority of commercial advantages to states which that manufacture, as well as cultivate, consists in the more numerous attractions, which a more diversified market offers to foreign customers, and in the greater scope, which it affords to mercantile enterprise. It is a position of indisputable truth in commerce, depending too on very obvious reasons, that the greatest resort will ever be to those marts, where commodities, while equally abundant, are most various. Each difference of kind holds out an additional inducement while a general assortment of ⟨tra⟩de can be the more easily ⟨ex⟩cited: And it is a position not less clear, that the field of enterprise must be enlarged to the Merchants of a Country in proportion to the variety as well as the abundance of domestic commodities which they find at home for exportation to foreign markets.  
A third and perhaps circumstance perhaps not inferior to either of the other two, conferringasserting conferring asserting the superiority which has been stated of either of the other two in question, has relation to the stagnations of pr demand for certain commodities which at some time or other interfere more or less with the sale of all. are from time to time experienced. The Nation which can bring to market but few articles is likely to be more quickly and sensibly affected by such stagnations than one which is always possessed of a great variety of commodities. The former frequently finds too great a proportion of its stock of materials, for sale or exchange, lying on hand—or is obliged to make injurious sacrifices to supply its wants of foreign articles, which are numerous and urgent, in proportion to the smallness of the number of its own. The latter commonly finds itself indemnified, by the high prices of some articles, for the low prices of others; while and the prompt and advantageous sale of some articles enables its merchant the better to wait for a favourable change in respect to those which happen not to be in demand. There is ground to believe that a difference of situation in this particular has immensely different effects upon the wealth and prosperity of Nations.  
  
From these circumstances collectively, two important inferences are to be drawn—Th one that there is always a higher probability of a favourable ballance of Trade, in regard to countries, in which manufactures, founded on the basis of a thriving Agriculture, flourish, than in regard to those, which are confined wholly or almost wholly to Agriculture; and the other, the (which is also a consequence of the first) that countries of the formerfirst description are likely to possess more pecuniary wealth, or money, than those of the latter.  
Facts appear to correspond with this conclusion. Let the The importations of manufactured supplies seem invariably to drain the merely Agricultural people of their wealth. Let the situation of the manufacturing countries of Europe which m be compared in this particular, with the situation of thosethat of countries, which only cultivate, and the disparity will be striking. Other causes, it is true, help to account for this disparity between some of them; and among these causes, the relative state of Agriculture; but between some others of them the most prominent circumstance of dissimilitude were arises from the comparative state of manufactures. In corroboration confirmation of the same idea, it ought not to escape remark, that the West India Islands, the soils of wh

ow compose the United States, appeared to be inadequate to their circulation: and their debt to Great Britain was progressive. Since the Revolution, the States, in which manufactures have most increased, have recovered fastest from the injuries of the late war; and abound most in pecuniary resources.  
It ought to be admitted however, in this as in the preceding case, that causes irrelative to foreign from the state of manufactures account, in a degree, for the phenonema remarked. The continual progress of new settlements has a natural tendency to occasion s an unfavourable ballance of trade; though it indemnifies for the inconvenience, by that increase of the national capital, which flows from the conversion of waste into improved lands: And the different degrees of external commerce, which are carried on by the different states, may make material differences in the comparitive state of their wealth. The first circumstance has reference to the deficiency of Coin and the increase of debt, previous to the revolution; the last to the advantages which the most manufacturing states appears to have enjoyed, over the others, since the termination of the late war.  
But the uniform appearance of an abundance of specie, as the concconomitant of a flourishing state of manufactures, and of the reverse, where they do not prevail, afford a strong presumption of their favourable operation upon the wealth of a Country.  
Not only the wealth; but the independence and security of a country appear to be materially connected with the prosperity of manufactures. Every nation, with a view to those great objects, ought to endeavour to possess within itself all the essentials of national supply. These comprise the means of subsistence habitation cloathing and defence.  
  
See if this is not contradicted where a free Trade is spoke of  
  
The possession of these is necessary to the perfection of the of the body politic; to the safety as well as to the welfare of the society. The want of either is the want of an important organ of political life and motion; and in the various crises which await a state, it must severely feel the effects of any such deficiency. The extreme embarrassments of the United States, during the late war, from an incapacity of supplying themselves are still matter of commonkeen recollection: A future war might be expected could not fail again to exemplify the mischiefs and dangers of a situation, to which that incapacity is still in too gret a degree it is applicable; unless changed by timely and vigourous exertion.  
To work effect this change, as fast as shall be prudent, merits all the attention and all the zeal of our public councils. ’TisIt is the next great work to be accomplished.  
  
  
Quaere?  
  
  
The want of a Navy to protect our external commerce as long as it shall continue must renders it a peculiarly precarious reliance, for the supply of essential articles, and must serve to strengthens prodigiously the arguments in favour of manufactures.  
To these more general considerations are added some of a more particular nature.  
Our distance from Europe, the great fountain of manufactured supply, subjects us, in the existing state of things, to inconvenience and loss, in two ways. The bulkiness of those commodities, which are the chief productions of the soil, necessarily imposes very heavy charges on their transportation to distant markets. These charges, in the cases, in which the nations, to whom our products are sent, maintain, with their own commodities, a competition, with uswith our in the supply of their own markets, principally fall upon us; who furnish them to the extent of their deficiency, and form materially diminish deductions from the primitive value of the articles furnished. The charges on manufactured supplies, brought from Europe, are enhanced greatly enhanced by the same circumstance of distance. particularly as to the coarser and more bulky kinds. These charges again, in the cases, in which our own industry maintains no competition in our own own markets, also principally fall upon us, and are an additional cause of extraordinary deduction from the primitive value of our own products; these being the materials of exchange for the foreign fabrics, which we consume.  
The equality and moderation of individual property, and the growing settlements of new lands districts, occasion in this country an unusual demand for coarse manufactures; the charges of which being greater in proportion to their greater bulk augment the disadvantage, which has been just described.  
As in most countries, domestic supplies occasion maintain a very considerable competition with such foreign productions of the soil as are imported for sale; if the extensive establishment of manufactories in the United States does not create a similar competition in respect to manufactured articles, it appears to be clearly deducible from the considerations which have been mentioned, that they must sustain a double loss, in their exchanges with foreign nations; strongly conducive to an unfavourable ballance of Trade and very prejudicial to their Interests.  
These disadvantages press with, no small weight, on the landed interest of the Country. proprietors of land. In seasons of peace, they cause a serious deduction from the intrinsic value of the products of the soil. In the time of a war, which should either involve ourselves, or another nation, possessing a considerable share of our carrying trade, the charges on the transportation of our commodities, bulky as most of them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous burthen to the farmer; while obliged to depend in so great a degree as he now does, upon foreign markets, for the vent of the surplus of his labour.  
As far as the prosperity of the Fisheries of the United States is impeded by the want of an adequate market, there arises another special reason for desiring the extension of manufactures. Besides the fish which in many places would be likely to make a part of the subsistence of the persons employed; it is known that the oils bones and skins of marine animals is extensively are of   
[The fur—the bone spermaceti Skins] ⎫⎪⎪⎬⎪⎪⎭  
extensive use in various manufactures. Hence the prospect of an additional demand for the produce of the Fisheries.  
One or two more points of view only remains, in which to consider the expediency of the encouragement ofing manufactures, in the United States; previous to a general dis discussion of the means, by which it is to be effected, and to a specification of the objects, to which it would seem most proper to direct it, in the present actual state of the Country, and the particular measures which may be adviseable in respect to each.  
It is not uncommon to meet with an opinion, that though the promoting of manufactures may be the interest of a part of the Union, it is contrary to that of another part. The Northern and Southern Regions are sometimes represented as having hostile opposite adverse interests in this respect. Those are called Manufacturing, these Agricultural states; and a species of opposition is imagined to subsist between the Manufacturing and Agricultural interests.  
This idea of an opposition between those two interests is the common error of the early periods of every country; but experience gradually dissipates it. Indeed they are perceived so often to succour and befriend each other, that they come at length to be considered as one; a supposition which has been frequently abused, and is not universally true. Particular encouragements of particular manufactures may be of a nature to sacrifice the interests of landholders to those of Manufactures.  
But it is nevertheless a maxim, well established by experience and generally acknowleged, where there has been sufficient experience, that the aggregate prosperity of manufactures, and the aggregate prosperity of Agriculture are intimately connected. In the course of the discussion, which has had place, a variey of various weighty considerations have been adduced, which operating in support of that maxim. Perhaps the superior steadiness of the demand of a domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil is alone a convincing argument of its truth.  
  
  
Qr   what other  
  
  
Ideas of a contrarity of interests between the Northern &amp;Northern and Southern regions of the Union ought always to be indulged with great caution. They as often as they occur are in the main as unfounded as they are mischievous. The diversity of circumstances, on which such contrariety is usually predicated, authorises a directly contrary conclusion. Mutual wants constitute one of the strongest links of political connection; and the extent of these bears a natural proportion to the diversity in the mutual means of mutual supply.  
It ought  
Ought it not to be the effort of enlightened patriotism to suppress Suggestions of an opposite tendency complexion founded on the supposition of a different interest between the states are ever [Interest cause] to be deplored; as unfriendly to the steady pursuit of one great common cause,  and to the perfect harmony of all the parts.  
In proportion as the mind is accustommed to trace the intimate connection of interest, which subsists between all the parts of a Society, united under one and the same government—the infinite variety of channels which serve to circulate the prosperity of each to and through the rest in that proportion will it be little apt to be disturbed by the solicitudes   
by the solicitudes arising from local jealousies—spirit of locality—  
and apprehensions which originate in local discriminations. aptdisposed to listen to be influenced by the surmises of a spirit of jealous locality. It is a truth as important, as it is agreeable pleasing encouraging, as profound as it is simple, and one to which it is not easy to imagine an exceptions, that every thing tending to establish substantial and permanent order, in the affairs ofa country, to increase the total mass of industry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to every part of it. On the credit of this great and precious truth, an acquiescence may safely be accorded, from every quarter, to all institutions and arrangements, which promise a confirmation of public order, and an augmentation of National Resource.  
But there are more particular considerations which serve to fortify the idea that the encouragement of manufactures is the interest of all parts of the Union. If the Northern &amp; Middle states should be the principal scenes of such establishments, they would immediately benefit the more Southern by creating a demand for productions; some of which they have in common with other states, and others of which are either peculiar to them, or more abundant, or of better quality than elsewhere. These productions principally are Timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw silk, indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides, skins, and coals. Of these articles, Cotton and   
  
Qr Qr.  
  
Indigo are peculiar to the Southern States; as are hitherto lead and coal. Flax and Hemp are or may be raised in greater abundance there than in the more Northern states. And the wool produced in certain parts of Virginia is said to be of better quality, than that which is raised in of any other state; a circumstance rendered the more probable by the accou reflection that   
  
Examine.  
  
Virginia embraces the same latitudes with the finest wool country of Europe. The extensive cultivation climate of the South is also better adapted to the production culture of silk. The extensive cultivation of cotton can perhaps  
The extensive cultivation of cotton can perhaps hardly be expected, but from the previous establishment of [native] domestic manufactories of the article; and the surest encouragement and vent, for the others would result from similar establishments in respect to them.  
If, then, it satisfactorily appears, that it is the interest of the US, generally, to encourage manufactures; it merits particular attention, that there are circumstances which render the present a critical moment for entering with zeal upon the important business. The effort cannot fail to be materially seconded by a considerable and increasing influx of money in consequence of foreign speculations in the funds—and by the disorders, which exist in different parts of Europe.  
The first circumstance not not only facilitates the execution of manufacturing enterprises; but it indicates them, them as a necessary mean, to turn the thing itself to advantage, and to prevent its being eventually an evil. If useful employment be not found for the money of foreigners brought to the country to be invested in the purposeschases of the public debt, it will quickly be reexported to defray the expence of an extraordinary consumption of foreign luxuries; and distressing drains of our specie may hereafter be experienced to pay the interest and redeem the principal of the purchased debt.  
The useful employment too ought to be must be of a nature to produce solid and permanent domestic improvements. If the money merely serves to give and a temporary spring to foreign commerce; as it cannot procure new and lasting outlets for the products of the country; there will be no real or durable advantage gained. In Agricultural ameliorations As far as it shall find its way, in Agricultural ameliorations, in opening new or improving old canals, and in similar improvements, it will be productive of substantial utility. But there is reason to doubt whether in such channels it is likely to find sufficient employment and still more whether many of those who possess it would be as readily attracted to objects of this nature, as to manufacturing pursuits; which bear greater analogy to those to which they are accustomed, and to the spirit generated by them.  
To open the one field, as well as the other, will at least secure a better prospect of useful employment, for whatever accession of money, there has been or may be.  
There is at the present juncture a certain fermentation of mind, a certain activity of speculation and enterprise, which, if properly directed, may be made subservient to useful purposes; but which, if left intirely to itself, may be attended with pernicious effects.  
The disturbed state of Europe inclining its citizens to emigration, the requisite workmen will be the more easily easily acquired than at another time; and if the effecting of multiplying the objects opportunities m of employment to those who emigrate, may be an should be to increase of the number of emigrants and extent of valuable acquisitions to the population arts and industry of the Country. To take find pleasure in the calamities of other nations would be criminal; but to benefit ourselves, by opening an asylum to those who suffer, in consequence of them, is as justifiable as it is politic.  
A full view having now been taken of the inducements to the promotion and encouragement of manufactures, in the United States, accompanied with an examination of the principal objections, which are commonly urged [in opposition, there] against it—it is proper, in the next place, to consider the means, by which it may be effected, as introductory to a specification of the objects which in the present state of things appear the most fit to be encouraged and of the particular measures which it may be adviseable to adopt in respect to each.  
In order to a better judgment of the means proper to be resorted to by the United States, it will be of use to advert to those, which have been employed with success in other countries. The principal of these are—  
  
  
No II  
  
  
I   Protecting duties—or duties on those foreign articles, which are the rivals ones of the domestic ones, intended to be encouraged.  
Duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the domestic fabrics; since by enhancing the charges on foreign Articles they enable the National manufacturers to undersell their foreign competitors. The propriety of this species of encouragement need not be dwelt upon; as it is not only a clear result from the numerous topics which have been suggested but is sanctioned by the laws of the United States in a variety of instances. It has the additional recommendation of being a resource of Revenue. Indeed all the duties imposed on imported articles, though with an exclusive view to the object of Revenue, have the effect in contemplation, and except where they fall on raw materials wear a beneficent aspect towards the manufactures of the Country.  
  
  
No III  
  
  
II   Prohibitions of Rival rival articles or duties equivalent to prohibitions.  
This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging national manufactures. But in general it is only fit to be employed when a manufacture has made such a progress and is in so many hands as to insure a due competition and an adequate supply on reasonable terms. Of duties equivalent to prohibitions, there are   
malt liquors loaf Sugar Carriages Candles  
examples in the Laws of the United States—such as those on  
and there are other cases to which the principle may be advantageously extended, but they are not numerous.  
Considering a monopoly of the domestic market to its own manufacturers as the reigning policy of manufacturing nations, a similar policy on the part of the United States, in every proper instance, is dictated, it might almost be said, by the principles of distributive justice; certainly by the duty of endeavoring to secure to their own Citizens a reciprocity of advantages.  
  
III   Prohibitions of the exportation of actualcertain staples the materials of domestic manufactures.  
The desire of securing a cheap and plentiful supply for the national workmen, and, where the article is either peculiar to the country, or of peculiar quality therethere, the jealousy of enabling foreign workmen to rival those of the nation, with its own materials, are the leading motives to this species of regulation. It ought not to be affirmed that it is nev in no instance case proper; but it is certainly one which ought to be adopted with great circumspection and only in very plain cases. It is seen at once, that its immediate operation, is, by exclusion at least, is to abrige the demand and keep down the price of the produce of some other branch of industry; generally speaking of Agriculture, to the prejudice of those, who carry it on; and though it is certain that as far as it is if it be really essential to the prosperity of any very important national manufacture, it may happen that those who are injured in the first instance may be eventually indemnified, by the superior steadiness of an extensive domestic market, depending on that prosperity; if the manufacturing yet in a matter, in which there is so much room for nice and difficult combinations, in which such opposite considerations combat each other, prudence seems to dictate, that the expedient in question ought to be indulged adopted with a sparing hand.  
  
[on the manufacture or on the raw material—]  
  
IV   Pecuniary bounties  
This has been found one of the most efficacious means of encouraging manufactures; and it is, in some views, the best—though it has not yet been practiced upon, by the Government of the United States, (unless the allowance on the exportortation of dried and pickled fish and salted meat could be considered as a bounty) and though it is less favoured by public opinion than some other modes. Its advantages are these—  
  
1   It is a species of encouragement more positive and direct than any other, and, for that very reason, has a more immediate tendency to stimulate and uphold new enterprises; increasing the chances of profit, and diminishing the risks of loss, in the first attempts.  
2   It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of price, which is incident to some other modes, or it produces it into a less extentdegree; either by making no addition to the charges on the rival foreign article, as in the case of protecting duties, or by making a smaller addition. The first happens when the fund for the bounty is derived from a different object (which may or may not increase the price of some other article according to the nature of that object), the second when the fund is derived from the same or a similar object of foreign manufacture. One per cent duty on the foreign article, converted into a bounty on the domestic, will have an equal effect with a duty of two per Cent exclusive of such bounty: and the price of the foreign commodity is liable to be raised, in the one case, in the proportion of 1 ⅌ Cent, in the other, in that of two per Cent. Indeed the bounty when drawn from another source is calculated to promote a reduction of price; because without laying any new charge on the foreign article, it serves to introduce a competition with it, and to increase the total quantity of the article in the market.  
3.   Bounties have less tenden not like high protecting duties, at tendency to produce scarcity. An increase of price is not always the immediate, though, where the progress of a domestic [native] manufacture does not counteract a rise, it is commonly the ultimate effect of an additional duty. In such an the interval between the laying of the duty and a proportional increase of price, it may discourage importation, by interfering with the profits to be expected from the sale of the article.  
4   Bounties are sometimes not only the best, but the only proper expedient, for uniting the encouragement of a new object of agriculture, with that of a new object of manufacture. It is the interest of the farmer to have the production of the raw material promoted, by restrainingcounteracting the interference of the foreign material of the same kind. It is the interest of the manufacturer to have the material abundant and cheap. If prior to a the domestic production of the Material, in sufficient quantity, to supply the manufacturer on good terms—a duty be laid upon the importation of it from abroad, with a view to promote the raising of it at home, the interests both of the Farmer and Manufacturer will be disserved. By either destroying the requisite supply, or raising the price of the article beyond what can be afforded to be given for it by the undertaker Conductor of an infant manufacture, it is abandonned or fails; and there being no domestic manufactories to create a demand for the raw material, which is raised by the farmer, it is in vain, that the competition of the like foreign article may have been destroyed. It cannot escape notice, that a duty upon the importation of an article can no otherwise promoteaid the domestic production of it, than by giving the latter greater advantages in the home market. It can have no influence, upon foreign markets the advantageous sale of the article produced, in foreign mater markets; no tendency, therefore, to promote its exportations.  
The true way to conciliate these two interests is to lay a duty on foreign manufactures of the material, the growth of which is desired to be encouraged, and to apply the produce of that duty, by way of bounty, either upon the production of the material itself, or upon its exportation to foreign countries, or upon its manufacture at home, or upon both. any or all of them. In this disposition of the thing, the Manufacturer commences his enterprise, under every advantage which is attainable, he can desire, as to quantity, or price of the raw material: And the farmer, if the bounty be immediately to him, is enabled by it, byto enter into a successful competition with the foreign material; if the bounty it be to the manufacturer on the so much of the domestic materials as he consumes, the operation is nearly the same; he has a motive of interest to prefer the domestic commodity, if of equal quality, even at a higher price than the   
  
☞  
  
foreign, if so long as the difference of price is be any thing short of the bounty, which is allowed him upon the article.  
Except the most simple and ordinary kinds of household manufactures, or those for which there are very commanding local advantages, pecuniary bounties are in most cases indispensable to the introduction of a new branch. A stimulous and a support, not less powerful and direct, is generally speaking essential to the overcoming of the obstacles, in which arise from the competitions of the superior skill and maturity elsewhere. It is Bounties are especially essential in the cases, in whichin regard to articles, those upon which, those foreigners, who have been accustommed to supply a country, are in the practice of allowing granting them the identical species of encouragement.  
The continuance of bounties on manufactures long established must almost always be of questionable policy; but because a presumption would arise in every such case, that there were natural and inherent impediments to success. But in new undertakings, they are as justifiable, as they are oftentimes necessary. And wherever they appear to be really necessary  
There is a degree of prejudice against bounties, from an appearance of giving away the public money, without an immediate consideration, and from a supposition, that they serve to enrich particular classes, at the expence of the community.  
But neither of these sources of dislike will bear a serious examination. There is no purpose, to which public money can be more beneficially applied, than to the acquisition of a new and useful branch of industry; no consideration more valuable, than a permanent addition to the general stock of productive labour.  
As to the second source of objection, it equally lies against other modes of encouragement, which are admitted to be eligible. As often as a duty upon a foreign article makes an addition to its price, it causes an extra expence to the community, for the benefit of the domestic manufactures. A bounty does no more. But it is the interest of the Society, in each case, to submit to a temporary expence; which we is more than compensated, by an increase of its industry and wealth, by an augmentation of its resources and independence; and by the very circumstance of eventual cheapness, which has been noticed in another place.  
  
The species of encouragement, however, may in the United States  
It would deserve attention, however, in the at the employment of this species of encouragement, in the U States, as a reason for moderating the degree of it, in the instances in which it might be deemed eligible, that these great distance of this country from the manufacturing countriesnations of Europe imposes a very heavy expence⟨–⟩ charges on all the foreign fabrics which are brought from thence, amounting from fifteen to   
  
Qr—  
  
25 per Cent on their value, according to their bulk.  
V   Premiums  
A Question has been made concerning the constitutional right of the United Sta Government of the United States to apply this species of encouragement. But there is certainly no good foundation for such a question. The National Legislature has plenary express authority to “To lay and collect taxes duties and imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare” with no other qualifications than that “all duties imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States” that “no capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to numbers ascertained by a census or enumeration taken on the principles prescribed in the Constitution” and that “no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.” These three qualifications excepted, the power to raise money is plenary and indefinite; and the objects to which it may be appropriated are no less comprehensive than the payment of the public debts and the providing for the common defence and “general welfare.” The terms “general welfare” were doubtless intended to signify more than were was expressed or imported in those which preceded; otherwise numerous exigencies incident to the affairs of a nation would have been left without a provision. The phrase is as compreh comprehensive an one, as any that could have been used; because it was not fit, that the constitutional authority of the Union, to appropriate its revenues, should have been restricted within narrower limits, than the “general welfare” and because this necessarily embraces a vast variety of particulars, which are susceptible neither of specification nor of definition.  
  
It is therefore wisely and of necessity left to the discretion of the national Legislature, to pronounce upon the objects, which concern the general welfare, and for which, under that decription, an appropriation of money is requisite and proper. And there seems to be no room for a doubt, that whatever concerns the general interests of learning, of agriculture, of manufactures and of commerce, are within the purviewsphere of the national councils, as far as regards concerns an application of money.  
The only qualification of the generality of the phrase, in question, which seems to be admissible, is this—That the objection to which an appropriation of money is to be made be general and not local; its operation extending, in fact, or by possibility, throughout the Union, and not being confined to a particular spot.  
No objection ought to arise to this construction from a supposition that it would imply a power to do whatever ese should appear to Congress conducive to the general welfare. A power to appropriate money with this latitude (and which is granted too, in express terms) would not carry a power to do any other thing not granted authorised in the constitution either expressly or by fair implication.  
V   Premiums  
  
  
No. IV  
  
  
These are of a nature allied to bounties, though distinguishable from them, in some important features. Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article produced, or manufactured, or exported, and involve a correspondent expence. Premiums serve to reward some particular excellence or superiority, some extraordinary exertion or skill; and are dispensed only in a small number of cases. But their effect is to stimulate general effort. Contrived so as to be both honorary and lucrative, they address themselves to different passions; touching the chords as well of emulation as of Interest. [interest] avarice. They are accordingly a very œconomical mean of exciting the enterprise of a whole community.  
There are various societies in different countries, whose object is the dispensation of premiums for the encouragement of agriculture arts manufactures and commerce; and though they are for the most part, voluntary associations, with comparatively slender funds; their utility has been immense. Much has been done by this mean in great Britain: Scotland in particular owes materially to it a prodigious amelioration of condition. From a similar establishment, in the United states, supplied and supported by the Government of the Union, vast benefits might reasonably be expected. Some further ideas on this head shall accordingly be submitted in the conclusion of this report.  
  
  
&amp; implements  
  
  
VI   The exemption of the Materials of manufactures from duty.  
The policy of such an that exemption, as a general rule, is obvious, particularly in reference to new establishments is obvious. Nothing can be more unwise than to impede a It can hardly ever be adviseable to add the obstructions of fiscal burthens to the difficulties to which naturally embarrass a new manufacture; and where it is matured and in condition to become an object of revenue, it is generally speaking better that the fabric, than the material should be the subject of taxation. Ideas of proportion, between the quantum of the tax and the value of the article can better be more easily adjusted in the former than in the latter case. An argument for exemptions of this kind in the United States, is to be derived from the practice (as far as their necessities have permitted) of those nations, whom we are to meet as competitors in our own and in foreign Markets which is conformable to the principle of such ext exemptions, as far as their necessities have admitted.  
There are however exceptions to the principle of which some examples will be given under the next head.  
The laws of the Union afford instances of the observance of the policy here recommended but it will probably be found adviseable to extend it to some other cases.  
Of a nature, bearing some affinity to the exemptions under consideration is that regulation to that policy, is the regulation th which exempts from duty the tools and implements, as well as the books cloaths and household furniture furnis of foreign artists, to who come to reside in the U States; an advantage already secured to them by the laws of the Union, and which it is it is [is conceived to be,] in every view, proper to continue.  
VII   Drawbacks of the duties, which are imposed on by [on raw] the Materials [on the exportation] of manufactures.  
  
It follows that when, for special reasons, duties are laid on such articles  
  
It has already been observed, as a general rule, that duties on those materials of manufacture, ought, with certain exceptions to be foreborne. Of these exceptions exceptions three cases occur, which will may deserve our the following examples kinds occur by way of serve as examples—one where the material is itself and object of general, and or extensive consumption, and a fit and productive source of revenue—  
VIII   The encouragement of new inventions and discoveries, at home, and of the introduction into the United States, of such as may have been made in other countries; Machinery particularly those, which relate to machinery.  
This is among the most use

provements &amp; secrets of extraordinary value to be able to extend the same benefit to the Introducers, also, as well as the Authors or Inventors, in regard as well as Authors and Inventors; at least to improvements and secrets of extraordinary value; a policy which has been practiced with advantage in some other countries. Here, however, as in some other cases, there is cause to regret, that the competency of the authority of the National Government to the good, which might be done, it at least questionable is not without a question. Many aids might be given to industry; many internal improvements of primary magnitude might be promoted, by an authority operating extending throughout the Union, which cannot be effected, as well, if at all, by an authority confined within the limits of a single state.  
But if the legislature of the Union cannot do all the good, that might be wished, it is at least desireable, that all may be done, which is practicable. Means for promoting the introduction of foreign improvements though less efficaciously than might be done accomplished with more competantadequate authority, will form a part of the plan intended to be submitted in the close of this report.  
It is customary with manufacturing nations to prohibit, under severe penalties, the exportation of implements and machines, which they have either invented or improved. There are already objects for a similar regulation in the United States; and others may be expected to occur from time to time. The adoption of it seems to be dictated by the principle of reciprocity. Greater liberalty, in such respects, might better comport with the general spirit of the Country; but a selfish and exclusive policy in other quarters every where else will not always permit the free indulgence of thata spirit, which would place us upon an unequal footing. As far as such prohibitions tend to prevent foreign competitors from deriving the benefit of the such improvements made at home, they tend to increase the advantages of those by whom they may have been introduced; and so far operate as an encouragement to exertion.  
IX   Judicious regulations for the inspection of manufactured commodities.  
This is not among the least important of the means, by which the prosperity of manufactures may be promoted. It is indeed in somemany cases one of among the most essential. To prevent frauds upon consumers Tending Contributing to prevent frauds upon consumers at home and exporters to foreign countries—to improve the quality and preserve the character of the national manufactures, it cannot fail to aid the rea expeditious and advantageous sale of them, and to serve as a guard against successful competitions from some other quarters. The reputation of the flour

of some ports states and of the Potash inof others has been established by an attention to this point. And the like good name might be procured for those articles wheresoever produced, in all parts of the Union by a judicious and uniform system of Inspection, throughout the ports of the United States. A like system might also be extended with advantage to other commodities.  
As the immediate obj

A general circulation of Bank paper, which is

to be expected from the institution lately established will be a most valuable mean to this end. But much good would also accrue from some additional provisions respecting inland bills of exchange. If those drawn in one state payable in another were made negotiable, every where, and interest and damages allowed in case of protest, it would greatly promote negociations between the citizens of different States, by rendering them more secure; and, with it the convenience and advantage of the merchants and manufacturers of each.  
  
  
No. VI  
  
  
XI   The facilitating of the transportation of commodities—  
Improvements favoring this object intimately concern all the domestic interests of a community; but they may without impropriety be mentioned as having an important relation to manufactures. There is perhaps scarcely any thing which has been better calculated to assist the manufactures of Great Britain than the ameliorations of the public roads of that Kingdom, and the great progress which has been of late made in opening canals. Of the former, the United States stand much in need, and for the latter they present uncommon facilities. The symptoms of attention to the improvement of inland Navigation which have lately appeared in some quarters and especially in the State of Pensylvania, must fill with pleasure every heart warmed with a true Zeal for the prosperity of the country. These examples, it is to be hoped, will stimulate the exertions of the Government and the citizens of every State. There can certainly be no object more worthy of the cares of the local administrations; and it were to be wished, that there was no doubt of the power of the national Government to lend its direct aid, on a comprehensive plan. This is one of those improvements which could be prosecuted with more efficacy by the whole than by any part or parts of the Union. There are cases in which the general interest will be in danger to be sacrificed to the collision of some supposed local interests. Jealousies, in matters of this kind, are as apt to exist, as they are apt to be erroneous.  
The following remarks are sufficiently judicious and pertinent to deserve a literal quotation—“Good roads, canals and navigable rivers, by diminishing the expence of carriage, put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood of the town. They are upon that account the greatest of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the remote, which must always be the most extensive circle of the country. They are advantageous to the Town by breaking down the monopoly of the country in its neighborhood. They are advantageous even to that part of the Country. Though they introduce some rival commodities into the old Market they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly besides is a great enemy to good management, which can never be universally established, but in consequence of that free and universal competition, which forces every body to have recourse to it for the sake of self defence. It is not more than Fifty years ago that some of the Counties in the neighborhood of London petitioned the Parliament, against the extension of the turnpike roads, into the remoter counties. Those remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapness of labor, would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the London Market than themselves, and they would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation. Their rents however have risen and their cultivation has been improved, since that time.”  
Specimens of a spirit, similar to that which governed the counties here spoken of, present themselves too frequently to the eye of an impartial observer, and render it a wish of patriotism, that the body in this Country, in whose councils a local or partial spirit is least likely to predominate were at liberty to pursue &amp; promote the general interest, in those instances in which there might be danger of the interference of such a spirit.  
  
☞  
  
But if there should be a doubt of the power of the Government to embrace the whole subject, there is none of its competency to a provision for the improvement of the Postroads, an object which merits and will doubtless occupy an early attention of the Legislature of the United States.  
The foregoing are the principal of the means, by which manufacturing countries promote the growth of manufactures is ordinarily promoted.. It is, however, not merely only necessary, that the d measures of government, which have a direct view to manufactures, should be calculated to assist and protect them, but that those which relateonly collaterally affect them, in the general course of the administration, should be guarded from any peculiar tendency to injure them.  
There are certain species of taxes, which are apt to be oppressive to different parts of the community and among other ill effects have a very unfriendly aspect towards manufactures. All Poll or Capitation taxes are of this nature. They either proceed, according to a fixed rate which operates unequally, and injuriously to the labouring [industrious] poor; or they vest a discretion, in certain officers, to make estimates and assessments which are necessarily vague conjectural and liable to abuse. They ought therefore to be abstained from in all but cases of distressing emergency.  
All such taxes (including all taxes on occupations) unless regulated in the degree by sal which proceed according the to the amount of capital supposed to be employed in a business, or of profits supposed to be made in it, are unavoidably oppressive and hurtful to industry. It is in vain, that the evil may be endeavoured to be mitigated by leaving it, in the first instance, in the option of the party to be taxed, to declare the amount of his Capital or profits. Men engaged in any trade or business have commonly weighty reasons to avoid from forbear disclosures, which would expose, with any thing like accuracy, the real state of their affairs. They most frequently had rather risk will oftenest find it better to risk oppression, than to avail themselves of so inconvenient a remedy refuge.   
  
[an alternative]  
  
And the consequence is, that they often suffer oppression it. The public Those who  
When the disclosure too, if made, is not definitive, but controulable by the discretion, or in other words, by the passions and prejudices of the publicRevenue officers, it is not only an ineffectual protection, but the possibility of its being so is an additional reason for not resorting to it.  
Allowing to the public officers the most equitable dispositions; yet wherever where they are to exercise a discretion, without certain data, they cannot fail to be often misled by appearances. The quantity of business, which seems to be going on, will be a usual criterion is, in a vast number of cases, a very deceitful criterion of the profits which are made; yet it is perhaps the best they can have, and it is the one, on which they will most naturally rely. A business therefore which may rather requires aid, from the government, than be in a capacity to be contributory to it, may find itself crushed by the mistaken conjectures of the Assessors of taxes.  
Arbitrary taxes, under which confidence denomination are compresed all those, that leave the quantum of the tax to be raised on each person, to the discretion of certain officers, are as contrary to the genius of liberty as to the prece maxims of industry.

A government, which desires to promote manufacturing  
It is certain, at least, that such taxes are particularly inimical to the success of manufacturing industry and ought carefully to be avoided by a government, which desires to promote it.  
The great copiousness of the subject of this report has insensibly led to a more lengthy preliminary discussion than was originally contemplated or intended. It appeared proper to investigate principles, to remove consider objections, and to endeavor to establish the utility of the thing proposed to be encouraged; previous to a specification of the objects which might occur, as meriting or requiring encouragement and of the measures, which might be proper, in respect to each. The first purpose having been fulfilled toit remains to pursue the second.  
In the selection of objects, four five circumstances deserve principal seem intitled to particular attention—the capacity of the Country to furnish the raw material—the greatdegree in which the nature of the manufacture admits of a substitute for manual labour, in machinery—the facility of execution—the extensiveness of the uses, to which the article can be applied—its subserviency to other interests, particularly the great one of national defence. These are however objects There are however objects to which these circumstances are little applicable, which for some special reasons, may have a claim to encouragement.  
A designation of the principal raw material of which each manufacture is composed will serve to introduce the remarks upon it. As, first in the first place—  
Iron.  
The manufactures of this article are entitled to preeminent rank. None are more essential in their kinds nor so extensive in their uses.

Metal itself and of converting it to a greater number of profitable purposes.  
Those manufactures too unite in a greater degree than almost any others the several requisites, which have been mentioned, as proper to be consulted in the selection of objects.  
The only further encouragement of manufactures of this article, beyond what the existing laws the propriety of which may be considered as unquestionable, seems to be an increase of the duties on foreign rival articles commodities.  
Steel is a branch, which has already made a considerable progress, and it is ascertained that some new enterprizes on a more extensive scale have been lately set on foot. The facility of carrying it to an extent, which will supply all internal demands and furnish a considerable surplus for exportation cannot be doubted. The duty upon the importation of this

article, which is at present 75 Cents ⅌ Cwt or about 7½ ⅌ Cent on the value, may it is conceived be safely and advantageously extended to 100 Cents. It is desireable, by decisive arrangements, to second the efforts, which are making in so this very valuable a branch.  
The United States already in a great measure chiefly supply themselves with nails and spikes. They are able, and ought certainly, to do it intirely. The first and most labourous operation, in this manufacture, is performed by water mills and of the persons afterwards employed a great proportion are boys, whose early habits of industry are of importance to the community to the present support of their families and to their own future support comfort. It is not less curious than true that in certain parts of the country the making of Nails is an occasional family manufacture.  
The expediency of an additional duty on these articles is indicated by

A duty of two Cents ⅌ lb would, it is presumeable, speedily put an end to so considerable an importation. And it is in every view proper that an end should be put to it.  
  
  
  
  
  
The manufacture of these articles like that of some others, suffers from the carelessness and dishonesty of a part of those who carry it them on. An   
  
Qr.  
  
inspection in certain cases might tend to correct the evil.  
It will deserve consideration whether a regulation of this sort cannot be applied without inconvenience to the exportation of the articles Nails, either to foreign countries, or from one state to another.  
The implements of husbandry are made in several States in great abundance. In many places it is done by the common blacksmiths. And there is no doubt that an ample supply for the whole country can with great ease be procured among ourselves. Various kinds of edged tools for the use of Mechanics are also made; and there are instances of the

It is however improving, and as there are respectable capitals in good hands, in embarked in the prosecution of those branches of in iron manufactories, which are yet in

their infancy, they may all be contemplated as within the reach of an objects of easy acquisition not difficult objects not difficult to be acquired.  
To ensure the end object it seems equally safe and prudent to extend the duty ad valorem upon all manufactures of Iron or of in which iron is the chief article of chief value to ten per Cent.  
Fire arms and other military weapons may it is conceived without inconvenience  be placed without inconvenience in the same class   
  
15 ⅌ Ct  
  
of articles rated at 15 ⅌ Cent. There are already manufactories of these articles, which only require the stimulous of a certainty of demand to render them adequate to the supply of the United States.  
It would also be a material aid to manufactories of this nature, as well as a mean of public security, if provision should be made for an an annual purchase of the military weapons, of home manufacture, to a certain determinate extent, in order to the formation of Arsenals; and to replace from time to time such as should be withdrawn for use, so as always constantly to have in store the quantity of each kind which should be deemed requisite a competent supply.  
But it may hereafter deserve well merits legislative consideration whether manufactories of all the necessary weapons of war ought not to be established on account of the Government itself. Such establishments are agreeable to the usual   
Government to make annual purchase to form arsenals—  
practice of Nations; and that practice seems founded on sufficient reason. There appears to be an improvidence, in leaving these essential instruments of national defence to the casual speculations of individual adventure industry; a resource which can less be relied upon, in this case, than in most others; the articles in question not being objects of ordinary and indispensable private consumption or use. As a general rule, manufactories under the direction on the immediate account of the Government are to be avoided; but this seems to be one of the few exceptions which to that rule admits, depending on very special reasons.  
All Manufactures of steel, generally or of which steel is the article of chief value, may with advantage be placed in the class of goods rated at 7½ per Cent. As manufactures of this kind have not yet made any very considerable progress, it is a reason for not rating them, as high as those of iron; but as this material is the basis of them and as they may their extension, while it is of great importance, is not likely to be attended with any extraordinary difficulty is not less practicable, than important, it is desireable to promote it by a somewhat higher duty than the present.  
A question arises, how far is might be expedient to permit the importation of iron in pigs and barrs free from duty. It would certainly be favourable to manufactures of the article; but the doubt is whether it might not interfere with its production. The Two circumstances, however, abate if they do not remove apprehension, on this score; one is, the considerable increase of price, which has been already remarked, and which renders it probable that the free admission of foreign iron would not be inconsistent with an adequate profit on the production article to the proprietors of Iron Works; the other is, the augmentation of demand, which would be likely to attend the increase of manufactures of the article it, in consequence of the additional encouragements proposed to be given. But nevertheless caution nevertheless in a matter of this kind will beis most adviseable.   
Quare as to exemption of Coal from duty.  
The measure suggested seems proper is prop ought, perhaps, rather to be contemplated, subject to the lights of some further experience, than immediately acted upon adopted.

It may will well deserve consideration how far it may will may be expedient to stimulate enter attempts to explore and work mines of this very useful metal article article article by premiums of the kind already suggested.  
It well deserves  examination whether The expediency of a bounty on all co this species of coal, of home production and of premiums on the opening of new mines, under certain qualifications, appears to be worthy of particular examination. The great importance of this article object will amply justify a reasonable expence in this way, if it shall appear to be necessary to &amp; shall be deemedthought likely to answer, the end.  
Wood  
Several manufactures of this article flourish in the U States. Ships are no where built in greater perfection, and cabinet wares, generally, are made

little if at all inferior to those of Europe. Their extent is such as to have admitted of considerable exportation.  
An exemption from duty forof the several kinds of wood ordinarily used in those manufactures seems to be all, that is requisite, by way of to their full encouragement. The doing of this will seem to be of manifest expediency. It is recommended by the consideration of a similar policy being pursued in other countries, and by the expediency of giving equal advantages to our own workmen in wood. The abundance of Timber proper for Ship building in the U States does not appear to be any objection to it. The increasing scarcity and the growing importance of that article, in the European Countries, admonish the U States to commence and systematically to pursue measures for the preservation of their Stock. Whatever may promote the regular establishment of Magazines of Ship Timber is in various views desireable.  
Leather Skins  
There are scarcely any manufactories of greater importance, than of this article. Their direct and very happy influence upon Agriculture, by promoting the raising of Cattle of different kinds, is a very material recommendation.  
It is pleasing, too, to observe the extensive progress they have made in their principal branches; which are so far matured as almost to defy foreign competition. Tanneries in particular hav are not only carried on as a regular business in numerous instances and in various parts of the Country; but they constitute in manysome places a valuable item of incidental family manufactures.  
Representations however have been made, tending to recommend two species of encouragements importing the expediency of further encouragement to of the Leather-Branch in two ways—one by increasing the duty on imported the manufactures of it, which are imported—the other by prohibiting the exportation of bark. In support of the latter it is alleged that the price has of bark, chiefly in consequence of large exportations, has risen within a few years from  to

These suggestions are submitted rather as intimations, which merit consideration than as matters, the propriety of which is manifest. It is not clear that an increase of duty is necessary and in regard to the prohibition desired, there is no evidence of any considerable exportation hitherto; and it is most propert probable that whatever increase augmentation of price may have taken place is rather to be attributed to an extension of the home demand from the increase of Tanneries manufactures, and to a decrease of the supply, in consequence of from the progress of settlement; rather than to the quantities which

There may is also be this argument in favour of an increase of duty. The object is of importance enough to claim decisive encouragement and the

progress which has been made leaves no room to apprehend any inconvenience on the score of supply from such an increase an augmentation of duty.  
Leather  
It would be of some benefit to this branch, if glue which is now rated at 5 per Cent were made the object of an excluding duty. It is already now made in large considerable quantities at various tanneries, and like paper, is an entire œconomy of materials, which would otherwise be lost, if not manufactured would be left to perish. It may be placed with advantage in the class of articles paying 12½15 per Cent.  
Fish  
Grain  
Manufactures of the several species of this article have a title to peculiar favour; not only because they are most of them immediately connected with the subsistence of the citizens; but because they enlarge the demand for the most precious products of the soil.  
Though flour may with propriety be noticed as a manufacture of Grain, it were useless to do it, but for the subsist purpose of submitting to consideration the expediency of a general system of inspection, throughout the ports of the U States; which, it is presumed if established upon proper principles, would li be likely to improve the quality of our flour every where, and to raise its reputation in foreign markets. Ter These There are however considerations which stand in the way of such an arrangement.  
Ardent spirits and malt liquors are next to flour the two principal manufactures of Grain. The first has made a very extensive, and the last a considerable progress in the U States. In respect to both, an exclusive possession of the home market of the United States ought to be secured to the domestic manufacturers; as fast as circumstances will admit. of it. Nothing is more practicable and nothing more desireable  
The existing laws of the U States have done much towards attaining this valuable object; but some additions to the present duties on foreign distilled spirits and foreign malt liquors and perhaps an abatement of those on home made spirits would more effecttually secure it; and there does not occur any very weighty objection to some further increase of them either.  
An augmentation of the duties on imported spirits would not favour as well the distillation of spirits from molasses as that from Grain. And to secure to the nation the benefit of the manufacture, even of foreign materials, is always of great, though perhaps of secondary importance.  
A strong impression prevails in the minds of those concerned in distilleries (including too, the most candid and enlightened) of them that greater differences in the rates of duty on foreign and domestic spirits are necessary, completely to secure the successful manufacture of the latter and there are facts which intitle this impression to attention.  
It is known agreed, that the price of molasses, for some years past, has been successively rising in the West India Markets owing partly to a competition which did not formerly exist and partly to an extension of demand in this Country; and it is evident that the late disturbances in those Islands, especially the insurrection of the blacks in Hispaniola, from which we draw our principle supply of the article must so far interfere with the production of the article it as to occasion a material enhancement of the price. And The destruction and   
  
Competitors  
  
devastation which are said to have been made in Hispaniola attendant on the insurrection in Hispaniola, in particular, must not only contribute very much to that effect but may be expected to give it some duration. These circumstances, and the duty of three cents per Gallon on molasses, may render it difficult for the distillers of that Material to maintain with adequate profit a competition with the rum brought from the West Indies, the quality of which is so considerably superior.  
The consumption of Gin Geneva or Gin in this country is very extensive. It is not long since distilleries of it have grown among us to any importance. They are now becoming of consequence, but being still in their infancy they require require protection. and aid  
It is represented that the price of of some of the materials is greater here than in Holland, from which place large quantities are brought, the price of labour considerably greater, the capital engaged in the business there much larger, than those which are employed here, the rate of profits, at which the Undertaker cannot afford to carry it on, much less—and the prejudices in favour of imported Gin strong. These circumstances are alleged to outweigh the expen charges of which attend the bringing of the Article from Europe to the U States and und the present difference of duty—so as to obstruct the prosecution of the manufacture with due advantage.  
Experiment could perhaps alone decide with certainty the justness of the suggestions which are made; but in relation to such important branches of manufacture so important it would seem be inexpedient to hazard an unfavourable issue, and better to err on the side of too great than of too small a difference in the particular in question.  
  
  
Quare rate  
  
  
It is therefore submitted that an addition of two cents per Gallon be made to the duty on imported spirits, of the first class of proof, with a proportionable increase on those of higher proof, and that an abatementa deduction of one Cent per Gallons be made from the duty on the spirits distilled within the U States, beginning with the first class of proof and making a proportionable abatement of the duty on the higher classes a proportionable deduction from the duty on those of higher proof. It is conceived, that this would be likely to answer the end in view, and would not be attended with inconveniences, otherwise.  
  
decrease 1 Cent on domestic spirits ☞ ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩  
  
There are materials for a tolerable conjecture (though not for exact computation) that about two thirds of It is ascertained that by far the greatest part of the malt liquors consumed in the U States are the produce of domestic breweries. This conjecture has reference to the importation of a year ending the 30th of September 1790. It is desirable, and, in all likelihood, attainable, that the whole consumption should be supplied by ourselves.  
The malt liquors, made at home, though inferior to the best, are equal to a great part of of those which are have been usually imported. The progress already made is an earnest of what may be accomplished. The growing competition is an assurance of improvement. This will be accelerated by measures tending to invite a greater capital into this channel of employment.  
To render the encouragement to domestic breweries decisive, it may be adviseable to substitute to the present rates of duty 8 Cents per Gallon generally and it will deserve to be considered as a guard against evasions, whether there ought not be be a prohibition of their importation except in casks of a defin considerable capacity. It is to be hoped that such a duty would banish from the market foreign malt liquors of inferior quality; and that the best kind only would continue to be imported till it should be supplanted by the efforts of equal skill or care at home. ’Till that period, the importation so qualified, would be an useful stimulous to improvement. And in the mean time, the payment of the increased price, for the enjoyment of a luxury, in order to the encouragement of a most useful branch of domestic industry could cannot reasonably be deemed a hardship.  
As a further aid to manufactures of Grain, though upon a smaller scale, the dutiesarticles of starch, hair powder and wafers may with great propriety be

Salem  
  
manufactory is established at Boston and very promising ones at some several other places.  
It is presumed to be both safe and expedient adviseable to place this in the class of articles which are rated at 10 per Cent ad valorum. A strong reason for it results from the consideration that a bounty of 2d. Sterling per ell is allowed in Great Britain upon the exportation of the Sail Cloth which is   
Qr. [from 15 to 20] [10 ⅌. Ct]  
manufactured in that kingdom: which is equal to  per Cent on the value [of the several Qualities]. And a still greater bounty is allowed in Ireland.  
It would likewise appear to be good policy to raise the duty to 7½ per Cent on the following articlesarticles namely coarse linnens—Drilling Oznaburghs,   
Dowlass Canvass Drilling Oil Cloth Sheetings  
Ticklenburghs, Dowlas Canvass Brown Rolls bagging Drilling Oil Cloth and uponall other linnens, which the price value full cost of which, at the place of exportation, does not exceed 35 Cents per yard. A bounty of 12½ ⅌ Cent, upon an average, on the exportation of such or similar linnens from Great Britain encourages the manufacture of them in that country and increases the obstacles to a successful competition in the countries to which they are sent.  
The quantities of tow and other household linnens manufactured in different parts of the U States, and the expectations, which are derived from some late experiments of being able to apply extend the use of labor saving machines, in the coarser fabrics of linnen obviate are induceme lessen the danger of inconvenience from an increase of the duty upon them such articles, and encourageauthorise a hope of speedy and complete success to the endeavours which may be used made for supplying ourselves with them procuring an internal supply.

But To give still afford more effectual encouragement to the manufacture, and, at the same time, to counteract any detriment to Ship building navigation from a rise promote the cheapness of the article, for the benefit

An encouragement of this kind nature ought if adopted ought to be established for a moderate term of years, to invite to new undertakings and to an extension of the old. This is an article of so importance enough to warrant the employment of extraordinary means in its favour.  
A bounty too likewise of 5 per Cent on the exportation of all other linnens, of the manufacture of the United States, from domestic materials, the value of which does not exceed 40 Cents per yard, would have a beneficial influence in respect to them. This standard value, in the U Statesof value in our markets, is is adopted as corresponding with that 35 Cents in the Markets of Europe, wh in reference to articles of a similar kind.  
Cotton  
There is something, in the texture of this material, which adapts it in a particular peculiar manner peculiar manner degree to the application of Machines. The signal utility of the Mill for spinning of Cotton not long since invented in England has been noticed in another place; but there are various other machines scarcely inferior in utility, which, in the different manufactories of this article serve as a substitute for manuf manual labour are employed either exclusively, or with more than ordinary effect. This very important circumstance recommends the fabrics of Cotton in a more particular meth manner to a country in which a defect of hands constitutes the greatest obstacle to success.  
The great variety and extent of the of uses to which the manufactures of this article are applicable is another powerful argument in their favour.  
And the faculty of the United States to produce the raw material in abundance, and of a quality which though perhapshitherto alleged to be inferior to some that is produced in other quarters, is never nevertheless capable of being used with advantage in many fabrics, and is probably susceptible, especially in the two states farthest South of being carried, by a more experienced culture, to much greater perfection—suggests an additional, and a very cogent inducement to the vigorous pursuit of the Cotton branch in its several subdivisions.  
How much has been already done has been stated, in a preceding part of this report.  
In addition to this it may be announced, that a Society is forming with a capital which will probably not fall short, is expected to be extended to at least half a milion of Dollars; on behalf of which measures are already in train for prosecuting, on a large scale, the making and printing of Cotton Goods.  
These circumstances conspire to indicate the expediency of removing any obstructions, which may happen to exist, to the advantageous prosecution of the manufactories in question, and of adding such encouragements, as may appear necessary and proper.  
The present duty of 3 Cents ⅌ lb on the foreign raw material, is undoubtedly a very serious d impediment to the progress of those manufactories.  
ItsThe injurious tendency of similar duties either prior to the establishment, or in the infancy, prior to the complete establishment of the domestic manufacture of the article, as it regards the manufacture, and their worse than inutility, in reference relation to the home production of it the material itself have been ancipated; particularly in discussing the subject of pecuniary bounties.  
  
Cotton has th not the same pretensions, with Hemp, to form an exception to the general rule.  
Not being, like It is not that Hemp only, not an universal production of the Country and consequently affords less assurance it affords less assurance of an adequate internal supply; but the chief objection arises from the doubts which are entertained concerning the quality of the nation[ve]al Cotton. It is alleged observed that the fibre of it is considerably shorter and weaker than that of some other places; particularly those nearest the Equator and it has been observed as a general rule, that the nearer the place of growth to the Equator, the better the quality of the

Cotton. That which comes from Cayenne Surrinam and Demarara is said   
  
Geo~  
  
to be preferable, even at a material difference of price, to the Cotton of the Islands.  
While it ought not to be a hope may reasonably be indulged, that with due care and attention the nation[ve]al cotton may be made to approach nearer than it now does to that of regions somewhat more favoured by climate; and while facts authorise an opinion demonstrate that very great use may be made of it, and that it is a resource which gives greater security to the Cotton fabrics of this land Country, than can be enjoyed by any which that depends wholly on an external supply—it iswill certainly be wise in every view to let our infant manufactures have the full benefit of the best materials on the cheapest terms.  
It is obvious that the necessity of having the bestsuch materials is proportioned to the unskillfulness and inexperience of the workmen employed, who will if inexpert will not fail to commit great waste where they the materials they are to work with, are of an indifferent kind. In order And to them To secure to the National Manufactures so essential an advantage, a repeal of the present duty on foreign c imported Cotton appears is indispensable.  
A substitute for this, far more encouraging to domestic production, will be to grant a bounty on all cotton goods manufactured from the native materials of the Country. Two Cents per Yard. defining the  width, would be a strong motive of preference to the national Cotton on the nation[ve]al Cotton when which is consumed wrought at any a home national manufactory; and to thiswhich, a bounty on the exportation of it if deemed may   
  
☞  
  
be added. Either or both would do much more towards promoting the growth of the article than the ex merely nominal encouragement, which it is proposed to abolish. The first would also have a direct influence in encouraging the manufacture.  
The bounty which has been mentioned, as existing in G Britain, upon the exportation of coarse linnens, not exceeding a certain value, applies also to certain descriptions of Cotton goods of similar value.  
This furnishes an additional argument for allowing to the national manufacturers the species of encouragement just suggested, and indeed for extending adding some other aid. and  
One cent per yard, not less than of a given width, on all cotton goods of Cotton or of Cotton and linnen mixed not exceeding in value 40 cents per yard, which are manufactured in the U States; with the addition of one Cent ⅌ lb weight of the Material, if made of nation[ve]al Cotton; would amount to an aid of considerable very great importance, both to the production and to the   
  
Computation  
  
manufacture of that valuable material article. And it is conceived that the expence would be well justified by the magnitude of the object. The limitation in point of respect to the value of the goods ought not to apply to the bounty on the material.  
The Printing and Staining of Cotton goods is known to be a distinct business from the fabrication of them. It is one material easily accomplished, and which, by addingas it adds materially to the value of the article, in its white state and prepares it for a variety of new uses is of importance to be promoted.  
As imported Cottons, equally with those which are made at home, may be the objects of this manufacture, it will merit consideration whether the whole or a part of the duty, on the white goods, ought not to be allowed to be drawn back in favour of those, who print or stain them. This measure would certainly operate as a powerful encouragement to the business; and though it may in a slight degree contrac counteract the original fabrication of the articles articles, it would probably more than compensate for this disadvantage, in the rapid growth of a collateral branch, which is of a nature sooner to attain to maturity. When a sufficient progress shall have   
Oil of Vitriol aqua fortis Madder  
been made, the drawback may be abrogated; and by that time the domestic supply of the articles to be printed or stained will have been extended.  
If the duty of 7½ ⅌ Cent on certain kinds of Cotton goods were extended to all goods of Cotton, or of which it is the principal material, it would probably more than counterballance the effect of the drawback proposed, in relation to the fabrication the fabrication of the article. And no material objection occurs to such an extension. The duty, then, considering all the circumstances which attend goods of this description, could not be deemed inconveniently high &amp; Itit may be inferred from various causes that the prices of them would still continue moderate.

the U States, the woollen branch cannot be regarded as inferior to any, thatwhich relates to the cloathing of the inhabitants.  
Household manufactures of various articles this material are carried on, in different parts of the United States, to a very interesting extent; but five branches there is only one branch, which as a regular business, can be said to have acquired maturity. This is the making of Hats.  
Hats intirely of wool and of wool mixed with furr are made in large great   
[in a great Number of Shops]  
quantities, at a number of places[in various parts of], in different states; and nothing seems is wanting but an adequate supply of the materials to render the manufacture supply commensurate with the demand.

[compared the prices]  
and conspires with the scantiness of the means, which have been at the command of the Directors, to form the eulogium of theirthat public spirit perseverance and judgment which have been able to accomplish so much.  
To cherish and bring to maturity this precious embryo engages must engage the most ardent wishes—and proportionable regret, as far as the means of doing aiding it may appear difficult or uncertain.  
Measures, which should tend to promote an abundant supply of wool, of good quality, would probably afford the most effectual efficacious aid, that present circumstances permit.  
To encourage the raising and improving the breed of sheep at home would certainly be the most desireable expedient for that purpose; but it may not be alone sufficient, especially as it is yet a problem, wether whether our wool isbe capable of such a degree of improvement, as to render it fit for the finer fabrics.  
Premiums would probably be found the best means of promoting both the domestic and bounties the foreign supply. The first may be within the compass of the institution hereafter to be submitted—the last would may require a

e ribbands and buttons are made; though as yet in but small quantities. A manufactory of lace upon a scale not very extensive has been long memorable at Ipswich in the state of Massachusettes.  
An exemption of the dutymaterial from the duty, which it now pays on importation, and premiums upon the production, to be dispensed under the direction of the Institution before alluded to, seem to be the only species of encouragement adviseable at so early a stage of the thing.  
Glass  
The materials for making Glass are found every where. In the United States, there is no deficiency of them. The sands and stones called Tarso, which include all flinty and chrystalline substances generally, and the salts of various plants weeds, particularly of the sea weed kali or kelp constitute the essential ingredients. The An extraordinary abundance of fuel is a particular advantage enjoyed by this U Statescountry for such manufactures. They, however, require large Capitals and involve much manual labour.  
  
[and a third in New Jersey] [Quare Albany]  
  
Two if not or more Different manufactories of Glass are now on foot in the U States, one in Maryland, another in Massachusettes. The present duty of 12½ per Cent on all imported articles of glass amount to a considerable encouragement to domestic fabrication those manufactories. If any thing in addition is is judged eligible, the most proper would appear to be a direct bounty on window glass and black bottles. The first recommends itself as an object of general convenience; the last adds to that character, the circumstance of being an important item in distilleries and breweries.

e a favourable tendency.  
Paper  
Manufactories of paper are among those which are arrived at the greatest maturity in the United States and are most adequate to the requisite national supply. That of Paper Hangings is a branch in which a respectable progress has been made.  
Nothing material seems wanting to the further success of this valuable branch; what is already proper protected by a competent duty on similar imported articles.  
  
[Qu: what would be the effect of a premium on the Collection of Rags in spreading the habit of doing it—]  
  
In the enumeration of the several kinds, which are made subject to that duty, sheathing and cartrige paper have been omitted. These, being the most simple manufactures of the kind sort and necessary to military supply as well as shipbuilding, recommend themselves equally with those of other descriptions, to encouragement, and appear to be as fully within the compass of domestic exertions.  
Printed books  
  
[Qu: is there yet sufficient demand?]  
  
The great number of presses, desseminated throughout the Union, seem to afford an assurance, that there is no need of being indebted to foreign countries for the printing of the books which are used in the U States. A duty of ten per Cent instead of five, which is now charged upon the article, would have a tendency to aid the in business internally.  
  
Quaere?  
  
It occurs, as an objection to this, that it may have an unfavourable aspect towards Literature, by raising the prices of books in universal use in private families and Schools and other seminaries of learning. TheBut the difference it is conceived would be without effect. but the objection, as far as it may be one, is capable of being obviated by a small bounty on all such books printed at home according to some specific enumeration.  
As to books, which usually fill the libraries of the wealthier classes and of professional men, such an augmentation of prices as might be occasioned by an additional duty of 5 ⅌ Cent would be too little felt to be an impediment to the acquisition. and in this, as in other cases, the extension of the domestic manufacture would finally conduce to a greater cheapness of the article.  
  
exemption of books imported for seminaries of learning &amp; public libraries  
  
And With regard to books which may be specially imported for the use of particular Seminaries of Learning and of Public libraries, a total exemption from duty would be adviseable, which would alsogo far towards obviating the objection just mentioned. They are now subject to a duty of 5 ⅌ Cent.  
As to the more ordinary kinds of books in most general universal family use the constancy &amp; universality of the demand would ensure exertions to furnish them at home and the means are completely adequate. It may also be expected ultimately in this as in other cases that the extension of the domestic manufacture willwould conduce to the cheapness of the article.  
It ought not to pass unremarked that to encouragement to the printing of books is to encourage must likewise favour the manufacture of paper.  
Oils  
  
[Qu: do these three want the aid]  
  
These generally are now subject to a duty of 10 ⅌ Cent. Those of sea and land animals and of flax seed are among the most plentiful objects of internal supply. It is not perceived that any inconvenience could arise from such an increase of the duty upon them as would have a prohibitory operation: and it would have the advantage of promoting some valuable branches objects branches of national industry.  
Spirits of Turpentine may with propriety by placed under a similar RegimeRegulation.  
Refined Sugars and Chocolate  
Are among the objectsnumber of extensive and prosperous domestic manufactories.  
  
  
Chocolate  2 Cents ⅌ lb  
  
Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, of which they are respectively made in cases of exportation, would have a beneficial influence upon the manufacture, and would conform to a precedent, which has been already furnished, in the instance of molasses, on the exportation of distilled spirits.  
Cocoa the raw material now pays a duty of one Cent ⅌ lb, while Chocolate, which is a prevailing and very simple manufacture is comprised in the mass of articles rated at 5 ⅌ no more than five ⅌ Cent.  
There would appear to be a propriety in placing encouraging the manufacture, by a somewhat higher duty, on its foreign rival, than is paid on the raw material. Two Cents ⅌ lb on C imported Chocolate would it is presumed be without inconvenience.  
The foregoing heads comprise the most important of the several kinds of manufactures, which have occured as requiring, and, at the same time, as most proper for public encouragement: and such measures for affording it, as have appeared best calculated to answer the end, have been suggested.  
The observations, which have accompanied this delineation of objects, supercede the necessity of many suppementary remarks. One or two however may not be altogether superfluous.  
Bounties are in various instances proposed as one species of encouragement.  
It is a familiar objection to them, that they are difficult to be managed and liable to frauds. But neither that difficulty nor this danger seems sufficiently great to countervail the advantages of which they are productive, when rightly applied. And it is presumed to have been shewn that they are in some cases, particularly in the infancy of new enterprises indispensable inadmissible.  
It will however be necessary to guard with extraordinary circumspection the manner of dispensing them. The requisite precautions have been thought of, but to enter into the detail would swell

The Possibility of a diminution of the revenue may also present itself as an objection to the arrangements which have been submitted.  
But there is no truth which may be more firmly relied upon than that the interests of the Revenue are promoted by whatever promotes an increase of National Industry and Wealth.  
In proportion to the degree of these, is the capacity of every county to contribute to the Public Treasury; and where the capacity to pay is encreased, or even rather is not decreased, the only consequence of measures, which diminish any particular resource is a change of the object. If by encouraging the Manufacture of an article at home, the revenue which has been wont to accrue from its importation should be lessened, an indemnification can easily be found either out of the manufacture itself, or from some other object which may be deemed more conven

pretty generally admitted. Thee&quot; bar

in its further extcnflOD, a full inaemni

population, strength and real riches o

&quot; To endeavor, by tne extraordinary  
patronage of government, to accelerate  
the growth of manufactures, is, in fatt  
to endeavor, by force and art, to tran  
fer the natural current of industry, fron  
a more to a less beneficial channel  
Whatever has such a tendency must ne  
ceffarily be unwise: Indeed it can hard

tempt to give a direction to the mdui  
try of its citizens. Ihis, under the

which appear to recommendt&#x27;ne tpecial

ccrtain cases, and under certain reafcn­

annual produce of its land and lab*6i.  
If the consumption for any given period  
amounted to a given _/&lt;&#x27; m; and the encreaf­  
c.i value of the produce manufactured,  
in the /jme period, to a like fum&gt; the total  
amount of the consumption and produc­  
tion during that period, would be equal  
to-t.he iiwof-trn*, and ponfcquently double  
the value of the agricultural produce  
on fumed . And though the increment  
if value produced by the clafles of ar­  
tificers should at nb time exceed the  
value of the produce of the land consu­  
med by them, yet there would be at e­  
very moment, in consequence of their  
labor, a greater value of goods in the  
market than would exi/l independent  
of iti&quot;  
2. &quot; That the position, that artificers  
can augment the revenue of a society,  
only by parsimony, is true in no othei  
sense, than in one which is equally ap­  
plicable to husbandmen or cultivators.  
It may be alike affirmed of all these  
classes, that the fund acquired by their  
labor anddeftined for their support, is  
not, in an ordinary way, more ihan e­  
qual to it. And hence it will follow,  
that augmentations of the wealth 01  
capital of the community (except in the  
instances of some extraordinary dexten­  
ty or fhill) can only proceed, with re­  
ined to any of them, from, the savings  
of the more thrifty and parsimonious.&quot;  
3. &quot; That the annual produce of the  
land and labor of a country can only be  
ertcreafed, in two ways—by some im­  
provement in the productive powers of  
the uleful labor, which actually  
within it, or by some encreafe in the  
quantity of such labor : That with re­  
gard to&#x27; the fir ft, the labor of artificer?  
being capable of greater subdivision  
and hmplicity of operation, than that oi  
cultivators, it is fufeeptible, in a propor­  
tionably greater degree, of improvemen!  
  
Numb. 17.  
  
&#x27;in its productive powers, whether to be&#x27;  
derived from an accession of skill, of  
from the application of ingenious ma-,  
chiiiery : in which particular, therefore  
the jabor employed ia the culture of  
land can pretend to no advantage over  
that engaged in manufactures r That  
with regard&#x27;td att-augmerrtation of the  
quantity of- ufeful labor this, excluding  
adventitious eifcumftarices, mufl de­  
pend eflfentiaHy upon an exicfeaie of ca­  
pital, which&#x27; again mutt depend upon  
the savingS made out of the revenues of  
those, who furnifh or manage that,  
which is at any time employed, whether  
in agriculture, or iti fnanufaffcureS&quot;., Or iti  
any other way.&quot;  
But while tlie (tela five prodaftivc/iefs  
of agricultural labor has beefr thus deni­  
ed and refuted, the fuperitfrit&#x27;i- of its  
produftivenefs has been conceded with­  
out helitatiori. As this concefliop.  
involtes a pflint 6f considerable magni­  
tude, in relation to maxims of public  
I adminirtration, ?he grounds on which it  
| lefts ate worthy of a diftin£fc and partic­  
llar examination.  
One of the arguments made use of, in  
&quot;upport of the idea maybe pronounced  
Krtb quaint and fuperficial : It amounts  
o this That irt the productions of the  
oil, nature co-operates with man i and  
hat the efieftoftheir joint labormuftbe  
-reater than thatof the labor o mart altfne.  
Tliis, however, isfaif from being a ne­  
;effary inference. It is very co.ncciv.a­  
-&gt;le, that the labor of man alone laid out  
lpon a work, feqairing great (kill and  
trt to bring it to perfection, may be more  
productive, in value, than the labor of  
lature and man Combined-, when direc­  
cd towards more simple operations and  
jbjerts : And when it is recollected to  
what an extent the agency of nature, in  
be application-os the mechanical pow­  
■rs, is made auxiliarv to the prosecution  
jf manufactures, fn&#x27;t ♦«§&#x27;§« ft ion   
ias been noticed, loseS even the appear­  
ince of plausibility,.  
It might alio be observed. with a• con-&#x27;  
rary view, that th« labor employed in  
igricutture fs in a great nieafure period­  
cal and occasional, depending, on fea­  
ons, liable to vai&#x27;ioVis and long intermif­  
ions ; while that occupied in many ma­  
)Ufa&amp;ures i* constant and regular,- ex­  
ending through the year, embracing,  
n some nighf as we&#x27;ll as day.  
tt is also pi&#x27;ubablc, that there are among  
he cultivators of hnd, more examples  
if remifinefsj-than amoiig artificers. he  
armcr, from fh&#x27;e peculiar fertility of  
us land, or fomc other favorable cir­  
;umftan£e, may frequently obtain a live­  
ihood, even with a considerable degree  
&gt;f eareleffnefs in the made of cultivati­  
on : but the artisan Can with difficulty  
-ffeft the fame .object, without exerting  
lim&#x27;fclf pretty equally with all those,  
vho arc engaged in the fame pursuit.  
&lt;\nd if it may likewise be assumed as a  
&#x27;act, that manufactures open a wid&#x27;er  
leld to exertions of ingenuity than agfi­  
-ultufe, if would not be a drained con­  
ectute, that the labor employed in the  
ormer being at once more eonjtant, more  
iniform and more ingenious, than that  
.vhich is employed in the latter, will be  
oundat tfie fame time more productive.  
But it is not meant to lay ftreft on ob­  
&quot;ervations of this nature; they ought on­  
y to serve as a counterbalance to thoic  
jf a frmilar complexion. Circumftanees  
o vague and general, as well as so ab-  
Iract, can afford little interaction in a  
natter of this kind.  
Another, and that which seems to be  
he principal afgument offered for the  
uperior productiveness of agricultural  
abor, turns jspon the allegation, that ra­  
ior employed on manufactures yields  
lothing equivalent to the rent of land ,  
&gt;r to that he&#x27;tt surplus, as it is called,  
,\&#x27;hich accrues to the proprietor of the  
oil. But this diftinftion, important as  
t has been deemed, appears rather ver­  
\al than fiihftantifll

ended. Th:s  
arises principally from three circumstances.  
jft. The greater (kill and dexterity naturally  
resulting from a constant and undivided applica­  
tion to a single ohjeCt. It is evident, that theft  
properties must increase, in proportion to th&lt; se­  
paration and Amplification of objeCts and the  
steadiness of the attention devoted to each $ ano  
must be less, in proportion to the complication oi  
objeCt?, and the number among which the atten­  
tion is dift r aCted.  
zdrf The economy of time, by avoiding the  
lofsof it, incident to a frequent transition from  
one operation to another of a different nature.  
This depends On various circumstances j the tran­  
sition itfelf, the orderly disposition of the imple­  
ments, machines and materials employed in the  
operation to be relinquished, the preparatory step:  
to the comnrencement of a new one, the inter­  
ruption of the impulse, which the mind of the  
workman acquires, from being engaged in a par­  
ticular operation 5 the distraCtions, hesitation?  
and reluCtanCes, which attend the pafTage from  
one kind of business to another.  
3d. An extension of the use of machinery.—A  
man occupied on a single objeCt will have it mori  
in his power, and will be mora naturally led tc  
exert his imagination in devising methods to fa­  
cilitate and abridge tabor, than if he were per­  
plexed by a variety of independent and difliroilai  
operations. Besides this, the fabrication of ma­  
chines, in numerous instances, becoming itfelf ;  
distinCt trade, the artist who follows it, ha 9 al  
the advantages which have been enumerated, Kv  
improvement in his particular art ; anu in botl  
ways the invention and application of machinery  
are extended.  
And from these causes united, the mere fepa­  
rationOf the occupation of the cultivator, front  
that of the artificer, has the effeCt of augment&#x27;  
ing the produSli&lt;vcpo wers of labor, and with them  
the total mass of the produce or revenue of ;  
zouatry. In this fiflgle view of the subjeCt, there  
Tore, the utility of artificers or manufacturers  
towards promoting an increase of productive in  
iirftry, ii apparent.  
11. As to an extension of the use of machinery  
■2 pcir.t ivhich though -partly anticipated, require  
to be placed in one or two additional lights.  
The employment of machinery forms an iteu  
of great importance in the general mass of na  
tional incuftry. *Tis an artificial force trough  
in aid of the natural force of man ; and, to al  
the purposes of labor, is an increase of hands j ai  
ucceflicn of itrength, unincumbered 100 by ike ex  
pence of maintaining the laborer. May it not there  
,ore be fairly inferred, that those occupations  
which give grcateft scope to the use of this aux  
iliary, contribute most to the general stock of in  
riuftrious efFdrt, and, in consequence, to the ge  
neral product of industry ?  
It shall be taken for granted, and the truth o  
:he position referred to observation, that manu  
raCturing pursuits are susceptible in a greater de  
jree of the application of machinery, than thofi  
&gt;f agriculture. If so, all the difference is joft t&lt;  
1 comjnunity, which, instead of manufacturing  
or itfelf, procures the fabrics requisite to its sup

llage j and even  
for the indemnification of agriculture for such as  
might happen to be diverted from it. Many,  
whom manufacturing views would induce to envi-  
Ztate, weuld afterwards yield to the temptation?,  
which the particular situation of this country  
holds out to agricultural pursuits. And while  
r.griculture would in other respeCts derive many  
(ignal and unmingled advantages, from ihegrfwth  
»f manufactures, it is a problem whether \Z  
would gain or lose, as to the article of the number  
»f persons employed in carrying it on.  
V. As to the fumifhing greater feopefer the di- &#x27;  
verfity of talents and difpojitions9 &lt;ivbi:b dijerimi­  
natt men from each other.  
This is a much more powerful mean of augment­  
ing the fund of national industry than may at Aril  
fight appear, it is a just observation, that minds  
of the ft rongeft and moll aCtive powers for their  
proper objects fall below mediocrity and labor  
without effeCt, if confined to uncongenial pur­  
suits. And it is thence to be inferred, that the  
results of human exertion may be immensely in­  
creased by diverfifying its objects. When all the  
different kinds of industry obtain in a communi­  
ty, each individual can rind his proper element&quot;,  
and can call into aCtivfty the whole vigor of Jits  
nature. And the community is benefited by  
the services of its respeCtive members, in th«  
manner, in which each can serve it with mod  
iffcft.  
If there be any thing in a remark often to be  
met with, namely, that there is, in thegemusof  
the people of ihis country, a peculiar aptitude for  
mechanic improvements, it would operate as a  
forcible reason forgiving opportunities to the ex­  
ercising that species of talent, by the propagation  
of manufactures.  
VI. Ai to the affording a Mere ample ar.d va­  
rious field for enterprise.  
This alio is of greater consequence In the ge­  
neral scale of national exertion, than might per­  
haps on a fuperficia) view be supposed, and ha 9  
effedts not altogether difiimlar from those of the  
circumstance last noticed. To chcrlfh and fii­  
mulate the activity of the human mind, by mul­  
tiplying the objeCts of enterprise, is not among  
theleaft considerable of the expedients, by which  
the. wealth of a nation may.be promoted. Even  
things in themselves, not pofitivcly advantageous,  
sometimes become so, by their tendency to pro­  
voke exertion. Every new fc,ene vvnich is open:d  
o the busy nature of man tofroufe and exert it­  
felf, is the addition of a new energy to the ge­  
neral stock of effort.  
The faint of enterprise, ufeful and prolific as it  
s, roust necefiarily be contracted cr expanded  
n proportion to the simplicity or variety of the  
occupations and production*, which are to be  
found in a society. It must be Jpfs in a nation of

VJL to the creating, in some inftanccs, a  
yew, and securing in ill a more certain and Jieady  
Ufnand. for the Jutplui produce of the foil.  
THIS is among the most important of the cir­  
cumtt&#x27;ances which have been indicated. It is a  
principal mean, t&gt;y which the eftablifliment of ma-;  
Jiufadtures contributes to an augmentation of the:  
produce or revenue of a country, and has an im­  
mediate ana due£t relation to the profpeiity of  
agriculture.  
it is evident, that the exertions of the huf­  
tandman will be steady or fluctuating, vigorous or  
leeble, in proportion to the steadiness or fluctu­  
ation, adequatenefs, or inadequatenefs of the  
markets on which he must depend, for the vent  
of the surplus, which may be produced by his  
labor j and that such surplus in the ordinary;  
course of things Will be greater Or less in the  
fame proportion.  
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic mar­  
ket is grt atly to be preferred to a foreign Qne j  
because it is in the nature of things, far more to  
be relied upon.  
It is a primary objeCl of the policy of nations,  
to be able to supply themselves• with subsistence  
from their own foils jand manufacturing nations,  
as far as ctrcumftances permit, endeavor to pro­  
cure from the fame iource, the raw materials ne­  
eeflary for their own fabrics. This disposition,  
uiged by the spirit of monopoly, is foxnetimes  
even carried to an injudicious eXrreme. it seems  
not always to be recolleCted,&#x27; that nations, who  
have neither mines nor manufactures, can only  
obtain the manufactured articles of which they  
fland in need, by an exchange of the produCts of  
their foils ; and that, if thole who can best fur­  
&gt;l iill them with such articles are unwilling to  
give a due course to this exchange, they must of  
neceffit) make every polfible effort to manufacture  
for themselves j the effeCt of which is that the  
manufacturing nations abridge the natural advan­  
tages of their situation, through an unwillingness  
to permit the agricultural countries to enjoy the  
advantages of theirs, and facrifice the interests of  
-a mutual beneficial intercourse to the vain pro­  
jcCt of filling every thing and buying every thing.  
But it is also a consequence of the policy,  
which has been rioted, thac the foreign demand  
tpr the produj&amp;a■ x»f countrie«? \t9 in   
great degree, rather casual and occasional, than  
certain or co&#x27;.ftavt. To what extent injurious  
interruptions or the demand for some of the staple  
Commodities of the United States, may have  
been experienced, from that cause, must be re­  
ferred to the judgment of those who are engaged  
in carrying on the commerce of the country 3 but  
it may be&#x27;fafely affirmed, that such inturruptions  
are at times very inconveniently felt, and that  
cafea not unfrequently occur, in which markets  
arc so confined and restriCted, as to render the  
demand very unequal to the supply.  
independently likewise of the artificial impedi­  
ments, which are created by the policy in quef­  
tfon, there are natural causes tending to render1  
the external denrand for the surplus of agricultu­  
ral nations a precarioos reliance. The differen­

advantages naturally acquired frc.n practice and  
previous pofteilion of the ground, or by those which  
may have fpruo-g. from positive regulations and an  
artificial policy. This geneial reflection mighe  
alone fuffice as an answer to the objection under  
examination 3 exclofively of the weighty confeder­  
ations which have been particularly urged.  
The objeCtionstto the purfuic of manufaCVares in

to discuss.on, rcprefent an impraCt&#x27;cabiiity of suc­  
cess, arifiog from three causes—sear city of hands,&#x27;  
deainefs of labor, want of capital*  
The two firft are to&#x27; a certain ex­  
tent real, and, within due limits, ought to be ad­  
mitted as obffacJes to th 4 fucceis of manufacturing  
enterprise in the United States. But there are va­  
rious confideiations, which lei Ten their force, and  
tend to afford an assurance that ihey are not fulfi­  
qient to prevent th&lt;e advantageous profeeution of  
many Very ufeful and extensive manufactories.  
With regard to scarcity of hands, the faCi itfeif  
must be applied with no imall qualification to cer­  
tain parts of the United1 States. There are   
dift&#x27;riCts, which may be considered as pretty fully  
peopled ; and which notwithstanding a continual  
drain for distant lettlement, are thickly inter­  
spersed with flourifhing and encreaftngtowns. If  
these distriCts have not already reaehed the point,  
at whi-ch the complaint of scarcity of hands Ceases,  
they are not remote from it, and are approaching  
fact towards it: And having perhaps fewer attrac­  
tions to agriculture, than some other parts of th*?  
union, they exhibit a prcportionably stronger ten­  
dency towards other fcind3 of industry, Jn these  
diftri&amp;s, may be discerned, no inconsiderable ma­  
turity for manufacturing eftabliihments,  
Btit there are eircumil&#x27;ances, Which have been  
already noticed with another view, that materially  
diiriiniih every where the effe&amp; of a scarcity of  
hands. These cirCumstances are—the great use  
which can be made of women and children 7 on  
which point a very pregnant and-&#x27; instruCtive fadt  
has been mentioned ; the va-ft extenfron given by  
late improvements to the employment of machines*  
which substituting the agency of fire and water,  
has prodigioully lefifened the ntceility sos manual  
labor ; the employment of persons ordinarily en­  
gaged in other occupations, during the seasons, or  
hours of leisure ; which, besides giving occasion  
to the exertion of a greater quantity of labour by  
the fame number of persons, and thereby encreaf­  
ing the general rtock of labor as has been elsewhere  
remarked, may also be taken into the calculation,  
as a refourcefor obviating the scarcity of hands—  
laflly, the attraction cf foreign emigrants. Who­  
ever inspeCts with a careful eye, the composition  
of our towns, will be made fenGble to what an ex­

deemed a chimerical expectation. There are al  
ready examples of it, as remarked in anothe  
place. And the examples, if the difpofit.on b&lt;  
cultivated, can hardly fail to multiply. Then  
are also instances of another kind, which serve u  
strengthen th» expectation ; enterprises for im  
proving the public communications, by cutting  
jnals, opening the obstruCtions in Tivers, an&lt;  
eieCting bridges, have received very material an  
from the fame foorce.  
  
When tlie mantifaflurir£ capitalist of Europe  
lhall advert to the many important advantages,  
which have been intimated, in the coutfe ol this  
report, he cannot but perceive very powerful in­  
ducements to a transfer ot himfelt and his capital  
to the United Stales. Among the refledhons,  
which a molt interefling peculiarity of situation is  
calculated to fuggell, it cannot escape his observa­  
tion, as a circumltance cut moment in the calcula­  
tion, that the progiefiiVe population and improve­  
ment of the United States, eiifure a continually  
encreafing domeiVic demand fur the fabrics which  
he (hall produce, not to be atf&#x27;cflcd by any exter­  
nal casualties or viciliitudes.  
But while there are circurnftances fufficiently  
llrong to authorise a considerable degree of reli­  
ance on the aid of foreign capital, towards the at­  
tainment of the objeif in view, it is fatirfaftory to  
have good grounds ot allurance, that there »redo­  
meftic relouices of themselves adequate to it. It  
Happens, that there is a species of capital, attually  
existing within the United States, which relieves  
from all inquietude on the score ot want of capi­  
tal—This is the funded debt.—•  
The effedl ot a funded debt, as a species of capi­  
tal, has been noticed upon a tormer occasion ; but  
a more particular elucidation ot the point seems to  
be required by the ltrefs which is here laid upon  
it——l his ihall accordingly be attempted.  
Public funds answer the purpole ot capital, from  
the eltimation in which they are usually held b*  
monied men ; and confequenlly from the cafe and  
dil&#x27;patch with which they can turned into mo­  
ney. This capacity oi&#x27;prompt convertibility into  
money causes a transfer of stock to be in a great  
number of cases equivalent to a pa) ment in com—  
And where it does not happen to suit tile party  
who is to receive, to accept a transfer of ftoclc,  
the party who is to pay, is never at a loss to find  
elsewhere a purchaferof his llock, who will lumi/ii  
him in lieu of it, with the coin of which he itands  
in need.  
Hence in a found and fettled (fate of the public  
unda, a man poiTefied of a sum in them can em­  
irate any scheme of business, which offers, with as  
nuch confidence as if he wete pollelled of an  
qual sum in coin:  
&#x27;1 his operation of public funds, as capital, is too  
&gt;bvious to be denied : but it is objected to the  
dea of their operating as an augmentation of the  
apital of the community, that they feive to occa­  
ion the JtJiruSim of some other capital to an  
qual amount.  
The capital which alone they can be supposed  
0 dellroy, mud consist of—The annual revenue,  
vhich is applied to the payment of interest on  
he debt, and to the gradual redemption of the  
irincipal— The amount of the coin, which is em­  
ployed in circulating the funds, or, in oihei  
vords, in effefling the different alienations which

Tue SECRETARY or THE TREASURY,  
  
IN Obedience to the Order of the Houss of RePRE-  
  
SENTATIVES, of the 15th Day of January, 1790,  
has applied his Attention, at as early a Period as  
  
His other Duties wwould permit, to the Subject of  
MANUFACTURES; and particularly to the Means  
of promoting ſuch as will tend to render the UniTED  
  
STATES independent on foreign Nations, for Mili-  
tary and other eſſential Supplies:  
  
AND HE THEREUPON RESPETFULLY SUBMITS  
THE FOLLOWING  
  
nn Re oP  
  
Tur expediency of encouraging manufactures in the  
United States, which was not lung fince deemed ver  
queſtionable, appears at this time to be pretty generally  
admitted. Ihe embarraſſments which have obltructed tbe  
progreſs of our external trade, have led to {crious reflec-  
tions on the neceſſity of enlarging the ſphere of our do-  
meſtic commerce: the reſtrictive regulations, which in ſo-  
reign markets abridge the vent of the encreaſing ſurplus of  
our agricultural produce, ſerve to beget an carneſt defire  
that a more exteyſive demand for that ſurplus may be  
created at home: And the complete ſucceſs Mich has re-  
warded manufacturing enterpritc, in ſome valuabic brauches,  
conſpiring with the promiling ſymptoms which attend  
ſome leſs mature eſſays in others, juſtify a hope, that the  
obſtacles to the growth of this ſpecies of induſtry are lefs  
formidable than they were apprehended to be; and that it  
is not difficult to find, in its further extenſion, a full in-  
demnification for any external diſadvantages, which are or  
may be experienced, as well as an acceſſion of reſources,  
favourable to national independence and ſafety.  
  
There

There ſtill are, nevertheleſs, reſpectable patrons of opi-  
nions, unfriendly to the encouragement of manufactures.  
The following are, ſubſtantially, the arguments by which  
theſe opinions are defended:  
  
In every country (ſay thoſe who entertain them) agri-  
culture is the moſt beneficial and productive object of hu-  
man induſtry. This poſition, generally, if not univerſally  
true, applies with peculiar emphaſis to the United States,  
on account of their immenſe tracts of fertile territory, un-  
inhabited and unimproved. Nothing can afford ſo advan-  
tageous an employment for capital and labour, as the con-  
verſion of this extenſive wilderneſs into cultivated farms.  
Nothing egually with this, can contribute to the popula-  
tion, ſtrength and real riches of the country.”  
  
„Jo endeavour, by the extraordinary patronage of go-  
vernment, to accelerate the growth of manufactures, is,  
in fact, to endeavour, by force and art, to transfer the na-  
tural current of induſtry, from a more to a leſs beneficial  
channel. Whatever has ſuch a tendency muſt neceſſarily  
be unwiſe: Indeed it can hardly ever be wiſe in a govern-  
ment, to attempt to give a direction to the induſtry of its  
citizens. This, under the quick-ſighted guidance of pri-  
vate intereſt, will, if left to itſelf, infallibly find its own  
way to the moſt profitable employment; and it is by ſuch  
employment, that the public proſperity will be moſt effec-  
tually promoted. Lo leave induitry to itſelf, therefore, is,  
in almoſt every cafe, the ſoundeſt as well as the ſimpleſt  
  
olicy.”  
9 This policy is not only recommended to the United  
States, by conſiderations which affect all nations; it is, in  
a manner, dictated to them by the imperious force of a.  
very peculiar ſituation, The ſmallneſs of their population,  
compared with their territory, the conſtant allurements to  
emigration from the ſettled to the unſettled parts of the  
country; the facility with which the leſs independent con-  
dition of an artiſan can be exchanged for the more inde-  
pendent condition of a farmer; theſe, and ſimilar cauſes,  
conſpire to produce, and for a length of time muſt con-  
tinue to occaſion, a ſcarcity of hands for manufacturing  
occupation, and dearneſs of labour generally. To theſe  
diſadvantages for the proſecution of manufactures, a defi-  
ciency of pecuniary capital being added, the proſpect of a  
ſucceſsful competition with the manufaQurers of Europe,  
muſt be regarded as little leſs than deſperate. Extenſive  
  
manufactures  
  
137.  
  
manufactures can only be the offspring of a redundant,  
at leaſt of a full population. Till the latter ſhall charac-  
teriſe the ſituation of this country, it is vain to hope for the  
former.”  
  
« If, contrary to the natural courſe of things, an un-  
ſeaſonable and premature ſpring can be given to certain fa-  
brics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, bounties, or by other  
forced expedients; this will only be to ſacrifice the intereſts  
of the community to thoſe of particular claſſes. Beſides  
the miſdirection of labour, a virtual monopoly will be given  
to the perſons employed on ſuch fabrics; and an enhance-  
ment of price, the inevitable conſequence of every mono-  
poly, muſt be defrayed at the expence of the other parts of  
the ſociety. It is far preferable, that thoſe perſons ſtiould  
be engaged in the cultivation of the earth, and that we  
ſhould procure, in exchange for its productions, the com-  
modities, with which foreigners are able to ſupply us in  
greater perfection, and upon better terms.”  
  
This mode of reaſoning is founded upon facts and prin—  
ciples, which have certainly reſpectable pretenſions. If i:  
had governed the conduct of nations, more generally than  
it has done, there is room to ſuppoſe, that it might Lave  
carried them faſter to proſperity and greatneſs, than they  
have attained by the purſuit of maxims too widely oppo—  
ſite. Moſt general theories, however, admit of numerous  
exceptions, and there are few, if any, of the political kind,  
which do not blend a conſiderable portion of error with  
the truths they inculcate.  
  
In order to an accurate judgment how fir that Which  
has been juſt ſtated ought to be deemed liable to a fimilar  
imputation, it is neceflary to advert carefully to the con-  
ſiderations which plead in favour of manufactures, and  
which appear to recommend the ſpecial and poſitive en—  
couragement of them, in certain caſes, and under certain  
reaſonable limitations.  
  
It ought readily to be conceded, that ihe cultivation of  
the earth, as the primary and molt certain ſource of na—  
tional ſupply; as the immediate and chief ſource of ſub-  
ſiſtence to man; as the principal ſource of thoſe materials  
which conſtitute the nutriment of other kinds of labour;  
as including a tate molt favourable to the freedom and in-  
dependence of the human mind; one, perhaps, moſt con-  
ducive to the multiplication of the humay ſpecies; has in-  
  
ir11icaliy  
  
1  
  
trinfecally a ſtrong claim to pre- eminence over every other kind  
of induſtry.  
  
But, that it has a title to any thing like an excluſive pre-  
dilection, in any country, ought to be admitted with great  
caution. That it is even more productive than every other  
branch of induſtry, requires more evidence than has yet  
been given in ſupport of the poſition. That its real in-  
tereſts, precious and important as, without the help of ex-  
aggeration, they truly are, will be advanced, rather than  
injured by the due encouragement of manufactures, may,  
it is believed, be ſatisfactorily demonſtrated. And it is  
alſo believed, that the expediency of ſuch encouragement,  
in a general view, may be ſhewn to be recommended by  
the moſt cogent and perſuaſive motives of national policy. 5  
It has been maintained, that agriculture is, not only, 7  
the moſt productive, but the only productive ſpecies of  
induſtry. The reality of this ſuggeſtion, in either reſpect,  
has, however, not been veriſied by an accurate detail of  
facts and calculations; and the general arguments, which  
are adduced to prove it, are rather ſubtil and paradoxical,  
than ſolid or convincing.  
  
Thoſe which maintain its excluſive productiveneſs are to  
  
this effect:  
  
Labour, beſtowed upon the cultivation of land, produces  
  
enough, not only to replace all the neceſſary expences in-  
  
N curred in the buſineſs, and to maintain the perſons who  
  
are employed in it, but to afford, together with the ordinary  
  
5 prefit on the ſtock or capital of the farmer, a nett ſurplus,  
  
j or rent for the landord or proprietor of the ſoil. But the  
  
labour of artificers does nothing more than replace the  
  
ſtock which employs them (or which furniſhes materials,  
  
tools and wages) and yield the ordinary profit upon that  
  
ſtock. It yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land.  
  
Neither does it add any thing to the zotal value of the whole  
  
| annual produce of the land and labour of the country. The  
. additional value given to thoſe parts of the produce of land,  
  
which are wrought into manufactures, is counterbalanced  
  
by the value of thoſe other parts of that produce, which  
  
are conſumed by the manufaCturers. It can therefore only  
  
be by ſaving or parſimony, not by the poſitive produfiveneſs  
  
of their labour, that the claſſes of artificers can in any de-  
  
gree augment the revenue of the ſociety.  
  
To this it has been anſwered,  
  
1. „ That inaſmuch as it is acknowledged, that manu-  
facturing labour produces a value equal to that which is  
expended  
  
=  
  
HE  
  
expended or conſumed in carrying it on, and continues in  
exiſtence the original ſtock or capital employed, it - ought  
on that account alone, to eſcape being conſidered as wholly  
unproductive : That though it ſhould be admitted, as al-  
ledged, that the conſumption of the produce of the ſoil,  
by the claſſes of artificers or manufacturers, is exactly equal  
to the value added by their labour to the materials upon  
which 1t is exerted; yet it would not thence follow, that  
it added nothing to the revenue of the ſociety, or to the  
aggregate value of the annual produce of its land and  
labour. If the conſumption for any given period amounted  
to a given ſum, and the increaſed value of the produce ma-  
nufactured, in the ſame period, to a like ſum, the total  
amount of the conſumption and production during that pe-  
riod, would be equal to the fue /ums, and conſequently  
double the value of the agricultural produce conſumed.  
And though the increment of value produced by the claſſes  
of artificers ſhould at no time exceed the value of the pro-  
duce of the land confumed by them, yet there would be at  
every moment, in conſequence of their labour, a greater  
value of goods in the market than would exiſt indepen-  
dent of it.”  
  
2. © That the poſition, that artificers can augment the  
revenue of a ſociety, only by parſimony, is true in no other  
ſenſe, than in one which is equally applicable to huſband-  
men or cultivators. It may be alike afhrmed of all theſe  
claſſes, that the fund acquired by their labour and deſtined  
for their ſupport, is not, in an ordinary way, more than  
equal to it. And hence it will ſollow, that augmentations  
of the wealth or capital of the community (except in the  
inſtances of ſome extraordinary dexterity or ſkill) can only  
proceed, with reſpect to any of them, from the ſavings of  
the more thrifty and parſimonious.“  
  
3. „ That the annual produce of the land and labour  
of a country can only be increaſed, in two ways by ſome  
improvement in the productive pozbers of the uſeful labour,  
which actually exiſts within it, or by ſome increaſe in the  
quantity of ſuch labour: That with regard to the firſt, the  
labour of artiſicers being capable of greater ſubdiviſion and  
ſimplicity of operation, than that of cultivators, it is ſuſ-  
ceptible, in a proportionably greater degree, of improve-  
ment in its productive powers, whether to be derived from  
an acceſſion of ſkill, or from the application of ingenious  
  
  
ployed  
  
1  
  
ployed in the culture of land can pretend to no advantage  
over that engaged in manufactures: That with regard to  
an augmentation of the quantity of uſeful labour, this, ex-  
cluding adventitious circumſtances, muſt depend eſſentiall  
  
upon an increaſe of capital, which again muſt depend upon  
the ſavings made out of the revenues of thoſe, who furniſh  
or manage that, which is at any time employed, whether  
in agriculture, or in manufactures, or in any other way.”  
  
But while the exclufve productiveneſs of agricultural  
labour has been thus denied and refuted, the ſuperiority of  
its productiveneſs has been conceded without heſitation.  
As this conceſhon involves a point of conſiderable magni-  
tude, in relation to maxims of public adminiſtration, the  
grounds on which it reſts are worthy of a diſtinct and par-  
ticular examination.  
  
One of the arguments made uſe of, in ſupport of the  
idea may be pronounced both quaint and ſuperficial : It  
amounts to this That in the productions of the ſoil, na-  
ture co- operates with man; and that the effect of their  
joint labour muſt be greater than that of the labour of man  
alone.  
  
This, however, is far from being a neceſfary inference.  
It is very conceivable, that the labour

s of two  
capitals employed in a manufactory; as in the other caſe  
the rent of the landlord and the revenue of the farmer com-  
poſe the N proſits of two capitals, employed in the  
cultivation of a farm.  
  
The rent therefore accruing to the proprietor of the  
land, far from being a criterion of exc/uſrve productiveneſs,  
as has been argued, is no criterion even of ſuperior pro-  
ductiveneſs. The queſtion muſt ſtill be, whether the ſur-  
plus, after defraying expences, of a given capital, employed  
in the prrchaſe and improvement of a piece of land, is greater  
or leſs, than that of a like capital employed in the proſecution  
of a manufactory; or whether the «hole value produced from  
a given capital and a given quantity of labour, employed in one  
way, by greater or leſs than the avhole value produced from an  
equal capital and an equal quantity of labour employed in the  
other way; or rather, perhaps, whether the buſineſs of  
agriculture or that of manufactures will yield the greateſt  
product, according to a compound ratio of the quantity of the  
capital and the quantity of labour, which are employed in  
the one or in the other,  
  
The ſolution of either of theſe queſtions is not eaſy ; it  
involves numerous and complicated details, depending on  
an accurate knowledge of the objects to be compared. It is  
not known that the compariſon has ever yet been made upon  
ſufficient data properly aſcertained and analiſed. To be able  
to make it on the preſent occaſion with ſatisfactory preciſion  
would demand more previous inquiry and inveſtigation,  
  
  
accompliſh.  
  
Some eſſays, however, have been made towards acquiring  
the requiſite information; which have rather ſerved to throw  
doubt upon, than to confirm the hypotheſis, under examina-  
  
tion,  
  
on . 2 3 —— n m  
  
  
  
tion. But i it ought to be acknowledged, that they have been  
too little diverſiſied, and are too imperfect to authoriſe a de -  
  
nitive concluſion either way; leading rather to probable cou-  
jecture than to certain deduction. They render it probable,  
that there are various branches of manufactures, in which a  
given capital will yield a greater fetal product, and a conß-  
derably greater nett produtt, than an equal capital inveſted  
in the purchaſe and improvement of lands; and that there  
are alſo ſome branches, in which both the g and the net  
produce will exceed that of agricultural induſtry z accord-  
ing to a compound ratio of capital and labour. But it is on  
this laſt point, that there appears to be the greateſt room for  
doubt. It is far leſs difficult to infer generally, that the Ber?  
produce of capital engaged in manufacturing enterpriſes 1s  
greater than that of capital engaged in agriculture.

opinion that manufaQuring indu/ry is more productive than that  
of agriculture, They are intended rather to ſhew that the re-  
verſe of this propoſition is not aſcertained ; that the general  
arguments which are brought to ellabliſh it are not ſatisfac-  
tory 3 and conſequently that a ſuppoſition of the ſuperior  
produCtiveneſs of tillage ought to be no obſtacle to liſtening  
to any ſubſtantial inducements to the encouragement of ma-  
nuſactures, which may be otherwiſe perceived to exiſt,  
through an apprehenſion, that they may have a tendency to  
divert labour from a more to a leſs profitable employment.  
  
It is extremely probable, that on a full and accurate de-  
velopement of the matter, on the ground of ſaQ and calcu-  
lation, it would be diſcovered that there is no material dit—  
ference between the aggregate productiveneſs of the one,  
and of the other kind of induſtry ; and that the propriety of  
the encouragements, which may in any caſe be pi ropoſed to  
be given to either, ought to be determined upon conſidera-  
tions irrelative to any compariſon of that nature.  
  
II. But without contending for the ſuperior productive—  
neſs of manufacturing induſtry, it may conduce to a better  
jadgment of the policy, which ought to be purſued reſpect-  
ing its encouragement, to contemplate the ſubject, under  
ſome additional aſpects, tending not only to confirm the  
idea, that this king of induſtry has been improperly repre  
ſented as unproductive in itſelf; but to evince in 8  
that the eſtabliſhment and ditfuſion of manufactures have  
the effect of rendering the total mals of uſeful and produc-  
tive labour, in a community, greater than it would otherwiſe  
  
be,  
  
(84-1  
  
be. In proſecuting this diſcuſſion, it may be neceſſary briet-  
ly to reſume and review ſome of the topics which have been  
already touched. |  
  
To affirm that the labour of the manufacturer is unpro-  
duCtive becauſe he conſumes as much of the produce of  
land as he adds value to the raw materials which he manu-  
factures, is not better founded, than it would be to affirm,  
that the labour of the farmer, which furniſhes materials to  
the manufacturer, is unproductive, becauſe he conſumes an  
equal value of manufaftured articles, Each furniſhes a certain  
portion of the produce of his labour to the other, and each  
deſtroys 2 correſpondent portion of the produce of the labour  
of the other.. In the mean time the maintenance of two ci-  
tizens, inſtead of one, is going on; the ſtate has two mem-  
bers inſtead of one; and they together conſume twice the  
value of what is produced from the land.  
  
If inſtead of a farmer and artificer, there were a farmer  
only, he would be urder the neceſlity of devoting a_part of  
his labour to the fabrication of clothing and other articles,  
which he would procure of the artificer, in the cafe of  
there being ſuch a perſon z and of courſe he would be able  
to devote leſs labour to the cultivation of his farm, and  
would draw from it a proportionably leſs product. The  
whole quantity of production, in this ſtate of things, in  
proviſions, raw materials and manufactures, would certain-  
ly not exceed in value the amount of what would be pro-  
duced in proviſions and raw materials only, if there were an  
artificer as well as a farmer.  
  
Again—If there were both an artificer and a farmer, the  
latter would be left at liberty to purſue excluſively the culti-  
vation of his farm. A greater quantity of proviſions and  
raw materials would of courſe be produced, equal, at leaſt,  
as has been already obſerved, to the whole amount of the  
proviſions, raw materials and manufactures, which would  
exi{t on a contrary ſuppoſition. The artificer, at the ſame  
time, would be going on in the production of manufactured  
commodities z to an amount ſufficient not only to repay the  
farmer, in thoſe commodities, for the proviſions and mate-  
rials which were procured from him, but to furniſh the arti-  
ficer himſelf with a ſupply of ſimilar commodities for his own  
uſe. Thus then, there would be two quantities or values in ex-  
iſtence inſtead of one; and the revenue and conſumption  
would be double in one caſe, what it would be in the other.  
  
  
to be two farmers and no artificer, each of whom applied  
| a part  
  
  
  
1  
  
a part of his labour to the culture of land, and another part to  
the fabrication of manufactures; in this caſe, the portion of  
the labour of both beſtowed upon land would produce the  
ſame quantity of proviſions and raw materials only, as  
would be produced by the entire ſum of the labour of one ap-  
lied in the ſame manner, and the portion of the labour of  
th beſtowed upon manufactures, would produce the ſame  
2 of manufactures only, as would be produced by the  
entire ſum of the labour of one applied in the ſame manner.  
Hence the produce of the labour of the two farmers would  
not be greater than the produce of the labour of the farmer  
and artificer ; and hence it reſults, that the labour of the ar-  
tificer is as poſitively productive as that of the farmer, and,  
as poſitively, augments the revenue of the ſociety.  
  
The labour of the artificer replaces to the farmer that  
portion of his labour with which he provides the materials of  
exchange with the artificer, and which he would otherwiſe  
have been compelled to apply to manufactures; and while  
the artificer thus enables the farmer to enlarge his ſtock of  
agricultural induftry, a portion of which he purchaſes for  
his own uſe, he alſo ſupplies himſelf with the manufactured ar-  
ticles of which he flands in need. He does {till more-—Beſides  
this equivalent which he gives for the portion of agricultural  
labour conſumed by him, and this ſupply of manufactured  
commodities for his awn conſumption ; he furniſhes ſtill a  
ſurplus, which compenſates for the uſe of the capital ad-  
vanced either by himſelf or ſome other perſon, for carryin  
on the buſineſs, This is the ordinary profit of the ſtock  
employed in the manufaCtory, and is, in every ſenſe, as  
effeCtive an addition to the income of the ſociety as the rent  
of land. |  
  
The produce of the labour of the artificer conſequently,  
may be regarded as compoſed of three parts ; one by which  
the proviſions for his ſubſiſtence and the materials for his  
  
  
plies himſelf with manufactured neceſſaries, and a third  
which conſtitutes the profit on the ſtock employed. The  
two laſt portions ſeem to have been overlooked in the ſyſ-  
tem, which repreſents manufacturing induſtry as barren and  
unproductive.  
  
In the courſe of the preceding illuſtrations, the products  
of equal quantities of the labour of the farmer and artificer  
have been treated as if equal to each other, But this is not  
to be underſtood as intending to aſſert any ſuch precite equa-  
  
lity.

ty. Tt is merely a manner of expreſſion adopted for the  
fake of ſimplicity and perſpicuity. Whether the value of  
the produce of the labour of the farmer be ſomewhat more  
or leſs than that of the artihcer, is not material to the main  
ſcope of the argument, which hitherto has only aimed at  
ſhewing that the one, as well as the other, occaſions a poſi-  
tive augmentation of the total produce and revenue of the  
ſociety.  
  
It is now proper to proceed a ſtep further, and to enume-  
rate the principal circumſtances, from which it may be in-  
ferred. That manufacturing eſtabliſhments not only occa-  
Gon a poſitive augmentation of the produce and revenue of  
the ſociety, but that they contribute eſſentially to rendering  
them greater than they could poſſibly be, without ſuch eſta-  
bliſkments. &quot;Theſe circumitances are,  
  
1. The divifion of labour.  
  
2. An extenſion of the uſe of machinery.

not ordinarily engaged in the buſineſs,

4. The promoting of cmigration from foreign countries.  
  
5- The furniſhing greater fcope for the diverſity of ta-  
lents and difpofitions which diſcriminate men from  
each other,  
  
6. The affording a more ample and various field for en-  
terpriſe.  
  
7. The creating in ſome inſtances a new, and ſecuring in  
all, a more certain and ſteady demand for the ſurplus  
produce of the ſoil.  
  
Each of thefe circumſtances has a conſiderable influence up-  
on the total maſs of induſtrious effort in a community: to-  
gether, they add to it a degree of energy and effect, which  
are not eaſily conceived. Some comments upon each of  
them, in the order in which they have been ſtated, may  
ſerve to explain their importance.  
  
I. As to the divifion of labour. —  
  
It has juſtly been obſerved, that there is ſcarcely any  
thing of greater moment in the œconomy of a nation, than  
the proper diviſion of labour. &#x27;The ſeparation of occupati-  
ons cauſes each to be carried to a much greater perfection  
than it could poſſibly acquire, if 2 were blended. This  
ariſes principally from three circumſtances.  
  
iſt. The greater ſkill and dexterity naturally reſulting  
from a conſtant and undivided application to a ſingle object.  
It is evident, that theſe properties muſt increafe, in pro-  
portion  
  
4  
portion to the ſeparation and ſimplification of objects and  
the ſteadineſs of the attention devoted to each; and muſt be  
leſs, in proportion to the complication of objects, and the  
number among which the attention is diſtracted.  
  
2d. The ceconomy of time, by avoiding the loſs of it, in-  
cident to a frequent tranſition from one operation to ano-  
ther of a different nature. This depends on various circum-  
ſtances; the tranſition itſelf, the orderly diſpoſition of the  
implements, machines and materials employed in the ope-  
ration to be relinquiſhed, the preparatory ſteps to the com-  
mencement of anew one, the interruption of the impulſe,  
which the mind of the workman acquires, from being en-  
gaged in a particular operation; the diſtractions, heſitati-  
ons and reluctances, which attend the paſſage from one  
kind of buſineſs to another.  
  
3d. An extenſion of the uſe of machinery. A man occu-  
pied on a ſingle object will have it more in his power, and  
will be more naturally led to exert his imagination in deviſ-  
ing methods to facilitate and abridge labour, than if he were  
perplexed by a variety of independent and diſhmilar opera-  
tions. Beſides this, the fabrication of machines, in numer-  
ous inſtances, becoming itſelf a diſtinct trade, the artiſt  
who follows it, has all the advantages which have been enu-  
merated, for improvement in his particular art; and in  
both ways the invention and application of machinery are  
extended.  
  
And from theſe cauſes united, the mere ſeparation of the  
occupation of the cultivator, from that of the artificer, has  
the effect of augmenting the productive powers of labour, and  
with them, the total maſs of the produce or revenue of a  
country. In this ſingle view of the ſubject, therefore, the  
utility of artificers or manufacturers, towards promoting an  
increaſe of productive induſtry, is apparent.  
  
II. As to an extenſion of the uſe of machinery, a point which  
though partly anticipated, requires to be placed in one or two ad-  
ditional lights.  
  
The employment of er we, forms an item of great  
importance in the general maſs of national induſtry, Tis  
an artificial force brought in aid of the natural force of man;  
and, to all the purpoſes of labour, is an increaſe of hands ;  
an acceſhon of ſtrength, umncumbered tos by the expence of  
maintaining the labourer. May it not therefore be fairly in-  
ferred, that thoſe n which give greateſt ſcope to  
  
the  
  
4  
  
the uſe of this auxiliary, contribute moſt to the general ſtock  
  
  
product of induſtry? |  
  
It ſhall be taken for granted, and the truth of the poſition  
referred to obſervation, that manufacturing purſuits are ſuſ-  
ceptible in a greater degree of the application of machinery,  
than thoſe of agriculture. If fo, all the difference is loſt to a  
community, which, inſtead of manufacturing for itſelf,  
procures the fabrics requiſite to its ſupply from other coun-  
tries. The ſubſtitution of foreign for domeſtic manufactures  
is a transfer to foreign nations of the advantages accruing  
from the employment of machinery, in the modes in which  
it is capable of being employed, with moſt utility and to the  
greateſt extent. |  
  
The cotton mill invented in England, within the laſt  
twenty years, is a ſignal illuſtration of the general propoſi-  
tion, which has been juſt advanced. In conſequence of it,  
all the different proceſſes for ſpinning cotton are performed  
by means of machines, which are put in motion by water,  
and attended chiefly by women and children; and by a  
ſmaller number of perſons, in the whole, than are requiſite  
in the ordinary mode of ſpinning. And it is an advantage  
of great moment that the operations of this mill continue  
with convenience, during the night, as well as through the  
day. The prodigious effect of ſuch a machine is eaſily con-  
ceived. To this invention is to be attributed eſſentially the  
immenſe progreſs, which has been ſo ſuddenly made in  
Great Britain in the various fabrics of cotton.  
  
III. As to the additional employment of claſſes of the commu-  
nity, not originally engaged in the particular buſineſs.  
  
This is not among the leaſt valuable of the means, by  
which manufacturing inſtitutions contribute to augment the  
general ſtock of induſtry and production, In places where  
thoſe inſtitutions prevail, beſides the perſons regularly en-  
gaged in them, they afford occaſional and extra employment  
to induſtrious individuals and families, who are willing to  
devote the leiſure reſulting from the intermiſſions of their  
ordinary purſuits to collateral labours, as a reſource for mul-  
tiplying their acquifitions or their enjoyments. The huſ-  
bandman himſelf experiences a new ſource of profit and ſup-  
  
rt from the increaſed induſtry of his wife and daughters  
invited and ſtimulated by the demands of the neighbouring  
manufactories.  
  
Beſide  
  
— 2 ———— **

Beſide this advantage of occaſional employment to claſſes  
having different occupations, there is another of a nature  
allied to it and of a ſimilar tendency. This is, the employ-  
ment of perſons who would otherwiſe be idle (and in many  
caſes a burden on the community) either from the bias of  
temper, habit, infirmity of body, or ſome other cauſe, in-  
diſpoſing or diſqualifying them for the toils of the country.  
It is worthy of particular remark, that, in general, women  
and children are rendered more uſeful, and the latter more  
early uſeful, by manufacturing eſtabliſhments, than they  
would otherwiſe be. Of the number of perſons employed  
in the cotton manufactories of Great Britain, it is com-  
puted that + nearly are women and children; of whom the  
greateſt proportion are children, and many of them of a  
tender age.  
  
And thus it appears to be one of the attributes of manu-  
factures, and one of no ſmall conſequence, to give occaſion  
to the exertion of a greater quantity of induſtry, even by  
the /ame number of perſons, where they happen to prevail,  
than would exiſt, if there were no ſuch eſtabliſhments.  
  
IV. As to the promoting of emigration from foreign countries.  
  
Men reluQantly quit one courſe of occupation and liveli-  
hood for another, unleſs invited to it by very apparent and  
proximate advantages. Many, who would go from one  
country to another, if they had a proſpect of continuing,  
with more benefit, the callings to which they have been  
educated, will often not be tempted to change their fitua-  
tion by the hope of doing better in ſome other way. Manu-  
facturers who, liſtening to the powerful invitations of a bet-  
ter price for their fabrics, or their labour, of greater cheap-  
neſs of proviſions and raw materials, of an exemption from  
the chief part of the taxes, burdens and reſtraints, which  
they endure in the old world, of greater perſonal indepen-  
dence and conſequence, under the operation of a more equal  
government, and of what is far more precious than mere  
religious toleration, a perfect equality of religious privi-  
leges; would probably flock from Europe to the United  
States to purſue their own trades or profeſſions, if they were  
  
  
were inſpired with an aſſurance of encouragement and em-  
ployment, will, with difhculty, be induced to tranſplant  
  
themſelves, with a view to becoming cultivators of land,  
If it be true then, that it is the intereſt of the United  
States to open every poſſible avenue to emigration from  
C 2 abroad,  
  
  
( 26 )  
  
abroad, it affords a weighty argument for the encourage-  
ment of manuſactures; which, for the reaſons juſt aſſigned,  
  
  
to it.  
  
Here is perceived an important reſource, not only ſor  
extending the population, and with it the uſeful and pro-  
ductive labour of the country, but likewiſe for the proſecu-  
tion of manufactures, without deducting from the num-  
ber of hands, which might otherwiſe be drawn to tillage  
and even for the indemnification of agriculture for ſuch as  
might happen to be diverted fromit. Many, whom manu-  
facturing views would induce to emigrate, would after-  
wards yield to the temptations, which the particular fituation  
of this country holds out to agricultural purſuits. And  
while agriculture would in other reſpects derive many ſignal  
and unmingled advantages, from the growth of manu-  
factures, it is a problem whether it would gain or loſe, as  
to the article of the number of perſons employed in carrying  
it on.  
  
V. As to the furniſhing greater ſcope for the diverſity of  
talents and diſpoſitions, which diſcriminate men from each other.  
  
This is a much more powerful mean of augmenting the  
fund of national induſtry than may at firſt ſight appear. It  
is a juſt obſervation, that minds of the ſtrongeſt and moſt  
active powers for their proper objects fall below mediocrity  
and labour without effect, if confined to uncongenial pur-  
ſuits. And it 1s thence to be inferred, that the reſults of  
human exertion may be immenſely increaſed by diverſifying  
its objects. When all the different kinds of induſtry obtain  
in a community, each individual can find his proper element,  
and can call into activity the whole vigour of his nature.  
And the community 1s benefited by the ſervices of its re-  
ſpective members, in the manner, in which each can ſerve  
it with moſt effect.  
  
If there be any thing in a remark often to be met with,  
namely, that there is, in the genius of the people of this  
country, a peculiar aptitude for mechanic improvements, it  
would operate as a forcible reaſon for giving opportunities  
to the exerciſe of that ſpecies of talent, by the propagation  
of manufaQures.  
  
VI. As to the affording a more ample and various field fer  
enterpriſe. |  
  
  
  
„ ”  
  
  
13  
  
de ſuppoſed, and has effects not altogether diſſimilar from  
thoſe of the circumſtance laſt noticed. To cheriſh and ſti-  
mulate the activity of the human mind, by multiplying the  
objects of enterpriſe, is not among the leaſt conſiderable of  
the expedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be  
promoted. Even things in themſelves, not poſitively ad-  
vantageous, ſometimes become ſo, by their tendency to  
provoke exertion. Every new ſcene which is opened to the  
buſy nature of man to rouſe and exert itſelf, is the addition  
of a new energy to the general ſtock of effort.  
  
The ſpirit of enterpriſe, uſeful and prolific as it is, muſt  
neceſſarily be contracted or expanded in proportion to the  
ſimplicity or variety of the occupations and productions,  
which are to be found in a ſociety. It muſt be leſs in a  
nation of mere cultivators, than in a nation of cultivators  
and merchants; leſs in a nation of cultivators and merchants,  
than in a nation of cultivators, artificers and merchants.  
  
VII. As to the creating, in fome inſtancet, a new, and  
  
  
produce of the ſoil.  
  
This is -among the moſt important of the circumſtances  
which have been indicated. It is a principal mean, by  
which the eſtabliſhment of manufactures contributes to an  
augmentation of the produce or revenue of a country, and  
has an immediate and direct relation to the proſperity of  
agriculture.  
  
It is evident, that the exertions of the huſbandman will  
be ſteady or fluCtuating, vigorous or fzeble, in proportion to  
the ſteadineſs or fluctuation, adequateneſs, or inadequate-  
neſs of the markets on which he mult depend, fer the vent  
of the ſurplus, which may be produced by his labour; and  
that ſuch ſurplus in the ordinary courſe of things will be  
greater or leſs in the ſame proportion.  
  
For the purpoſe of this vent, a domeſtic market is greatly  
to be preferred to a foreign one; becauſe it is in the nature  
of things, far more to be relied upon,  
  
It is a primary object of the policy of nations, to be able  
to ſupply themſelves with ſubſiſtence from their own ſoils;  
and manufacturing nations, as far as circumſtances permit,  
endeavour to procure from the ſame ſource, the raw mate-  
rials neceſſary for their own fabrics. This diſpoſition, urged  
by the ſpirit of monopoly, is ſometimes even carried to an  
injudicious extreme. It ſcems not always to be recollected,  
that nations, who have neither mines nor manufactures, can

only obtain the manufactured articles, of which they ſtand  
in need, by an exchange of the products of their ſoils; and  
that, if thoſe who can beſt furniſh them with ſuch articles are  
unwilling to give a due courſe to this exchange, they muſt of  
neceſſity make every poſſible effort to manufacture for them-  
ſelves; the effect of which is that the manufacturing nations  
abridge the natural advantages of their ſituation, through an  
unwillingneſs to permit the agricultural countries to enjoy  
the advantages of theirs, and ſacrifice the intereſts of a  
mutually beneficial intercourſe to the vain project of /el/ing  
  
  
But it is alſo a conſequence of the policy, which has been  
noted, that the foreign demand for the products of agricul-  
tural countries, 1s, 1n a great degree, rather caſual and occa-  
ſional, than certain or conſtant. To what extent injurious  
interruptions of the demand for ſome of the ſtaple commodi-  
ties of the United States, may have been experienced, from  
that cauſe, muſt be referred to the judgment of thoſe who  
are engaged in carrying on the commerce of the country;  
but it may be ſafely aſſirmed, that ſuch interruptions are at  
times very inconveniently felt, and that caſes not unfre-  
quently occur, in which markets are ſo confined and re-  
ſtricted, as to render the demand very unequal to the ſupply.  
  
Independently likewiſe of the artificial impediments  
which are created by the policy in queſtion, there are natu-  
ral cauſes tending to render the external demand for the ſur-  
plus of agricultural nations a precarious reliance. The  
differences of ſeaſons, in the countries which are the con-  
ſumers, make immenſe differences in the produce of their  
own ſoils, in different years; and conſequently in the de-  
grees of their neceſſity for foreign ſupply, Plentiful har-  
veſts with them, eſpecially if ſimilar ones, occur at the  
ſame time in the countries which are the furniſhers, occaſion  
of courſe a glut in the markets of the latter.  
  
Conſidering how faſt and how much the progreſs of new  
ſettlements in the United States muſt increaſe the ſurplus  
produce of the ſoil, and weighing ſeriouſly the tendency of  
the ſyſtem, which prevails among moſt of the commercial  
nations of Europe; whatever dependence may be placed on  
the force of natural circumſtances to counteract the effects  
of an artificial policy ; there appear ſtrong reaſons to regard  
the foreign demand for that ſurplus as too uncertain a  
reliance, and to deſire a ſubſtitute for it, in an extenſive  
domeſtic market.  
  
a | To  
  
  
To ſecure ſuch a market, there is no other expedient,  
than to promote manufacturing eſtabliſhments. Manu-  
facturers who conſtitute the moſt numerous claſs, after the  
cultivators of land, are for that reaſon the principal con-  
ſumers of the ſurplus of their labour.  
  
This idea of an extenſive domeſtic market for the ſurplus  
produce of that ſoil is of the firſt conſequence. It is of all  
things, that which moſt effectually conduces to a flouriſhing  
ſtate of agriculture. If the effect of manufactories ſhould  
be to detach a portion of the hands, which would otherwiſe  
be engaged in tillage, it might poſſibly cauſe a ſmaller  
quantity of lands to be under cultivation; but by their  
tendency to procure a more certain demand for the ſurplus  
produce of the ſoil, they would, at the fame time, cauſe the  
lands which were in cultivation, to be better improved and  
more productive. And while, by their influence, the con-  
dition of each individual farmer would be meliorated, the  
total maſs of agricultural production would probably be in-  
creaſed. For this muſt evidently depend as much, if not  
more, upon the degree of improvement, than upon the  
number of acres under culture,  
  
It merits particular obſervation, that the multiplication  
of manufactories not only furniſhes a market for thoſe  
articles which have been accuſtomed to be produced in abun-  
dance, in a country; but it likewiſe creates a demand for  
ſuch as were either unknown or produced in inconfiderable  
quantities. &#x27;The bowels as well as the ſurface of the earth  
are ranſacked for articles which were before neglected.  
Animals, plants, and minerals acquire a utility and value,  
which were before unexplored.  
  
The foregoing conſiderations ſeem ſuſſicient to eſtabliſh,  
as general propolitions, that it is the intereſt of nations to  
diverſify the induſtrious purſuits of the individuals, who  
compoſe them—That the eſtablithment of manufactures is  
calculated not only to increaſe the general ſtock of uſeful  
and productive labour; but even to improve the ſtate of  
agriculture in particular; certainly to advance the intereſts -  
of thofe who are engaged in it. There are other views,  
that will be hereafter taken of the ſubject, which it is  
conceived, will ſerve to confirm theſe inferences.  
  
[1{. Previouſly to a further diſcuſſion of the objections to  
the encouragement of manufaQures which have been  
ſtated, it will be of uſe to ſee what can be ſaid in refe-  
rence to the particular fituation of the United States, againſt  
  
the  
  
„  
  
the concluſions appearing to reſult from what has been  
zlready offered,  
  
It may be obſerved, and the idea is of no inconſiderable  
weight, that however true it might be, that a ſtate, which  
poſſeſſing large tracts of vacant and fertile territory, was at  
the ſame time ſecluded from foreign commerce, would find  
its intereſt and the intereſt of agriculture, in diverting a  
part of its population from tillage to manufactures ; yet it  
will not follow, that the ſame is true of a ſtate, which hav-  
ing ſuch vacant and fertile territory, has at the ſame time  
ample opportunity of procuring from abroad, on good  
terms, all the fabrics of which it ſtands in need, for the  
ſupply of its inhabitants. The power of doing this at leaſt  
ſecures the great advantage of a diviſion of labour, leaving  
the farmer free to purſue excluſively the culture of his  
land, and enabling him to procure with its products the  
manufactured ſupplies requiſite either to his wants or to his  
enjoyments. And though it ſhould be true, that in ſettled  
countries, the diverfification of induſtry is conducive to an  
increaſe in the productive powers of labour, and to an  
augmentation of revenue and capital; yet it is ſcarcely  
conceivable that there can be any thing of fo ſolid and  
permanent advantage to an uncultivated and unpeopled  
country, as to convert its waſtes into cultivated and  
inhabited diſtricts. If the revenue, in the mean time,  
ſhould be leſs, the capital, in the event, muſt be greater.  
  
To theſe obſervations, the following appears to be a ſa-  
tisfactory anſwer  
  
1. If the ſyſtem of perfect liberty to induſtry and com-  
merce were the prevailing ſyſtem of nations, the arguments  
which diſſuade a country in the predicament of the United  
States, from the zealous purſuit of manufactures would  
doubtleſs have great force. It will not be affirmed, that  
they might not be permitted, with few exceptions, to ſerve  
as a rule of national conduct. In ſuch a ſtate of things,  
each country would have the full benefit of its peculiar ad-  
vantages to compenſate for its deficiencies or diſadvantages.  
If one nation were in condition to ſupply manufactured  
articles on better terms than another, that other might  
find an abundant indemnification in à ſuperior capacity to  
furniſh the produce of the ſoil. And a free exchange,  
mutually beneficial, of rhe commodities which each was  
able to ſupply, on the beſt terms, might be carried on be-  
tween them, ſupporting in full vigour the induſtry of each.  
  
| And  
  
  
And. though the circumſtances which have been mentioned,  
and others which will be unfolded hereafter, render it pro-  
bable, that nations merely agricultural, would not enjoy  
the lame degree of opulence, in proportion to their numbers,  
as thoſe which united manufactures with agriculture ; yet  
the progreſſive improvement of the lands of the former,  
might in the end, atone for an inferior degree of opulence  
in the mean time; and in a caſe, in which oppoſite conſi-  
derations are pretty equally balanced, the option ought per-  
haps always to be, in favour of leaving induſtry to its own  
direction.  
  
But the ſyſtem, which has been mentioned, is ſar from  
characteriſing the general policy of nations. The preva-  
lent one has been regulated by an oppoſite ſpirit. The con-  
ſequence of it is, that the United States are to a certain  
extent in the ſituation of a country precluded from foreign  
commerce. They can, indeed, without difficulty, obtain  
from abroad the manufactured ſupplies, of which they are  
in want; but my experience numerous and very injurious  
impediments to the emiſſion and vent of their own commo-  
dities. Nor is this the caſe in reference to a ſingle foreign  
nation only, The regulations of ſeveral countries, with  
which we have the moſt extenſive intercourſe, throw ſerious  
obſtructions in the way of the principal ſtaples of the  
United States.  
  
In ſuch a poſition of things, the United States cannot  
exchange with Europe on equal terms; and the want cf  
reciprocity would render them the victim of a ſyſtem, which  
ſhould induce them to confine their views to agriculture,  
and refrain from manufactures. A conſtant and increaſ-  
ing neceſſity, on their part, for the commodities of Europe,  
and only a partial and occaſional demand for their own, in  
return, could not but expoſe them to a {tate of impoveriſh-  
ment, compared with the opulence to which their political  
and natural advantages authoriſe them to aſpire.  
  
Remarks of this kind are not made in the ſpirit of com-  
plaint. [is for the nations, whoſe regulations aie alluded  
to, to judge for themſelves, whether by aiming at too  
much, they do not loſe more than they gain. Tis for the  
United States to conſider by what means they can render  
themſelves l-aſt dependent, on rhe combinations, right or  
wrong, of foreign policy.  
  
It is no ſmall conſolation, that already the meaſures which  
have embarraſſed our trade, have accelerated internal im-  
  
D provements,  
  
——  
— ——— Tt CEO rn  
  
( 36 )  
  
provements, which upon the whole have bettered our  
affairs. To diverſify and extend theſe improvements, is the  
ſureſt and ſafeſt method of indemnifying ourſclves for any  
inconveniencies, which thoſe or ſimilar meaſures have a  
tendency to beget. If Europe will not take from us the  
products of our ſoil, upon terms conſiſtent with our intereſt,  
the natural remedy is to contract, as faſt as poſſible, our  
wants of her.  
  
2. The converſion of their waſte into cultivated lands is  
certainly a point of great moment in the political calculati-  
ons of the United States. But the degree in which this  
may poſſibly be retarded by the encouragement of manu-  
factories, does not appear to countervail the powerful  
inducements to affording that encouragement.  
  
An obſervation made in another place is of a nature to  
have great influence upon this queſtion If it cannot be de-  
nied, that the intereſts even of agriculture may be advanced  
more by having ſuch of the lands of a ſtate as are occupied  
under good cultivation, than by having a greater quantity  
occupied under a much inferior cultivation, and if manu-  
factories, for the reaſons aſſigned, muſt be admitted to have  
a tendency to promote a more ſteady and vigorous cultiva-  
tion of the lands occupied, than would happen without  
them, it will follow, that they are capable of indemuifying  
a country for a diminution of the progreſs of new ſettle-  
ments; and may ſerve to increaſe both the capital value and  
the income of its lands, even though they ſhould abridge  
the number of acres under tillage.  
  
But it does, by no means, follow, that the progreſs of  
new ſettlements would be retarded by the extenſion of manu-  
factures. The deſire of being an independent proprietor  
of land is founded on ſuch ſtrong principles in the human  
breaſt, that where the opportunity of becoming ſo is as  
great as it is in the United States, the proportion will be  
ſmall of thoſe, whoſe fituations would otherwiſe lead to it,  
who would be diverted from it towards manufactures. And  
it is highly probable, as already intimated, that the acceſſions  
of foreigners, who are originally drawn over by manu—  
facturing views would afterwards abandon them for agricul-  
tural, would be more than an equivalent for thoſe of our  
oven citizens, who might happen to be detached from them.  
I be remaining objections to a particular encouragement  
  
of manufactures in the United States now require to be  
examined,  
  
One  
  
*.

One of theſe turns on the propoſition, tMat induſtry, if  
left to itſelf, will naturally find its way to the moſt uſeful  
and profitable employment: whence it is inferred, that  
manufactures, without the aid of government, will grow  
up as ſoon and as faſt, as the natural ſtate of things and the  
intereſt of the community may require.  
  
Againſt the ſolidity of this hypotheſis, in the full latitude  
of the terms, very cogent reaſons may be offered. Theſe  
have relation to the ſtrong influence of habit and the ſpirit  
of 1mitation, the fear of want of ſucceſs in untried enter-  
priſes, the intrinſic difficulties incident to firſt eſſays towards  
a competition with thoſe who have previouſly attained to  
perfection in the buſineſs to be attempted, the bounties,  
premiums, and other artificial encouragements, with which  
foreign nations ſecond the exertions of their own citizens  
in the branches, in which they are to be rivalled.  
  
Experience teaches, that men are often ſo much governed  
by what they are accuſtomed to ſee and practice, that the  
ſimpleſt and moſt obvious improvements, in the moſt or-  
dinary occupations, are adopted with heſitation, reluctance,  
and by ſlow gradations. The ſpontzneous tranſition to new  
purſuits, in a community long. habituated to different ones,  
may be expected to be attended with proportionably greater  
difficulty. When former occupations ceaſed to yield a profit  
adequate to the ſubſiſtence of their followers, or when there  
was an abſolute deficiency of employment in them, owing  
to the ſuperabundance of hands, changes would enſue ; but  
theſe changes would be likely to be more tardy than might  
conſiſt with the intereſt either of individuals or of the ſociety.  
In many caſes they would not happen, while a bare ſupport  
could be enſured by an adherence to ancient courſes; though  
a reſort to a more profitable employment might be practica-  
ble. To produce the deſirable changes, as early as may be  
expedient, may therefore require the incitement and patro-  
nage of government,  
  
The apprehenſion of failing in new attempts is perhaps  
a more ſerious impediment. There are diſpoſitions apt to  
be attracted by tne mere novelty of an undertaking; but  
theſe are not always thoſe beſt calculated to give it ſuccelr,  
To this, it is of importance that the confidence of cautious,  
ſagacious capitaliſls, both citizens and foreigners, {ould be  
excited, And to infpire this deſcription of perſons with  
confidence, it is eſſential, that they ſhould be made to fee  
in any project, which is new, and for that reaſon alone, if  
for no other, precarious, the proſpect of ſuch a degree of  
  
2 countenance  
  
(+28 )  
  
countenance and ſupport from government, as may be ca-  
pable of overcoming the obſtacles, inſeparable from firſt ex-  
periments.  
  
The fuperiority antecedently enjoyed by nations, who  
have pre- occupied and perfected a branch of induſtry, con-  
ſtitutes a more formidable obſtacle, than either of thoſe,  
which have been mentioned, to the introduction of the  
ſame branch into a country, in which it did not before exiſt,  
&#x27;To maintain between the recent eſtabliſhments of one  
country, and the long matured eſtabliſhments of an-  
other country, a competition upon equal terms, both as to  
quality and price, is in moſt caſes impraCticable. The  
diſparity, in the one, or in the other, or in both, mult ne-  
ceſſarily be ſo conſiderable as to forbid a ſucceſsful rivalſhip,  
without the extraordinary aid and protection of government,  
  
But the greateſt obſtacle of all to the ſucceſsful proſecution  
of a new branch cf induſtry in a country, in which it was  
before unknown, conſiſts, as far as the inſtances apply, in  
the bounties, premiums, and other aids which are granted,  
in a variety of caſes, by the nations in which the eſtabliſh-  
ments to be imitated are previcully introduced. It is well  
known (and particular examples in the courſe of this report  
will be cited) that certain nations grant bounties on the ex-  
portation of particular commodities, to enable their own  
workmen to underſell and ſupplant all competitors, in the  
countries to which thoſe commadities are ſent. Hence the  
undertakers of a new manufacture have to contend not only  
with the natural diſadvantages of a new undertaking, but  
with the gratuities and remunerations which other govern-  
ments beſtow. To be enabled to contend with ſucceſs, it is  
evident, that the interference and aid of their own govern-  
ment are indiſpenſable.  
  
Combinations by thoſe engaged in a particular branch of  
buſineſs in one country, to fruſtrate the firſt efforts to intro-  
duce it into another, by temporary ſacrifices, recompenſed  
perhaps by extraordinary indemnifications of the government  
of ſuch country, are believed to have exiſted, and are not  
to be regarded as deſtitute of probability. The exiſtence or  
aſſurance of aid from the government of the country, in  
which the buſineſs is to be introduced, may be eſſential to  
fortify adventurers againſt the dread of ſuch combinations—  
to defeat their effects, if formed, and to prevent their being  
  
formed, by demonſtrating that they muſt in the end prove  
fruitleſs. | |  
  
Whatever  
  
  
Whatever room there may be for an expectation that the  
induſtry of a people, under the direction of private intereſt,  
will upon equal terms find out the moſt beneficial employ-  
ment for itſelf, there is none for a reliance, that it will ſtrug-  
gle againſt the force of unequal terms, or will of itſelf ſur-  
mount all the adventitious barriers to a ſucceſsful competi-  
tion, which may have been erected either by the advan-  
tages naturally acquired from practice and previous poſſeſ-  
ſion of the ground, or by thoſe which may have ſprung  
from poſitive regulations and an artificial policy. This ge-  
neral reflection might alone ſuffice as an anſwer to the ob-  
jection under examination; excluſively of the weighty con-  
ſiderations which have been particularly urged.  
  
The objections to the purſuit of manufactures in the  
United States, which next preſent themſelves to diſcuſſion,  
repreſent an impracticability of ſucceſs, arifing from three  
cauſes— ſcarcity of hands, dearneſs of labour, want of ca-  
pital.  
  
The two firſt circumſtances are to a certain extent real,  
and, within due limits, ought to be admitted as obſtacles tv  
the ſucceſs of manufacturing enterpriſe in the United States.  
Put there are various conſiderations, which leſſen their force,  
and tend to afford an aſſurance that they are not ſuſſicient to  
prevent the advantageous proſecution of many very uſctul  
and extenſive manufactories.  
  
With regard to ſcarcity of hands, the fact itſelf muſt be  
applied with no ſmall qualification to certain parts of the  
United States. There are large diſtricts, which may be  
conſidered as pretty fully peopled; and which not withſtand-  
ing a continual drain for diſtant ſettlement, are thickly in-  
terſperſed with flouriſhing and increaſing towns. If theſe  
diſtricts have not already reached the point, at which the  
complaint of ſcarcity of hands ceaſes, they are not remote  
from it, and are approaching faſt towards it: And having  
perhaps fewer attractions to agriculture, than ſome other  
parts of the union, they exhibit a proportionably ſtronger  
tendency towards other kinds of induſtry. In theſe d1t-  
tricts, may be diſcerned, no inconſiderable maturity ivr  
manufacturing eſtabliſnments.  
  
But there are circumſtances, which have been already  
noticed with another view, that materially diminii every  
where the effect of a ſcarcity of hands. Lheſe circum-  
ſtances are-—the great uſe which can be made of women  
and children; on which point a very pregnant and inſtruc-

ce which are paid on their impor-  
tation.  
  
As to the firſt of theſe items, the coſt of materials; the  
advantage, upon the whole, is at preſent on the fide of the  
United States, and the difference, in their favour, muſt  
increaſe, in proportion as a certain and extenſive domeſtic  
demand ſhall induce the proprietors of land to devote  
more of their attention to the production of thoſe mate-  
rials. It ought not to eſcape obſervation, in a compariſon  
on this point, that ſome of the principal manufacturing  
countries of Europe are much more dependent on foreign  
ſupply for the materials of their manuſactures, than  
would be the United States, who are capable of ſupply-  
ing - themſelves with a greater abundance, as well as a  
greater variety of the requiſite materials.  
  
As to the ſecond item, the expence of grounds, build-  
ings, machinery and tolls; an equality at leaſt may be  
aſſumed, ſince advantages in ſome particulars will coun-  
terbalance temporary diſadvantages in others.  
| As to the third item, or the article of wages; the com-  
  
pariſon certainly turns againſt the United States; though  
as before obſcrved, not in ſo great a degree as is com-  
monly ſuppoſed. ;  
  
The fourth item is alike applicable to the foreign and  
to the domeſtic manufacture. It is indeed more properly  
a reſult than a particular, to be compared. |  
But with reſpect to all the remaining items, they are alone  
applicable to the foreign manufacture, and in the ſtricteſt  
ſenſe extraordinaries; conſtituting a ſum of extra charge  
on the foreign fabric, which cannot be eſtimated at leſs  
than from 15 to 30 per cent. on the coſt of it at the manu-  
  
factory.  
This  
  
1  
  
This ſum of extra charge may conſidently be regarded as  
more than a counterpoiſe for the real difference in the price  
of labour; and is a ſatisfactory proof that manufactures  
* proſper in defiance of it in the United States.  
  
o the general allegation, connected with the circum-  
ſtances of ſcarcity of hands and dearneſs of labour, that  
extenſive manufactures can only grow out of a redundant  
or full population, it will be ſufficient, to anſwer gene-  
rally, that the fact has been otherwiſe. —That the ſitua-  
tion alledged to be an eſſential condition of ſucceſs, has not  
been that of ſeveral nations, at periods when they had al-  
ready attained to maturity in a variety of manufactures,  
  
The ſuppoſed want of capital for the proſecution of manu-  
factures in the United States, is the moſt indefinite of the  
objections which are uſually oppoſed to it.  
  
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing preciſe con-  
cerning the real extent of the monied capital of a country,  
and ſtill more concerning the proportion which it bears to  
the objects that invite the employment of capital. It is not  
leſs difficult to pronounce how far the t of any given  
quantity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a  
medium for circulating the induſtry and propertyof a na-  
tion, may be increaſed by the very circumſtance of the ad-  
ditional motion, which is given to it by new objects of em-  
ployment. That effect, like the momentum of deſcending  
bodies, may not improperly be repreſented, as in a com-  
pound ratio to ma/s and velocity. It ſeems pretty certain,  
that a given ſum of money, in a ſituation, in which the -  
quick impulſes of commercial activity were little felt, would  
appear inadequate to the circulation of as great a quantity  
of induſtry and property, as in one, in which their full in-  
fluence was experienced.  
  
It is not obvious, why the ſame objection might not as  
well be made to external commerce as to manufactures ;  
ſince it is manifeſt that our immenſe tracts of land, occu-  
pied and unoccupied, are capable of giving employment to  
more capital than is actually beſtowed upon them. It is  
certain, that the United States offer a vaſt field for the  
advantageous employment of capital, but it does not ſol-  
low, that there will not be found, in one way or ano-  
ther, a ſufficient fund, for the ſucceſsful proſecution of  
any ſpecies of induſtry which is likely to prove truly  
beneficial.  
  
E The  
  
634)  
  
The following conſiderations are of a nature to remove  
all inquietude on the ſcore of want of capital.  
  
The introduction of banks, as has been ſhewn on ano-  
ther occaſion, has a powerful tendency to extend the active  
capital of a country. Experience of the utility of theſe  
inſtitutions is multiplying them in the United States. It  
is probable that they will be eſtabliſhed wherever they can  
exiſt with advantage; and wherever they can be ſupported,  
if adminiſtered with prudence, they will add new energies  
to all pecuniary operations.  
  
The aid of foreign capital may ſafely, and with conſider-  
able latitude be taken into calculation. Its inſtrumentality  
has been long experienced in our external commerce ; and  
it has begun to be felt in various other modes. Not only  
our funds, but our agriculture and other internal improve-  
ments have been animated by it. It has already, in a few  
inſtances, extended even to our manufaQures.  
  
It is a well known fact, that there are parts of Europe,  
which have more capital, than profitable domeſtic objects  
of employment. Hence, _— other proofs, the large  
loans continually furniſhed to foreign ſtates. And it is  
equally certain that the capital of other parts may find  
more profitable employment in the United States, than  
at home. And notwithſtanding there are weiglity induce-  
ments to prefer the employment of capital at home, even  
at leſs profit, to an inveſtment of it abroad, though with  
greater gain, yer theſe inducements are over-ruled, either  
by a deficiency of employment, or by a very material diffe-  
rence in profit. Both theſe cauſes operate to produce a  
transfer of foreign capital to the United States. Tis  
certain, that various objects in this country hold out ad-  
vantages, which are with difficulty to be equalled elfe-  
where; and under the increaſingly favourable impreſſions,  
which are entertained of our government, the attractions  
will become more and more ſtrong. Theſe impreſſions will  
prove a rich mine of proſperity to the country, if they are  
confirmed and ſtrengthened by the progreſs of our affairs.  
And to. fecure this advantage, little more is neceſſary,  
than to foſter induſtty, and guitivate order and tranquillity,  
at home and abroad. 7 83  
  
It is not impollible, that there may be perfons diſpoſed  
to look with a jealous eye on the introduction of foreign  
capital, as if it were an inſtrument to deprive our own citi-  
zens of the profits of our own induftry : But perhaps there  
  
never  
  
Ll  
  
(353  
  
never could be a more unreaſonable jealouſy. Inſtead of  
being viewed as a rival, it ought to be conſidered as a moſt  
valuable auxiliary; conducing to put in motion a greater  
quantity of productive labour, and a greater portion of uſe-  
ful enterpriſe, than could exiſt without it. Ir is at leaſt evi-  
dent, that in a country ſituated like the United States,  
with an infinite fund of reſources, yet to be unfolded, every  
farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in internal  
ameliorations, and in induſtrious eftabliſhments of a per-  
manent nature, is a precious acquiſition.  
  
And whatever be the objects which originally attract fo-  
reign capital, when once introduced, it may be directed  
towards any purpoſe of beneficial exertion, which is de-  
fired. And to detain it among us, there can be no expe-  
dient fo effectual as to enlarge the ſphere, within which  
it may be uſefully employed: though introduced merely  
with views to ſpeculations in the funds, it may after-  
wards be rendered ſubſervient to the intereſts of agri-  
culture, commerce, and manufactures.  
  
But the attraction of foreign capital for the direct pur-  
pole of manufactures ought not to be deemed a chimerial  
expectation. There are already examples of it, as re-  
marked in another place. And the examples, if the diſpo-  
ſition be cultivated, can hardly fail to multiply. There are  
alſo inſtances of another kind, which ſerve to ſtrengthen  
the expectation ; enterpriſes for improving the public com-  
munications, by cutting canals, opening the obſtructions in  
rivers, and ereCting bridges, have received very material aid  
from the ſame ſource.  
  
When the manufacturing capitaliſt of Europe ſhall ad-  
vert to the many important advantages, which have been  
intimated, in the courſe of this report, he cannot but  
perceive very powerful inducements to a transfer of him-  
ſelf and his capital to the United States. Among the  
reflections, which a moſt intereſting peculiarity of ſituation  
is calculated to ſuggeſt, it cannot eſcape his obſervation, as  
a circumſtance of moment in the calculation, that the pro-  
greſſive population and improvement of the United States,  
enſure a continually increaſing domeſtic demand for the  
fabrics which he ſhall produce, not to be affected by any  
external caſualties or viciſſitudes.  
  
But while there are circumſtances ſufficiently ſtrong to  
authoriſe a conſiderable degree of reliance on the aid of  
foreign capital, towards the attainment of the object in  
  
view,  
E 2  
  
1  
  
view, it is ſatisfactory to have good grounds of aſſurance,  
that there are domeſtic reſources of themſelves adequate to  
it, It happens, that there is a ſpecies of capital, actually ex-  
iſting within the United States, which relieves from all in-  
quietude on the ſcore of want of capital—This is the  
funded debt.—  
  
The effect of a funded debt, as a ſpecies of capital, has  
been noticed upon a former occaſion z but a more particu-  
lar elucidation of the point ſeems to be required by the  
ſtreſs which is here laid upon it—This ſhall accordingly  
be attempted.  
  
Public funds anſwer the purpoſe of capital, from the  
eſtimation in which they are uſually held by monied men;  
and ccniequently from the eaſe and diſpatch with which  
they can be turned into money. &#x27;This capacity of prompt  
convertibility into money cauſes a transfer of ſtock to be in  
a great number of caſes equivalent ro a payment in coin—  
And where it does not happen to ſuit the party who is to re-  
ceive, to accept a transfer of ſtock, the party who is to  
pay, is never at a loſs to find elſewhere a purchaſer of  
his itock, who will furniſh him in lieu of it, with the  
coin of which he ſtands in need.  
  
Hence in a ſound and ſettled ſtate of the public funds, a  
man poſſeſſed of a ſum in them can embrace any ſcheme  
of buſineſs, which offers, with as much confidence as if  
he were poſſeſſed of an equal ſum in coin.  
  
T1 his operation of public funds, as capital, is too obvious  
to be denied ; but it 1s objected to the idea of their ope-  
rating as an augmentation of the capital of the commu-  
nity, that they ſerve to occaſion the deſtrufion of ſome  
other capital to an equal amount. ,  
  
The capital which alone they can be ſuppoſed to de-  
ſtroy, muſt conſiſt of—The annual revenue, which is ap-  
plied ta the payment of intereſt on the debt, and to the  
gradual redeinption of the principal—The amount of the  
coin, which is employed in circulating the funds, or, in  
ther words, in effecting the different alienations which  
they undergo.  
  
But the following appears to be the true and accurate  
view of this matter —  
  
 1it. As to the point of the annual revenue requiſite for  
payment of intereſt and redemption of principal.  
  
As a determinate proportion will tend to perſpicuity in  
the reaſoning, let it be ſuppoſed that the annual revenue to  
  
be  
  
(37 1  
  
be applied, correſponding with the modification of the 6 yer  
cent. ſtock of the United States, is in the ratio of eight  
upon the hundred; that is, in the firſt inſtance, fix on  
account of intereſt, and two on account of principal.  
  
Thus far it is evident, that the capital deſtroyed to the  
capital created, would bear no greater proportion than 8 to  
100. There would be withdrawn from the total mats of  
other capitals a ſum of eight dollars to be paid to the  
public creditor z while he would be poſſeſſed of a ſum of  
one hundred dollars, ready to be applied to any purpoſe,  
to be embarked in any enterpriſe, which might appear to  
him eligible—Here then the augmentation of capital, or the  
excels of that which is produced, beyond that which is  
deſtroyed, is equal to ninety two dollars.  
  
To this concluſion it may be objected, that the ſum of  
eight dollars is to be withdrawn annually, until the waole  
hundred is extinguithed, and it may be inferred, that in  
proceſs of time a capital will be deſtroyed equal to that  
which is at fril created.  
  
But it is nevertheleſs true, that during the whole of the  
interval, between the creation of the capital of 100 dol-  
lars, and its reduction to a fum not greater than that  
of the annual revenue appropriated to its redemption —  
there will be a greater active capital in exiitence than it no  
debt had been contracted. The ſum drawn from other ca-  
pitals in any one year will not exceed eight dollars; but there  
will be at every inſtant of time during the whole period in  
queſtion, a ſum correſponding with ſo much of the principle,  
as remains wnredeemed, in the hands of tome perſon or other,  
employed, or ready to be employed in ſome profitable un-  
dertaking. There will therefore conſtantly be more capital,  
in capacity to be employed, than capital taken from em-  
ployment. The exceſs tor the firit- year has been ſtated to be  
ninety-two dollars; it will diminiſh yearly ; but there always  
will be an exceſs, until the principal of the debt is brought  
to a level with the REDEEMING ANNUITY; that is, in  
the caſe which has been afſumed by way of example, to  
EIGHT DOLLARS. The reality of this exceſs becomes  
palpable, if it be ſuppoſed, as often happens, that the citt-  
zen of a foreign country imports into the United States  
100 dollars for the purchaſe of an equal ſum of public debt  
—here is an abſolute augmentation of the maſs of circulating  
coin to the extent of 100 dollars. At the end of a year the  
foreigner is preſumed to draw back eight dollars on account  
  
of  
  
1  
  
of his principal and intereſt, but he till leaves ninety-two  
of his original depoſit in circulation, as he in like manner  
leaves eighty-four at the end of the ſecond year, drawing  
back then alſo the annuity of eight dollars: And thus  
the matter proceeds; the capital left in circulation diminiſh-  
ing each year, and coming nearer to the level of the an-  
nuity drawn back. There are, however, ſqme differences in  
the ultimate operation of the part of the debt, which is  
purchaſed by foreigners, and that which remains in the  
hands of citizens. But the general effect in each caſe,  
though in different degrees, is to add to the active capital  
of the country.  
  
Hitherto the reaſoning has proceeded on a conceſſion of  
the poſition, that there is a deſtruction of ſome other capi-  
tal, to the extent of the annuity appropriated to the pay-  
ment of the intereſt and the redemption of the principal of  
the debt; but in this, too much has been conceded.  
There is at moſt a temporary transfer of ſome other capital,  
to the amount of the annuity, from thoſe who pay, to the  
creditor who receives z which he again reſtores to the  
circulation to reſume the offices of a capital. This he  
does either immediately by employing the money in ſome  
branch of induſtry, or mediately by lending it to ſome  
other perſon, who does ſo employ it, or by ſpending it  
on his own maintenance. In either ſuppoſition, there is  
no deſtruction of capital : there is nothing more than a  
ſuſpenſion of its motion for a time; that is, while it is  
paſſing from the hands of thoſe who pay into the pub-  
lic coffers, and thente through the public creditor into ſome  
other channel of circulation. When the payments of in-  
tereſt are periodical and quick, and made by the inſtru-  
mentality of banks, the diverſion or ſuſpenſion of capital  
may almoſt be denominated momentary. Hence the de-  
duction on this account is far leſs, than it at firſt fight  
appears to be.  
  
There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity, no  
deſtruction nor transfer of any other capital, than that  
portion of the income of each individual, which goes to  
make up the annuity. The land which furniſhes the far-  
mer with the ſum which he 1s to contribute, remains the  
ſame 3, and the like may be obſerved of other capitals.  
Indeed. as far as the tax, which is the object of contribu-  
tion (as frequently happens when it does not oppreſs by its  
weight) may have been a motive to greater exertion in any  
  
| occupation ;  
  
1  
  
occupation; it may even ſerve to increaſe the contributory  
capital: This idea is not without importance in the general  
view of the ſubject.  
  
It remains to ſee, what further deduction ought to be  
made from the capital which is created, by the exiſtence of  
the debt, on account of the coin, which is employed in its  
circulation. This is ſuſceptible of much leſs preciſe cal-  
culation than the article which has been juſt diſcuſſed, It  
is impoſſible to ſay what proportion of coin is neceſſary to  
carry on the alienations which any ſpecies of property uſu-  
ally undergoes. The quantity indeed varies according to  
circumſtances. But it may ſtill without heſitation be pro-  
nounced, from the quickneſs of the rotation, or rather  
of the tranſitions, that the medium of circulation always  
bears but a ſmall proportion to the amount of the property cir-  
culated. And it is thence ſatisfactorily deducible, that the  
coin employed in the negociations of the funds, and which  
ſerves to give them activity, as capital, is incomparably  
leſs than the ſum of the debt negociated for the purpoſe of  
buſineſs.  
  
It ought not, however, to be omitted, that the negocia-  
tion of the funds becomes itſelf a diſtinct buſineſs; which  
employs, and by employing, diverts a portion of the circu-  
lating coin from other purſuits. But making due allowance  
for this circumſtance, there is no reaſon to conclude, that  
the effect of the diverſion of coin in the whole operation  
bears any conſiderable proportion to the amount of the ca-  
pital to which it gives activity. The ſum of the debt in  
circulation is continually at the command of any uſeful  
enterpriſe, the coin itfelf which circulates it, is never more  
than momentarily ſuſpended from its ordinary functions.  
It experiences an inceſſant and rapid flux and reflux to and  
from the channels of induſtry to thoſe of ſpeculations in the  
funds. |  
  
There are ſtrong circumſtances in confirmation of this  
theory. The force of monied capital which has been diſ-  
played in Great Britain, antl the height to which ever  
ſpecies of induſtry has grown up under it, defy a ſolution  
from the quantity of coin which that kingdom has ever  
poſſeſſed. Accordingly it has been coeval with its fundin  
ſyſtem, the prevailing opinion of the men of buſineſs,  
and of the generality of the moſt ſagacious theoriits of that  
country, that the operation of the public funds as capital  
  
has contributed to the effect in queſtion. Among our-  
  
ſelves  
  
„„  
  
ſelves appearances thus far favour the ſame concluſion. In-  
duſtry in general ſeems to have been re- animated. There  
are ſymptoms indicating an extenſion of our commerce.  
Our navigation has certainly of late had a conſiderable  
ſpring, and there appears to be in many parts of the Union  
a command of capital, which, till lately, ſince the revolu-  
tion at leaſt, was unknown. But it 1s at the ſame time to  
be acknowledged, that other circumſtances have concurred  
(and in a great degree) in producing the preſent ſtate of  
things, and that the appearances are not yet ſuſficiently de-  
ciſive ta be entirely relied upon.  
  
In the queſtion under diſcuſſion, it is important to diſ-  
tinguiſh between an abſolute increaſe of capital, or an acceſſion  
cf real wealth and an artificial increaſe of capital, as an en-  
gine of buſineſs, or as an inſtrument of induſtry and com-  
merce. In the firſt ſenſe, a funded debt has no pretenſions  
to being deemed an increaſe of capital; in the laſt, it has  
pretenſions which are not eaſy to be controverted. Of a  
ſimilar nature is bank credit, and, in an inferior degree,  
every ſpecies of private credit.  
  
But though a funded debt is not in the firſt inſtance, an  
abſolute increaſe of capital, or an augmentation of real  
wealth; yet by ſerving as a new power in the operations  
of induſtry, it has within certain bounds a tendency to in-  
creaſe the real wealth of a community; in like manner as  
money borrowed by a thrifty farmer, to be laid out in the  
improvement of his farm, may, in the end, add to his ſtock  
of real riches,  
  
There are reſpectable individuals, who, from a juſt aver-  
fion to an accumulation of public debt, are unwilling to  
concede to it any kind of utility, who can diſcern no good  
to alleviate the ill with which they ſuppoſe it pregnant;  
who cannot be perſuaded, that it ought in any ſenſe to be  
viewed as an increaſe of capital, leſt it ſnould be infer-  
red, that the more debt the more capital, the greater the  
burdens the greater the bleſſings of the community.  
  
But it intereſts the public councils to eſtimate every ob-  
ject as it truly is; to appreciate how far the good in any  
meaſure is compenſated by the ill; or the ill by the good  
either of them is ſeldom unmixed. |  
  
Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of debt is  
defireable, becauſe a certain degree of it operates as capital.  
There may be a plethora in the political, as in the natural  
body ; there may be a ſtate of things in which any ſuch  
  
artificial  
  
(44-3  
  
artificial capital is unneceſſary. The debt too may be  
ſwelled to ſuch a ſize, as that the greateſt part of it may  
ceaſe to be uſeful as a capital, ſerving only to pamper the  
diſſipation of idle and diſſolute individuals; as tha: the  
ſums required to pay the intereſt upon it may become op-  
preſſive, and beyond the means which a government can  
employ, conſiſtently with its tranquillity, to raiſe them; as  
that the reſources of taxation, to face the debt, may have  
heen ſtrained too far to admit of extenſions adequate to exi-  
gencies, which regard the public ſafety.  
  
Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced; but  
it is impoſſible to believe, that there is not ſuch a point.  
  
And as the viciiſitudes of nations beget a perpetual ten-  
dency to the accumulation of debt, there ought to be in  
every government a perpetual, anxious, and unceaſing effort  
to reduce that, which at any time exiſts, as faſt as ſhall  
be practicable, conſiſtently with integrity and good faith.  
  
Reaſonings on a ſubject comprehending ideas ſo abſtract  
and complex, fo little reducible to preciſe calculation as  
thoſe which enter into the queſtion juſt diſcuſſed ; are al-  
ways attended with a danger of running into fallacies.  
Due allowance ought therefore to be made for this poſſibi-  
lity—But as far as the nature of the ſubject admits of it,  
there appears to be ſatisfactory ground for a belief that the  
public ſunds operate as a reſource of capital to the citizens

the United States, appeared to be inadequate to their  
circulation; and their debt to Great-Britain was progreſ-  
five. Since the revolution, the ſtates, in which manu-  
factures have moſt increaſed, have recovered faſteſt from  
the injuries of the late war; and abound moſt in pecuniary  
reſources,  
  
  
1  
  
It ought to be admitted, however, in this as in the pre-  
ceding caſe, that cauſes irrelative to the ſtate of manu-  
factures, account, in a degree, for the phenomena remarked.  
The ccntinual progreſs of new ſettlements has a natural ten-  
tendency to occaſion an unfavourable balance of trade;  
though it indemniſies for the inconvenience, by that increaſe  
of the national capital which flows from the converſion of  
waſte into improved lands: and the different degrees of  
external commerce, which are carried on by the different  
ſtates, may make material differences in the comparative  
late of their wealth. The firſt circumſtance has reference  
to the deficiency of coin and the increaſe of debt previous  
to the revolution; the laſt to the advantages which the  
moſt manufacturing ſtates appear to have enjoyed, over  
the others, ſince the termination of the late war.  
  
But the uniform appearance of an abundance of ſpecie,  
as the concomitant of a flouriſhing ſtate of manufactures,  
and of the reverſe, where they do not prevail, afford a  
ſtrong preſumption of their favourable operation upon the  
wealth of a country.  
  
Not only the wealth, but the independence and ſecurit  
of a country, appear to be materially connected with the  
proſperity of manufaQures. Every nation, with a view to  
thoſe great objects, ought to endeavour to poſi-{3 within  
itſelf all the eſſentials of national ſupply. &quot;Theſe compriſe  
the means of /ub/efence, habitation, clothing, and defence.  
  
The poſſeſhon of theſe is neceſſary to the perfection of  
the body politic, to the ſafety as well as to the welfare of  
the ſociety; the want of either, is the want of an impor-  
tant organ of political life and motion; and in the various  
criſis which await a ſtate, it mult ſeverely feel the effects of  
any ſuch deficiency. The extreme embarraſſments of the  
United States during the late war, from an incapacity of  
ſupplying themſelves, are ſtill matter of keen recollection:  
a future war might be expected again to exemplity the miſ-  
chiefs and dangers of a ſituation, to which that incapacity  
is (till in too great a degree applicable, unleſs changed by  
timely and vigorous exertions. lo effect this change, as  
faſt as ſhall be prudent, merits all the attention and all the  
zeal of our public councils ; it is the next great work to be  
accompliſhed.  
  
The want of a navy to protect our external commerce,  
as long as it ſhall continue, mult render it a peculiarly pre-  
carious reliance, for the ſupply of eſſential articles, and muſt  
  
ſerve  
  
„  
  
( 48 )  
ſerve to ſtrengthen prodigiouſly the arguments in favour of  
manufactures.  
  
To theſe general conſiderations are added ſome of a more  
particular nature.  
  
Our diſtance from Europe, the great fountain of manu—  
factured ſupply, ſubjects us in the exiſting ſtate of things,  
to inconvenience and loſs in two ways.  
  
The bulkineſs of thoſe commodities which are the chief  
productions of the ſoil, neceſſarily impoſes very heavy  
charges on their tranſportation, to diſtant markets. Theſe  
charges, in the caſes, in which the nations, to whom our  
products are ſent, maintain a competition in the ſupply of  
their own markets, principally fall upon us, and form ma-  
terial deductions from the primitive value of the articles  
furniſhed. The charges on manufactured ſupplies, brought  
from Europe are greatly enhanced by the ſame circumſtance  
of diſtance. Theſe charges, again, in the cafes in which  
our own induſtry maintains no competition, in our own  
markets, alſo principally fall upon us; and are an addi-  
tional cauſe of extraordinary deduction from the primitive  
  
  
change for the foreign fabrics, which we conſume.  
The equality and moderation of individual property, and  
  
  
country an unuſual demand for coarſe manufactures; the  
charges of which being greater in proportion to their  
greater bulk, augment the diſadvantage, which has been  
  
  
As in moſt countries domeſtic ſupplies . maintain a very  
conſiderable competition with ſuch foreign productions of the  
ſoil, as are imported for ſale; if the extenſive eſtabliſhment  
of manufactories in the United States does not create a  
ſimilar competition in reſpect to manufactured articles, it  
appears to be clearly deducible, from the conſiderations  
which have been mentioned, that they muſt ſuſtain a  
double loſs in their exchanges with foreign nations ; ſtrongly  
conducive to an unfavourable balance of trade, and very  
prejudicial to their intereſts.  
  
Theſe diſadvantages preſs with no ſmall weight, on the  
landed intereſt of the country. In ſeaſons of peace, they  
cauſe a ſerious deduction from the intrinſic value of the  
products of the foil. In the time of a war, which  
ſhould either involve ourſelves, or another nation, poſ-  
ſeſſing a conſiderable ſhare of our carrying trade, the  
  
charges  
  
132221  
  
charges on the tranſportation of our commodities, bulky as  
moſt of them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous  
burden to the farmer; while obliged to depend in ſo great  
degree as he now does, upon foreign markets for the vent  
of the ſurplus of his labour.  
  
As far as the proſperity of the fiſheries of the United  
States is impeded by the want of an adequate market, there  
ariſes another ſpecial reaſon for deſiring the extenſion of  
manufactures. Beſides the fiſh, which in many places,  
would be likely to make a part of the ſubſiſtence of the per-  
ſons employed; it is known that the oils, bones and ſkins  
of marine animals, are of extenſive uſe in various manu-  
factures. Hence the proſpect of an additional demand for  
the produce of the fiſheries.  
  
One more point of view only remains, in which to con-  
  
ſider the expediency of encouraging manufactures in the  
United States.  
  
  
the promoting of manufactures, may be the intereſt of a  
part of the union, it is contrary te that of another part.  
The northern and ſouthern regions are ſometimes repre-  
ſented as having adverſe intereſts in this reſpect. Thoſe  
are called manufacturing, theſe agricultural ſtates, and a  
ſpecies of oppoſition is imagined to ſubſiſt between the ma-  
nufacturing and agricultural intereſts.  
  
This idea of an oppoſition between thoſe two intereſts is  
the common error of the early periods of every country,  
but experience gradually diſhpates it. Indeed they are  
perceived ſo often to ſuccour and to befriend each other,  
that they come at length to be conſidered as one; a ſuppo-  
ſition which has been trequently abuſed, and is not univer-  
ſally true. Particular encouragements of particular manu-  
factures may be of a nature to ſacrifice the intereſts of land-  
holders to thoſe of manufacturers ; but it is nevertheleſs a  
maxim well eſtablithed by experience, and generally ac-  
knowledged, where there has been ſufficient experience,  
that the aggregate proſperity of manufactures, and the ag-  
gregate proſperity of agriculture are intimately connected.  
In the courſe of the diſcuſſion which has had place, various  
weighty conſiderations have been adduced operating in ſup-  
port of that maxim. Perhaps the ſuperior ſteadineſs of the  
demand of a domeſtic market for the ſurplus produce of  
the ſoil, is alone a convincing argument of its truth.

Ideas of a contrariety of intereſts between the northern  
and ſouthern regions of the Union, are in the main as  
unfounded as they are miſchievous. The diverſity of cir-  
cumſtances, on which ſuch contrariety is ufually predicated,  
authoriſes a directly contrary concluſion. Mutual wants  
conſtitute one of the ſtrongeſt links of political connec-  
tion, and the extent of theſe bears a natural proportion to  
the diverſity in the means of mutual ſupply.  
  
Suggeſtions of an oppoſite complexion are ever to be de-  
plored, as unfriendly to the ſteady purſuit of one great com-  
mon cauſe, and to the perfect harmony of all the parts.  
  
In proportion as the mind is accuſtomed to trace the in-  
timate connexion of intereſt, which ſubſiſts between all the  
parts of a ſociety, united under the /ame government; the  
infinite variety of channels which ſerve to circulate the  
proſperity of each to and through the reſt, in that pro-  
portion will it be little apt to be diſturbed by ſolicitudes  
and apprehenſions which originate in local diſcriminations.  
It is a truth as important, as it is agreeable, and one to  
which it is not eaſy to imagine exceptions, that every  
thing tending to eſtabliſh /ub/antial and permanent order, in  
the affairs of a country, to increaſe the toral maſs of in-  
duſtry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to every part  
of it. On the credit of this great truth, an acquieſcence  
may ſafely be accorded, from every quarter, to all inſtitu-  
tions, and arrangements, which promiſe a confirmation of  
public order, and an augmentation of national reſource.  
  
But there are more particular conſiderations which ſerve  
to fortify the idea, that the encouragement of manufac-  
tures is the intereſt of all parts of the Union. If the  
northern and middle ſtates ſhould be the principal ſcenes  
of ſuch eſtabliſhments, they would immediately benefit  
the more ſouthern, by creating a demand for productions;  
ſome of which they have in common with the other  
{tates, and others of which are either peculiar to them,  
or more abundant, or of better quality, than elſewhere.  
Theſe productions, principally are timber, flax, hemp,  
cotton, wool, raw ſilk, indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides,  
ſkins, and coals; of theſe articles cotton and indigo are pe-  
culiar to the ſouthern ſtates; as are hitherto lead and coal, flax  
and hemp are or may be raiſed in greater abundance there,  
than in the more northern ſtates; and the wool of  
Virginia is ſaid to be of better quality than that of an  
other ſtate : a circumſtance rendered the more probable by  
the reflection that Virginia embraces the ſame latitudes with  
  
the  
  
1  
  
the fineſt wool countries of Europe. The climate of the  
ſouth is alſo better adapted to the production of ſilk.  
  
The extenſive cultivation of cotton can perhaps hardly  
be expected, but from the previous eſtabliſhment of do-  
meſtic manufactories of the article; and the ſureſt encou-  
ragement and vent, for the others, would reſult from ſimi-  
lar eſtabliſhments in reſpect to them. :  
  
If, then, it ſatisfactorily appears, that it is the intereſt  
of the United States, generally, to encourage manufac-  
tures, it merits particular attention, that there are cir-  
cumſtances which render the preſent a critical moment  
for entering with zeal upon the important buſineſs. The  
effort cannot fail to be materially ſeconded by a conſider-  
able and increaſing influx of money, in conſequence of fo-  
reign ſpeculations in the funds and by the diſorders which  
exiſt in different parts of Europe.  
  
The firſt circumſtance not only facilitates the execution  
of manufacturing enterpriſes ;z but it indicates them as a  
neceſſary mean to turn the thing itſelf to advantage, and to  
prevent its being eventually an evil. If uſeful employment  
be not found tor the money of foreigners brought to the  
country to be inveſted in purchaſes of the public debt,  
it will quickly be re-exported to defray the expence of an  
extraordinary conſumption of foreign luxuries; and diſ-  
treſſing drains of our ſpecie may hereafter be experienced  
to pay the mtereſt and redeem the principal of the pur-  
chaſed debt.  
  
This uſeful employment too ought to be of a nature to  
produce ſolid and permanent improvements. If the money  
merely ſerves to give a temporary ſpring to foreign com-  
merce; as it cannot procure new and lalting outlets for the  
products of the country ; there will be no real or durable ad-  
vantage gained, As far as it ſhall find its way in agricultu-  
ral ameliorations, in opening canals, and in fimilar improve-  
ments, it will be productive of ſubſtantial utility. But  
there is reaſon to doubt, whether in ſuch channels it is  
likely to find ſufficient employment, and ſtill more whether  
many of thoſe who poſſeſs it, would be as readily attracted  
to objects of this nature, as to manufacturing purſuits ;  
which bear greater analogy to thoſe to which they are ac-  
cultomed, and to the ſpirit generated by them.  
  
To open tlie one field, as well as the other, will at leaſt  
ſecure a better proſpect of uſeful employment, for whatever  
acceſſion of money there has been or may be.  
  
G 2 There  
  
„  
  
There is at the preſent juncture a certain fermentation  
of mind, a certain aCtivity of ſpeculation and enterpriſe,  
which if properly directed, may be made ſubſervient to  
uſeful purpoſes; but which if left entirely to itſelf, may  
be attended with pernicious effects.  
  
The diſturbed {tate of Europe, inclining its citizens to  
emigration, the requiſite workmen, will be more eaſily  
acquired, than at another time; and the effect of mul-  
tiplying the opportunities of employment to thoſe who  
emigrate, may be an increaſe of the number and extent of  
valuable acquiſitions to the population, arts and induſtry  
of the country.  
  
To find pleaſure in the calamities of other nations would  
be criminal; but to benefit ourſelves, by opening an aſylum  
to thoſe who ſuffer, in conſequence of them, is as juſti-  
fiable as it 1s politic.  
  
A full view having now been taken of the inducements  
to the promotion of manufactures in the United States,  
accompanied with an examination of the principal objections  
which are commonly urged i oppyetion, it is proper in the  
next place to conſider the means by which it may be effected,  
as introductory to a ſpecification of the objects which in  
the preſent ſtate of things appear the moſt fit to be en-  
couraged, and of the particular meaſures which it may be  
adviſeable to adopt, in teſpect to each.

the jea-  
louſy of enabling foreign workmen to rival thoſe of the na-  
tion, with its own materials, are the leading motives to  
  
this ſpecies of regulation. It ought not to be athrmed, that  
it is in no inſtance proper; but it is certainly one which  
ought to be adopted with great circumſpection, and only in  
very plain caſes. It is ſeen at once, that its immediate  
operation, is to abridge the demand and keep down the  
price of the produce of ſome other branch of induſtry, ge-  
nerally ſpeaking, of agriculture, to the prejudice of thoſe  
who carry it on; and though if it be really eſſential to the  
proſperity of any very important national manufacture, it  
may happen that thoſe who are injured in the firſt inſtance,  
may be eventually indemnihed, by the ſuperior ſteadineſs of  
an extenſive domeſtic market depending on that proſperity :  
yet ina matter, in which rhere is ſo much room for nice  
and diſhcul: combinations, in which ſuch oppoſite conſider-  
ations combat each other, prudence ſeems to dictate, 80  
the  
  
  
  
  
( 54 )  
  
the expedient in queſtion, ought to be indulged with a  
ſparing hand.  
  
IV. Pecuniary bounties.  
  
This has been found one of the moſt efficacious means of  
encouraging manufactures, and it is in ſome views, the beſt.  
Though it has not yet been praiſed upon by the govern-  
ment of the United States (unleſs the allowance on the ex-  
portation of dried and pickled fiſh and ſalted meat could be  
conſidered as a bounty) and though it is leſs favoured by  
public opinion than ſome other modes ts advantages are  
theſe—  
  
1. It is a ſpecies of encouragement more poſitive and  
direct than any other, and for that very reaſon, has a more  
immediate tendency to ſtimulate and uphold new enterpriſes,  
mcrealing the chances of proſit, and diminiſhing the riſks  
of loſs, in the firſt attempts.  
  
2. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmen-  
tation of price, which is incident to ſome other modes,  
or it produces it to a leſs degree; either by making no ad-  
dition to the charges on the rival foreign article, as in the  
caſe of protecting duties, or by making a ſmaller addi-  
tion. The firſt happens when the fund for the bounty  
is derived from a different object (which may or may not  
increaſe the price of ſome other article, according to the  
nature of that object; the ſecond, when the fund is de-  
rived from the ſame or a ſimilar object of foreign manu-  
fecture. One per cent. duty on the foreign article con-  
verted into a bounty on the domeſtic, will have an equal  
edect with a duty of two per cent. excluſive of ſuch bounty;  
and the price of the foreign commodity is liable to be raiſed,  
in the one caſe, in the proportion of one per cent.; in the  
other, in that of two per cent. Indeed the bounty when  
drawn from another ſource is calculated to promote a reduc-  
tion of price; becauſe without laying any new charge on  
the foreign article, it ſerves to introduce a competition with  
it, and to increaſe the total quantity of the article in the  
  
market.  
  
3. Bounties have not like high protecting duties, a ten-  
dency to produce ſcarcity. An increaſe of price is not al-  
ways the immediate, though, where the prognet of a do-  
meſtic manufacture does not counteract a rife, it is com-  
monly the ultimate effect of an additional duty. In the  
unerval, between the laying of the duty and a *  
  
tiona  
  
  
3  
  
tional increaſe of price, it may diſcourage importation,  
by interfering with the profits to be expected from the ſale  
of the article.  
  
4. Bounties are ſometimes not only the beſt, but the  
only proper expedient, for uniting the encouragement of a  
new object of agriculture, with that of a new object of  
manufacture. It is the intereſt of the farmer to have the  
production of the raw material promoted, by counteracting  
the interference of the foreign material of the ſame kind  
It is the intereſt of the manufacturer to have the mate-  
rial abundant and cheap. If prior to the domeſtic pro-  
duction of the material, in ſuihcient quantity, to ſupply  
the manufacturer on good terms, a duty be laid upon the  
importation of it from abroad, with a view to promote the  
raiſing of it at home, the intereſt both of the farmer  
and manufacturer will be diſſerved —By either deſtroying  
the requiſite ſupply, or raiſing the price of the article,  
beyond what can be afforded to be given for it, by the  
conductor of an infant manufacture, it is abandoned or fails,  
and there being no domeſtic manufaQories to create a de-  
mand for the raw material, which is raifed by the farmer,  
it is in vain, that the competition of the like foreign article,  
may have been deſtroyed.  
  
It cannot eſcupe notice, that a duty upon the importa-  
tion of an article can no otherwiſe aid the domeſtic pro-  
duction of it, than by giving the latter greater advantages  
in the home market. It can have no influence upon the  
advantageous fale of the article produced, in foreign mar-  
d kets; no tendency, therefore, to promote its exportation.  
  
The true way to conciliate theſe two intereſts, is to lay a  
duty on foreign manufafures of the material, the growth of  
which 1s deſired to be encouraged, and to apply the produce  
of that duty by way of bounty, either upon the production  
of the material itſelf, or upon its manufacture at home, or  
upon both. In this diſpoſition of the thing, the manufac-  
turer commences his enterpriſe, under every advantage,  
which is attainable, as to quantity or price of the raw ma-  
terial : And the farmer, if the bounty be immediately to  
him, is enabled by it to enter into a ſucceſsful competition  
with the foreign material; if the bounty be to the many-  
facturer on ſo much of the domeſtic material as he conſumes,  
the operation is nearly the fame; he has a motive of intereſt  
to prefer the domeſtic commodity, if of equal quality, even  
at a higher price than the foreign, ſo long as the difference  
  
Ot  
  
by  
  
1  
  
of price is any thing ſhort of the bounty, which is allowed  
upon the article.  
  
Except the ſimple and ordinary kinds of houſehold ma—  
nufacture, or thoſe for which there are very commanding  
local advantages, pecuniary bountics are in meſt cafes in-  
diſpenfable to the introduction of a new branch. A ſtimulvs  
and a fupport not leſs powerful and direct is, generally  
ſpeaking, efſential to the overcoming of the obſtacles which  
ariſe from the competitions of {uperior ſkill and maturity  
elſewhere. Bounties are eſpecially eſſential, in regard to  
articles, upon which thote foreigners who have been ac-  
cuſtomed to ſupply a country are in the practice of granting  
them. |  
  
The continuance of bounties on manufactures long eſta—  
bliſned, muſt almoſt always be of queſtionable policy:  
Becauſe a preſumption would ariſe in every ſuch calc,  
that there were natural and inherent impediments to fuc-  
ceſs. But in new undertakings, they are as juſtibable, as  
they are oftentimes necetlary.  
  
There is a degree of prejudice againſt bounties from an  
appearance of giving away the public money, without an  
immediate conſideration, and from a ſuppoſition, that they  
ſerve to enrich particular claſſes, at the expence of the  
community.  
  
But neither of theſe ſources of diſlike will bear a ſerious  
examination. There is no purpoſe to which public money  
can be more beneficially applied, than to the acquiſition of  
a new and uſeful branch of induſtry ; no conſideration more  
valuable than a permanent addition to the general ſtock of  
productive labour.  
  
As to the ſecond ſource of objection, it equally lies  
againſt other modes of encouragement which are admitted to  
be eligible. As often as a duty upon a foreign article  
makes an addition to its price, it cauſes an extra expence to  
the community, for, the benefit of the domeſtic manu-  
ſacturer. A bounty does no more. But it is the intereſt of  
the ſociety in cy caſe to ſubmit to a temporary expence,  
which is more than compenſated, by an increafe of in-  
duſtry and wealth, by an augmentation of reſources and  
independence; and by the circumſtance of eventual cheap-  
neſs, which has been noticed in another place.  
  
It would deſerve attention, however, in the employment  
of this ſpecies of encouragement in the United States, as  
  
  
in  
  
  
  
Tos 2 8  
  
in which it might be deemed eligible, that the great diſ-  
tance of this cov ntry from Europe impoſes very heavy  
charges on all the fabrics wtic!: 25© ought from thence,  
amounting from 15 to 30 per cent. on &quot;their value, ac-  
cording to their bulk,  
  
A queition has becn made concerning the conſtitutional  
right of the government of the United States to apply this  
ſpecies of encouragement, but there is certainly no good  
foundation for ſuch a queſtion. The N:tional Legiſlature  
has expreſs authority “ To lay and collect taxes, duties,  
impoſts, and excifes, to pay the debts and provide for the  
common defence and general welfare,” with no other qualiſica-  
tions than that “ all duties, impoſts, and exciſes, ihall be  
uniform throughout the United States, that no capitation or  
other direct tax ſhall be laid ualzſs in proportion to num-  
bers alcertained by a cenſus or enumeration taken on the  
principles preſcribed in the Conſtitution, and that “ no tax  
or duty ſuall be laid on articles exported from any ſtate.“  
  
Theſe three qualifications excepted, the power to raiſe  
money is plenary and indefinite; and the objects to which it  
may be eppropriated are no leſs compreticnbive, than the  
payment of the public debts and the providing for the com-  
mon defence and general welfare, The terms “e general  
welfare” were doubtleſs intended to ſigniſy more than  
was expreſſed or imported in thoſe which preceded ;  
otherwite numerous exigencies incident to the affairs of a  
nation would have been left without a proviſion.—  
The phraſe is as comprehenſive as any that could have  
beca uſed ; becauſe it was not fit that the conſtitutional  
authority of the Union, to appropriate its revenues ſhould  
have been reſtricted within narrower limits than the  
„general welfare;“ ani! becaute this neceflarily embraces  
a vaſt variety of particu!.&#x27;s, which arc ene neicher  
of ſpecification nor of definition.  
  
It is therefore of necciuty left to the diſcretion of the  
National Legiſlature, to pronounce, upon the objects,  
which concern the general welfare, and tor wnich, under  
that deſcription, an appropriation of monev is requiſite and  
proper,—And there ſeems to be no room ſor a doubt that  
whatever concerns the general intereſts of LEARNING, of  
AGRICUL TURE, of MANUFACTURES, and of COMMERCE,  
are within the ſphere of the National Councils, as far as  
regards an ee F money. |

The only qualiſication of the generality of the phraſe in  
queſtion, which ſeems to be admiſſible, is this That the  
object to which an appropriation of money is to be made be  
  
  
poſſibility throughout the Union, and not being confined to  
  
  
No objection ought to ariſe to this conſtruction from a  
ſuppoſition that it would imply a power to do whatever elſe  
ſhould appear to Congreſs condacive to the general welfare.  
A power to appropriate money with this latitude, which is  
granted too in expreſs terms, would not carry a power to do  
  
any other thing, not authoriſed in the Conſtitution, either  
expreſsly or by fair implication.  
  
V. Premiums.  
  
Theſe are of a nature allied to bounties, though diſtin-  
guiſhable from them in ſome important features.  
  
Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article  
produced or manufactured, or exported, and involve a cor-  
reſpondent expence—Premiums ſerve to reward ſome parti-  
cular excellence or ſuperiority, ſome extraordinary exertion  
or ſkill, and are diſpenſed only in a ſmall number of caſes :  
But their effect is to ſtimulate general effort—contrived ſo  
as to be both honorary and lucrative, they addreſs themſelves  
to different paſſions; touching the chords as well of emula-  
tion as of intereſt. —They are accordingly a very economical  
mean of exciting the enterprife of a whole community.  
  
There are various ſocieties in different countries, whoſe  
object is the diſpenſation of premiums for the encourage-  
ment of agriculture, arts, manufactures, and commerce; and  
though they are for the moſt part voluntary aſſociations,  
with comparatively ſlender funds, their utility has been im-  
menſe. Much has been done by this mean in Great Bri-  
tain : Scotland in particular owes materially to it a prodi-  
gious amehoration of condition. From a ſimilar eftabliſh-  
ment in the United States, ſupphed and ſupported by the  
Government of the Union, vaſt benefits might reaſonably be  
expected. Some further ideas on this head, ſhall accord-  
ingly be ſubmitted, in the concluſion of this report.  
  
  
duty.  
  
Ihe policy of that exemption as a general rule, particu-  
larly in reference to new eſtabliſhments, is obvious. It can  
  
hardly ever be adviſeable to add the obſtructions of fiſcal  
; | burdens  
  
4  
  
  
(59. 3  
  
burdens to the diſſiculties which naturally embarraſs a new  
manufacture; and where it is matured and in condition to  
become an object of revenue, it is generally ſpeaking better  
that the fabric, than the material, ſhould be the ſubject of  
taxation, Ideas of proportion between the quantum of the  
tax and the value of the article, can be more eaſily adjuſted  
in the former than in the latter caſe. An argument for ex-  
emptions of this kind in the United States, is to be derived  
from the practice, as far as their neceſſities have permitted,  
of thoſe nations whom we are to meet as competitors in our  
own and in foreign markets.  
  
There are however exceptions to it; of which ſome ex-  
amples will be given under the next head.  
  
The laws of the Union afford inſtances of the obſervance  
of the policy here recommended, but it will probably be  
tound adviſeable to extend it to ſome other caſes—Of a na-  
ture, bearing ſome affinity to that policy, is the regulation  
which exempts from duty the tools and implements, as well  
as the books, clothes and houſehold furniture of foreign ar-  
tilts, who come to reſide in the United States; an advan-  
tage already ſecured to them by the laws of the Union, and  
which, it is, in every view, proper to continue.  
  
VII, Drawbacks of the duties which are impoſed on the  
  
materials of manufaftures,  
  
It has already been obſerved as a general rule, that duties

internal improvements of primary magnitude might be pro-  
moted, by an authority operating throughout the Union,  
which cannot be eſteched, as well, if at all, by an authority  
confined within the limits of a ſingle ſtate.  
  
  
that miglit be wiſhed, it is at leaſt deſireable, that all may  
be done which is pract:cable. Means for promoting the  
introduction of foreign improvements, though lefs ethcaci-  
ouſly than might be accompliſhed with more adequate au-  
thority, ui form a part of the plan intended to be ſub-  
mitt-d in the cloſe of this report.  
  
It is cultomary with manufacturing nations to prohibit,  
under fevere penalties, the exportation oi implements and  
machines, which they have either invented or improved.  
There are already objects for a ſimilar regulation in the  
United States; and others may be expected to occur from  
time to time. The adoption of it ſeems to be dictated by  
the principle of reciprocity, Greater liberality, in ſuch  
reſpects might better comport with the general ſpirit of the  
country; but a ſelſiſh and excluſive policy in other quarters  
will not alway permit the free indulgence of a ſpirit, which  
would place us upon an unequal footing. As far as prohi-  
bitions tend to prevent foreign competitors from derivin  
the benefit of the improvements made at home, they tend to  
increaſe the advantages of thoſe by whom they may have  
  
been introduced ; and operate as an encouragement to  
exertion.  
  
IX. Judicigus regulations for the inſpectien of manufactured  
commodities,  
  
This is not among the lealt important of the means, by  
which the proſperity of manufactures may be promoted.  
It is indeed in many caſes one of the moſt eſſential. Con-  
tributing to prevent frauds upon conſumers at home, and  
exporters to foreign countries—to improve the quality -and  
preſerve the character of the national manufactures, it can-  
not fail to aid the expeditious and advantageous ſale of them,  
and to ſerve as a guard againlt ſucceſsful competition from  
other quarters. &quot;Lhe reputation of the flour and lumber of  
ſome ſtates, and of the potaſh of others, has been eſta-  
bliſhed by an attention to this point. And the like good  
name might be procured tor thoſe articles, whereſoever pro-  
duced, by a judicious and uniform ſyſtem of inſpection,  
  
| throughout  
  
( 62 )  
  
throughout the ports of the United States. A like ſyſtem  
might alſo be extended with advantage to other commodi-  
ties.  
  
X. The facilitating of pecuniary remittances from place to  
flace—  
  
Is a point of conſiderable moment to trade in general,  
and to manufactures in particular; by rendering more eaſy  
the purchaſe of raw materials and proviſions, and the pay-  
ment for manufactured ſupplies. A general circulation of  
bank paper, which is to be expected from the inſtitution  
lately eſtabliſned will be a moſt valuable mean to this end.  
But much good would alfo accrue from ſome additional pro-  
viſions reſpeting inland bills of exchange. If thoſe drawn  
m one ſtate payable in another were made negotiable,  
every where, and intereſt and damages allowed in caſe of  
proteſt, it would greatly promote negotiations between the  
  
  
and, with it the convenience and advantage of the mer-  
chants and manufacturers of each.  
  
XI. The facilitating of the tranſportation of commodities.  
  
Improvements favouring this object intimately concern  
all the domeſtic interefts of a community; but they may  
without impropriety be mentioned as having an important  
relation to manufactures. There ts perhaps ſcarcely any  
thing, which has been better calculated to aſſiſt the manu-  
ſactures of Great-Britain, than the ameliorations of the  
public roads of that kingdom, and the great progreſs which  
has been of late made in opening canals. Of the former,  
the United States ſtand much in need; for the latter they  
preſent uncommon facilities.  
  
The ſymptoms of attention to the improvement of in-  
hand navigation, which have lately appeared in ſome quar-  
ters, muſt fill with pleafure every breaſt warmed with a  
true zeal for the proſperity of the country. Theſe examples, it  
1s to be hoped, will ſtimulate the exertions of the government  
and citizens of every ſtate. There can certainly be no ob-  
ject, more worthy of the cares of the local adminiſtrations;  
and it were to be wiſhed, that there was no doubt of the  
  
wer of the national government to lend its direct aid, on  
2 comprehenſive plan. This is one of thoſe improvements,  
which could be proſecuted with more efficacy by the whole,  
than by any part or parts of the Union. There are Fati 0  
  
whic  
  
  
  
( 03  
  
which the general intereſt will be in danger to be ſacri-  
ficed to the collifion of ſome ſuppoſed local intereſts, Jea-  
louſies, in matters of this kind, are as apt to exiſt, as they  
are apt to be erroneous.  
  
The following remarks are ſufficiently judicious and per-  
tinent to deſerve a literal quotation : * Good roads, canals  
and navigable rivers, by diminiſhing the expence of carriage,  
put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon a level with  
thoſe in the neighbourhood of the town. They are upon  
that account the greatelt of all improvements. They encourage  
the cultivation of the remote, which muſt always be the moſt  
extenſive circle of the country. They are advantageous to  
the town by breaking down the monopoly of the country in  
its neighbourhood, They are advantageous even to that part  
  
  
dities into the old market, they open many new markets to  
itz produce. Monopoly beſides is a great enemy to good  
management, which can never be univerſally eſtabliſhed,  
but in conſequence of that free and univerſal competition,  
which forces every body to have recourſe to it for the ſake  
of ſelf defence. It is not more than fifty years ago that  
ſome of the counties in the neighbourhood of London petitioned the  
Parliament, againſ} the extenſion of the turn-pike roads, into the  
remoter counties. T1 hoſe remoter counties, they pretended, from  
the cheapneſs of labour, would be able to ſell their graſs and corn  
cheaper in the London market, than themſelves, and they would  
thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation. Their  
rents however have riſen, and their cultivation has been im-  
proved, ſince that time.“  
  
Specimens of a ſpirit, ſimilar to that which governed the  
counties here ſpoken of preſent themſelves too frequently, to  
the eye of an impartial obſerver, and render it a with of pa-  
triotiſm that the body in this country, in whoſe councils a  
local or partial ſpirit is leaſt likely to predominate, were at  
liberty to purſue and promote the general intereſt, in thoſe  
inſtances, in which there might be danger of tlie interfe-  
rence of ſuch a ſpirit.  
  
The foregoing are the principal of the means, by which  
the growth of manufactures is ordinarily promoted. It is,  
however, not merely neceſſary, that the meafures of go-  
vernment, which have a direct view to manufactures, ſhould  
be calculated to aſſiſt and protect them, but that thoſe which  
only ere affect them, in the general courſe of the ad-  
miniſtration, ſhould be guarded from any peculiar tendency  
to injure them. ö  
  
There  
  
„  
  
There are certain ſpecies of taxes, which are apt to be  
oppreſſive to different parts of the community, and among  
other ill effects have a very unfriendly aſpect towards mau-  
factures. All poll or capitation taxcs are of this nature.  
They either proceed, according to a fixed rate, which ope-  
rates uncqually, and injuriouſly to the induſtrious poor; or  
they veſt a diſcretion in certain officers, to make eſtimates  
and atlefſments which are neceſſarily vague, conjeciural and  
liable to abuſe. They ought therefore to be abſtained from,  
in all but caſes of diſtreſſing emergency.  
  
All ſuch taxes (including all taxes on occupations) which  
proceed according to the amount of capita! /zppsſed to be em-  
ployed in a buſineſs, or of profits ſuppeſed to be made in it  
are unavoidably hurtful to induſtry. It is in vain, that the  
evil may be endeavoured to be mitigated by leaving it, in  
the ſirſt inſtance, in the option of the party to be taxed, to  
declare the amount of his capital or profits,  
  
Men engaged in any trade or buſineſs have common!  
weighty reaſons to avoid diſcloſures, which would expoſe,  
with any thing like accuracy, the real ſtate of their affairs.  
They moſt frequently find it better to riſk oppreſſion, than  
to avail themſelves of fo inconvenient a refuge. And the  
conſequence is, that they often ſutter oppreſſion.  
  
When the diſcloſure too, it made, 1: not definitive, but  
comroulable by the diſcretion, or in other words, by the  
paſſions and prejudices of the revenue officers, it is not only  
an ineflectual protection, but the poſſibility of its being ſo  
is an additional reaſon for not reſorting to it.  
  
Allowing to the public oſſicers the moſt equitable diſpoſi-  
tions; yet where they are to exerciſe a diſcretion, without  
certain data, they cannot fail to be often miſled by ap-  
pearances. he quantity of buſineſs, which ſeems to be  
going on, is, in a vaſt number of caſes, a very deceitful  
criterion of the profits which are made; yet it is perhaps  
the beſt they can have, and it is the one, on which they  
will moſt naturally rely. A buſineſs therefore which may  
rather require aid, from the government, than be in a capa-  
city to be contributory to it, may find itſelf cruſhed 7 the  
miſtaken conjectures of the aſſeſſors of taxes.  
  
Arbitrary taxes, under which denomination are com—  
priſed all thoſe, that leave the quantum of the tax, to be  
raiſed on each perſon, to the diſcretion of certain officers,  
are as contrary to the genius of liberty as to the maxims of  
induſtry. In this light, * have been viewed by the moſt  
  
judicious  
  
1  
  
judicious obſervers on government; who have beſtowed  
upon them the ſevereſt epithets of reprobation; as conſti-  
tuting one of the worſt features uſually to be met with in  
the practice of deſpotic governments.  
  
It is certain at leaſt, that ſuch taxes are particularly ini-  
mical to the ſucceſs of manufacturing induſtry, and ought  
carefully to be avoided by a government, which deſires  
to promote it.  
  
The great copiouſneſs of the ſubjeCt of this report has in-  
ſenſibly led to a more lengthy preliminary diſcuſſion, than  
was originally contemplated, or intended. It appeared pro-  
per to inveſtigate principles, to conſider objections, and to  
endeavour to eſtabliſh the utility of the thing propoſed to be  
encouraged ; previous to a ſpecification of the objects which  
might occur, as meriting or requiring encouragement, and  
of the meaſures, which might be proper, in reſpect to  
each. &#x27;The firſt purpoſe having been ſulfilled, it remains  
to purſue the ſecond. |  
  
In the ſelection of objects, five circumſtances ſeem en-  
titled $0 particular attention : The capacity of the country  
to furniſh the raw material —the degree in which the nature  
of the manufacture admits of a ſubſtitute for manual labour  
in machinery—the facility of execution—the extenſiveneſs  
of the uſes, to which the article can be applied—its ſub-  
ſerviency to other intereſts, particularly the great one of na-  
tional defence. There are however objects, to which theſe  
circumſtances are little applicable, which for ſome ſpecial  
reaſons, may have a claim ro encouragement.  
  
A deſignation of the principal raw material of which  
each manufacture is compoſed will ſerve to introduce the  
remarks upon it, —As, in the firſt place

The manufactures of this article are entitled to pre- emi-  
nent rank None are more eſſential in their kinds, nor fo  
extenſive in their uſes. They conſtitute in whole ur in part  
the implements or the materials, or both, of almoſt every  
uſeful occupation. Their inſtrumentality is every where  
conſpicuous.  
  
It is fortunate for the United States that they have pecu-  
liar advantages for deriving the full benefit of this moſt  
valuable material, and they have every motive to improve  
it, with ſyſtematic care. It is to be found in various parts

metal itſelf, and of converting it to a  
greater number of profitable purpoſes,  
  
Thofe manufactures too umite in a greater degree, than  
  
  
mentioned, as proper to be conſulted in the ſelection of  
objects.  
  
The only further encouragement of manufaQories of this  
article, the propriety of which may be conſidered as un-  
queſtionable ſeems to be an increaſe of the duties on foreign  
rival commodities.  
  
Steel is a branch which has already made a conſiderable  
progreſs, and it is aſcertained that ſome new enterpriſes, on  
a more extenſive ſcale, have been lately ſet on foot. The  
  
  
internal demands, and furniſh a conſiderable ſurplus for  
exportation cannot be doubted. The duty upon the impor-  
tation of this article, which is at prefent ſeventy-five cents  
per cwt. may, it is conceived, be ſafely and advantageouſly  
extended to 100 cents. It is delireable, by decifive ar-  
rangements, to ſecond the efforts, which are making in ſo  
very valuable a branch. _

The United States already in a great meaſure ſupply  
themſelves with nails and ſpikes. They are able, and  
ought certainly to do it entirely. The firſt and moſt la-  
borious operation, in this manufaCture, is performed by  
water-mills; and of the perſons afterwards employed a  
great proportion are boys, whoſe early habits of induſtry are  
of importance to the community, to the preſent ſupport of  
their families, and to their own future comfort. It is not  
leſs curious than true, that in certain parts of the country,  
the making of nails is an occaſional family manufacture.  
  
The expediency of an additional duty on theſe articles is  
indicated by an important fact. About 1,800,000 pounds  
of them were imported into the United States in the courſe  
of a year, ending the 3&lt;th of September, 1799. A duty  
of two cents per pound would, it is preſumable, ſpeedily  
put an end to ſo conſiderable an importation. And it is in  
every view proper that an end ſhould be put to it.  
  
The manufacture of theſe articles, like that of ſome  
others, ſufiers from the careleſſneſs and diſhoneſty of a part  
of thole who carry it on, An inſpection in certain caſes  
might tend to correct the evil. It will deſerve conſideration  
whether a regulation of this ſort cannot be applied, withour  
inconvenience, to the exportation of the articles either to  
foreign countries, or from one {tate to another.  
  
The implements of huſbandry are made in ſeveral itates  
in great abundance. In many places it is done by the  
common blackſmiths. And there is no doubt that an am-  
ple ſupply for the whole country can with great cafe be  
procured among ourſelves.  
  
Various kinds of edged tools for the uſe of mechanics are  
alſo made; and a conſiderable quantity of hollow wares  
though the buſineſs of caſtings has not yet attained the per-  
fection which might be wiſhed. It is however improving,  
and as there are reſpectable capitals in good hands, em-  
barked in the profecution of thoſe branches of iron manu-  
factories, which are yet in their infancy, they may all be  
contemplated as objects not difficult to be acquired.  
  
To enſure the end, it ſeems equally fafe and prudent to  
extend the duty advalorem upon all manufactures of iron,  
or of which iron is the article of chief value, to ten per  
cent.  
  
Fire arms and other, military weapons map, it is conceived,  
be placed without inconvenience in the claſs of articles rated  
at fifteen per cent. There exiſt already manufactories of

theſe articles, which only require the ſtimulus of a certain  
demand to render them adequate to the ſupply of the United  
States  
  
It would alſo be a material aid to manuſactories of this  
nature, as well as a mean of public ſecurity, if proviſion  
ſhould be made for an annual purchaſe of military weapons,  
of home manufacture to a certain determinate extent, in  
order to the formation of arſenals; and to replace from time  
to time ſuch as ſhould be withdrawn for uſe, ſo as always  
to have in ſtore the quantity of each kind, which ſhould be  
deemed a competent ſnpply.  
  
But it may hereafter deſerve legiſlative conſideration,  
whether manufactories of all the neceſſary weapons of war  
ought not to be eſtablithed, on account of government it-  
ſelf. Such eſtabliſhments are agreeable to the uſual  
practice of nations, and that practice ſeems ſounded on  
ſufficient reaſon.  
  
There appears to be an improvidence, in leaving theſe  
eſſential inſtruments of national defence to the caſual ſpe-  
culations of individual adventure; a reſource which can leſs  
be relied upon, in th&#x27;s caſe than in moſt others; the ar-  
ticles in queſtion not being objects of ordinary and indiſ-  
penſable private conſumption or uſe. As a general rule,  
manufactories on the immediate account of government are  
to be avoided z but this ſeems to be one of the few excep-  
tions, which that rule admits, depending on very ſpecial  
reaſons.  
  
Manufactures of ſteel, generally, or of which ſteel  
is the article of chief value, may with advantage be  
placed in the claſs of goods rated at ſeven and an half per  
cent. As manufactures of this kind have not yet made any  
conſiderable progreſs, it is a reaſon for not rating them as  
high as thoſe of iron; but as this material is the baſis of  
them, and as their extenſion is not leſs practicable, than  
important, it is deſirable to promote it by a ſomewhat  
higher duty than the preſent.  
  
A queſtion ariſes, how far it might be expedient to per-  
mit the importation of iron in pigs and bars free from duty.  
It would certainly be favourable to manufactures of the ar-  
ticle ; but the doubt is whether it might not interfere with  
its production. 1755  
  
Two circumſtances, however, abate if they do not  
remove apprehenſion, on this ſcore; one is, the conſider-  
able increaſe of price, which has been already remarked,

There are numerous proofe, that this material abounds  
in the United States, and requires little to unfold it to an  
extent, more than equal to every domeſtic occaſion. A  
prolific mine of it has long been open in the ſouth-weſtern  
parts of Virginia, and under a public adminiſtration, dur-  
ing the late war, yielded a conſiderable ſuppiy for military  
ufe. This is now in the hands of individuals, who not only  
carry it on with ſpirit, but have eſtabliſhed manufactories  
of it, at Richmond, in the ſame ſtate.  
  
The duties, already laid upon the importation of this  
article, either in its unmanufactured, or manufactured  
ſtate, enſure it a deciſive advantage in the home market  
which amounts to conſiderable encouragement. If the  
duty on pewter wares ſhuuld be raiſed, it would afford a  
  
further encouragement. Nothing elte occurs as proper to  
be added.

on the ſcore of ſupply from ſuch an increaſe. _  
  
It would be of benefit to this branch, if glue, which  
is now rated at five per cent. were made the object of an  
excluding duty. It is already made in large quantities at  
various tanneries z and, like paper, is an entire economy of  
materials, which, if not manufactured, would be left to

connected with navigation and defence; and of  
which a flouriſhing manufactory is eſtabliſhed at Boſton,  
and very promiſing ones at ſeveral other places.  
  
It is preſumed to be both ſafe and adviſeable to place  
this in the claſs of articles rated at 10 per cent. A ſtrong  
reaſon for it reſults from the conſideration that a bounty of  
two pence ſterling per ell is allowed, in Great Britain,  
upon the exportation of the fail cloth manufactured in that  
kingdom.  
  
It would likewiſe appear to be good policy co raiſe the  
duty to 75 per cent. on the following articles. Drillings,  
oſnaburghs, ticklenburghs, dowlas, canvas, brown rolls,  
bagging, and upon all other linens the firſt coſt of which  
at the place of exportation does not exceed 35 cents per  
vard. A bounty of 125 per cent. upon an average, on  
the exportation of ſuch or ſimilar linens from Great-Britain,  
encourages the manufacture of them in that country, and  
increaſes the obſtacles to a ſucceſsful competition, in the  
countries to which they are ſent. _ 6  
  
The quantities of tow and other houſehold linens manu-  
factured in different parts of the United States, and the  
expectations, which are derived from ſome late experi-  
ments, of being able to extend the uſe of labour-ſaving  
machines, in the coarſer fabrics of linen, obviate the  
danger of inconvenience, from an increaſe of the duty  
upon ſuch articles, and authoriſe a hope of ſpeedy and  
  
complete ſucceſs to the endeavours, which may be uſed  
for procuring an internal ſupply. _  
  
  
CTY:  
Thirdly. As to direct bounties, or premium upon the ma-  
  
nufaftured articles.  
  
To afford more effectual encouragement to the manu-  
facture, and at the ſame time to promote the cheapneſs  
of the article for the benefit of navigation, it will be  
of great uſe to allow a bounty of two cents per yard on  
all fail cloth which is made in the United States, from  
materials of their own growth. This would alſo aſſiſt the  
culture of thoſe materials. An encouragement of this kind,  
if, adopted, ought to be eſtabliſhed for a moderate term  
of years, to invite to new undertakings, and to an ex-  
tenſion of the old. This is an article of importance enough  
to warrant the employment of extraordinary means in its  
  
favour.  
ed. 1 a 4 «ny  
  
There is ſomething in the texture of this material, which  
adapts it in a peculiar degree to the application of machines.  
The fignal utility of the mill for ſpinning of cotton, not  
long ſince invented in England, has been noticed in an—  
other place; but there are other machincs ſcarcely inferior  
in utility, which, in the different manufactorics of this  
article are employed either excluſively, cr with more than  
ordinary effect. I his very important circumſtance recom-  
mends the fabrics of cotton, in a more particular manner,  
to a country in which a defect of hands conſtitutes the  
  
reateſt obſtacle to ſucceſs.  
  
The variety and extent of the uſes to which the ma-  
nufactures of this article are applicable, is another powerful  
argument in their favour.  
  
And the faculty of the United States to produce the  
raw material in abundance, and of a quality, which though  
alledged tc b interior to ſome that is produced in other  
quarters, is neverthelets capable of being uſed with ad-  
vantage, in many faorics, and is probably ſuſceptible of  
being carried, by a more experienced culture, to much  
grcati perfection, ſuggeſts an additional and a very cogent  
inducement to the vigorous purſuit of the cotton branch,  
11 its ſeveral ſubdiviſions.  
  
How much has been already done has been ſtated in a  
preceding part of this report.  
  
In addition to this, it may be announced, that a ſo—  
ciety is forming with a capital which is expected to be ex-  
tended to at leaſt half a million of dollars; on behalf of  
  
which

which meaſures are already in train for proſecuting on a  
large ſcale, the making and printing of cotton goods.  
  
Theſe circumſtances conſpire to indicate the expediency  
of removing any obſtructions which may happen to exiſt,  
to the advantageous proſecution of the manufaCtories in  
queſtion, and of adding ſuch encouragements as may ap-  
pear neceſſary and proper.  
  
The preſent duty of three cents per Ib. on the foreign  
raw material, is undoubtedly a very ſerious impediment to  
the progreſs of thoſe manufactories.  
  
The injurious tendency of ſimilar duties, either prior to  
the eſtabliſhment, or in the infancy of the domeſtic manu-  
facture of the article, as it regards the manufacture, and  
their worſe than inutility, in relation to the home pro—  
duction of the material itſelf, have been anticipated, par-  
ticularly in diſcuſſing the ſubject of pecuniary bounties.  
  
Cotton has not the ſame pretenſions, with hemp, to  
form an exception to the general rule.  
  
Not being, like hemp, an univerſal production of the  
country, it affords leſs aſſurance of an àdequate internal  
ſupply ; but the chief objeCtion ariſes from the doubts,  
which are entertained concerning the quality of the national  
cotton. It is alledged, that the fibre of it is conſi-  
derably ſhorter and weaker, than that of ſome other  
places; and it has been obſerved as a general rule, that the  
nearer the place of growth to the equator, the better the  
quality of the cotton. That which comes from Cayenne,  
Surrinam and Demarara is ſaid to be preferable, even at a  
material difference of price, to the cotton of the Iflands.  
  
While a hope may reaſonably be indulged, that with due  
care and attention the national cotton may be made to  
approach nearer than it now does to that of regions, ſome-  
what more favoured by climate, and while facts autho-  
  
  
and that it is a reſource which gives greater ſecurity to  
  
  
any which depends wholly on external ſupply, it will  
certainly be wife, in every view, to let our infant manufac-  
tures have the full benefit of the beſt materials on the  
cheapeſt terms. It is obvious that the neceſſity of having  
ſuch materials is proportioned to the unſkilfulneſs and inex-  
perience of the workmen employed, who, if inexpert, will  
not fail to commit great waſte, where the materials they  
arc to work with are of an indifferent kind.  
  
To

To ſecure to the national manufacturers ſo eſſential an  
advantage, a repeal of the preſent duty on imported cotton  
is indiſpenſable.  
  
A ſubſtitute for this, far more encouraging to domeſtic  
production, will be ro grant a bounty on the national cot-  
ton, when wrought at a home manufactory; to which a  
bounty on the exportation of it may be added. Either or  
both would do much more towards promoting the growth of  
the article, than the merely nominal encouragement, which  
it is propoſed to aboliſh. The firſt would alſo have a direct  
influence in encouraging the manufacture.  
  
The bounty, which has been mentioned as exiſting in  
Great Britain, upon the exportation of coarſe linens not  
exceeding a certain value, applies alfo to certain deſcriptions  
of cotton goods of ſimilar value.  
  
This furniſhes an additional argument for allowing to the  
national manufacturers the ſpecies of encouragement juſt  
ſuggeſted, and indeed for adding ſome other aid.  
  
One cent per yard, not leſs than of a given width,  
on all goods of cotton, or of cotton and linen mixed, which  
are manufactured in the United States, with the addition  
of one cent per Ib. weight of the material, if made of  
national cotton, would amount to an aid of conſiderable  
importance, both to the production and to the manufac-  
ture of that valuable article. And it is conceived, that the  
expence would be well juſtified by the magnitude of the  
  
  
The printing and ſtaining of cotton goods is known to  
  
  
one eaſily accompliſhed, and which, as it adds materially  
  
  
for a variety of new uſes, is of importance to be pro-  
  
moted. |  
As imported cottons, equally with thoſe which are made  
at home, may be the objects of this manufacture, it will  
merit conſideration, whether the whole, or a part of the  
duty, on the white goods, ought not to be allowed to be  
drawn back in favour of thoſe, who print or {tain them.  
This meaſure would certainly operate as a powerful encou-  
ragement to the buſineſs; and though it may in a degree  
counteract the original fabrication of the articles, it would  
probably more than compenſate for this diſadvantage, in  
the rapid growth of a collateral branch, which is of a  
nature ſooner to attain to maturity. When a ſuſſicient pro-

as inferior to any, which relates to the clothing of the in-  
habitants.  
  
Houſchold manufactures of this material are carried on,  
in different parts of the United States, to a very intereſting  
extent; but there is only one branch, which as a regular

Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with fur, are made in /  
large quantities, in different ſtates; and nothing ſeems |  
wanting, but an adequate ſupply of materials, to render the  
manufacture commenſurate with the demand.  
  
A promiſing eſſay, towards the fabrication of cloths,  
caſhmires and other woollen goods, is likewiſe going on at [  
Hartford, in Connecticut. Specimens of the different kinds  
which are made, in the poſſeſſion of the Secretary, evince  
that theſe fabrics have attained a very conſiderable degree of  
perfection. Their quality certainly ſurpaſſes any thing, that  
could have been looked for, in ſo ſhort a time, and under  
ſo great diſadvantages ; and confpires with the ſcantineſs of  
the means, which have been at the command of the di-  
rextors, to form the eulogium of that public ſpirit, per-  
  
ſeverance, and judgment, which have been able to accom-  
pliſh ſo much.  
  
To cheriſh and bring to maturity this precious embryo

F ſupply of wool, of good quality, v ould probably afford the

The materials for making glaſs are found every where.  
In the United States there is no deficiency of them. The  
ſands and ſtones called Tarſo, which include flinty and  
ehryſtalline ſubſtances generally, and the ſalts of various  
plants, particularly of the ſea-weed, kali or kelp, conſtitute  
the eſſential ingredients. An extraordinary abundance of  
fuel is a particular advantage enjoyed by this country for  
fuch manufactures. They, however, require large capi-  
tals and involve much manual labour.  
  
Different manufactories of glaſs are now on foot in the  
United States. The preſent duty of 125 per cent. on all  
imported articles of glaſs amount to a conſiderable eneou-

HE fecretary of the treafury, in obedience to the order of the houfe of repre-  
fentatives, of the rsth day of January, 1790, has applied his attention, at as  
early a period as his other duties would permit, to the fubject of Manufactures ; and  
particularly to the means of promoting tuch as will t nd to render the unrted {lates  
independent on foreign nations, for milicary and other effential fupplies: and he  
thereupon ref{pedifuliy fubmits the following  
R E P oO R Ti  
THE expediency of encouraging manufactures in the united ftates, which was  
not long fince deemed very queltionable, appears at this time to be pretty generally  
admitted. The embarrafiments which have obftructed the progtefs of our external  
trade, have led to ferious reflections on the neceflity of enlarging the {phere of our  
domettic commerce ; the reltrictive re gulations, which, in foreign markets, abridge  
the vent of the increafing furplus of our agricultural produce, ferve to beget an ear-  
neft defire, that a more extenfive demand for that furplus may be created at home:  
And the complete fuccefs which has rewarded manufacturing enterprife, in fome va-  
Juable branches, confpiring with the promifing fymptoms which attend fome lefs ma-  
  
ture efiays in others, juftify a hope, that the obftacles to che growth of this {pecies of  
induftry are lefs furmidable than they were apprehended to be; and that it is not  
difficult to find, in its further extenfion,a full indemnification for any external difad-  
vantages, which are or may be experienced, as well as an acceflion of refources, favor-  
able to national independence and fafety.  
  
There ttill are, neverthelels, refpeable patrons of opinions, unfriendly to the en-  
couragement of manufactures.— The following are, fubftantially, the arguments by  
which thefe opinions are defended :  
  
** In every country (fay thole who entertain them) agriculture is the moft benefi-  
cial and productive obje&amp; of human indufiry. ‘This pofition, generally, if not uni-  
verflally true, applies with peculiar emphafisto the united ftates, on account of their  
immenfe tracts of fertile territory, uninhabited and unimproved. Nothing can afford  
fo advantageous an employment for capital and labour, as the converfion of this ex-  
tenfive wilderneis into cultivated farms. Nothing equally with this, can contribute  
to the population, ftrength, and rea} riches of the country  
  
“ To endeavour, by the extraordinary patronage of government, to accelerate the  
growth of manufadiures, is, in fa@, co endeavour, by force and art, to transfer the na-  
tural current of induftry, from a more to a lefs beneficial channel. Whatever has  
fugh a tendency muft neceflarily be unwife: Indeed it can hardiy ever be wile in  
a Zovernment, to attempt to give a direction to the induftry of its citizens. This  
under the quick-fighted guidance of private interett, will, of left to itfelf, infallibly  
find its own way to the moft profitable employment ; and it is by fuch employment,  
that the public profperity will be moft effectually promoted. ‘To leave induitry to  
itfelf, therefore, is, in almott every cafe, the foundeft as well as the fimplef policy.  
  
“ This policy is not only recommended to the united {tates, by confiderations which  
affect all nations; it is, in a manner, dictated to them by the imperious force of a very  
peculiar ficuation. The {mallnefs of their population, compared with their territory,  
the conftant allurements to emigration from the fettled to the unfettled parts of che  
country; the facility with which the lefs independent condition of an artiian can be  
exchanged for the more independent condition of a farmer ; thefe, and fimilar caufes  
confpire to produce, and for a length of time mutt continue to occafion, a fcarcity of  
hands for manufaQuring occupation, and dearnels of labour generally. To thefe dif-  
advantages for the profecution of manufactures, a deficiency of pecuniary capital being  
added, the profpe&amp; of a fuccefsful competition with the manufacturers of Burope,  
muft be regarded as little lefs than defperate. Extenfive manufactures can only be  
the offspring of a redundant, at leatt of a fullpopuiation. Till the latter fall chasac-  
  
terife the fituation of this cyuntry, &quot;tis vai to bupe for the former,

34 Political Regifter.  
  
“ If, contrary to the natural courfe of things, an unfeafonable and premature {pring  
ean be given to certain fabrics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, bounties, or by other  
forced expedients; this will only be to facrifice the interefts of the community to  
thofe of particular clailes. Befides the mifdirection of labour, a virtual monopoly will  
be given to the perfons employed on fuch fabrics; and an enhancement of price, the  
inevitable confequence of every monopoly, muft be defrayed at the expence of the  
other parts of the fociety. It is far preferable, that thofe perfons fhould be engaged  
in the cultivation of the earth, and that we thould procure, in exchange for its pro-  
dudions, the commodities with which foreigners are able to fupply us in greater per-  
feGion, and upon better terms.”  
  
Lhis mode of reafoning 1s founded upon facts and principles, which have certainly  
refpeGable pretenfions. If it had governed the conduct of nations, more generally  
than it has done, there is room to fuppofe, that it might have carried them fatter to  
profperity and greatnefs, than they have attained by the purfuit of maxims too wide-  
ly oppofite. Molt general theories, however, admit of numerous exceptions, and  
there are few, if any, of the political kind, which do not blend a confiderable portion  
of error with the truths they inculeate.  
  
In order to an accurate judgment how far that which has juft been ftated ought to be  
deemed liable to a fimilar imputation, it is neceflary to advert carefully to the confid-  
erations which plead in favour of manufactures, and which appear to reccommend the  
fpecial and pofitive encouragement of them, im certain cafes, and under certain reafon-  
able limitations.  
  
It ought readily to be conceded, that the cultivation of the earth, as the primary  
and mott certain fource of national fupply ; as the immediate and chief fource of fub-  
fittence to man; asthe principal fource of thofe materials which conftitute the nu-  
triment ef other kinds of labour; as including a ftate moft favourable to the freedom  
and independence of the human mind; one, perhaps, moft conducive to the multi-  
plication of the human {pecies ; has intrinfically @ flrong claim te pre-eminence over every  
other hind of indujtry. »  
  
But, that it has atitle to any thing like an exclufive prediledtion, in any country,  
ought to be admitted with great caution. ‘That it iseven more produ@ive than eve-  
ry other branch of induftry, requires more evidence than has yet been given in fup-  
port of the pofition, ‘hat its real interefts, precious and important as, without the  
help of exaggeration, they truly are, will be advanced, rather than injured, by the  
Gue encouragement of manufacures, may, it is believed, &gt; fatisfactorily demontftrat-  
ed. And it is alfo believed, that the expediency of fuch encouragement, in a gencral  
view, may be fhewn to be recommended by the moft cogent and perfuafive motives of  
national policy.  
  
It has been maintained, that agriculture is, net only the moft produétive, but the  
only productive fpecies of induftry. ‘The reality of this fuggeftion, in either refpect,  
has, however, not been verified by any accurate detail of fas and calculations; and  
the goneral arguments, which are adduced to prove it, are rather fubtil and paradoxi-  
cal, than folid or convincing.  
  
Thofe which maintain its exclufive productivenefs are to this effe&amp; :—  
  
Labour, beftowed upon the cultivation of land, produces enough, not only te replace  
all the neceflary expences incurred in the bufinefs, and to maintain the ptrfons who  
are employed in it, but to afford, tegether with the erdinary profit on the ftock or capi-  
tal of the farmer, a nett furplus or rent for the landlord or proprictor of the foil. But  
the labour of artificers does nothing more than replace the flock which employs them  
(or which furnifhés materials, tools and wages) and yield the ordinary profit upon that  
ftock. It yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land. Neither does4t add any thing  
to the éotal value of the whole annual produce of the land and Jabeur of the country.  
The additional value given to thofe parts of the produce of land, which are wreught  
into manufadures, is counter-balanced by the value of thofe other parts of that pro-  
duce, which are confumed by the manufacturers. It can therefore only be by faving  
or parfimeny, not by the politive productivene/s of their labour, that the claffes of artifi-  
cers can in any-degree augment the revenue of the fociety.  
  
To this it has been anfwered,

enue of the fucicty, or to the aggregate value of the annual produce of its land and  
labour. If the confumption for any given period amounted to a given /um, and the  
inereafed value of the produce manufactured, in the fame period, to a dite jum, the total  
amount of the confumption and production during that period, would be equal to the  
two fums, and confequently double the value of the agricultural produce cenfumed.  
And though the increment of value produced by the clafles of artificers fhould at no  
time exceed the value of the produce of the land confumed by them, yet there would  
be at every moment, in confequence of their labour, a greater value of goods in the mar-  
ket than would exift independent of it.  
  
2. “ That the pofition, that artificers can augment the revenue of a fociety, only  
by parfimony, is true in no cther fenfe, than in one which is equally applicable to huf-  
bandmen or cultivators. It may be alike affirmed of all thefe claffes, that the fund  
acquired by their labour, and deftined for their fupport, is not, in an ordinaryjway,  
more than equal to it Aad hence it will follow, that augmentations of the wealth  
or capital of the community (except in the inftan ses of fome extraordinary dexterity  
or fkill) can only proceed, with refpec&amp;t to any of them, from the favings of the more  
thrifty and parfimonious.  
  
3. ** That the anaual produce of the land and labour of a country can only be in-  
creafed in two ways by fome improvement in the produGive powers of the ufeful  
labour, which actually exifts within it, or by fome increafe in the quantity of fuch |a-  
bour: that with regard to the firft, the labour of artificers being ca; able of greater fub-  
divifion and fimplicity of operation, than that of cultivators, it is fufceptible in a pro-  
portionably greater degree, of improvement in its predu@ive powers, whether to be  
derived from an acceflion of fkill, or from the application of ingenious machinery ;  
  
in which particular, therefore, the labour employed in the culture of land can pretend  
to mo advantage over that engaged in manufactures: that, with regard te an aug-  
  
-  
  
mentation of the quantity of ufeful labour, this, excluding adventitious cireumitances,  
/  
  
muft depend effentially upon an increafe of capita!, which again muft depend  
the favings made out of the revenues of shade. ‘whe furnith or man ge that wi  
at any time employed, whether in agriculture, or in manufactures, or im apy ot  
way.”  
  
But while the exclufve productivenefs of agricu tural labour has been thusdenied and  
refuted, the fuperiority of its productivenets has been conceded without hefitation.  
  
As this conceflion involves a point of confiderable magnitude, in relation to maxims  
of public adminiftration, the grounds on which it retts are worthy ofa diitin@ and  
particular examination.  
  
One of the arguments made ufe of, in  
quaint and fuperficial: It amounts to this Chat in the productions ef the foil, na-  
ture co-operates with man; and that the effect of their joint labonr muf be greater  
than that of the labour of man alene.  
  
This, however, is far from being a neceflary inference. It is very conceivable, that  
the labour of man alone laid out upon a work, requiring great fkull and art to bring it  
to perfection, may be more prove ctive, in value, than the labour of nature and man  
combined, when directed towards more fimple operations and objects: And when it  
is recallected to what an extent the agency of nature, in the application of the mecha-  
nical powers, is made auxiliary to the profecution of manufactures, the fuggcition  
which has been noticed, lofes even the appearance of plaufibility.  
  
It might alfo Me obferved, with a contrary view, than the labour employed in agri-  
  
fupport of the idea, may be prongunced both  
  
culture is in a great meafure periodical and occafional, depending on feafons, liable to  
various and long intermiffions ; avbile that occupied in many manufactures is coaftant  
and regular, extending through the year, embracing, in fome initances, night as well  
as day.  
  
It is alfo probable, that there are among  
remiffnefs than among artificers. The farmer, frem the peculiar fertility of his land,  
or fome other favourabl e circumftaace, may frequently obtain a livelihood, even with  
aconfiderable degree of careleffnefs in th e of tivation ; bet the artifan can  
  
with difficulty effect the fame object, without exerting himfelf p

U, in place of both thefe fuppofitions, there were fuppofed to he two farmers and n® bl  
artificer, each of whom applied a part of his labour to the culture of land, and another ry  
part to the fabrication of manufadtures; in this cafe, the portion of the labour of  
both beftowed upon land would produce the fame quantity of provifions and raw ma- v;  
terials only, as would be produced by the entire fum of the labour of one applied in in  
the fame manner; and the portion of the labour of both beftowed upon manufactures, ai  
would produce the fame quantity of manufactures only, as would be produced by the ic  
entire fum of the labour of one applied m the fame manner. Hence the produce of the  
Jabour of the two farmers would not be greater than the produce of the labour of the ti  
farmer and artificer; and hence it refults, that the labour of the artificer is as pofitive- ¢  
ly productive as that of the farmer, and, as pofitively, augments the revent ; of the fo- c  
ciety. tt  
  
The labour of the artificer replaces to the farmer that portion of his labour with e  
which he provides the materials of exchange with the artificer, and which he would t  
etherwife have heen compelled to apply to manufa@ures; and while the artificer n  
thus enablesthe farmer to enlarge his ftock of agricultural induftry, a portion of which  
he purchafes for his own ufe, be al/o Supplies bitnfelf with the manufa&amp;ured articles of which h  
be fands in need. He does till more—Befides this equivalent which he gives for the , d  
portion of agricultural labour confumed by him, and this fupply of manufactured r  
commodities for his own confumption, he furnifhes ftill a farplus, which compenfates e ‘  
for the wfe of the capital advanced, either by himfelf or fume other perfon, for carry- i  
img on the bufinefs. ‘This is the ordinary profit of the ftock employed in the manu- t  
factory,and is,in every fenfe, as cflective an addition to the income of the fociety as t  
the rent of jand.  
  
The produce of the labour ef the artificer, confequently, may be regarded as com- ’  
pefed of three parts ; one by whith the provifions for his fubfittence and the materials }  
for his work are purchafed of the farmer, one by which he fupplies himfelf with mas &#x27;  
nafactured necefiaries, and a third which conftitutes the profit on the ftock employ- ’  
ed. The two Jatt portions feem to have been overlooked in the fyflem, which re-  
prefents manufaQuring indufiry as barren and unpredudtive. &#x27;  
  
in the courfe of the preceding illuftrations, the products of equal quantities of the |  
labour of the farmer and artificer have been treated as if equal to each ether—But 1  
this is not to be underiteod as intending to affert any fuch precife equality. It is mere-  
  
ther the value of the produce of the labour of the farmer be fomewhat more or lefs,  
than that of the artificer, is not material to the main feope of the argument, which  
hitherto has only aimed at thewing,

ba VI. As to the affording a more ampli and various field for enterprife.  
  
This alfo is of greater confequence in the general {cale of national exertion, than  
  
might perhaps on a fuperficial view be fuppofed, and has effects not altogether dilli-  
  
mijar from thofe of the eircumiftance lait noticed. To cherifh and ftimulate the ac-  
  
  
  
tivity of the human mind, by multiplying the objects of enterprife, is not among the &#x27;  
  
leatt confiderable of the éxpedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be promot- L  
  
ed. Even things, in themfeives, not pofitively advantageous, fometimes becomes fo,  
  
by their tendency to provoke exertion. Every new icene which is opened to the buly j  
  
nature of man to roule and exert itfelf, is the addition of a new energy to the general  
  
ftock of effort.  
vy The fpirit of enterprife, ufeful and prelific as it is, muft neceffarily be contracted or  
&quot; expanded in proportion to the fimplicity or variety of the occupations and productions,  
  
* which are to be found in afociety. It muft be lefs in a nation of mere cultivators,  
  
than in a nation of cultivaters and merchants; lefs in a nation of cultivators and  
  
merchants, than in a nation of cultivators, artificers, and merchants.  
  
VIL. As to the creating, in fome infla nces, anew, and fecur ing in all, a more certain and fleaty  
  
demand, for the furplus produce of the foil.  
  
his is among the mot important of the circumftances which have been indicated.  
It is a principa! mean, by which the eflabliihment of manufactures contributes to an  
augmentation of the produce or revenue of a country, and has an immediate and di-  
rect relation to the profperity of agriculture  
  
It is evident, that the exertions of the hufbandman will be fteady or fluctuating,  
vigorous or leebic, im.prepertion to the fteadinefs or uctuation, adequatenefs or ina-  
dequatencis, of the markets on which he mutt depend, for the vent of the furpius  
which may be produced by his labour; and that fuch furplus, in the ordinary courfe of  
things, will be greater or lefs in the fame proportion  
  
Fer the purpoic of this vent, a domettic market is greatly to be preferred te a fo-  
reign one; becaufe it is in the nature of things, far more to be relied upon.  
  
It is a primary obje&amp; of the policy of nations, to be able to fupply themfelves  
with fubfiitence from their own foils; and manufacturing nations, as far as circum-  
ftances permit, endeavour to procure from the fame fource, the raw materials necefla- &#x27;  
ry for their own fabrics. ‘This difpolition, urged by the {pirit of monopoly, is fome-  
times even carried to an injudicious extreme. It feems not always to be recolleted,  
that nations, who have neither mines nor manufactures, can only obtain the manufac-  
tured articles of which they ftand in need, by an exchange of the products ef their  
foils ; artd that, if thofe who can beft furnifh them with fuch articles are unwilling to  
give a duc courfe to this exchange, they mutt of neceflity make every poflible effort to  
manufacture for themfelves; the effect of which is, tHat the manufacturing nations a-  
bridge the natural advantages of their fituation, through an unwillingnefs to permit  
the agricultural countries to enjoy the advantages of theirs; and facrifice the interefts  
of a mutually beneficial intercourfe to the vain project of /clling every abing, and buying  
every thing  
  
But it is alfo a confequence of the policy which has been noted, that the foreign  
demand for the products of agricultural countries, is, in a great degree, rather cafual .  
and occafional, than certain orconftant. To what extent injurious interruptions of \
the demand for fome of the ftaple commodities of the united ftates, may have been  
caperienced, from that caufe, mult be referred to the judgment of thofe who are en-  
gaged in carrying on the commerce of the country; but it may be fafely affirmed,  
that fuch interruptions are at times very inconveniently felt, and that cafes not  
unfrequently occur, in which markets are foconfined and reftricted, as to render the  
demand very unequal to the fupply. :  
  
Independently likewife of the artificial impediments which are created by the policy  
in queftion, there are natural caufes tending to render the external demand for the  
furplus of agricultural nations a precarious reliance. The differences of feafons, in  
the countries which are the confumers, make immenfe differences in the produce of  
their own foils, in different years ; and confequently in the degrees of their necefli-  
ty for foreign fupply. Plentiful harvefts with them, efpecially if fimilar ones occur

at the fame time in the countries which are the furnithers, oceafion of courfe a glat in  
the markets of the latter.  
  
Confidering how faft and how much the progrefs of new fettlements in the united  
Rates mult encreafe the furplus produce of the foil, and weighing ferioufly the tenden-  
cy of the fyftem which prevails among moft of the commercial nations of Europe ;  
whatever dependence may be placed on the force of natura) circumftances to counter-  
act the effects of an artificial policy, there appear ftrong reafons to regard the foreign  
demand for that furplus astoo uncertain a reliance, and to defire a fubititute for it,  
in an extenfive domettic market.  
  
To fecure fuch a market, there is no other expedient, than to promote manufadtur-  
ing eftablifhments. Manufacturers, who conftitute the moft numerous clafs, after the  
cultivators of land, are, for that reafon, the principal confumers of the furplus of  
their labour.  
  
This idea of anextenfive domeflic market for the furplus produce of the foil is of the  
firft confequence. !t is, of all things, that which moft effectually conduces to a flou-  
rithing ftate of agriculture. If the effect of manufaGories fhould be, to detach a por-  
tien of the hands which would otherwife be engaged in tillage, it might poffibly caufe  
a fmaller quantity of lands to be under cultivation; but by their tendency to pro-  
eure a more certain demand for the furplus produce of the foil, they would, at the

Political Regifter. 43  
  
the united ftates, from the zealous purfuit of manufactures would doubtlefs have  
great force. It will not be affirmed, that they might not be permitted, with few ex~  
ceptions, to ferve as a rule of national conduct. In fuch a ftate of things, each  
country would have the full benefit of its peculiar advantages to compeniate tor its  
deficiencies or difadvantages. If one nation were in condition to fupply manufactur-  
ed articles on better terms than another, that other might find an abundant indem-  
nification in a fuperior capacity to furnifh the produce of the foil. And a free ex-  
change, mutually beneficial, of the commodities which cach was able to fupply, on  
the beft terms, might be carried on between them, fupporting in full vigour the in-  
duftry of each. And though the circumftanceés which have been mentioned, and o-  
thers which will be unfolded hereafter, render it probable, that nations merely agri-  
cultural, would not enjoy the fame degree of opulence, in proportion to their num-  
bers, as thofe which united manufactures with agriculture; yet the progreflive im-  
provement of the landsof the former, might, in the end, atone for an inferior de-  
gree of opulence, in the mean time ; and in a cafe in which oppolite confiderations  
are pretty equally balanced, the option ought perhaps always tu be in favour of leav-  
ing induftry to its own direction.  
  
But the fyftem which has been mentioned is far from characterifing the general  
policy of nations. The prevalent one has been regulated by an oppofite fpirit.  
The confequence of it is, that the united {lates are, to a certain extent, in the fitua~-  
tion of a couatry precluded from foreign commerce. They can indeed, without  
difficulty, obtain from abroad, the manufactured fupplies of which they are in  
want ; but they experience numerous and very injurious impediments to the emif-  
fion and vent of their own commodities. Nor is thisthe cafe in reference to a fingle  
foreign nation only. The regulations of feveral countries, with which we have the  
moft extenfive intercourfe, throw fcrious obftructions in the way of the principal  
ftaples of the united ftates.  
  
In fuch a pofition of things, the united ftates cannot exchange with Europe on  
equalterms; and the want of reciprocity would render them the victim of a fyftem,  
which would induce them to confine their views to agriculture, and refrain from ma-  
nufactures. &lt;A conftant and encreafing neceflity, on their part, for the commodities  
of Europe, and only a partial and occafional demand for their own, in return, could  
not but expofe them to a ftate of impoverifhment, compared with the opulence to  
which their political and natural advantages authorife them to afpire.  
  
Remarks of this kind are not made in the {pirit of complaint. *Tis for the nations,  
whofe regulations are alluded to,to judge for themfelves, whether by aiming at tco  
much they do not lofe more than they gain. *Tis for the united ftates to contider by  
what means they can render themfelves leaft dependent on the combinations, right  
or wrong, of foreign policy.  
  
It is no fmall confolation, that already the meafures which have embarrafled our  
trade, have accelerated internal improvements, which upon the whole have bettered  
our affairs. To diverfify and extend thefe improvements, is the fureft aad faf-  
eft method of indemnifying ourfelves for any inconveniencies, which thofe or fimilar  
meafures have a tendency to beget. If Europe will not take from us the preduds of  
our foil, upon terms confiftent with our intereft, the natural remedy is to contrad,  
as faft as pollible, our wants of her.  
  
a. The converfion of their wafte into cultivated lands is certainly a point of great  
moment inthe political calculations of the united flates. Sut the degree in which  
this may poflibly be retarded by the encouragement of manufactorics, docs not appear  
to countervail the pewerful inducements to affording that encouragement.  
  
An obfervation made in another place is of a nature to have great influence upon  
this queftion—lIf it cannot be denied, that the interelts even of agriculture may be  
advanced more by having fuch of the lands of a flate as are occupied under good  
cultivation, than by having a greater quantity occupied under much inferior cultiva-  
tion, and if manufactories, for the reafons afligned,muft be admitted te have a tenden-  
cy to promote a more ftcady and vigorous cultivation of the lands occupied, than  
would happen without them, it will follow that they are capable of indemnifying a  
country for a diminution of the progrefs of new fettlements ; and may ferve to en-  
creale both the capital value, and the income of ite lands, even though they Mould  
abridge the number of acres under tillage,  
  
  
  
  
  
_-  
  
  
  
44 Political Regifter.  
  
But it does hy no means follow, that the progrefs of new fettlements would be  
retarded by the extenfion of manufactures. ‘The defire of being an independent pro-  
prictor of land is founded on fuch ftrong principles in the human breaft, that where  
the opportunity of becoming fo is as great as it is in the united ftates, the proportion  
will be fmall of thofe, whofe fituation would otherwife lead to it, who would be  
diverted from it, towards manufaQures. And it is highly probable, as already inti-  
mated, that the acceflions of foreigners, who originally drawn over with manufac-  
uring views, would afterwards abandon them for agricultural, would be more than  
an equivalent for thofe of our own citizens, who might happen to be detached from  
them.  
  
The remaining abjefions to a particular encouragement of manufaGures in the  
united ftates now require to Le examined  
  
One of thefe turns on the propofition, that induftry, if left to itfelf, will naturally  
find its way to the moft ufeful and profitable employment ; whence it is inferred, that  
manufaGures, without the aid of government, will grow up as foon, and as faft, as  
the natural ftate of things and the intereft of the community may require.  
  
Againg the folidity of this hypothefis, in the full latitude of the terms, very ce-  
gent reafens may be offered. Thefe have relation to the ftrong mfluence of habit and  
the fpirit of imitation, the fear of want of fuccefs in untried enterprifes, the intrinfic  
difficu!tics incident to firft clays towards a competition with thofe who have previ-  
oufly attained to perfection in the bufinefs to be attempted, the bounties, premiums,  
and other artificial encouragements, with which foreign nations fecond the exertions  
of their own citizens, in the branches in which they are to be rivalled.  
  
Experience teaches, that men are often fo much governed by what they are accufs  
tomed to fee and practice, that the fimpleft and moft obvious improvements, in the  
molt ordinary occwpations,are adopted with helitation, relu@tance, and by ilow grada-  
tions. The fpoutancoustranfition to new purfuits, ina community long habituated to  
different ones, may be expected to be attended with proportionably greater diflicul-  
ty. When former occupations ceafed to yield a profit adequate to the fubfiftence of  
their followers, or where there was an abfolute deficiency of emp&#x27;oyment in them,  
wwing to the fuperabundance of hands, changes would enfue ; but thefe changes would  
he likely to be more tardy than might confit with the intereft cither of individuals  
or of the fociety. In many cafes, they would not happen, while a bare fupport could  
be enfured by an adherence to ancient courfes; though a refort to a mere profitable  
eniployment might be practicable. To produce the defirable changes asearly as may  
be expedient, may therefore require the incitement and patronage of government.  
  
The apprehenfion of failing in new attempts, is perhaps a more ferious impediment.  
There are difpofitions apt to be attracted by the mere novelty of an undertaking ; but  
thefe are not always thofe beft calculated to give it fucceis. ‘Lo this, it is of imper-  
tance that the confidence of cautious, /agacious capitaliits, both citizensand foreigners,  
fhould be excited. And to infpire this defcription of perfons with confidence, it is elf-  
fential, that they fhould be made to fee in any proje&amp;, which is new, and for that rea-  
fon a&#x27;one,if for no other, precarious, the profpect of fuch a degree of countenance  
and fupport from government, as may be capable of overcoming the obitacles infe-  
parable from firft experiments.  
  
The fuperiority antecedently enjoined by nations, who have pre-occupied and per-  
fected a branch of induftry, conititutes a more formidable obttacie, tham either of  
thofe which have bees mentioned, to the introduction of the fame branch intoa  
country, in which it did not before exift. ‘To maintain between the recent eftablith-  
ments of one country and the long matured eltabiiliments of another country, a coms  
petition upon equal terms, both as to quality and price, isin moft cafes impractica-  
be. The difparity, inthe one, or in the other, or in both, mult neceMarily be fo con-  
fiderable as to forbid a fuccefstul rivalihip, without the extraordinary aid and protec-  
tion of government.  
  
But the greateft obftacle of all to the fuccefsful profecution of a new branch of in-  
dultry, in a country in which it was before unknown, confifts, as far as the inances  
apply, in the bounties, p.emiuims, and other aids, which are granted, in a variety of ca~  
fes, by the nations in which the eftablifhments to be imitated are previeully intredu-  
ccd, Ic is well known (and particular examp!es in the courfe of this report will be  
cited) that certain nations grant bounties on the exportation of particular commodi-  
ties, to cnable their own workmen to underfell and fupplant all competitors, in th

countries to which thofe commedities are fent. Hence the undertakers of a new manu-  
facture have to contend not only withthe natural difadvantages ofa new undertaking,  
but with the gratuities and remunerations which other governments beitow. Tobe  
enabled to contend with fuccefs, it is evident, that the interference and aid of their  
own government are indilpentable  
  
Combinations by thofe engaged in a particular branch ef bufinefs in one country, te  
fruftrate the firft efforts to introduce it into another, by temporary facrifices, recem-  
penfed perhaps by extraordinary indemnifications of the government of fuch country,  
are believed to have exifted, and are not to be regarded as deftitute of pro ability.  
The exiftence or affurance of aid, from the government of the country in which the  
bufinefs isto be introduced, may bé¢ eflential to fortify adventurers againft the dread of  
fuch combinationg—to defeat their effects, if formed, and to prevent their being  
formed, by demonttrating that they mult in the end prove fruitlefs.  
  
Whatever room there may be for an expectation that the induftry of a people, un-  
der the direction of private intereft, will upon equal terms find out the moit beneficial  
employment for itfelf, there is none for a reliance, that it will ftruggle againit the  
force of unequal terms, or will of itfelffurmount all the adventitious barriers to a fuc-  
cefsful competition, which may have been ere by the advantages naturally  
acquired from practice, and previous poileilion of the ground, or by thofe which may  
have fprung from pofitive regulations aod au irtificial policy. This general refleXion  
might alene fuffice as an anfwer to the objection under examination ; exclufively of  
the weighty confiderations which have been particularly urged.  
  
The objections to the purfait of manufa@ures in the united ftates, which next pre-  
fent themfelves to difcuflion, reprefent an impracticability of fuccefs, arifing from  
three caufes—{carcity of hands, deat sof labour, want of « ipital.  
  
The two firft circumiftances are to a tain extent real, and, within due limits,  
ought to he admitted as obitacles to the fuccefs of manufacturing enterprife in the  
united ftates. Butthere are various confiderations, which leflen their force, and  
tend to afford an aflurance that they are net fufficient to prevent the advantageous  
  
‘ted eit!  
  
_  
  
profecution of many very ufefuland extenfive manufactories.  
  
With reyvard to fcarcity of hands, the fact itfelf mult be applied with no {mall qua-  
lification to certain parts cf the united ftates. There are large diftrids, which may  
be confidered as pretty fully peopled ; and which, notwithftanding a continual drain  
  
’  
  
  
  
for diitant fettlement, are thickly interfperfed with flourifhing and encreafing towns  
Ii thefe diftrits have not already reached the point, at which the complaint ef f{cares-  
ty of hands ceafes, they are not remote from it, and are approaching faft towards it  
And having perhaps, fewer attractions to agriculture, than fome r parts of the  
union, they exhibit a proportionably ftronger tendency towards other ki of induf  
try. Inthefe diftriéts, may be difcerned, no inconfilerable maturity for manufac-  
turing eftablifhments.  
  
But there are circumftances, which have been already noticed with another view,  
that materially diminifh every where. tl ftect of {carcity of hands Thefe cir  
cumftances are—the great uie which may be ma fy n and children ; on which  
point a very pregnant and initructive fact has beer ntioned; the valt cxtenlion  
given by late improvements, to the employment of hines, which, fubfituting the  
agency of fire and water, has prodigicuily leflene neceility for manual! ljabour ;  
the employment of perfons ordinarily engaged in other occupations, during the fea-  
fons, or hours of leifure ; which, belides giving occalion to the exertion of a greater  
quantity of labour by the fame number of | 3, and tl ”y encrealing the general  
ftock of labour, as has been elfewhere remarked, : » be taken into t caicula-  
tion, as a refource for obviating the fearcity of ha: uilly, the attraction of fu-  
reign emigrants. Whoever infpects, with a care! the « polition of eurtowns,  
will be made fenfible to what an extent this refource may be relied upon. This ex-  
  
hibits a large proportion of ingenious and valuable workmen, in diflerent arts and  
  
trades, who, by expatriating from Europe, have improved their own condition, and  
  
added to the induflry and wealth of the wnited ftates. It isa natural inference, from  
the experience we have already had, that as foon as the u 1 itates fhall prefent the  
countenance of a ferious profecution of manufactures, feon as forcign a s fhall  
be made fenfible that the flate of things here affords a moral certainty of employ-

who are capable of fupplying themfelves with a greater abundance, as well asa great-  
er variety of the requifite materials.  
  
Astothe fecond item, the expence of grounds, buildings, machinery, and tools, an  
equality at leaft may be affumed ; fince advantages in fomie particulars will couater-  
balance temporary difadvantayes in ethers.  
  
As tothe third item, or the article of wages, the comparifon certainly turns again  
the united ftates; though, as before obferved, not in fo greata degree as is common-  
ly fuppofed.  
  
The fourth item is alike applicable to the foreign and to the domeftic manufa@ure.  
  
It is indeed more properly a re/i/t than a particular, to be compared.  
  
But with refpect to all the remaining items, they are alone applicable to the foreign  
manufaciure, and in the itricteft fenfe extraordinaries ; conttitutung a tum of extra  
  
charge on the foreiyn fabric, which cannot be eftimated at lefs than from I5§ to 30  
per cent. on the coft of it at the manufadory.  
  
This fum of extra charge may confidently be regarded as more than a counterpoife  
for the real difference in the price of labour; and is a fatisfactory pruof that manu-  
factures may profper in defiance of it in the united ftates  
  
To the general allegation, connected withthe circumftances of fearcity of hands  
and dearnefs of labour, that extenfive manufactures can only grow out of a redundant  
or full population, it will be fufficient, to anfwer generally, that the fact has been o-  
therwife. That the fituation alledged to be an eflential condition of fuccefs, has*not  
been that of feveral nations, at periods when they had already attained to maturity  
in a variety of manufactures.  
  
The fuppofed want of capital for the p: ution of manufactures in the unite  
ftates, is the moft indefinite of the objections which are ufually oppofed to it.  
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing precile concerning the real extent of the  
  
monicd capital of a country, and ftill more concerning the proportion which it bears  
tothe objects that invite the employment of capital. It is not lefs difficult to pronounce  
how far the effec of any given quantity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a  
medium for circulatiag the induitry and property of a nation, may be encreafed by  
the very circumftance of the additional motion, which is givento it by new objects  
ofemployment. That effed, like the momentum of defcending bodies,jmay not im-  
properly be reprefented, as in a compound ratio to ma/i and welecity. It feems pretty  
certain, thata given fum of money, in a fituation in which the quick impullfes of  
commercial activity were little felt, would appear inadequate to the circulation of as  
great a quantity of induftry and property, as in one in which their full influence was  
experienced,  
  
It is not obvious, why the fame objection might not as well be made to external  
  
1  
  
commerce as to manufactures; fince it is manifeit that our immenife tra¢ts of land,  
occupied and unoccupied, are capable of giving employment to more capital than is  
actually beftowed upon them. It is certain, that the united {tates offer a vaft field for

internal improvements have been animated by it. Ut has already,  
in a few inftances, extended even to our manufacture  
  
It isa well known fact, that there are parts of Europe, which have more capital  
than profitable domeftic objects of employment. Hence, among other proofs, the  
large Joans continually furnifhed to fereign flates And it juaily certain, that the  
capital of other parts may fiad more protitable employment in the united Rates, than

at home. And notwithftanding there are weighty inducements to prefer the em-  
ployment of capital at home, even at lefs profit, to an inveftment of it abroad, though  
with greater gain, yet thefe inducements are over-ruled, either by a deficiency of em-  
ployment, or by a very material difference in profit. Both thefe caufes operate to  
procuce atransfer of foreign capital to the united ftates. °Tis certain, that various  
obje sin this country hold out advantages, which are with difficulty to be equalled  
elicwhere ; and under the encreafingly favorable impreffions, which are entertained  
of our government, the attractions will become more and more ftrong. ‘Thefe im-  
prefiions will prove a rich mine of profperity to the country, if they are confirmed and  
tirengthened by the progrefs of our affairs. And to fecure this advantage, little more  
is neceflary, than to folter induftry, and cultivate order and tranquility, at home and  
abroad.  
  
it is not impoffible, that there may be perfons difpofed to look with a jealous eye on  
the introduction of foreign capital, as if it were an inflrument to deprive our own  
citizens of the profits of our own induftry : But perhaps there never could be a more  
unreafonable jealoufy. Inftead of being viewed asa rival, it ought to be confidered  
asa moft valuable auxiliary ; conducing to put in motion a greater quantity of pro-  
ductive labor, and a greater portion of ufeful enterprife, than could exift without it.  
it is at leaft evident, that in a country fituated like the united ftates, with an infinite  
fund of refources yet to be unfolded, every farthing of foreign capital, which is laid  
out in internal ameliorations, and in induitrious eftablifhments of a permanent na-  
ture, is a preciows acquifition.  
  
And whatever be the objets which originally attract foreign capital, when once  
introduced, it may be directed towards any purpofe of beneficial exertion which is  
defired. Andto detain it among us, there can be no expedient fo effetual, as to en-  
large the fphere within which it may be ufefully employed : though introduced  
merely with views to fpeculations in the funds, it may afterwards be rendered fub-  
fervient to the interefts of agriculture, commerce, and manufaures.  
  
But the atrraction of foreign capital, for the dire&amp; purpofe of manufactures, ought  
not to be deemed a chimerical expectation. There are already examples of it, as re-  
marked in another place: and the examples, if the difpofition be cultivated, can  
hardly fail to multiply. There are alfo inftances of another kind, which ferve to  
firengthen the expectation ; enterprifes for improving the public communications, by  
cutting canals, opening the obftructions in rivers, and erecting bridges, have receiv-  
ed very material aid from the fame fource.

advantages, which have been intimated in the courfe

Not only the wealth, but the independence and fecurity of a country, apppear

with a view to thoie great objects, ought to endeavour to poffefs within itfelf all the

Our diftance from Europe, the great fountain of manufactured fupply, fubje@s us,  
jn the exiiting itate of things, to inconvenience and lofs in two ways  
  
The bulkinefs of thofe commodities which are the chief productions of the foil,  
neceflarily impofes very heavy charges on their tran{portation to diftant markets.  
Thefe charges, in the cafes in which the nations to whom our produdts are fent,  
maintain a competition in the fupply of their own markets, principally fall upon us,  
  
and form material deductions from the primitive value of the articles furnithed.  
The charges on manufactured fupplics, brought from Lurc pe, are greatly enhanced  
by the fame circumiltance of diftance. Thefe charges, again, in whi h our own im-  
duftry mantains no competition, in our own markets, allio princi paily fall upoa us; and  
are an additional caute of extiaor inary deduGion from € prinitive value of our

There is at the prefent juncture a certain fermentation ofmind, a certain activity  
of {peculation and enterprife, which, if properly directed, may be made fubfervient  
to ufeful purpofes; but which if left entirely to itfelf, may be attended with pernici-  
ous effects.  
  
The difturbed ftate of Europe inclining its citizens to emigration, the requifite  
workmen will be more eafily acquired than at another time ; amd the effe&amp; of mul-  
tiplying the opportunities of employment to thofe who emigrate, may be an encreafe  
of the number and extent of valuable acquifitions to the population, arts, and induf-  
try, of the country.  
  
To find pleafure in the are me of other nations would be criminal; but to bene-  
fit ourfelves, by opening aff afylum to thofe who fuffer, in confequence of them, is as  
juftifiable as it is politic.  
  
A full view having now been taken of the inducements to the promotion of manu-  
factures in the united ftates, accompanied with an examination of the principal objec-  
tions which are commonly urged in oppo/ition, it is proper in the next place, to confi-  
der the means by which it may be effected, as introductory to a fpecification of the  
ebjects, which, in the prefent ftate of things, appear the moft fit to be encouraged,  
and of the particular meafures which it may be advifeable to adopt, in refpect to  
each.  
  
In order to a better judgment of the means proper to be reforted to by the united  
fates, it will be of ufe to advert to thofe which have been employed with fuccefs in  
other countries. The principal of thefe are—  
  
1. Proteding duties ; or duties on thofe foreign articles which are the rivals of the domeftie  
ones, intended to be encouraged.  
  
Duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the domelftic fabrics,  
fince by enhancing the charges on foreign articles, they enable the national manufac-  
turers to underfell all their fereign competitors. The propriety of this {pecies of en-  
couragement need not he dwelt upon; as it is not enly a clear refult from the nume-  
rous topics which have been fugyeltcd, but is fanctioned by the laws of the united  
fates, in a variety of inftances; it has the additional recommendation of being a re-  
fource of revenue. Indeed all the duties impofed on imported aticles, though with an  
exclufive view to revenue, have the effect in contemplation, and, except where they  
  
fall on raw materials, wear a beneficent afpect towards the manufactures of the  
  
country.  
  
Il. Probibitions of rival articles, ot duties equivalent to probibit ons.  
  
This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging national manufactures;  
but in general it isonly fit to be employed when a manufacture has made fuch a pro-  
grefs, and is in fo many hands as to enfure a due competition, and an adequate {vp-  
ply on reafonable terms. Of duties equivalent te prohibitions, these are examples  
in the laws of the united ftates; and there are other cafes to which the principle may  
be advantageoufly extended, but they are not numerous.  
  
Confidering a monopoly of the domeftic market to its own manufaQurers, as the  
reigning policy of manufacturing nations, a fimilar policy on the part of the united  
ftates, in every proper inftance, is dictated, it might almoft be faid, by the principles  
of diftributive juftice ; certainly by the duty of endeavouring to fecure to their own  
citizens a reciprocity of advantages.  
  
I. Probibitions of the exportation of the materials of manufa@ures.  
  
The defire of fecuring a cheap and plentiful fupply for the national workmen, and  
where the article is either peculiar to the country, or of peculiar quality there, the  
jealoufy of enabling foreign workmen to rival thole of the nation, with its own ma-  
terials, are the leading motives to this {pecies of regulation. It ouzht not to be af-  
firmed, that it is in no inftance proper ; but it is certainly one which ought to be a-  
dopted with great circumfpection, and only in very plain cafes. It is feen at once,  
that its immediate operation, is to abridge the demand and keep down the price of  
the produce of fome other branch of induftry, generally {peaking of agriculture, to  
the prejudice of thofe who carry it on; and though, ifit be really effential to the  
profperity of any very important national manufacture, it may happen that thofe who  
are injured in the firft inftance, may be eventually indemnified by the fuperior fteadi-  
nefs of an extenfive domeftic market depending on that profperity; yet, in a mat-  
ter in which there is fo much room for nice and difficult combinations, in which fuch

58 Political Regifter.  
  
oppofite confiderations combat each other, prudence feems to diate, that the expe-  
dient in queftion, ought to be indulged with a {paring hand.  
  
IV. Dassiats Poumties.  
  
This has been found one of the moft efficacious means of encouraging manufac.  
tures, and it is, in fome views, the belt. Though it has not yet been pra@ifed up-  
on by the government of the anited flates | (uulets the allowance on the exportation of  
dried and pickled fifh, and faited meat could be confidered as a bounty : ) and though  
it is lefs favoured by public epinion tham fome other modes, its advantages are  
thefe-  
  
1. Itisa — of encouragement more pofitive and direct than any other ; and,  
for that very reafon, has a more immediate tendency to ftimulate and uphold new  
enterprifes, saneuanine the chances of profit, and diminishing the ritks of lofs, in the  
7 ttempts.  
  
a avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of price, which is  
inci ident to fome other modes, or it produces it to a lefs degree ; either by making no  
addition to the charges on the rival foreign article, as im the cafe of protedling du-  
tics, er by m: aking a fmaller addition. ‘The firft hap pens when the fund for the boun-  
ty is derived from a different object (which may or may not encreafe the price of  
fome atiebs dich: according to the nature of that objeét:) the fecond, when the  
fund is derived from the fame ora fimilar objeé of foreign manufaGure. Oue per  
cent. dutyon the foreign article converted intoa bounty on the domeftic, will have  
an equal ‘cffe&amp; with a duty of two per cent. exclufive of fuch bounty 5 and the price  
ef the foreign commodity is liable to be raifed, in the one cafe, in the proportion of  
one percent; inthe other, in that of two per cent. Indeed the bounty, when  
drawn from another fource, is calculated to promote a reduction of price ; becaule  
  
without laying any new charge on the fereign article, it ferves to introduce a com-  
petition with it, and to encreate the total quaatiy of the article in the market.  
  
3. Bounties have not, like high protesting duties, a tendency to produce feareity.  
An encreafe of price is not always the immediate, though, where the progrefs of a  
domeftic manufadure does not counterad a rife, it is commonly the ultimate effect  
of an additional duty. Io

The united Rates already, in a great meafure, fupply themfelves with nails and  
{pikes. ‘They are able and ought certainly to do it entirely. The firft and mot )abo-  
rious operation, in this manufacture, is performed by water-mills; and of the perfons  
afterwards employed, a great proportion are boys, whofe early habits of induftry are of  
importance to the community, to the prefent fupport of their tamilies, and to their own  
future comfort. It is not lefs curious than true, that in certain partsof the country,  
the making of nails is an occafional family manufacture.  
  
The exped ency of en additional duty on thefe articles is indicated by an important  
fad. About 1,8co,ccolb. of them were imported into the united fates, in the  
courfe of a year, ending the soth Sept. 1790. A duty of two cents per pound would,  
it is prefumable, fpeedily put an end to fo confiderable an importation. And it isin  
every view proper that an end fhould be put to it.  
  
The manufacture of thefe articles, like that of fome others, fuffers from the care-  
lefinets and difhonelty of a part of thofe who carry it on. An infpedtion, in certain  
cafes, might tend to correct the evil. It will deferve confideration, whether a  
regulation of this fort cannot be applied, without inconvenience, to the exportation of  
the orticles,cither to foreign countries, or from one flate to another.

tron manufaGories, which are yet in their infancy, they may all be contemplated  
as objects not difficult to be acquired. &quot;  
  
&#x27;o enfure the end, it feems equally fafe and prudent to extend the duty ad valo-  
tem upon all manufactures of iron, or of which iron isthe article of chief value, to  
ten per cent.  
  
Fire arms and other military weapons may, it is conceived, be placed without in«  
convenience in the clais of articles rated at fifteen per cent. ‘There exift already  
manufactories of thefe articles, which only require the ftimulus of a certain demand  
to render them adequate to the fupply of the united fates.  
  
It would alfo be a material aid to manufactories of thisnature, as well as @ mean  
of public fecurity, if provifion fhould be made for an annual purchafe of military  
weapons, of home manufacture, to a certain determinate extent, in order to the for-  
mation of arfenals; and to replace from time to time, fuch as fhouid be withdrawn  
for ule, fo as alwaysto have in ftore the quantity of each kind, which fhould be deem-  
ed a competent fupply.  
  
But it may hereafter deferve legiflative confideration, whether manufadtories of  
all the neceflary weapons of war ought not to be eftablifhed, on account of governs  
mentitfelf. Such eftablifhments are agreeable to the ufual practice of nations, and  
that practice feems founded on fulficient reafon.  
  
There appears to be an improvidence, in leaving thefe effent  
  
5  
  
tional defence to the cafual fpeculations of individual  
  
ial  
  
inftruments of nae  
adveature; a relource which  
can lefs de relied upon in this cafe than in moit others ; the articles in queition, not  
being objects of ordinary and indifpenfible private confuaption or ufe. As a general  
rule, manufaQories on the immediate account of government are to he avoid ds  
but this feems to be one of the few exceptions, which that rule admits, depending  
on very [pecial reafons.  
  
Manutactures of fteel, generally, or of which fteel isthe article of chief valu¢,  
may with advantage be placed in the clafs of goods rated at feven and an half per  
cent. As manufactures of this kind have not yet made any cenfiderable progrefs, it  
is a reafon for not rating them as high as thofe of iron; but as this material is thé  
balis of them, and as their extenfion is not lefs pra@icable than important, it is des  
firable to promote it by a fomewhat higher duty thaa the prefent.  
  
A queftion arifes, how far it might be expedient to permit the importation of  
iron in pis and bars free from duty. It would certainly be favourable to magufac-  
turers of the article ; but the doubt is, whether it might not interfere with its pro»  
duction.  
  
Two circumftances, however, abate, if they do not remove apprehenfion, on this  
{core ; one is the confiderable encreafe of price, which has been already remarked,  
and which renders it probable that the free admiflion of foreign iron weuld not be  
incenfittent with an adequate profit to the proprietors of iron works; the other is,  
the augmentation of demand, which would be likely to attend the encreafe of manu-  
factures of the article, in confequence of the additional encouragements propofed to  
be given. But caution neverthele&#x27;s, in a matter of this kind, is moft advifealile.  
The meafures fugyefted ought perhaps rather to be contemplated, fubject to the lights  
of further experience, than immicdiatcly adopted.

The expediency of a bounty on all this [pecies of coal, of home productior, and of

worthy of particular examination. ‘The great importance of the article will amply  
juftify a reafonable expence in this way, if it thal appear to be neeeflary te, arid fhall

is purchased by foreigners and that which re  
mains in the hands of citizens. But the gene  
ral erte&amp; ijx each cafe, though in different degrees  
it to add to the a&amp;ive capital of the country.  
Hitherto th« reasoning has on a con  
cefiion of the position, tnat tfiere is a dtitrudboi  
of some other capital, to the extent of the annu  
ity appropriated to the payment cf the intetcf  
and the redemption of the principal of the debt ;  
hut In this, too rt&gt;uel\ has. L-een-cuneeded- -Tmh  
is at mod a temporary transfer of some other capi  
tal, to the amount of the annuity, from thof  
who pay to the creditor who receives 5 which hi  
again rertores to the circulation to resume the of  
sices of a capital. This he docs either immedi  
atcJy by employing the money in forac branch 0  
industry, or mediately by lending it to some othe  
person, who does so employ it, or by spending i  
on his own maintenance. In eitlrer supposition  
there is no deftru&amp;ion of capital : there is no  
thing more than a fufpenlion of its motion for ;  
time 5 that is, whiie it is palling from the hand  
of those who pay into the public coffers, am  
thence through the public creditor into fomi  
other channel of circulation. Whrn the payment  
of interest are periodical and quick, and made b;  
the inftrumentaiity of aanks, the diversion o  
fufpeniion of capital may almost be denominate&quot;  
momentary. Hence tie deduction on this ac  
count is far less, than it at firlt fight appears to be  
There is evidently, as far as regards the annu  
ity, no deftruftion nor transfer of any other ca  
pital, than that poition of the income of eacl  
individual, which gees to make up the annuiry  
The land which furnilhes the farmer with thi  
sum which he is to contribute remain&#x27;s the fame :  
and the like may be observed of other capitals  
Indeed as far as the tax, which is the object 0  
contribution (as frequently happens when it doc  
not opprels by its weight) may have been a mo  
tive to greater exertion in any occupation 5 it ma;  
even serve to encreafe the contributory capital  
This idea is not without importance in the gene­  
ral view of the fubjeft.  
It remains to lee, what further dedu6lior  
ought to be made from the capital which is crea­  
ted, by the exigence of the debt, on account 0;  
the coin, which is employed in its circulation.  
This is susceptible of much less precise calcula  
tion than the article wbich has been jufldifcufled,  
it is impofiiole to fay what proportion of coin i:  
receflary to carry on the alienations which an}  
species of property usually undergoes. The quan­  
tity indeed varies according to circumstances. Bui  
it may still without hesitation be pronounced,  
from the quickness of the rotation, or rather oJ  
the transitions, that the medium of circulatior  
always bears bur a Imall proportion to the amouni  
of the f.) operty circulated. And it is thence fa­  
tisfaftorily deducible, that the coin employed ir  
the negociation9 of the funds, and which serves tc  
give them activity, as capital, is incomparably  
less than the lum of the debt negotiated for th«  
purpose of business.  
It ought not, however, to be omitted, that the  
negociation of the funds becomes itfelf a diftind  
business j which employs, and by employing, di­  
verts a portion of the circulating coin from other  
pursuits. But making due allowance for this  
circumftaiKe, there is no reason to conclude, thai  
the effett of the diversion of coin in che whole  
operation bears aay conficerable proportion tc  
the amount of the capital to which it a6ti­  
•vity. The sum of the debt in circulation is con­  
tinually at the command of any ufeful entcrprifcj

Report on MancjactWes.  
(Continued,)  
THE continuance of bounties on ma­  
nufa&amp;ures long eftabhfhed, muftalmoft  
alwavs be of questionable policy : Be­  
cause a presumption would arise in  
every such cafe, that there were natu­  
ral and inherent impediments to fuc  
cess. But in new undertakings the)  
are as juftifiable, as they are ofrentime1  
necessary.  
There is a degree of prejudice againfl  
bounties from an appearance of giving  
away the public money, without an im  
mediate confideratioiij and from a fup­  
poiition, that they serve to enrich par  
ticular classes, at the expence of th&lt;  
community.  
But neither of thef: sources of dislike  
■will bear a serious examination. There  
is no purpose to which public inone)  
can be more beneficially applied, thar  
to the acquisition of a new and ulefu  
branch of iaduftry ; no confideratior  
wore valuable than a permanent, addi­  
tion to the general stock of produitivt  
labor.  
As to tbe second source of obje£liori  
it equally lies against other modes o  
encouragement which are admitted tc  
&#x27;be eligible. As ofren as a duty upon ;  
foreign article makes an addition to it:  
price, it causes an extra ex pence to the  
community, for the benefit of the do  
meftic manufacturer. A bounty doe:  
no more. But it is the intereftof tbe  
society in each cafe to submit to a tcm  
porary expence, which is more thai  
compensated, by an encreafe of indul  
try and wealth, by an augmentation o  
resources and independence ; and b\
the circumitance of eventual cheap  
ness, which has been noticed in ano  
titer pUci. —  
It wou}d deserve attent;on, however  
in the employment of this ipeciesofen  
courageroent in the United States, as;  
icafon for moderating the degree of ii  
in the instances in which it might bf  
deemed eligible, that the great diftanct  
of this country from Europe impofei  
very h;avy charges on all the fabric:  
which are brought from thence, a  
mounting from 15 to 30 per cent, cr  
their value, according to their bulk.  
A question has been made concerning  
the conthtutional right of the govern  
ment of the United States to apply thi:  
species of encouragement, but there 1:  
certainly no good fouudation for fuc!  
a question. The national legifiatun  
has express authority &quot;To lay ant  
collect taxes, duties, imposts, and ex  
cifes, to pay the debts and provide so:  
the comvion defence and general welfare,&#x27;  
with no other qualifications than tha  
&#x27;■ all duties, imposts, and exciles, fhal  
be uniform throughout the United States  
that no capitation or other direst ta&gt;  
shall be laid unless in proportion t&lt;  
numbers ascertained by acenfusor enu  
meration taken on the principles pre  
scribed in the constitution, and tha  
no tax or duty shall be laid on article:  
exported from any state.&quot;  
These three qualifications excepted  
the power to raffe money is plenary an&lt;  
tndefnite; and the objects to which i  
may be appropriated are no less compre  
henfive, than the payment of the pub  
lie debts and the providing for the com  
mon defence and general welfare. The  
terms &quot; general welfare&quot; were doubt]ef&#x27;  
intended to fignify more than was ex  
pressed or imported in tliofe which pre  
ceded ; otherwise numerous exigencies  
incident to the affairs of a nation wouk  
have been left without a provision.   
The phrase is as comprehenlive as an\
that could have been used ; because it  
was not fit that the constitutional au­  
thority of the union, to appropriate it;  
revenues should have been reftrifted  
within narrower limits than the &quot; gene­  
ral welfare and because this neceTa­  
rily embraces a vast variety of particu­  
lars, which are susceptible neither oi  
fpecification nor of definition,

It is therefore of necessity !,-ft to the

concern the genet al welfare, and foi

V. Premiums.  
These are of a nature allied to boun  
ies, though distinguishable from then  
n lome important features.  
Bounties are applicable to the whoh  
juantity of an article produced or ma  
mfaftured, or exported, and involve ;  
orrefpondent expencc Premium  
erve to reward some particular excel  
er.ee or fuperioritv, lome extraordina  
v - : tion or fkiil, and are difpcnlif  
&gt;n!y m a 1: i;;TI number of cases : Bu&#x27;  
heir effect is to flimulate general ef  
011—contrived so as to be Doth hono  
■ary and lucrative, they address them  
elves to different passions ; toucEin;  
,iie chords as well of emulation as o:  
nfrercft.—They are accordingly a very  
economical mean of exciting tiie enter  
prileof a whole community.  
1 here arc various societies in differ  
;r.t countries, whole object is the dif  
penfationof premiums for the encou­  
ragement of agriculture, arts, manufac­  
ture, and commerce ; and though they are  
for the moil part voluntary ali&#x27;ociations  
with comparatively slender finds, theii  
utility has been immense. Much ha&lt;  
been done by this mean in Great-Bri­  
tain : Scotland in particular owes mate­  
rially to it a prodigious amelioration bi  
condition. PYom a similar eftablifh­  
merit in the United States, supplied anc:  
supported by the government of the  
union, vast benefits might reafonabl)  
le expeftcd.—Some further ideas or  
this head, shall accordingly be submit  
ted, in the conclusion of this report.  
VI. The exemption of thi materials&#x27; oJ  
nanufaElures from duty.  
1 he policy of that exemption as a ge­  
neral ride, particularly in reference it  
new establishments, is obvious. It car  
hardly ever be advisable to add the oh  
(tru&amp;ions of fifcal burthens to the difii  
culties which naturally embarrats a nev\
manufacture ; and where it is mature&lt;  
and in condition to become an obje&amp;o  
revenue, it is generally speaking bettei  
that the fabric, than the material, fhouk  
be the fubjeft of taxation.—ldeas o:  
proportion between the quantum o:  
the tax and the value of the article, car  
be more easily adjusted in the formei  
than in the latter cafe. An argument  
for exemptions of this kind in the Uni­  
ted States, is to be derived from the  
pra&amp;ice, as far as their necefiities have  
permitted, of those nations whom wc  
are to meet as competitors in our own  
and in foreign markets.  
1 here are however exceptions to it :  
of which some examples will be given  
under the next head.  
The laws of the union afford instan­  
ces of the observance of the-policy here

 of ex­  
traordinary value, to be able to extend  
the fame benefit to introducers, as well  
as authors and inventors; a policy  
  
which has been rpractifed with advan­  
tage in other countries. Here, howe­  
ver, as in some other cares, there is  
caule to regret, that the competency of  
the authority of the national govern­  
ment to the good, which might ho done,  
is not withe it a question. Many aids  
might be given to industry ; many in­  
tf r j ia I improvements of primary magni­  
tude might be promoted, by an authori­  
ty operating throughout the union,  
which cannot he cilected, as well, if at  
.ill, by an au-.horitv confined within the  
limirs of a fmgle l&gt;&#x27;ate.  
But if the legiijature of the Union  
cannot do ail the good that might be  
wifiied. it is at leal! ddireable, that .ill  
may be done which is practicable.   
Means lor promoting the introduction  
foreign improvements, though lei&#x27;s  
• fficacioufly than might be accoinplifh­  
d with more adequate authority,&#x27; will  
orin a part of the plan intended to be  
übmitted m the clo£e of this leport.  
It is customary with manufacturinp­  
nations to prohibit, under severe penai-&gt;  
;ias, the exportation of implements and  
machines, which they have either in­  
dented or improved. There are alrea­  
dy objects for a similar regulation in the  
United States; and others may be ex­  
pected to occur from time to time. The  
idoption of it seems to be dictated by  
he principle of reciprocity. Greater  
iberality in such respects might better  
comport with the general spirit of the  
country ; but a felfilh and exclusive po­  
uicy in other quarters will not always  
permit the free indulgence of a spirit,  
which would place us upon an unequal  
footing. As far as prohibitions tend  
to prevent foreign competitors from  
teriSTng-the benertTS~Of the improve­  
ments made at home, they tend to en­  
-lcale the advantages of those by whom  
hey may have been introduced ; and  
operate as an encouragement to exer­  
:ion.  
IX, Judicious regulations for the irfpec~  
iion of manufallured commodities.  
This is not among the least important  
i)fthe means, by which the prosperity  
d! manufactures may be promoted. It is  
indeed in many cases one of the most  
:lfential. Contributing to prevent  
frauds upon consumers at home,   
portersto foreign countries&#x27;—to improve  
:he quality and prelerve the character  
ihe national manufactures, it cannot  
fail to aid the expeditious and advanta­  
geous lale of them, and to serve as a  
against fuCcefsful competition  
from other quarters. The reputation  
d 1 the flour and lumber of some   
and of the potash of others, has been  
sflablifhed by an attention to this point.  
A.nd the like good name might be pro­  
:ured for those articles whereloever pro­  
duced, by a judicious and uniform fyf­  
em of infpeftion, throughout the ports  
)f the United States. A like system  
night also be extended with advantage  
0 other commodities.  
X. The facilitating of pecuniary remit­  
&#x27;ances from place to place—  
is a point of considerable moment to  
irade in general, and to manufattures in  
particular ; by rendering more easy the  
purchase of raw materials and provifi­  
3ns, and the payment for manufa&amp;ured  
supplies. A general circulation of  
bank paper, which is to be expected  
from the institution lately eftablilhed  
will be a moll valuable mean to this  
nd. But much good would also ac­  
-1 rue from some additional provisions.  
refpefting inland bills of exchange. If  
those drawn in one ftatepayable in ano­  
ther were made negotiable, every where,  
and interest and damages allowed in  
cafe of protest, it would greatly promote  
negociations between the citizens of  
different states, by rendering them more  
Secure; and, with it the convenience  
and advantage of the merchants aacl  
manufacturers of each

 the administration, should be guarded from any  
peculiar tendency to injure them.  
There are certain fpe.cies of taxes, which are apt  
to be opprefiive to different parts of the communi­  
ty, and among other ill effeCts have a very un­  
friendly aspect towards manufactures. All poll or  
capitation taxes are of this nature. They either  
proceed, according to a fixed rate, which operates  
unequally, and injurioully to the industrious poor;  
or they vest a discretion in certain officers, to make  
estimates and affefYments&#x27; which are necelTa*ily  
vague, conjectural and liable to abuse. They  
ought therefore to be abftaincd from, in all but  
cases ofdiftreffing emergency.  
All such taxes (including all taxes on qccupa­  
tions) which proceed according to the amount of  
capital supposed to be employed in a business, or  
of profits Juppofed to be made in it are unavoidably  
hurtful to indu(try. It is in vain, that the evil  
may be endeavored to be mitigated by leaving it,  
in the firft instance, in the option of the party to be  
taxed, to c&#x27;eclare the amount of his capital or profits.  
Men engaged in any trade or business have com­  
monly weighty reasons to avoid aifclofures, which  
would expose, with any thing like accuracy, the  
real state of their affairs. They most frequently  
find it better to rifle oppreflion, than to avail them­  
selves of so inconvenient a refuge. And the con­  
sequence is, that they often fufrer oppression.  
When the disclosure too, if made, is not defini­  
tive, but controulable by the discretion, or in other  
words, by. the paflions and prejudices of the reve­  
nue officers, it is not only an ineffectual protec­  
tion, but the pofiibiiity of its being so is an addi­  
tional reason for not resorting to it.  
Allowing to the public officers the most equita­  
ble dispositions j yet where they are to exercise a  
discretion, without certain data, they cannot fail  
to be often&#x27;mifled bv appearances. The quantity  
of business, which seems to be going on, is, in a  
vast number of cases, a very deceitful criterion of  
the profits which are made ; yet it is perhaps the  
best they can have, and it is the one, on which  
they will most naturally rely. A business there­  
fore whicft may rather require aid, from the go­  
vernment, than be in a capacity to be contributory  
to it, may find itfelf crushed by the mistaken con­  
jectures of the assessors of taxes.  
Arbitrary taxes, under which denomination are  
compTifed aH those, that leave the quantum of the  
tax, to be raised on each person, to the discretion of  
certain officers, are as contrary to the genius of  
liberty as to the maxims of industry. In this  
light, they have been viewed by the most judicious  
observers on government; who have bestowed upon  
them the severest epithets of reprobation j as con­  
stituting one of the worst features usually to be  
  
met w.ih in the praCUce of dfefpotiS governments.  
it is ccrtain at leafl, that such taxes aie parti­  
cularly inimical to the success of manufacturing  
industry, and ought carefully to be avoided by go  
verumenr, which defifes to promote it.  
The great copiousness of thei\rbjeCfc of this re­  
port has insensibly led to a more lengthy prelimi­  
nary d i feu Hi on, thah was originally contemplated,  
or intendeds It appeared proper to inveftigatc  
rinc ples, to consider objections, and to endeavor  
to eftablifn the utility of the thing proposed to bt,  
encouraged } previous to a fpccifrcation of the ob­  
jects which might occur, as meriting or repairing,  
encouragment, and of the measures, which might  
be proper, in respeCt to each. The firft purpofi­  
having been fulfilled, it remains to pursue the se­  
cond.  
In the seleCtion of objeCts, five   
seem entitled to particular attention: The ca­  
pacity of the country to furni/h the raw material—  
the degree in which the natu.e of the manufac­  
ture admits of a substitute for manual labor in ma­  
ciiinery—rthe facility of execution—the extenfive­  
r.els or the uses, to which the article can beappli­  
■ d—its fublerviency to other interells, particular  
ly the great one of national defence. There are  
however objects, to which these circumrtances  
are little applicable, whiclf for some special rea­  
fjns, may have a.claim to encouragement.  
A deflgnation of the principal raw material of  
which cach manufacture is composed will fcrvc  
to introduce the remarks upon ir. — As, in th  
firft place  
IRON.  
The manufactures of this articic arc entitled to  
pre-eminent rank—None are more efieritial In  
their kinds, nor so extensive in their uses. They  
confiitute in whoic or in part the implements or  
the materials, or both, of almofl every ulefui occu­  
pation. Their iiiil&#x27;romentality is every where con*  
fpicuous.  
It is foitunate for the United States that they  
have peculiar advantages for deriving the fulL be­  
nefits of this mo ft valuable material, and they have  
every motive to. improve it, with systematic c?re.  
it is to be found in various parts of the United

long been open in the fouth-weftein parts of Vir­

oi - crrleral l&#x27;vt*em of inf&#x27;peftion, throughout til

are however ennfiderations which (land in the wa;  
of fuctr an arrangement.  
Ardent spirits and jn:h liqttors are, next t

Till- liitt has made a very cxii::if:v , the last

The exiting laws of the United Stateshavi don  
much towards attaining this valuable object j bu  
fotre additions to the prafent duties, on fjreigi  
diltilled spirits, and foreign malt liquors, an&#x27;  
perhaps an abatement of those on home made fpi  
rits, would more effectually secure it j and ther

to secure to the nation the benefit ot a rnanufac  
ture, even of foreign materials, always o  
great, though perhaps of secondary importance.  
A strong imprefiion pievails in the minds 0  
tiiofe concerned in distilleries (including too th.  
most candid and enlightened) that greater differ  
ences in the ratea of duty on foreign and domes  
tic spirits are necessary completely to secure th.  
fuccefs.&#x27;ul manufacture of the latter; and ther,  
are fails which entitle this imp»ellion to attention  
It is known, that the price of motafl&#x27;es far fjnn  
years pad, has been tuccefiively rising ill th&#x27;  
Weft-India markets, owing partly to a compe  
tition which did not formerly cxift, and partly tt  
an extenfiori of demand in this country ; and i  
is evident, that the late disturbances in thof  
iHands, from which we draw our principal sup.  
ply, mult so tar interfere with the produ£!ion o  
the article, as to occasion a mateiial enhance  
ment of price. The deftrudtion and devaliatioi  
attendant on the infurreftion in Hifpaniola, it  
particular, mull not only contribute very raucl  
to that eflredl, but may be expected to give i  
J&#x27;ome duration. These circumffances, and tii*  
duty of three cents per gallon on molasses, maj  
render it difficult for the distillers of that materi­  
al to maintain, wirh adequate profit, a competi­  
tion, with the rum brought from the Weft-ln­  
dies, the quality of which is so conliderably su­  
perior.  
The consumption of geneva or giri in this coun­  
try is extensive. It is no: long since difiilleriei  
of it hsve grown up among us, to any imporranct*.  
They arc now becoming of confequrnce, but be­  
ing still in their infancy, they require protection.  
It is reprefeated, that the price of foxne cf tht  
materials ia greater here, than in Holland&gt; frorr  
which place large quantities are brought—-th&lt;  
price of labor considerably greater—the capitals  
engaged in the bufcnefs there much larger, thar  
those which are employed here—the rate of pro-  
Jits, at which the undertakers can afford to car­  
ry it on, much less—the prejudices, in favor ol  
imported gin, strong. These circumstances ar&lt;  
alledged to outweigh the charges, which attend  
the bringing of the article from Europe to th&lt;  
United States, and the present difference of duty,  
so as toobftruft the prosecution of the manufac­  
ture, with due advantage.  
Experiment could perhaps alone decide witl  
Certainty the justness of the suggestions, which  
are made ; but in relation to branches of manu­  
facture so important, it would fecm inexpedient  
to hazard an unfavorable ifiue, and better to erx  
on the fide of too great, than of too small a dif  
ference, in the particular in question.  
It is therefore hibmitted, that an addition o!  
two cents per gallon be made to the duty on im­  
ported spirits of the firrt class of proof, with a  
proportionable encreafe on those of higher proof ;  
and that a deduction of one cent per gallon b*  
made from the duty on spirits diftillsd within the  
United States, beginning with the class oi  
proof, and a proportionable de&lt;2usicn from the  
duty on these of higher proof.

The feerctary of the treafury, in obedience to the order of the boufe of reprefen-  
tatives, of the 15th of January 1790, has applied bis attention, at as earl a  
period as bis other duties would permit, to the fubje&amp; of manufadlures ; and  
particularly to the means of promoting fuch as will tend to render the united  
fates independent on foreign nations, Jor military and other effential fupplies :  
and be thereupon refpecifully fubmits the following report :  
  
me ee expediency of encouraging manufaftures in the united ftates, which  
  
was, not long fince, deemed very quettionable, appears at this time to  
be pretty generally admitted. The embarraflments, which have obftruéted the  
progrefs of our external trade, have led to ferious reftexions on the nec-flity of  
enlarging the -fphere of our domeftic commerce, the reftritive regulations,  
which in foreign markets abridge the vent of the increafing furplus of our  
agricultural produce, ferve to beget an earneft defire, that a more extenfive  
demand for that furplus may be created at home. And the complete juccels  
which has rewarded manufadturing enterprile, in fome valuable branches, con-  
{ping with the promifing fymptoms which attend fome tefs mature effays  
in others, juitify a hope, that the obftacles to the growth of this f{pecies of  
indultry, are lefs formidable than they were apprehended to be; and that it  
is not difficult to find in its further extenfion, a full indemnification for any ex-  
ternal difadvantages, which are, or may be experienced, as weil as an accef-  
fion of refources favourable to national independence and fafety.  
  
There ftill are, neverthelefs, refpeftable patrons of opiniows, unfriently to  
the encouragement of manufactures. The following are, fubitanually, the ar-  
guments by which thefe opinions are defended ;  
  
‘© In every country (fay thofe who entertain them) agriculture is the moft  
beneficial and produftive objeft of human induflry, ‘This podtion, generally,  
if not univerfally tue, applics with peculiar emphafis to the united fates, on  
account of their immenfe tracts of fertile territory, uninhabited and unimproved.  
Nothing can afford {fo advantageous an employment for capital and labour, as  
the converfion of this extenfive wildernefs into cultivated farms. Nothing e+  
qually wich this, can contribute to the population, ftrength, and real siches of

itory=-the conftant allurements to emigration from  
the fettled to the umiettied parts of the country—thé facility with which the lefs  
independent condition of an artifan can be exchanged for the more independent  
condition of a farmer—thefe, and fimilar caufes, confpire to produce, and, for  
a length of time, muft continue to otcafion, a fearcity of hands for manufac.  
turing occupation, and dearnefs of labour generaliy. To thefe difadvantages  
for the profecution of manufaétures, a deficiency of pecuniary capital being  
Hided, the profpeét of a fuccefsful competrtion with the manufacturers of Eu-  
rope, muft be regarded as little lefs than cdefperate. Extenfive manufaétures  
ean only be the offspring of a redundant, at leaft of a full poptlation. Till  
the latter fhall charatterife the fituation of this country, ‘tis vain to hope for  
the former,  
  
‘If, contrary to the natural courfe of things, an unfeafonsble and premature  
fpring can be given to certain fabrics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, bounties,  
or by other forced expedients ; this will only be to facrifice the interefts of the  
community to thofeof particular claffes. Befides the mifdirection of iabour, a  
virtual monopoly will be given to the perfons employed on fueh fabrics ; and  
an enhancement of price, the inevitable confequence of every monopoly,  
muft be defrayed at the expenfe of the other parts of the fociety. It is far pre-  
ferable, that thofe perfons fhould be engaged in the cult#wation of the earth,  
and that we fhould procure, in exchange for its prodedtions, the commodities,  
with which foreigners are able to fupply us in greater perfection, and upen bet-  
ter terms.”  
  
This mode of reafoning is founded upon faéts and principles, which have  
tertainly refpeétable pretenfions. If it had governed the conduét of nations,  
more generally than it has done, theré is room to fuppofe, that it might have  
carried them fafter to profperity and greatnefs, than they have attained by the  
purfuit of maxims too widely oppofite. Moft general theories, however, admit  
of numerous exceptions ; and there are few, if any, of the political kind,  
which do not biend a confiderable portion of error with the truths they in-  
tulcate.  
  
In order to an accurate judgment, how far that, which has been juft fated,  
Ought to be deemed liable to a fimilar imputation, it is neceffary to advert care-  
fully to the confiderations which plead in favour of manufa@tures, and whch  
appear to recommend the fpecial and pofitive encouragement of them, in cer-  
tain eafes, and under certain reafonable limitations.  
  
Tt ought readily to be conceded, thatthe cultivation of the earth, as the pri-  
mary and moft certain fource of national fupply—as the immedi te and chief  
fource of furfiftence to min—is the principal foarce of thofe materials which  
conttitute the nutriment of other kinds of labour—as including 2 ftate moft fa.  
Vourable to the freedom and independence of the human mind—one, perhaps,  
thoit conducive to the multiplication of the hu:nan fpecieseas intrinficaily a  
ftrong claim to pre-eminence over every other kind of indaftry.  
  
Bot, that it has a title, to any thing like an exclufive predile€tion,in any  
country, oughtto be admitted with great caution. That it is even more pro-  
du&amp;tive than every branch of induftry, requires more evidence than has yet  
  
been given in fupport of the pofition, Tat its real interefts, precious and im-

portant as, without the help of exaggeration, they truly are, will be advanced,  
rather than injured by the due encouragement of manufactures, may, it is bee  
lieved, be fatisfagterily demonftrated. And it 1 alfo believed, that the expediency  
of {uch encouragement, in a general view, may be fhown to be recommended  
by the moft cogent and perfuafiye motives of pational policy.  
  
It bas been maintamed, that agriculture. is not only the moft produdtive, but  
the only produdlive fpecies of induftry, The reality of this fuggeftion, in ¢i-  
ther reipeét, has, howeved, not been verified by any accurate detailof fa&amp;s  
and calcutatians : and the general arguments, which are adduced to prove it,  
ave rather jubt:| and peradcxical, than folid or convincing.  
  
‘Thofe, which maintain its exclufive productivenefs, are to this effe&amp; ;  
  
Labour, beftowed upon the cultivation of land, produces enough, nog  
enly to replace all the neceflary expenfes incuried in the bufineis, and to  
&quot; qmaintain the perfons who are employed in it, but to afford, together with the  
  
ordinary profit on the ftock or capital of the farmer, a net {urpius, or rent fos  
the landlord or proprietor of the (oil. But the labour of artificers does nothing  
more than replice the @ock which employs them, or which furnithes materials,  
tools, and wages, and yield the ordinary profit upon that ftock. It yields nothing  
equivalent to the rentof land. Neither does it add any thing to the total  
value of the whole awnual produce of the land aid labour of the country. ‘The  
additional value given to thofe parts of the produce of land, which are  
wrought into manufaétures, is counterbalanced by the value of thofe other  
parts of that produce, which are gonfumed by the manufacturers. It can  
therefore only be by faving or parfimony, not by the politive produdivene(s of  
their labour, that the clafles of artificers.can in any degree augment the revenue  
of the fociety.  
  
To this ut has been anfwered,  
  
a. “* That mafmuch as it is acknowledged, that manufaéturing labour re-  
- produces a value equal to that which is expended or confumed in carrying it on,  
and continues in exiftence the original ftock or capital employed, it ought, on  
that account alone, to efcape bemg confidered as wholly unproductive ; tiat  
‘though it thould be admitted, as alleged, that the confumption of the pro-  
duce of the foil, by the claffes of artificers or manufacturers, is exadtly equal to  
the value added by -her labour tothe materials upon which it is exerted ; yet  
it would not therce foll.w, that it added nething tothe revenue of the fociety,  
or to the aggregate value of the annual produce of its land and labour. If  
the confumption, tor any given period, amounted to a given fun, cnd the  
increafed value of the produce manufaftured, in the fame peviod, to a like tum,  
the total amount of the confumption and produétion during that period, would  
be equal to the two fums, and coniequently d-uble the valve of the agericul-  
tural produce confumed. And though the increment of value, produced by the  
clafles of artificers, thould at no time exceed the value of the produce cf the  
land confumed by them, yet there would be at every moment, in confequence  
of their labour, a greater value of goods in the market, than would exilt inie-  
pendent of it,  
  
2. ‘* That the pofition, that artificers. can augment the revenye of a fociety,  
only by .parfimony, is true in no other tenfe, than in one which is equally applica-  
-ble to hufbandmen or cultivators. It may be aljke affirmed of all thete clafles,  
that thefund acquired by their labour, and deftined for their fupport, is not, in an  
ordinary way, more than equal to it, And:hence it will follow, that augmenta-  
tions of the wealth or capital of the community (exceptin the inftances of fome  
extraordinary dexterity or fkill) can only. proceed, with refpeét to any of them,  
from the favings of the more thritty and parfimonious,

4° _Repart of the feeretary of the treafury on manufaflures, [i792  
  
ufeful labour, which a€tually exifts within it, or by fome increafe in the quantity  
of fuch labour ; that wit! regard to the firlt, the labour of artificers being capable  
of greater fuhdivifion and fimplhicity of operation, than that of cultivators, it is  
fufceptidle, in a propoitionably greater degrees of improvement in ‘its produc.  
tive powers, whether to be derived froman acceffion of fkill, or from the appli-  
cation of ingenious machinery; in which particular, therefore, the labour em-  
ployed in the culture of land can pretend to no advantage over that engaged in  
manufaétures: that with regard to an augmentation of the quantity of ufeful  
- labour, this, excluding adventitious cireumftances, muft depend effentially upon  
an increate ot capital, which again muft depend upon the favings made out of the  
revenues of thofe, whe furnith or manage that, which is atany time, employed,  
whether in agriculture, or in manufaélures, or in any other way.”  
  
But while the exclufive produ&amp;ivenels of agricultural labour has been thus —  
  
denied and refuted, the fuperiority of its produétivenefs has been conceded with-  
out hefitation. As this conceffion involves a point of confiderable magnitude,  
in re!ation to maxiins of public adminiftration, the grounds om which it refts are  
worthy of a diftiné and particulas-examination.  
  
One of the arguments made ule ef, in fupport of the idea, may be pronounced  
both quaint and fuperficial ; it amount» to this.—T hat in the pred udtions of the  
foil, nature co-operates with man; and that the effc&amp; of their joint labour mutt  
be greater than that of the labour of man alone.  
  
This, however, is far from being a neceflary inference. It is very exnecnnbi,  
that the labour of man alone laid out wpon a work, requiring great {kill and art  
to bring it to perfeétion, may be more produétive, in value, than the lahour of  
nature and man combined, when direéted towards more fimple operations and  
objecis : and when it is recolleéte.t to what ag extent the agency of nature, in  
the application of the mechanical powers, is made auxiliary&#x27;to the profecution  
of manufattures, the fuggeflion which has been noticed, lofes even the appear.  
ance of plaufibility.  
  
Jt might alfo be obferved, with a contrary view, that the ls hour employed in  
Tgriculture is in a great meafire periodical and occafional, depending on feafors,  
liable to various and long intermiffions ; while that occupied in many manufac.  
tures is conftant and regular, extending throwgh the year, embracing, in fome  
inttances, night as weil as day. Itis alto probabie, that ahere are among the  
cultivators ot laod, more examples of remiffaefs, than:agrong artificers. The  
farmer, from the peculiar fertility of his land, or forne other favourable circum.  
ftance, may fequently obtain a livel-hood, even witha confiderable degree of  
earcleffnefs in the mode of cultivation ; but the artifan can with difficulty ef &amp;  
the fame object, without exerting himéelf pretty equaliy with all thofe, whovare  
engaged in the fame purluit. And if it may likewife be aflumed as a taét, that  
raanufadlures open a wider field to exertions of ingenuity than agriculture, it  
would not bea ftraine! conjefture, that the labour employed in the former be-  
ing at once more confant, more unitorm, and more ingenious, than that which  
is employed in the latter, will be found at the fame time more productive.  
  
But it is not meant tolay ftvefs on obfervations of this nature: they ought  
only to ferve as a counterbalance to thole of a fimilar complexion. Circum-  
ftances fo vague and general, as well as fo sbftraét, can afford little inttruétion  
in a matter of this kind.  
  
Another, and that which feems to be the principal argument offered -for  
the fuperior produStivenefs of agricultural labour, turns upon the allegation,  
that labour omiphged on wanufactures. yields nothing equivalent to the rent of  
land ; or tothat net furplus, as it is called, which accrues to the proprietor of the  
foil, But this difiinétion, m»portant as ithas been deemed, appears rather ver bal  
than fubftantial.

Part 1.) Report of the fecretary of the treafury on manufaftures. 5  
  
It is eafily difcernible, that what, in the firft inftance, is divided into twe  
parts, under the denominations of the ordinary profit of the ftock of the far-  
mer and rentto the landlord, is, in the fecond inflance, unired under the gene-  
ral appel&#x27; ation of the ordinary profit on the ftock of the undertaker; and that  
this formal or verbal diftribution conftitutes the whole difference in the two  
cafes. It feems to have been overiooked, that the land is itfelf a ttock or capital,  
advanced or lent by its owner to the occupier or tenant, and that the rent he re-  
ceives is only the ordinary profit of a certain fio.kin land, not managed by the  
proprietor himfelf, but by another to whom he lends or lets it, 2nd who, on his  
part, advances a fecond capital to ftock and improve the lanu, upon which he  
alfo réceives the ufual profit. The rent of the landlord and the profic of the  
farmer are therefore nothing more than the ordinary profits of two capitals, be-  
longing to two different perfons, and united in the cultivation of a tarm: as, in  
the other cafe, the furplus which arifes upon any manufactory, after replacing  
the expenfes of carrying it on, on{weis to the ordinary profits of one or more  
capitals engaged in the profecution of fuch manufactory. It is faid one or more  
capitals: becaufe, in faét, the fame thing whici is contemplated in the caie of  
the farm, forsetimes happens in that of a manufactory. There is one, who fur-  
nithes a part of the capital, or lends a pait of the money, by which it ts carried  
on, and another, who carries it on, with the addition of his own capital. Out of  
the furpius which remains, after defraying expenfes, an intereft is paid to the mo-  
ney-lender for the proportion of the capital furnifhed by him, which exaétly a-  
grees with the rent paid to the landlord: and the refidue of that furplus con-  
ftitutes the profit of the undertaker or manufacturer, and agrees with what is  
denominated the ordinary profits of the ftock of the farmer. Both together  
make the ordinary profits of two capitals employed in a manufaétory; as in  
the other cafe, the rent of the landlord and the revenue of the farmer cempofe  
the ordinary profits of two capitals, employed in the cultivation of a farm.  
  
The rent, therefore, accruing to the proprietor of the lard, far from being a  
criterion of exclufive produ@tivenefs, as has been argued, is no criterion even of  
fwperior produftivenefs. The queftion muft ftill be, whether the furpius, after  
defraying expenfes, of a given capital, employed in the purchase and impiove-  
ment of a piece of land, is gveater or lefs, than that of a like capital, employed  
in the profecution of a manufaétory ; or whether the whole value produced from  
a given capital, and a given quantity of labour, employed in one way, be great-  
er or lefs than the whole value produced from an equal capital and an equal  
quantity of labour, employed in the other way ; or rather, perhap’, whecher the  
bufinefs of agriculture or that of manufactures will yield the greateft p:odu@,  
according to a compound ratio of the quantity of the capital and the quantity of  
labour, which are employed in the one or in the other.  
  
The folution of either of thefe queftions is not eafy: it involves numerous  
complicated details, depending on an accurate knowledge of the obje&amp;s to he  
compared. It is not known that the comparifon has ever yet been mace upon  
fufficient data, properly afcertained and analifed. To be able to make it on the  
prefent cccafion, with fatisfa&amp;tory precifion, would demand more previous en-  
quiry and inveftigation, than there has been hitherto either leifure or opportunity  
to accomplith.  
  
Some effays, however, have been made towards acquiring the requifite infor-  
mation ; which have rather ferved to throw doubt upon, than to coifisin the hy-  
pothefis, under examination. But it ought to be acknowledged, that they have  
been too little diverfified, and are tooimperfeé, to authorife a definitive conclu.  
fion, either way ; leading rather to probable conjecture than to certain deduc-  
tion. They render it probable, that there are various branches of manufaQures,  
‘in -which a given capital will yield a greater total product, and a confiterably

has been already obferved, to the whole amount of the provifions, raw materi.  
ais, and manufactures, which would exift, on a contrary fuppofition, The ati-  
ficer, at the fame time, would be going on in the produ@ion of manufactured  
commodities; to an amount fufficient not only to repay the farmer, in thofe  
commodities, for the provifions and materials which were procured from him, but  
to furnith the artificer himiclf with a fupply of fimilar camino tities for is own  
ule. Fhuethen, there would be two quantiucs or values in exitlence, in@ead of  
one; and the revenue and ¢oniumption would be double nm one cae, what it  
would be in the ether,  
  
If, im place of both thefe fuppofitions, there were fuppofed to be two  
farmers and no ariificer, each of whom applicd a part of hs labour to the cule  
ture of land, and another part to the fabrication of manufactures; in Chis cxfe,  
the portion of the labour of both, beftowed upon land, would produce the Lune  
quantity of provifions and raw materials only, as woul! be procuced by the  
entive (um of the labour of one applied in the {ame manner : and tie portion of  
the labour of both beftowed upon manufactures, would produce the fame quan.  
tity of manufaétures only as would be produced by the entire fum of the la.  
bour of one applied in the fame manner. Hence the produce of the labour of  
the twe farmers, would not be greater than the produce of the labour of the  
farmer and artificer ; and hence it refults, that the labour of the oruficer is as  
politively productive as thas of the farmer, and, as polit veiy, augments the re-  
venue of the fociety.  
  
The labour of the artificer replaces to the farmer thot portion of his la.  
bour with which he provides the materials of exchange with the art ficer, and  
which he would otherwife have been compelied to apply to manufadlares; and  
while the artificer thus enables the farmer to enlarge his flock of agricultural  
induttry, a portion of which he puichales for his own ufe, he alfo fupplies him-  
feif with the manufaQlured articles of which he tlands in need. He does Mil  
more. Befides this equivalent, which he gives for the portion of agvicultural la-  
bour confumed by him, and this fupply of manufaflured commodities for bis  
own confumption, he furnithes ftill a furplus, which compen(ites for the ufe of  
the capital advanced either by himfelf or fome other perion, for carrying on the  
bufinefs, This is the ordinary profit of the Kock employed in the manula@ory ;  
and «s, in every feule, as eficdtive an addition to the imcome of the fociety, as  
the rent of land.  
  
The produce of the labour of the artificer, conf quen:ly, may be rerarded as  
compoted of three parts; one, by which the provilions for bis tubfitionce and  
the materials for his work are purchafed of the farmer; one, by wiich be fup-

Each of thefe circunftances has a confiderable influence upon the total mafs  
of induttrious effort in a community ; together, they add to it a degree of ener-  
gy and effzét, which are not eafily conceived. Some comments upon each of  
then, in the order in which they have been ftated, may ferve to explain their  
importance,  
  
I. As to the divifion of labour.  
  
It has juftly been ob‘erved, that there is fcarcely any thing of greater mo-  
ment in the economy of a nanon, than the proper divifion of labour, The fe-  
paration of occupations caufes each to be carried to a much greater pevrfeétion  
than it could poffibly acquire, if they were blended. This arifes principally  
from three circumftances.  
  
rft, The greater fkill and dexterity naturally refulting from a conftant and  
uadivided application to a fingle obiect. It is eviden’, that thefe properties muft  
increa‘e, in proportion to the feparation and fimpliication of objeéts and the  
fteadinefs of the attention devoted to each; and mutt be lefs, in proportion te  
the complication of objects, and the number among which the attention is dif-  
traéted,  
  
2d. The economy of time, by avoiding the lofs of it, incident to a frequent  
tranfition from one operation to another of a different nature. This depends on  
various circumftances ; the tranfition itfeit—the orderly difpofition of the im-  
plements, machines, and materials employed in the operation to be relinquifhed  
—the preparatory fteps to the commencement of a new one—the interruption of  
the impulfe, which the mind of the workman acquires, from being engaged in  
a particular operation—the ditractions, hefitations and relu€tances, which at-  
tend the paffage from one kind of bufinefs to another,  
  
gd. An extenfion of the ufe of machivery. A man eccupied ona fingle ob-  
jeét, will have it more in his power, and will be more naturaliy led to exert  
his imagination in devifing methods to facilitate and abridge labour, than if he  
were perplexed by a variety of independent and diffimilar operations. Befides  
this, the fabrication of machines, in numerous inflances, becoming itfelf a dif  
tingt trade, the aitift, who follows it, has all the aivantages which have beeg  
enunserated, for improvement in his particular art : and in both ways the invers  
tion and application of machinery are extended.  
  
And from thele caufes united, the mere fep ration of the occupati &gt; m of the  
cultivator, from that of the artificer, has the eff:&amp; of augmenting the produc-  
tive powers of labour, and with them, the total mafs of the produce or revenue  
of a country. In this fingle view of the fubje&amp;, therefore, the utility of a:tificers  
or manufacturers, towards promoting an increale of produftive induftry, is ap-  
pu ent.  
  
Ii. As to an extenfion of the ule of machinery, a point which, though part-  
ly anticipat ed, requires to be pl. iced in one or two additional lights,  
  
The employment of machinery forms an item of great importance in the  
  
  
  
Part f.) Report of the fecretaty of the tredfury on sitwisfabures. ty  
  
general mafs of national induftry. *Tis an artificial force | rought i in aid of the  
natural force of man; and, to all the purpof-s of labour, is am increafe of  
hands; aa acceflion of frength, unincumbered too by the expenfe of maimtain-  
ing the labourer. May it not therefore be tai.ly inferred, that thofe occupations  
which give greatelt {cope to the ufe of this auxi iary, contribute mott to the ge-  
neral ttock of induftrious effort, aud, in couf-quences to the general produét of  
induttry ?  
  
It thall be taken for granted, and the truth of the pofition referred to obfer-  
vation, that manufacturing purtuits are fulceptible in a greater degree of the  
application of machinery, than thote of agriculture. If fo, ali the difference  
is loft to a community, which, inftead of manufaéturing for itfcif, procures the  
fabrics requilite to its fupply from other countries. The fub itution of foreign  
for domeftic manufactures is a transfer to foreign nations of the advantag:$ ac-  
cruing from the employment of machinery im the modes in which tt is capable  
of being employed, with moft utility and to the gre teft extent.  
  
The cotton mill inventedin England, within the laft tweity years, is a fignal  
illuftration of the general propofition, which has been juft advanced. In conte-  
quence of it, all the diffevent procefles for {pinning cotton are performed by  
means of machines, which are put in motion by water, and attended chiefly by  
women and children ; and by a finaller number of pe: {ns, in the whole, than are  
requifite in the ordinary mode of {pinning. And it is an advantage of great  
moment, that the operations of this mill continue with convenience, daring the  
night, as well as through the day. The prodigious effect of fuch 2 machine 1s  
eafily conceived. To this invention is to be attributed effentally the immenis  
progrefs, which has been fo fuddenly made in Great Biitain, im the various fa-  
brics of cotton.  
  
III. As to the additional employment of claffes of the community, not cri-  
ginally engaged in the particular bufinefs.  
  
This is not among the leatt valuable of the means by which manufaciur-  
ing inftitutions contribute to augment the general ftock of induttry and produc-  
tion. In places where thofe inttitutions prevail, befides the perfons reguia ly en-  
gaged in them, they afford oceafional and extra employment to induttrious  
individuals and families, who are willing to devote the leifure seiuliung  
from che intermiflions of theig ordinary purivits to collateral labours, as a re.  
fource for mul:iplymg their acquifinons or their enjoyments. The hutiindnan  
himielf experiences a new fource of profit and fuppo.t from the incresicd indul-  
try of his wife and daughters; invited and ttunulated by the demands of the  
fheighbouring manufaories.  
  
Befides this advantage of occafional employment to elaffzs having different  
occupations, there is a another cf a nature allied to it, and of a fi.vilar ter dency.  
This is, the employment of perfons who would otherwife be idie (ind, in ma-  
ny cafes, a burden on the community) ei: her from the bias of temper, habit, in-  
firmity of body, or fome other caule, indif{pofing or diqualifying them tor the  
toils of the country. Itis worthy of particular remark, that, in general, wo.  
men and chidven are rendered more ufetul, and the later more early ufetul, t  
manufacturing eftablifiments, than they would otherwile be. OF the nu uber  
of pertons employed in the cotten manufaéto. ies of Great Briain, it is com.  
puted thit four-fevenths neaily aie women and chikdien; of whom the greate.t  
proportion are children, and many of them of a tener age.  
  
And thus it appears to be one of the attributes of manuractures, and one of  
no imall confequence, to give occafion to the exertion of a greater quantity of  
induitry, even vy the fase number of perfons, where they happen te prevail,  
7&quot; would ce, i there were no fuch eftablithments.

TV. As to the promoting of emigration from foreign countries.  
  
Men relustantly quit one courfe of occupation and livelihood for another,  
tunlefs invited to it by very apparent and proximate advantages, Many, who  
would go from one country to another, if they had a profpeét of continuing,  
with mere benefir, the callings to which they have been educated, will often not  
be tempted to change their fituation by the hope of doing better in fome other  
way. Manufacturers, who (liftening to the powerful invitations of ajbetter[price  
for their fabrics, or their labour, of greater cheapnefs of provifions and raw ma.  
terials, of an exemption from the chief part of the taxes, burdens and reftraints,  
which they endure in the old world, of greater perfonal independence and con-  
fequence, under the operation of a more equal government, and of, what is  
far more precious than mere religious toleration, a perfeét equality of religious  
privileges) would probably flock from Europe to the united ftates to purfue  
their own trades or profeflions, if they were once made fenfible of the advan.  
tages they would enjoy, and were infpired with an aflurance of encouragement  
and employment, will, with difficulty, be induced to tran{plant themfelves, with  
a view to becoming cultivators of land.  
  
If it be true, then, that it is the intereft of the united ftates to open every  
poflible avenue to emigration from abroad, it affords a weighty argument for  
the encouragement of manufaétures ; which, for the reafon jut affigned, will  
have the flrongeft tendency to multiply the inducements to it.  
  
Here is perceived an important refource, not only for extending the popula-  
tion, and with it the ufeful and produétive labour of the country, but likewife  
for the profecution of manufactures, without deduéting from the number of  
hands which might otherwife be drawn to tillage ; and even for the indemnifica-  
tion of agriculture for fuch as might happen to be diverted from it. Many,  
whom manufacturing views would induce to emigrate, would afterwards yield  
to the temptations, which the particular fituation of this country holds out  
to agricultural purfuits. And while agriculture would in other refpeéts derive  
many fignal and unmingled advantages, from the growth of manufa&amp;ures, itis  
a problem, whether it would gain or lofe, as to the article of the number of  
perfons employed in carrying it on.  
  
V. As to the furnifhing greater {cope for the diverfity of talents and —_e.  
tions, which difcriminate men from each other.  
  
This is a much more powerful mean of augmenting the fund of anery  
induftry than may at firlt tight appear. It is a juft obfervation, that minds, of  
the ftrongeft and mott eines powers for their proper objects, fall below medio.  
crity, and labour without effect, if confined to uncongenial purfuits. And it is  
thence to be inferred, that the refult of human exertion may be immenfely in.  
creafed by diverfifying its objeéts. When all the different kinds of induftry eb.  
tain in a community, each individual can find his proper element, and calli into  
aétivity the whole vigour of his nature. And the community is benefited by  
the fervices of its refpe€tive membeis, in the manner, in which each can ferve  
it with moft effect.  
  
If there be any thing in a remark often to be met with, namely, that there  
is, in the geniusof the people of this country, a peculiar aptitude for mecha-  
nic improvements, it would operate as a forcible reafon for giving opportuni-  
ties to the exercile of that {pecies of talent, by the propagation of manufactures.  
  
VI. As to the affordingga more ample and various field for enterprife.  
  
This alfo is of greater confequence in the general fcale of national exertion,  
than might perhaps on a fuperficial view be iuppofed, and has effects not alto-  
gether diffimilar from thofe of the circumftance laft noticed. To cherith and  
ftimulate the a€tivity of the human mind by multiplying the objeéts of enter-  
prife, is not among the leaft confidérable of the expedients, by which the  
wealth of a nation may be promoted, Even things, in themfelves not pofitively

advantageous, fometimes become fo, by their tendency to provoke exertion.  
Every new fcene which is opened to the bufy nature of man, to roufe and  
exert itfelf, is the addition of a new energy to the general Rock of effort.  
  
The fpirit of enterprife, ufeful and prolific as it is, muft neceffary be con-  
traéted or expanded in proportion to the fimplicity or variety of the occupa-  
tions and productions which are to be found in a fociety. It muft be lefs in a  
nation of mere cultivators, than in a nation of cultivators and merchants ; lefs  
in a nation of cultivators and merchants, than in a nation of cultivators, arti-  
ficers, and merchants.  
  
VII. As to the creating, in fome inftances, a new, and fecuring im alla  
more certain and fteady demand for the furplus produce of the foil.  
  
Thisis among the moft important of the circumftances which have been ine  
dicated. It is a principal mean, by which the eftablifhment of manufa@ures  
contributes to an augmentation of the produce or revenue of a country, and  
has an immediate and direé relation to the pro&#x27;perity of agriculture.  
  
It is evident, that the exertions of the hufbandman will be fteady or flu&amp;tu.  
ating, vigorous or feeble, in proportion to the fteadinefs or flu€iuation, ade-  
quatenefs, or inadequatenefs of the markets on which he muft depend, for the  
vent of the furplus, wich may be produced by his labour ; and that fuch  
furplus, inthe ordinary courfe of things, will be greater or lefs in the fame  
proportion.  
  
For the purpofe of this vent, a domeftic market is greatly to be preferred  
to a foreign one; becaufe it is, in the nature of things, far more to be re-  
lied upon.  
  
It is a primary obje&amp;t of the policy of nations, to be able to fupply themfelves  
with fubfiftence from their own foils; and manufaéturing nations, as far as  
circumftances permit, endeavour to procure from the fame fource, the raw ma-  
terials necefflary for their own fabrics. This difpofition, urged by the {pirit of  
monopoly, is fometimes even carried to an injudicious extreme. It feems not  
always tobe recolle&amp;ted, that nations who have neither mines nor manufac-  
tures, can only obtain the manufaétured articles of which they ftand in need,  
by an exchange of the produéts of their foils ; and that, if thofe who can bett  
furnith them with fuch articles, are unwilling to give a due courfe to this  
exchange, they muft of neceflity make every poffible effort to manufagture  
for themfelves ; the effeét of which is, that the manufacturing nations abridge  
the natural advantages of their fituation, through an unwillingnefs to permit  
the agricultural countries to enjoy the advantages ef theirs, and facrifice the  
intereft of a mutually-beneficial intercourfe to the vain project of felling every  
thing and buying nothing.  
  
But it is alfo a confequence of the policy, which has been noted, that the  
foreign demand for the produéts of agricultural countries, is in a geeat degree  
rather cafual and occafional, than certain or conftant. To what extent injuries  
ous interruptions of the demand for fome of the ftaple commodities of the  
wnited ftates, may have been experienced, from that caufe, muft be referred to  
the judgment of thofe who are engaged in carrying on the commerce of the  
country: but it may be fafely affirmed, that fuch interruptions are at times  
very inconveniently felt, and that cafes not unfrequently occur, in which  
markets are fo confined and reftrifted, as to render the demand very unequal  
to the fupply.  
  
Independently likewife of the artificial impediments, which are created by  
the policy in queftion, there are natural caufes tending to render the external  
demand for the furplus of agricultural nations a precarious reliance. The dif-  
ferences of feafonsin the countries which are the confumers, make immenfe  
differences in the produce of their own foils, in different yearsyand confequently

in the degrees of their neceflity for foreign fupply. Plentiful harvefts with them,  
efpecially if fimilar ones occur at the {ame time in the countries which are the  
furnifhers, occafion of courfe a glut in the markets of the latter.  
  
Confidering how faft and how much the progrefs of new fettlements in the  
united ftates muft increafe the ferplus produce of the foil, and weighing {erie  
oufly the tendency of the fyttem, which prevails among moft of the commer.  
ci:l nations of Europe; whateyer dependence may be placed on the force of,  
natural circumftances to counteraét the effiéts of an artificial policy ; there  
appear ftrong reafons to regard the foreign demand for that furplus, as too un-  
certain a reliance, and to defiie a fubititute for it, in an extenfive domettic  
market.  
  
To fecure fuch a market, there is no other expedient, than to promote ma-  
nufacturing eftabl)(hments. Manufagturers, who conttiute the moft numerous  
clafs, after the cultivators of land, are for that reaion the principal coniumers  
of the furplus of their jabour,  
  
This idea ef an extenfiye domeftic market for the furplus produce of the  
foil, is of the firft confequence. Itis, of all things, that which moft effeétually  
conduges to a flourifhing ftate of agriculture. If the eff-ct of manutaétories  
fhould be to detach a portion of the hands, whéh would otherwife be engaged  
in tillage, it might poflibly capfe a {mailer quanuty of lands to be under  
cultivation; but by their tendency to procure a more certain demand for the  
furplus produce of the foil, they would, at the fame time, cauie the lands,  
which were in cultivation, to be better umproved and more produétive. And  
while, by their influence, the condition of each individual farmer would be  
meliorated, the total mafs of agriculiural produ€ion would probably be in.  
creafed. For this muft eyidently depend as much, if not more, upon the de.  
gree of improvement, than upon the number of acres under culture.  
  
It merits particular obfervation, that the multiplication of manufactories not  
only furnifhes a market for thofe articles which have been accuftomed to be  
produced im abunJance, in a country ; but it likewile creates a demand for fuch  
as were either unknown or produced in inconfiderable quantities. ‘lhe bowels,  
as well as the fuiface of the earth, are ranfacked for articles which were be-  
fore neglef&amp;ted. Animals, plants, and minerals acquire a utility and value,  
which were before unexplored.  
  
The foregoing confiderations feem fufficient to eftablifh, as general propofi-  
tions, that itis the intereft of nations to diverfify the induftrions purfuits of  
the individuals who compofe them—that the eftablifhment of manutactures is  
ealculated not only to increafe the general ftock of ufeful and produtive labour,  
but even to improve the ftate of agriculture in particular, certainly to advance  
the ivtereits of thofe who are engaged in it. There are oiher views, that will  
be hereafter taken of the fubjeét, which, it is conceived, will ferve to confirm  
thefe inferences.  
  
III. P: eyicufly to a further difcuffion of the objections to the encouragement  
ef manufactures which have bees ftated, it will be of ule to fee what can be  
faid in reference tothe particular fituation of the united flares, againft the con.  
clufions appearing to refult trom what has been already cffered,  
  
It may be obferved, that the idea is of no inconfjderable weight, that howe-  
ver true it might be, that a ftate, which, pofleffing lirge traéis of vacant and  
fertile territory, was at the fame time fecluded from foreign commerce,  
  
would find its intereft and the intereft of agriculture, in diverting a part of its  
  
opulation from tillage to manufagtures; yet, it will not follow that the fame  
38 true of a ftate, which, having fuch vacant and fertile territory, has, at the  
fame time ample opportunity of procuing from abroad, on good terms, all  
  
the fabrics of which it tands in need, for the fupply of its inhabitants. The

power of doing this at leat fecures the great advantage of a divifion of labour,  
leaving the farmer free to purfue exclufively the cultu eof his land, and enabiing  
him to procure with its products, the manufactured. fupplies requifite either  
to his wants or to bis enjoyments. And though it fhouid be true, that in fete  
tled countries, the diverfification of indultry is conducive t. «a increate in the  
produgtive powers of labour, and to an augmentation of revenue and capiral ;  
yet itis fcarcely conceivable that there can be any thing of fo folni and per-  
manent advantage to an uncultivated and unpeopled country, as to convert  
its waftes into cultivated and inhabited diftriéts. Lr the revenue, in the mean  
tine, fhould be leis, the capital, in the event, muft be greater.  
  
To thefe obfervations, the following appears to bea ististsétory anfwer—  
  
x If the fyftem of perfect liberty to induitry and commerce were the  
prevailing fyitem of nations, the arguments, which difluade a country, 1.- the  
predicament of the united fates, from the zealous puriuit ef masutsétures,  
would doubtle{s have great force. It will not be affirmed, that they might not  
be permitted, with few exceptions, to ferve as th rule of national conduct. In  
fuch a ftate of things, each country would have the full benefit of its peculiar  
advantages, to compenfate for its deficiencies or’ ditaivantages. If one na-  
tion were in condition to fupply manufactured articles on better terms  
than another, that other might find an abundant indemnification im a fuperior  
capacity to turnifh the produce of the foil, And a free exchange, mutually be-  
neficiil, of the commodities which each was able to fupply, on the belt terms,  
might be curried on between them, fapporting in fuil vigour the induitry of  
each. And though the cicumftances which have been mentioned, ani others,  
which will be unfolded heveafter, render it probable, that nations merely agris  
cultural, would not enjoy the fame degree of opulence, in proportion to their  
numbers, as thofe which united manufactures with agricevlture ; yet the pro-  
greflive improvement of the lands of the former, migti, in the end, atone  
for an inferior degree of opulence in the mean time ; and in a cafe, in which  
oppofite confiderations are pretty equally balanced, the option ought perhaps  
always tobe, in favour of leaving induftry to its own direction.  
  
But the {yftem, which has been mentioned, is far from charaéterifing the  
general policy of nations. The preval-nt one has bee regulated by an oppofite  
fpirit. The confequence of it is, that the united ttates are, to a certain extent,  
in the fituation of a country precluded trom foreign commerce. They can,  
indeed, without difficulty, obtain from abroad the mavutastured fupplies, of  
which they are in want; but they experience numerous and very injurious  
impediments to the emiffion and vent ot their own commodities. Nor is this  
the cafe in refagence to a fingle foreign nation only. The regulations of feveral  
countries, with which we have the moit extenfive intercourfe, throw ferious  
obfiructions in the way of the principal ftaples of the united ttates.  
  
In fuch a pofition of things, the united ftates canner exchange with Europe  
on equal terms ; and the want of reciprocity would render them the viétim of  
a fyitem, which fhould induce them to confine their views to agriculture, and  
refrain from manufactures, A conftant and increafing neceflity, on their part,  
for the commodities of Europe, and only a partial and occafional demand tor  
their own, in return, could not but expole them to a ttate of impoverithnent,  
compared with the opulence to which their politcal and natural advantapes au.  
thorife them to aipire.  
  
Remarks of this kind are not made in the fpirit of complaint. ‘Tis for the  
nations, whole regulations are alluded te, to judge for themfeives, whether by  
auning at too much, they do net lofe more than they gain. ’Tis for the unind  
ftates to confider by what means they can render themfelves leat dependent, on  
the combinations, right or wrong, of foreign policy,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
PP Report of the fecretary of the treafury on manufafures, [1792  
  
It is no {mall confolation, that already the meafures which have embarraffed  
our trade, have accelerated internal improvements, which, upon the whole,  
have bettered our affairs, To diverfify and extend thefe improvements, is the  
fureft and fafeft method of indemnifying ourfelves for any inconveniences  
which thole or fimilar meafures have a tendency to beget. If Europe will not  
take from us the produéis of our foil, upon terms confiftent with-our inte.  
reft, the natural remedy is, to contraét, as faft as poffible, our wants of her.  
  
a. The cenverfion of their wafte into cultivated lands is certainly a point  
of great moment in the political calculations of the united fates. But the de.  
gree in which this may poflibly be retarded by the encouragement of manufac.  
tories does not appear to countervail the powerful inducements to affording that  
encouragement.  
  
Ao obfervation, made in another place, is of a nature to have great influ-  
ence upon this quetion. If it cannot be denied, that the interefts, even of agri-  
culture, may be advanced more by having fuch of the lands of a ftate as are  
occupied under good cultivation, than by having a greater quantity occu pied  
under amuch inferior cultivation—and if manutactories, for the reafons af.  
figned, muft be admitted to have a tendency to promote a more fteady and vi-  
gorous cultivation of the lands occupied, than would happen without them—  
it will follow that they are capable of indemnifying a country for a dimi-  
nution of the progrefs of new fettlements ; and may ferve to increafe both the  
capital value and the income of its lands, even though they thould abridge the  
number of acres under tillage.  
  
But it does by no means follow, that the progrefs of new fettlements would  
be retarded by the extenfion of manufaétures. The defire of being an inde-  
dendent proprietor of Jand is founded on fuch ftrong principles in the human  
breaft, that wherethe opportunity of becoming fo is as great as it is in the united  
ftates, the proportion will be finall of thofe, whofe fituations would otherwife  
lead to it, who would be diverted from it towards manufaétures. And it is  
highly probable, as already intimated, that the acceflions of foreigners, who,  
priginally drawn over by manufacturing views, weuld afterwards abandon  
them for agricultural, would be more than an equivalent for thofe of our own  
citizens, who might happen to be detached from them.  
  
The remaining objeétions to a particular encouragement of manufactures in  
the united ftates, now require to be examined.  
  
One of thefe turns on the propofition, that induftry, if left to itfelf, will  
naturally find its way tothe moft ufeful and profitable employment: whence  
jt is iuferred, that manufa&amp;tuies, without the aid of government, will grow up  
as foon and as faft, as the natural ftate of things and the integeit of the com-  
munity may require.  
  
Againft the folidity of this hypothefis, in the full latitude of the terms, very  
cogeat reafons may be offered. Thefe have relation to the ftrong influence of  
habit and the fpirit of imitation, the fear of want of fuccefs in untried enter-  
prifes, the intrinfic difficulties incident to firft effays towards a competition with  
thofe whe have previoufly attained to perfeétion in the bufinefs to be attempted,  
the bounties, premiums, and other artificial encouragements, with which fo-  
reign nations fecond the exertions of their own citizens in the branches in which  
they are to be rivalled.  
  
Experience teaches, that men are often fo much governed by what they are ac-  
euftomed to fee and praétice, that the fimpleft and moft obvious improvements,  
in the moft ordinary occupations, are adopted with hefitation, reluétance, and  
by flow gradations. The fpontaneous tranfition to new purfuits, ina commu-  
nity long habituated to different ones, may be expeéted to be attended with  
proportionably greater difficulty. When former occupations ceafed to yield 4

profit adequate to the fubfiftence of their followers, or when there was an abfo-  
lute deficieney of employment in them, owing to the fuperabundance of hands,  
changes would enfue: but thefe changes would be likely to be more tardy  
than might confift with the intereft either of individuals or of the fociety. In many  
cafes they would not happen, while a bare fupport could be enfured by an ade  
herence to ancient courfes ; though a refort to a more profitable employment  
might be praéticable. To produce the defirable changes, as early as may be  
expedient, may therefore require the incitement and patronage of government.  
  
The apprehenfion of failing in new attempts is perhaps a more ferious im  
pediment. There are difpofitions apt to be attraéted by the mere novelty of an  
undertaking ; but thefe are not always thole beft caiculated to give it iucce(s,  
To this, it is of importance that the confidence of cautious, fagacious capital-  
ifts, both citizens and foreigners thould be excited. And to inipire this deicrip-  
t.on of perfons with confidence, it is effential that they fhould be made to fee in  
any projeé&amp;t, which is new, and for that reafon alone, if for no other, precarious,  
the profpeét of fuch adegree of countenance and iupport from government, ag  
may be capable of overcoming the obftacles, infeparable fiom firl experi.  
ments.  
  
The fuperiority antecedently enjoyed by nations, who have pre-occupied and  
perfected a branch of induftry, conttitutes a more formidable obftacle, than ei-  
ther of thofe, which have been mentioned, to the introduction of the fame  
branch into a country, in which it did not before exift. To maintain, between  
the recent eftablifhments of one country and the long-matured eftablifhments of  
another country, a competition upon equal terms, both as to quality and price,  
is, in moft cafes, impracticable. The difparity, in the one, or in the other, or  
in both, muft neceffarily be fo confiderable, as to forbid a fuccefsful rivalthip,  
without the extraordinary aid and protection of government.  
  
But the greateft obftacle of allto the fuccefsful profecution of a new  
branch of infuftry, in a country, in which it was before unknown, confifts,  
as far as the initances apply, in the bountics, premiums, and other aids, which  
are granted, in a variety of cafes, by the nations in which the eitablilhments to  
be imitated, are previoufly introduced. It is well known (and particular exanre  
ples in the courte of this report will be cited) that certain nations grant boun-  
ties on the exportation of particular commodities, to enable their own workmen  
to underfell and fupplant all competitors, ia the countries to which thole come  
modities are fent. Hence the undertakers of a new manufacture have to contend  
not only with the natural difadvantages of a new undertaking, but with the  
gratuities and remunerations which other governments befttow. ‘To be enabled  
to contend with fuccefs, it is evident, that the interference and aid of their own  
government are indi{peniable.  
  
Combinations by thofe engaged in a particular branch of bufinels, in one  
country, to fruftrate the firft efforts to introduce it into another, by teinporary  
facrifices, recompenled perhaps by extraordinary indemmnifications of the go-  
vernment of fuch country, are believed to have exited, and are not to be regard-  
ed as deftitute of probability. The exiftence or affurance of aid from the go  
vernment of the country, in which the bufineis is to be introduced, may be ef.  
fential to fortify adventurers againit the dread of fuch combinations—to defeat  
their eff2cts, if formed, and to prevent ther being formed, by demontti ating that  
they muftin theend prove fruitiels.  
  
Whatever room there may be for an expeStation that the induftry of a people,  
under the direction of priyate intereft, will, upon equal terms, find out the wolt  
beneficial employment tor ifelf, there is none for a reliance, that it wil] ftruge&#x27;e  
againtt the force of unequal terms, or will, of itfelf, furmount all the advenit&#x27;i-

the advantages naturally acquired from praétice and previous poffeffion of the  
ground, or by thofe whieh may have fprung from pofitive regulations and an are  
tificial policy. This general reflexion might alone tufiice as an anfwer to the  
objection under examsnation ; exciufively of the weighty confiderations which  
have been particularly urged.  
  
The obje&amp;tions to the purfuit of manufa&amp;tures in the united ftates,  
which next prefent themfelves to difcuffion, reprefent an impracticability of fuc-  
eefs, arifing from three caufes—icarcity of hands, dearneis of labour, want of  
capital.  
  
The two firft circumf# ances are, to a certain extent, real, and, within due li-  
mits, ought to be adn..tted as obttacles to the fuccefs of manufacturing enter-  
prife in the united ftates. But there are various confiderations, which leflen their  
force, and tend to afford an aflurance, that they are not fufficient to prevent the  
advantageous profecution of many very ulsful and extenfive manufactories.  
  
With regard to the {carcity of hands, the fact isfelf mutt be applied, with no  
fmall qualification, to certain parts of the united ftates. Th: re are large diftri&amp;s,  
which may be confidered as pretty fully peopled ; and which, notwit ftanding a  
continual drain for diftant fettlement, are thickly inter{perfed with flourifhing  
and increafing towns. It thefe diftrifts have not already reached the point, at  
which the complaint of fcarcity of hands ceafes, t!ey are not remote from it,  
and are approaching fatt towards it: and having peibaps fewer attractions to  
agriculture, than fome other parts of the union, they exhibit a proportionably  
ftronger tendency towards other kinds of induftry. In thefe diftriéts, may be  
difcerned, no inconfiderable maturity for manufacturing eftablifhments.  
  
But there are circumftances, which have been already noticed with another  
view, that materially dithinifh every wheve the effe&amp;t of a fcarcity of hands.  
Thefe circumftances are—the great ufe which can be made of women and chil-  
dren ; on which point a very pregnant and inftructive fact has been mentioned ;  
the vaft extenfion given by late improvements to the employment of machines,  
which, fubfticuting the agency of fire and water, has prodigioufly leffened the  
neceflity for manual !abour—the employment of perfons ordinarily engaged in  
other occupations, during the feafons, or hours of leijure—which, befides giv-  
ing cecafion to the exertion of a greater quantity of libour ‘by the fame num.  
ber of perfons, and thereby increafing the general ftock of labour, as has been  
eliewhere remarked, may alfo be taken into the calculation, as a refource for ob-  
viating the {carcity of hands—laftly, the attraction of forcign emigrants. Who-  
ever infpects with a careful eye, the compofition of our towns, will be made  
fenfible to what an extent this refource may be relied upon. This exhibits a  
large proportion of ingenious and valuable workmen, in different arts and  
trades, who, by expatriating from Europe, have improved their ewn condition,  
and added to the induftry and wealth of the united ftates. Iris a natural infe-  
rence from the experience, we have already had, that as foon as the united ftates  
fall prefent the counterance of a ferious profecution of manufactures, as foon  
as foreign artifts thall be made fenfible that the flate of things here affords a  
moral certainty of employment and encouragement, competent numbers of Eu-  
ropean workmen will tranfplant themielves, eff-ctualiy to infure the fuccels of  
the defion. How indeed can it otherwife happen, confidering the various and  
powerful inducements, which the fituation of this country offers, addrefling  
themfelves to fo many ftrong patlions and feelings, to fo many general and par-  
ticular interefis ?  
  
It may be e“irmed, therefore, in refpect to hands for carrying on manufac-  
tures, that we fhall in a great meafure trade upon a foreign ftock ; referving  
eur own for the cultivation of our lands, and the manning of our thips, as far

as character and circumftances fhall incline. It is not unwoithy of remark, that  
the objection to the fuccefs of manufacturgs, devuced from the icarcity ot hands,  
is alike applicable to trade and navigation; and yet thefe are perceived vo flou-  
rifh, without any fenfible impediment trom that caufe.  
  
As to the dearnefs of labour (another of the obitscles alleged) this has re-  
lation principally to two circumftances ; one, that which has been jult difcufled,  
or the fearcity of hands; the other, the greatnefs of profits.  
  
As far as it is a confequence of the fcarcity of hands, it is mitigated by all  
the confiderations which have been adduced as leffening that deficiency. It is  
certain, too, that the difparity in this refpect, between fome of the moft manu-  
facturing parts of Europe anda large proportion of the united (lates, is not nearly  
fo great as is commonly imagined, It is alfo much lefs in regard to artificers  
and manufactures

du&amp;tion of thofe materials. It ought not to efcape obfervation, in a comparifon  
on this point, that fome of the princ:pal manufa&amp;turing countries of Europe are  
much more dependent on foreign fupply*for the materials of their manufaétures,  
than would be the united ftates, who are eapable of fupplying themfelves with a  
greater abundance, as weil as a greater variety of the requifite materials.  
  
As to the fecond item, the expenfe of grounds, buildings, machinery and  
tools, an equality at leaft may be aflumed ; fince advantages in (ame particulars  
will counterbalance temporary difadvantages in others,  
  
As to the third item, or the article of wages, the comparifon certainly  
turns againft the united ftates ; though, as before obferved, not in fo great a de-  
gree as is commonly {uppofed.  
  
The fourth item is alike applicable té the foreign and to the domeftic manu-  
fa€ture. It is indeed mere properly a refuit than a particular, to be compared.  
  
But with refpeé to all the remaining items, they are alone applicable to the  
foreign manufagture, and in the ftri€teft fenfe extraordinaries ; conftituting  
a fum of extra charge on the foreign fabric, which cannot be eftimated at lefs  
than from fifteen to thirty per cent. on the coft of it at the manufaétory.  
  
This fum of extra charge may be confidently regarded as more than a counter-  
poife for the real difference in the price of labour ; and it is a fatisfactory  
proof that manufactures may profper in defiance of it in the united ftates,  
  
To te general allegation, connected with the circumftances of fcarcity of  
hands and dearnefs of labour, that extenfive manufactures can only grow out  
of a redundant or full population, it will be fufficient, to anfwer generally,  
that the fact has been otherwife. That the fituation, alleged to be an effential  
condition of fuccefs, has not been that of feveral nations, at periods when they  
had already attained to maturity in a variety of manufactures,  
  
The fuppofed want of capital for the profecution of manufactures in the,  
united ftates, is the moft indefinite of the objections which are ufually oppofed  
to it,  
  
It is very difficult to pronounce any thing precife concerning the real extent  
of the monied capital of a country, and ftill more concerning the proportion  
which it bears to the objects that invite the employment of capital. It is not  
lefs difficult to pronounce how far the effect of any given quantity of mency,  
as capital, or, in other words, as a medium for circulating the induftry and pro-  
perty of a nation, may be increafed by the very circumitance of the additional  
motion, which is given toit by new objectsof employment. That effect, like  
the momentum of defcending bodies, may not improperly be reprefented, as  
in a compound ratio to mafs and velocity. It fcems pretty certain, that a given  
fum of money, in a fituation, in which the quick impulfes of commercial acti-  
vity were little felt, would appear inadequ:te to the circulation of as great a  
quantity of induitry and property, as in one, in which their full influence was  
expe: ienced,  
  
It is not obvious, why the fame objection might not as well be made to exter.  
nal commerce as te manufactures ; fince it is manifeft that our immenfe tracts  
of land, occupied, and unoccupied, are capable of giving employment to more.  
capital than is actuilly beftowed upon them, It is certain, that the united fates  
offer a vaft fidli for the advantigeous employment of capi:al, but ® does not  
follow, that there will not be found, in one way or another, a fufficient fund,  
for the fuccefsful profecution of any {pecies of indufliy which is likely to prove  
truly beneficial. &quot;  
  
The following confilerations are of a nature to remove all inquietule on  
the fcore of want of capital.  
  
The introduction of banks, as has been fhown on another occafion, has a,  
  
powerful tendency toextend the active capital of a country. Experience of the  
uiility of thefe infitutions is multiplying them in th: waited flates. It is

probable that they will be eftablithed wherever they can exift with advantage ;  
and wherever they can be fupported, if adiminiftered with prudence, they will  
add new new energies to ail pecuniary operations.  
  
The aid of foreign capital may fafely, and with confiderable latitude, be taken  
into calculation. Its inftrumentality has been long experienced in our external  
commerce ; and it has begun ts be felt in various other modes. Not only our  
funds but our agriculture and other internal improvements have been anie  
mated by it. It has already, in a few inftances, extendei even to our manu-  
factures.  
  
It is awell known fact, that there are parts of Europe, which have more ca.  
pital, than profitable domettic objects of enploynent. Hence, among other  
proofs, the large loans continually furnifhed to foreign ftates. Ani it is equally  
certain, that the capital of other parts may find more profitable employment in  
the unite! flates,than at home. And no&#x27;w thitanding thee are weighty in.  
ducements to prefer the employment of capitai at home, even at le‘s profit, to an  
inveftment of it abroad, though with greater gain, yet thefe inducements are  
over-ruled, either by adeficiency of employment, or by a very material diff-r-  
ence in profit. Both thefe caules operate to produce a transfer of foreign capital  
to the united ftates. &quot;Tis certain, that various obieéts in this country hold out  
advantages, which are with difficulty to be equalied elfewh re; and under the  
increafingly favourable impreffions, which are entertained of our government,  
the attractions will become more and more trong. Thele impreflions will prove  
a rich mine of profperity to the country, if they are confirined and ftrengthen-  
ed by the progrefs of our affairs. And to fecure this advantage, little more is  
neceflary, than to fofter induitry, and to cultivate order and tranquiilty, at home  
and abroad.  
  
It is not impoffible, that there may be perfons difpofed to look with a jealous  
eye on the introduction of forgign capital, as if it were an inftrument to deprive  
our own citizens of the profit} of our own indultry : but perhaps there never  
could be a more free oan Bs jealoufy. Inftead of being viewed asa rival, it  
ousht to be confidered as a moft valuable auxiliary ; conducing to put in mo.  
tion a greater quantity of produétive labour, and a greater portion of ufeful en-  
terprife, than could exift without it. It is at leaft evident, that in a country fi-  
tuated like the united ftates, with an infinite fund of retources, yet to be un  
folded, every farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in internal ameiioia-  
tions, and in indultrious eftablifhinents of a permanent nature, is a precious  
acquifition, ,  
  
And whatever be the obje&amp;s which originally attra&amp; foreign capital, when  
once introduced, it may be dire&amp;ted towards any purpofe of benctic al exer-  
tion, whichis defired. And to detain it among us, there can be no expedient fo  
effeStual as -to-enlarge the {phere, within which it may be ulctully employed ;  
though introduced merely with views to fpecuiations in the funds, it may after.  
wards be render fubfervient to the intereits of agriculture, commerce, and ma-  
nufactures.  
  
But the attra&amp;tion of foreign capital for the direct purpofe of manufa&amp;ures  
ought not to be deemed a climerical expeétation. Theve are already examples of  
it, as remarked in another place. And the examples, if the difpofition be cultivat.  
ed, can hardly fail to multiply. There are aifo initances of another kind, which  
ferve to ftrengthen the expectation ; enterprifes for improving the public com-  
munications, by cutting canals, opening the obftructions in rivers, and erecting  
bridges, have received very material aid frem the fame fource.  
  
When the manufacturing capitalitt of Europe fhall advert to the many ims  
Reade advantages, which have been intimated, in the courfe of this report, he  
  
inot but perceive very powerful inducements to a transter of hunfelf and his

eapital to the united ftites. Among the reflexions, which a mof interefting pe-  
culiarity of fituation is caculated to fuggelt, it cannot efcape his obfervation,  
as a circumftance of moment in the calculation, that the progreflive population  
and improvement of the uniced ftates, enfure a continually encreafing domeftic  
demand for the fabrics which he hall produce, not to be affe&amp;ted by any external  
eafualties or viciffitudes.  
  
But while there are cireumftances fufficiently ftrong to authorife a confidera-  
ble degree of reliance on the aid of foreign capital, towards the attainment of  
the ebjeét in view, it is fatisfa€tory to have good grounds of affurance, that there  
are domettic refou cs of theméelves adequate to it. It huppens, that there is a  
{pectes of capital, aétually exifting within the united ftates, which relieves  
from all inquietude on the fcore of want of capital. This is the funded  
deht.—  
  
The effe&amp; of a funded debt, as a fpecies of capital, has been noticed upon a  
former occafion ; but a more particular elucidation of the point feems to be re-  
quired by the ftiefs which is here laid upon its this fhall accordingly be at-  
tempted.  
  
Public funds anfwer the purpofe of capital, from the eftimation in  
which they are ufually held by monied men; and confequently from  
the eafe and difpatch with which they can be turned into money. This capacity  
of prompt convertibility into money caufes a transter of ttock to be in a great  
number of cafes equivalent toa payment in coin—and where it does not happen  
to fuit the party who is to receive, to accepta transfer of ftock, the party who  
is to pay, is never at a Jofs to find elfewhere a purchafer of lis ftock, who will  
furnith him in jjeu of it, with the coin of which he ftands in need.  
  
Hence, in a found and fetiled flate of the public funds, a man poffeffed of a  
fum in them can embrace any fcheme of bufinefs, which offers, with as much  
confidence as if he were poffeffed of an equal fum in coin,  
  
This operation of public funds, as capital, is too obvious to he denied: but  
$t is objected to the idea of their operating as an augmentation of the capital of  
the community, that they ferve to occafion the deftrufion of fome other capital  
to an equil ainount.  
  
The capital which alone they can be fuppofed to deftroy, muft confit of —  
the annual :evenue, which ts applied to the payment ef intercft on the debt, and  
to the gradual redemption of the principal—the amount of the coin, which is  
employed in circulating the funds, or, in other words, in effing the different  
alienations which they undergo.  
  
But the following appears to be the true and accurate yiew of this matter—  
  
ift. As to the point of the annual revenue requifite for payment of intereft  
and redemption of principal.  
  
As a determinate proportion will tend to perfpicuity in the reafoning, Jet it be  
fuppofed that the annual revenue to be applied, correfponding with the moli-  
fication of the fix per cent. ftock of the ynjted ftates, is in the ratio of eight  
upon the hundred ; that is, in the firft inftance, fix on account of intereft, and  
two on account ef principal.  
  
Thus far it 1s evident, that the capital deftroyed, to the capital created, would  
bear no greater proportion than eight to one hundred. There would be with-  
drawn from the total mafs of other capitals a fum of eight dollars to be paid to  
the agro creditor ; while he would be poffeffed of 1 fum of one hundred dol-  
Jars, ready to be applied to any purpofe, to be embarked in any enterprie, which  
might appear to him eligibie—heie then the angmentation of capital, or the ex-  
cefs of that which is produced, beyond that which is deftroyed, is equal te  
pinety two dollars.  
  
To this conclufion it may be objected, that the fum of eight dollars is te be

withdrawn annually, until the whole hundred is extinguifhed, and it may be  
inferred, that in procefs of time a capital wiil be deftroyed, equal to that which  
is at firft created.  
  
But it is neverthelefs true, that during the whole of theinterval, between the  
ereation of the capital of one hundred dollars, and i&#x27;s reduction to a fum not  
greater than that of the annual revenue appropriated to its redemption  
there will be a greater a&amp;tive capital in exiftence, thon if no «iebt had been  
contraéted, The fum drawn from other caput-is,in any one yea., will not exs  
ceed eight dollars: but there will be, at every inftant of time during the whole  
period in queftion, a fum correfponding with :o much of the princ.pal, as ree  
mains unredeemed, in the hands of fome perfon or other, employed, or ieady to  
be employed, in fome profitable ‘undertaking, There wiil, theretove, conftantly  
be more capital, in capacity to be employe!, than capital tokea fron employ-  
ment. The excefs, for the firft year, has been tated to be ninety two dollars ; it  
will diminith yearly : but there a&#x27;ways will bean excels, untilthe principal of the  
debt is brought to a level with the redeeming annuity 5 that is,in the cate which has  
been affumed by way of example, to eight doliars. The real ty of this excels  
becomes palpable, it it be fuppofed, as often happens, that the cit.zen of a fo-  
reign country imports into the united flates one huidred dollars ter the pur-  
ehafe of an equal fum of public debt: heie is an abiolute augmentation of the  
mafs of circulating coin te the extent of one hundred dollars. At the end of a  
year, the foreigner is prefumed to draw back etght dollars, on account ef his  
principal and intereft ; but he ftil] Isoves ninery two cf his original depofit in  
circulation, as he in like manner leaves eighty feur, at the eng of the fecond  
year, drawing back then alfo the annuity of cighi dollars : and thus the mat-  
ter proceeds ; the capital left in circulation diminithing each year, and coming  
nearer to the level of the annuity drawn back. There aie, however, feme dii-  
ferences in the ultimate operation of the partof the debt, which 1s purchafed by  
foreigners and that which remains in the hands of citizens. But the general  
effect, in each caie, though in diffcient degrees, is to ald to the aétive capital  
of the country,  
  
Hitherto the reafoning has proceeded on a conceffion of the pofition, that there  
is a deftru&amp;tion of fome other eapital, to the extent of the annuity appropriated  
to the payment of the intereft and the redemption of the principad of the debt:  
but in this, too much has been conceded. There is, at moit, a temporary tranf-  
fer of fome other capital, to the amount of the annuity, trom thofe who pay, to  
the creditor who receives ; which he again reftores to the circulation, to refume  
the offices of a capital. This he does either immediately, by employing the mo-  
ney in fone branch of indcultry, or mediately by lending it to fume other per-  
fon, wko does fo employ it, or by {pending iton bis own maintenance. In either  
fuppofition, there is no deftru€tion of capital: there is nothing more then a fuf-  
penfion of its motion for atime ; that is, while it is paffing from the hands of  
thoie who pay into the public coffers, and thence through the public creditor,  
into fome other channel of circulation. When the payments of intereit are pe-  
riodical and quick, and made by the inftruwnentality of banks, tue diverfion or  
fufpention of capital may almoft be denominated momentary, Hence the deduc-  
tion on this account is far lefs, than it at firtt ight appears to be.  
  
There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity, no deitru€ion nor tiansfer  
of any other capital, than that portion of the income of each individual, which  
goes to make up the annuity. The land, which furnifhes the farmer with the fum  
which he is to contribute, remains the fame; and the like may be obterved of  
other capitals. Indeed, as far as the tax, which is the obje &amp; of contribution (aa  
frequently happens, when it does not opprefs by its weight) may have been a  
metive to a greater emertion in any eccupalion ; it may even Serve to inccage

of the fubje&amp;.  
  
It remains to fee, what further dedu@ion ought to be made from the capital  
which is created, by the exiftence of thedebt, on account of the corn, which is  
employed in its circulation. Phis 1s fulceptible of much icfs precile calculation than  
the article which has been jut difcuffe!. It is impoffivle to fay » hat proportion  
of coin is neceffary to carry on the alienations which any {pecies of property  
wfually undergoes. Tire quantity, indeed, varies according to circumftances,  
Byt it may fill, without hefitation, be pronou:ced, from the quicknets «f the  
rotation, or rather of the tranfitions, that the medium of circuistion always  
bears but a fmall proportion to the amount of the property circulated. And it  
is thence fatisfatorily deducible, that the coin employed in the negociations  
of the funds, and which ferves to give them aétivity, as capital, is incompara-  
bly lefs than the fum cf the debt negociated for the pu: pote of butinefs.  
  
It ought not, however, to be omitted, that the negociation of the funds be.  
womes itfelf a diftinét bufincls ; which employs, and by employing, diverts a  
portion of tle circulating coin fiom other puriuits. But meking due allowance  
for this circumftance, there is no reafon to conclude, that the effe&amp;&amp; of the di-  
verfion of coin in the whole uperation bears any confiderable propo tion to the  
amount cf the capital to which it gives activity. ‘Tlie (um of the debt in circu-  
Jation is eoninually .t the command of any ufeful enterprife, the com itielf  
which circulates it, 1s never more than momentarily (ufpended from its ordinary  
fun&amp;tions. It experiences an inceffant and rapid flux and reflux to and from the  
channel of indultry to thofe of {peculations in the funds.  
  
There are ftrong circumftances in confirmation of this theory, The force of  
monied capite! which has been difplayed in Great Britain, and the height to  
which every fpecies of indultry has grown wp under it, defy a folution from  
the quantity of coin which that kingdom has ever pofleffed. Aceordingly it has  
been, coeval with its funding fyfem, the prevailing opinion of the men of bub-  
nefs, and of the generality of the moit fagacious theoriils of that country, that  
the operation of the public funds as capital has contributed to the effeét in  
queflion. Among ourlelvcs appearances thus far tavour the fame conciufion. In-  
duftry in general feems to have been re-animated, There are fymptoms inmiscate  
ing an extenfion of our commerce.Our navigation has certainly of late had a con-  
fiderable fpring, and there appears to be in many parts «f the union a command  
of capital, which, till lately, fince the revolution at lea, was unknown. But

In the queftion under di‘cuffion, it ts important to diftinguith between an ab-  
folute increate of capital, or an acceffion of real wealth and an artificial increafe  
of capital, as an engine of bufinefs, or as an inttrument of indullry and com-  
merce. Ln the firli forfs, a finded debt has no pretenfions to being deemed  
an inciesfe of capital; im the Is, it has pretentions which are not eafy to be  
controverted. Of a fimilar nature is bank credit, and, in an inferior degree,  
every ipecies of priv te crecit.  
  
But though a tunded debt is not in the fir inftance, an abfolute increafe of  
capital, or an avgmentation of real wealth; yet by ferving as a new power in  
the eperations of uduftry, it has, within cert-in bounds, a tendency to increafe  
the real wealth of a community; in like manner as money borrowed by 4  
thrifty farmer, to be laid out in the improvement of his farm, may, in the end,  
add to his flock of real riches.

no good to alleviate the ili with which they fuppofe it pregnant, who cannot be  
perfuaded, that it ought in any fenfe to be viewed as an incieafe of capital, left  
it thould be inferred, thot the more debt the more capital, the greater the bur-  
dens the greater the bieflings of the community.  
  
But it ioteretts the public councils to eftimate every obje® as it truly is; to  
appreciate how far the good in any meafure is compe: lated ty ihe ul; or the  
ili by the good ; either of them is feldom unmixel,  
  
Neither will  follew, than an acoumulatien of debt is defirabic, becaufe a  
certain deg: ee of it operates as capital, There may be a plethora in the political,  
as in the natural body, there may be a ftate of things in which any (uch arnfi-  
cial capital is unnec Mfiry. The debt too may be fweiled to fuch a fize, as that  
the greatett part of it may ceafe to be ufeful asa capital, ferving only to pame  
per the diflipation of idle and dflolute individuals: es thit the fums ey red  
to pay the untereft upon it may become opprefhive, and beyond the meins which  
a government can employ, copGftently with its tranquility, to raile them ; as  
that the refources of taxation, to face the debt, may have been ftrained tap  
far to admit of extenfions adequate to exigencies, which regard the public  
fafety.  
  
Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced, but it is impofffble te  
believe, that there is not fuch a point.  
  
And as the viciffitudes of nations beget a perpetual tendency to the accumu.  
lation of debt, there ought tobe in every goverament, a perpetual, anxpous, and  
unceafing effort to reduce that which at any time exiils, ap talk as fall be  
pra@icable, confittently with mtegrity aod good faith,

the advantages which the moft manufaétusing ftates appear to have entoyed, over  
the others, fince the termination of the late war.  
  
But the uniform appearance of an abundance ef {p cie, asthe concomitant of a  
fiourithing @ate of manufactures, and of the reverfe, where chey do not prevail,  
afford a firong prefumption of their favourable operation upon the weaith ofa  
country.  
  
Not only the wealth, but the independence and fecurity of a country, appear  
to be materially connected with the pruiperity of manufaciues. Every nauor,  
with a view to thofe great objects, ought to endeavour to poffis withi&gt; inest ali  
  
the eflentials of national iuppiy, Tele comprife the means of fubiitence, halita-  
tion, clothing and defence,  
  
The poffiffion of thefe is neceflary to the perfeciion of the body po.ivic, tothe  
fafety as well as to the weliave of she fociety; the want -f either, 1s the waa! of  
an important organ of political life and motion; and in the various crics which  
await a fiate, it mult feverely feel the efficts of luch deficiency. Toe extreme em-  
barraflments of the united ftates during the late war, fom n incapacity ct lup-  
plying themfelves, are (till matter of keen recollection: a tuture wor might he  
expected again to exempiiy the miichiefs and dangers of a fitwation, to w lich  
that incapacity is flillin too great a cc gree applicable, unlefs changed by tunely  
and vigorous exertions. To effeét this change, as faft as Mali be prudert, merits  
all the attention and all the zeal of our public counc.Js 5 “tis the next great work to  
be accomplithed.  
  
The want of a navy to prote&amp;t curcxternal commerce, as long as it fhall cone  
tinue, muft render it a peculiarly precarious reliance, ior the ia; ply of eflential  
articles, and mufi ferve to ftrengthen prodigioufly the arguments inf.vour ef manu-

To thefe general confiderations are added fome of a more particular nae

are fent, maintain a competition in the fupp&#x27;y of thoir own markets, principally  
fall upon us, and form material deductions from the primitive value of the aiti-  
cles furnifhed. The charges on manutactured fupplies, brought from Europe, are  
gieatly enhanced by the fame ct:cumftance of diftance, Theie charges, again, in

‘g8* Report of the fecretary of the treafury on manufaftures. [1792  
lar competition in refp:&amp; to manufaétured articles, it appears to be clearly de~  
ducible, from tye confiderations which have been mentioned, that they mult  
fultain a double lofs in their exchanges with foreign nations; ftrongly conducive  
to an unfavourable balance of trade, and very prejudicial to their interefts.  
  
Thefe difadvantages prefs with no fmall weight, on the landed intereft of the  
country. In feafons of peace, they caule a ferious deduétion from the intrinfic  
value of the produéts of the foil. In the time of a war, which fhould either in-  
volve ourfelves, or another nation, poffefling a confiderable fhare of our carry-  
ing trade, the charges on the tranfportation of our commodities, bulky as moft  
of them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous burden to the farmer, while  
obliged to depend in fo great degree as he now does, upon foreign markets for the  
vent for the furplus of his labour.  
  
As far as the profperity of the fitheries of the united fates is impeded by the  
want of an adequate market, there agifes ancther {pecial reafon for defiring the  
extenfion of manufaétures. Befides the ffi, which, in many places, would be  
likely to makea part of the fubfiltence of the perfons employed ; it is known,  
thar the oils, bones, and fkins of marine animals, are of extenfive ufe in warious  
manufactures. Hence the profpeét of an additional demand for the produce of the  
fifheries.  
  
One more point of view only remaing, in which to confider the expediency of  
encouraging manufactures in the united ftates.  
  
“It is not uncommon to meet with an opinion, that though the promoting of  
manufagtures, may be the intereit of a partof the union, it is contrary to that  
of another part. The northern and fouthern regions are fometimes reprefented as  
having adverfe interefts in this refpeét. Thofe are called manufacturing, thefe  
agricultural ftates; anda {pecies of oppofition is imagined to fubfift between the  
manutfaéturing and agricultural intereit.  
  
This idea of an oppofition between thofe two interefts is the common error of  
the early periods of every country; but experience gradually diffipates it. In-  
deed they are perceived {0 often to fuccour and to befriend each other, that they  
come at length to be confidered as one: a fuppofition which has been frequently  
abufed, and is uot univerfally true. Particular encouragements of particular  
manufa&amp;ures may be of a nature to facrifice the intereits of landholders to thofe  
of manufagturers: but it is nevecthelels a maxim weli eftablifhed by experience,  
and generally acknowledged where there has been fufficient experience, that the  
$* aggregate” profperity of manufactures, and the “ aggregate” profperity of a-  
griculture are intimately conneéted. In the courfe of the difcuffion which has hod  
  
place, various weighty confiderations have been adduced operating in fupport of .  
  
that maxim. Perhaps the fuperior ffeadinefs of the demand of a domettic market  
for the furplus produce of the foil, is alone a convineing arguinent of its  
truth.  
  
Ideas of a contrariety of interefts between the northern and fouthern regi.  
ons of the union, are in the main as unfounded as they are mifchievous. The  
diverfity of circumftances, on which fuch contrariety is ulually predicated, au-  
thorifes a directly contrary conclufion. Mutual wants conttitute one of the  
ftrongelt links of political connexion: and the extent of theie bears a natural  
proportion to the diverfity in the means of mutual fupply.  
  
Suggeftions of an oppofite complexion are ever to be deplored, as unfriendly  
to the fteady purfuit of one great common caufe, and to the perfect harmony of  
al] the parts.  
  
In proportion as the miud is accuftomed totrace the intimate connexion of  
intereft, which fubfits between all the parts of a fociety, united under the fame  
government—the infinite variety of channels which ferve to circulate the prof-  
perity of each to aad through the reft—sn that proportion it will be little apt

to be difturbed by folicitudes and apprehenfions, which originate in logal dif-  
criminations. It is atruth as important as it is agreeable, and one to which it  
is not ealy to imagine exceptions, that every thing. tending to eftablith fubitan-  
tial and permanent order, in the affairs of a country, to increafe the total  
mafs of induftry and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to every part of it. Oa  
  
the credit of this great truth, an acquicfeence may fately be secorded, from every  
  
quarter, to all inttitutions, and arrangements, which promile a confirmation of  
  
public order, and an augmentation of national refource.  
  
But there are more particular confiderations which ferve to fortify the idea,  
that the encouragement of manufactures is the intercit oi all parts of the u-  
nion. If the northern and middle ftates fhould be the principal icenes of fuch  
eftablifhments, taey would immediately benefit the more fouthern, by creating  
a demand for produétions, fome of which they have in common with the  
other ftates, and others of which are either peculiar to them, or more aband.  
ant, or of better quality, than elfewhere. Thee productions, principally, are  
timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw filk, indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides,  
fkins and coals ; of thefe articles, cetton and indigo are peculiar to the fou-  
thern flates ; as are, hitherto, lead and coal; flax and hemp are or may be  
raifed in greater abundance there, than in the more northern ftates ; anc the  
wool of Virginia is faid to be of better quality than that of any other ‘trte: a  
circumftance rendered the more probable by the reflexion, that Virginia em.  
braces the fame latitudes with the finett wool countries of Europe. Tne climate  
of the fouth is alfo better adapted to the production of fiik.  
  
The extenfive cultivation of cotton can perhaps hardly be expeéted, but from  
the previous eftablifhment of domettic manufaétories of the arricle ; and the fue  
reft encouragement and vent, for the others, would refult from fiiiiar eitabiifh-  
ments in re{peét to them.  
  
If, then, it fatisfaftorily appears, that it is the intereftof the united ftates,  
generaliy, to encourage manufaStures, it merits particular attention, that there  
are circumftances which render the prefent a critical moment for entering with  
zeal upon the important bufinefs. The effort cannot fail to be materially fe.  
conded by a confiderable and increafing influx of money, in confequeuce of fo-  
reign fpeculations in the funds, and by the diforders which exilt in different  
parts of Europe.  
  
The firft circumétance not only facilitates the execution of manufaturing en-  
terprifes ; butit indicates them as a neceflary mean to turn the thing itfelr 10  
advantage, and to prevent its being eventually an evil. If ufeful employmenr  
be not found for the money of foreigners, brought to the country to be inveit-  
ed in purchales of the public debt, it will quickly be re-exported to defray the  
expenfe of an extraordinary confumption of foreign luxuries ; and dillveiling  
drains of our fpecie may hereafter be experienced, to pay the intereft and redeem  
the principal of the purchafed debr.  
  
This ufeful employment, too, ought to be of a nature to produce folid and  
permanent improvements. If the money merely ferves to give a temporary  
fpring to foreign commerce—as it cannot procure new and lafting outlets for  
the produéts of the country—there will be no real or durable advantage gain-  
ed. As far as it fhall find its way in agricultural ameliorations, in opening  
canals, and in fimilar improveutents, it will be productive of fubttantial unility.  
  
Sut there is reafon to doubt, whether in fuch channels it is likely to find fuffici-  
ent employment, and fill more, whether many of thofe who poffels it, would  
be as readily attracted to objects of this nature, as to manutaéturing purfuits ;  
which bear greater analogy to thofe to which they are accuftomed, and to tic  
fpivit generated by them.

may be anincrecfocf tie number ana extent of valuable acquilitions td the po-  
pul tion, a ts, and indultry of the country.  
  
To find pleafure in the calamities of other nations would be criminal : but to  
hewcfitouveives, by opening an alyium to thofe who fuffer, in confequence of  
them, ts as jultihable as itis politic.  
  
A tull view having, now been taken of the inducements to the promotion of  
manufactures in the urited ftates, accompanied with sn examination of the  
piincipa: obi étions which are commonly urged in oppofition, it is proper, on the  
next piace, to confider the means by which it may be cffeéted, as introdudtory  
to a Specification of the obje&amp;ts which, in the prefent ftate of things, appear  
  
he mof fit to be encouraged, and ef the particular meafures which it may be  
advilable to adopt, in refpe&amp; toeach.  
  
In order to a better jadgment of the means proper to be reforted to by the  
uniied ftates, it will be of ue to advert to trol which have been employed with  
fuccels in other countres. The principal of thete are—  
  
I. Proteéting du&#x27;ies—or duties on thefe foreign articles which are the rivals  
of the dometlic ones intended to be encouraged.  
  
Duties of this nature evidently amount ta a virtual bounty on the domeftic  
fabrics, ince, by enhancing the charges on foreign articles, they enable the  
national manufaéturers to underiell ali their furcagn ¢ mpetitors. The propriety  
of this {peci-s of encouragement need not to be dwelt upon; as if 1s not aly a  
clear vefuit frou the numerous topics whch hive been tupgetted, but is fanc.  
tioned by the lows of the united fates, in av rety of iuitances: it has the  
additional recommendation of being a refource of revenue. Indeed ail the du-  
ties impoled on inported articies, though with an exciufive view to revenue,  
have the effeéi in contemplation, and, except where they fall on raw materials,  
wear a beneficent afpeét tonards the manufa€tures of the country,  
  
VI. Prohibitions of rival articles, or duties equivalent to prohibitions,  
  
Tbrs is another and an efficacious mean of eocouraging national manufac-  
tures: but in general itis only fit to be employed when a manufacture has  
made fuch a progre!s, ang is in fo many hands, as to imiure a due competi-  
tios, and an atequate fupply, en resionable terins. Of duties equivalent to  
promotions, there ore ex unples m the laws of the united Mates, and there are o-  
ther cales, to which the principle may be advantageoufly extended: but they are  
hot Mwcrous,  
  
Contidering a monopely of the domeftic market to its own manufacturers  
as the reigning poucy of manufagiuring nations, a fimilar policy, on the part  
of toe united flates, in every proper inftance, is dictated, it might almoft be  
faid, by the panciples of diftributive juttice ; certainly by the duty of endea-  
Vourlag to tocure totheir own citizens a reciprocity of advantages.  
  
Hii. Prohibitions of the exportation of the materials of manu&#x27;a&amp;ures,

lation. It oyght not to be affirmed, that it is in no inftance proper ; but itis cer-  
tainly one which ought to be adopted with great circum!pedti n, and only in  
very plain cafes. It us feen at once, that itsamimediate operation is to abriy  
the demand and keep down the price of the produce of fome other branch of  
induftry, generally fpexking, of agriculture, to the prejudice of thole «h  
ry iton; and though, if it be really eflential to the pro!perity of any very  
portant national manutature, it may happen that thole who are ijured  
firft inftance, may be eventually indemnified, by the {uperior tte  
an extenfive domettic market depending on that profperity : yet in a  
in which there is fo much room for nice and dificult combinations, in  
fuch oppofite confiderstions combat e.ch other, prucence feems to dictate, that  
the expe tient in queftion, ought to be indulged with a {paring hand.  
  
IV. Pecuniary bounties.  
  
This has been found one of the moft efficacious means of encouraging  
nufa&amp;tures, and it is, in fome views, the belt. Though it

what can be afforded to be given for it, by the conductor of an mfant manufac.  
ture, itis abandoned or fails ; apd there being no domeftic manufactories to  
create a deiiand for the vay material, which is raifed by the farmer, itis in vain,  
that the compefition ot ‘he like foreign article, may have been deftroyed,  
  
It cannot efcape notice, that a duty upon the importation of an article can ne  
otherwile aid the dome ic produgion of it, than by giving the latter greater ad -  
vantages inthe home marxet, It can have no influence upon the advantageous  
fale of the aiticle produced, in toreiga maikets ; no tendency, therefore, to pro-  
Moie iis exportation.  
  
The true way to concil:ate thefe two interefts is tolay a duty on foreign manu-  
faGtures of the material, the growth of which is defired te be encouraged, and to  
apply the produce of that duty by way of bounty, either upon the produétion  
of the material itfelf, or upon its manufa&amp;ture at home, or upon both. In this  
difpofition of the thing, Cie manufacturer commences his enterprife, under every  
advantage, which is a:tainable as to quantity or price of the raw material: and  
the farmer, if the ounty be immediately given to him, is enabled by it to enter  
into a fuccefsful comperition with the foreign material; if the bounty be to the  
manufaéturer on fo much of the domeftic material as he confumes, the operation  
is nearly the fame; he has a motive of intereit to prefer the domeftic commodity,  
if of equal quality, even at a higher price than the foreign, folong as the dif-  
ference of price is any thing fhort of the bounty, which is allowed upon the are  
ticle,  
  
Except the fimple and ordinary kinds of houfehold manufature, or thofe for  
which there are very commanding local advantages, pecuniary bounties are in moft  
cafes indifpenfable to the introduétion ef anew branch. A ftimulus and a fup-  
port not lefs powerful and direét is, generally fpeaking, eflential to the over.  
coming of the obftacles which arife from the competitions of fuperior fkill and  
maturity elfewhere. Bounties are efpecially eflential, in regard to articles, upon  
which thofe foreigners who have been accuftomed to fupply a country, are in the  
practice of granting them.  
  
The continuance of bounties on manufactures long eftablifhed, muft almoft  
always be of queftionable policy : becaufe a prefumption would arife in every  
fuch cafe, that there were natural and inherent impediments to fuccefs. But in  
new undertakings, they are as jultifiable, as they ave oftentimes neceflary,  
  
There isa degree of prejudice againft bounties, from an appearance of giving  
away the public money, without an immediate confideration, and from a fuppo-  
fition, that they ferve to enrich particular claffes, at the expenfe of the commu-  
nity.  
  
But neither of thefe fources of diflike will beara fcrious examination. There is  
no purpole to which public money can be morg beneficially applied, than to the  
acquifition of a new and ufeful branch of induftry ; no confileration more valua-  
ble than a permanent addition to the general ftock of produétive labour.  
  
As to the fecond fource of olje&amp;tion, it equaily lies againft other modes of  
encouragement which are adimitted to be eligible. As often asa duty upon a fo-  
reign article makes an adcition to its price, it caufes an extra expente tothe  
eommunity, for the benefit of the domeftic manufacturer. A bounty does no  
more. But itis the inverett of the fociety, in each cafe, to fubmit to a tempora-  
ry expenfe, which is more than compenfated, by an increafe of induftry and  
wealth—by an augmentation of refources and independence—and by the circum-  
ftance of eventual cheapnefs, which has been neticed in another place.  
  
It would de.erve attention, however, in the employment of this {pecies of en-  
eouragement in the united ftates, as a reafon for moderating the degree of it in  
the inflances in wiich it might be deemed eligible, that the great diftance of this  
sountiy from Eusope impoles very heavy charges on all the fabrics which are

brought from thenee, amounting from 15 to 30 per cent, on their value, accord-  
ing to their bulk. ; acess ;  
  
A queftion has been mace, concerning the conftitutional right of the govern~  
ment of the united ftates to apply this {pecies of encouragement: but there is  
certainly no good foundation for fuch a queition, ‘The national legiflature has  
exprefs authority ‘* to lay and colleét taxes, duties, impofts, and excifes, to  
pay the debts and provide fosghe common defence and general welfare,” with  
no other qualifications than that ‘¢ all duties, impofts, and excifes, fhall be uni-  
form throughout the united ftates; that no capitation or other direct tax fhall be  
laid, unlefs in proportion to numbers afcertained by a cenfus or enumeration ta-  
ken on the principles prefcribed in the conftitution ; and that ne tax or duty fhall  
be laid on articles exported from ‘any ftate.”  
  
Thefe three qualifications excepted, the power to rafe money is plenary and  
indefinite; and the objeéts, to which it may be appropriated, are no lefs eom-  
prehenfive than the payment of the public debts and the providing for the common  
defence and general welfare. The terms “‘ general welfare’’ were doubtle!s intend -  
ed to fignify more than was expreffed or imported in thefe which preceded ; other-  
wife, wumerous exigencies, incident to the affairs of a nation,would have been left  
without a provifion.—The phrafe is as comprehenfive as any that could have been  
ufed ; becaufe it was not fit that the conftitutional authcrity of the union, to appro-~  
priate its revenues, fhould have been reftiicted within narrewer limits than the  
«* general welfare ;° and becaufe this neceflarily em! races a valt variety of parti«  
culars which are fulceptible neither of {pecification no: of definition,  
  
It is therefore of neceflity left to the difcretion of the national legiflature, to pro-  
nounce, upon the objects, which concern the general welfare, and for which,  
under that defcription, an appropriation of money is requifite and proper, And  
there feems to be no room for a doubt,that whatever concerns the general interefts  
of learning, of agriculture, of manufactures, and of commerce, are within the  
fphere of the national councils, as far as regards an application of money,  
  
The only qualification of the generality of the phrafe in queftion, which feems  
tobe admiffible, is this—that the object, to which an appropriation of money  
is to be made, be general and not local; its operation, extending in f2é,  
or by poffibility, throughout the union, and not being coufined to a particular  
fpor.  
  
No obje&amp;tion ought to arife to this conftruftion, from a fuppcfiticn that  
it would imply a power to do whatever elfe fhould appear to congre/s condue  
cive to the general welfare. A power to appropriate money, with this latitude,  
which is granted too in expiefs terms, would not carry a powcr to do any other  
thing, not authorifed in the conftitution, either exprefsly or by fair implica.  
tion.  
  
V. Premiums.  
  
Thefe are of a nature allied to bounties, though diftinguifhable from them in  
fome important features,  
  
Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article produced or mas  
nufagtured, or exported, and involve a ccrrefpondent expenfe ; premiums ferve  
to reward fome particular excellence or {uperiority, fome extraordinary exertion  
  
or fkill, and are difpenfed only in a fmall number of cafes. But their effeétas to  
flimulate general effort: contrived fo as to be both honorary and ucrative, they  
acdrefs themfelves to different paffions ; touching the chords as well of emula-  
tion as of intereft. They are accordir gly a very econcmical mean of exciting the  
epterpriie of a whole community.  
  
There are various focieties in different countrics, whofe objet is the difpenfa-  
tion of premiums for the encouragement of agriculture, arts, manufactures, and  
Commerce : and though they are, for the&#x27;moft part, Voluntary affociations, with

ity of the national government to the  
good, which might be done, is not without a queftion, Many aids might be  
given to induflry—many internal improvements of primary magnitude might  
be promoted, by an authority operating throughout the unjon, whichcannot  
be effected, as well, if at all, by gn authority confined within the limits of a  
fingle ftate.  
  
But if the legiflature of the union eqnmot do all the good that might be  
wifhed, it is at leaft defrable, that all may be done which is praéticable.  
Means for promotirg the introduction of foreign improvements, though Iris  
efficacioufly than might be accomplifhed with more atequate autherity, will  
form a part of the plan intended to be futmitted in the clote of this report.  
  
J: iscuftomary with manufacturing nations to prohibit, under fevere pe-  
malities, the exportation of implements and machines, whch they have either  
mvented or improved. There are already objeé&amp;s for a fimilar regulaiion in the  
onited ftates; and others may he expefted to occur from time to ume. The  
adoption of it feems to be digtated by the principle of reciprocity, Greater li-  
berality, in fuch refpe&amp;ts, might better comport with the general fpirit of the  
country ; but a felfith and exclufive policy in othe: quarters will not always pers  
mit the tice indulgence of a fpirit, which woult piace us woon ar unequal foot-  
ing. As far as prohibitions tend to prevent foreign competitors trom deiiving the  
benefit of the improvements made athom~, they tend to increaie the adyantages  
of thole by whom they may have Leen introduce. ; aud operate as an encourage-  
ment te exertion.  
  
IX. Judicivus regulations for the infpection of manuf .€tured commodities.  
  
This is not among the leaft important of the means, by which the pl oiperity  
of manufaétures may be promote. I is indeed in many caf-s one ot the moft  
effential. Contributing to prevent frauds ujon corfymers at home, and export-  
ers to foreign countrices—to improve the quality and p eterve the ¢haraéter of  
the national manafaftures, it cannot fail to aid the «xpeditious and advanta.  
geo s faje of them, and to ferve as a guard againit fuccelsful co petition from  
other quarters. The reputation of the flour and Jymberot fome ttates, and of  
the potath of others, has been eftablifhed by =n attention to this point. And

united ftates. A likefyftem might alfo be extended with advantage to other com-  
modities.  
  
X. The facilitating of pecuniary remittances from place to place—  
  
Is a peint of confiderable moment to trade in general, apd to manufaétures  
in particular; by rendering more eafy the purchafe of raw materials and pro-  
vifions, and the payment for manufactured fupplies: A general circulation of  
bank paper, which is to be expeéted from the inftitution lately eftablithed, will  
be a moft valuable mean to this end. But much good would alfo accrue from  
fome additional provifions refpeciing inland bills of exchange. If thofe drawn  
in one ftate payable in another, were made negociable, every where, and intercft  
and damages allowed in cafe of proteft, it would greatly promote negociations  
between the citizens of different ftates, by rendering them more fecure; and,  
with it, the convenience and advantage of the merchants and manufacturers of  
each,  
  
XI. The facilitating of the tranfportation of commodities.  
  
Improvements fayouring this objec intimately concern all the domettic inter-  
efts of a community : but they may without impropriety be mentioned as hav.  
ing an important relation to manvfaures. There is perhaps fcarcely any  
thing, which has been better calculated to affitt the manufaé&amp;tures of Great  
Britain, than the amelioration of the public roads of thatkingdom, and the great  
progrefs which has been of late made in opening canals. Of the former, the united  
ftates ftand much in need ; for the latte: they prefent uncommon facilities.  
  
The fymptoms of attention to the iniprovemcnt of inland navigation, which  
have lately appeared in fome quarters, muft fill with pleafure every breaft  
warmed with atrue zeal for the profperity of the country. Thefe examples, it  
is to be hoped, will ftimulate the excrtions of the government and citizens of  
every ftate. There cancertainly be no cbje&amp; more worthy of the cares of the  
Jocal adminiftrations ; and it were to be withed, that there was ne doubt of  
the power of the national government to Jend its direét aid on a comprehen.  
five plan. This is one of thofe improvements, which could be profecuted with  
more efficacy by the whole, than by any part or parts of the urion. There  
are cafes in which the general intereft will be in danger to be facrificed tothe  
collifion of fome fuppofed local interefts. Jealoufies, in matters of this kind,  
are as apt to exift, as they ave apt to be erroneous.  
  
The following remarks are fufiiciently judicious and pertinent to deferve a  
literal quotation : ** good 10acs, canals, and navigable rivers, by diminifhing  
the expeste of carriage, put the remote parts of a country more nearly upon  
a level with thofe in the neighbourhood of the town, They are, upon that  
account, the greateft of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of  
the remote, which muft always be the moft extenfive circle of the country.  
They are advantageous to the town, by breaking down the monopoly of the  
country in its neighourhood. They are advantageous even to that part of the  
country. ‘Though they introduce fome rival commodities into the old market,  
they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly, befides, is a great  
enemy to good management, which can never be univerfally eftablithed, but  
in confequence of that free and univerfal competition, which forces every body  
to have recourfe to it, for the fake of felf defemce. It is not more than fifty  
years ago that fome of the counties in the neighbourhood of London petitioned  
the parliament, agzinft the extenfion of the turnpike roads, into the remoter  
counties, ‘Thefe remoter counties, they pretended, from the cheapnefs of la-  
bour, would be ableto fell their grafs and corn cheaper in the London mar-  
ket, than themfelves, and they would thereby reduce their rents and ruin  
their cultivation. Their rents, however, have rifen, and their cultivation has  
been improved, fince that tune.”

Specimens of a fpirit, fimilar to that which governed the counties, here fpo-  
ken of, prefent themfelves too frequently to the eye of an i:epartial obferver,  
and render it a with of patriotifm, that the body in this country, in whofe  
councils a local or partial fpirit is leaft likely to predominate, were at liberty to  
puriue and promote the general ‘ntereft, in thefe milancés, in which there m:ght  
be danger of the interference of fuch a fpirit.  
  
The foregoing are the principal of the means, by which the growth of ma.  
nufaétures is ordinarily promoted, It is, however, not mereiy neceilary, that the  
meafures of government, which have a direct view to manufaétures, fhouid be  
calculated to affiit and proteét them ; but that thofe, which only collaterally affect  
them in the general courie ot the adminiftration, fhould be guarded from any  
peculiar tendency to injure them.  
  
There are certain fpeciesof taxes, which are apt to be oppreflive to different  
partsof the community, and, among other ill effects, have avery unfricndly  
afpect towards manufactures. All poli or capitation taxes are of this narure.  
They either proceed according to a fixed rate which operates unequally, and  
injurioufly to the indultrious poor; or they veit a difcretion in cert®.n officers,  
to make eftimates and affeflments, which are néceffarily vague, and conjefural,  
and liable to abuie. They ought, therefore, to be abfiained trom, in ali but cafes  
of diflreffing emergency.  
  
All fuch taxes (including all taxes on occupations) which proceed accord.  
ing to the amount cf capital fuppofed to be employed in a bufineis, or of pro-  
fits fuppofed to be made in it, are unavoidably hurtful to induftry. It is in  
vain that the evil may be endeavoured to be mitigated by leaving it, in the fird  
inftance, in the option of the party to be taxed, to declare the amount of his cas

nd to raife its reputation in foreign markets. There  
are, however, confiderations which ftand in the way of fuch an arrangement.  
  
Ardent fpirits and malt liquors are, next to flour, the two principal manufac-  
tures of grain, The firft has made a very extenfive, the laft a econfiderable pro-  
grefs in the united Rates. In refpect to both, an exclufive poffeffion of the  
home market eught to be fecured to the domettic manufacturers, as faft as  
circumftances will admit. Nothing is more practicable, and nothing more de-  
firable.  
  
The exifting laws of the united ftates have done much towards attaining this  
valuable object: but fume additions to the prefent duties, on foreign diftilled  
fpirits, and foreign malt liquors, and perhaps an abatement of thofe on home  
made fpirits, would more effectually fecure it; and there does not occur any very  
weighty objection to either.  
  
An augmentation of the duties on imported fpirits would favour aswell the  
diftillation of fpirits from melaffes, as that from grain. And to fecure to the  
nation, the benefit of a manufactuie, even of foreign materials, is always of  
great, though perhaps of fecondary importance.  
  
A ttrong impreffion prevails in the minds of thofe concerned in diftilleries  
(inciuding, too, the moft candid and enlightened) that greater differences in the  
rates of duty on foreign and domeftic {pirits are neceflary, completely to fecure  
the fuccefsful manufacture of the latter; and there are facts which entitle this  
impreflion to attention.  
  
It isknown, that the price of melaffes for fome years paft, has been fuccef-  
fively rifing in the Weft India markets, owing, partly, to a competition which  
did vot formerly exiit, and partly to an extenfion of demand in this country ;

vaftatien attendant on the infurrection in Hifpaniola, in paiticular, mut not  
only contribute very much to that effect, but may be expected to give it  
fome duration. Thefe circumitances, and the «uty of three cents per gallon  
on melaffes, may render it difficult for the diftillers of that material to main-

It is reprefented, that the price of fome ef the materials is greater here than

fupply. :  
  
Thirdly. As to dire&amp; bounties, or premiums upon the manvfaétured ar-  
ticles.  
  
To afford more effe&amp;tual encouragement to the rmeanufaéture, and at tlhe fume  
time to promote the cheapneis of the article for the benefit of navigation, it  
will be of great ule to allow a bounty of two cents per yard on all {ail-cloth  
which is made in the united ftates, from materials of their own growth. This  
would alfo affift the culture of thofe materials. An encouragement of this kind,  
if adopted, ought to be ettablithed for a muderate term of years, to invite to new  
undertakings, and to an extenfion of the old. This is an article of umportance  
enough to warrant the employment of extraordinary means in tts favour.  
  
COTTON. There is fomething ia the textare of this material, which adapts  
it in a peculiar degree to the application of machines.  
  
The fingular utility of the mili for {pinning of cotton, not long fince invented  
in England, has been noticed in another place: but there are other machines,  
fearcely inferior in utility, which, in the different manufaGtories of this article,  
are employed either exclufively or with more than crdinary effect. This  
very imporcant circumftance recommends the fabr ics of cotton, in a more pare  
ticular manner, to a country in which a defect of hands confiitutes the greate it  
obftacle to fuccets.  
  
The variety and extent of the ufes to which the manufactures of this article  
are applicable, is another powerful argument im their favour.  
  
And the faculty of the united flates to produce the raw material in abundance,  
and of a quality, which, though alleged tobe interior to fome that is produced  
in other quarters, is neverthelefs capable of being ufed with advantage in ma-  
ny. fabrids, and is probably fufceptible of being carried, by a more experienced  
culture, to much greater pertection, fuggefts an additional and a very cogent  
inducement to the vigorous puriuit of the cotton branch, in its feveral iwbui-  
vifions.  
  
How much has been already done, has been fated in a preceding part of this  
report.  
  
In addition to this, it may be announced, that a fociety is forming, with a ca-  
pital which is expected to he extended to at leaft hait a million of dollars ; on be-  
half of which meafures are already in train for proiecuting, ona large icale, the  
making and printing of cotton goods.  
  
Thefe circumftances con{pire to indicate the expediency of removing any ob-  
ftructions, which may happen to exift, to the advantageous profecution of the  
manufactories in queftion, and of adding fuch encouragements as may dppear  
neceflary and proper.  
  
The prefent duty of three cents per pound’, on the foreign raw material,  
is undoubtédly a very ferious impediment to the progrefs of thoie manufac-  
tures.

46° Report of the fecretary of the treafury on manufaflures. [1792  
  
Not being, like hemp, an wniverfal production of the country, it affords lefs  
affurance of an adequate internal fupply : but the chief objection arifes from the  
doubts, which are entertained concerning the quality of the national cotton. It  
is alleged, that the fibre of it is confiderably fhorter and weaker, than that of  
fome other places ; and it has been obferved, as a general rule, that the nearer  
the place of growth to the equator, the better the quality of the cotton. That  
which comes from Cayenne, Surinam, and Demarara, is faid to be preferable,  
even at a material difference of price, to the cotton of the ifl:nds,  
  
While a hope may reafonably be indulged, that, with due care and attention,  
the national cotton may be made to approach nearer than it now does to that  
of regions fomewhat more favoured by climate, and while faéts authorife an o-  
pinion, that very great ufe may be made of it, and that itis a refource which  
gives greater fecurity to the cotton fabrics of this country, than can be enjoyed  
by any which depends wholly on external fupply, it will certainly be wife in  
every view, to letour infant manufatures have the full benefit of the belt mate-  
rials, on the cheapeft terms. It is obvious, that the neceffity of having fuch  
materials, is proportioned to the untkilfalnefs and inexpe:ience of the workmen  
employed, who, if inexpert, will not f.il to commit great wafle, where the ma-  
terials they are to work with, are of an indiff-rent kind.

branch cannot be regarded as inferior to any, which relates to the clothing of  
the inhabitants.  
  
Houfehold manufaétures of this material are carried on, in different parts of  
the united ftates, to a very interefting extent: but there is only one branch,  
which, asaregular bufinels, can be {aid to have acquired maturity. ‘This is  
the making of hats.  
  
Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with fur, are made in large quantities, in  
different ftates; and nothing feems wanting, but an adequate fupply of m.te-  
rials, to render the manufacture commenfurate with the demand.  
  
A promifing effay, towards the fabrication of cloths, cailimers, and other  
woollen goods, is likewife going on at Hartford, in Connecticut. Specimens ot  
the different kinds which are made, in the poffeflion of the fecretary, evince  
that thefe fabrics have attained a very cenfiderable degree of perfection. Their  
quality certainly furpaffes any thing, that could have been looked for, i: fo  
thort a time, and under fo great difadvantages : and confpires with the {Gan-  
tines of the means, which have been at the command of the direftors, to form  
the eulogium of that public {pirit, perfeverance, and judgement, which hive  
been able to accompiith fo much.  
  
To cherifh and bring to maturity this-precioas embryo mutt engage the mof  
ardent wifhes, and proportionable regret, as far as the means a: doing it may  
appear difficult or uncertain.  
  
Meafures, which fhould tend to promote an abundant fupply of wool, of  
good quality, would probably afford the molt efficacious aid, tha: prefent clr  
cumftances permit.  
  
To encourage the raifing andimproving the breed of fheep at home, would  
certainly be the moft defirable expedient, for that purpofe ; but it may not be  
alone fuffieienr, efpecially as it is yet a problem, whether our wool be capable  
of fuch a degree of improvement, as to render it fit fur the finer fabrics.

PRINTED BOOKS. The great number of preffes diffeminated throughs  
out the union, feem to afford an affurance, that there is no need of being  
indebted to foreign countries for the printing of the books which ae  
ufed in the united ftates. A duty of ten per cent. initead ct five, which is  
now charged upon the article, would have a tendency te aid the bufinefs ine  
ternally.  
  
It occurs, as an objeétion to this, that it may have an unfavourable afpe&amp;  
fowards literature, by raifing the prices of books in umiverfsl ufe, in private  
families, {chools, and other feminarics of Jearning. Bug the difference, it is con-  
ecived, would be without cffeé&amp;.  
  
As to books which ufually fill the librarics of the wealthier claffes, and of  
profeffional men, fuch an aygmentation of prices, 23 mught be occafioned by an  
additional duty ef five per cent. would be too |itile felt to be an impediment to  
the acquifition,  
  
Aad with regard to books which may he {pecially imported for the ufs  
of particuiar feminaries of learning, and of public libraries, a total exemption  
from duty would be advifeable, which would go far towards obviating the  
objection juft mentioned, They arenow fubje&amp;t to a duty of five per cent.  
  
As to the books in moft general family ufe, the conftancy and univerfality  
of the demand would miure exertions to furnifh them a: home ; and the means  
are completely adequate. Is may alfo be expe&amp;ted ultimately, in this as in otner  
cafes, that the extenfion of the domeftic manufatture would conduce te the  
cheapnefs of the article.  
  
It ought not to pafs unrémarked, that to encourage the printing of books is  
to encourage the manufadture of paper.  
  
REFINED SUGARS AND CHOCOLATE Are among the number of  
extenfive and profpcrous domeftic manufactures.  
  
Drawbacks of th: duties upon the materials, of which they are refpe€tively  
made, in cafes of exportation, would have a beneficial infiuence upon the ma.  
nufa&amp;ure, and would conform toa precedent, which has been already fur-  
nifhed in the inftince of melaffzs, on the exportation of diltiiled {pirits.  
  
Cocoa, the raw material, now pays aduty of one cent per ib. while choco.  
late, which is a prevailing and very fimpie manafaéture, is comprifed in the  
mafs of articles rated at no more than five p-r cent.  
  
There would appear to be a propriety in encoursging the manufaSture, by  
a fomewhat higher duty, on its foreign rival, than is paid on the raw material,  
Two cents per 1b. on imported chocolate would, it is prefamed, be without  
inconvenience.  
  
  
  
THE foregoing heads coniprife the mott important of the feveral kinds of  
  
manufactures, which have occurred as requiiing, and, at the fame time, as  
  
moft proper for public encouragement: aud fuch meafures for affording it, xs

&lt; If then it fatisfaftorily appears, that it is the interell of the  
United States generally to encourage manufactures, it merits parti¬  
cular attention, that there are circumflances which render the prefent  
acritical moment for entering with zeal upon the important bufinefs;  
the effort cannot fail to be materially feconded by a confiderablc and  
increafing influx of money, in confequence of foreign fpeculations in  
the funds—and by the diforders which exift in different parts of  
Europe.  
  
‘ The firft circumftance not only facilitates the execution of ma¬  
nufacturing enterprifes, but it indicates them as a neceffary mean to  
turn the thing itfcif to advantage, and to prevent its being eventually  
an evil. If ufeful employment be not found for the money of fo¬  
reigners brought to the country to be invefted in purchales of the  
public debt, it will quickly be re-exported to defray the expence of  
an extraordinary confumption of foreign luxuries; and dillrefling  
drains of our fpecie may hereafter be experienced to pay the intereft,  
and redeem the principal, of the purchafed debt,  
  
‘ This ufeful employment too ought to be of a nature to produce  
folid and permanent improvements. If the money merely ferves to  
give a temporary fpring to foreign commerce, as it cannot procure  
new and Jailing outlets for the produCls of the country, there will be  
no real or durable advantage gained; as far as it (hall find its way in  
agricultural amelioracion8&gt; in opening canals, and in fimilar improve¬  
ments, it will be productive of fubftantial utility; but there is reafon  
to doubt, whether in fuch channels it is likely to find fufficient em-  
jployment; and Hill more, whether many of thofe who poffefs it would  
he as readily attracted to objects of this nature as to manufacturing  
purfoits, which bear greater analogy to thofe to which they are ac-  
cuftomed, and to the fpirit generated by them.  
  
* To open the one field as well as the other, will at lead fecure a  
better profpeCt of ufeful employment for whatever acceflion of money  
tl&#x27;.ere has been or may be.  
  
* There is at the prefent junCture a certain fermentation of mind,  
certain aCUvity of Ipeculation and enterprife, which, if properly di-  
  
^^Sed, maybe made fubfervient to ufeful purpofes; but which, if  
left entirely to itfelf, may be attended with pernicious effeCls,

&quot;AquefHon has been made concerning  
the conllitutional right of the government  
nf the United States to apply this species  
of encouragement, but there is certainly  
110 good foundation for such a quertion.  
Tlie national legislature has express autho­  
rity &quot;To l;iy and collect taxes, duties,  
imports, and excites, to pay the debts and  
provide for the comtnvn defence and gene­  
ral welfare,&quot; with no other qualifications  
than that &quot;all duties, import?, and exciles,  
lliall be uniform throughout the United  
States, that no capitation or other direil  
tax (hall be laid unlets in proportion to  
numbers ascertained by a cenlus or enume­  
ration taken 011 the principles preferibed  
in the constitution, and that &quot; n» tax or  
duty lliall be laid 011 articles exported  
from kny slate.&quot;  
&quot;These three qualifications excepted,  
tlie power to raije money is plenary and  
indefinite ; and the objects to which it may  
We appropriated are no less coriipreheiiGve,  
than the payment of the public debts and  
:he providing for the common defence and  
general ■Ate (fare. The terms &quot;general wel­  
fare&quot; were douttlefs intended to fignify  
rtiore than was exprefl&#x27;ed ot- imported in  
:hofe which preceded, otherwise nume­  
rous exigencies incident to the affairs of a  
nation would have been left without a  
jrovifiort.—The plirafe is as coniprehen­  
~ive as any that could have been used ; be-  
Mmie it was not Jit that the constitutional  
juthority of the Union, to appropri»t*. «u.  
&quot;evenues fbbiild have, been rertrifletl with­  
n narrower limits tlten the &quot;general -n/el­  
rartand because this neceflarily embrac­  
es a vart variety of particulars, which are  
ufseptible neither of fpecification nor of  
lefinitiotv  
&quot;It is tlierefotb of necessity left to the  
lifcretion of the national legislature, to  
ironounce upon the objefls, which con­  
cern the general welfare, and for which,  
under that description, an appropriation of  
n oncy is requilite and proper.—And there  
eeuisto be 110 room for a doubt that what­  
ever concerns the general interests of leani­  
ng, of agriculture, of inanufaflures, ind  
as commerce, are Within the sphere of the  
national countils, as far as regards an ap­  
plication of money.&quot;  
[What possible object of government may  
not regard the application of money, if  
Coiigrefs ftiould think proper to make the  
application. J  
&quot; The only cjtialiflcatibn of the genebili­  
ty df the phrase in queftibn, which seems  
to be admillible, is this—that the objc£t to  
which an appropriation of money is to be  
made be general and not local; its opera­  
tion extending in fait or by possibility thro1-  
uMt tile Union, and not being confined to a  
particular spot.

matter—  
  
‘ 1ft. As to the point of the annual-revenue requifite for payment  
of intereft and redemption of principal. itive  
  
‘ As a determinate proportion will tend to perfpicuity in the rep.  
foning, let it be fuppofed, that the.annual revenite to’ be applic  
correfponding with the modification of the 6: per cents ftock for thy  
United States, is in the ratio of eight upon the hundred ;. that is; ip  
the firft inftance,. fix on account of intereft, and two on account gf  
principal. es  
  
* Thus far it is evident, that the capital deftroyed to the-capitat  
created, would bear no greater proportion than 8 to 100. «Ther  
would be withdrawn from the total mafs of other. capitals;.a fum of  
eight dollars to- be paid to the public creditor ; while he would be  
poflefed of a fum of one hundred dollars, ready to be applied to/any  
purpofe, to be embarked in any enterprife which might: appear to  
him eligible. Here then the augmentation of capital, or the éexcefsof  
that which is produced, beyond that which is deftroyed, is equal to  
ninety-two dollars.  
  
_ © To this conclufion itmay be objected, thatthe fum of eight dol-  
lars is to be withdrawn annually, until the whole hundred is extin _  
guifhed, and it may beinferred, thatin procefs of time a capital’will  
be deftroyed equal.to that which is at firft created.  
  
‘ But itis neverthelefs true, that during the whole of the interval,  
between the creation of the-capital-of roo dollars,. and its reduction  
to a fum not greater than that of the annual revenue appropriated to its:  
redemption—there will be a greater active capital. in exiftence thanif  
no debt: had been contra¢éted. The fum- drawn from other capitals  
in any one yecr will- not exceed eight dollars;. but there will be a*  
every inftant of time during the whole period in queftion, a fum cor-  
refponding with /omuch of the principal ax remains unredeemed inthe °  
hands of fome perfon or other, employed, or ready to be employed,  
in fome profitable undertaking.. There will therefore conftantly be  
more capital in capacity to beemployed, than capitaltaken from em-  
ployment. The excefs for the firft year has been ftated to be mne-  
ty.-two dollars; it will diminith yearly ; but there always will be an  
excefs, until the principal of the debt is brought-to a level with the  
redeeming annuity, that is, in the cafe which has Been affunted by  
way of example, toeight dollars. The reality of this excefs become

et the end of a year, the foreigner is prefumed to draw back eight  
dollars on account of his principal and intereft, but he ftill leaves  
ninety-two of his original depofit in circulation, as he in like man-  
ner leaves eighty-four at the ‘end of the fecond year, drawing back  
then alfo the anauity of eight dollars: and thus the matter proceeds ;  
the capital leftin circulation diminifhing each year ; and coming near-  
erto the level of the annuity drawn back. There are, however,  
fome differences in the ultimate operation of the part of the debt  
which is purchafed by foreigners, and that which remains in the  
hands of citizens. But the general effect in each cafe, though in  
different degrees, is to add to-the ative capital of the country.  
  
‘ Hitherto the reafoning has proceeded on a conceffion of the  
pofition, that there is a deftruction of fome other-capital, to the ex  
tent of the annuity appropriated to the payment of the iftereft and  
the redemption of the principal of the debt ; but inthis, too much  
has been conceded. ‘There is at moft a temporary: ‘transfer of fomé  
other capital, to the amount of the annuity, from thofe who pay to  
the creditor who receives ; which he again reftores to the circulation  
to refume the offices of a capital. ‘This he does either immediate-  
ly by employing the money in fome branch of induftry, or mediate-  
ly by lending it to fome other perfon who does fo employ it, -or by  
{pending it on his-own maintenance. In either fuppofition, there is  
nodeftruction of capital.: there is nothing more than a fufpenfion of  
is motion for a time, that is, while at is paffing from the hands of  
thofe who pay into the public coffers, and thence through the puble  
creditor into fome other channel.of circulation. When the pay-  
ments of intereft are periodical and quick, and made dy the inftrn/  
mentality of banks, the diverfion or fufpenfion of capital -may almott  
be denominated momentary. Hence the deduction on this account  
is far lefs than it at firft fight appears to be.  
  
* There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity, no deftruétion  
nor transfer of any other capital, than that portion of the income of  
each individual, which goes to make up the annuity. The land  
which furnifhes the farmer with the fam which he is to contribute  
remains the fame ; ‘and the like may be obferved, of other capitals.  
Indeed, as far as.the tax, which is the object of contribution (as fre-  
quently happens when it does not opprefs by its weight) may have  
been a motive to, greater exertion in any occupation ; it may. even  
ferve to increafe the contributory capital.’ fa

their calculations and facts are diſputable, and  
their arguments too deluſive and inconcluſive to  
require refutation.  
  
The fact is, land is a ſtock or capital, and the  
RENT of land from the tenant is the ordinary  
profit of that ſtock; in the ſame manner that  
the /urplus which ariſes out of any manufactory,  
after replacing its ordinary expences, is the ordi-  
ary projit of the Capital, ſunk in the proſecuti-

defraying the expences .of a given Capital  
employed in the purchaſe and improvement of  
a piece of land, 1s greater or leſs than that of a  
LIKE capital employed in the praſecution of a

reign countries.  
  
Men reluctantly quit one course of occupation  
and livelihood for another, unless invited to it by  
very apparent and proximate advantagés. Many,  
who would go from one country to anot&#x27;er, if they  
had a prospect of continuing, with more benefit, the  
‘eallings to which they have been educated, will often  
not be tempted to change their situation by the hope  
ef doing better in some other way. Manufacturers,  
who (listening to the powerful invitations of a better  
  
price for their fabrics, or their labor, of greater  
  
theapness of provision and raw materials, of an ex-  
emption from the chief part of tlie taxes, burdens  
and restraints, which they endure in the old world,  
of greater personal independence and consequence,’  
under the operation of a more equal government,  
and of, what is far more precious than mere religi-  
#us toleration, a perfeet equality of religious privi-  
Jeges) would probably flock from Europe to the  
Wnited ‘States to pursue their own trades or prefes-  
sions, if they were once made sensible of the advan-  
tages they would enjoy, and were inspired with an  
assurance of encouragement and employment, will,  
with difficulty, be induced to transplant themselves,  
witha view to become cultivators of land.  
If it be true, then, that it is tlic interest of the  
United States to open every possible avenue to emi-  
ation from abroad, it affords a weighty argument  
w the encotragement of manufactures ; winch, for  
the reason just assigned, will have the stronyest  
tendency to multiply the inducements to it.

‘the ordinary course of things, will be greater or less  
  
in the same proportion.  
  
For the purpose of this vent, a domestic market is  
&#x27;greatly to be preferred to a foreign one ; because it  
jis, in the nuture of things, far more to be relied  
upon,  
  
It is a primary object of the policy of nations to  
be able to supply themselves with subsistence from  
their own soils ; and manufacturing nations, as far 45  
circumstances permit, endeavor to procure from the  
same source, the raw materials necessary for their  
own fabrics. This disposition, urged by the spirit  
of monopoly, is sometimes even carried to an inju-  
&#x27;dicious extreme. It seems not always to be reccl-  
‘lected, that nations who have neither mines nor m*  
  
{nufactures, c2n only obtain the manufactured articles  
  
of which they stand in need, by an exchange of the  
products of their soils; and that, if those who cal  
best furnish them with such articles, are unwilling to  
give a due course to this exchange, they must of ne-  
cessity make every possible effort to manufacture for  
themselves; the effect of which is, that the manv-  
facturing nations abridge the natural advantages of  
their situation, through an unwillingness to permit  
the agricultural countries to enjoy the advantages  
of theirs, and sacrifice the interest of a mutually  
beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling  
every thing and buying nothing.  
But is is also a consequence of the policy, which  
has been noted, that the foreign demand for the pro-  
ducts of agricultural countries, is in a great degre¢  
rather casual and occasional, than certain or cof  
stant. To what extent injurious interraptions of th¢

most extensive intercourse, throw serious obstruc-  
tions in the way of the orincipilt staples of the  
United States.  
  
In such a position of things, the United States  
cannot exchange with Europe on equal terms: and  
the want of reciprocity would render them-the vic-  
tim of a system, which should induce them to éon-  
fine their views to agriculture, and refrain from ma.  
nufactures. A constant and increasing necessity, on  
their part, for the commodities of Europe, and only  
a partial and occasional demand for their own, in  
return, could not but expose them to a state of im-  
poverishment, compared with the opulence to which  
their political and aatural advantages - authorise  
sliem to aspire. |  
  
Remarks of this kind are not made in the spirit of  
complaint. °Tis for the nations, whose regulations  
are alluded to, to judge for themselves, whether by  
aiming at too much, they do not lose more than they  
gain. ’Tis for the United States to consider by what  
mneans they can render themselves least dependeat,  
on the combinations, right or wrong, of foreign  
policy. ;  
  
it is no small consolation, that already the mea-  
sures which have embarrassed our trade, have acce-  
lerated internal improvements; which, upon the  
whole, have bettered our affairs. To diversify and  
extend these improvements, is the surest and safest  
method of indemnifying ourselves for any inconve-  
srences which those or similar measures have a ten-  
deacy to beget. If Europe will not take from us the  
products of our soil, upon terms consistent with aur  
interest, the natural remedy is, to contract, as fast as  
possible, our wants of her. .  
  
2. The conversion of their waste into cultivated  
land is certainly a point of great moment in the po-  
litical calculations of the United States. But the  
degree in which this may possibly be retarded by  
  
tie encouragement of munufxctories does not appear |  
  
to countervail the powerful inducements to affording  
that encouragement. |  
  
An observation, made in another place, is of a  
nature to have great influence upon this question.  
If it cannot be denied, that the interests, even of  
agriculture, may be advanced more by having such  
of the lands of a state as are occupied under good  
cultivation, than by having a greater quantity occu-  
  
ied under a much inferior cultivation—and if ma-

situation, aclimate and soil adapted to the produc- | lead to the same conclusion. Previous to the revo-  
tion of peculiar commodities, may, sometimes, con-| lution, the quantity of coin, possessed by the colo-  
  
tradict the rule; but there is every reason to believe  
that it will be found, in the main, a justone.  
Another circumstance, which gives a superiority  
of commercial advantages to states that manufac-  
ture, as well as cultivate, consists in the more nume-  
rous attractions, which amore diversified market  
  
offers to foreign customers, and in the greater,  
  
scope which it affords to mercantile enterprise. It  
is a position of indisputable truth in commerce, de-  
pending, too, on very obvious reasons, that the great-  
est resort willever be to those marts, where com-  
modities, while equally abundant, are more various.  
Each difference of kind, holds out an additional in-  
ducement: and it isa position not less clear, that  
the field of enterprise must be enlarged to the mer-  
chants of acountry, in proportion to the variety, as  
well as the abundance of the commodities which  
they find at home for exportation to foreign mar-  
kets. |  
  
A third circumstance, perhaps not inferior to  
either of the other two, conferring the superiority  
which has been stated, has relation to the stagna-  
tions of demand for certain commodities whieh, at  
at some time or other, interferes more or less with  
the sale of all. Thenation which can bring to mar-  
ket but few articles, is likely to be more quickly  
and sensibly affected by such stagnations, than one  
which is always possessed of a great variety of com-  
modities : ‘the former frequently finds too great a  
portion of its stock of materials, for sale or ex-  
change, lying on hand—or is obliged to make inju-  
rious sacrificessto supply its wants of foreign arti-  
cles, which are numerous and urgent, in propor-

purposes.  
  
Those manufactures too unite in a greater degree,  
than almost any others, the several requisites which  
have been mentioned, as proper to be consulted in  
the selection df objects.  
  
The only further encouragement of mantufactories  
of this article, the propriety of which may be con-  
sidered as unquestionable, seems to be an increase  
of the duties on foreign rival commodities.  
  
Steel is a branch, which has already made a consi-  
derable progress, and it is ascertained, that some  
hew enterprises, on a more extensive scale, have been  
lately set on foot. The facility of carrying it to an  
extent, which will supply all internal demands, and  
furnish a considerable surplus for exportation, can-  
not be doubted. The duty upon the importation of  
this article, which is at present seventy-five cents  
per cwt. may, it is conceived, be safely and advanta-  
geously extended to one hundred cents. It is desira-  
ble by decisive arrangements, to second the efforts,  
which are making in so very valuable a branch.  
  
The United States already in a great measure  
supply themselves with nails and spikes. They are  
able, and ought certainly to do itentirely. The first  
and most laborious operation, in this manufacture,  
is performed by water-mills; and of the persons  
afterwards employed, a great proportion are boys,  
whose early habits of industry are of importance to  
the community; to the present support of their fa-  
milies, and to their own futere comfort. It is not  
less curious than true, than in certain parts of the  
country, the making of nails is an occasional family  
manufacture.  
  
The expediency of an additional duty on these  
articles, is indicated by an important fact. About  
1,800,000 pounds of them were imported into the  
United States, in the course of a year, ending the  
thirtieth of September, 179°. A duty of two cents  
per pound would, it is presumable, speedily put an  
end to so considerable an importation. And it is in  
every view proper that an end should be put to it.  
  
The manufacture of these articles, like that of  
some others, suffers from the carelessness and dis-  
honesty of a part of those who carry it on. An in-  
spection, in certain cases, might tend to cogrect the

which was, not long since, deemed very questionable, appears at this  
time to be pretty generally admitted. The embarrassments, which

licy of the nations, to be able to  
supply themselves with subsistence from their own soils; and manu-  
facturing nations, as far as circumstances permit, endeavour to pro-  
cure ffom the same source, the raw materials necessary for their own  
fabrics. ‘This disposition, urged by the spirit of monopoly, is some-  
times even carried to an injudicious extreme. It seems not always  
to be recollected, that nations which have neither mines nor manufac-  
tures, can only obtain the manufactured articles of which they stand  
in need, by an exchange of the products of their soils; and that; if  
those who can best furnish them with such articles, are unwilling to  
give a due course to this exchange, they must of necessity make eve-  
ry possible effort to manufacture for themselyes ; the effect of which  
is, that the manufacturing nations abridge the natural advantages of  
their situation, through an unwillingness to permit the agricultural |  
countries to enjoy the advantages of theirs, and sacrifice the interest  
of a mutually beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling eve-  
ry thing and buying nothing.  
  
But it is also a consequence of the policy, which has been noted,  
that the foreign demand for the products of agricultural countries, is  
in a great degree rather casual and occasional, than certain or con-  
stant. To That extent injurious interruptions of the demand for  
some of the staple commodities of the United States, may have been  
experienced, from that cause, must be referred to the judgment of  
those who are e in carrying on the commerce of the country :  
but it may be safely affirmed, that such interruptions are at times ve-  
ry inconveniently felt, and that cases not unfrequently occur, in which

coarse cloths,/coatings, serges and flannels, linsey woolseys, hosiery  
of wool, cotton and thread, coarse fustians, jeans and muslins, check-  
ed and striped cotton and linen goods, bedticks, coverlets and coun-  
terpanes, tow linens, coarse shirtings, sheetings, towelling and table  
linen, and various mixtures of wool and cotton, and of cotton and  
flax, are made in the household way; and in many instances to an ex-  
tent not only sufficient for the supply of the families in which they  
are made, but for sale; and even in some cases for exportation. It is  
computed in a number of districts, that two-thirds, three-fourths, and  
even four-fifths of all the cloathing of the inhabitants are made by  
themselves. The importance of so great a progress, as appears to  
have been made in family manufactures, within a few years, both in  
a moral and political view, renders the fact highly interesting.  
  
Neither does the above enumeration comprehend all the articles  
that are manufactured as regular trades. Many others occur, which  
are equally well established, but which not being of equal importance  
have been omitted. And there are many attempts still in their in-  
fancy, which, though attended with very favourable appearances,  
could not have been properly comprised in an enumeration of manu-  
factories already established. There are other articles also of great  
ye pea a which, though, strictly speaking» manufactures, are omit-  
ted, as being immediately connected with husbandry: such are flour,  
pot and pearl ash, pitch, tar, turpentine, and the like.  
  
There remains to be noticed an objection to the encouragement of  
manufactures, of a nature different from those which question the  
probability of success—this it derived from its supposed tendency to  
give a psp oF 4 of advantages to particular classes, at the expense  
of the rest of the community, who, it is affirmed, would be able to  
procure the requisite supplies of manufactured articles, on better  
terms from foreigners, than from our own citizens, and who, it is al-  
leged, are reduced to a necessity of paying an enhanced price for what-  
ever they want, by every measure, w ich obstructs the free compe-  
tition of foreign commodities.  
  
It is not an unreasonable supposition, that measures which serve to  
abridge the free competition of foreign articles, have a tendency to  
occasion an enhancement of prices, and it is not to be denied, that  
such is the effect of anumber of cases: but the fact does not uniform-  
ly correspond with the theory. A reduction of prices has,ein several  
instances, immediately succeeded the establishment of a domestic  
manufacture. Whether it be that foreign manufacturers endeavour  
to supplant, by underselling our own, or whatever else be the cause,  
the effect has been such as is stated, and the reverse of what might  
have been expected. |  
  
But though it were true, that the immediate and certain effect of  
regulations controlling the competition of foreign with domestic fabrics,  
  
_ was an increase of price, it is universally true, that the contrary is the  
  
ultimate effect with every successful manufacture. When a domestic  
manufacture has attained to perfectiqn, and has engaged in the pro-  
secution of ita competent number ef persons, it invariably becomes  
cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges which attend the im-  
portation of foreign commodities, it can be afforded, and accordingly  
seldom or never fails to be sold cheaper, in process of time, than was

But the uniferm appearance of an abundance of specie, as the con-  
comitant of a flourichine state of manufactures, and of the reverse,  
where they do not prevail, afford a strong presumption of their favon-  
yable operation upon the wealth of a country. |  
  
Not only the wealth, but the independence and security of a coun-  
try, appear to be materially connected with the prosperisy of manu-  
factures. Every nation, with a view to these great objects, ought to  
endeavour to possess within itself al] the essentials of national supply.  
These comprise the means of subsistence, habitation, cloathing and  
defence.  
  
The possession of these is necessary to thé perfection of the body  
politic, te the safety as well as to the welfare of the society; the want  
of either, is the want of an important organ of political life and motion ;  
and in tne various crises which await a state, it must severely feel the  
effects of such deficiency. ‘The extreme embarrassments of the Uni-  
ted States during the late war, from an incapacity of supplying them-  
selves, are still matter of keen recollection: a future war might be  
expected again to exemplify the mischiefs and dangers of a situation,  
to which that wei tayant| is still in too great‘ degree applicable, unless  
changed by timely and vigorows exertions. ‘To effect this change, as  
fast as shall be prudent, merits all the attention and all the zeal of our  
public councils; ’tis the next great work tebe accomplished.  
  
  
  
REPORT ON DOMESTIC MANUFACTURES. 15  
  
‘The want of a navy to protect our external commerce, as long as it  
shall continue, must render it a peculiarly precarious reliance, for the  
supply af essential articles; and must serve to strengthen prodigiously  
the a nts in favour of manufactures.  
  
To general considerations are added some of a more partieu-  
lar nature. .  
  
Our distance from Europe, the great fountain of manufactured sup-  
  
ly, subjects us, in the existing state of things, to inconvenience and  
  
s in two ways.  
  
The bulkiness of those commodities which are the chief productions  
of the soil, necessarily imposes very heavy charges on their transpor-  
tation, to distant markets. These charges, in the cases, in which the  
nations, to whom our products are sent, maintain a competition in the  
supply of their own markets, principally fall upon us, and form mate-  
aldediectiells from the primitive value of the articles furnished. The  
charges on manufactured supplies brought from Europe, are greatly  
enhanced by the same circumstance of distance. ‘These charges, again,  
in the cases in which our own industry maintains no competition, in  
our own markets, also principally fall upon us; and are an additiona)  
cause of extraordinary deduction from the primitive value of our own  
products; these being the materials of exchange for the foreign fabrics  
which we consume.  
  
The equality and moderation of individual property, and the grow-  
ing settlements of new districts, occasion, in this country, an unusual  
demand for coarse. manufactures; the charges of which being greater.  
in preportion to their greater bulk, augment the disadvantage, which  
has just been described.  
  
As in most countries domestic supplies maintain a very considera:  
ble competition with such foreign productions of the soil, as are ime  
pores or sale; if the extensive establishment of manufactories in the  
  
Inited States does not create a similar competition in respect te  
manufactured articles, it appears to be clearly deducible, from the  
considerations which have been mentioned, that they must sustaima  
double loss in theirexchanges with foreign nations; strongly conducive  
to an unfavourable balance of trade, and very prejudicial to their  
interests.  
  
These disadvantages press with no small weight, on the landed  
interest of the country. In seasons of peace, they cause a serious de-  
duction from the intrinsic value of the products of the soil. In the  
time of a war, which should either involve ourselves, or another naz.  
tion, possessing a considerable share of our carrying trade, the  
charges on the transportation of our commodities, bulky as most of  
them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous burden to the farmer,  
while obliged to depend in so great a degree as he now does, upon  
foreign markets for the vent of the surplus of his labour.

may hy that those who are injured, in the first instance, may be  
eventually indemnified, by the superior steadiness of an extensive  
domestic market depending on that prosperity: yet in a matter, in  
which there is so much room for nice sal difficult combinations, in  
which such opposite considerations combat each other, prudence  
seems to dictate, that the expedient in question, ought to be indulged  
witha sparing hand.  
  
IV. Pecumary bounties. |  
  
This has been found one of the most efficacious means of encourag-  
ing manufactures, and it is, in some views, the best. Though it has not  
  
et been practised upon by the government of the United States, (un-  
lens the allowance on the exportation of dried and pickled fish and  
salted meat could be considered as a bounty) and though it is less fa-  
voured by public opinion than some other modes—its advantages are  
these—  
  
1. Itis a species of encouragement more positive and direct than  
any other, and for that very reason, has a more immediate tendency  
to stimulate and uphold new enterprises, increasing the chances of  
profit, and diminishing the risks of loss, in the first attempts.  
  
2. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of  
rice, which is incident to some other modes, or i¢ produces it to a  
ess degree; either by making no addition to the charges on the ri-  
  
val foreign article, as in the case of protecting duties, or by making a  
smaller addition. ‘The first happens when the fund for the bounty is  
derived from a different object (which may or may not increase the  
price of some other article, according to the nature of that object) +  
  
. . 5 .  
the second, when the fund is derived from the same or a similar 0  
  
ject of foreign manufacture. One per cent. duty on the foreign arti-  
cle, converted into a bounty on the domestic, will have an equal effect  
with a duty of two per cent. exclusive of such bounty ; and the price  
of the foreign commodity is liable to be raised, in the one case, in the  
proportion of one per cent. in the other, in that of two per cent. In-  
deed the bounty, when drawn from another source, is calculated to  
promote a reduction of price; because, without laying any new charge  
on the foreign article, it serves to introduce a competition with 1t,  
and to increase the total quantity of the article in the market.

20 EXTRACT FROM ALEXANDER HAMILTON&#x27;S  
  
The continuance of bounties on manufactures long established, must  
almost always be of questionable policy: because a presumption  
would arise in every such case, that there were natural and inherent,  
impediments to success. But in new undertakings, they are as justi-  
fiable, as they are oftentimes necessary.  
  
There is a degree of prejudice against bounties, from an appearance  
of giving away the public money, without an immediate consideration,  
and froma su position, that they serve to enrich particular classes, at  
the expense of the community.  
  
But neither of these sources of dislike will bear a serious examina-  
tion. ‘There is no purpose to which public money can be more bene-  
ficiaily applied, than to the acquisition of a new and useful branch of  
industry; no consideration more valuable than a permanent addition  
to the general stock of productive labour. |  
  
As to the second source of objection, it equally les against other  
modes of encouragement which are admitted to be eligible. As often  
as a duty upon a foreign article makes an addition to its price, it  
causes an extra expense to the community, for the benefit of the domes-  
tic manufacturer. A bounty does no more. But it is the interest of  
the society, in each case, to submit to a temporary expense, which is  
more than compensated, by an increase of iadaaiey and wealth—by an  
augmentation of resources and independence—and by the circum-  
stance of eventual cheapness, which has been noticed in another  
place.

It cannot escape notice, thata duty upon the im-  
portation of an article can no otherwise aid the do-  
mestic production of it, than by giving the latter  
  
eater advantages in the home market. It can have  
ne influence upon the advantageous sale of the arti-  
cle produced, inforeagn markets; notendency there-  
fore to promote 1ts exportation. :  
  
The true way to conciliate these two interests, 18  
to lay aduty onforeign manufactures of the material,  
the growth of which is desired to be encouraged,  
and to apply the produce of that duty, by way of  
bounty, either upon the production of the material  
itself, or upon its manufacture at home, or upon  
both. In this disposition of the thing, the manu-  
  
acturer commences his enterprize, under every ad-  
vantage, whichis attainable as to quantity or price  
of the raw material: and the farmer, if the bounty  
be immediately given to him, is enabled by it to en-  
ter into a successful competition with the foreign  
material: if the bounty be to the manufacturer on so  
uch of the doinestic material as he consumes, the  
operation is nearly the same; he has a motive of in-  
terest to prefer the domestic commodity, it of equal  
quality, even at higher price, than the foreign, so  
long asthe difference of price is any thing: short of  
&quot; the bounty, which is allowed upon the article.  
  
Except the simple anc ordinary kinds of house-  
  
hold manufacture, or those for which there are very  
commanding local advantages, pecumiary bountics,  
are in most cases indispensable to the introduction  
ofa new branch. A stimulus and a support not less  
powerful and direct is, generally speaking, essen-  
tial to the overconiing of the obstacles which arise  
fromthe competitionof superior skill and maturity  
elsewhere. Bounties are especially essential, in re  
gard to articles, upon which those foreigners who  
have been accustomed to supply a country are in  
the practice of granting them.  
_ The continuance of bounties on manufactures  
Jong established, must alinost always be of question-  
able policy; because a presumption would arise in  
every such case, that there were natural and inhe-  
rent impediments to success. But innew undertak-  
ings, they are as justifiable, as they are oftentimes  
necessary.  
  
There is adegree of prejudice against bounties,  
from an appearance of giving away the public mo-  
Rey, withoutan immediate consideration, and from  
a supposition, that they serve to enrich particular  
Classses, at the expense of the community.  
_ But neither ofthese sources of dislike will bear a  
Serious eXamination. There is no purpose to which  
public money can be more beneficially applied, than  
to the acquisition of a new and useful branch of in-  
dustry; no consideration more valuable than a per-  
Manent addition to the general stock of productive  
labor,  
  
_ As to the second source of objection, it equally  
  
hevagainst other modes of encouragement which are  
admitted to be eligible. As often as a duty upon  
a foreign article makes an addition to its price, it  
fauses an extra expense to the community, for the  
benefit of the domestic manufacturer. A bounty  
does no more. But it is the interest of the suciety,  
in each case, to submit to a temporary expense,  
  
which is more than compensated, by an incrcase of  
  
industry and wealth—by an augmentation of re-  
Sources aud independence—and by the circum-  
  
Se + ial . ;  
  
stance of eventual cheapness, which has been notic-  
  
ed in another plac

difion of a new energy to the jrei.erAl &#x27;

The spirit of enterprise, useful 3c pro- !  
lific as it is,&#x27; must necessanjy be contract- 1

the Circumstances, which have .been in- li  
dicated. It is a pi incrpal mean, by which  
the establishment ot manufactures eon­  
tributes &quot;to; an augmentation of the pror  
duce or revenue of a country, and has an  
immediate &amp; direct relation to the pros­  
perity of agriculture. - . t-V  
is evident tht.. the csrtfons of the  
husbandman will be steady r fluctuating,  
vigorous or feeble, in ; propjortion to trfe  
steadiness or fluctuation, adequateness,  
or infidequateness of the marketson which  
he must depend, for the vent of the sur-;  
plus, in the ordinary cpurse nf things, will  
be. greater or less in&quot;the iamc&#x27;propor­  
tion.: &#x27; &#x27; , . :) - &#x27; j, . i  
For, the purpose: of this vent, a domes  
tic market is, greatly to be preferred to a  
foreign one ; because it is, in the nature  
01 ,iuii)gs) &#x27;iar niorc; to oe renea on  
It is a primary object of the jjplicy of  
nations&#x27;, to be able to supply themselves  
with subsistence, from - their own soils;1  
and manufacturing nations, as far as; err j  
&#x27;cumstances rterm it, endeavor .to procure j  
from the sa&#x27;ie source, the raw materials  
necessary for .their &#x27; own fabrics. This  
disposition, urged by the spirit of monop­  
oly, is. sometimes even carried to an iu­  
iudicious extreme v It seems! not always  
to be recollected, that nations! which Have  
neither mines dor manufactures., can? on- 1  
li- obtain the : manufactured articles of  
which they j stand; in ,jieed,j byal ex­  
change of the products of their so&#x27;ffs ; arid  
that if thoset who -can be .furnish them  
with; such articles, ! are &quot;tfn&#x27;Willing&#x27;to give  
a due course? to this exenane, they, must  
of necessity make every possible efTbrt ttf  
manufacture for themselves; the effect  
of which is, that the manufactu ring na­  
tions abridge &quot;the natural advantages of  
; auuuiivn wiTijugn an unwillingness  
to permit the agricultural countries to  
erijoxj the advantages oftheirs, and sacri­  
fice the interest of. a mutually beneficial  
intercourse to the Vain project of selling  
every thing and buying nothinsr. ; : - I r

Our distance from Europe, the ereat  
fountain of manufactured supply, subjects  
us, in cue crusting sihic oi i uiings, to in  
convenience and loss in two ways.! fr -  
&quot; The bulkiness of &#x27; those commodities  
which are the chef productions of the  
soil, necessarily imposes very heavy char

markets; These charges irr the cases,

circumstances of distance;. These char

the materials of exchange for the Foreign

has just been described, v t i &#x27; j f  
As In most countries domestic; supplies

a irectly contrary ; Conclusion Mutual

wool of Virgiia is said to be of better

circumstance rendered the more prooa  
ble by the reflection, that Virginia em  
braces the same: latitudes with the finest  
Wool countries of Europe, i The climate  
of the south is also better adapted to the

The extensive cultivation of cotton can  
perhaps be hardly expected, but from the

“Considering how fast and. how much .the  
progress ef new settlements in the United States  
must’ incréisg the surplus produce of the soil,  
and weighing seriously the tendency of the sys-  
tem, which prevails among most of the eommer-  
cial nations of Eurape, whatever dependence  
may be placed on the force of natural circum-  
stances to counteract the effects of an artificial  
policy; there appear strong reasons to regard the  
foreign demand for that surplus; as too uncertain  
a reliance, and to desire a substitute for it in an  
extensive domestic market.  
  
» * To secure such a market, there is no other:  
expedient, than to promote manWfacturing estab-  
hshments.  
most numerous class, after the cultivators of the  
Jand, are for that reason the principal RORBUASS  
ef the surplus of their laboar,  
  
‘* This idea of an extensive domestic market  
for the surplus produce of the soil, is of the firat.  
consequence. 679, of all things; that which most  
effectually condilees&#x27; to a flourishing state of agri-  
culture. If the effect of manufactories should be  
to detach a portion of the hands, which would  
otherwise be engaged in tillage, it might possibly  
eause a smaller quantity of lands to be under cul-  
tivation ; but by their tendency to procure a  
more certain demand for the surplus produce of  
the soil, they would, at the same time, cause the  
lands, which were in cultivation, to be better  
improved and more productive. And while, by  
their influence, the condition of each individual  
farmer would.be meliorated, the total mass of agri-  
  
or this must evidently depend as much, if not more,  
on the degree of improvement, than upon: the  
number of acres under culture.  
  
‘*Itmerits particular observation, that the mul-  
  
Manufacturers, ‘who constitute the |  
  
‘the earth are sathaghed for articles which were  
before neglected. Animals, plants,.and minerals  
acquire a utility and value, which were before  
unexplored, |  
  
‘* The foregoing considerations seem sufficient  
to establish as general propositions, that it is the  
interest.of nations to diversify the industrious  
pursuits of the individuals who compose them—  
that theestablishment of manufactures is calculated  
not only to increase the general stock of useful and  
productive labour, but even to improve the state of  
agriculture in particular, certainly to advance the  
interests of those who are engaged in-it.’?.- Alex-

“‘ The expediency of encouraging manufac- |  
tures in the United States, which was, not long  
since, déemed very questionable, appears at  
this time to be pretty generally admiited. The  
embarrassments, which have obstructed the  
progress of our external trade, have led to  
serious reflections on the necessity of enlarging  
the sphere of our domestic commerce : the re-  
strictive regulations, which in foreign mar-  
kets abridge the vent of thetincreasing sur-  
plus of our agricultural produce, serve to be- |  
  
get an carnest desire, that a more extensive ,  
demand for that surplus may be created at |  
home. And the complete success which has  
rewarded manufacturing enterprise, in some  
valuable branches, conspiring with the pro-  
misiag symptons which attend some less ma-  
ture essays in others, justify a hope, that the  
obstacles to the growth of this species of in-  
dustry, are less formidable than they were ap-  
prehiended to be; and that itis not dificult to  
find in its further extension, a ful) (2 demuilica-

, in propor-  
tion to the separation and simplification of  
objects and the steadiness of attention devoted  
to each ; and must be less, in proportion to the  
complication of objecis, and the number among  
which the attention is‘distracted.  
  
2d. “ The economy of time, by avoiding the  
loss of it, incident to a frequent transition from  
one operation to another of a different nature,  
  
! This depends on various circumstances ; the  
  
transition itsel{—the orderly disposition of the  
implements, machines, and materials employed  
in the operation to be relinquished—the pre-  
paratory steps to the commencement of a new  
one—the interruption of the impulse, which  
the mind of the workman acquires, from being  
engaged in a particular operation—the distrac-  
tions, hesitations, and reluctances, which attend  
  
3d. * An extension of the use of machinery.  
A man occupied on a single object, will have  
it more in his power, and will be more nat-  
urally led to exert his imagination in devisin  
methods to facilitate and abridge labour, tham  
if he were perplexed by a variety of indepeme  
dent and dissimilar operations. Besides this  
the fabrication of machines, in numerous ine  
stances, becoming itself a distinct trad ar-  
tist who follows it, has all the ‘a tages  
which have been enumerated, for improvement  
in this particular art ,@m@ieboth ways the in-  
vention and appli¢atoin of machiney are in-  
tendedsno. ,  
  
“ And these causes united, the mere  
separation of the occupation of the cultivator,  
from that of an artificer, has the effect of aug-  
menting the productive powers of labour, and  
with them, the total mass of the produced or  
revenue of the country. In this view of the  
subject, therefore, the utility of artificers or  
manufacturers, towards promoting an increase  
of productive industry, is apparent.  
  
II. “ Asto an extension of the use of ma-  
chinery, alpoint which, though partly anticipa-  
ted, requires to be placed in one or two addi-  
tional lights.  
  
“The employment of machinery forms  
an item of great importance in the general  
mass of national industry. ’Tis an arti-  
ficial force brought in aid of the natural force  
of man ; and, to all the purpose of labour,

May it not therefore be fair- |

effort, and in consequence, to the general pro-  
duct of industry?  
  
“It shall be taken for granted, and the truth  
of the position referred to observation, that  
manufacturing pursuits are susceptible in a  
greater degree of application of machinery,  
than those of agriculture. Ifso, all the differ-  
ence is lost to a community, which instead of  
manufacturing for itself, procures the fabrics  
rexuisite to its supply from other countries.

steady demand fur the surplus produce of the

“This is among the most important of the  
circumstances which have been indicated. It  
is a principal mean,by which the establishment  
of manufactures contributes to an augmeuta-  
tion of the produce er reveuue of a country,

the prosperity of agriculture.  
  
“Tt is evident, thit the exertions of the hus-

or feeble, in proportion to the steadiness or  
fluctuation, adequateness, or iuadequateness of

deavor to procure from this source,the raw ma-

disposition, urged by the spirit of monopoly,  
is sometimes even carried to an injudicious ex-

that nations which have neither mines nor man-

ticles of which they stand in need, by an ex-  
change of the products of their soils; and that  
if these who can best furnish them with such

am femith, observes, in his ‘ Wealth of Na­  
tions,’ that “good roads, canals, and navigable  
rivers, by diminishing the expense of carriage,  
put the remote parts of the country more near­  
ly on a level with those in the neighbourhood  
of large towns; and, on that account, are the  
gr&lt; atest of all improvements. They encour­  
age the cultivation of the remote parts, which  
must always Ire the most extensive circle of  
the country. They are advantageous to towns,  
by breaking down the monopoly of the coun­  
try in its neighbourhood ; and they are advan­  
tageous to ail parish the country.” “It is not  
more than 50 years ago,” said he, in 1776,  
“ that some of the counties in the neighbour­  
hood of London, petitioned Parliament against  
the extension of turnpike roads into the re­  
motest counties. Those coiudies, they pre­  
tended, from the cheapness of labour, would  
be able to sell their gross and corn cheaper in  
the London market than themselves ; ami  
would thereby reduce their rents, and tuin  
their cultivation. Their rents, however, have  
risen, and their cultivation has been improved  
since that time.

Ja regard to the policy of encouraging the manufacturing system of this  
country by national legislation, the fundamental doctrine laid down by  
General Hamilton, in his report, appears to be founded in solid reason,—a  
doctrine which maintained that “every nation ought to endeavor to possess  
within itself all the essentials of national supply ; these comprise the means  
of subsistence, habitation, clothing, and defence. The possession of these,”

as well as to the welfare of society : the want of either is the want  
of an important organ of political life and motion ; and in the various crises  
which await a state, it must severely feel the effects of any such deficiency.  
The extreme embarrassments of the United States during the late war (the  
war of the revolution) from the incapacity of supplying ourselves, are still  
matters of keen recollection. A future war might be expected again to  
exemplify the mischiefs and pic, 88 of a situation to which that incapacity  
is still in too great a degree applicable, unless by timely and vigorous ex-  
ertions. ‘To effect this change as fast as shall be prudent, merits all the at-  
tention and all the zeal of our public councils: ’tis the next great work to  
be accomplished.”* This view appears to have been fortified by all ou

This reference drew from the Secretary of the

of the protecting policy imbedied in his celebrn

grounds on which he rested that vindication:  
&quot;The embarrassments which have obstructed the progress of  
our external trade have led to serious reflections on the nacussi­

beget an earnest desire that a more extonsive demand for that  
surplus may be created at home; and the complete

favorable to manufactures of the article, but  
the doubt is, whether it might not interfere

abate, if they do not remove, apprehension on  
this score; one is, the considerable increase  
of price, that has already been remarked, and  
which renders it probable that the free admis­

posed to be given” by the admission of iron

to an extent not only suticient for the supply of the  
families in which they are made, but tor sale, and  
even, in some cases, for exportation. it is computed  
in a number of districts that two-thirds, three-

failed in the analysis of rent.  
Smith, in general, as in the passage  
just above, takes the Physiocratic  
view of rent as the net product  
which is secured in agriculture  
alone. Hamilton analyzes land  
rent as the landlord’s share of the  
profits derived from his contribu-  
tion to the stock of the farmer;  
namely, the land. This analysis  
may have been suggested by Adam  
Smith. Hamilton’s thought is  
confused; but the passage below,  
together with that of Smith oppo-  
site, gives us the germ, perhaps, of  
Carey’s theory of Rent, which Bas-  
tiat accepted and popularized. ]  
  
It seems to have been over-  
looked that the land is itself a  
stock or capital, advanced or lent  
by its owner to the occupier or  
tenant, and that the rent he re-  
ceives is only the ordinary profit  
of a certain stock in land, not  
managed by the proprietor him-  
self, but by another to whom he  
lends or lets it, and who, on his  
part, advances a second capital to  
stock and improve the land, upon  
which he also receives the usual  
profit. The rent of the landlord  
and the profit of the farmer are,  
therefore, nothing more than the  
ordinary profits of two capitals be-  
longing to two different persons,  
and united in the cultivation of a  
farm. (p. 9.)

that those occupations which give greatest scope to the use of this  
auxiliary, contribute most to the general stock of industrious  
effort, and, in consequence, to the general product of industry ?”’  
  
Then, after explaining that manufactures are susceptible  
of a greater application of machinery than agriculture, he  
adds :—  
  
“ If so, all the difference is lost to a community, which, instead of manu-  
facturing for itself, procures the fabrics requisite to its supply from other  
countries. Zhe substitution of foreign for domestic manufactures is a  
transfer to foreign nations of the advantages accruing from the employ-  
ment of machinery, in the modes in which it ts capable of being employed,  
with most utility and to the greatest extent.  
  
“The cotton mill invented in England, within the last twenty years, is  
a signal illustration of the general proposition, which has been just advanced.”

find his proper element, and can call into activity the whole vigor

of its respective members, in the manner in which each can
