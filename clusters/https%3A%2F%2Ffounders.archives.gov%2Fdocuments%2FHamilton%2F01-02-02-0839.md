]  
  
I wrote you last night the inclosed hasty note in expectation that your papa would take his leave of us this morning early; a violent storm in which our house is tumbling about our ears prevents him. He and Meade are propping the house (I mean the Marquis), and I sit down to indulge the pleasure I always feel in writing to you.  
The little song you sent me I have read over and over. It is very pretty and contains precisely those sentiments I would wish my betsey to feel, and she tells me it is an exact copy of her heart. You seem by sympathy to have anticipated the inquiries I made in one of mine lately, and to have answered them all by this little song; a pretty method indeed when I am asking a set of sober questions, of the greatest importance, to answer me with a song. I confess however that they scarcely deserved a better and that if you should in reality refer me to your song, I shall be very well served. For after all the proofs I have of your tenderness and readiness to share every kind of fortune with me it is a presumptuous diffidence of your heart to propose the examination I did. But be assured My angel it is not a diffidence of my betsey’s heart, but of a female heart, that dictated the questions. I am ready to believe everything in favour of yours; but am restrained by the experience I have had of human nature, and of the softer part of it. Some of your sex possess every requisite to please delight, and inspire esteem friendship and affection; but there are too few of this description. We are full of vices. They are full of weaknesses; though I will not agree with the poet that they are, “Matter too soft, a lasting mark to bear. And best distinguished by black brown or fair.” Nor will I join in the exclamation of Adam against the Creators having formed woman, “a fair defect of nature.” Yet I have reason to think that these portraits are applicable to too many of the sex; and though I am satisfied, whenever I trust my senses and my judgment that you are one of the exceptions, I cannot forbear having moments when I feel a disposition to make a more perfect discovery of your temper, and character. In one of those moments I wrote the letter in question.  
Do not however I entreat you suppose that I entertain an ill opinion of all your sex. I have a much worse of my own. I have seen more of yours that merited esteem and love, but the truth is, My Dear girl, there are very few of either that are not very worthless. You know my sentiments on this head. I think I have found a precious jewel. I pray you do not think your sex injured and undertake to be their champion; for it will be taking an unfair advantage of your influence over me.  
We have been fortunate of late

‘*T wrote you last night the inclosed hasty  
note, in expectation that your papa would take  
his leave of us early. A violent storm, in which  
our house is tumbling about our ears, prevents  
him. He and M—— are propping up our house  
—I mean the marquée—while I sit down to in-  
dulge in the pleasure I always feel in writing to  
you.  
  
‘* The little song you sent me I have read  
over and over. It is very pretty, and contains  
precisely those sentiments I would wish my Mag- |  
gie to feel, and she tells me it is an exact copy  
of her heart. You seem by sympathy to have |  
anticipated the inquiries I made in one of mine  
lately, and to have answered them all by a little  
song; a pretty method, indeed, when I am ask-  
ing sober questions of the greatest importance,  
to answer me with a song! I confess, however,  
that they scarcely deserved a better, and that, if  
you should in reality refer me to your song, I  
shall be very well served. For, after all the  
proofs I have of your tenderness and readiness  
to share every kind of fortune with me, it is a  
presumptuous diffidence of your heart to propose  
the examination I did. But be assured, my an-  
gel, it is not a diffidence of my Maggie’s heart,  
but of a female heart, that dictated the questions ;  
I am ready to believe everything in favor of  
yours, but am restrained by the experience I have |  
had of human nature, and of the softer part of  
it. Some of your sex possess every requisite to  
please, delight, and to inspire esteem, friend-  
ship, and affection, but there are too few of this |  
description. We are full of vices—they are full |  
of weaknesses, though I will not agree with the  
poet that they are—  
  
* Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear,  
  
And best distinguished by black, brown, or fair.’  
Nor will I join in the exclamation of Adam  
against the Creator&#x27;s having formed woman ‘a  
fair defect of Nature;’ I have reason to think  
these portraits are applicable to too many of the  
sex ; and, though I am satisfied, whenever I trust  
  
my senses and my judgments, that you are one |  
  
of the exceptions, I cannot forbear having mo-  
ments when I feel a disposition to make a more  
perfect discovery of your temper and character.  
In one of those moments I wrote the letter in  
question.  
  
that I entertain an ill opinion of all your sex—I  
have a much worse of my own! I have seen  
more women who merited esteem and love than  
men ; but the truth is, my dear girl, there are  
very few of either who are not worthless, you  
know my sentiments on this head. I think I  
have found a precious jewel in you. Pray do  
not think your sex injured and become their  
champion, for it will be taking an unfair ad-  
vantage of your influence over me.  
  
‘* Have you heard anything more about Peg-  
  
gy?  
  
‘When she returns give my love to her, and |  
  
tell her I expected she would have outstripped  
you in the hymeneal line.  
‘* Adieu, my love ; all angels guard you !
