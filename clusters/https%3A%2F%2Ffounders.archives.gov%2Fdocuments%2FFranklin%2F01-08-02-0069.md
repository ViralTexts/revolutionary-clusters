The authors cite Newton’s theory of an all-pervading “fluid” called “aether,” which is “much rarer within the dense Bodies of the Sun, Stars, Planets, and Comets, than in the empty celestial space between them,” and becomes denser the farther away it gets from these bodies. By causing each body to try to go “from the denser parts of the aether towards the rarer,” this aether causes g

74. How is it found that any of it returns in again? If any of it remains out, how does it appear that it forms an Atmosphere round the Body?  
75–77. When the single bar was electrified plus, there was enough fluid to electrify two bars applied at its other end; it follows that when a single bar is electrified plus by itself and continues so after the tube is withdrawn, the expelled fluid similarly forms an atmosphere around the bar. Therefore, whenever a body is electrified either plus or minus and remains so after the experiment is over, there are “similar atmospheres of the electrical fluid” surrounding them, ready to expand into any approaching body less resistant than air. This is why “bodies give very nearly the same signs” when electrified either plus or minus.  
77. How does it appear that the Atmospheres surrounding Bodies electrified plus and minus, are similar? If they are both plus Atmospheres, how do they destroy each other on being brought together?  
78–80. I say “very nearly” the same signs because on accurate observation there are enough differences to enable us to say which bodies are electrified plus and which minus. Consider the different circumstances the fluid is in around a body electrified plus or minus. When a bar is electrified plus the electrical atmo

It will gradually flow into the bar and restore its “natural degree of density.” Only while this is going on will the bar remain electrified minus.

When an excited tube is brought under them as before, they will come nearer together, because air resistance cannot prevent the electrical fluid escaping from the balls electrified plus and creating an atmosphere around them. Then, the excited tube, acting “in concert with the air,” forces this atmosphere back into the balls [par. 92]. This appearance will continue as long as the bar-and-ball combination can be increasingly electrified plus by the tube; when the tube is withdrawn the balls will repel each other more forcibly than before because of their increased electrification.

m this that in the first experiment [see above, pars. 37–63], if the tube had been brought nearer and nearer to the mid-point of the tapered bar and finally made to touch it, the bar would have been electrified plus (instead of minus). Testing proves this conclusion correct. There must therefore be some middle distance at which the tube, instead of electrifying the bar either minus or plus reduces it to its natural unelectrified state. “This would appear a most amazing paradox … to any one, who did not know that bodies were capable of being electrified plus and minus,” that is, that the same excited tube brought towards the bar first electrifies it, then ceases to electrify it, and finally electrifies it again.  
103–109. The cork-ball experiment is also useful to prove that the power of the excited tube (or other electrifying machine) to electrify bodies at a certain distance is limited. The comparative force with which the balls repel each other provides an index to the degree of electrification of the bar to which they are attached. Hang the balls at the end of the bar and bring the excited tube to the middle of it at a distance to electrify it minus. However long it is kept at that distance

Now take the air-exhausted glass tube off the air pump and have a person grasp it by the brass end while standing on the ground. Let another person bring an excited tube near the outer surface, say near to the hermetically sealed end.

fter the wires are removed one may touch either covering without producing more than very slight signs of electrification. But if one touches both covers at once with fingers of different hands “he will receive so severe a stroke, as will convince him that the glass was very strongly electrified.” It is certainly true that as much fluid is thrown out at the under surface into the finger as was thrown into it at the upper surface from the wire; “but the reasoning upon this fact is evidently false, as it contradicts experiment.”  
166–173. Can our doctrine of resistances help us resolve this difficulty? Suppose we give the resistance of each surface of the glass the numerical value of six, and the power of the electrifying machine the value of nine. Electrical fluid will be forced into the glass with the net force of three and condensed there to that force and no more. It

curing in the electrification of glass, but I stop here with a mere caution not to carry too far the comparison of the atmospheres on the electrified pane with those on the cork balls. We have seen that the variety in resistance to electrification of different bodies leads us to know why bodies act so differently in different situations according to the nature of the bodies they are contiguous to, and enables us to explain “the most amazing appearance of all,” that of the Leyden bottle. Our success so far encourages us to inquire where this resistance is exerted and from what power within the body it arises. We know by experiment that every body resists electrification, though some do it with greater force than others. We may reasonably conclude that resistance to the entry of electrical fluid is exerted at the surface where the attack is made, but resistance to the fluid’s exit is exerted at all internal surfaces at once, and if the force at any point is greater than the resistance there, then it will always enter or leave at that point.  
215–220. There is an exact analogy to this resistance in the resistance of glass to the entrance of light at one surface and to its going out at the opposite surface; at both surfaces their resistance drives off great numbers of rays that might otherwise have passed through. The rays reflected back into the glass in their endeavor to get out are again resisted when they return to the first surface. Newton has shown that this force of resistance begins to operate on rays of light before they arrive in contact with either surface. We have reason to believe that the resistance to electrification, either plus or minus, of all bodies is of the same nature as that which not only prevents the entrance and exit of rays of light but throws them off with the same velocity with which they tried to enter or leave, and that the two kinds of resistance probably arise from the same cause. The experiments in Newton’s Optics serve greatly to confirm this opinion, and we have tried to establish it by electrical experiments.

“Let a person standing on wax electrify a tube, and let another person standing on the ground take as many snaps, as he can from the tube.” Soon he can get no more. But if, when this happens, the person on the wax sets one foot on the ground and keeps it there, the other person “may take snaps from morning to night, if he pleases.” The following conclusions may be drawn: 1. The person standing on the wax has “naturally” a quantity of the electrical fluid in him, which in the experiment is thrown into the other person on the ground. 2. But the person on the wax has only a limited quantity of the fluid. 3. Therefore, the cause of the fluid’s passing out and causing the snap is that the fluid is condensed in the hand which touches the tube in rubbing it, and so long as this condensation can be made with a degree of force superior to the resistance against escape, it will continue to produce snaps. 4. The person standing on the ground must be considered as one body with the earth and will not be sensibly electrified however many snaps he takes [229]. 5. When the person on the wax touches his foot to the ground, he too becomes one body with the earth and the degree of density in his body cannot be sensibly altered however

 enough to balance every power endeavoring to electrify it beyond a certain degree; otherwise it might be electrified without limit. It is this atmosphere surrounding bodies when artificial force electrifies them that resists their being electrified more, and when it absolutely prevents such electrification, it must be equally as strong as the electrical fluid flowing from the excited tube or machine.  
234. All Fluids naturally seek an Equilibrium. If the Body electrified receives no more after a certain Quantity, is it not owing to an Incapacity, in the Globe, of having more than a certain Quantity at one Time on its surface, rather than to any Resistance in the Atmosphere already communicated? Increase the Surface of the Body electrified, and you may give it an Additional Quantity from the Globe ad infinitum.  
235–239. “In the ordinary and quiet manner, in which the imperceptible works of the Author of nature are carried on” this subtile, active, all-pervasive electrical fluid cannot be idle, but must be in constant, if imperceptible, action; i.e., it must be electrifying all bodies plus or minus, though not forcibly enough to give sensible signs of it. We may conclude therefore that all bodies have surrounding electrical atmospheres sufficient to balance the smaller force attacking them. In these atmospheres is placed the power which occasions the resistance to the bodies being electrified to a higher degree. That power is the elasticity of the electrical fluid—everywhere dispersed when “gross bodies” are not in the way, but likewise confined within bodies according to their different situations and neighborhood to other bodies. These atmospheres may be increased or diminished to a certain degree by art, and when this is done with violence “the natural contexture of the bodies is altered in proportion to the violence.” Thus we see, even with the small force of our electrical machines, not only bodies parting with their natural share of the fluid, but of many of their component particles, “which may be perceived by the smell they yield on being electrified, and the rays of light they throw out, which, mixing with the air, occasions real Fire.”

Wax resists electrification perhaps as much as glass, certainly more than metals when its surface is smooth and polished; it can be melted with a small degree of heat, so its atmospheres are readily brought down to the same degree of rarity as those of metals and when heated only by friction it seems to become an electrical conductor.

Place a glass globe so as to communicate with one end of a metal bar suspended by silk strings and a sulfur globe to communicate with the other end of the bar.

Set on glass an electrified Leyden bottle that has a hook in its coating; attach a clean chain to the hook; let a person grasp the coating with one hand and with the other hand bring the other end of the chain, and his finger and thumb that holds it, into contact with the wire of the bottle. There will be two possible courses for the electrical fluid to pass from the wire to the coating: the person’s body or the chain. If the links of the chain hang loosely the person feels the shock; if the chain is stretched taut the fluid will pass through it and he will feel no shock, however long the chain may be. It follows that the electrical fluid does not always pass from one body to another by the shortest way, but by the way of the least resistance, even if that is more roundabout.

If the chain alone forms the communication and is spread on the table so loosely that the links barely touch each other, not only will there be a spark at the end where the chain touches the wire, but if the room is dark, a number of sparks will appear at places where the links do not absolutely touch each other.

When the links were forced into contact with each other the chain acted as a single piece of metal and no such series of resistances arose, the person holding it was not affected on the discharge of the bottle, and no sparks appeared between the links.

Now we have three ways of discharging the bottle: the person, the chain, and the wire. We find that the fluid does not go through the person: he feels no shock.

. From all these observations and experiments we conclude that the power which produces resistance to electrification, either plus or minus, “is the elasticity of these small atmospheres of the electrical fluid, which are formed at all their surfaces by the action between the particles of this fluid (both within and without bodies) and the component particles of the bodies: and therefore must be different at the surfaces of different bodies.”

cited tube, and grows denser until at the limit of the tube’s influence it returns to its natural state. Any light body within this distance will be forced from the denser to the rarer part of the fluid surrounding the tube, but when in its approach it becomes sufficiently electrified to have an atmosphere around it similar to that of the tube, it will be driven back again. Whenever afterwards it comes near any body more easily electrified than itself and communicating with the ground, its electrical atmosphere will be dissipated and it will immediately return to the tube as before.  
275–278. From all the above experiments it appears that the electrical fluid is as universal and powerful an agent at or near the earth’s surface as that fluid Newton calls aether. It is as subtle and elastic, it similarly pervades the pores of all bodies, is dispersed through whatever vacuum we can create, and from the appearance of thunder and lightning seems to be extended to great distances in the air. “We shall make no scruple therefore now to affirm, that these two fluids are one and the same fluid.’ It is much more philosophical to do so than to suppose two such fluids equally present everywhere and equally capable of producing the same effects. The word electrical is much too confining a meaning for so universal an activity as this is found to be. “Electricity means no more than the power we give bodies by rubbing them, to attract and repell light bodies” near them, as amber does when rubbed. This fluid not only does so but it heats them by putting their component particles and the particles of light and air within them into vibration, “and makes them throw out the rays of light that before lay hid,” and part with their sulfurous and volatile particles which, with the rays of light, on mixing with the air, “burst out into sparks of real culinary fire,” as the chemists call it. Furthermore, in passing through animals it occasions convulsions, tremors, pain, and sometimes death, and it even fuses glass and gold into an enamel.  
278. What is meant by Rays of Light that before lay hid? See, 240, 283, 286, 288, 289.  
279–301. It is as improper to call this fluid “fire” as it is to call air “sound.” When sound is produced the particles of air are put into vibrations which convey the idea of sound through the ear. So when this fluid throws the particles of a body into such agitations in the air that it grows hot, shines, glows, and is consumed away, we say the body is on fire, but this fluid is not fire, nor can fire indeed be called a Principle or Element in the chemist’s sense any more than sound can.

always paſs that way either in or out.  
And there is an appearance in glaſs that is exatly  
analogous to this, with regard to the reflection of the  
rays of light, by which it is evident, that a pane of glaſs: -  
reſiſts the entrance of light in at one ſurface; and when

entrance and exit of the rays of light in glaſs, but throws

perior to the force which endeavours to keep it out  
or in, at any place, or phyſical point of any of its  
ſurfaces, it muſt make its way more eaſily there, and  
conſequently will always paſs that way either in or  
out.  
  
And there is an appearance in glaſs that is exactly  
analogous to this, with regard to the reflection of  
the rays of light; by which it is evident, that a pane  
of glaſs reſiſts the entrance of light in at one ſur-  
face ; and when it has got in, it as ſtrongly reſiſts  
its going out at the oppoſite ſurface, becauſe at both  
theſe ſurfaces it reflects or drives off great numbers  
of rays, that without ſuch reſiſtance would have  
paſſed readily through the pane of glaſs.  
  
It is likewiſe known, that the rays reflected thus  
back into the glaſs, upon their endeavour to get out,  
and returned again to the firſt ſurface through  
  
which they had once got, meet again with an equal  
reſiſtance there to their paſſing out, and are many of  
them reflected into the glaſs again.  
  
It is ſhewn farther by Sir Iſaac Newton, that this  
force begins to exert itſelf on the rays of light be-  
fore they arrive into contact with either of theſe ſur-  
aces. | IN |

or minus, is of the ſame nature with that which  
  
not only prevents the entrance and exit of the rays  
  
of light in glaſs, but throws them off with the  
  
ſame velocity, great as it is, with which they en-  
deavour to get into it, or out of it; and therefore  
  
moſt probably ariſes from the fame cauſe.  
  
And conſequently, that this reſiſtance in bodies

are attacked; every way ſimilar to the perceptible  
atmoſpheres, at the ſurfaces of bodies electrified  
forcibly, either by art, or the violent exploſions in  
nature.  
  
In theſe atmoſpheres, which ſurround the ſur-  
faces of all bodies, is placed the power, which oc-  
caſions the reſiſtance found experimentally to be  
made againſt thoſe bodies being electrified to a higher  
degree than they are naturally, before we attempt  
to electrify them perceptibly to our ſenſes : and the  
power is the elaſticity of this ſubtile electrical fluid,  
every where diſperſed indeed, where groſs bodies are  
out of the way, but likewiſe confined within bodies  
differently, according to their - different ſituations  
and neighbourhood to other bodies.  
  
And theſe atmoſpheres may be encreaſed, or di-  
miniſhed, to a certain degree, many ways by art;  
and when this is done with violence, the natural con-  
texture of the bodies is altered in proportion to the  
violence.  
  
But to make it ſtill plainer that the reſiſtance to  
electrification is made at the ſurfaces of bodies, I  
will ſhew in the following very curious experiments,  
that the electrical fluid, in paſſing from one body to  
another will always take that way, in which it meets  
with the feweſt ſurfaces to break through. ;  
Let a Leyden bottle, that has a hook in its coat-  
  
ing, be electrified and ſet down on glaſs, and left to.  
. itſelf.  
  
[ 45 ]  
  
itſelf, Let one end of a clean chain (ſuch an one as  
is commonly uſed for a jack, but rather lighter) be  
fixed on to the hook in the coating ; and let a perſon  
graſp the coating of the bottle with one hand, and  
with the other hand bring the other end of the  
chain, and his finger and thumb that holds it, at the  
ſame time into contact with the wire of the bottle.  
Here then are two ways offered for the electrical  
fluid to paſs from the wire to the coating, either  
through the perſon or the chain : and if the links of  
the chain hang looſely on one another, it paſſes  
through the perſon, and he is ſhocked very nearly  
as much as if the chain was not there. But if the  
chain be ſtretched by any contrivance, ſo that its ;  
links are all brought nearer into contact with each  
other, the fluid will paſs through the chain, and the  
perſon will feel no ſhock at all: and this will be  
the caſe, let the chain be ever ſo long.  
  
Whence it follows, that the electric fluid does  
not always paſs from one body to another by the  
ſhorteſt way, but, on the contrary, it will go about,  
and paſs that way in which it meets with eat re-  
feftance. |  
  
Now if the chain alone forms the communication  
between the wire and the coating of the bottle, and.  
it is ſpread ſo on a table, that the links of it ſcarce ſeem  
to touch one another, there will not only be a ſpark  
ſeen on the approach of the end of the chain to the  
wire of the bottle; but a number of them will ap-  
  
| pear very viſibly when the experiment is made in  
the dark, v/2. at every place where the links do not  
abſolutely touch one another, But when the chain.

s at  
the different ſurfaces of the links, it was to break  
it&#x27;s way through in paſſing through the chain. Be-  
cauſe when the links were forced nearer into con-  
tact with each other, and ſo the whole chain was  
made, as it were, one continued metal, this re-  
ſiſtance is entirely taken off, the perſon is not at all  
affected on the diſcharge of the bottle, nor do any  
ſparks appear between the links.  
  
Now if the experiment be repeated in the follow-  
ing manner, this conſequence will be ſtill plainer.  
Let one end of a wire, even many times longer than  
the chain, be faſtened to the hook at the coating of  
the bottle, as well as the chain, and let a perſon  
graſping the bottle, as before, bring the other ends

chain lie looſe on the table ; or let the chain not be  
ſtretched. |  
  
Here are plainly three ways the electrical fluid  
may paſs on the diſcharge of the bottle, through the  
perſon, through the: chain, or through the wire:  
and the event of the experiment ſhows, that it does  
not paſs through the perſon, becauſe he feels no  
ſhock ; and that it does not paſs through the chain,  
becauſe no ſparks are ſeen between the links; and  
therefore that it paſſes through the wire, where it
