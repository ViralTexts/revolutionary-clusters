Philadelphia, Nov. 19, 1791.  
Population and Emigration.  
Both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, every species derives from nature, a reproductive faculty beyond the demand for merely keeping up its stock: the seed of a single plant is sufficient to multiply it one hundred or a thousand fold. The animal offspring is never limited to the number of its parents.  
  
The multiplying power in some instances, animal as well as vegetable, is astonishing. An annual plant of two seeds produces in 20 years, 1,048,576; and there are plants which bear more than 40,000 seeds. The roe of a Codfish is said to contain a million of eggs; mites will multiply to a thousand in a day; and there are viviparous flies which produce 2000 at once. See Stillingfleet and Bradley’s philosophical account of nature.  
  
  
This ordinance of nature is calculated, in both instances, for a double purpose. In both, it ensures the life of the species, which, if the generative principle had not a multiplying energy, would be reduced in number by every premature destruction of individuals, and by degrees would be extinguished altogether. In the vegetable species, the surplus answers, moreover, the essential purpose of sustaining the herbivorous tribes of animals; as in the animal, the surplus serves the like purpose of sustenance to the carnivorous tribes. A crop of wheat may be reproduced by one tenth of itself. The remaining nine tenths can be spared for the animals which feed on it. A flock of sheep may be continued by a certain proportion of its annual increase. The residue is the bounty of nature to the animals which prey on that species.  
Man who preys both on the vegetable and animal species, is himself a prey to neither. He too possesses the reproductive principle far beyond the degree requisite for the bare continuance of his species. What becomes of the surplus of human life to which this principle is competent?  
It is either, 1st. destroyed by infanticide, as among the Chinese and Lacedemonians; or 2d. it is stifled or starved, as among other nations whose population is commensurate to its food; or 3d. it is consumed by wars and endemic diseases; or 4th. it overflows, by emigration, to places where a surplus of food is attainable.  
What may be the greatest ratio of increase of which the human species is susceptible, is a problem difficult to be solved; as well because precise experiments have never been made, as because the result would vary with the circumstances distinguishing different situations. It has been computed that under the most favorable circumstances possible, a given number would double itself in ten years. What has actually happened in this country is a proof, that nature would require for the purpose, a less period than twenty years. We shall be safe in averaging the surplus at five per cent.  
  
Emigrants from Europe, enjoying freedom in a climate similar to their own, increase at the rate of five per cent a year. Among Africans suffering or (in the language of some) enjoying slavery in a climate similar to their own, human life has been consumed in an equal ratio. Under all the mitigations latterly applied in the British West-Indies, it is admitted that an annual decrease of one per cent. has taken place. What a comment on the African trade!  
  
  
According to this computation, Great Britain and Ireland, which contain about ten millions of people, are capable of producing annually for emigration, no less than five hundred thousand; France, whose population amounts to twenty five millions, no less than one million two hundred and fifty thousand; and all Europe, stating its numbers at one hundred and fifty millions, no less than seven and a half millions.  
It is not meant that such a surplus could, under any revolution of circumstances, suddenly take place: yet no reason occurs why an annual supply of human, as well as other animal life, to any amount not exceeding the multiplying faculty, would not be produced in one country, by a regular and commensurate demand of another. Nor is it meant that if such a redundancy of population were to happen in any particular country, an influx of it beyond a certain degree ought to be desired by any other, though within that degree, it ought to be invited by a country greatly deficient in its population. The calculation may serve, nevertheless, by placing an important principle in a striking view, to prepare the way for the following positions and remarks.  
First. Every country, whose population is full, may annually spare a portion of its inhabitants, like a hive of bees its swarm, without any diminution of its number: nay, a certain portion must, necessarily, be either spared, or destroyed, or kept out of existence.  
  
The most remarkable instances of the swarms of people that have been spared without diminishing the parent stock, are the colonies and colonies of colonies among the antient Greeks. Miletum, which was itself a colony, is reported by Pliny, to have established no less than eighty colonies, on the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the Euxine. Other facts of a like kind are to be found in the Greek historians.  
  
  
Secondly. It follows, moreover, from this multiplying faculty of human nature, that in a nation, sparing or losing more than its proper surplus, the level must soon be restored by the internal resources of life.  
Thirdly. Emigrations may even augment the population of the country permitting them. The commercial nations of Europe, parting with emigrants, to America, are examples. The articles of consumption demanded from the former, have created employment for an additional number of manufacturers. The produce remitted from the latter, in the form of raw materials, has had the same effect—whilst the imports and exports of every kind, have multiplied European merchants and mariners. Where the settlers have doubled every twenty or twenty-five years, as in the United States, the encrease of products and consumption in the new country, and consequently of employment and people in the old, has had a corresponding rapidity.  
Of the people of the United States, nearly three millions are of British descent.  
  
Irish is meant to be included.  
  
The British population has notwithstanding increased within the period of our establishment. It was the opinion of the famous Sir Josiah Child, that every man in the British colonies found employment, and of course, subsistence, for four persons at home. According to this estimate, as more than half a million of the adult males in the United States equally contribute employment at this time to British subjects, there must at this time be more than two millions of British subjects subsisting on the fruits of British emigrations. This result, however, seems to be beyond the real proportion. Let us attempt a less vague calculation.  
The value of British imports into the United States including British freight, may be stated at about fifteen millions of dollars, Deduct two millions for foreign articles coming through British hands; there remain thirteen millions. About half our exports, valued at ten millions of dollars, are remitted to that nation. From the nature of the articles, the freight cannot be less than three millions of dollars; of which about one fifth  
  
This is stated as the fact is, not as it ought to be. The United States are reasonably entitled to half the freight, if, under regulations perfectly reciprocal in every channel of navigation, they could acquire that share. According to Lord Sheffield, indeed, the United States are well off, compared with other nations; the tonnage employed in the trade with the whole of them, previous to the American Revolution, having belonged to British subjects, in the proportion of more than eleven twelfths. In the year 1660, other nations owned about ¼; in 1700 less than 1/6; In 1725 1/19; in 1750 1/12; in 1774, less than that proportion. What the proportion is now, is not known. If such has been the operation of the British navigation law on other nations, it is our duty, with enquiring into their acquiescence in its monopolizing tendency, to defend ourselves against it, by all the fair and prudent means in our power.  
  
being the share of the United States, there is to be added to the former remainder; two millions four hundred thousand. The profit accruing from the articles as materials or auxiliaries for manufactures, is probably at least fifty per cent, or five millions of dollars.  
  
This is admitted to be a very vague estimate. The proportion of our exports which are either necessaries of life, or have some profitable connection with manufactures, might be pretty easily computed. The actual profit drawn from that proportion is a more difficult task; but if tolerably ascertained and compared with the proportion of such of our imports as are not for mere consumption, would present one very interesting view of the commerce of the United States.  
  
The three sums make twenty millions four hundred thousand dollars; call them in round numbers twenty millions. The expence of supporting a labouring family in Great-Britain, as computed by Sir John Sinclair, on six families containing thirty-four persons, averages £:4:12:10½ sterling, or about twenty dollars a head. As his families were of the poorer class, and the subsistence a bare competency, let twenty-five per cent. be added, making the expence about twenty five dollars a head, dividing twenty millions by this sum, we have eight hundred thousand for the number of British persons whose subsistence may be traced to emigration for its source: or allowing eight shillings sterling a week, for the support of a working man, we have two hundred sixteen thousand three hundred forty-five of that class, for the number derived from the same source.  
This lesson of fact, which merits the notice, of every commercial nation, may be enforced by a more general view of the subject.  
The present imports of the United States, adding to the first cost, &amp;c. one half the freight as the reasonable share of foreign nations, may be stated at twenty-five millions of dollars. Deducting five millions on account of East-India articles, there remain in favour of Europe, twenty millions of dollars. The foreign labour incorporated with such part of our exports as are subjects or ingredients for manufactures, together with half the export freight, is probably not of less value than fifteen millions of dollars. The two sums together make thirty-five millions of dollars, capable of supporting two hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three families of six persons in each: or three hundred seventy-eight thousand six hundred and five men, living on eight shillings sterling a week.  
The share of this benefit, which each nation is to enjoy, will be determined by many circumstances. One that must have a certain and material influence, will be, the taste excited here for their respective products and fabrics. This influence has been felt in all its force by the commerce of Great-Britain, as the advantage originated in the emigrations from that country to this; among the means of retaining it, will not be numbered a restraint on emigrations. Other nations, who have to acquire their share in our commerce, are still more interested in aiding their other efforts, by permitting, and even promoting emigrations to this country, as fast as it may be disposed to welcome them. The space left by every ten or twenty thousand emigrants will be speedily filled by a surplus of life that would otherwise be lost. The twenty thousand in their new country, calling for the manufactures and productions required by their habits, will employ and sustain ten thousand persons in their former country, as a clear addition to its stock. In twenty or twenty-five years, the number, so employed and added, will be twenty thousand. And in the mean time, example and information will be diffusing the same taste among other inhabitants here, and proportionally extending employment and population there.  
Fourthly. Freedom of emigration is due to the general interests of humanity. The course of emigrations being always, from places where living is more difficult, to places where it is less difficult, the happiness of the emigrant is promoted by the change: and as a more numerous progeny is another effect of the same cause, human life is at once made a greater blessing, and more individuals are created to partake of it.  
The annual expence of supporting the poor in England amounts to more than one million and a half sterling.  
  
From Easter 1775 to Easter 1776, was expended the sum of £.1,556,804:6–3 sterling. See Anderson vol. 5. p. 275. This well informed writer conjectures the annual expence to be near £.2,000,000 sterling. It is to be regretted that the number and expence of the poor in the United States cannot be contrasted with such statements. The subject well merits research, and would produce the truest eulogium on our country.  
  
The number of persons, subsisting themselves not more than six months in the year, is computed at one million two hundred sixty eight thousand, and the number of beggars at forty eight thousand. In France, it has been computed that seven millions of men women and children live one with another, on twenty-five livres, which is less than five dollars a year. Every benevolent reader will make his own reflections.  
Fifthly. It may not be superfluous to add, that freedom of emigration is favorable to morals. A great proportion of the vices which distinguish crouded from thin settlements, are known to have their rise in the facility of illicit intercourse between the sexes, on one hand, and the difficulty of maintaining a family, on the other. Provide an outlet for the surplus of population, and marriages will be increased in proportion. Every four or five emigrants will be the fruit of a legitimate union which would not otherwise have taken place.  
Sixthly. The remarks which have been made, though in many respects little applicable to the internal situation of the United States, may be of use as far as they tend to prevent mistaken and narrow ideas on an important subject. Our country being populated in different degrees in different parts of it, removals from the more compact to the more spare or vacant districts are continually going forward—The object of these removals is evidently to exchange a less easy for a more easy subsistence. The effect of them must therefore be to quicken the aggregate population of our country. Considering the progress made in some situations towards their natural complement of inhabitants, and the fertility of others, which have made little or no progress, the probable difference in their respective rates of increase is not less than as three in the former to five in the latter. Instead of lamenting then a loss of three human beings to Connecticut, Rhode-Island, or New-Jersey, the Philanthropist, will rejoice that five will be gained to New-York, Vermont or Kentucky; and the patriot will be not less pleased that two will be added to the citizens of the United States.

Population and Esmigration.  
OTH in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, every f{pecies derives, from  
nature, a reproductive faculty, beyond the demand for merely keeping up  
its ftock : the feed of a fingle plant is fufficient to multiply it one hundred or a  
thouiand fold. The animal offspring is never limited to the number of its  
parents*.  
  
This ordinance of nature is calculated, in both inftances, for a double purpofe,  
In both, it infures the life of the fpecies, which, if the generative principle had  
nota multiplying energy, would be reducedim number, by every premature de-  
ftru€tion of individuals ; and by degrees would be extinguifned altogether. In  
the vegetable fpecies, the firplus anfwere, moreover, the effential purpofe of  
fuftaining the herbivorous tribes of aninsals ; as in the animal, the furplus ferves  
the like purpofe of fultenance to the carnivorous tribes. A crop of wheat may  
be reproduced by one tenth of itfelf. The remaining nine tenths can be ipared  
for the animals which feed on it. A ftock of fheep may be continued by a cer-  
tain proportion of its annual increafe. The refidue is the bounty ef nature te  
the animals which prey on that fpecies.  
  
Man, who preys both on the vegetable and animal fpecies, 13 him{elf a prey  
to neither. He, too, poffeffes the reproduétive principle far beyond the degree  
requifite for the bare continuance of his fpecies.—What becomes of the furplus  
of human life, to which this principle is competent ?  
  
Itis either, rf. deftroyed by infanticide, as among the Chinefe and Lacede-  
monians; or 2d, it is ftifled or ftarved, as among other nations whofe populati.  
on is commenfurate toits food; or 3d. it is confumed by wars and endemic dif.  
eafes; or 4th, it overflows, by emigration, to places where a furpius of fuod is  
attainable.  
  
What may be the greateft ratio of increafe, of which the human fpecies ig  
{ufceptible, is a problem difficult to be folved ; as well becaute precife experi,  
ments have never been made, as becaufe the refult would vary with the circum,  
ftsnces diftinguifhing different fituations. It has been computed, that under  
the moft favourable circumftances poffible, agiven number would double itfel  
inter years. What has actually happened inthis country, is a proof, that na-  
ture would require for the purpefe, a lefs period thantwenty years. We tall  
be fafe in averaging the furplus at five per centt.  
  
According to this computation, Great Britain and Ireland, which contain a-  
bout ten millions af people, are capable of producing annually, for emigration,  
no lefs than five hundred thoufand; France, whofe population amounts totwer«  
ty-five millions, no lefs than one million two hundred and fifty thoufand; and

feven and a half millions.

* The multiplying power, in fome isftances, animal as well as vegetable,  
is aftonifhing. An annual plant, of two feeds, produces in 20 years, 1,048,576,  
and there are plants which bear more than 49,000 feeds. The roe of a codfiih  
is faid to contain a miliion of eggs. Mites will multiply to a thoufandina

ftances, fuddenly take place: yet no reafon occurs, why an annual fupply of  
human, as weilas other animal life, to any amount, not exceeding the multiply.  
ing facuity, would not be produced in one country, by a regular and commen.  
{urate demand of another. Nor is it meant, that if juch a redundancy ef po.  
pulation were to happen in any particular country, an influx of it beyond a  
Certain degice, ought to be defired by any other ; though within that degree, it  
Ought to be invited by a country greatly deficient in its population, The cal-  
culation may ferve, neverthelefs, by placing an important principle in a ftriking  
View, to prepare the way for the following pofitions and remarks.  
  
Firk. Every country, whofe population is full, may annually {pare a portion  
of its inhabitants, like a hive of bees its {warm, without any diminution of its  
number; nay, a certain portion muft, neceffariiy, be either ipared, or dettroy~  
ed, or kept out of exiftence].  
  
Secondly. It follows, moreover, from this mu&#x27;tiplyiag faculty of human na-  
ture, that in anation, {pa-ing or lofing more than its proper furplus, the level  
muft {oon be reftored by the internal rcfources of life.  
  
Thirdly. Emigrations may even augment the population of the country per-  
mitting them. The commercial nations of Europe, parting with emigrants, to  
America, are examples. ‘The articles of confumption demanded from the form-  
er, have created employment for an additional number of manufacturers. The  
produce remitted from the latter, in the form of raw materials, has had the  
fame effeét—wiule the imports and exports of every kind, have multiplied Eu.  
ropean merchants and mariners. Where the fettlers have doubied every twenty  
or twenty five years, asin the united ftates, the increale of products and con-  
fumption in the new country, aud confequently of employment and people ia  
the old, has had a correfponding rapidity.  
  
Of the people of the united ftates, nearly three millions are of Br-tith def.  
eenti|. Ihe Britifh population has, notwitifianding, increafea wethin the peri-  
od ot our eftablifhment. It was the opinion of the famous fir Johah Child,  
that every man in the Britifh colonies found employment, and, of courle, fub-  
fittence, for four perfons at home. According to thts eftimate, as more than  
halia nuliion of the adult males in the united ilates equally covtribute employ-  
ment at this time to British fubieéis, there mutt atpreient be more than twe  
millions of Britith fubjeéts fubiitting on the fruits of British emigrations. This  
retult, however, fteems to be beyond the real proposition. Let us attempt aleis  
vague calculation.  
  
‘The value of Britith imports intothe united flates, inciuding Britith freight,  
may be ftoted at about fificen millions of dollavs, Dedu&amp; two millions tor te-  
vein articies coming through Britifh hands; there remain thirteen millions.  
About half our exports, valued at ten millions cf dollars,are remitted to that  
nation. From the nature of the articles, the freight cannot be lefs than three  
millions of dollars; of which, about one filca ® being the fhare of the united

half the freight, as the reafonable fhare of foreign nations, may he {tated at  
twenty-five millions of dollars. Dedutting five millions on accountof Eaft  
India articles, there remain, in favour of Europe, twenty millions of dollars,  
The foreign labour, incorporated with fuch parts of our exports, as are fubs  
jects or ingredients for mansfadiures, together with half the export freight, is  
probably not of lefs valuethan fifteen millions of dollars. The two fums tos

them. The fpace left by every tenor twenty thou(and emigrants will be {pee-  
dily filled by a furplus of life, that would otherwife be loft. The twenty  
theufand in their new country, calling for the manufactures and produétions  
required by their habits, will employ and fuftain ten thoufand perfons in  
their former couniry, as @ clear addition to its ftock, In twenty or twenty.  
five years, the number fo employed and added, will be twenty thoufand. And, in  
the mean time, example and information will be diffufing the fame tafte among  
ether inhabitants here, and proportionally extending employment and population  
there.  
  
Fourthly. Freedom of emigration is due to the general interefts of humanity,  
The courfe of emigratione being always, from places where living is more  
difficult, to places where it is lefs difficult, the happinefs of the emigrant is pro.  
moted by the change ; and as @ mere amumerous progeny is another effect of  
the fame caufe, human life ie at once made a greater blefling, and more indi-  
viduals are created to partake of it.  
  
The annual expenfe of fupporting the poor in England amounts tomore than  
ene million and a half fterling.® The number of perfons, fubfifling themfelves  
not more than fix months in the year, ie computed at one million two hundred  
fixty-eight thoufand, end the number of beggars at forty-eight thoufand. In  
France, it has been computed that feven millions ef men, women, and chil-  
dren, live, one with another, on twenty-five livres, which is lefs than five dol-  
lars, a year. Every benevolent reader will make his own reflexions.  
  
Fifthly. It may not be fuperfluous to add, that freedom of emigration is fae  
vourable to morals, A great proportion of the vices, which diftinguifh crouded  
from thin fettlements, are known to have their rife in the facility of illicit in-  
tercourfe between the fexes, on one hand, and the difficulty of maintaining  
a family, on the other. Provide an outlet for the furpius of population, and  
marriages will be increafed in proportion. Every four or five emigrants will be the  
caufe of a legitimate union, which would not otherwife have taken place.  
  
Sixthly. ‘The remarks which have been made, though in many refpeéts little  
applicable to the internal fituation of the united ftates, may be of ufe, as far  
as they tend to prevent miftaken and narrow ideas on that important fubjeé,  
Our country being populated in different degrees, in different parts of it, re-  
movals from the more compact, to the more {pare or vacant diftriéts, are cons  
tinually going forward. The obje&amp; of thefe removals is evidently to exchange  
a lefs eafy for a more eafy fubfiftence. The effe&amp;t of them mutt therefore be  
to quicken the aggregate population of our country. Confidering the progrefs  
made in fome fituations, towards their natural complement of inhabi:ants, and  
the fertility of others which have made little or no progrefs, the probable  
difference in their refpeétive rates of increafe, is not lefs than as three in the  
former to fivein the latter. Inftead of lamenting then a lofs of three human  
beings to Connecticut, Rhode Ifland, or New Jerfey, the philanthropift will re-  
joice that five will be gainedto New York, Vermont or Kentucky; and the  
patriot will be not lefs pleafed that two will be added to the citizens of the  
wnited itates

is fufficient to multiply it one hundrec

This ordinance of nature is calculated

in both, it enlures the life of the fpe  
c:es, which, if the generative principl  
had not a multiplying energy, would b  
reduced in number by every prematur  
deftruttion of individuals, and by de  
grees would be extinguished altogether  
In the vegetable species, the surplus an  
fwers, moreover, the eifential purpof*  
of luftaining the herbivorous tribes o

serves the like purpose of fuftcnance t&lt;

What may be the greatest ratio of :n­  
---creafe of which the human species is  
susceptible, is a problem difficult to be  
solved ; as well because precise experi­  
ments have never been made, asbecaule  
the result would vary with the circum­  
stances diltinguilhing different situati­

the most favorable circumstances pos­  
sible, a given number would double it­

happened in this country is a prOof, that  
nature would require for the pYnpole,  
a less period than twenty years. We

five per centt.  
According to this computation, Great  
Britain and Ireland, which contain a­

of producing annually for emigration,  
no lei&#x27;s than five hundred thousand ;  
France, whose population amounts to  
twenty-five millions, no less than one

stances, suddenly take place : yet no  
reason occurs why an annual supply of  
human, as well as other anirtal life, to  
any amount not exceeding the multi­  
plying faculty, would rot be producec  
in One country, by a regular and com  
menfurate demand of another. Nor i:  
it meant that if such a redundancy o  
population were to happen in any parti  
cular country, an influx of it beyond &lt;  
certain degree ought to be delired bv ast)  
nher, though within that degree, i  
ought to be invited by a country great  
y deficient in its population. The cal  
:ulation may serve, nevertheless, b\
placing an important principle in a flrik  
ng view, to prepare the way forthe sol  
owing positions and reinanks.  
First. Every country, whose popula  
ion is full; may annually spare a porti  
m of its inhabitants, like a hive of bee:  
ts swarm, without any diminution o  
is number : nay, a certain portion mull  
leceffarily, be either spared, ordeftroy  
d, or kept out of exiltencet.  
Secondly. It follows, moreover, frou  
his multiplying faculty of human na­  
me, that in a nation, sparing or loiins  
noire than its proper surplus, the leve  
nuft soon be reflored by the internal re­  
ources of life.  
Thirdly. Emigrations may even a g  
herit the population of the country per  
ratting them. The commercial nation:  
&gt;f Europe, pal ling with emigrants, u  
\tnerica, are examples. The article:  
ifconfumption demanded from the form  
:r, have created employment for an ad  
iitional number of man &lt;xrafturers. Thi  
jroduce remitted from the latter, in th&lt;  
orm of raw materials, has had the sam

itates, the encreafe of products and con  
umption in the new country, and con  
equently of employment and people ir  
he old, has had a corresponding. rapi  
lity.  
Of the people of the United States  
learly three millions are of British def­  
:ent||. The British population has not  
vithftanding Increaf&#x27;ed within the peri­  
od of oureftablifhment. It was the opi­  
lion of the famous fir Jofiah Child, thai  
:very man in theßritifh colonies fount  
■inployment, and of courl&#x27;e, Cubfiften.ce  
or four persons at home. According  
o this eftirnate, as more than half i  
nillion of the adult males in the United  
itates equally contribute employment  
it this time to British fuhjefts, there  
nuft at this time be more tiian two mil  
ions of British iubjefts subsisting o:  
he fruits of British emigrations. Thi:  
efult, however, f&#x27;eems to be beyend the  
eal proportion. Let us attempt a lei:  
/ague calculation.  
The value of British imports into the  
United States including British ireight  
may be ftaied at about fifteen millions o  
dollars. Deduct two millions for fo­  
cign articles coming through Britifl  
lands ; there remain thirteen millions  
About half ourexpoits, valued at ter

er remainder, two millions four hun­  
dred thousand. The profit accruing  
from the articles as materials or auxili­  
aries for manufactures, is probably.at  
lea $&#x27;fifty&#x27; per cent, or five millions or  
dollirs?. The three sums make twen­

tv millions.—The expence of support­  
ing a labouring family in Gteat-Britain,  
&gt;&gt;s computed by Sir John Sinclair,on fix  
families containing thirty-four persons,  
averages £ : 12: 10 | sterling, or about  
twenty dollars a head. As his families  
were! of the poorer class, and the subsist­  
ence a bare competency, let twenty-five  
per cent, be added, making the expence  
about twenty five dollars a head, divid­  
ing&quot; twenty millions by this sum, we  
have eight hundred thousand for the  
number of British persons whose subsist­  
ence may be traced to emigration for its

ling a week, for the support of a work­  
in:; man, we have two hundred sixteen  
thousand three hundred forty-five of  
that class, for the number derived from  
the fame source.  
This lelfon of fa£t, which merits the  
no&#x27;ice, of every commercial nation, may  
be enforced by a more general view of  
tir.- fubjeft.  
The present imports of the United  
States, adding to the firft cost, &amp;c. one  
half the freight as the reasonable (hare  
o&#x27;.&#x27;foreign nations, may beft.rtcd at twen­  
ty-five millions of dollars. Deducting  
five millions on account of Eaft-Iridra  
articles, there remain in favour of Eu­  
rope, twenty millions of dollars. &#x27;1 he  
fejeign labour incorporated with such  
tyj-t of our exports as arc fubje&amp;s or in­  
fWHSfts- for nianufa&amp;ures, together  
with half the export freight, is proba­  
bly not of less value than fifteen millions  
of dollars. The two sums together malic

milies of fix persons in each : or three  
hundred feventy-eightthoufand iix hun­

will be, the taste excited here sos their

nythe commerce of Great-Britain, as

twe&#x27;bty or twerity-fH&#x27;e years, the num­  
3cr, so employed and added, will be  
twenty thousand. And in tne nreau  
time, example and information will be  
diffufii?g the lame taste among other in­  
habitants here, and proportionally ex­  
ending employitidnt and population

Fourthly. Freedom 6f emigration is  
due to the general interests of humani­  
ty. The fcourfe of emigrations being  
tlwayS, from places where living ismoic  
difficult, to places where it is less difli­  
;uit, the happiness of the! emigrant is  
promoted by the change : and as a more  
mmeroui progeny is another effect of  
.lie fame cause, human life is at once  
nade a greater blelling, and more indi­  
viduals are created to partake of it.  
The annual expence of fuppoftiftg the  
lo&#x27;or in England amounts to more than  
;ne million and a half (lerling.* The  
lumber of persons, subsisting themselves  
lot more than lix months in the year, is  
romputeu at one million two hundred  
;xty eight thousand, and the number of  
DCggars at forty eight thousand. In  
France&#x27;, it has been computed that seven  
millions of men women and children  
ive one with another, on twenty-five  
ivres, which is less than live dollars a  
Every benevolent reader will&#x27;  
nake his Own reflections.  
Fifthly. It may not be fuperfluous to  
idd, that freedom of emigration is fa­  
vorable to morals, A great proportion  
&gt;f the vices which distinguish crouded  
from thin fettlemenrs, are known to  
nav&#x27;e their rife in the facility of illicit  
ntercQurfe between the fcxes, on one  
band; and the difficulty of maintaining  
i family, on the other, l rovide an out­  
let for the fufplus of population, and  
marriages will be increased in propor­  
tion. Every four or five emigrants will  
be the fruit of a legitimate union which  
would not otherwise have taken place.  
Sixthly. The remarks which have  
yeen made, though in many refpectts little  
ippliCable to tiie internal lituation of the  
United States, maybe of ufeasfar asthey

desired by any other, though within that degree, |  
it ought to be invited by a country greatly defi- |  
  
in a striking view, to prepare the way for the  
following positions and remarks :—  
  
First—Every country whose population is full |  
may annually spare a portion of its inhabitants, |  
like a hive of bees its swarm, without any dimi-|  
nution of its numbers; nay, a certain portion |  
must, necessarily, be either spared, or destroyed, |  
or kept out of existence.*  
  
Secondly—It follows, moreover, from this mul- |  
tiplying faculty of human nature, that in a nation

commercial nations of Europe, parting with emi- |  
grants to Americayare examples. The article of  
consumption demanded from the former have  
  
created employment for an additional number of  
manufacturers. The produce remitted from the |  
latter in the form of raw materials has had the |  
same effect, whilst the imports and exports of |  
every kind have multiplied European merchants |  
and mariners. Where the settlers have doubled |  
every twenty or twenty-five years, as in the)  
United States, the increase of products and con- |  
sumption in the new country, and consequently |  
of.employment and people in the old, has had a)  
corresponding rapidity.  
~ * &quot;The most remarkable instances of the swarms of  
people that have been spread without diminishing the  
  
parent stoek, are the colonies and colonies of colonies  
  
among the ancient Greeks. Miletum, which was it-  
  
self a colony, is reported by Pliny to have established |  
no less than eighty colonies on the Hellespont, the  
  
—- and the Euxine. Other facts of a like |  
kind are to be found in the Greek Historians,

The multiplying power in some in-

astonishing. An annual plant of two  
seeds produces, in 20 years, 1,048,576;  
and there are plants which bear more than  
40,000 seeds. The roe of a codfish is  
said to contain a million of eggs; mites

there are viviparous flies which produce  
2000 at once.

‘¢ Emigrations may even augment the population of the country  
permitting them. The commercial nations of Europe, parting  
with emigrants to America, are examples. The articles of con-  
sumption demanded by us from Europe have created employment  
for an additional number of manufacturers. The produce remit-  
ted by us, in the form of raw materials, has had the same effect;

British descent; according to this estimate, as more than half a  
million of the adult males in the United States equally contribute  
employment at this time to British subjects, there must now be  
more than 2,000,000 British subjects subsisting on the fruits of  
British emigration. . . . Thespace left by every ten or twenty  
thousand emigrants.is speedily filled by a surplus of life that  
would otherwise be lost. The 20,000 in their new country, calling  
for the manufactures and productions required by their habits, will  
employ and sustain 10,000 persons in their former country, as a clear  
addition to its population. The course of emigration being always  
from places where living is more difficult to places where it is less  
difficult, the happiness of the emigrant is promoted by the change ;  
and as a more numerous progeny is another effect of the same  
cause, human life is at once made a greater blessing, and more in-  
dividuals are created to partake of it.”
