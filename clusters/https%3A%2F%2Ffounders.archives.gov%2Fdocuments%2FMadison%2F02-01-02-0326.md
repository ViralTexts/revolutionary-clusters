As I could not mistake his Lordship’s object in speaking to me upon this subject, I had no difficulty nor reserve in expressing my private sentiments respecting it, taking for my text, the observation of Montesquieu, “that it is happy for trading Powers, that God has permitted Turks and Spaniards to be in the world since of all nations they are the most proper to possess a great Empire with insignificance.” The purport of what I said was, that we are content that the Floridas remain in the hands of Spain but should be unwilling to see them transferred except to ourselves.

Report of the King’s Advocate  
  
My Lord DukeLincoln’s Inn fields 23d. May 1801.  
I am honored with your Grace’s Letter of the 19th. Inst. transmitting to me several Papers which have been communicated to your Grace by Lord Hawkesbury, from his Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires in America with a direction to take them into consideration, and to report to your Grace, for His Majesty’s Information, my opinion, whether in consequence of what is contained in the extract of Mr. Thornton’s Letter to Lord Grenville, especially that part of it which states “a principle to have been lately adopted in the Courts of Vice-Admiralty at Jamaica and Providence, that no commerce would be permitted between a belligerent and neutral Nation in the Vessels of the latter but such as had been authorized previously to the commencement of hostilities” it would be adviseable to make any or what communications to the Vice-Admiralty Courts at Jamaica and the Bahamas for their guidance &amp; direction.  
  
In obedience to your Grace’s commands I have considered the Papers referred to me, and I have the honor to report that the principle stated to have been lately adopted in the Courts of Vice Admiralty at Jamaica and Providence, is directly in opposition to the decisions daily passing in the High Court of Admiralty, and the Court of Appeal. It has been held by the Tribunals of this Country, that Neutrals cannot be admitted by the Enemy, under the pressure of War, to carry on his Colonial Trade, from which in time of Peace they were wholly excluded. But this principle may be, and has been on account of special circumstances during the present Hostilities, to a certain degree relaxed.  
His Majesty’s Instructions of January 1798 only order that Vessels shall be brought in for legal Adjudication, which are coming directly from the Enemy’s Colonies to Europe, and not being bound to England or a Port of their own Country. A Trade between the Neutral Country and the Enemy’s Colonies is now clearly permitted. Colonial Produce, actually imported into the neutral Country, may also be re-exported from thence to any other place, even to the Mother-Country of that Colony of which it is the produce. His Majesty’s existing Instructions are therefore the rule by which at present the Judges of the Vice Admiralty Courts ought to govern themselves; and I humbly apprehend, that it would be adviseable to convey to the Courts referred to a direction to that effect; as the application of the more extended principle, upon which they are represented to act, may be productive, not only of much injustice but of great publick inconvenience. I have the honour to be &amp;ca.
