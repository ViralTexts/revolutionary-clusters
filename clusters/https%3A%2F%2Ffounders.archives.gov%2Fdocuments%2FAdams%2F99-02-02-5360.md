On the 6th of March a letter was written by the Secretary of State by my order, in the following words, to  
Mr. Murray:Philadelphia, March 6, 1799.  
Sir,I enclose a commission constituting you, in conjunction  
with the Chief Justice Elsworth and Patrick Henry, Esq.  
of Virginia, Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic.—By the President’s  
direction, I enclose for your information, copies of his  
Messages to the Senate of the 18th and 28th of March;  
(it should have been the 18th and 25th of February) by  
the latter of which you will see the motives inducing the  
nomination of a Commission for the purpose of negociating with France, instead of resting the business wholly  
with you. This will doubtless be agreeable, by relieving  
you from the weight of a sole responsibility in an affair of  
such magnitude.  
It is the President’s desire, that you by letter to the  
French Minister of foreign relations, inform him “that  
Oliver Elsworth, Chief Justice of the United States,  
Patrick Henry, late Governor of Virginia, and yourself  
are appointed Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United States to the French Republic, with full powers to discuss and settle by a Treaty, all controversies between the United States and France.”—But, “that the two former will not embark for Europe  
until they shall have received from the Executive Directory direct and unequivocal assurances, signified by their Secretary of foreign relations, that the Envoys  
shall be received in character, to an audience of the  
Directory, and that they shall enjoy all the prerogatives  
attached to that character by the law of nations, and  
that a Minister or Ministers of equal powers shall be  
appointed and commissioned to treat with them.”  
The answer you shall receive to your letter, you will  
be pleased to transmit to this office.  
You will also be pleased to understand it to be the President’s opinion, that no more indirect and inofficial Communications, written or verbal, should be held with any  
persons whatever, Agents on behalf of France, on the subjects of difference between the United States and the  
French Republic. If the French government really desire a settlement of the existing differences, it must take  
the course pointed out: unless the Executive Directory  
should prefer sending a Minister Plenipotentiary to the  
United States. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, / sir, your obedient servant,  
Timothy Pickering.Wm. Vans Murray, Esq.  
Minister of the U. States  
at the Hague.  
Mr. Murray obeyed these instructions by a letter in  
these words:—The Hague, 5th May, 1799.Citizen Minister,  
It is with the greatest pleasure that I hasten to fulfil the  
instructions, which I have just had the honor to receive  
from the government of the United States of America,  
by informing you that the President has appointed Oliver Elsworth, Chief Justice of the United States, Patrick  
Henry, late Governor of Virginia, and William Vans Murray, Minister resident of the United States at the Hague,  
to be Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary  
of the United States to the French Republic, with full  
powers to discuss and settle by a Treaty, all controversies  
between the United States and France; but that the two  
former, Mr. Elsworth and Mr. Henry will not embark  
for Europe until they shall have received from the Executive Directory, direct and unequivocal assurances, signified by their Minister of foreign relations, that the Envoys  
shall be received in character to an audience of the Directory, and that they shall enjoy all the prerogatives attached to that character by the law of nations, and that a  
Minister or Ministers of equal powers shall be appointed  
and commissioned to treat with them.I request you, Citizen Minister, to lay this subject before your government, and as the distance is so great,  
and the obstacles so numerous in an Atlantic voyage, that  
you will favor me, as speedily as possible, with the answer  
which is to lead to such happy and important consequences.  
Accept, Citizen Minister, the assurances of my perfect  
high esteem.  
(Signed) Wm. V. Murray.  
To the Citizen Talleyrand,Minister  
of the Exterior Relations of the French  
Republic, &amp;c. &amp;c. Paris.  
When Mr. Murray received the answer of the French  
Minister, he inclosed it, with the following letter from  
himself, to the Secretary of State:—The Hague, 7th of May, 1799.  
Dear Sir,  
On the 4th inst, late in the evening, I had the honor  
to receive your No. 22, containing the commission of envoys.  
On the fifth I addressed, precisely, agreeably to your  
instructions, as I conceived, the inclosed letter to Mr.  
Talleyrand, the minister of exterior relations. You will perceive, sir, that I did not think myself at liberty to go,  
not only not out of the commas, but beyond them. In  
one word alone I deviated, in the word minister, instead  
of secretary of foreign relations. No direct nor indirect  
and inofficial communications, written or verbal, will be  
held by me with the French agents on American affairs.  
I accept the appointment which it has pleased the President to clothe me with, under a grateful sense of the  
high honor conferred upon me, so unexpectedly, by this  
mark of his confidence. I may be allowed to say, that  
though I was deeply sensible of the honor conferred by  
the first nomination, and shall always, I hope, retain a  
most grateful recollection of it; yet, sir, the new modification of that nomination gave me great pleasure, always  
conceiving as I thought I did, that any negociation with  
France would be full of anxieties and political perils to  
the Envoys that should be employed by our government.  
I had no wishes to be engaged in it, and no expectation  
that I should be: To have a share in it was by me unsought: You will excuse this declaration, because I was  
instrumental in certain preliminary steps relative to the  
advances of France which produced the basis of the appointment.  
I sent the original of the inclosed to Mr. Talleyrand, by  
post; another, a copy, to Maj. Montflorence, to be handed to him; a third to a Mr. Griffith for Maj. M. in case  
the other failed, to be opened by Mr. G. if Maj. M. should  
have been out of Paris, and directed Mr. G. to follow  
the instructions which he would find in the letter to Maj.  
M. which were to deliver the inclosed to Mr. Talleyrand,  
and take his letter in answer for me, and send it to me.  
As soon as I have the answer of the Directory, I shall  
have the honor of transmitting copies to you, sir, by different ways.  
I am, with the greatest respect, and sincere esteem, dear  
sir, faithfully your most obedient servant,  
William V. Murray.  
The Hon. Timothy Pickering,  
Esq. Sec’ry of State, of the U.  
States of America.Paris, 23d Floreal, (12th May 1799)  
7th. year of the French Republic, one  
and indivisible.  
The Minister of Exterior Relations,  
  
To Mr. Wm. Vans Murray, Minister resident of the  
U. States at the Hague.  
  
  
I augur too well, sir, from the eagerness you display, in  
fulfilling the instructions of your government, not to hasten to answer the letter I received from you, dated the  
15th of this month.  
The Executive Directory being informed of the nomination of Mr.Oliver Elsworth, of Mr. Patrick Henry, and  
of yourself, as Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary of the United States to the French Republic,  
to discuss and terminate all differences which subsist between the two countries, sees with pleasure, that its perseverance in pacific sentiments has kept open the way to an  
approaching reconciliation. It has a long time ago manifested its intentions with respect to this subject. Be pleased to transmit to your Colleagues, and accept yourself,  
the frank and explicit assurance, that it will receive the  
Envoys of the United States, in the official character  
with which they are invested: that they shall enjoy all the  
prerogatives which are attached to it by the law of nations, and that one or more Ministers shall be authorised to  
treat with them.  
It was certainly unnecessary to suffer so many months  
to elapse for the mere confirmation of what I have already  
declared to Mr. Gerry, and which, after his departure, I  
caused to be declared to you at the Hague. I sincerely  
regret that your two colleagues await this answer at such  
a distance. As to you, sir, whom it will reach in a few  
days, and who understand so well the value of time, when  
the restoration of harmony between two republics which  
every thing invites to friendship, is in question, be assured  
that as soon as you can take in hand the object of your  
mission, I shall have the honor immediately to send you  
passports. Accept, sir, the assurances of my very sincere consideration.  
(Signed) Ch. Mau. Talleyrand.  
The foregoing documents were not published till they  
were communicated to Congress with my Message of December 5th, 1799. The Messages to the Senate nominating the Minister and the Envoys were never published  
till now, as I remember. I may be, however, mistaken.  
These papers were not published till the mischief was done  
that they might have prevented, and innumerable prejudices and errors propagated all over the nation.  
I have omitted two facts which ought to have been inserted in a former letter:  
I. One is, that one of the Heads of Department at Trenton was more diffident than the rest. He said he was  
far from being sanguine. He had signed the letter to me,  
urging a postponement of the mission, because he did not  
like to be singular; but he wished me to decide the  
question according to my own judgment and sentiments.  
He also shewed me a letter from the Attorney-General in  
Virginia, saying that the people expected that the envoys  
should proceed, and would be disappointed if they did not.  
II. Another fact is that I transiently asked one of the  
Heads of Department, whether Elsworth and Hamilton  
came all the way from Windsor and Newark to Trenton,  
to convince me that I ought to suspend the mission?

not out of the commas but beyond them—In  
one word alone I deviate,!, m the werd,  
“ Minifter” inffead of “ Sec retary” of Foreign  
Rela&#x27;ions.—No direct or iaJirclt and inofficial  
communications written or verbal will beheld  
by me with the French agents on American  
affairs.  
I accept the appointment which it has plcafed  
the Prefident to clothe me with, under a grateful  
fenfe of the high honor confc red upon me, fo  
unexpectedly, by this mark of his confidence.—  
I may be allowed to fay, that though I was  
deeply feafibie of the honor conferred by th$  
firft nomination, and lhall alw.ys I hope retain  
a molt grateful recollettian of it; yet Sir, the  
new inodifn ation of tint nomination gave me  
great pleafurc : always conceiving, as 1 thought  
1 did, (hat any negociation- with France would  
be lull of anxieties and political peril* to the  
envoys that Ihould be employed by our govern­  
ment, I had no wifhe? to be engaged in it, and  
no expectation that I Ihould be. To have a  
lhare in it was by me unfought. You will  
excufethis declaration, becaulc I was inftrunien­  
tal in certain preliminary (teps relative to the  
advances of France, which produced the bafis  
•f the appointment.  
I lend the original of the indofed to Mr.  
Talleyrard by port, another copy to Major  
Mounrflorence to be handed to him. a third to  
a Mr. Griffith for Major Mount florence in cafe  
the other failed, to be opened by Mr. Griffith,  
if M&lt;jor M. Ihould have been out of Paris,  
and directed Mr. G. to follow the inrtruclions  
which he would find in the letter to Major M.  
which were to de iver the inclofedto Mr. Talley­  
rand, and to take his letter, in anfwcr for me,  
to fend it to me.  
As f on as 1 have the anfwcr of the Direc­

copies to you, fir, by different ways.

has kept open the way to an approaching re­  
conciliati n. It has a long time ago manifeltcd  
its intentions with refpefl to this fubjetf. Be

yourfeif, the frank and exp&#x27;uit afturancc that  
it will receive the Envoys of the United States

veiled ; that they lhall enjoy all the preroga­

nations, and that one or more mini Hers lhall be  
duly authorized to treat with them.  
  
It was certainly unnecellary to fufler fo many  
months to elajfe for the mere coofh tuition of  
what I had already declared to M Gerry, and  
which, after his dep itrure, I caufed to he de­  
clared to you at the Hague. I fiucerely regret

With Bill power to difcufs and fettle by a

greeahle to &gt;our inftructions, as I con-  
ceived, the enclofed letter to Mr. Talley-

Ton will perceive, Sir, that I did not  
think myfelf at liberty to go not only not  
out of the commas, but, but beyond them,  
in one word alone I deviated, in the word

pleafed the prelident to cloth me with  
tinder a grateful fenfe of the high honor  
conferred upon me, fo unexpectedly by  
this mark of his confidence. — I may be

retain a molt grateful recollection of it;  
yet fir, the new modification of that no-  
mination gave me great pleafure, always  
conceiving as I thought I did, that any  
negotiation with France would be full of  
anxieties and political perils to the en-  
voys that fliould be employed by our go-  
vernment, I had no wanes to be engaged  
in it, and no expectation that I fhould be:  
To hav«i a fharc in it was by me un-  
fought: you will excufe this declaration,  
becaufe it was instrumental in certain  
preliminary Heps relative to the advances  
of France, which produced the bafis of  
the appointment.  
  
I lent the original of the enclofed to  
Mr. Talleyrand by poit, another, a copy  
to major Mountmoreiice, to be handed to

letter, anfwer for rac, and fend it to me.

agreeably to your instructions, as I  
conceived, the inclosed letter to Mr.  
T die rand, the minister of exterior  
relations. You will perceive, sir, that  
I did not think myself al liberty &#x27;o go,  
not only not out of the commas, but  
beyond them. In one word alone I  
deviated, in the word minister, in­  
stead of secretary ol foreign relations.  
No direct nor indirect and inofficial  
mmications, written or verbal,  
i by me with the French  
its on American affairs.  
I accept ii&#x27;e appointment which it  
bas-pleased il.e President to clothe me  
with, nder a grateful sense ofthe  
honor con feared upon me, so un­  
expectedly, by this in .; k of hiseoidi &#x27;

though I Was dceplv seuililv of the  
liitior conferred by the first nomina- ;  
• and shall always, I hope, retain !  
a most grateful recollection of it ; yet,  
sir, the new modifrcation of that no­  
nituuion gave me great pleasure, al­  
■ conceiving as I I did,  
any negociation wiih France  
1 be full of anxieties and political  
- to the envoys thai should be em­  
pl &gt;yed by our govemmant. I had no  
wis.ies to be engaged in it, and no ex­  
pi-cation that I should be : To have  
hare in it was by me unsought :  
You will excuse this declaration, be­  
-1 wis nisiru nental in certain  
p cii linary steps relative lo the ad­  
, vances of /&#x27;&quot;ranee which produced the  
basis of the appointment^.  
I sent the original of tbe inclosed to &#x27;  
Mr Talleyrand, by post ; another, a  
copy, to wajor Mountflorence, to be I  
handed to him ; a third to a Mr. Grif­  
fieh Idr Major M. jn cale ihe other  
failed, to be opened byMr.G if Ma­

The foregoing documents were not  
published till they were communicated  
to Congress with my message of De­  
cember sth, 1799 The messages to  
the Senate nominating the minister  
and tlie envoys were never published  
till now, as I remember. I may be,  
however, mistaken. These papers  
Were not published till he mischief  
was done that they might have pre­  
vented, and innumerable prejudices  
and errors propagated all over the  
naii  
&#x27; I have omitted two facts which  
ought to bave been inserted in a formei  
lette, :  
I. One is, that one of the head a of  
department at Trenton was move diffi­  
dent than the rest. He &#x27;said he was  
rom being sanguine. He had  
signed the 1- tter to me, urging a post­  
ponement of the mission, because he  
did not like to be singular ; hut he  
wished me to decide the question   
cordingto my own judgment and sen­  
timents. He also shewed me a le&#x27;ter  
from the Attorney General in Virgi­  
nia, Baying tint the people expected  
that the envoys should proceed, Bind  
would be disappointed if they did not.  
11. Ano&#x27;.her fact is that I uanscient  
ly asked one of the heads of dep ,rt­  
ment whether Elsworth and Hamilton  
came all the way from Windsor and  
Newark to Trenton, to convince me  
that I ought to suspend the mission ?

Dear Sir,  
  
«./■! nit- xfist, ime m me evening, l had

the commission of F,avoys.  
On the fifth I addressed, precisely, agree­  
ably to your instructions, as I conceived, tiie i  
inclosed letter to Mr. Talleyrand, the minis- j  
ter of exterior relations. You will perceive, ]  
sir, that I did not think myself at liberty to&lt;  
go, not only not out of the commas, but be\ oml  
them. In one word alone, I deviated, in the  
word minister, instead of Secretary of foreign  
relations. No direct or indirect and inofficial  
communications, written or verbal, will be  
held bv me with the French agents on Ame­  
rican affairs.  
1 accept the appointment, which it has  
pleased the President to clothe me with, un  
dei1 a grateful sense of the high honor con  
ferred upon me, so unexpectedly, by this  
mark of his confidence. 1 may be allowed  
to say, that though 1 was deeply sensible of&#x27;  
the honor conferred by the first nomination,  
ami shall always, I hope, retain a most grate­  
ful recollection of it; vet, sir, the new mo­  
dification of that nomination gave me great  
pleasure, always conceiving, as I thought 1  
did, that any negotiation with France,  
would be full of anxieties and political pe­  
rils to the Envoys that should be employ­  
ed by our government. I had no wishes to  
he engaged in it, and no expectation that I I  
should be : To have a share in it was by me |  
unsought. You will excuse this declaration, J  
because I was instrumental in certain preli- !  
minarv steps, relative to the advances of  
J1 ranee, which produced the basis of the  
appoint m nit,  
I sent the original of the inclosed, to Mr.

ja third to a Mr. Griffith for Maj. M. in

all differences which subsist between the  
two countries, sees, with pleasure, that its  
perseverance in pacific sentiments has kept  
open the way to an approaching reconcilia­

assurance, that it will receive the Envoys  
o* the United States, in the official charac­  
ter with which they are invested : that they  
shall enjoy all the prerogatives which are  
attached to it by the law of nations, and that  
one or more Ministers shall be authorized to  
treat with them.  
It was certainly unnecessary to suffer so  
many months to elapse, for the mere confir­  
mation of what 1 have already declared to  
Mr. (Irrry, and which, after his departure,  
I caused to be declared to you at the. Hague  
I sincerely regret, that your two colleagues  
await this answer at such a distance. As to  
you, sir, whom it will reach in a few days, and  
who understand so Well the value of time,  
when the restoration of harmony between  
t wo Republics which every thing invites to  
friendship, is in question, be assured, that  
as soon as you can take in hand the object of:  
your mission, I shall have the honor, imme­  
diately, tosend you passports.  
Accept, Sir,  
The assurances of my very sincere  
considerate n.

I lie messages to the Sc-natc, nominating the

your government, hot o husten to onswer  
the letter 1 received from you, dated the 15th  
of this month. o g 4 3  
  
The Exccutive Directory Leing informed  
of the nomination of My, Okiver Lisworth, of  
Mr. Patrick Henry, ind of yourself, as En­  
voys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipoten­  
tiary of the United States to the French Re­  
publick, to discuss and terminate all differens  
ces which subsist between the two countrics,  
see®\with pleasure, that its perseversnce in  
pacifick sentiments has kept open the way to  
an approaching recenciliation. It has a long  
time, ago menifested its intentions with_res­  
pect to this subject. .Be pleased to transmijt  
to your Colleagues, and accept ycurself, the  
frank and explicit assurance, that it will re­  
ceive the Envoys of the United States, in the  
official character with which they are invest­  
ed : that they shall enjoy all the prerogatives  
which are attached to it by the law of natious  
and that one or more Ministers shall be au­  
thorised to treat with them,  
dt was certainly unnecessary to suffer so  
many months to elapse for the mere confirma­  
tion of what I have already declared to Mr,  
Gerry, and which, after hisdeparture, I cau­  
sed to be declared to you at the Hague. 1  
sincerely regret that your collcagues await  
this answer at such a distence. Asto you,  
sity whom it will reach in ‘a few days, and  
who understand so well the value” of time,  
when the restoration of harmony between two  
republicks which every thing invites to friend­  
ship, is in question, be assured, that as soon  
as you can take in hand the object of your  
mission; I shall have the honour immediately  
to send you passports.  
Accept, siry the agsurances of my very sin­  
cere considertion,, . | .

&quot; The foregoing documents were not pul.-  
lished i}l they were communicated to Con­  
gress with % Message of_!mber sth,  
1799, THe Messages to the nomina­  
ting the Minister and the Envoys were nev­  
cr published 4ill now, as I ¥emember. I may  
be, however, mistaken. These papers were  
not published till the mischief was done ui  
they might have prevented, and ins |  
;zfuku and errours propagated all over  
I have omitted two fucts which ought to  
have been inserted in aformer Jotter .  
1. One is, that cne of the Heads of Depart­  
ment st Trenton was more diffident &amp;uz  
rest. He said he was far from being .8  
guine. He had signed the letter to me, z  
£ 3 Soaps e of the mission, becaus  
did not like to be ; but ke wished  
shewed e a letar from  
eral in Virginia, saying that the people ex-  
  
pected that the envoys should proceed; and  
_ be w«l il m.g‘uid not.  
W Another fact is, that I&#x27;transiently asked  
&amp; cf the Heads&quot;of department whether /-  
porth snd Hemiltcn cyme all the way from  
&quot;Windsor and Newark to T&#x27;renton, to convince  
me that I ought to suspend the mission ? -
