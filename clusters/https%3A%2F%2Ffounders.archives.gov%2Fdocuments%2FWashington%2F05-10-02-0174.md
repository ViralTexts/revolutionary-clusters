Sir.  
Philadelphia, the 18th April, 1792.  
  
To you it officially belongs to “take care that the Laws” of the United States “be faithfully executed.” Before you, therefore, we think it our duty to lay the sentiments, which, on a late painful  
  
occasion, governed us with regard to an Act passed by the Legilature of the Union.  
The People of the United States have vested in Congress all legislative Powers “granted in the constitution.”  
They have vested in one supreme Court and in such Inferior Courts as the Congress shall establish “the judicial Power of the United States.”  
It is worthy of remark, that, in Congress, the whole legislative Power of the United States is not vested. An important part of that power was exercised by the People themselves, when they “ordained and established the Constitution.”  
“This Constitution” is “the supreme Law of the Land.”  
This Supreme Law “all judicial Officers of the United States are bound by oath, or affirmation, to support.”  
It is a Principle important to Freedom, that, in Government, the judicial should be distinct from, and independent of the legislative Department.  
To this important Principle the people of the United States, in forming their Constitution, have manifested the highest Regard.  
They have placed their judicial Power, not in Congress, but in “Courts.” They have ordained that the “Judges” of those Courts “shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,” and that, “during their continuance in Office, their Salaries shall not be diminished.”  
Congress have lately passed an Act “to regulate,” among other Things, “the claims to invalid Pensions.”  
Upon due consideration, we have been unanimously of opinion, that, under this act, the Circuit Court held for the Pennsylvania District could not proceed.  
1. Because the Business directed by this act is not of a judicial nature: It forms no Part of the Power vested, by the Constitution, in the Courts of the United States. The Circuit Court must, consequently, have proceeded without constitutional authority.  
2. Because, if, upon that Business, the Court had proceeded, its Judgments—for its Opinions are its Judgments—might, under the same Act, have been revised and controuled by the Legislature and by an Officer in the executive Department. Such revision and controul we deemed radically inconsistent with the Independence of that judicial Power, which is vested in the Courts, and consequently, with that important Principle which is so strictly observed by the Constitution of the United States.  
  
These, Sir, are the Reasons of our conduct. Be assured, that though it became necessary it was far from being pleasant. To be obliged to act contrary either to the obvious Directions of Congress or to a constitutional Principle, in our Judgment equally obvious, excited Feelings in us, which we hope never to experience again. We have the Honour to be, with the most perfect consideration and Respect, Sir, Your most obedient and very humble Servants,

A nieffage from the President of the Unitec  
States, was delivered by Mr. Secretary Lear,  
together with the following letter, from th&lt;  
judges of the circuit couit.  
Sir,  
TO you it officially belongs to &quot; take car  
that the lazjs&quot; of the United States &#x27;&#x27; be faithful­  
ly executed.&quot; Before you, therefore, we think 11  
our duty to lay the sentiments, which, on a late  
painful occasion, governed us, with regaid toar  
ast palTecl by the legislature of the union.  
J he people of the United States have vefl£c  
in Congrels all Ugijlatwe powers &quot; granted ir  
the conilitution —  
1 bey have veiled in one supreme court, and  
in luck infcuor courts as the Congress shall efta-  
Willi, &quot; tilt judicial power of the United States.  
It is wo thy of remark, that, in Congress,  
the u/fo/elegiilative power 0. the United States  
is not Veiled : an important part of that powei  
was exercised by the people themselves, when  
they &quot; ordained and eltabltlhed the conflitution.&quot;  
•&#x27; This conflitution&quot; is &quot; the supreme law of  
the land.&quot;—This lupreme law &quot; all judicial of­  
ficers of the United States ate bound, by oath or  
affirmation, to lupport.&quot;  
It is. a &quot;principle important to freedom, that  
in government, the judicial ffiould be diftinfl  
fiom, and independent of the legislative depart­  
ment. To this important principle the people  
of the United States in forming their conilitu­  
tion, have manifefied the highell regard.  
They have placed their judicial power, not in  
Congress, but in &quot; courts &quot; They have ordained  
that the &quot;judges&quot; of those courts (hall hold  
their offices &quot; during good behavior;&quot; and that  
&quot; during their continuance in office, their fab­  
rics (ball not be eiiminifhed.&quot;  
Congress have lately palled an act. &quot;to re­  
gulate (among other things) the claims of inva­  
lid penlions.&quot;  
Upon due confederation, we have been una­  
nimoully of opinion, that, under this act, the  
ci.-cuit court, held for the Pennsylvania dillritt,  
could not proceed :—  
1. Because the business, diretled by this act.  
is not of a judicial nature : —it forms no part o!  
the power veiled, by the conilitution, 111 the  
courts of the United States: the ciicuit cour  
mud ccmf-quently have proceeded without con­  
(htutional authority,  
2. Beeaufe, if, upon that business, the cour  
had proceeded, iis judgments (for its opinion:  
are its judgments) might, under the fame afct  
have been reviled and controuled by the legis­  
lature, and by an officer in the executive de­  
partment, —such revision androntroul we deem  
cd radically inconliftent with the independent  
of that judicial power which is veiled in th&lt;  
courts ; and conf&lt;.quently with that importan  
principle, which is so Urielly observed by thi  
conftitu&#x27;.ion of the United States,  
These, fir, are the teafons of our conduct.—  
Be assured, that, though it became ncceH&#x27;ary, i  
was far from being pleasant. To be obliged ti  
art contrary either to the obvious direfliems o  
Congress, or to a conflitutional principle, ii  
our judgment, equally obvious, excited feeling  
in us. which we hope never to experience again  
We have the honor to be, with the moi.°per

the act, were influenced only by a high sense of duty ; a just  
view of the construction of our government; and a virtuous and  
firm determination to preserve and execute it, as the people,  
who made it, intended. The ground of the refusal to perform  
the duties imposed upon them, was, in substance, that our go-  
vernment was divided into three distinct and independent  
branches ;—legislative, executive, and judicial: that in. the Su-  
preme Court, and such inferior Courts as Congress shall establish,  
“*the judicial power of the United States’? was vested ; that the  
Constitution is the supreme law of the Jand, and all judicial offi-  
cers of the United States are bound by oath to support it ; that  
the judicial should be distinct from, and independent of, the le-  
gislative department ; that the judicial power is placed, not in  
Congress, but in Courts. Acting upon these fundamental prin-  
ciples of our government, and applying them to the case before  
them, the judges declined to perform the services required of  
them by the act of Congress ; because—1. The business was  
not of a judicial nature, and forms no part of the power vested  
in them by the Constitution, as the Courts of the United  
States. 2. Because if upon that business the Court had proceed-  
ed, its judgments might, under the act, have been revised and  
controlled by the legislature, and by an officer of the executive  
department, which they deem to be radically inconsistent with  
the independence of that judicial power which is vested in the  
Courts.

elaborating the importance of an independent judiciary and the  
reasons for their determination, the judges assured the Presi-  
dent that, though it became necessary, it was far from pleasant  
to be obliged to act contrary either to the obvious directions  
of Congress or to a constitutional principle in their judgment  
equally obvious, and that the situation excited feelings in them  
which they hoped never to experience again.
