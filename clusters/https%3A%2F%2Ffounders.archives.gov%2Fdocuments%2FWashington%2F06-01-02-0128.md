Mount Vernon 29th May 1797  
  
I am indebted to you for several unacknowledged letters, but ne’er mind that; go on, as if you had them. You are at the source of information &amp; can find many things to relate, while I have nothing to say that could either inform, or amuse a Secretary of War in Philadelphia.  
To tell him that I begin my diurnal course with the Sun; that if my hirelings are not in their places at that time I send them messages  
  
expressive of my sorrow for their indisposition—then having put these wheels in motion, I examine the state of things farther; and the more they are probed, the deeper I find the wounds are, which my buildings have sustained by an absence, and neglect of eight years. By the time I have accomplished these matters, breakfast (a little after seven oclock, about the time I presume you are taking leave of Mrs McHenry) is ready. This over, I mount my horse and ride round my farms, which employs me until it is time to dress for dinner; at which I rarely miss seeing strange faces—come, as they say, out of respect to me. Pray, would not the word curiosity answer as well? and how different this, from having a few social friends at a cheerful board? The usual time of sitting at Table—a walk—and Tea—brings me within the dawn of Candlelight; previous to which, if not prevented by company, I resolve, that as soon as the glimmering taper, supplies the place of the great luminary, I will retire to my writing Table and acknowledge the letters I have received; but when the lights are brought, I feel tired, and disinclined to engage in this work, conceiving that the next night will do as well; the next comes, and with it the same causes for postponement, &amp; effect; and so on.  
This will account for your letters remaining so long unacknowledged—and having given you the history of a day, it will serve for a year; and I am persuaded you will not require a second edition of it: but it may strike you, that in this detail no mention is made of any portion of time allotted for reading; the remark would be just, for I have not looked into ⟨a⟩ book since I came home, nor shall be able to do it until I have discharged my workmen; probably not before the nights grow longer; when, possibly, I may be looking in doomsday book.  
On the score of the plated ware in your possession I will say something in a future letter. At present I shall only add that I am always and affectionately Yours

&quot;Mount Vernon, May 29, 1797.  
Dear SiR: I am indebted to you for  
several unacknowledged letters, but never  
mind that; go on as if you had answers.  
You are at the source of information, and  
can find many things to relate, while I have  
nothing to say that could either inform or  
amuse a Secretary of War in Philadelphia.  
I might tell him that I began my diurnal  
course with the sun; that if my hirelings are  
not in their places at that time, I send them  
messages of sorrow for their indisposition;  
that having put these wheels in motion, I  
examine the state of things further; that the  
more they are probed, the deeper I find  
the wounds which my buildings have sus­  
tained by an absence and neglect of eight  
years; that, by the time I have accomplish­  
ed these matters, breakfust (a little after  
seven o&#x27;clock, about the time I presume  
you are taking leave of Mrs. McHenry) is  
ready; that this being over, I mount my  
horse and ride round my farms, which em­  
ploys me until it is time to dress for dinner,  
at which I rarely miss seeing strange faces,  
come, as they say, out of respect for me,­  
Pray would not the word cariosity answer  
as well? And how different this from hay­  
ing a few social friends at a cheerful  
board! The usual time of sitting at table,  
a walk, and tea bring me within the dawn  
of candle-light; previous to which, if not  
prevented by company, I resolve that as  
soon as the glimmering taper supplies the  
place of the great luminary, I will retire to  
my writing table, and acknowledge the let­  
ters I have received; but when the lights  
are brought I feel tired and disinclined to  
engage in this work, conceiving that the  
next night will do as well. The next night  
comes, and with it the same causes for post­  
ponement, and so on. This will account  
for your letter remaining so long unac­  
knowledged; and having given you a histo­  
ry of a day, it will serve for a year, and I  
am persuaded you will not require a see­  
ond edition of it. But it may strike you,  
that in this detail no mention is made of any  
portion of time alotted for reading. The  
remark would be just, for I have not look­  
ed into a book since I came home; nor  
 shall I be able to do it until I have discharg­  
ed my workmen, probably not before the  
nights grow longer, when possibly I may  
  
be looking in doomsday book. At present  
I shall only add that I am always and affee­  
tionately yours.

Soon after Washington’s return to Mount  
Vernon, he wrote a letter to a friend, in which  
he described the manner in which he passed his  
‘ime. He rose with the sun, and first made  
preparations for the business of the day. “ By  
the time I have accomplished these matters,”  
he adds, “ breakfast is ready. This being over,  
I mount my horse and ride round my farms,
