Sunday—May first. Left Georgetown about 6 Oclock, and crossing the Santee Creek [Sampit River] at the Town, and the Santee  
  
River 12 miles from it, at Lynchs Island, we breakfasted and dined at Mrs. Horry’s about 15 Miles from George town &amp; lodged at the Plantation of Mr. Manigold about 19 miles farther.

Monday 2d. Breakfasted at the Country Seat of Govr. Pinckney about 18 miles from our lodging place, &amp; then came to the ferry at Haddrels point, 6 miles further, where I was met by the Recorder of the City, Genl. Pinckney &amp; Edward Rutledge Esqr. in a 12 oared barge rowed by 12 American Captains of Ships, most elegantly dressed. There were a great number of other Boats with Gentlemen and ladies in them; and two Boats with Music; all of whom attended me across and on the passage were met by a number of others. As we approached the town a salute with Artillery  
  
commenced, and at the wharf I was met by the Governor, the Lt. Governor, the Intendt. of the City; The two Senators of the State, Wardens of the City—Cincinnati &amp;ca. &amp;ca. and conducted to the Exchange where they passed by in procession. From thence I was conducted in like manner to my lodgings—after which I dined at the Governors (in what I called a private way) with 15 or 18 Gentlemen.  
It may as well in this as in any other place, be observed, that the country from Wilmington through which the road passes, is, except in very small spots, much the same as what has already been described; that is to say, sand &amp; pine barrens—with very few inhabitants. We were indeed informed that at some distance from the Road on both sides the land was of a better quality, &amp; thicker settled, but this could only be on the Rivers &amp; larger waters—for a perfect sameness seems to run through all the rest of the Country. On these—especially the swamps and low lands on the rivers, the soil is very rich; and productive when reclaimed; but to do this is both laborious and expensive. The Rice planters have two modes of watering their fields—the first by the tide—the other by resurvoirs drawn from the adjacent lands. The former is best, because most certain. A crop without either is precarious, because a drought may not only injure, but destroy it. Two and an half and 3 barrels to the Acre is esteemed a good Crop and 8 or 10 Barrls. for each grown hand is very profitable; but some have 12 &amp; 14, whilst 5 or 6 is reckoned the average production of a hand. A barrel contains about 600 weight, and the present price is about 10/6 &amp; 11/. Sterg. pr. 100.  
The lodgings provided for me in this place were very good, being the furnished house of a Gentleman at present in the Country; but occupied by a person placed there on purpose to accomodate me, &amp; who was paid in the same manner as any other letter of lodgings would have been paid

, S.C., he wrote a letter addressed to Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Edward Rutledge, offering either of them the seat on the United States Supreme Court that Rutledge’s brother John had recently vacated to become chief justice of South Carolina. Both men declined because of distressed finances (GW to Pinckney and Rutledge, 24 May 1791, ScC; Pinckney and Rutledge to GW, 12 June 1791, DLC:GW; ZAHNISERMarvin R. Zahniser. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney: Founding Father. Chapel Hill, N.C., 1967., 111–13).  
  
  
  
  
The 12 captains who rowed GW across the harbor, plus a thirteenth captain who acted as coxswain of the barge, “were uniformly and neatly dressed in light blue silk jackets, and round black hats decorated with blue ribbons on which were impressed the arms” of South Carolina. “During the passage vocal and instrumental music were performed on the water by the Amateur Society, assisted by a voluntary association of singers; and upwards of forty boats attended with anxious spectators, which formed a most beautiful appearance” (Gaz. of the U.S. [Philadelphia], 21 May 1791; SALLEY [2]A. S. Salley. President Washington’s Tour Through South Carolina In 1791. Columbia, S.C., 1932. In Bulletins of the Historical Commission of South Carolina, no. 12., 13; HENDERSONArchibald Henderson. Washington’s Southern Tour, 1791. Boston and New York, 1923., 159, n.1). The opening stanza of the laudatory lyrics sung by the waterborne chorus—“young gentlemen of considerable vocal powers”—revealed the high pitch to which the patriotic fervor of Charleston’s citizens had risen in anticipation of GW’s arrival:  
  
  
  
He comes! he comes! the hero comes.  
Sound, sound your trumpets, beat your drums,  
From port to port let cannons roar,

talion of artillery. The evening ball, given by the city corporation, was attended by “a great number of gentlemen,” but the “brilliant assemblage of ladies” was clearly the center of attention. “The ladies,” said a newspaper account, “were all superbly dressed; and most of them wore ribbons with different inscriptions, expressive of their respect for the President, such as, ‘long live the President,’ &amp;c. Joy, satisfaction and gratitude illumined every countenance, and revelled in every heart; whilst the demonstrations of grateful respect shewn him seemed to give him the most heartfelt satisfaction, which visibly displayed itself in his countenance. The beautiful arch of lamps in front of the Exchange was illuminated; and over the entrance there was a superb transparency, in the centre Deliciis Patriae, and at the top G.W. The fusileer company was drawn up before the Exchange to maintain order, and exhibited a very pleasing appearance. In short, every circumstance of the evening’s entertainment was truly picturesque of the most splendid elegance”

Friday 6th. Viewed the town on horse back by riding through most of the principal Streets.  
Dined at Majr. Butlers, and went to a Ball in the evening at the Governors where there was a select company of ladies.  
  
  
  
Saturday 7th. Before break I visited the Orphan House at which there were one hund. &amp; Seven boys &amp; girls. This appears to be a charitable institution and under good management. I also viewed the City from the balcony of  Church from whence the  
  
whole is seen in one view and to advantage. The Gardens &amp; green trees which are interspersed adding much to the beauty of the prospect.  
Charleston stands on a Pininsula between the Ashley &amp; Cowper Rivers and contains about 1,600 dwelling houses and nearly 16,000 Souls of which about 8,000 are white. It lies low with unpaved Streets (except the footways) of Sand. There are a number of very good houses of Brick &amp; wood, but most of the latter. The Inhabitants are wealthy—Gay—&amp; hospitable; appear happy, &amp; satisfied with the Genl. Governmt. A cut is much talked off between the Ashley &amp; Santee Rivers but it would seem I think, as if the accomplishment of the measure was not very near. It would be a great thing for Charleston if it could be effected. The principal exports from this place is Rice, Indigo and Tobacco; of the last from 5 to 8,000 Hhds. have been exported, and of the first from 80 to 120,000 Barrels

The evening ball was held in the Long Room of the Filature, a large building on Reynolds Square erected in the 1750s and used for silk manufacturing until about 1770 when it became a public assembly hall. GW arrived at the ball at 8:30 P.M., “and was personally introduced,” according to a newspaper account, “to 96 ladies, who were elegantly dressed, some of whom displayed infinite taste in the emblems and devices on their sashes and head dresses, out of respect to the happy occasion. The room, which had been lately handsomely fitted up, and was well lighted, afforded the President an excellent opportunity of viewing the fair sex of our city and vicinity, and the ladies the gratification of paying their respects to our Federal Chief. After a few minuets were moved, and one country dance led down, the President and his suite retired about 11 o’clock. At 12 o’clock the supper room was opened, and the ladies partook of a repast, after which dances continued until 3 o’clock” Dunlap’s American Daily Adv.

Lincoln. To form an opinion of the attack at this distance of time, and the change which has taken place in the appearance of the ground by the cutting away of the woods, &amp;ca., is hardly to be done with justice to the subject; especially as there is remaining scarcely any of the defences.  
Dined to day with a number of the Citizens (not less than 200) in an elegant Bower erected for the occasion on the Bank of the River below the Town. In the evening there was a tolerable good display of fireworks.

Savanna stands upon what may be called high ground for this Country. It is extremely Sandy wch. makes the walking very disagreeable; &amp; the houses uncomfortable in warm &amp; windy weather as they are filled with dust whensoever these happen. The town on 3 sides is surrounded with cultivated Rice fields which have a rich and luxurient appearance. On the 4th. or back side it is a fine sand. The harbour is said to be very good, &amp; often filled with square rigged vessels but there is a bar below over which not more than 12 Water can be brot. except at Spg. tides. The tide does not flow above 12 or 14 miles above the City though the River is swelled by it more than dble. that distance. Rice &amp; Tobacco (the last of wch. is greatly encreasing) are the principal Exports. Lumber &amp; Indigo are also Expord. but the latter is on the decline, and it is supposed by Hemp &amp; Cotton. Ship timber—viz—live Oak &amp; Cedar, is (and may be more so) valuable in the expt.

The whole Road from Augusta to Columbia is a pine barren of the worst sort, being hilly as well as poor. This circumstance added to the distance, length of the Stages, want of water and heat of the day, foundered one of my horses very badly.  
Beyond Granby 4 miles, I was met by sevl. Gentlemen of that place &amp; Wynnsborough; and on the banks of the River on the No. Side by a number of others, who escorted me to Columbia.

gether in a well conceived arrangement: to a farmer’s dinner, where plenty abounded.” GW left the statehouse after several toasts were given, but returned at 8:00 P.M. for a ball that lasted until 11:00 P.M. (Dunlap’s Daily American Adv. [Philadelphia], 24 June 1791).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Tuesday 24th. The condition of my foundered horse obliged me to remain at this place, contrary to my intention, this day also.  
Columbia is laid out upon a large scale; but, in my opinion, had better been placed on the River below the falls. It is now an uncleared wood, with very few houses in it, and those all wooden ones. The State House (which is also of wood) is a large &amp; commodious building, but unfinished. The Town is on dry, but cannot be called high ground, and though surrounded by Piney &amp; Sandy land, is, itself, good. The State house is near two miles  
  
from the River, at the confluence of the broad River &amp; Saluda. From Granby the River is navigable for Craft which will, when the River is a little swelled, carry 3000 bushels of Grain—when at its usual height less, and always some. The River from hence to the Wateree below which it takes the name of the Santee is very crooked; it being, according to the computed distance near 400 miles—Columbia from Charleston is 130 miles.  
  
  
  
GW dined today “in private with a few gentlemen” (Dunlap’s American Daily Adv. [Philadelphia], 24 June 1791). The Broad and Saluda rivers meet at Columbia to form the Congaree, which is joined by the Wateree River lower down to form the Santee.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 25th. Set out at 4 ’Oclock for Cambden (the foundered horse being led slowly on). Breakfasted at an indifferent house 22 miles from the town (the first we came to) and reached Cambden about two oclock, 14 miles further where an address was recd. &amp; answered. Dined late with a number of Gentlemen &amp; Ladies at a public dinner. The Road from Columbia to Cambden, excepting a mile or two at each place, goes over the most miserable pine barren I ever saw, being quite a white sand, &amp; very hilly. On the Wateree with in a mile &amp; half of which the town stands the lands are very good—the culture Corn Tobacco &amp; Indigo. Vessels carrying 50 or 60 Hhds. of Tobo. come up to the Ferry at this place at which there is a Tobacco Warehouse.

Thursday 26th. After viewing the british works about Cambden I set out for Charlotte. On my way—two miles from Town—I examined the ground on wch. Genl. Green &amp; Lord Rawden had their Action. The ground had but just been taken by the former—was well chosen—but he not well established in it before he was attacked; which by capturing a Videt was, in some measure by surprize. Six miles further on I came to the ground where Genl. Gates &amp; Lord Cornwallis had their Engagement wch. terminated so unfavourably for the former. As this was a night Meeting of both Armies on their March, &amp; altogether unexpected each formed on the ground they met without any advantage in it on either side it being level &amp; open. Had Genl. Gates been ½ a mile further advanced, an impenitrable Swamp would have prevented the attack which was made on him by the British Army, and afforded him time to have formed his own plans; but having no information of Lord Cornwallis’s designs, and perhaps not being apprised of this advantage it was not siezed by him.  
Cambden is a small place with appearances of some new buildings. It was much injured by the British whilst in their possession.  
After halting at one Suttons 14 M. from Cambden I lodged at James Ingrams 12 Miles farther.

Charlotte is a very trifling place, though the Court of Mecklenburg is held in it. There is a School (called a College) in it at which, at times there has been 50 or 60 boys.

Monday 30th. At 4 Oclock I was out from Major Fifers; and in about 10 Miles at the line which divides. Mecklenburgh from Rowan Counties, I met a party of horse belonging to the latter, who came from Salisbury to escort me on. (It ought to have been mentioned also that upon my entering the State of No. Carolina, I was met by a Party of the Mecklenburgh horse—but these being Near their homes I dismissed them). I was also met 5 Miles from Salisbury by the Mayor of the Corporation, Judge McKoy, &amp; many others; Mr. Steel, Representative for the district, was so polite as to come all the way to Charlotte to meet me. We arrived at Salisbury about 8 Oclock, to breakfast, 20 miles from Captn. Fifers. The lands between Charlotte &amp; Salisbury are very fine, of a reddish cast and well timbered, with but very little under wood. Between these two places are the first meadows I have seen on the Road since I left Virga.; &amp; here also, we appear to be getting into a Wheat Country.  
This day I foundered another of my horses.  
Dined at a public dinner givn. by the Citizens of Salisbury; &amp; in the afternoon drank Tea at the same place with about 20 ladies, who had been assembled for the occasion.  
Salisbury is but a small place altho’ it is the County town, and the district Court is held in it; nor does it appear to be much on the encrease. There is about three hundred Souls in it and tradesmen of different kinds

GW’s impressions of Salisbury are confirmed by William Loughton Smith’s remarks about the town in his journal. Salisbury, observed Smith who stopped there 6 May 1791, “consists of about forty or fifty straggling houses in an open pretty plain; it looks like a poor place and has but little business. The Court House is not half finished: the town contains about 300 inhabitants among them a great number of children” (SMITH [6]Albert

The Road between Salisbury &amp; Salem passes over very little good land, and much that is different; being a good deal mixed with Pine, but not Sand.  
Salem is a small but neat Village; &amp; like all the rest of the Moravian settlements, is governed by an excellent police—having within itself all kinds of artizans. The number of Souls does not exceed 200.

entry for two days: &quot;Thursday, May ^l&gt;.  
After viewing the British works about  
Camden, I set out for Charlotte ; on my  
way, two miles from town, 1 examined the  
ground on which General Greene and Lord  
Kawdon had their action. The ground had  
but just been taken by the former, was well  
  
chosen, but he was not well established in  
it before he was attacked?which, by capturing  
a videt, was in some measure bysurprise  
; six miles further on, 1 came to the !  
ground where General Gates and Lord Corn- J  
wallis had their engagement, which terminated  
so unfavorably for the former. As  
this was a night meeting of both armies on  
their march, and altogether unexpected, ,  
each formed on the ground they met, with- !  
out any advantage in it on either side, it  
being level and open. Had General Gates  
boon half a mile further advanced, an impenetrable  
swamp would have prevented  
the attack which was made on him by the ,  
British army, and afforded him time to have  
formed his own plans; but having no information  
of Lord Cornwall is&#x27; designs, and  
perhaps not apprized of this advantage, it  
was not seized by him. Camden is a small  
place, with appearances of some new buildings.  
it was much injured by the British  
whilst in their possession. (  
&quot;After halting at one Sutton&#x27;s, fourteen  
miles from Camden, I lodged at James Ingram&#x27;s  
twelve miles further. (  
Friday, 27th. Left Ingram&#x27;s about 4  
o&#x27;clock, and breakfasting at one Barr&#x27;s,eigh­  
  
teen miles distant, lodged at Major Crawford&#x27;s  
eight miles further. About two miles  
from this plaee I came to the Corner, where ,  
the North Carolina line comes to the road, \
from whence the road is the boundary for  
twelve miles more. At Major Crawford&#x27;s I .  
was met by some of the Chiefs of the Cataw- J  
ba nation, who seemed to be under the apprehension  
that some attempts were mak- ,  
ing, or would bemade to deprive them of (  
part of the 40,000 acres which was secured to j  
them by treaty, and which is bounded by ,  
this road.&quot; &#x27;

“Sunday, 16th—After morning sorvioo  
and receiving a number of visits from the  
most respectable ladies of the place (us  
was the case yesterday) I set out for Au­  
gusta, escorted beyond the limits of the  
city by most of the gentlemen in it, and  
dining at Mulberry Grove—the seat of  
Mrs. Green—lodged at one Spencer&#x27;s—dis­

“Savanna stands upon what mav he  
called high ground tor this country. It Is  
extremely sandy, which makes the walk­  
ing very disagreeable; and the houses  
very uncomfortable In warm and windy  
weather, as they are filled with dust  
whenever those happen. The town on  
three sidos is surrounded with cultivated  
rioe iieids, which have a rich and luxu­  
rious appearance. On the fourth or back­  
side, it Is a fine sand. The harbor is said  
to bo very good and is otter tilled with  
  
square Jriggod vessels, but there is a  
bar below, over which not more than  
12 lWrt ot water can lie brought except  
at Mfrg tides. The tide does not flow above  
l&amp;Ar 14 miles above the city, though the

also exported, but the latter is on the de­

Left Georgetown about6 o&#x27;clock and cross?

Island, we breakfasted and dined at Mrs  
Horry&#x27;s about 15 miles from Georgetown k  
lodged at the niantatioa of idrs. Manifold  
about 19 miles farther.  
MONDAY, 2D.  
Breakfasted at the Couuty seat of Gov&#x27;r  
Pinckney about IS miles from our landing i  
place, and then came to the fern* at Haddrel&#x27;s i  
point, ? miles further, where I waa met by the  
Recorder of the city, Geu&#x27;l Pinckney b EJ­  
ward Rutledge, Esqr, -in a 12 oared barge  
Rowed by 12 American Captains of Ships,  
most elegantly dressed-There were a great j  
number of other&quot; Coats with Gentlemen and !  
ladies in them-and two boals with music; j  
ail of whom attended me across, and on the  
passage were met by a number of others. As |  
we approached the town u salu e with arti!- j  
lery commenced, and at the wharf I was met i  
by the Governor, the Lt Governor, the In- !  
tendt. of the city, Cincinnati, ic, &amp;c. and J  
conducted to the Exchange, where they passed I  
by in procession-from thence I was conduct- ]  
i ed m like manner to my lodging!-after j  
! which I dined at the Governors (in what he I  
called a private way) with 15 or 18 gentle?  
men. Il may be a? well in this as ia any ?  
other place, be cbserred that .he Country I  
from Wilmington through which &#x27;.he road j  
passes, is except in very small spots, much i  
the same as what has already bee&#x27;J described ; j  
that is to say, eand and pine barrens-with ?  
very few inhabitants-we were indeed in- ?  
formed that at some distance from the road I  
on both sides tue land was of better quality i  
and thicker settled, but this could only be on  
the rivers and larger waters-for a perfect !  
sameness seems to run through all the rest of i  
thtcouotry-on these especially the swamps i  
and low lands on the ri?ers, the soil is very .  
rich; and productive when reclaimed, butte  
do this is both laborious and expensive-the  
rich planters have two modes of watering  
their fields-the first by the tide-the other  
by reservoirs drawn from the adjacent lands.  
The former is best because most certain. A  
crop without either is precarious, because a  
drought may not only iujure but destroy it. j  
Two and a half and 3 barrels to the acre is |  
estimated a good crop, and 8 or IC barrels f r  
each grown hand is very profitable; but some I  
have 12 and 14, whilst 5 or 6 is reckoned the |  
average production of a band. A barrel con?  
tains about 600 weight and the preseut price  
is about 10 6 and 11 sterg pr 100.  
The lodgings provided for me ii this place  
were very good, being the furnished house of  
a gentleman at present in the country, but  
occupied by a prison placed there on purpose  
to accommodate rae, and who was paid in tbe  
same way as any other letter of lodgings  
would have been paid

advantage, the Gardens and green trees which I  
are interspersed adding much to the bea itv of !  
the prospect, Charleston stands on a peninsula &#x27;  
between : he Ashier ami Cooper Rivers and  
contains about 1.600 dwelling houses and  
nearly 16,000 soul?, of which ab&lt;&gt;ur 8,0C0 are ?  
white. It lies low, with unpaved street; (ex- j  
cept the footway) o&#x27; sand. There are a nu rn- j  
ber of very good houses of Brick and wood,  
but mostly of th&quot; latter. The inhabitants are |  
wealthy, Gay and hospitable, appear happy  
and satisfied with the General Government. I  
*Tbese lines were upon Charleston Neck, i  
*xAeodiog from the Ashley to the Cooper  
River, at tli? junction of which the city  
stands. &#x27;  
  
A cm is much talked of between the Ashley  
and Sar.tee Rivers, but it would seem, 1 think,  
as if the accomplishment of the measuio was  
not very near, lt would be a great thing for  
Charleston if it coald be effected. The prin?

WEDNESDAY, ll Tit.  
After an early breakfast at Mr. Smith&#x27;s we  
road 20 miles to a place called PokitelHeo,  
where a dinner was provided by the parish­  
oners of Prince William for my reception,  
and an address from them was presented and  
answered. After dinner we proceeded 16  
miles farther to Judge Hayward&#x27;s where we  
lodged, and, as also at Mr. Smith&#x27;s were  
kindly and hospitably entertained. My  
going to Colo Washington&#x27;s* is to be  
ascribed to motives of friendship and rela?  
tionship ; but to Mr. Smith&#x27;s and Judge  
Hayward&#x27;s to those of necessity, there being  
no public houses on the road, and my dis?  
tance to get to those private ones increased at  
lea3t 10 ct 12 miles between Charleston and  
Savannah.  
THURSDAY, 12TH.  
By five o&#x27;clock we set out from Judge  
Hayward&#x27;s and road to Purisburgh, 22 miles,  
to breakfast.  
At that place I was met by Messrs. Jones  
Colo Habersham, Mr. John Houston, Gen&#x27;l  
McIntosh and Mr. Clay, a comee, from the city  
of Savannah to conduct me thither. Boats  
were also ordered by them for ray accommo?  
dation, among which a handsome four oared  
barge, rowed by 8 American captains, at?  
tended. In my way down the river I called  
upon Mrs. Green, the widow of the deceased  
Gen&#x27;l Green, (at a place called Mulberry  
Grove) and asked her how she did. At this  
place (two miles from Pnrisburg) my horses  
and carriages were land?d, and had 12 miles  
farther by land to Savannah. The wind and  
tide being both agst, us, it was six o&#x27;clock  
before we reached the city, where we were re?  
ceived under every demonstration that could  
be given of joy and respect. We&#x27;were seven  
hours making the passage, which is often  
performed in 4, though the computed distance  
is 25 miles. Illumns. at night.  
I was conducted by the mayor and wardens  
to a very good lodging, which had been pro?  
vided for the occasion, and partook of a pub?  
lic dinner given by the citizens at the Coffee  
Room. At Purisburg I parted with Gen&#x27;l

passes over very little good land,  
and much that is different : being a

&quot;The condition of my foundered  
horse obliged me to remain at this  
place, coutrary to my intention, this  
day also.  
&quot;Columbia is laid out upon a large  
scale, but, in my opinios, had better  
been placed on the river below the  
falls. It is now an uncleared wood,  
with very few houses in it, and those  
all wooden ones. The State House  
(which is also of wood) is a large and  
commodious building, but unfinished.  
The town is on dry, but cannot be  
called high ground, and though sur­  
rounded by piney and sandy land is  
itself good. The State House is near  
two miles from the river, at the con­  
fluence of the Broad River and Saluda.  
-From Granby the river is navigable for  
craft, which ivill, when the river is a  
little swelled, carry 3,000 bushels of  
  
and always some. The river from  
hence to the Wateree below which it  
takes the name of Santee, is very  
crooked, it being, according to the  
computed distance, near four hundred

Sunday, 29th. Left Charlotte about 7  
o&#x27;clock, dined at Col. Smith&#x27;s 15 miles off,  
and lodged at Maj. Fifer&#x27;s 7 miles farther.  
Monday. 30th. At 4 o&#x27;clock, I was out  
from Maj. Fifer&#x27;s and in about 10 miles  
of the line, which divides Mecklenburg  
from Rowan counties. I met a party of  
horsemen belonging to tue latter, who  
oame from Salisbury to escort me on.  
(It ought to have been mentioned also,  
that upon my entering tbe state of North  
Carolina, I was met by a party ef the  
Mecklenburg horsemen, but these being  
near their homes, 1 dismissed them.) I  
was also met five miles from Salisbury by  
the Mayor of the Corporation, Judge Mc­  
Eoy and many others. Mr. Steel, Repre­  
sentative for the district, was so polite as to  
come all the way to Charlotte to meet me.  
We arrived at Salisbury about 8 o&#x27;clock  
to breakfast, 20 miles from Capt. Fifer&#x27;s.  
The lands between Charlotte and Salis­  
bury, are very fine, of a reddish cast and  
well timbered&#x27; with &quot;very little under­  
wood. Between these two places are the  
first meadows I have seen on the road  
since I left Virginia, and also, we appear  
to be getting into a wheat country.  
Salisbury is but a small place, although  
it is the county town, and the district  
Court is held in it, nor does it appear to  
be much on the increase there are about  
three hundred souls in it, and trades­  
men of different kinds.
