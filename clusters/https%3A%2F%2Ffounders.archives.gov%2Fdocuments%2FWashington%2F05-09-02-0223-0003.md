erous, compose but a small Proportion of her Laws. The Common Law is a Part, and by far the most important Part of her System of Jurisprudence. Statute Regulations are intended only for those Cases, comparatively few, in which the Common Law is defective, or to which it is inapplicable.

Law, in particular, which being intended for universal Reception, ought to be a plain Rule of Action, became a Science of the greatest Intricacy; especially when blended with the new and oppressive Refinements engrafted upon feudal Property; which Refinements, were from Time to Time, gradually introduced by the Norman Practitioners with a View to supersede (as they did in a great Measure) the more homely, but more free and intelligible Maxims of distributive Justice among the Saxons.
