We his Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the late representatives of the good people of this country, having been deprived by the sudden interposition of the executive part of this government from giving our countrymen the advice we wished to convey to them in a legislative capacity, find ourselves under the hard necessity of adopting this, the only method we have left, of pointing out to our countrymen such measures as in our opinion are best fitted to secure our dearest rights and liberty from destruction, by the heavy hand of power now lifted against North America: With much grief we find that our dutiful applications to Great Britain for security of our just, antient, and constitutional rights, have been not only disregarded, but that a determined system is formed and pressed for reducing the inhabitants of British America to slavery, by subjecting them to the payment of taxes, imposed without the consent of the people or their representatives; and that in pursuit of this system, we find an act of the British parliament, lately passed, for stopping the harbour and commerce of the town of Boston, in our sister colony of Massachusetts Bay, until the people there submit to the payment of such unconstitutional taxes, and which act  most violently and arbitrarily deprives them of their property, in wharfs erected by private persons, at their own great and proper expence, which act is, in our opinion, a most dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty and rights of all North America. It is further our opinion, that as TEA, on its importation into America, is charged with a duty, imposed by parliament for the purpose of raising a revenue, without the consent of the people, it ought not to be used by any person who wishes well to the constitutional rights and liberty of British America. And whereas the India company have ungenerously attempted the ruin of America, by sending many ships loaded with tea into the colonies, thereby intending to fix a precedent in favour of arbitrary taxation, we deem it highly proper and do accordingly recommend it strongly to our countrymen, not to purchase or use any kind of East India commodity whatsoever, except saltpetre and spices, until the grievances of America are redressed. We are further clearly of opinion, that an attack, made on one of our sister colonies, to compel submission to arbitrary taxes, is an attack made on all British America, and threatens ruin to the rights of all, unless the united wisdom of the whole be applied. And for this purpose it is recommended to the committee of correspondence, that they communicate, with their several corresponding committees, on the expediency of appointing deputies from the several colonies of British America, to meet in general congress, at such place annually as shall be thought most convenient; there to deliberate on those general measures which the united interests of America may from time to time require.  
A tender regard for the interest of our fellow subjects, the merchants, and manufacturers of Great Britain, prevents us from going further at this time; most earnestly hoping, that the unconstitutional principle of taxing the colonies without their consent will not be persisted in, thereby to compel us against our will, to avoid all commercial intercourse with Britain. Wishing them and our people free and happy, we are their affectionate friends, the late representatives of Virginia.

¢ WE his Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal Subjeéts, the late  
ﬁep‘refén;ativcs of the good People of this Country, having been  
deprived by the sudden Interposition of the cxecutive Part of  
this Government, from giving our Countrymen the Advice we  
wished to convey to them in a legislative Capacity, find our­  
{elves under the hard necessity of adopting this, the onlyMéthod  
we have left, of pointing odt to our Coutitrymién fuch&#x27;meafures  
g 5, in our Opinion, are best fitted to secure our dearest Rights  
and Liberties from Deftru@ion, by the heavy Hand of Power  
siow lifted again®t North-America. With much gricf we find  
that our dutiful Applications to Great-Britain for the Security  
of our just, ancieat, and constitutional Rights, have been not  
only difrcgarded, but that a determined System is formed and  
pressed, sos reducing the Inhabitants of British Ameri¢a to Sla­  
wery, by fubje&amp;ing thiem so the Pagdient of Taxés, irhpofed  
;{riihout the Cosfent of the Péople or their Representatives ; and  
that in parfuit of this Syflem, we find an A&amp; of the Britiflr  
Parliament, lately paffcd for the foping the Harbour agd Com­  
faerce of the Town of Boston, in our Sifter Colony of the Mas­  
sachusetts-Bay, until the People there, submit to the Payment  
6f such untconifitutional Taxes, and which A&amp; most violently  
4nd arbitrarily deprives themof their Property, inWharves erec­  
fed by private Persons, at their own great and proper Expence j  
which A&amp; is; in our Opiniod, = most dangerous Attempt to de­  
firoy the constitutional Liberty snd Rights of all North- Ameri­  
¢a. Rt is further outQpinion, thatas TEA, on it&#x27;s Importation  
into America, is charged with aDuty, imposed by Parliament for  
¢he purpose of raising # Revenue, without the Consent of the  
People, it ought not to be used by any Person who withes well tor  
the constitutional Rights and Liberty of Hritith Ametica. Abd  
wheseas the India Company have ungeneroully attempted the  
Ruin of Arserica, by fending many Ships loaded with Tea into  
the Calonies, thereby intending to fix a Précedent in’ favour of  
drbitsary Taxation, we déem it highly proper, and do accordingly  
fecommend it strongly to our Country, not to purchase or use  
any kind of Baft-TadiaCommodity whatfoever,extept Salt Petre  
&amp; Spices,aiitil the Grievances of America are redrefied. Weare  
farther clearly of Opinion, that an Alttéck made on one of our  
Sifter Colonices, to corhpel Submiflion to arbitrary Taxes, is an  
Attack madeon all Biitifif&#x27; America, and ‘threatens Ruin to the  
, Rights of us all, unless the uiited Wisdom of the whole World  
be applicd. And for this Purpoefe it is recommended to the  
Lommittee of Cotrefpbndence, that they coimunicate with the  
several correfpondingCommittees,on the Expedithey of appoint+
