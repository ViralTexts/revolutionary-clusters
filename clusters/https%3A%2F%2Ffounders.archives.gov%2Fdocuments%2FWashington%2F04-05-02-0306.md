[Philadelphia, 17 September 1787]  
  
We have now the Honor to submit to the Consideration of the United States in Congress assembled that Constitution which has appeared to us the most advisable.  
The Friends of our Country have long seen and desired that the Power of making War Peace and Treaties, that of levying Money &amp; regulating Commerce and the correspondent executive and judicial Authorities should be fully and effectually vested in the general Government of the Union. But the Impropriety of delegating such extensive Trust to one Body of Men is evident—Hence results the Necessity of a different Organization.  
It is obviously impracticable  in the fœderal Government Of these States to secure all Rights of independent Sovereignty to each and yet provide for the Interest and Safety of all—Individuals entering into Society must give up a Share of Liberty to preserve the Rest. The Magnitude of the Sacrifice must depend as well on Situations and Circumstances as on the Object to be obtained. It is at all Times difficult to draw with Precision the Lines between those Rights which must be surrendered and those which may be reserved⟨.⟩ And on the present Occasion this Difficulty was encreased by a Difference among the several States as to their Situation Extent Habits and particular Interests.  
In all our Deliberations on this Subject we kept steadily in our View that which appears to us the greatest Interest of every true american the Consolidation of our Union in which is involved our Prosperity Felicity Safety perhaps our national Existence. this important Consideration seriously and deeply impressed on our Minds led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on Points of inferior Magnitude than might have been otherwise expected. And thus the Constitution which we now present is  
  
the Result of a Spirit of Amity and of that mutual Deference &amp; Concession which the Peculiarity of our political Situation rendered indispensible.  
That it will meet the full and entire Approbation of every State is not perhaps to be expected. But each will doubtless consider that had her Interests been alone consulted the Consequences might have been particularly disagreable or injurious to others. That it is liable to as few Exceptions as could reasonably have been expected we hope and believe That it may promote the lasting Welfare of that Country so dear to us all and secure her Freedom and Happiness is our most ardent wish.

priety of delegating fuch extenfive trudto one body  
ml men is evident ; heme tefults the neceflity of a  
different orgamzuion.  
  
It is oovioufly impracticable in the federal govern-

dent fovereignty toeach, and yet to provide for the in-  
to ed and fafety of all - individuals entering into fo-

on the piefent occi.fien rhis difficulty was incieaied  
fcy a difference amor,&quot;, the fever al dates as to their fi-

Jnallourdcliberationson this fubject we kept ftea-

tend of eveiy true American, the consolidation of  
our union, in which is involved our ptofperity, fe-

important confederation, feiioufly and deeply impref-

lefs rigid on points of inferior magnitude, than night

thofe which may be referved ; and, on the prefent occafion,  
this difficulty was encreafed by a difference among the feveral  
States, as to their fituation, extent, habits, and particular inte

In all our deliberations on this fubject, we kept fteadily ino

It is obviouſly impracticable, in the Fœderal Government of  
theſe States, to ſecure all rights of Independent Sovereignty to  
each, and yet provide for the intereſt and ſafety of all. Indi-

draw with precision the line between those rights  
which must be surrendered, and those which  
may be reserved, and, on the present occa-

among the several states as to their situation, ex-

We have now the honor to submit to the consideration of the United  
States, in Céngress assembled, that Constitution which has appeared to  
us the mest advisable.  
  
The friends of our country have long seen and desired that the pow-  
er of waking war, peace, and treaties—that of levying money and re-  
gulating commerce, and the correspondent Execuwe and Judicial au-  
thorities—shall be fully and effectually vested in ‘he General Govern-

trust to one body of men, is evident. Thence results the necessity of a  
ditlerent organization. It is obviously impracticabe, in the federal go-  
vernment of these States, to secure all rights of incependent sovereign-  
ty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individu-  
als, eutering into society, must give up a share of liberty, to preserve  
the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must deyend as well on situ-

times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights

That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every State, 1s not,  
perhaps, to be expected. But each will doubtless consider, that, had  
her interest alone been consulted, the consequences might have been  
particularly disagreeable and injurious to others. ‘That it is liable to as

ablest expqiitulers of the Constitution.  
Gen. NVa-diirg on, who was President of the NaMonaK  
Convention that lormed Ihr Constitution, in transmitting  
it to Congress, u«es the fellow ing language: “The friends  
of our country have long se-n and desired, that the power  
ol making war, peace, and treaties, that of levying taxes  
and regulating commerce, and the correspondent execu­  
tive, and judicial authorities, should be fully and effectu­  
ally vested in the Genual Government of the Union :  
but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trusts to  
om; body ol men is evident—hence results the necessity  
ol a different organization”— (alluding to the old confedera­  
tion).  
  
Again, he says, “It jaobviously impracticable in (lie Fe­  
deral (loveriiiueut ol these States to secure the rights  
&quot;f independent sovereigt ty to c.irh, and yet provide lor  
the interest an 1 safety of all—Individuals entering in­  
to society inns&gt;t give up a slime of liberty to preren a tho  
rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well  
on situation and circumstances as on the objects to lie ob­  
tained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision  
the line between Iho^c rights which must be surrender­  
ed, and those which may he reserved.” &quot;In our delibe­  
rations on this subject, *ve kept steadily in our view that  
which appeared to ns the greatest intercift of every truo  
American, the consolidation of our Union, in which r*  
involved our prosperity, felicity, safely, perhaps our na­  
tional existence. This important consideration, seri­  
ously and deeply impressed upon our minds, led each  
State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of infe­  
tior magnitude, than might have heenofherwi.se expect­  
ed, ami thus llm Constitution which we now present, is  
the result of a spirit of amity, of that mutual deference  
and concession which the peculiarity ol eur political situ­  
a&#x27;ion rendered indispensable.

This difficulty did not cease by the unanimous act proposed by the  
general convention. In their letter submitting it to congress, we find  
them stating the same reasons which embarrassed their action, and  
long delayed its ratification by the states. “It is obviously imprac-  
ticable in the federal government of these states, to secure all rights  
of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest  
and safety of all.’ “It is at all times difficult to draw with preci-  
sion the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and  
those which may be reserved; and on the present occasion, this diffi-  
culty was increased by a difference of opinion among the several  
states, as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests :””  
“and thus the constitution which we present, is the result of a spirit  
of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession, which the  
peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.”

“ In Convention, September 17th, 1787.  
  
“Sir—We have now the honour to  
submit to the consideration of the United  
States in congress assembled, that con-  
stitution which appears to us most de-  
sirable. The friends of our country  
have long seen and desired that the  
  
wer of making war, peace, and trea-  
ties, that of levying money and regulat-  
ing commerce, and the correspondent  
  
  
  
executive and judicial authorities should  
be fully and effectually vested in the  
general government of the union; but  
the impropriety of delegating such ex-  
tensive trusts to one body of men is  
evident. Hence results the necessity of  
different organizations.  
  
‘“‘ It is obviously impracticable, in the  
federal government of these states, to  
secure all the — of independent  
sovereignty to each, and yet provide for  
the interest and safety of all. Indi-  
viduals roe into society, must give  
up a share of liberty to preserve the  
rest ; the magnitude of the sacrifice  
must depend as well on the situation  
and circumstances, as on the object to  
be attained. It is at all times difficult  
to draw with precision the line between  
those rights that must be surrendered  
and those which may {be reserved ; and  
on the present occasion this difficulty  
was occasioned by a difference among  
theseveral states as to their extent, situa-  
tion, habits, and particular interests.  
  
‘In all our deliberations on this sub-  
ject, we kept steadily in our view that  
which appears to us the greatest in-  
terest of every true American, the con-  
solidation of our. union, in which is in-  
volved our prosperity, felicity, safety,  
and perhaps our national existence.  
This important consideration, seriously  
and deeply impressed on our minds, led  
each state in convention, to be less rigid  
on ee of inferior magnitude, than  
might have been otherwise expected ;

‘Individuals entering into society, must give up a

name of common sense, what share of liberty we are  
to surrender? What liberty has the great Lawgiver  
given to any intelligent being, but todo rght? Can  
any rational being justly claim any other? Can he  
surrender this?  
  
‘It is difficult at all times to draw, with precision,  
  
the line between those rights which must be surrender-  
ed,and those which may be preserved,’ Do look at the  
two words, must and may, in the last sentence. In  
rights surrendered, it is absolute; in rights preserved,  
it is quite indifferent whether we have any left or not.  
In the confederacy and combinations in the political  
and ecclesiastical world, at present, it really seems to  
me the devil has almost the sole control. But now  
comes the climax. ‘In all our deliberations on this

constitution was formed. &quot; In all our deliberations on  
this subject&quot; (says Gen. Washington, as President of the  
convention, in the judicious letter which accompanies  
the constitution,) &quot;we kept steadily in our view that  
which appears to us the creates! interest of every true  
American?the consolidation of our Union?in which is  
involved our prosj&gt;crity, felicity, safety, perhaps our national  
existence. This important consideration, seriously  
and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the  
convention to be less rigul on points of inferior magnitude  
than inicht have been otherwise expected; and thus  
the constitution, which we now present, is th# result of  
a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and con  
cession which the peculiarity of our political situation  
rendered indispensable. That it will meet the full and  
entire approbation of every State, is not, perhaps, to He  
xjicclcd; but each will doubtless consider, that, had her

have been particularly disagreeable or injurious to

In Convention, September 17, 1787.  
Sir : We have now the honor to submit ti­  
the consideration of the United States in Con­  
gress assembled, that Constitution which has  
appeared to us the most advisable. y  
The friends of our country have long seea  
and desired that the power of making war, peaces--  
ana treaties, tnai oi levying money ana regula­  
ting commerce, and the correspondent executive  
and judicial authorities, should be fully and ef­  
fectually vested in the Genrat&quot; Government of  
the Union; but the impropriety of delegating  
such extensive trust to one body of men. is evi­  
dent : hence results the neceiSsiiyof a different  
organization. v  
It is obviously impracticable, in: the Federal  
Government of these Slates, to secure all rights  
of independent sovereignty to each, and yet  
provide for the interest and safety of all.- In­  
dividuals entering into society must give op a  
share of liberty to preserve the rest. The mag­  
nitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on  
situation and circumstance as on the object to be  
obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with  
precision the line between those which maybe  
reserved ; and on the present occasion this diffi­  
culty was increased by a difference amonglhe  
several States as to their situation, extent, habits,  
and particular interests.  
In all our deliberations on this subject, we  
kept steadily in our view that which appears to  
us the greatest interest of every true American  
the consolidation of our Union in which is  
involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps  
our national existence. This important consid­  
eration, seriously and deeply impressed on our  
minds, led each State in the convention to be  
less rigid on points of inferior magnifude  
might nave oeen otnerwise expeciea ;. ana lOTis

That it will meet the full and entire approba­

ted; but each will doubtless consider that, had  
her interest been alone consulted, the conse­  
quences might have been particularly disagree­

few exceptions as could reasonably have been

44 Sir: We have riow the honor to sub­  
mit to the consideration of the United States,  
in Congress assembled, that Constitution  
which has appeared to us the most advisable.  
&quot; The friends of our country have long  
seen and desired that the power of making  
war, peace, and treaties, that of levying  
money and regulating commerce, sad the  
correspondent executive and judicial authori­  
ties, should be fully and effectually vested  
in the General Government of the Union ;  
but the impropriety of delegating such ex­  
tenH cJrust to ono body of men is evident ;  
hence reVults 4he necessity of a different or­  
ganisation. -  
&quot; It is obviously impracticable in the Fed­  
eral Government of these States to seenre  
all rights of indeqendent sovereignty to each  
and yet provide for the interest and safety  
of all. Individuals entering into society  
must give up a share of liberty to preserve  
the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice  
must depend as well on situation and cir­  
cumstances as on the object to he obtained.  
It is at all times difficult to draw with pre­  
cision the line between those rights which  
must be surrendered and those which may  
be reserved ; and on the present occasion  
this difficulty was increased by a difference  
among the several States as to their situa  
tion, extent, habits, and particular interest  
... 1 ii&#x27;i . .1 ,.  
&quot;In all our deliberations on this subject&#x27;  
we kept steadily in our view that which ap­  
pears to us the greatest interest of every  
true American the consolidation of our

government of these States, to secure all rights   
of independent sovereignty to each, and yet   
provide for the interest and safety of all.—  
Individuals entering into society, must give   
up a share of liberty to preserve the rest.—  
The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend   
as well on situation and circumstance, as on   
the object to be obtained. It is at all times   
difficult to draw with precision the line be­  
tween those rights which must be surrender­  
ed, and those which may be reserved ; and on   
the present occasion this difficulty was in­  
creased by a difference among the several   
States as to their situation, extent, habits and   
particular interests.   
In all our deliberations on this subject we   
have kept steadily in our view, that which   
appears to us the greatest interest of every   
true American, THE CONSOLIDATION OP OUR   
UNION, in which is involved our prosperity, fe­  
licity, safety, and perhaps our national exis­  
tence. This important consideration, serious­  
ly and deeply impressed on our minds, led   
each State in the Convention to be less rigid   
on points of inferior magnitude, than might   
have been otherwise expected ; and thus the   
Constitution, which we now present, is the   
result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutu­  
al deference and concession which the peculiar­  
ity qf our political situation reudered indis­  
pensable.   
That it will meet the full and entire appro­  
bation of every State is not, perhaps, to be   
expected; but, each will doubtless consider,   
that had her interests been alone consulted,   
the consequences might have been particular­  
ly disagreeable or injurious to others; that it   
is liable to as few exceptions as could reason­  
ably have been expected, we hope and believe   
that it may promote the lasting welfare of &#x27;   
that country so dear to us all, and secure her   
freedom and happiness, is our most ardent   
wish.

tions. I will, sir, read to the House what was  
said by the convention that framed the Constitu-  
tion, through their president, in an address to the  
old Congress for the purpose of explaining the  
point that I make in reference to this matter:  
  
** The friends of our country have long seen and desired  
that the power of making war, peace, and treaties, that of  
levying money, and regulating commerce, and the corre- |  
spondent executive and judicial authorities, should be fully  
and effectually vested in the General Government of the |  
Union: but the impropriety of delegating such extensive  
trust to one body of men is evident; hence results the  
necessity of a different organization.  
  
** Itisobviovsly impracticable in the Federal Government  
of these States to secure all rights of independent sover-  
eignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety |  
of all. Individuals entering into society must give up a  
shure of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of  
the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circum-  
stance as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times  
difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights  
which must be surrendered and those which may be re-  
served; and on the present occasion, this difficulty was  
increased by a difference among the several States as to  
their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests.”’

In Convenliun, September, 17 1787.  
Sir—\\ e lisve now the honor to submit to  
the consideration of the United Slates, in  
Congress assentb&#x27;.ed. that Constitution which  
has appeared to ns the most advisable.  
1 lie fiiends of our country have long seen  
and desired, tiiat the power of making war,  
peace and treaties, that of levying money,  
and regulating commerce, and lire correspon­  
dent executive anil judical authorities, should  
he fully and itfictunlly Vested in Ihe General  
Government of the Union : but the iinpropri­  
ety of delegating such extensive trust to any­  
one body of men. is evident. Hence result&#x27;s  
the necessity of a different organization.  
It is obviously impiacticahle, in the Fed­  
eral Govern incut of these Stales, to secure all  
rights of independent sovereignly to each, and  
vet provide for Ihe interest and safely of all.  
Individuals entering into society must give  
up s share-of liberty to presetve the rest.—  
The magnitude-of Ihe sacrifice must depend  
as well on situation and ciiciimstunces, as on  
tlie object to lie obtained. It is at ail times  
difficult to draw with precision the line  
between those rights which must lie siincnd­  
ired and those which may be reserved : and  
on the present occasion ibis difficulty was  
increased by a difference among Ihe several  
Stales, as to their situation, extent, habits,  
end particular interests.  
In all our deliberations on (his subject, we  
kept steadily in our view that which appeals  
to us the gren&#x27;est interest of every true Ainere  
lean, the consolidation of our Union, in which  
is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety,  
and pi I haps oor national existence. This  
important consult ration, seriously’ and deeply  
impressed on our minds, led each State in the  
Convention to lie loss tigid on points of  
inftriormagnitude, than what might have  
been othei wise expected, and thus die Con­  
dilution which we now present, is the result  
of concession, which the pccn&#x27;iaiity of our  
political situation rendered indispensable.  
1 hat il will meet the full ami entiie appro­  
bation of every Blate is not, perhaps, to lie  
expected : hut each will doubtless consider  
that, had tier interest atone been consulted,  
the consequences might have been particular­  
ly disagreeable or injurious to others ; tiiat il  
is liable to as few exceptions as could reason­  
ably have been expected, we hope anil  
believe : ihat it may promote the lasting wel­  
fare of that country so dear to us all, and

In Convention, September 17,1787.  
  
Sir AAte have now tho honor to submit to tho  
consideration of the United States, in Congress  
assembled, that Constitution which has ajipeared  
to us the most advisable.  
  
The friends of onr country Ijavc long seen and  
desired, tliat the power of making war, peace, and  
treaties, that of levying money, and regulating  
commerce, and tho correspondent executive and  
judicial authorities, should be fully and effectually  
vested in the General Government of the Union ;  
but the impropriety of delegating such extensive  
trust to one boely of men, is evident. Hence re¬  
sults tho necessity of a diflerent organization.  
  
It is obviously impracticable, in tho Federal  
Government of these States, to secure all rights of  
independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide  
for the interest and safety of all. Individnals en¬  
tering into Society must give up a share of liberty  
to preserve tho rest. The magnitude of tho sacri¬  
fice must depend as well on situation and circum¬  
stance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all  
times difficult to draw wdth precision tho&#x27; lino be¬  
tween those rights which must bo surrendered  
and those which may bo reserved; and on tho  
present occasion this difficnlly was increased by a  
difference among the several States, as to then-  
situation, extent, habits, and particular interests.  
  
In all our deliberations on this subject, wo kept  
steadily in our view that which appears to ns the  
greatest interest of every true American, the con¬  
solidation of our union, in which is involved our  
prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps onr national  
existence. This important consideration, seriously  
and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State  
in the Convention to be less rigid on points of in¬  
ferior magnitude, than might have been otliorwiso  
expected, and thus the Conktitution which wo now  
present, is the result of a spirit of amity and of  
that mutual deference and concession, which tho  
peculiarity of our political situation rendered indis¬  
pensable.  
  
That it will meet the full and entire aiiprohation  
of every State is not, perhaps, to bo expected ; but  
each will doubtless consider that, had her interest  
alone been consulted, tho consequences might have  
been particularly disagreeable or injurious to  
others; that it is liable to as few exceptions as  
could reasonably have been expected, we hope and  
believe ; that it may promote the lasting welfare  
of that country so dear to us all, and secure her  
freedom and happiness, is our most ardent wish

IN* CONVENTION, Sept. 17, 1787.  
Silt:—Wo have now the honor to&#x27;  
submit to the consideration of the Uni­  
ted States, in Congress assembled, that  
Constitution which lias appeared to us  
the most advisable.  
  
&#x27; The friends of our country have long  
seen and desired, that the power of  
making war, peace and treaties, that of  
levying money, and regulating com­  
merce, and the correspondent executive&quot;  
and judicial authorities, should be fully  
and effectually vested in the General  
Government of the Union; but the  
impropriety of delegating such exten­  
sive trust to one body ol men, is evi­  
dent. Hence results the necessity of  
a different organization.  
It is obviously impracticable, in the&#x27;  
Federal Government of the*e States,  
to secure all rights of independent sov­  
ereignty to each, and yet provide for  
the interest and safety of all. Individ­  
uals entering into society must give up  
a share of liberty to preserve the rest.  
The magnitude of the sacrifice must  
depend as well on situation and circum­  
stances, as on the object to be obtained.  
It is at all times difficult to draw with  
precision the line between those rights  
which must be surrendered, aud those  
which may be reserved; aud on the  
present occasion the difficulty was in­  
creased by a difference among the sev­  
eral States, as to their situation and ex­  
tent, habits and peculiar interests.  
  
In all our deliberations on this sub­  
ject, we kept steadily in our view that  
which appears to us the solidatiou of  
our Union, in which is involved our  
prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our  
national existence. This important  
consideration, seriously and deeply im­  
pressed on our minds, led each State in  
the Convention to be less rigid on  
points of inferior magnitude, than

and thus the Constitution which we  
now present, is the result of a spirit of  
amity and that mutual deference and  
concession, which the peculiarity of our  
political situation rendered indispen­

That it will meet the full and entire&#x27;

haps, to be expected; but each will

In Convention, Sept.l7th, 1787.   
Srn,:—We have now the honor to submit to   
the consideration of the United States, in Con­  
gress assembled, the Constitution which has ap­  
peared to us the most advisable.   
  
The friends of our country have long seen and   
desired, that the power of making war, peace, and   
treaties, that of levying money, and regulating   
commerce, and the correspondent executive and   
judicial authorities, should be fully and effectually   
vested in the General Government of the Union;   
but the impropriety of delegating such extensive   
trust to one body of men is evident. Hence re­  
sults the necessity. of a different organization.   
It is obviously impracticable, in the Federal   
Government of these States, to secure all rights   
of independent sovereignty to each, and yet pro­  
vide for the interest and safety of all. Individu­  
als entering into Society must give up a share of   
liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of   
the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and   
circumstance, as on the object to be obtained.   
It is at all times difficult to draw with precision   
thii line between those rights which must be sur­  
rendered and those which may be reserved; and   
on the present occasion this difficulty was increased   
by ,a difference &#x27;among the several States, as to   
their situation, extent, habits, and particular inte­  
rests.   
  
In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept,   
steadily in our view that which appears to us the   
greatest interest oCevery,true American, the con­  
solidation of our union, in which is involved our   
prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps our National   
existence. .This iwportaut consideration,,seriously   
and deeply impressed on our winds, led each   
State in the Convention .to, be less rigiikon points   
of inferior magnitude, than might have been   
otherwise expected, and thus the Constitution   
which we now present, is the result of a spirit of   
amity and of that mutual deference and conces­  
sion, which the peculiarity of our political situa­  
tion rendered indispensable. it   
That it will meet the full and entire approba­  
tion of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected;   
but each will doubtless consider that, had her in­  
terest alone been consulted, the consequences.might

iv Coatesnios, September 17, 1187.  
Sir:--We have now the honor to suhmit to  
the considrration of the Uolked Sates, in  
Congress asscurbled, that Constitution which  
has appeared to s the most advisabie.  
The felends of our country have lang seen  
and desired, that the power of making war,  
 and treaties, that of levying money,  
and regulating commerce and the correspoe-  
deat executive and judicial auvhorities, should  
be fully and effectually vested in the General  
Government of the Uains; but the impre­  
priety of delegating sarh extensive trust t  
one body of men, is evident. Hener result  
the necessity of a different urganisation,  
It is obviously impracticable, in the Federal  
Goverament af these States, to secure ail  
rights of independent suvereignty to each,  
nd yet provide for the interest and safety of  
all. Individuais entering inte society must  
give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest  
The magnitude of the sacrinse mast degend  
swell on situation and elrenmstances, as on  
the abject to be obtained. It is at all times  
diffienit to draw with precision the lias   
tween those rights which must he surreader-  
ed, and those which may be reserved; and o  
the prercat occasion the dffie alty wasincreas,  
by a difference among the several States,  
s to their situation, extent, habits, and par­  
ticuler interests.  
in all our dellheratians on this sabject, w  
kept steadily in our view that which appears  
to us the greatest of every true American, th  
consolidation of our apion, in which is in-  
lved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhap  
eur national xistentr. This losportanta  
riously and deep&#x27;y impressed o  
our minds, led each State in the Conveation  
to be tess rigid on points of inferior magut-­  
ude, than might have been utherwise expects  
d; and thas the Constitution which we now  
present, is the result of a spirit of amity and  
of that mutuai deference of concession, which  
ts nesuliarity of our political situation sen­  
dored ladispensable.  
That it will meat the fall and entire appro­  
bation of every State is aof, porhaps to he  
pacted; but each will douhtless consider,  
that, had her interest alone been consulted,  
the consequenees might have heea particular-  
ly disagreeable or injurions to others; that  
t is lisble to as few exeeptions as could reas

impropriety of delegating such extensive

It is at all times difficult to draw with precis­  
ian the line between those rights which must  
be surrendered, and those which may be re­  
served ; aud on tbe present occasion, this dif­  
ficulty was increased by a diffetence among  
the several States as to their situation, extent,  
habits and paticular interests. In all our de­  
liberations on this subject, we kept steadily

Szrrxmßica 17, 1787.   
  
Sias We have now the honor to submit   
to the consideration of the United States   
in Congress assembled, that constitution   
which has appeared to us the most advisl   
able.   
  
The friends of our country have long   
seett&#x27;and desired, that the power of making   
war, peace and treaties ; that of levying   
money and regulating commerce, and the   
correspondent executive and judicial   
authorities, should be fully and effectually   
vested in the general government of the   
Union : but the impropriety of delegating   
such extensive trust to one body of men is   
evident—hence results the-necessity of a   
different organization.   
It is obviously impracticable in the fed.   
erat government of these States, to secure   
all rights of independent sovereignty to   
each, and yet provide for the interest   
and safety of ail: individuals enter   
ing into society must give up a slum   
of liberty to preserve the rest. The   
magnitude of the sacrifice must depend   
as well on situation and circumstance   
as on the object to be obtained. It is at   
all times difficult to draw with precision   
the line between those rights which must   
be surrendered and those which may be   
reserved ; and on the present occasion this   
difficulty was increased by a difference   
among the several States as to their situa.   
ation, extent, habits and particular inter­  
ests.   
  
In all our deliberations on this subject   
we kept steadily in our view, that which   
appears to us the greatest interest of every   
true American, the consolidation of our   
Union, in which is involved our prosperity,   
felicity, safety, perhaps our national exist•   
once. This important consideration, serious.   
ly and deeply impressed on our minds, led   
each State in the convention to be less rigid   
on points of inferior magnitude than might   
have been otherwise expected ; and thus   
the constitution, which we now present, is   
the result of a spirit of amity, and of that   
mutual deference and c9ncession which the   
peculiarity of our political situation ren­  
dered indispensable.   
That it will meet the fall and &#x27;entire   
  
approbation of every State is not, perhaps,   
to be expected; but each will doubtless   
consider, that had her interest been alone   
consulted the nsequances might have   
been partioul agreeable or injurious   
to others; that ble to as few excep•   
tions as could re ly have been expect­  
ed we hope and believe; that it may pro­  
mote the lasting welfare of that country so   
dear to us all, and secure her freedom and   
happiness, is our most ardent wish.

A friend has submitted the original address of the

address will indicate the character of the day ;  
We have now the honor to submit to the con­

that Constitution which has appeared to us the

Ix Convention, Sfpt. 17, 1787.  
Sik: We have now the honor to sub­  
mit to the consideration of the United  
States in Congress assembled, that Con­  
stitution w hich has appeared to us the  
most advisable, . - , tV -  
-: Tne mends Of &#x27;OUT j country have long ,  
seen and desired that the power of mak­  
ing war, peace, and treaties, that of levy-&quot;  
ing money and regulating commerce, and  
the correspondent executive and judicial  
authorities, should bp fully and effectual­  
ly vested in the General Government of  
the Union; but the impropriety of dele­  
gating such extensive trust to one body  
of men is evident : hence results the ne­  
cessity of a different organization.  
It is obviously impracticable, in the  
Federal Government of these States, to  
secure all rights of independent sover­  
eignty to each, ami yet provide for the  
interest and safety of all. Individuals  
enteriug into society must give up a share  
of liberty to preserve the rest. The  
magnitude of the sacrifice must depend  
as well on situation and circumstances  
as on the object to be obtained. It is at  
all times difficult to draw with precision  
the line between those rights which must  
be surrendered and those which may be  
reserved; and on the present occasion  
this difficulty was increased by a differ­  
ence among the several States as to their  
situation, extent, habits, and particular  
interests.  
In all our deliberations qn this subject  
we kept steadily in view that which ap­  
pears to us the greatest interest of every  
true American the consolidation of our  
Convention to be less rigid on oints of  
inferior magnitude than might have been  
otherwise expected; and thus the Con­  
stitution which we now present is the re­  
sult of a spirit of amity, and of that mu­  
tualdefferencc and concession which the  
peculiarity of our political situation ren­  
dered indispensable.  
That it will meet the full and entire  
approbation of every State, is not, per­  
haps, to be expected; but each will doubt­  
less consider that, had her interest been  
alone consulted, the consequences might  
have lieen particularlytlisagreeable or  
injurious to others; that it is liable to as  
few exceptions as could reasonably have  
been expected, we hope and ljelieve, that  
it inay promote the lasting welfare of  
that country so dear to us alL and secure  
her freedom and happiness, is our most  
ardent wish

In Convention, September 17t, 1787.  
SiR: We have now the honor to sub.­

States in Congress assembled, that Cone­  
stitution which has appeared to us the  
most admirable.  
It is obviously impracticable, in the

interest and safety of all. Individuals

which appears to us the greatest interest  
of every true American,--the consolida.­

our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps  
our national existence. This important  
consideration, seriously and deeply im  
pressed on our minds, led each State in  
the Convention to be less rigid on points  
of inferior magnitude than might have

September 17, 1787.  
Sia: We bare now the honor to submit  
to the consideration of the United States in  
Congress assembled, that Constitution  
which has appeared to us the most advisa­  
ble.  
The friends of our country hare long  
aeeu and desired that the power of making  
war, peace and treaties, that of levying  
money and regulating commerce, and the  
correspondent executive and judicial au­  
thorities. should be fully and effectually  
vetted in the General Government of the  
Union; but the impropriety of delegating  
aueli extensive trust to one body of men is  
evident; hence remits the necessity for a  
different organization.  
It is obviously impracticable in the Fed­  
eral Government of these Statee to secure  
all rights of independent sovereignity to  
each, and vet provide for the interest and  
safety of all. Individual* entering into so­  
ciety must give np a share of liberty to  
preeervo the rest. The magnitude of the  
sacrifice most depend ae well on situation  
and circumstance as on the object to be ob­  
tained. It is at all times diflicult to draw  
with preoision the line between those rights  
which must be surrendered and those which  
may be reserved; and, on the present occa­  
sion, this difficulty was increased by a  
difference among the several States as to  
their situation, extent, habits, and particu­  
lar interest#.  
In all our deliberations on the subject,  
w* kept steadily in our view that which ap­  
pears to us the greatest interest of every  
true American—the consolidation of our  
Union—in which is involved our prosper­  
ity, felioity, safety, perhaps our national  
sxistrnoe. This important consideration  
seriously and deeply impressed on onr  
minds, led each State in the Convention to  
be lees rigid on points of interior magni­  
tude than might have been otherwise ex­  
pected ; and thus the Constitution, which  
we now present, is the result of a spirit of  
amity, and of that mutual deference and  
conoession which the peculiarity of our po­  
litical situation render indispensable. That  
it will meet the full and entire approba­  
ted of every State is not, perhaps, to be  
expected; but each will doubtless consider  
that, had her interest been alone consulted,  
the oonseqnences might have been particu­  
larly disagreeable or Injurious to others.  
That it is liable to as few exceptions as  
oould reasonably have lx en expected, we  
hope and believe; that it may promote tbe  
lasting welfare of that country so dear to

from the address of that Convention to  
Congress in 1787 : &#x27; It is obviously  
impracticable, in the Federal Government  
of these States, to secure all rights of  
independent sovereignity to each, and  
yet provide for the interest and safety  
of all. Individuals entering into  
society must give up a share of liberty  
to preserve the rest. The magnitude of  
the sacrifice must depend as well on  
situation and circumstance as on the  
object to be attained. It is at all  
times difficult to draw with precision  
the line between those rights which must  
be surrendered, and those which must be  
reserved ; and on the present occasion  
this difficulty was increased by a  
difference among the several States, as  
to their situation, extent, habits, and  
particular interests. In all our  
deliberations on tnis subject we kept  
steadily in our view that, which appears  
to us the greatest interest of every  
true American, the consolidation of our  
union, in which is involved our  
prosperity, felbity, safety, perhaps our  
national existence. This important  
consideration, seriously and deeply  
impressed upon our minds, led each State  
in the Convention to be less rigid on  
points of inferior magnitude, than might  
have otherwise expected. And thus the  
constitution, which we mow present, is  
the result of a spirit of amity, and of  
that mutual deferene and conception,  
which the peculiaritygof our political  
situation rendered indispensible.&#x27; I

surrender or sacrifice is applicable to
