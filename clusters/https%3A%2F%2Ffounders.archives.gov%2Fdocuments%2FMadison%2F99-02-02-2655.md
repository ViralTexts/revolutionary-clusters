Confidential  
  
I have rec. the letter signed &quot;A friend of Union &amp; State rights&quot; inclosing two printed Essays under  
the same signature.  
It is not usual to answer communications without the proper names to them. But the ability &amp; motives  
disclosed in the Essays induce me to say in compliance with the wish expressed, that I do not consider the proceedings of  
Virginia in 98-99 as countenancing the doctrine that a State may at will secede from its  
constitutional compact with the other States. A rightful secession requires the consent of the others, or an abuse of the  
compact, absolving the seceding party from the obligations imposed by it  
In order to understand the reasoning on one side of a question it is necessary to keep in view the precise  
state of the question, and the positions and arguments on the other side. This is particularly necessary in questions  
arising under our novel &amp; compound System, of Govt and much error and confusion have grown out of a neglect of this  
precaution.  
The case of the Alien &amp; Sedition acts was a question between the Govt. of the U. S. and the  
Constituent Body; Virga. making an appeal to the latter agst. the assumption of power by the former.  
The case of a claim in a State to secede from its union with the others, resolves itself into question among  
the States themselves as parties to a Compact  
In the former case it was asserted agst. Virga. that the States had no right to interpose a legislative  
declarations of opinion, on a Constitutional point; nor a right to interpose at all agst. a decision of the Supreme Court  
of the U. S. which was to be regarded as a Tribunal from which there could be no appeal.  
The object of Virga. was to vindicate legislative declarations of opinion, to designate the several  
constitutional modes of interposition by the States agst. abuses of power; and to establish the ultimate authority of the  
States as parties to &amp; members of the Constitution, to interpose agst. the decisions of the Judicial as well as  
other branches, of the Govt: the authority of the Judicial being in no sense ultimate out of the purview &amp; forms  
of the Constitution.  
Much use has been made of the term &quot;respective&quot; in the 3d. Resolution of Virga. which asserts the right of the  
States in cases of sufficient magnitude to interpose for maintaining within their respective limits the authorities &amp;c  
appertaining to them; the term &quot;respective&quot; being construed to mean a constitutional right in each State separately to  
decide on &amp; to resist by force encroachments within its limits. But, to say nothing of the distinction between  
ordinary &amp; extreme cases, it is observable in this as in other instances throughout the Resolutions, the plural  
number &quot;States&quot;, is used in referring to them; that a concurrence &amp; co-operation of all might well be  
contemplated, in interpositions for effecting the objects within each; and that the language of the closing Resolution  
corresponds with this view of the 3d. The course of reasoning in the Report on the Resolutions required the distinction  
between a State &amp; States It surely does not follow from the  
fact, of the States or rather people embodied in them, having as parties to the compact, no tribunal above them, that in  
controverted meanings of the Compact, a minority of the parties can rightfully decide against the majority; still less  
that a single party can decide against the rest, and as little that it can at will withdraw  
itself altogether, from a compact with the rest  
The characteristic distinction between free Govts. and Govts. not free is that the former are founded on  
compact, not between the Govt &amp; those for whom it acts, but among the parties creating the Govt. Each of these  
being equal, neither can have more right to say that the compact has been violated and dissolved, than every other has to  
deny the fact, and to insist on the execution of the bargain An inference from the doctrine that a single State has a  
right to secede, at its will from the rest is that the rest wd. have an equal right to secede from it, in other words to  
turn it, against its will out of its Union with them. Such a doctrine would not, till of late, have been palatable any  
where, and no where less so than where it is now most contended for.  
A careless view of the subject might find an analogy between State secession, and personal individual  
expatriation. But the distinction is obvious and essential. Even in the latter case, whether regarded as a right impliedly  
reserved in the original Social compact, or as a reasonable indulgence, it is not exempt from certain condition It  
must be used without injustice or injury to the Community from which the expatriating party separates himself. Assuredly  
he could not withdraw his portion of territory from the common domain. In the case of a State seceding from the Union its  
domain would be dismembered, &amp; other consequences  brought on not less obvious than pernicious.  
I ought not to omit my regret, that in the remark on Mr Jefferson &amp; myself, the names had not been  
transposed  
Having many reasons for marking this letter Confidential I must request that its  
publicity may not be permitted in any mode or thro’ any channel. Among the reasons is the risk of misapprehensions or  
misconstructions, so common without more attention &amp; more development, than I could conveniently bestow on what is  
said.

Wishing to be assured that the letter has not miscarried, a single line, acknowledging its receipt will be  
acceptable.

(confidential.)  
I have received the letter signed &quot;A Friend  
of Union and Slate Rights,&quot; inclosing two  
Kssavs under the same signature.  
It is not usual to answer communications  
without the proper names to them. But the  
abilitv and the motives disclosed in the Es­  
says induce me to say. in compliance with  
tli3 wish expressed, that I do not consider  
the proceedings of Virginia in &#x27;98 &#x27;&#x27;9, as  
countenancing the doctrine that a State may  
at will secede from its&quot; Constitutional com­  
pact with the other States. A rightful seces­  
sion requires the consent o( the others, or an  
abuse of the compact absolving the seceding  
party from the obligations imposed by i~.  
??Iu order to understand the reasoning on  
0110 side of a question, it is necessary to keep  
in view the precise state of the question and  
the positions and arguments ou the other  
side. This is particularly necessary in ques­  
tions arising under our novel and compound  
system of government. Much error and  
confusion have grown out of a neglect of this  
precaution.  
The ease of the Alien and Sedition acts  
was a question between the Government and  
the Constituent Body, Virginia making an  
appeal to the latter .&quot;.gainst the assumption  
of power by the former.  
Tho case of :i claim in a State to secede  
from its union with the others, is a question  
among the States themselves as parlies to a  
compact.  
In the former case it was asserted against  
Virginia, that the States had no right to in­  
terpose Legislative declarations of opinion on  
a Constitutional point; nor a right to inter­  
pose at all against a decision of the Supreme  
Court of the Uuited States, which was to be  
regarded as a tribunal from which there  
could be no appeal.  
The object of Virginia was to vindicate  
ijcyislalivt declarations of opinion; to desig­  
nate the several Constitutional modes of in­  
terposition by the State against abuse-; of  
power; and to establish tho ultimate autiioi i­  
ty of the States as parties to and creators of  
the Constitution, to interpose against the de­  
cisions of the Judicial as well as the other  
?branches of the Government?the authority  
of the Judicial being in no sense ultimate,  
out of tho purview and form of the Constitu­  
tion.  
Much use has been made of the term &quot;re­  
spective&#x27;&#x27;in the 3d Resolution of Virginia,  
which asserts the right of the States, in eases  
of suiiicient magnitude, to interpose &quot;for  
maintaining within their respect ire limits,  
the authorities, ?fce., appertaining to thorn;&#x27;&#x27;  
the term &#x27;-respective&quot; being construed to  
meau a Constitutional right in each State,  
separately, to decided on and resist by force  
encroachments within its limits. A foresight  
or apprehension of the misconstruction might,  
easily have guarded against it. But, to say  
nothing of the distinction between ordinary  
and extreme cases, it is observable that in  
this, n&lt;&lt; in other instances throughout the Re­  
solutions. the plural number?S/.aks ? is used  
in referring to there; that a concurrence and  
co-oporaiioo of nil might we&#x27;ll be contempla­  
ted in interpositions for effecting the objects  
within each; and that the language of the  
closing Resolution corresponds with this view  
of the third. The course of reasoning in  
the Report ou the Resolutions required the  
distinction between a State and the. States.  
It surely dues not follow, from the lact oi  
the States, or rather the people embodied in  
Ihetn. having as parties to the Constitutional  
compact, no tribun.il above them, that, m  
controverted meanings of the compact, a mi­  
nority of the parties can rightfully decide  
against the majority; still less that * single  
party can decide against the rest; and as lit­  
tle that it can at will withdraw itself alto­  
trethei^from its compact with the rest.  
The characteristic cistinction between free  
Governments and Governments not free is,  
that the former are founded on compact, not  
between the Government and those for whom  
it acts, but among the parties creating the  
Government. Kach of &#x27;these being equal,  
neither can Have more right to say tnat J?e  
compact has been viol sited arid dissolved,  
than every other has to deny the fact, and to  
insist on the execution of the bargain. _ An  
inference from the doctrine tnat a sing:e  
State has a right to secede at will from the  
rest, is, that the rest would have an equal  
right to :-ecf&#x27;le from it: in other words, tp  
thru it. against its will, out of its union witn  
them. Such a doctrine would not, rill of late  
have been palatable anywhere, and uowhe/e  
less so than where it is now most contended

TooNrIDEaTialI  
I have received the letter signed &quot;A Friend of Union and  
State-Rights,&quot; enclosing two Essays un dor the same signature  
It is not usnal to answer communications without the proper  
names to them. But the ability and the motives disclosed in the  
Eesays induce me to say in comphance with the wish expressed,  
that I do not consider the proceedings of Virginis in  
ountenancing the doctrine that a State may af wit secede from  
npact with the other States. A rightful se-  
thers, or an abuse of th  
pact abeolving the seceeding party from the obligations imposed  
by it.  
In order to understand the reasoning on one side of a quostion,  
view the procise state of the question  
positions and arguments on the other side. This is par  
ions arising from our novel and com  
pound aystem of governmont. Much error and confusion have  
grown out of a neglect of this precaution.  
ase of the alien and sedition acts was a question between

the latter aguinst the assumption of pow  
ase of a claim in a State to socede from its union with  
ars is a question among the States themsoives as parties  
to a compact.  
In the former case it was asserted arainst Virgints that the  
States had no right to interpose legislative declarations of opin  
ion on a constitutional point; nor a right to interpose at all  
agalnst a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States  
which was to be regarded as a tribunal from which there could  
be no appeal. este teadat delaratian  
The ofject of Virginia was to vindicate lepisdutive declarations  
of opinion to destghnite the se veral coastirurnnal modes of in  
terposition by the Statee againat abuscs of power, and to estab  
lish the ultimate authority of the Statos as porties to aad ered  
fores of the Constitution to interpose axuinst the decisions of the  
sl ar well ar the other branohes of the Government the  
I thority of the judictal being tn no sense sitisate, out of the  
purviey and form of the Constitution.  
Much use has been made of the term &quot;respective&quot; in the  
ginia, which assorts the right of the States,  
in cases of sufficient magnitude, to interpose  for maintaining  
within their respectme limits the authoritios, ao,, appertaining to  
the term &quot;respective&quot; being oonstrued to mean a con  
stitutional right in racn State, apuruiely to deoide on and reaist  
e encroachments within its limits. A foreeight or appre  
a of the misconstruction might easily have guardod against  
But, to say anything of the distinction betwoen ordinary and  
extreme cases, it is obsorvable that in this, as in other!  
throughout the resolutions, the plur al number fofutes, is  
em; that a concurrence and cooperation of all  
well be contomplated in interpositions for efecting the of  
jechs within reach; and that the language of the cle sing reeolution  
conesponds with this view of the third. The course of reason

against it. But, to say nothing of the distinction be­  
tween ordinary and exteme cases, it is observable that,  
in this, as in other instinces throughout the Resolutions,  
the plural number--Stes- is used in referring to them,  
that a concurrence andco-operation of all might well be  
contemplated in interpeitions for effecting the objects  
within each; and that he language of the closing Reso­  
lutions corresponds wth this view of the third. The  
course of reasoning in the Report on the Resolutions re­  
quired the distinction letween a State and the States.  
It surely does not folow, from the fact of the States,  
or rather the people emtodied in them, having as parties  
to the Constitutional conpact, no tribunal above them,  
  
that, in controverted meinings of the compact, a minor­  
ity of the parties can rightfully decide against the ma­  
jority; still less that a sugle party can decide against  
the rest; and as little tha it can at will withdraw itself  
altogether from its compact with the rest.  
The characteristic distnction between free Govern­  
ments and Governments rot free is, that the former are  
founded on compact, not between the Government and  
those for whom it acts, hit among the parties creating  
the Government. Eich of those being equal, neither  
can have more right to sry that the compact has been  
violated and dissolved, than every other has to deny the  
fact, and to insist on the execution of the bargain. An  
inference from the doctrine that a single State has a right  
to secede at will from the rest, is, that the rest would  
have an equal right to secede from it; in other words,  
to turn it, against its wll, out of its union with them.  
Such a doctrine would rot, till of late, have been palat­  
able anywhere, and nowhere less so than where it is now  
most contended for.  
A careless view of the subject might find an analogy  
between State secession and individual expatriation. But  
the distinction is obvions and essential. Even in the lat­  
ter case, whether regarded as a right impliedly reserved  
in the original social compact, or as a reasonable indul­  
gence, it is not exempt from certain conditions. It must  
be used without injustice or injury to the community  
from which the expatriating party separates himself. As­  
suredly he could not withdraw his portion of territory  
from the common domain. In the case of a State sece­  
ding from the Union its domain would be dismembered,  
and other consequences brought on not less obvious than  
pernicious.  
I ought not to omit my regret, that in the remark on  
Mr. Jefferson and myself the names had not been trans­  
posed.  
Having many reasons for marking this letter confiden­  
tial, I must request that its publicity may not be permit­  
ted in any mode or through any channel. Among the  
reasons is the risk of misapprehensions or misconstruc­  
tion, so common, without more attention and develop­  
ment than I could conveniently bestow on what is said.  
With respect,  
JAMES MADISON.

ried, a single line acknowledging its receipt will be ac­

ing two under the same signature. |  
It is-not usual to answer communications  
without the proper names to them. But  
the ability and the motives disclosed in the!  
Essays induce me to say, in compliance with I  
the wish expressed, that I do not consider ;  
the proceedings of Virginia in ’9B-’99 as ;  
countenancing the doctrine that a State!  
may at will secede from its constitutional!  
compact with the other States. A right- *  
fill secession requires the consent of the |  
others, or an abuse of the compact absolving j  
the seceding party from the obligations im-1  
posed by it.  
In order to understand the reasoning on  
one side of a question, it is necessary to  
keep in view the precise state of the ques­  
tion and the positions and arguments on the;  
other side. This is particularly necessary !  
in questions arising under our novel and j  
compound system of government. Much i  
error and confusion have grown out of a;  
neglect of this precaution.  
The case of the alien and sedition acts was  
£ question between the Government and the  
constituent body, Virginia making an ap-1  
peal to the latter against the assumption of j  
power by the former. ! -  
The case of a claim in a State to secede ■  
from its union with the others is a question  
among the States themselves as parties to a  
compact.  
In the former case it was asserted against  
Virginia, that the States had no right to in­  
terpose legislative declarations of opinion on  
a constitutional point; nor a right to inter- &#x27;  
pose at all against a decision of the Supreme ■  
Court of the United States, which was to be ■  
regarded as a tribunal from which there i  
could be no appeal. i  
The object of Virginia was to vindicate &lt;  
legislative declarations of opinion ; to desig-1 &lt;  
Bate the several constitutional modes of in- j /  
terposition by the States against abuses of1  
power, and to establish the ultimate authori- i  
ty of the States as parties to and creatures I  
of the Constitution to interpose against the :  
decisions of the judicial as well as the other 1  
branches of the Government—the authority &lt;  
of the judicial being in no sense ultimate, j1  
out of the purview and form of the Consti- j  
tution. i i  
Much use has been made of the term “rc- i  
speetive” in the third resolution of Virginia, 1 j  
  
j3o rt iotmcTo limes  
  
which asserts the right of the States, in  
cases of sufficient magnitude, to interpose  
&#x27;“for maintaining within their respective  
limits the authorities, Ac., appertaining to  
them;” the term ‘■‘respective” being con­

jal compact, no tribunal above them, that,!  
| in controverted meanings of the compact, a  
minority of the parties can rightfully decide  
i against the majority, still less that a single  
party can decide against the rest, and as lit­  
tle that it can at will withdraw itself alto­  
gether from its compact with the rest.  
The characteristic distinction between free  
Governments and Governments not free is  
that the former are founded on compact, not j  
between the Government and those for whom  
it acts, but among-the parties creating the  
Government. Each of these being equal,  
neither can have more right to say that the  
compact has been violated and dissolved  
than every other has to deny the fact and  
to insist on the execution of the bargain.—  
An inference from the doctrine that a single  
Stati has a right to secede at will from the  
rest is that the rest would have an equal  
right to secede from it; in other words, to  
turn it, against its will, out of its union  
with them. Such a doctrine would not, till  
of late, have been palatable anywhere, and ,  
nowhere less so than where it is now most  
contended for.  
A careless view of the subject might find  
an analogy between State secession and in­  
dividual expatriation. But the distinction j  
is obvious and essential. Even in the latter  
case, whether regarded as a right impliedly  
reserved in the original social compact, or  
■as a reasonable indi*lgence,*it js not   
from certain conditions. It must he used  
without Injustice or injury to the communi­  
from which the expatriating party sepa- i  
tes himself. Assuredly he could not with- ,  
draw his portion of territory from the com-&#x27;  
mon domain. In the case of a State seced- j  
ing from the Union, its domain would be dis- i  
membered, and other consequences brought  
on not less obvious than pernicious.  
I ought not to omit my regret that in the  
remark on Mr. Jefferson and myself the  
names had not been transposed.  
Having many reasons for marking this!  
letter confidential, I must request that its I  
publicity may not be permitted in any mode •  
or through any channel. Among the rea- i  
sons is the risk of misapprehensions or mis- j  
constructions, so common, without more at­  
tention and development than I could con­  
veniently bestow on what is said. With 1  
respect, James Madison, i  
Wishing to be assured that the letter has  
not miscarried, a single line acknowledging  
j its receipt will be acceptable

** The case of the alien and sedition laws was a  
question between the Goverpment of the United  
States and the constituent body [the States], Vir  
ginia making an appeal to the latter against the  
assumptions of the former. Tbe case of a claim  
ina State to secede from its union with the  
others resolves itself into a question among the  
States themselves as parties to the contract. In  
the former case it was asserted agaiust Virginia  
  
The Nation.  
  
[by the protesting States] that the States had Lo  
right to interpose a /egislative declaration of  
opinion on a constitutional point; nor a right to  
Interpose at all against a decision of the Supreme  
Court of the United States, which was to be  
kegarded as a tribunal from which there could  
be no appeal) The object of Virgimia was to  
vindicate legislative declarations of opinion; to  
desiguate the several constitutional modes of  
interposition by the States agvinst abuses of  
power; and to establish the ultimate authority  
of the States, as purties to and creators of the  
Constitution, to interpose against the decisions  
of the judicial as well as other brancbes of the  
Government—the authority of the judicial being
