But, notwithstanding I have waited until this moment, it has so happened, that either from causes, unknown to me, or from events, which could not be controuled, I am yet unable to execute my original intention. That I may, however, fulfil the expectation given, as far as the actual situation of things will in my judgment permit; I now, in confidence, lay before Congress the following general statement.  
Our Minister near the French Republic has urged

It affords me the highest pleasure to inform Congress, that perfect harmony reigns between the two Republics; and that those claims are in a train of being discussed with candor, and of being amicably adjusted.
