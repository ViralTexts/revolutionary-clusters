Dear Sir  
Washington April 21. 1803.  
  
In some of the delightful conversations with you, in the evenings of 1798. 99. which served as an Anodyne to the afflictions of the crisis through which our country was then labouring, the Christian religion was sometimes our topic: and I then promised you that, one day or other, I would give you my views of it. they are the result of a life of enquiry &amp; reflection, and very different from that Anti-Christian system, imputed to me by those who know nothing of my opinions. to the corruptions of Christianity, I am indeed opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian, in the only sense in which he wished any one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others; ascribing to himself every human excellence, &amp; believing he never claimed any other. at the short intervals, since these conversations, when I could justifiably abstract my mind from public affairs, this subject has been under my contemplation. but the more I considered it, the more it expanded beyond the measure of either my time or information. in the moment of my late departure from Monticello, I recieved from Doctr. Priestly his little treatise of ‘Socrates &amp; Jesus compared.’ this being a section of the general view I had taken of the field, it became a subject of reflection, while on the road, and unoccupied otherwise. the result was, to arrange in my mind a Syllabus, or Outline, of such an Estimate of the comparative merits of Christianity, as I wished to see executed, by some one of more leisure and information for the task than myself. this I now send you, as the only discharge of my promise I can probably ever execute. and, in confiding it to you, I know it will not be exposed to the malignant perversions of those who make every word from me a text for new misrepresentations &amp; calumnies. I am moreover averse to the communication of my religious tenets to the public; because it would countenance the presumption of those who have endeavored to draw them before that tribunal, and to seduce public opinion to erect itself into that Inquisition over the rights of  conscience, which the laws have so justly proscribed. it behoves every man, who values liberty of conscience for himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others; or their case may, by change of circumstances, become his own. it behoves him too, in his own case, to give no example of concession, betraying the common right of independant opinion, by answering questions of faith, which the laws have left between god &amp; himself. Accept my affectionate salutations.

In some of the delightful conversa-  
tions with you in the evenings of  
1798 and 1799, the Christian religion  
Was sometimes our topic; and then I  
  
romised you that, one day or other,  
would give you my views of it.  
They are the result of a life of inquiry  
and reflection, and very different from  
that anti-christian system imputed to  
me by those who know nothing of  
my opinions. ‘To the corruptions of  
Christianity I am indeed opposed, but  
not to the genuine precepts of Jesus  
himself. I am a Christan, in the  
only sense in which he wished an  
  
one to be; sincerely attached to his  
doctrines, in preference to all others,  
aseribing to himself all human excel-  
lence, and believing he never claimed  
any other. At the intervals since  
these conversations, when I could  
justifiably abstract myself from other  
affairs, this subject has been under  
my contemplation: but the more I  
  
  
  
considered it, the more it ex nded  
beyond the measure of either my time  
or information. In the moment of  
setting out on a late journey, I received  
from Dr. Priestley his little treatise of  
** Socrates and Jesus Compared.” This  
being a section of the general view |  
had taken of the field, it became  
subject of reflection, while on the  
road, and unoccupied otherwise, The  
result was, to arrange in my mind a  
syllabus or outline of such an estimate  
of the comparative merits of Christ.  
ianity, as | wished to see executed by  
some ane of more leisure and informa.  
tion for the task than myself. This]  
now send you, as the only discharge  
of my,promise 1 can probably ever  
exccute; and in confiding it to you,  
I know it will not be exposed to the  
malignant. perversions of those, who  
make of every work on the subject of  
religion a text for misrepresentations  
and calumnies. I am moreover averse  
to the communication of my religious  
tenets to the public, because it would  
countenance the presumption of those  
who have endeavoured to draw them  
before that tribunal, and to seduce  
public opinion to erect itself into that  
inquisition over the rights of com  
science, which the laws have so justly  
prescribed. It behoves every man,  
who values liberty of conscience for  
himself, to resist invasions of it in the  
case of others ; it behoves him too, in  
his,own case, to give no example of  
concession, betraying the common  
right of independent opinion, y

every hitman excellence, and believing he nev­

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
W AsHINGTEN, APRIL 21, 1803,  
Dear Sir:  
  
.. In some of the delightful conversations  
with you, in’the evenings of 1798-99, and  
‘which sers .. anodyne to the afllictions  
of the crisis through which our country was  
then laboring, the christian religion was  
[Smmrvnr topioy and I then _promised  
you, that one day or other, I would give you  
my views of it. &#x27;They are the result of a life  
of inquiry and reflection, and very different  
from that anti-christian system imputed to  
me by those who know nothing of my opin­  
ions. T&#x27;o the corruptions of Christianity I  
am indeed opposed ; but not to the genuine  
preeepts of Jesus himself. lam a christian  
1 the only sense in which he wished any one  
to be ; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in  
preference to all others ; ascribing to himself  
every human excellence ; and believing he  
never claimed any other. All the short in­  
tervals since these conversations, when I  
could justifiably abstract my mind from pub­  
lic affairs, the subject has been under my  
contemplation. But the more 1 consider it  
the more it expanded beyond the measure of  
either my time or information. In the mo­  
ment of my late departure from Monticello,  
I received from Doctor Priestly his little trea-‘  
tise of “Socrates and Jesus compared.”’—  
This being a section of the general view I  
had taken of&#x27;the field, it becomes a subject of‘  
reflection while on the road, and unoccupied  
otherwise. The result was, to arrange in  
my mind a syllabus, or subline of such an es­  
timate of the comparative merits of christian­  
ity, as I wished to see executed t;y some one  
of more leisure and information for the task  
than myself.—This I now send you, as the  
only discharge of my promise I can probably  
ever execute. And in confiding it to you, I  
know it will not be exposed to the malignant i  
perversions of those who make every word  
from me a text for new misrepresentations  
and calumnies. lam moreover averse to the  
communication of my religious tenets to the  
public ; because it would countenance the  
presumption of those who have endeavored  
to draw them before that tribunal, and to se­  
duce public opinion to erect itself into that  
inquisition over the rights of conscience,  
which the laws have so justly prescribed. It  
behooves every man who values liberty of  
conscience for himself, to resist invasions of  
it in the case of others; or their case may,  
by change of circumstances, become his own.  
It behooves him too, in his own case, to give  
no examgle of concession, betraying the com­  
‘mon: right of “independent opinion, by an­  
swering questions of faith, which the laws  
have left between God and himself. = Accept  
my affectionate salutations. - ,
