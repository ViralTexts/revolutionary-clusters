y dear Sir  
Boston Novemr: 25th: 1790  
  
I lately received your Letter of the 18th: of October.— The Sentiment, and observations contained in it demand my attention.  
A Republic, you tell me, is a Government in which “the People have an essential share in the Sovereignty”; Is not the whole sovereignty, my friend, essentially in the People? Is not Government designed for the Welfare, and happiness of all the People? and is it not the uncontroulable essential right of the People to amend, and alter, or annul their Constitution, and frame a new one, whenever they shall think it will better promote their own welfare, and happiness to do it? That the Sovereignty resides in the People is a political doctrine which I have never heard an American Politician seriously deny. The Constitutions of the American States reserve to the People, the exercise of the rights of Sovereignty; by the annual, or biennial elections of their Governours, Senators, &amp; Representatives: and by empowering their own Representatives to impeach the greatest officers of the State, before the Senators who are also chosen by themselves.  
We the People is the stile of the fœderal Constitution— They adopted it; and conformably to it, they delegate the exercise of the Powers of Government to particular persons, who after short intervals resign their Powers to the People: and they will re-elect them, or appoint others, as they think fit.  
The American Legislatures are nicely balanced: They consist of two branches, each having a check upon the determinations of the other: they sit in different chambers, and probably often reason differently in their respective Chambers on the same questions—if they disagree in their decisions, by a conference their reasons, and Arguments are mutually communicated to each other: Candid explanations tend to bring them to agreement; and then according to the Massachusetts constitution, the matter is laid before the first Majistrate for his revision— He states objections, if he has any, with his Reasons, and returns them to the Legislators, who by larger Majorities ultimately decide. Here is a mixture of three Powers founded in the Nature of Man; calculated to call forth the rational Faculties, in the great points of Legislation, into exertion; to cultivate mutual Friendship, and good humour, and finally to enable them to decide, not by the impulse of passion, or party prejudice, but by the calm  
  
Voice of Reason, which is the Voice of God:— In this mixture you may see your “natural, and actual Aristocracy among mankind,” operating among the several Powers in Legislation, and producing the most happy Effects— But the Son of an excellent Man may never inherit the great qualities of his father; this is common observation and there are many instances of its truth: Should we not therefore conclude that hereditary Nobility is a solecism in Government? Their Lordships Sons, or Grand sons may be destitute of the faintest feelings of honor, or honesty; and yet retain an essential share in the Government by right of inheritance from Ancestors, who may have been the Minions of Ministers—the favourites of Mistresses, or Men of real, and distinguished Merit. The same may be said of hereditary Kings; Their Successors may also become so degenerated, and corrupt as to have neither inclination, nor capacity to know the extent, and Limits of their own Powers, nor consequently those of others— Such kind of Political Beings, Nobles, or Kings, possessing hereditary right to essential shares in an equipoized Government are very unfit persons to hold the scales; Having no just conception of the Principles of the Government, nor of the parts which they, and their copartners bear in the administration; they run a wild career, destroy the checks, and ballances, by interfering in each others departments, till the Nation is involved in confusion, and reduced to the danger, at least, of Bloodshed to remove a Tyranny, which may ensue— Much safer is it, and much more does it tend to promote the Welfare and happiness, of Society to fill up the offices of Government after the mode prescribed in the American Constitution, by frequent Elections of the People. They may indeed be deceived in their choice; they sometimes are; but the Evil is not incurable; the Remedy is always near; they will feel their mistakes, and correct them.—  
I am very willing to agree with you in thinking, that improvement in Knowledge, and Benevolence received much assistance from the principles, and Systems of good Government: But is it not as true that without knowledge, and benevolence Men would neither have been capable or disposed to search for the principles, or form the System— Should we not, my friend, bear a gratefull remembrance of our pious and benevolent Ancestors, who early laid plans of Education; by which means Wisdom, Knowledge, and Virtue have been generally diffused among the body of the people, and they have been enabled to form and establish a civil constitution calculated for the preservation of their rights, and liberties— This Constitution was evidently  
  
founded in the expectation of the further progress, and “extraordinary degrees” of Virtue. It injoyns the encouragement of all Seminaries of Literature, which are the nurseries of Virtue depending upon these for the support of Government, rather than Titles, Splendor, or Force— Mr. Hume may call this a “Chimerical Project”;— I am far from thinking the People can be deceived by urging upon them a dependance on the more general prevalence of Knowledge, and Virtue: It is one of the most essential means of further, and still further improvements in Society, and of correcting, and amending moral sentiments, and habits, and political institutions; ’till “by human means” directed by divine influence; Men shall be prepared for that “happy, and holy State” when the Messiah is to reign—  
“It is a fixed Principle that all good Government is, and must be Republican.”— You have my hearty concurrence; and I believe we are well enough acquainted with each others Ideas to understand what we respectively mean when we “use the Word with approbation”—The Body of the People in this Country are not so ignorant as those of England were in the Time of the Interregnum Parliament.— They are better educated: they will not easily be prevailed upon to believe that a Republican is “as unamiable as a Witch, a Blasphemer, a Rebel, or a Tyrant.” They are charmed with their own forms of Government, in which is admitted a mixture of Powers to check the human passions, and controul them from rushing into exorbitances— So well assured are they, that their liberties are best secured, by their own frequent, and free Election of fit persons to be the essential sharers in the administration of their Government; and that this form of Government is truly Republic, that the body of the People will not be perswaded, nor compelled to “renounce, detest, and execrate the very Word Republican as the English do.”— Their Education has confirmed them [“]in the opinion of the necessity of preserving, and strengthening the Dykes against the Ocean, its Tydes, and Storms,” and I think they have made more safe, and more durable Dykes, than the English have done—  
We agree in the Utility of univeral Education, but “will nations agree in it as fully, and extensively, as we do?[”] Why should they not? It would not be fair to conclude, that because they have not yet been disposed to agree in it, they never will. It is allowed, that the present age is more enlightened, than former ones. Freedom of enquiry is certainly more encouraged: The feelings of humanity have softned the heart: The true principles of civil, and religious Liberty are better understood: Tyranny, in all its shapes, is more detested, and bigotry,  
  
if not still blind, must be mortified to see that she is despised. Such an age may afford at least a flattering Expectation that Nations, as well as individuals, will view the utility of universal Education in so strong a light as to induce sufficient national Patronage, and Support.— Future Ages will probably be more enlightned than this.  
The Love of Liberty is interwoven in the Soul of Man— “So it is in that of a Wolf”; However irrational, ungenerous, and unsocial the love of liberty may be in a rude Savage, he is capable of being enlightned by Experience, Reflection, Education, and civil, and Political Institutions. But the Nature of the Wolf is, and ever will be confined to running in the forest to satisfy his hunger, and his brutal appetites; the Dog is inclined in a more easy way to seek his living, and fattens his sides with what comes from his masters kitchen.— The Comparison of La Fontaine is in my opinion ungenerous, unnatural, and unjust.—  
Among the Numbers of Men, my friend, are to be found not only those who have “preferred ease, slumber, and good chear to liberty”; but others, who have eagerly sought after Thrones, and Sceptres, hereditary shares in Sovereignty Riches, and Splendor, Titles, Stars, Garters, Crosses, Eagles, and many other childish play things, at the expence of real Nobility, without one thought, or care for the liberty, and happiness of the rest of Mankind.— “The People, who have no property feel the Power of governing by a majority; and ever attack those who have property.”— “The injured Men of Property recur to finess, trick, and Stratagem,” to outwit them: True; These may preceed from a Lust of domination in some of both parties.— Be this as it may; It has been known, that such deceitfull tricks have been practiced by some of the rich upon their unsuspecting fellow Citizens; to turn the determination of Questions, so as to answer their own selfish purposes, to plunder or filch the rights of Men are crimes equally immoral, and nefarious; tho committed in a different manner: Neither of them is confined to the Rich, or the Poor; they are too common among both. The Lords as well as commons of Great Brittain by continued large majorities endeavoured by Finess, Tricks, and Stratagems, as well as Threats to prevail on the American Colonies to surrender their Liberty and Property to their disposal.— These failing, they attempted to plunder our rights by force of Arms— We feared their Arts more than their Arms. Did the Members of that hereditary House of Lords, who constituted those repeated majorities, then possess the spirit of Nobility? Not so, I think: That Spirit resided in the illustrious Minorities in both Houses.— But “by Nobles”  
  
who have prevented “one hideous Despotism as horrid as that of Turkey from falling to the lot of every Nation of Europe[”]; you mean “not peculiarly, an hereditary Nobility, or any particular Modification,[’] but “the natural, and actual Aristocracy among Mankind”; The existence of which, I am not disposed to deny.— Where is this Aristocracy to be found? Among Men of all Ranks, and Conditions. The Cottages may beget a wise Son; the Noble, a Fool: The one is capable of great Improvement—the other not. Education is within the Power of Men, and Societys of Men—Wise. and judicious Modes of Education, patronized, and supported by communities, will draw together the Sons of the rich, and the poor, among whom it makes no distinction; it will cultivate the natural Genius, elevate the Soul, excite laudable Emulation to excel in Knowledge, Piety, and Benevolence, and finally it will reward its Patrons, and Benefactors by sheding its benign Influence on the Public Mind.— Education inures Men to thinking, and reflection, to reasoning and demonstration. It discovers to them the moral and religious duties they owe to God, their Country and to all Mankind.— Even Savages might, by the means of Education, be instructed to frame the best civil, and political Institutions with as much skill and ingenuity, as they now shape their Arrows. Education leads youth to “the Study of human nature, society, and universal History” from whence they may “draw all the Principles” of Political Architecture, which ought to be regarded— All Men are “interested in the truth.” Education by shewing them “the End of all its consequences” would induce, at least, the greatest numbers to inlist on its side. The Man of good understanding who has been well educated, and improves those advantages as far as his circumstances will allow, in promoting the happiness of Mankind, in my opinion, and I am inclined to think in yours is indeed “well born.”— It may be “puerile, and unworthy of Statesmen” to declame against Family Pride; but there is and always has been such a ridiculous kind of Vanity among Men. “Statesmen know the evil, and danger is too serious to be sported with.” I am content they should be put into one hole; as you propose, but I have some fears that your Watchmen on each side will not well agree. When a Man can recollect the Virtues of his Ancestors; he certainly has abundantly more solid satisfaction, than another who boasts that he sprang from those, who were rich, or noble; but never discovers the least degree of Virtue, or true worth of any kind, “Family Popularity,” if I mistake not, has its source in family pride; It is by all means sought after, that hommage may be paid to the name of the Title, or Estate, to supply the want, in the  
  
possessor, of any great, or good quality whatsoever— There are individuals among Men, who study the art of making themselves popular, for the purpose of getting into Places of Honour, and Emoluments, and by these means of gratifying hereafter the noble Passion—Family Pride—Others are so inchanted with the Musick of the sound, that they conceive it to be supreme felicity. This is indeed Vanity of Vanities, and if such deluded Men ever come to their Senses, they will find it to be vexation of Spirit. When they reflect on their own folly, and injustice in having received the breath of Applause with avidity, and great delight, for Merrit which they are conscious they never had; and that many who have been the loudest in sounding their praises, had nothing in view, but their own private, and selfish interests, it will excite in them the feelings of shame, remorse, and self contempt—  
The truly virtuous Man, and real Patriot is satisfied with the approbation of the wise, and discerning; he rejoices in the contemplation of the Purity of his own Intentions, and waits in humble hope for the Plaudit of his final Judge—  
I shall hardly venture again to trespass on the Benevolence of our Confidential Friend— You will not be sorry; it will afford you Reliefe, for in common Civility you must be at the Trouble of reading ones Epistles. I hope there will be a Time when we shall have “sweet Communion” together. In the mean Time let me not lose the Benefit of your valuable Letters. Adieu. Believe me / Your sincere Friend

A republic, you tell me, is a govern­

to amend and alter or annul their con­

fhall think it will better-promote  
their oWn well are and liappinels to do it ?  
That the I&#x27;ivereignty refides in the peo­  
ple, is a political doctrine which 1 have  
never hero-J an American politician fe­  
riouiiy deny. Tlie conftitutions of the  
American States refgrve people­  
the exercife of the rigl • i ignty,  
by th r annual or biennial elections of  
their governors, fenators and rtprefen-  
Utives ; and by empowering their own  
reprefentatiyes to impeach.the greatt&#x27;l  
em&quot; xrs of tiie fhte before the fenators,  
who are alio chofen by themfelves. We  
the people, is the fiyle of the federal con­  
fiitution :—they ad. y.-d it ; and, confor­  
mably to it, they delegate the exercife  
of the powers of government to parti­  
cular perfon*| who, a&#x27;tir fhort intervals,  
refign their p-JWers to the people, and  
they will re-elecl them, or appoint others,  
as they think fit.

But the fon of an excellent man may  
never inherit the great qualities of his &#x27;

there are many inftances of its truth.

of education &#x27;{ by which means, wiidoin,  
• knowledge and virtue have been general­  
ly diffused among the body ot&quot; the peo­  
ple, and they have been enabled to form j  
, and eflablirh a civil confiitution, calcu-j  
lated for the preservation .of their rights  
and liberties. This confiitution -was i  
evidently founded in the expectation of |  
the further progrefs and extram dinary]  
degrees of virtue ; it enjoins the encour- J  
ment of all feminaries of literature, j  
which are the nurleries ot virtue, de-|  
pending upon thefe for the fupport or  
government, rather than titles, fplen­  
dor or force. Mr. Hume, may call this  
a •• chi.mercial project ;&quot; I am far from  
thinking the people can be deceived by  
urging upaa them a dependance on the  
more general prevalence of knowledge  
and virtue. It is one of the in oft I  
tia! means of Umber, and ltill further im­  
provements in fociety : awd of cone cling  
and amending moral fbntirnents and ha­  
bits and political inftitutions ; till,&quot; by  
human means,&quot; directed by divine influ­  
ence, men fhall be prepared for that  
&quot; happy and holy Hate,&quot; when &quot;the  
Mefiiah is to reign.&quot;  
&quot; It is a fixed principle that all good  
government is, and mull be, republican.&quot;  
You have my hearty concurrence ; and.  
I believe, we are well enough acquainted  
with each other&#x27;s ideaa tg. underhand  
what we refpectively mean, when we  
&quot; u!V the word with approbation.&quot; The  
body of the people in this country arc  
not fo ignorant, as thofe in England  
were, in the time of the interregnum  
intent- Ihey arc better educated ;  
! they will not eafily be prevailed upon to  
at &quot; a republican is as muimia­  
, a bhii&#x27;j-Jifmcr, a rebel, or  
They are charmed with theii  
own forms of government, in which arc

the human pall.nns, and control them  
o well  
M.ties are

free ebiM lis to be  
the eOVntiril filacers in the adminillra­  
tion oftb ■: ment, and that this  
form of gov. rnim-nt ii truly republican ;  
tb.it the body ol the people will not be  
per funded nor Compelled to&quot; renoui  
11 and execrate&quot; ihe very word re­  
pubtiedn, &quot;ss the Engliih do.&quot; Their  
education his &quot; confirmed them in the  
opinion of the neceffity of prefervipg  
and ftrengthening the dykes againft the  
ocean, its tides and ftorins ;&quot; and 1 think  
they have made more fafe and more du­  
rable dykes than the Englifh have done.  
We agree in the utility of univerfal  
education, but, &quot; will nations agree in  
it as fully and fXtenfively as we do?&quot;  
Why (hould they not ? It would not be  
fair to conclude, that becaufe they have  
Hat yet been iJifppfed to agree in it, they  
never will. It is*allowed that the pre­  
fent age is more enlightened than former  
ones. Freedom of inquiry is certainly  
more encouraged ; the feelings or huma- I  
nily have foftened the heart; the true  
principles of civil and religious liberty  
j are better underflood ; tyranny in all its  
Mhapes, is more detefted ; and bigotiy, if  
I not ftill blind, mull be mortified to fee  
I that fhe is defpifed. Such an age may  
I afford a flattering expectation that ntm­  
j ons, as well as individuals, will view &#x27;  
I the utility of universal education in fo  
flrong a light as to induce fufficient na­  
tional patronage and lupport. Future  
ages will probably be more enlightened  
than this  
The love of liberty is interwoven in

and unfci.il the love of liberty may be &#x27;,  
in a rude fa vagi, he is capable of being &#x27;  
enlightened by experience, reflection,  
education, and civil and political inftitu­  
tions. But, the nature of the wolf is,  
and ever will be, confined to running in  
the foreft to fatisfy his hunger and his  
brutal appetites ; the dog is inclined, in  
a very eafy way, to feci; his living ; and

i qually immoral and nefarious, though I  
, committed in different manners. Nei- j  
j ther of them is confined to the rich or [

to prevail on the American colonies to j

LETTER IV.  
Boston, November 20, 1790.  
  
Dear Srp,  
  
LATELY received your letter of the 18th of O&amp;ober.—  
  
The sentiments and observations contained init demand my  
attention.  
  
A republic, you tell me isa government in which the ‘ people  
have an essential share in the sovereignty.” Is not the whole  
sovereignty, my friend, essential in the people ? Is not govern-  
  
ment defigned for the welfare and happiness of all the people ?  
and is it not the uncontrolable, essential right of the people to  
amend and alter or annul their conttitution, and frame anew one,  
whenever they shail think * will better promote their own wel-  
fare and happiness to do it? That the sovereignty refides im the

JOHN ADAMS [ 143 J  
ut  
  
of people, is a political doctrine which I have never heard.an Ame-  
ce rican politician seriously deny. The conititutions of the Ameri-  
a | can States reserve to the people the exercise of the rights of sove-  
ch &#x27;  reignty, by the annual or biennial election of their governors,  
1k &#x27; senators and representatives toimpeach the greate{t officers of  
ry the ftate before the senators, who are also chosen by themselves.  
bé We the people, is the {tyle of the federal con{titution : they adopt-  
te ed it; and conformably to it, they delegate the exercise of the  
_ powers of government to particular persons, who, after short in-  
= tervals, relign their powers to the people, and they will re-elect  
  
Ke them, or appoint others, as they think fit.  
“ | The American legislatures are nicely balanced. They confift  
3 _ of two braches, each having a check uponthe determinations of  
iS _  theother. They fitin different chambers, and probably often  
reason differently in their respeétive chambers, on the same ques-  
ies | tion :—if they disagree in their decifions, by a conference, their  
I~ _ reasons and arguments are mutually communicated to each other.  
. Candid explanations tend to bring them to agreement ; and then  
according to the Massachusetts conftitution, the matter is laid be-  
as | fore the firlt magittrate for his revifion. He ftates objections, if  
al _ he has any, with his reasons, and returns them to the legislators,  
a _ who by larger majorities, ultimately decide.—Here is a mix-  
f ture of three powers, founded in the nature of man ; calculated  
. | to call forth the rational faculties, m the great points of legisla-  
. | tion into exertion ; to cultivate mutual friendship and good hu-  
  
mour ; and, finally, to enable them to decide, not by the impulse  
of paffion or party prejudice, but by the calm voice of reason,  
which isthe voice of God. In this mixture you may see your  
“natural and actual arittocracy among mankind” operating  
among the several powers in legislation, and producing the mott  
happy effects. But the son of an excellent man may never inher-  
it the great qualities of his father ; this isa common observation  
and there are many inftances of its truth. Should we not there-  
&#x27; fore, conclude, that hereditary nobility is a solecism in govern-  
ment? Their lordships’ sons, or grandsons, may be deftitute of  
the fainteft feelings of honor or honetty, and yet retain an essen-  
tial share in the government, by right of inheritance from his an-  
ceftors, who may have been the minions of miniltters, the favorites  
of miftresses, or men of real and diitinguished merit- The same  
may be said of hereditary kings: Theirsuccessors may also be-  
| _ come so degenerated and corruptas to have neither inclination  
) nor capacity to know the extent and limits of their own powers,  
nor, consequently, those of others. Such kind of political beings  
nobles, or kings, posseflmg hereditary right to essentéal shares

f 144 ] POLITICAL PRINCIPLES OF  
  
Iman equipoised government, are very unfit persons to hold the  
scales. Having nojutt conception of the principles of the gov-  
ernment, nor ot the part w hich they and their copariners bear in  
the admin iflration, they runa wild career, de (troy the checks and  
balances, by interi ering i ia cach others departments, till the nation  
is involved in confufion, anc veduced to the danger, at leatt, of  
bloodshed, to remove a&#x27;tyranny which may ensuc. Much safer  
is it, and much more does it ttnd to promote the welfare and hap-  
piness of soc:ety, to fill up the oflices of government aiier the mode  
prescribed in ihe “+ spagtinny Cenititucions, by frequent elections  
otithe people. They ma age be deceived in their choice :  
they sometimes are. But the evil is not incurable ; the remedy  
is always near ; they will feci tneir miitakes and corre ét them.  
  
i am very willing toagree with you in tlinkog, that improve-  
menis in knowledge and benevolence receive much affiitance  
from the principles and s Sy ftems ec good x rovernment. But 1s tt  
not as true, that without knowledge and cen revoience, men would  
neither have been capable nor disposed to search for the princi-  
ples or form the syitem! Should we not, my friend, beara grate-  
ful reraembrance of our pious and benevolent anceftors, who  
early laid plans ox education! by Witich means, wisdom, know-  
ledge and virtue have bent generally diffused among the body of  
the | peopie, and they have been enabled to form and eftablish a  
civil conftitution, calculated for the preservation of their rights  
and liberties. This conftitution was evide ntiy founded in the  
expectation of the further progress and extraordmary degrees of  
Virtue: It enjoins the encourag&lt;ment of ail seminaries of litera-  
ture, which are the nurseries of virtue depending upon these for  
the support of government, rather than titles, sp:endor or force.  
Mr. Hume may call this a “ chimerical project ;” I am far  
from thinking the pe eople can be deceived, by urging upon thens  
2 dependance on the more general prevalence of knowledge and  
virtue. Itis one of the moti csscutia! means of further, and {till  
further improvements ‘n society ; and of corre&amp;t ng and amending

1 148] POLITICAL PRINCIPLES OF  
  
ish play-things, at the expense of real nobility, without one  
thought or care for the liberty and happiness of the rett of man-  
kind.  
  
“« The people who have no property, feel the power of gov-  
erning by a majority, and ever attack those who have property.”  
*“ The injured men of property recur to finesse, trick and itrata-  
gem to outwit them.” ‘True: these may proceed from  
a luit of domination in some of both parties. Be this as it may,  
it has been known that such deceittul tricks have been practised  
by some of the rich upon their unsuspecting fellow-citizens, to  
turn the determination of queftions so as to answer their own  
selfish purposes. To plunder,or filch the rights of men, are  
crimes equally immoral and nefarious, though committed in dif-  
ferent manners. Neither of them is confined to the rich or the  
poor ; they are&#x27;too common among both. ‘The Lords, as well  
as the Commons, of Great-Britain, by continued large majori-  
ties, endeavored by finesse, tricks and {tratagems, as well ae  
threats, to prevail on the American colonies to surrender their  
liberty and property to their disposal :—These failing, they ate  
tempted to plunder our rights by force of arms. We feared  
their arts more than their arms. Did the members of that he.  
reditary House of Lords, whoconftituted those repeated majoris  
ties, then posses the spirit of nobility Not so, I think. ‘hat  
spirit refided in the z//ustrious minorities in both Houses.  
  
But, “ by nobles,” who have prevented “one hideous despe-  
tism, as horrid as that of Turkey, from falling to the lot of every  
nation of Europe,” you mean, “not peculiarly an hereditary  
nobility, or any particular modification, but the natural and a@ual  
ariftocracy among mankind ;” the exittence of which Iam not  
disposed to deny. Where is this arittocracy found? Among  
men of all ranks and conditions. The cottager may beget a  
wise son ; the nob?e a fool. Theone is capable of great ime  
provement—the other not. Education is within the power of  
men, and societies of men: wise and judicious modes of edu-  
cation, patronized and supported by communities, will draw  
together the sons of the rich and the poor, among whom it makes  
ng diftindion ; it will cultivate the natural genius, elevate the  
soul, excite laudable emulation to excel in knowledge, piety and  
benevolence ; and finally, it will reward its patrons and bene-  
factors by shedding its benign influence on the public mind.  
Education inures men to thinking and refleétion, to reasoning  
and demonftration. It discovers to them the moral and relie  
gious duties they owe to God, their country, and to all mankind.  
Even savages might, by means of education, be inftructed to  
  
frame the heft civil and political inftitutions, with ag nauch skill

and ingenuity as they now shape their arrows. Education leads  
youth to “ the ftudy of human nature, society and universal his-  
  
| tory,” from whence they may “ draw all the principles” of polit.  
  
ical architecture which ought to be regarded. All men are  
 interefted in the truth :” education by shewing them “ the end  
of all its consequences,”’ would induce at leaft the greateft num-  
bers to enlitt onits tides ‘Lhe man of good underitanding, who  
has been well educated, and improves these advantages,  
as far as his circumittances will allow, in promoting the happi-  
ness of mankind, in my opinion, and I am inclined to think ia  
yours, is indeed ‘* well born.”  
  
It may be “ peurile and unworthy of ftatesmen” to declaim.  
againtt family pride ; but there is, and always has been, such a  
ridiculous kind of vanity among men. “ Statesmen know the  
evil and danger is too serious to be sported with.” I am con-.  
tent they should be put into one hole, as you propose; but J.  
have some tears that your watchmen on each fide will not well  
agree. Whena man canrecolledt the virtues of his anceftors,  
he certainly has abundantly more solid satistaétion, than another.  
who boaitts that he sprang from those who were rich or noble, but.  
never discovers the leaft degree of virtue ortrue worth of any.  
kind. ‘¢ Family popularity,” if I miftake not, has its source in.  
family pride. It 1s by all means, sought after, that homage may,  
be paid to the name of the title or eftate, to supply the want, in  
the possessor, of any great or good quality whatsoever. There.  
are individuals among men, who ftudy the art of making theme.  
selves popular, for the purpose of getting into places of honor  
and emoluments, and, by these means, of gratifying hereafter,.  
the noble paflion, ‘family pride.” Others are so inchanted.  
with the mufic of the sound, that they conceive it to be supreme  
felicity.—This is, indeed, vanity of vanities! and, if such de-  
luded men ever come to their senses, they will find it to be vexa-  
tion of spirit. Whgn they reflect on their own folly and injus-  
tice, in having swallowed the breath of applause, with avidity  
and great de!ight, for merit which they are conscious they never  
had ; and that many, who have been the loudett in sounding their.  
praises, had nothing in view but their own private and selfish in-  
terefts, it will excite in them the feelings of shame, remorse  
and self contempt. The truly virtuous man, and real patriot, is  
satisfied with the approbation of the wise and discerning: he  
rejoices in the contemplation of the purity of his own inten~  
  
tions, and waits, in humble hope, for the plaudit of his final  
Judge.

&quot;Education is within the power of men, and soci­  
eties of men; wise and judicious modes of educdation  
patronized and supported by communities, will draw  
logether the sons of the rich and the poor, among  
whom it makes no distinction; it will cultivate the  
natural genius, elevate the soul, excite landable  
emulation to excel in knowledge, piety, and beneve  
vience; and finally it will reward its patrons and  
benefactors by shedding its benign influonce on the  
public mind. Education inures men to thinking  
and reflection, to reasoning and demonstration. It  
discovers to them the moral and religious duties  
they owe to God, their country, and to all mankind.  
Even savages might, by the means of education, be  
instructed to frame the best civil and political in  
stitutions with as much skill and ingenuity as they  
shape their arrows. Education leads youth to  
history, from whelse prluzsasgicly and universal

garded. All men are &quot;interested in the truth; edu­  
cation, by showing them the end of all its conse.

** Education is within the power of men and societies of men;  
wise and jadicious modes of education, patronized and sup-  
ported by communities, will draw together the sons of the rich  
and the poor, among whom it makes no distinction ; it will  
cultivate the natural genius, elevate the soul, excite laudable  
emulation to excel in knowledge, piety, and benevolence; and  
finally, it will reward its patrons and benefactors by shedding  
its benign inflaence on the public mind. Education inures  
men to thinking and reflection, to reasoning and demonstra-  
tion. It discovers to them the moral and religious duties they  
owe to God, their country, and to all mankind. Even savages  
might, by the means of education, be instructed to frame the  
best civil and political institutions with as much skill and in-  
genuity as they now shape their arrows, Education leads youth  
to ‘the stady of human nature, society, and universal history,’  
from whence they may ‘draw all the principles’ of political  
architecture which ought to be regarded. All men are ‘inter-  
ested in the truth;’ education, by showing them ‘the end of  
all its consequences,’ would induce at least the greatest num-  
bers to enlist on its side. The man of good understanding,  
who has been well educated, and improves these advantages  
as far as his circumstances will allow, in promoting the happi-  
ness of mankind, in my opinion,—and I am inclined to think in  
yours,—is indeed ‘ well born.’  
  
“* We agree in the utility of universal education; but ‘ will  
nations agree in it as fully and extensively as we do? ? Why  
should they not? It would not be fair to conclude that, be-  
cause they have not yet been disposed to agree in it, they never  
will. Itis allowed that the present sge is more enlightened  
than former ones. Freedom of inquiry is certainly more en-  
couraged ; the feelings of humanity have softened the heart;  
the true principles of civil and religious liberty are better  
  
understood; tyranny, in all its shapes, is more detested; and  
bigotry, if not still blind, must be mortified to see that she is  
  
despised. Such an age may afford at least a flattering expecta-  
  
tion that nations as well as individuals will view the utility  
of universal education in so strong a light as to induce sufficient  
  
national patronage and support.”
