Sir  
Monticello July 12. 16.  
  
I duly recieved your favor of June 13. with a copy of the letters on the calling a Convention, on which you are pleased to ask my opinion. I have not been in the habit of mysterious reserve on any subject, nor of buttoning up my opinions within my own doublet. on the contrary, while in public service especially, I have thought the public entitled to frankness, and intimately to know whom they employed. but I am now retired: I resign myself, as a passenger, with confidence to those at the present helm, and ask but for rest, peace and good will. the question you propose, on equal representation, has become a party one, in which I wish to take no public share. yet, if it be asked for your own satisfaction only, and not to be quoted before the public, I have no motive to withold it, &amp; the less from you, as it coincides with your own. at the birth of our republic, I committed that opinion to the world, in the draught of a Constitution annexed to the Notes on Virginia, in which a provision was inserted for a representation permanently equal. the infancy of the subject at that moment, and our inexperience of self-government occasioned gross departures, in that draught, from genuine republican canons. in truth, the abuses of monarchy had so much filled all the space of political contemplation that we imagined every thing republican which was not monarchy. we had not yet penetrated to the mother-principle that ‘governments are republican only in proportion as they embody the will of their people, and execute it.’ hence, our first constitutions had really no leading principle in them. but experience &amp; reflection have but more &amp; more confirmed me in the particular importance of the equal representation then proposed. on that point then I am entirely in sentiment with your letters; and only lament that a Copy-right of your pamphlet prevents their appearance in the newspapers, where alone they would be generally read, and produce general effect. the present vacancy too of other matter would give them place in every paper, and bring the question home to every man’s conscience.  
But, inequality of representation, in both houses of our legislature is not the only republican heresy in this first essay of our revolutionary patriots at forming a constitution. for let it be agreed that a government is republican in proportion as every member composing it has his equal voice in the direction of it’s concerns, (not indeed in person, which would be impracticable beyond the limits of a city, or small township, but) by representatives chosen by himself, &amp; responsible to him at short periods, and let us bring to the test of this Canon every branch of our constitution.  
In the legislature, the House of Representatives is chosen by less than half the people, and not at all in proportion to those who do chuse. the Senate an are still more disproportionate, and for long terms of irresponsibility.—In the Executive, the Governor is entirely independant of the choice of the people, &amp; of their controul; his Council equally so, and at best but a fifth wheel to a waggon.—In the Judiciary, the judges of the highest courts are dependant on none but themselves. in England, where judges were named, &amp; removable at the will of an hereditary Executive, from which branch most misrule was feared, and has flowed, it was a great point gained, by fixing them for life, to make them independant of that Executive. but in a government founded on the public will this principle operates in a contrary an opposite direction, &amp; against that will. there too they were still removable on a concurrence of the Executive and legislative branches. but we have made them independant of the nation itself. they are irremovable but by their own body for any depravities of conduct, and even by their own body for the imbecilities of dotage.—the justices of the inferior courts are self-chosen, are for life, and perpetuate their own body in succession forever, so that a faction once possessing itself of the bench of a county can never be broken up, but hold their county in chains, forever indissoluble. yet these justices are the real Executive, as well as judiciary in all our minor and most ordinary concerns. they tax us at will; fill the office of sheriff, the most important of all the executive officers of the county, name nearly all our military leaders, which leaders, once named, are removable but by themselves.—The Juries, our judges of all fact, and of law when they chuse it, are not selected by the people, nor amenable to them. they are chosen by an officer named by the Court and Executive. chosen, did I say? picked up by the Sheriff from the loungings of the court yard, after every thing respectable has retired from it.—where then is our republicanism to be found? not in our constitution certainly, but merely in the spirit of our people. that would oblige even a despot to govern us republicanly. owing to this spirit, and to nothing in the form of our constitution, all things have gone well. but this fact, so triumphantly misquoted by the enemies of reformation, is not the fruit of our constitution, but has prevailed in spite of it. our functionaries have done well, because generally honest men. if any were not so, they feared to shew it.  
But it will be said it is easier to find faults than to amend them. I do not think their amendment so difficult as is pretended. only lay down true principles, and adhere to them inflexibly. do not be frightened into their surrender by the alarms of the timid, or the croakings of wealth against the ascendancy of the people. if experience be called for, appeal to that of our 15. or 20. governments for 40. years, and shew me where the people have done half the mischief in these 40. years, that a single despot would have done in a single year; or shew half the riots and rebellions, the crimes &amp; the punishments which have taken place in any single nation, under kingly government, during the same period. the true principle foundation of republicanism government is the equal right of every citizen in his person, &amp; property, &amp; in their management.  try by this, as a tally, every provision of our constitution, and see if it hangs directly on the will of the people. reduce your legislature to a convenient number for full, but orderly discussion. let every man who fights or pays exercise his just and equal right in their election. submit them to approbation or rejection at short intervals.—let the Executive be chosen in the same way, &amp; for the same term, by those whose agent he is to be; and leave no screen of a council, behind which to skulk from responsibility.—it has been thought that the people are not competent electors of judges learned in the law. but I do not know that this is true, and, if doubtful, we should follow principle. in this, as in many other elections, they would be guided by reputation, which would not err as oftener perhaps than the present mode of appointment. in one state of the Union at least it has been long tried and with the most satisfactory success. the judges of Connecticut have been chosen by the people every 6 months for nearly two centuries, and I believe there has hardly ever been an instance of change; so powerful is the curb of incessant responsibility. if prejudice however, derived from a monarchical institution, is still to prevail against the vital elective principle of our own, and if the existing example among ourselves of periodical election of judges by the people be still mistrusted, let us at least not adopt the evil &amp; reject the good of the English precedent; let us retain amovability on the concurrence of the Executive and legislative branches, and nomination by the Executive alone. nomination to office is an executive function. to give it to the legislature, as we do, is a violation of the principle of the separation of powers. it swerves the members from correctness by temptations to intrigue for office themselves, &amp; to a corrupt barter of votes; and destroys responsibility by dividing it among a multitude. by leaving nomination in it’s proper place among executive functions the principle of the distribution of power is preserved, and responsibility weighs with it’s heaviest force on a single head.   The organisation of our county administrations may be thought more difficult. but follow principle, &amp; the knot unties itself. divide the counties into Wards of such size as that every citizen can attend when called on, and act in person. ascribe to them the government of their wards in all things relating to themselves alone exclusively. a justice chosen by themselves, in each, a constable a military company, a patrole, a school, the care of their own poor, their own portion of the public roads, the choice of one or more jurors to serve in some court, &amp; the delivery, within their own wards, of their own votes for all elective officers of higher sphere will relieve the county administration of nearly all it’s business, will have it better done, and by making every citizen an acting member of the government, &amp; in the offices nearest &amp; most interesting to him, will attach him by his strongest feelings to the independance of his country, and it’s republican constitution.   The justices thus chosen by every ward, would constitute the county court, would do it’s judiciary business, direct roads and bridges, levy county and poor-rates, and administer all the matters of common interest to the whole county. these Wards, called townships, in New England, are the vital principle of their governments, and have proved themselves the wisest invention ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government, and for it’s preservation.   We should thus marshal our government into 1. the General federal republic, for all concerns foreign &amp; federal; 2. that of the State for what relates to our own citizens exclusively. 3. the County republics for the duties &amp; concerns of the county, and 4. the Ward-republics, for the small, and yet numerous &amp; interesting concerns of the neighborhood: and in government, as well as in every other business of life, it is by division and subdivision of duties alone, that all matters, great &amp; small, can be managed to perfection. and the whole is cemented by giving to every citizen personally a part in the administration of the public affairs.  
The sum of these amendments is 1. general suffrage. 2. equal representation in the legislature. 3. an Executive chosen by the people. 4. judges elective or amovable. 5. justices jurors, and sheriffs elective. 6. Ward-divisions. &amp; 7. periodical amendment of the Constitution.  
I have thrown out these, as loose heads of amendment, for consideration &amp; correction: and their object is to secure self-government by the republicanism of our constitution, as well as by the spirit of the people; and it is to nourish and perpetuate that spirit. I am not among those who fear the people. they and not the rich, are our dependance for continued freedom. and, to preserve their independance, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. we must make our election between economy &amp; liberty, or profusion and servitude. if we run into such debts as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink, in our necessaries &amp; our comforts, in our labors &amp; our amusements, for our callings and our creeds, as the people of England are, our people, like them, must come to labor 16. hours in the 24. give the earnings of 15. of these to the government for their debts and daily expences; and the 16th being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live, as they now do, on oatmeal &amp; potatoes; have no time to think, no means of calling the mismanagers to account; but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our  fellow sufferers. our land holders too, like theirs, retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must wander, like theirs, in foreign countries, and be contented with penury, obscurity, exile, and the glory of the nation. this example reads to us the salutary lesson that private fortunes are destroyed by public, as well as by private extravagance. and this is the tendency of all human governments. a departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for a 2d that 2d for a 3d and so on, till the  bulk of the bulk of the society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering. then begins indeed the bellum omnium in omnia, which some philosophers observing to be so general in this world, have mistaken it for the natural, instead of the abusive, state of man. and the forehorse of this frightful team is Public debt. taxation follows that, and in it’s train wretchedness and oppression.  
Some men look at Constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, &amp; deem them, like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched. they ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment. I knew that age well: I belonged to it, and labored with it. it deserved well of it’s country. it was very like the present, but without the experience of the present: and 40. years of experience in government is worth a century of book-reading: and this they would say themselves, were they to rise from the dead. I am certainly not an advocate for frequent &amp; untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because when once known, we accomodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. but I know also that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. as that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilised society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors. it is this preposterous idea which has lately deluged Europe in blood. their monarchs, instead of wisely yielding to the gradual changes of circumstances, of favoring progressive accomodation to progressive improvement, have clung to old abuses, intrenched themselves behind steady habits, and obliged their subjects to seek, thro’ blood &amp; violence, rash &amp; ruinous innovations, which, had they been referred to the peaceful deliberations, &amp; collected wisdom of the nation, would have been put into acceptable and salutary forms. let us follow no such examples, nor weakly believe that one generation is not as capable as another of taking care of itself, and of ordering it’s own affairs. let us, as our sister-states have done, avail ourselves of our reason and experience to correct the crude essays of our first and unexperienced, altho’ wise, virtuous, &amp; well meaning councils. And lastly, let us provide in our constitution for it’s revision at stated periods. what these periods should be Nature herself indicates. by the European tables of mortality, of the Adults living at any one moment of time, a majority will be dead in about 19. years. at the end of that period then a new majority is come into place; or in other words a new generation. each generation is as independant of the one preceding, as that was of all which had gone before. it has then, like them, a right to chuse for itself the form of government it believes most promotive of it’s own happiness: consequently to accomodate to the circumstances in which it finds itself that recieved from it’s predecessors; and it is for the peace and good of mankind that a solemn opportunity of doing this every 19. or 20. years should be provided by the constitution; so that it may be handed on, with periodical repairs, from generation to generation to the end of time, if any thing human can so long endure.   it is now 40. years since the constitution of Virginia was formed. the same tables inform us that, within that period, two thirds of the Adults then living are now dead. have then the remaining third, even if they had the wish, the right to hold in obedience to their will, and to laws heretofore made by them, the other two thirds who, with themselves compose the present mass of Adults? if they have not, who has? the dead? but the dead have no rights. they are nothing; and nothing cannot own something. where there is no substance, there can be no accident. this corporeal globe, and every thing upon it, belongs to it’s present corporeal inhabitants, during their generation. they alone have a right to direct what is the concern of themselves alone, and to declare the law of that direction: and this declaration can only be made by their majority. that majority then has a right to depute representatives to a Convention, and to make the Constitution what they think will be best for themselves.   but how collect their voice? this is the real difficulty. if invited by private authority to County or district meetings, these divisions are so large that few will attend, and their voice will be imperfectly, or falsely pronounced. here then would be one of the advantages of the Ward-divisions I have proposed. the Mayor of every Ward, on a question like the present, would call his ward together, take the simple Yea or Nay of it’s members, convey these to the County court, who would hand on those of all it’s wards to the proper general authority, and the voice of the whole people would be thus fairly, fully, &amp; peaceably expressed, discussed &amp; decided by the common reason of the society. if this avenue be shut to the call of sufferance it will make itself heard thro’ that of force, and we shall go on, as other nations are doing, in the endless circle of oppression, rebellion, reformation; &amp; oppression, rebellion, reformation again, and so on forever.  
These, Sir, are my  opinions of the governments we see among men, &amp; of the principles by which alone we may prevent our own from falling into the same dreadful track. I have given them at greater length than your letter called for. but I cannot say things by halves; and I confide them to your honor, so to use them as to preserve me from the gridiron of the public papers. if you should approve &amp; enforce them, as you have done that of equal representation, they may do some good. if not, keep them to yourself as the effusions of withered age and useless time. I shall, with not the less truth, assure you of my great respect and consideration.

“Monticello, July 12,1816.  
.“Sir—1 duly received your favor of  
Junel3,with a copy of the letters on the  
calling a Convention, on which you are  
pleased to ask my opinion. I have not  
been in the habit of mysterious reserve  
on any subject, nor of buttoning up my  
opinions within my own doublet: on the.  
contrary, while in public service espe­  
cially, I have thought the public enti­  
tled to frankness, and intimately to  
&#x27;.know whom they employed—but I am  
now retired: I resign myself a passen­  
’ ger, with confidence to those at the  
present helm, and ask but for rest,peace  
and good will. The question you pro­  
pose on equal representation, has be­  
come a party one, in which l wish to  
take no public share, yet if it be asked  
for your own satisfaction only, and not  
to be quoted before the public, I have  
no motive to withhold it, and the less  
• from you, as it coincides with your  
own. At the birth of our- republic, I  
committed that opinion to the world in  
1 the draught of a Constitution annexed  
U the Notes on Virginia, in which a  
provision was inserted fora representa­  
tion permanently equal. The infancy  
of the subject at that moment, and our  
^ inexperience of self government occa­  
* stoned gross departures,in thatdraught,  
f from genuine republican canons. In  
I&#x27; truth, the abuse of monarchy had so  
■ much filled all the space of political  
, contemplation that we imagined every  
f thiii? rrtmhlican which was not mou­  
thing republican which was not mon­  
archy; we had not yet penetrated to  
the mother priuciplethatgovernments  
nre republican only in &#x27;proportion as  
they embody the will of their people,  
:.nd execute it.—Hence, our first con­  
stitutions had really no leading prin  
tiple in them , but experience and re­  
flection have but more ami more con­  
rmed me in the particular importance  
t the equal representation then pro f  
ased- On that point I am entire- j  
• sentiment with your letters; andl  
/ lament that a copy right of ydui j  
  
pamphlet prevents their appearance  
in the newspapers, where alone they  
would be generally read, .and produce  
a general effect.. The present vacan­  
cy too of other matter would give  
them place in every paper, and bring  
the question home to every man’s con­  
science.  
But inequality of representation, in  
both houses of our legislature, is not the  
only republican heresy in this first essay  
of our revolutionary patriots at forming a  
constitution, for let it be agreed that a  
government is republican in proportion  
as eveiy member composing it has his e­  
qual voice in the direction of its concerns,  
(not indeed.in person, which would be  
impracticable beyond the limits of a city,  
or small township, but) by representa­  
tives chosen by himself, and responsible  
to him at short periods, and let us bring  
to the test of this eanon eveiy branch of  
our constitution.  
  
In the legislature, the House of Repre­  
sentatives is chosen by less than half the  
people, and not at all in proportion to  
to those who do choose. The Senate  
are still more disproportionate, and for  
long terms of irresponsibility. In the  
Executive, the Governor is entirely in­  
dependent of the choice of the people,  
and of their control; his Council equally  
so, and at best but: a fifth wheel to a wag­  
gon. In the Judiciary, the judges of the  
highest courts are dependant on none  
but themselves., In England,where judg­  
es were named and removably at the will  
of an hereditary Executive, from which  
branch, most misrule was feared, and has  
flowed, it was a great point gained, by  
fixing them for life, to makettieih inde­  
pendent of that Executive. But in a go­  
wrmnent founded on the puBIic will,  
the principle operates in an opposite dir  
rection, and against that will. There  
to%they were (till removable on a. con­  
currence of the Executive and legisla­  
tive branches; but we have made them in­  
dependent of the nation itself: they are  
irremovable but by their own body for a­  
ny depravities of conduct, and even by  
tneir own- body for the imbecilities of  
dotage. The justices of the: inferior  
courts are self-chosen, are fo# life, and  
perpetuate their own body in succession1  
forever; so that a faction once possessing  
itself of the bench ofs county, can never  
be broken up, but hold their country in  
chains for ever indissoluble. -Yet these  
justices are the real executive, as well as  
judicisiy in all our minor and most ordi­  
nary concerns;—they tax us at will: fill  
the office of Sheriff, the most important  
■ofa 11 the executive officers of the county, -  
name nearly all our military leaders, which  
leader^ once named, are removable but  
by themselves. The Juries, our judges  
of all fact, and of law when they choose  
it,are not selected by the people, noramen­  
able to them; they are chosen by an of­  
ficer named by the court and executive.  
Chosen, did I say? picked up by theShe­  
riff from the loungings of the court yard,  
after .every thing respectable has retired  
from it—where then is our republicanism  
to be found? Not in our constitution  
certainly, but merely in the spirit of our  
people, that would oblige even a despot  
to govern usrepublicanly ; owing to this  
spirit, and to nothing in the form of our  
constitution,all things have&#x27;gone well.—  
But this fact, so triumphantly misquoted  
by the enemies of reformation, is; not  
the fruit of our constitution, but has pre­  
vailed in spite of it; our functionaries  
have doiie well, because generally honest  
men; if any were not so, they feared to  
show it. f  
But it will be said it is easier to find  
faults than to amend them. I do not  
chink their amendment so difficult  
as is pretended; only lay down true  
principles,,and adhere to them inflexi­  
bly. Do not be frightened into their  
surrender by the alarms of the timid,  
or the croakings of wealth against the  
ascendancy of the people. It experi­  
ence be called for, appeal to that of our  
15 o: 20 governments 40 years, and  
shew me where the people have done  
half the mischief in these forty years,  
that a single despot would have done  
in a single year; or sjiew here half the  
riots and rebellionsithe crimes and the  
punishments which have taken place  
in any single nation, under kingly go­  
vernment, during the same period. The  
true foundation of republican govern­  
ment, is the equal right of every citiaen  
jn hispei&#x27;son.andproperty, and in their  
management. Try by this as a talley,  
every provision of our constitution, and  
see it it hangs directly on the will of the  
people; reduce your legislature to a  
convenient number for full, but order­  
ly discussion; let every man who fights  
or pays, exercise his just and equal  
right in their election; submit them to  
approbation or rejection at short inter­  
vals—let the executive be chosen in  
che same way, and for the same term,  
by those whose agent he is to be; and  
leave no screen of a council behind  
which to skulk from responsibility.—It  
has been thought that the people are  
lot competent electors of Judges team­  
’d in the law, but I do not know that  
his is true; and if doubtful, we should  
Follow principle: in this, as in many o­  
  
ther elections, they would be guided by  
reputation, which would not err often­  
er perhaps than the present mode of  
appointment|: in one state of the Union  
at least it has been long tried and with  
the most satisfactory success,—The  
judges of Connecticut have been Cho­  
sen by the people every sixth months  
for nearly two centuries, and 1 believe  
there has hardly ever been an instance  
of change; so powerful is the curb of  
incessant responsibility. If prejudice  
however, derived from a monarchical  
institution, is still to prevail igainsf the  
vital elective principle of our own, and  
if the existing example among our­  
selves of periodical election of judges  
by the people lie still mistrusted, let us  
at least not adopt the evil and reject the  
good of the English* precedent; let us  
retain amovability on the concurrence  
of the executive and legislative bran­  
ches, and nomination by the executive  
alone: nomination to office is an execu­  
tive function; to give it to the legislar­  
turefi as we do, is a violation of the prin­  
ciple of the separation of powers, it  
swerves the members fromcor? ectness  
by temptation to intrigue | for&#x27; office  
themselves, ahd to.a corrupt barter of  
of votes; and destroys responsibility by  
dividing it among a multitude. By  
leaving nomination its proper place a­  
mong executive functions, the principle  
of the distribution of power is preser­  
ved, and responsibility weighs with its&#x27;  
heaviest force on a single &quot;head. The  
organization ofour country administra­  
tions may be thought more difficult, but  
follow principle, and the knot unties it­  
self: divide the counties into wards of  
such size as that every citizen can at­  
tend when called on, and act in person;  
ascribe to them the government of their  
wards in all things relating to them­  
selves exclusively? a justice chosen by  
their selves in each, a constable, a mili.  
&#x27;■S .  
  
ary company, a patrole, ft school, the  
:are of their own poor, of the public  
roads, the choice of one or more jurors  
to serve in some court, and the delive­  
ry, within their own wards of their own  
votes for all elective officers of higher  
sphere, will relieve the county admin-J  
istration of nearly all its business, will  
have it better done, and by making e­  
very citizen an acting member of the  
government, and in the offices nearest  
and most interesting to him, will at­  
tach him by his strongest feelings to the  
independence of his country, and ifsVe­  
publican constitution. The justices  
thus chosen by-every ward, would con­  
stitute the county court, would do its  
judiciary business, direct roads and  
bridges, levy county and poor rates^uid  
administer all the matters of common  
interest to the whole county: these  
wards, called townships, In New-En­  
gland, are the vital principle of their  
&#x27;governments, and have proved them­  
selves the wisest invention ever devis­  
ed by the wit of man for the perfect ex­  
ercise of self-government and for its  
preservation. We should thus mar­  
ahall our government into—X. The  
General Federal Republic, for all con­  
cerns foreign and federal—3. That, of  
the State, for what relates to our own  
citizens, exclusively—3. The county  
republics, for -the duties and concerns  
of the county,—and 4. The Ward Re­  
publics, for the small, and yet nume­  
rous and interesting concerns-of. the  
neighborhood; and in government, as  
well as in every other business of life,  
it is by division and subdivision of du­  
ties alone, that all matters, great and  
Small, can be managed to perfection,  
and the whole is Cemented by giving to  
hvery citizen personally a .part in the&#x27;  
administration of the public affairs.  
  
- i ne sum oi tnese amendments— i.  
general suffrage—2. equal representa­  
tion in the legislature—3. an executive  
chosen by the people—4 judges elec­  
tive or airtovalile—5. justices, jurors  
and sheriffs elective—(j. ward divisions,  
and 7. periodical amendments of the  
Constitution. I have thrown out these,  
as loose heads of amendment, for con­  
sideration and correction: and their  
object is to secure self government by  
the republicanism of our constitution,  
as well as by the spirit of the people;  
and .it to to nourish and perpetuate that  
spirit. Iam pot among those who fear  
the people. They, and not the rich,  
are our dependence for continued free­  
dotn-^md4o preserve theirindejiendeqce  
we must not let rulers load us with  
perpetual debt; we must make our  
elecrion between economy and liberty  
or firofmion and servitude—If we run  
into such debts as that we must be tax­  
ed in our meat and inourdrink, in our  
necessaries and our comforts, in our la­  
bors and our amusements, lor oar call­  
ings and our creeds, a i the people of  
England are, our people, like them,  
must come to labor 16 hours in the 24,  
give the earnings of 15 of these to the  
government for their debts and daily  
expencesjaud the 16th being insufficient  
to afford us bread, we must live as they  
noW&#x27; do, on oatmeal and potatoes; have  
no time to think, no means of calling  
the mismanagers to account, but be  
glad to obtain subsistence by hiring  
ourselves to rivet their chains on the  
necks of our fellow sufferers. Our land  
holders too, like theirs,retaining indeed  
the title and stewardship of estates call­  
ed theirs,but held really in trust for the  
treasury, must wander, like theirs, in  
foreign.countries, and be contented with  
penury, obscurity, exile, and the glory  
of the nation. This example reads to  
as the salutary lesson that private for­  
tunes are. destroyed by public, as well  
as by private extravagance. And this  
is the tendency of all human govern­  
ments. A departure from principle in  
one instance becomes a precedent for  
a 2d, that 2d for a 3d, and so on till the  
bulk otthe society is reduced to be mere  
automatons of misery, to have no sensi­  
bilities left but for sinning and suffering.  
Then begins indeed the bellum omni­  
um in omnia, wHich some philosophers  
observing to be so general in this world,  
have mistaken it for the natural, in­  
stead of the abusive, state of man; and  
the forehorse o|,this frightful team is  
Public Debt—Taxation follows that,  
and its train wretchedness and oppres  
sion.  
  
oonic men mot at constitutions with  
sanctimonious reverence, and deem  
them like the ark of the covenant, too  
sacred to be touched. They ascribe to  
the men of the peceding age a wisdom  
more than human, and suppose what  
they did to be beyond amendment. I  
knew that age well: I belonged to it;  
and labored with it; it deserved well of  
its country; it was very like the pre­  
s.nt, but without the experience of the  
present: and 40 years of experience in  
government is worth a century of book  
reading; and this they would say them­  
selves, were they to nse from the dead.  
1 am certainly not an advocate for fre­  
quent and untried changes in laws and  
&#x27;constitutions. 1 think moderate imper­  
fections had better be borne with; be­  
muse, when once known, we accom­  
modate ourselves to them and find  
practical means of correcting their ill  
sffects; but I know also that laws and  
  
institutions must go nami in hand with  
the progress of the human mind; as that  
becomes more developed,more enligh­  
tened, as new discoveries are made,  
new truths disclosed, and manners and  
opinions change with the change of cir­  
cumstances, institutions must advance  
also, and keep pace with the times,—  
We might as well require a man to  
wear still the coat which fitted him  
when a boy, as civilized society to re­  
main ever under the regimen of their  
barbarous ancestors; it is this prepos­  
terous ic)ea which has lately deluged  
Europe in blood—&#x27;their raonarchs, in­  
stead«F wisely yielding to the gradual  
change of circumstances, of farming  
progressive improvement, have clung!  
to old abuses; intrenched themselves  
behind steady habits, and obliging their  
subjects to seek, through blood and vio­  
lence .rash and ruinous innovations,which  
had they been referred to the peaceful  
deliberations and collected wisdom of  
the nation,would have been put into ac­  
ceptable and salutary forms. Let us  
follow no such examples, nor weakly  
believe that one generation is not as  
capable as another of taking care of  
itself, and of ordering its own affairs.  
Let us, as our sister states have done,  
avail ourselves of our reason and expe­  
rience to correct the crude essays of  
our first and unexperienced, although  
wise, virtuous, and well meanirg coun­  
cils. And lastly let us provide in our  
constitution for its revision at stated  
periods. What these periods should  
lie, nature herself indicates. By the  
European tahlesof mortality, of. the a­  
duSts living at any one moment of time,  
a majority will be dead in about 19  
years; and at the end of that period then  
a new majority is come into place; or  
in other words n new generation is as  
v • - -  
  
independent of the one preceding, as  
that was of all which had gone before;  
it has then, like then!, a right to choose  
for itself the form of government it be­  
lieves most promotive of- its own hap  
piness; consequently to accommodate  
to the circumstances in which it finds  
itself that received from its predeces­  
sors; and it is for the peace and good of  
mankind that a solemn opportunity of  
doing this every 19 or 20 years should  
be provided by the constitution, so that  
it may be handed on, with periodical  
repairs, from generation to generation  
to the end of time, if any thing human  
can so long endure.—-It is now 40 years  
since the Constitution of Virginia was  
formed. The same ftables inform us  
that, within that period, two-thirds of  
die adults then living are now dead—  
Have then the remaining third, even if  
they had-the wish, the right to hold in  
obedience to their will.and to laws here­  
tofore made by them, the other two  
thirds who with themselves compose  
the present mass of adults? The dead?  
But the dead have no rights, they are  
nothing, and nothing cannot own some­  
thing. Where there is no substance,  
there can be no accident. This corpo­  
real globe, and every thing upon it, be­  
longs to its present corporeal inhabi­  
tants, during their generation. They  
alone have a right to direct what is the  
concernof themselves alone, and to de­  
clare the law of that direction: and  
this declaration can only he made by  
their majority. That majority then  
has a right to depute representatives  
  
to a Convention, and to make the Con­  
stitution what they think will be best  
for themselves. • But how colleot their  
voice? this is the real difficulty. If in­  
vited by private authority to county or  
district meetings, these divisions are so  
large that few will attend, and their  
voice will be imperfectly or falsely pro­  
nounced. Here then would be oije of  
the advantages of the ward-divisions I  
have proposed. The mayor of every  
ward, on a question like the present,  
would call his ward together, take the  
simple Yea&#x27;or Nay of its members,con­  
vey these to the county court, who  
would hand on those of all its wards to  
the proper general authority, and the  
voice of the.whole people would be  
thus fairly, fully and peaceably expres­  
sed, discussed and decided by the com­  
mon reason of the society. If this a-3  
venue be shut to the call of sufferance,  
it will make itself heard through that  
of force, and we shall go on, as other  
nations are doing, in the endless circle  
of oppression, rebellion, reformation;  
and oppression, rebellion, reformation a­  
gain, and so on forever.  
These, Sir, are my opinions of the go­  
vernments we see among men,{and of the  
principlee by- which alone we may pre­  
vent our own from falling into the same  
dreadful track. I hare given them at  
greater length than your letter called for,  
but T cannot say things by halves; and I  
confide them to your honor, so to use  
them as to preserve me from the gridi­  
ron of the public papers. If you should  
! approve and enforce them, as you have  
done that of equal representation, they  
may do some good; if not, keep them to  
yourself as the effusions of withered age  
and useless time.  
I shall, with not less truth, assure you  
of my great respect and consideration.

Monticei.lo, July 12, ItflO.  
SIR -I duly received jour favor of June 13  
with a copy of tbe letters on the calling a Con­  
vention, on which you are pleased to a-k my  
&#x27;opinion. I have not been in the habit of mysteri­  
ous reserve on any subject, nor ol buttoning up my  
&quot;opinions within my own doublet;on the contrary,  
while in public service especially, I have tb,•light  
the public entitled to frankness, and intimately to  
know whem they employed—hut I am now re­  
tired: 1 rc*ign myself as a passenger, with confi­  
dence to those at the present helm, an I ask but for  
re-t, peace and good will. The question you pro­  
pose on equal representation, has become s party  
one, in which I wish to take no public share, yet,  
if it be asked for your own satisfaction only, and  
not to be quote! before the public, I have no mo­  
tive to withhold it, and the lees from you, ss it  
coincides with your own. At the birth of our re­  
public, 1 committed that opinion to the world in  
tire draught of a Constitution annexed to the Notes  
on Virginia, i:i which a provision was insetted fora  
representation permanently equal. The iufanry of  
the subject at that moment, and our inexperience ■  
vl self-government occasioned gross departures, in i  
that draught, from genuine republican canons. Ini  
truth, the abuses of monarchy had so much filled  
oil the -pace of political contemplation thst we  
imagined every thing republican which w*« not  
monarchy; tve had not yet penetrated to the motlier­  
principle that governments are republican only in  
proportion as they embody the w ill of their people,  
and execute it. Hence, our first constitutions had |  
redly no leading principle in them, but experience;  
and reflection Inve but rcfoie and more coidimed  
me in the particular importance of &quot;be 6qti J re­  
presen’ttion then proposed- On that point then, I  
nm entirely in sentiment with your letters;ami only  
iameni that a copy-right of your pamphlet prevents  
their appcaiance in the newspapers, where alone I  
they would be generally read, and produce general  
effect. The pie*cni vacancy loo, of other matter,  
i*/fluid give them place in every paper and bring the  
&lt;; lestion home to every aim&#x27;s conscience.  
But, inequality of representation, m both house* I  
of our legislator is not the only republican iieir-y  
»r» this first essay of our revolutionary patiiuts at  
forming ■ constitution, for let it lie agree! that a  
government is republican in proportion as every  
member composing it has his equal voice in tire  
direction of its concerns, (not indeed in person,  
-which would be impr &gt;cticablebey«indihe Jimtteof a  
ei.y, or small township, but) by represen&#x27;atives  
chosen by himself, and responsible to him at abort  
periods, and let uh bring to the test of (his canon  
every branch of our constitution.  
In the legislature, the House of Representa­  
tives is chosen by leas than half the people, and  
not et all In proportion to those who do choose.  
*1 Hs Sens!* are still more dtef»&lt;&gt;portionv.e, arc! for  
• t  
  
u.r.jr ij.xs ui itrM|«u#unii\r- in tnp Executive,  
the iitfvtmor ie entirely independent of the choice  
of the people, and of their control; hit Council  
equally to, and at bett but a fifth wheel to a  
wagon. In the Judiciary, the judge* of the high­  
est court# are dependant on none but themselves.  
In England where judges were named and remova­  
ble at the will of an hereditary Executive, from  
which branch most misrule was feared, and ha*  
flowed.it war a great point gained, by fixing them  
for life, to make them independent of that Exe­  
cutive. But in a government founded on the pub­  
lic will th’s principle operates in an 01 poaile direc­  
tion, and against that will. There too, they were  
■till removable on a concurrence of the Executive  
and legislative branches; but we have made them  
independant of the nation itself; they are irremova­  
ble but by their own body for any depravities of  
conduct, and e\ en by their own body for the im­  
becilities of dotage.—The justices of the inferior  
courts are self-chosen, are tor life, and perpetuate  
their own body in succession for ever, so that a  
faction ouce possessing itself of the bench of a  
county can never be broken up, but hold their  
county in chain# for ever indissoluble. Yet these  
justices are the teal executive, as well as judicia­  
ry in all our minor and most ordinary concerns;—  
they tax us at will, fiil the office of Sheriff, the  
most important of all the executive officers of the  
  
county; name nearly all our military leaders, winch  
leaders, once named, are removable but by them*  
selves. The Juries, our judges of all fact, and of  
law when they choose it, sre not selected by the  
people, nor amenable to them; they are chosen by  
an officer named by the court and executive.—  
Chosen, did I say? picked up by the Sheriff from the  
lounging* of the court yard, after every thing re­  
spectable has reliied from it—where then, is nur  
republicanism to be found? Not in our constitu­  
tution certainly, but merely in the spirit of our  
people, that would oblige eveu a despot to govern  
us rcpublicanly; owing to this spirit and to noth­  
ing in the form of our constitution, all things have  
gone well. But this fact, so triumphantly mis­  
quoted by the enemies of reformation, is not the  
fruit of our constitution, but has prevailed in spite  
of it; our functionaries have done well, because  
generally honest inen; if any were not bo, they  
teared to shew it.  
But it will be said, it is easier to find faults  
than to amend them. I do not think their amend­  
ment so difficult as is pretended; onlv lay down  
true principles, and adhere to them intlexibly. Do  
not be frightened into their surrender by the alarms  
vf the timid, or the croakings of wealth against  
the aacendancy of the people. If experience be  
called for, *p|&gt;eal to tliet of our IS or 20 govern  
iinente for 4&#x27;J years, and shew me where the peo­  
ple have done half the mischief in these forty  
years, that a single depot would have done in a  
,single year; or shew here half the riots and rebel­  
lions, the crimes and the punishments which have  
‘taken place in any single nation, under kingly go­  
vernment, during the same period. The true  
, touni’tt&#x27;on of republican government is the equal  
I right ot every citizen in his person, and pro­  
perly, aiul u» their raanagrroent. Try by this as  
’ a t*U*y, every provision of our constitution, and  
sec if it hangs directly on the will of the people;  
reduce your Legislature to a convenient number  
for full, but orderly discussion; let every man who  
tights o: pays, exercise his just and equal right in  
their election; submit them to approbation or re­  
jection at short intervals,—let the Executive be  
chosen in the same way,and for the same tern}, by  
those whose agent he is to be; and leave uo screen  
of a council behind which to skulk from responsi­  
bility— It has been thought that the people are  
oot competent electors of judges learned in the  
lato.iut I do not know that this is true; and if  
doubtful, we should follow principle; in ibis as in  
many other elections, they would be guided by re­  
putation, which would not err oftener perhaps, than  
the present mode of appointment; in one state of  
the Union at least it has been long tried and with  
the most satisfactory success_The judges of  
Connecticut have been chosen by the people eve­  
ry 6* months for nearly two centuries, and I be­  
lieve there has hardly ever been an instance of  
change; so pow erful is the curb of incessant res­  
ponsibility. If prejudice, however derived from a  
monarchical institution, is still to prevail ag.iiu*t the  
vital elective principle of our own, and if the  
existing example among ourselves of periodical e­  
l-etisn of judges by the people, be still mistrusted,  
let us at least not adopt the evil and reject the good  
of the English precedent; let us retain a niovability  
on the concurrence of the executive and legisla­  
tive branches, and nomination by the executive a­  
lone. Nomination to office is au executive function,  
to give it to the legislature, as we do, is; a vio­  
lation of the principle of the separation of powers;  
it swerves the members from correctness by temp­  
tation to intrigue for office themselves, and to a  
corrupt barter of votes; and destroys responsibility  
by dividing it among a mubitude. By leaving  
nomination in it’s proper place among executive  
functions, the principle of the distribution of pow­  
er is preserved and responsibility weighs with it’s  
lieaviest force on a single head. The orginiza­  
ti**n of our county administrations may be thought  
more difficult; but follow principle, and the knot  
unties ltrelf; divide the counties into wards of such  
size as that every citizen can attend when called on  
and act in person, ascribe to them the government  
of tneir wards in all things relating to themselves  
exclu ively, a justice chosen by themselves in  
each, a constable, a military company, a patrole,  
» school, the care of their own poor, their own  
portion ofthe public roads, the choice of one or  
more juror* to serve in some court, and the delivery  
within their own ward* of their own votes for  
all elective officers ot higher sphere, will relieve  
the county administration of ne.-.riy all it’s business,  
will have it better done, and by making every ci­  
tizen an acting member of the government, and in  
the office* nearest and most interesting to him,  
will attach him by his strongest feelings to the inJe­  
pendance of bis country, and it’s republican  
constitution. The justices thus chosen by every  
ward, would constitute the county court, would  
do it’s judiciary business, direct roads and bridge*,  
levy county and poor-rates, and administer all the  
matters of common interest to the whole county:  
these wards, called townships, in New England,  
are the vital principle of their governments, and’  
have proved themselves the wisest invention ever  
devised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise  
of self-government and for it’s preservation. We  
•hould thus marshal our government into—!. The  
General Federal Republic, for all concerns foreign  
and federal—2. That of the 8tate for wiiat relates  
to our own citizen* exclusively— &amp; The county  
republics for the duties and concerns of the county,  
- and 4. The Ward Republics, for the small, and  
yet numerous anj interesting concerns of tbe  
neighborhood: end in gorernruent, as well a* in e­  
ry other business of life, it i* by division and !  
subdivision of duties alone, that all matters, great I  
and email, can be managed to perltction, and the ■  
whole is cemented by giving to every citizen per-;  
sonally a purl in the administration ot the public ,  
affair*.  
  
* lie Hum oj Wiese amendments is— 1. general  
suffrage—2, equal representation in the legislature;  
3, an executive chosen by the people— 4, judges e- !  
lective or amovable— 5, justices, jurors and she-j  
ritTe elective— 6, waid divisions, and 7, periodical ;  
amendments of the constitution. ! have thrown!  
out these, as loose heads of amendment, for consi I  
deration and correction: and their object is to!  
secure self-government by the republicanism of our I  
constitution as * ell as by the spirit of the fwoplc;  
and it is to nourish and perpe&#x27;ua&#x27;e that spirit. I  
am not among tho-e wlm fear the people. They,  
and not the rii*h, are our dependanre for continued  
freedom; and, to preserve their independence we  
must noi let our ruler* Joad ns with perpetual debt;  
we must make our elecl on lietween economy and  
liberty, or profusion and servitude. If we run  
into such debts as that »ve must be taxed in our  
meat and in our drink, in our necessaries and our  
comforts, In our labors and our amusements, for  
our callings and our creeds, as the people of Eng­  
land are, our people, like them, must come to;  
labor Id hours in the 2i, give the earnings of 1£» 1  
of&#x27;these 13 the government fw their debts ar.d  
daily expenses; and the ltith,/ being insufficient to&#x27;  
nllord us bread, we trust li? e *-&gt; now do.  
  
&#x27;Oil oatxrxi ano p^a*oc«, nave no tune u&gt; think,|  
no mean* of calling the mi!&gt;m»nager» to account; I  
but be glad to obtaiu subsistence by hiring our- 1  
selves to rivet their chain*, on the neck* ofour  
few sufferer*. Out land-holdei* too, like their*,  
retaining indeed the title and stewardship of es­  
tates called thairs, but held really in tiuat for the  
treasury, n.u»l wander like thciis, iu foieign coun­  
tries, and be contented with penury, obscutity,  
exile, and the glory of the nation. This example  
rea&lt;*s to us the *.alutary lesson, that private fortune*  
are destroyed by public well as by private extrav­  
agance. And this is the tendency of all human go­  
vernment*. A departure from principle in one  
instance becomes a precedent for a 2d, that 2J.  
for a 3d, and so on till the bulk of the society i*  
reduned to be more automatons of ptaery, to have  
iio sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering.  
Then begins indeed, the bellum omnium in omnia,  
which some philosophers observing to be so gen­  
eral in this world, have mistaken it for the natural,  
instead of the abusive, state of man, and the fore­  
horse of this frightful team is Public Debt.—Tax­  
ation follows that, and in it’s train wretchedness  
and oppression.  
  
Some men look at uonslltunons wun sancti­  
monious reverence, and deem them like the ark  
of the covenant; too sacred to be touched —  
They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a  
wisdom more than human, and suppose what  
(hey did to be beyond amendment. I knew that  
age well : I belonged to it, and labored with it,  
it deserved well of it’s country, it was very like  
the present but without the experience of the  
present : and dO years of experience in govern­  
ment is worth a century of book-reading; and  
this they would say themselves, were they to  
rise from the dead. 1 am certainly not an ad­  
vocate for frequent and unlired changes in laws  
and constitutions. I think moderate imperfec­  
tions had better be borue with; because, when  
once known, we accommodate ourselves to them  
and find practical means of cotrccling their ill  
effects; but I know also that laws and institu­  
tions must gs hand in hand with tiie progress  
of the human mind, as that becomes more de­  
veloped, more enlightened, as new discoveries  
are made, new tiuths disclosed, and manners  
and opinions change with the change of circum­  
stances, institutions must advance also, and  
keep pace with the limes. We might as well  
require a man to wear still the coat which fitted  
him when a boy, as civilized society to rctna n  
ever under the regimen of their barbarous an­  
cestors; it is this preposterous idea which has  
lately deluged Europe in blood, their monarch*,  
instead of wisely yielding to the gradual chang­  
es of circumstances, of favoring progres-ive  
accommodation to progressive improvement, have  
clung to old abuses, intrenched themselves behind  
steady hsbits, and obliged their subjects to seek,  
through blood and violence, rash and ruinous in­  
novations, which had they been refened to the  
peaceful deliberations and collected wisdom of  
the nation, would have been put into acceptable  
and salutary forms. Le^us follow no such ex­  
amples,nor weakly believe that one generation is not  
as capable as another of taking care of itself; and  
of ordering it’s own affairs. Let us, our sis­  
ter states have done, avail ourselves of our rea­  
son and experience to rf.rrCct the etude essays of  
our first and unexperienced, althc’ wise, virtuous,  
and well meaning councils. And lastly, let us  
pro. Me in our constitution fur it’s revision at eta.  
ted periods. What these periods should be,nature  
herself indicates. By the European tables of mor­  
tality of the adults living at any one moment of  
time, a majority will be dead in about 19 years,  
at the end of that period then a new majority is  
come into place; or in other words, a new genera­  
tion, each generation ie as independent of the one  
preceding, aa that was of all which had gone be.  
fore; it has then, like them, a right to choose for  
itself the form of government it believes u:os:  
promotive of it’s own happiness, consequently to  
accommodate to the circumstances in which it  
finds itself that received from it’s predecessors;  
and it is for the peace and good of mankind that  
a solemn opportunity of doing this every nineteen  
or twenty years, should be provided by the consti­  
tution; so that it may be handed on, with period­  
ical repairs, from generation to generation to|the  
end of time, if any thing human can so long en­  
dure. It i* now loity years since the Constitu­  
tion of Virginia was formed; the same tables in­  
form us that, within that period, two-thirds of  
the adults then living are now dead: have then  
the remaining third, even if they had the wish, the  
right to hold in obedience to their will, and to  
laws heretofore made by them, the other two­  
thirds who with themselves compose the present  
ma*H of adults? if they have not, who has ? the  
dead? but the dead have no right*; they are noth­  
ing; and nothing cannot own something. Where  
there is no substance, there can be no accident —  
This corporeal globe, and every thing upon it, be­  
long* to it’s present corporeal inhabitants, during  
their generation. They alone have a right to direct  
what is the concern of them*elres alone, and to  
declare the law of that direction: and this decla­  
ration can only be made by their majority; that  
majority then has a right to depute representa­  
tives to a Convention, and to make the Constitu­  
tion what they think will be best for thetnseives  
—But how collect their voice? This is the real  
difficulty. If invited by private authority to county  
or district meetings, these divisions are so large  
that few will attend, and their voice will be im­  
perfectly, or fahrly pronounced, litre then, would  
be one of the advantages of the ward-divisions I  
have proposed. The mayor of every ward, on a :  
question like the present, would call his ward  
together, take the simple Yea or Nay of tt»  
member*, convey there to the county court,  
who would hand on those of all its wards to the  
proper general authority, and the voice of the  
whole people would be thus fairly, fully, and  
peaceably expressed, discussed and decided by the  
common reason of the society. If this avenue be  
shut to the call of suffetance it will make itself  
heard through that of force, and we shall go on, as  
other nations are doing, in the eridle«s circle of  
oppression, rebellion, reformation, and oppres­  
sion ; rebellion, reformation again, and so on for  
ever.  
These, Sir, are my opinions of the governments  
we see among men, and of the principles by which  
alone we may prevent our own from falling into  
the same dreadful track. I have given them at  
greater length than your letter called for, but I  
cannot say things by halvrs; and I confide them to  
your honor, so to use them as to eserve me Irotn  
the gridiron of the public papers; if ,ou should ap­  
prove and enforce them, as you have .-lone that of j  
equal representation they may do some good, if  
not, keep them to yourself as the effusions of with­  
ered age and useless time.  
1 shall, with not the less truth, assure you of my  
great respect and consideration.

“Monticello, July 12, 1816.  
“Sir:—I duly received your favor of June  
13, with a copy of the letters on the calling a  
Convention, on which you are pleased to ask  
my opinion. I have not been in the habit of  
mysterious reserve on any subject, nor of but­  
toning up my opinions within my own dou­  
blet: on the contrary, while in public service  
especially, I have thought the public entitled to  
frankness, and intimately to know whom they  
employed—but I am now retired: I resign my­  
self a passenger, with confidence to those at the  
present helm, and ask but lor rest, peace and  
good will. The question you propose on equal  
representation, has become a party one, in  
which I wish to take no public share, yet ii it  
be asked for your own satisfaction only, and not  
to be quoted before the public, I -have no mo­  
tive to withhold it, and the less from you, as it  
coincides with your own. At the birth of our  
  
republic, I committed that opinion to the world  
in the draught of a Constitution annexed to the  
Notes on Virginia, in which a provision was  
inserted for a representation permanently equal.  
The intancy of the subject at that moment, and  
our inexperience of self government occasioned  
gross departures, in that draught, from genuine  
republican canons. In truth, the abuse of mon­  
archy had so much filled all the space of polit­  
ical contemplation that we imagined every  
thing republican which was not monarchy, we  
had not yet penetrated to the mother principle  
that governments are republican only in pro­  
portion as they embody the will of their peo­  
ple, and execute it —Hence, our first constitu­  
tions had really no leading principle in them,  
but experience and reflection have but more Sc  
more confirmed me in the particular impor­  
tance of the equal representation then propos­  
ed. On that point I am entirely in sentiment  
with your letters; and only lament that a copy  
right of your pamphlet prevents their appear­  
ance in the newspapers, were alone they would  
be generally read, and produce a general effect.  
The present vacancy too of other matter would  
give them plaee in every paper, and bring the  
question home to every man&#x27;s conscience.  
But inequality of representation, in both hou­  
ses of our legislature, is not the only republic­  
an heresy in this first essay of our revolutionary  
patriots at forming a constitution, for let it be  
agreed that a government is republican in pro­  
portion as every member composing it has his  
equal voice in the direction of its concerns,  
(not indeed in person, which would be imprac­  
ticable beyond the limits of a city, or small  
township, but) by representatives chosen by  
himself, and responsible to him at short peri­  
ods, and let us bring to the test of this canon  
every branch of our constitution.  
In the legislature, the House of Representa­  
tives is chosen by less than half the people, and  
not at all in proportion to those who do choose.  
The Senate are still more disproportionate, and  
for long terms of irresponsibility. In the Exe­  
cutive, the Governor is entirely independent of  
the choice of the people, and of their control;  
his Council equally so, and at best but a fifth  
wheel to a waggon. In the Judiciary, the jud­  
ges of the highest courts are dependant on none  
but themselves. In England, where judges  
were named and removable at the will of an  
hereditary Executive, from which branch most  
misrule was feared, and has flowed, it was a  
great point gained, by fixing them for life, to  
make them independent of that Executive.—  
But in a government founded on the public will,  
the principle operates in an opposite direction,  
and against that will. There too they were  
still removable on a concurrence of the Execu­  
  
tive and legislative branches; out we nave maue  
them independent of the nation itself: they are  
irremovable but by their own body for any de­  
pravities of conduct, and even by their own bo­  
dy for the imbecilities of dotage. 1 he justices  
of the inferior courts are self-chosen, are for  
life, and perpetuate their own body in succes­  
sion forever, so that a faction once possessing  
itself of the bench of a county, can never be  
broken up, but hold their county in chains for­  
ever indissoluble. Yet these justices are the  
real executive, as well as judiciary m all our  
minor and most ordinary concerns;—they tax  
us at will: fill the office of Sheriff, the. most im­  
portant of all the executive officers of the coun­  
ty, name nearly all our military leaders, which  
leaders, once named, are removable but by  
themselves. The Juries, our judges of all fact,  
and of law when they choose it, are not selected  
by the people, nor amenable to them; they are  
chosen by an officer named by the court and  
executive. Chosen, did I say? picked up by  
the Sheriff from the loungings of the court  
yard, after every thing respectable has retired  
from it—where then is our republicanism to  
be found? Not in our constitution certainly,  
but merely in the spirit ot our people, that  
would oblige even a despot to govern us repub­  
licanlv; owing to this spirit and to nothing in  
the form of our constitution, all things have  
gone well. But this fact, so triumphantly mis­  
quoted by the enemies of reformation, is not  
the fruit of our constitution, but has prevailed  
in spite of it; our functionaries have done well,  
because generally honest men; if any were not  
so, they feared to show it.  
But it will be said it is easier to find faults  
than to amend them. I do not think their a­  
amendment so difficult as is pretended; only lay  
down true principles, and adhere to them in­  
flexibly. Do not be frightened into their sur­  
render by the alarms of the timid, or thecroak­  
ings of wealth against the ascendancy of the  
people. If experience be called for, appeal to  
that of our 15 or 20 governments for 40 years,  
and show me where the people have done half  
the mischief in these forty years, that a single  
despot would have done in a single year; or  
shew where half the riots and rebellions, the  
crimes and the punishments which have taken  
place in any single nation, under kingly govern­  
ment, during the same period. The true foun­  
dation of republican government, is the equal  
right of every citizen in his person, and proper­  
  
ty, and in their management, i ry uy as a  
tallev, every provision of our constitution, and  
see if it hangs directly on the will of the people;  
reduce your legislature to a convenient number  
for full,’ but orderly discussion; let every man  
who fights or pays, exercise his just and equal  
right in their election, submit them to approba­  
tion or rejection at short intervals—let the ex­  
ecutive be chosen in the same way, and for the  
same term, by those whose agent he is to be;  
and leave no screen of a council behind which  
to skulk from responsibility. It has been thought  
that the people ate noi competent electors of  
Judges learned in the law, but I do not know  
that this is true; and if doubtful, we should fol­  
low principle: in this, as in many other elec­  
tions, they would be guided by reputation,  
which would not err oltener perhaps than the  
present mode ot appointment: in one state of  
the Union at least it has been long tried and  
with the most satisfactoiy success. 1 he judg­  
es of Connecticut have been chosen by the peo­  
ple every sixth months for nearly two centuries;  
and I believe there has hardly ever been an in­  
stance of change; so powerful is the curb of in­  
cessant responsibility. If prejudice, however,  
derived from a monarchical institution, is still  
to prevail against the vital elective principle of  
our own, and if the existing example among  
ourselves of periodical election of judges by the  
people be still mistrusted, let us at least not a­  
dopt the evil and reject the good of the English  
  
precedent; let us retain amovability on the con- j  
currence of the executive and legislative branch­  
es, and nomination by the executive alone: no­  
mination to office is an executive function; to  
give it to the legislature, as we do, is a viola­  
tion of the principle of the separation of powers,  
it swerves the members from correctness by  
temptation to intrigue for office themselves,  
and to a corrupt barter of votes; and destroys  
responsibility by dividing it among a multitude.  
By leaving nomination its proper place among  
executive functions, the principle of the distri­  
bution of power is preserved, and responsibili­  
ty weighs with its heaviest force on a single  
head. The organization of our county admi­  
nistrations may be thought more difficult, but  
follow principle, and the knot unties itself: di­  
vide the counties into wards of such size as that  
every citizen can attend when called on, and act  
in person; ascribe to them the government of  
their wards in all things relating to themselves^  
exclusively; a justice chosen by themselves in  
each, a constable, a military company, a pa­  
trole, a school, the care of their own poor, of  
the public roads, the choice of one or more ju­  
rors to serve in some court, and the delivery,  
within their own wards of their own votes for  
all elective officers of higher sphere, will relieve  
the county administration of nearly all its bu­  
siness, will have it better done, and by making  
every citizen an acting member of the govern­  
ment, and in the offices nearest and most inter­  
esting to him, will attach him by his strongest  
feelings to the independence of his country,  
and its republican constitution. The justices  
thus chosen by every ward, would constitute  
the county court, would do its judiciary busi­  
ness, direct roads and bridges, levy counlv and  
poor rates, and administer all the matters of  
common interest to the whole county: the3*  
wards, called townships, in New-England, are  
the vital principle of their governments, and  
have proved themselves the wisest invention  
ever devised by the wit of man for the perfect  
exercise of self-government and for its preser­  
vation. We should thus marshall our govern­  
ment into—1. The General Federal Republic,  
for all concerns foreign and federal—2. That  
of the Stale, for what relates to our own citi­  
zens exclusively—3 The county republics, for  
the duties and concerns of the county,—and 4.  
The Ward Republics, for the small, and yet  
numerous k interesting concerns of the neigh­  
borhood; and in^overnment, as well as in every  
other business of life, it is by division and sub­  
division alone, that all matters, great and small,  
can be managed to perfection, and the whole is  
cemented by giving to every citizen personally  
a part in the administration of the public af­  
  
i a i i oi  
The sum of these amendments—1. general  
suffrage—2. equal representation in the legis­  
lature—3. an executive chosen by the people—  
4 judges elective or amovable—5. justices, ju­  
rors and sheriffs elective—6. ward divisions,  
and 7. periodical amendments of the constitu­  
tion. I have thrown out these, as loose heads  
of amendment, for consideration and correc­  
tion: and their object is to secure self govern­  
ment by the republicanism of our constitution,  
as well as by the spirit of the people; and it is  
to nourish and perpetuate that spirit. I am  
not among those who fear the people. They,  
and not the rich, are our dependence for conti­  
nued freedom; and, to preserve their indepen­  
dence we must not let rulers load us with per­  
petual debt; we must make our election between  
economy and, liberty or profusion and servitude—If  
we run into such debts that we must be taxed  
in our meat and in our drink, in our necessa­  
ries and our comforts, in our labors and our  
amusements, for our callings and our creeds,  
as the people of England are, our people, like  
them, must come to labor 16 hours in 24, give  
the earnings of i5 of these to the government  
for their debts and daily expences; and the i6lh  
being insufficient to afford us bread, we must  
live as they now do, on, oatmeal and potatoes;  
have no time to think, no means of calling the  
mismanagers to account, but be glad to obtain  
subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their  
chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers.—  
Our land holders too, like theirs, retaining in­  
deed the title and stewardship of estates called  
theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury,  
must wander, like theirs, in foreign countries,  
and be contented with penury, obscurity, exile,  
and the glory of the nation. This example  
reads to us the salutary lesson that private for­  
tunes are destroyed by public, as well as by pri­  
vate extravagance. And this is the tendency of  
all human governments. A departure from  
principles in one instance becomes a precedent  
for a 2d, that second for a 3d, and soon till the  
bulk of the society is reduced to be mere^uto­  
matons of misery, to have no sensibilities left  
but for sinning and suffering. Then begins in­  
deed the helium omnium in omnia, which some  
philosophers observing to be so general in this  
world, have mistaken it for the natural, instead  
of the abusive, slate of man; and the forchorse  
of this frightful team is Public Debt.—Taxa­  
tion follows that, and its train wretchedness  
  
and oppression.  
Some men look at Constitutions with sancti­  
monious reverence, and deem them like the ark  
of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.—  
They ascribe to the men of the preceding age  
a wisdom more than human, and suppose what  
they did to be beyond amendment. I knew that  
age well. I belonged to it; and labored with it;  
it deserved well of its country; it was very like  
the present, but without the experience ol the  
present: and 40 years of experience in govern­  
ment is worth a century of book reading; and  
this they would say themselves, were they to  
rise from the dead. I am certainly not an ad­  
vocate for frequent and untried changes in laws  
and constitutions. I think moderate imperfec­  
tions had better be borne with; because, when  
once known, we accommodate ourselves, to  
them and find practical means of correcting  
their ill effects; but I know also that laws and  
institutions must go hand in hand with the pro­  
gress of the human mind; as that becomes  
more developed, more enlightened, as new dis­  
coveries are made, new truths disclosed, and  
manners and opinions change with the change  
of circumstances, institutions must advance al­  
so, and keep pace with the times. We might  
as well require a man to wear still the coat  
which fitted him when a boy, as civilized socie­  
ty to remain ever under the regimen of their  
barbarous ancestors; it is this preposterous  
idea which has lately deluged Europe in blood  
—their monarchs, instead of wisely yielding to I  
  
the gradual change of circumstances, of favor­  
ing progressive impiovement, have clung to  
old abuses, intrenched themselves behind stea­  
dy-habits, and obliging their subjects to seek*  
through blood and violence, rash and ruinous  
innovations, which had they been referred to  
the peaceful deliberations, and collected wis­  
dom of the nation, would have been put in*0 ac­  
ceptable and salutary forms. Let us follow  
no such examples, nor weakly believe that one  
generation is not as capable as another of tak  
ing care of itself, and of ordering its own af­  
fairs. Let us, as our sister states have done  
avail ourselves of our reason and experience  
to correct the crude essays of our first and un­  
experienced, although wise, virtuous, and well  
meaning councils. And lastly let uS provide  
in our constitution for its revision at stated pe­  
riods. What these periods should be, nature  
herself indicates. By the European tables of  
mortality, of the adults living at any one mo­  
ment of time, a majority will be dead in a­  
bout 19 years; and at the end of that period  
then a new majority is come into place, or in  
other words a new generation is as indepen­  
dent of the one preceding, as that was of all  
which had gone before; it has then, like them  
a right to choose for itself the form of govern*  
ment it believes most promotive cf its 0\vn  
happiness; consequently to accommodate to the  
circumstances in which it finds itself that re­  
ceived from its predecessors; and it is for the  
peace and good of mankind that a solemn op­  
portunity of doing this every 19 or 20 years  
should be provided by the constitution, so that  
it may be handed on with periodical repairs  
from generation to generation to the end of  
| time, if any thing human can so long endure.  
Iiisnovv 40 years since the constitution ofVir  
ginia was formed. The same tables inform u*  
I that, within that period, two-thirds of the adult­  
then living are now dead. Have then the re  
maining third, even if they had the wish, the  
right to hold in obedience to their will, and to  
laws heretofore made by them, the other two  
thirds who with themselves compose the pre­  
sent mass of adults? The dead! But the dead  
have no rights, they are nothing, and nothing  
cannot own something. Where there is no sub­  
stance, there can be no accident. This corpo­  
real globe, and every thing upon it, belongs to  
its present corporeal inhabitants, during their  
generation. They alone have a right to direct  
what is the concern of themselves alone, and to  
declare the law of that direction: and this de  
duration can only be made by their majority  
That majority then has a right to depute repre­  
sentatives to a Convention, and to make the  
constitution what they think will lie be.vt for  
  
themselves. But how collect their voice? this  
is the real difficulty. If invited by private au­  
thority to county or district meetings, these di­  
visions are so large that few will attend, and  
their voice will be imperfectly or falsely pro­  
nounced. Here then would be one of the ad­  
vantages of the ward divisions I have proposed.  
The mayor of every ward, on a question like the  
present, would call his ward together, take the  
simple yea or nay of its members, convey these  
to the county court, who would hand on those  
of all its wards to the proper general authority,  
and the voice of the whole people would be  
thus fairly, fully and peaceably expressed, dis  
cussed and decided by the common reason of  
the society. If this avenue be shut to the cal!  
of sufferance, it will make itself heard through  
that of force, aud we shall go on, as other na­  
tions are doing, in the endless circle of oppres­  
sion, rebellion, reformation; and oppression, re­  
bellion, reformation again, and so on forever.  
These, sir, are my opinions of the govern­  
ments we see among men, and of the principles  
by which alone we may prevent our own from  
falling into the same dreadful track. I have  
given them at greater length than your letter  
called for, but I cannot say things by halves;  
and I confide them to your honor, so to use  
them as to preserve me from the gridiron of the  
public papers. If you should approve and er.  
force them, as you have done that of equal re­  
presentation, they may do some good; if not, i  
keep them to yourself as the effusions of wi  
thered age and useless lime.  
I shall, with not less truth, assure you of my  
great respect and consideration.

d-jitet] Alontieelhi, July 12, 1816.  
  
Sir — I duly received your favor of June 13  
with a copy of the letters on the calling a con  
vention, on which you are pleased to ask my  
opinion. I hav • not been in the habit of mys-  
teriems reserve on any subject, nor of buttoning  
lip mv ©pioion.s within my own doublet; on the  
coiiirary, while in public service especially, I  
li-ive thought the public entitled to frankuess,  
au I intimately to know whom they employed.  
Hut 1 am now retired. 1 resign myself as a pas  
senger with confidence to those at the present  
halm, and ask but for rest, peace and good will  
The question you propose on equal rcpresenla-  
fioii, has become a parly one, in which I wish to  
take no public share; yet. if it be asked for your  
own s.itisfa.ctiiin only, ami not to be quoted be-  
fore the public, I have no motive to withho H it,  
ao-l the less from you, as it coincides with your  
own.  
  
At the birth of our republic, I committed that  
opinion to the world in the draft ofa constitution  
annexed to the Notes on Virginia, in which a&#x27;  
provision was inserted for a representation per-j  
Dianently equal. &#x27;Fhe infancy of the subject atj  
tii.it moment, and our inexperience of self gov-  
ernment occasioned gross departures, in that  
draft, from genuine repiiMictm canons. In truth |  
the abuses ofmmarchy had so much filled all!  
the space of political contemplation, that we im-|  
magmed every thing republican which was not &#x27;  
monarchy. We had not yet penetrated to the j  
mother principle that governments are republi-|  
can ouly in proportion ns they embody the will,  
of their people, and execute if. Hence, our first  
c institutions had really no leading principle in  
them; hut experience and renec.tion have hut  
more and more contirined mein the particular  
imj) irlance of the equal representation then pro  
posed. On that point then I am entirely in sen-  
timent with your letters; and only lament that n  
copj right of ^our pamphlet prevents their ap-  
jiearance in the news|)aper8, where alone they  
would be generally read, and produce general  
effect. The pre.«ent vacancy too of other matter  
would give them place in every paper and bring  
the question home to every man’s conscience.  
  
liut, inequality of representation, in both  
houses i f our legislature, is not the only repnh-  
Itcaii heresy in this first e.«ay of our revolution-  
ary patriots at forming a constitution; for let it  
be u.ijreed that a government is repuhlioan in pro-  
portion as every member composing it has his  
equ.il voice in the direction of its.concerns, (not  
inJeeil in person, which would be impracticable  
beyond the limits of a city, or .small township,  
bui)by representatives chosen by himself, and  
responsible to him at short periods, and let us  
bring to the test of this canon every branch of  
our constitution. ’ ,  
  
In the legislature, the house of reprcsenhilives  
isthosen by less than half the. people, and not at  
  
all in proportion to those who do choW. The  
  
senate are still more dispropoHioiiate, and for  
long terms of irresponsibility In the executive,  
the governor is entirely independent ofihe choice  
of the people, and of their control; his council  
equally so, and at best but a fifth wheel to a wag-  
on. In the judiciary, the judges of the highest  
courts are dependant on none but themselves. In  
F.Hgland, where judges were named and remov  
able attbe will of an hereditary executive, from  
which branch most misrule was feared, and has  
fl )wed, it was a great point gained, by fi.xing them  
fur lii&#x27;e, to make them independent of that exec-  
utive. Hut in a government foundcil on the pub  
lie will, this principle operates in an opimsite di-  
rection, and against that will. There, toiy, they  
were still retiiy able on a concurrence ofihe ex-  
ecutive and legislative hraachen; but we h.ave  
inade them independent of the nation itself. They  
are irremovable but by their own body for any  
depraa-ilies of conduct, .and even liy their own  
hi ly for the imbecilities of dotage. The jus-  
tices of the inferior courts are selfcbo.sen, are  
for life, and perpetuate their own body in succes-  
sion forever, so that a faction once possessing it-  
• !f of the bench ofa country, can never be bro-  
ken up. but hold their country in chains forever  
indissoluble Yet these justices are the real cx

well, because generally honest men. If iini y  
were not so they feared to shew it.  
  
I’liil it is said, that it is easiei .to firid faults than  
id amend them. 1 do not think their nniend-  
ineiit so difhciilt as is pretended. Only lav down  
true principles and adhere to them intlexihiv j  
Do not he frighlcoed into their surrender hy ibej  
alarms of the timid, or the croakings of wealthl

rience be called for. appeal to that of our fifteen  
or twenty governments for firiy years and shew  
me w hei;* the people have oiine half the mis-  
chiefin those forty years, that a single despot!

halfthe riois anil rebellions, the crimes find lbe|  
pnnislinient, which have taken place in anv .-in  
gle iialion, under kingly government, diiiiiiglhe  
same period The true foundation of repuhlicaii  
govei nmeiit is the equal right of ever) citizen  
in his per- Ml. and pioperly, and in their mati-ige-  
merit. Try by this, as a tally, every provision&#x27;  
of our constitution, and see if it hangs directly  
on the w ill of the people; reduce your legi-l.i-  
tiire to a cocvenie.nt number for full but orderly^  
di.-cussion; let every man who fights or pays, ex-|  
ercise liisjiist and equal right in tlioir electini;i  
submit lliem to approbation or rejei tion atslH&gt;i l|  
iutervals; let the executive be c|ioaen in the same-  
way, and for the same term, by tlu.se whose a-|  
gent he is to be; and leave no screen ofa coun-  
cil behind which to skulk from responsibility.  
  
It lias lie&gt; o tliouglit that the people are not-  
conipetenl electors of judges karnedin the /aa’;|  
but 1 do not know that this is true; and ifdo&#x27;ibt-;  
ful, we should follow principle In this as in!  
man) other elections, they would be guided by -  
reputation, which would not err oftener perhapsj.  
than the present mode of appointment. In one,  
state of the union at least it has been long tried!  
anil with the most satisfactorv success, &#x27;I&#x27;lie  
judges of Cnnnecticut has been chosen by the&#x27;  
people every six months for nearly two centuries^  
and- 1 believe there has hardly ever been an in |  
st.ince of change; so powerful is the curb of in-|  
cessant responsibility. If prejudice, however,&#x27;  
derived from a m&#x27;lnarchical institution, is still to  
prevail against the vital elective princijile of  
our own, and if the existing example among our-  
selves of periodical election of judges by the!  
people be still mistrusted, let us at least not a-;  
dopt the evil and reject the good of the English!  
precedent; let us retain amovabiliiv on the con-  
currence of the executive ami legi-lalive branch  
es, and nomination by the executive alone- Nom  
illation to otfice is an executive function; to give  
it to the legisb.tiire, as vve do, is a violation of  
the principle of the separation of powers;  
swerves the ineoihers from correctness by temp  
fation to intrigue for office themselves, and to a  
corrupt barter of votes; and destroys respon.si-1  
bility by dividing it among a multitude. Hy  
leaving nomination in its proper place among ex-  
ecutive (unctions, the principle of the distribution  
of power is preserved, and responsibility weighs’  
with its heaviest force on a single head. |  
  
The organization of our roiintrv admintsira j  
tions may be thought more difficult; but follow  
principle, and the knot unties itself Divide the!  
counties into wards of such size as that every!  
citizen can attend when called on and act in per-j  
.son. Ascribe to them the gover.iment of their!  
wards in all things relating to themselves exclu-  
sively ; a justice chosen by themselves in each,  
a constable, a military company, apatrole. a(  
school, the care of their own poor theirown por !  
tion nl the public road, the choice of one or more!  
jurors to serve in some court, and the delivery i  
within tlieir own wards of theirown vote.s for .ill !  
elective officers of higher sphei-c. will relieve&#x27;  
the county administration of nearly all its busi-!  
ness, will have it better done, and by making  
every citizen an acting member of the govern-

I have thrown out these, as loose &#x27; eads  
of mnendment, for consideration and cor­  
rection ; and their object is to secure selfs

constitution as’ well as bv the spirit o&#x27; the  
people, and it is to nourizh and to per; etu­  
ate that spirit. lam notamong those who  
fear the people. They, and not the rich,  
are our dependence for continued 1o edom:  
and, to preserve their independence we  
must not let our rolers load us wi&#x27;h per­  
petnal debt; we must make our election  
between economy and liberly, or profusion  
and screitude. \l!&#x27; we run into sucu debts  
as that, we must be taxed in our meat and  
onr drink, in onr necessaries and our coni­  
forts, in our labors and cur anmuseme nts, for  
our callings and our creeds, as the people of  
Eng]and are; onr pcoplc like them, must  
come to labor 16 honts in 24, give the earn­  
ings of 15 of these to the govermuent for  
their debts and daily expenses; and the  
16th, being insufficient to aflord us bread,  
we must live, as they now do, o oatmneal  
and potatoes, have no time to think, no  
means of calling the mismanagers to ac­  
count ; but be glad to obtain subsistence by  
hiring ourselves to rivet their chains, on  
the necks of our fellow sufferers. Our  
landholders too, like theirs, retuining in­  
deed the title and stewardship of estates  
called theirs, but held really in trust for the  
treasury ; must wander like theirs, in for­  
cign countries, and be contented with pen­  
ury, obscurity, exile, and the glory of the  
nation. &quot;This example reads to us t{e salu­  
tary lesson, that private fortunes are de­  
stroyed by public as well as by private ex­  
travagance. And this is the tendency of  
4 human governments. A departure from  
principle in one instance becomes a pre­  
cedent fora 2d, that 2d for a d, and so on  
nil the bulk of the society is reduced to be  
mere antomatons of misery, to have no sen-

Alunticcllu, July l2, 1^10.  
Sir—I duly received your favor of Jum; idth  
Avith a copy of the loiters on the calling a Conven­  
tion, on which you are pleased to ask my opinion.  
1 have not been in the habit of mysterious reserve  
°n any subject, nor of buttoning up iny opinions;  
within my o\Vn doublet. On the contrary, while  
iii public service especially, I have thought the  
public entitled to frankness, and intimately to  
know whom they employed. But l am now reti­  
red : I resign myself, as a passenger, with confi­  
dence to those at the present helm, and ask but  
for rest, peace and good will. The question you  
propose, on equal representation, has become a  
party one, in which I wish to take no public share.  
Vet, if it be asked foi your own satisfaction only,  
and not to be quoted before the public, I have no  
motive to withhold it, and the less from you, as it  
coincides with your own. At the birth of our re­  
public. 1 committed that opinion to the world, in  
the draught of a Constitution annexed to the Notes  
&#x27;on Virginia, in which a provision \v is inserted for  
a representation permanently equal. The infancy  
of the subject at that moment, and our iuexpc­  
licnco of self government occasioned gross depar­  
tures, in that draught, from genuine republican  
canons. In truth, the abuses of monarchy had so  
much tilled all the space of political contemplation,  
that we imagined every thing republican which  
was not imonarchy. \Vc had not yet penetrated to  
the mother principle that ‘ governments arc repub­  
lican only in proportion as they embody the will of  
their people, and execute it.’ Hence, our first  
constitutions had really no leading principles in  
them. But experience and rcllcction have but  
more and more confirmed me in the particular im­  
portance of I he equal representation then proposed.  
On that point then I am entirely in sentiment  
with your letters; and only lament that a copy  
right of your pamphlet prevents their appearance  
in the newspapers, where alone they would he  
generally read, and produce general effect. The  
present vacancy too of other matter would give  
them place in every paper, and bring the question  
home to every man’s conscience.  
But, inequality of representation, in both houses  
ot our Legislature, is not the only republican her­  
esy in this first essay efour revolutionary patriots  
at forming a constitution. For let it be agreed  
that a government is republican in proportion as  
every member composing it has his equal voice in  
i.he direction of its concerns, (not indeed in per­  
son, which would be impracticable beyond the  
limits of a city, or small township, but) by repre­  
sentatives chosen by himself, and responsible to  
him at short periods, and let us bring to the test  
ol this canon every branch of our constitution.  
In the legislature, the House of Representatives  
is chosen by less than half the people, and not at  
nil in proportion to those who do choose. The  
Senate are still more disproportionate, and for long  
•terms of irresponsibility.—In the Executive, the  
  
tiovernor is entirely independent ot the choice of  
J.ite people, ami of their control ; his Council equal­  
ly so. and at host hut a tilth wheel to n waggon.—  
In the Judiciary, the Judges of the highest courts  
are dependant on none lull themselves. In Eng  
laud where Judges are named, and removable at  
tiie will of an hereditary Executive, from which  
branch most misrule was feared, and has flowed,  
it was a great point gained, by fixing them for life,  
•to make them independent of the Executive,  
ibit in a government founded on the public will,  
this principle operates in an opposite direction  
Mid against that will. There loo they were still  
removable on a concurrence of the Executive and  
.Legislative branches lint we have made them  
independent of the (nation itself. They are irre­  
movable but by their own body for any depravities  
of conduct, and even by their own body for the  
imbecilities of dotage. The justices of the inferior  
-courts are self chosen, are for life, and perpetuate  
their own body in succession foiever, so that a  
faction once possessing itself of the bench of a  
county, can never be btoken up, but hold their  
county in chains, forever indissoluble. Yet  
these Justices are the real Executive, ns well as Ju­  
diciary in all our minor and most ordinary con­  
cerns. They tax us at will; till the office of sher­  
iff, the most important of all the executive officers  
of the conn ty, name nearly all our military lead­  
ers, which leaders, once named, arc removable  
Suit by themselves.—The Juries, our judges of all  
fact, and of law when they choose it, aic not se­  
lected by the people, nor amenable to them.  
They are chosen by an officer named by the Court  
nnd Executive. Chosen, did I say? Picked up  
by the shfiilT from the lounging? of the court  
yard, after over; thing respectable has retired from  
it.—Wlicro Ysr. is our republicanism to be found ?  
Not in our constitution certainly, but merely in  
the spiiit of our people. That would oblige even  
a despot to govern us republicanly. Owing to  
this spirit, and to nothing in the form of our con­  
  
smut ion, all things have gone well. ltut this fact.  
*&gt; triumphantly misquoted l&gt;y the enemies of re­  
form »ion, is not the fruit ol our Constitution, but  
has prerailed in spite of it. Our functionaries  
have done well, because generally honest nacn.  
If any were not so, they feared to show it.  
But it will be said it is easier to find faults than  
to amend them. I do not think their amendment  
so difficult as is pretended. Only lay down true  
principles, and adhere to them inflexibly. Do  
not be frightened into their &#x27;surrender by the  
alarms of the timid, or the croakings of wealth  
a gainst the ascendency of the people. If expe­  
rience he rilled for, appeal to that of our lf&gt; or 20  
governments for 40 years, and show me where the  
pcoplo have done half the mischief in these 40  
years, that a single despot would have done in a  
single year; or show half the riots and rebellions,  
the oriuics and the punishments which have taken  
place in any single nation, under Kingly Govern­  
ment, during the same period. The true founda­  
tion of republican government is the equal right of  
¥/ cry citizen, in his person and property, and in  
their management. Try by this, as a tally, every  
provision of our constitution, and see ifit bangs  
djreeclly on the willof the people. Iteduceyour  
legislature to a convenient number for full, but  
orderly discussion. Let every man who fights or  
pays, exercise his just and equal right in their elcc­  
t.on. Submit them to approbation or rejection at  
short intervals.—T/Ct the Executive he chosen in  
the same way. and for the same term, hv those  
whose agent ho is ta Itc : ar.d leave no screen of a  
council b hind which to skulk from responsibility.  
—It has been thought tint the people arc not com­  
petent electors t f Judges l-arnc.rl in thrlnir, JJuf  
I do n;»t know that, this is true, and, if doubtful,  
wo should follow principle. In this, as in many  
other ejector*, they would be guided by republ­  
ic , which would not err oflenCr perhaps than the  
pre nt mod. of ippomlmcnt. In one state ofth*  
  
union at least it h is been long tried and with the  
most satisfactory success. The Judges of Con-1  
uecticut have been chosen by the people every 6  
months for nearly two centuries, and I believe there  
has hardly ever been an instance of change ; so  
powerful is the curb of incessant responsibility.  
If prejudice however,derived from a monarchical  
institution, is still to prevail against the vital elec­  
tive principle of our own, and if the existing ex­  
ample among ourselves of periodical election of  
Judges by the people be still mistrusted, let us at  
least not adopt tlie evil and reject the good of the  
English precedent: let us retain a movability on  
the concurrence of the executive and legislative  
branches, and nomination bv the executive alone.  
Nomination to office is an executive function. To  
give it to the legislature, as we do, is a violation  
ol the p inciple of the separation of powers. It  
swerves the members from correctness hy tempta­  
tion to intrigue for ollice themselves, and to a cor­  
rupt barter ui votes; and destroys responsibility hy  
dividing it among a multitude. By leaving nomi­  
nation in its proper place among executive func­  
tions, the principle of the distribution of power is  
preserved, and responsibility weighs with its hea­  
viest force oil a single head. The organization of  
our county administrations may he thought  
more difficult. But follow principle and the knot  
unties itself. Divide the counties into wards of  
such sizo as that every citizen can attend when  
called on, and act in person. Ascribe to them  
the government of their wards in all things rela­  
ting to themselves exclusively. A justice chosen  
hy themselves, in each, a constable, a military  
company, a patrolc, a school, the care of their own  
poor, &amp;, their own portion of the public roads, the  
choice ot one or more Jurors to serve in some  
court, and the delivery, within their own wards,  
ol their own votes for all elective olficcrs of high­  
er sphere will relievo the county administration  
of nearly all its business, will have it better donc,&amp;  
by making every citizen an acting member of the  
government, and in the olficcs nearest and most  
interesting to him, will attach him by his strongest  
feelings to the independence of his country, and  
its republican constitution. The justices thus  
chosen by every ward, would constitute the coun­  
ty court, would do its judiciary business, diicct  
roads and bridges, levy county and poor rates, and  
administer all the matters of common interest to  
the whole county. Those wards, called townships,  
in New England, are the vital principle of their  
governments, and have proved themselves the  
wisest invention ever devised hy the wit of man  
tor the perfect exercise of self-government, and  
lor its preservation. We should thus marshal  
our government into I. tlie General federal re­  
public, lor all concerns foreign and federal; 2.  
that ol the btate for what relates to our own citi­  
zens exclusively. !l. The County republics f. •  
the duties and concerns of the county, and 4. the  
  
H arc] republics, lor the small, and yet numerous  
• nil interesting concerns of the neighborhood:  
and in government, as well in eve&#x27;ry other busi­  
ness ot life, it is by division and sub-division of  
duties alone, that all matters, great and small, can  
oe managed to perfection. And the whole is ce­  
mented by giving to every citizen personally a  
l,afl in the administration of the public allairs.  
The sum of these amendments is first general  
suifrage. i». Equal representation in the legisla­  
ture. 3. An Executive chosen by tho people.  
4. Judges elective or removable. 5. Justices,  
jurors, and sheriffs elective. 0. Ward-divisions,  
and 7. Periodical amendments of the Constitution.’  
1 have thrown out these, as looso heads of  
amendment, for consideration and correction : and  
their object is to secure self-government by the re­  
publicanism of our constitution, as well as by the  
spirit ol tho people; and it is to nourish and per­  
petuate that spirit, i am not among those who  
tear the people. They, and not the r*h, arc our  
depcinlauce for continued freedom. And, to  
preserve their independence, wc must not let’our  
rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must  
make our election between economy anti liberty,  
or profusion anil servitude. If we run into such  
debts as that wc must he taxed i.n our meat and  
in our drink, in our necessaries and onr comforts,  
in our labors and our amusements, for our callings  
ami our creeds, as the people of England are, our  
people like them, must come to labor 10 hours in  
the £4.give the earnings of l.&quot;&gt; of these to the gov­  
ernment for their debts and daily expenses; and  
the 10th being insufficient to afford us bread, wc  
must live, as they now do, on oatmeal and pota­  
toes; have no time to think, no means of calling  
the mismanagers to account; but be glad to ol&gt;  
tain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their  
chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers. Our  
land-holders too, like theirs, retaining indeed  
toe tillc,&amp;. stewardship of estates called theirs, hut  
held really in trust for the treasury, must wander  
like theirs, in foreign countries, and ho contented  
w ith penury, obscurity, exile, and the glory of the  
natua. This example reads to us tho salutarv  
  
Jesriontliat private fortunes arc destroyed by pub­  
lic, as well as by private extravagance. And this  
is the tendency of all human governments. A  
departure Irorn principle in one instance becomes  
a precedent for a second ; that 2d. for a 3d. and  
so on, till the bulk of society is reduced to bo  
Mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities  
left but for sinning and suffering. Then begins  
indeed the helium omnium in omnia, which some  
philosophers observing to be so general in this world,  
have mistaken it for the natural, instead of tho abu­  
sive state of men. And tho forehorse of this frightful  
team is Public debt. Taxation follows that, and  
in its train wretchedness and oppression.  
Some men look at constitutions with sanctimo­  
nious reverence, and deem them like the ark of  
the covenant, too saced to he touched.- They as  
cribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom  
more than human,and sumiosc what they did to be  
beyond amendment. I knew that age well; I be­  
longed to it. and labored with it. It deserves well  
of its country.. It was very like the present, hut  
without the experience of the present: and 10 years  
of experience in government is worth a century of  
Imok-readmg: and this they would say themselves,  
were they to rise from the dead. I am certain- ;  
ly not an advocate for frequent nnd untried chan­  
ges in laws and constitutions. I think moderate  
imperfections had better be borne with; because  
when once known, we accommodate ourselves to  
them, and find practical means of correcting their  
ill effects. Hut 1 know also that laws and institu­  
tions must go hand in hand with the progress of  
the human mind. As that becomes more developed  
mom enlightened, as new discoveries are made,  
new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions  
change with the change of circumstances, institu­  
tions must advance also, and keep pace with the  
times. We might as well require a man lc wear  
Mill the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civ­  
di/.c&#x27;l society to remain ever under the regimen I  
  
ol their barbarous ancestors. It is this preposter  
ous idea which lias lately deluded Europe in blood.  
Their monarchy instead of wisely yielding to the  
gradual changes of circuinstaaces,orfavoring pro­  
gressive accommodation to progressive improve­  
ment, have clung to old abuses, intrenched them­  
selves behind steady habits, ami obliged their sub­  
jects to soCit, thro blood and violence, rash and  
ruinous innovations, which, had they been refer­  
red to the peaceful deliberations, and collected  
wisdom of the nation, would have been put into ac­  
ceptable and aatua*-y forms. LctHs follow no such  
examples, nor weakly believe that one generation  
is not as capable as another to take care of itself,  
and ol ordering its own ail&#x27;.virs. Lot ua, as our  
sister-states have done, avail ourselves of our rea­  
son and experience to correct the crude essays of  
olour first an 1 unexperienced, alt ho’ wise, virtu­  
ous, and well-meaning councils. And lastly let  
us provide in our constitution for its revision at  
stated periods. What these periods should he na­  
ture hcrselt indicates. By the European tables  
ol mortality, of the adults living at any ono mo­  
ment ol time, a majority will be dead in about 19  
years. At the end of that period then a new ma­  
jority is come into place; or in other words a new  
generation. Each generation is as independent  
of the one preceding, as that was of all which had  
gone before. has then, like them, a night to  
  
cnoose tor iiselt the form of government it believes  
most promotive of its own happiness: consequently  
to accommodate to the circumstances in which it  
finds itself that received from its predecessors; and  
it is for the peace and good of mankind that a so­  
lemn opportunity of doing this every 19 or *20  
years, should be provided by the constitution ; so  
that it may he handed on, with periodical repairs,  
from generation to generation to the end of time,  
if any thing human can so long endure. It is  
now 40 years since the constitution of Virginia  
was formed. The same tables inform us that  
within that period, two thirds of the adults then  
living are now dead. Have then the remaining  
third, even if they had the wish, the right to hold  
in obedience to their will, and to laws heretofore  
made by them, the other two thirds who with them­  
selves compose the present mass of adults ? If  
they have not, who has? The dead? But the  
dead have no rights. They are nothing; and no­  
thing cannot own something. Where there is no  
substance there can be no accident. This cor­  
poreal globe, every thing upon it, belongs to its  
present corporeal inhabitants,during their genera­  
tion. 1 hey alone have a right todircct what b» the  
concern of thomsclvcs alone, and to declare the  
law of that direction: and this declaration can on­  
ly be made by their majority. That majority then  
has a, right to depute representatives to a Conven­  
tion, and to make the Constitution what they tkink  
will be best for themselves. But how collect their  
voice? This is the real difficulty. If invited by  
private authority to county or district meetings,  
these divisions are so large that few will attend ;  
I and their voice, will be imperfectly,! or falsely pro­  
j nounced. Here then would be one of the advan­  
tages of the ward—divisions I have proposed.  
I 1 ho Major oi every ward, on a question like the  
| present, would call his ward together, take the  
simple ol yea or nay of its numbers, convey these  
to the couuty court, who would hand on those of  
ail its wards to the proper general authority, and  
the voice of tho whole people v/^uld he thus fair­  
ly, freely, and peaceably expressed, discussed,  
decided by the common reason of the society. If  
this avenue he shut to the call of sufFerance, it will  
make itselt heard thro’ that of force, and wc shall  
go on, as other nations are doing, in the endless  
circle of oppression, rebellion, reformation;—and  
oppression, rebellion, reformation again, and soon  
forever.  
These, Sir, are my opinions of thfe governments  
wc see among men, and of the principles by  
which alone we may prevent our own from falling  
into the same dreadful track. I have given them  
at greater length than your letter called for. But  
1 cannot say things by halves; and I confide them  
to your honor, so to use them as to preserve ine  
from the gridiron of the public papers. If you  
shall approve an*, enforce them, as you have done  
that ot equal representation, they may do some  
good If not, keep them R&gt;yourself as the effu­  
sions of withered age, and useless time. I shall,  
with not the less truth, assure you of my great res­  
pect and consideration.

&quot;I am not among those who fear  
the people. They, and not the  
rich, are our dependence for con­  
tinued freedom; and, to preserve  
their independence, we must not  
let our rulers load us with perpe­  
tual debt; we must make our elec­  
tion between Economy and Lib­  
erty, or Profusion and Servitude.  
If we run into such debts as that,  
  
we must be taxed in our meat and  
in our drink, in our necessaries  
and in our comforts, in our labors  
and our amusements, for our call­  
ings and our creeds, as the peo­  
ple of England are, our people  
like them must come to labor 16  
hours in the 24, give the earnings  
of 15 of these to the government  
for their debts and daily expen­  
ses; and the 16th being insufficient  
to afford us bread, wc must live  
as they now do on oatmeal and  
potatoes; have no time to think,  
no means of calling the mismana­  
ges to account; but be glad to ob­  
tain subsistence by hiring our­  
selves to rivet the chains on the  
necks of our fellow sufferers. Our  
land holders too, like theirs, re­  
taining indeed the title and stew­  
ardship of estates called theirs,  
but held really in trust for the  
treasury, must wander, like theirs,  
in foreign countries, and be con­  
tented with penury, obscurity, ex­  
ile, and the glory of the nation.  
This example reads to us the sa­  
lutary lesson that private fortunes  
are destroyed by public, as well  
as by private extravagance. And  
this is the tendency of all human  
governments. A departure from  
principle in one instance, becomes  
a precedent for a 2d, that 2d for a  
3d, and so on till the bulk of soci­  
pty is reduced to be mere autom-  
  
I atons of misery, to have no sensi-  
  
suffering. Then begins indeed  
the bellum &#x27;omniurn in omnia,  
which some philosophers observ­  
ing to be general in this world,  
have mistaken it for the natural  
instead of the abusive state of  
  
man, and the fore horse of this  
frightful team is PUBLIC DEBT

train wretchedness &amp; oppression.&quot;

Momticbllo, July 12. 1816.  
Sir: I duly received your favor ol the 1st inst. with  
a copy of the letter on the calling oi a convention, on  
which you aie pleased to ark my opinion. I liavo not  
been in tho habit ol iny&lt;terious reserve on auy subject,  
nor of buttoning up my opinion* within my own dou­  
blet; on the contrary, while in publfc service especially,  
1 have thought the public entitled to frankness, and in­  
timately to know whom they employed—but 1 am now  
retired. I resign myself, #« a passenger with confi­  
dence to those el present at the helm, iud ask but lot  
rest, peave and good will. The question you propose  
on equal representation, has become a party one, in  
which I wish to take no public share; yet if it he asked  
for your own satisfaction only, and not to he quoted be­  
fore the public, I have no motive to withhold it, and the  
lees from you, as it coincides with your own. At tho  
im lb of our republic, I committed this opinion to the  
world in the draught of a constitution annexed to the  
Notes on Virginia in which a provision was inserted  
for a representation permanently equal. The infancy  
of Ihe subject at that moment, nod our inexperience of  
•rdf-government oceasior.&#x27;d gross departure* in that  
draught, from genuine republican canons. In truth, tlx.­  
abuscs of monarchy bad ro much tilled nil the space of  
political contemplation, that we im.igit.sd every tiling  
republican which was not monarchy; we had not yet  
penetrated to the mother principle, that governments  
are republican enly in pioportion aa they embody the  
will of their (s.ople and execute it. Hence,our first  
constitution* had really no leading principle in them,  
but *-xpcncnce and reflection have hut more and more  
confirmed me in the particular importance of the  
equal representation then proposed. On that point then  
1 am entirely in sentiment with your litters; ami only  
lament that a copyright of your pamphlet prevents their  
appearance in tho neivspipcrs, where alono they would  
be generally read, and produce general effect. The  
present vacancy too of other matter would giro them  
place in every paper and bring the question home to  
every man’s conscience.  
  
Rut inequality ofrepre. snfalion, in l»o:h hou*o« of our  
legislature, i* nut &#x27;hr only republican heresy in this first  
essay of our revolutionary patriots at funning a consti­  
tution; for, lei it bo agroeil that a government is repub­  
lican in proportion as cv&lt;*ry member composing it has  
his equal voice in the direction of its concerns, (not in­  
deed in person, which would be impracticable beyond  
the limits of a city,or small township) bin by represen­  
tative* chosen by himself, and responsible to him at  
short periods, and lot us bring to the test of this canon  
| every branch in our constitution.  
In the Legislature, the House of Representatives  
is rho*cn by less than half the people, and not at all in  
, proportion to those who do choose. The Senate are still  
&#x27; more disproportionate, and for long terms ol irresponsi­  
bility. in the Executive, tin* Governor is entiicly  
I independent of th&lt; choice of the people, and of their  
| confront; V.a couocti equally »o, nnd at best but a fifth  
] wheel to a waggon In the Judiciary, the Judges of tlio  
highest courts are dependent on none but themselves.  
In England, where Judges were named and re­  
mpveahle at the will of an hereditary Executive, from  
•slurb branch mo-t misrule was feared, and has flowed,  
it was n great point gained by fixing them for life, to  
n;*ke them independent of that Executive. Rut in a  
Government founded on Ihc public will, this principle  
| operates in an opposite direction, and against that will,  
i Tlmrc too they were still removable on a ronrurrenco  
of the Executive and legislative branches; but we  
j have made them independent of the nation itself; they  
I aro irremovable but by their own body tor the imbecility  
i of dotage. The Justices of the inferior courts are self­  
i chosen and for life, and perpetuate their own body in  
succession for ever, so that a faction once t&gt;osse*sing  
i&#x27;selfof the bench of a county can never hr 1,token up,  
! but hold their county in chains forever indl**oluble Yet  
there Justices are the real Executives well as Judiciary  
I in all r^r minor and most ordinary concern*: they tax us  
k» will; fill the office of Sheriff. *he niwt important of all  
Ihe executive officers ol the country; name nearly all  
our military lenders, which leaders, once nam*&lt;l, are  
removable hut by th*m*elvos, The Juries, our Judges  
of ail fact, and of law when they choose it, arc not se­  
lected by fho people, nor amenable. to them; they are  
chosen by an officer named by the court and Executive,  
fhosvn did I say? picked up by the Sheriff from the  
lounging* of the court-yard, after every thing respect  
i aide, has r-tfrr.d fiom it—where thi n is our republican­  
ism to lie found ? Not in our constitution&#x27; certainly,  
but merely In the spirit ol our people, that would oblige  
ev&lt;*n i despot to govern ns repuhlicanly; owing »o this  
spirit and to nothing in the form of our eorvditution, aM  
things have gon^ well. Rut this fac*, so triumphin&#x27;! v  
! inis-qnoted by the enemies ot reformation, i« not the  
fruit of out constitution, bill hs« prevailed in spite of it:  
our functionaries have done well,because generally hon­  
est men: it «ny were not *o, they feared to shew it.  
Rut it will be said, it is ca*ier to find fault than to  
amend them- I do not think their amendment so dilll­  
cult a* is pretended : only lay down true principle* and  
adhere to them inflexibly. Do not be frightened Into  
their surrender by the alarm* of the timid,or tin* croak­  
ing* of wealth against tho ascendancy of (lie people _  
If expedience be called for, appeal to that of our to or  
20 government* for -10 years, and show me whore the  
people have done half (he mischief in these 10 years,  
that a *ingle despot would have done in a single year;  
  
or, micw nere tun ine iiom urni n-peumns, (lie crime*  
an.l (lie punishment*, which have taken place in  
any single r ation, under kingly government during the  
same period.—Tho Imio foundation of republican gov­  
ermrnt, is the equal right of every citizen, in his person  
and nropeitv, and in llr ir management. Try by this a­  
a (alley, every provision of our constitution, and see if  
it hangs directly on the will of the people; reduce your  
Legislature to a convenient number for full, hut elder­  
ly discussion; let every man who fights or pays, exer­  
cise his just and equal right in their election; submit  
•hem to approbation or rejection at short intervals: Let  
the executive ho chosen in the same way, and for the  
same term, by those whose agent he is to he; and leave  
no screen of a council, behind which to skulk from re­  
sponsibility I» has been thought that ths people arc  
not competent elrrlors ol judges learrud in the law,  
but I do not know that this i* true; and il doubtful, we  
should follow principle; in this as in many other eler­  
tiors, they won! ) be guided by reputation, which would  
not err ottencr perhaps than the present mode ol ap­  
pointment. In on&quot; state of tho Union, at lead, it has  
been long tried, and with tho most satisfactory success.  
The judges of Connecticut have been chosen by the  
people every six months, for nearly two centuries, arid  
t helioTo there has hardly over been an instance of  
change; so pov. erhil Is the emb of incessant responsi­  
bility. ff prejudice, however, derived from a monar­  
chical institution, Is still to prevail against the vital  
elective principle of our own, and if the existing ex­

These ward*, called townships, in New England, are  
&#x27;the vital principle of their governments, and have prov­  
ed themselves the wisest invention ever devised by (lie  
wit of man, lor the perfect exerci*. ol self-government,  
and for its preservation. We should thus marshal our  
government into—I. The General Federal Kepuldir,  
lor all concerns foreign and federal. 2. That of die  
Slat* for what relates to our citizens exclusively, ft.  
Tfie county republics for the duties and concerns ot  
I I lie county; and, 4. The Word Republics, for the  
small, and yet numerous and interesting concerns of  
the uelghb&#x27;diood: and in government, as well as in  
every other business of life, it is by division and subdl  
vision of dudes alone, that all matters, great and small,  
can lie mnnagrd to perfection, and The whole i* cement­

The sum of these amendments aro—1. General Suf­  
frage 2. Equal representation In the legislature. 2  
An Executive chosen by the people. 4. Judges dec

by tlie republicanism of our constitution, ns well ns hy  
the spirit of the people : and it is to nourish and per­  
petuate that spirit. I am not amor.g those who fear the  
people. They, and not the rich, are our dependence  
for continued Ireedom; and to preserve their ind-pen  
dr nee, wc must not let our rulers load us with per|»-tuat

and liberty, ov projution and lervitude If we vun in­

tented with penury, obscurity, exile and tbe glory ol  
the nation. This example reads to u* the salutary les­  
son, that private fortunes ere destroyed by public, as  
wsll as private extravagance. And this is tin- tenden­  
cy of sll human governments. A departure from prin­  
ciple in one instance, becomes a p-eeedi-nt for a 2d. that  
2d for a ltd. and so on, till the hulk of the society i- r-&#x27;  
■lured to be the mere automaton* of mi ery, to have no  
sensibility left but for sinning and cuff.-,(rig. Then be  
gin*, indeed, the helium omnium in omr.i t, which some  
philosophers, observing to he »o general in this world,  
have mistaken it for the natural, in*laail of the abusive  
state of man; and the fore-horse of this (rightful team  
is Public Debt. Taxation follow* that, and in its train  
wretchedress and oppression.  
Some men look at constitution* with sanctimonious  
reverence, and deem them, like the ark ot the Covo­  
n&#x27;int, too sacred to be touched They a«rr&#x27;hn to the  
men of a preceding age, a wisdom more than human,  
and suppose what they did to he beyond a endmont. I  
knew that nge well; I belonged to it and labored with  
if—it deserved well of its country. It was - pry like  
the present, but without the experience of the present;  
ami 40 year* experience in government is worth a cen­  
tury of book-reading; and (his they would say th--m­  
selves, were tlipy to rise from the dead. I am certain­  
ly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in  
laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections  
had better be borne with; because, when once known,  
we accommodate ourselves to them and find practical  
, means of cor.ccling their ill effect; hut I know a1«o  
that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the  
progress of the human mind. As that heroines more  
developed, tnoro enlightened, and new di*coveri** are  
inado, new truth* disclosed, and manners and opinion*  
’ change with the change of circumstance*, institutions  
; mu** advance also, ami keep pace with the times. We  
might ns well require a man to wear still the coat which  
, fitted him when n hoy, as civilized society to remain  
; ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestor-*.—  
It is this preposterous H a which ha* lately deluged  
Europe in blood. Their monarch*, Insn-ad of wisely  
yielding to the gradual change* of circumstances, of fa­  
vouring progressive accommodation to progressive im­  
1 provemnnt. have clung to old abuse*, in&#x27;renched them­  
1 selves behind steady habit*, and obliged their subject* to  
J seek through blood and violence,rash and ruinous inno  
vation which, had they been referred to the peaceful de­  
liberations, and collected wisdom of the nation, would  
have been put in*o acceptable and salutary form*—l.cr  
I ns follow no such example, nor weakly bell,-vo that  
j one generation is not a* capable as another of taking  
&#x27; care of itself, and of ordering its own aff.iir*. I.et ti«,  
j ns our *btor states have done, av dl ourselves of our rca  
( son ami experience to correct the erode e*«By* of our  
i first and Inexperienced, allho* wise, virtuous, and welt  
j meaning councils And lastly, let us provide in onr  
i constitution for it* revision at stated period*. H&#x27;bat these  
periods should be, nature herself indicate*. Hy the  
European tallies of mortality, of the adult* living at  
any one inoin nt of lime, a majority will he dead in  
about nineteen years; at the end of that period a  
new majority is com into (•&#x27;.ice : or in other word*, a  
new generation. Each generation is as independent ot  
the one. preceding, as that whch had gone before. It  
! ha* then, like them, a right to choose fur if*elf die form  
  
oi government u neucves mojt promotive ol its own  
happine**, consequently to accommodate to ih&lt;* circum­  
stances in which it finds itself that received from it*  
predecessors; and i» i* for tho peace -*nd good of man­  
kind that a solemn npppoi (unity, of doing this every 1f)  
or 20 years, should be provided by Hie constitution ; so  
that it may ho handed on, with periodical repair*, from  
generation to generation fo tho end of time, if any  
thing human ran so Ion? endure. It i« now foity years  
since *lie Constitution of Virginia was formed; the ta­  
bles inform tr*tliat, within that period,two-thirds of tb&gt;­  
adult* then living are now dead Have then tlm re­  
maining third, even if they hid the widi, tlm right *n  
hold in obedience to their will, and to laws heretofore  
mule by Ihetn, the other two thirds who, with them­  
selves, compose tho present mt«« of adults? If th’v  
have not, who has? The dead? hut the dpad have no  
rights, they, are nothing; and nothing cannot own “ome­  
thing. Where thcro Is no substance, there ran b« no  
accident.—This corporeal gto’&gt;e, and ev«ry thing upon  
it, belongs to its present corporeal Inhabitant*, during  
their generation. They alone have a right to direct  
wha* is the concern of themselves alone, and to declare  
the law of that direction, am! this declaration can only  
be made by their majority; tint majority then ha* a  
right to depute representatives lo a Convention, and to  
mako tho Constitution what they think will be best for  
thrms«dve*. But how rollert their voice? This is the  
real difficulty. If invited try private authority to coun­  
ty or district inertings, these divisions are so large that  
few will attend, ami their voire will be. imperfectly, or  
fahely pronounced. Here then would be one of tire  
advantages ol the ward divisions I have proposed The  
mayor of every ward, on a que*tion like the. present,  
would call his ward together, take the simple Yea or  
Nay of its members, convey the«o to the couniv court,  
who would hand on those of all its wards lo tho proper  
general authority—and the voice of Iho whole people  
would be thus fairly, fully, and peaceably esnveased,  
discussed and decided by tiio common rea«on of the #o­  
ci- ty. If this Avenue be shut to tho call of sufleianee  
it will make itself heard thro* that of force, and we eluij  
go on as other nation* are doing, In the endless circle  
of oppression, rebellion, reformation: and oppression, re­  
bellion. reformation again, and so on for over.  
The«e, Mir, are roy opinion- of the government* wi&gt;  
I *i« among men. and of tha principle* by which alon*  
I v&#x27;0 may prevent our own from falling info the saint

It has been thought that the people are not compe-  
tent electors of Judges, learned in the law. But I  
do not know that this is true, and if doubtful, we  
should follow principle. In this, as in many other  
elections, they would be guided by reputation, which  
would not err oftener, perhaps, than the present mode  
of appointment. In one state at least it has been  
long tried, and with the most satisfactory success.  
The Judges of Connecticut have been chosen by the  
people every six months, for nearly two centuries,

mortal pen of THOMAS JEFFERSON :--

let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We  
‘nust make our selection between economy and  
ilihcrty, or profusion and servitude. If we run

ing insufficient to afibrd us bread, we must live  
as they now do, on oatmeal and potatoes ; have  
no time to think, no means of calling the mana­  
gers to account ; but be glad to obtain subsis.  
tence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on

of estates ealled theirs, but really in trust for  
the treasury. must wander, like theirs, in foreign  
countries, and be contented with penury, obscu­  
rity, and the glory of the nation. This exam­  
ple reads to the salutary lesson that private for­  
tunes are destroyed by public as well as by pri­  
vate extravagance, And this is the tendency of  
all human governments. A departure from  
principle in one instance, becomes a precedent  
for a second; that sccond for a third; and so on  
the bulk of soclety is reduced to be mere auto­

truth: &#x27;  
&quot;Statute Law is the express written

constitution and legislature, that statutes  
can be (binding) only when, furt, they are  
executed according to the (prescribed)  
lornis, and secondly, when they are strict­

For the constitution being the funda­

“Tt is thought that the people are not  
competent electors of judges Le arned in  
the law. But I do not know that this is  
trae, and if doubtful, we should follow  
principle. In this, as in many other elec-  
tions, they would be guided by reputation,  
which would not err oftener, perhaps, than  
the present m de of appointment. In one  
state of the Union, at least, it has been  
long tried, and with the most satisfactory  
success. The judges of Connecticut have  
been chosen by the people every six  
months, for nearly two centuries, and [ be-  
lieve there has hardly ever been an in-  
  
stance of change, so powerful is the curb of  
  
incessant resp ynsibility, If prejudice, how-  
ever, derived from a monarchical institu-  
tion, is still to prevail against the vital elec-  
tive principle of our own; and if the ex-  
isting example among ourselves of periodi-  
cal election of judges by the people, be  
mistrusted, let us at least not adopt the  
evil and reject the good of the English  
precedent. Let us retain a moveability on  
the concurrence of the Executive and Le-  
gislative branches, and nomination by the  
Executive alone. To give it to the Legis-  
lature, as we do, is a violation of the prin-

&quot;It has been thought that the people are not competent  
electors of judges fearned in the late. But I do not know  
that this is true, and, if doubtful, we should follow princt  
ple. In this, as in many other elections, they would be  
guided by reputation, which would not err oftener perhaps,  
than the present mode of appointment. In one State of the  
Union, at least, it has been long tried, and with the most  
satistactory success. The judges of Connecticut have been  
chosen by the people every six months, for nearly two cen­  
turies, and I believe there has hardly ever been an instance  
of change; so powerful is the curb of incessant responsy,  
bility. If prejudice, however, derived from a monarchical  
institution, is still to prevail against the vital clective prin  
ciple of our own, and if the existing example among ours  
selves of pertodical clection of judges by the people be  
suill mistrusted, lef us at least not adopt the evil and reyect  
the cood, of the English precedent, let us retain a mova­  
bility on the concurrence of the Eaecutive and Lestpative  
branches, and nomination by the Executive alone. Nom  
nation to office is an Executive function. To give it to the  
Legislature, as we do, is a violation of the principle of the  
separation of powers. It swerves the Mesibers from cer  
recthess by temptations to intrigue for office themselves,  
and to a corrupt barter of votes; and destroys responsibll  
ity by dividing it among a multitude. By leaving nomina  
tion in its proper place among Executive fanctions, the  
 principle of the distribution of power is preserved, and re­  
sponsibility weighs with its heaviest force on a single  
head.&quot;

Do not be frightened mt&lt;vtheir aurrender by  
the alarms of the timid, or the eroakings of wealth

foundation of republican sovernment ia the equal  
right of every citizen in hi* person and property,

who fear the people. They, and not the rich, are  
our dependence for continued freedom.  
&quot;Some men ascribe to the men of the preceding  
age, a wisdom more than human; and suppose what  
they did to be beyond amendment. 1 knew that  
age well?I belonged to it, and labored with it. It  
deserved well of its country. It was very like the  
present, but without the experience of the present;  
and forty yeats of experience in government is worth  
a century of book reading; and this they would say  
themselves were they to rise from the dead. I am  
certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried  
changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate  
imperfections had better be borne with; because,  
when once known, we accommodate ourselves  
to them, and find practical means of correcting their  
ill effects. But I know, also, that laws and institutions  
must go hand in hand with the progress of the  
human mind. As that becomes more developed,  
more enlightened; a* new discoveries ure made, new  
truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change  
with the change of circumstances, institutions must  
advance also, and keep pace with the times. We

Let us follow no such examples, nor weakly believe

Let us avail ourselves of our reason and experience

The only objection urged against amending our  
State Conktitution is, that the fundamental law of  
the land &quot;should not be changed for light aod tri  
vial causes,&quot; and the danger of submitting to the  
judgment of our fellow-citizens the imperfections  
of an instrument devised by the wisdom of our  
forefathers. We will here introduce the language  
of Jefferson as an answer to such objections :  
&quot;Some ever look at constitutions with  
sanctimonious reverence, and deem  
them, like the ark of the covenant, too  
sacred to be touched. They ascribe  
to tho men of the pieceding ago a wis-  
dqm more than human, and suppose  
what they did to be beyond amend  
ment. I know that age well ; I belong  
ed to it, and labored in it. It deserved  
well of its country. It was very much  
ike the present, but without the expe  
rience of the present, and forty years  
at experience in government is worth  
century oi book reading; and this  
they would say themselves, were they  
to rise from the dead. 1 am certainly  
not an advocate for frequent and un  
tried changes inlaws and constitutions.  
But I know, also, that laws and institu­  
tions must go hand in hand with thejpro-  
gress of the human mind. As thru be­  
comes more developed, more enlight  
ened, as new discoveries are made,  
new truths disclosed, and manners, and  
opinions change with the change of  
circumstances, institutions must ad­  
vance also, and keep pace with the  
times. We might as well require a man  
to wear still the coat which fitted him  
when a boy, as civilized society to re­  
main ever under the regimen of their  
barbarous ancestors. It is this prepos  
terous idea which has lately deluged  
Europe in blood. Let us follow no  
such examples, nor weakly believe that  
one generation is not as capable as  
another of taking care of itself, and of  
ordering its own affairs. Let us as our  
sister States have done, avail ourselves  
of our reason and experience, to cor­  
rect the crude essays oi our first and  
unexperienced, although wise, virtuous,  
and well meaning councils.

needs the most mature consideration of our  
wisest statesmen, I again propose, as not out of  
place at the present time, to give the plan cf  
Mr. Jefferson. In the same letter to Mr. Kor­  
chival before alluded to, he says, (alluding to  
these Courts): “But it will be said it is easier to  
find fault than to amend them. I do not think  
their amendment so difficultas pretended. But  
follow principle and the knot unties itself Di­  
vide the counties into wards of such size as that  
every citizen can attend when called on and act  
in person. Ascribe to these the government of  
their wards in ail things relating to themselves  
exclusively. A justice chosen by themselves,  
in each a constable, a military company, a pa­  
trol, a school, the care of their own poor, their  
own portion of the public roads, the choice of  
one or more jurors to serve in some court, and  
the delivery, in their own wards, of their own  
votes for all elective officers of higher sphere  
will relieve the county administration of nearly  
all its business, will have it better done, and by  
making every citizen an active member of the  
government, and in the offices nearest and most  
interesting to him, will attach him by bis strong­  
est feeling to lheindepender.ee of his coun*y,  
and its Republican Constitution. J he Justices  
thus chosen by every ward would constitute ilia  
  
County Court, would do us judiciary business,  
direct roads and bridges, levy County and poor  
rates, and administer all the matters of common  
interest to the whole County. These wards,  
called townships, in New England, are the vital&#x27;  
principle of tjie (iovernment, and have proved  
themselves the wisest invention ever devised by  
the wit of matt for the perfect exercise of self­  
government and for its preservation. We should  
then marshal ottr government into—first, the  
general Federal Republic, foreign and Federal;  
second, that of the State, for what relates to our  
own citizens exclusively ; third, the county re­  
publics for the duties and concerns of the county;  
and fourth, the Ward republics for the small yot  
numerous and interesting concerns of the neigh­  
borhood. And in government, as well as in  
every business of life, it is by division and sub­  
division of the duties alone that all matters, great  
and small, can be managed to perfection. And  
the whole is secured by giving to every citizen,  
personally, apart in the administration ofpublio  
affairs.:

“Where, then, is our republicanism to be  
found? Not in our Constitution, certainly, but  
merely in the spirit of our people. That would  
oblige’even a despot to govern us republican]}-.  
Owing to this spirit, and to nothing in the form  
of our Constitution, all thines have gone well.—  
But this fact so triumphantly misquoted by the  
enemies of reformation, is not the fruit of our  
Constitution, but has prevailed in spile of it.—  
But it will be said, it is easier to find faults than  
to amend them. I do not think their amend­  
ment is so difficult as is pretended. Only lay  
down the principles, and adhere in flexibly to them.  
Do not be frightened into their surrender by the  
alarms of the timid and the croaking.s of wealth,  
against the ascendency of the people. If experi­  
ence be called for, appeal to that of our fifteen or  
twenty governments for forty years, and show  
me where the people have done half the mischief  
in those forty years, that a single despot would  
have done in a single year. The true founda­  
tion of republican government is the equal right  
of every citizen in his person ami property, and  
in their management. Try by this, as a tally,  
every provision of our Constitution, and see it it  
hangs directly on the will of the people. Re­  
duce your legislature to a convenient number  
for full and orderly discussion, bet every man  
who fights or pavs, exercise his just and equal  
right in their election. Let the executive be  
chosen in the same way ami tor the same period.  
It is thought that the people are not competent  
electors of Judges harmed in law. But I do not  
know that this is true, and if doubtful we should  
follow principle In this, as in many other elec,  
tions, they would be guided by reputation.which  
would not err oftener. perhaps, than the pres-mi  
mode of appointment. In one State of tin  
Union, at least, it has been long tried, and with  
the most satisfactory success. The Judges ol  
Connecticut have been chosen by the people  
every six months, for nearly two centuries, ami  
I believe there has hardly ever been an in­  
stance of change, so powerful has been _ the  
curb of incessant responsibility. If prejudice,  
however, derived from a monarchical institution,  
is still to prevail against the vital elective prin­  
ciple of our own, and it&#x27;the existing example a­  
mong ourselves of periodical election of Judges  
by the people be mistrusted, let us at least noi  
adopt the evil, and reject the good of the En­  
glish precedent. Let us retain a moveability  
on the concurrence of the executive and legisla­  
tive branches, and nomination by the executive  
alone. To give it to the legislature, as we do,  
is a violation of the separation of powers.”  
Thus spoke the sage of Mohtieello. The  
words of wisdom hang upon his lips. “Only­  
lay down true principles and adhere to them in­  
flexibly. Do not be frightened into their sur­  
render by the alarms of the timid, or the croak­

rights. Hear him:  
&quot;At the birth of our republic, 1 coniniitt&lt; 1 that &lt;&gt;pm- j  
ion to the world, in the ilraiight of a constitution an­  
nexed to the Notes on Virginia, in which n provision was 1  
inserted fur a representation permanentlv equal. The  
infancy of the subject at that moment, and our inexpe- I  
rience of self-government, occasioned gross departures  
in that draught from genuine republican canons, in  
truth, the abuses of monarchy had so much filled all the  
q&gt;are of political contemplation, that wo imagined everv  
thing republican which was not monarchy. We had not  
yet penetrated to the mother principle, that &#x27;govern- I  
Lnonts are republican only iu proportion as they ?mlsxly !  
the will of the people, and execute it.&#x27; Hence* our fir*t &#x27;  
^institutions had really no leading principle in them, j  
Hut experience and reflection have but more and more j  
&#x27;ontirnied me iu the particulnr imporiauce of the equal (  
representation then proposed.  
&quot; Hut inequality of representation in both Houses of ;  
inir legislature, is not the only republican heresy in this j  
first essay of our revolutionary patriots at forming a ;  
constitution. For let it be agreod that a government is ;  
republican in projiortion as every member eomjxising it |  
lias his equal voice in the direction of its concerns, (not !  
indeed iu person, which would l&gt;e impracticable beyond i  
the limits of a citv, or small township, but) bv represeii- ,  
tatives eho&amp;en bv himself, and responsible to him at ]  
?diort periods, and let us bring ?o the test ol this canon J  
every branch of our constitution.  
&quot;In the legislature, the House of Represent:, ves is  
chosen by less than half the people, and not at &#x27;11 in j  
projmrtioii to those who do choose. The Senate arc Mill  
more disproportionate, and for long terms of irrespoiisi  
bilitv.  
&#x27;? \Vhere then is our republicanism to lie found ? Xot  
in our constitution Certainlv, but merely in the spirit of  
our people. That would oblige even a despot to govern  
us republicanly. Owing to this spirit, and to nothing iu  
the form of our constitution, all things have gone well.  
Hut this fact, m&gt; triumphantly misquoted by the enemies  
of reformation, is not the fruit of our constitution, hut  
has prevailed in spite of it. Our functionaries have done  
well, because generally honest men. ll any were not,  
they feared to shew it.  
&quot; Hut it will he said, it is easier to find faults than to  
amend them. 1 do not think their amendment so diffi­  
cult as is pretended. Only lay down true principles, and  
adhere to then: inflexibly. Do not be frightened into

Jefferson, Madison, Macon, Jackson, Clay, and  
others of our early patriots, as well as Bell, Ca­  
ruthers, Campbell, Gentry and others, now upon the  
stage of action, and of our own State, have favored  
amendments to the Federal Constitution, many of  
whom have advocated the very propositions to which  
such violent opposition is now made merely because  
tey are s ipported by Gov. Johnson.  
We propose no argument apan these question at  
time, but merely to furnish a statement of the

them in their folly.

Some men look at Constitutions with  
mious reverence, and deem them like the ark of the  
covenant, too sacred to be touched. They ascribe  
to men of the preceding age a wisdom more than  
human, and suppose what they did to be beyond  
amendment. I knew that age well. I belonged to  
it and labored with it. It deserved well of its  
country. It was very like the present, but without  
the experience of the present; and forty years expe­  
rience in government is worth a century of book-reading,  
and this they would say themselves, were they to  
rise from the dead. I am certainly not an advocate  
for frequent and untried changes in laws and con­

accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical

&quot; The organization of our county admin­  
istrations may be thought more difficult.  
But follow principle, and the knot unties  
itself. Divide the counties into wards of  
such size as that eveiy citizen can attend  
when called on and act in person. Ascribe  
to them the government of their wards in  
all things relating to themselves exclusively.  
A justice chosen by themselves in each, a  
constable, a military company, a patrol, a  
school, the care of their own poor, their  
own portion of the public roads, the choice  
of jurors, &amp;c, will relieve the county ad­  
ministration of nearly all its busi­  
ness, will lave it better done, and  
by making every citizen an active  
. member of the government, and in the  
affairs nearest and most interesting to him  
will attach him by his strongest feelings to*  
the independence of his country and its re­  
publican constitution. * * * These  
wards, called townships in New England,  
are the vital principle of their governments,  
and have proved themselves the wisest in­  
vention ever devised by the wit of man for  
the perfect exercise of self-government  
and for its preservation. We should  
thus marshal our government into,  
Ist, the general federal republic for all  
concerns foreign and federal; 2d,  
that of the statu lor what relates to our  
own citizens exclusively ; 3d, the county  
republics for the duties and concerns of the  
county, and 4th, the ward republics for the  
small and yet numerous and interesting  
concerns of tho neighborhood; and in gov­  
ernment as well as in every other business  
of life, it is by division and subdivision of  
duties alone, that all matters, great and  
small, can be managed to perfection. And  
the whole is cemented by giving to every  
citizen personally a part in the administra­  
tion of the public affairs.

with Dorpti ual didtli. We must make our

profusion and servi.ude. If we run into

I quote again from Thomas

function. To give it to the legis­

the principle of the separation of

executive functions, the principle  
of the distribution of power is pre­

Jefferson said : &quot;I am not among those  
who fear the people. They , and not the  
rich , are our dependence for continued  
freedom. And to preserve their inde­  
pendence , we must not let our rulers  
load us with perpetual debt. We must  
make our selection between economy  
and liberty , or profusion and servitude.  
If we run into such debts as that , we  
must be taxetl in our meat and in our  
drink , in our necessaries and our com-  
forls in our labors and our amuse­  
ments , for our callings and our creeds ,  
as the people of England are. our people  
ple , like them , must come to labor six­  
teen hours in the twenty-four , jrive the  
earnings of fifteen of these to the gov­  
ernment for their debts and daily ex­  
penses , and the sixteenth being suf­  
ficient to afford us bread , we must live  
as I hey now do. on oatmeal and pota­

to call the mismanagers to account :

the revision of the Virginia Constitution

&quot;The organization of our county administration  
may be thought difficult. But follow principle and  
the knot unties itself. Divide the counties into wards  
of such size as that overy citizen can attend, when  
called on, and act in person. Ascribe to them the  
Government of their wards in all things relating to  
themselves exclusively. A justioe, chosen by them­  
selves, in each, a constable, a military company,  
a patrol, a school, the care of their own  
poor, their own portion of the public roads,  
the choice of one or more jurors to serve in some  
court, and the delivery, within their own wards, of  
their own votes for all elective offioers of higher  
sphere, will relieve the county administration of  
nearly all its business, will have it better done, and  
by making every citizen an acting member of the  
Government, and in the office nearest and most in­
