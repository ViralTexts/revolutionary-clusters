o Mr. Jennison. This is a young man: indeed much too young, (as are all the Tutors,) for the Place he occupies. Before he took his second degree, which was last Commencement, he was chosen a Tutor, of mathematics, in which he betray’d his Ignorance often. In hearing the Sophimores recite in Geography, he had occasion to speak, of the alteration of the Style by Pope Gregory. But instead of giving them an account of the fact, and the reasons, for which it was done; he only said (very wittily) I don’t know how it happened, but there have been eleven days knocked in the head. Several other Instances equally absurd are told of him. Last fall, he changed departments with Mr. Reed, and took up the Greek. His own Class, the Freshmen, were the first that laugh’d at him in that: for he gave one of them the word γυνη to parse, it was said right, but he was corrected by the Tutor, who said the genitive Case was της γυνης. He has improved since that, but still makes frequent mistakes. It is certainly wrong that the Tutors should so often be changed, and be so young as they are. It would be better to chuse a person immediately after he has taken his degree, than as they do: because, when a youth leaves College, he is obliged to turn his attention to other Studies, and forgets a great deal, of what he studied at College: whereas when he has lately graduated, he has all fresh in his mind. The Dr. affects a great deal of popularity in his Class, and with the help of the late disagreement between the Classes he has pretty well succeeded; but he does not seem to care, what the other Classes think of him.

Our Tutor, gave us this morning, a most extraordinary, construction of a passage in Homer. Abbot 1st. was beginning to construe, the 181st. line of the 6th Book.   
  
πρόσθε λέων, ο̈πισθεν δὲ δράκων, μέσση δέ χίμαιρα  
  
He said, a Lion, before, but the Dr. corrected him, by saying it meant superior to a Lion; Abbot immediately took the hint, and made it, superior to a Lion, inferior to a Dragon, and equal to a wild boar.

s some things. We had after Prayers a Class meeting, about making a present to our Tutor. It is customary at the end of the freshman year to make a present to the Tutor of the Class: but it has been delay’d by ours to the present Time, and many would still delay it, and lay it wholly aside. The Custom, I think is a bad, one, because, it creates partialities in a Tutor, because it increases the distinction between the wealthy, and the poor Scholars, because it makes the Tutor in some measure dependent upon his Class, and because to many that Subscribe it is a considerable expence but the Salaries of the Tutors, being so low,   
  
and it having been for many years an universal custom, I am sorry to see our Class so behind hand, and several, who could well afford it, and have really subscribed, meanly endeavouring, to put off the matter from Quarter to Quarter, till they leave College.

ing from 1st. of Corinthians. I. 30. But of him are ye, in Christ Jesus, who of God, is made unto us, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption. I do not remember all his arguments; What I did remember, was not so pleasing to me, as his afternoon, discourse, which was from Acts. XI. 26. And the disciples, were called Christians, first in Antioch. This was, I thought, a very good one; he recommended to his hearers, to consider themselves, as Christians and not particularly belonging to any sect. He introduced, very properly, an excellent passage from Scripture, against Schisms. I: Cor: III. 4,5. For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul; and who is Apollos, but ministers, by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? His argument was, if a particular attachment, to such men as Paul, and Apollos, was reproved in the Scriptures, how much then must particular sects at this day, or enthusiasm for the opinions of men, much inferior to Paul or Apollos, be displeasing to God.

We recite this week in Terence, and Caesar to Mr. James. This is the tutor of the oldest standing in College. He is very well ac­quainted with the branch he has undertaken, and Persons, that are not Students, say that he is much of a Gentleman. But it seems almost to be a maxim among the Governors of the College, to treat the Students pretty much like brute Beasts. There is an important air, and a haughty look, that, every Person, belonging to the government, (Mr. Williams excepted) assumes, which indeed it is hard for me to submit to. But it may be of use to me, as it mortifies my Vanity, and if any thing, in the world, can teach me humility, it will be, to see myself subjected to the commands of a Person, that I must despise.  
Mr. James is also accused of having many Partialities, and carrying them to very great length and moreover, that those partialities do not arise from any superior talents or Virtues, in the Student, but from closer, and more interested motives. There are some in our Class with whom, he has been peculiarly severe, and some he has shown more favour, than any Tutor ought to show to a Student. I wish not his favour, as he might prize it too high, and I fear not his Severity, which he can never display, if I do my Duty.

We finished the Andria of Terence this morning. The Class began it last Feby. I went through it at Haverhill in 3 Evenings, however it must be said, here they Study it only 1 week in 4, and that week, only 4 mornings, but even in that way, it has taken 12 lessons to go through this one play. At 11. we had a Lecture from Mr. Williams, upon hydrostatics. He keeps exceeding close to Gravesande’s. Definitions, experiments; nearly all the same. We recite afternoons, the Latin Week, in Caesar, but I have had nothing to say this Week: the Class is so numerous, that he, cannot hear more than one half of them recite at once, and so he takes turns. Mr. I. Smith and Dr. Welch, were here in the afternoon. There was a Concert, by a number of Performers from Boston; Several of the Ladies and Gentlemen, of the Town were pre

Bridge, and Little are two of the best Scholars in our Class, and moreover very clever fellows. Sever has a strong natural genious, and genuine Wit. But his morals are loose, and he is not by any means fond of studying.

We recite this week to Mr. Hale, in Locke. This is upon the whole, the most unpopular Tutor in College. He is hated even by his own Class. He is reputed to be, very ill natured, and severe in his Punishments. He proposes leaving College, at Commencement, and I believe, there is not an individual among the Students, who is not very well pleased with it. One of my Class Mates, said the other day, “I do not believe it yet, it is too good news to be true.” Such are the Sentiments of all the Students with Respect to him.

We recite this week to our own Tutor Mr. Reed, in Gravesande’s experimental Philosophy. This gentleman, is not much more Popular, than the rest of the Tutors; he is said to be prejudiced, and very vindictive. He is liked in general by the Class, however; and this may be a Reason why I have not heard, as much said against him, as against the others.

23d.  
  
  
We could not recite this morning, because Mr. Reed, was not in at prayers. This morning a number of the Seniors were sent for, by the President, to go to his House at 8 o’clock. They went, and the parts were distributed thus. Thompson+ English Oration A:M: Champlin Latin Oration A:M: Fowle and Gardner 2d. each a Poem. Blake English and Andrews+ 1st. Latin Oration’s P.M. Harris, Dwight+, Hubbard×, and Parker+ a Conference, Bigelow and Crosby+, Lowell and Taylor, Loring and Sullivan Forensics. Lincoln and Warland, a Greek dialogue, Bradford, Norton, Simpkins+, and Wyeth, Respondents in Syllogistics, and all the rest opponents to the same. These Syllogistics, are very much despised by the scholars, and no attention seems to be paid to them by the Company at Commencement. The scholars in general think that the Government, in giving them those Parts write on their foreheads DUNCE in capital Letters. Notwithstanding this some of the most learned men, in the Country, had syllogistics, when they graduated here. The good Parts, as they are called, are more numerous this year, than they ever have been. Before this there has been only one English, and one Latin Oration, and no Poems. It is a doubt, whether they intend, to establish this as a Precedent or whether it is only a distinguished favour, to the present Class who pretend to be the best Class for learning, and genius that ever graduated here. It is said, that the Parts have been exceedingly well distributed; and all the College, are pleased. There is only one person, who is said to have a part he did not deserve×, and one or two are mentioned, as deserving others than Syllogistics. However that may be, the syllogists all got together this Evening, and drank, till not one of them could stand strait, or was sensible of what he did. A little after 9 they sallied out, and for a Quarter of an hour made such a noise, as might be heard, at a mile distant. I was then up in Freeman’s chamber, upon a certain affair, he was informing me of. The Tutors went out, and after a short time, perswaded them to disperse. Mr. Reed had two squares of his Windows broke.  
  
  
  
  
  
Thomas W. Thompson, with whom JQA was to study law in Newburyport the following year, was later a New Hampshire lawyer, U.S. representative, 1805–1807, and senator, 1814–1817 (Biog. Dir. Cong.Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774-1949, Washington, 1950.). The names with plus signs, which were placed above the names in the MS, were all members of the A.B. Club (entry for 29 May, below).

It is feared that some bad consequences, will ensue, from the high-go, of the Syllogists last evening. Borland, it seems, was the most active of them all; he collar’d Mr. Reed, and threw an handful of gravel, in his Face, and was rather disrespectful to Mr. James; He went this morning to the former, to make an apology for his Conduct, but was told, it could not be received, as the matter was already laid before the Government. Thus those fellows play the Tyrants here; they have no regard, no allowances for youth, and Circumstances; they go out, when they are almost certain of being insulted, and then bring the scholar, for a crime of which he knew nothing, under public censure. They cannot with any face, say that a scholar ought to be so severely punished for depriving himself of his Senses. For there are here, in College persons, who have seen Mr. Reed, as much much intoxicated, as Borland was yesterday; and behaving quite as ill. But Compassion is too great a Virtue, ever to be admitted into the breast of a Tutor, here. It is supposed however that Borland’s punishment will not be very severe, because it requires an unanimous Vote among the Governors of the College to punish a Student, and they are said to be at such Variance one with the other, that they can very seldom all agree.  
  
  
  
  
  
Samuel Borland, son of John Borland, of Boston and Tory Row, Cambridge, the short-lived loyalist (d. 1775) (Edward Doubleday Harris, “The Vassalls of New England,” NEHGR,New England Historical and Genealogical Register. 17:120 [April 1863]; Paige, Hist. of Cambridge, Mass.,Lucius R. Paige, History of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1630-1877. With a Genealogical Register, Boston and New York, 1877. Supplement and Index..., by Mary I.

25th.

k he is a jot better than the Rest: Reed said, as I have heard that he should not have complained of any other scholar, but Borland, had always treated him disrespectfully. This makes the blame in the Tutor much greater, for it displays, a partiality, which every governor of the University ought to be free from.

I have heard the substance of one Sermon, with a Variety of texts ever since I have been, here; it is with him, as with most of the preachers I have heard: there is one favourite point, (often self evident) which they labour, to prove, continually; and beyond which they seldom, have much to say.

 is the only day in the year, in which the Student here is left at his Liberty to do whatever he pleases; and it is most frequently the Case, as it has been this day, that one Party is playing in the yard from 8 in the morning to prayer time in the afternoon: Most of the scholars however go out of Town, on this day. There is a custom among the scholars here, which some of the Classes follow, and others do not. It is choosing a governor and Lieutenant governor, for the Class. They commonly take some rich fellow, who can treat the Class now and then. The Seniors this morning, chose Champlin governor, and Lowell Lieutt. Governor. The Lieutenant Governor treated immediately and they chose their other officers. At commons, they all went into the Hall, in Procession, Thomas, who was appointed sheriff march’d at their head with a Paper cockade, in his hat, and brandishing a Cane, in his hand instead of a sword. He conducted the Governor and Lieutt. Governor to their seats, made his bow, and retired to the other table, for which Jackey Hale, punished him 4 shillings. However he performed his part so well, that the Spectators were much pleased and clap’d their hands. Hale happened to see Baron, the junior, clapping, and sent orders for him to go to him after commons. Baron, not happening to go before 2 o’clock was punished 5 shillings for impudence and 4 for disobedience, that is the way, these modest Tutors tyrannize over us. As there was a little noise in the Hall, Hale, struck the handle of his knife 3 times on the table, to still it, but instead of that, almost every knife in the Hall was struck on the table 3 Times. At last the Tutors rose, and as they were going out, about half a dozen fellows hiss’d them, they were enraged, turn’d round, and look’d as if they would devour, us. But they did not discover one Person; which made them look silly enough. When they turn’d their backs again, there was nothing but hissing, and groaning, and clapping hands, and stomping, heard in the Hall, till they got into the yard where, a few Potatoes were sent out to meet them.

All that the student could do in college, at least in the

120 Harvard College. 1786-87. [Jan.  
  
“ May 10,1786. We finished the Andria of Terence this morning.  
The class began it last February. I went through it at Haverhill in  
three evenings. However, it must be said that they study it only one  
week in four, and that week only four mornings, but even in that way  
it has taken thirteen lessons to go through this one play. We recite  
afternoons the Latin week in Cesar, but I have had nothing to say this  
week. The class is so numerous that he (the tutor) cannot hear more  
than one half of them recite at once, and so he takes turns.”  
  
It seems tolerably clear, therefore, that where students  
dropped the classics at Cambridge in the last century, there  
students begin the study in the present one. If this be the  
case, an interesting question rises as to how and where the las

“ May 1,1786. The Greek tutor is a young man ; indeed much too  
young (A. B. of 1782), as are all the tutors, for the place he occupies.  
Before he took his second degree, which was last Commencement, he  
was chosen a tutor of mathematics, in which he betrayed his ignorance  
often. Last fall he changed departments, and took up the Greek. His  
own class, the freshmen, were the first that laughed at him inthat. He  
has improved since that, but still makes frequent mistakes. It is cer-  
tainly wrong that the tutors should so often be changed, and be so  
young as they are. It would be better to choose a person immediately  
after he has taken his degree, than as they do; because when a youth  
leaves college he is obliged to turn his attention to other studies, and  
forgets a great deal of what he studied at college, whereas when he  
has lately graduated he has all fresh in his mind. The Doctor affects  
a great deal of popularity in his class, and with the help of the late  
disagreement between the classes, he has pretty well succeeded, but he  
does not seem to care what the other classes think of him.  
  
“ May 2. Our tutor gave us this morning a most extraordinary con-  
struction of a passage in Homer. Abbot Ist was beginning to con-  
strue the 181st line of the 6th Book,  
  
Iipéabe déwv, Sribev 8€ Spaxwr, peoon 3€ xipaipa,  
  
he said: a lion before ; but the Doctor corrected him by saying it meant  
superior to a lion. Abbot immediately took the hint and made it:  
superior to a lion, inferior to a dragon, and equal to a wild boar.”

He closes the list with a blast of indignation : —  
  
  
  
“ May 8. We recite this week in Terence and Cesar to Mr. J .  
This is the tutor of the oldest standing in the College; he is very well  
acquainted with the branch he has undertaken, and persons that are not  
students say that he is much of a gentleman. But it seems almost to  
be a maxim among the governors of the College to treat the students  
pretty much like brute beasts. There is an important air and a haughty  
look that every person belonging to the government (Mr. [Professor]  
Williams excepted) assumes, which indeed it is hard for me to submit  
to. But it may be of use to me, as it mortifies my vanity, and if any-  
thing in the world can teach me humility, it will be to see myself sub-  
jected to the commands of a person that I must despise. Mr. J is  
also accused of having many partialities and carrying them to very  
great length, and moreover that those partialities do not arise from any  
superior talents or virtues in the students, but from closer and more in-  
terested motives. There are some in our class with whom he has been  
particularly severe, and some he has shown more favor than any tutor  
ought to show to a student. I wish not his favor, as he may prize it  
too high ; and I fear not his severity, which he can never display if I do  
my duty.”

Syllogistics are very much despised by the scholars, and no attention  
seems to be paid to them by the company at Commencement. The  
scholars in general think that the government, in giving them those  
parts, write on their foreheads puUNCE in capital letters. Notwithstand-  
ing this, some of the most learned men in the country had Syllogistics  
when they graduated here. The good parts, as they are called, are  
more numerous this year than they have ever been. Before this there  
has been only one English and one Latin Oration, and no Poems. It  
is a doubt whether they intend to establish this as a precedent or  
whether it is only a distinguished favor to the present class, who pretend  
to be the best class for learning and genius that ever graduated here.  
It is said that the parts have been exceedingly well distributed, and all  
the College are pleased. However that may be, the syllogists all got  
together this evening and drank till not one of them could stand straight,  
or was sensible of what he did. A little after 9 they sallied out, and  
for a quarter of an hour made such a noise as might be heard at a mile  
distant. The tutors went out and after a short time persuaded them to  
disperse. Mr. had two squares of his windows broke.  
  
“ May 24. It is feared that some bad consequences will ensue from  
the high-go of the syllogists last evening. Borland, it seems, was the  
most active of them all; he collared Mr. and threw an handful  
of gravel in his face, and was rather disrespectful to Mr. . He  
went this morning to the former to make an apology for his conduct, but  
was told it could not be received, as the matter was already laid before  
the government. Thus those fellows play the tyrants here ; they have  
no regard, no allowances for youth and circumstances. They go out  
when they are almost certain of being insulted, and then bring the  
scholar for a crime of which he knew nothing under public censure.  
They cannot with any face say that a scholar ought to be so severely  
punished for depriving himself of his senses. For there are here in Col-  
lege persons who have seen as much intoxicated as Borland was  
yesterday and behaving quite as ill. But compassion is too great a  
virtue ever to be admitted into the breast of a tutor here. It is sup-  
posed, however, that Borland’s punishment will not be very severe, be-  
cause it requires an unanimous vote among the governors of the College  
to punish a student, and they are said to be at such variance one with  
the other that they can very seldom all agree.  
  
“ May 25. Government met and were assembled almost all this day  
to determine what punishment to inflict upon Borland. He was in-  
formed of it in the evening, and the class petitioned that it might be  
mitigated, but probably without much success.  
  
“ May 26. This morning after prayers Borland was called out to

ness is anything but an aggravation of the offence hardly com-  
mends itself to modern New England.  
  
Such difficulties were by no means uncommon under this  
régime. But it is fair to say that they appear occasionally to  
have been due in no small part to the instructors themselves.  
The following seems to have been such a case : —  
  
“ May 31,1786. Election Day. There is a custom among the  
scholars here which some of the classes follow and others do not. It is  
choosing a Governor and Lieutenant-Governor for the class. They  
commonly take some rich fellow who can treat the class now and then.  
The seniors this morning chose Champlin Governor, and Lowell Lieu-  
tenant-Governor. The Lieutenant-Governor treated immediately, and  
they chose their other officers. At commons they all went into the hall  
in procession. Thomas, who was appointed Sheriff, marched at their  
head, with a paper cockade in his hat, and brandishing a cane in his  
hand instead of a sword. He conducted the Governor and Lieu-  
tenant: Governor to their seats, made his bow, and retired to the other

table, for which Jackey H punished him four shillings. However,  
he performed his part so well that the spectators were much pleased  
and clapped their hands. H happened to see Baron, the junior,  
clapping, and sent orders for him to go to him after commons. Baron,  
not happening to go before 2 o&#x27;clock, was punished five shillings for  
impudence, and four for disobedience. That is the way these modest  
tutors tyrannize over us. As there was a little noise in the hall, H  
struck the handle of his knife three times on the table to still it, but  
instead of that almost every knife in the hall was struck on the table  
three times. At last the tutors rose, and as they were going out about  
half a dozen fellows hissed them. They were enraged, turned round  
and looked as if they would devour us, but they did not discover one  
person, which made them look silly enough. When they turned their  
backs again, there was nothing but hissing and groaning and clapping  
hands and stamping heard in the hall, till they got into the yard, where  
a few potatoes were sent out to meet them.”
