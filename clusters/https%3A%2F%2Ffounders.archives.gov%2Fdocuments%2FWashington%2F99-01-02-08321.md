r  
Head Quarters May 4th-8 1782  
  
I find myself arrived at that period, at which I hoped to have seen the Batallions of the several States compleated to their Establishment, in conformity to the requisition of Congress of the 19th Decr last.  
The inclosed returns of Recruits, which I have caused to be made up to the 1st Instant, will shew how totally short of my expectation the exertions of the States, have fallen—from your State your will find that 240 have joined the Army in consequence of the  
above requisition.  
All my accounts from Europe concur in declaring, that the British King and Ministry are still determined to prosecute the War, it becomes therefore our decided duty to be prepared to meet their Hostile intentions, in whatever way they are to be carried into  
execution; to do which, our utmost exertions are now called for—You will suffer me therefore to entreat, that if your State have any expectations from the Military Operations of this Season, not another moment may be lost in providing for and carrying into Execution, the full  
completion of their Batallions—It is scarcely necessary to inform you, that on this expectation, all our calculations must be formed, and on this Event must rest the hopes of the ensuing Campaign.  
My intelligence of the Actual Aid we may expect from our Allies, is not yet so explicit, as will lead me to decide absolutely on the Mode of Operations for this Campaign, but were our expectations of Support from that quarter ever so promising, yet from the  
Negligence and Langour of the States from whence our own exertions are to Spring, I am not at this day enabled to give any Assurance of our being prepared to Co-operate with our Allies, in any great Objects equal to their Expectations or our own abilities.  
I am Sorry to say, I have the best authority to assure your Excellency, that the Court of France is much distressed with the want of Vigour and exertion in the States, and with that disposition which appears willing at least, if not desirous, to cast all  
the burthen of the American War upon them; Waving the injustice and Impolicy of such a temper (which to me appears very conspicuous) how humiliating is the Idea, that our dependance for support should rest upon others beyond that point which absolute necessity dictates? how  
discouraging to our Allies! and how dishonorable to ourselves, must be our want of Vigour and utmost exertion at a time when, if we are not wanting to ourselves, our prospects are the fairest that our wishes could extend to.  
I find from the proceedings of the several states, that their calculations of Deficionces, formed an Application to the several Towns who furnish the Men, are greatly different from the Returns sent from the Army.  
I forbear mentioning many Reasons which might be assigned for this difference, and which in my opinion originate principally within the States, and will content myself with this one observation.  
That should the States deceive themselves in this respect, and fail to furnish the expected Force in the Field, they will not only cast an essential injury upon the Army, but the unhappy consequences of a failure in their expectations from the Military  
Operations, will reverberate upon themselves, whilst recrimination can have no effect towards alleviating our protacted Misfortunes and Distress.  
Altho’ Money matters are not within the Line of my duty, yet as they are so intimately connected with all Military Operations, and being lately informed by the Financier, in answer to some small requisitions on him, that he has not yet received one penny in  
money from any one State upon the Requisition of Congress for the 8,000,000 Dollars, whilst on the contrary some of the States are devising ways to draw from him the small sums he has been able otherwise to Establish, and that he is at this time barely able to feed the Army  
from hand to mouth, I cannot forbear to express my apprehension on that head; and to urge, with a warmth of Zeal and Earnestness, the most pointed and effectual attention of your State, to the actual raising and collecting their proportion of the mentioned requisition. Upon  
the present Plan of Non Compliance with requisitions for Men and Supplies, let me seriously ask your

e their real Design, And upon the most mature  
Deliberation I can bestow, I am obliged to declare it as my Opinion, that the measure in all its views, so far as it respects America, is merely delusory, having no serious Intention to admit our Independance upon its true principles, but is calculated to produce a Change  
of Ministry, to quiet the minds of their own people and reconcile them to a continuance of the War; while it is meant to amuse this Country with a false Idea of Peace, to draw us from our connections with France, and to lull us into a state of security and inactivity,  
which taking place, the Ministry will be left to prosecute the War in other parts of the World with greater Vigour and effect.  
Your Excellency will permit me on this occasion to observe, that even if the Nation and Parliament are really in earnest to obtain Peace with America, it will undoubtedly be wisdom in us to meet them with great Caution and Circumspection, and by all  
means to keep our Arms firm in our Hands—and instead of Relaxing one Iota in our exertions, rather to spring forward with redoubled Vigour that we may take the advantage of every favorable Opportunity untill our wishes are fully obtained No Nation ever suffered in Treaty  
by preparing, even in the moment of Negotiaton most vigourously for the Field.  
The Industry which the Enemy are using to propogate these pacific Reports, appears to me a circumstance very Suspicious—and the eagerness with which the people, as I am informed, are catching at them, is in my opinion equally dangerous.

HEAD QUARTERS, eet  
May 4, 1782.  
  
Sir: I find myself arrived at that period at which I hoped to have seen the Batal-  
lions of the several States completed to their full establishment, in conformity to the  
requisitions of Congress of the r9th December last.  
  
From the returns I have been able to obtain of the recruits furnished by the several  
States, I am sorry to observe, that their exertions to this time have almost totally dis-  
appointed this expectation.  
  
All my accounts from Europe concur in declaring that the British King and  
Ministry are still determined to prosecute the war. It becomes, therefore, our decided  
duty, to be prepared to meet these Hostile intentions in whatever way they are to be  
carried into execution, to do which our utmost exertions are now called for. You will  
suffer me therefore to intreat, that if your State have any expectations from the military  
operations of this season, not another moment may be lost in providing for and carry-  
ing into most effectual execution the full completion of their Batallions. It is scarcely  
necessary to inform you that on this expectation all our calculations must be formed,  
and on this event must rest the hopes of the ensuing campaign.  
  
My intelligence of the actual aid we may expect from ourallies, is not yet so explicit  
as will lead me to decide absolutely on the mode of operations for this campaign; but  
were our expectations of support from that quarter ever so promising, yet from the  
negligence and languer of the States from whence our own exertions are to spring, I am  
not at this day enabled to give any assurance of our being prepared to co-operate with  
our allies in any great objects equal to their expectations or our own ability. I am  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Notes, Queries and Replies. 235  
  
sorry to say, that I have the best authority to acquaint your Excellency, that the Court  
of France is much dissatisfied * with this want of vigour and exertion in the States, and  
with that disposition which appears willing if not desirious to cast all the burthen of the  
American war upon them. Waving theinjustice and impolicy of such a temper, (which  
to me appears very conspicuous,) how humiliating is the Idea, that our dependence for  
support should rest on others, beyond that point which absolute necessity dictates ? how  
discouraging to our allies? and how dishonorable to ourselves, must be our want of  
vigour and utmost exertion, at a time when, if we are not wanting to ourselves, our  
prospects are the fairest that our wishes could extend to.  
  
I find from the proceedings of the several States, that their Calculations of Deficien-  
cies, formed on application to.several Towns who furnish the men, are greatly different  
from the returns sent from the army _I forbear mentioning many reasons which might  
be assigned to produce: this difference, and which in my opinion originate principally  
within the States, and will content myself with this one observation, that should the  
States deceive themselves in this respect, and fail to furnish the expected force in the  
Field, they will not only cast an essential injury on the army, but the unhappy conse-  
quences of a failure of their expectations from the military operations, will reverberate  
upon themselves, whilst recriminations can have no effect towards alleviating our pro-  
tracted Misfortunes and Distress. .  
  
Altho’ money matters are not within the line of my Duty, yet as they are so inti-  
mately connected with all military operations, and being lately informed by the Financier,  
in answer to some small requisitions upon him, that he has not yet received one penny in  
money from any one State upon the requisition of Congress for the 1,000,000 Dollars,  
whilst on the contrary some of the States are devising ways to draw from him the small  
sums he has been able otherwise to establish, and that he is at this time darely able to  
Seed the army from hand to mouth. 1 cannot forbear to express my apprehension on  
that head, and to urge with the warmth of zeal and earnestness, the most pointed and  
effectual attention of your State to the actual Raising and Collecting t+ * * * Con-  
nection with France, and to lull us into a state of security and inactivity, which taking  
place, the Ministry will be left to prosecute the War in other parts of the World with  
greater vigor and effect.  
  
Your excellency will permit me on this occasion to observe, that even if the Nation  
and Parliament are really in earnest to obtain peace with America, it will undoubtedly  
be wisdom in us to meet them with great caution and circumspection and by all means  
to keep our arms firm in our hands, and instead of relaxing one Iota in our exertions  
rather to spring forward with redoubled vigour, that we may take the advantage of  
every favorable opportunity until our wishes are fully obtained. No Nation ever yet  
suffered in Treaty by preparing even in the moment of Negotiation, most vigorously for  
the Field. Pe P  
  
The Industry which the Enemy are using to propagate these pacific reports, appears  
to me a circumstance very suspicious, and the eagerness with which the people as I am  
informed, are catching at them, is in my opinion equally dangerous.  
  
His Excellency Gov&#x27;r Clinton.
