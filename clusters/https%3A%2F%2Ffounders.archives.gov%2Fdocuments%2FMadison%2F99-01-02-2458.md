mail of this evening will carry his  
dispatches for a British’ packet,  
which will sail from New-York  
immediately on theirarrival there,

in the message itself. But it may  
be proper to authorise you to as-  
sure the British government, as  
has been just expressed to its  
minister here, that the act is a  
meusure of precaution only, cal-  
led for by the occasion ; that it is

and particularly as opposing no  
obstacle whatever to amicable  
negotiations and satisfactory ad-  
justments with Great Britain, on  
the subjects of difference between

The suddenness of the present  
oppertunity does not ailow me  
time to add more than a newspa-  
per, containing a part of the pro-  
ceedings of congress in relation  
to the embargo.

mrilofthUcvening will carry his  
dispatehea for • British packet,  
which will aril from New-York  
immediately on their airivri there,

tunity, to inclose yon a copy of a  
message from the president to  
congress, and their act in por&gt;  
suanceofit, laying an immediate  
embargo on oar vessels and ex­  
ports. The policy and the causes

be proper to authorize you to as­  
sure the British govenuhent, as  
has been just expressed to its  
minister here, that the act is a (  
measure of precaution only, call­

to be considered at neither hostile  
in its character, nor as justifying,  
or inviting oHeading to hostility  
with say nation whatever, and  
particularly ea opposing no obsta­  
cle whatever te amicable ncgocia­
