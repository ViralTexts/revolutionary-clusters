Dear Sir  Monticello Sep. 21. 14.  
I learn from the Newspapers that the Vandalism of our enemy has triumphed at Washington over science as well as the Arts, by the destruction of the public library with the noble edifice in which it was deposited.  
			 of this transaction, as of that of Copenhagen, the world will entertain but one  
			 sentiment. they will  
			 see a nation suddenly withdrawn from a great war, full armed and full handed, taking advantage of another whom they had recently forced  
			 into it, unarmed, and unprepared, to indulge themselves in acts of barbarism which do not belong to a civilised age. when Van Ghent destroyed their shipping at Chatham, and De Ruyter rode triumphantly up the Thames, he might in like manner, by the acknolegement of their own historians, have forced all their ships up to London bridge, and there have burnt them, the tower, &amp; city, had these examples been then set. London, when thus menaced, was near a thousand years old, Washington is but in it’s teens.I presume it  
			 will be among the early objects of Congress to recommence their collection. this will be difficult while the  
			 war continues, and intercourse with  
			 Europe is attended with so much risk. you know my collection, it’s condition and extent. I have been 50. years making it, &amp; have spared no pains, opportunity or expence to make it what it is.  
			 while residing in Paris I devoted every afternoon I was disengaged, for a summer or two, in examining all the principal bookstores, turning over every book with my own hands, and putting by every  
			 thing which related to America, and indeed whatever was rare &amp; valuable in every science. besides this, I had standing orders, during the whole time I was in Europe, in it’s principal  
			 book-marts,  
			 particularly Amsterdam, Frankfort, Madrid and London, for such works relating to America as could not be found in Paris. so that, in that department, particularly, such a collection was made as probably can never again be effected;  
			 because it is hardly probable that the same opportunities, the same time, industry, perseverance, and expence, with some knolege of the bibliography of the subject would again happen to be in  
			 concurrence.during the same period, and after my return to America, I was led to procure also whatever related to the duties of those in the high concerns of the nation. so that the  
			 collection, which I suppose is of between 9. and 10,000. volumes, while it includes what is chiefly valuable in science and literature generally, extends more particularly to whatever belongs to  
			 the  
			 American statesman. in the diplomatic and Parliamentary branches, it is particularly full. it is long since I have been sensible it ought not to continue private property, and had provided that,  
			 at  
			 my death, Congress should have the refusal of it, at their own price. but the loss they have now incurred makes the present, the proper moment for their accomodation, without regard to the small  
			 remnant of time, and the barren use of my enjoying it.I ask of your friendship therefore to make for me the tender of it to the library committee of Congress, not knowing myself of whom the  
			 committee consists. I inclose you the catalogue, which will enable them to judge of it’s contents. nearly the whole are well bound, abundance of them elegantly, and of the choicest editions  
			 existing.   
			 they may be valued by persons named by themselves, and the payment made convenient to the public. it may be, for instance in such annual instalments as the law of Congress has left at their  
			 disposal,  
			 or in stock of any kind of their late loans, or of any loan they may institute at this session, so as to spare the present calls of our country, and await it’s days of peace and prosperity. they may enter  
			 nevertheless into immediate use of it, as 18. or 20. waggons would place it in Washington in a single trip of a fortnight.—I should be willing indeed to retain a few of the books to amuse the time I have yet to pass, which might be valued with the rest, but the not included in the sum of valuation until they should be restored at my death, which I would carefully provide for, so that the whole library, as it stands in the catalogue at this moment  
			 should be theirs, without any garbling. those I should like to retain would be chiefly classical and  
			 Mathematical, some few in other branches, &amp;  
			 particularly one of the five encyclopedias in the  
			 catalogue. but this, if not acceptable, would not be urged. I must add that I have  
			 not revised the library since I came home to live, so that it is probable some of the books may be missing,  
			 except  
			 in the chapters of Law and  
			 divinity, which have been revised, and stand exactly as in  
			 the catalogue. the return of the Catalogue will of course be needed, whether the tender be accepted or not. I do  
			 not know that it contains any branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from their collection. there is in fact no subject to which a member of Congress may not have occasion to  
			 refer.  
			 but such a wish would not correspond with my views of preventing it’s dismemberment. my desire is either to place it in their hands entire, or to preserve it so here. I am engaged in making an  
			 Alphabetical Index of the authors’ names, to be annexed to the catalogue in order to facilitate the finding their works in the catalogue, which I will forward to you as soon as compleated. any  
			 agreement you shall be so good as to take the trouble of entering into with the committee, I hereby confirm. Accept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.

ring the same period, and after my

procure, also whatever related to  
the duties of those in the.; high  
concerns of the nation, so that the  
collection, which I suppose is of  
between 9 and 10,000 volumes  
while itl includes what is chiefly

-Vonticello, September 21, 1814.  
  
pEAR sin—I learn from the newspapers that the  
vandalism of our enemy has triumphed at Weshing-  
ton over science as Well as the arts, by the destruc-  
tion of tie public library, with the noble edifice in  
which it was deposited. Of this transaction, as of  
that of Copentiagen, the world will entertain but one  
sentiment. They will see a nation suddenly with-  
draw froma great war, full armed and full handed,  
taking advantage ot another whom they had recently  
forced into it, unarmed and unprepared to indulge  
themselves in acts of barbarism which do not belong  
toacivilized age. When Van Ghent destroyed their  
shipping at Chatham, and De Ruyter rode trium-  
phantly up the Thames, he might, in like manner,  
by the acknowledgment of their own historians,  
have forced all their ships up to London br dge, and  
there have burnt them, the tower, and city, had these  
examples been then set. London, when thus menaced,  
was near a thousand years old; Washington but in  
its teens.  
  
F presume it will be among the early objects of  
congress to recommence their collection. This will  
be difficult while the war continues, and intercourse  
with so much risk. You know my collection, its  
condition and exient. T have been 50 vears making  
it. and have spared no pains, opport un ity, or expense  
te mike it as is. While residing in Paris [ devoted  
every afternoon I was disengaged for a summer or  
two, in examining all the principal book-stores turn.  
ing over every book with my own hands, and putting  
by every thing which related to America, and indeed  
whatever was rare and valuable in every science; be.  
sides this, [had standing orders, during the whole  
timg-I was ia Ewrope in its principal bogk-inarts,  
  
particularly Amsterdam, Frankfort, Madrid and  
{ London, for such works relating to America as could  
not be found in Paris. So that, in that department  
particularly, suc a collection was made es probably |  
can never again be effected; because it is hardly pro-  
babte that the same opportunities, the same time, in-  
tee » and perseverance and expense with some  
knowledge of the bibliography of the subject would  
again happen in concurrence. During the same pe-  
riod, and after my return to America I was led to  
procure also whatever related to the duties of those  
in the highest concerns of the nation, so that the col-  
lection, which I suppose is of between 9 and 10,000

sensible it ought not to continue private property,  
and had provided at my death, congress should have  
the refusal of it, at their own price; but the loss they  
have now incurred makes the present, the proper  
moment for their accommodation without regard to  
the small remnant of time, and the barren use of my  
enjoying it. Task of your friendship, therefore, to  
m.ke tor me the tender of it to the library committee  
of congress, not knowing myself, of whom the com-  
mittee consists; I enclose you a catologue, which wilk

loans, or of any loan they may institute at this ses-  
sion so as to spare the present calls of our country,  
and await its days ef peace and prosperity. They  
may enter nevertheless, into immediate use of it, as

(carefully provide for, so that the whole library, as it  
stands in the catalogue at this moment, should be  
theirs, without any garbling. Those I should like  
to retain would be chiefly classical and mathemati-  
‘cal, some few in other branches, and particularly one  
of the five Encyclopedias in the catalogue: but this,  
if not acceptable, would not be urged. Imust add,  
that I have not revised the library since came home  
to live, so that it is probable some of the books may  
| be missing, except in the chapters of law and divi-  
‘nity, which have been revised, and stand exactly as  
in the catalogue which will of course be needed,  
whether the tender be accepted or not. I do not  
Know that it contains any branch of science which  
| congress would wish toexclude from their collection.  
There is in fact no subject to which a member of  
congress may not have occasion to refer. But such  
a wish would not correspond with my views of pre-  
venting its dismemberment. My design is either te  
place it in their hands entire, or preserve it sa here.

Monlicello, Sejit. 21, IS 11.  
Dear Sir—I loam from the- newspapers  
that the Vandalism of our enemy has tri­  
umphed at Washington, over science as well  
as the arts, by the destruction of the public  
Library, with the noble edifice in which it  
was deposited. Of this transaction, as of  
that of Copenhagen, the world will entertain  
but one sentiment. They will sec a nation  
suddenly withdrawn from a great war, full  
armed and full handed, taking advantage of  
! another whom they had recently forced into  
it, unarmed and unprepared, to indulge them­  
selves in acts of barbarism which do not bc­  
. long to a civilized age. When Van Ghent  
destroyed their shipping at Chatham, and  
Dc Ruyter rode triumphantly up the Thames,  
he might in like manner, by the acknowledge­  
ment of their own historians, have forced  
all their ships up to London Bridge, and  
there have burnt them, the tower and city,  
had these examples been then set. London,  
when thus menaced, was near a thousand  
years old—Washington is but in its teens.  
1 presume it will be among the early objects  
j of Congress to re-eommencc their collec­  
tion. This will be difficult while the war  
continues, and intercourse with Lurope is  
attended with so much risk. You know my  
collection, its condition and extent. 1 have  
I oCi I, .11_. .-::ghave ,&#x27;p.nt d no  
pains, opportunity, or expense, to make it  
what it is. While residing in Laris, | devot­  
ed every afternoon I was disengaged, for a  
summer or two, in examining all the princi­  
pal bookstores, turning over every book u ilh  
my own hands, and putting by every thing  
which related to America, and indeed what­  
ever was rare and valuable in every science.  
Besides this, 1 had standing orders, during  
the whole time I was in Europe, in its prin­  
cipal book-marts, particularly Amsterdam,  
Frankfort, Madrid and London, for such  
works relating to America, ,.s could not be  
found in Paris. So that, in that department  
particularly, such a collection was made as  
probably can never again be effected; be­  
cause it is hardly probable that the same op­  
portunities, the same time, industry, perse­  
verance, and expense, with some knowledge  
of the bibliography of the subject, would  
again happen to be in concurrence. During  
the same period, and after my return to  
America, I was led to procure also what­  
ever related to the duties of those in the high

tion, which I suppose is of between nine  
and ten thousand volumes, while it includes  
what is chiefly valuable in science and liter­  
ature generally, extends more nnrtirnk,,], o,  
  
whatever belongs to the American statesman;  
in the diplomatic and parliamentary branches,  
it is particularly lull, it is long since I have  
been sensible it ought not to continue private  
property, and had provided that, tit tny death,  
Congress should have the refusal of it at  
their own price: but the loss they have now  
incurred, makes the present the proper mo­  
ment for their accommodation, without re­  
gard to the small remnant of limp, and the  
barren use of my enjoying it. I ask of your  
: friendship, therefore, to make for me the  
tender of it to the Library Committee of  
Congress, not knowing myself of w hom the  
committee consists. I enclose you the ca­  
talogue, which will enable them to judge of  
its contents; nearly the whole are well  
bound, abundance of them elegantly, and of  
the elioicest editions existing. They may  
he valued by persons named by themselves,  
| and the payment made convenient to the  
public ; it may he, for instance, in such an­  
nual instalments as the&#x27;laW of Congress has  
left at their disposal, or in stock of any of  
their late loans, or of any loan that they may  
institute this session, so as to spare the pre­  
sent calls of our country, and await its days  
of peace and prosperity. They may enter,  
nevertheless, into immediate use of it, as  
eighteen or twenty wagons would place it in  
Washington, m a single trip ol a fortnight.  
I should be willing, indeed, to retain a lew  
of the books to amuse the time I have vet to  
pass, which might be valued with the rest,  
hut not included in the sum of valuation,  
until they should be restored at my death,  
which I would carefully provide for, so that  
the w hole library, as it stands in the catalogue  
at this moment, should he theirs, without any  
garbling. Those I should like to retain  
would he chiefly Classical and Mathematical,  
some few in other branches, and particularly  
one o| the five Encyclopaedias in the cata­  
logue But this, if not acceptable, would  
not be urged. I must add that I have not  
revised the library since I came home to live,  
so that it is probable some of the hooks may  
he missing, except.in the chapters n(&#x27;T,aw  
and i)i\iiiit\, which have been revised, and  
&#x27;■Maud exactly as in &#x27;Ik catalogue. Tin n­  
  
turn of the catalogue will of course^  
&#x27; eel, whether the tender be accepted  
I do not know that it contains any|J*  
science which Congress would wish  
.dude from their collection. There  
fact, no subject to which a membero[  
gress may not have occasion to refer  
such a wish would not correspond  
views of preventing its dismemberment  
desire is either to place it in their hj,

in making an alphabetical index of  
thor’s names, to be annexed to.the cat  
in order to facilitate the finding their  
in the catalogue, which 1 will forward  
as soon as completed. Any agreeino.

Frankfort, Madrid and London, for such works  
relating to America as could not be lound la Paris,  
so that in that department, particularly, such a  
collection was made ti ca i never again te attect­

opjiortuiitties, the same time, industry, persever­  
euce and expense, with some knowledge of the  
bihliography of the subject would again be found  
Ineonciirence. During the same period, and after  
my return to America, I was led to  
procure also whatever related to the  
duties of those in the high concerns of  
the Nation, so that the collection, which  
I suppose is of between 9.000 and 10.U00 volumes,  
while il includes chiefly all that is valuable iu  
science and literature generally, extends more  
particiilnrly to whatever belongs to the American  
tatevtnan : in the diplomatic and oarHsmeniarv  
branches it is particularly faU. It U long since &#x27;I  
have been sensible it ought not u couuuue pri­

makes the present the proper moment for their  
accommodation, without regard to the small  
remnant of time and the barren ue of ray not  
enjoying it  
1 ask ol your friendship therefore to make for  
me the tender of it to the Library Committee of  
Congress, not knowing myself of whom the Com  
mittee consists, l inclose you the catalogue.  
which will enable them to judge of its contents.  
Nearly the whole are well bound, abundance of

selves, and the payment made convenient to the  
public. It may be. for instance, in such annual  
installments as the law of i!ongress has left at their  
diopOKal, or stock of any of their late loans, or of  
any loan tney may institute at this session, soa  
to spore the present calls of onrcountry and await  
its days of peace and prosperity. They may enter.  
nevertneiess, into immediate use of it, as eighteen  
or twenty wagons would place U iu Washiugtou  
in a single trip of a fortuit;ht.  
1 should be willing, indeed, to retain a few of  
the books to amuse the time I have yet to pass.  
which might be valued with the rest, but not in  
cluded iu the sum of valuation until thev should  
be restored at my death, w hich I would carefully  
firovide for, so that the whi le library, as it Htauds  
n the catalogue at the moment, should be theirs  
without any garbling.  
Those I should like to retain would be chieflv  
classical and mathematical, some few in other  
branches, aud particularly one of the five Ency  
clopedias la the catalogue: but this, ll not ac­  
ceptable, would not be urged. I must add that I  
nave not revised tne library si no I came  
home to live, so that it is probable some of  
the books may be missing, except in the  
chapters of law and divinity, which have  
been revised, ana stand exartly as in the  
catalogue. The return of the catalogue will, of  
course, be needed, whether the tender be ac­  
cepted or not. I know that it contains no branch

from their collection. There is in fact no subject  
to which a Member of Congress may not have oc  
casion to reier. nut such a wish would not cor  
respond with ray viewj of preventing its disraem  
berment. My desire la either to place it In their  
hands entire, or to preserve it so here. I am en-  
griged in making an alphabetical index of the  
authors&#x27; names to be annexed to the catalogues in  
order to facilitate the finding of their names in  
the catalogue, wnich 1 will forward to you as  
soon as completed. Any agreement you shall be  
so good as to take the trouble of entering into  
with the Committee I hereby confirm. Accept  
tne assurance ox my great esteem ana respect.

#### 1898-11-03 &middot; [Nebraska City, Neb.](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nebraska_City%2C_Nebraska)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
&quot;I learn from the newspapers that the  
vandalism of our enemy has triumphed  
at Washington , over science as well as  
the arts , by the destruction of the pub­  
lic library , with the uoblo edifice in  
which it was deposited. Of tin&#x27;s trans­  
action , as of that of Copenhagen , the  
world will entertain but ono sentiment.  
* * * * *  
I presume it will bo among the early ob­  
jects of congress to recommence their  
  
collection. This will be difficult while  
the war continues. You know my col­  
lection , its condition , and extent. I  
have been fifty years making it , and  
have spared no pains , opportunity , or  
expense , to make it what it is. While  
residing in Paris , I devoted every after­  
noon I was disengaged for a summer or  
two , iu examining all the principal book­  
stores , turning over every book with my  
own hand&#x27; , and , putting byeverything  
which related to America , and , indeed ,  
whatever was rare and valuable in every  
science. Besides this I had standing  
orders during the whole time I was in  
Europe , in its principal book marts ,  
principally Amsterdam , Frankfort , Ma­  
drid , and London , for such works relat­  
ing to America as could not bo found in  
Paris. So that in that department par­  
ticularly , such a collection was made as  
probably can never again bo effected ,  
oecause it is hardly probable that the  
same opportunities , the same time , in­  
dustry , perseverance , and -expense ,  
with some knowledge of the bibliography  
of the subject , would again happen to  
be in concurrence. During the same  
period , and after my return to America ,  
I was led to procure also whatever re­  
lated to the duties of those in the high  
concerns of the nation. So that the col­  
lection , which I suppose is between nine  
and ten thousand volumes , while it in­  
cludes what is chiefly valuable in science  
and literature generally , extends more  
particularly to whatever belongs to the  
i American : statesman. Inthediplomatic  
and parliamentary branches , it is par­  
ticularly full. It is long since I have  
oeen sensible it ought not to continue  
private property , and had provided that  
at my death congress should have the  
refusal of it at their own price. But the  
loss they have now incurred makes the  
present the proper moment for their  
accouiodatiou , without regard to the  
small remnant of time and the barren  
use of iny enjoying it. I ask of your  
friendship , therefore , to make for me  
the tender of it to the library committee  
of congress. I enclose you the cata­  
logue , which will enable thoui to judge  
of its contents. * * * They  
may enter into immediate use of it , as  
eighteen or twenty wagons would place  
it in Washington in a single trip of a  
fortnight. * * * I do not  
know that it contains any branch of  
science which congress would wish to  
exclude from their collection ; there is  
in fact no subject to which a member of  
congress may not have occasion to re  
fer.
