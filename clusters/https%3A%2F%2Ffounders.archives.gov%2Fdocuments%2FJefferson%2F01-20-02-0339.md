The refusing to our vessels the faculty of becoming national bottoms on sale to their citizens was never before done by any nation but England. I cannot help hoping that these were wanderings of a moment, founded in misinformation—which reflection will have corrected before you receive this.  
Whenever jealousies are expressed as to any supposed views of ours on the dominion of the West Indies, you cannot go farther than the truth in asserting we have none. If there be one principle more deeply rooted than any other in the mind of every American, it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest. As to commerce indeed we have strong sensations. In casting our eyes over the earth, we see no instance of a nation forbidden, as we are, by foreign powers to deal with neighbours, and obliged with them to carry into another hemisphere the mutual supplies necessary to relieve mutual wants. This is not merely a question between the foreign power and our neighbour. We are interested in i
