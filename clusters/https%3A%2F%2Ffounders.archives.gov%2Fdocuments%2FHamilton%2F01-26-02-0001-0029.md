New-York, August 10, 1802.  
Sir,  
  
Finding that a story long since propagated under circumstances, which it was expected would soon consign it to oblivion, (and by which I have been complimented at the expence of Generals Washington and La Fayette) has of late been revived and has acquired a degree of importance by being repeated in different publications as well as in Europe as America—it becomes a duty to counteract its currency and influence by an explicit disavowal.  
The story imports in substance, that General La Fayette, with the approbation or connivance of General Washington, ordered me, as the officer who was to command the attack on a British redoubt, in the course of the siege of York-Town, to put to death all those of the enemy who should happen to be taken in the redoubt; and that through motives of humanity I forbore to execute the order.  
Positively and unequivocally I declare, that no such nor similar order, nor any intimation nor hint resembling it, was ever by me received or understood to have been given.  
It is needless to enter into an explanation of some occurrences on the occasion alluded to, which may be conjectured to have given rise to the calumny. It is enough to say that they were entirely unconnected with any act of either of the Generals who have been accused.  
With esteem, I am, Sir,   Your obedient servant,  
  
A. Hamilton

“The story imports, in substance,” says the  
indignant Hamilton, “that Gen, Lafayette,  
with the approbation or connivance of Gen,  
Washington, ordered me, as the officer who  
was to command the attack on a British re-  
doubt, in the course of the siege of York-

THE STORM OF THE YORK-

I  
  
From the Evening Post, August 11, 1802  
  
HAMILTON TO THE EVENING POST, N. Y.  
New York, August 10, 1802  
Sir  
  
Finding that a story long since propa-  
gated under circumstances, which it was  
expected would soon consign it to ob-  
livion (and by which I have been com-  
plimented at the expense of Generals  
Washington and Lafayette), has of late  
been revived, and has acquired a degree  
of importance by being repeated in dif-  
ferent publications, as well in Europe as  
America, it becomes a duty to counteract  
its currency and influence by an explicit  
disavowal.  
  
The story imports, in substance, that  
General Lafayette, with the approbation  
or connivance of General Washington,  
ordered me, as the officer who was to  
command the attack on a British re-  
doubt, in the course of the siege of York-  
Town, to put to death all those of the  
enemy who should happen to be taken  
in the redoubt; and that, through mo-  
tives of humanity, I forbore to execute  
the order.  
  
Positively and unequivocally, I declare  
that no such nor similar orders, nor any  
intimation or hint resembling it, was ever  
  
363  
  
by me received, or understood to have  
been given.  
  
It is needless to enter into an explana-  
tion of some of the occurrences on the  
occasion alluded to, which may be con-  
strued to have given rise to the calumny.  
It is enough to say that they were en-  
tirely unconnected with any act of either  
of the two Generals who have been  
accused, _  
  
With esteem, I am, dear sir  
Your obedient servant  
A. HAMILTO
