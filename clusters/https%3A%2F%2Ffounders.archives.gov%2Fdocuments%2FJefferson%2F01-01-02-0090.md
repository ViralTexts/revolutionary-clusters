Resolved that it be an instruction to the said deputies when assembled in General Congress with the deputies from the other states of British America to propose to the said Congress that an humble and dutiful address be presented to his majesty begging leave to lay before him as chief magistrate of the British empire the united complaints of his majesty’s subjects in America; complaints which are excited by many unwarrantable incroachments and usurpations, attempted to be made by the legislature of one part of the empire, upon those rights which god and the laws have given equally and independently to all. To represent to his majesty that these his states have often individually made humble application to his imperial throne, to obtain thro’ it’s intervention some redress of their injured rights; to none of which was ever even an answer condescended. Humbly to hope that this their joint address, penned in the language of truth, and divested of those expressions of servility which would persuade his majesty that we are asking favors and not rights, shall obtain from his majesty a more respectful acceptance. And this his majesty will think we have reason to expect when he reflects that he is no more than the chief officer of the people, appointed by the laws, and circumscribed with definite powers, to assist in working the great machine of government erected for their use, and consequently subject to their superintendance. And in order that these our rights, as well as the invasions of them, may be laid more fully before his majesty, to take a view of them from the origin and first settlement of these countries.  
To remind him that our ancestors, before their emigration to America, were the free inhabitants of the British dominions in Europe, and possessed a right, which nature has given to all men, of departing from the country in which chance, not choice has placed them, of going in quest of new habitations, and of there establishing new societies, under such laws and regulations as to them shall seem most likely to promote public happiness. That their Saxon ancestors had under this universal law, in like manner, left their native wilds and woods in the North of Europe, had possessed  themselves of the island of Britain then less charged with inhabitants, and had established there that system of laws which has so long been the glory and protection of that country. Nor was ever any claim of superiority or dependance asserted over them by that mother country from which they had migrated: and were such a claim made it is beleived his majesty’s subjects in Great Britain have too firm a feeling of the rights derived to them from their ancestors to bow down the sovereignty of their state before such visionary pretensions. And it is thought that no circumstance has occurred to distinguish materially the British from the Saxon emigration. America was conquered, and her settlements made and firmly established, at the expence of individuals, and not of the British public. Their own blood was spilt in acquiring lands for their settlement, their own fortunes expended in making that settlement effectual. For themselves they fought, for themselves they conquered, and for themselves alone they have right to hold. No shilling was ever issued from the public treasures of his majesty or his ancestors for their assistance, till of very late times, after the colonies had become established on a firm and permanent footing. That then indeed, having become valuable to Great Britain for her commercial purposes, his parliament was pleased to lend them assistance against an enemy who would fain have drawn to herself the benefits of their commerce to the great aggrandisement of herself and danger of Great Britain. Such assistance, and in such circumstances, they had often before given to Portugal and other allied states, with whom they carry on a commercial intercourse. Yet these states never supposed that, by calling in her aid, they thereby submitted themselves to her sovereignty. Had such terms been proposed, they would have rejected them with disdain, and trusted for better to the moderation of their enemies, or to a vigorous exertion of their own force. We do not however mean to underrate those aids, which to us were doubtless valuable, on whatever principles granted: but we would shew that they cannot give a title to that authority which the British parliament would arrogate over us; and that they may amply be repaid, by our giving to the inhabitants of Great Britain such exclusive privileges in trade as may be advantageous to them, and at the same time not too restrictive to ourselves. That settlements having been thus effected in the wilds of America, the emigrants thought proper to adopt that system of laws under which they had hitherto lived in the mother country, and to continue their union with her by submitting themselves to the same common sovereign, who was thereby made the central  link connecting the several parts of the empire thus newly multiplied.  
But that not long were they permitted, however far they thought themselves removed from the hand of oppression, to hold undisturbed the rights thus acquired at the hazard of their lives and loss of their fortunes. A family of princes was then on the British throne, whose treasonable crimes against their people brought on them afterwards the exertion of those sacred and sovereign rights of punishment, reserved in the hands of the people for cases of extreme necessity, and judged by the constitution unsafe to be delegated to any other judicature. While every day brought forth some new and unjustifiable exertion of power over their subjects on that side the water, it was not to be expected that those here, much less able at that time to oppose the designs of despotism, should  
  
  
Division of colonies.  
  
be exempted from injury. Accordingly that country which had been acquired by the lives, the labors and the fortunes of individual adventurers, was by these princes at several times parted out and distributed among the favorites and

followers of their fortunes; and by an assumed right of the crown alone were erected into distinct and independent governments; a measure which it is beleived his majesty’s prudence and understanding would prevent him from imitating at this day; as no exercise of such a power of dividing and dismembering a country has ever occurred in his majesty’s realm of England, tho’ now of very antient standing; nor could it be justified or acquiesced under there or in any other part of his majesty’s empire.  
That  
  
  
Restrictions on our trade.  
  
the exercise of a free trade with all parts of the world, possessed by the American colonists as of natural right, and which no law of their own had taken away or abridged, was next the object of unjust incroachment. Some of the colonies having thought proper to continue the administration of their government in the name and under the authority of his majesty king Charles the first, whom notwithstanding his late deposition by the Common-wealth of England, they continued in the sovereignty of their state, the Parliament for the Common-wealth took the same in high offence, and assumed upon themselves the power of prohibiting their trade with all other parts of the world except the island of Great Britain. This arbitrary act however they soon recalled, and by solemn treaty entered into on the 12th. day of March 1651, between the said Commonwealth by their Commissioners and the colony of Virginia by their house of Burgesses, it was expressly stipulated by the 8th. article of the said treaty that they should have ‘free trade as the  people of England do enjoy to all places and with all nations according to the laws of that Commonwealth.’ But that, upon the restoration of his majesty King Charles the second, their rights of free commerce fell once more a victim to arbitrary power: and by several acts  
  
  
12. C. 2. c. 18. 14. C. 2. c. 11. 25. C. 2. c. 7. 7. 8. W. M. c. 22. 11. W. 3. 4. Anne. 6. G. 2. c. 13.  
  
of his reign as well as of some of his successors the trade of the colonies was laid under such restrictions as shew what hopes they might form from the justice of a British parliament were its uncontrouled power admitted over these states. History has informed us that bodies of men as well as individuals are susceptible of the spirit of tyranny. A view of these acts of parliament for regulation, as it has been affectedly called, of the American trade, if all other evidence were removed out of the case, would undeniably evince the truth of this observation. Besides the duties they impose on our articles of export and import, they prohibit our going to any Markets Northward of cape Finesterra in the kingdom of Spain for the sale of commodities which Great Britain will not take from us, and for the purchase of others with which she cannot supply us; and that for no other than the arbitrary purpose of purchasing for themselves by a sacrifice of our rights and interests, certain privileges in their commerce with an allied state, who, in confidence that their exclusive trade with America will be continued while the principles and power of the British parliament be the same, have induldged themselves in every exorbitance which their avarice could dictate, or our necessities extort: have raised their commodities called for in America to the double and treble of what they sold for before such exclusive privileges were given them, and of what better commodities of the same kind would cost us elsewhere; and at the same time give us much less for what we carry thither, than might be had at more convenient ports. That these acts prohibit us from carrying in quest of other purchasers the surplus of our tobaccoes remaining after the consumption of Great Britain is supplied: so that we must leave them with the British merchant for whatever he will please to allow us, to be by him reshipped to foreign markets, where he will reap the benefits of making sale of them for full value. That to heighten still the idea of parliamentary justice, and to shew with what moderation they are like to exercise power, where themselves are to feel no part of it’s weight, we take leave to mention to his majesty certain other acts of British parliament, by which they would prohibit us from manufacturing for our own use the articles we raise on our own lands with our own labor.  
  
5. G. 2.  
  
By an act passed in the 5th. year of the reign of his late majesty king George the second an American subject is forbidden  to make a hat for himself of the fur which he has taken perhaps on his own soil. An instance of despotism to which no parrallel can be produced in the most arbitrary ages of British history. By one other act  
  
  
23. G. 2. c. 29.  
  
passed in the 23d. year of the same reign, the iron which we make we are forbidden to manufacture; and, heavy as that article is, and necessary in every branch of husbandry, besides commission and insurance, we are to pay freight for it to Great Britain, and freight for it back again, for the purpose of supporting, not men, but machines, in the island of Great Britain. In the same spirit of equal and impartial legislation is to be viewed the act of parliament passed  
  
5. G. 2. c.7.  
  
in the 5th. year of the same reign, by which American lands are made subject to the demands of British creditors, while their own lands were still continued unanswerable for their debts; from which one of these conclusions must necessarily follow, either that justice is not the same thing in America as in Britain, or else that the British parliament pay less regard to it here than there. But that we do not point out to his majesty the injustice of these acts with intent to rest on that principle the cause of their nullity, but to shew that experience confirms the propriety of those political principles which exempt us from the jurisdiction of the British parliament. The true ground on which we declare these acts void is that the British parliament has no right to exercise authority over us.  
That these exercises of usurped power have not been confined to instances alone in which themselves were interested; but they have also intermeddled with the regulation of the internal affairs of  
  
  
9. Anne.  
  
the colonies. The act of the 9th. of Anne for establishing a post office in America seems to have had little connection with British convenience, except that of accomodating his majesty’s ministers and favorites with the sale of a lucrative and easy office.  
That thus have we hastened thro’ the reigns which preceded his majesty’s, during which the violation of our rights were less alarming, because repeated at more distant intervals, than that rapid and bold succession of injuries which is likely to distinguish the present from all other periods of American story. Scarcely have our minds been able to emerge from the astonishment into which one stroke of parliamentary thunder has involved us, before another more heavy and more alarming is fallen on us. Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and pursued unalterably thro’ every change of ministers, too plainly prove a deliberate, systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.

But  
  
  
Act suspending legislature of New York.  
  
that one other act passed in the same 7th. year of his reign, having been a peculiar attempt, must ever require peculiar mention. It is intitled ‘an act  
One  
  
  
7. G. 3. c. 59.  
  
free and independent legislature hereby takes upon itself to suspend the powers of another, free and independent as itself, thus exhibiting a phaenomenon, unknown in nature, the creator and creature of it’s own power. Not only the principles of common sense, but the common feelings of human nature must be surrendered up, before his majesty’s subjects here can be persuaded to beleive that they hold their political existence at the will of a British parliament Shall these governments be dissolved, their property annihilated, and their people reduced to a state of nature, at the imperious breath of a body of men whom they never saw, in whom they never confided, and over whom they have no powers of punishment or removal, let their crimes against the American public be ever so great? Can any one reason be assigned why 160,000 electors in the island of Great Britain should give law to four millions in the states of America, every individual of whom is equal to every individual of them in virtue, in understanding, and in bodily strength? Were this to be admitted, instead of being a free people, as we have hitherto supposed, and mean to continue, ourselves, we should suddenly be found the slaves, not of one, but of 160,000 tyrants, distinguished too from all others by this singular circumstance that they are removed from the reach of fear, the only restraining motive which may hold the hand of a tyrant.  
That  
  
  
14. G. 3.  
  
by ‘an act to discontinue in such manner and for such time  as are therein mentioned the landing and discharging lading or shipping of goods wares and merchandize at the town and within the harbor of Boston in the province of Massachusett’s bay in North America’ which was passed at the last session of British parliament, a large and populous town, whose trade was their sole subsistence, was deprived of that trade, and involved in utter ruin. Let us for a while suppose the question of right suspended, in order to examine this act on principles of justice. An act of parliament had been passed imposing duties on teas to be paid in America, against which act the Americans had protested as inauthoritative. The East India company, who till that time had never sent a pound of tea to America on their own account, step forth on that occasion the asserters of parliamentary right, and send hither many ship loads of that obnoxious commodity. The masters of their several vessels however, on their arrival in America, wisely attended to admonition, and returned with their cargoes. In the province of New England alone the remonstrances of the people were disregarded, and a compliance, after being many days waited for, was flatly refused. Whether in this the master of the vessel was governed by his obstinacy or his instructions, let those who know, say. There are extraordinary situations which require extraordinary interposition. An exasperated people, who feel that they possess power, are not easily restrained within limits strictly regular. A number of them assembled in the town of Boston, threw the tea into the ocean and dispersed without doing any other act of violence. If in this they did wrong, they were known, and were amenable to the laws of the land, against which it could not be objected that they had ever in any instance been obstructed or diverted from their regular course in favor of popular offenders. They should therefore not have been distrusted on this occasion. But that ill-fated colony had formerly been bold in their enmities against the house of Stuart, and were now devoted to ruin by that unseen hand which governs the momentous affairs of this great empire. On the partial representations of a few worthless ministerial dependants, whose constant office it has been to keep that government embroiled, and who by their treacheries hope to obtain the dignity of the British knighthood, without calling for a party accused, without asking a proof, without attempting a distinction between the guilty and the innocent, the whole of that antient and wealthy town is in a moment reduced from opulence to beggary. Men who had spent their lives in extending the British commerce, who had invested in that place the wealth their honest endeavors had merited,  found themselves and their families thrown at once on the world for subsistence by it’s charities. Not the hundredth part of the inhabitants of that town had been concerned in the act complained of; many of them were in Great Britain and in other parts beyond sea; yet all were involved in one indiscriminate ruin, by a new executive power unheard of till then, that of a British parliament. A property of the value of many millions of money was sacrifised to revenge, not repay, the loss of a few thousands. This is administering justice with a heavy hand indeed! And when is this tempest to be arrested in it’s course? Two wharfs are to be opened again when his majesty shall think proper: the residue which lined the extensive shores of the bay of Boston are forever interdicted the exercise of commerce. This little exception seems to have been thrown in for no other purpose than that of setting a precedent for investing his majesty with legislative powers. If the pulse of his people shall beat calmly under this experiment, another and another will be tried till the measure of despotism be filled up. It would be an insult on common sense to pretend that this exception was made in order to restore it’s commerce to that great town. The trade which cannot be received at two wharfs alone, must of necessity be transferred to some other place; to which it will soon be followed by that of the two wharfs. Considered in this light it would be an insolent and cruel mockery at the annihilation of the town of Boston.  
By the act for the suppression of riots and tumults in the town of Boston, passed also in the last session of parliament, a murder committed there is, if the governor pleases, to be tried in the court of King’s bench in the island of Great Britain, by a jury of Middlesex. The witnesses too, on receipt of such a sum as the Governor shall think it reasonable for them to expend, are to enter into recognisance to appear at the trial. This is in other words taxing them to the amount of their recognisance; and that amount may be whatever a Governor pleases. For who does his majesty think can be prevailed on to cross the Atlantick for the sole purpose of bearing evidence to a fact? His expences are to be borne indeed as they shall be estimated by a Governor; but who are to feed the wife and children whom he leaves behind, and who have had no other subsistence but his daily labor? Those epidemical disorders too, so terrible in a foreign climate, is the cure of them to be estimated among the articles of expence, and their danger to be warded off by the almighty power of a parliament? And the wretched criminal, if he happen to have offended on the American side, stripped of his  privilege of trial by peers, of his vicinage, removed from the place where alone full evidence could be obtained, without money, without counsel, without friends, without exculpatory proof, is tried before judges predetermined to condemn. The cowards who would suffer a countryman to be torn from the bowels of their society in order to be thus offered a sacrifice to parliamentary tyranny, would merit  
  
  
12. G. 3. c. 24.  
  
that everlasting infamy now fixed on the authors of the act! A clause for a similar purpose had been introduced into an act passed in the 12th. year of his majesty’s reign entitled ‘an act for the better securing and preserving his majesty’s dock-yards, magazines, ships, ammunition and stores,’ against which as meriting the same censures the several colonies have already protested.  
That these are the acts of power assumed by a body of men foreign to our constitutions, and unacknowleged by our laws; against which we do, on behalf of the inhabitants of British America, enter this our solemn and determined protest. And we do earnestly intreat his majesty, as yet the only mediatory power between the several states of the British empire, to recommend to his parliament of Great Britain the total revocation of these acts, which however nugatory they be, may yet prove the cause of further discontents and jealousies among us.  
That we next proceed to consider the conduct of his majesty, as holding the executive powers of the laws of these states, and mark  
  
  
Refusing assent to laws for trifling reasons.  
  
out his deviations from the line of duty. By the constitution of Great Britain as well as of the several American states, his majesty possesses the power of refusing to pass into a law any bill which has already passed the other two branches of legislature. His majesty however and his ancestors, conscious of the impropriety of opposing their single opinion to the united wisdom of two houses of parliament, while their proceedings were unbiassed by interested principles, for several ages past have modestly declined the exercise of this power in that part of his empire called Great Britain. But by change of circumstances, other principles than those of justice simply have obtained an influence on their determinations. The addition of new states to the British empire has produced an addition of new, and sometimes opposite interests. It is now therefore the great office of his majesty to resume the exercise of his negative power, and to prevent the passage of laws by any one legislature of the empire which might bear injuriously on the rights and interests of another. Yet this will not excuse the wanton exercise of this power which we have seen his majesty practice on the laws of the American legislatures. For the most  trifling reasons, and sometimes for no conceivable reason at all, his majesty has rejected laws of the most salutary tendency. The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire in those colonies where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state. But previous to the infranchisement of the slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations from Africa. Yet our repeated attempts to effect this by prohibitions, and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition, have been hitherto defeated by his majesty’s negative: thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few British corsairs to the lasting interests of the American states, and to the rights of human nature deeply wounded by this infamous practice. Nay the single interposition of an interested individual against a law was scarcely ever known to fail of success, tho’ in the opposite scale were placed the interests of a whole country. That this is so shameful an abuse of a power trusted with his majesty for other purposes, as if not reformed would call for some legal restrictions.  
With  
  
  
Delaying the consideration of our laws.  
  
equal inattention to the necessities of his people here, has his majesty permitted our laws to lie neglected in England for years, neither confirming them by his assent, nor annulling them by his negative: so that such of them as have no suspending clause, we hold on the most precarious of all tenures, his majesty’s will, and such of them as suspend themselves till his majesty’s assent be obtained we have feared might be called into existence at some future and distant period, when time and change of circumstances shall  
  
Requiring suspending clause to almost every act.  
  
have rendered them destructive to his people here. And to render this grievance still more oppressive, his majesty by his instructions has laid his governors under such restrictions that they can pass no law of any moment unless it have such suspending clause: so that, however immediate may be the call for legislative interposition, the law cannot be executed till it has twice crossed the Atlantic, by which time the evil may have spent it’s whole force.  
But  
  
  
Endeavoring to take from the people the right of representation.  
  
in what terms reconcileable to majesty and at the same time to truth, shall we speak of a late instruction to his majesty’s governor of the colony of Virginia, by which he is forbidden to assent to any law for the division of a county, unless the new county will consent to have no representative in assembly? That colony has as yet affixed no boundary to the Westward. Their Western counties therefore are of indefinite extent. Some of them are actually seated many hundred miles from their Eastern limits. Is it possible then that his majesty can have bestowed a single thought on the situation of those people, who, in order to obtain justice for injuries  however great or small, must, by the laws of that colony, attend their county court at such a distance, with all their witnesses, monthly, till their litigation be determined? Or does his majesty seriously wish, and publish it to the world, that his subjects should give up the glorious right of representation, with all the benefits derived from that, and submit themselves the absolute slaves of his sovereign will? Or is it rather meant to confine the legislative body to their present numbers, that they may be the cheaper bargain whenever they shall become worth a purchase?  
One  
  
  
Dissolution of representative bodies for doing their duty.  
  
of the articles of impeachment against Tresilian and the other judges of Westminster Hall in the reign of Richard the second, for which they suffered death as traitors to their country, was that they had advised the king that he might dissolve his parliament at any time: and succeeding kings have adopted the opinion of these unjust judges. Since the establishment however of the British constitution at the glorious  
  
On further enquiry I find two instances of dissolutions before the parl. would of itself have been at an end, viz. the parl. called to meet Aug. 24. 1698. was dissolved by K. Wm. Dec. 19. 1700. &amp; a new one called to meet Feb. 6. 1701. which was also dissolved Nov. 11. 1701. &amp; a new one met Dec. 30. 1701.  
  
Revolution on it’s free and antient principles, neither his majesty nor his ancestors have exercised such a power of dissolution in the island of Great Britain; and when his majesty was petitioned by the united voice of his people there to dissolve the present parliament, who had become obnoxious to them, his ministers were heard to declare in open parliament that his majesty possessed no such power by the constitution. But how different their language and his practice here! To declare as their duty required the known rights of their country, to oppose the usurpation of every foreign judicature, to disregard the imperious mandates of a minister or governor, have been the avowed causes of dissolving houses of representatives in America. But if such powers be really vested in his majesty, can he suppose they are there placed to awe the members from such purposes as these? When the representative body have lost the confidence of their constituents, when they have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights, when they have assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their hands, then indeed their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the state, and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution. Such being the causes for which the representative body should and should not be dissolved, will it not appear strange to an unbiassed observer that that of Great Britain was not dissolved, while those of the colonies have repeatedly incurred that sentence?  
But  
  
  
Delaying to issue writs for choice of new representatives.  
  
your majesty or your Governors have carried this power beyond every limit known or provided for by the laws. After dissolving one house of representatives, they have refused to call  another, so that for a great length of time the legislature provided by the laws has been out of existence. From the nature of things, every society must at all times possess within itself the sovereign powers of legislation. The feelings of human nature revolt against the supposition of a state so situated as that it may not in any emergency provide against dangers which perhaps threaten immediate ruin. While those bodies are in existence to whom the people have delegated the powers of legislation, they alone possess and may exercise those powers. But when they are dissolved by the lopping off one or more of their branches, the power reverts to the people, who may use it to unlimited extent, either assembling together in person, sending deputies, or in any other way they may think proper. We forbear to trace consequences further; the dangers are conspicuous with which this practice is replete.  
That  
  
  
Undertaking to grant lands on advanced terms.  
  
we shall at this time also take notice of an error in the nature of our landholdings, which crept in at a very early period of our settlement. The introduction of the Feudal tenures into the kingdom of England, though antient, is well enough understood to set this matter in a proper light. In the earlier ages of the Saxon settlement feudal holdings were certainly altogether unknown, and very few, if any, had been introduced at the time of the Norman conquest. Our Saxon ancestors held their lands, as they did their personal property, in absolute dominion, disencumbered with any superior, answering nearly to the nature of those possessions which the Feudalists term Allodial: William the Norman first introduced that system generally. The lands which had belonged to those who fell in the battle of Hastings, and in the subsequent insurrections of his reign, formed a considerable proportion of the lands of the whole kingdom. These he granted out, subject to feudal duties, as did he also those of a great number of his new subjects, who by persuasions or threats were induced to surrender them for that purpose. But still much was left in the hands of his Saxon subjects, held of no superior, and not subject to feudal conditions. These therefore by express laws, enacted to render uniform the system of military defence, were made liable to the same military duties as if they had been feuds: and the Norman lawyers soon found means to saddle them also with all the other feudal burthens. But still they had not been surrendered to the king, they were not derived from his grant, and therefore they were not holden of him. A general principle indeed was introduced that ‘all lands in England were held either mediately or immediately of the crown’: but this was borrowed from those holdings which were truly feudal,  and only applied to others for the purposes of illustration. Feudal holdings were therefore but exceptions out of the Saxon laws of possession, under which all lands were held in absolute right. These therefore still form the basis or groundwork of the Common law, to prevail wheresoever the exceptions have not taken place. America was not conquered by William the Norman, nor it’s lands surrendered to him or any of his successors. Possessions there are undoubtedly of the Allodial nature. Our ancestors however, who migrated hither, were laborers, not lawyers. The fictitious principle that all lands belong originally to the king, they were early persuaded to beleive real, and accordingly took grants of their own lands from the crown. And while the crown continued to grant for small sums and on reasonable rents, there was no inducement to arrest the error and lay it open to public view. But his majesty has lately taken on him to advance the terms of purchase and of holding to the double of what they were, by which means the acquisition of lands being rendered difficult, the population of our country is likely to be checked. It is time therefore for us to lay this matter before his majesty, and to declare that he has no right to grant lands of himself. &gt;From the nature and purpose of civil institutions, all the lands within the limits which any particular society has circumscribed around itself, are assumed by that society, and subject to their allotment only. This may be done by themselves assembled collectively, or by their legislature to whom they may have delegated sovereign authority: and, if they are allotted in neither of these ways, each individual of the society may appropriate to himself such lands as he finds vacant, and occupancy will give him title.  
That,  
  
  
Sending armed troops among us.  
  
in order to inforce the arbitrary measures before complained of, his majesty has from time to time sent among us large bodies of armed forces, not made up of the people here, nor raised by the authority of our laws. Did his majesty possess such a right as this, it might swallow up all our other rights whenever he should think proper. But his majesty has no right to land a single armed man on our shores; and those whom he sends here are liable to our laws for the suppression and punishment of Riots, Routs, and unlawful assemblies, or are hostile bodies invading us in defiance of law. When in the course of the late war it became expedient that a body of Hanoverian troops should be brought over for the defence of Great Britain, his majesty’s grandfather, our late sovereign, did not pretend to introduce them under any authority he possessed. Such a measure would have given just alarm to his subjects in  Great Britain, whose liberties would not be safe if armed men of another country, and of another spirit, might be brought into the realm at any time without the consent of their legislature. He therefore applied to parliament who passed an act for that purpose, limiting the number to be brought in and the time they were to continue. In like manner is his majesty restrained in every part of the empire. He possesses indeed the executive power of the laws in every state; but they are the laws of the particular state which he is to administer within that state, and not those of any one within the limits of another. Every state must judge for itself the number of armed men which they may safely trust among them, of whom they are to  
  
  
Making military superior to civil power.  
  
consist, and under what restrictions they are to be laid. To render these proceedings still more criminal against our laws, instead of subjecting the military to the civil power, his majesty has expressly made the civil subordinate to the military. But can his majesty thus put down all law under his feet? Can he erect a power superior to that which erected himself? He has done it indeed by force; but let him remember that force cannot give right.  
That these are our grievances which we have thus laid before his majesty with that freedom of language and sentiment which becomes a free people, claiming their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate. Let those flatter, who fear: it is not an American art. To give praise where it is not due, might be well from the venal, but would ill beseem those who are asserting the rights of human nature. They know, and will therefore say, that kings are the servants, not the proprietors of the people. Open your breast Sire, to liberal and expanded thought. Let not the name of George the third be a blot in the page of history. You are surrounded by British counsellors, but remember that they are parties. You have no ministers for American affairs, because you have none taken from among us, nor amenable to the laws on which they are to give you advice. It behoves you therefore to think and to act for yourself and your people. The great principles of right and wrong are legible to every reader: to pursue them requires not the aid of many counsellors. The whole art of government consists in the art of being honest. Only aim to do your duty, and mankind will give you credit where you fail. No longer persevere in sacrificing the rights of one part of the empire to the inordinate desires of another: but deal out to all equal and impartial right. Let no act be passed by any one legislature which may infringe on the rights and liberties of another. This is the important post in which fortune has placed you,   holding the balance of a great, if a well poised empire. This, Sire, is the advice of your great American council, on the observance of which may perhaps depend your felicity and future fame, and the preservation of that harmony which alone can continue both to Great Britain and America the reciprocal advantages of their connection. It is neither our wish nor our interest to separate from her. We are willing on our part to sacrifice every thing which reason can ask to the restoration of that tranquility for which all must wish. On their part let them be ready to establish union on a generous plan. Let them name their terms, but let them be just. Accept of every commercial preference it is in our power to give for such things as we can raise for their use, or they make for ours. But let them not think to exclude us from going to other markets, to dispose of those commodities which they cannot use, nor to supply those wants which they cannot supply. Still less let it be proposed that our properties within our own territories shall be taxed or regulated by any power on earth but our own. The god who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time: the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them. This, Sire, is our last, our determined resolution: and that you will be pleased to interpose with that efficacy which your earnest endeavors may insure to procure redress of these our great grievances, to quiet the minds of your subjects in British America against any apprehensions of future incroachment, to establish fraternal love and harmony thro’ the whole empire, and that that may continue to the latest ages of time, is the fervent prayer of all British America

croachm-ais and uſurpations, attempted t  
be made by the legiſlature of one part  
the empire, upon thoſe rights which Ce  
and the laws have given equally and ind(  
pendently to all. To repreſent to his m  
jeſty, that theſe his ſtates have often ind  
vidually made humble application to  
imperial throne, to obtain, through its i  
tervention, ſome redreſs of their injur  
rights, to none of which was ever even  
anſwer condeſcended : humbly to he  
that this their joint addreſs, penned int  
language of truth, and diveſted of thoſe &amp;  
preſſions of ſervility which would perſuz  
his majeſty that we are aſking favours,  
not rights, ſhall obtain from his majelt  
more reſpectful acceptance. And this  
majeſty will think we have reaſon to  
pect, when he reflects that he is no m  
than the chief officer of the people,  
pointed by the laws, and circumſcn  
with definite powers, to aſſiſt in wor  
the great machine of government, ere  
for their uſe, and conſequently ſubject  
  
their ſuperintendance. And in ordert

eſe our rights, as well as the invaſions of  
hem, may be laid more fully before his  
mieſty, to take a view of them from the  
wigin and firſt ſettlement of theſe coun-  
tnes. |  
  
To remind him, that our anceſtors, &#x27;be-  
fore their emigration to America, were the  
fee inhabitants of the Britiſh dominions in  
Europe, and poſſeſſed a right which nature  
Is given to all men, of departing from  
te country in which chance, not choice,  
lus placed them; of going in queſt of new  
ubitations, and of. there eſtabliſhing new  
cities, under ſuch laws and regulations  
o them (hall ſeem moſt likely to pro-  
note public happineſs. That their Saxon  
mceſtors had, under this univerſal law, in  
Ike manner left their native wilds and  
Foods in the north of Europe; had poſſeſſed  
liemſelyes of the iſland of Britain, then leſs  
Marged with inhabitants, and had eſta-  
liſhed there that ſyſtem of laws which has  
b long been the glory and protection of  
lut country. Nor was ever any claim of  
etiority or dependence aſſerted over  
lem by that mother country from which  
B 2 they  
  
  
  
1  
they bad migrated ; and were ſuch a claig  
made, it is believed that his majeſty&#x27;s ſy  
jects in Great Britain have too firm a fee  
ing of the rights derived to them fro  
  
their anceſtors, to bow down the  
vereignty to their ſtate before ſuch vii  
nary pretenſions. And it is thought th at  
no circumſtance has occurred to ditungui 1  
materially the Britiſh from the Saxon em  
gration. America was conquered, and He.  
ſettlements made, and firmly eſtabliſſ e  
at the expence of individuals, and not wo  
the Britiſh public. Their own blood w 3  
ſpilt in acquiring lands for their ſettleme 4  
their own fortunes expended in maki Ir  
that ſettlement effectual; for theme! 9  
they fought, for themſelves they conquete *  
and for themſelves alone they have rig hab  
to hold. Not a ſhilling was ever iflu *  
from the public treaſures of his majeliy, [tit]  
his anceſtors, for their aſſiſtance, till of ve ul;  
late times, after the colonies had beco 1  
eſtabliſhed on a firm and permanent footi in  
That then, indeed, having become valual het  
  
to Great Britain for her commercial purpo  
  
his parliament was pleaſed to lend them

ance againſt an enemy, who would fain  
we drawn to herſelf the benefits of their  
wmmerce, to the great aggrandizement of  
berſelf, and danger of Great Britain. Such  
filtance, and in ſuch circumſtances, they  
ad often before given to Portugal, and  
ther allied ſtates, with whom they carry  
ma commercial intercourſe ; yet theſe  
lates never ſuppoſed, that by calling in  
ter aid, they thereby ſubmitted themſelves  
þ her ſovereignty. Had ſuch terms been  
wpoſed, they would have rejected them  
uch diſdain, and truſted for better to the  
doderation of their enemies, or to a vi-  
us exertion of their own force, We  
b not, however, mean to under-rate  
loſe aids, which to us were doubtleſs va-  
able, on whatever principles granted;  
uwe would ſhew that they cannot give  
title to that authority which the Britiſh  
lament would arrogate over us, and  
at they may amply be repaid by our  
Ping to the inhabitants of Great Britain  
Kh excluſive privileges in trade as may  
Rudvantageous to them, and at the ſame

ſettlements having been thus effected in  
the wilds of America, the emigrants  
thought proper to adopt that ſyſtem of  
laws under which they had hitherto lived  
in the mother country, and to continue  
  
their union with her by ſubmitting them-  
ſelves to the ſame common ſovereign, wh  
  
ing the ſeveral parts of the empire thu  
newly multiplied.  
  
But that not long were they permitted  
however far they thought themſelves re

at the hazard of their lives, and loſs

ale the cauſe of their nullity ; but to  
hew that experience confirms the pro-  
wrety of thoſe political principles which  
exempt us from the juriſdiftion of the  
Britiſh parliament. The true ground on  
which we declare theſe aQs void is, that  
the Britiſh parliament has no right to ex-  
reiſe authority over us.  
  
That theſe exerciſes of uſurped power  
ue not been confined to inſtances alone,  
n which themſelves were intereſted, but  
hey have alſo intermeddled with the re-  
mation of the internal affairs of the co-

vciting the ſame cenſures, the ſeveral co-  
hajes have already proteſted,  
  
That theſe are the acts of power, aſ-  
med by a body of men, foreign to our  
mſtitutions, and unacknowledged by our  
ins, againſt which we do, on behalf of  
de inhabitants of Britiſh America, enter

mich, however nugatory they be, may

That we next proceed to conſider the  
duct of his majeſty, as holding the ex-  
Kutive powers of the laws of theſe ſtates,  
ud mark out his deviations from the line  
duty: By the conſtitution of Great  
ditain, as well as of the ſeveral American  
lates, his majeſty poſſeſſes the power of  
iuling to paſs into a law any bill which  
k:lready paſſed the other two branches

ad his anceſtors, conſcious of the impro-  
  
priety  
  
[ 28 ]  
priety of oppoſing their fingle opinion te  
the united wiſdom of two houſes of par  
lament, while their proceedings were un  
biafſed by intereſted principles, for ſevera  
ages paſt have modeſtly declined the ex  
erciſe of this power in that part of hi  
empire called Great Britain. But b  
change of circumſtances, other principle  
than thoſe of juſtice ſimply have obtainet  
an influence on their determinations; th  
addition of new ſtates to the Britiſh empirt  
has produced an addition of new, an  
ſometimes oppoſite intereſts. It is no-  
therefore, the great office of his majelt  
to reſume the exerciſe of his negatiy  
power, and to prevent the paſſage of lau  
by any one legiflature of the empire  
which might bear injuriouſly on th  
rights and intereſts of another. Ye  
this will not excuſe the wanton exer  
ciſe of this power which we have ee  
his majeſty practiſe on the laws of th  
American legiſlatures. For the mol  
trifling reaſons, and ſometimes f

the glorious revolution, on its free at

his anceſtors have exerciſed ſuch a poy  
of diſſolution in the iſland of Great

med to themſelves powers which the

Wngerous to the ſtate, and calls for an ex-  
geiſe of the power of diſſolution. Such

plete.  
  
That we ſhall, at this time alſo, take  
notice of an error in the nature of our  
ind holdings, which crept in at a very  
arly period of our ſettlement. The in-  
roduction of the feudal tenures into the  
tingdom of England, tho&#x27; antient, is well  
enough underſtood to ſet this matter in a  
proper light. In the earlier ages of the  
axon ſettlement, feudal holdings were  
ertainly altogether unknown; and very  
kw, if any, had been introduced at the  
lime of the Norman conqueſt. Our Saxon  
mceſtors held their lands, as they did  
beit perſonal property, in abſolute domi-  
won, diſencumbered with any ſuperior,  
ulwering nearly to the nature of thoſe  
plleflions which the feudaliſts term allo-  
dal, William, the Norman, firſt intro-  
tced that ſyſtem generally. The lands,  
wich had belonged to thoſe who fell in  
be battle of Haſtings, and in the ſubſe-  
Wat inſurrections of his reign, formed a  
con-  
  
—  
  
1  
conſiderable proportion of the lands of the  
whole kingdom. Theſe he granted out,  
ſubject to feudal duties, as did he alf  
thoſe of a great number of his neu ſub-  
jects, who, by perſuaſions, or threats, were  
induced to ſurrender them for that pur-  
pole. But ſtill much was left in the  
hands of his Saxon ſubjects ; held of no  
ſuperior, and not ſubject to feudal condi-  
tions. Theſe, therefore, by expreſs laws,  
enacted to render uniform the ſyſtem of mi-  
litarydefence, were made liable to the ſame  
military duties as if they had been feuds;  
and the Norman lawyers ſoon found means  
to ſaddle them alſo with all the other teu  
dal burthens. But till they had not bee  
ſurrendered to the king ; they were not  
derived from his grant, and therefore the  
  
were not holden of him. A general prin  
ciple, indeed, was introduced, that «y  
lands in England, were held either me  
diately, or immediately of the crown;  
but this was borrowed from thoſe hold  
ings, which were truly feudal, and on)  
applied to others for the purpoſes of illul  
  
tration  
  
*  
  
.. Feudal holdings werey therefore  
oreptions out of the Saxon laws vf  
on, under which all lands were  
  
m the baſis or gfound-work of the  
mon law, to prevail whereſoever the  
tions have not taken place. Ame-

tan, nor its lands ſurrendered to him,

try is likely to be checked. It is ti  
therefore, for us to lay this matter be  
his majeſty, and to declare that he ha  
right to grant lands of himſelf. From  
nature and purpoſe of civil inſtitution  
the lands within the limits, which

itſelf, are aſſumed. by that ſociety,

ſable to our laws made for the ſuppreſſion  
nd putiſhment of riots,” touts, and un-  
lwful aſſemblies; or, are hoſtile bodies,  
mading us in defiance of law. When,  
h the courſe of the late war, it became  
upedient that a body of Hanoverian troops  
would be brought over for the defence of  
breit Britain, his maſeſty&#x27;s grandfather,

MaffiKhufetts-Day, in North-America,” which was palled at  
the last feflion oft he Dritilh parliament ; a large and popu­  
lous town, whose trade was their foie lubfiftence, was deprived  
of&#x27; that trade, and involved in utter ruin. Let u* for a while  
luppnfe the question of right fulpended, in o dcr to examine  
this aft nn principles of juflice : An aft of parliament had  
been palled finu-ding duties on teas to be paid in America, a­  
ga nil which aft trie Americans bad proteflcd as inauthorita  
tive. The EaA-Indu Company, who till that time had nevei  
sent a pound of tea to America on tlieir own account, slept  
forth on that mxifion, the alftiJers of psj&#x27;»tnertary right, and  
fend hither many /hip leads cf that obnnxiou* Commodity.  
Th- matters of their several vcfiels, however, OH their arrival  
in America, wifely attended to admonition, and returned with  
their cargoes. In the province ot New-I-ng-snd alone, the  
remonftraners of the people were difregwled, arid a compli­  
ance, after being many days waited for, wa» flatly lefuf-d.  
Wbether-in this, tire miiler «f the veflel wi* governed by his  
übflinacy, or hi* inflruftion;, let thole who know, fay. Tl ere  
are extraordinary lituatinns, which require extraordinary in­  
lerpafition*. An exaipeiared people, who feel that they pofi­  
ieU power, arc nor easily retrained within limits ftrickly regu­  
lar. A number of them aflemb-ed in the town of Boston,  
&#x27; th&quot; ar Ure tra into the vcean, and d fperfed, without doing any  
other aft of violence. If in this tlwy did wrong, they were  
known, and amen able to the hwsof the land, against which  
it could nut be objefted tbst they ever had, in any Laitance,  
been obflrufted or divcred from their regular course, in favou:  
of popular eft&#x27;-rdr-s. They should ’herefoie net have been  
-diffruftrd on this occasion. But that ill-fated cclony, hid for­  
merly been bold in their enmities against the heme of Stuart,  
and were now devoted to ruin by that unseen hand, which go­  
verns the momentous affairs of this great empire. On the  
partial repiefcntMion* of a few worthless minifleriai dependants  
wimfe corftant office it has been to keep that gov-rnment  
embroiled, and who, by their treacheries, hope to obtain the  
dignity of the British knighthood, without calling for the par­  
ty accused, without a/king a proof, without attempting a dif­  
tinftion between the guilty and the innocent, Use whole of  
that ancieat, and wealthy town, is in a moment reduced from  
Oiul&#x27;nce to beggary. Men who had spent their lives in ex­  
tending the British commerce, who fo&lt;« inverted in that place  
the wealth theii honest endeavours had merited, found them­  
selves and their fam-lies thrown at once en tbe world, for fub­  
fiflenee by its charities. Not the hundredth part of the in­  
hobitm’s of that town had been concerned in the aft com­  
plained of, many of them were in Great-Britain aid in other  
parts beyond fra, yet ail were involved its one indiferiminat;  
ruin, by a new executive pourer unbesrd of tiff then, that ot

lions of money, was facrificed to revenge, not repay thefofsof  
a few thoufandc. This is administering jurt&#x27;ce with a heavy  
band indeed I and when is this tempest to be arrefled in its  
couife ? Two wharves are (n be opened again when hisMajefly

laliing infamy now fixed on the autlwrs of the aft I A claute  
for a fimiiar purpafe had been introduced into an aft passed i.s  
the 12th year 01 hi* m.jefty’s reign, entitled “An aft for the  
better securing ai.d preserving his majefty&#x27;t dockyards,  
zinesjhips, ammunition and lkire*,&#x27;’atpHnit wh ch, a* meriting  
the fame censures, the several colonies have already protelkd-  
That these are aft* of pov.er, assumed by a body of men,,  
foreign to ourconffitutions, and unacknowledged by our lava,  
against which we do, on behalf of the inhabitant* of Briulh  
America, enter this rar solemn and determined protest ; and  
that we do eameftly entreat tie Majefly, as yet the only media­  
tory power between the several rtate* of the British empire, to  
• lecommend to his parliament of Gre*tßritain the total revoca­  
, tiun ofthufe afts, which however nugatory they be, may yet  
&lt; prove the cause of further difeontents and jeilouftes among us.  
i That we next proceed to confider t e conduft of his majefly,  
as huluing the executive powas of the laws of these Hates:  
and mark out hi* deviation, from the line of duty. By the  
cunf-itution of Great Biiuin, as well as the several American  
states bis majefly pofleffes the power of rdufinf to pals into a  
: law, any bill which has already passed the other two branches  
jof legillature. His majefly Lowever, and his ancestors, con­  
. feious ufthe impropriety ofoppufing their Angle opinion to  
. the united witdom to the two houfesof parliament, while their  
proceedings were unbiafled by intereftrd principles, for several  
ages past, have modeflly declined the exercise of this power, in  
1 that part of hi* empirecalled Great Britain—But by ctrange  
of circumstances, other principles than those of juttice limply,  
have obtained an influence on their determinations; the »d­  
---ditionof new slates to the British empire has produced.an ad­  
dition of new, and fometitnes opposite in ter efl r. It is now,  
therefore, the greatefl office othis majefly, to relume theex­  
ercifc of his negative power, and to prevent the passing of  
laws by any one legillature of the empire, which might bear  
injuriously on the right* and intereffs of another. Yet thi*  
willnut excuse the wanton cxacife of thi* power, which we  
have seen his majefly piaftice on the law* of tl.eAmeikan le­  
g flarurcs. For the most tiifling reafon* and fometimesfor n*  
conceivable reason at&#x27;all, his majefly ha* njefted laws ot the  
moll salutary tendency. The abolition of domefiice flaveiy  
is the greatefl objeft of desire in those colonic*, where it wa*  
unhappily in’roduced in their infant state.—But previous to  
the enfran.h iement of the Haves we Eave, it is neceffaiy to *«•  
dude all farther importations fiom Africa ; yet oufj.-g  
attempts to eft’eft this, by prohibitions, and by imeti / J  
ties which might, amount to a prohibition, have been hit.ier­  
to -iefeated by h s majelly’s negative—Thus preferring the im­  
mediate advantaj-rs of a few Afiicsn corla.n, to the Jailing  
in terr ft of the American Bates, and to the sights of human  
nature, deeply wounded by this infam- us praftice : Nay, the  
Angle ioterpofit&#x27;on of an intercfied individual, against a law,  
wa» scarcely ever known to fail offuccere, though in the op­  
;orite scale were placed the interest of the whole country.  
That tM* i* so fhameful an abufeof* power trufled with hi*  
majefly for other purpufes, a* if not reformed, would call for  
feme legal reflnftlons. [Te be eettinued.

Rrr.OI.YED, that it be .an ioflnnffion to the  
find deputies, when aiTtinbled in geneial con­  
greft with tU. deputies from the other dates of  
Britifh America, to propofe to the ftid ccngrcfs  
that an bumble and dutiful addrefs he prefcated  
to his liMicii \, I legging leave to lay before him,  
as chief niagiferale of the Britifh empire, the u­  
niUil complaints of his majefly’s fuhjects in A­  
mcriea ; complaints which are excited by ma­  
ny unwarrantable encroachments and ufurpati­  
ons, attempted to be m.adi by the legi.Mat lire of  
one part of the empire, upon thofc rights which  
Gin! anti the laws have given equally and inde­  
pendently to all. To rcprefciit to his tnajeliy  
that thefe his dates have often individually nude  
humble application to his imperial throne to  
obtain, through its intervention, feme red refs  
of their injured rights, to none of which was e­  
vrr even an attfwer oonucfeendtd ; humbly to  
hope that this their joint addrefs, penned in the  
language oftruth, and diverted of tbofe expref­  
fians of fereility which would perfuade his ma­  
jdVvthat we are atking favours, arid not rights,  
Hull obtain from his majefty a more refpeflful  
acceptance. And this liis majefty will think we  
have reafon to &quot;xpeft when he reflects that he is  
no more than the chief officer of the people, ap­  
pointed hy the laws, and ciivumferibed with  
definite powers, toaiTirt in working the great  
machine of government, ereded for their ufe,  
and confequently fabjed to their fupriinteud­  
ance. And in order that thefe our rights, a*  
Well as tiie invafions of them, may he laid more  
fully before his majefty. to lake a view of tiwn  
from thcoric .1 and firft fettlement of thefe coun­  
tries.  
To remind him that our anceftors, before  
their emigration to America, were the free inha­  
bitants of the Britifh dominions in Europe, and  
poilefud a right which natuc has given to all  
men, of departing from the country in which  
chance,not choice, has placed them, of going  
in queft of at w habitations, Sc of there tflahhlhi  
ing new focitties, under fuch laws and regulati­  
ons as to them fti.dl feem nioft likely to promote  
public, happinefs. That their Saxon anccflors  
had, under tins univerfal law, in iike manner  
felt their native wilds ami woods in the north of  
Europe, had pofTefted thcmfelvcs of the ifland  
of Britain, then lefs charged with inhabitants,  
and had eftiblifhed there that fyltem of Jaws  
which has foiong been the glory and protection  
of that country. Nor was ever any claim of  
  
nuu.ym uepenueucc aiiencci over them  
by that Mother country from which they had  
migrated ; and were fticli a claim made, it is be­  
ved that hit majehy’s fubjeils in Great Bri­  
tain have too firm a feeling of the rights derived  
tot&#x27;.iem from their anceftors, to 1. .w down the  
fovercignty of their ftatc before fuch vifionarv  
pretcnfiuus. And it i.; thought that no circum­  
fiancc has occurred to diltinguifti materially the  
Uritifh from the Saxon emigration. America  
was conquered, and her fettlement* made, and  
firmly eltablifiled, at the expence of individuals,  
a’id not of the Britifli public. Their own blood  
was fpilt in acquiring land: fur their fettlement,  
their own fortunes expended in making that  
fettlement effectual; for themfelves they fought,  
for themfelves they conquered, and for them­  
wives alone thev have right to hold. No ihil­  
ling was ever ilfued from the public treafures of  
hismajeff y, or his anccflors, for their affiitance,  
till of very iate times, after the colonic* had bt&gt;  
coaie eltablithed on a firm and permanent foot-,  
ihg. That then, indeed, having become valua­  
ble to Great Britain for her commercial purpo­  
f s, his parliament was pi*. ifed to h nd them af­  
liftance againft an enemy, who would fain have  
draw* to he if*-If the benefit* of their commerce,  
to the great ajrgr andizement of herfclf, and dan­  
prr of Great Britain. Such affifiance, and in!  
  
liicfi cmcumita ices, they had often before given  
to other allied Rates, with whom they carry on &#x27;  
a commercial interconrfe ; yet thefe’ ft itcs nr- !  
verfnppnf d, that by calling in her aid, they *  
thereby fubmitted themfelvesto her fnvereigmy. j  
Had f*;ch terms been propofed, they would have !  
rejected them with ihfdain, and trotted for bed-&#x27;  
ter to the moderation of t&#x27;r.cir enemies, or to r  
vigorous exertion of their own force. We do  
rot, however, mean to under-rate thofe aids  
which lo nr were doubt left v.alur.bl-, on w’rt&#x27;c­  
ver prhiciples g-■anted; but we would fht’vthat  
they cannot give a title to that authority which  
the Britiri, parliament would arrogate over 113,  
and that they may amply b repaid hy our giv­  
ing to.llie &#x27;inhabitant* of Great Britain fuel, ex­  
cluftve privileges in trade as may lie advantage,  
otv to them, and at the fame time not too ref  
tri five to ourf. lves. That fcttlementg having  
lie; n * in ffTeflcl in the wilds of Arntitca, file  
emigrants thought proper fo adopt that fyftrm  
of laws under which they had hitherto lived In  
the mother country, ami to cont nue their uiti­  
mi with lur hy full,.lilting thernfclvet. to the  
tune common fovcrdgn, who w.m thereby  
made the central link connecting the ftvtra)  
pa-tr. of the empire tliu# newly multiplied.  
But that not long were they permitted, how­  
ever far they thought thcmfdves removed from  
the hand of opprg&#x27;fion, to hold nndiflurbcd the  
rig’ is thus acquire if, at the hazard of their lives,  
and l.ifs oftheir fortunes. A family of princes  
wa» then on the Britify throne, whole treafon­  
able crime# aguit.lt th&lt; ir people brought on them  
afterwards the exertion of tliofg facred and fo­  
vci-rigr, rights of punifhmtnf referved in the  
b mds nf the prop!.&#x27; for cafes of extreme reccfli  
ty, and j.ulgrd by.the conttitution itnfnfe to be  
delegated to anv other judicature. While eve­  
ry day brought fix th finWlc new and juttiHahle  
exertion of power ovu their ftihjerts on that lid,  
tuc water, it was „ to be expend that thofr  
  
here, much left able at that litne to oppofc the!  
defigns of dcfputifin, ihould be exempted from j  
injury.  
Accordingly that country, which had hern  
acquired by the lives, the labours, ami the for­  
tunes, of individual adventurers, was by thefc  
princes, at feveral times, parcelled out and dif­  
tributed among the favourites and (a) follow­  
ers of their fortunes, and, by an all timed right of  
the crown alone, was erected into diftimtt and  
independent governments ; a mcafure which it  
is believed his majefty’s prudence and under­  
(landing would prevent hun from imitating at  
this day, as no cxcrcife of fuch a power, of di­  
viding and difmembering a country, has ever  
occurred in his majefty’s realm of England,  
though now of very anticut (landing ; nor could  
it bejnftified oracquiefdkd under there, or in a­  
ny other part of his maiefty’s empire.  
&#x27;Hint the cxcrcife of a free trade with all parts  
of the world, poflefTed hy the American colo­  
nifts, as&#x27; of natural right, and which no law of  
their own had taken away er abridged, was next  
the obiedt of unjuft encroachment. Some of  
the colonies having thought proper to conti­  
nue the admit.iftration of their government in  
the name and under the authority 6f his majefty  
king Charles the firft, whom, uotwithftanding  
his late depofition hy the commonwealth of  
England, they continued in the fovereignty of  
their ftate ; the parliament for the common­  
wealth took the fame in high offence, and afluiii­  
ed upon thcmfelves the power of prohibiting  
their trade with all other parts of the world, ex­  
cept theifl.Mid of Great Britain. This arbitra­  
i ry ;n51, however, they foon recalled, and by fo­  
I lemn treaty, entered into on the 12th day of  
March, 1051, between the faid commonwealth  
by their commiffioners, and the colony of Vir­  
ginia by their houfe of burgefles, it was expreff­  
lv ftipnlated, by the 8th article of the faid trea­  
ty, that they mould have “ free trade as the  
| people of England do enjoy to all places and  
! with all nations, according to the laws of that  
j commonwealth.” Out that, upon the reflora­  
; tion of his maiefty king Charles the fecund,  
j their rights of free commerce fell once more  
; a victim to arbitrary power; and by ftveral  
| a efts (b) of his reign, as well as of foiue of  
his focceffors, the trade of the colonies was  
i &lt;id under fuch rellritflions, as thew what hopes  
; they might form from the juftiee of a Britilb  
parliament, were its uncontrouled power ad­  
mitted over tbefe ftates. Hiftory has informed  
us that bodies of men, as well as individuals,;  
are fufceptible of the fpirit of tyranny. A view  
of tlufe acts of parliament for regulation, as it  
has been r.fieiftcd.&#x27;y called, of the American trade,  
ital! other evidence were removed out of the  
cafe, would undeniably evince the truth of this  
obfervation. Befidcs t!&gt;e duties they impofe  
on our articles of export ar.d import, they pro­  
hibit our going to any markets northward of  
Cape Fincfterre, in the kingdom of Spain, for  
the file of commodities which Great Britain  
wii! not take from us, and for the purchafe of  
others, with which (lie cannot fupply us, and  
that t^r no other than the arbitrary purpofe of  
purenafing tor tbemfelves, by a facrifiee of our  
rights and iniereilM, certain privileges in their  
commerce with an allied date, who in confi­  
denev that their exclulive trade with America  
will be continued, while the principles and  
pi v,\.r of the Brivifii parliament be the fame,  
have indulged tbemfelves in every exorbitance  
which their avarice could didate, or our neeefli- !  
ties extort ; haveraifed their commodities, ca!-&#x27;  
led for in America, to the double and treble’ of  
what they fold for before fuch cxclufive privile­  
ges were given them, and of what better com­  
modities of the fame kind would colt us elfe­  
where, and at the fame time give us much lefs  
for what we carry thither than might be had at  
more convenient ports. That thefc a«3s proht-i  
bit us from carrying in queft of other purcha- -

ed ; fr» that we inuft leave them with the Britilh  
merchant for whatever he will plcafe to allow  
us, to be by him refhipped to foreign markets,  
where he will reap the benefits of making fale  
of them for full value. That to heighten ftill  
the idea of parliamentary juftiee, and to (hew  
with what moderation they are like to exercife

[COXCIVUE D.]  
That thus have we haftened through the  
reigns which preceded his majefty’s, during  
which the violations of our right were lefs alarm­  
ing, bccaufe repeated at more diftnnt intervals  
than that rapid and bold fucccllion of injuries  
which is likely to diftinguith the prefcnt from  
all other periods of American ftory. Scarcely  
have our minds been able to emerge from the  
aitonifiuncnt into which one ftroke of parlia­  
mentary thunder has involved ns, before another  
more heavy, and more alarming, is fallen on us.  
Single adts of tyranny may be aferibed to the  
accidental opinion of a day ; but a fericsof op­  
preflions, begun at a diftinguifiied period, and  
purfued unalterably through every change of  
xninifters, too plainly prove a deliberate and fyf­  
tematical plan of reducing us to flavery.

no anfwcrs having yet been condefeended to a­

Sut that one other aft (e) parted in the fame I  
7th year of his reign, having been a peculiar at- i  
tempt, mutt ever require peculiar mention ; it  
is intituled “ An aft for fufpending the legifla- 1

ent legiflature hereby takes upon itfelf to ftif- \
pend the powers of another, fice and independ­  
ent as itfelf; thus exhibiting a phenomenon un­  
known in nature, the creator and creature of its  
own power. Not only the principles of com­  
mon fenfe, but the feelings of human nature,  
muft be furrendered up before his majefly’s fub­  
iefts here can be perfuaded to believe that they  
hold their political exittence at the will of a Bri­  
tifh paitiament. Shall theft governments be  
difiolved, their property annihilated, and their  
people reduced to a ftate of nature, at the im­  
perious breath of a body of men, whom they ne­  
ver fAw, in whom they never confided, and over  
Wtiom they have no powers of punifhment or  
removal, let their crimes againft the American  
public be ever fo great ? Can any one reafon  
ocaffigned why 160,000 eleftors in the ifland of  
Great Britain (honKI give law to four millions  
in the dates of America, every individual of  
whom is equal to every individual of them, in &#x27;

oned the landing and difeharging, lading or (hip­  
ping, of goods, wares, and merchandize, at the  
town and within the harbour of Bnfton, in the  
province of Mart&#x27;ichufetts Bay, in North Ame­  
rica,” which was parted at the laft feffion of,  
Britifh parliament ; a large and populous town, j  
whofe trade was their foie fuhfiftence, was de­  
prived of that trade, and involved in utterruin. ■  
Let us for a while fuppofe the queftion of right &#x27;  
liifpended, in order to examine this aft on prin­  
ciples of juttice : An aft of parliament had been  
patted import ng duties on teas, tobe paid in A­  
merin, againft which aft the Americans had &gt;  
prot. fted as inauthoritative. The Eaft-India .  
company, wha till that time had never fent a I  
pound of tea to America on their own account, i  
frep forth on that occafion the a.Tertor3 of parli- j  
amentary right, and fend hilher many (hip loads i  
of that obnoxious commodity. The nu tters of |  
their feveral vcrtels, however, on their arrival in 1  
America, wifely attend to admonition, and re- j  
turned with their cargoes. In the province of!  
Martachufetts alone the rrmon(trances of the !  
people were di(regarded, and a compliance, af­  
ter being many days waited for, was flatly re­  
rofird. Whether in this the matter of the veSTcl  
was governed by his obftinney, or his inftruftr­  
ons, »et thwfc who know, fay. There are ex­  
traordinary filiations which require extraordi­  
nary interpolation. An exafperated people,  
who fee] that they pofltf; power, are not eali’y  
reftrainrd v\ ithin limits ttriftly regular. A num­  
ber of them artembled in the town of Botton,  
threw the tea into the ocean, and difperfed with­  
out doing any other aft of violence. If in this  
  
tftey did wrong, they were known and were a­  
mcnab’e to the laws of the land, againfl which  
it could not be oh&quot; .sfted that they had ever, in  
any inftance, been obftrufted or diverted from  
their regular conrfe in favour of popular offend­  
er- They thould therefore not have been uif­  
tr.irted on this occafion. But that ill fated co­  
lony had formerly been hold in their enmities a­  
gninft the houfc of Stuart, and were now devot­  
ed to ruin by that unfecn hand which governs  
tlie momentous afTiirs of this great empire. On  
the partial representations of a few worthlefa mi­  
nifterial dependents, whofe conftant office it has  
been tok -ep that government embroiled, and  
who, by t i ir treacheries, hope to obtain the  
dignity ,,f the fg) Britifh nighfbood, without  
calling for a p.irtv accufed, w thout alking a  
proof, without attempting a diftimftion betw.-en  
the guilty and the innocent, the whole of that  
anticnf and wealthy town is in a moment reduc­  
ed f-om opulence to beggary. TVb.-n who had  
fpent their lives in extending the Britifh com­  
mtree, who had inverted in that place tlie wealth  
their hone.t endeavours had merited, found  
thenif.-ivcn and their fsmilits thrown at once on  
the world for fnbfiftenef by its charities. Not  
the hundredth part of the inhabitants of that  
tovn had been concerned in the aft complained  
of ; many of them were in Great Britain and in  
other part.-, beyond fra ; yet all were involved  
in one kid;feriminate ruin, by a new executive  
pow( unheard of till then, that of a Brififfi  
parliament. A property, of the value of many  
rrvflion* of money, was lacriftced to revenge,  
not rep the lots of a few thoufands. This  
ia admirultering juftice with a heavy h»f*\ «...  
deed ! and when is this temped to be arretted  
in ;ts com &lt; 1 Two wharfs are to br opened  
ax m i when hi i maierty fhall think proper. The  
rehJtie which lined ibe -xteiifi/e ffjort&#x27;i of the*  
  
bay of Soft on forever ir.te«Hfted the exer­  
cife of commerce. This little exception feerns  
to have been thrown in for no other pnrpofe  
than that of fetting a precedent f«&gt;r invtCtinghis  
majcfly with Icgiflative powers. If the pti&#x27;fc of  
his people Ih&amp;U heat calmly uml r th»s experi­  
ment, another and another will K. tried, till the !  
’ineafure of defjsotifm he filled up. It would be  
, an infult on common fenfe to pretend that this  
I exception was made in older to re (lore its com­  
merce to that great town. The trade which  
; cannot be received at two wharfs alone mull of  
neceflity be transferred to forne ot her place ; to  
which it will foon be followed hy th.it of the  
two wharf?. Confulered in this light, it would  
besninfblcnt and cruel mockery at the annihila­  
tion of the town of Bofion.  
By the aft (A) for the ftipprcfih&#x27;n of riots and  
tumults in the town of llolton, palled alfo in the  
lalt feflion of parliament, a murder committed  
there is, if the governor pleafes, to he tried in  
the court of King’s Bench, in the illand of Great  
Britain, by a jury of Middlefex. The witnetfes,  
too, on receipt of fuch a fum as the governor  
thall think it reafon ihle for them to expend, are  
to enter into recognizance to appear at the tri­  
al. This is, in other words, taxing them to the  
amount of their recognizance, and that amount  
may be whatever a governor pleafes ; for who  
does his majefty think can he prevailed on to  
crofs the Atlantic for the foie pnrpofe of bear­  
ing evidence to a fact ? His expences are to he  
borne, indeed, as they (hall be eftimated by a  
governor ; but who arc to feed the wife and  
children whom he leaves behind, and who  
have had no other fubfiftcncc but his daily la­  
bour ? Thofe epidemical diforders, too, fo ter­  
rible in a foreign climate, is the cure of them to  
j l»c eftimated among the articles of expence, and  
j their danger to be warded ofFby the almighty  
power of parliament ? And the wretched cri­  
| ininal,if he happen to have offended on the A­  
| merican fide, Gripped of his privilege of trial hy  
| piers of his vicinage, removed from the place  
where alone full evidence could lie obtained,  
without money, without counfel, without  
friends, without exculpatory proof, is tried be­  
fore judges predetermined to condemn. The  
cowards who would fuffcv a countryman to be  
torn from the bowels of their fociety, in order  
to be thus offered a facrifice to patliamentaiy  
tyranny, would merrit that tveriafting infamy  
now fixed on the authors of the aft ! A cUufe  
  
(i) tor a imular purpotc had been introduced  
into an a£t, pa fled in the 10th year of his majef­  
ty’s reign, intituled “ An ait for the better fe­  
curing and preferving his majefty’# dockyards,  
magazines, fhips, ammunition, and ftores a­  
gainft which, as meriting the fame cenfir es,the  
feveral colonies have already proteflcd.  
That thefe are the aits of power, aflumed by  
a body of men, foreign to onr conflitutious, and  
unacknowledged by ourk&#x27;ws, Againft which we  
do, on behalf of the inhabitants of Britifli Ame­  
rica, enter this our fcilemn and determined pro­  
tefl; and we do earneflly entreat his majefty, as  
yet the only mediatory power between the fcvc­  
ral flates of the Britifli empire, to recommend to  
his parliament of Great Britain the total revoca­  
tion of thefe ails, which, however nugatory  
they be, may yet prove the caufe of further dis­  
contents and jtnloufics among us.  
That we next proceed to contidcr the con­  
duit of his majefty, ar. holding the executive  
powers of the laws of thefe ftates, and mark out  
his deviations from the line of duty: By the  
conflitution of Great Britain, as well as of the  
feveral American ftates, his majefty pofTcfles the  
power of refuting to pafs into a law any bill  
which lias already pa fled the other two branch­  
es of legiflature. His majefty, however, and his  
anceftors, confcious of the impropriety of op­  
poling their fingle opinion to the united wifdom  
nf.JOMrliaungiJt, while their pro­  
ples, for feveral ages pall have modeftly dedinl  
ed the exercife of this power in that part of his  
empire called Great Britain. But by change of  
Ctrenmftancrs, other principles than thofe ofjuf­  
tice (imply have obtained aninfluenceon their de­  
terminations ; the addition of new ftates to the  
Britilh empire has produced an addition of new,  
and fbmctiir.es oppofitc intcrefts. It is now,  
therefore, the great oflicc of his majefty, to re­  
lume the excrciie of h.s negative power, and to  
prevent the paflage of laws by any one legiflature  
or the empire, which might bear injurionfly on  
the rights and interefts of another. Yet this  
will not excufe the wanton exercife of this pow­  
er which we have feen his majefty pradife on the  
laws of the American legiflaiures. For the rneft  
trilling renfons, and fometimes for no conceiva­  
hie reafon at all, his majefty has reje«fled laws  
of t he moft falutary tendency. The al&gt;olition  
of oomeftic flavery is the gieat ohjefl ofdefire  
m thofe colonies, where it was unhappily intro­  
duced in their infant (late. But previou- to the ,  
enfrimchifement of the Haves we have, it is ne­  
ccftary to exclude all further importations from  
Africa ; yet our repeated attempts to effect this  
by prohibitions, and by impofing duties which  
might amount to a prohibition, have been hi­  
therto defeated by his majcfly’s negative : Thus  
preferring the immediate advantages of a few j  
Bntifli corfair* to the lading intcrefts of the i  
American ftates, and to the rights of human na­  
ture, deeply wounded by this infamous pradiice. i  
Nay, the fingle interpofition of an interefted in- !  
dividual againfl a law was fcarcely ever known •  
to fail of fuccefs, though in the oppofite fcale !  
were placed the interefts ofa whole country.  
1 hat this is fo Ihamcful an abufe ofa power  
trufted with his majefty for other purpofes, as !  
if not reformed, would cali for feme legal it-1  
Itridtons. b *  
  
With eqfial inattention to the neceflities of  
his people herr. has his majdtv permitted our  
laws to lie neglected in England for vears, nei­  
ther confirming them by his afTcnt, nor annu!­  
I,n§ ,h&#x27;m byh’s negative ; fo that fuch of them  
as have no lufpendmg clanfe we hold on the  
molt precarious of all tenures, his majefty’s will,  
and fuch of them as fufpend themfriVes till his  
maiclty s aflent he obtained, we have feared,  
might he called into exiAence at fotnc future *  
niu.ant period, when time, and change of cir­  
euinfl.iiices, fliall have rendered them doArnc­  
five to his people here. And to render this griev­  
ance (till more oppreflive, his majefty by hir. in­  
ftrudtions lias laid hin governors under fuch re­  
ftndions that they can pafs no law of any mo­  
ment iinlcfs it have fuch fufpending clanfe ; fo  
that, however immediate may be the call for 1c­  
dfl itiyc interpolitioii, the law cannot he exccu­  
fd til it has twice croffed the Atlantic, by which  
time the evil may have fpent its whole force.  
Ent in what terms, reconcilable to makfty  
and at the fniiv time to truth, (hall we fp..;k of  
8/:t: ’(dcrndinu fo the governor of the colony  
of Virginia, by which he is forbidden to afTcnt

th-r m-ant to confine H e legin.-.tive h&lt;*dy to  
their prefent numbers, that they may he the  
cheaper bargain whenever they fhnll become  
worth a purchafe.  
O’ C of the articles of impeachment a»a»nft  
Trefilir.n, and the other judges of Weftmmfter  
Hall, in the reign of Richard the fecond, fovj  
which they ful’t-red death, as traitor* to their ]  
c -untry, was, that they had advifed the king  
that he might di/Tolve his par&#x27;d ament at any  
time; ami fuceecding kings have adopted the  
opinion of theft? imjuft judges. Since the reign  
of the Second William, however, under whom  
the Britifh confritution was fettled on its free .&quot;c  
ancient principles, neither his majefty, nor his  
anccftors, have exercifed fuch a power of dliTo­  
lution in the ifland of Great Britain ; and when  
his inaiefty was petitioned, by the united voice  
of his people there, to diffnlve the prefent parli­  
ament, who had become obnoxious to them, his  
minifiers were heard to declare, in open parlia­  
ment, that his majefty pofTefted no fuch power  
by the conftitution.(y) But how different their  
language and his practice here ! To declaim as  
their duty required, the known rights of their  
country, to oppofo the ufurpations of every fo­  
reign judicature, to difregard the imperious  
mandates of a miniftvr or governor, have been  
the avowed eanfes of diffolving honles of r«*prv.  
fentatives in America. But if fuch powers he  
really vefted in his majefty, can he fupnnfe  
they are there placed to awe the members b-prn  
fuch ptirpofes as thefe ? When the rcprctvnta­  
tive body have loft the confidence of their-on­  
fiituents, when they have notoriouflv made file  
of their molt valuahle rights, when thev have  
a (Turned to themfclves powers which the  
pconlc never put into their hands, then indeed  
their continuing in office becomes danirvrons to  
the ftate, ar.d cal&#x27;s for an exercife of the power  
of difTblution. Site!; bring the caufis for which  
tlie reprefentative body (hotild, and (lionId not,  
he diffolved, will it not appear ftranre to an un­  
baiircd ohfvrvrr, ’hat that of Great Britain was  
r.ot diflolvcd, while thoft of the colonies have  
repeatedly incurred that fenttnee?  
  
j mn your majeitv, or your governors, nave  
carried thi6 power beyond every litnii known,  
jor provided for, by the laws: After didblviop  
;one lioufe of reprefcntatives, tliey have refnfed  
; to call another, fo that, for a great length of  
time, the iegiflature provided, by the law* has  
, been out of exiflence. From the nature of  
things, every fociety not ft at all times po fiefs

[The feelings of human nature revolt againfl the  
fuppofition of a (late fo fituated as that it may  
not in any emergency provide againfl dangers  
: which perhaps threattn immediate ruin. While  
thofe bodies are* in exiflence to whom the peo­

fott, fending deputies, or in ary other way they  
may think proper; and the frame of govern­  
ment thus diffolvrd, fhould the people take up­  
on them to lay *he throne of your maiefly prof­  
trite, or to difeontimie their connection with  
the Britifh empire, none will he fo hold as to  
decide againfl the right or the efficacy of fnch  
avttlfion. We forbear to ttai.e conf.qucnces  
further; the dangers are confpicuous with which  
this practice is replete.  
That we (hall at this time alfo take notice of  
an error in the nature of land holdings, which  
crept in at a very early period of our fcttlement.  
Xhg_introdn£thw* of the f &#x27;^rrfrcnZ? ** *n&#x27;°  
•tough underflood to fet this matter in a proper  
light. In the earlier ages of the Saxon fcttle­  
ment feudal holdings were certainly altogether  
unknown ; and very few, if any, had been intro­  
duced at the time of rhe Norman conqueft. Our  
Saxon anceflors held their lands, as they did  
their perfonal property, in ahfolute dominion,  
dnencumbered by any fuperior, arfwering near­  
ly to the nature of thofe pofleflions which the  
federaltfts term allodial. William, the Norman,  
firfl introduced that fyftem generally. The  
lands which had belonged to thofe who fell in 1  
the battle of Halting?, and in the fubfequent in­  
furredticus of his reign, formed a confidcrable  
proportion of the lands of the whole kingdom.  
Thefe he granted out, fubjeft to feudal duties,  
as did he alfo thofe of a great number of his new  
fubjedls, who, by perfuafions or threats, were  
induced to furrender them for that purpofe.  
Hut ftill much was left in the hands of his Saxon  
fubjedls ; held of no fuperior, and not fubjedl  
to feudal conditions. Thefe, therefore, by cx­  
prefs laws, enadted to render uniform the fyf­  
tem of military defence, were made liable to the  
fame military duties as if they had been feuds ;  
and the Norman lawyers foon found tnennsto  
fiddle them alfo with ;;1! the other feudal bur­  
thens. But ftdl they had not been furrcsidered  
to the king, they were not derived from his  
grant, and therefore they were not bolden of  
him. A general principle,indeed, wa- introdu­  
ced, that “ all lands in England were held either  
mediately or immediatcl / of the crown.”  
  
this was borrowed from thofe holdings, which  
were truly feudal, ard only applied to others  
for the putpofts of illufiration. Feudal hold­  
ings were therefore hut exceptions out of the  
Saxon law* of pofleffion, under which all lands  
were field in abfolute right. Thefe, therefore,  
ftill form the bafi», or ground-work, of the com­  
mon law, to prevail whertfoever the exception?  
hare not taken place. America was not con­  
quered by William the Norman, nor its lands  
surrendered to him, or any of his fttccefTon?. Pof.  
fcflions there are undoubtedly of the allodial na­  
ture. Our anceftors, however, who migrated hi­  
ther, were laborers, not lawyers. The fictitious  
principle that all lands belong originally to the  
king, they were early perfuaded to believe real;  
&gt;nd accordingly took grant* of tl.eir own lands  
from the crown. And while the crown conti­  
nued to grant for finall fums, and on re.&#x27;.fonable  
rents; there was no inducement to arrc.&#x27;t the er­  
ror, and lay it open to public view. But his  
majetty ha* lately taken on him to advance the  
terms of purchafe, and of holding to the double  
of what they were; by which mcansthc arqui­  
fition of lands being rendered HifTu ult, the po­  
pulation of our country is likely to be cln eked.  
It i3 time, therefore, for us to lay this matter be­  
fore hismajefty, and to declare that he has no  
right to grant lands of himfelf. From the na­  
Jurr and pnrpofc of civil inftitmions, all the  
lands within the limits which any p,u»i* ular fo­  
cirty has circumfcribcd around it u*If are aflum­  
e&lt;! by that focicty, and fubieft to their allotment  
only. This may he done by themfclvcs, affem­  
bYd colledivcly, or by their Irgifiature, to whom  
they may have delegated foveo.ign authority;  
and if they are allotted in neither of thefe ways,  
each individual of the focirty may appropriate i  
to himftlf fuch lauds as he finda vacant, ar,d oc- &lt;  
tmptney will give hirn title.  
That in order to enforce the arbitrary ir.ra­  
rure* before complained of, his majeftv has  
Tom t ime to time lent among us large bodies of  
irmed foire*, not made up of the people here,  
sor r.lifcd by thr authority of our laws : Did his  
najefty potiefs fnch a right a* this, it might  
wallow up all our right? whenever ht Ihonld  
  
think proper. But his majefty has no ri«rht to  
land a Tingle armed man on our (Imres, and thof.*  
whom he fends here are liable to our laws made  
for the fupprefiion and punilhment of riots,  
routs, and unlawful afTcmhliec; or are hoftile  
bod&#x27;es,invading us in defiance of law. When  
in the courfe of tbe late war it became expedi­  
ent that it body of Hanoverian troops fhonld be  
brough* ov~r for tbe defence of Great Britain,  
his majeftv&#x27;s grandfather, our laic fovereign did  
not pretend tointroducethem underany authority  
hepoOefled. Such a mrafure would have gi­  
ven juft alarm to his fuhjecfts in Great Britain,  
whole I&#x27;berties would not he fafe if armed men  
of another country, and of another fpirit, might  
be brought into the realm at any time without  
theconfent of their legiflatnre. lie therefore ap­  
plied to parliament, who pafled an adt for that  
purpofe, limiting the number to he brought in  
and the time they were to continue. In like  
manner is his majefty reftrained in every part of  
the empire. He potTcfles, indeed, the executive  
p &gt;wer of the 1 vvs in every (late ; hut they are  
the laws of the particular ftate which he is to  
adminifter within that ftate. and not thofe of ary  
one within the limits of another. Every ftate  
muft judge for itftlf the number of armed men  
1 w* ich thev may fafely truft among them, of  
whom they arc to confift, and under what ref­  
trirtions t*&#x27;cy (hall be laid.  
To render thefe proceedings (till morecrimi­  
1 nil a vain ft our law , inftead of fubie,cting the  
military to the civil now* rs, his majefty has ex­  
prefslv made the cdvil fnbortiinate to the milita­  
ry. But can his •oajefty thus put down all law  
under his fret ? C.:n he erect a power funeriov  
to that v hich eredtrd himfclf ? He has done it  
indeed by force ; but let him remember that  
force cannot give right.  
That theft* arc onr grievances which we have  
thus laid before hie majefty, with that freedom  
of language and fentiment which becomes a free  
people claiming their riclits, as derived from  
the laws of nature,a id not as the gift of their  
chief magiftrate : Let thofe flatter who frar ;

RESOLVED, That it be an inftruc­  
ti vi Co ihe fad doputics, when tf. na­  
bled in g*jr.er„l congrefs with the de­  
puties trom the other ftates of Brit ill  
Aront-ica, to prjpofe to the faid con­  
grefs that an humble and dutiful addrefs  
be prefented to his majefty, begging  
ir &quot;Ye to lay before him, as chief magil­  
trate of the Britifh ro. i,,, the united  
cuinplaints of his inajclty&#x27;s fubjedti in  
America ; complnints winch are excitred  
by many unwarrantable encroirthrnents  
and u&#x27;ii&#x27;pations, attempted to be made  
by the legifiature of one part of the em  
pire, upon thufc rigbtt which God and  
the la*s have given equally and inde­  
pendently to all.  
To repreftnt to his majefty that  
thefe his ftates have often iudrv dually*  
made humble application to his imperi  
al throne to obtain, through its inter­  
vention, fome redrefs of their i juied  
rights, ro none of which was ever eveo  
an anfwer cono&#x27;efcendrrd ; hunbly t  
hope that this their joint addrefs, pen­  
ned in the language of truth, and di­  
velied of thofe expr Hi ns of fervih.y  
which would perfu.-.d- ms maj_fty that  
we are alking favours, and hot rights,  
Ih ill obtain from ais majefty a more re­  
fpedU&#x27;ul acceptance. Anrt this Im ma­  
jrfty will think we have region to ex­  
pect wh n he reflects that be .s no more  
than the chief oilicer ot the people, ap­  
pointed by the laws, and circuinfcribed  
with definite powers, to allilt in working  
the great machine of geverAiment, ersct  
ed for their uf;, and coaf.quently fub­  
jed to their fupeiiiueuuai.ee. And in  
order that thefe our lights, as well as  
the itivationa of them, may be hid more  
fully before his majefty, to take a view  
of ihem from the origin and fi.rt lettle­  
ment of thefe countries.  
To remind him that our anceftors,  
before their emigration to Am-ricn,  
were the free inhabitants of the Brmlh  
dominions in Europe, and polfclTcd a  
right * hicii nature has given to all men,  
of departing from the country in wiiich  
chance, not choice, has piacesi them, of  
going in queit of new hid .at.or.s, and  
of there eiiabliihing new Societies, under  
fuch laws and regolatons as to them  
fhall feem moft likely to promote public  
happißefs. That their Saxon anccito.j  
had, under this uuiverf-tl law, in 1 ke  
manner left their hanv.- wilds and w tods  
in the north of Europe, had poffeffed  
themfelves of the illand of Britain, then  
lei&#x27;s charged with inhabitants, and hid  
elUbliihed there thst fyitem ot Lw»  
which has fo long been the glory and  
protection of that country. N-jr was  
*ver any claim of foperiority or deper­  
dener afferted over thrm by that uio­  
tlser country from wh eh thr.y had mi­  
grated ; and were fuch a cUmi mad-,  
it is believed that his majelty&#x27;s fubjccts  
in Oreat 3ricain have too firm a toe ling&#x27;  
of the rights derivi-d to them from tbfir  
. anceftors, to bow down the Cov:r&lt;ig:ny  
of their ftate before fuch vilionary pre­  
tentions. And it is thought tft »t ho  
circumftance has occurred to diftiiiguilit  
materially the Britiih from &quot;the Sussoh  
emigration. America was conquered,

fectual : for tjiemfetvcs they foug&#x27;t,  
j lor the**:fetves tbey conquered, and f»r  
i themfelves alone they have a rip-fit to  
hold*  
No fliilling was ever Iffued from the  
public treafunes of his majefty, or hi.  
(tars, for their *ffifhw»c&gt;j ti i of very  
j late times, after the colonies had far­  
come eltablilhcd on a firm and pema.

Ito Ih-rfeif the benefits of their com­

Such nftilhnc-, and in Inch circs m.

i terms been propofed, they would h .ye  
edthetn with difdain. and trufred  
t i better to the mad-ration of their

j their own force. We do not, however,  
I mean to under-rare thofe aids, WhiOli ....  
jus were doubtlefs valuable, on winte­

fuch eycluffve privilege, in trade as may  
be advantageous to them, and at the  
fam:*. time not too relt-ictve &gt;o our.  
felves. That fetiiement* having been  
thus cfF dted in the wilds of Auvuc.*,  
the rm&#x27;lgrapt. thought proper to a.  
that fyftem of laws under which they hA

brought on them afterwards the ex -ni n  
of thofe farred nnd fovereign rights of

That thus have we haflened through  
the reigns which preceded bis majefVs,  
during which the violation of »ur right

more diftant intervals than that rapid  
and bad fucceffion of injuries which is  
likely |to diftinguidi the prefent fr«ro  
all other periods of Americau ftory.  
Scarcely have our minds been able to  
emerge from the sftonilhtnent ir,to  
wlich one ftroke of parliamentary thun­  
der has involved us, before another more  
heavy, and more alarming, is fallen on  
us. Single ails of tyranny may be af­  
cribed to the accidental opinion of a  
day ; but a i&#x27;eries of oppredions, brgun  
at a diltinguifhed period, and pu.iued  
unalterably through evrry change of  
minifters, too plainly prove a deliberate  
and fyileinatical plan of reducing us to  
flav/ry.

But that one other ad (c) palT.-d i.i

noxfee of an er-:&gt;r in ih* nature of land  
till ii -,&#x27;gs, which crept in at a very early  
pegUid ot r)iir fettlement. Ths iniro­  
didion of the feudal tenuras into the  
kingdom of England, though an ient,  
i 3 w It uadenftooti co let this  
matter in a proper light. 1* th&lt;* eiilier  
of tie Sax&amp;n fettjemetit   
holijings were certainly al&#x27;og. ther un­  
kttowu ; aud vrty i&#x27;(&lt;w, if any, had been  
introduced at the time of the Norrnae  
conque&#x27;;. Our Saxon moefbo a held ti.e&#x27;u  
lands, ai V*ty did their perlmal proper  
t •, in abf lute dominion, diiencuinbered  
by aoy fuperior, anfwring nearly to th*  
nature of thofe poffefjioos which thr  
federalifts term allodial. WilltajPi the  
«  
  
&quot;-nn, firft introduced thtt fyftem ge­  
nerally. The land* which had belonged  
1 to tiiofe wh&gt;; fell in the battle of *;\l&#x27;­  
tfogay and in the fubi&#x27;.-rpent iiifii regi­  
ons of hij reign, formed a cdafldeHbta j  
proportion of the lands of tne whole  
kingdom. Thefe he granted out, tub  
ie&#x27;i to feudal duties, as did he alio tla&gt;fe &#x27;  
of a eat number of his new fabj«&amp;3,  
who, hy perflations or threats, were in- I  
duoed to furrender thcni i ■.; th&lt;u purp.de.  
But HI! much was left in the hands of  
his Saxon fubjeAU ; held of no fuperior,  
and not fnbjec\ to feudal conditions.—  
i hefe, therefore, by exprefs laws, anao\­  
|ed to render uniform the fyftem of mili­  
| ta-y-defence, were made liable td the fame  
military duties as if they h*d been fHids;  
and the Norman lawyers fion found  
j mear.s to fiddle them alfowuh all the other \
feudal burthens. But ftill they had not  
, been furrendrrtd to the king, tbe.y Were  
nut derived from his grant, and there-  
I lore they were not holden of him. A  
j general principle, indeed, was introduc­  
ed, that&quot; nil lands in England were held  
either mediately or immediately of the&#x27;  
crown,&quot; hut this was borrowed from  
thefe holdings, which were truly fatidil,  
and only applied to others for the purpofe  
of Ulmftration. Feud.il holdings were  
butexceptionaout of S-ixon  
laws of poffeftian, under which all lands  
were held ia abfolute right. Thefe,  
therefore, ftiil form the bails, or ground­  
work, of the common luW, to prevail  
whensoever the. exceptions have not taken  
place. America w&lt;ss not conquered by  
William the Norman, nor t:s lands fur­  
rendered to him, or any of ids fWeefTons.  
PoflVlfioas there are undoubtedly bf the  
allodial nature. O&#x27;jr anceftors,   
who rr.ig.at-d hither, were laborers, not  
lawyers. The fictitious principl; that&#x27;  
ail landsj belong briflrinilw to fhc king,  
thfy were perfuaded to believe real ;  
and accordingly t ..k grant? of their own  
lands from the crown. And While the  
crown continued to gia-.t for lmall fum;,  
and on reafonable rent* ; there was no  
inducement to arrell the error, and lay  
it open to public view. But his majel­  
ty has lately tskrn on him to advance  
the terms of purchafe, and of holdirg  
to the double of wha: tlv-y were ; by  
which meant th- tfctpaintion of land? be­  
ing rendered difiuull;, the population of&#x27;  
our country is Ik ly to be cbrck&#x27;d.— 1  
is ti-•&gt;, therefore, for us to lay vhis&#x27;  
matter befne his maj lly, tfc&amp; to de­  
clare that he has no right to grant lands  
oF himfelf. From the nature and pur­

bold. In one passage he goes beyond his  
masters, and says,—“ For the most trifling  
reasons, and sometimes for no conceiva-  
ble reasons at all, his Majesty has rejected  
laws of the most salutary tendency. The  
abolition of domestic slavery is the great ob-  
ject of desire in these Colonies, where it was

But, previous to the enfranchisement of

clude all further importations from Africa.  
Yet our repeated efforts to effect this, by  
prohibiting and by imposing duties which  
might amount to prohibition, have been

ciples and methods of the Revolution to the West. In _inter-  
preting the history of colonial settlement so as to meet the needs  
of the revolutionary arguments, John Adams had held that the  
original colonists carried with them only natural rights, and having  
settled a new country according to the law of nature, were not  
bound to submit to English law unless they chose it. Jefferson  
had compared the original colonial migrations to the migrations of  
their Saxon ancestors to England; and he had asserted that the  
colonists “ possessed a right which nature has given to all men,  
of . . . going in quest of new habitations and of there establish-  
ing new societies under such laws and regulations as to them shall  
seem most likely to promote public happiness. . . Settlements  
having been thus effected in the wilds of America, the emigrants  
thought proper to adopt that system of laws under which they  
had hitherto lived in the mother country.” Such were the theo-  
ries urged by the revolutionary leaders respecting the political  
rights of settlers in vacant regions, at the very time when the  
frontiersmen were occupying the lands beyond the mountains.

“Not only the principles of common sense, but the common feelings  
of human nature, must be surrendered up, before His Majesty’s sub-  
jects here can be persuaded to believe, that they hold their political  
existence at the will of a British parliament. Shall these governments  
be dissolved, their property annihilated, and their people reduced to a  
state of nature, at the imperious breath of a body of men whom they  
never saw, in whom they never confided, and over whom they have no  
powers of punishment or removal, let their crimes against the American  
public be ever so great? Can any one reason be assigned, why one  
hundred and sixty thousand electors in the island of Great Britain,  
should give law to four millions in the States of America, every indi-  
vidual of whom is equal to every individual of them in virtue, in under-  
standing, and in bodily strength? Were this to be admitted, instead of  
being a free people, as we have hitherto supposed, and mean to con-  
tinue ourselves, we would suddenly be found the slaves, not of one, but  
of one hundred and sixty thousand tyrants; distinguished, too, from all  
others, by this singular circumstance, that they are removed from the  
reach of fear, the cnly restraining motive which may hold the hand of
