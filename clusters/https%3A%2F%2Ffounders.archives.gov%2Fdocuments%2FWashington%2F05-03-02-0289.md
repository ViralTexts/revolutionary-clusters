Gentlemen,  
[19 August 1789]  
  
I sincerely thank you for your affectionate congratulations on my election to the chief magistracy of the United States.  
After having received from my fellow-citizens in general the most liberal treatment—after having found them disposed to contemplate in the most flattering point of view, the performance of my military services, and the manner of my retirement at the close of the war—I feel that I have a right to console myself in my present arduous undertakings, with a hope that they will still be inclined to put the most favorable construction  
  
on the motives which may influence me in my future public transactions. The satisfaction arising from the indulgent opinion entertained by the American People of my conduct, will, I trust, be some security for preventing me from doing any thing, which might justly incur the forfeiture of that opinion. And the consideration that human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected, will always continue to prompt me to promote the progress of the former, by inculcating the practice of the latter.  
On this occasion it would ill become me to conceal the joy I have felt in perceiving the fraternal affection which appears to encrease every day among the friends of genuine religion—It affords edifying prospects indeed to see Christians of different denominations dwell together in more charity, and conduct themselves in respect to each other with a more christian-like spirit than ever they have done in any former age, or in any other nation.  
I receive with the greater satisfaction your congratulations on the establishment of the new constitution of government, because I believe its’ mild, yet efficient, operations will tend to remove every remaining apprehension of those with whose opinions it may not entirely coincide, as well as to confirm the hopes of its’ numerous friends; and because the moderation, patriotism, and wisdom of the present federal Legislature, seem to promise the restoration of Order, and our ancient virtues; the extension of genuine religion, and the consequent advancement of our respectability abroad, and of our substantial happiness at home.  
I request most reverend and respected Gentlemen that you will accept my cordial thanks for your devout supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe in behalf of me—May you, and the People whom you represent be the happy subjects of the divine benedictions both here and hereafter.  
  
G: Washington

them difpoled to contemplate, in the  
mott flattering point of view, the per-

on the motives, which may influence  
me in my future public tranfactions.  
  
he fatisfattion, arifing from the  
  
indulgent opinion, entertained by the  
American people, of my conduét, will,  
I trult, be fome fecurity for prevent-  
ing me from doing any thing, which  
might juftly incur the fortetture of  
that oprnion—and the confideration,  
that human happinefs, and moral du-  
ty, are infeparably connetted, will al-  
ways continue to prompt me to pro-  
mote the progrefs of the former, by  
inculcating the practice of the later,  
  
On this occafion, it will ill become  
me to conceal the joy I have felt, i  
perceiving the fraternal affection which  
appears to increafe every day amon,

tion, your congratulations on the ella-  
bliihment of the new couftitution of  
government : becaufe, 1 believe, its  
mild. yetefficient operations, W \ tend

I SINCERELY thank you for your affectionate congratulations on  
my election to the chief magistracy of the United States.  
  
After having received from my fellow citizens in general the most  
liberal treatment—after having found them disposed to contemplate, in  
the most flattering point of view, the performance of my military servi-  
ces, and the manner of my retirement at the close of the war—I feel  
that I have a right to console myself, in my present arduous under-  
taking, with a hope, that they will still be inclined to put the most  
favourable construction on the motives which may influence me in my  
future public transactions.  
  
The satisfaction arising from the indulgent opinion entertained by the  
American people, of my conduct, will, I trust, be some security for pre-  
venting me from doing any thing, which might justly incur the forfeiture  
of that opinion. And the consideration, that human happiness and  
moral duty are inseparably connected, will always continue to prompt  
me to promote the progress of the former, by inculcating the practice of  
the latter.  
  
On this oceasion it would ill become me to conceal the joy I have  
felt in perceiving the fraternal affection, which appears to encrease every  
day among the friends of genuine religion. It affords edifying pros-  
pects indeed, to see christians of different denominations dwell together  
in more charity, and conduct themselves, in respect to each other, with  
a more christian like spirit, than ever they have done in any former age,  
or in any other nation.  
  
I receive, with the greatest satisfaction, your congratulations on the  
establishment of the ve Constitution of Government; because I be-  
  
lieve its mild, yet efficient, operations will tend to remove every remain-  
ing apprehension of those, with whose opinions it may not entirely coin-

cide, as well as to confirm the hopes of its numerous friends; and be-  
cause the moderation, patriotism and wisdom of the present Federal  
Legislature seem to promise the restoration of order and our ancient  
virtues,—the extension of genuine religion—and the consequent advance-  
ment of our respectability abroad, and of our substantial happiness at  
home.  
  
I request, Most Reverend and respectable Gentlemen, that you will  
accept my cordial thanks for your devout supplications to the Supreme  
Ruler of the Universe in behalf of me. May you, and the people whom  
you represent, be the happy subjects cf Divine Benediction both here
