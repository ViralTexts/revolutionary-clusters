Treasury Department,May 30, 1793.  
Sir,  
  
It being the opinion of the Executive, that there is no general law of the land, prohibiting the entry and sale of goods captured by foreign powers at war—and consequently that such entry and sale are lawful; except in cases where a prohibition is to be found in the treaties of the United States—  
It becomes the duty of this Department to make known to you, that the entry of vessels captured and brought into our ports by the ships of war and privateers of France, and of their cargoes, is to be received in the same manner, under the same regulations, and upon the same conditions, as that of vessels and their cargoes which are not prizes. One of these conditions is, of course, the payment or securing the payment of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandize imported, and on the tonnage of ships and vessels.  
But the same privilege will not extend to any of the other Belligerent Powers, being contrary to the 17th and 22d articles of our Treaty with France.

ft occasion which could  
polfibly demand an observance of it? If  
France had never been engaged in war, the  
17th end 22d articles would have beenjife­  
lefs. But as the period has arrived, which  
calls for the execution of the engagements  
ltipu&#x27;ated in those articles, would it not a­  
mount to an unequivocal declaration of War  
with France, to rejirft the validity of them.  
I tiling it would be proper to publiih the  
two articles in question—Aster which I shall
