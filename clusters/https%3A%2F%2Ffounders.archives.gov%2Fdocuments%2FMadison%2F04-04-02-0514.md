Sir  
  
Montpellier Ocr. 10. 1827  
  
I have just seen in another Gazette, the following paragraph, noted as an extract from the “Lynchburg Virginian” viz  
Without being aware of the ground on which the Statement is alledged to be within the personal knowledge of the Editor, it is proper to observe that, as often happens in the report of conversations, there must have been some degree of misapprehension or misrecollection.  
It is true that I have not approved the proceedings of the General Assembly of the State, which would (limit the power of Congress over trade to regulations having revenue alone for their object); that I have in occasional Conversations, been led to observe that a contrary doctrine has been entertained and acted on, from the commencement of the Constitution of the U. States, by the several Branches of every Administration under it; and that I regretted the course pursued by the General Assembly, as tending to impair the confidence &amp; cordiality of other parts of the Union, agreeing with Virginia in her exposition of the Constitution on other points. In expressing these ideas, however, more respect has been felt for the patriotic sensibilities of the Legislative Body, and for the talents &amp; good intentions of Members, personally or otherwise known to me to be particularly entitled to it, than might be inferred from the tone of the publication. I must observe also, that though it is true, that I have spoken of the power of  
  
Congress over Commerce in its enlarged sense, as a primary &amp; known object in forming the Constitution, the language of the statement is inaccurate at least, as being susceptible of a construction, embracing indefinite powers over the entire resources of the Country.  
I must presume that the expressions which refer by name to the Governor of the State, were not meant to be ascribed to me; being very sure that I could never have so far forgotten, what I owed to myself, or the respect due to him.  
It is with much reluctance, Sir, that I have had recourse to these explanatory remarks, withdrawn as I am from scenes of political agitation, by my age &amp; pursuits more congenial with it. It is the single instance of a communication from me to the press on any subject connected with the existing State of parties. With respects,  
  
James Madison

Srrs: I have just seen, in another gazette, the follow-

Virginda, viz:  
  
“We state, as a fact within our own knowledge, that,

Without being aware of the ground on which the state-  
ment is alleged to be within the personal knowledge of  
the editors, | think it proper to observe, that, as often hap-  
  
pens ia the report of conversations, there must have been |  
  
some degree of misrep rehensiou, or misrecollection.  
  
Tt is true that L have not approved the proceedings of  
the general assembly ofthe state, which would limit the  
power ofcongress over trade to regulations having reve-  
nite alone for their object; that Ihave, in oceasional con-  
versations, been led to observe, that a contrary doctrine  
jvid&#x27; been entertained and acted on, from the gommence-  
iment ef the constitution of the United States, by the se-  
veral branches of every administration under it; and that  
F regretted the eourse pursued by the gencral assembly,  
as tending to impair the confidence and cordiality of other  
parts of the union, agreeing with Virginia in her exposi-  
tion of the constitution, on otiigr points. In expressitg  
these ideas, however, more regpect has been felt for the  
— sensibilities of the loptilative body, and for the  
  
stents and good intentions of members, personally, or  
otherwise known to me to be partieularly eutitled to it,  
than might be inferred from the tone of the publication. I  
must abserve, also, that though it is true that I have  
spoken of the power of congress, in its enlarged sense,  
gyer eommeree, asa primary and known object in form- |  
  
ing the constitution, the I ofthe statement is inac-  
curate, at least as being susceptible of a construction em-  
bracing indefinite powers over the entire resources of the  
country.  
  
I mast presume that the expressions which refer, by  
name, to the governor of the state, were not meant to be  
ascribed to me; being very sure that could never have so  
ote, am what I owed to myself, or the respect duc  
to him.  
  
It is with much reluctance, sirs, that I have had re-  
course to these explanatory remarks, withdrawn as I am  
from scenes of political agitation, by my age, and pur-  
suitsmore congenial with it. It isthe single instance of  
a communication from metothe press, on any subject  
connected with the existing state of parties. With ree

jects, in adopting the Constitution, was to give j  
such protection to the resources of the coun- !  
try, as circumstances might require. The Ex-  
Prosident has since written a letter to the edi­  
tor of the Virginian, the object of which was  
to disclaim the offensive language towards the  
Governor and General Assembly of Virginia, j  
in which a part of the article is couched, while, j  
at the same time, he distinctly admits the sen- i  
timents, imputed to him, as his own, as will ,

It is true that I have not approved the pro- •  
cecdings of the General Assembly of the I  
State, which would limit the power of Con- |  
gress over trade, to regulations having reven- &#x27;  
ue alone for their object; that I have in oc- &#x27;

a contrary doctrine had been entertained and  
acted on, from the commencement of the Con- &#x27;  
stitution of the U. States, by the several  
branchi*s of every administration under it; |  
and that I regretted the course pursued by the .  
General Assembly, as tending to impair the j  
confidence and cordiality of other parts of  
the Union, agreeing with Virginia in her ex-j  
position of the constitution, on otiicr points. ;  
&#x27; tn expressing these ideas, however, more re­  
spect has been felt for the patriotic sensibilities  
of the Legislative body and for thfe talents and  
good intentions of members, personally or oth­  
erwise known to me to be particularly entitled

It is true that I have not approved the pro­

which would lhmit the power of Congress over  
trade, to raguiations having revenus alone for  
their object; that 1 bave in occasional conver­

docirioe had been entertained and acted on,  
from tbe commencemenl of the Constitntion of  
the U. Stateg, by the several branches of eve­

spoken of the powe? of Congress in its enlarg­

wnowa object in formiog the constitutien, the  
language of tbe stalement is ipaccurate, at

 thout being aware of the ground on which  
the statement is alleged to be within the personal  
knowledge of the Edtors, I think it proper to  
observe that, as often happens in the report of  
conversations, there must have been some degree  
of misapprehension, or misrecollection.  
It is true that I have not approved the pro-  
ceedings of the Gencral Assembly of the State,  
which would limit the power of Congress, over  
trade, to regulations having revenue alone for  
their object; that I have, in occasional conversa.­  
tions, been led to observe that a contrary doc-  
trine had been entertained and acted on, from  
the commencement of the Constitution of the  
United States, by the several branches of every  
administration underit; and that I regretted the  
course pursued by the General Assembly, as tend.  
ing to impair the confidence and cordislity of  
other parts of the Union, agrecing with Virginia  
in her exposition of the Constitution, on other  
points. In expressing these ideas, however, more  
respect has been felt for the patriotic sensibilities  
of the Legislative body, and for the talents and  
good intentions of members, personally or other.  
wise known to me to be particularly entitled to it,  
than might be inferred from the tone, of the pub,  
lication. I must observe, also, that though it is  
true, that I have spoken of the power of Cone  
gress in its enlarged sense, over commerce, as a  
primary and known object in forming the Cone­  
stitution, the language of the statement is inac  
curate, at least as being susceptible of a con  
struction embracing indetinite powers over the  
entire resources of the country.  
I must presume that the expressions which  
refer, by name, to the Governor of the State,  
were not meant to be ascribed to me; being very  
sure that I could never have so far forgotten  
what I owed to myself, or the respect due to  
him.  
It is with much reluctance, Sirs, that I have  
had recourse to these explanatory remarks, with  
rawn as I am from scenes of political agitation,  
by my age, and pursuits more congenial with it  
It is the single instance of a communication from  
me to the press, on any subject connected with  
the existing state of parties.  
With respect,JAMES MADISON
