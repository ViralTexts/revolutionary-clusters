Sirs,   
					Quincy, May 26, 1809.  
				  
				In pamphlet, page 27, it is said that the great alteration  
in public opinion had put it completely in the power of  
our executive to control the machinations of any future  
public agent, of France. Therefore Philadelphia was a  
safer scene of negotiation than Paris.  
Mr. Hamilton’s erroneous conceptions of the public  
opinion may be excused by the considerations that he was  
not a native of the United States; that he was born and bred in the West Indies, till he went to Scotland, for education, where he spent his time in a seminary of learning,  
till seventeen years of age; after which no man ever perfectly acquired a national character; then entered a college at Newyork, from whence he issued into the army  
as an aid de camp. In these situations he could scarcely  
acquire the opinions, feelings, or principles of the American people. His error may be excused by the further  
consideration, that his time was chiefly spent in his pleasures, in his electioneering visits, conferences and correspondences, in propagating prejudices against every man  
whom he thought his superior in the public estimation;  
and in composing ambitious reports upon finance, while  
the real business of the treasury was done by Duer, by Woolcot, and even, for some time and in part, by Tenche  
Coxe.  
His observation that “France will never be without secret agents,” is true: and it is equally true that England  
will always have secret agents and emissaries too, “That  
her partizans among our own citizens, can much better  
promote her cause than any agents she can send, is also  
true:” but it is at least equally true of the partizans of  
Great Britain. We have seen, in the foregoing papers,  
glaring and atrocious instances of the exertions of her  
public agents, secret emissaries and partizans among our  
citizens. But none have yet been mentioned that bear  
any comparison, in point of guilt and arrogance, with  
those of all kinds that have been exhibited within the last  
two or three years. My worthy fellow-citizens! Our form of government,  
inestimable as it is, exposes us more than any other to the  
insidious intrigues and pestilented influence of foreign nations. Nothing but our inflexible neutrality can preserve  
us. The public negotiations and secret intrigues of the  
English and the French have been employed, for centuries, in every court and country of Europe. Look back  
to the history of Spain, Holland, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Prussia, Italy, and Turkey, for the last  
hundred years. How many revolutions have been caused!  How many emperors and kings have fallen victims to the  
alternate triumphs of parties excited by Englishmen or  
Frenchmen? And can we expect to escape the vigilant  
attention of politicians so experienced, so keen sighted,  
and so rich? If we convince them that our attachment  
to neutrality is unchangeable, they will let us alone: but  
as long as a hope remains, in either power, of seducing  
us to engage in war on his side and against his enemy,  
we shall be torn and convulsed by their manœuvres.  
Never was there a grosser mistake of public opinion  
than that of Mr. Hamilton. The great alteration in public opinion had not then, nor has it yet, taken place. The  
French republic still existed: The French people were  
still considered as struggling for liberty, amidst all their  
internal revolutions, their conflicts of parties, and their  
bloody wars against the coalitions of European powers.  
Monarchy, empire, had not been suggested. Bonaparte  
had appeared only as a soldier; had acted on the public  
stage in no civil or political employment. A sense of  
gratitude, for services rendered us in our revolution, by  
far more sincere and ardent than reason or justice could  
warrant, still remained on the minds, not only of our  
republicans, but of great numbers of our soundest federalists. Did Mr. Hamilton recollect the state of our presses?  
Recollect the names and popular eloquence of the editors  
of the opposition papers?—That scoffing, scorning wit,  
and that caustic malignity of soul which appeared so remarkably in all the writings of Thomas Paine and Callender, which to the disgrace of human nature, never fails  
to command attention and applause? The members of  
the Senate and House, who were decided against the administration, their continual intercourse &amp; communications with French emissaries? The hideous clamor against  
the alien law, and sedition law, both considered as levelled  
entirely against the French and their friends, and the  
surrender according to the British treaty, of the Irish murderer Nash, imposed upon the public for Jonathan Robbins? Did he recollect the insurrection in Pennsylvania.  
The universal and perpetual inflammatory publications against the land tax, stamp tax, coach tax, excise law,  
and eight per cent loa? Did he never see nor hear of  
the circular letters of members of Congress from the middle and southern states? Did he know nothing of the biting sarcasms, the burning rage against himself and his  
own army? Did he know nothing of a kind of journal  
that was published of every irregular act of any officer or  
soldier, of every military punishment that was inflicted,  
under the appellation of the Cannibal’s Progress? Did he  
see nothing of the French cockades ostentatiously exhibited against the American cockades?  
Had a French minister been seen here with his suite,  
he would have been instantly informed of every source  
and symptom of discontent. Almost every Frenchman  
upon the continent, and they were then numerous in all  
the states, would have been employed in criminating the American government, in applauding the condescension of  
the French Directory, and the friendly, conciliating disposition of the French nation. Nothing could have been  
kept secret. the popular clamor for peace on any terms  
would have been very difficult, if not impossible, to resist.  
The multitude in Philadelphia, as it was, were almost as  
ripe to pull me out of my house as they had been to dethrone Washington in the time of Genet. Even the night  
of the fast day, the streets were crouded with multitudinous assemblies of the people, especially that before my  
door, and kept in order only, as many people thought,  
by a military patrol, ordered, I believe, by the Governor  
of Pennsylvania.  
In these circumstances, it was my opinion, and it is so  
still, it was infinitely better to conduct the negociation at  
Paris than in Philadelphia. But if this was and is an error, it was certainly not of such consequence as Hamilton  
thought fit to represent it. If it was an error, I humbly  
conceive it would have better become Mr. Hamilton to  
have been silent, than to endeavor to make it unpopular—since the step was taken and irrevocable, when he wrote.  
But the real truth is, he was in hopes, as well as Mr.  
Liston, that the French government would neither send a minister here nor receive one there—in short, that they  
would have gone to war with us. If we had waited for  
a minister here, much time would have been lost: our  
little naval force under Talbot, Truxton, Decatur, Little,  
&amp;c. was doing wonders in protecting our commerce, and  
in fighting and capturing French ships of war. Some of  
our citizens were not wanting in irritating expressions of  
exultation and triumph, particularly in parading a French  
national ship that had been captured by Decatur up the  
Delaware, in sight of all the citizens of Philadelphia,  
with the French national colors reversed under our American flag. Hamilton hoped that such provocations  
would produce an irreconcileable breach and a declaration  
of war. He was disappointed and lost the command of  
his army. Hinc illæ Lacrimæ!  
There were other circumstances of more serious and  
solid importance, indicative of public opinion, which Mr.  
Hamilton, if he had been a vigilant and sagacious statesman, could not have overlooked. The venerable patriarchs, Pendleton and Wythe, of Virginia, openly declaimed for peace; the former came out in print with his  
name, protesting against a war with our sister republic of  
France. General Heath came out with an address to the  
public in Massachusetts, declaring that every man he met  
was decidedly for peace. When the election was coming  
on, the legislature of Massachusetts dare not trust the people, either at large or in districts, to choose electors, but  
assumed that office to themselves. In New-York, the  
great interest and vast bodies of people, who are supposed  
to follow or direct the two great families of Clintons and  
Livingstons, aided by all the address and dexterity of  
Aaron Burr, was decidedly for peace with France. In  
Pennsylvania, Governor M’Kean, with his majority of  
thirty thousand votes, or in other words, at the head of  
the two vast bodies of Germans and Irish, reinforced by  
great numbers of English Presbyterians, Quakers and Anabaptists, were decidedly against a war with France.  
After enumerating all these symptoms of the popular  
bias, it would be frivolous to enlarge upon the conversations of which I was informed at taverns and insurance  
offices, threatening violence to the President by pulling  
him out of his chair, upon the French cockades that were  
every where paraded before my eyes, in opposition to the  
black cockade, or upon the declarations and oaths, which  
I know were made by no small numbers, that if we went  
to war with France, and the French should come here,  
they would join them against the federalists and the English. These things I recollect with grief, because they do  
no honor to our country: but I must say they disgrace  
it no more than many more solemn actions and declarations of the opposite party against France, and in favor of  
England, have done within the last twelve months.  
In these circumstances, it was the height of folly to say  
as Hamilton says, that it would have been safer to negotiate at Philadelphia than at Paris. As to our ambassador’s  
being overawed in Paris, by any finesse of politicians, or  
triumphs of the French arms: We must take care to send  
men who are equal to such trials. The French have not,  
as yet, gained any great and unjust advantages of us by  
all their policy. Our envoys were precisely instructed.  
Every article was prescribed that was to be insisted on as  
an ultimatum. In a treaty they could not depart from a  
punctilio. A convention they might make, as they did,  
at their own risque. But the President and Senate were  
under no obligation to ratify it. Had it betrayed a single  
point of essential honor or interest, I would have sent it  
back, as Mr. Jefferson did the treaty with England, without laying it before the Senate. If I had been doubtful,  
the Senate would have decided.Where, then, was the danger of this negotiation? No  
where but in the disturbed imagination of Alexander  
Hamilton. To me only it was dangerous. To me, as  
a public man, it was fatal, and that only because Alexander Hamilton, was pleased to wield it as a poisoned weapon,  
with the express purpose of destroying. Though I owe  
him no thanks for this, I most heartily rejoice in it, because it has given me eight years, incomparably the happiest of my life: whereas, had I been chosen president again, I am certain I could not have lived another year.  
It was utterly impossible that I could have lived through  
one year more of such labors and cares as were studiously  
and maliciously accumulated upon me, by the French faction and the British faction; the former aided by the republicans, and the latter by Alexander Hamilton, and  
his satellites.

POLITICAL.  
Mr. ADAMS’S  
CORRESPONDENCE CONTINUED.  
  
7o tht Printin of the Hot ton Patriot v  
Siu.  
IN pamphlet, page 27, it is said that the great  
alteration in public opinion, had put it complete­  
ly in the power of our executive to corilroul the  
machinations of any future public agent of France.  
Therefore Philadelphia was a safer scene of ne­  
gotiation that! Paris.  
Mr. Hamilton’s erroneous conceptions of the  
public opinion, may be excused by the conside­  
rations mat he was not a native of the United  
States ; that be was born and bred in the West  
Indies till he went to Scotland. for education,  
where lie spent his time in a seminary of learning,  
till 17 years of age ; after which no man ever  
perfectly acquired a national character t then  
entered a college at New-York,from whence he  
issued into the army as an aid- de-camp. In these  
  
muiuons ne couiu scarcely acquire me opinions,  
feelings, or principles of the American people,  
His error may be excused by the further consi­  
deration, that hia time was chiefly spent in his  
pleasures, in his electioneering visits* conferen­  
ces and correspondences, in propagating preju­  
dices against every roan whom lie thought his su­  
perior ill the public estimation s and in compos­  
Ing ambitious reports upon finance, while the re­  
al business of the treasury was done by Duer, by  
Wolcott, and even fur some time and in part, by  
Tenche Coxe.  
His observation that *&#x27; France will never be  
Without secret agents&quot; is true : and it is equal­  
ly true that England will always have secret a­  
gents and emissaries too.—*&#x27; That her parti­  
sans, among our own fellow-citizens can  
much better promote her cause than any a­  
jfents she can send, is also true :** but it is at  
feast equally true of the partizans of G. Britain.  
\Ve have seen in the foregoing papers, glaring  
and atrocious instances of the exertions of her  
puBlic agents, secret emissaries and partizans a­  
mong our citizens : But none have yet been men*  
tioned that bear any comparison in point of guilt  
and arrogance, with those of all kinds that  
have been exhibited within the last two or three  
years.  
  
My worthy fellow-citizens : Unr form of gov­  
ernment, inestimable as it is, exposes it more  
than any other to the Insidious intrigues and  
pestilential influence of foreign nations. No.  
thing but our inflexible neutrality can preserve  
•is. The public negociations and secret intrigues  
of the English and the French have been employ­  
ed for&#x27;centuries in every court and Country of Eu»  
rope. Look back to the history of Spain, Hol­  
land, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Denmark,  
Prussia, Italy, and Turkey, for the last hundred  
years. How many revolutions have been caus­  
ed ! How many emperors and kings have fallen  
victims to the alternate triumups of parties, exci­  
ted by Englishmen or Frenchmen * And can we  
expect to escape the vigilant attention of politici­  
ans so experiened, so keen-sighted, and so rich ?  
If wc convince them that our attachment to neu­  
trality is unchangeable, they wilt let us alone:  
but as long as a hope rc mains, in either power,  
of seducing us to engage in war on his side and  
against his enemy, we shall be torn aild convuls­  
ed by their manoeuvres.  
Never was there a grosser mistake of public  
opinion thrill that of Mr. Hamilton. The great  
alteration in public opinion bad hot then, nor  
has it vet, taken placd. The French republic  
•till existed : The French people were still con­  
sidered as struggling for liberty, amidst all their  
Internal revolutions, their conflicts of parties, and  
their bloody wars against the coalitions of Euro­  
pean powers. Monarchy, empire, had not befcn  
  
suggested. Bonaparte had appeared only as a  
&quot;•Soldier; had acted on the public stage in no civ­  
il dr political employment. A sense of gratitude,  
for services rendered us in our rev olution, by far  
more sincere and ardent, than reason or justice  
coaid warrant, still remained oil the minds, not  
only of our republicans, but of great numbers of  
our soundest federalists. Did Mr. Hamilton re­  
collect the state of our presses ? Recollect the  
names and popular eloquence of the editors of the  
opposition papers ?—That scoffing, scorning  
wit, and that caustic malignity of soul which up­  
beared so remarkably in all tiie writings nfTho­  
*mas Paine and Callender, which to the disgrace  
of human nature, never fails to command atten­  
tion and applause ? The members of the Senate  
and House, who were decided against the ad­  
ministration, their continued communications  
with French emissaries ? The hideous clamor a­  
fjainst the alien law, and sedition law, both con­  
sidered as levelled entirely against the French  
ilnd their friends, and the surrender according to  
the British treaty, of the Irish murderer Nash,  
imposed upon the public for Jonathan Robbins ?  
5&gt;id he recollect the insurrection in Pennsylva­  
nia ? The universal and perpetual inflammatory  
publications against the land tax, stump tax,  
coach tax,excise law, and eight per cent, loan ?  
Did he never see nor hear of the circular letters  
of members of Congress from the middle and  
southern states ? Did he know nothing of the  
biting sarcasms, the burning rage against lorn­  
self and his own army ? Did he know nothing of  
a kind of journal that was published of every ir­  
regular act of any officer Or soldier, of every mili­  
tary punishment that was inflicted, under the ap­  
pellation of the Cannibal&#x27;s Progress ? Did he see  
nothinjfof the French cockades ostentatiously  
exhibited against the American cockades ?  
  
Had a French Minister been seen here with  
his suite, he would have been instantly informed  
of every source U symptom ofdiscontent. Almost  
every Frenchman upon the continent, and they  
were then numerous in all the States, would  
tiavc been employed in criminating the Ameri­  
can government, in applauding the condescensi­  
on of the French Directory and the friendly,  
conciliating disposition of the French nation —  
Nothing coidd have been kept secret. The popu­  
lar clamor of peace on any terms would have been  
very diffn ult, if not impossible, to resist. The  
multitude of Philadelphia, as it was, were  
almost as ripe to pull me out of my house as  
they had been to dethrone Washington in the  
time of Genet. Even the night of the fast day,  
the streets were crouded with multitudinous&#x27;as­  
&gt;cmb&#x27;.lca of the people, especially that before my  
door, and kept in older only, as many people  
thought, by a military patrol, ordered, i believe  
by the Governor of Pennsylvania.  
In these circumstances, it was in my opinion,  
and it is still, it was infinitely better to conduct  
the negotiation at Paris than in Philadelphia —  
liut if this was and is an error, it was certainly  
not of such consequence as Hamilton thought fit  
to present it. If it was an error, I humbly con­  
ceive it v mild have better become Mr. Ham­  
ilton to hsu e b -en silent, than to endeavor to make  
it unpopular— ince the step was taken and ir­  
revocable, wb in lie wrote.  
  
■Dm uir i ru iriuii is, lie was in Hopes, as well  
as Mi*. Liston, that the French government  
would neither send a minister here nor receive  
one there— in slior*, that they would have gone

He wa* disappointed and lost ilte command of

&#x27;There weft other cfrsumstancet of more ye*,  
riwu and solid importance, indicative of public ,  
opinion, which Mr. Hamilton, If he had been k-J  
vigilant and sagacious statesman, could not hnVe  
overlooked. The venerable patriarchs Pendle­  
ton and Wythe, of Virginia,fcpertly declaimed ibr.  
peace ; the farmer came out in print with hi*  
name, protesting against a war with our sister  
republic of Prance. . Gen. Heath came nut with  
an address to the public in Massachusetts, de­  
claring that every man he met was decidedly tor  
peace. When the election was coming on, the  
legislature of Massachusetts dare not trust the  
people, either at Urge Or in districts, to choose  
electors, but assumed that office to themselves.  
In New-York, the great interest and vast bodies  
of people, who are supposed to follow or direct  
the two great families of Clintons ami Livings­  
tons, aided by all the address and dexterity of  
Aaron Burr, was decidedly for peace with France.  
In Pennsylvania, Governor McKean, with his  
majority of thirty thousand votes, or in other  
words, at the head of the two vast bodies of Ger­  
mans and Irish, reinforced by great numbers of  
English Presbyterians, Quakers ami Anabaptists,  
were decidedly against a war with France.  
  
After enumerating all theae symptoms of the

on the conversations of which 1 was informed at

to the President by pulling him out of his chair,

and the French should coine here, they would

cause they do no honor to our country s but I  
must say they disgrace it no more than many

Where, then, was the danger of tills negocia­  
tlon 1 No Where but in tlie disturbed imagina­

dangerous. To me, as a public man, it was fa­

Mr. Hamilion’s ¥rroneous concep- l  
tions of the public opinion may be |  
excused by tbccﬁqai iations that he 1  
wai 10t a native tif’fﬁ@iﬁfed States;  
that he was born and bred in the

for educarion, where he {pent bis time

at Newyork, from whence he iffucd

these situations he could scarcely ac­  
quire the opinions, feelings, or princi- |  
ples of the American people. His 1  
error may be excused by the further  
consideration, that his time was chief­

Duer, by Woolent, and even, for some ’  
time and in part, by Tenche Coze.  
His obfervarion that * France will  
never be without f{tret agents,” is  
trae-: and it is equally trus that Eng­  
land will always have secret agents  
and emiflaries too. “ That her par­

seen, in the foregoirg Sapers; glaring  
and attrocious instances of the exer.  
tions of her public ugents, fcret emis­  
saries and partizans among our citi­  
zeus. But none have yet been meii­  
tioned that bear any comparison, in  
point of guilt and arrogance, with  
those of all kinds that have been ex­  
hibited within the last two or three  
years. il T  
My worthy fillow citizens ! Ounr  
form of government, inedimable as it  
is, exposes us more than any other to  
the insidious intrigues and peftilented  
influence of foreign nations. Nothing  
but our inflexibls peutrality can pre.  
serve us. The public negotiationis and  
secret intrigues of theEnglith and the  
French have been cmgl“&amp;gw for cen­  
turies, in every courtand country of  
Europe: Look back to thek?ry of  
‘Spain, Holland, Germapy, Ruffa,  
Sweden, Denmark, Proffia, Italy,and  
Turkey, for the lak bundred years.  
‘How many levolutions have ten  
«caused ! How many emperors and.  
kings bave fallen viétims mwg (.  
nate triumphs of parties, excited by,  
Englishmen or Frepcbmen ? And can  
‘we expect to escape the vigilant atten-  
  
tion of politicians so experienced, so  
keen sighted, and so rich ? If we con.  
vince them that our attachment to  
neutraliy is unchangeable, they will  
let us alone: hut as long as a hope  
remains, in either power, of {educing  
us.to engage in war on his f{ide and  
againit his enemy, we thull be tomn  
and convulsed by their marczuvres.  
  
Never was there a grosser mistake  
of public opinica than that of Mr.  
Hamilton. The great alteration in  
pubiic opinion had not then, nor has  
it yet, taken place. The Freunch ie­

Had a French minilter been seen

been instantly informed of every |

Almolt every Frenchman upon the  
continent, and they were then nume­  
rousin all the States, would have  
been employed in crisninating the A­  
merican government, in applauding |  
the condefceniion of the French Di­  
re&amp;tory, and the friendly. conciliating |  
cifpofition of the French nation.— ]  
Nothing could have been Kept secret :  
the populat clamor for peace on any I  
terms would have i-zen very difficule,  
if pot impofiible, to refit. The mul­  
titude in Philadelphiz, as it was, were |

Even the night of the faft day, the

But if this was and is an error, it was  
certainly not of such cenfequence as  
Hamilion thought fit to represent it.  
If it was an error, I humbly conceive  
it would have better become Mr.

There were other circumstances of  
more lerions and solid importance,  
indicative of public opinion, which  
M:. Hamilton, if he had been a vigia  
lant and sagacious Ratefman, could  
not huve overiocked. The venerable  
patriarchs Pendleton 2nd Wythe, of  
Virginia, openly declaimed for peaces  
the former came out in print wich  
his nawme, protelling against a war  
with our sister rédpublic of France,—  
General Heath came out with an ~da  
drefsto the public in Maflachufetts,  
declaring thar every man he ruet was  
decidedly for peace. When the elec­  
tion was coming on. the legislature of  
M-fluchnfetrs gare not trult the peo­  
ple, eirher at large or in Sillri@s, to  
choose ele@ors. but assumed that of­  
fice to themselves. In New York,  
the great interest and vast bodies of  
peopie, who are supposed to follow  
or dire@ the two great families of  
Clintons and Livingtions, aided by 2i}  
the address and dexterity of Aaron  
Burr, was decidedly for peace with  
Irance. In Pennsylvania, Governor  
M’Kean; with his majority of thirty  
thousand voies, or in other words, at  
the head of the two vast bodies of  
Germans and Iriths leinforced by  
great numbers of Lnglith Presbyte­  
rians, Quakers and Anabaptists, were  
decidedly against a war with France.  
After enumerating all those symp­  
toms of the popuiar bias, # wonld  
be frivilous ro enlarge upor the copa  
ver{ations of which I was informed ag  
tawerns and insurance offices, threat­  
ning violence to the President by pul­  
ling him out of his chair, upin the  
French cockades thug wers every  
where paraded before my eyes, in op­  
poiition to the black cockadle, or upon  
the declarations and oaths, which I  
know were made by no small num­  
bers, that if we went to war with  
France, and the French should come  
here, they would join them againit  
the federalilts and the English. These  
things I recolle@ with grief, because  
they do no honor to our counury :  
but I must fay they disgrace it no  
more than many more foleriin adioris  
and declaraiions of the opposite party  
against France, and in favor of Eng­  
iand, have done within the last twelve  
months.  
In these circumstances, it was the  
height of folly to fay as Hamilton  
fays; that it would have been fafer to  
négotiate at Philadelphia than at Par­  
is. - As to our ambaﬂ&#x27;admf?eing 0-  
verawes in Paris, by any finefl= of pol­  
idgians, or triumphs of the Freach  
am We mult take care to fend  
mign who ate equal to such trials.—  
The French have not, as yet gained  
any great and unjalt advantages of  
us by ali théir policy. Our envoys  
were precisely nfttu&amp;ed. Every ar.  
ticle was prelcribed that was to be  
intifted on as an ultimutum. Ina  
treary they could not depart from a  
punétiio. A convéntion they might  
make; as they did, at their own rifque.  
But the President and Senate were  
under no obligation to ratify it. Had  
it betrayed a single point of essential  
honor or interest, I would bave sent  
it back, as Mr. Jefferfon did the trea­  
‘ty with England, without laying it  
‘before the senate. It I had been  
doubtful, the senate would have deci-  
Where, then, was the danger of  
this pegotiation ? No where but in

it was fatal, and that ooly becagf

Si ES,y  
  
LN pamphiet, page 27, it is said that the  
great alteration in publick opinion had put it  
completely in the power of our executive to  
conwrol the machinations of uny future pub­  
lick agenty of France. Therelore Philade!-  
rahi? was a safer scene of megotiation thun  
aris. ‘ &quot;,  
~ Mr. Hamilton&#x27;s erroneous conceptions of  
the publick opinion may be excused by the  
considerations that he was not a native of the  
United States ; that he was born and bred in  
the West-Indies, till he went to Scotland, for  
educatien, where he spent his time in a sem-  
inary of learning; i seventeen years of age  
after which no men ever perfectly acquired  
‘&amp; nationa! character ; then entered a colledge  
at New-York, from whence he issued into the  
army as an aid de camp. In these situations  
he could scarcely acquire the opinions, frel­  
ings, or principles of the Amorgcuu people.  
His error may be excused by the further con­  
{ sideration, that his time was chiefly spent in  
bis pleazures, in Lis electioneering visits, con­  
{erences and correspondences, in propagating  
~prejudicesagainstevery men whom he thought  
ils superiour in the publick estimation ; und  
in composing wibitious reports upon finance,  
while the real business of the treasury was  
done by Duer, by Woolcot, end even, for some  
tine and m party by Tenche Coxe,  
His obscrvation that € France will never  
‘be without secret agents,” is true : and it is  
cqually trae that England will elweys have  
secret agents and emissaries too. % That her  
partizens amohg our own citizens, cah much  
better promote lier canse than eny ageits ehe  
can send, is also true &quot; bue it is ut least equal-  
Iy truc of the partizans of Great Britain, We  
huve seen, In the forggoing papers, glaring  
and attrocious instances -of the exertions of  
her publick agents, secret emissaries and par­  
tizans among our citizens. . But none heve  
vet been mentioned that bear any comparison,  
i point of guilt and arrogance, with those  
~of all kinds that huave been exhibited within  
the last two&#x27;or thiee years.  
My worthy fellow-citizens ! Our form of  
- government, inestimuble as it is, exposes us  
more than any other to the irfsidious intrigues  
and pestilented influence of foreimn nations,  
Nothing but our inflexible neutrality can pre­

to the alternate triumphs of -pu?ies,,exckcd&quot;. -

Never was &amp;\‘c A grosser mistake of pub­  
lick opinion, théh that of Mr. Hamilton. The  
great. alteration in publick opinion had not  
then, nowhas it yet, taken place. The French  
republick still &#x27;existed : The French pceople  
were still considered as struggling for libcw.  
amidst all their interpal revolutions, their  
conflicts of phrtics, and their bk.ody&quot;zya  
against the coalitions of European powers.  
Monarthy, empire, had not been suggested,

had acted on the publick stage in no civil or

nothing of the French cockades ostentations­

- Had a French minister been seen here  
with his suite, he would bave been im  
informed of every source and symptom of dis«  
content. Almast every Frenchmen vpen the  
continent, and they were then nutierous in  
all the States, would have been employed if  
criminating the American government, in ap-  
Blauding the cond;accush- of the French

hawe been kept secret. The pommur  
for peace on any terms would have been very  
difficulty i not impossible, to resist. The  
multitude in Philadelphia, us it was, were ale  
most as ripe to puil me out of my house, as  
they had been 1o dethrone Washington in  
the time of Genet. Even the night ofithe

- that before my deor, and kept in order only,us  
many people thought, by a militury pstrol, ore  
deved, [ belicve, by the Governour of Penn~  
sylvania, |  
In these circumstances, it was my opinion,  
and it is so stilly it .was infinitely better to  
conduct the negociation at Paris than in Phil.  
adeiphia. But if this was end is an. errour,  
it was cenninly not of such consequence as  
Hamilton thouvght fit 0 represent it, If je  
was an erroury, I humble conceive it would  
have beuer become Mr. Hamilion to have  
been silent, than to endesvour to make it un­  
popular—since the siep was taken and irrevee.  
cable, when he wrote.  
But the real truth isy he was in hepes, as  
well ag Mr Liston, that the French governs  
ment would neither send a minister here nor  
receive one there—in short, that they would  
have gone to war with us. If we had waited:  
for a miuistér here, much tune would have  
been lost : our little naval ferce under Talbat,  
Truxtony, Decatury Little, &amp;c. was dg)ﬂg wons

Some of our citizens were n?o wanting in irri

ship that bad been captured by Decatur up  
the Delaware, in sight of all the citizens ob  
Philadelphiaywith-the French nativnal colours

Loped that such provocations would produce  
an irreroncilcable breach and a declaration of  
war, Me was disupgoimcd ¢nd Jost the com­

My worthy fellow citizens !—Our form  
of government, inestimuble as it is, expo-  
ges us more than any other to the insidi-  
  
ous intrigues and pestilential influence of  
foreign nations.  
  
Nothing but our inflexi-  
bility and neutrality can preserve us— The  
  
lic negociations and secret intrigues of  
the English end the French have been  
employed for centuries in every country  
in Europe. | Look back to the history of  
Spain, Holland, Germany, Russia, Swe-  
den, Denmark, Prussia, Italy an¢ Turkey,  
for the last hundred years.— How many  
emperors and kings have fallen victims to  
the alternate triumphs of parties excited  
by Englishmen or Frenchmen? and can  
We expect to escape the vigilant attention  
of politicians so experienced, so keen and  
sp rich? If we convince them that our  
attachment to neutrality is unchargeable,  
they will let us alone ; but as long as a  
hope exists in either pew, of seducing  
us to engage in a war on his side and a-  
gainst his enemy, we shall be torn and con-  
vulsed by their maneuvers.”  
  
” Never was there a grosser mistake of  
public opinion, than that of Mr. Hamil-  
ton.— The great alteration in publig opin-  
jon had not then, nor has it yet, taken  
  
ace. The French republic still existed :  
  
‘he Prench people were still considered  
¥S Struggling for liberty amidst ali their  
iMternal revolutions, their conflicts of pare  
Wes, and their bloody wars against the co-  
alitions of European powers.—Monarchy,  
cmpuc, bad net beca suggested. Bona-  
  
  
  
parte had appeared only as a soldier; hod  
  
acted on the stage in no civil or political  
  
employment. A sense of gratitude, for  
acrvices rendered us in our revolution, by  
far more sincere and ardent than reason or  
  
justice could warrant, still rematned on thr  
minds not only of our refrublicans, but of  
great numbers of our soundest federalisia  
  
—Did Mr. Hamilton recotlect the state of  
our presses ? Recollect the names and fiot-  
ular eloquence of the editors of the oftfosi-  
tion fiefiers? That scoffirg wit, and that  
caustic malignity of aoul which appeared so  
remarkably in ail the writings of Thomas  
Paine and Callender, which to*the disgrace  
of human nature, never fails to command  
attention and afifilauee? Tux MFMBERS  
or THE SENATE AND THE HoUsF, wuo  
WERE DECIDEDLY AGAINST TEE AD-  
MINISTRATION, THEIR CONTINUAL IN-  
TERCOURSK AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH  
FRENCH EMissantiEsS? ‘The hideous  
clamour ageinst the alien law, and sedition  
jaw, both considered .as Jevelled entirely  
against the French and their friends, and  
the surrender according to the British  
treaty of the Irish murderer Nash, impos-  
ed upon the public for Jonathan Robbins?  
Dip HE RECOLLECT TNE INSURRECTION  
iy PennsytvAnta? The upviversal and  
  
rpetual inflammatory publications a-  
gainst the land tax, stamp tax, coach tex,  
excise law and 8 per cent. loan? Did he  
never sce no hear of the circular letters  
of members of Congress from the middle  
and southern states? Did he know noth-  
ing of the biting sarcasms, the burning  
rage, against himself and his own army?  
Did he know nothing of a kind of journal  
that was published of every irregular act  
of any officer or soldier, of every military  
punishment that was inflicted, under the  
appellation of the Cannibal’s progress ?  
i see nothing of the French cockades  
iously exhibited against the Ameris  
es ?  
  
a French minister been sent here  
with his suite, he would have been instantly  
informed of every source and symptom of dis-  
content. Almost every Frenchman uficn the  
continent, and they were then numerous in  
all the states, would have been employed in  
criminaling the American government, tn afi-  
filauding the condescention of the French di«  
reciory, and the friendly, conciliating disfioe  
sition of the J’rench nation. Nothing could  
have been kept secret ; the popular damor  
for peace on any terms would have been  
very difficult, if not impossible to resist.  
The multitude in Philadelphia, as # was,  
were almost rifie to fiull me out of my house  
as they had been io dethrone Washiagton in  
thé lime of Genet. Even on the night of the  
  
JSast day, the streets were crowded with mul-  
titudinous assemblages of freofile, esfiecially  
that before my door, and kefit in order only.  
as many people thought, by a military parol,  
ordered, I believe, by the governor ef Penn-  
sylvania.”
