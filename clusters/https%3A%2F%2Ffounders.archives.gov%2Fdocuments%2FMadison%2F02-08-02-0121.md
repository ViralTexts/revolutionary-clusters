Sir,  
Washington 3 October 1804  
Having been absent from Phila. for these 18 days past &amp; travelled far into a part of Virginia, where I had no opportunity to see the late newspapers from the Northward, it is but to day on my return to Washington, I have been apprised of a publication highly injurious to my character, which under the garb of sworn evidence, has been made by a certain W. Jackson of Philada. in the paper of which he is the Editor called the Political Register.  
Had the said evidence appeared isolated wth. no other weight but the Name of the Editor &amp; the circumstance, of his Deposition I would have treated his malicious attack with the silence of contempt, as all the facts therein related, even when true would not prove I have violated the Laws of this Country nor the Duties of my Station, but a letter from the President of the United States to Jackson having been circulated along with his evidence, this circumstance alone, altho the President does not declare his own Opinion, upon the Subject stamps this affair with a degree of importance it would have been otherwise divested of.  
For this reason &amp; for the respect I owe to the President of the United States, to this Goverment &amp; to myself, I have thought proper in thus addressing you, to enter into the explanation of this transaction innocent in itself, consonant with the Laws of the Country proper in my station &amp; which cannot be disfigured even by the artifice of insidious malignity.  
In a Country where the liberty of the press prevails its use must be a shield of defence as it is an instrument of attack, this is consonant with Justice &amp; congenial with the principle of equal rights, it is then legal to establish a defence by the press against the attacks made thro the medium of the press.  
This sacred principle of self defence is as inherent in political States as it is into individuals, &amp; when an offence is thus made against a Sovereign which cannot be brought into a Court of Justice, it is not only the right but also it is the duty of the representative of that Sovereign or Nation to repel the attack with the same weapons which are made use of for his Injury.  
Were the foreign Ministers to be deprived of this right, enjoyed by every individual who breathes the air of the United States, they would be reduced to the sad condition of distinguished Slaves in the very centre of the Land of Liberty. For some time past some of the Philada. Newspapers had published paragraphs &amp; circulated comments about the existing differences between the King of Spain &amp; the United States, mutilating facts, altering circumstances and drawing false conclusions highly contrary to the character of Justice &amp; generosity so often &amp; so magnanimously proved by the King my Master. I myself was pointed out as the Author of some letters from Cadiz &amp; Madrid, altho I never Knew of them but by the Newspapers &amp; with the same injustice, an abusive paragraph against the President was since attributed to me, thus the Public mind has been poisoned with incorrect accounts and obnoxious conclusions—under such circumstances I believed then &amp; I believe now it was not only my right but also my duty to check the torrent of impressions as contrary to truth as to the Interest of my country, being very well acquainted with the great influence of public opinion in a popular Govermt. as that of the United States, with a just intention of bringing the subjects of discussion under a forcible point of view, which had been carefully concealed and presenting them to the Public eye under new aspects &amp; apprehending that the Editors who had previously espoused a party on the question would refuse to insert in their papers my intended publication, I thot that Mr. Jackson among others would not perhaps have the reluctance which I anticipated in the former. I requested him to call upon me &amp; having acceeded to my request, after a desultory conversation about the news of the Day of Mr. Pinckney having called for his passports (my apprehensions of the result of the rash step) &amp; the detriment which would prove a War, between two Nations, invited by their reciprocal interests to the preservation of Peace, I told him he could do more good to his Country by advocating the cause of Peace than by the Warlike principles he was proclaiming in his paper, I dwelt a while upon this topic &amp; finished by bringing forward the only object of our meeting &amp; telling him that if those disposed, I could give to him for publication explanations &amp; elucidations wch. could not fail to be favourable to the cause of Peace &amp; that for his trouble he would have the acknowledgement that would be proper, those were my only words upon this head in all the course of our Conversation in this offer I had in view but the just compensation which is due to an Editor of a Newspaper full of advertisemts. as Mr. Jacksons for the room that my intended essays would have occupied in his Gazette or a reward for his labour if he was to take upon himself to couch my ideas in a more correct language than I could do myself. Surely the honor of a Man, who is in the habit of retailing the Space of his paper by lines should not be hurt at a just compensation which was offered, when it was questioned of occupying some colums of it, &amp; Mr. Jackson is less excusable in the perversion of my meaning (converting under Oath a mere surmise of his, into the affirmation of a fact) as I repeatedly told him “Sir, this is not a diplomatic intrigue it is a plain case and if there was any thing dishonourable in it, I would be the last Man to propose it &amp; you would be the last Man to whom it would be proposed by me.[”] Why Mr. Jackson has omitted in his affidavit these expressions of mine so illustrative of my true meaning is better Known to himself, but if he is a Man of honor I defy him to deny them &amp; leave to your consideration sir if he [sic] had been my intention to persuade a person to an improper conduct I would have been so aukward as to bring the sentiments of the most scrupulous honor before his eyes, It is then evident that Mr. Jackson has perverted the meaning of the compensation offered &amp; this is the more ridiculous as the only thing which in rigour was contemplated by me was the Mechanical part of his office, that is the printing of my publications. He [sic] could be apprehended that a foreign Minister would risque an intrigue to bribe directly or indirectly a high officer of a Crown, Depositary of the secrets of State &amp; Director of its measures, but to bribe Mr. Jackson the Editor of a Newspaper whose sheets are scarcely to be seen across the waters of the Schuylkill &amp; of the Deleware, without a place in the Goverment, without personal influence, to bribe him for the typographical publication of ideas which were not his own by their nature perfectly harmless &amp; legal is a conjecture only to be suggested by a wicked Heart or a miserable head. I repeat that the only apprehended refusal of the Editors who had espoused a side of the question contrary to my ideas, determined me to call on the said W Jackson but altho I consider him a Man of some talents he is highly deceived if he supposes I could mistake his pen for the Key to the temple of Janius.  
Where is then what he so very politely is pleased to term my infamous purpose? is it in the elucidations or explanations proposed? surely not as he Knew very little of them &amp; even if Known they were perfectly innocent, was it in their tendency? that is impossible, when their object was by his own confession the peace &amp; advantage of our two Countries, Was it in the attempt of publishing them? it is demonstrated that in such circumstances I have not only the right but it was even my duty to do it, was it in the tender of the compensation? it is evident there was no more indelicacy in this proceeding than there is in the offer or the present of a fee to a Lawyer or to a Physician, where is then the offence to Mr. Jackson’s honor or to the rights of his Country?  
If Mr. Jackson has proceeded with a culpable levity in affirming under Oath that he had penetrated my infamous purpose when it is evident he had completely mistaken it, He has not been the less incorrect in asserting upon oath that I had mentioned to him to have myself received a letter from New Orleans wch. Stated that there was a letter at that place in Mr. Jeffersons own hand writing, which declared that if the Settlers between the Mississippi &amp; the Rio Perdido would raise the American Colours they should be supported, no sir, it is not true altho given under Oath by Mr. Jackson that I had received such a letter, I only told him in the way of conversation &amp; not for any other purpose whatever that there were in Philada. one or two letters from New Orleans mentioning the above account, I never informed him I had received one as in reality this was not the case, that such letter or letters under the abovementioned date, have been written from New Orleans is a fact Known by some people in the City, I myself have seen one of them directed to a very respectable person in Philada. &amp; if authorised by him would mention his Name, but after the Presidents declaration, I am convinced of the falsehood of the assertion &amp; persuaded calumnies can be invented &amp; propagated with the same facility in New Orleans as they are done in Philada.  
This sir is the History of this transaction ridiculously magnified by Mr. Jackson, who has presented it to the Public with as much Solemnity as if he had discovered the Gunpowder plot or the Conspiracies of Fiesque &amp; of Bedmar all the heinous crime is that I wished to make use with Decency &amp; decorum of the incontestible right I posses of self defence, applying it to my Sovereign &amp; to my Country, the intended elucidations have since appeared in other papers under the Signature of Graviora Manent &amp; by the perusal of those essays you may easily Judge if their contents are of a nature to bribe Mr. Jackson with any acknowledgement as he declares in his evidence or if there is in them to be found a single expression contrary to the respect due to this Goverment or to this Country the use I have made of the Liberty of the press cannot be disputed without attacking the Constitution as the Law does not consider in its salutary restrictions the publisher but the publication &amp; if this does not infringe the Law it would be a criminal attempt to restrain any person in the United States from the exercise of this sacred right this is Sir what was intended to be done &amp; has since been done by me: my means have been just &amp; legal my object pure &amp; benevolent &amp; can only give offence but to persons who groaning under pique &amp; disappointment establish their expiring hopes of retrieving their shattered fortunes on the Public calamities of a War, for such persons the Doctrine of advocating peace cannot be but High Treason.  
I would have demanded from this Govt. the punishmt of the said Jackson for the offence of converting a mere surmise of his into the affirmation of a fact &amp; employed under his perverted idea an infamous &amp; defamatory language had I not anticipated that when the particulars of this letter shall be Known to the Public I shall be completely avenged by the severity of his feelings.  
Altho the Vindication of my conduct exclusively belongs to my King &amp; Goverment a favourable opinion of the good people of America is far from being indifferent to me for the reason &amp; for the degree of interest &amp; importance that the circulation of the Presidents letter has impressed into this affair I have thus condescended publickly to notice an incorrect affidavit with unjust and abominable conclusions. With Sentiments of high consideration I have the Honor to be Sir, Your mo Ob St  
El Marques de casa Yrujo  
P⟨.⟩ S. I have reserved to the last what Mr. Jackson has mistakenly introduced to imply that I had assumed a Contemptious Style by refusing to term the Administration the Goverment.  
On this head I am particularly desirous of vindicating myself as it is so foreign to my disposition. In truth during the Debates of Congress in 1798 I learnt the difference between the two terms &amp; in Speaking to Mr. Jackson I mentioned the Administration &amp; added “not to say Goverment” thereby meaning to distinguish between the administration &amp; the three branches of the Legislature which constitute the Goverment. Thus this apparently disrespectfull language evinces only the cautious precision of a foreigner.  
  
So many misconstructions if they had not been given upon Oath I could not have suspected of being accidental.

chara&amp;ter, which, under the garb of fworn  
evidence has been made by a certain W:  
Jackfon of Philadelphia in the paper of  
which he is the Editor, called the Political  
Regifter.  
  
Had the faid evidence appeared ifolated  
with no other weight but the name of the  
Editor and the circum ftances of his depo.  
fitien, I would have treated his malicious  
attack with the filence of contempt as all  
the faéts therein related even when true  
would not prove | had violated the laws of  
this courtry nor the duties of my fasion,  
but a letter from the Prefident of the Uni.  
ted S:ates to Jackfon having been circu.  
lated along with his evidence, this circum.  
ffance alone, although the Piefident does  
not exprefs his opinion upon the fubjeQ  
ftamps this affair with a degree of impor.  
tance, it would have been otherwife dj.  
vefled of,  
  
For this reafon and for the refpe€l-_I owe  
to the Prefident of the United Srates, to  
this government and to my felf, I have tho&#x27;t  
proper ia thus addrefling you, to enter in.  
to the explanation of this tranfaétion, jn.  
nocent, in itfell, confonant with the laws  
of the country, proper in my flation, and  
which cannot be disfigured by the artifice  
of infidious malignity.  
  
In a country where the liberty of the  
prefs prevails, its ufe muft be a fhield of  
defence, as it is‘an inftrument of attack,  
This is confonant with jaftice and con-  
genzal with the principal of equal rights,  
wis then legal to eflablith adetence by the  
prefs againft the attacks made through the  
medium of the prefs. This facred prin.  
ple of felf-defence is as inherent tu polit.

1s the daty of the reprefentutive of that fo-  
vereign or nation to repel the attack  
with the fame weapons, which are made  
ufe of for bis injary.  
Were the foreign Minifters to be de-  
prived of this right, e: joyed by every ine  
dividual who breathes the air of the Unit.  
ed States, they would be reduced to the  
fad condition of d:flingurfhed flaves inthe

thought that Mr. Jackfon, among others,  
would not perhaps have the reluctance

acceded to my requeil, atier a defulory

(my apprehenfions of the rafh flep).and  
the detriment which would arife,. trom  
a war between two nations invited by their  
reciprocal interefts tothe prefervation of  
peace, I told him he could do more good  
to his country by advocating peace, than  
by the warlike psinciples he was proclaim-  
inginhis paper. I dwelt a while upon this  
  
topic and finifhed by bring&#x27;ng torward the |

that if fo difpofed, I could give to him tor

which could not fail to be favorable to the

would navethe acknowl: y ment that would

altho’ I confider him a man of fome ta!-  
ents, he is highly deceived if he fuppofes  
1 could miftake his pen for the key to the  
temple of Janus.  
  
Where 1s then what he fo very politely  
is pleafed to term my infamous purpose?  
Is it in the elucidations or explanations  
propofed ? Surely not, as he knew very lit-  
tle of them, and even if known they were  
perfe&amp;ily innocent; Was it in their ten-  
dency ? that is impoflible, when their ob-  
je&amp;t was by his own confeflion the peace

it in the attempt of publifhing them ? it is

P. S. I have referved to the laft what Mr.

~ On this head I am particularly defirous  
of vindicating myfelf, as it is fo foreign to  
my difpofition—In ‘truth during the de-  
bates of Congrefs in 1798, I learnt the dif-  
ference between the two terms, and in  
{peakingto Mr. Jackfon, I mentioned the  
  
adminiftration and added ‘* not to fay go- ’  
  
vernmert,” thereby meaning to diftinguith  
between the adminiftration and the’ three  
branches of the Legiflature which confti-  
tuté the government—Thus this apparently  
difrefpeétful language evinces only the  
cautious précifion of a foreigner,  
  
So many mifconflru€tions, itthey had not

into apart of Virginia where I had no

t.iat Tvl*. Jackfon among others  
t perhaps have the relu&amp;ance

bed by bringing forward the on­  
of our verting and telling him

icaticn explanation, and eluci­  
which could not fail to be favo­  
rable to the cause ofpecce, and that for  
li* trouble he would have the acknow­  
ledgement that would be proper ; thofe  
were my only words upon th:s head in  
&#x27; all the cwurfe of our converfation,  
in this offer I had in view but  
the juft compenfation which is due  
to an editor of a newfpaper full of ad-  
Ycr.ifements as Mr. Jackfon&#x27;s for the  
room that my intended effays would  
have occupied in his Gazette, or a re­  
ward for his labour if he was to take  
upm bimfe) f to couch my ideas in a more  
correct language than I could do it my­  
felf. Surely the honor of a man who is  
in the habit of retailing the fpace of his  
paper by lines fhould not be hurt 2t a  
juft compenfation wlmh waa off-red,  
when it was qutftioned of occupying  
fome colu nni of it, and Mr, Jackfon is  
lefs excuiable in the per verb on of my  
meaning (converting under oath a nur&lt;e  
fur.nife o. his into the affirnv-tion of a  
faft) as I repeatedly tr Id him, ** Sir,  
this is nut a diplomatic intrigue, it is a  
plain case, and if there was any thing  
dishonourable in it I would be the last  
man to propose it, and you would be &#x27;he  
last man to whom it would be proposed  
by me.&quot; Why Mi. Jackfon has omitted  
in his affidavit theft; expreffions ol mine,  
fo illuftnrivi- of my true meaning, is  
better known to himfelf, but if he is a  
man of honor I de*y him to deny them ;  
id leave td your conftdcration, Sir, if it  
d been my intention to perfuade a  
rfon to an improper conduct I would  
ye been fo awkward as to bring the  
itiments of the moft fciupulous honor  
Fore bis eyes ; it is then evident that  
Mr. Jackfon h*s perverted the meaning  
of the compenfation offered, and this is  
the more ridicufous as the only thing  
which in rigour was contemplated by me  
waa the mechanical parr of his office,  
that is tie printing of my publications ;  
it could b- apprehended that a foreign  
minifter would rifque an intrigue to bribe J  
dir.-ftly or indirectly a high officer of a  
  
and director of &gt;U rrttafurcr, hut to br-be  
Mr. Jackfon, the Ediior of a newfpa- :  
per whofe fliaetg are fcarCelyto be feen  
acrofs the waters of the Schuylkill and  
the Delaware, without a place in the  
Government, without perfonal influ­  
ence, to bribe br*n for the typographical I  
publication of idea, which were not his  
own, by their nature perfectly harml-ls  
and lepal, is a conjecture only to be lug­  
gefted by a wicked heait or a mifetablc )  
head. I repeat that the only appr: I  
ed refufal of the hditors who had ef- \
poufed a fide of th. qu-ftion contrary to i  
my idens dietr-rrmneu me to call on the  
faid W. Jackfon ; hut al.ho&#x27; I confnler  
him a man of Come talents, he ii highly  
deceived if he fuppo.es I could milhk­  
his pen for the key to the temple of I  
Janus.  
Where is then what he f &gt; v-ry polite &#x27;  
ly is nleafed to term my infamous pur &#x27;  
pose ? Is it in the elucidations or exola­  
nations propofed ? Surely not as he j  
knew very little of them, and even if  
known they were pert&gt;d\ly innocent. Was  
it in their tendency ? that is impoffible  
when their object was by his own contef­  
uon the peace and advantage of cur two  
countries ; was it in the attempt of pub­  
lifhing them i it is demonftrated th*t in  
fuch circumftances I have not only the  
right, but it was even my duty ta do it ;  
wa- it in the tender of the compenfati­  
on ? it is evident there was no more in- .  
delicacy in this proceeding than there I  
is in the eff-r or three prefent of a fee to &#x27;  
a lawyer or to a phyficia ; where is then  
the offence to Mr. Jackfon&#x27;i honor or to  
the rights of his country ?  
If Mr. Jackfon has proceeded wi h a  
culpable levity and affirming under oath &#x27;  
that he had penetrated my infamous  
purpose when it is evident be had com ,  
pletely mistaken it, he has been not i  
lefs incorrect- in alTerting upon oath  
that I had mentioned to him to h.;ve  
myself received a letter from New O -;  
leans, which ftated th-re was a letter  
at that place in Mr JelTerfon&#x27;s hind  
writing which declared that if the l&#x27;t­  
tiers between the Mi(TilTij*pi and the Rio  
Perdldo would raife the American co- |  
louii they fhould be fupported. No, Ur, &#x27;  
it is not true altho&#x27; given under oath I y  
Mr. Jackfon, that I had received fuch a  
letter. I only told him in the way ol  
converfuion, and not for any other rur- :  
pofe whatever, that there were in Pi-ila- |  
delphia one or two letters from New Or- i  
leans, mentioning the above *rcount. 1  
I never informed h&#x27;m I had received one,  
as in reality this was not the cul ; that !  
fuch letter or letteis, under the ab ve­  
men&#x27;tioned date, have been wrhtel f ni

of them directed to a very refpectabU

by him I would mention his name, but

and perfuaded that calumnies can be in-,  
vented and propagated with the fame fa­

in Philadelphia.  
This, Sir, is the hiftory of this tranf­

Hiving been abfent from Philadelphia for  
tliefe 18 days pall, and travelled far into a part  
of Virginia where I had no opportunity to fee  
the late newfpapers from the northward, it is  
but to-day on my return to Walhington, I have  
been apprifed ol a publication highly injurious  
to ndy chara&lt;ftcr, which,under the garb offxvorn  
evidence, has heen made by a certain W. Jack­  
fon* of Philadelphia, in the paper of which he is  
  
me cuiwr caucu rne I&#x27;onucai txegnter.  
Had the faid evidence appeared ifolated, with  
no other weight but the name of the Editor and  
the circumftances of his depoiitlon, I would  
have treated his malicious attack with the fi­  
lence of contempt, as all the fads therein related  
even nvhen true, would not prove I had violated  
the laws ofthis country, northe duties of my  
ftition : but a letter from the Prefident of the  
United States to Jackfon, having been circulated  
along with his evidence, this circumftance ?ionc,  
although the Prefident does not exprefs his opi­  
nion upon the fubjelt, ftamps this afFair with a  
degree of importance, it would have been other­  
wife diverted of.  
For this reafon, and for the refpell I owe to  
the Prefident of the United States, to this go­  
vernment, and to myfelf, I have thought proper,  
in thus addrefiing you, to enter into the expla­  
nation ofthis tranfnlUon, innocent in itfelf, con­  
fonant with the laws of the country, proper in  
my Ration, and which cannot he disfigured even  
by the artifice of infidious malignity.  
In a country where the liberty of the prefs  
prevails, its ufe mnft he a fliield of defence, as it  
is an inftrumer.t of attack. This is confonant  
with juftice and congenial with the principle of  
equal rights, it is then legal to eftablifti a de­  
fence by the prefs againrt the attacks made thro’  
the medium of the prefs. This facred princi­  
ple of felf-defence is as inherent to political Rates  
as it is to individuals ; and when an offence is  
thus made againrt a fovereign which cAnnot be  
brought into a court of juftice, it is not only the  
right, but alfo, it is the duty of the reprefenta­  
tive of that fovereign or nation, to repel the at­  
tack with the fame weapons which are made  
ufe of for his injury.  
Were the foreign Minifters to be deprived of  
this right, enjoyed by every individual who  
breathes the air of the United States they  
would be reduced to the fad condition of di/lin­  
ru&#x27;t/heJJlaves in the very centre of the land of  
liberty. For fome time part fome of the Phila­  
delphia newfpapers had publifhed paragraphs  
and circulated comments about the exifting dif­  
ferences between the king of Spain and the U­  
nited States, mutilating falls, altering circum­  
ftances and drawing falfe conclufions highly  
contrary to the charaltcr of juftice &amp; generofity  
fo often and fo magnanimoufly proved by the  
king my mailer ; I myfelf was pointed out as  
the author of fome letters from Cadiz and Ma­  
drid, although I never knew of them but by the  
newfpapers, and with the fame injuftice,an abu­  
live paragraph againrt the Prefident was fince  
attributed to me ; thus the public mind was  
poifoned with incorrclt accounts and obnoxious  
conclufions—under fuch circumftances I believ­  
ed then, and 7 believe nozu, it was not only my  
right but alfo my duty to check the torrent of  
  
&quot;&quot;wmiHNi:. v. vj! 111 i y uniuuid.s iu uic lllicrcir  
of my country. Being very well acquainted  
with the great influence of public opinion in a  
popular government as is that of the United  
States, with a juft intention of bringing the fub­  
jefts of d.fcuflK&gt;n Under a forcible point of view  
which had been carefully concealed, and pre­  
fentingthein to the public eye under new af­  
pevfts, and apprehending that the editors who  
had previoufly efpoufed a party on the quefti­  
on would refufe toinfert in their papers my in­  
tended publication, I thought that Mr. Jackfon  
among others would not perhaps have the re­  
in fiance which F anticipated in the former. I  
requefted him to call upon me and having ac­  
ceded to my requeft, after a defultory conver­  
lition about the news of the day, of Mr. Pinck­  
ney having called for his paff&#x27;ports (my appre­  
henlions of theMfh ftep ’ and that the detriment  
which would arife from a war between two na­  
nations invited by their reciprocal iaterefts to  
the prefervation of peace, I told him lie could  
do more good to bis country by advocating  
peace,than by the warlike principles, he was  
proclaiming in his paper—1 dwelt a while up­  
on this topic and finilhed by bringing forward  
the only obirfl of our meeting and telling him  
that it fo difpofed, I could give to him for pub­  
lication explanations and elucidations which  
could not fail to be favorable to the caufe of  
peace, and that for his trouble he would have the  
acknowledgment that would he proper; thofe  
were my only words upon this head in all the  
courfe of our convocation, in this offer I had in  
view but the juft compenfation which is due to  
an editor of a newf&#x27;papcr full of advertifements  
as Mr. Jackfon’l for the room that my intended  
effays would have occupied in his Gazette, ora  
reward for his labour if he was to take upon  
himfelf to couch my ideas in a more correct lan­  
guage than I could doit myfelf. Surely the ho­  
nor of a man who is in the habit of retailing the  
Ipace of his paper by lines fljould not be hurt at  
a juft compenwtion which was offered, when it  
was queftioned of occupying fume columns of  
it, ami Mr. Jackfon is lefs excufable in the  
the pervei lion of my meaning (converting under  
on!h a mere furmife of his into the affirmation  
of a faift) as I repeatedly told him, “ Sir, this is  
  
not a diplomatic intritue, it is n •*&gt;/ tin cafe, end if  
there was any thin \ dijhororalle in it 1 would he  
the lad man to propofe it, and you would he the  
lad man to whom it-would Ite propofed hr me.”  
Why Mr. Jaekfon has omitted in hi.; affidavit  
thefe expreifions of mine, fo illustrative of my  
true meaning, is better known t&#x27;» himfelf, hut if  
he is a man of honor 1 defy him to deny them t  
and leave to your eonfideratioh, Sir, if it had  
been my intention to perfuade a perfoa to an  
improper conduct I would have been to awk­  
ward as to bring the fentiments of the mod  
fcrupulous honor before hiseyes ; it is then evi­  
dent that Mr. Jaekfon has perverted the mean­  
ing of the cumpenfation offered, and this is the  
more ridiculous as the only thing which in ri­  
gotr was Contemplated by me was the mecha­  
nical part of his office, that is the printing of my  
publications: itcould.be apprehended that a  
f oreign minilter would rifque an intrigue to  
i bribe directly or indirectly a high officer of a  
! Crown, depofitary of the fee rets of Rate  
and director of its meafurcs, but to bribe Mr.  
j Jaekfon, the Editor of a newfpaper whole  
! iheots are fcarcely to he leen acrofs the waters of  
[the Schuylkill and the Delaware, without a  
j place in the Government, without perfonal in­  
I fllienee, to bribe him for the typographical pub*  
jlication of ideas which were not his own, by  
I their nature perfectly harmlcfs and legal, is a  
conjecture only to be fnggeftd by a wicked heart  
or a miferable head. I repeat that the only ap­  
prehended refufal of the Editors who had ef­  
poufed a fide of the queftion contrary to my  
ideas determined me to call on the faid W. Jack­  
fon ; but although I confider him a man of fomc  
talents, he is highly deceived if he fuppofes I  
could miftake his pen for the key to the temple  
of Janus.  
Where is then what he fo very politely is  
pleafed to term my infamous pnrpofe ? Is it in  
the elucidations or explanations propofed ?  
Surely not as he knew very little of them, and  
even if known they were perfectly innocent.  
Was it in their tendency? that is impoffible,  
when their ohjeift was by his own confeffion the peace  
and advantage nf our two countries ; was it in the at­  
tempt of publifiling them ? it is demonftrated that in  
fuch circmnftances I have not only the right, hut it  
was even my duty to do it J was it in the tender of  
the compensation ? it is evident there was no more in­  
delicacy in this proceeding than there is in the offer  
ot- the prefent of a fee to a lawyer dr a phyfician ;  
where is then the offence to Mr. Jackfor.&#x27;s honour or  
to the rights of his country* ?  
  
ii -*ir. jauuon nas proceeded witna culpable levity  
&amp; affirming under oath that he had penetrated my infa­  
mous purpofe when it is evident he had completely mis­  
taken it, he has br-n riot lefs incorrect in afTerting upon  
oath that I had mentioned to him to have mwfeif receiv­  
ed a letter from New-Orleans, which dated there was  
a letter at that place in Mr. Tefferfon’s hand writing  
which declared that if the fettlers between the Miffii­  
fippi and the P.io Perdido would taife the American  
colours they (hould be fiipported. No, fir, it is not  
true altho&#x27; given under oath by Mr. Jackfon, that 1  
had received fuch a letter. I only told him in the way  
of converfation, and not for any other purpofe what­  
ever, that there were in Philadelphia one or two let­  
ters from New-Orleans, mentioning the above account.  
1 never informed him 7 had received one, as in reality  
this was not the cafe; that fuch letter or letters, un­  
der the abovementioned date, have been written from  
New-Orleans is a fad known by fome people in the  
city. 7 myfdf have feen one of them direded to a very  
refpedable perfon in Philadelphia, and if authorifed  
by him I would mention his name, but after the Prefi­  
dent&#x27;s declaration I am convinced of the falfehood of  
the affection, and perfuadtd that Calumnies can he in­  
vented and propagated with the fame facility in New­  
Orleans as they are done ih Philadelphia.  
1 his, fir, is the hifiory of this tranfadion, ridicu­  
lnufly magnified by Mt. Jackfon who has prefented  
it to the public, with as much folemnity, as if he had  
difeovered the gun-powder plot, or the confpiracies of  
Fiefque and of Bedmur—all the heinous crime is that  
I wilhed to make ufe with decency and decorum of  
the inconte/Iihle right 7poffefs of felf defence applying it  
to my foVereign and to my country ; the intended elu­  
cidations have fince appeared in other papers under  
the fignatufe of Oraviora Manent, and by the peru­  
fal of thole effays, you may eafily judge if their con­  
tents are of a nature to bribe Mr. Jackfon with any  
acknowledgement, as he declares in his evidence, or if  
there is in them to be found a fingle expreflion contra­  
ry to the refped due to the government or to this  
country ; the ufe I have made of the liberty of the  
prefs cannot be difputcd without attacking the confti­  
tution, as the law does not confider in its falutary  
reftridious the publiflier but the publication, and if  
this does not infringe the law, it would he a criminal  
attempt to reftrain any perfon in the United States  
from the exercife of this facred right; this is, fir,  
what was intended to be done and has fince been done  
by me: my means have been juft and legal, my ob­  
ject pure and benevolent, and can only givj offence  
but to perfons, who groaning under pique and difap­  
pointinsnt eftablilh their expiring hopes of retrieving  
their fluttered fortunes, on the public calamities of a  
war, for fuch perfons the do&amp;rine of advocating peace  
cannot be but high tieafon.  
  
- uavc uniwuub-u irom mis government the  
punilhment of the faid Jackfon, for the offence of  
converting a mere furmife of his into the affirmation  
of a fadl, and employed under his perverted idea an  
infamous and defamatory language, had I not antici­  
pated that when the particulars of this letter ffiall he  
know n to the public I (hall be completely avenged by  
the feverity of his feelings.  
Although the vindication of my condudl exclufively  
belongs to my King and government, a favourable  
opinion of the good people of America is far from  
being indifferent to me. For the reafon and for the  
degree of interefl and importance that the circulation  
of the Prcfidcnt&#x27;s letter has imprefTed into this affair,  
I have thus condefcended publicly to notice an in­  
corrrFt affidavit with unjuft and abominable conclufi­  
nus. With fentimenM of high confideration,  
I have the honor to he, Sir,  
Your moll obedient humble ferv’t.  
EL MARQUIS DF. CASA YRITJO.  
y&lt;tniu Madifon, Efq.  
Wafliington, Oc­  
tober 2, 1804.  
P. S. 1 have referred to the lift what Mr. Jackfon  
has mifhkenly introduced to imply that I had affumed  
a contemptuous ftyle by refufing to term the adminijir.t­  
tion “ the government.&quot;  
On this head I am particularly defirous of vindi­  
cating myfelf, as it is fo foreign to my difpofition.—^  
In truth during the debates of Conprefs in 179S, I  
learnt the difference between the two terms, and in  
fpeaking to Mr. Jackfon, I mentioned the adminiftra­  
tion and added “ not to fay government,” thereby  
meaning to diflingmfh between the adminiftration and  
the three branches of the legiffaturc which conftitutc  
the government.—&#x27;Thus this apparently difrefpedtful  
language evinces only the cautious pteci (ion of a fo­  
reigner.  
So many mifconftm&lt;ftions, if they had not hecn  
given upon oath, I could not have fufpe&amp;ed of being  
accidental

i idiculous as the only thing which in rigour  
was conlempht&#x27;cd by me was tlte mecha­

ate scarcely to be seen across the waters

out a place in the government, with­  
out personal influence, to bribe him for  
the typographical publication of ideas  
vhich were not hi* own, hv their natuic  
perieolly harmless and legal, is u conjee­  
Uite only to be suggested by a wicked

to cull on th* sauf W. Jackson hut aidin&#x27;  
1 consider him a man of some talents, he  
is highly dec* ived if he supposes 1 toui.!  
mistake his pen for the key lo the tcinpic

licit; i^i tncii wiiai iic sn verv  
is pleased to term mu infamous purpose i  
I» »t in the elucidations or explanation­  
proposed ? Surely nut as he knew very  
little of them, and even if known they  
were perfect! r innocent. Was it in their  
tendency ? that is impossible when tin i­  
object was by Ins own confession t/irpcuce  
and adxmntage of our two countries ; wa­  
it in the attempt of publishing them ? it  
is demonstrated that in such circumstan­  
ces 1 have not only the right, but it w-a&gt;  
even toy duty to do it ; vtas it in the trn  
dor of the compensation ? it is evident  
there was no more indelicacy in this pro­  
ceeding than there is in the offer or the  
present of a fee to a lawyer o- to a physi­  
cian ; wiicte is then tlie offence lo Mr.  
Jack-son&#x27;* honor or to the rights of Im  
country ?  
If Mr. J -rkson has proceeded with a  
culpable levity and alhrnting under oath  
that he had penetrated mv infamous pur­

mistaken it, he lias been not less incorrcdl

it is not true altho’ given under oa’h by  
Mr. Jackson that I had received such s  
letter. 1 only &#x27;oi l him in the way oTcon­

whatever, that th re iv re in Philadelphia

oiity this was not the ease : that such let­

he wishes the good opinion ot  
the people of America. He cannot expect to obtain  
it by insulting the laws and usages not only of this but  
of all other nations : :yid although the people arc  
unfortunately split into parties, they are cue when  
their own good sense is insulted or their rights ir­  
vaded. The people of America hold the liberty cf  
the press in high estimation ; but we hope ihev never  
will wish to extend it to the limits designed for it bj  
this Minister of Spain.  
The following letter, communicated to the Sccretarj  
of State, is published at the request of the maruuu  
dc Cara Yrujo.  
Sir,  
Having been absent from Philadelphia, for these 18  
days past, and liav ing travelled far into a part ot V ir­  
ginia where I had no opportunity to see the lute news­  
papers from tiie northward ; it&quot;is but to-day, on in)  
return to Washington, I have been apprised of a  
publication highly injurious to my character, winch  
under the garb of sworn evidence, li .s been made by  
a certain \V. Jackson, of Philadelphia, in the payer  
of which lie is the editor, called the Political Regis­  
ter.  
Had tl .• said evidence appeared isolated, .with no  
other weight but the name of the editor and the cir­  
cumstances of his deposition, J &gt;■ ould have treated  
liis malicious attack with the silence of contempt, as  
all the facts therein related even when true, would  
not prov e I had violated the laws of this country nor  
the duties of my station; but a letter from the Presi­  
dent of the United States to Jackson, having been  
circulated along with his evidence, this circumstance  
alone, although the President does not express his  
opinion upon the subject, stamps this affair with a  
degree of importance, it would have been otherwise  
divested of.  
For tins reason and for the respect I owe to the  
President of the United St.«tes, to this government  
and to myself, I have thought proper in tiius address­  
ing you, to enter into the explanation of this trans­  
action, innocent ill itself, consonant with the laws of  
the country, proper in my station, and which cannot  
be-disfigured even by the artifice of insidious malig­  
nity.  
in a country where the liberty of the press prevails,  
its use must be a shield of defence, as it is an instru­  
ment of attack. This is consonant with justice and  
congenial with the principle of equal rights, it is then  
legal to establish a defence by the pressirgainst the  
attacks made through the median cf the press. This  
s icred principle of self defence is as inherent to po­  
litical states, as it is to individuals, and when an of­  
fence is thus made against a sovereign who cannot be  
brought into a court of justice, it is not only the right,  
but also, it is the duty of the representative oi that  
  
sovereign to repel the attack with the same weapons,  
which are made use of for his injury.  
Were the foreign ministers to lie deprived of this  
right, enjoyed by every individual who breathes the  
air of the United States, they would be reduced to  
the sad condition of distinguished slaves in the verv  
centre of the land of liberty. For some time past  
some of the Philadelphia newspapers had published  
paragraphs and circulated comments about the exist­  
ing diilerences between the king of Spain, and the  
United States, mutilating facts, altering circumstan­  
ces, and drawing false conclusions highly contrary to  
the character ot justice and generosity so often and so  
magnanimously proved by the king my master ; I  
myself was pointed out as the author of some letters  
from Cadi;: and Madrid, although I never knew of  
them but by the newspapers, and with the same in­  
justice, an abusive paragraph against the President  
was since attributed to me; thus the puhlick mind was  
poisoned with incorrect accounts and obnoxious con­  
clusions—under such circumstances I believed then,  
and I believe twvj, it was not only my right, but also  
my duty, to check the torrent of impressions, as con­  
trary to truth, as the interest of my country. Being  
very well acquainted with the great influence of pub­  
lick opinion m a popular government as is that of the  
United States, with a just intention of bringing the  
subjects of discussion under a forcible point of view  
which had been carefully concealed, awl presenting  
them to the publick eye under new aspects, and ap­  
prehending that the editors who had previously  
espousal a party on the question would refuse to in­  
sert in their papers my intended publication, 1 thought  
that Mr. Jackson, among others, would not perhaps  
have the reluctance which I anticipated in&#x27;tlie for­  
mer. I requested him to call upon me, and having  
acceded to my request, after desultory conversation  
almut the news ot the day, of Mr. Pinckney having  
called for his passports (my apprehensions of tin  
rash step) and the detriment which would arise from  
h war between two nations invited by their recipro­  
cal interests to the preservation of peace, I told him  
he could do more good to Lis country by advocating  
  
peace, then by the warlike principles he was f re­  
claiming in hir, paper. I dwelt a while upon this to­  
pic!: and finished bp bringing forward the only object  
of our meeting, and telling him that if so disposed, I  
could give to hiin for publication explanations and  
elucidations which could not fail to he favourable to  
the cause offi race, and that for Ins trouble he would  
have the acknowledgment that would he proper ;  
those were iny only woids upon this head in all the  
course of our conversation. 111 this offer 1 hud in  
view but the ju t compensation which is due to an  
editor cf a newspaper fil’d of advertisements as Mr.  
Jackson&#x27;s, fir the- room that my intended essays  
would have occupied in his (lazetie, or a reward for  
his labour if lie was to take upon himself to couch my  
ideas in a m re correct language than I cculd do it  
niytelf. Surely the honour of a man who is in the  
habit of retailing the space of bis papier be lines,  
should not be lint at a jot compensation which was  
offered, when it was questioned of occupying some  
columns of it; and Mr. Jackson is less excusable in  
the perversion of my meaning—(converting under  
&#x27; a h a mere surmise of his into the affirmation of a  
L fact)—as 1 repeatedly told him, “ Hir, this is not  
&#x27;i/.lonitiiick intrigue ; it is a /data case ; and i/ there  
teas unu thing dhh&#x27;W.urailc in it, 1 would be !hi  
hu t man to ‘■repos&lt;- it, and you would he the last man  
to whom it would he fircfu sed by me.” Whv Mr.  
Jackson has omitted in his affidavit these expressions  
af mine, so illustrative of nr; true meaning, is better  
known to I,&quot;m- elf ; but if lie is a man of honour I dsfv  
| hint to delq them ; and leave to your consider;;t:.:n,  
[ ; ir, if it had been mv intention to pci su.ale a person  
to an improper conduct. I would have been so auk­  
ward ns to bring the senthnon&#x27;s of the most scrupu­  
lous honour before his et or.. It is then evident that  
i Mr. Jackson has perverted the meaning of the cr.m­  
I ; eusution offered; and t.h:s is the mere ridiculnu;.,  
j a, thr only tiling winch in rigour was contemplated  
by me, was the mechanical part of his office, that is,  
[ the printing of my pub’ioatirns. It could lie appre­  
hended that a foreign minister would risk an intrigue  
t&quot; bribe, directly or indirectlv, a high officer of a  
crown, depositary of the secrets of state, and dilec­  
tor •■!&#x27;its measures; hut to. bribe Mr. Jackson, the  
editor ufu newspaj er whose sheotsare scarceh to be  
seen across the Waters ol the Ischuylkill and the De­  
laware, without a place in the government, without  
personal influence—to bribe him for the typographi­  
cal publication of ideas which were not his own, bv  
their nature perfectly harmless and legal, is a con­  
  
jcclitre only 10 no snggcsteii tty wi- !:cd heart or a  
miserable head. 1 repeat, that the- only apprehend­  
ed refusal of the editors who had croon&quot;,ed a side of  
the question contrary to toy ideas, determined me to  
call on said YV. Jackson ; hi t although 1 consider liim  
a man of some talents, he is highly deceived if he sup­  
poses 1 could mistake his {a n for the key to the tem­  
ple of J..mis.  
Where iv then what h so very politely is pleased  
to term my hijamoue fiur/nne ■&#x27; Is it in the elucida­  
tions or &lt;•&gt;:;&gt;!,.n.iti&#x27;ms proposed ! sure!c not, as lie  
knew very Itttie of them, and even if known they were  
perfectly innocent. Was it in their tendency ? that  
is impossible when their object was by his own con­  
fe ai n the /&#x27;race civil advantage of our two ceun­  
ti ics ; was it in the attempt of publishing them ? it is  
derm nutated that in such circumstances I have not  
ot.l) the right, but it was even mv duty to do it ; was  
it in the tender of the compensation ? it is evident  
there was no more indelicacy in this proceeding than  
there is in the offer or the present of a fee to a law­  
yer or to a physician ; where is then the offence  
to Mr. Jackson’s honour or to the rights of his  
country?  
If Mr. Jackson has proceeded with a culpable le­  
vity, anu affirmed under oath that lie had penetrated  
my irfatuous furfiose, when it is evident that he had  
c a m/d i It !u mistaken it, he has been not less incurre. t  
in asserting upon oath that I hud mentioned to him  
t.e ha-.n- myi.i If received u biter from Ncvv-Orlcans,  
which stated there was a letter at that place in Mr.  
Jefferson’s hand writing, which declared that if the  
settlers between the .Mississippi the Rio Perdido  
would raise the American colours they should be  
supported. No, Sir, it is not true, although given  
under oath by Mr.‘Jackson, that&#x27;I had received such  
a letter. I only told hint, in the wav of conversation,  
and not for any other purpose whatever, that there  
to re in Philadelphia one or two letters from New­  
Orleuns mentioning the above account. I never in­  
formed him I had received v,:e, as in reality this  
was not the case ; that such letter or letters, under  
the above mentioned date, have been written from  
&gt;:c\v-Orleans, is a fact known by some people in this  
city. I myself have seer, one of them, directed to a  
very respectable person in Philadelphia, and if au­  
thorized by him I would mention Ids name; but after  
the President’s declaration 1 am convinced of the  
falsehood of the assertion, and persuaded that calum­  
nies can he invented and propagated with the same  
facility in Ncw-Orlcans as they are done in Phila­  
delphia.  
This, Sir, i, the history of this transaction, ridicu­  
lously magnified by Mr. Jackson, who haspresented it  
to the publick, with as much solemnity, as if he had  
discovered the gun-powder plot or the conspiracies  
oi Fiescjue and of lSedntar ; all the heinous crime is,  
I that I wished to make u..e with decency and decorum  
[ oi the incontejiible right I possess of self defence,  
  
[ applying it to my sovereign and to my country ; the  
[ intended elucidations have since appeared in other  
papers, under the signature of Graviora Manent,  
and hv the perusal of those essays, you may easily  
judge if their contents are of a nature to bribe Mr.  
Jackson with any acknowledgment, as he declares in  
his evidence, or if there is in them to be found a  
single expression contrary to the respect due to the  
government or to this country ; the use I have made  
of the liberty of the press cannot he disputed, with­  
out attacking the constitution, as the law does not  
consider, in its-salutary restrictions, the publisher,  
but the publication ; and if this does not infringe the  
law, it would be a criminal attempt to restrain any  
person in the United States from the exercise of this  
sacred right; this is, Sir, what was intended to be  
done and has since been done by me ; my means have  
been just and legal, my object pure and benevolent,  
and can only give offence to persons, who, groan­  
ing under pique and disappiintment, establish their  
expiring hopes of retrieving their shattered fortunes,  
on the publick calamities of a war, for such persons  
the doctrine of advocating peace cannot be but high  
treaxon.  
1 would have demanded from this government the  
punishment of the said Jackson, for the offence of  
converting a mere surmise of his into the affirmation  
of a fact, and employed under his perverted idea an  
infamous and defamatory language, had I not antici­  
pated that when the particulars of this letter shall  
be known to the publick, I shall be completely avenged  
by the severity of his feelings.  
Although the vindication of my conduct exclusive­  
ly belongs to my king and government, a favourable  
opinion of the good people of America is far from  
being indifferent to to me. For the reason and for  
the degree of interest and importance that the circu­  
lation of the President’s letter has impressed upon  
this affair, 1 have thus condescended publickly to  
notice an incorrect affidavit with unjust and abomina­  
ble conclusions. With sentiments of high considera­  
tion,  
’ I have the honour to be,  
Sir,  
Your most ob’t humlie servant,  
Thk Mxitquis de Casa Yrujo.  
la met JUTadixon, Rst;.  
Washington, October 2, 1SC4.  
  
T. £. I have reserved to &#x27;.he last what Mr. Jack­  
sun has n.ist.,kei.ly introduced to imply iliat 1 had as­  
sumed a Contemptuous stvle !&gt;y refusing to term the  
administration the government.”  
On this herd I am particularly desirous of vindi­  
cating myself. as it it so foreign to my disposition,&#x27;  
In truth, during the debates of cor.gtess m L&#x27;Jg, I  
leai lit the difference between that iv&#x27;o terms, and iu  
speaking to Mr. Jackson, I mentioned the adminis­  
tration, and added, “ not to say government,” there­  
by meaning to distinguish between the administration  
and the three brandies of the legislature, which  
constitute the government. Thus this apparently  
disrespectful language evinces only the cautious pre­  
cision of a foreigner.  
So many misconstructions, if they had not been  
given upon oath, I could not have suspected of being  
accidental

&#x27; Jtamps this affair&#x27;&#x27; with a degree of

For this reason and for the respect

. In a counlry wnere the liberty of

ic gal to establish a defence by the  
press aarainst the attacks made

than I &#x27; could do it myself. Surely  
the honor of a man who is m the  
habit of retailing the space, of his pa  
per by Jinrs should not be hurt at a  
just colnpensition which was offered  
when it was questioned of occupying  
1 someCblumns of it, and Mr. Jackson  
(is less&quot; excusable in the nerversion of  
j my mekning converting u nder oatk,  
a mere surmise of his into the affir­  
j matibn,of a fact) us I repeatedly told  
uiimilSjr this is not a diplomatic  
intrii(Hl is a plain case, and if  
there ft &amp;s any thing dishonorable in it  
I would be the last man to pfopos? it,  
ana you, rvonia ee ins tan ihuu m  
noko7n it would be proposed by me.&#x27;&#x27;  
Why Mr. Jackson nas omitted in  
his amdavit thes expressions of  
.&#x27;mine, s.6 illustrative of ray meaning,  
Us better known to himself, but if he is  
a man of honor I defy him to deny  
them ; and leave to your considera­  
tion, Sir, if it had been my intention  
to persuade a person to an improper  
conduct I would have been so awk­  
ward asl to bring the sentiments of  
the most scrupulous honor before  
j his eyes ; it is then evident that Mr.  
; Jackson lias perverted the meaning  
j of the compensation offered, and  
1 this is the more ridiculous as the  
only thing which in rigour was con-J  
(tern plated by me wai ttie mechanical  
part of his onkc, that is the printing  
of ray publications ; it could be ap­  
prehended that a foreign minister  
would risque an intrigue to bribe di­  
rectly or indirectly a high officer of  
a Ci&#x27;own, depository of the secrets  
of state and director of its measures,  
but to bribe iMr. Jackson, , the Editor  
of a newspaper whose .sheets are  
scarcely t be seem across the waters  
! of the Schuylkill and the Delaware,;  
! without a place hr the Government,  
without personal influence, to bribe  
j him for the typographical publica-  
tion of ideas which were not his own,  
iby their nature perfectly harmless.  
and legal, is a conjecture only to be  
suggested by a wicked heart or a  
miserable head. I repeat that the  
only apprehended refusal of the Edi­  
tors who had espoused a side of the  
question contrary to my ideas, deter­  
mined me to call on the said V&#x27;  
Jackson; but altho&#x27; I consider hin:  
a man of some talents, he is highly  
deceived if he supposes I could mis  
1 take his pen for tae key to the tem  
ple of JiUlUS.  
Where is then what he so very  
politely is pleased to term my infa­  
mous purpose ? Is it in the elucida­  
tions or explanations proposed :  
Surely not, as he knew very little oi  
ptnem, anu even u kuu.vu were ycr-  
-1 i : r i  
icci  
tlv innocent. Was it in their ten  
dency ? that is impossible when then  
object was ,by his own confession the  
peace and advantage of our two  
governments ; was it in the attempt  
of publishing them ? it is demon­  
strated that in such circumstances  
I have not only the right, but it was  
even my duty to do it ; was it in the  
tender of tue compensation? it is  
evident there Was -no more indelicacy  
in this proceeding than there is in the  
offer or the present Qi a tee to a law  
yer or to apnysician ; where is men  
the oftence lo ivir. Jaciwon s nonor  
or to the right, of his country ?  
If Mr Jacksan has proceeded  
(with a culpable levity and-affirming  
andsr oath that he had penetrated  
my infamous purpose, when it is evi-  
clnt he had conipieUly misiak-cn it,  
he has been not less incorrect in as­  
serting upon oath that I hadtnen­  
tiont&#x27;d to him to have myself recei­  
ved a letter from New-Orleans,  
which stated there was a letter at  
that place in. Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s hand­  
writting which declared .that if the  
settlers between the Mississippi and  
the Rio Pertiido would raise the A­  
merican colours, they should be snp­  
ported. No, sir, it is not true, altho&#x27;  
given under bath by Mr. Jackson,  
that I had received such a letter. I  
only told hirh,&#x27; in the way of conversa­  
tion, avid not for any other purpose  
whatever, that there were in Phila­  
delphia one or two letters from  
NeWrOrleans, mentioning the above  
account. I never informed him 1  
had received one, as in reality this  
was not the case ;;, that such Jester  
o letters, under the above men tion

New-Orleans Is a fact known bv some

with any acknowledgment, as he de­  
clares in his evidenced -lor if there is  
in them to be found a single expres­  
sion contrary to the respect due to  
the government or to this country :  
the use I have made of the liberty of  
the press cannot be disputed without  
attacking the constitution, as the  
law docs not consider in its salutary  
restrictions, the publisher but the  
publication, and if this does not in­  
fringe the law, it would be a crimi­  
nal .attempt to restrain any person  
in the United States from the exer­  
cise of this sacred right; this is,  
Sir, what was intended to be done  
and has since been done by me&quot; :.riiy  
means have been just and legal, my  
object pure and benevolent, .and can  
only give offence to persons, who  
groaning unrlerN pique and disappoint­  
ment, establish their expiring hopes  
of retrieving their shattered fortunes  
on the public calamities of a war, fbr  
such persons the doctrine of advoca  
ting peace cannot but be high trea  
son.  
I would have demanded from this  
government the punishment of the  
said Jackson, for the offence of con­  
verting a mere surmise of his into  
the affirmation of a fact, and em  
ployed under his perverted idea art  
infamous and defamatory language,  
had I not anticipated that when the  
particulars ol this letter shall be  
known to the public, I shall be com  
pletely avenged by the severity of  
his feelings.  
Although the vindication of my  
conduct exclusively belongs to my  
King and government, a favorable  
opinion of the good people of Ameri­  
ca is far from being indifferent to rae.  
For this reason and for the degree of  
interest and importance that the cir­  
culation of the President&#x27;s letter has  
impressed into this affair, 1 have  
thus condescended publicly to notice  
un incorrect affidavit with unjust and  
abominable conclusions.  
With sentiments of high consider­  
ation, I have the honor to be,  
Sir,  
Your most o&#x27;od&#x27;t humble serv&#x27;t.  
EL MARQUIS DE CASA TRUJO  
James Madison Esq.  
Wnshbigton, (Jctjbtr  
2, 1804.  
P. S. I have reserved to the last  
vhat Mr. Jackson has mistaken  
ly&quot; introduced to imply that I had  
assumed a contemptuous style by  
refusing to term tne administration  
u the government.&quot;  
On this head I am particularly  
desirous of vindicating myself, as it  
is so foreign to my disposition In  
truth during the debates of Congress  
in 1708, I iearnt the difference be­  
tween the two terms, and in spea­  
king to Mr. Jackson, I mentioned  
the administration and added &quot; not  
to say government&quot; thereby meaning  
to distinguish &#x27;-between the admini­  
stration and the&#x27; three branches of the  
Legislature which constitute the go­  
vernment Thus this apparently dis  
respectful language evinces only the

~ HAVING been absent from Phila.  
delphia for these 18 days past and tra­  
velled far into a part of Virginia where  
1-had no opportunity to fee the late  
new{papers from the Northward, it is  
but to day on my return to Wathing­  
ton 1 have beex 43sprifed of a publica­  
tion highlr injusions to my charader,  
which unéerﬁiﬁih _of {worn evi­  
dence has/been inade by¥a certain W.  
Jacklon of Philadélphia in the paper  
of whicly he is the Editor, called the  
Political Register. -  
Had the said evidence appeared iso­  
lated, with no other weight but the.  
name of the Editor and the circum­  
stances of his deposition, I would have  
treated his malicious attack with &#x27; the  
silence of contempt as ail the fas |  
therein related even awben true would j  
not prove I had violated the laws of :  
this country nor the duties of my sta­  
tion, but a letter from the President 1  
of the United States to Jackson hav- 1  
ing been circulated along with hisev­  
idence, this circumstance alonerw:tho*  
the President does not express his o­  
pinion upon the fubje&amp; famps this af­  
fair with a degree of importance, it  
would have been otherwise divested  
&#x27;Q&#x27;f. g :  
For this reason and for the refpe@ 1 owe  
€6 the Prcfideat of the Unned States, 10 Ihis  
poveinment and 1o myfeil, 1 have thougne |  
proper i thus dddecfling you 10 enter inwo  
the explanation of this tllantaétion, ionocent  
in itfelf, confonanm with the laws of ihe  
Couatry, proper in ‘my flation 2:e! which  
canoot be disfigured cven By the asuifice of  
iufidious mdalignity. ;  
In a coimiry where the liberty of the  
prels prevails, s vie must be a shield ot de­  
fence, Bsit is aniblirument ot anack. Ihis  
is conlonant with juflice and congenial with  
the principle of c4ual vights, it isthen legal  
to cftablith a defence by \Be press againtt thie  
attacks made thicugh the medivth of Ihe  
press. This facrcd pringiple of iglf defence  
is as inherent ro political flares. 25t is 10  
individuals, and when an fence is thus  
made agaiuft’a fovercign Wwhich csarot be  
broughrinio a court of juflice it #s not only  
the right, but élfo, it is the duty ‘of the re­  
presentative of that foveregn or mnation ‘o  
repel the attatk with the faine weapots,  
which are made use of for his irjury=—  
- Were the foreign ministers to be deprived  
of this right, enjoyed by every imndividual who  
breathes the air of the United States they  
wouid be leduced 10 the fad conditich of  
difiinguifhied flawes in the very centre of the  
Jand of libesiy. For some time past some  
of the Philadelphia newipapers bad pub­  
lifbed- patagrapbs and circulated commenas  
abeut the existing differences&#x27; between the  
_king of Spain and the United Srares, mutil­  
ating faéls, alterjng circumßances and draw­  
ing falie cenclulions highly contrary. to the  
chars€ter of juflice ard genarchity so ofien  
and so Magnanimously pruved by the kiog  
my master ; 1 myfelt was poinied out as the  
author of foine letiess from Cadiz and Mad­  
sid, although 1 never knew of them bur by  
&#x27;the pewlpapeis, and wiih the fsine injustice  
an abulive paragraph agaiult Ihe President  
was finct aittibuied 1o me ; thus the publ:c  
mind was poifovedt with incorre&amp; act . i 3  
and abooxious conclulions—under such cir­  
‘cumitsnces 1 believed then, and { Jdelteve  
now, it was not only #y gkt but also my  
daty to check the torrent of impreflions a 3  
contrasy 10 trath as to the interel of my  
country. . Being very well scquainied with  
the great intluence of public opinion in a  
- popular goverunment as 15 that of the tnited  
States with a just ibtention of bringing the  
fubj~&amp;s of diicuflion tinder a forciblé poirit  
of view which had beeb carefolly toscealed;

which ,had been carefully concealed, and  
prsfenting them to the public ere under

editors who had pteviouAy ■ efpoufed a

among others would not perhaps have  
the rcluftance which I aniicipaicJ in  
the former. I requeAed him to call  
upon me and Having acceded to my re-  
qurd, after a defultory converfation  
about the news of the day, of Mr.  
Pinckney having called fer his paffports  
(my apprchenfions oftheraAi Aep) and  
the detriment which would arife from  
t war between two n.itions invited by  
their reciprocal intcreAs to the preferva-  
tion &#x27;if peace, I told him he could do  
more good to his country by advocating  
peace, than by the warlike principies,  
hr was proclaiming in his paper-— dwelt  
a while upon this topic and liiiiAied by  
bringing forw-ard the only ebiect of eur  
meeting aijd telling him that ii fodifpofed,  
1 could give to kim for publication ex-  
planations and vJucidations vliith could,  
not fail to be favorable to the cause of  
Peace, and that for his trosible lie would  
have the ccknov.’edgmcnts that nvould he  
proper; thofe were my only words u’p-  
011 this head in all the courfe ofourcoii-  
verfation ; in this offer I had in view  
but the jiiA co-npciifation which is due  
to an editor t&gt;f a nrwfpaper full of ad-  
veitilicmeiits as mr. Jackfon&#x27;s for the  
room that my intcmied effays would  
have occupied in his Gazette, or a re-  
ward for his labor if he was to ta’ite up-  
on bimfelfto couch niy ideas in a more  
rorreft language than I could do it my-  
felf- Surely the honor of a man who  
is in the habit of retailing the fpacc ol  
his paper by lines Ihould not be hurt at  
a juil tompeiil&#x27;atioii which w.is offered,  
when it was qucllioiied of occupying  
fome columns of it, and mr. Jackf.-n is  
Icfs cxcufahLc in the perverlioii cf nav  
ineaniiig (converting under oati a mere  
i&#x27;urmifc of liis into the affirmation of a  
ft) as 1 lepeatedly told him, •“ Sir,  
  
more indelicacy in this proceeding tljafi  
there is in the offer or the prefmt of a  
fee to a lav^cr or to a pliyficitn ; where  
is then the offence t&#x27;j Mr. Jackfon&#x27;s honor  
or to the rights of his country.  
  
If Mr. Jackfon has proceeded with *  
culpablelevity and affirming under oat b  
that he had penetrated my infamous-

completely mistaken it, he has been not  
lefs iiicorreft in afferting upon oati that  
I had nieiuioued to him to have myself  
received a letter from New Orloaiis,

place in Mr. Jefferfon’s hand writing  
which dedai-ed that it the fettlers between  
the Mifliffippi and the Hio Perdido  
would raife the American colours thev  
Aioiild be fupported. No, fir, it is not  
true although given under oath by  
Mr. Jackfon, that I had received fuch  
a letter. I only told him in ihe wav  
of converfation, and not for any other  
piirpofe whatever, that itere mere in  
Piiiladelphia one or two letters from  
New Orleans, mentioning the above  
.iceoiint. I never informed him I bad  
received one as in reality this was not  
the call- ; that inch letter or letters, un-  
der the above mentioned date, have bnen  
written from New Orleans is a faft  
known by fome people in the city. 1  
m,se/f have seen one of them ttrefted to  
a very refpftable perfon in Phil Typhia,
