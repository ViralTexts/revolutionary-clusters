ether the borders of Lake Ontario (especially the hither side wch is the most exposed to the boisterous Winds) are ever so frozen as to admit a passage for Slaies? What may be the difficulties of getting from Fort Schuyler to Oswego?  
Since the date of my last we have had the virtue &amp; patience of the Army put to the severest trial—Sometimes it has been 5 or Six days together without bread. at other times as many days without meat—&amp; once or twice two or three days without either—I hardly thought it possible, at one period, that we should be able to keep it together, nor could it have been done but for the exertions of the Magistrates in the several Counties of this State, on whom I was obliged to call—expose our situation to them—&amp; in plain terms declare that we were reduced to the alternative of disbanding or catering for ourselves unless the Inh[abitan]ts would afford us their aid—I allotted to each County a certn proportion of flour or grain, &amp; a certain Number of Cattle, to be delivered on certain days—&amp; for the honor of the Magistrates &amp;  
  
good disposition of the people I must add that my requisitions were punctually complied with &amp; in many Counties exceeded nothing but this great exertion could have saved the army from dissolution, or starving; as we were bereft of every hope from the Commissaries. at one time the Soldiers eat every kind of horse food but Hay.

I hope your advice to Colo.

wretched state of the republican army prevented, for a time,
