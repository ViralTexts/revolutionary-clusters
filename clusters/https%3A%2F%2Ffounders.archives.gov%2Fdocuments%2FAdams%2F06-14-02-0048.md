NORTH EASTERN BOUNDARY.  
  
On the 3d day of September, 1783, g definitive  
treaty of peace was entered into between the Uni-  
ted States and the government of England. By  
the first article of said treaty, **his Britannic Ma-  
  
jesty acknowledges the United States, consisting }  
  
then of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay,  
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Con-  
necticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,  
{elaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,  
South Carolina, and Georgia, to be free, sovereign,  
and independent States; that he treats with them  
as such, and for himself, his heirs and successors,  
relinquishes all claims to the government property  
and territorial rights of the same, and every part  
thereof.”

The claim set up by Great Britain, to the pos-  
session of the disputed territory, is frivolous and  
unjust. She insists, in the first place, that the  
north west angle of Nova Scotia is to be found at  
Mars hill, in the line drawn due north from the  
monument at the St. Croix, and 40 miles from it;  
and that the highlands mentioned in the treaty, are  
those running to the westward, and dividing the  
sources of the streams flowing north into the St.  
Johns, and south into the Penobscot.  
  
‘fo support this claim, she contends, that as the  
eastern boundary of the U. States rans ‘by a line  
to be drawn along the middle of the St. Croix,  
from its mmouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source,”  
and as the St. Johns river, not mentioned in the  
treaty, has its mouth also in the Bay of Fundy,  
| that consequently the said St. Johns is not a river  
i&#x27;which falls into the Atlantic Ocean, as mentioned  
jin the treaty. In looking for the highlands, there-  
lfore, which “divide these waters that empty them-  
selves into the St. Lawrence river, from those  
which fall into the sea,”’ they assert that you must  
look south of the St. Jchns. This brings you to  
Mars hill; and from thence westwardly along the  
kighlands, to the western boundary of the state of  
Maine, where, as they contend, you fi

Britannic Majesty acknowledges the independence of the United
