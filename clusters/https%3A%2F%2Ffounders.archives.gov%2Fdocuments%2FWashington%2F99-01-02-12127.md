To the Members of the volunteer Associations &amp; other Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Ireland who have lately arrived in the City of New York.  
Gentlemen  
  
2 December 1783  
  
  
The testimony of your satisfaction at the glorious termination of the late contest, and your indulgent opinion of my Agency in it, afford me singular pleasure &amp; merit my warmest acknowledgments.  
If the Example of the Americans successfully contending in the Cause of Freedom, can be of any use to other Nations; we shall have an additional Motive for rejoycing at so prosperous an Event.  
It was not an uninteresting consideration, to learn, that the Kingdom of Ireland, by bold &amp; manly conduct had obtained redress of many of its greivances—and it is much to be wished, that the blessings of equal Liberty &amp; unrestrained Commerce may yet  
prevail more extensively in the Mean time, you may be assured, Gentlemen, that the Hospitality &amp; Benificence of your Countrymen, to our Brethren who have been Prisoners of War, are neither unknown, or unregarded.  
The bosom of America is open to receive not only the opulent &amp; respectable Stranger, but the oppressed &amp; persecuted of all Nations &amp; Religions; whom we shall wellcome to a participation of all our rights &amp; previleges, if by decency &amp;  
propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment.
