Wednesday 21st. By promise I was to have Breakfasted at Mr. Ellsworths at Windsor on my way to Springfield, but the Morning proving very wet and the rain not ceasing till past 10 Oclock I did not set out till half after that hour; I called however on Mr. Ellsworth and stay’d there near an hour. Reached Springfield by 4 Oclock, and while dinner was getting, examined the Continental Stores at this place which I found in very good order at the buildings (on the hill above the Town) which belong to the United States. The Barracks (also public property) are going fast to destruction and in a little time will be no more without repairs. The Elaboratory, wch. seems to be a good building is in tolerable good repair and the Powder Magazine which is of Brick seems to be in excellent order and the Powder in it very dry. A Colo. Worthington, Colo. Williams (Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts), Genl. Shepherd, Mr. Lyman and many other Gentlemen sat an hour or two with me in the evening at Parson’s Tavern where I lodged and which is a good House. About 6 Miles before I came to Springfield I left the State of Connecticut and entered that of Massachusetts. The Distance from Hartford to Springfield is 28 Miles—both on Connecticut River. At the latter the River is crossed in Scows, set over with Poles and is about 80 rod wide. Between the two places is a fall and ten miles above Springfield is another fall and others above that again—notwithstanding which much use is made of the Navigation for transportation in flats of about five tonns burthen. Seven miles on this side Hartford is Windsor a tolerable pleasant but not a large Village. Between Windsor and Suffield you pass through a level, barren &amp; uncultivated plain for several Miles. Suffield stands high &amp; pleasant—the Lds. good. From hence you descend again into another plain where the Lands being good are much better cultivated. The whole Road from Hartford to Springfield is level &amp; good, except being too Sandy in places &amp; the Fields enclosed with Posts &amp; Rails generally their not being much Stone. The Crops of Corn, except on the Interval Lands on the River are more indifferent (tho’ not bad) in the Eastern than we found them in the Western part of the State of Connecticut. There is a great equality in the People of this State—Few or no oppulent Men and no poor—great similatude in their buildings—the general fashion of which is a Chimney (always of Stone or Brick) and door in the middle, with a stair case fronting the latter, running up by the side of the latter [former]—two flush Stories with a very good shew of Sash &amp; glass Windows. The size generally is from 30 to 50 feet in length and from 20 to 30 in width exclusive of a back shed which seems to be  
  
added as the family encreases. The farms by the contiguity of the Houses are small not averaging more than 100 Acres. These are worked chiefly by Oxen (which have no other feed than Hay) with a horse &amp; sometimes two before them both in Plow &amp; Cart. In their light Lands and in their sleighs they work Horses, but find them much more expensive than Oxen. Springfield is on the East side of Connecticut River; before you come to which a large branch of it called Agawam is crossed by a Bridge. It stands under the Hill on the interval Land and has only one Meeting house—28 Miles from Hartfd.

Bednesdoy, DLst.By promise I was to have Breake  
fasted at Mr. Ellsworth s at Windsor, on my way to  
Springfield, but the morning proving very wet, and the  
rain not ceasing till past 10 o&#x27;clock, I did not set out  
till half after that hour; I called, however, on Mr.  
Elleworth, and stay&#x27;d there near an hour-reached  
Spingfield by a o&#x27;elock, and while dmner was getting,  
examined the Continental Stores at this place, which I  
found in very good order at the buildings ton the hill  
above the Town) which belong to the United States.  
The Barracks, also public property, are going fast to  
destruction, and in a little time will be no more, withe  
ont repairs. The Elaboratory, whch, seems to be a  
good building, is in tolerable good repair; and the  
Powder Magarine, which is of Brick, scems to be in  
exeellent order, and the Powder in it very dry. A Col.  
Worthingion, Col. Williams, Adjutant General of the  
State of Massachusetts, Gen. Shepherd, Mr. Lyman,  
and many other Gentlemen sat an hour or two with me  
in the evening at Parson&#x27;s Tavern, where I lodged, and  
which is a good House. About 6 miles before I came  
to Springfield, I left the State of Connectient, and en-­  
tered that of Massachusetts. The Distance from Hart­  
ford te Springfteld is 2 miles--both on Connecticut  
River. At the latter the River is crossed in Scows set  
over with Poles, and is about 30 rod wide. Between  
the two places is a fall, and ten miles above Springfield  
is another fall, and others above that again-notwithe  
standing which much use is made of the navigation for  
transfortation in flats of about five tons burthen.  
Seven miles on this side Hartford is Windsor, a tolern­  
ble pleasant but not a large village. Between Windsor  
and Buffield you pass through a level, barren and un­  
cultivated plein for several miles. Safield stands high  
and pleasant--the ld. good. From hence you descend  
again into another plain, where the lands being good  
are much better cultivated. The whole Road from  
Hartford to Springfield is level and good, except being  
too sandy in nlsoss- and the Rieldsenslosed withPostt  
  
and Rails generally, there not being much stone. The  
Crops of Corn, except on the Interval Lands on the  
River, are more indifferent tho not bad, in the Eastern  
than we found them in the Western part of the State of  
Connecticut. et se  
There is a great equality in the People of this State.  
Few or no opulent men-and no poor- great similtude  
in their buildings- the general fashion of which is a  
chimney talways of stone or brick, and door in the  
middle, with a stair case fronting the latter, running up  
by the side of the latter Hformer!!- two flush stories  
with a very good show of sash and glass windows  
the size generally is from 30 to 50feet in length, and  
from 2 to 30 in width, exclusive of a backshed, which  
seems to be added as the family increases.  
The farms, by the contiguity of the Houses, are  
emall, not averaging more than 100 acres. These are  
worked chiefly by oxen twhich have no other feed  
than hayh with a horse, and sometimes two before

lent men—and no poor—great similitude in their buildings, the general fashion of which  
is a chimney (always of stone or brick) and door in the middle, with a staircase fronting the

Washington’s critical observations on this first Presidential tour through  
the country are of surpassing interest. He seems to have known how to  
use his eyes to the best advantage, and to have lost nothing worthy of note.  
He describes the average farm, how it was worked “chiefly by oxen,  
(which have no other feed than hay), with a horse and sometimes two before  
them, both in plow and cart,” and states the condition of the roads he  
passed over on each day, the style of the fences, the quality of the soil,  
and the exact number of the churches in the principal towns. He pro-  
duces a picture of New England a hundred years ago, the colors of which  
will brighten and deepen as the years roll on.

messenger was sent forward to inform the keeper of a little wayside in
