To The Senate and House of Representatives of the US.  
  
  
To a people Fellow Citizens, who sincerely desire the happiness &amp; prosperity of other nations, To those who justly calculate that their own well-being is advanced by that of the nations with which they have intercourse, it will be a satisfaction to observe, that the war, which was lighted up in Europe a little before our last meeting, has not yet extended its flames to other nations, nor been marked by the calamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war. The irregularities too on the Ocean, which generally harrass the commerce of neutral nations, have, in distant parts, disturbed ours less than on former Occasions. But, in the American seas, they have been greater from peculiar causes; &amp; even within our harbors and Jurisdiction, infringements on the authority of the Laws have been committed which have called for serious attention. The friendly conduct of the governments, from whose Officers &amp; Subjects these acts have proceeded, in other respects, and in places more under their Observation &amp; control, gives us confidence, that our Representations on this subject will have been properly regarded. § While noticing the irregularities committed on the Ocean by others, those on our own part should not be omitted, nor left unprovided for. Complaints have been receiv’d that persons residing within the US, have taken on themselves to arm Merchant vessels &amp; to force a commerce into certain ports &amp; countries in defiance of the laws of those countries. that individuals should undertake to wage private war, independantly of the authority of their country, cannot be permitted in a well orderd society. its tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations, &amp; to endanger the peace of our own, is so obvious that I doubt not you will adopt measures for restraining it effectually in future. § Soon after the passage of the act of the last session, authorising the establishment of a district &amp; port of entry on the waters of the Mobile, we learnt that its object was misunderstood on the part of Spain. candid explanations were immediately given, and assurances that, reserving our claims in that quarter as a subject of discussion and arrangement with Spain, no act was meditated in the meantime inconsistent with the peace and friendship existing between the two nations; and that conformably to these intentions would be the execution of the law. That government however had thought proper to suspend the ratification of the convention of 1802. but the explanations, which would reach them soon after, &amp; still more the confirmation of them by the tenor of the instrument establishing the port &amp; district, may reasonably be expected to replace them in the dispositions and views of the whole subject, which originally dictated the convention. § I have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been urged by that government, against the validity of our title to the country of Louisiana, have been withdrawn; its exact limits however still remaining to be settled between us. and to this is to be added, that, having prepared and deliverd the stock created in execution of the convention of paris of April 30th 1803, in consideration of the cession of that country, we have receiv’d from the government of France an acknowledgement in due form of the fulfilment of that stipulation. § With the nations of Europe, in general, our friendship &amp; intercourse are undisturbed; &amp; from the governments of the Belligerent powers especially we continue to receive those friendly manifestations, which are justly due to an honest neutrality, &amp; to such good offices consistent with that as we have opportunities of rendering;  
§ The activity and success of the small force employ’d in the Mediteranean in the early part of the present year, the reinforcement sent into that sea, &amp; the energy of the Officers having command in the several vessels, will I trust, by the sufferings of war, reduce the Barbarians of Tripoli to the desire of peace on proper terms. great injury however ensues, to ourselves as well as to others interested, from the distance to which prizes must be brought for adjudication, &amp; from the impracticability of bringing hither such as are not sea-worthy— § The Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorised by our Treaty, Their rejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent. but to those who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands will not cost us less than a war, we must leave as a question of calculation for them also whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them less than a war. we can do to each other very sensible injuries by war. But the mutual advantages of peace make that the best interest of both. § peace and intercourse with the other powers on the same coast continue on the footing on which they are establishd by Treaty.— § In pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government of Louisiana, the necessary Officers for the territory of Orleans were appointed in due time to commence the exercise of their functions on the 1st day of October. The distance however of some of them &amp; indispensible previous arrangements, may have retarded its commencement, in some of its parts. the form of government thus provided having been consider’d but as temporary, &amp; open to such future improvements as further information of the circumstances of our Brethren there might suggest, it will of course be subject to your consideration. In the district of Louisiana it has been thought best to adopt the division into subordinate Districts which had been establish’d under its former government. these, being five in number, a commanding Officer has been appointed to each, according to the provisions of the law &amp;, so soon as they can be at their stations, that district will also be in its due state of Organisation. in the mean time their places are supplied by the Officers before commanding there; &amp; the functions of the governor &amp; Judges of Indiana having commenced, the government, we presume, is proceeding in its new form. The lead mines in that territory offer so rich a supply of that metal as to merit attention. The report now communicated, will inform you of their state &amp; of the necessity of immediate enquiry into their occupation and Titles. § With the Indian tribes establishd within our newly acquired limits, I have deemed it necessary to open conferences, for the purpose of establishing a good understanding &amp; neighbourly relations between us. so far as we have yet learn’d we have reason to beleive that their dispositions are generally favorable &amp; friendly. and, with these dispositions on their part, we have in our own hands means which cannot fail us for preserving their peace &amp; friendship. by pursuing an uniform course of justice towards them, by aiding them in all the improvements which may better their condition, &amp; especially by establishing a commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them, &amp; only not losing to us, &amp; so regulated, as that no incendiaries of our own, or any other nation, may be permitted to disturb the natural effects of our just and friendly Offices, we may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort &amp; prosperity, that the protection of our Citizens from their disorderly members will become their interest &amp; their voluntary care. Instead therefore of an augmentation of military force, proportion’d to our extension of frontier, I propose a moderate enlargement of the Capital employ’d in that commerce, as a more effectual, economical, and humane instrument for preserving peace and good neighbourhood with them. § On this side the Missisipi an important relinquishment of native title has been Receiv’d from the Delawares. That Tribe, desiring to extinguish in their people the spirit of hunting, and to convert superfluous lands into the means of improving what they retain, have ceded to us all the country between the Wabash and Ohio, south of, and including the Road from the Rapids towards Vincennes; for which they are to Receive, annuities in animals and implements for agriculture &amp; in other necessaries. This acquisition is important, not only for its extent &amp; fertility, but as, fronting 300 miles on the Ohio, &amp; near half that on the Wabash, the produce of the settled country descending those Rivers, will not longer pass in review of the Indian frontier, but in a small portion; &amp;, with the cession heretofore made by the Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates our possessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectable breadth from Lake Erie to the Missisipi. The Piankishaws, having some claim to the country ceded by the Delawares, it has been thought best to quiet that by fair purchase also. so soon as the Treaties on this subject shall have Receivd their Constitutional sanctions they shall be laid before both houses. § The act of congress of Feb. 28. 1803 for building and employing a number of gun boats is now in a course of execution, to the extent there provided for. The obstacle to Naval enterprise which vessels of this construction offer for our sea port Towns, their utility towards supporting, within our waters, the authority of the Laws, the promptness with which they will be manned by the seamen &amp; militia of the place, in the moment they are wanting, the facility of their assembling from different parts of the coast, to any point where they are required in greater force than ordinary, the economy of their maintenance &amp; preservation from decay, when not in actual service, &amp; the competence of our finances to this defensive provision, without any new burthen, are considerations which will have due weight with Congress in deciding on the expediency of adding to their number, from year to year, as experience shall test their utility, until all our important harbors, by these and auxiliary means, shall be secured against insult and opposition to the Laws—. § No circumstance has arisen since your last session which calls for any augmentation of our regular Military force. should any improvement occur in the Militia system, that will be always seasonable. § Accounts of the Receipts &amp; expenditures of the last year, with estimates for the ensuing one, will, as usual, be laid before you. § The state of our Finances continues to fulfil our expectations. Eleven Millions &amp; an half, Receivd in the course of the last year ending on the 30th of September last, have enabled us, after meeting all the ordinary expences of the year, to pay 3,600,000 Dollars of the principal of the public debt. This paiment, with those of the two preceding years, has extinguished upwards of Twelve millions of principal, &amp; a greater sum of Interest, within that period; &amp;, by a proportionate diminution of Interest, renders already sensible the effect of the growing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principal. § It is also ascertain’d that the Revenue accrued during the last year exceeds that of the preceding; and the probable receipts of the ensuing year may safely be relied on as sufficient, with the sum already in the Treasury, to meet all the current demands of the year; to discharge upwards of Three millions and an half of the engagements incurred under the British &amp; French conventions, &amp; to advance, in the further redemption of the funded debt as rapidly as had been contemplated. These, Fellow Citizens, are the principal matters which I have thought it necessary, at this time, to communicate for your consideration &amp; attention. Some others will be laid before you in the course of the session. but, in the discharge of the great duties confided to you by our country, you will take a broader view of the field of Legislation. whether the great interests of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, or navigation, can, within the pale of your constitutional powers, be aided in any of their relations? whether laws are provided in all cases where they are wanting? whether those provided are exactly what they should be? whether any abuses take place in their administration, or in that of the public Revenues? whether the Organisation of the public agents, or of the public force, is perfect in all its parts? In fine whether any thing can be done to advance the general good? are questions within the limits of your functions, which will necessarily occupy your attention. In these &amp; all other matters, which you in your wisdom may propose for the good of our country, you may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation, and faithful execution—

The irregularities too on the ocean, which

ours lefsthan on former occafions. But,  
in the American feas they have been great-

in our harbours and jurifdiétion, infringes

United States, have taken on themfelves ta  
arm merchant vel{cls, and.to force a com.  
merce into cerizin ports and countries, in  
defiance of the laws of thofe countries.  
That individuels fhoa!ld undertake to wage  
private war, independenily of the authori-  
ty of their country, cannot be permitted  
ina well ordered fociety. Its tendency to  
produce aggref{lion on the laws and rights  
of other nations, and to endanger the  
peace of ovr-own, is {a obvious, that I  
doubt not you will adopt meafures for ref-  
training it effeétually in future.  
  
Soon atter the paflage of the a&amp; of the  
Jatt fefion, authorifing the eftablifhment  
of a diftri€t and port of entry on the wa-  
ters of the Mobile, we learnt that its obje&amp;  
was mifunderftood onthe part of Spain.  
Candid’ex planations were immediately giv-  
en, and affucance, that, referving our  
claims in that quarter as a fubjsét of dif  
cuffion and arrangement with Spain, no  
aft was meditated inthe mean time incon  
fitent with the peace and friendthip exift  
ing between the two nations : and that con  
formably to thefe intentions woulda be the  
execution of thelaw. That government  
had however thought proper to fufpend th  
ratification ct the convention of 1802  
But the explanations which would reach  
them foon after, and ftill more the confir-  
mation of them by the tenor of the inftru-  
ment eftablifhing the port and diftriét,  
may reafonably be expeéted to replace  
them in the difpofitions and views of the  
whole fubje&amp;t which originally di€tated  
the convention.  
  
I have the fatisfa€tion to inform you  
that the obje&amp;lions which had been urged  
by that government againft the validity of  
our title of the country of Louifiana have  
been withdrawn ; its exa&amp;t limits howev-  
er remaining ftill to be fettled between us.  
And to this is to be added that having pre-  
pared and delivered the ftock created in ex-  
ecution of the convention of Paris of April  
goth, 1803, in confideration of the cef-  
fion of that country, we have received  
from the government of France an ac-  
knowledgment in due form of the fulfil-  
ment of that ftipulation.  
  
With the nations of Europe in genera!  
our friend{hip and intercourfe are undil-  
turbed : and trom the governments of the  
belligerent powers efpecially, we continuc  
to receive thofe friendly manifeftations  
which are juflly due to an honeft neutrali  
tv, and to fuch good offices confiftent with  
that, as we have opportunities of renderirig.  
  
The a€tivity and fuccefs of the {mall  
force employed in the Mediterranean in  
the early part of the prefent year, the re-  
inforcement fent into that fea, and the en-  
ergy of the officers having command in the  
feveral veffels, will, Ltruft, by the fuf-  
Aerings of war, reduce the barbarians of  
Vripoli tothe defire of peace on proper  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
|  
  
terms. Great injury however enfues to  
ourfelves as well as to others interefled,  
from the diftance to which prizes muft be  
brougit for adjudication, and trom the im-  
  
pra€licability of bringing hither ‘fuch as.  
  
are not fea worthy.  
  
The Bey of Tunis having made requi-  
fitions unauthorifed by our treaty, their  
rejcétion has produced from him fome ex-  
preflions of difcontent. But tothofe who  
expect usto calculate whether a compli-  
ance with unjuft demands will not coft us  
lefs than a war we mult leave as a queftion  
of calculation for them alfo, whether to  
retire from. unjuft demands will not coft  
them lefs than a war. We can do to each  
other very fenfible injuries by war. But  
the mutual advantages of peace make that  
the beft intereft of both.  
  
Peace and intercourfe with other powers  
on the fame coaft continue on the tooting  
on which they are eftablifhed by treaty.  
  
In purfuance of the a€t providing for  
the temoorary government o! Louifiana, the  
neceffary officers tor the territory of Or-  
leans were appointed in due timeto com-  
mence the exercife of their funétions on  
ihe aft day of Oftober.—The diftance how-  
ever of fome of them, and indifpenfible  
previous arrangements, may have retarded  
its Commencement in fome of its parts.  
The form of government thus provided  
having been confidered but as temporary,  
and opento fuch future improvements as  
turther information of the circumftances  
of our brethren there might fuggeft, it will  
of courfe be fubje&amp;t to your confideration.  
  
In the diftriét of Louifiana it has been  
thought beft to adopt the divifioninto fub  
ordinate diftri€éts which had been eftablith  
ed under its former government. Thef  
being five in number, a conunanding of-  
ficer has been appointed to each according  
tothe provifions of the law, and fo foon  
as they can be at their ftations that diftriét  
will alfo bein its due ftate of organization.  
In the meantime their places are fupplied  
by the officers before commanding there,  
and the fun@tions of the governor aud  
judges of Indiana having commenced, the  
government, we prefume, is proceeding  
inits new form. The lead mines in that  
diftri€t offer fo rich afupply of that metal  
as to meritattention, The report now  
communicated will inform you of their  
ftate, and of the neceflity of immediate en-  
quiry into their occupation and titles.  
  
With the Indian tribes eftablifhed with-  
in our newly acquired limits, I have deem-  
ed it neceffary to open conferences, for  
the purpoie of eflablifhing a good under-  
ftanding and neighborly relations between  
us. So far as we have yet learned, we  
have reafon to believe that their difpofi-  
tions are generally favorable and triend-  
  
ly. And, with thefe difpofitions on.  
  
their part, we have »: our own hands  
  
  
  
  
  
means which cannot fail us, for preferv-  
; ingtheir peace and friendthip.  
  
By pur-  
fuing an uniform courfe of juftice to-  
wards them, by aiding them in ali the im-  
provements which may better their condi-  
tion, and efpecially by eflablifhing a com-  
merce on terms which fhall be advantage-  
oustothem, and only not lofingtous, and  
fo regulated as that no incendiaries, of our  
own, orany other nation, may be permit-  
ted to diflurb the natural effeéis of our jut  
and friendly offices, we may render our-  
felves fo neceffary to their. comfort and  
profperity, that che proteétion of our cit-  
izens from their diforderly members will  
become their intereft and their voluntary  
care. Inftead, therefore, of an augmen.  
tation of military force proportioned to our  
extention of frontier, I propcfe a moder-  
ate enlargement of the capital employed  
in that commerce asa more effeQual, eco-  
nomical and humane inftrumeut for pre-  
vt peace and good neighborhood with  
them.  
  
On this fide the Miffiflippi an impor.  
tant relinquifhment of native tile has  
been received from the Delawares. That  
tribe defiring to extinguifh in their people  
the {pirit of hunting, and to convert fue  
peifluous lands into the means of improv-  
ing what they retain, has ceded tous all  
the country between the Wabafh and O-  
hio, fouth of, and including the road from  
  
the Rapids towards Vincennes; for which  
  
they are to receive annuities in animals,  
and implements for agriculture, and in  
other neceflaries. This acquifition is im-  
portant not only for its extent and fertility,  
but as, fronting three hundred miles on  
the Ohio, and near halt that on the Wabath,  
the produce of the fettled country defcend.  
ing thofe rivers will no longer pafs in res  
view of the Indian frontier, but ina {mall  
portion ; and with the ceflion heretofore  
made by che Kafkefkias, nearly confoli-  
dates our poffeflions north of the Ohio, in  
a very refpeftable breadth from Lake E~  
rie tothe Mififfippi. The Piankefhaws  
having fome claim -tothe country ceded  
by the Delawares, it has been thought beft  
to quiet that by fair purchafe alfo. So foon  
as the treaties on thisfubjeét fhall have re-  
ceived their conftitutional fanélions, they  
fhall be laid before both houfes.

fhall tefl their utility, until all our impor-  
tant harbours, by thefe and auxiliary means  
fhall be fecured againft infult and oppofi-

No circumftance has arifen fince your  
Jaft feffion which calls for any augmenta-  
tion of our regular military force. Should  
any improvement occar in the military fyf-  
tem, that will be always feafonable.  
  
Accounts of the receipts and expendi-  
tures of the laft year, with eftimates for  
the enfuing one, will, as ufual, be laid  
before you.  
  
The ftate of our finances continues to  
fulfil ourexpe@lations. Eleven millions  
and an half of dollars, received in the  
courfe of the year, ending on the goth of  
September laft, have enabled us, after  
meéting all the ordinary expences of the  
  
year, to pay upwards of three millions fix  
  
urdred thoufand dollars of the public  
debt, exclufive of intereft. This pay-  
ment, with thofe of the two preceding  
years, has extinguifhed upwards otf twelve  
millions of principal, and a greater fum of  
intereft, within that period ; and by a pro-  
portionate diminution of intereft renders  
alweady fenfible the cffeét of the growing  
fum yearly applicable to the difcharge ot  
the principal.  
  
It is alfo afcertained that the revenue ac-  
crued during the laft year exceeds that o}  
  
the preceding ; and the probable receipts |;  
  
ot the enfuing year, may fately be relied  
on as {ufficient, with the fum already in  
the Treafury, to meet al! the current de-  
mands of the year, to difcharge upwards  
of three millions and an half of the engage-  
ments incurred under the Britifh and  
French conventions, and to advance in  
the further redemption of the funded debt  
as rapidly as had been contemplated.  
Thefe, tellow citizens, are the princi-  
pal matters ‘Which I have thought it necef-  
fary at this time to communicate for your  
confideration and attention. Some others  
will be laid before you in the courfe of the  
feffion. But inthe difcharge of the great  
duties confided to you by our country,  
you will take a broader view of the field  
of legiflation. . Whether the great interefts  
of agriculture, manufaétures, commerce

within the limits of your funétions which  
will receffarily occupy your attention. In  
thefe andall other matters, which you in

fine erely defire the happinels and prof-  
perity of other nations, to thofe who  
jultly calculate that their own well  
being is advanced by that of the nations  
with which they hate intercourie, it  
will be a fatisfaction to obferve that  
  
the war, which was lighted up in Eu-  
rope a little before our laft meeting,  
has not yet extended its flames.to othe?  
nations, nor been marked by the cal-  
amities which fometimes ftain the foot-  
fteps of war. The irregularities too on  
the ocean, which generally harafs the  
commerce of neutral nations, have, in  
diftant parts, difturbed ours lefs than on  
former occafions. But, in the Amer-  
ican feas, they have been greater from  
peculiar caufes; and even within our  
harbours and jurifdiction, infringements  
on the authority of the laws have been  
committed which have called for ferious  
attention. ‘The friendly conduct of the  
governments from whofe officers and

der their obfervation and control, gives  
us coniidence that our reprefentations  
en this fyubject will have been properly  
regarded.  
  
‘While noticing the irregularities com-  
mitted on the ocean by others, thofe on  
our own part ifhould uot be omitted,  
nor left unprovided fgr. Complaints  
have been received that perfons, refid-  
ing within the United States, have taken  
on themfelves to arm merchant veilels,  
and to force a commerce into certain  
ports and countries, in defiance of the  
laws of thofe countries. ‘That individ-  
vals fhould undertake to wage private  
war, independently of the authority of  
their country, cannot be permitted in a  
well ordered fociety. Its tendency to  
produce aggrefiion on the laws and  
tights of other nations, and to endanger  
the peace of our own, is fo obvious, that  
¥doubt not you will adopt meafures for  
rettraining it effectually im future.  
  
Soon after the pafiage of the act of  
the laft fetlion, authoriiing the eftab-  
lifhment of a diftrict and port of entry  
on the waters of the Mobile, we learnt  
that its object was mifunderfiood on the  
part of Spain. Candid explanations  
were immediately given, and aflurances,  
that, referying eux claims m that quar-  
ter as a fubject of difcuffton and ar-  
rangement with Spain, no act was med-  
itated in the mean time, inconiiftent  
with the peace and friendfhip exifting  
between the two nations; and that con-  
formetny to thefe intentions would be  
the execution of the law. That gov-  
ernment had however thought proper  
to fufpend the ratification of the con-  
vention of 1802. But the explanations  
which would reach them foon after, and  
fill more the confirmation of them b  
the tenor of the inftrument eftablifhing  
the port and diftrict, may reafonably be  
expected to replace them in the difpo-  
fitions and views of the whole fubject  
which originally dictated the convention.  
  
I have the fatisfaction fo inform you  
that the objections which had been  
urged by that government againft the  
validity of our tithe to. the country of  
Louifiana have been withdrawn; its  
exact limits however remaining full to

to be added, that, having prepared and

THE MONTHLY ANTHOLOGY.  
  
  
  
30th, 1803, in confideration of the cef.  
fion of that country, we have received  
from the government of France an ac-  
knowledgment in due form of the fulfil.  
ment of that ftipulation.  
  
With the nations of Europe, in gen-  
eral, our friendfhip and intercourle are  
undifturbed: and from the govern.  
menta of the belligerent powers elpecial-  
ly we continue to receive thofe friendl  
manifeftations which are juftly due to  
an honeft neutrality, and to fuch good  
offices confiftent with that, as we have  
opportunities of rendering.  
  
The activity and fuccefs of the fmall  
force employed in the Mediterranean,  
in the early part of the prefent year,  
the reinforcement fent into that fea,  
and the energy of the ofhicers enled  
command in the feveral veflels, will,  
I truft, by the fufferings of war, reduce  
  
the barbarians of ‘Tripoli to the defire_  
  
of peace on proper terms. Great in-  
jury however eniues to ourfelves as  
jury as to others interefted, from the  
diftance to which prizes muft be brought  
for adjudication, and from the imprach-  
cability of bringing hither fuch as are  
not fea worthy.  
  
The Bey of Tunis, having made re-  
quilitions unauthorifed by our treaty,  
their resection has produced from him  
fome expreflions of difcontent. But to  
thofe who expect us to calculate wheth-  
er a compliance with unjuft demands  
will not coft us lefs than a war, we muft  
leave as a queftion of calculation for  
them alfo, whether to retire from un-  
juft demands will not coft them lefs than  
awar. Wecean do to each other very  
fentible injuries by war. But the mu-  
tual advantages of peace make that the  
beft intereft of both.  
  
Peace and intercourfe with the other  
powers on the fame coaft continue on  
the footing on which they are eftablifh-  
ed by treaty.  
  
In purfuance of the act providing for  
the temporary government of Lonifi-  
ana, the neceflary officers for the terri-  
tory of Orleans were zppointed in due  
time to commence the exercife of their  
functions on the Ift day of Of¢tober.

open to fuch further improvements as  
further informatien of the cireumftan-  
ces of our brethren there might fuggeft,  
jit will of courfe be fubject to your  
conideration.  
  
In the diftriét of Louifiana, it has been  
thought beft to adopt the divifion into  
fjubordinate diftricts, which had been  
eftabliihed under its former govern-  
ment. Thefe bemg five in number, a  
commanding officer has been appoimted  
to each, according to the provifions of  
the law, and fo foon as they can be at  
their [tations, that diftrict wiil alfo be  
ja its due ftate of organization. In the  
mean time their places are fupplied by  
the officers before commanding there,  
and the functions of the governour and  
judges of Indiana having commrenced,  
the government, we prefume, is pro-  
ceeding in Ms new form. ‘The lead  
mines in that diftrict offer fo rich a fup-  
ply of that metal as to merit attention.  
‘The report now communicated will in-  
form you of their ftate, and of the ne-  
ceility of immediate inquiry into their  
occupation and tittes.  
  
With the Indian tribes, eftablifhed  
within our newly acquired limits, I have  
deemed it neceflary to open conferences  
for the purpofe of eftablithing a good  
underftanding, and neighbourly rela-  
tions between us. So far as we have  
yet learned, we have reafon to believe  
that their difpofitions are generally  
iavourable and friendly, And, with  
thefe difpofitions on them part, we have  
in our own hands means which cannot  
fail us, for preferving their peace and  
‘riendihip. By purluing an uniform  
courfe of juftice towards them, by aid-  
ing them in all the improvements which  
may better their condition,and efpecial-  
iy by eftablithing a commerce on  
terms which fhall be advantageous to  
them, and only net lofing to us, and fo  
segulated as that no mcendiaries of our  
own, or any other nations, may be per-  
uted to difturb the natural effects of  
our juft and friendly offices, we may  
Teuder ourtelves fo neceflary to their  
comfort and profperity, that the pro-  
tection of our citizens from their difor-  
serly members wilt become their in-  
tereft and their voluntary care. In-  
cad therefore of an augmentation of

enlargement of the capital employed ia  
that commerce, as a more effectual,  
economical, and humane inftrursent for  
preferving peace and good neighbom  
hood with them.  
  
On this fide the Miffifippi an impor.  
tant relinquifhment of native title has  
been received from the Delawares,  
‘That tribe, defiring to extingwih in  
their people the {pirit of hunting, end  
to convert fuperfluous lands into the  
means of improving what thev retain,  
has ceded to us all the country be«  
tween the Wabafh and Ohio, fouth af,  
and mcluding the road from the Rapits  
towards Vincennes: for which they are  
to receive annuities in animals and ime  
plements for agriculture and in other  
neceflaries. This acquilition is impor-  
tant not only for its extent and fertility,  
but as fronting three hundred miles oa  
the Ohio, and near half that on the Wa-  
bath, the produce of the fettled coun-  
try defcending thofe rivers will no loa-  
ger pafs in review of the Indian fron.

the ceffion heretofore made by the Kai-

quiet that by fair purchafe alfo. Sa  
foon as the treaties on this fubject thail  
have received their conftitutional fane-

lothe Senate and House of Representatives of  
the United Stales.  
TO a people, fellow citizens, who sincerely  
desire the happiness and prosperity of other na­  
tions, to those who justly calculate that their own  
W( 11 feeing is advanced by that of the nations with  
which they have intercourse, it will be a satisfac­  
tion to observe that the war Which was lighted up  
in 1 \urope a little before our last meeting, has not  
yet extended its flames to other nations, nor been  
marked by the calamities which sometimes stain  
the footsteps of war. The irregularities too on the  
ocean, which generally harrass the commerce of  
neutral nations&#x27;, have, in distant parts, disturbed  
ours less than on former occasions. But, in the  
American seas, thi y have been greater from pecu­  
liar causes ; and even within our harbours and ju­  
risdiction, infringements on the authority of the  
laws have been committed which ha c called for  
Serious attention. The friendly conduct of the  
governments from whose officers and subjects these  
acls have proceeded, in other respects, and in  
places more under their observation and control,  
gives us confidence that our representations on this  
subject will have been properly regarded.  
While noticingthe irregularities committed on the  
ocean by othei s, those on our own part should not be  
omitted, nor left unprovided for. Complaints have  
&#x27;befeii received that persons, residing within the  
United States, have taken on themselves to arm  
merchant vessels, and to force a commerce into  
certain ports and countries, in defiance of the laws  
of those countries. That individuals should un­  
dertake to wage private war, independently of the  
authority of their country, cannot be permitted in  
a well ordered society. Its tendency to produce  
aggression on the laws and rights of other nations,  
and to endanger the peace of our own, is so obvi­  
ous, that I doubt not you will adopt measures for  
restraining it effectually in future.  
Soon after the passage of the act of the last  
session, authorising the establishment of a district  
and port of entry on the waters of the Mobile, we  
learnt that its object was misunderstood on the  
part of Spain. Candid explanations were immedi­  
ately given, and assurances, that, reserving our  
churns in that quarter as a subject of discussion  
and arrangement with Spain, no act was meditated  
in the mean time inconsistent with the peace and  
friendship existing between the two nations : and  
that conformably to these intentions would be the  
execution of the law. That government had how­  
ever thought proper to suspend the ratification of  
the convention of 1802. But the explanations  
which would reach them soon alter, and still more  
the confirmation of them by the tenor of the insiru­  
&#x27; merit establishing the port and district, may rea­  
sonably be expected to replace them in the dispo­  
sitions and views of the whole subject which ori­  
ginally dictated the convention.  
I have the satis.action to inform you that the ob­  
jections which had been urged by that government  
against the validity of our title to the country of  
Louisiana have been withdrawn : its exact limits  
however remaining still to be settled between us.  
And to this is to bc&#x27;added that having prepared and  
delivered the stock created in execution of the  
convention of Paris of April 30th, 1803, in consi­  
deration of the cession of that country, we have  
received from the government of France an ac­  
knowledgement in due form of the fulfilment of that  
stipulation.  
With the nations of Europe in general our  
friendship and intercourse are undisturbed : and  
from the governments of the belligerent powers  
we continue to receive those friendly  
manifestations which are justly due to an honest  
neutrality, and to such good offices consistent with  
that, as we have opportunities oi rendering.  
  
The activity and success of the small force em­  
ployed in the Mediterranean in the early part of  
the present year, the reinforcements sent into that  
sea, and the energy of the officers having  
command in the several vessels, will, I mist,  
by the sufferings of war» reduce the barba­  
rians of Tripoli to the desire of peace on proper  
terms. Great injury however ensues to ourselves  
as well as to others interested, from the distance  
to which prizes must be brought for adjudication,  
and from the impracticability of bringing hither  
such as are not sea-worthy.  
The Bey of Tunis having made requisitions un­  
authorised by our treaty, their rejection has pro­  
duced from him some expressions of discontent.  
But to those who expect us to calculate who*her a  
compliance with unjust demands nil! not cost us  
less than a war, we must leave as a. question of  
calculation for them also, whether to retire from  
unjust demands wil! not cost them lessihan a war.  
We can do to each other very sensible injuries by  
war. But the mutual advantages of peace make  
that the best interest of both.  
Peace and intercourse with the other powers on  
the same coast continue on the footing on which  
they are established by treaty.  
In pursuance of the act providing for the tempo­  
rary government of Louisiana, the necessary offi­  
cers for the territory of Orleans were appointed in  
due time to commence the exercise of their func­  
tions on the Ist day of October. The distance  
however of some of them, aud indispensible pre­  
vious arrangements, may have retarded its com­  
mencement in some of its parts. The form of go­  
vernment thus provided having been considered  
but as temporary, and open to such future im­  
provements as further information of the circum­  
stances of our brethren there might suggest, it  
will of course be subject to your eonsiderati on.  
In the district of Louisiana it has been thought  
best to adopt the division into subordinate distr icis  
Which had been established under its former go­  
vernment. These being five in number, a com­  
manding officer has been appointed to each, accord­  
ing to the provisions of the law, and so soon as they  
can be at their stations that district will also be in  
its due state of organization. In the me-jsn time  
their places are supplied by the officers before com­  
manding there, end the funclions of the governor  
and judges of Indiana having commenced, the go­  
vernment, we presume, is proceeding in its new  
form. The lead mines in that district ofi&#x27;er so rich  
a supply of that metal as to merit attention. The  
report now communicated will inform you of their  
state, and of the necessity of immediate enquiry  
into their occupation and titles.  
With the Indian tribes established within our  
newly acquired limits, 1 have deemed it necessary  
to open conferences for the purpose of establish­  
ing a good understanding and neighbourly rela­  
tions between us. So far as we have yet learned,  
we have reason to believe that their dispositions  
are generally favorable aud friendly. And, with  
these dispositions on their part1, we have in our  
own hands means which cannot fad us, for pre­  
serving their peace and friendship. By pursuing  
an uniform course of justice towards them, by  
aiding them in all the improvements which may  
better their condition, and especially by establish­  
ing a commerce on terms which shall be advanta­  
geous to them, and only not losing to us, and so  
\dated as that no incendiaries*, of cur own, or  
any other nation,, may be permitted to disturb the  
natural effee\s of our just ami friendly offices, we  
may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort  
and prosperity, that the protection of our citizens  
from their disorderly members will become their  
interest and their voluntary care. Instead th  
fore of an augmentation of military force proporti­  
oned to our extension of frontier, I propose a  
moderate enlargement of the capital employed iv  
that commerce as a more eficcUial. economical and  
humane instrument for preserving peace and good  
neighbourhood with them.  
On this side the Mississippi an important re­  
linquishment of native title-has been received from  
the Delawares. That tribe, desiring to extinguish  
in their people the spirit of hunting,- and to con­  
\ I superfluous lands into the means of improving  
what they retain, has ceded to us all the country  
between the Wabash and Ohio, south of, and in­  
cluding the road from the Rapids towards Vm­  
cennes ; for which they are to receive annuities in  
animals and implements for agriculture, and in  
other necessaries. This acquisition is important  
not only for its extent and U rtilrty, but as, fronting  
  
three hundred miles bn the Ohio.  
that on the Wabash, the produce of the settled  
countrj idihg those- rivers will no long  
pass in review of the Indian frontier, but in  
po lion) and, with the cession-hereto  
by the Kaskaskias, nearly con  
sessions north of the Ohio; in a v. i*, .  
breadth from Lake Erie to the Miss he  
Fiankcshaws having some claim to the eon  
ceded by the Delawares, it has been thought best  
to quiet that by fair purchase also. So soon as i  
treaties on tins subject sh I their  
Constitutional sanctions, they shall be laid ber  
both houses.  
Tiie act of Congress of February 23, i 803, for  
building and employing a number of gun boats, is.  
now in a course of execution to the extent the  
provided for. The obstacle to h  
which vessels of this construction oner for our  
port towns, their utility towards supporting wj  
iti our Waters the authority of the laws, the prompt­  
■*ieL thy will be manned ! •  
men aud militia oi the place iri the m&lt;  
are wanting, the fadilityof their assembling ft  
different parts of thecoast to any point where they  
are required in greater force than ordinary, the eco­  
nomy of their maintenance and atidn from  
deca* when hot in actual and the con;  
tence of our finances t;* this defensive provis  
without any new burthen, are considerations which,  
will have due weight with Congress in deciding .  
the expediency oi adding to their number from year  
to year, a, experience shall test their utility, until  
all our important harbors, by these and auxiliary  
means, shall be secured against insult and opposi­  
tion to the laws.  
No circumstance has arisen since your last ses­  
sion which calls for any augmentation of our regular  
military force. Should any improvement occur in  
the militia system, that will be always seasonable.  
Accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the  
last, year, wilh estimates for tilt tig one will,  
as usual, be laid before you.  
The state of our finances continues to fulfil o  
expectations. Eleven mllh%ns and an half of dol­  
lars, received in the course of the year ending onS  
the 30th of September last, have enabled us, after  
meeting all the ordinary expences of the year, to  
pay upwards of three millions six hundred thou­  
sand dollars of the public debt, exclusive of inter­  
est. This payment, with those of the two preced­  
ing years, has extinguished upwards of twelve mil­  
lions of principal, and a greater stun of interest,,  
within that period ; and, by a proportionate dimi­  
nution of interest, renders already sensible the ef­  
fect of the growing sum yearly applicable to the  
discharge of principal.  
It is also ascertained that the revenue accrued  
during the last year exceeds that of the preceding ;  
and the probable receipts of the ensuing year, ri  
safely be relied on as sufficient, with the sum alrea­  
dy in the Treasury, to meet ail the current eie­  
mands of the year, *o discharge&#x27; upwards of three  
millions and an half of the engagements incurred  
under the British aud French conventions, and to  
advance in the further redemption of the funded  
debt as rapidly as had been coniemplat&lt;  
These, fellow citizens, are the principal mat­  
ters which I have thought it necessary at this time  
to communicate for your consideration and atten­  
tion. Some others will be laid before you in the  
course of the session. But in the discharge of the  
great duties confided to you by our country, you  
will take a broader viewr of the field of legislation.  
Whether the&#x27;grcat interests of agriculture, manu­  
factures, commerce or navigation, can, within the  
pale of your constitutional powers, be aided in atny  
of their relations ? Whether laws are provided in  
all eases where they are wanting ? Whether those  
provided arc exactly what they should be . Whe­  
ther any abuses take place in their d&#x27;n up; strati on­  
or in that of the public revenues  
organization of the public agents, or ol the pub.  
lie force is perfect in all its parts ? In fine, whether  
any thing can be done to advance the gen  
good ?—are questions Within tiie limits of your  
functions, which will necessarily occupy your at­  
tention. In these and all Other matters*, uh eh  
you in your wisdom may propose for the goeK  
our country, you may count with assurance on my&quot;  
hearty co-operation and faithful execution.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the  
United States.  
To a people, fellow-citizens, who sincerely desire  
the happiness and prosperity of other nations, to  
these who justly calculate that their own well being  
is advanced by that of the nations with which they  
have intercourse, it will be a satisfaction to observe  
that the war which was iighted up in Europe a little  
before our last meeting, has not yet extended its  
flames to other nations, nor been marked by the ca­  
lamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war.  
The irregularities too on the ocean, which generally  
harrass the commerce of neutral nations, lim e, in  
dintant parts, disturbed ours less than on for­  
mer occasions. Rut, in the Ameiican seas, they have  
been greater from peculiar causes ; and even with­  
in our harbours and jurisdiction infringements on  
the authority of the laws have been committed which  
have called for serious attention. The friendly con­  
duct of the governments from whose officers and  
subjects these acts have proceeded, in other respects,  
and in places more under tlrcir observation and con­  
trnul, gives us confidence that our representations  
on this subject will have been properly regarded.  
While noticing the irregularities committed on  
/vnoon Ki- nfKprto tVinos* nn nnr own nnrt vlmnM ■  
  
not be omitted, nor left unprovided for. Complaints  
have been received that persons, residing within the  
United States, have taken onr themselves to arm  
merchant vessels, and to force a commerce into cer­  
tain ports and countries, in defiance of the laws of  
those countries. That individuals should undertake  
to wage private war, independently of the authority  
of their country, cannot be permitted in a well or­  
dered society. Its tendency to produce aggression  
on the laws and rights of other nations, and to en­  
danger the peace of our own, is so obvious, that I  
doubt not you will adopt measures for restraining it  
effectually in future.  
Soon after the passage of the act of the last seessi­  
on, authorising the establishment of a district and  
port of entry on the waters of the Mobile, we learnt  
that its object was misunderstood on the part of  
Spain. Candid explanations were immediately  
given, and assurances, that, reserving our claims in  
that quarter as a subject of discussion and arrange­  
ment with Spain, no act was meditated in the mean  
time inconsistent with the peace and friendship ex­  
isting between the two nations : and that conforma­  
bly to these intentions would lie the execution of the  
law. That government had however thought pro­  
per to suspend the ratification of the convention of  
180V. But tlie explanations which would reach  
them soon after, and still more the confirmation of  
them by thetenour of the instrument establishing the  
port and district, may reasonably be expected to re­  
place them in the dispositions and views of the  
whole subjecf’which originally dictated the conven­  
tion.  
I have the satisfaction to inform you that the ob­  
jections which had been urged by that government  
  
against the validity of our title to the country of Lou i­  
siana have been withdrawn : its exact limits howe.  
ver remain still to be settled between us.- And to  
this is to be added that having prepared and delivt-r­  
ed the stock created in execution of the convention  
of Paris of April 30th, 1803, in consideration of the  
cession of that country, we have received from the  
government of France an acknowledgment in due  
form of the fulfilment of that stipulation.  
With the nations of Europe in general our friend­  
ship and intercourse are undisturbed : and from the  
governments of the belligerent powers especially, we  
continue to receive those friendly manifestations  
which are justly due to an honest neutrality, and to  
such good offices consistent with that, as we have op­  
portunities of rendering.  
The activity and success of the small force employ­  
ed in the Mediterranean in the early part of the pre­  
sent year, the reinforccmunts sent into that sea, and  
the energy of the officers hav ing command in the se­  
veral vessels, will, I trust, by the sufferings of war,  
reduce the barbaviansof Tripoli to the desire of peace  
on proper terms. Great injury however ensues to  
ourselves as well as to otiiers interested, from the  
distance to whicli prizes must be brought for adjudi­  
cation, and from the impracticability of bringing hi­  
ther such as are not sea-worthy. &#x27;  
The Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unau­  
thorized by our treaty, their rejection has produced  
from him some expressioons of discontent. But to  
those who expect us to calculate whether a compli­  
ance with unjust demands will not cost us less than a  
war, we must leave as a question of calculation for  
them also, whether to retire from unjust demands  
will not cost them less than a war. We can do to  
each other very sensible injuries by war ; but the  
mutual advantages of peace make that the best inte­  
rest of hnth.  
  
Peace and intercourse with the other powers on  
the same coast continue on the footing on which they  
are establish&#x27;d by treaty.  
In pursuance of the act providing for the tempora­  
ry government of Louisiana, the necessary officers  
for the territory of Orleans were appointed in due time  
to commence the exercise of their functions on the  
1st day ol October. The distance however of some  
of them, and indispensable previ ms arrangements,  
may have retarded its commencement in some of its  
parts. The form of government thus provided hav­  
ing been considered but as temporary, and open to  
such future improvements as further information of  
the circumstances of our brethren there might sug­  
gc.t, it will of course be subject to your considera­  
tion.  
In the district of Louisiana it lias been thought best  
to adopt the division into subordinate districts which  
had been established under its former government.  
These being five in number, a commanding officer  
lias I icon appointed to each, according to the provisi­  
ons ot the law, and as soon as they can he at their  
stations that district will also he in its due state of or­  
ganization. In the mean time their places arc sup­  
plied by the officers before commanding there, and  
the functions of the governour and judges of Indiana  
having commenced, the government, we presume,  
is proceeding in its new form, The lead mines in  
that district offer so rich a supply of that metal as to  
merit attention. The report now communicated will  
, inform you of their slate, and of the necessity of im­  
mediate enquiry into their occupation and titles.  
With the Indian tribes established within our new­  
ly acquired limits, I have deemed it necessary to  
open conferences for the purpose of establishing a  
good understanding and neighbourly relation be­  
tween us. So far as we have yet learned, we have  
reason to believe that their dispositions are general­  
ly favourable and friendly. And, with these dispo­  
sitions on their part, w e have in our own hands means  
which cannot fail us, for preserving their peace and  
friendship. By pursuing an uniform course of jus­  
tice towards them, by aiding them in all tiie improve­  
ments which may better their condition, and especi­  
ally bv establishing a commerce on terms which shall  
be advantageous to them, and only not losing to us,  
and so regulated as that no incendiaries, of our own,  
or any other nation, may be permitted to disturb the  
natural effects of our just and friendly offices, we may  
render ourselves so necessary to their comfort and  
prosperity, that the protection of our citizens from  
their disorderly members will become their interest  
and their voluntary care. Instead therefore of an  
augmentation of military force proportioned to our  
extention of frontier, I propose a moderate enlarge­  
ment of the capital einploi ed in that commerce as a  
more effectual, economical, and humane instrument  
for preserving peace aud good neighbourhood with  
  
On this side the Mississippi an important relin­  
quishment of native title has been received from the  
Delawares. That tribe, desiring to extinguish in  
their people the spirit of hunting, and to convert su­  
perfluous lands into the means of improving what  
they retain, has ceded to us all the country between  
the Wabash and Ohio, south of, and including, the  
road from the Rapids towards Vincennes ; for which  
they arc to receive annuities^ in animals and imple­  
ments for agriculture, and in other necessaries.  
This acquisition is important not only for Its extent  
and fertility, but as, fronting three hundred miles  
on the Ohio, and near half that on the Wabash, the  
produce of the settled country descending those rivers  
will no longer pass in review of the Indian frontier,  
but in a small portion ; and, with the cession hereto­  
fore made by tho Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates our  
possessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectable  
breadth from Lake Erie to the Mississippi. The  
Piankesliaws having some claim to the country ceded  
by the Delawares, it has been thought best to quiet  
that by fair purchase also. So soon as the treaties  
on tliis subject shall have received their constitution­  
al sanctions, they shall be laid before both houses.  
The act; uf Congress of February 28, 1803, for  
building and employing a number of gun-boats, is  
now in a course of execution to the extent there pro­  
vided for. The obstacle to naval enterprise which  
  
\ essels of this construction offer for our sea port  
towns, their utility towards supporting withinour wa­  
ters the authority ofthelaves,the promptnes with which  
tliey will he manned by the seamen and militia of the  
place in the moment tliey are wanting, the facility  
of their assembling from different parts of the coast  
fo any point where they are required in greater  
force than ordinary, the economy of their mainten­  
ance and preservation from decay when notin actual  
service, and the competence of our finances to this  
defensive provision without any new burthen, are  
considerations which will have due weight with Con­  
gress in deciding on the expediency of addingtotheir j  
number from year to year, as experience shall test  
their utility, until all our important harbours, by  
these and auxiliary means, shall be secured against  
insult and opposition to the laws.  
No circumstance has arisen since your last ses­  
sion which calls for any augmentation of our regular  
military force. Shoo&#x27;d any improvement occur in  
the militia system, that wiil he always seasonable.  
Accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the  
last year, with estimates for the ensuing one will, as  
usual, be laid before yon.

lociety. Its tendency to produce aggn fiion on  
the laws and rights of other nations, and to en­

I doubt pot you will adopt meafurcs for retrain­

presentations on this subject will have

Wilde noticing the irregularities com­  
mitted on the ocean by others,those on our

unprovided for. Complaints have been

rights oi other nations, and to cndiuvrer  
the peace of our own, L soobvinu,, th.-.t I  
doubt not you will adopt measures for re­  
straining it etVeSlimUv in future.  
Soon alter the passage of the a61 of the  
last session, authorising the establishment  
oi a district and port of entry on the wa­  
ters of v e Mobile, we learnt that its ob­  
ject was misunderstood on the pa&#x27;t of  
Spain. Candid explana&#x27;ions were imme­  
diately given, and assura ices,tha:, res-irv­  
ing our claims in ihat quarter us a subject  
ol discussion and arrangement with Suain,  
no act was meditate#! in ike mean time  
inconsistent with the peace and friendship  
existing between the two na&#x27;iona : and  
th-t conformably to these intentions wo.’d  
be tiie execution of the law. That go­  
vernmer.t had however thought proper iu  
suspend the ra’uhcatiun ol the convention  
oi 13JJ. II.* the explanations which  
would reach them soon after, and mill  
mme tiie confirmation of them by the te­  
nor ol the instrument establishing th,. port  
an &gt; flistri 1, may reasonably he cxpe.ted  
to-replace them in tii-j dispositions and  
views of the whole subjo i which original­  
ly dictated the convention.  
I have tlie da &#x27;lion to inforin you  
that the objection w.iicn had l;ecn urged  
bv that government against the validity  
ol our title to the country of Louisiana  
have been withdrawn: its ex i -l {&#x27;units  
however remaining still to be settled be­  
tween us. And to this is to be added that  
having prepared and delivered the stock  
created in exec iti-m of the convention cf  
Paris, of April 30th, IS03, in considera­  
tion of the cession of that country, we  
Hive received from the government of  
hranee an acknowledgment indue form  
of the fu.filment of that stipulation.  
ilk (he nations ol lsurope in general  
our friendship r.n I intercourse are undis­  
turheri: and from the governments of  
the belligerent po*wers illy we con  
tinue n. receive those friend.y iiian&#x27;T-s a.i­  
ons which are justly due to an honest neu­  
ii&#x27;ality, and to sue.i g *od offices consis  
:&#x27; - wt|h that, as we liave opportunities

The activity and success of the small  
Torce employed in the Mediterranean in  
t.V. early nut of the present year, the re  
inforcemsnts sent into that sen, and tlie  
cretgy o! ihe officers having command in  
tl.&lt;- -.ever*! vessels, will, I trust, by the  
suTr rings of wat, reduce the burharians  
of 1 ri o!i to the desire of peace on pro­  
per terms, (,rca: injury however ensues  
to ouro Ives as well &#x27;is to others interest­

f»&lt; m the impracticability 0f bunging hi­  
ther such as are not sea-wort by.  
Tlj*i Hi y ol J unis hav ng nvv!e Cc­  
rjuis&#x27; .ions unauthorised by our treaty, their  
i v j -ction has produced from him some  
expressions of discontent. But to those  
&#x27;vIk&gt; cxpcffl us t&lt;» calculate whether a com­  
pliance * it!i unjust demands will not cost  
us less titan a war, we must leave as a  
question of calculation for them a!*o,  
whether to relire from unjust demands will  
not cost them le;,s titan a war. YVe can  
do to each other very sensible injuries by  
war. But the mutual advantages of peace  
make that the best interest of both*  
Peace and intercouse with the other  
powers on the same coast continue on the  
for,ting on which they arc established by  
treaty.  
n pursuance of the ml providing for  
t.ic &#x27;emporary government of l&lt;oiti*inna,  
&#x27;lie necessary officers for the territory ol  
Orleans were &lt;q pointed ir&gt; due time to

on the I st day r,f Oftober. The distance  
Iriwcrer ol some of them, and indispen­

To the Senate nd House of Representatives  
or the United States,  
To a people, fellow-citizens, who  
kiticerelv desire the happiness and  
prosperity of other nations, to those  
who justly calculate mat their own  
weil being is advanced by that oft he  
nations with which they have inter­  
course, it will be a satisfaction to  
observe that the. war vrhich was  
lighted up in Europe, a little before  
our last meeting,&#x27;, has not yet ex­  
tended its flames to other nations,  
nor been marked by, the calamities  
which&#x27; sometimes stain the footsteps  
of war. The ifregukirities too n  
the ocean, which generally harrass  
the commerce of neutral nations,  
have, in distant parts, disturbed  
ours les3 than on former occasions.  
But, In the American seas thy  
have been greater front peculiar  
! cainee ; and even within bar har-  
hniiTi stYtA inrisrVirti rm lnfrina--l  
v a. urn j w w -  
ment3 on the authority of- the laws  
have been committed which have  
called for serious attention. The  
friendly conduct of the govern­  
ments from .whose o-iiceix and sub  
jecls these aCwS have proceeded, in  
other respects, and in places more  
under their observation and con-  
troul, gives us conhderxe that our  
representations on this subject will1  
have, been properly regarded.  
While noticing the irregularities  
committed on the ocean by others.  
those on our own nan should not be i  
ilomittvd, nor left unprovided for.  
.  
Cornp&#x27;a.nts have been received that  
persons residing within the Unil  
States, have taken on themselves  
to arm merchant vessels, and to  
force&#x27; a commerce into certain ports  
and cc tntries, in defiance of the  
laws of those countries. That in­  
dividuals should undertake to vage  
private war, independently of the  
altlionty of their country, cannot  
be permitted in a well ordered . so-j  
ciety. Its tendency to produce ag-  
g) esfion on the laws and rights of  
other nations, and to endanger the j  
peace ot our own, is  
so covictis,

Soon after the passage of the act :  
of the. last session, autho-rising the  
estal lishment of a district and port  
of entry on the waters of the Mo­

In the district of Louisiana ithas  
been thought best to adept the di­  
vision into subordinate districts  
which had been established-under  
its former government. r; These be­  
ing five in number, ,a commanding  
officer has been ap&#x27;poln&amp;i to eaca,&#x27;  
according to the provUions o the  
lav, and sb soon as they can be at  
tiir stations that district will also  
bet in&#x27; its due state of organization.  
In the mean timetheirplaces aresup

governor and judges, of Indiana  
having commenced, the govern­  
m c nt, we presume, is. proceeding  
in its new form. The lead mines  
in that district offer so&#x27; rich a sup­  
ply of that metal as to merit atten-  
cated will inform you of their state,  
and of the necessity of immediate  
enquiry into their occupation and  
titles. . ,:

ed vithin our newly acquired li­  
mits, I have deemed it necessary  
to open conferences for the purpose  
of establising a good understanding  
and neighbourly relations between  
tis. So far as we have yet learned,  
we have reason to believe that their  
disposijUQns are generally favorable  
and frienSly. And, with these  
dispositions on their part we have  
in our own hands means which  
cannot fail us, for preserving their  
peace and friendship. By pursuing  
an uniform course of justice to­  
wards them, by aiding them in ail  
the : improvements which may bet­

by establishing a commerce en

selves so necessary to their com­  
fort and prosperity, that the pro­  
tection of our citizens from their  
disorderly, members will becorrie

care. Instead therefore of an aug­  
mentation of military force propor­

The Piankeshaws haying some

best to &#x27;quiet&#x27; that by fair purchase  
also. So soon as the treaties on  
this subject shall have received  
their constitutional sanctions, they  
shall be laid before both houses.  
The act of Congress of February  
28, 1803, for building and em  
ploying a number of gun-boats,  
is now in a course of execution to  
the extent there provided for. The  
obstacle to naval enterprise which  
vessels of this construction offer  
for our sea port towns, their utility  
towards supporting within our wa­  
ters the authority of the laws, the  
promptness with which they Aviil be  
manned by the seamen and militia  
of the place in the moment they are  
wanting, the facility of their assem­  
bling from diffeient parts of the  
coast to any point where they are  
required in greater force than ordi­  
nary, the economy of their main­  
tenance and preservation frefm de­  
cay when not in actual service, and  
the competence of our finances to  
this, defensive provision without  
any new burtheu, are considera­  
tions which will have due weight  
ongress in deciding on the  
expediency of adding to their num­  
ber from year to year, as experience  
shall test their utility, until all our  
important harbors,- by these and  
auxiliary &#x27;means; shall be secured  
against insplt and opposition to the  
laws.  
&quot;No circumstance has, arisen since  
your last session which calls for any  
augmentation of our regular mili­  
tary force. Should any improve­  
ment occur in the militia system,  
that will be always seasonable.  
Accounts of the receipts and ex­  
penditures of the last year, with  
estimates for the ensuing one will,  
as usual, be laid before you.  
The state of our finances conti­  
nues&#x27; -to. fulfil our expectations.  
Eleven millions, and an half of dol­  
lars, received in the course of the  
year ending on the 30th of Septem­  
ber last, have enabled, us, after  
meeting all the ordinary expences  
of the year, to pay upyards of three  
millions six hundred thousand dol­  
lars of the public debt, exclusive  
ot interest. This payment, with  
those of the two preceding years,  
has extinguished upwards of twelve  
millions of principal, and a greater  
sum of interest, within that perfoif ;  
and,. by a proportionate diminution  
of interest renders already sensible  
the effect of tbe growing sum vearlv  
applicable to the discharge of prin  
cipal.  
It is also ascertained that the re­  
venue accrued during the last year  
exceeds that of the preceding ; and  
the probable receipts of the ensu  
ing year, may sately be relied on  
as sufficient, with the sum already  
in the 1 reasury, to meet all the  
current demands of the rear, to  
; discharge upwards of three mil­  
lions an half of the engagements  
&quot;jcurred under the British and  
French conventions, and to ad­  
vance in the further redemption of  
the funded debt as rapidly as had  
been contemplated.  
These, fellow-citizens, are the  
principal matters , which I have  
thought it necessary at this time to  
communicate for your considera­  
tion and attention.&#x27; Some others  
&quot;... iWlll be laid before ycu in the course  
of the session. But in the discharge  
of the great duties confided to you  
by- our country, you will take a  
jbroader view of the field of legisla­  
tion. Whether the great interests  
f agriculture, manufactures, com­

With the Indian tribes established -within  
our&quot; newly acquired limits, - I haveleemod it  
necessary to open conferences for the pur­  
pose of establishing a good understanding  
r.nd neighborly reiniions betver:i ufc. So far

sitionSou their pat t, v , have in our own hands

H&#x27;.niform course of justice towards tlwm, by j  
  
tiding them in all the improvements which f  
may better the condition, and &#x27;e&#x27;sptt&#x27;ally by J  
establishing a commerce on terms which t  
shall be advantageous , to them, and only not  
  
losing to us, and so regulated as thut no in­  
cendiiries, of our own, or any other nation,  
may be permitted to disturb the &quot;natural cf;­  
focts of our just and friemlly offices., we may  
render ourselves so necessary to their com­  
fort and prosperity, that the &#x27;.protection cf  
our citizens from their disordcrly members  
will becometheir interest arid their voluntary 1  
care. Instead therefore of an &#x27;augmentation  
of mi&#x27;rUrywToree proportioned to oar exten­  
sion &#x27;of frontier, &#x27; I projjose &#x27;a moderate en­  
largement of the-capital employed &quot;iir that  
commerce as a more effectual, economical  
and humane instrument for preserving peace  
anLj;ood neighborhood with them.  
On Ibis side -of the MUsispi an impor­  
tant relinquishment of nat;(c title hr.s been  
received from the Dclawares. That tribe,  
  
desiring to extinguish in their people the spi­  
rit of hunting, and lo convert superfluous  
lands into the mehs ol improving what they  
retain, has ceded to us all the country be­  
tween the Wabash and Ohio,-south of, and  
including&#x27; tne road from &#x27;the rapids to  
wardsVinoennes; for which they are to receive  
annuilicsin animals J Implement for agi icvl-

sition is important not only for its extent and  
fertility, but, us, froivting 3K) mile on the () ,

“The friendly condu&amp; of the govern­

tations on this fubje&amp; will have been  
- properly regarded. ]  
~ While noticing the irregularities  
committed en the oceau by ‘others,  
~thofe on qur part should not be omit­  
“ted, nor left unprovided for. Com­  
plaibts have been received that per­  
fonms residing within the.Uniled States,  
{ have taken on themf{elves to arm mer­  
chant veflels; and to force a com­

triesy in deflance of the laws of those  
~countries, « That individuals should  
undertake to wage private vrar; inde-  
P pendentiy of the authority of ‘their  
xountry, cannot be permitted in a well  
ordered society. ‘lts tendency to pro­  
duce agg??ﬁon’ on the laws and rights  
of other nations, and 1o endanger the  
peace of our own, is so obvious, that  
I doubt not you will adopt measures  
forreftraining it effe@ually in future,  
- ‘Soon after the passage of the a&amp; of  
| the last session, authorifing the eltab­  
lifhment of a diftri and port of en­  
‘ try on the waters of the Mobile, we  
learnt that its obje@ was misunder­  
stood on the part of Spain. Candid  
explanation were immediately given,  
~and assurances, that, reserving our  
claims in that quarter as a fubje@ of  
~difcuflion and - arrangement with  
Spain, no a&amp; was meditated in the’  
mean time inconfiltent with the peace  
and friendfhip existing - between the  
two nations = and that conformably to  
| these inteations would be the ‘execu­  
tion of the law. That government  
- had however thought proper to fuf­  
&#x27; pend the ratification of the ¢onvention  
- of 1802. But the explanations which  
| would reach thém soon after; and 81l  
more the confirmation of them by the  
tenor of the instrument cfablithing  
the port and diltri®, may reasonably  
be expefted to replace themh in the  
dispositions and views of thé whole  
fubjeé@ which originally di¢tated the  
i convention. : &#x27; ;  
  
I have the fatisfaction to inform yoi  
thatthe obje&amp;ions which had been urg­  
ed by that govercment against the  
validity of our title to the country of  
Louisiana have been withdrawn ; its  
exadt limits however remaining still to  
be fettled between us. And to this  
is to be added that having prepared  
and delivered the flock created in ex­  
ecution of the convention of Paris of  
April 30th, 1803, in consideration of  
the ceflion of that country, we have  
received from the government of  
France an acknowledgment in due  
form of the fulfilment of that flipula­  
tion. LAY s - ,  
‘With the:nations of Europein gen­  
eral our friendfhip and intercourse are  
undiflirbed : and from the govern­  
ments of the belligerent powers espe­  
cially, we continue to receive those  
friendly manifellations which arejuft­  
ly due to an honelt neutrality and to  
such good cflices conliftent with that,  
as we haveopportunities of rendering.  
The a&amp;iyity and success of the  
imall force employed in the&#x27; Mediter­  
ranean: in the early part of the ptefent  
year, the reinforcement sent into that  
sea, and the energy of the officers  
having command. i the several ves­  
sels, will, I tiuft, by the fufferings of  
war, reduce the barbarians of Tripo­  
li tothe desire of ;peace cn proper  
terms. Great injury however ensues  
to owrlelves as well as to others inter­  
elted, from the distance to which pri­  
zes must be brought for adjudication,  
and from the impra&amp;ieability of bring­  
ing hither, such as ere not sea-worthy.  
  
~The-Bey of Tiiis having made re­  
quisitions ynautharifed by our treaty,  
their rejeétion has:produced from him  
some expreflions of discontent. But  
tothofe who expe¢t usto calculate whe­  
ther acompliance with unjust demands  
willnot cost uslefsthan awar,we must  
leave as a question of calcnlation for  
them also, whether to retrieve from  
unjult demands will not colt them less  
than a war. We can do toeach other  
very sensible injuries by war. But  
the mutual advantages of peace make  
that the belt interest of both. SRR  
Peace and intetcourfe with the other  
powers on the fame coaft’ continue on  
the footing on which they are eftab­  
lifthed by treaty. L IR  
In.purfuance , the a&amp; providing  
for the temporary government of  
Louisiana, the necessary officers for the  
territory of. Orleans were appointed  
in due time to comipence the exercise  
of their funétions on the firft day of  
O&amp;ober. The distance however of  
some .of them; and indifpenfible pre.  
vious drrangements, may have retard­  
ed its commencement in some of &#x27;its .

improvements as further information  
of the circumstances of our brethren  
there might fugge®t, it will of course  
be fubjed to your consideration.  
In the diftri&amp; of Louisiana it has  
been thought best to adopt the division  
into subordinate districts whick had  
“been eftablithed under its former gov­  
ernment. &#x27;Thefe being . five in num­  
ber, a commanding officer has been  
appointed to each, according to the  
provisions of the law, and {o fuon as  
‘they can be at their RRations that di­  
{iri¢t will also be in-its dune state of or­  
ganization. Inthe mean time their  
places are supplied by the officers be­  
fore commanding there, and the func­  
tions of the Governor and judges of  
Indiana having commenced, the Gov­  
ernment, we prefuine; is proceeding  
irrits new form, The lead mines in  
that diftri&amp;t offer so richa supply of  
that metal asto merit attention. The  
report now communicated wili inform  
you of their state, and of the neceflity  
of immediate enquiry into their occu.

‘With the Indian tribes established  
within our newly acquired limits, I  
have deemed it necessary to open con­  
ferences for the purpose of establishing  
a good understanding, andnéighbour­  
&quot;ly relations between us. So far as  
-we have yet learned we have reason  
to-believe that their dispositions are  
generally favorable and friendly.—  
And, with these difpoftions gn their  
part, we have in our own hands  
means which cannot fail us, for pre­  
serving their peace and friendfhip, by  
pursuing an uniform coprfe of justice  
towards them, by aiding them in all  
the improvements which may better

for the ensuing one will, as ufval, Le  
laid before you.  
&quot; The slate of our finances continves  
to fulfill our expe&amp;ations- Eieven  
millions and an half of dollars receiv­  
ed in the course of the year ending  
on the 3oth of September lail, have  
enabled us, after meeting all the or­  
dinary expences of the year, to pay  
upwards of three millions fix hundred  
thousand dollars of the public debt,  
exclusive of interest. This payment,  
with those of thetwopreceeding years,  
has extinguished upwards of twelve  
millicns rs principal, and a greater  
sum of interest, within that period ;  
and, by a proportionate diminution of  
interest renders zlready sensible the  
effe&amp; of the growing sum yearly ap­  
plicable to the discharge of principal.  
It is also ascertained that the rev­  
epue accrued during the last vear ex.  
cceds that of the preceeding&#x27;; and the  
probable receptions of the ensuing  
year, may fafely be relied on as fufi­  
\cient, with . the sum already in the  
‘Treafury, to meetall the current de­  
mands of the [year, to discharge up­  
wards of three millions and an half of  
the engagements incurred under the  
‘Pritith and French conventions, and  
to advance in the further redemption  
of the funded debt as rapidly as had  
been contemplated.  
These, TFellow-Citizens, are the  
principalmatters which Thave thought  
it necessary at this time to communi­  
cate for your coufideration and atten­  
tion. Some others will be laid be­  
fore you in the course of the feflion.  
‘But in the discharge of the great du­  
ties confided to you by our country,  
you will take a broader view of the  
field of legislation. Whether the great  
interelts of agriculture, manufa&amp;tures,  
commerce or navigation, can, within  
the pale of your constitutional powers,  
be aided in any of their relations ?—  
Whether laws are provided in all cases  
where” they are wanting ? Whether  
those provided are exaély what they  
should be ? Whether any abuses take  
place in their adminiftzation or in that  
of the public revenues 2 Whether the  
brganization of the public agents, or  
of the publig force is perfe&amp; in all its  
parts&lt; in fine, whether any thing can  
be done to advance the general good ?  
are questions within the limits of your  
funéions, which will neceflarily occu-  
Py Your ‘attention. In these and all  
other matters, which you in your wis­  
dom may propose for the good of cur

T the Senate and Houfe of Reprejenia­  
tives of the United Staics.  
O a people, fellow citizens, who  
T fincerely defire the happinels &amp;  
prolperity of other nations, to thofe  
who juftly calculate that their own  
weil being is advanced by that of the  
nations with which thev have inter­  
courfe, it will bz a fatis‘aétion to ob.  
ferve that the war which was lighted  
up in Europe a little before our laft  
meeting, has not vet extended s  
flames to other nations, nor been  
marked by the calamiries which fome.  
times {tain the footiteps of war. The  
irregularities too on the ocean, which  
penerally harrals the commerce of  
neutral nations, have, in diftant parts,  
difturbed ours lefs than on former oc­  
calions. But, in the American feas,  
they have been greater from peculiar  
caufes ; and even within our harbors  
and jurifdiction, infringements on the  
authority of the laws have been cem.-  
mitted which have called for ferious  
attention. The friendly condu&amp;t of  
the governments from whole officers  
and fubjecls thefe acts have proceeded,  
e other refpeéts, and in places more  
under their obfervation and control,  
gives us confidence that our reprelen­  
tations on this fubject will have been  
properly regarded.  
While noticing the irrecularities  
committed on the ocean by others,  
thofe on our own part fhould nor be  
omitted, nor left unprovided for.  
Complaints have been rececived that  
perfons, refiding within the United  
States, have taken on themlclves to  
arm merchant veflels, and to force a  
commerce into certain ports and coun­  
tries, in defiance to the laws of thole  
countries. That individuals fhould  
undertake to wage private war, inde­  
pendently of the authority of their  
country, cannot be permitted in a well  
ordered fociety. Its tendency to pro­  
duce aggreflion on the laws and rights  
of other nations, and to endanger the  
peace of our own, is fo obvious, that [  
doubt not you will adopt meafures for  
reftraining it effectually in future.  
Soon after the paflage of the al  
  
the lalt feflion, anihorifing the ef­  
tablilhment of a diftrict and port of  
entry on the waters of the Mobile, we  
learnt that its obje&amp; was mifunder­  
flood on the part of Spain. Candid  
explanations were immediately given,  
&amp; affurances that referving our claims  
in that quarter as a fubjct% of dilcuf­  
fion and arrangement with Spain, no  
alt was meditated in the mean time  
inconfiftent with the peace and friend­  
fhip exiting between the two nations :  
And that conformably to thefe inten­  
tions would be the execution of the  
law. That guvernment had however  
tho’t proper to !ufpend the ratification  
of the Convention of 1802. But the  
explanations which would reach them  
foon after, and (till more the confirm­  
ation of themn by the tenor of the in.  
firument eitabiithing the port and &amp;y  
trilt, may realonably be expelted to  
  
replace them in the difpofitions and  
views of the whole fubje@ which orig­  
inally dictated the Convention.,  
  
I have the fatisfa&amp;tion to inform  
you that the objeftions which had  
been urged by that government again(t  
the validity of.our title to the coun.  
try of Louifiana have been withdrawn?  
its exacl limits however remaining unr}  
to be ferrled between us. And to  
this is to be added that baving prepar.  
ed and delivered the ftock created in  
execution of the Convention of Paris  
of April 3oth, 1803, in confideration  
of the cefion of that country, we  
have reccived from the government of  
France an acknowledgement in due  
form of the fulfilment of that ftipula­  
on.  
  
3,500,00 C  
  
With the nations of Furope in gen­  
eral our friendfhip and intercourfe are  
undifturbed ; and from the govern.  
ments of the belligerent powers el­  
pecially, we continue to receive thofe  
friendly manifetations which are juft­  
ly due to an Lionelt neutrality, and to  
fach good offices confiftent with thar,  
as we have opportunities of rendering.  
The activity &amp; fuccels of the fmall  
force employed in the Mediterrancan  
m tae early part of the prefent year,  
the reinforcements fent into that fea,  
and the energy of the officers having  
command in the feveral veffels, will, |  
trult, by the fufferings of war, reduce  
the Barbarians of Tripoli to the defire  
of peace on proper terms. Great in­  
jury however enfues to ourfelves as  
well as to orhers interefted, from the  
diftance to which prizes malt be bro&#x27;t  
for adjudication, and from the im.  
practicability of bringing. hither fuch  
as are not fea-worthy.  
The By of Tunis having made  
requifitions unauthorifed by our trea­  
ty, their rejection has produced from  
him fome expreflions of dilcontent,  
But to thofe who expet us to calcu­  
late whether a compliance with unjult  
demands will not colt wus lefs than a  
war, we mult leave as a quefltion of  
calculation for them alfo, whether to  
irctire fron unjult demands will not  
colt them lefs than a war. We can  
‘do to each other very fenfible injuries  
? by war. But the mutual advantages  
of peace make thr . the beft interelt of  
F beth.  
~ Peace and intercourfe with the  
other powers on the fame coat con­  
tinue oa the footing on which they are  
eftablifhed by treaty.  
In purfuance of the a&amp;t providing  
for the temporary government of  
Louifiana, the neceffary officers for the  
territory of Orleans were appointed in  
due time to commence the exerciie of  
their functions on the 1t dayof Oe­  
tober. The diftance however of fome  
of them, and indifpenfable previoug  
arrangements, mav have retarded its  
commencement in fome of its parts.  
‘The form.of government thus provid.  
ed having been confidered but as tem­  
porary, and open to fuch future im­  
provements as Furthcr information of  
the circamftances of our brethren  
there might fuggell,it will of courfle be  
fubjeét to your confideration.  
In the diltrict of Louifiana it has  
been thought beft to adopt the divifion  
into fubordinateidiltrits which had  
been eftablithed under its former gov­  
ernment. Thefe bcir;g five in num­  
’ber, a commanding officer has been  
‘appointed to each, according to the  
provifions of the law, and fo foon as  
they can be at their ftations, thur dif­  
trict will alfo be in its due ftate of or­  
‘ganization. In the mean time their pla­  
ces are fupplicd by the officers before  
commanding there ; and the funitions  
of the Governor and Judges of India­  
na having commenced, the govern.  
‘ment, we prefume, is proceeding in its  
new form. The lead mines in tﬁat dil­  
trict offer fo rich a fupply of that metal  
as to merit attention. &#x27;lyhe report now  
communicated will inform you of their  
m. and of the necefiity o{ immediate  
enquiry into their occupation &amp; titles.  
&#x27; With the Indian tribes eftablifhed  
within our newly acquired limits, 1  
have deemed it necefliry to open con­  
ferences for the purpofe of eltablifhing  
a f::d underitanding and neighbaorly­  
relations between us. So far as we  
  
CURTIUS,  
  
have yet learned, we have reafon to  
believe that their difpofitions are gen­  
erally favorable and friendly. And,  
with thefe difpofitions on their part,  
we have in our own hands means  
which cannot fail us, tor preferving  
their peace and friendthip. By pur­  
fuing an uniform courfe of jultice to­  
words them, by aiding them in all the  
improvements which may better their  
condition, and efpecially by eftablifh-  
Mg a commerce on terms which fhall  
be advantageous to them, and only  
not lofing to us, and fo regulated as  
that no ine: Idiaries, of our own, or  
any other nation, may be permitted to  
difturb the natural effects of our jult  
and friendly offices, we may render  
ourfclves fo neceflary to their comfort  
and profperity, that the protetion of  
our citizens from their diforderly  
members, will become their intereft  
and their voluntary care.——lnftead,  
therefore, of an augmentation of mili­  
tary force, proportioned to our exten­  
fion of frontier, I propofe a moderate  
enlargement of the capital employed  
in that commerce, as a more effectual,  
cconomical, and humane inftrument  
tor preferving peace and good neigh­  
borhood with them.  
  
On Ithis fide the Miflifippi an im­  
portant relinquithment of native title  
has been received from the Delawares.  
That tribe, defiring to extinguifh in  
their people the fpirit of hunting, and  
to convert fuperfiuous lands into the  
means of improving what they retain,  
has ceded to us all the country between  
the Wabalh and Ohio, fouth of, and  
including the road from the Rapids  
towards Vincennes ; for which they  
are to receiv= annuities in animals and  
implements for agriculture, and in oth­  
er neceflaries, This acquifition is im­  
portant, not only for its extent and  
tertility, but as fronting three hundred  
miles on the Ohio, and near half that  
on the Wabafh, the produce of the  
fettled country deicending thofe riv­  
ers will no longer pafs in review of the  
Indian frontier, but in a fmall por­  
tion ; and, with the ceflion heretofore  
made by the Kakatkias, nearly confo!-  
idates our pofiefions north of the  
Ohio, in a very relpectable breadth  
from Lake Erie to the Mififippi, ———  
T&#x27;he Piankethaws having fome claim  
to the country ceded by the Delawares,  
it has been thought beft to quiet that  
by frir purchale alfo. So foon as the  
treaties on this fubject {hall have re­  
cetved their conflitutional fanctions,  
they fhall be laid betore both Houfes.  
Theatt of Congrefs of Feb. 28,  
1803, for building and employing a  
number of gun-boat:, is now ina  
courfe of execution to the extent there  
provided for. The obflacle to naval  
enterprize which veflels of this con­  
{truction offer for our fea port towns,  
their urility towards fupporting within  
our waters the authority of the laws,  
the promptnefs with which they will  
be manned by the feamen and militia  
of the place in the moment they are  
wanting, the facility of their affem­  
bling from different parts of the coalt  
to any point where they are required  
in greater force than ordinary, the  
cconomy of their maintenance and  
prefervation from decay when not in  
aftal [ervice, and the competence of  
our tinances to this defenfive provifion  
without any new burthen, are confide­  
rations wzich will have due weight  
with Congrels indeciding on the ex­  
ediency of adding to tieir number  
from year to year, as experience fhall  
tell their utility, until all our impor­  
tant barbors, by thefe and auxiliary  
means, fhall be fecured againft infult  
and oppofition to the laws,  
  
No circumftance has arifen fince  
your laflt feflion which calls ftor any  
augmentation of our regular military  
force. Should an[y improvement oc­  
cur in the militia fyftem, that will be  
always feafonable.  
Accounts of the receipts and ex­  
penditures ol the lalt year, with efti­  
mates for the enfuing one will,as ufu­  
al, be laid before you.  
‘The (tate of our finances continues  
to fulil our expeltations. Eleven  
millions and an halt of dollars, receiv­  
ed in the courfe of the year ending on  
  
the 3oth of September laft, have ena­  
bled us, after meeting all the ordinary  
expences of the year, to pay upwards  
of three mildions fix hundred thoufand  
dollars of the public debt, exclufive of  
intereft. This payment with thofe of  
the two preceding years, has extin­  
guithed upwards of twelve millons of  
principal, and a greatet fum of in­  
terelt within that period, and by a pro-.  
portionate diminution of intereft ren­  
ders already fenfible the effc@ of the  
growing fum yearly applicable to the  
difcharge of principal.  
It is alfo afcertained that the rev.  
enue accrued during the laft year ex­  
ceeds that of the preceding; and the  
probable receipts of the enfuing year,  
may fafely be relied on as fufficient,  
with the fum already in the treafury,  
to meet all the current demands of the  
year, to dilcharge upwards of three  
willions and an half of the engage­  
‘ments incurred under the Britith and  
French Conventicns, &amp; to advance in  
the further redemption of the funded  
debt as rapidly as had been contem.  
plated. - 5  
CThefe, fellow eitizens, are the  
principal matters whieh 1 have tho&#x27;t  
it necellary at this time to communi­  
cate for your confideration and atten­  
tion. Some others will be laid before  
you in the courfe of the feflion. But  
in the dilcharge of the, great duties  
confided to youby our country, you  
will take a broader view of the field  
of legitlation. Whether the great in­  
terelts of agriculture, manutatures,  
commerde or navigation, can, within  
the pale of your Conllitutional pow­  
ers, be aided, in any of their relations ?  
Whetherlaws are providedin all cafes  
where thiey are wanting ? Whether  
thofe provided are exactly what they  
fhould be? Whether any abufes take  
place in their adminiltration or in that  
of the public revenues ? Whether the  
organizaiion cf the public agents or  
of the public force is perfettin all its  
parts? In fine, whether any thing can  
be done to advance the general good ?  
—are queftions within the limits of  
your funéiions, which will neceffarily  
‘occupy your attention. In thefe and °  
all other matters, which you in your  
wifdom may propole for the good of  
our counfry, yon may count with af­  
furance on my hearty co-operation  
and faithful execution.

Ts the Senate and Ifoue&#x27;e »f Represents­  
five* tf the United State*.  
rl &#x27; O a people, feHow citizen* who  
1 sincerely desire the happiness and  
prosperity of other nations, to those who  
justly calculate that their own well be­  
ing is advanced by that of the nations  
with which they have intercourse, it  
will be a satisfaction‘to observe the  
war which was lighted up in Europe, a  
little before our last meeting, has not yet  
extended its flames to other nations, nor  
been marked by the calamities which  
sometimes stain the footsteps of war.  
The irregularities too on the ocean  
which generally harrass the commerce  
of neutral nations, have, in distant parts  
disturbed ours less than on former oc­  
casions. But in the American seas,  
they have been greater from peculiar  
causes; and even within our harbours  
and jurisdiction tnfnngments on the  
authority of the laws have been ^com­  
mitted which have called for serious  
attention. The friendly conduct of the  
governments from whose olicers and  
subjects these acts have proceeded, in  
other respects, and in places more un­  
der their observation and control, gives  
us confidence that our representations  
on this subject will have been properly  
regarded.  
While noticing the irregularities com­  
mitted on the ocean by others, those on  
our part should not be admitted or left  
unprovided for. Complaints have been  
received that persons residing within  
the United States, have taken on them- i  
selves to arm merchant vessels and to  
force a commerce into certain pom and  
countries, in defiance of the laws of  
those countries.——That indiyiduab  
should undertake to wage private war,  
independently of the authority of their  
country, cannot be permitted in a well ,  
ordered society. Its tendency to pro­  
duct aggression on the bars and rights  
of other nations, ami to endanger the  
peace of our own is so obvious, that I  
doubt not you wiH adopt measures for  
the restraining it effectually in future.  
Soon after the passage of the act of  
the last session, authorising the esta­  
blishment of a district and port of en­  
try on die waters of the MobUe, we  
Learnt that its object was misunderstood  
on the part of Spain. Candid explana­  
tions were immediately given, and as­  
surances, that reserving our claims in  
that quarter as a subject of discussion,  
and arrangement with Spain, too act was &#x27;  
meditated in the mean time inconsistent i  
with the peace and friendship existing  
between the two nations; and that con­  
formably to these intentions would be 1  
the e xecution of the law. That govern- |  
n»«ut however hatl thought proper to ,  
suspend the ratification of the conven­  
tion ot 1802. But the explanations which j  
would reach them soon after, and still  
more the confirmation of them by the  
tennor of the instrument tktahliahiug the  
port and district may reasonably be ex­  
pected to rrplace them in the dispositi­  
ons and views of the whole subject  
which originally dictated the conven­  
tion.  
I have the satisfaction to inform you,  
that the objectinna which had besn ur­  
ged by. that government against the va­  
lidity of our tide to die country of Loui­  
siana have been withdrawn, its exact  
limits however remaining still lobe set­  
tled between us.—And to this is to be  
added that having prepared and delive­  
red the stock created in execution of the  
convention of Paris of April 30th, 1803  
in consideration of the session of that  
country, we here received from the  
government of France an acknowledg­  
ment in due form of the fulfilment of  
that stipulation. 1  
With the nations of Europe in Gene­  
ral our friendship and intercourse arc  
uadisturbed; sadtrussthe governments  
  
of the belligerent power* especially, we  
continue to receive those friendly mani­  
festations which are justly due to is  
honest neutrality and to such good offi­  
ces consistent with that, as wc have op­  
portunities of rendering.  
The activity and success of the small  
force employed ia the Mediterranean,  
in the early part of the present year, tho  
reinforcements sent into that tea, and  
the energy of the officers having eom­  
mand in the several vessels trill I trust  
by the sufferings of war, reduce the bar­  
barians of Tripoli to the desire of pcaen  
on proper terms-—Great injury howe­  
ver ensues to ourselves as well as to  
those interested, from the distance to  
which prises must be bro*t for adjudi­  
cation, and from the impracticability of  
bringing-hither such an aro not sea-wor­  
thy.  
The Bey of Tunis having made re­  
quisitions unauthorised by our treaty,  
their rejection has produced from him  
some eanresaioos of discontent. But to  
those who expect us to calculate whe­  
ther a compliance with unjust demands  
will net cost us less than a war, we must  
leave as a question of calculation for  
them also whether to retire from uqjust  
demands will not cost them less than a  
war. We can do to each other very  
sensible injuries by  
tual  
best  
advantages of peace  
interest of both.  
But the mu­  
make that the  
Peace and intercourse with other pow­  
ers on the same coast continue on the  
footing on which they ere established  
by tresty. T - V  
In pursuance of the act providing for  
die temporary government of Louisi­  
•iaaa, the accessary officers for the ter­  
ritory of Orleans were appointed in due  
time to commence the,&#x27;exercise of their  
functions en the 1st day of October.—  
The distance however-of some of them,  
and indispensible previous arrangements  
may have retarded ifu commencement  
insotne-of its parts. The form of govern­  
ment thus provided -haveing been con­  
sidered but as temporary, and open to  
such future improvements as further in­  
formation of the circumstances of our  
brethren there might suggest, h will of  
course be snhject to your consideration.  
In the district of Louisiana it has  
been drought beat to adopt the division  
into subordinate districts which had been  
esublishtd under its former-government.  
These being five in number, a com­  
manding officer has bees appointed to  
each, according to the provisions of tho  
law, and so soon as they can he at their  
stations, that district will also be in its  
due state ml organisation. In dm mean  
time, their places are supplied by tho  
officers before commanding there, and  
the functions of (he governor and jud­  
ges of Indiana having commenced, dm  
government, we presume, is proceeding  
ia its new form. The lead tnities in that  
district offer so rich asuppty of that mo­  
tal, as to merit attention. The report  
now communicated&#x27; win inform you of  
their state, and of the necessity of im­  
mediate enquiry huo thetr occupation  
  
With the Indian tribe* established  
within our newiv acquired limit*, I here  
deemed it necessary to open confcrren­  
ce* forthe purpose of establishing a good  
understanding and neighbourly relations  
between os. So far a* wehsve yet lear­  
ned, we have reason to believe that their  
dispositions are generally favourable and  
friendly. And, with these dispositions  
on their part, we have in our hand*  
means which cannot fail us, for preser­  
ving the hr peace and friendship. By  
pursuing an uniform course of justice  
towards them, by aiding them in alltha  
improvements which may better their  
condition, and especially by establishing  
a commerce ah terms which shall be ad­  
vantageous to them, and only not loo­  
ting to us, and so regulated as that no  
incendiaries, of ottr own, or any other  
nation, may be permitted to disturb the  
natural i fleets of our just and friendly  
oScee, we may render ourselves so ne­  
cessary to their comfort and prosperity,  
that the protection of our citideos from  
their disorderly members rill become  
their interest and their voluntary care.  
Instead, therefore, of an augmentation,  
of military force proportioned ta nor ex­  
tension of frontier, I propose a mode­  
rate enlargement of the capital employ­  
ed in that commerce as a more effectual,

preserving peace and good neighbour  
nood with them.  
On this aide the Mississippi an im­  
portant relinauiahmeOt of* native tide  
has been received from the Delawares.  
That tribe, desiring to extinguish in  
their people die spirit of hunting, and to  
convert superfluous lands into the means  
of improving what they retain, has en­  
ded to us ait the country between the  
Wabash and Ohio, south of, sad inclu­  
ding the road from the rapids towards  
Vincennes; for which they ore to re­  
ceive annuities in animals and imple­  
ments for agriculture, and in other ne­  
cessaries. This acquisiton is important,  
not onlj for its extent and fertility, but  
as fronting three hundred miles on the  
Ohio,and near half that no the Wabash,  
the produce of the &#x27;settled country de­  
scending those rivers will no longer pass  
in review of the Indian frontier, but hi  
a small portion; and, with the cession  
heretofore made by the Kssksskiss,  
nearly consolidates our possessions north  
of the Ohio, in n very respectable  
breadth from Lake Erie to the Missis­  
sippi. The Piankaahaws having some  
claim to the country ceded by die Dela­  
wares, it has been thought best to quiet  
that by lair purchase also. So soon as  
die treaties on this subject shall have re­  
ceived their constitutional sanctions,  
they shall be laid before both houses.  
The act of Congress of February  
St, ISOS, for building and employing n  
number of gun-boats, is now ina course  
of execution to the extent there provi­  
ded for. The obstacle to naval enter­  
prise which vessels of this construction  
offer for our sea-port tbwns, their util­  
lity towards supporting within our wa­  
ters the authority of the laws, the  
promptness with which they be  
manned by the seamen and militia of live  
place in the moment they are wanting,  
the facility of their assembling from dif­  
ferent parts of the coast to anv point  
Where they are required in greater force  
than ordinary, the economy of their  
maintainance and preservation .from de­  
cay when not in actual service, and the  
competence of our finances to this defen­  
sive provision without any new bur­  
then, are considerations which will have  
due weight with Conn-ess in deciding  
on the expediency of adding to their  
number from year to year, as experi­  
ence shall test their utility, until all our  
important harbours, by these and aux­  
iliary means, shall be secured against  
insult and opposition to the laws.  
No circumstance has arisen since  
your last session which calls for any  
augmentation of our regular military  
force. Should any improvement occur  
in the militia system, that will always  
be seasonable.  
Accounts of the receipts and expen­  
ditures of the last year, with estimates  
for the ensuing one, will, as usual, be  
laid lie lore you.

Jb the Senate and Houfe of Reprefentativts  
of the United States.  
TO a people, fellow citizens, who fincrrely  
defire the happinefs and profperity of other na­  
tions ; to thofe who juflly calculate that their  
own well being is advanced by that of the nations  
with which they have intercourse, it will be a  
fatisfrdlion to obferve that the war, which wa*  
lighted up in Eurore a little before our lad  
meeting, has trot yet extended its f! imes to other  
nations, nor been marked by the calamities  
which fometimes dain the foot heps of war.—  
The irregularities too on the ocean, which ge­  
nerally harrafs the commerce of neutral nations,  
have, in diltant parts, didurbed ours h f* th in  
on former occafions. But, in the American  
feas, they have been greater from peculiar cauf­  
es ; and even within our harbour* and jtirifdic­  
tion, infringements on the authority of the laws  
have been committed which hn^e called for fu­  
rious attention. The friemyy conduct of 1 he gov­  
ernment* whofe cfficers&amp;&#x27;uhjefts »hefe adds have  
proceeded, in other relpccts, and in places more  
under tluir obfirvafivn and control, gives us  
confidence that our reprefentations on this fub­  
jedt will have been properly regarded.  
While noticing the irregularities «?ommitted  
on the ocean by ethers, thofe on our own part  
fhould not be omitted, nor left unprovided tor.  
c omplaints have b eu received that perfons re­  
ading within th« United States, have taken on  
themfelves to arm merchant veltels, $nd to force  
in defiance of the laws of thofe countries,  
  
a commerce into certain ports ana countries.—  
That individuals fhould undertake to wage pri­  
vate war, independently of the authority of their  
country, cannot be permitted in a well ordered  
lociety. Its tendency to produce aggrdllon on  
.he laws and rights of other nations, and to en­  
danger the peace of our own, is fo obvious, that  
l doubt not you will adopt meafures for retrain­  
ing it eftit&amp;ually in future.  
•Soon after the pafliige of the a£fc of the lad  
leflion, authorifing the eftablift.ment of a dif­  
triift and port of entry on the waters of the  
Mobile, we learnt that its object was mifunder­  
it. od on the part of Spain. Candid explana  
tions were immediately given, and aflurances,  
that, referving our claims in ti a. quarter as a  
a fubject of difeuflion and arrangement with  
Spain, no aft was meditated in the meantime  
inconfiftent with the peace and fricndfhip exit­  
ing between the two nations .• and that con­  
tormably to thefe intentions would be the exe­  
cution of the law. That government had how­  
ever thought proper to fuipend the ratification  
of the convention of i 802. Hut the explana­  
tions which would reach them foon after, and  
till more the confirmation of them by the te­  
nor of the intrument etablilhing the pan and  
dillrift, may reafonably be expected to replace  
them in the dil&#x27;pofitions and views of the whole  
Tuhjed.1 which oTigTnally dictated theconven­  
tion.  
I have the fcrisfaction to inform you that the  
objections which have been urged by that go­  
veminent againt the validity of our title to the  
country of Louifiana have been withdrawn —  
its exact limi.s however remaining ftiii to be  
&#x27;  
  
fettled betw een us. And to this is to be ad.led  
I that having prepared the (lock created in execu­  
&#x27; tic&lt;n of the convention prTaris of April 30th,  
&gt;803, in con Toleration of the ceiTion of that  
country, we have received from the government  
of France an acknowledgment in due form of  
the fulfilment of chat ftipulation  
With the nations of Kurope in general our  
! friendflnp and intercouri&#x27;e arc undifturbtd : and  
from tiie governments of the belligerent powers  
efpecially, we continue to receive thofe friendly  
1 inaiufellations which arc juftly due fn an honelt  
j neutrality, and to fuch good offices confident  
; with that, as we have opportunities of reoder­  
i&#x27;hc trtivity and fuccefs oT the fmall force  
employed in the Mediterranean in the early part  
of the pr fent year, the reinforcements fent into  
that lea, and the energy of the officers h iving  
command in the fcvcral veftels, will, 1 trull, by  
the luffcrings of war, reduce the barbarians of  
Tripoli to the defire of peace on prop*;* terms.  
Great injury however enfues to ou-f elves as  
well as to others interefted, from the diftan e  
toMflU^ich prizes mult be brought for adjudica­  
tion, and from the impracticability of bringing  
hithfr fm h as arc not fea worthy.  
Hrc Bey of Tunis having made requifitions  
unauthorised by our treaty, their rejertmn has  
produced from him fome expreflions of difeon­  
tent. But to thofe who expert us lo calculate  
whtther a compliance with unjuft demands will  
not coft U6 lefs than a war, we muil leave as a  
queftion of calculation for them alfo, whether  
to retire from unjuft demands will not coft  
them lefs than a war We can do to each  
other very lcnfiblc injuries by war. But the  
mu||ul advantages of peace mate that the bell  
inttffeft of both.  
  
Pence and intercourfe with the other powers  
onWhe fame coalt continue on the tooting on  
which they are eft»blilhed by treaty.  
In purluance of the aft providing for the  
temporary government of Louifiana, the necef­  
fary officers for the teritory of Orleans were ap­  
pointed in due time to commence the exercife  
of their functions on tfie firit day of October.  
The diftance however of fome of them, and in­  
difpepfible previous arrangements, may have re­  
tarded its commencement in fome of its parts.  
I&#x27;he form of government thus provided having  
been confidered hut as temporary, and open to  
fuehfuture improvemens as further information  
of the ihtumitances of our brethren there  
might fuggefl, it will of courfe be lubjeft to your  
cotfideration  
In the difh ift df Louifiana it has been thought  
belt to adopt the divifim into luburdrfme dif­  
trifts which had been eftablilhed under its former  
government. Thefe being five in number,a com­  
manding &lt; fficcr has been appointed to each, ac­  
cording to the provifions of the law, and fo  
foon as they can be at their Aations, that diitrift  
wiil alfo be in its dxie liatc of organization.  
In the mean time their places are fuppiied by  
the officers before commanding there, and the  
funftions of the governor and judges of India­  
na having commenced, the government, we  
prefume, is proceeding in its new form. The  
lead m nes in that didrift oiler fo rich a fupply  
of that metal as to merit attention. The report  
now communicated will inform you of their  
(late, and of the neceifity of immediate enquiry  
into their occupation and titles.  
With the Indian tribes, cftablifhed within our  
newly acquired limits, I have deemed it necef­  
firy to open conferences for the purpofe of ef­  
tablifiling a good underfianding and neighborly  
relations between us. So far as we have yet  
learned, w* have reafon to believe that their dif­  
politions are generally favorable and friendly  
And,with thefe difpolitions on their part,we have  
  
in our own hands means which cannot tail us,  
for preferving their peace and friendlhip. by  
I purfuing an uniform courfe of juftice towards  
them, by aiding them in all the improvements  
which may better their condition, and efpecially  
by eltablilhing a commerce on terms which ihali  
be advantageous to them, and only not lofing  
to us, and lo regulated as that no incendiaries,  
of our own, or any other nation, may be per­  
mitted to difturb the natural effeCl of our juft  
and friendly otfices, we may render ourfeiVcs l&#x27;o  
neceffaryto their comfort and pr»fperity, that  
the protection of our citizens from their difor­  
derly members will become their intereft and  
their voluntary care. Inftead therefore of an  
augmentation of military force proportioned to  
our extention of frontier, I pro pole a moderate  
enlargement of the capital employed in that  
commerce as a more effectual, economical and  
humane inltrument for preferving peace and  
I good neighborhood with them.  
On this lide the Miffifippi an important re­  
linquishment of native title has been received  
from the Delawares. That tribe, defiring to  
extinguifti in their people the lpirit of hunting,  
and to convert fuperihtous lands into the means  
of improving what they retain, has ceded to us  
ail the country between the Wabafh and Ohio,  
fouth ot, and including the road from the Rap  
ids towards Vincennes ; from which they are  
to receive annuities in animals and impliments  
for agriculture, and in other neceffaries. This  
acquilHon is important not only for its extent  
and fertility, but as, fronting three hundred  
miles on the Ohio, and near half that on the  
Wabalh, the produce of the fouled country de­  
  
fcendirig thofe rivers will no longer pa ft in re­  
view of the !n Man frontier, but in a final! por­  
tion j and, with rhecc&#x27;Iion heretofore ma le by  
the Kaikalkiay, rtearry-vTudbl idatcs our poll&#x27;d-&#x27;  
(i: ns north of the Ohio, in a very n-ip-.-Ctable  
breadth from Lake Erie to the Midi *ppi.—  
I he Piankefhaws having fune claim to the  
c untry ceded by the Delawares, it h?.s been  
thought bell to quiet that by fair tnrrhnle -1* j.  
So loon as thetrea*:es cn this fubjcfl fin! have  
received their conftituiiorml lanbliooa, they  
fhali be laid before both houfes.  
lhe a£t of Congrefs of.February 28. &#x27;803,  
for (wilding and employing a number of gun  
rv»ats, is now in a courfe of execution to the  
extent there provided for. i he obitacle to na­  
val enterprife which vefTels of th*. conftruchon  
offer for our f a ort towns, their utility towards  
fuprorting within our waters the authority of  
the laws, the promptnefs with whiefcf-they #ill  
be manned by the feamen and militia of the  
place in the moment they are wanting, the faci­  
lity of their aflbmbling from diflerent^parts of  
the coail to any point where they are required  
in greater force than ordinary, the economy of ^  
their maintenance and prefVrvation from decay#  
j when not in actual lervice, an t the competence  
of our finances to this defenfive pravifion wi h­  
■ out any ner burthen, are confiderations which  
will have due weight with Cong refs in dec id ng  
on the expediency of adding to them number  
from year to vear, as experience (ball t*dl their  
utility, until all our important harbors, by rnefe  
and auxiliary means (hail be fecured agamlt in­  
fult and opofition to the laws.  
No circumftance has arifen fmee your laft  
feffion which calls fo- any augmentation of our  
regular military force. Should any improve­  
ment occur it: the miiita fyiteni, that will be aU  
wavs fealonable.  
  
Accounts ot the receipts and expenditures oi  
the laft year, with eftimates for the evfutng one  
wiii, as ufual be laid before you.  
The hate of our finances continues to fulfil  
cur expectations. Eleven millions and an half  
of dollars, receive ! in the courfe of the year en­  
ding on the 30th of September lad, have ena­  
bled us, after meeting all the ordinary exppnces &#x27;  
of the year, to pay upwards oi three millions fix  
hundred thoufand dollars of the public debt,  
excluftve of interelt. This payment, with thofc  
of the two preceding years, h.13 extlnguifhed  
upwards of twelve millioms of principal, and a  
greater fum of intereft, within that period ; ,  
and, by a proportionate diminution of inrereit,  
renders already fenfible the eit’eCt of the grow­  
ing fum yearly applicable to the difeharge of  
principal. *1 &lt; %  
It is aifo afeertained thit the revenue afccrtt*&quot;  
ed during the laft year, exceeds that of the pre­  
ceding \ and the probable receipts of the c fu­  
t ing year may fafciy be relied on as fu (orient,  
i with the fum already in the Trcafury, to meet  
j all the current demands of the year, to dif­  
i charge upwards or three millions and an half  
of the engagements incurred under the Britifh  
&amp; French conventions, &amp; to advance in the  
further redemption of the funded debt as rapid­  
ly as had been contemplated. /  
l’hefe fellow citizens, are the principal mat­  
ters which I have thought it nfecsiTiry at thi#  
time to communicate for your conlideration and  
attention.—Seme others will be&#x27;laid before you  
in the courfe of the fefiton. But in the vlif­  
charge of the great duties confided to you by  
our country, yon will take a brdXtler view pf  
the field of legtllition. . Whether the great in­  
terelts of ag; iculture, manufactures, commcred  
or navigation, can, within the pale of yOur  
conflitutional powers, be aided in any of their  
relations ? Whether law&#x27;s are provided in all  
cafes where they are wanting ? Whether thofd  
provided are exactly what they fivnuld be ?  
Whether any abufes take place in their admin­  
illration or in that of the public revenues ?  
Whether the organization of the public agents,  
or of the public force is perfeCt in all its parts ?  
In fine, whether any thing can be done to ad­  
vance the general good ? - arc qudtions,within  
the limits of your .functions, which will rtecel­  
farily occupy your attention. In thefe and all*  
other matters, which you in your wifdom may  
propofe for the good of our country, you may  
count with afiurance ou my hearty co-uperation  
and faithful execution.

the explanations which would reach

diftance howvver of fome ofthem, and  
ilidifpenfible previous arrangements

I11 the diftriA of Louifiana it has been  
thought belt to adopt the divilion into  
fubordinate diftricts which had been ef-  
tabliliied under its former government.  
Tliefe being five in number, a comman-  
ding officer has been appointed to each  
according to the provisions of the Jtiw;  
and fo foon as they can be at theirtyb  
tions that diftriiri will alfo be in its &amp;  
(fate oforganization. Inthe mean tic  
their places are fuppliedby the officers  
before commanding there, and the func-  
tions of the governor and judges of Indi-  
ana having commenced, the government,  
we presume, is proceed* ng in its new form.  
The lead mines in that diftridl &lt;|(T r fo rich  
1 fupply of th it metal as to merit atten-  
tion. The report now communicated  
will inform you of theirfi ite, and of the  
neceffity of immediate enquiry into their  
occupation and titles  
  
With the Indian tribes eftablifhed  
within our newly acquired lim : ts, I have  
thought it necessary to open conferences  
for the purpose of elfabliftiing a good  
underftanding and neighbourly relations  
between us. So far as we have yet learn-  
ed, we have reafon to believe that thier  
difpolitions are g?n;ierally favorabletand  
friendly. And, with thefe difpofiuW  
on their part, we have in our hffiialf  
means which cannot fail us, for prriW  
ring their peace and friendffiip. gy  
fiurfuing ai uniform courfe of julfice to-  
wards them, by aiding them in all the  
improvements which may better their  
condition, and cfpeciallv by eftabliffiing  
a commerce on terms which (hall he ad-  
vantag-ous to them, and only not lofing  
to us, and fo regulated as that no in-  
cendiaries, of our own, or any other na-  
tion, may he permitted to difturb the  
natural efFedfs of our juft and friendly  
offices, we may render ourfelves fo ne-  
ceffary to their comfort and profperity,  
that the proteftion of our citizens fiom  
their dil&#x27;orderly members will become  
their inereft and their voluntary care.  
Inftead therefore of an augmentation of  
military force proportioned to our ex-  
tenlion ot frontier, I propofe a moderate  
enlargement of the capital employed in  
that commerce asamore effect Hal, eco-  
•lomical and humane inflrurnent for  
nreferviug peace and good neighbor-  
hood with them.

oie the fpirit of hunting, and to convert  
Uinerfluous lands into the means of im-  
proving what they retain, has ceded to  
us all the country between the Wabafli  
and Ohio, fouth of, and including the  
oad from the Rapids towards Vincennes ;  
tor which they are to receive annuities  
in apimals and implements for agricul-  
ure, and in other neceffiiries. This ac-  
quifition is important not only for its ex-  
tent and fertility, but as, fronting three  
hundred miles on the Ohio, and near half  
that outlie Wabaffi, the produce of the  
fettled country defending thole rivers  
will no longer pafs in review of the Indi-  
an frontier, but in afmall portion ,* and,  
frith the celfion heretofore made bv the  
K id: tfk as, nearly confolidates our pof-  
felfion s north of the Ohio, in a very ref-  
peftable breadth from Lake Erie to the

ofiicers having command in the several yes-

reduce the barbariaus of Tripoli to the de.

injury, bowever, ensues. to ourselves, as  
well as to others interested, from the dis-  
tance to which the prizes must be brouylt  
for adjudication, and from the impracticabi-  
lity of bringing hither such as are not sea-  
werthy. Lhe Bey cof Tunis having made  
requisitions unauthorized by our treaty, their  
rejection has_ produced from him some ex-  
pressions of discontent... But to those who

with unjust de:auds will not. cost us less

calculation for them also, whether to retire  
from upjust demands will not cost them less  
thana war. We can do te each other very  
sensible injuries by war. But the mutual  
advantages of peace make that the best in-  
terest of both, Peace and intercourse  
with the other powers on the same coast  
continue on. the foating on which they are

the act, providing for the temporary govern-  
ment,of Louisiana, the necessary oflicers for  
the territory of Ocleans, were, appointed in  
due time to commence the exercise of their  
fuuctions.on the first day of Oct, The dis-  
tance, however, of some of them, and in-  
dispensable previous arrangements may have  
retarded its commencement in. some of ils  
parts. The form of government thus pro-  
vided, having been considered but as tem-  
porary, and pen to such future improve-  
ments, as further information of the. cir-  
cumstances of our brethren. there mig)t

fair consideration. ——In the district of

inquiry into their occupation and titles.-—-  
With the Indian tribes esfeblished within  
our newly acquired limits, | have deemed  
it necessary to open conferences for the pur-  
pose of establishing a good understanding  
and neighbourly relations between us. So  
far as we have yet learned, we have reason  
to believe that their dispositions arg gene.  
rally favourable ‘and friendly. And with  
these dispositions on their part, we have in  
our hands means which cannot fail for pre-  
serving their peace and friendship. Instead  
of an augmentation of military force, pro-  
portioned to an augmentation of frontier, |  
propose a moderate enlargement of the  
capital employed in that commerce, as a  
more effectual, economical, and humane  
instrument for gorge peace and good  
neighbourhood with them.——On this side  
the Mississippi, an important relinquishment  
of native title has been received from the  
Sate that tribe desiring to extinguish  
the spirit of hunting, and to convert super-  
fluous lands into the means of improving  
what they retain, has ceded to us all the  
country between the Wabash and the Ohio,  
South of, and including the road from the  
Rapids towards Vincennes, for which they  
are to receive annuities in animals andim-  
plements of egriculture. The Pinkeshaws  
having some claim to the country ceded by  
the Delawares, it has been thought better  
to quiet that ‘claim by fair purchase also,  
So soon as the treaties on this subject shal!  
have received their constitutional sanctions,  
they shail be laid before both houses.——

satisfaction to observe, that the war which was lighted up in  
Europe a little before our last meeting, has not, yet extend-  
ed its flames to other nations, nor been marked by the  
calamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war.—  
The irregularities, too, on the ocean, which generally harass  
the commerce of neutral nations, have, in distant parts,  
disturbed ours less than on former occasions: but, in the  
American seas, they have been greater from peculiar  
causes; and even within our harbours and jurisdiction,  
infringements on the authority of the laws have been  
committed, which have called for serious attention. ‘The  
friendly conduct of the governments, from whose officers  
and subjects these acts have proceeded, in other respects,  
and in places more under their observation and control,  
gives us confidence that our representations on this subject  
wiil have been properly regarded. |  
  
While noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean  
by others, those on our own part should not be omitted,  
nor left unprovided for. Complaints have been received,  
that persons residing within the United States, have taken  
®n themselves to arm merchant vessels, and to force a com-  
Merce into certain ports and countries, in defiance to the  
laws of those countries. That individuals should undertake  
to wage private war, independently of the authority of  
their country, cannot be permitted ina well ordered society.  
Its tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights  
of other nations, and to endanger the peace of our own, is  
so obvious, that I doubt not you will adopt measures for  
restraining it effectually in future.  
  
Soon after the passage of the act of last session, authoris-  
ing the establishment of a district and port of entry on the  
Mobile, we learnt that its object was misunderstood on the  
part of Spain. Candid’explanations were immediately given,  
and assurances that reserving our claims in that quarter as a

end friendship exisiing between the two nations; and that  
conformably to these intentions, would be the execution of  
the law: that governnient had however thought proper to  
suspend the ratificafion of the convention of 1802. But  
the explanations which would reach them soon after, and  
still mere the confirmation of them by the tenor of the  
instrument establishing the port and district, may reasona-  
bly be expected tc replace them in the dispositions and views  
of the whole subject which originally dictated the convention.  
  
I have the satisfaction to inform you, that the objections  
which had been urged by that government, against the vali-  
dity of our title to the country of Louisiana, have been with-  
drawn: its exact limits, however, remaining still to be settled  
between us. And to this isto be added, that having pre-  
pared and delivered the stock created in execution of the  
convention of Paris, of April 30th, 1803, in consideration of  
the cession of that country, we have received from the  
government of France an acknowledgement in due forna  
of the fulfilment of that stipulation.  
  
With the nations of Europe in general our’ friendship  
and intercourse are undisturbed; and from the govern-  
ments of the belligerent powers-especially, we continue te  
receive those friendly manifestations which are justly due  
to an henest neutrality, and to such good offices consistent  
with that, as we have opportunities of rendering.  
  
The activity and success of the small force employed in  
the Mediterranean in the early part of the present year,  
the reinforcements sent into that sea, and the energy of  
the officers having command in the several vessels, will,  
I trust, by the sufferings of war, reduce the barbarians of  
Tripoli to the desire of peace on proper terms. Great in-  
jury, however, ensues to ourselves, as well as others inter-  
ested, from the distance to which prizes must be brought  
for adjudication, and from the impraeticability of bringing  
hither such as are not sca-worthy.

The bey of Tunis, having made requisitions unauthor-  
ized by our treaty, their rejection has produced from him  
‘some expressions of discontent. But to those who expect  
us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands  
will not cost us less than a war; we must leave as a question  
of calculation for them also, whether to retire from unjust  
demands will not cost them less than a war? We can do to  
-each other very sensible injuries by war; but the mutual  
advantages of peace, make that the best interest of both.  
  
Peace and intercourse with the other powers on the same  
coast, continue on the footing, on which they are establish-  
  
ed by treaty.  
  
In pursuance of the act, providing for the temporary  
government of Louisiana, the necessary officers for the  
territory of Orleans were appointed in due time to com-  
‘mence the exercise of their functions on the first day of  
  
October.  
  
The distance, however, of some of them, and  
  
‘indispensible previous arrangements, may have retarded its  
commencement in some of its parts. The form of govern-  
~ment thus provided, having been considered but as tempo-  
rary, and open to such future improvements as further in-  
formation of the circumstances of our brethren might sug-  
gest, it will of course be subject to your consideration.  
  
In the district of Louisiana it has been thought best to  
adopt the division into subordinate districts which had been  
established under its former government. These being five  
in number, a commanding officer has been appointed to  
each, according to the provision of the law, and so soon as  
they can be at their stations, that district will also be in a  
due state of organization. In the mean time their places  
are supplied by officers before commanding there, and the  
functions of the governor and judges of Indiana having com-  
menced, the government we presume, is proceeding in its  
  
new form.  
  
The lead mines in that district offer so rich a  
  
supply of that metal as to merit attention, The report now

communicated will inform you of the state, and the neces-  
sity of immediate enquiry into their occupation and titles.  
With the Indian tribes established within our newly ac-  
quired limits, I have deemed it necessary to open confer-  
ences for the purpose of establishing a good understanding  
and neighbourly relations between us. So far as we have  
yet learned, we have reason to believe that their dispositions  
are generally favourable and friendly. And, with these cis-  
positions on their part, we have in our own hands means  
which cannot fail us, for preserving their peace and friend-  
ship. By pursuing an uniform course ef justice towards  
them, by aiding them in all the improvements which may  
better their condition, and especially by establishing a com-  
merce on terms which shall be advantageous to them, and  
only not losing to us, and so regulated, as that no incendia-  
ries of our own, or any other nation, may be permitted to  
disturb the natural effects of our just and friendly offices ;  
we may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort and  
prosperity, that the protection of our citizens from their dis-  
orderly members will become their interest and their volun-  
tary care. Instead, therefore, of an augmentation of mili-  
  
tary force, proportioned to our extension of the capital em-  
  
ployed in that commerce as a more effectual, economical and  
humane instrument, for preserving peace and good neigh-  
bourhood with them.  
  
On this side the Missisippi an rmportant relinquishment  
of native title has been received from the Delawares. That  
tribe, desiring to extinguish in their people the spirit of  
hunting, and to convert superfluous lamds into the means of  
improving what they retain, has ceded to us all the country  
between the Wabash and Ohio, south of, and including the  
road from the Rapids towards Vincennes ; for which they  
are to receive annuities in animals and implements for agricul-  
ture, and in other necessaries. This acquisition is import-  
ant, not only for its extent and fertility, but-as fronting three

hundred miles on the Ohio, and near half that on the Wa-  
basi; the produce of the settled country descending those  
mivers will no longer pass in review of the Indian frontier,  
but in a small portion; and, with the cession heretofore  
made by the L.askaskias, nearly consolidate our possessions  
north of the Ohio, in a very respectable breadth from Lake  
Irie to the Missisippi. The Piankeshaws having some  
claim to the country ceded by the Delawares, it has been  
  
  
  
  
  
thought best to quiet that by fair purchase also. So soon as  
the treaties on this subject shall have received the constitu-  
tional sanction, they shall be Jaid before both houses. |  
  
The act of Congress, of February 28, 1803, for building  
and employing a number of gun-boats, is now in a course of  
execution to the extent there provided for. The obstacle to  
naval enterprize, which vessels of this construction offer for  
our sea-port towns, their utility towards supporting within  
our waters the authority of the law, the promptness with  
which they will be manned by the seamen and militia of the,  
place in the moment they are wanting, the facility of their  
assembling from different parts of the coast to any point  
where they are required in greater force than ordinary, the  
economy of their maintenance and preservation from decay  
when not in actual service, and the competence of our finan-  
ces to this defensive provision without any new burthen, are  
considerations which will have due weight with Congress in  
deciding on the expediency of adding to their number from  
year to year, as experience shall test their utility, until all  
our important harbours, by these and auxiliary means, shall  
be secured against insult and opposition to the laws.  
  
No circumstance has arisen since our last session, which  
calls for any augmentation of our regular military force.  
Should any improvement occur in the militia system, that  
will be always seasonable. ,  
  
Accounts of the receipts and expenditures of last year,  
  
with estimates for the ensuing one, will, as usual, be laid  
before you.
