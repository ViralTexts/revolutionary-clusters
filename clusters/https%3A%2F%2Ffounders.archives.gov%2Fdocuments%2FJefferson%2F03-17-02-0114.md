Mr Scab Sib :’ I rtoelred yesterday yonr faror  
of the 6tb, and now enoloee for Mr: Bartpn a letter  
of Introduction to M. de Lafayette, the only per­  
sonal aoqnalntance I hare now living in France.  
On polities I can say little to&#x27; yon, having with­  
drawn all attention to them from the day of my  
retirement. My eonddenee In both of my succes­  
sors has been w entire that it assured me all was  
going on for thebest under their oare. lam sor­  
ry to see our expanses greater than oar inoome.  
Debt and revolution are inseparable as causa and  
effect. It is the point of peenUar sensibility in  
onr people, and one whioh they will‘not_long en­  
due. Parties will bo arranged on the principle  
of reformation, and there can be no doubt.whleh  
will bo the strongest. It would .do some good if it  
could obliterate the geogrepMeel. division , which  
threatened and Btiil-threatens onr separation. This  
last is the&#x27;most fatal of. all divisions. It has ever.  
been my Creed that the continuance of onr Union  
depends entirely on Pennsylvania and Virginia.  
If they bold together nothing North or South will  
fly off.. „  
I firmly believe all the Governments of Europe  
will become representative. The very troops sent  
to quell the spirit of reform at Naples will eatoli  
the fever, end earn it back to their own country.  
Weowe to all mankind the sacrifice of those mor­  
bid passions whioh would break onr Confederacy,  
the only anohor to whioh the hopes of the world  
ere moored.
