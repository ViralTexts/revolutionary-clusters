, Monroe asked why the regulation of elections for members of Congress was under the “ultimate controul” of the national legislature, “and also why there was an exception as to the place of electing senators” (Robertson, Virginia DebatesDavid Robertson, Debates and Other Proceedings of the Convention of Virginia (2d  
ed.; Richmond, 1805)., p. 261).  
  
  
Mr. Madison. Mr. Chairman—The reason of the exception was, that if congress could fix the place of choosing the senators, it might compel the state legislatures to elect them in a different place from that of their usual sessions, which would produce some inconvenience, and was not necessary for the object of regulating the elections. But it was necessary to give the general government a controul over the time and manner of choosing the senators, to prevent its own dissolution.  
With respect to the other point, it was thought that the regulation of time, place, and manner of electing the representatives, should be uniform throughout the continent. Some states might regulate the elections on the principles of equality, and others might regulate them otherwise. This diversity would be obviously unjust. Elections are regulated now unequally in some states, particularly South-Carolina, with respect to Charleston, which is represented by 30 members. Should the people of any state, by any means be deprived of the right of suffrage, it was judged proper that it should be remedied by the general government. It was found impossible to fix the time, place, and manner, of the election of representatives in the constitution. It was found necessary to leave the regulation of these, in the first place, to the state governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of the people, subject to the controul of the general government, in order to enable it to produce uniformity, and prevent its own dissolution. And considering the state governments and general government as distinct bodies, acting in different and independent capacities for the people, it was thought the particular regulations should be submitted to the former, and the general regulations to the latter. Were they exclusively under the controul of the state governments, the general government might easily be dissolved. But if they be regulated properly by the state legislatures, the congressional controul will very probably never be exercised. The power appears to me satisfactory, and as unlikely to be abused as any part of the constitution

and manner of that of Senators, and also, why  
there was an exception as to the place of electing  
Senators.  
  
Mr MADIsON.- Mr Chairman, the reason of the  
exception was, that if Congress could fix the place  
of choosing the Senators, it might compel the State  
Legislatures to elect them in a different place from  
that of their usual seasions, which would produce  
some inconvenience, and was not necessary for the  
object of regulating the elections. But it was ne  
cessary to give the general government a control  
over the time and manner of choosing the Senators,  
 to prevent its own dissolution.  
With respect to the other point, it was thought  
that the regulation of time, place, and manner of  
 electing the representatives, should be uniform  
throughgut the continent. Some States might re  
gulate the elections on the principles of equaliry,  
 and others might regulate them otherwise. The  
 diversity would be obviously unjust. Elections are  
 regulated now unequally in some States, particn­  
larly South, Carolinn, with respect to Charlesto  
which is represented by thirty members. She uld  
the people of any State, hy any means be deprived  
of the right of suffe ge, it was judged proper that  
it should be remedied by the general government,  
It was found impossible to fix the time, place and  
manner of the election of representatives in the con  
stitution. It was found necessary to leave the re  
gulations of these, in the first place, to the State  
governments, as being best acquainted with the  
situation of the people, subject to the control of the  
general government, in order to enable it to product  
uniformity, and prevent its own dissolution. And  
considering the State Governments and general gor  
vernment as distinct bodies acting in different and  
independent capacities for the people, it was thought  
the particular regulations should be submitted to  
the former, and the general regulations to the lat  
ter. Were they exclusively under the control of  
the State Governments, the general government  
might easily be dissolved. But if they be regulated  
properly by the State legislatures, the Congression  
al control will very probably never be exercised.  
The power appears to me satisfactory, and as un  
likely to be abused as any part of the Constitution.

he more than any other person, contributed to form  
and atterwards to establish, said, &quot;with respect to  
the other point, it wat thought that the regulation  
of time, place and manner, of electing the represen­  
tatives, should be uniform throughout the continent.  
States might regulate the elections on prin

otherwise. This diversity would be obviously un

some States, particularly South Carolina, with re­

&quot;Should the people of any State, by any means

of the people; subject to the control of the General  
Government, in order to enable it to produce uni­

This contemporaneous exposition, most clearly  
shows that it was not alone to prevent its own dis  
solution, that the power was vested in the General  
Government, nor was it contemplated that its exer

the election of Senators and Repre

Kelley quotes from the debates in the Vir  
ginia Convention which ratifled the Con­  
stitution of the United States. During the

Mr. Monre asked of Mr. Madison, who  
had also been a member of the National  
Constitutional Convention--&quot;information  
&quot;respecting the clauses concerning elec­

&quot;ernment a control over the time and  
&quot;manner of choosing the Senators, to pre-  
&quot;vent its own dissolution.&quot; The exception  
in regard to &quot;place&quot; was made to guard  
against the liability to fix upon some point  
other than that chosen by the State for the  
assembling of its Legislature. Mr. Madi­  
son added, in regard to the election of  
Representatives, that  
&quot;It was thought that the regulation of the

It was found impossible to fix the time and

to leave the regulation of this, in the fest

there was an exception as to the place of electing

Mr. Madison, the father of the Constitution,

‘““Mr. Chairman,’’ said Madison, ‘‘the reason of

1869.] IN RESPECT TO SUFFRAGE. 55  
  
ing the place of choosing Senators was, that otherwise the  
general government might compel the State Legislatures to  
meet in a different place than that of their usual sessions,  
then added :  
  
‘“‘ With respect to the other point, it was thought that the  
regulation of time, place and manner of electing the Repre-  
sentatives should be uniform throughout the continent. Some  
States might regulate the elections on the principles of equal-  
ity, and others might regulate them otherwise. The diversity  
would be obviously unjust. Elections are regulated unequally  
now in some of the States, particularly in South Carolina,  
with respect to Charleston, which is represented by thirty  
members. Should the people of any State by any means be  
deprived of ‘the RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE, it was proper that it should  
be remedied by the general government. It was found impossi-  
ble to fix the time, place and manner of the election of Rep-  
resentatives in the Constitution. It was found necessary to  
leave the regulation of these in the FIRST PLACE to the State  
governments, as being best acquainted with the situation of  
the people, SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL GOVERN-  
MENT, in order to enable it to produce uniformity and prevent  
its own dissolution. And considering the State government  
and general government as different bodies, acting in different  
and independent capacities, it was thought the particular reg-  
ulations should be submitted to the former, and the general  
regulations to the latter. Were they exclusively under the  
control of the State governments, the general government  
might easily be dissolved. But if they be regulated properly  
by the State Legislatures, the Congressional control will very  
probably never be exercised.”

and manner of electing the Representatives should be  
uniform throughout the continent. Some States might  
regulate the elections on the principles of equality, and  
others might regulate them otherwise. This diversity  
would be obviously unjust. Elections are now (1788) regu-  
lated unequally in some States, particularly in South  
Carolina, with respect to Charleston, which is repre-  
sented in the State Legislature by thirty members,  
Should the people of any State by any means be deprived  
of the right of suffrage it was judged proper that it should  
be remedied by the general Government.’ — [4 Elliot’s De-  
bates, p. 367.]

ve control of Con-  
gressional elections by the States has often  
been grossly abused, and is always liable  
to abuse in the hands of the dominant party  
in each State. Mr. Madison explains in his  
minutes of the Federal Convention that the  
power of Congress to make regulations  
under this head was supplied in order to  
enable it to regulate the elections if the  
States should fail or refuse to do so; and  
while admitting the full discretion vested by  
the Constitution in Congress, he expressed  
the opinign, in the Virginia Convention held

the State Legislatures, the Congressional
