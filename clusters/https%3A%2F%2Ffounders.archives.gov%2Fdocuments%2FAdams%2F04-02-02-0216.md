My dear Daughter  
Philadelphia, July 5th, 1777  
  
Yesterday, being the anniversary of American Independence, was celebrated here with a festivity and ceremony becoming the occasion.  
I am too old to delight in pretty descriptions, if I had a talent for them, otherwise a picture might be drawn, which would please the fancy of a Whig, at least.  
The thought of taking any notice of this day, was not conceived, until the second of this month, and it was not mentioned until the third. It was too late to have a sermon, as every one wished, so this must be deferred another year.  
Congress determined to adjourn over that day, and to dine together. The general officers and others in town were invited, after the President and Council, and Board of War of this State.  
In the morning the Delaware frigate, several large gallies, and other continental armed vessels, the Pennsylvania ship and row gallies and guard boats, were all hawled off in the river, and several of them beautifully dressed in the colours of all nations, displayed about upon the masts, yards, and rigging.  
At one o’clock the ships were all manned, that is, the men were all ordered aloft, and arranged upon the tops, yards, and shrowds, making a striking appearance—of companies of men drawn up in order, in the air.  
Then I went on board the Delaware, with the President and several gentlemen of the Marine Committee, soon after which we were saluted with a discharge of thirteen guns, which was followed by thirteen others, from each other armed vessel in the river; then the gallies followed the fire, and after them the guard boats. Then the President and company returned in the barge to the shore, and were saluted with three cheers, from every ship, galley, and boat in the river. The wharves and shores, were lined with a vast concourse of people, all shouting and huzzaing, in a manner which gave great joy to every friend to this country, and the utmost terror and dismay to every lurking tory.  
At three we went to dinner, and were very agreeably entertained with excellent company, good cheer, fine music from the band of Hes­sians taken at Trenton, and continual vollies between every toast, from a company of soldiers drawn up in Second-street before the city tavern, where we dined. The toasts were in honour of our country, and the heroes who have fallen in their pious efforts to defend her. After this, two troops of light-horse, raised in Maryland, accidentally here in their way to camp, were paraded through Second-street, after them a train of artillery, and then about a thousand infantry, now in this city on their march to camp, from North Carolina. All these marched into the common, where they went through their firings and manoeuvres; but I did not follow them. In the evening, I was walking about the streets for a little fresh air and exercise, and was surprised to find the whole city lighting up their candles at the windows. I walked most of the evening, and I think it was the most splendid illumination I ever saw; a few surly houses were dark; but the lights were very universal. Considering the lateness of the design and the suddenness of the execution, I was amazed at the universal joy and alacrity that was discovered, and at the brilliancy and splendour of every part of this joyful exhibition. I had forgot the ringing of bells all day and evening, and the bonfires in the streets, and the fireworks played off.  
Had General Howe been here in disguise, or his master, this show would have given them the heart-ache. I am your affectionate father,  
  
John Adams

‘* PHILADELPHIA, July 5th, 1777.  
  
‘¢My Dear DauGHTER:—Yesterday, being the  
anniversary of American Independence, was cele-  
brated here with a festivity and ceremony becom-

pretty descriptions, if I had a talent for tem,

of taking any notice of this day was not conceived  
until the 2d of this month, and it was not men-  
tioned until the 3d. It was too late to havea

ferred another year. Congress determined to  
adjourn over that day, and to dine together.  
The general officers and others in town were in-  
vited, after the President and Council and Board  
of War of this State. In the morning the Dela-  
ware frigate, several large galleys, and other Con-  
tinental armed vessels, the Pennsylvania ship and  
row-galleys, and guard-boats, were all hauled off  
in the river and several of them beautifully dressed  
in the colors of all nations displayed about the  
masts, yards and rigging. At one o’clock the  
ships were all manned; that is, the men were all  
ordered aloft and arranged upon the topyards and  
shrouds, making a striking appearance of companies  
of men drawn up in order in the air.  
  
‘¢ Then I went on board the Delaware with the  
President and several gentlemen of the Marine  
Committee; soon after which we were saluted with  
a discharge of thirteen guns, which was followed  
by thirteen others from each other armed vessel in  
the river—then the galleys followed the fire and  
after them the guard-boats. Then the President  
and company returned in the barge to the shore,  
and were saluted by three cheers from every ship,

galley and boat in the river. The wharves and  
shores were lined with a vast concourse of people,  
all shouting and huzzaing in a manner which gave  
great joy to every friend of this country, and the  
utmost terror and dismay to every lurking Tory.  
At three we went to dinner, and were very agree-  
ably entertained with excellent company, good  
cheer, fine music from the band of Hessians taken  
at Trenton, and continual volleys between every  
toast, from a company of soldiers drawn up in  
Second street, before the city tavern, where we  
dined. The toasts were in honor of our country  
and the heroes who had fallen in their pious efforts  
to defend her. After this, two troops of light-  
horse, raised in Maryland, accidentally here on  
their way to camp, were paraded through Second  
street; after them a train of artillery, and then  
about a thousand infantry, now in this city, on  
their march to camp, from North Carolina. All  
these marched into the common, where they went  
through their firings and manceuvres; but I did not  
follow them. In the evening I was walking about  
the streets for a little fresh air and exercise, and  
was surprised to find the whole city lighting up  
their candles at the windows. I walked most of  
the evening, and I think it was the most splendid  
illumination I ever saw—a few surly houses were  
dark, but the lights were very universal. Con-  
sidering the lateness of the design, and the sud-  
denness of the execution, I was amazed at the  
universal joy ana alacrity that was discovered, and  
at the brilliancy and splendor of every part of this  
joyful exhibition. I had forgot the ringing of  
bells all day and evening, and the bonfires in the  
streets, and the fireworks played off. Had General  
Howe been here in disguise, or his master, this  
show would have given them the heartache.

‘« Yesterday, being the anniversary of American Inde-  
pendence, was celebrated here with a festivity and cere-  
mony becoming the occasion. I am too old to delight in  
pretty descriptions, if I had a talent for them, otherwise  
a picture might be drawn which would please the fancy  
of a Whig, at least. The thought of taking any notice  
of this day was not conceived until the second of this  
  
month, and it was not mentioned until the third. It was  
  
too late to have a sermon, as every one wished. so this *  
  
must be deferred another year. Congress determined to  
adjourn over that day, and to dine together. The gen-  
eral officers and others in town were invited, after the  
President and Council and Board of War of this State.  
In the morning the ‘Delaware’ frigate, several large  
galleys, and other Continental armed vessels, the ‘ Penn-  
sylvania’ ship and row-galleys, and guard-boats, were  
all hauled off in the river, and several of them beauti-  
fully dressed in the colors of all nations displayed about  
the masts, yards and rigging. At one o’clock the ships  
were all manned; that is, the men were all ordered aloft  
and arranged upon the topyards and shrouds, making a  
striking appearance of companies of men drawn up in  
order in the air.  
  
‘‘Then I went on board the ‘Delaware’ with the  
President and several gentlemen of the Marine Commit-  
tee; soon after which we were saluted with a discharge  
of thirteen guns, which was followed by thirteen others  
  
(889) 5  
  
from each other armed vessel in the river, then the gal-  
leys followed the fire and after them the gunboats. Then  
the President and company returned in the barge to the

ner, and were very agreeably entertained with excellent  
company, good cheer, fine music from the band of Hes-  
sians taken at Trenton, and continual volleys between  
every toast from a company of soldiers drawn up in  
Second Street before the city tavern, where we dined.  
The toasts were in honor of our country and the heroes
