Mint of the United States  
Jany 1st. 1816.  
  
  
I have the honour, at this time, of laying before you, a Report of the operations of the Mint during the last year.  
From the Statement of the Treasurer, herewith transmitted, it will appear, that during that period there have been struck at the Mint—  
In gold coins, 635 pieces, amounting to $3,175 dollars;  
In silver coins, 69,232 pieces, amounting to 17,308 dollars; Making in the whole 69,867 pieces, amounting to $20,483 dollars.  
The high price of gold &amp; silver bullion, for some time past, in the current paper money of the country, has prevented, &amp;, as long as this shall continue to be the case, must necessarily prevent, deposits of these metals being made for coinage, to any considerable amount. But a fresh supply of copper having lately been received at the Mint, we have again resumed the coinage of cents: &amp; it is believed that we shall, in the course of the year, should no failure in the expected supply of copper take place, be fully able to coin fifty tons weight; amounting to nearly 47,000 dollars; and that, with a regular supply of copper, which can readily be procured, on terms highly advantageous to Government, we can continue to coin 50 tons per annum, as long as it may be judged expedient.  
The circulation of these copper coins, &amp; of those heretofore issued from the Mint (amounting to 251,646 Dollars) &amp; which must be still nearly all in the country, would, it is presumed, soon supply, in a great measure, the place of the small silver coins, which have now almost totally disappeared. I have the honour to be, Sir with the greatest respect &amp; esteem, your most obed. servt.

Mint or THe U. States, Jan. 1, 1816.  
  
Str—lI have the honor, at this time, of lay-  
  
ing before you, a report of the operations of the  
Mint, during the last year.  
  
From the statement of the treasurer, here-  
with transmiited, it will appear, that duiing  
that period there have been struck at the mint.  
  
In gold coins, 635 pieces, amounting to  
3,175 dollars: ,  
  
In silver coins, 69,232 pieces, amounting to  
17,308 dollars; making in the whole 89,367  
pieces, amounting to 20,483 dollars.  
  
The high price of gold and silver bullion, for  
some time past, in the current paper money of  
the country, bas prevented, and, as long as this  
shali continue to be the case, must necessa: ily  
prevent deposits of these metals being made for  
coinage, to any considerable amount. But a  
fresh supply of copper having lately been re-  
ceived at the mint, we have again resumed the  
coinage of cents; and it is: believed that we  
shall, in the course of the year, should no fai-  
  
  
  
  
  
60 -  
  
lurein the expected supply of copper take place,  
be fully able to coin fifty tons weight, amount  
ing to nearly 47,000 dollars; and that, with a  
regular supply of copper, which can readily be  
procured, on terms highly advantageous to go-  
vernment, we can continue to coin fifty tons  
per annum, as long as it may be jadged expe-  
dient,  
  
The circulation of these copper coins, and  
of those heretofore issued from the mint,  
(amounting to 251,646 dollars,) and which  
must be still nearly all in the country, weuld,  
itis presumed, soon supply, in a.great measvre,  
the place of the small silver coins, which have  
now almost totally disappeared.  
  
I have the honor to be, sir, with the greatest  
respect and esteem, your most obedient ser-  
vant, R. PATTERSON
