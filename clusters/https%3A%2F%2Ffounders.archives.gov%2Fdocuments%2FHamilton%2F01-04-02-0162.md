[New York, November 21, 1787]  
To the People of the State of New-York.  
A Firm Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It is impossible to read the history of the petty Republics of Greece and Italy, without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions, by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration, between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they exhibit

fore us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party-rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted indowments, for which the favoured soils, that produced them, have been so justly celebrated.  
From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics, the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms of republican government, but against the very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free government, as inconsistent with the order of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and partizans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have in a few glorious instances refuted their gloomy sophisms. And, I trust, America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices not less magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their errors.  
But it is not to be denied that the portraits, they have sketched of republican government, were too just copies of the originals from which they were taken. If it had been found impracticable, to have devised models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible. The science of politics, however, like most other sciences has received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power into distinct departments—the introduction of legislative ballances and checks—the institution of courts composed of judges, holding their offices during good behaviour—the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election—these are either wholly new discoveries or have made their principal progress towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellencies of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumstances, that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I shall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more on a principle, which has been made the foundation of an objection to the New Constitution, I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such systems are to revolve either in respect to the dimensions of a single State, or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great confederacy. The latter is that

 the object under consideration. It will however be of use to examine the principle in its application to a single State which shall be attended to in another place.  
The utility of a confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard the internal tranquillity of States, as to increase their external force and security, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced upon in different countries and ages, and has received the sanction of the most applauded writers, on the subjects of politics. The opponents of the PLAN proposed have with great assiduity cited and circulated the observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work, nor to have adverted to the consequences of th

in opposition to a general Union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for extending the sphere of popular government and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism.  
“It is very probable (says he)  
  
Spirit of Laws, Vol. I. Book IX. Chap. I.  
  
that mankind would have been obliged, at length, to live constantly under the government of a SINGLE PERSON, had they not contrived a kind of constitution, that has all the internal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.  
“This form of Government is a Convention, by which several smaller States agree to become members of a larger one, which they intend to form. It is a kind of assemblage of societies, that constitute a new one, capable of encreasing by means of new associations, till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united body.  
“A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may support itself without any internal corruption. The form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniencies.  
“If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit, in all the confederate states. Were he to have too great influence over one, this would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces, independent of those which he had usurped, and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation.  
“Should a popular insurrection happen, in one of the confederate States, the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound. The State may be destroyed on one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.  
“As this government is composed of small republics it enjoys the internal happiness of each, and with respect to its external situation it is possessed, by means of the association of all the advantages of large monarchies.”  
I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages, because they contain a luminous abrigement of the principal arguments in favour of the Union, and must effectually remove the false impressions, which a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to produce. They have at the same time an intimate connection with the more immediate design of this Paper; which is to illustrate the tendency of the Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.  
A distinction, more subtle than accurate has been raised between a confederacy and a consolidation of the States. The essential characteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a Confederate Government. These positions are in the main arbitrary; they are supported neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed happened that governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner, which the distinction, taken notice of, supposes to be inherent in their nature—but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the practice, which serve to prove as far as example will go, that there is no absolute rule on the subject. And it will be clearly shewn, in the course of this investigation, that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the government.  
The definition of a Confederate Republic seems simply to be, an “assemblage of societies” or an association of two or more States into one State. The extent, modifications and objects of the Fœderal authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate organisation of the members be not abolished, so long as it exists by a constitutional necessity for local purposes, though it should be in perfect subordination to the general authority of the Union, it would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of States, or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an abolition of the State Governments, makes them constituent parts of the national sovereignty by allowing them a direct representation in the Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea of a Fœderal Government.  
In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty three CITIES, or republics, the largest were intitled to three votes in the COMMON COUNCIL, those of the middle class to two and the smallest to one. The COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of the respective CITIES. This was certainly the most delicate species of interference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing, that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is the appointment of their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this association, says “Were I to give a model of an excellent confederate republic, it would be that of Lycia.” Thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian, and we shall be led to conclude that they are the novel refinements of an erroneous theory

* If it had been found impracticable,” says General Hamilton, ‘ to have  
devised models of a more perfect structure than any of the republics that  
have heretofore existed, the enlightened friends of liberty would have been  
obliged to abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible.  
The science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has received  
great improvements. The efficacy of various principles is now well under-  
stood, which were either not known at all, or imperfectly known, to the  
ancients. The regular distribution of power into distinct departments, the  
introduction of legislative balances and checks, the institution of courts

these are either wholly new discoveries, or have made their principal pro-  
gress towards perfection in modern times. They are means and powerful  
means, by which the excellencies of republican government may be retained,  
and its imperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circum-

the circumstances of the case, but most consonant to the dic-  
tates of reason.  
  
‘* A confederate government,” says the Federalist, “‘ seems simply to be,  
an assemblage of societies, or an association of two or more states into one.  
The extent, modifications, and objects of the federal authority, are mere  
matters of discretion. So long as the separate organization of the members  
be not abolished,—so long as it exists, by a constitutional necessity for local  
purposes, though it should be in perfect subordination to the general au-  
thority of the union, it would still be in fact, and in theory, an association of  
states, or a confederacy. A distinction more subtle than accurate, has been  
raised between a confederacy and a consolidation of the states. The essen-  
tial characteristic of the first, is said to be the restriction of its authority to  
the members in their collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals  
of whom they are composed. It is contended that the national government  
ought to have no concern with any object of internal administration. An ex-  
act equality of suffrage between the members, has also been insisted upon  
as a leading feature of a confederate government. These positions are {n  
the main arbitrary; they are supported neither by principle nor precedent.  
It has indeed happened, that governments of this kind, have generally  
operated in the manner which the distinction noticed supposes to be inher-  
ent in their nature, but there have been in most of them extensive excep-  
tions to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that  
there is no absolute rule on the subject.”  
  
So much for the general nature of a confederacy. But it

&quot; The utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress fac­  
tion and to guard the internal tranquillity of States, as to  
increase their external force and security, is in reality not a  
new idea. It has been practised upon in different countries  
and ages, and has received the sanction of the most approved  
writers on the subject of politics.&quot;  
&quot; &#x27;It is very probable,&#x27; says Montesquieu, ?that mankind  
? would have bean obliged, at length, to live constantly under  
? the government of a single person,. had they not con­  
&#x27; trived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advan­  
?tages of a republican, together with the external force of a  
? monarchical government. I mean a confederate republic.  
&quot; &#x27;A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external  
? force, may support itself without any internal corruption.  
? The form of this society prevents all manner of inconve­  
? niences.  
&quot; &#x27; If a single member should attempt to usurp the su­  
? preme authority, he could not be suppled to have an equal  
&#x27; authority and credit in all the confederate 8tates. Were he  
4 to have too great influence over one, this ivould alarm the  
&#x27;rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still  
&#x27; remain free might oppose him with forces, independent of  
4 those which he hsd usurped, and overpower him before he  
&#x27; could be settled in his usurpation.  
&quot;?Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the  
&#x27; confederate States, the others are able to quell it. Should  
&#x27;tbuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that  
? remain sound. The State may be destroyed on one side  
&#x27; and not on the other?? the confederacy may be dissolved,  
&#x27; and the confederates preserve their sovereignty.&#x27;

“A distinction more subtle than accurate has been raised be-  
tween a Confederacy and a consolidation of the States. The  
essential characteristic of the first is said to be the restriction of  
its authority to the members in their collective capacities, without  
reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is  
contended that the national council ought to have no concern  
with any object of internal administration. An exact equality of  
suffrage between the members has also been insisted upon as a  
leading feature of a confederate government. These positions  
are in the main arbitrary; they are supported neither by princi-  
ple nor precedent. It has indeed happened that governments of  
this kind have generally operated in the manner which the dis-  
tinction taken notice of supposes to be inherent in their nature ;  
but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions to the  
practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that  
there is no absolute rule on the subject. The definition of a con-  
federate Republie seems simply to be ‘an assemblage of societies,’  
or an association of two or more States into one State. The ex-  
tent, modifications, and objeets of the federal authority are mere  
matters of discretion. So long as the separate organization of  
the members be not abolished, so long as it exists by a constitu-  
tional necessity for local purposes, though it should be in perfect  
subordination to the general authority of the Union, it would still  
be, in fact and in theory, an association of States, or a confede-  
racy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an aboli-

tion of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of  
the national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representa-  
tion in the Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive  
and very important portions of the sovereign power. This fully  
corresponds, in every rational import of the terms, with the idea  
of a federal government.”  
  
A National Government does not necessarily imply a merging  
of the separate States, or the consolidation of the peoples of the  
different States, thus united into one people. The republics of  
Holland and Switzerland, though each had a national name and  
government, prove the contrary. They had a Union and National  
Gavernment, yet their States were never merged. Wonderful is  
the perseverance of the people of New England in propagating  
their opinions and peculiar notions. We see it and feel it i

tory.  
Our political bark has proved by experi­  
ence that it is qualified to stand the storms  
of hostility and war, as well as the calm un­  
ruffled ocean of peace. The Constitution of  
the United States is the most sublime insti  
tution of human wisdom, and the fairest  
scenes of individual and national happiness,  
are the fruits which we derive from the union  
of the States. The Americans have asserted  
the dignity of human nature, and proved to  
the world that mankind are capable of self  
Government. The enemies of liberty had  
decried all free government as inconsistent  
with the order of society. But happily for  
mankind, our confederacy, based on &quot;the  
rights of man,&quot; has flourished, and most  
gloriously refuted their gloomy sophisms,  
and become the admiration of the world.  
Experience has proved that that government  
which is the most free, is the most pow  
ver  
ful. That condition of national elevation,  
which the nations of Europe have been two  
thousand years in acquiring, the U.S. have  
surpassed in a little over half a century.  
The State legislatures take care of all our  
purely local affairs, and the general govern­

It is very probable, says Montesquien, that man  
kind would have been obliged, at fength, to live con­  
stantly under the Government of a sinple person, had  
they not contrived a kind of constitution that has  
all the internal advantages of a Republican, togeth­  
er with the external force of a Monarchial Govern­  
ment. I mean a Confederate Republic. This form of  
Government is a convention by which several small­  
er States agree to become members of a larger one,  
which they intend to form. It is a kind of assem­  
blage of societies, that constitute a new one, capable  
of increesing, by new associations, till they arise to  
such a degree of power as to be able to provide for  
the security of the united body.  
The Cots may be destroyed on one side and not  
on the other; the Confederacy may be dissolved, and  
the confedertes preserve their sovereignty.  
Hamilton says, agrecing with montestien.  
he definition of a Confederate Republic seems  
simply to be an asseribling of societies,&quot; or an asso­  
ciation of one or two more States into one State.  
The extent, modifications, and objects of the Federal  
authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as  
the separate organization of the members be notubolished

obliged to live under the sway of individual rulers, had they  
not devised a form of constitution which has all the internal  
advantages of a republican government combined with the ex-  
ternal force of a monarchy. I speak of the federated repub-

society of societies, making of them a new one, which may  
be increased by the addition of new associates, and which  
will provide for the safety of its united, component members.  
This sort of republic, capable of resistance to external attack,  
can exist in its magnitude without liability to internal corrup-  
tion. The form of this society provides against all accidents.  
  
He who would become an usurper is little likely to be equally  
popular in all the states. If he becomes too popular in one,  
he alarms the others. Should he subjugate a part, the por-  
tion which still remains free can resist him with forces inde-  
pendent of those he has usurped and crush him before he has  
succeeded in establishing his position. If there should arise  
any sedition in one of the confederate members the others can  
quiet it. If some abuse is introduced in one part, it will be  
corrected by the parts that remain healthful. Such a state  
can perish on one side without perishing on the other. The  
confederation can be dissolved and the confederated units vet  
remain sovereign.

ternal advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a  
monarchical government. Its description is a convention by which several  
states agree to become members of a larger one which they intend to es-  
tablish. It is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one,  
capahle of increasing by means of further association. The expanding  
quality of such government is peculiarly fitted for the United States, the  
greater part of whose territory is yet uncultivated. But while this form  
of government enabled us to surmount the difficulty last mentioned, it  
conducted us to another. It left us almost without precedent or guide,  
without the benefit of that instruction which in many cases may be derived  
from the constitution, history, and experience of other nations.
