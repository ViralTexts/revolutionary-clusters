At this eventful crisis, when you have manifested the intention of declining a re-election, the Legislative Council and House of Representatives of the territory of Orleans avail themselves of the last opportunity they can expect to enjoy of addressing you in your official Character as President of the United States.  
However we may regret in Common with our fellow Citizens of the United States, this determination to decline being a Candidate for the highest office in the gift of the People, The Motives which induce it, afford another proof of your Patriotism, and must command the admiration of your Country!  
On this occasion, there is no doubt you were guided by a sacred Veneration for the true principles of the constitution, as well as respect for the high example of the first President of the United States of glorious Memory!  
We have witnessed with infinite concern That a dignified and impartial Neutrality towards the belligerant nations of Europe has not been sufficient to protect the United States against incroachments upon their rights, dignity, and independence, and altho’ we deprecate war, if there is no other alternative, but disgraceful submission, to unlawful, arbitrary and unjust pretensions, We assure you Sir! in the name of our Constituents, that whatever sacrifices and privations, it may be necessary to make, they will Chearfully Submit to them, in vindicating the rights of the American people, and the honor and independence of the Government and the Country!  
Convinced as we are that the Government of the United States, is too Generous and impartial to avail itself of the peculiar situation of any of the belligerant nations in demanding any concessions incompatible with the Just rights of these nations, or which are founded on any other basis than those of Justice and reciprocity.  
The Good People of Louisiana will at all times be ready to Cooperate with their fellow Citizens of the United States in the Support of their rights and independence against those, who have the temerity or injustice to assail them.  
We pray, Sir! that on your retiring from the high office, which you have filled with so much Credit to yourself and interest to the Country, you may long enjoy the esteem and gratitude of your fellow Citizens, the highest reward which a Virtuous Magistrate can desire, and which is, we are confident the only one you ever wished.
