r. Hancock’s ancient cellar and well.—To have and to hold all the foregoing tracts and parcels of land to the Inhabitants of the Town of Quincy, and their successors forever,  in their corporate capacities, Upon the Conditions following: First, Provided that plots be taken by skilful surveyors and recorded in the Town Books within a reasonable time.—Secondly, Provided that these lands shall be managed and conducted upon the same principles, under the same conditions, restrictions, limitations, forfeiture and supervisors, and the profits applied to the same ends and purposes with those in the former deed.—Thirdly, Provided that when the objects mentioned in the former deed are obtained a stoneschool house shall shall be erected over the cellar, which was under the House anciently built by the Revd. Mr. John Hancock, the father of John Hancock, that great, generous, disinterested, bountiful benefactor of his Country once President of Congress and afterwards Governor of this state, whose great exertions and unlimited sacrifices this nation is so deeply indebted for her Independance and present prosperity, who was born in this house, and which house was afterwards purchased and inhabited by the Revd. learned ingenious and eloquent Lemuel Bryant, Pastor of this Congregation, which house was afterwards purchased by and inhabited by an Honble. friend of my younger years, Colo. Josiah Quincy, and also inhabited by his son Josiah Quincy Junior, a friend of my riper years, a Brother Barrister at Law, with whom I have been engaged in many arduous contests at the Bar, who was as ardent a patriot as any of his age and next to James Otis the greatest Orator.—Fourthly, That as soon as the funds will be sufficient, a school master should be procured, learned in the greek, and roman languages, and if thought advisable, the Hebrew, not to make learned hebriaians, but to teach such young men as choose to learn it, the Hebrew Alpabet, the rudiments of the Hebrew Grammar, and the use of the Hebrew Grammer and Lexicon;—That in after life they may pursue the study to what extent they please; but I hope the future M will not think me too presumptuous if I advise them to begin their lessons—in Greek and Hebrew, by compelling their pupils to take their pens and write over and over again copies of the Greek and Hebrew Alphabets in all their Variety of Characters, over and over again until they are perfect masters of those Alphabets and Characters, this will be as good an exercise in chirography as they can use, and will stamp those Alphabets and characters upon their tender minds and vigorious memories so deeply that the impression will never wear out, and will enable them at any period of their future lives to study those languages to any extent with great ease
