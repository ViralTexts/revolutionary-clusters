When, on the 6th instant, I was answering yours of Dec. 29. I was so overwhelmed with letters to be answered, that I could not take time to notice the objection stated that ‘neither the people, nor their representatives, would agree to the plan of assessment on the wards for the expences of the ward-schools.’ I suppose that by this is meant the ‘pecuniary expence of wages to the tutor.’ for, as to what the people are to do, or to contribute in kind, every one who knows the situation of our people in the country, knows it will not be felt. the building the log houses will employ the laborers of the Ward 3. or 4. days in every 20. years. the contributions for subsistence, if averaged on the families would be 8. or 9. ℔ of pork, and half a bushel of corn for a family of midling circumstances, not more than 2. days subsistence of the family &amp; it’s stock, and less in proportion as it could spare less. there is not a  family in the country so poor as to feel this contribution. it must then be the assessment of the pecuniary contribution which is thought so formidable an addition to the property tax we now pay to the state that ‘neither the people, nor their representatives would agree to.’ now, let us look this objection in the face, &amp; bring it to the test unerring test of figures: premising that this pecuniary tax is to be of 150.D. on a ward.  
Not possessing the documents which would give me the numbers to be quoted, correctly to an unit, I shall use round numbers, so near the truth, that, with the further advantage of facilitating our calculations as we go along, they will make no sensible error in the result. I will proceed therefore on the following postulates, and on the ground that there are in the whole state 100. counties and cities.  
  
  
  
   
in the whole state  
in every county on an average  
  
  
the free white inhabitants of all ages &amp; sexes, at the last census were  
600,000  
   
6,000  
.  
  
  
the number of militia was somewhere about  
80,000  
   
800  
.  
  
  
the number of Captains companies, of 67. each would be about  
1,200  
   
12  
.  
  
  
free white inhabitants for every militia company 600,000/1200  
500  
   
500  
  
  
  
the tax on property paid to the state is nearly  
500,000  
   
5,000  
.  
  
  
Let us then proceed, on these data, to compare the expence of the proposed, and of the existing system of primary schools. I have always supposed that the wards should be so laid off as to comprehend the number of inhabitants necessary to furnish a Captain’s company of militia. this is before stated at 500. persons of all ages &amp; sexes. from the tables of mortality (Buffon’s) we find that where there are 500. persons of all ages and sexes, there will always be 14. in their 10th year, 13. &amp; a fraction in their 11th and 13. in their 12th year; so that the children of these 3. years (which are those that ought to be devoted to the elementary schools) will be a constant number of 40; about enough to occupy one teacher constantly. his wages of 150.D. partitioned on these 40. make their teaching cost 3.75 D apeice, annually. if we reckon as many heads of families in a ward as there are militia (as I think we may, the unmarried militia men balancing, in numbers, the married &amp; unmarried exempts) 150.D. on 67. heads of families (if levied equally) would be 2.24 D on each.  at the same time the property tax on the ward being 500012 D or 416 D, &amp; that again subdivided on 67. heads of families (if it were levied equally) would be 6.20 D on a family of midling circumstances, the state tax which it now pays to the state. so that to 6.20 D the present state tax, the school tax would add 2.24 D which is about .36 cents to the Dollar, or ⅓ to the present property tax: and to the whole state would be 150 D × 1200 wards, equal to 180,000. D of tax added to the present 500,000. D  
Now let us see what the present primary schools cost us, on the supposition that all the children of 10. 11. &amp; 12. years old are, as they ought to be, at school: and, if they are not, so much the worse is the system; for they will be untaught, and their ignorance &amp; vices will, in future life cost us much dearer in their consequences, than it would have done, in their correction, by a good education.  
I am here at a loss to say what is now paid to our English elementary schools, generally thro’ the state. in my own neighborhood, those who formerly recieved from 20/ to 30/ a scholar, now have from 20. to 30.D. and having no other information to go on, I must use my own numbers: the result of which however will be easily corrected, and accomodated to the average price thro’ the state, when ascertained; and will yet, I am persuaded, leave abundance of difference between the two systems.  
  
Taking a medium of 25.D. the 40. pupils in each ward now cost it 1000.D. a year, instead of 150. D or 15. D on a family, instead of 2.24 D: &amp; the 1200 wards cost to the whole state 1,200,000.D. of tax, in addition to the present 500,000 D. instead of 180,000.D. only; producing a difference of 1,020,000.D. in favor of the ward system; more than doubling the present tax, instead of adding ⅓ only. and should the price of tuition; which I have adopted from that in my own neighborhood, be much above the average thro the state, yet no probable correction will bring the two systems near a level.  
But take into consideration also the important difference that the 1,200,000.D. are now paid by the people, as a poll-tax, the poor having as many children as the rich, &amp; paying the whole tuition money themselves: whereas on the proposed ward-levies the poor man would pay in proportion to his hut and peculium only, while the rich would pay on their palaces &amp; principalities. it cannot then be that the ‘people’ will not agree to have their tuition tax lightened by levies on the ward, rather than of on themselves: and I as little believe that their ‘representatives’ will disagree to it; for even the rich will pay less than they now do. the portion of the 180,000.D. which, on the ward system, they will pay for the education of the poor, as well as of their own children, will not be as much as they now pay for their own alone.  
And will the wealthy individual have no retribution? and what will this be? 1. the peopling his neighborhood with honest useful and enlightened &amp; u citizens, understanding their own rights, &amp; firm in their perpetuation. 2. when his own descendants become poor, which they generally do within three generations (no law of primogeniture now perpetuating wealth in the same families) their children will be educated by the then rich; and the little advance he now makes to poverty, while rich himself, will be repaid by the then rich, to his descendants when become poor, and thus give them a chance of rising again. this is a solid consideration, and should go home to the bosom of every parent. this will be seed sowed in fertile ground. it is a provision for his family looking to distant times, &amp; far in duration beyond that he has now in hand for them. let every man count backwards in his own family, and see how many generations he can go, before he comes to the ancestor who made the fortune he now holds. most will be stopped at the 1st generation, many at the 2d few will reach the 3d and not one in the state go beyond the 5th  
I know that there is much prejudice, even among the body of the people, against the expence &amp; even the practicability of a sufficient establishment of elementary schools. but I think it proceeds from vague ideas on a subject they have never brought to the test of fact &amp; figures. but our representatives will fathom it’s depth, &amp; the people could &amp; would do the same, if the facts &amp; considerations belonging to the subject were presented to their minds, and their subsequent, as certainly as their previous approbation would be secured.  
But if the whole expence of the elementary schools, wages, subsistence &amp; buildings, are to come from the literary fund, the following amount will be requisite.  
  
  
  
  
  
D   
  
  
Wages.  
150.D.  
Deposit 2500.D.  for 1200. wards.  
3,000,000.  
  
  
Subsistence  
100.D.  
Deposit 1666⅔ D. × 1200  
2,000,000.  
  
  
Buildings. 2. rooms for the teacher &amp; 1. for the school, of brick, or scantling 1500. D  
1,800,000.  
  
  
  
  
  
6,800,000.  
  
  
If we are to wait until the literary fund shall be accumulated to this amount, we may justly fear that some one unlucky legislature will intervene within the time, change the whole appropriation to the lightening of taxes, and leave us where we now are.  
There is however an intermediate measure which might bring the two plans together. if the literary fund be of 1½ million of Dollars, take the half million for the Colleges &amp; University, it will establish them meagrely, and make a deposit of the remaining million. it’s interest of 60,000.D. will give 50.D. a year to each ward, towards the teacher’s wages, and reduce that tax to .24 instead of .36 cents to the dollar: and, as the literary fund continues to accumulate, give ⅓ of the increase to the Colleges &amp; University, and ⅔ to the ward-schools. the increasing interest of this last portion will be continually lessening the school tax, until it will extinguish it altogether; the subsistence &amp; buildings remaining always to be furnished by the ward in kind.  
Altho’A system of general instruction, which shall reach every description of our citizens, from the richest to the poorest, as it was the earliest, so will it be the latest, of all the public concerns in which I shall permit myself to take an interest. nor am I tenacious of the form in which it shall be introduced. be that what it may, our descendants will be as wise as we are, and will know how to amend &amp; amend it until it shall suit their circumstances. give it to us then in any shape, and recieve for the inestimable boon the blessings thanks of the young, and the blessings of the old, who are past all other services, but prayers for the  prosperity of their country &amp; blessings to those who promote it.

MontTiceEL1o, Jan. 14, 1818.  
Dear sIR,  
  
When on the 6th inst. I was answering yours of  
Dec. 29, I was so overwhelmed with letters to be  
answered, that 1 could not take time to notice the  
objection stated, “that it was apprehended that  
neither the people, nor their representatives, would  
agree to the plan of assessment on the wards for  
the expenses of the ward schools.” I suppose  
that by this is meant the “pecuniary expense of  
wages to the tutor;”’ for,as to what the people are  
to do, or to contribute in kind, every one who knows  
the situation of our people in the country, knows it  
will not be felt. ‘The building the long houses wiil  
employ the laborers of the ward three or four days  
in every 20 years. The contributions for subsis-  
tence, if averaged on the families, would be 8 or 9  
lbs. of pork, and half a bushel of corn for a family  
  
of middling circumstances—not more than two)  
  
day’s subsistence of the family and its stock—and  
less in proportion as it could spareless. There is  
not a family in the country so poor as to feel this  
contribution. It must then be the assessment of  
the pecuniary contribution which is thought so  
formidable an addition to the property tax we now  
pay to the state that “neither the people, nor their  
  
&#x27; representatives would agree to.” Now, let us look  
  
this objection in the face, and bring it to the uner-  
ring test of figures;—premising that this pecuniary  
tax is to be of 150 dollars on a ward.  
  
Not possessing the documents which would give  
me the numbers to be quoted, correctly to an unit,  
} shall use round numbers, so near the truth that,  
with the further advantage of facilitating our cal-  
culations as we go a long, they will make no sen-  
sible error in the result. I will proceed therefore  
on the following postulates, and on the ground  
that there are in the whole state 100 counties and  
cities.  
  
  
  
Inthe , In every  
whole jcounty on  
state. |anaverage  
  
  
  
The free white inhabitants of all ages andj.  
sexes, at the last census were - - - | 600,000 6,000  
The number of militia was  
somewhere about ee ae . 80,000 800  
The number of captain’s  
companies, of 67 each  
would be about or. et ieee 1,200 12  
Free white inhabitants for  
every militia company, 600,000:—1200 500 00  
The tax on property paid  
to the state is mearly- - - - 500,000 5,000  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Let us then proceed on these data, to compare the  
expense of the proposed and of the existing sys-  
tem of primary schools. I have always supposed  
that the wards should be laid off as to comprehend  
the number of inhabitants necessary to furnish a  
captain’s company of militia.—This is before stat-  
ed at 500 persons of all ages and sexes. From the  
tables of mortality (Buffon’s) we find that where  
there are 500 persons of all ages and sexes, there  
will always be 14 in their 10th year, 15 and a frac-  
tion in their 11th, and 13 in their 12th year; so that  
the children of these three years (which are those  
that ought{to be devoted to the elementary schools)  
will be a constant number of 40; about enough to  
occupy one teacher constantly. His wages of  
4150, partitioned on these 40, make their teach-  
ing cost $3 1-2 a-piece, annually. If we reckon  
  
as many heads of families in a ward as there are  
militia (as I think we may, the unmarried militia  
men balancinty, in numbers, the married and un-  
married exempts) $156 on 67 heads of families  
(if levied equally) would be $2 24 oneach. At  
the same time the property tax on the ward being  
$5000:—12, or $416, and that again subdivided on  
67 heads of families (if it were levied equally)  
would be $6 20 on a family of middling circum.  
stances, the tax which it now pays to the state. So  
that to $6 20, the present state tax, the school tax,  
would add $2 24, which is about 36 cents to the  
dollar, or one third to the present property tax:  
and to the whole state would be $150 x 1200 wards  
eqttal to $180,000 of tax added to the present  
$500,000.  
  
Now let us see what the present primary schools  
cost us, on the supposition that all the children of  
10, 11 and 12 years old are, as they ought to be, at  
school: and, if they are not, so much the worse is  
the system; for they will be untaugiht, and their  
ignorance and vices will, in future life cost us much  
dearer in their consequences, than it would have  
done, in their correction, by a good education.  
  
Iam here at aloss to say what is now paid to  
our English elementary schools, generally, through  
the state. In my own neighborhood, those who  
formerly received from 20s. to 30s. a scholar, now  
have from 20 to 30 dollars; and having no other in-  
formation to go on, I must use my own numbers,  
the result of which, however, will be easily cor-  
rected, and accommodated tothe average price  
through the state, when ascertained; and will yet,  
I am persuaded, leave abundance of difference be-  
tween the two systems.  
  
Taking a medium of $25, the 40 pupils in each  
ward now cost $1000 a year, instead of $150, or  
$15 ona family, instead of $2 24; and the 1200  
wards cost to the whole state $1,200,000 of tax,  
in addition the present $500,000, instead of 180,  
000 only; producing a difference of $1,020,000 in  
favor of the ward system, more than doubling the  
present tax, instead of adding one-third only; and  
should the price of tuition, which I have adopted  
from that in my own neighborhood, be much above  
the average thro’ the state, yet no probable cor-  
rection will bring the two systems near a level.  
  
But take into consideration, also, the important  
difference, that the $1,200,000 are now paid by the  
people, as a poll-tax, the poor having as many chil-  
dren as the rich, and paying the whole tuition mo-  
ney themselves; whereas, on the proposed ward  
levies the poor man would pay in proportion to his  
  
{hut and peculium only, while the rich would pay  
  
on their palaces and principalities. I+ cannot, then  
be that the people will not agree to have their tui-  
tion tax lightened by levies on the ward rather than  
on themselves; and I as little believe that their  
“representatives,” will disagree to it; for even the  
rich will pay less than they now do. The portion  
of the $180,000, which, on the ward system, they  
will pay for the education of the poor as well as of  
their own children, will not be as much as they  
now pay for their own alone.  
  
And will the wealthy individual have no retribu-  
tion? and what will this be? 1. The peopling his  
neighborhood with honest, useful and enlightened  
citizens, understanding their own rights and firm  
in their perpetuation. 2. When his own descen-  
dants become poor, which they generally do within  
three generations, (no law of primogeniture now  
perpetuating wealth in the same families,) their  
children will be educated by the then rich, and  
  
  
  
the little advance he now makes to poverty, while

his descendants when become poor, and thus give  
them a chance of rising again. This is a solid  
consideration, and should go home to the bosom  
of every parent. This will be seed sowed in fer-  
tile ground. It is a provision for his family looking  
+) distant times, and far in duration beyond that  
he has now in hand forthem. Let every man count  
backwards in his own family, and see how many  
generations he can go, before he comes to the an-  
cestor who made the fortune he now holds. Most  
will be stopped at the first generation, many at the  
2d, few will reach-the 3d, and not one in the state

There is, however, an intermediate measure jreserved only fourteen copies of the forty with

Give it to us, then in any shape, and receive for the  
inestimable boon the thanks of the young and the  
blessings of the old, who are past all other services  
but prayers for the prosperity of their country and  
blessings to those who promote it.

Montirello, Jan. 1J. lt&gt;18.  
UK \R siH,  
W hen, on the Gtb inst. I was answering  
yours of Dec. 2f&gt;, I was so overw&#x27;hclmed  
with letters to he answered, that I &lt; ouid nut  
take time to notice the *l»jcctinn staled,  
that* it was apprehend&#x27;d that neither the  
people, nor their representatives, would  
agree to the plan of assessment on the  
« ards for I he expenses ot the ward schools ’  
I suppose that by this is meant the* pe­  
cuniary expense of wages to the tutor;’  
lor, as lo what the people are to do, or to  
contribute in kind, t»\cry one who knows  
the situation of our people in the country,  
knows it will not be felt. The building  
the log houses will employ the lahorersot  
the ward three or four days in every 20  
vears. &#x27;Hie contributions for sole istence,  
il averaged on the families, would In* H or  
t&gt; lbs. of pork, and half a bushel of corn  
fora family of middling circumstances—  
not more than two days’ subsistence of  
the lamiU and its stork—and less in nm­  
  
portion as it could spare less. There is  
not a family in the country so poor as to  
feel this contribution, it must then be the  
assessment ot the pecuniary contribution  
which is thought so formidable au addi  
tion to tin-property tax \\e now pay to the  
state, that ‘neither the people, nor the&lt;r  
representatives would agree to.&#x27; Now,  
let us look this objection in the face, and  
bring it to the unerring test ot figures;—  
premising that this pecuniary tax is to i&lt;e  
ot 130 dollar on a ward.  
\ot possessing the documents which  
wotdd give me the numbers to be quoted,  
correctly to an unit, I shall use round  
numbers, so near the t.uth, that, with the  
further advantage of facilitating our cal­  
culations as we go along, they will make  
no sensible error in the result. I will  
proceed therefore on the following postu­  
lates, and on the ground that there are in  
the whole state tin) counties and cities.  
The free white inhabitants I ln lUe &#x27;• ,n &lt;‘Vfry  
&lt;&#x27;f»&quot; ages ami sexes, 1SSS5.  
the last census were-600,000 6,000  
The number of militia was  
somewhere about.80,000 800  
The number of captain’s  
companies, of 67 each,  
would be about.1,200 12  
Free white inhabitants for  
every militia company,  
600,00 I-t-1200.*.500 500  
The lax on property paid  
to the stale is nearly..500,00 6,000  
Let us then proceed, &lt;&gt;n these data, to  
compare the expense of the proposed, and  
ot the existing system of primary schools.  
1 have always supposed that the wards  
should be so laid olF as to comprehend  
the number of inhabitants necessary to  
furnish a captain’s company of iniiitia.  
&#x27;1 his i« before stated at 500 persons of all  
ages and sexes. From the tables of mor­  
tality (Buffon’s) we find that where then­  
are 500 persons of all ages and sexes,  
there will always be 14 in their loth year,  
13 and a fraction in their llili, and 1.1 in  
tlu-ir 12lh year ; so that the children of  
these three years (which are those that  
ought to be devoted to the elementary  
schools) w ill be a constant number of 40 ;  
about enough to occupy one teacher con­  
stantly. His wages of S 130, partitioned  
on these 40, make their i* aching cost  
H-HIPI&#x27;C I f ivu ru»Lr».a. n......  
  
heads of families in a ward as there are  
militia (as I think we may, the unmarried  
militia men balancing, in number*, the  
married and unmarried exempts) $ 150 op  
67 heads of families (if levied equally)  
would he S 2 24 on each. At the same  
time the property tax on the ward bring  
S5000-H2, or S416, and that again sub­  
divided on 67 heads of families (if if w« re  
levied equally) would be S6 20 on a fami­  
Iv of middling circumstances, the lax  
which it now pays to the state. So that  
to S6 20, the present state lax, the school  
tax would add S 2 24, which is about 36  
cents to the dollar, or one-third to the  
present property tax : and to the whole  
state would be8 150 x 1200 wards, equal  
to $ 180,000 of lax added to the present  
$ 500,000.  
Now let us see what the present prima­  
ry schools cost iis, on the supposition that  
all the children of 10, 11 and 12 years old  
are, as they ought to be at school: and,  
if they are not, so much the worse is flic  
system ; for they will he untaught, and  
llieir ignorance and vices will, in future  
lile, cost us much dearer in theirconse­  
qileiices, tiiau it would have dour, in the r  
correction, by a good education.  
I am here at a loss to say what is now  
paid to our Knglish elementary schools,  
generally through the state. In mv own  
neighborhood, those who formerly receiv­  
ed from 20*. to ;»0s. a scholar, now have  
from 20 to 30doliars; and having no other  
information to go on, | must use my own  
numbers : the result of which, however,  
will he easily corrected, and accommodat­  
ed to the average price through the state,  
when ascertained ; and will yet, l am per­  
suaded, leave abundance of difference  
between the two systems.  
Taking a medium of $26, the 40 pupils  
in each ward, now co*t SIOOO a year, in  
stead of $150, or $15 on a family, instead  
of $2 24 ; and tin* 1200 want* cosf lo the  
whole slate $1,200,000of lax, in addition  
to the present $500,000, mst ad of 180,00(1  
only ; producing a difference oi&#x27; $1,020,00(1  
in favor of the ward system, more th&lt;tn  
doubling the present tax, instead of add*  
ing one-third nnlv, and should tIk* prin  
of tuition, which I have adopted from lha!  
  
i iii tnv own neighborhood,bo tfmeh above  
the averagethro’ * lie stale, yet tin proha­  
» Me correction will bring tlie two system­  
near a level.  
But take into consMer;&#x27;t:.on, also, the  
important difference, that the Sl,*20&lt;\000  
are now paid by the people, as a poll-tax,  
the poor having as many children as the  
rich, and paying the whole tuition money  
j themselves ; whereas, on the proposed  
ward-levies the poor man would pay in  
proportion to Ins hut and p&lt;*&lt; nlium only,  
while the rich would pay on their palaces  
and principalities, it cannot, then, he  
that the ‘ people* will not agree to have  
their tuitiou lax lightened by levies on the  
ward, rather than on themselves; and I as  
litfl« believe that Ibrir ‘representatives/  
will disagree to it ; for even the rich will  
pay less than they now do. The portion  
ot the StHD.OOO, which, oil the ward ays­  
tein, they will pay for tin* education of  
the poor, as well asof tf***ir own children,  
will not (teas much as they now pay for  
their ow u alone.  
And w ill the wealthy indh idual have no  
retribution ? and wfial will this be? I.  
I he peopling bis neighborhood with ho  
nest, usetol ami ciiligh! I citizens, un­  
der-landing their own rig.its and tu rn in  
I heir perpetuation. 42. When his own de­  
scendants become poor,which they gene­  
rally do within three generations, (no law  
of primogeniture now perpetuating wealtli  
iu (tie same families,) ilieir children will  
tie educated by the then rich ; and the  
little advance he now makes to poverty,  
while rich himself, will be repaid bv the  
then rich, to his de-cemlants when be­  
come poor.aml thus gi\ef!ieni a chance of  
rising again. This is a solid considera­  
tion, and should go home iwthe bosom  
ot every parent. Tins will be seed sowed  
in fertile ground. It is a provi-*iort for his  
family looking to distant limes, and tar in  
duration beyond that he lias now in hand  
forthem. Letevery man count backwards  
in bis own family, and see how many ge­  
nerations he can go, before lie come, to  
tin* ancestor who made the fortune he now  
bolds. Most will be stopped at the lirst  
generation, many at tlu* *2 I, few will r aoh  
tlie 3d, an ’ not one in the state go beyond  
tip 6th.  
I know that there is mu h prejudice, e­  
ven among the body of the people, against  
the expence and even the practicability  
• if a sufficient establishment of elementa­  
ry schools, but I think it proceeds from  
vague ideas on a subject they have never  
broiiidit to tin* lest ot facts and fioures •  
  
but (»iir representative will fathom its  
depth, and the peeple could and would  
do the same, it the tacts and considera­  
tions belonging to the subject were pre­  
sented to their minds, and their subse­  
quent as certainly as their previous appro­  
bation, would be secured.  
But it the whole expeiu-e of the elemen­  
tary schools, wages, subsistence and  
buildings, are to come from the literary  
lund, and it wearetowait until that fund  
shall be accumulated lo the requisite a­  
mount, we may justly fearthat some one  
unlucky legislature will intervene within  
• he time, change the wind appropriation  
to the lightening ul taxes, and leave us  
where we now are.  
There is, however, an intermediate  
measure which miglil tiring the two  
plans together. 1» the literary fund he of  
one and a half million of dollars, take the  
halt-milliou for the colleges and universi­  
ty, it will establish them meagrely, and  
make a deposit of the remaining million.  
Its interest of $(&gt;0,000 will give Sod a year  
to each w ard, tow ards the teacher&#x27;s wages,  
and reduce that tax to 21 instead of JG  
cents to the dollar; and as the literary  
fund continues to accumulate, give one­  
third ot the increase to the colleges and  
university, ami two-thirds to the ward­  
schools. The increasing interest ol this  
last portion will be continually lessening  
tlie school-tax, until it will extinguish it  
altogether : the subsistence and build­  
ings remainingalways to be furnished by  
the ward in kind.  
A system of general instruction, which  
shall reach every description of onr citi­  
zens, from the richest to the poorest, as  
it was the earliest, so will it be the latest,  
of all the public concerns in which I shall  
permit myself to take an interest. Nor  
am I tVjiaciou* of the form in which it  
shall he introduced. Be that what it may,  
our descendants will be as wise as we are,  
and will know how to amend and amend  
it until it shall suit their circumstances.  
Give it to us, then,in any shape, and re­  
ceive for the inestimable boon the thanks  
of die young and the blessings of the old,  
w ho are past all otherservices but prayers  
for the prosperity of their country and  
blessings lo those who promote it.

would be S6 0 on a family of m  
dling circumstances, the tax which it  
pays to the state So that to g6 20.  
the present state tax, the school tax  
would add gl2 24, which is iibout 36  
cents to the dollar, or one-third to the  
present property tax : and to the  
whole state would be S 150 1200  
wards, equal to 3180,000 of tax ad­  
ded to the present 8500,000.  
Now let us see what the present  
primary schools cost us, on the suppo­  
sition that all the chihhvn of 10, 11  
and 12 years eld, are as thev oughtfto ;  
be at school : and, if they are not. so i  
much the worse 13 the system ; f r j  
they will be untaught, and their ignol-J  
ranee and vices will in future life,  
cost us much dearer in their conse- j  
queoces, than it would have done, in  
their correction, by a good education.  
I am here at a loss to say what is  
now paid to our English elementary  
schools, generally through the state.  
In niv own neighborhood, those who  
formerly received from 20s. to ;lcs. a  
sclndar, nw have from 20 to 50 dol­  
lars ; and having no other informa­  
tion to go on, I must use my own  
numbers : the result of which, howe­  
ver, will be easily cor reied, and ac­  
commodated to the average price thrt&#x27;  
the state, when ascertained ; and will  
yet, I am persuaded, leave abundance  
of dilleretice between the two svstems.  
Taking a medium of S25, to 40 pu­  
pils in each wad, now cost S10G0 a  
year, instead of S150, or S15 on a  
family, instead of g2 24 ; and the  
12 0 wards cost to the &quot; hole state  
gl,2CO,000 of tax, in addition to the  
present S5O0.000, instead of 180.000  
only ; producing a difference of gl,­  
020,000 in favtir of the ward system,  
no. e than doubling the present tax.  
instead of adrling one-third only, and  
should the price of tuition, which. I  
have adopted from that in my own  
neighborhood, be much above the ave  
rage through the state, yet no proba--I  
ble conectnm will bring Ihc two sys­  
tems near a level. v  
But take into consideration.&quot; also,  
the important diCerence, that the  
g 1,200 000 are now paid by the peo  
ple, ;&#x27;as a poll-tax, tlie poor bavin  
g as  
manv children as the rich, and paving

levies,  
the poor man -would pay in prcpoition  
to his hut and peculimn only, vvliilc  
the rich would pav on their nabi&#x27;-es  
j and principalities. It cannot, theo.be

But if the wholv expense of the i&#x27;e

There js. however, an intermediate  
measure vhic!i might bring the two  
plans together. It the l:terary to. d  
be of otie-atnl a. half million of Jtdlaot,  
take tlie half-million for the colb--M!  
laud university, it will establish ! th  
meageiiy, and make a deposit of e  
remaining million. Its interest, &quot;f  
S00,000 will give g50 a year to each  
ward, towards the teachei V waes,  
and .reduce -th.it tax to 24 insiead of  
56 cents to the dollar ; and as the lite­  
rary fund continues to accumulate,  
give one-third of the increase to the  
col!eg?sand university, and two thirds  
to the ward-schools. The increasing  
luieresioi inc iasi portion will De con­  
tinually lessening the school-tax, until  
it will extinguisSi it altogether; ths  
subsistence and buildings remainingal­
