I trusted to mr Dawson to have given you a full explanation verbally on a subject which I find he has but slightly mentioned to you. I shall therefore now do it.  When I returned from France, after an absence of 6. or 7. years, I was astonished at the change which I found had taken place in the US. in that time. no more like the same people; their notions, their habits &amp; manners, the course of their commerce, so totally changed that I, who stood in those of 1784. found myself not at all qualified to speak their sentiments, or forward their views in 1790. very soon therefore after entering on the office of Secy. of state I recommended to Genl. Washington to establish as a rule of practice that no person should be continued on a foreign mission beyond an absence of 6. 7. or 8. years. he approved it. on the only subsequent missions which took place in my time the persons appointed were notified that they would not be continued beyond that period. all returned within it except Humphreys. his term was not quite out when Genl. Washington went out of office. the succeeding administration had no rule for any thing. so he continued. immediately on my coming to the administration I wrote to him myself, reminded him of the rule I had communicated to him on his departure, that he had then been absent 11. years, and consequently must return. on this ground solely he was superceded. under these circumstances your appointment was impossible after an absence of 17. years. under any others, I should never fail to give to yourself &amp; the world proofs of my friendship for you, &amp; of my confidence in you. whenever you shall return, you will be sensible in a greater of what I was in a smaller degree, of the change in this nation from what it was when we both left it in 1784. we return like foreigners &amp; like them require a considerable residence here to become Americanized.  
The state of political opinion continues to return steadily towards republicanism. to judge from the Opposition papers, a stranger would suppose that a considerable check to it had been produced by certain removals of public officers. but this is not the case. all offices were in the hands of the Federalists. the injustice of having totally excluded Republicans was acknoleged by every man. to have removed one half &amp; to have placed republicans in their stead would have been rigorously just, when it was known that these composed a very great majority of the nation. yet such was their moderation in most of the states that they did not desire it. in these therefore no removals took place but for malversation. in the middle states the contention had been higher, spirits were more sharpened &amp; less accomodating. it was necessary in these to practice a different treatment, and to make a few changes to tranquilize the injured party. a few have been made there &amp; a very few still remain to be made. when this painful operation shall be over, I see nothing else ahead of us which can give uneasiness to any of our citizens or retard that consolidation of sentiment so essential to our happiness &amp; our strength. the tory papers will still find fault with every thing. but these papers are sinking daily from their dissonance with the sentiments of their subscribers, &amp; very few will shortly remain to keep up a solitary &amp; ineffectual barking.  
There is no point in which an American long absent from his country wanders so widely from it’s sentiments as on the subject of it’s foreign affairs. we have a perfect horror at every thing like connecting ourselves with the politics of Europe. it would indeed be advantageous to us to have neutral rights established on a broad ground; but no dependence can be placed in any European coalition for that. they have so many other bye-interests of greater weight, that some one or other will always be bought off. to be entangled with them would be a much greater evil than a temporary acquiescence in the false principles which have prevailed. peace is our most important interest, and a recovery from debt. we feel ourselves strong, &amp; daily growing stronger. the census just now concluded shews we have added to our population a third of what it was 10. years ago. this will be a duplication in 23. or 24. years. if we can delay but for a few years the necessity of vindicating the laws of nature on the ocean, we shall be the more sure of doing it with effect. the day is within my time as well as yours when we may say by what laws other nations shall treat us on the sea. and we will say it. in the mean time we wish to let every treaty we have drop off, without renewal. we call in our diplomatic missions, barely keeping up those to the most important nations.

I trusted to Mr. Dawson to give you a full explana­  
tion, verbally, on a subject which I find he has  
but slightly mentioned to you. I shall, therefore,  
now do it. When I returned from France, after  
an absence of six or seven years, I was astonished  
at the change which I found bad taken place in the  
United States in that time. No more like the  
same people ; their notions, their habits, and man­  
ners, the course of their commerce, so totally  
changed, that I, who stood in those of 1784, found  
myself uot at all qualified to speak their sentiments,  
or forward their views in 1700. Very soon, there­  
fore, after entering on the office of Secretary of  
State, I recommended to General Washington to  
establish as a rule of practice, that no peraon should  
be continued on foreign mission beyond aa absence  
of six, seven, or eight years. He approved it. On  
the only subsequent missions which took placo in  
my time, the persons appointed were notified that  
they could not be continued beyond that period.  
All returned within it excopt Humphreys. His term  
was not quite out when General Washington went  
out of office. The suoceeding administration had  
no rule for anything; so he continued.  
&quot; Immediately on my coming to the administra­  
tion, 1 wrote to him myself, reminded him of the  
rule I had communicated to him on his depaiture ;  
that he had then been absent about eleven years,  
and consequently must return. On this ground I  
solely he was superseded. Under these circum­  
stances, your appointment was impossible, after an  
absence of seventeen years. Under any others, I  
should never fail to give to yourself and the world  
proofs of my friendship for you, and of my confi­  
dence in you. Whenever you shall return, you  
will be sensible in a greater, of what I was in a  
smaller degree, of the change in this nation from  
what it was when &quot;we both left it in 1784. We re­  
turn like foreigners, and, like them, require a cou­  
! siderablu residence here to become Amerioaniiod

“There is no point in which an  
American, long absent from his country,  
wanders so widely from its sentiments  
as on the subject of its foreign affairs.  
We have a perfect horror of every thing  
like connecting ourselves with the po-  
litics of Europe. It would, indeed, be  
advantageous to us to have neutral rights  
established on a broad ground ; but no  
dependence can be placed in any Eu-  
ropean coalition for that. They have  
so many other by-interests of greater  
weight, that some one or other will al-  
ways be bought off. Zo be entangled  
with them would be a much greater evil  
than a temporary acquiescence in the false  
principles which have prevailed. Peace is  
our important interest, and a recovery  
from debt. We feel ourselves strong  
  
and daily growing stronger. The census  
just now coneluded, shows us to have  
added to our population a third of what  
  
it was ten years ago. This will be a  
duplication in twenty-three or twenty-  
four years. If we can delay but for a few  
years the necessity of vindicating the laws  
of nations on the ocean, we shall be the more  
sure of doing it with effect. The day is  
within my time as well as yours, when we  
may say by what laws other nations shall  
treat us on the sea, AND WE WILL SAY  
tr. In the meantime, we wish to let  
every treaty we have drop off without  
renewal. We call in our diplomatic  
missions, barely keeping up those to the  
most important nations.”
