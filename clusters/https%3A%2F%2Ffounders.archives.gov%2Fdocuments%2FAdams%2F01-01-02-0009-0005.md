Braintree Decr. 18th. 1765. Wednesday.  
  
  
How great is my Loss, in neglecting to keep a regular Journal, through the last Spring, Summer, and Fall. In the Course of my Business, as a Surveyor of High-Ways, as one of the Committee, for dividing, planning, and selling the North-Commons, in the Course of my two great Journeys to Pounalborough and Marthas Vineyard, and in several smaller Journeys to Plymouth, Taunton and Boston, I had many fine Opportunities and Materials for Speculation.—The Year 1765 has been the most remarkable Year of my Life. That enormous Engine, fabricated by the british Parliament, for battering down all the Rights and Liberties of America, I mean the Stamp Act, has raised and spread, thro the whole Continent, a Spirit that will be recorded to our Honour, with all future Generations. In every Colony, from Georgia to New-Hampshire inclusively, the Stamp Distributors and Inspectors have been compelled, by the unconquerable Rage of the People, to renounce their offices. Such and so universal has been the Resentment of the People, that every Man who has dared to speak in favour of the Stamps, or to soften the detestation in which they are held, how great soever his Abilities and Virtues had been esteemed before, or whatever his fortune, Connections and Influence had been, has been seen to sink into universal Contempt and Ignominy.  
The People, even to the lowest Ranks, have become more attentive to their Liberties, more inquisitive about them, and more determined to defend them, than they were ever before known or had occasion to be. Innumerable have been the Monuments of Wit, Humour, Sense, Learning, Spirit, Patriotism, and Heroism, erected in the several Colonies and Provinces, in the Course of this Year. Our Presses have groaned, our Pulpits have thundered, our Legislatures have resolved, our Towns have voted, The Crown Officers have every where trembled, and all their little Tools and Creatures, been afraid to Speak and ashamed to be seen.  
This Spirit however has not yet been sufficient to banish, from Persons in Authority, that Timidity, which they have discovered from the Beginning. The executive Courts have not yet dared to adjudge the Stamp-Act void nor to proceed with Business as usual, tho it should seem that Necessity alone would be sufficient to justify Business, at present, tho the Act should be allowed to be obligatory. The Stamps are in the Castle. Mr. Oliver has no Commission. The Governor has no Authority to distribute, or even to unpack the Bales, the Act has never been proclaimed nor read in the Province; Yet the Probate office is shut, the Custom House is shut, the Courts of Justice are shut, and all Business seems at a Stand. Yesterday and the day before, the two last days of Service for January Term, only one Man asked me for a Writ, and he was soon determined to waive his Request. I have not drawn a Writ since 1st. Novr.  
How long We are to remain in this languid Condition, this passive Obedience to the Stamp Act, is not certain. But such a Pause cannot be lasting. Debtors grow insolent. Creditors grow angry. And it is to be expected that the Public offices will very soon be forced open, unless such favourable Accounts should be received from England, as to draw away the Fears of the Great, or unless a greater Dread of the Multitude should drive away the Fear of Censure from G. Britain.  
It is my Opinion that by this Timorous Inactivity we discover Cowardice, and too much Respect and Regard to the Act. This Rest appears to be by Implication at least an Acknowledgement of the Authority of Parliament to tax Us. And if this Authority is once acknowledged and established, the Ruin of America will become inevitable.  
This long Interval of Indolence and Idleness will make a large Chasm in my affairs if it should not reduce me to Distress and incapacitate me to answer the Demands upon me. But I must endeavour in some degree to compensate the Disadvantage, by posting my Books, reducing my Accounts into better order, and by diminishing my Expences, but above all by improving the Leisure of this Winter, in a diligent Application to my Studies. I find that Idleness lies between Business and Study, i.e. The Transision from the Hurry of a multiplicity of Business, to the Tranquility that is necessary for intense Study, is not easy. There must be a Vacation, an Interval between them, for the Mind to recollect itself.  
The Bar seem to me to behave like a Flock of shot Pidgeons. They seem to be stopped, the Net seems to be thrown over them, and they have scarcely Courage left to flounce and to flutter. So sudden an Interruption in my Career, is very unfortunate for me. I was but just getting into my Geers, just getting under Sail, and an Embargo is laid upon the Ship. Thirty Years of my Life are passed in Preparation for Business. I have had Poverty to struggle with—Envy and Jealousy and Malice of Enemies to encounter—no Friends, or but few to assist me, so that I have groped in dark Obscurity, till of late, and had but just become known, and gained a small degree of Reputation, when this execrable Project was set on foot for my Ruin as well as that of America in General, and of Great Britain.

 December.  
  
  
At Home, with my family. Thinking.  
  
  
  
1765. December. 23d. Monday  
  
  
Went to Boston. After Dinner rambled after Messrs. Gridley and Otis but could find neither. Went into Mr. Dudleys, Mr. Dana’s, Mr. Otis’s office, and then to Mr. Adams’s and went with him to the Monday night Clubb. There I found Otis, Cushing Wells, Pemberton, Gray, Austin, two Waldo’s, Inches, Dr. Parker—And spent the Evening very agreably, indeed. Politicians all at this Clubb. We had many curious Anecdotes, about Governors, Councillors, Representatives, Demagogues, Merchants &amp;c. The Behaviour of these Gentlemen is very familiar and friendly to each other, and very polite and complaisant to Strangers. Gray has a very tender Mind, is extreamly timid—he says when he meets a Man of the other Side he talks against him, when he meets a Man of our Side he opposes him, so that he fears, he shall be thought against every Body, and so every Body will be against him. But he hopes to prepare the Way for his Escape at next May from an Employment, that neither his Abilities, nor Circumstances nor turn of Mind, are fit for.  
Cushing is steady and constant, and busy in the Interest of Liberty and the Opposition, is famed for Secrisy, and his Talent at procuring Intelligence.  
Adams is zealous, ardent and keen in the Cause, is always for Softness, and Delicacy, and Prudence where they will do, but is stanch and stiff and strict and rigid and inflexible, in the Cause.  
Otis is fiery and fev’rous. His Imagination flames, his Passions blaze. He is liable to great Inequalities of Temper—sometimes in Despondency, sometimes in a Rage. The Rashnesses and Imprudences, into which his Excess of Zeal have formerly transported him, have made him Enemies, whose malicious watch over him, occasion more Caution, and more Cunning and more inexplicable Passages in his Conduct than formerly. And perhaps Views at the Chair, or the Board, or possibly more expanded Views, beyond the Atlantic, may mingle now with his Patriotism.  
The II Penseroso, however, is discernible on the Faces of all four.  
Adams I believe has the most thourough Understanding of Liberty, and her Resources, in the Temper and Character of the People, tho not in the Law and Constitution, as well as the most habitual, radical Love of it, of any of them—as well as the most correct, genteel and artful Pen. He is a Man of refined Policy, stedfast Integrity, exquisite Humanity, genteel Erudition, obliging, engaging Manners, real as well as professed Piety, and a universal good Character, unless it should be admitted that he is too attentive to the Public and not enough so, to himself and his family.  
The Gentlemen were warm to have the Courts opened. Gridley had advised to wait for a Judicial Opinion of the Judges. I was for requesting of the Governor that the general Court might assemble at the Time to which they stood prorogued—and if the Town should think fit to request the Extrajudicial Opinion of the Judges. I was for petitioning the Governor and Council to determine the Question first as Supreme ordinary. Gridley will be absent, and so shall I. But I think the apparent Impatience of the Town must produce some spirited Measures, perhaps more spirited than prudent.

. Every Writ supposes the King present in all his Courts of Justice.  
Ld. Coke says, Against this ancient and fundamental Law, and in the face thereof, I find an Act of Parliament made, that As well Justices of Assize as Justices of Peace, without any finding or Present­ment by the verdict of 12 Men, upon a bare Information for the King before them made, should have full Power and Authority, by their Discretions, to hear and determine all offences and Contempts, vs. the form, ordinance and Effect of any statute by Colour of which Act shaking this Fundamental Law, it is not credible what horrible Oppressions and Exactions were committed by Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. And upon this unjust and injurious Act a new Office was created, and they made Masters of the Kings Forfeitures. But at the Parliament 1 H. 8. this Act II H. 7. is recited, made void and repealed. The fearful End of these two Oppressors, should deter others from committing the like, and admonish Parliaments, that instead of this ordinary and precious Tryal Per Legem Terrae, they bring not in absolute and partial Tryals by Discretion.

Went to Weymouth with my Wife. Dined at Father Smiths. Heard much of the Uneasiness among the People of Hingham, at a sermon preached by Mr. Gay, on the Day of Thanksgiving, from a Text in James, “Out of the same Mouth proceedeth Blessing and Cursing,” in which he said that the ancient Weapons of the Church, were Prayers and Tears, not Clubbs, and inculcated Submission to Authority, in pretty strong Expressions. His People said that Mr. Gay would do very well for a Distributor, and they believed he had the Stamps in his House, and even threatned &amp;c. This Uneasiness it seems was inflamed by a sermon preached there the sunday after by Mr. Smith, which they admired very much, and talk of printing as the best sermon, they ever heard him preach. This sermon of Mr. Smiths was from “render therefore to Caesar, the Things that are Caesars and unto God the Things that are Gods.” The Tenor of it was to recommend Honour, Reward, and Obedience to good Rulers; and a Spirited Opposition to bad ones, interspersed with a good deal of animated Declamation upon Liberty and the Times.  
It seems there is a Clubb, consisting of Coll. Lincoln, the two Captain Barkers, one of them an half Pay Officer, Coll. Thaxter &amp;c. who visit the Parson (Gay) every Sunday Evening, and this Clubb is wholly inclined to Passive Obedience—as the best Way to procure Redress. A very absurd Sentiment indeed! We have tryed Prayers and Tears, and humble Begging and timid tame submission as long as trying is good—and instead of Redress we have only increased our Burdens and aggravated our Condemnation.

THE STAMP ACT.  
&quot;How long- wc-arc to remain in this languid condition,  
tliifl passive obedience to tin- stamp act, is  
not certain. But such a pause cannot be lasting.  
Debtors grow insolent; creditors grow angry; and  
it is to be expected that the public offices&#x27;will very  
soon be forced to open, unless such favorable accounts  
should be received from Kngland aa to drive  
away the fears of the great, or unless a greater  
dread of the multitude snould drive away the fear  
of censure front Great Britain. ?  
&quot;It is my opinion that by this inactivity we discover  
cowardice, ami too much respect to the act.  
This rest appears to ho, by implication at least, an  
acknowledgment of the authority of Parliament to  
tax us. And if this authority is once acknowledged  
and established, the ruin of America u ill become  
inevitable. This long interval of indolence and  
idleness will make a targe chasm in my alfairs, it  
it should not reduce me to distress, and incapacitate  
me tu answer the demands upon me. liut 1  
must endeavor, in some degree, to compensate the  
Jisadvantage, by |K&gt;sting my tiook*, reducing my  
iccount* into Initter, and by diminishing my ex  
lenses?hilt, above all, by improving the leisure  
&gt;f this winter in a diligent application to iny  
itudics.  
&quot;The bar seems to me to behave like a flock of i  
ihot pigeons; they serin to be stopped; the net seems  
a lie thrown over them, and uicy have scarcely

condition, this passive obedience to the stamp  
: act, is not certain. But such a pause cannot  
he lasting. Debtors grow insolent: creditors  
grow angry; and it is to he expected that the  
public offices will very soon be forced to open,  
unless such favorable accounts should be le­  
ceived lrom England as to drive away the fears  
1 of the great, or unless a greater dread of the  
multitude should drive away the fear of ceil*  
I sure fioin Great Britain.  
“It is my opinion that hy tins inactivity we  
-discover cowardice, and too much lespcct to  
the act. The rest appears to be, hy implication  
at least, an acknowledgement of the authority  
is once acknowledged and established, the ruin  
of Ameiica will become inevitable. I Ins long  
interval of indolence and idleness will make a  
large chasm in my affairs, if it should not re­  
duce me to distress, and incapacitate me to an­  
swer the demands upon me. But 1 must en­  
deavor in some degree to compensate the disad­  
vantage. bv posting my books, reducing my ac­  
counts to better order, and by diminishing my  
expenses—but, above all. by impiovmg the lei­  
sure of this winter in a diligent application to  
my studies.  
“The bar seems to me to behave like a flock  
of shot pigeons: they seeir: to be stopped; the net  
seems to be thrown over them, and they have  
scarcely courage left to flounce and to flutter.  
So sudden an interrupt on in my career is very­  
unfortunate for me I was but just getting in­  
to mv gears, just gelling under sail, and an em­  
bargo is laid upon the ship. I flirty years ot  
my life are passed in preparation lor business.  
I have had poverty to struggle with, envy and  
jealousy and malice of enemies to encounter,  
no friends, or but few, assist me: so that 1  
have groped in dark obscurity, till of late, and  
had but |ust become known and gained a small  
degree of reputation, when this execiable pro­  
ject was set on foot for my ruin as well as that  
of America in general, and ot Great Britain.

Dec. 23, Monday. Went to Boston. After  
dinner rambled after Messrs. Gridley and Otis,  
but could find neither. Went into&#x27;Mr. Dud­  
lex&#x27;s, Mr. Danna&#x27;s, Mr. Otis&#x27;s office, and then  
to&#x27;Mr. Adam&#x27;s, and went with hun to the Mon­  
day night club. There 1 found Otis, Cushing,  
Wells, Pemberton, Gray, Austin, two Waldos,  
Inches. Dr. Paiker, and spent the evening very  
agreeably indeed. Politicians all at this club.  
We had many curious a^ecifctes about Gover­  
nors, counsellors, representatives, demagogues,  
merchants, &amp;c.  
••The behaviour of these gentlemen is very  
familiar and friendly to each other, and very  
polite and complaisant to strangers. Gray has  
a very tender mind, is extremely timid. He  
says, where he meets a man of the other side  
he talks against him —where he meets a man of  
our side, he opposes him—so that he fears he  
.-hall be thought against every body and so  
every body will be against him. But he hopes  
to prepare tlie way for his escape, at next May,  
from an employment that neither his abilities,  
nor circumstances, nor turn ot mind are lit for. ,  
“Cushing is steady, and constant, and busy  
in the interest of liberty and the opposition is  
tamed for secrecy and his talent in procuring  
intelligence.  
“Adams [Samuel] is zealous, ardent, and  
keen in the cause, is always for softness and  
delicacy, and prudence, where they will do, ;  
but is staunch, and stiffi and strict, and rigid, [  
and inflexible in the cause.  
“Otis is fiery and feverous; his imagination  
flames, his passions blaze—he is liable to great  
inequalities of temper—sometimes in despon­  
dency, sometimes in a rage. The rashness and  
imprudences into winch his excess of zeal  
have formerly transported him. have made him  
enemies, whose malicious watch over him oc­  
casion more caution and more inexplicable  
passages in his conduct than formerly—and,  
perhaps, views at the chair or board, or possi­  
bly more expanded views beyond the Atlantic,  
  
may mingle now with ms patriotism.  
“The II Penseroso, however, is disceniable  
on the faces of all four.  
“Adams, I believe, has the most thorough un­  
derstanding of liberty and her resources, in the  
temper and character of the people—though  
not in the law and const tution—as well as the  
most habitual, radical love of it. of any of them  
as well as the most correct genteel, and artful  
pen. He is a man of refined policy steadfast  
integrity, exquisite humanity, geentel erudi­  
tion. obliging, engaging manners, real as w ell as  
professed pietv, and a universal good character,  
unless it should be admitted that he is too ac­

“The year 1765 has been the most remarkable year of my  
life. ‘That enormous engine, fabricated by the British Parliament,  
for battering down all the rights and liberties of America, I mean  
the Stamp Act, has raised and spread through the whole conti-  
nent a spirit that will be recorded to our honor with all future  
generations. In every colony, from Georgia to New Hampshire  
inclusively, the stamp distributers and inspectors have been com-  
pelled by the unconquerable rage of the people to renounce their  
offices. Such and so universal has been the resentment of the  
people, that every man who has dared to speak in favor of the  
stamps, or to soften the detestation in which they are held, how  
great soever his abilities and virtues iiad been esteemed before,

been seen to sink into universal contempt and ignominy.  
  
‘** The people, even to the lowest ranks, have become more atten-

determined to defend them, than they were ever before known  
or had occasion to be; innumerable have been the monuments  
of wit, humor, sense, learning, spirit, patriotism, and heroism,  
erected in the several colonies and provinces in the course of

tools and creatures been afraid to speak and ashamed to be  
seen.  
  
*¢ This spirit, however, has not yet been sufficient to banish from  
persons in authority that timidity which they have discovered  
from the beginning. ‘The executive courts have not yet dared to  
adjudge the Stamp Act void, nor to proceed with business as  
usual, though it should seem that necessity alone would be suffi-  
cient to justify business at present, though the act should be  
allowed to be obligatory. The stamps are in the castle. Mr.  
Oliver has no commission. ‘The Governor has no authority to  
distribute or even to unpack the bales; the Act has never been  
proclaimed nor read in the Province ; yet the probate office is  
shut, the custom-house is shut, the courts of justice are shut, and  
all business seems at a stand. Yesterday and the day before, the  
two last days of service for January Term, only one man asked  
me for a writ, and he was soon determined to wave his request.  
[ have not drawn a writ since the first of November.  
  
‘¢ How long we are to remain in this languid condition, this  
passive obedience to the Stamp Act, is not certain. But sucha  
pause cannot be lasting. Debtors grow insolent; creditors grow  
angry ; and it is to be expected that the public offices will very  
soon be forced open, unless such favorable accounts should be  
received from England as to draw away the fears of the great,  
or unless a greater dread of the multitude should drive away the  
fear of censure from Great Britain.”

Cushing, Samuel Adams, and Otis, are admirably sketched.  
A few master touches are enough to give us a discriminating  
acquaintance with them.  
  
“Gray has a very tender mind, is extremely timid. He says  
when he meets a man of the other side, he talks against him ;  
when he meets a man of our side, he opposes him; so that he  
fears he shall be thought against everybody, and so everybody  
will be against him. But he hopes to prepare the way for his  
escape, at next May, from an employment that neither his abili-  
ties, nor circumstances, nor turn of mind, are fit for.

times in despondency, sometimes in a rage. The rashnesses and  
imprudencies into which his excess of zeal have formerly trans-  
ported him, have made him enemies, whose malicious watch over  
him occasions more caution, and more cunning, and more inexpli-

unconquerable rage of the people to re­

versal has been the resentment of the  
people, that every man who has dared to  
speak in favor of the stamps or to soften  
the detestation in which they are held,  
how ureat soever his abilities and vir­  
tues had been esteemed before, or what­  
ever his fortune, connections, and in­  
fluence had been, has been seen to sink  
into universal contempt and ignominy.  
The people, even to the lowest ranks,  
have become more attentive to their lib­  
eflicirmmore determined to defend them, than  
they were ever before known or had oc­  
casion to be ; innumerable have been  
the monuments of wit, humor, sense,  
learning, spirit, patriotism, and heroism,  
erected in the several colonies and prov­  
inces in the course of this year. Out  
presses have groaned, our pulpits have  
thundered, our legislatures have re­  
solved, our townshave voted ; the crown  
officers have everywhere trembled, and  
all their little tools and creatures been  
afraid to speak and ashamed to be seen.
