The University of Virginia.The period for opening this institution being ultimately fixed to the 1st day of Feb. next, some previous information respecting it may be acceptable to the public, and useful to individuals who may have views of availing themselves of it’s benefits. and our press being on the spot, as it were, it seems incumbent on us particularly to give that information, which we shall do from the best sources accessible to us,  and such we believe as are to be relied on. one hundred and nine dormitories are in readiness, sufficient each for two students, for their  lodging and studies. six Hotels are provided, which will be  rented to respectable housekeepers, who will furnish the ordinary meals to such students as chuse to engage with them respectively, not exceeding 50. in a mess. with this article the University will have no concern, except to restrain excesses of the table. in addition to these accomodations provided at the University, the town of Charlottesville, one mile distant, can lodge and board between one and two hundred students. the Professors will be in place in the course of the autumn, and in time to prepare themselves for the commencement of their duties, at the opening of the institution. all students who propose to enter for the year ensuing, will be expected to attend on the 1st day of Feb. that the schools and classes may commence together.There will be 8. schools in the University. 1. one of antient languages, antient history, antient geography and Belles lettres. 2. one of Modern languages, modern history, and modern geography. 3. others of Mathematics, 4. of Natural philosophy, 5. of Natural history, 6. of anatomy and medecine, 7. or Moral philosophy.  8. of Law, government and Political economy. every student will be free to attend whichever of the schools he considers as adapted to his future pursuits, and required to attend no others. to enter that of antient languages, he must be already able to read with ease their higher authors. for the schools of Mathematics &amp; natural philosophy, he must be a proficient in numerical arithmetic. for the others nothing preparatory will be required, except that into no school can any one be admitted under 16. years of age.It is expected that the whole annual expence of a student, will be about 200.D. exclusive of clothes and pocket money, and that the latter article  shall be kept within very moderate limits. a general notice of all these particulars will be authoritatively published in autumn, before which no engagements will be made for either Hotels or dormitories. all applications are then to be addressed to the Proctor of the university, mr Arthur S.

University of Virginia.—The visitors of this Institution, have despatched  
an agent to Europe, to engage professors in those departments, which it is  
thought, cannot be so well filled in this country. It is said that the profes-  
sorhips of Law, Politics, Morals, and Physic, are to be occupied by Ameri-  
cans. The time selected for the opening of the University, is February Ist,  
1825.  
  
The Gazette published at Charlottesville, says, that there will be eight  
Schools in the University. 1. One of Ancient Languages, Ancient History,  
and Ancient Geography, and Belles Lettres. 2. Modern Languages, Modern  
History and Modern Geography. 3. Others of Mathematics. 4. Of Natural  
Philosophy. 5. Of Natural History. 6. Of Anatomy and Medicine. 7. Of  
Moral Philosophy. 8. Of Law, Government and Political Economy.  
  
Each student will be free to attend whichever of the schools he considers  
as adapted to his future pursuits, and required to attend no others. To enter  
that of Ancient Languages, he must be able to read with ease their higher au-  
thors. For the schools of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, he must be  
a proficient in Numerical Arithmetic. For the others nothing preparatory  
will be required, except that into no school can any one be admitted, under  
sixteen years of age

being on the spot, as it were, it seems  
incumben on us particularly to give  
that information, which we ahall do  
from the best sources accessible to us.  
and aecii, we believe, as are to be relied

ries are in readiness, sufficient each for  
two student*, for their lodging and etu  
dies. Six hotels are provided, which  
will bo rented to respectable house­  
keepers, who will furnish the ordinary  
n.eals to such students as choose to en­  
gage with them respectively, not ex­  
ceeding fifty in a mess. With this ar*  
tide the University will have no con­  
cern, except to restrain excesses of the  
table. In addition to these accommo­  
dations, provided at the University, the  
town of Charlotsville, one mile distant,  
can lodge and board between one and  
two hundred stodents. The Professors  
will be in place in the course of the au­  
tumn,-&gt;nd in nme to prepare themselves  
for the commencement of their duties,  
at the opening of the institution. All  
students who propose to enter for the  
year ensuing, will be expected to at­  
tend on the first day of February, that  
the schools »;id classes may commence

Every student will be free lo attend  
whichever of the schools he considers

already be able to read with ease their

Mathematics and Natural Philosophy,  
he must be a proficient in numerical a­  
rithmetie. For the others, nothing  
preparatory will be required; except  
that into no school can any one be ad­

It is expected that the whole annua)  
expense of a student, will be about  
$200, *-xclu*ive of clothes and pocket  
money, and that the latter article will  
be kept within very moderate limits.—  
A general nonce of all these particulars

ticularly to give that information, which  
we shall do lrom the best sources accessi­

be relied on. One hundred and nine dor­  
mitories are in readiness, sufficient each  
for two students, for their lodging and  
studies. Six hotels are provided, which  
will be rented to respectable housekeepers,  
who will furnish the ordinary meals to such  
students as choose to engage with them  
respectively, not exceeding fifty in a mess.  
—With this article the University will  
have no concern, except to restrain exces­  
ses of the table. In addition t &gt; these ac­  
commodations, provided at the University,  
the town of Charlottesville, one mile dis­  
tant, can lodge and board between one  
and two hundred students. The profes­  
sors will be in place in the course of the  
autumn, and in time to prepare themselves  
for the commencement of their duties, at  
the opening of the institution. All stu­  
dents who propose to enter for the year  
ensuing, will be expected to attend on the  
first day ui February, that the schools and  
classes may commence together.  
There will be eight schools in the Bni­  
versity. t. One of Ancient Languages,  
Ancient History, Ancient Geography and  
belles Lettres. One of Modern Lan­  
guages, modern History, and Modern Ge­  
ography.— i. Others of Mathematics.

7. Of Moral Philosophy. 8. Of Law, Gov­  
ernment and Political Economy.  
Every student will be free to attend  
whichever of the schools he considers as  
adapted to Ins future pursuits, and requi­  
red tu attend no others. To enter that of  
Ancient Languages, he must already he  
able to read with ease their higlier au  
thors. For the schools of Mathematics  
and Natural Philosophy, he must be a pro­  
ficient m numeral aiithmetic. For the o­  
thers, nothing preparatory will be requi­  
red, except that into no school can any  
one he admitted under sixteen years of  
  
it is expected that the whole annual ex­  
pense ol a student, will be about two hun­  
dred dollars, exclusive of dollies and pock­  
et money, and that the latter article will  
be kept within very moderate limits. A  
general notice of all these paiticulars will  
be authoritatively published in Autumn,  
before which no engagements will be made  
for either Hotels or Dormitories. All ap­  
plicatio is are then to be addressed to the  
Proctor of the University, Arthurs. Biuck­  
eubrough, Esq. who alone will answer let­  
ters on these subjects. We regret to add  
that tlie liberal donation of fifty thousand  
dollars, made by the late Legislature, for  
the purchase of a Library and Apparatus,  
rested on a contingency which fads, and  
that the institution will he opened under  
this disadvantage

tics, Morals, and Physic, are to be occupi-  
ed by Americans. ‘Lhe time selected for  
opening the University, is February Ist,  
1825.  
  
The Gazette published at Charlotte-  
  
ville, says, that there will be eight schools  
in the University. 1. One of Ancient  
Languages, Ancient History, Ancient  
Geography, and Belles Lettres. 2. Mod-  
ern Languages, Modern History, and
