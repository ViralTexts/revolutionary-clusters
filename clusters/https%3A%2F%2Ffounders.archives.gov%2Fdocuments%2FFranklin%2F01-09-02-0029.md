The Interest OF Great Britain With Regard to her Colonies.  
I have perused with no small pleasure the Letter addressed to Two Great Men, and the Remarks on that letter. It is not merely from the beauty, the force and perspicuity of expression, or the general elegance of manner conspicuous in both pamphlets, that my pleasure chiefly arises; it is rather from this, that I have lived to see subjects of the greatest importance to this nation publickly discussed without party views, or party heat, with decency and politeness, and with no other warmth than what a zeal for the honour and happiness of our king and country may inspire; and this by writers whose understanding (however they may differ from each other) appears not unequal to their candour and the uprightness of their intention.  
But, as great abilities have not always the best information, there are, I apprehend, in the Remarks some opinions not well founded, and some mistakes of so important a nature, as to render a few observations on them necessary for the better information of the publick.  
The author of the Letter, who must be every way best able to support his own sentiments, will, I hope, excuse me, if I seem officiously to interfere; when he considers, that the spirit of patriotism, like other qualities good and bad, is catching; and that his long silence since the Remarks appeared has made us despair of seeing the subject farther discussed by his masterly hand. The ingenious and candid remarker, too, who must have been misled himself before he employed his skill and address to mislead others, will certainly, since he declares he aims at no seduction,  
*Remarks, p. 6.  
be disposed to excuse even the weakest effort to prevent it.  
And surely if the general opinions that possess the minds of the people may possibly be of consequence in publick affairs, it must be fit to set those opinions right. If there is danger, as the remarker supposes, that “extravagant expectations” may embarass “a virtuous and able ministry,” and “render the negotiation for peace a work of infinite difficulty;”  
†Remarks, p. 7.  
there is no less danger that expectations too low, thro’ want of proper information, may have a contrary effect, may make even a virtuous and able ministry less anxious, and less attentive to the obtaining points, in which the honour and interest of the nation are essentially concerned; and the people less hearty in supporting such a ministry and its measures.  
The people of this nation are indeed respectable, not for their numbers only, but for their understanding and their publick spirit: they manifest the first, by their universal approbation of the late prudent and vigorous measures, and the confidence they so justly repose in a wise and good prince, and an honest and able administration; the latter they have demonstrated by the immense supplies granted in parliament unanimously, and paid through the whole kingdom with chearfulness. And since to this spirit and these supplies our “victories and successes”  
‡Remarks, p. 7.  
have in great measure been owing, is it quite right, is it generous to say, with the remarker, that the people “had no share in acquiring them?” The mere mob he cannot mean, even where he speaks of the madness of the people; for the madness of the mob must be too feeble and impotent, arm’d as the government of this country at present is, to “over-rule,”   
§Remarks, p. 7.  
even in the slightest instances, the “virtue and moderation” of a firm and steady ministry.  
While the war continues, its final event is quite uncertain. The Victorious of this year may be the Vanquish’d of the next. It may therefore be too early to say, what advantages we ought absolutely to insist on, and make the sine quibus non of a peace. If the necessity of our affairs should oblige us to accept of terms less advantageous than our present successes seem to promise us, an intelligent people as ours is, must see that necessity, and will acquiesce. But as a peace, when it is made, may be made hastily; and as the unhappy continuance of the war affords us time to consider, among several advantages gain’d or to be gain’d, which of them may be most for our interest to retain, if some and not all may possibly be retained; I do not blame the public disquisition of these points, as premature or useless. Light often arises from a collision of opinions, as fire from flint and steel; and if we can obtain the benefit of the light, without danger from the heat sometimes produc’d by controversy, why should we discourage it?  
Supposing then, that heaven may still continue to bless his Majesty’s arms, and that the event of this just war may put it in our power to retain some of our conquests at the making of a peace; let us consider whether we are to confine ourselves to those possessions only that were “the objects for which we began the war.”  
*Remarks, p. 19.  
This the remarker seems to think right, when the question relates to ‘Canada, properly so called,’ it having never been ‘mentioned as one of those objects in any of our memorials or declarations, or in any national or public act whatsoever.’ But the gentleman himself will probably agree, that if the cession of Canada would be a real advantage to us, we may demand it under his second head, as an “indemnification for the charges incurred” in recovering our just rights; otherwise according to his own principles the demand of Guadaloupe can have no foundation.  
That “our claims before the war were large enough for possession and for security too,”  
†Ibid.  
tho’ it seems a clear point with the ingenious remarker, is, I own, not so with me. I am rather of the contrary opinion, and shall presently give my reasons. But first let me observe, that we did not make those claims because they were large enough for security, but because we could rightfully claim no more. Advantages gain’d in the course of this war, may increase the extent of our rights. Our claims before the war contain’d some security; but that is no reason why we should neglect acquiring more when the demand of more is become reasonable. It may be reasonable in the case of America to ask for the security recommended by the author of the letter, tho’  
‡P. 30 of the Letter, and p. 21 of the Remarks.  
it would be preposterous to do it in many other cases: his propos’d demand is founded on the little value of Canada to the French; the right we have to ask, and the power we may have to insist on an indemnification for our expences; the difficulty the French themselves will be under of restraining their restless subjects in America from encroaching on our limits and disturbing our trade; and the difficulty on our parts of preventing encroachments that may possibly exist many years without coming to our knowledge. But the remarker “does not see why the arguments employ’d concerning a security for a peaceable behaviour in Canada, would not be equally cogent for calling for the same security in Europe.”  
*Remarks, p. 24.  
On a little farther reflection, he must I think be sensible, that the circumstances of the two cases are widely different. Here we are separated by the best and clearest of boundaries, the ocean, and we have people in or near every part of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon us, by building a fort, even in the obscurest corner of these islands, must therefore be known and prevented immediately. The aggressors also must be known, and the nation they belong to would be accountable for their aggression. In America it is quite otherwise. A vast wilderness thinly or scarce at all peopled, conceals with ease the march of troops and workmen. Important passes may be seiz’d within our limits and forts built in a month, at a small expence, that may cost us an age, and a million to remove. Dear experience has taught us this. But what is still worse, the wide extended forests between our settlements and theirs, are inhabited by barbarous tribes of savages that delight in war and take pride in murder, subjects properly neither of the French nor English, but strongly attach’d to the former by the art and indefatigable industry of priests, similarity of superstitions, and frequent family alliances. These are easily, and have been continually, instigated to fall upon and massacre our planters, even in times of full peace between the two crowns, to the certain diminution of our people and the contraction of our settlements.  
  
†A very intelligent writer of that country, Dr. Clark, in his Observations on the late and present Conduct of the French, &amp;c. printed at Boston 1755, says,  
  
  
  
  
‘The Indians in the French interest are, upon all proper opportunities, instigated by their priests, who have generally the chief management of their public councils, to acts of hostility against the English, even in time of profound peace between the two crowns. Of this there are many undeniable instances: The war between the Indians and the colonies of the Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire, in 1723, by which those colonies suffered so much damage, was begun by the instigation of the French; their supplies were from them, and there are now original letters of several Jesuits to be produced, whereby it evidently appears, that they were continually animating the Indians, when almost tired with the war, to a farther prosecution of it. The French not only excited the Indians, and supported them, but joined their own forces with them in all the late hostilities that have been committed within his Majesty’s province of Nova Scotia. And from an intercepted letter this year from the Jesuit at Penobscot, and from other information, it is certain that they have been using their utmost endeavours to excite the Indians to new acts of hostility against his Majesty’s colony of the Massachusetts Bay, and some have been committed. The French not only excite the Indians to acts of hostility, but reward them for it, by buying the English prisoners of them; for the ransom of each of which they afterwards demand of us the price that is usually given for a slave in these colonies. They do this under the specious pretence of rescuing the poor prisoners from the cruelties and barbarities of the savages; but in reality to encourage them to continue their depredations, as they can by this means get more by hunting the English than by hunting wild-beasts; and the French at the same time are thereby enabled to keep up a large body of Indians entirely at the expence of the English.’  
  
And tho’ it is known they are supply’d by the French and carry their prisoners to them, we can by complaining obtain no redress, as the governors of Canada have a ready excuse, that the Indians are an independent people, over whom they have no power, and for whose actions they are therefore not accountable. Surely circumstances so widely different, may reasonably authorise different demands of security in America, from such as are usual or necessary in Europe.  
The remarker, however, thinks, that our real dependance for keeping “France or any other nation true to her engagements, must not be in demanding securities which no nation whilst independent can give, but on our own strength and our own vigilance.”  
*Remarks, p. 25.  
No nation that has carried on a war with disadvantage, and is unable to continue it, can be said, under such circumstances, to be independent; and while either side thinks itself in a condition to demand an indemnification, there is no man in his senses, but will, caeteris paribus prefer an indemnification that is a cheaper and more effectual security than any other he can think of. Nations in this situation demand and cede countries by almost every treaty of peace that is made. The French part of the island of St. Christophers was added to Great Britain in circumstances altogether similar to those in which a few months may probably place the country of Canada. Farther security has always been deemed a motive with a conqueror to be less moderate; and even the vanquish’d insist upon security as a reason for demanding what they acknowledge they could not otherwise properly ask. The security of the frontier of France on the side of the Netherlands, was always considered, in the negotiation that began at Gertruydenburgh, and ended with that war. For the same reason they demanded and had Cape Breton. But a war concluded to the advantage of France has always added something to the power, either of France or the house of Bourbon. Even that of 1733, which she commenced with declarations of her having no ambitious views, and which finished by a treaty at which the ministers of France repeatedly declared that she desired nothing for herself, in effect gained for her Lorrain, an indemnification ten times the value of all her North American possessions.  
  
In short, security and quiet of princes and states have ever been deemed sufficient reasons, when supported by power, for disposing of rights; and such disposition has never been looked on as want of moderation. It has always been the foundation of the most general treaties. The security of Germany was the argument for yielding considerable possessions there to the Swedes: and the security of Europe divided the Spanish monarchy, by the partition treaty, made between powers who had no other right to dispose of any part of it. There can be no cession that is not supposed at least, to increase the power of the party to whom it is made. It is enough that he has a right to ask it, and that he does it not merely to serve the purposes of a dangerous ambition. Canada in the hands of Britain, will endanger the kingdom of France as little as any other cession; and from its situation and circumstances cannot be hurtful to any other state. Rather, if peace be an advantage, this cession may be such to all Europe. The present war teaches us, that disputes arising in America, may be an occasion of embroiling nations who have no concerns there. If the French remain in Canada and Louisiana, fix the boundaries as you will between us and them, we must border on each other for more than 1500 miles. The people that inhabit the frontiers, are generally the refuse of both nations, often of the worst morals and the least discretion, remote from the eye, the prudence, and the restraint of government. Injuries are therefore frequently, in some part or other of so long a frontier, committed on both sides, resentment provoked, the colonies first engaged, and then the mother countries. And two great nations can scarce be at war in Europe, but some other prince or state thinks it a convenient opportunity, to revive some ancient claim, seize some advantage, obtain some territory, or enlarge some power at the expence of a neighbour. The flames of war once kindled, often spread far and wide, and the mischief is infinite. Happy it prov’d to both nations, that the Dutch were prevailed on finally to cede the New Netherlands (now the province of New York) to us at the peace of 1674; a peace that has ever since continued between us, but must have been frequently disturbed, if they had retained the possession of that country, bordering several hundred miles on our colonies of Pensilvania westward, Connecticut and the Massachusetts eastward. Nor is it to be wondred at that people of different language, religion, and manners, should in those remote parts engage in frequent quarrels, when we find, that even the people of our own colonies have frequently been so exasperated against each other in their disputes about boundaries, as to proceed to open violence and bloodshed.  
But the remarker thinks we shall be sufficiently secure in America, if we “raise English forts at such passes as may at once make us respectable to the French and to the Indian nations.”  
*Remarks, p. 25.  
The security desirable in America, may be considered as of three kinds; 1. A security of possession, that the French shall not drive us out of the country. 2. A security of our planters from the inroads of savages, and the murders committed by them. 3. A security that the British nation shall not be oblig’d on every new war to repeat the immense expence occasion’d by this, to defend its possessions in America. Forts in the most important passes, may, I acknowledge be of use to obtain the first kind of security: but as those situations are far advanc’d beyond the inhabitants, the expence of maintaining and supplying the garrisons, will be very great even in time of full peace, and immense on every interruption of it; as it is easy for skulking parties of the enemy in such long roads thro’ the woods, to intercept and cut off our convoys, unless guarded continually by great bodies of men. The second kind of security, will not be obtained by such forts, unless they were connected by a wall like that of China, from one end of our settlements to the other. If the Indians when at war, march’d like the Europeans, with great armies, heavy cannon, baggage and carriages, the passes thro’ which alone such armies could penetrate our country or receive their supplies, being secur’d, all might be sufficiently secure; but the case is widely different. They go to war, as they call it, in small parties, from fifty men down to five. Their hunting life has made them acquainted with the whole country, and scarce any part of it is impracticable to such a party. They can travel thro’ the woods even by night, and know how to conceal their tracks. They pass easily between your forts undiscover’d; and privately approach the settlements of your frontier inhabitants. They need no convoys of provisions to follow them; for whether they are shifting from place to place in the woods, or lying in wait for an opportunity to strike a blow, every thicket and every stream furnishes so small a number with sufficient subsistence. When they have surpriz’d separately, and murder’d and scalp’d a dozen families, they are gone with inconceivable expedition thro’ unknown ways, and ’tis very rare that pursuers have any chance of coming up with them.  
  
*‘Although the Indians live scattered, as a hunter’s life requires, they may be collected together from almost any distance, as they can find their subsistence from their gun in their travelling. But let the number of the Indians be what it will, they are not formidable merely on account of their numbers; there are many other circumstances that give them a great advantage over the English. The English inhabitants, though numerous, are extended over a large tract of land, 500 leagues in length on the sea-shore; and although some of their trading towns are thick settled, their settlements in the country towns must be at a distance from each other: besides, that in a new country where lands are cheap, people are fond of acquiring large tracts to themselves; and therefore in the out settlements, they must be more remote: and as the people that move out are generally poor, they sit down either where they can easiest procure land, or soonest raise a subsistence. Add to this, that the English have fixed settled habitations, the easiest and shortest passages to which the Indians, by constantly hunting in the woods, are perfectly well acquainted with; whereas the English know little or nothing of the Indian country nor of the passages thro’ the woods that lead to it. The Indian way of making war is by sudden attacks upon exposed places; and as soon as they have done mischief, they retire and either go home by the same or some different rout, as they think safest; or go to some other place at a distance to renew their stroke. If a sufficient party should happily be ready to pursue them, it is a great chance, whether in a country consisting of woods and swamps which the English are not acquainted with, the enemy do not lie in ambush for them in some convenient place, and from thence destroy them. If this should not be the case, but the English should pursue them, as soon as they have gained the rivers, by means of their canoes, to the use of which they are brought up from their infancy, they presently get out of their reach: further, if a body of men were to march into their country to the places where they are settled, they can, upon the least notice, without great disadvantage, quit their present habitations, and betake themselves to new ones.’ Clark’s Observations, p. 13.  
  
  
  
  
‘It has been already remarked, that the tribes of the Indians living upon the lakes and rivers that run upon the back of the English settlements in North America, are very numerous, and can furnish a great number of fighting men, all perfectly well acquainted with the use of arms as soon as capable of carrying them, as they get the whole of their subsistence from hunting; and that this army, large as it may be, can be maintained by the French without any expence. From their numbers, their situation, and the rivers that run into the English settlements, it is easy to conceive that they can at any time make an attack upon, and constantly annoy as many of the exposed English settlements as they please, and those at any distance from each other. The effects of such incursions have been too severely felt by many of the British colonies, not to be very well known. The entire breaking up places that had been for a considerable time settled at a great expence, both of labour and money; burning the houses, destroying the stock, killing and making prisoners great numbers of the inhabitants, with all the cruel usage they meet with in their captivity, is only a part of the scene. All other places that are exposed are kept in continual terror; the lands lie waste and uncultivated from the danger that attends those that shall presume to work upon them: besides the immense charge the governments must be at in a very ineffectual manner to defend their extended frontiers; and all this from the influence the French have had over, but comparatively, a few of the Indians. To the same or greater evils still will every one of the colonies be exposed, whenever the same influence shall be extended to the whole body of them.’ Ibid, p. 20.  
  
In short, long experience has taught our planters, that they cannot rely upon forts as a security against Indians: The inhabitants of Hackney might as well rely upon the tower of London to secure them against highwaymen and housebreakers. As to the third kind of security, that we shall not in a few years, have all we have now done to do over again in America; and be oblig’d to employ the same number of troops, and ships, at the same immense expence to defend our possessions there, while we are in proportion weaken’d here: such forts I think cannot prevent this. During a peace, it is not to be doubted the French, who are adroit at fortifying, will likewise erect forts in the most advantageous places of the country we leave them, which will make it more difficult than ever to be reduc’d in case of another war. We know by the experience of this war, how extremely difficult it is to march an army thro’ the American woods, with its necessary cannon and stores, sufficient to reduce a very slight fort. The accounts at the treasury will tell you what amazing sums we have necessarily spent in the expeditions against two very trifling forts, Duquesne and Crown Point. While the French retain their influence over the Indians, they can easily keep our long extended frontier in continual alarm, by a very few of those people; and with a small number of regulars and militia, in such a country, we find they can keep an army of ours in full employ for several years. We therefore shall not need to be told by our colonies, that if we leave Canada, however circumscrib’d, to the French, “we have done nothing;”  
*Remarks, p. 26.  
we shall soon be made sensible ourselves of this truth, and to our cost.  
I would not be understood to deny that even if we subdue and retain Canada, some few forts may be of use to secure the goods of the traders, and protect the commerce, in case of any sudden misunderstanding with any tribe of Indians: but these forts will be best under the care of the colonies interested in the Indian trade, and garrison’d by their provincial forces, and at their own expence. Their own interest will then induce the American governments to take care of such forts in proportion to their importance; and see that the officers keep their corps full and mind their duty. But any troops of ours plac’d there and accountable here, would, in such remote and obscure places and at so great a distance from the eye and inspection of superiors, soon become of little consequence, even tho’ the French were left in possession of Canada. If the four independent companies maintained by the Crown in New York more than forty years, at a great expence, consisted, for most part of the time, of faggots chiefly; if their officers enjoy’d their places as sine cures, and were only, as a writer   
*Douglass.  
of that country stiles them, a kind of military monks; if this was the state of troops posted in a populous country, where the imposition could not be so well conceal’d; what may we expect will be the case of those that shall be posted two, three or four hundred miles from the inhabitants, in such obscure and remote places as Crown Point, Oswego, Duquesne, or Niagara? they would scarce be even faggots; they would dwindle to meer names upon paper, and appear no where but upon the muster rolls.  
Now all the kinds of security we have mention’d are obtain’d by subduing and retaining Canada. Our present possessions in America, are secur’d; our planters will no longer be massacred by the Indians, who depending absolutely on us for what are now become the necessaries of life to them, guns, powder, hatchets, knives, and cloathing; and having no other Europeans near, that can either supply them, or instigate them against us; there is no doubt of their being always dispos’d, if we treat them with common justice, to live in perpetual peace with us. And with regard to France, she cannot in case of another war, put us to the immense expence of defending that long extended frontier; we shall then, as it were, have our backs against a wall in America, the sea-coast will be easily protected by our superior naval power; and here “our own watchfulness and our own strength” will be properly, and cannot but be successfully employed. In this situation the force now employ’d in that part of the world, may be spar’d for any other service here or elsewhere; so that both the offensive and defensive strength of the British empire on the whole will be greatly increased.  
But to leave the French in possession of Canada when it is in our power to remove them, and depend, as the remarker proposes, on our own “strength and watchfulness”  
*P. 25.  
to prevent the mischiefs that may attend it, seems neither safe nor prudent. Happy as we now are, under the best of kings, and in the prospect of a succession promising every felicity a nation was ever bless’d with: happy too in the wisdom and vigour of every part of the administration, particularly that part whose peculiar province is the British plantations, a province every true Englishman sees with pleasure under the principal direction of a nobleman, as much distinguish’d by his great capacity, as by his unwearied and disinterested application to this important department; we cannot, we ought not to promise ourselves the uninterrupted continuance of those blessings. The safety of a considerable part of the state, and the interest of the whole are not to be trusted to the wisdom and vigor of future administrations, when a security is to be had more effectual, more constant, and much less expensive. They who can be moved by the apprehension of dangers so remote as that of the future independence of our colonies (a point I shall hereafter consider) seem scarcely consistent with themselves when they suppose we may rely on the wisdom and vigour of an administration for their safety.  
I should indeed think it less material whether Canada were ceded to us or not, if I had in view only the security of possession in our colonies. I entirely agree with the Remarker, that we are in North America “a far greater continental as well as naval power;” and that only cowardice or ignorance can subject our colonies there to a French conquest. But for the same reason I disagree with him widely upon another point. I do not think that our “blood and treasure has been expended,” as he intimates, “in the cause of the colonies,” and that we are “making conquests for them:”  
*Remarks, p. 26.  
yet I believe this is too common an error. I do not say they are altogether unconcerned in the event. The inhabitants of them are, in common with the other subjects of Great Britain, anxious for the glory of her crown, the extent of her power and commerce, the welfare and future repose of the whole British people. They could not therefore but take a large share in the affronts offered to Britain, and have been animated with a truely British spirit to exert themselves beyond their strength, and against their evident interest. Yet so unfortunate have they been, that their virtue has made against them; for upon no better foundation than this, have they been supposed the authors of a war carried on for their advantage only. It is a great mistake to imagine that the American country in question between Great Britain and France, is claimed as the property of any individuals or publick body in America, or that the possession of it by Great Britain, is likely, in any lucrative view, to redound at all to the advantage of any person there. On the other hand, the bulk of the inhabitants of North America are land-owners, whose lands are inferior in value to those of Britain, only by the want of an equal number of people. It is true the accession of the large territory claimed before the war began, especially if that be secured by the possession of Canada, will tend to the increase of the British subjects faster than if they had been confin’d within the mountains: yet the increase within the mountains only, would evidently make the comparative population equal to that of Great Britain much sooner than it can be expected when our people are spread over a country six times as large. I think this is the only point of light in which this question is to be viewed, and is the only one in which any of the colonies are concerned. No colony, no possessor of lands in any colony, therefore wishes for conquests, or can be benefited by them, otherwise than as they may be a means of securing peace on their borders. No considerable advantage has resulted to the colonies by the conquests of this war, or can result from confirming them by the peace, but what they must enjoy in common with the rest of the British people; with this evident drawback from their share of these advantages, that they will necessarily lessen, or at least prevent the increase of the value of what makes the principal part of their private property. A people spread thro’ the whole tract of country on this side the Mississipi, and secured by Canada in our hands, would probably for some centuries find employment in agriculture, and thereby free us at home effectually from our fears of American manufactures. Unprejudic’d men well know that all the penal and prohibitory laws that ever were thought on, will not be sufficient to prevent manufactures in a country whose inhabitants surpass the number that can subsist by the husbandry of it. That this will be the case in America soon, if our people remain confined within the mountains, and almost as soon should it be unsafe for them to live beyond, tho’ the country be ceded to us, no man acquainted with political and commercial history can doubt. Manufactures are founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor without land in a country, and who must work for others at low wages or starve, that enables undertakers to carry on a manufacture, and afford it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the same kind from abroad, and to bear the expence of its own exportation. But no man who can have a piece of land of his own, sufficient by his labour to subsist his family in plenty, is poor enough to be a manufacturer and work for a master. Hence while there is land enough in America for our people, there can never be manufactures to any amount or value. It is a striking observation of a very able pen, that the natural livelihood of the thin inhabitants of a forest country, is hunting; that of a greater number, pasturage; that of a middling population, agriculture; and that of the greatest, manufactures; which last must subsist the bulk of the people in a full country, or they must be subsisted by charity, or perish. The extended population, therefore, that is most advantageous to Great Britain, will be best effected, because only effectually secur’d by our possession of Canada. So far as the being of our present colonies in North America is concerned, I think indeed with the remarker, that the French there are not “an enemy to be apprehended,”  
*Remarks, p. 27.  
but the expression is too vague to be applicable to the present, or indeed to any other case. Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, unequal as they are to this nation in power and numbers of people, are enemies to be still apprehended; and the Highlanders of Scotland have been so for many ages by the greatest princes of Scotland and Britain. The wild Irish were able to give a great deal of disturbance even to Queen Elizabeth, and cost her more blood and treasure than her war with Spain. Canada in the hands of France has always stinted the growth of our colonies: In the course of this war, and indeed before it, has disturb’d and vex’d even the best and strongest of them, has found means to murder thousands of their people and unsettle a great part of their country. Much more able will it be to starve the growth of an infant settlement. Canada has also found means to make this nation spend two or three millions a year in America; and a people, how small soever, that in their present situation, can do this as often as we have a war with them, is methinks, “an enemy to be apprehended.”  
Our North American colonies are to be considered as the frontier of the British empire on that side. The frontier of any dominion being attack’d, it becomes not merely “the cause” of the people immediately affected, (the inhabitants of that frontier) but properly “the cause” of the whole body. Where the frontier people owe and pay obedience, there they have a right to look for protection. No political proposition is better established than this. It is therefore invidious to represent the “blood and treasure” spent in this war, as spent in “the cause of the colonies” only, and that they are “absurd and ungrateful” if they think we have done nothing unless we “make conquests for them,” and reduce Canada to gratify their “vain ambition,” &amp;c. It will not be a conquest for them, nor gratify any vain ambition of theirs. It will be a conquest for the whole, and all our people will, in the increase of trade and the ease of taxes, find the advantage of it. Should we be obliged at any time to make a war for the protection of our commerce, and to secure the exportation of our manufactures, would it be fair to represent such a war merely as blood and treasure spent in the cause of the weavers of Yorkshire, Norwich, or the West, the cutlers of Sheffield, or the button-makers of Birmingham? I hope it will appear before I end these sheets, that if ever there was a national war, this is truly such a one: a war in which the interest of the whole nation is directly and fundamentally concerned.  
Those who would be thought deeply skilled in human nature, affect to discover self-interested views every where at the bottom of the fairest, the most generous conduct. Suspicions and charges of this kind, meet with ready reception and belief in the minds even of the multitude; and therefore less acuteness and address than the remarker is possessed of, would be sufficient to persuade the nation generally, that all the zeal and spirit manifested and exerted by the colonies in this war, was only in “their own cause” to “make conquests for themselves,” to engage us to make more for them, to gratify their own “vain ambition.” But should they now humbly address the mother country in the terms and the sentiments of the remarker, return her their grateful acknowledgments for the blood and treasure she had spent in “their cause,” confess that enough had been done “for them;” allow that “English forts raised in proper passes, will, with the wisdom and vigour of her administration” be a sufficient future protection; express their desires that their people may be confined within the mountains, lest if they are suffered to spread and extend themselves in the fertile and pleasant country on the other side, they should “increase infinitely from all causes,” “live wholly on their own labour” and become independent; beg therefore that the French may be suffered to remain in possession of Canada, as their neighbourhood may be useful to prevent our increase; and the removing them may “in its consequences be even dangerous.”  
*Remarks, p. 50, 51.  
I say, should such an address from the colonies make its appearance here, though, according to the remarker, it would be a most just and reasonable one; would it not, might it not with more justice be answered; We understand you, gentlemen, perfectly well: you have only your own interest in view: you want to have the people confined within your present limits, that in a few years the lands you are possessed of may increase tenfold in value! you want to reduce the price of labour by increasing numbers on the same territory, that you may be able to set up manufactures and vie with your mother country! you would have your people kept in a body, that you may be more able to dispute the commands of the crown, and obtain an independency. You would have the French left in Canada, to exercise your military virtue, and make you a warlike people, that you may have more confidence to embark in schemes of disobedience, and greater ability to support them! You have tasted too, the sweets of TWO or THREE MILLIONS Sterling per annum spent among you by our fleets and forces, and you are unwilling to be without a pretence for kindling up another war, and thereby occasioning a repetition of the same delightful doses! But gentlemen, allow us to understand our interest a little likewise: we shall remove the French from Canada that you may live in peace, and we be no more drained by your quarrels. You shall have land enough to cultivate, that you may have neither necessity nor inclination to go into manufactures, and we will manufacture for you and govern you.  
A reader of the remarks may be apt to say; if this writer would have us restore Canada on principles of moderation, how can we consistent with those principles, retain Guadaloup, which he represents of so much greater value! I will endeavour to explain this, because by doing it I shall have an opportunity of showing the truth and good sense of the answer to the interested application I have just supposed. The author then is only apparently and not really inconsistent with himself. If we can obtain the credit of moderation by restoring Canada, it is well: but we should, however, restore it at all events; because it would not only be of no use to us, but “the possession of it (in his opinion) may in its consequence be dangerous.”  
*Remarks, p. 50, 51.  
As how? Why, plainly, (at length it comes out) if the French are not left there to check the growth of our colonies, “they will extend themselves almost without bounds into the in-land parts, and increase infinitely from all causes; becoming a numerous, hardy, independent people, possessed of a strong country, communicating little or not at all with England, living wholly on their own labour, and in process of time knowing little and enquiring little about the mother country.” In short, according to this writer, our present colonies are large enough and numerous enough, and the French ought to be left in North America to prevent their increase, lest they become not only useless but dangerous to Britain.  
I agree with the gentleman, that with Canada in our possession, our people in America will increase amazingly. I know, that their common rate of increase, where they are not molested by the enemy, is doubling their numbers every twenty five years by natural generation only, exclusive of the accession of foreigners.  
†The reason of this greater increase in America than in Europe, is, that in old settled countries, all trades, farms, offices, and employments are full, and many people refrain marrying till they see an opening, in which they can settle themselves, with a reasonable prospect of maintaining a family: but in America, it being easy to obtain land which with moderate labour will afford subsistence and something to spare, people marry more readily and earlier in life, whence arises a numerous offspring and the swift population of those countries. ’Tis a common error that we cannot fill our provinces or increase the number of them, without draining this nation of its people. The increment alone of our present colonies is sufficient for both those purposes.  
I think this increase continuing, would probably in a century more, make the number of British subjects on that side the water more numerous than they now are on this; but I am far from entertaining on that account, any fears of their becoming either useless or dangerous to us; and I look on those fears, to be merely imaginary and without any probable foundation. The remarker is reserv’d in giving his reasons, as in his opinion this “is not a fit subject for discussion.” I shall give mine, because I conceive it a subject necessary to be discuss’d; and the rather, as those fears how groundless and chimerical soever, may by possessing the multitude, possibly induce the ablest ministry to conform to them against their own judgment, and thereby prevent the assuring to the British name and nation a stability and permanency that no man acquainted with history durst have hoped for, ’till our American possessions opened the pleasing prospect.  
The remarker thinks that our people in America, “finding no check from Canada would extend themselves almost without bounds into the inland parts, and increase infinitely from all causes.” The very reason he assigns for their so extending, and which is indeed the true one, their being “invited to it by the pleasantness, fertility and plenty of the country,” may satisfy us, that this extension will continue to proceed as long as there remains any pleasant fertile country within their reach. And if we even suppose them confin’d by the waters of the Mississipi westward, and by those of St. Laurence and the lakes to the northward, yet still we shall leave them room enough to increase even in the sparse manner of settling now practis’d there, till they amount to perhaps a hundred millions of souls. This must take some centuries to fulfil, and in the mean time, this nation must necessarily supply them with the manufactures they consume, because the new settlers will be employ’d in agriculture, and the new settlements will so continually draw off the spare hands from the old, that our present colonies will not, during the period we have mention’d find themselves in a condition to manufacture even for their own inhabitants, to any considerable degree, much less for those who are settling behind them. Thus our trade must, till that country becomes as fully peopled as England, that is for centuries to come, be continually increasing, and with it our naval power; because the ocean is between us and them, and our ships and seamen must increase as that trade increases.  
The human body and the political differ in this, that the first is limited by nature to a certain stature, which, when attain’d, it cannot, ordinarily, exceed; the other by better government and more prudent police, as well as by change of manners and other circumstances, often takes fresh starts of growth, after being long at a stand; and may add tenfold to the dimensions it had for ages been confined to. The mother being of full stature, is in a few years equal’d by a growing daughter: but in the case of a mother country and her colonies, it is quite different. The growth of the children tends to encrease the growth of the mother, and so the difference and superiority is longer preserv’d.  
Were the inhabitants of this island limited to their present number by any thing in nature, or by unchangeable circumstances, the equality of population between the two countries might indeed sooner come to pass: but sure experience in those parts of the island where manufactures have been introduc’d, teaches us, that people increase and multiply in proportion as the means and facility of gaining a livelihood increase; and that this island, if they could be employed, is capable of supporting ten times its present number of people. In proportion therefore, as the demand increases for the manufactures of Britain, by the increase of people in her colonies, the numbers of her people at home will increase, and with them the strength as well as the wealth of the nation. For satisfaction in this point let the reader compare in his mind the number and force of our present fleets, with our fleet in Queen Elizabeth’s time  
*Viz. 40 sail, none of more than 40 guns.  
before we had colonies. Let him compare the antient with the present state of our towns and ports on our western coast, Manchester, Liverpool, Kendal, Lancaster, Glasgow, and the countries round them, that trade with and manufacture for our colonies, not to mention Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield and Birmingham, and consider what a difference there is in the numbers of people, buildings, rents, and the value of land and of the produce of land, even if he goes back no farther than is within man’s memory. Let him compare those countries with others on this same island, where manufactures have not yet extended themselves, observe the present difference, and reflect how much greater our strength may be, if numbers give strength, when our manufacturers shall occupy every part of the island where they can possibly be subsisted.  
But, say the objectors, “there is a certain distance from the sea, in America, beyond which the expence of carriage will put a stop to the sale and consumption of your manufactures; and this, with the difficulty of making returns for them, will oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for themselves; of course, if you suffer your people to extend their settlements beyond that distance, your people become useless to you:” and this distance is limited by some to 200 miles, by others to the Apalachian mountains. Not to insist on a very plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from whence a government may on occasion draw supplies and aids both of men of money, tho’ at too great a distance to be supply’d with manufactures from some other part, is therefore to be deem’d useless to the whole; I shall endeavour to show that these imaginary limits of utility, even in point of commerce are much too narrow.  
The inland parts of the continent of Europe are much farther from the sea than the limits of settlement proposed for America. Germany is full of tradesmen and artificers of all kinds, and the governments there, are not all of them always favourable to the commerce of Britain, yet it is a well-known fact, that our manufactures find their way even into the heart of Germany. Ask the great manufacturers and merchants of the Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, Manchester and Norwich goods, and they will tell you, that some of them send their riders frequently thro’ France or Spain and Italy, up to Vienna and back thro’ the middle and northern parts of Germany, to show samples of their wares and collect orders, which they receive by almost every mail, to a vast amount. Whatever charges arise on the carriage of goods, are added to the value, and all paid by the consumer. If these nations over whom we have no government, over whose consumption we can have no influence, but what arises from the cheapness and goodness of our wares; whose trade, manufactures, or commercial connections are not subject to the controul of our laws, as those of our colonies certainly are in some degree: I say, if these nations purchase and consume such quantities of our goods, notwithstanding the remoteness of their situation from the sea; how much less likely is it that the settlers in America, who must for ages be employ’d in agriculture chiefly, should make cheaper for themselves the goods our manufacturers at present supply them with; even if we suppose the carriage five, six or seven hundred miles from the sea as difficult and expensive as the like distance into Germany: whereas in the latter, the natural distances are frequently doubled by political obstructions, I mean the intermix’d territories and clashing interests of princes. But when we consider that the inland parts of America are penetrated by great navigable rivers; that there are a number of great lakes, communicating with each other, with those rivers and with the sea, very small portages here and there excepted;  
*From New York into lake Ontario, the land carriage of the several portages altogether, amounts to but about 27 miles. From lake Ontario into lake Erie, the land carriage at Niagara is but about 12 miles. All the lakes above Niagara communicate by navigable straits, so that no land carriage is necessary, to go out of one into another. From Presqu’ isle on lake Erie, there are but 15 miles land-carriage, and that a good waggon road, to Beef River a branch of the Ohio, which brings you into a navigation of many thousand miles inland, if you take together the Ohio, the Mississipi, and all the great rivers and branches that run into them.  
that the sea coasts (if one may be allow’d the expression) of those lakes only, amount at least to 2700 miles, exclusive of the rivers running into them; many of which are navigable to a great extent for boats and canoes, thro’ vast tracts of country; how little likely is it that the expence on the carriage of our goods into those countries, should prevent the use of them. If the poor Indians in those remote parts are now able to pay for the linnen, woolen and iron wares they are at present furnish’d with by the French and English traders, tho’ Indians have nothing but what they get by hunting, and the goods are loaded with all the impositions fraud and knavery can contrive to inhance their value; will not industrious English farmers, hereafter settled in those countries, be much better able to pay for what shall be brought them in the way of fair commerce?  
If it is asked, what can such farmers raise, wherewith to pay for the manufactures they may want from us? I answer, that the inland parts of America in question are well-known to be fitted for the production of hemp, flax, potash, and above all silk; the southern parts, may produce olive oil, raisins, currans, indigo, and cochineal. Not to mention horses and black cattle, which may easily be driven to the maritime markets, and at the same time assist in conveying other commodities. That the commodities first mention’d, may easily by water or land carriage be brought to the sea ports from interior America, will not seem incredible, when we reflect, that hemp formerly came from the Ukraine and most southern parts of Russia to Wologda, and down the Dwina to Archangel, and thence by a perilous navigation round the North Cape to England and other parts of Europe. It now comes from the same country up the Dnieper and down the Duna with much land carriage. Great part of the Russia iron, no high-priced commodity, is brought 3000 miles by land and water from the heart of Siberia. Furs, [the produce too of America] are brought to Amsterdam from all parts of Siberia, even the most remote, Kamschatska. The same country furnishes me with another instance of extended inland commerce. It is found worth while to keep up a mercantile communication between Peking in China and Petersburgh. And none of these instances of inland commerce exceed those of the courses by which, at several periods, the whole trade of the East was carried on. Before the prosperity of the Mamaluke dominion in Egypt fixed the staple for the riches of the East at Cairo and Alexandria, whither they were brought from the Red Sea, great part of those commodities were carried to the cities of Cashgar and Balk. This gave birth to those towns, that still subsist upon the remains of their ancient opulence, amidst a people and country equally wild. From thence those goods were carried down the Amû, the ancient Oxus, to the Caspian Sea, and up the Wolga to Astrachan, from whence they were carried over to, and down the Don to the mouth of that river, and thence again the Venetians directly, and the Genoese and Venetians indirectly by way of Kaffa and Trebisonde, dispers’d them thro’ the Mediterranean and some other parts of Europe. Another part of those goods was carried over-land from the Wolga to the rivers Duna and Neva; from both they were carried to the city of Wisbuy in the Baltick, so eminent for its sea-laws; and from the city of Ladoga on the Neva, we are told they were even carried by the Dwina to Archangel, and from thence round the North Cape.  
If iron and hemp will bear the charge of carriage from this inland country, other metals will as well as iron; and certainly silk, since 3d. per lb. is not above 1 per cent. on the value, and amounts to £28 per ton.  
If the growths of a country find their way out of it, the manufactures of the countries where they go will infallibly find their way into it. They who understand the oeconomy and principles of manufactures, know, that it is impossible to establish them in places not populous; and even in those that are populous, hardly possible to establish them to the prejudice of the places already in possession of them. Several attempts have been made in France and Spain, countenanced by the government, to draw from us and establish in those countries, our hard-ware and woolen manufactures, but without success. The reasons are various. A manufacture is part of a great system of commerce, which takes in conveniencies of various kinds, methods of providing materials of all sorts, machines for expediting and facilitating labour, all the channels of correspondence for vending the wares, the credit and confidence necessary to found and support this correspondence, the mutual aid of different artizans, and a thousand other particulars, which time and long experience have gradually established. A part of such a system cannot support itself without the whole, and before the whole can be obtained the part perishes. Manufactures where they are in perfection, are carried on by a multiplicity of hands, each of which is expert only in his own part, no one of them a master of the whole; and if by any means spirited away to a foreign country, he is lost without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the extremest difficulty to persuade a compleat set of workmen, skilled in all parts of a manufactory to leave their country together and settle in a foreign land. Some of the idle and drunken may be enticed away, but these only disappoint their employers, and serve to discourage the undertaking. If by royal munificence, and an expence that the profits of the trade alone would not bear a compleat set of good and skilful hands are collected and carried over, they find so much of the system imperfect, so many things wanting to carry on the trade to advantage, so many difficulties to overcome, and the knot of hands so easily broken, by death, dissatisfaction and desertion, that they and their employers are discouraged together, and the project vanishes into smoke. Hence it happens, that established manufactures are hardly ever lost, but by foreign conquest, or by some eminent interior fault in manners or government; a bad police oppressing and discouraging the workmen, or religious persecutions driving the sober and industrious out of the country. There is in short, scarce a single instance in history of the contrary, where manufactures have once taken firm root. They sometimes start up in a new place, but are generally supported like exotic plants at more expence than they are worth for any thing but curiosity, until these new seats become the refuge of the manufacturers driven from the old ones. The conquest of Constantinople and final reduction of the Greek empire, dispersed many curious manufacturers into different parts of Christendom. The former conquests of its provinces had before done the same. The loss of liberty in Verona, Milan, Florence, Pisa, Pistoia, and other great cities of Italy, drove the manufacturers of woolen cloth into Spain and Flanders. The latter first lost their trade and manufacturers to Antwerp and the cities of Brabant, from whence by persecution for religion they were sent into Holland and England. The civil wars during the minority of Charles the first of Spain, which ended in the loss of the liberty of their great towns, ended too in the loss of the manufactures of Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, Medina del campo, &amp;c. The revocation of the edict of Nantes, communicated, to all the Protestant parts of Europe, the paper, silk, and other valuable manufactures of France, almost peculiar at that time to that country, and till then in vain attempted elsewhere.  
To be convinc’d that it is not soil and climate, or even freedom from taxes, that determines the residence of manufacturers, we need only turn our eyes on Holland, where a multitude of manufactures are still carried on (perhaps more than on the same extent of territory any where in Europe) and sold on terms upon which they cannot be had in any other part of the world. And this too is true of those growths, which by their nature and the labour required to raise them, come the nearest to manufactures.  
As to the common-place objection to the North American settlements, that they are in the same climate and their produce the same as that of England; in the first place it is not true; it is particularly not so of the countries now likely to be added to our settlements; and of our present colonies, the products, lumber, tobacco, rice and indigo, great articles of commerce do not interfere with the products of England: in the next place, a man must know very little of the trade of the world, who does not know, that the greater part of it is carried on between countries whose climate differs very little. Even the trade between the different parts of these British islands, is greatly superior to that between England and all the West-India islands put together.  
If I have been successful in proving that a considerable commerce may and will subsist between us and our future most inland settlements in North America, notwithstanding their distance, I have more than half proved no other inconveniency will arise from their distance. Many men in such a country, must “know,” must “think,” and must “care” about the country they chiefly trade with. The juridical and other connections of government are yet a faster hold than even commercial ties, and spread directly and indirectly far and wide. Business to be solicited and causes depending, create a great intercourse even where private property is not divided in different countries, yet this division will always subsist where different countries are ruled by the same government. Where a man has landed property both in the mother country and a province, he will almost always live in the mother country: this, though there were no trade, is singly a sufficient gain. It is said, that Ireland pays near a million Sterling annually to its absentees in England: The ballance of trade from Spain or even Portugal is scarcely equal to this.  
Let it not be said we have no absentees from North-America. There are many to the writer’s knowledge; and if there are at present but few of them that distinguish themselves here by great expence, it is owing to the mediocrity of fortune among the inhabitants of the Northern colonies; and a more equal division of landed property, than in the West-India islands, so that there are as yet but few large estates. But if those who have such estates, reside upon and take care of them themselves, are they worse subjects than they would be if they lived idly in England? Great merit is assumed for the gentlemen of the West-Indies,  
*Remarks, p. 47, 48, &amp;c.  
on the score of their residing and spending their money in England. I would not depreciate that merit; it is considerable, for they might, if they pleased spend their money in France: but the difference between their spending it here and at home is not so great. What do they spend it in when they are here, but the produce and manufactures of this country; and would they not do the same if they were at home? Is it of any great importance to the English farmer, whether the West-India gentleman comes to London and eats his beef, pork, and tongues, fresh, or has them brought to him in the West-Indies salted; whether he eats his English cheese and butter or drinks his English ale at London or in Barbadoes? Is the clothier’s, or the mercer’s, or the cutler’s, or the toy-man’s profit less, for their goods being worn and consumed by the same persons residing on the other side of the ocean? Would not the profits of the merchant and mariner be rather greater, and some addition made to our navigation, ships and seamen? If the North-American gentleman stays in his own country, and lives there in that degree of luxury and expence with regard to the use of British manufactures, that his fortune entitles him to; may not his example (from the imitation of superiors so natural to mankind) spread the use of those manufactures among hundreds of families around him, and occasion a much greater demand for them, than it would do if he should remove and live in London?  
However this may be, if in our views of immediate advantage, it seems preferable that the gentlemen of large fortunes in North America should reside much in England, ’tis what may surely be expected as fast as such fortunes are acquired there. Their having “colleges of their own for the education of their youth,” will not prevent it: A little knowledge and learning acquired, increases the appetite for more, and will make the conversation of the learned on this side the water more strongly desired. Ireland has its university likewise; yet this does not prevent the immense pecuniary benefit we receive from that kingdom. And there will always be in the conveniencies of life, the politeness, the pleasures, the magnificence of the reigning country, many other attractions besides those of learning, to draw men of substance there, where they can, apparently at least, have the best bargain of happiness for their money.  
Our trade to the West-India islands is undoubtedly a valuable one: but whatever is the amount of it, it has long been at a stand. Limited as our sugar planters are by the scantiness of territory, they cannot increase much beyond their present number; and this is an evil, as I shall show hereafter, that will be little helped by our keeping Guadaloupe. The trade to our Northern Colonies, is not only greater, but yearly increasing with the increase of people: and even in a greater proportion, as the people increase in wealth and the ability of spending as well as in numbers. I have already said, that our people in the Northern Colonies double in about 25 years, exclusive of the accession of strangers. That I speak within bounds, I appeal to the authentic accounts frequently required by the board of trade, and transmitted to that board by the respective governors; of which accounts I shall select one as a sample, being that from the colony of Rhode-Island;

In obedience to your lordships’ commands, I have caused the within account to be taken by officers under oath. By it there appears to be in this colony at this time 35,939 white persons, and 4697 blacks, chiefly negroes.  
  
  
  
  
In the year 1730, by order of the then lords commissioners of trade and plantations, an account was taken of the number of people in this colony, and then there appeared to be 15,302 white persons, and 2633 blacks.  
  
  
  
  
Again in the year 1748, by like order, an account was taken of the number of people in this colony, by which it appears there were at that time 29,755 white persons, and 4373 blacks.

a colony that of all the others receives the least addition from strangers. For the increase of our trade to those colonies, I refer to the accounts frequently laid before Parliament, by the officers of the customs, and to the custom-house books: from which I have also selected one account, that of the trade from England (exclusive of Scotland) to Pensilvania;

N.B. The accounts for 1758 and 1759 are not yet compleated; but those acquainted with the North American trade, know, that the increase in those two years, has been in a still greater proportion; last year being supposed to exceed any former year by a third; and this owing to the increased ability of the people to spend, from the greater quantities of money circulating among them by the war.  
  
a colony most remarkable for the plain frugal manner of living of its inhabitants, and the most suspected of carrying on manufactures on account of the number of German artizans, who are known to have transplanted themselves into that country, though even these, in truth, when they come there, generally apply themselves to agriculture as the surest support and most advantageous employment. By this account it appears, that the exports to that province have in 28 years, increased nearly in the proportion of 17 to 1; whereas the people themselves, who by other authentic accounts appear to double their numbers (the strangers who settle there included) in about 16 years, cannot in the 28 years have increased in a greater proportion than as 4 to 1: the additional demand then, and consumption of goods from England, of 13 parts in 17 more than the additional number would require, must be owing to this, that the people having by their industry mended their circumstances, are enabled to indulge themselves in finer cloaths, better furniture, and a more general use of all our manufactures than heretofore. In fact, the occasion for English goods in North America, and the inclination to have and use them, is, and must be for ages to come, much greater than the ability of the people to pay for them; they must therefore, as they now do, deny themselves many things they would otherwise chuse to have, or increase their industry to obtain them; and thus, if they should at any time manufacture some coarse article, which on account of its bulk or some other circumstance, cannot so well be brought to them from Britain, it only enables them the better to pay for finer goods that otherwise they could not indulge themselves in: So that the exports thither are not diminished by such manufacture but rather increased. The single article of manufacture in these colonies mentioned by the remarker, is hats made in New-England. It is true there have been ever since the first settlement of that country, a few hatters there, drawn thither probably at first by the facility of getting beaver, while the woods were but little clear’d, and there was plenty of those animals. The case is greatly alter’d now. The beaver skins are not now to be had in New England, but from very remote places and at great prices. The trade is accordingly declining there, so that, far from being able to make hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot supply their home demand; and it is well known that some thousand dozens are sent thither yearly from London, and sold there cheaper than the inhabitants can make them of equal goodness. In fact, the colonies are so little suited for establishing of manufactures, that they are continually losing the few branches they accidentally gain. The working brasiers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well as hatters, who have happened to go over from time to time and settle in the colonies, gradually drop the working part of their business, and import their respective goods from England, whence they can have them cheaper and better than they can make them. They continue their shops indeed, in the same way of dealing, but become sellers of brasiery, cutlery, pewter, hats, &amp;c. brought from England, instead of being makers of those goods.  
Thus much as to the apprehension of our colonies becoming useless to us. I shall next consider the other supposition, that their growth may render them dangerous. Of this I own, I have not the least conception, when I consider that we have already fourteen separate governments on the maritime coast of the continent, and if we extend our settlements shall probably have as many more behind them on the inland side. Those we now have, are not only under different governors, but have different forms of government, different laws, different interests, and some of them different religious persuasions and different manners. Their jealousy of each other is so great that however necessary an union of the colonies has long been, for their common defence and security against their enemies, and how sensible soever each colony has been of that necessity, yet they have never been able to effect such an union among themselves, nor even to agree in requesting the mother country to establish it for them. Nothing but the immediate command of the crown has been able to produce even the imperfect union but lately seen there, of the forces of some colonies. If they could not agree to unite for their defence against the French and Indians, who were perpetually harassing their settlements, burning their villages, and murdering their people; can it reasonably be supposed there is any danger of their uniting against their own nation, which protects and encourages them, with which they have so many connections and ties of blood, interest and affection, and which ’tis well known they all love much more than they love one another? In short, there are so many causes that must operate to prevent it, that I will venture to say, an union amongst them for such a purpose is not merely improbable, it is impossible; and if the union of the whole is impossible, the attempt of a part must be madness: as those colonies that did not join the rebellion, would join the mother country in suppressing it.  
When I say such an union is impossible, I mean without the most grievous tyranny and oppression. People who have property in a country which they may lose, and privileges which they may endanger; are generally dispos’d to be quiet; and even to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the government is mild and just, while important civil and religious rights are secure, such subjects will be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not rise, but when the winds blow. What such an administration as the Duke of Alva’s in the Netherlands, might produce, I know not; but this I think I have a right to deem impossible. And yet there were two very manifest differences between that case, and ours, and both are in our favour. The first, that Spain had already united the seventeen provinces under one visible government, tho’ the states continued independent: The second, that the inhabitants of those provinces were of a nation, not only different from, but utterly unlike the Spaniards. Had the Netherlands been peopled from Spain, the worst of oppression had probably not provoked them to wish a separation of government. It might and probably would have ruined the country, but would never have produced an independent sovereignty. In fact, neither the very worst of governments, the worst of politicks in the last century, nor the total abolition of their remaining liberty, in the provinces of Spain itself, in the present, have produced any independency that could be supported. The same may be observed of France. And let it not be said that the neighbourhood of these to the seat of government has prevented a separation. While our strength at sea continues, the banks of the Ohio, (in point of easy and expeditious conveyance of troops) are nearer to London, than the remote parts of France and Spain to their respective capitals; and much nearer than Connaught and Ulster were in the days of Queen Elizabeth. No body foretels the dissolution of the Russian monarchy from its extent, yet I will venture to say, the eastern parts of it are already much more inaccessible from Petersburgh, than the country on the Mississipi is from London; I mean more men, in less time, might be conveyed the latter than the former distance. The rivers Oby, Jenesea and Lena, do not facilitate the communication half so well by their course, nor are they half so practicable as the American rivers. To this I shall only add the observation of Machiavel, in his Prince, that a government seldom long preserves its dominion over those who are foreigners to it; who on the other hand fall with great ease, and continue inseparably annex’d to the government of their own nation, which he proves by the fate of the English conquests in France.  
Yet with all these disadvantages, so difficult is it to overturn an established government, that it was not without the assistance of France and England, that the United Provinces supported themselves: which teaches us, that if the visionary danger of independence in our colonies is to be feared, nothing is more likely to render it substantial than the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the sovereign government, capable of giving either aid or an asylum, as the event shall require. Yet against even these disadvantages, did Spain preserve almost ten provinces, merely thro’ their want of union, which indeed could never have taken place among the others, but for causes, some of which are in our case impossible, and others it is impious to suppose possible.  
The Romans well understood that policy which teaches the security arising to the chief government from separate states among the governed, when they restored the liberties of the states of Greece, (oppressed but united under Macedon,) by an edict that every state should live under its own laws.  
*Omnes Graecorum civitates, quae in Europa, quaeque in Asia essent, libertatem ac suas leges haberent, &amp;c.Liv. lib. 33. c. 30.  
They did not even name a governor. Independence of each other, and separate interests, tho’ among a people united by common manners, language, and I may say religion, inferior neither in wisdom, bravery, nor their love of liberty, to the Romans themselves, was all the security the sovereigns wished for their sovereignty. It is true, they did not call themselves sovereigns; they set no value on the title; they were contented with possessing the thing; and possess it they did, even without a standing army. What can be a stronger proof of the security of their possession? And yet by a policy similar to this throughout, was the Roman world subdued and held: a world compos’d of above an hundred languages and sets of manners different from those of their masters.  
*When the Romans had subdu’d Macedon and Illyricum, they were both form’d into republicks by a decree of the senate, and Macedon was thought safe from the danger of a revolution, by being divided, into a division common among the Romans, as we learn from the tetrarchs in scripture. Omnium primum liberos esse placebat Macedonas atque Illyrios; ut omnibus gentibus appareret, arma populi Romani non liberis servitutem, sed contra servientibus libertatem afferre. Ut et in libertate gentes quae essent, tutam earn sibi perpetuamque sub tutela populi Romani esse: et quae sub regibus viverent, et in presens tempus mitiores eos jusioresque respectu populi Romani habere se; et si quando bellum cum populo Romano regibus fuisset suis, excitum ejus victoriam Romanis, sibi libertatem allaturum crederent. … In quatuor regiones describi Macedoniam, ut suum quaeque concilium haberet, placuit: et dimidium tributi quam quod regibus ferre soliti erant, populo Romano pendere. Similia his et in Illyricum mandata.Liv. lib. 45. c. 18.

d it.  
But what is the prudent policy inculcated by the remarker, to obtain this end, security of dominion over our colonies: It is, to leave the French in Canada, to “check” their growth, for otherwise our people may “increase infinitely from all causes.”  
†Remarks, p. 50, 51.  
We have already seen in what manner the French and their Indians check the growth of our colonies. ’Tis a modest word, this, check, for massacring men, women and children. The writer would, if he could, hide from himself as well as from the public, the horror arising from such a proposal, by couching it in general terms: ’tis no wonder he thought it a “subject not fit for discussion” in his letter, tho’ he recommends it as “a point that should be the constant object of the minister’s attention!” But if Canada is restored on this principle, will not Britain be guilty of all the blood to be shed, all the murders to be committed in order to check this dreaded growth of our own people? Will not this be telling the French in plain terms, that the horrid barbarities they perpetrate with their Indians on our colonists, are agreeable to us; and that they need not apprehend the resentment of a government with whose views they so happily concur? Will not the colonies view it in this light? Will they have reason to consider themselves any longer as subjects and children, when they find their cruel enemies halloo’d upon them by the country from whence they sprung, the government that owes them protection as it requires their obedience? Is not this the most likely means of driving them into the arms of the French, who can invite them by an offer of that security their own government chuses not to afford them? I would not be thought to insinuate that the remarker wants humanity. I know how little many good-natured persons are affected by the distresses of people at a distance and whom they do not know. There are even those, who, being present, can sympathize sincerely with the grief of a lady on the sudden death of her favourite bird, and yet can read of the sinking of a city in Syria with very little concern. If it be, after all, thought necessary to check the growth of our colonies, give me leave to propose a method less cruel. It is a method of which we have an example in scripture. The murder of husbands, of wives, of brothers, sisters, and children whose pleasing society has been for some time enjoyed, affects deeply the respective surviving relations: but grief for the death of a child just born is short and easily supported. The method I mean is that which was dictated by the Egyptian policy, when the “infinite increase” of the children of Israel was apprehended as dangerous to the state.  
*And Pharoah said unto his people, behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we; come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply; and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. … And the king spake to the Hebrew midwives, &amp;c.Exodus, Chap. 1.  
Let an act of parliament, [then] be made, enjoining the colony midwives to stifle in the birth every third or fourth child. By this means you may keep the colonies to their present size. And if they were under the hard alternative of submitting to one or the other of these schemes for checking their growth, I dare answer for them, they would prefer the latter.  
But all this debate about the propriety or impropriety of keeping or restoring Canada, is possibly too early. We have taken the capital indeed, but the country is yet far from being in our possession; and perhaps never will be: for if our M——rs are persuaded by such counsellors as the remarker, that the French there are “not the worst of neighbours,” and that if we had conquered Canada, we ought for our own sakes to restore it, as a check to the growth of our colonies, I am then afraid we shall never take it. For there are many ways of avoiding the completion of the conquest, that will be less exceptionable and less odious than the giving it up.  
The objection I have often heard, that if we had Canada, we could not people it, without draining Britain of its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance of the nature of population in new countries. When we first began to colonize in America, it was necessary to send people, and to send seed-corn; but it is not now necessary that we should furnish, for a new colony, either one or the other. The annual increment alone of our present colonies, without diminishing their numbers, or requiring a man from hence, is sufficient in ten years to fill Canada with double the number of English that it now has of French inhabitants.  
*In fact, there has not gone from Britain to our colonies these 20 years past, to settle there, so many as 10 families a year; the new settlers are either the offspring of the old, or emigrants from Germany or the north of Ireland.  
Those who are protestants among the French, will probably chuse to remain under the English government; many will chuse to remove if they can be allowed to sell their lands improvements and effects: the rest in that thin-settled country, will in less than half a century, from the crowds of English settling round and among them, be blended and incorporated with our people both in language and manners.  
In Guadalupe the case is somewhat different; and though I am far from thinking  
†Remarks, p. 30, 34.  
we have sugar-land enough,  
‡It is often said we have plenty of sugar-land still unemployed in Jamaica: but those who are well acquainted with that island, know, that the remaining vacant land in it is generally situated among mountains, rocks and gullies, that make carriage impracticable, so that no profitable use can be made of it, unless the price of sugars should so greatly increase as to enable the planter to make very expensive roads, by blowing up rocks, erecting bridges, &amp;c. every 2 or 300 yards.  
I cannot think Guadalupe is so desirable an increase of it, as other objects the enemy would probably be infinitely more ready to part with. A country fully inhabited by any nation is no proper possession for another of different language, manners and religion. It is hardly ever tenable at less expence than it is worth. But the isle of Cayenne, and its appendix Equinoctial-France, would indeed be an acquisition every way suitable to our situation and desires. This would hold all that migrate from Barbadoes, the Leward-Islands, or Jamaica. It would certainly recal into an English government (in which there would be room for millions) all who have before settled or purchased in Martinico, Guadalupe, Santa-Cruz or St. John’s; except such as know not the value of an English government, and such I am sure are not worth recalling.  
But should we keep Guadalupe, we are told it would enable us to export £300,000 in sugars. Admit it to be true, though perhaps the amazing increase of English consumption might stop most of it here, to whose profit is this to redound? to the profit of the French inhabitants of the island: except a small part that should fall to the share of the English purchasers, but whose whole purchase-money must first be added to the wealth and circulation of France.  
I grant, however, much of this £300,000 would be expended in British manufactures. Perhaps, too, a few of the land-owners of Guadalupe might dwell and spend their fortunes in Britain, (though probably much fewer than of the inhabitants of North America). I admit the advantage arising to us from these circumstances, (as far as they go) in the case of Guadalupe, as well as in that of our other West India settlements. Yet even this consumption is little better than that of an allied nation would be, who should take our manufactures and supply us with sugar, and put us to no expence in defending the place of growth.  
But though our own colonies expend among us almost the whole produce of our sugar,  
*Remarks, p. 47.  
can we or ought we to promise ourselves this will be the case of Guadalupe. One £100,000 will supply them with British manufactures; and supposing we can effectually prevent the introduction of those of France, (which is morally impossible in a country used to them) the other 200,000 will still be spent in France, in the education of their children and support of themselves; or else be laid up there, where they will always think their home to be.  
Besides this consumption of British manufactures, much is said of the benefit we shall have from the situation of Guadalupe, and we are told of a trade to the Caraccas and Spanish Main. In what respect Guadalupe is better situated for this trade than Jamaica, or even any of our other islands, I am at a loss to guess. I believe it to be not so well situated for that of the windward coast, as Tobago and St. Lucia, which in this as well as other respects, would be more valuable possessions, and which, I doubt not, the peace will secure to us. Nor is it nearly so well situated for that of the rest of the Spanish Main as Jamaica. As to the greater safety of our trade by the possession of Guadalupe, experience has convinced us that in reducing a single island, or even more, we stop the privateering business but little. Privateers still subsist, in equal if not greater numbers, and carry the vessels into Martinico which before it was more convenient to carry into Guadalupe. Had we all the Caribbees, it is true, they would in those parts be without shelter. Yet upon the whole I suppose it to be a doubtful point and well worth consideration, whether our obtaining possession of all the Caribbees, would be more than a temporary benefit, as it would necessarily soon fill the French part of Hispaniola with French inhabitants, and thereby render it five times more valuable in time of peace, and little less than impregnable in time of war; and would probably end in a few years in the uniting the whole of that great and fertile island under a French government. It is agreed on all hands, that our conquest of St. Christophers, and driving the French from thence, first furnish’d Hispaniola with skilful and substantial planters, and was consequently the first occasion of its present opulence. On the other hand, I will hazard an opinion, that valuable as the French possessions in the West Indies are, and undeniable the advantages they derive from them, there is somewhat to be weighed in the opposite scale. They cannot at present make war with England, without exposing those advantages while divided among the numerous islands they now have, much more than they would, were they possessed of St. Domingo only; their own share of which would, if well cultivated, grow more sugar, than is now grown in all their West India islands.  
I have before said I do not deny the utility of the conquest, or even of our future possession of Guadalupe, if not bought too dear. The trade of the West Indies is one of our most valuable trades. Our possessions there deserve our greatest care and attention. So do those of North America. I shall not enter into the invidious task of comparing their due estimation. It would be a very long and a very disagreeable one, to run thro’ every thing material on this head. It is enough to our present point, if I have shown, that the value of North America is capable of an immense increase, by an acquisition and measures, that must necessarily have an effect the direct contrary of what we have been industriously taught to fear; and that Guadalupe is, in point of advantage, but a very small addition to our West India possessions, rendered many ways less valuable to us than it is to the French, who will probably set more value upon it than upon a country that is much more valuable to us than to them.  
There is a great deal more to be said on all the parts of these subjects; but as it would carry me into a detail that I fear would tire the patience of my readers, and which I am not without apprehensions I have done already, I shall reserve what remains till I dare venture again on the indulgence of the publick.  
Finis.

Since the foregoing sheets were printed off, the writer has obtained accounts of the Exports to North America, and the West India Islands, by which it appears, that there has been some increase of trade to those Islands as well as to North America, though in a much less degree. The following extract from these accounts will show the reader at one view the amount of the exports to each, in two different terms of five years; the terms taken at ten years distance from each other, to show the increase, viz.

By these accounts it appears, that the Exports to the West India Islands, and to the Northern Colonies, were in the first term nearly equal; the difference being only £122,936 10s. 4d.

Some part of this increased demand for English goods, may be ascribed to the armies and fleets we have had both in North America and the West Indies; not so much for what is consumed by the soldiery; their clothing, stores, ammunition, &amp;c. sent from hence on account of the government, being (as is supposed) not included in these accounts of merchandize exported; but, as the war has occasioned a great plenty of money in America, many of the inhabitants have increased their expence.  
These accounts do not include any Exports from Scotland to America, which are doubtless proportionably considerable; nor the Exports from Ireland

THE  
  
1NT ERE ST.  
  
OF  
  
GREAT BRITAIN  
With Regard to her COL ONIE 8.  
  
adare F fo Two Great Men, — the Remarks  
on that letter. It is not merely from the beau-  
ty, the force and perſpicuity of expreſſion, or ts  
general elegance of manner conſpicuous in hot  
  
- pamphlets; that my pleaſure chiefly ariſes ; it is ra-  
  
the. from this, that I have lived to fee ſubjects  
the greateſt importance to this nation publickly  
Gülcafted without party views, or party heat, with  
decency and politeneſs, and with no other warmth  
than what a zeal for the honour” and happineſs of  
our king and country maf inſpire; aud this by  
writers whoſe underſtanding (however they may  
differ from each other) appears not unequal to their  
candour and the uprightneſs of their intention.  
  
But, as great abilities have not always che beſt  
information, there are, I apprehend, in the Remar  
| fome opinions not well Ranked; and ſome mi  
takes of ſo important a nature, as to render a few  
obſervations on them neceſſary for the better in-  
formation of the public.  
  
The author of the Letter, whom be every way. |  
beſt able to ſupport his own ſentiments will, I  
hope, excuſe me, if I ſeem officiouſly to interfere ;  
  
when he .cenhiders, that the ſ Pant of patrocſy, like  
B other  
  
| 1 Have uſed with no ſmall pleaſure the Letter  
  
.  
  
other qualities good and bad, is catching; and  
that his long ſilence ſince the Remarks appeared  
has made us deſpair of ſeeing the ſubject farther  
diſcuſſed by his maſterly hand. The ingenious and  
candid remarker, too, who muſt have been miſled  
himſelf before he employed his ſkill and addreſs to  
miſlead others, will certainly, fince he declares he  
aims at no ſeduction, be diſpoſed to excuſe even  
the weakeſt effort to prevent it.  
  
And ſurely if the general opinions that poſſeſs the  
minds of the people may poſſibly be of conſequence  
in publick affairs, it muſt be fit to ſet thoſe opinions  
right. If there is danger, as the remarker ſuppoſes, that  
extravagant expeCations”” may embaraſs a vir-  
tuous and able miniſtry,” and “render the nego-  
tiation for peace a work of infinite difficulty; +  
there is no leſs danger that expectations too low,  
thro* want of proper information, may have a con-  
trary effect, may make even a virtuous and able  
miniſtry leſs anxious, and leſs attentive to the ob-  
  
  
the nation are eſſentially concerned; and the peo-  
ple leſs hearty in ſupporting ſuch a miniſtry and its  
 mneatures,/s———-; * 2 |  
  
I The people of this nation are indeed reſpectable,  
not for their numbers only, but for their under-  
ſtanding and their publick ſpirit : they manifeſt  
the firſt, by their univerſal approbation of the late  
prudent and vigorous meaſures, and the confidence  
they ſo juſtly repoſe in a wiſe and good prince,  
and an honeſt and able adminiſtration; the latter  
they have demonſtrated by the immenſe ſupplies  
granted in parliament unanimouſly, and paid  
through the whole kingdom with chearfulneſs.  
And - ſince to this ſpirit and theſe ſupplies our  
&lt; victories and ſucceſſes” I have in great gar il  
Remarks, p. 6. + Remarks, p. 7, f Remarks, p. 7.

been owing, is it quite right, is it generous to ſay,  
Vith the remarker, that the people had no ſhare  
in acquiring them?” The mere mob he cannot  
mean, even where he ſpeaks of the madneſs of the  _  
people; for the madneſs of the mob muſt be too  
feeble and impotent, arm&#x27;d as the government of  
1 this country at preſent is, to“ over - rule, even in  
* the lighteſt inſtances, the virtue and moderation”  
of a firm and ſteady miniſtry, _  
  
While the war continues, its final event is quite  
uncertain. The Victorious of this year may be the  
Vanquiſh&#x27;d of the next. It may therefore be too  
early to ſay, what advantages we ought abſolutely  
  
to inſiſt on, and make the ine quibus non of a peace.  
If the neceſſity of our affairs ſhould oblige us to  
Accept of terms leſs advantageous than our preſent  
ſucceſſes ſeem to promiſe us, an intelligent people  
as ours is, muſt ſee that neceſſity, and will ae-  
quieſce. But as a peace, when it is made, may  
made haſtily ; and as the unhappy continuance  
the war affords us time to conſider, among ſeveral  
advantages gain&#x27;d or to be gain&#x27;d, which of them  
may be moſt for our intereſt to retain, if ſome and  
not all may poſſibly be retained ; I do not blame  
the public diſquiſition of theſe points, as premature  
or uſeleſs. Light often ariſes from a colliſion of  
opinions, as fire from flint and ſteel; and if. we  
can obtain the benefit of the light, without danger  
from the heat ſometimes produc&#x27;d by controverſy,  
why ſhould we diſcourage it ? |  
Suppoſing then, that heaven may ſtill continue  
to bleſs his Majeſty&#x27;s arms, and that the event of  
this juſt war may put it in our power to retain  
ſome of our conqueſts at the making of a peace;  
let us conſider whether we are to confine ourſelves  
  
to thoſe poſſeſſions only that were the objezFs for  
„ B 2 whieh

which we began the war.” * This the remarker  
ſeems to think right, when the queſtion relates to  
Canada, properly ſo called,” it having never been  
© mentioned as one of thoſe objects in any of our  
* memorials or deelarations, or in any national or  
&lt; public act whatſoever.” But the gentleman him-  
ſelf will probably agree, that if the ceſſion of Ca.  
nada would be a real advantage to us, we may de+  
mand it under his ſecond” head, as an indemni-  
ſcation for the charges incurred“ in recovering our  
Juſt rights; otherwiſe according to his o prin-  
ciples the demand of Guadaloupe can have no foun-  
dation. | | 5  
That © our claims before the war were large  
* enough for poſſeſſion and for ſecurity too, + tho?  
it ſeems a clear point with the ingenious remarker,  
is, I own, not ſo with me. I am rather of the con-  
traty opinion, and ſhall preſently give my rea-  
  
ſons. But firſt let me obſerve, that we did not  
make thoſe claims becauſe they were large enough  
tor ſecurity, but becauſe we could rightfully claim  
no more. Advantages gain&#x27;d in the courſe of this  
war, may increaſe the extent of our rights. Our  
claims before the war containꝰd ſome ſecurity z but  
that is no reaſon why we ſhould neglect acquiring  
more when the demand of more is become rea-  
ſonable. It may be reaſonable in the caſe of A.  
merica to aſk for the ſecurity recommended by the  
author of the letter, | tho* it would be prepoſterous  
to do it in many other caſes: his propos&#x27;d demand  
is founded on the little value of Canada to the  
French; the right we have to aſk, and the power  
we may have to inſiſt on an indemnification for our  
expences; the difficulty the French themſelves

of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon  
us, by building a fort, even in the obſcureſt cor-

The Indians in the French intereft are, upon all proper ap-  
© portunities, inſtigated by their prieſts, who have generally the  
chief management of their public councils, to acts of ho.  
« ſtility againſt the Exgliſb, even in time of profound peace be-  
* tween the two crowns. Of this there are many undeniable  
inſtances: The war berween the Indians and the colonies of  
the Maſſachuſetts Bay and New Hampſbire, in 1723, by which  
thoſe colonies ſuffered ſo much damage, was begun by the  
inſtigation of the French ; their ſupplies were from them, and  
there are now original letters of ſeveral Jeſuits to be pro-  
duced, whereby it evidently appears, that they were contin-  
ually animating the Indians, when almoſt tired with the war,  
to a farther proſecution of it. The French not only excited  
the Indians, and ſupported them, but joined their own forces  
wich them in all the late hoſtilities that have been committed  
within his Majeſty&#x27;s province of Nowa Scotia. And from an  
intercepted letter this year from the Jeſuit at Penołſcot, and  
from other information, it is certain that they have been ufing  
their utmoſt endeavours to excite the Indians to new acts of  
hoſtility againſt his - Majeſty&#x27;s colony of the Maſſachuſetta  
Bay, and ſome have been committed. The, French not only  
excite the Indians to acts of holility, but reward them for it,  
by buying the Eng///&gt; priſoners of them; for the ranſom of

be independent; and while either ſide thinks itſelf

by a treaty at which the miniſters of France re-

In ſhort, ſecurity and quiet of princes and, ſtates  
have ever been deemed ſufficient reaſons, when  
ſupported by power, for diſpoſing of rights; and «  
ſuch diſpoſition has never been looked on as  
want of moderation. It has always been the  
foundation of the moſt general treaties. The ſe-  
curity of Germany was the argument for yielding  
  
conſiderable poſſeſſions there ro the Swedes : and  
  
the ſecurity of Europe divided the Spaniſb monar-  
chy, by the partition treaty, made between powers  
who had no other right to diſpoſe of any part of it,  
There can be no ceſſion that is not ſuppoſed at  
leaſt, to increaſe the power of the party to whom  
it is made. It is enough that he has a right to  
aſk it, and that he does it not merely to ſerve the  
purpoſes of a dangerous ambition. Canada in the  
hands of Britain, will endanger the kingdom of  
France as little as any other ceſſion; and from its 5  
ſituation and circumſtances cannot be hurtful to any  
other ſtate. Rather, if peace be an advantage,  
this ceſſion may be ſuch to all Europe. Ihe pre-  
ſent war teaches us, that diſputes ariſing in 4.  
14 werica, may be an occaſion of embroiling na-

here ſuch &quot;oy&quot; | cannot prevent this, Dur-  
ing a peace, it is not to be doubted the French, 0  
who are adroit at fortifying, will likewiſe erect  
forts in the moſt advantageous places of the coun-  
try we leave them, which will make it more diffi- |  
cult than ever to be reduc&#x27;d in caſe of another war.  
We know by the experience of this war, how  
extremely difficult it is to march an army thro? the |  
American woods, with its neceſſary cannon |  
ſores, ſufficient ta reduce a very light fort. The b  
accounts at the treaſury will tell you what amazing  
ſums we have neceſſarily ſpent in the expeditions  
agaiuſt two very trifling forts, Duqueſne and Crown |  
Point. While the French retain. their influence  
over the Indians, they can eaſily keep our long j  
extended frontier in continual alarm, by a very |  
few of thoſe people; and with a ſmall number of  
regulars and . militia, in ſuch a country, we find  
they can keep an army of ours in full employ for  
ſeveral years. We therefore ſhall. not — to be  
told by our colonies, that if we leave Canada, how-  
ever circumſerib&#x27;d, to the French, ** we. have done  
nothing; we mal ſoon be made an. our»...  
ſelves of this truth, and to our coſt. IT  
I would not be underſtood to deny that even if  
we ſubdue and retain Canada, ſome tew forts may  
be of uſe to ſecure the goods of the traders, and  
protect the commerce, in caſe of any ſudden miſ-  
&gt; underſtanding with any tribe of Indians: but theſe  
13 forts will be beſt under the care of the colonies in-  
; tereſted in the Indian trade, and garriſon&#x27;d by their  
Provincial forces, and at their own expence. Their  
own intereſt will then induce the American govern-  
ments to take care of ſuch forts in proportion to |  
their importance; and ſee that the officers keep  
&quot;ue corps full and mind their dutr. But any

troops of ours plac&#x27;d there and accountable here,  
would, in ſuch remote and obſcure places and at  
ſo great a diſtance from the eye and inſpection of  
ſuperiors, ſoon become of little conſequence, even  
tho* the French were left in poſſeſſion of Canada. If  
the four independent companies maintained by  
the Crown in New York more than forty years,  
  
at a great expence, conſiſted, for moſt part of  
the time, of taggors chiefly ; if their officers en- +  
Joy&#x27;d their places as fine cures, and werk only, as a  
writer “of that country ſtiles them, a kind of mili-  
tary monks; if this was the ſtate of troops poſted  
in a populous country, where the impoſition could/ |  
not be ſo well conceal&#x27;d ; what may we expect will  
be the caſe of thoſe that ſhall be poſted two, three  
or four hundred miles from the inhabitants, in  
ſuch obſcure and remote places as Crown Point,  
Ofwego, Duqueſne, or Niagara? they would ſcarce  
be even faggots; they would dwindle to meer  
names upon paper, and appear no where but upon

our people are ſpread over a country fix times as  
large. I think this is the only point of light in  
which this queſtion is to be viewed, and is the  
only one in which any of the colonies are con-  
cerned. No colony, no poſſeſſor of lands in any  
colony, therefore wiſhes for conqueſts, or can be  
benefited by them, otherwiſe than as they may be a

ſoon, if our people remain confined within the  
mountains, and almoſt as ſoon ſhould it be unſafe  
  
  
to us, no man acquainted with political and com-  
mercial hiſtory can doubt. Manufactures are  
founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor  
without land in a country, and who muſt work for  
others at low wages or ſtarve, that enables under-  
takers to carry on a manufacture, and afford it  
cheap enough to prevent the importation of the  
ſame kind from abroad, and to bear the expence  
of its own exportation. But no man who can  
have a piece of land of his own, ſufficient by his  
  
  
nough to be a manufacturer and work for a ma-  
ſter. Hence while there is land enough in America  
  
  
any amount or value. It is a ſtriking obſervation  
of a very able pen, that the natural livelihood of  
the thin inhabitants of a forcſt country, is hunting ;  
that of a greater number, paſturage ; that of a

It will be a conqueſt for the whole, and all our  
ople will, in the increaſe of trade and the eaſe of  
taxes, find the advantage of it. Should we be  
obliged at any time to make a war for the protec-

tion of our manufactures, would it be fair to  
repreſent ſuch a war merely as blood and treaſure

our intereſt a little likewiſe: we ſhall remove the  
French from Canada that you may live in peace,  
and we be no more drained by your quarrels.  
You ſhall have land enough to cultivate, that you  
may have neither neceſſity nor inclination to go in-  
to manufactures, and/we will manufacture for you  
and govern you.  
  
A reader of the remarks may be apt to ſay; if  
this writer would have us reſtore Canada on prin-  
ciples of moderation, how can we conſiſtent with  
thoſe principles, retain Guadaloup, which he repre-  
ſents of ſo much greater value! I will endeavour  
to explain this, becauſe by doing it I ſhall have an  
opportunity of ſhowing the truth and good ſenſe  
of the anſwer to the intereſted application. I have  
juſt ſuppoſed. The author then is only apparently  
and not really inconliſtent with himſelf. If we can  
obtain the credit of moderation by reſtoring Cana-  
da, it is well: but we ſhould, however, reſtore it  
at all events; becauſe it would not only be of no  
uſe to us, but the poſſeſſion of it (in his opinion)  
may in its conſequence be dangerous*.”* As how?  
Why, plainly, (at length it comes out) if the French  
are not left there to check the growth of our colo-  
nies, “they will extend themſelves almoſt without  
© bounds into the in-land parts, and increaſe in-  
&lt; finitely from all cauſes; becoming a numerous,  
% hardy, independent people, poſſeſſed of a ſtrong  
* country, communicating little or not at all with  
« England, living wholly on their own labour, and  
ce jn proceſs of time knowing little and enquiring  
“little about the mother country.“ In ſhort, ac-  
cording to this writer, our preſent volonies are  
large enough and numerous enough, and the French  
ought to be left in North America to prevent their  
increaſe, leſt they become not only »/eleſs but  
dangercus to Britain, + 1  
  
„Remarks, p. 50, 51.  
  
l agree with the gentleman, that with Canada in our  
  
ſſeſſion, our people in America will increaſe amaz-

where they are not moleſted by the enemy, is doubl-  
ing their numbers every twenty five years by natural  
generation only, excluſive of the acceſſion of fo-

probably in a century more, make the number of  
Britiſh ſubjects on that ſide the water more nume-

* The reaſon of this greater increaſe in America than in Eu-

1 poſſeſſions opened the pleaſing pro-  
ſpect. 1  
Phe remarker thinks that our in Ame-  
rica, finding no check from Canada would ex-  
« tend themſelves almoſt without bounds into the  
* inland parts, and increaſe infinitely from all  
% cauſes.” The very reaſon he aſſigns for their ſo  
extending, and which is indeed the true one, their  
being invited to i by the pleaſantneſs, fertility  
« and plenty of the country,” may ſatisfy us, that  
this extenfion will continue to proceed as long as  
there remains any pleaſant fertile country within  
their reach. And if we even ſuppoſe them con-  
fin&#x27;d by the waters of the Mifiſſipi weſtward,  
and by thoſe of St. Laurence and the lakes to the  
northward, yet ftill we ſhall leave them room e-  
nough to increaſe even in the ſparſe manner of  
ſettling now practis&#x27;d there, till they amount to  
perhaps a hundred millions of fouls. This muſt  
take ſome centurics to fulfil, and in the mean time,  
this nation muſt neceffarily ſupply them with the  
manufactures they conſume, becauſe the new ſettlers  
will be employ&#x27; d in agriculture, and the new ſettle-  
ments will ſo continually draw off the ſpare hands  
from the old, that our preſent colonies will not,  
during the period we have mention&#x27;d, find them-  
| ſelves in a condition to manufacture even for their  
own inhabitants, to any conſiderable degree, much  
leſs for thoſe who are ſettling behind them. Thus  
dur trade muſt, till that country becomes as fully  
ed as England, that is for centuries to come,  
be continually increaſing, and with it our naval  
power; becauſe the ocean is between us and them,  
and our ſhips and ſeamen muſt increaſe as that trade  
increaſes. . EM  
The human body and the political differ in  
  
this, that the firſt is limited by nature to a certain  
ſtature,  
  
\
  
%  
  
1  
ſtature, which, when attain&#x27; d, it cannot, ordinarily,  
exceed; the other by better government and more  
prudent police, as well as by change of manners  
and other circumſtances, often takes freſh ſtarts of  
  
rowth, after being long at a ſtand ; and may add  
tenfold to the dimenſions it had for ages been con-  
fined to. The mother being of full ſtature, is in  
a few years equal&#x27;d by a growing daughter: but  
in the caſe of a mother country and her colomes,  
it is quite different. The growth of the children  
tends to encreaſe the growth of the mother, and fo  
the difference and ſuperiority is longer preſerv&#x27;d.  
  
Were the inhabitants of this iſ}and limited to their  
preſent number by any thing in nature, or by un-  
changeable circumſtances, the equality of popu-  
lation between the two countries might indeed  
ſooner come to paſs: but ſure experience in thoſe  
parts of the iſland where manufactures have been  
introduc&#x27;d, teaches us, that people increaſe and  
multiply in proportion as the means and facility of a  
gaining a livelihood increaſe; and that this ifland, |  
if they could be employed, is capable of ſupport- *  
  
ing ten times its preſent number of people. In  
proportion therefore, as the demand increaſes for  
the manufactures of Britain, by the increaſe of  
people in her colonies, the numbers of her people  
at home will increaſe, and with them the ſtrength  
as well as the wealth of the nation. For ſatisfaction  
in this point let the reader compare in his mind the  
number and force of our preſent fleets, with our  
fleet in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s time“ before we had  
colonies. Let him compare the antient with the  
preſent ſtate of our towns and ports on our &#x27;weſt-  
ern coaſt, Mancheſter, Liverpool, Renal, Lan-  
caſter, Glaſgow, and the countries round them,

not to mention Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield and Birs  
mingham, and conſider what a difference there is in  
  
the numbers of people, buildings, rents, and the  
  
value of land and of the produce of land, even if  
  
he goes back no farther than is within man&#x27;s me-  
mory. Let him compare thoſe, countries with o  
thers on this ſame iſland, where manufactures have  
not yet extended themſelves, obſerve the preſent  
  
difference, and reflect how much greater our  
ſtrength may be, if numbers give ſtrength, when  
our manufacturers ſhall occupy every part of the  
  
iſland where they can poſſibly be ſubſiſted.  
But, ſay the objectors, ** there is a certain diſtance  
from the ſea, in America, beyond which the ex-  
pence of carriage will put a ſtop to the lale and  
conſumption of your manufactures ; and this, with  
the difficulty of making returns for them, will  
oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for them-  
ſelves; of courſe, if you ſuffer your people to ex-  
tend their ſettlements beyond that diſtance, your  
people become uſeleſs to you:“ and this diſtance  
is limited by ſome to 200 miles, by others to the  
Apalachian mountains. Not to inſiſt on a very  
plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from  
whence a government may on occaſion draw ſup-  
plies and aids both of men of money, tho&#x27; at too  
great a diſtance to be ſupply&#x27;d with manufactures  
from ſome other part, is therefore to be deem&#x27;d  
uſeleſs to the whole ; I ſhall endeavour to ſhow  
that theſe imaginary limits of utility, even in 325  
  
of commerce are much too narrow.  
  
The inland parts of the continent of Europe are  
much farther from the ſea than the limits of ſettle-  
ment propoſed for America. Germam is full of  
tradeſmen and artificers of all kinds, and the go-  
vernments there, are not all of them always fa-  
vourable to the commerce of Britain, yet it is a  
well-  
  
— 1  
  
„ 1  
  
  
way even into the heart of Germany. Aſk the great  
  
  
will tell you, that ſome of them ſend their riders  
  
  
Vienna and back thro&#x27; the middle and northern  
arts of Germany, to ſhow ſamples of their wares  
  
  
every mail, to a vaſt amount. Whatever charges  
ariſe on the carriage of goods, are added to the  
  
  
  
what ariſes from the cheapneſs and goodneſs of our  
wares; Whoſe trade, manufactures, or commercial  
connections are not ſubject to the controul of our  
  
  
degree: I ſay, if theſe nations purchaſe and con-  
ſume ſuch quanrities of our goods, notwithſtand-  
ing the remoteneſs of their ſituation from the ſea ;  
how much leſs likely is it that the ſettlers in Ame-  
  
  
the goods our manufacturers at preſent ſupply  
them with; even if we ſuppoſe the carriage five, fix  
or ſeven hundred miles from the ſea as difficult and  
expenſive as the hke diſtance into Germany :  
  
whereas in the latter, the natural diſtances are fre-  
quently doubled by political obſtructions, I mean  
  
  
princes. But when we conſider that the inland parts  
of America are penetrated by great navigable rivers ;  
that there are a number of great lakes, communi-  
cating with each other, with thoſe rivers and with  
  
the ſea, very ſmall portages here and there ex-  
E2 cepted;  
  
E: 08 1 |  
cepted ;* that the ſea coaſts (if one may be al-  
low&#x27;d the expreſſion) of thoſe lakes only, amount  
at leaſt to 2700 miles, excluſive of the rivers run-  
ning into them; many of which are navigable to a  
great extent for boats and canoes, thro&#x27; vaſt tracts  
of country; how little likely is it that the expence  
on the carriage of our goods into thoſe countries,  
  
  
the linnen, woolen and iron wares they are at pre-  
ſent furniſn&#x27;d with by the Trench and Engliſh tra-  
ders, tho&#x27; Iudians have nothing but what they get  
by hunting, and the goods are loaded with all the  
impoſitions fraud and knavery can contrive to in-  
hance their value; will not induſtrious Engl;  
farmers, hereafter ſettled in thoſe countries, be  
much better able to pay for what ſhall be brough  
them in the way of fair commerce ? |  
  
  
wherewith to pay for the manufactures they may  
want from us? I anſwer, that the inland parts of  
  
  
the production of hemp, flax, potaſh, and above  
all ik; the ſouthern parts, may produce olive  
oil, raiſins, currans, indigo, and cochineal. Not

of the ſeveral portages altogether, amounts to but about 27  
miles. From lake Ontario into lake Erie, the land carriage at  
Nizgara is but about 12 miles. All the lakes above Niagara  
communicate by navigable ſtraits, ſo that no land carriage is

may eaſily by water or land carriage be brought to  
the ſea ports from interior America, will not ſeem  
incredible, when we reflect, that hemp formerly  
came from the Ukraine and moſt ſouthern parts of  
Ruſſia to Wologda, and down the Dwina to Arch-  
angel, and thence by a perilous navigation round  
the North Cape to England and other parts of Eu-  
rope. It now comes from the ſame country up the  
Dnieper and down the Duna with much land car-  
riage. Great part of the Rufia iron, no high-  
priced commodity, is brought 3000 miles by land  
and water from the heart of Siberia. Furs, [the  
  
  
from all parts of Siberia, even the moſt remote,  
Kamſchatſka., The ſame country furniſhes me with  
another inſtance of extended inland commerce. It  
is found worth while to keep up a mercantile com-  
munication between Peking in China and Peterſ-  
burgh. And none of theſe inſtinces of inland com-  
merce exceed thole of the courſes by which, at  
ſeveral periods, the whole trade of the Eaſt was  
carried on, Before the proſperity - of the Mama-  
luke dominion in Egypt fixed the ſtaple for the  
riches of the Eaſt at Cairo and Alexandria, whi-  
ther they were brought from the Red Sea, great  
part of thoſe commodities were carried to the cities  
of Caſhgar and Balk. This gave birth to thoſe  
  
  
ancient opulence, amidſt a people and country equal-  
ly wild. From thence thoſe goods were carried down  
  
  
up the Wolga to Aſtrachan, from whence: they were  
carried over to, and down the Don to the mouth  
of that river, and thence again the Venetians direct-  
iv, and the Genoeſe and Venetians indirectly by way  
  
of  
  
L 30 J]  
  
of Kaffa and Trebiſonde, diſpers&#x27;d them thro&#x27; the  
Mediterranean and ſome other parts of Europe.  
Another part of thoſe goods was carried over-land  
from the Wolga to the rivers Duna and Neva; from  
both they were carried to the city of Wiſbuy in the  
Baltick, ſo eminent for its ſea-laws ; and from the  
city of Ladoga on the Neva, we are told they were  
even carried by the Dwina to Archangel, and from  
thence round the North Cape.  
If iron and hemp will bear the charge of carriage  
from this in- land country, other metals will as well  
as iron; and certainly ſilk, ſince 3 d. per Ib. is not  
above 1 per cent. on the value, and amounts to  
L. 28 per ton.  
If the growths of a country find their way out  
of it, the manufactures of the countries where they  
go will infallibly find their way into it. They who  
underſtand the ceconomy and principles of manu-  
factures, know, that it is impoſſible to eſtabliſh  
them in places not populous; and even in thoſe  
that are populous, hardly poſſible to eſtabliſh  
them to the prejudice of the places already in poſſeſ-  
ſion of them. Several attempts have been made in  
France and Spain, countenanced by the government,  
to draw from us and eſtabliſh in thoſe countries, our  
hard-ware and woolen manufactures, bur withour  
ſucceſs. The reaſons are various. A manufacture  
is part of a great ſyſtem of commerce, which takes  
in conveniencies of various kinds, methods of pro-  
viding materials of all forts, machines for expedi-  
ting and facilitating labour, all the channels of cor-  
reſpondence for vending the wares, the credit and  
confidence neceſſary to found and ſupport this  
correſpondence, the mutual aid of different arti-  
zans, and a thouſand other particulars, which time  
and long experience have gradually eſtabliſhed. A  
part of ſuch a ſyſtem cannot ſupport itſelf without  
the whole, and before the whole can be obtained  
EP the  
  
1  
the part periſhes. Manufactures where they are in  
perfection, are carried on by a multiplicity of han d,  
each of which is expert only in his own part, no  
one of them a maſter of the whole; and if by any  
  
  
without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the ex-  
tremeſt difficulty to perſuade a compleat ſet of  
  
  
leave their country together and ſettle in a foreign  
land. Some of the idle and drunken may  
be enticed away, bur theſe only diſappoint  
their employers, and ſerve to diſcourage the under-  
taking. If by royal munificence, and an expence  
that the profits of:the trade alone would not bear,  
a compleat ſet of good and ſkilful hands are col-  
lected and carried over, they find ſo much of the  
ſyſtem imperfect, ſo many things wanting to carry  
on the trade to advantage, ſo many difficulties to  
overcome, and the knot of hands fo eaſily broken,  
by death, diſſatisfaction and deſertion, that they and  
their employers are diſcouraged together, and the  
project vaniſhes into ſmoke. Hence it happens,  
that eſtabliſhed manufactures are hardly ever loſt,  
  
  
rior fault in manners or government; a bad police  
  
»”  
  
  
  
ſingle inſtance in hiſtory of the contrary, where  
  
  
ſometimes ſtart up in a new place, but are general-  
ly ſupported like exotic plants at more expence  
than they are worth for any thing eee  
until theſe new ſeats become the refuge  
nufacturers driven from the old ones. The con-  
queſt of Conſtantinople and final reduction of the  
_ Greek empire, diſperſed many curious manufactu-  
: | rers  
  
  
( 32 ]  
  
rers into different parts of Chriſtendom. The for-  
mer conqueſts of its provinces had before done the  
ſame. The loſs of liberty in Verona, Milan, Florence,  
Piſa, Piſtoia, and other great cities of 7taly, drove  
the manufacturers of woolen cloth into Spain and  
Flanders. The latter firſt loſt their trade and ma-  
nufacturers to Antwerp and the cities of Brabant,  
from whence by perfecution for religion they were  
ſent into Holland and England. The civil wars  
during the minority of Charles the firſt of Spain,  
which ended in the loſs of the liberty of their great  
towns, ended too in the loſs of the manufactures  
of Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, Medina del campo, &amp;c.  
The revocation of the edict of Nantes, communi-  
cated, to all the Proteſtant parts of Europe, the  
paper, filk, and other valuable manufactures of  
France, almoſt peculiar at that time to that country,  
and till then in vain attempted elſewhere.  
  
To be convinc&#x27;d that it is not ſoil and climate,  
or even freedom from taxes, that determines the  
refidence of manufacturers, we need only turn our  
eyes on Holland, where a multitude of manufac-  
tures are ſtill carried on (perhaps more than on the  
ſame extent of territory any where in Europe) and  
fold on terms upon which they cannot be had in  
any other part of the world. And this too is true  
of thoſe growths, which by their nature and the  
labour required to raiſe them, come the neareſt to  
manufactures. |  
  
As to the common-place objection to the North  
American ſettlements, that they are in the ſame  
climate and their produce the ſame as that of Eng-  
land; in the firſt place it is not true; it is particular-  
ly not ſo of the countries now likely to be added to  
our ſettlements ; and of our preſent colonies, the  
products, lumber, tobacco, rice and indigo, great  
  
articles of commerce do not interfere with the pro-  
5 | ducts  
  
little. Even the trade between the different parts  
of theſe Britiſh iftands, is greatly ſuperiot to that  
between England and all the V eſt-India iſlands put  
together. „ ee WY  
If I have been ſucceſsful in proving that a con-  
ſiderable commerce may and will ſubſiſt between  
us and our future moſt inland ſettlements in NortÞ  
America, notwithſtanding their diſtance, I have  
more than half proved no other inconveniency will  
ariſe from theit diſtance. Many men in ſuch a  
country, mult, ©, know,” maſt © think,” and muſt  
care about the country they chiefly trade with;  
The juridical and other connections of government  
are yet a faſter hold than even commercial ties, and  
ſpread directly and indirectly far and wide. Buſi-  
neſs to be ſolicited and cauſes depending, create a  
eat. intercourſe even where private property is not  
divided in different countries, yet this diviſion will  
always ſubſiſt where different countries are ruled by  
the ſame government. Where a man has landed  
property both in the mother country and a pro-  
vince, he will almoſt always live in the mother  
country: this, though there were no trade, is  
ſingly a ſufficient gain. It is ſaid, that Ireland  
pays near a million Sterling annually to its abſentees  
in England: The ballance of trade from Spain or  
even Portugal is ſcarcely equal to this. |  
Let it not be ſaid we have no abſentees from  
North- America, There are many to the writer&#x27;s  
knowledge; and if there are at preſent but few of  
them that diſtinguiſh themſelves here by great ex-  
pence, it is owing to the mediocrity of fortune a-  
mong the inhabitants of Nerthern colonies;  
  
  
N pdp  
a more equal diviſion of landed property, than in  
the Weſt - India iſlands, ſo that there are as yet but  
  
  
ſelves, are they worſe ſubjects than they would be  
if they lived idly in England? Great merit is aſ-  
ſumed for the gentlemen of the Vet- Indies , on  
the ſcore of their reſiding and ſpending their mo-  
ney in England. 1 would not depreciate that me-  
rit; it is conliderable, for they might, if the  
  
pleaſed ſpend their money in France : but the dif.  
terence between their ſpending it here and at home  
  
  
they are here, but the produce and manufactures of  
this country; and would they not do the ſame if  
they were at home? Is it of any great impor-  
tance to the Exgliſb farmer, whether the Meſt- India  
gentleman comes to London and eats his beef, pork,  
and tongues, freſh, or has them brought to him  
in the Veſt- Indies ſalted ; whether he cats his En-  
gliſb cheeſe and butter or drinks his Engliſh ale at  
London or in Barbadoes? Is the clothier&#x27;s, or the  
mercer&#x27;s, or the cutler&#x27;s, or the toy-man&#x27;s profit  
leſs, for their goods being worn and conſumed by  
the ſame perſons reſiding on the other ſide of the  
ocean? Would not the profits of the merchant  
and mariner be rather greater, and ſome addition  
made to our navigation, ſhips and ſeamen? If  
the North American gentleman ſtays in his own  
country, and lives there in that degree of luxury  
  
  
factures, that his fortune entitles him to; may not  
his example (from the imitation of ſuperiors ſo na-  
tural to mankind) ſpread the uſe of thoſe manufac-  
tures among hundreds of families around him, and

: N  
occaſion a much greater demand for them, than  
it would do if he ſnould remove and live in London?  
However this may be, if in our views of im-  
mediate advantage, it ſeems preferable that the  
gentlemen of large fortunes in North America  
ſhould reſide much in England, tis what may ſurely  
be expected as faſt as ſuch fortunes are acquired  
there. Their having “ colleges. of their own for  
&lt;* the education of their youth,“ will not prevent  
it: A little knowledge and learning acquired, in-  
creaſes the appetite for more, and will make the  
converſation of the learned on -this {ide the water  
more ſtrongly deſired. Ireland has its univerſity  
likewiſe ; yet this does not prevent the immenſe  
pecuniary benefit we receive from that kingdom.  
And there will always be in the conveniencies of  
life, the politeneſs, the pleaſures, the magnificence  
of the reigning country, many other attractions be-  
ſides thoſe of learning, to draw men of ſubſtance  
there, where they can, apparently at leaſt,  
have the beſt bargain of happineſs for their  
money. 2 it |  
  
Our trade to the Veſt-India iſlands is undoubt-  
_ edly a valuable one: but whatever is the amount  
of it, it has long been at a ſtand. Limited as our  
ſugar planters are by the ſcantineſs of territory, they  
cannot increaſe much beyond their preſent number;  
and this is an evil, as I ſhall ſhow hereafter, that  
will be little helped by our. keeping Guadaloupe.  
The trade to our Northern Colomes, is not only  
greater, but yearly increaſing with the increaſe of  
people : and even in a greater proportion, as the  
people increaſe in wealth and the ability of ſpend-  
ing as well as in numbers, I have already ſaid,  
that our people in the Northern Colonies double in  
about 25 years, excluſive of the acceſſion of ſtran-

trade,  
  
[ 37 ]  
  
markable for the plain frugal manner of living of  
its inhabitants, and the moſt ſuſpected of carrying  
on manufactures on account of the number of Ger-  
man artizans, who are known to have tranſplanted  
themſelves into that country, though even theſe,  
in truth, when they come. there, generally apply  
themſelves to agriculture as the ſureſt ſupport and  
moſt advantageous employment. By this account  
it appears, that the exports to that province have  
in 28 years, increaſed nearly in the proportion of  
17 to 1; whereas the people themſelves, who by  
other authentic accounts appear to double their  
numbers (the ſtrangers who ſettle there included)

creaſed in a greater proportion than as 4 to 1:  
the additional demand then, and conſumption of  
goods from England, of 13 parts in 17 more than  
the additional number would require, muſt be  
owing to this, that the people having by their in-  
duſtry mended their circumſtances, are enabled to  
indulge themſelves in finer cloaths, better furni-  
ture, and a more general uſe of all our manufac-  
tures than heretofore. In fact, the occaſion for

Thus much as to the apprehenſion. of our colo-  
mes becoming uſeleſs to us. I ſhall next conſider  
the other . ſuppoſition, that their growth may ren-  
der them dangerous. Of this I own, I have not  
the leaſt conception, when I conſider that we have  
already fourteen ſeparate governments on the ma-  
ritime coaſt of the continent, and if we extend our  
ſettlements ſhall probably have as many more be-  
hind them on the inland fide. Thoſe we now have,  
are not only under different governors, but have dif-  
ferent forms of government, different laws, different  
intereſts, and ſome of them different religious per-  
ſuaſtons and different manners. Their jealouſy of  
each other is ſo great that however neceſſary an  
union of the colonies has long been, for their com-  
mon defence and ſecurity ag inſt their enemies, and  
how ſenſible ſoever each colony has been of that  
neceſſity, yet they have never been able to effect  
ſuch an union among themſelves, nor even to a-  
gree in requeſting the mother country to eſtabliſh it  
for them. Nothing but the immediate command  
of the crown has been able to produce even the  
imperfect union but Jately ſeen there, of the forces  
of ſome colonies, If they could not agree to unite |  
for their defence againſt the French and Indians,  
who were perpetually haraſſing their ſettlements,  
burning their villages, and murdering their people ;  
can it reaſonably be ſuppoſed there is any danger  
of their uniting againſt their own nation, which  
protects and encourages them, with which they  
have ſo many connections and ties of blood, in-  
tereſt and affection, and which tis well known they  
all love much more than they love one another ? In  
ſhort, there are ſo many cauſes that muſt operate  
to prevent it, that I will venture to ſay, an ugjon  
amongſt them for ſuch a purpoſe is not merely im-  
probable, it is impoſſible; and if the union of

I a

the whole is impoſſible, the attempt of a part  
muſt be madneſs : as thoſe colonies that did not  
join the rebellion, would join the mother country

When I fay fuch an union 1s impoſſible, I mean  
without the moſt grievous tyranny and oppreſſion;  
People who have property in a country which they  
may loſe, and 3 which they may endan-  
ger; are generally diſpogd to be quiet; and even  
to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the  
government is mild and juſt, while important civil  
and religious rights are ſecure, ſuch ſubjects will  
be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not riſe,  
but when the winds blow. What fuch an admini-  
ſtration as the Duke of Alva&#x27;s in the Netherlands,  
might produce, I know not; but this I think I  
have a right to deem impoſſible. And yet there  
were two very manifeſt differences between that  
caſe, and outs, and both are in our favour. The  
firſt, that Spain had already united the feventeen  
provinces under one viſible. government, tho* the  
| Rates continued independent: The ſecond, that the  
inhabitants of thoſe provinces were of a nation, not  
only different from, but utterly unlike the Spa-.  
niards. Had the Netherlands been peopled from  
Spain, the worft of oppreſſion had probably not  
provoked them to wiſh a ſeparation of govern-  
ment. It might and probably would have rained  
the country, but would never have produced an  
independent ſovereignty. In fact, neither the very  
worlt of governments, the worſt of politicks in  
the laſt century, nor the total abolition of their re-  
maining liberty, in the provinces of Spain itſelf, in  
the preſent, have produced any independency that  
could be ſupported. The ſame may be obſerved  
of France, And let it not be ſaid that the neigh-  
bourhood of thefe to the feat of government has

ſea continues, the banks of the Ohio, (in point of  
ealy and expeditious conveyance of troops) are  
nearer to London, than the remote parts of France.  
and Spain to their reſpective capitals ; and much  
nearer than Connaught and Ulſter were in the days  
of Queen Elizabeth, No body foretels the diſſo-  
lution of the Ruſia ian monarchy from its extent, yet  
I will venture to fay, the caftern parts of it are al-  
ready much more inacceſſible from Peter/burgh,  
  
than the country on the Maſipi is from London;  
I mean. more men, in leſs time, might be con-  
veyed the latter than the former diſtance.” The  
rivers Oby, Feneſea and Lena,” do not facilitate the  
communication halt fo well by their courle, nor are  
they half ſo practicable as the American rivers. To  
this I ſhall only add the obſervation of Machiavel,  
in his Prince, that a government ſeldom long pre-  
ſerves its dominion over thoſe who are foreigners  
to it ; who on the other hand fall with great eaſe,  
  
and continue inſeparably annex d to the govern-  
ment of their own nation, which he proves by the  
fate of the Engliſh conqueſts in France.  
  
Yet with all theſe diſadvantages, ſo difficult i is  
it to overturn an eſtabliſhed government, that it  
was not without the aſſiſtance of France and Enp-  
land, that the United Provinces ſupported them-  
ſelves :- which teaches us, that if the viſionary dan-  
ger of independence 1n our colonies is to be feared,  
nothing | is more likely to render it ſubſtantial than  
the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the  
ſovereign government, capable of giving either  
aid or an aſylum, as the event ſhall require. Yet  
againſt even theſe diſadvantages, did Spain pre-  
ſerve almoſt ten provinces, merely thro” their  
want of union, which indeed could never have

The Romans well underſtood that pour which  
teaches the ſecurity ariſing to the chief government  
from ſeparate ſtates among the governed, when they  
reſtored the liberties of the ſtates of Greece, (op-

did not even name a governor. Independence of

call themſelves ſovereigns ; they ſet no value on the  
title; they were contented with poſſeſſing the  
thing; and poſſeſs it they did, even without a ſtand-  
ing army. What can be a ſtronger proof of the  
ſecurity of their poſſeſſion ? And yet by a policy ſi-

the molt likely means of driving them into the  
arms of the French, who can invite them by an  
offer of that ſecurity their own government chu-  
ſes not to afford them? I would not be thought to  
in{ſnuate that the remarker wants humanity. I know  
how little many good-natured perſons are affected by  
the diſtreſſes of people ar a diſtance and whom they  
do not know. There are even thoſe, who, bein  
preſent, can ſympathize ſincerely with the nh, of

and yet can read of the ſinking of a city in Syria  
with very little concern. It it be, after all, thought  
neceſſary to check the growth of our colonies, give  
me leave to propoſe a method leſs cruel. It. is a  
method of which we have an example in ſcripture,  
The murder of huſbands, of. wives, of brothers,  
ſiſters, and children whoſe pleaſing ſociety bas  
been for ſome time enjoyed, affects deeply the re-  
ſpective ſurviving relations: but grief for the death  
of a child juſt born is ſhort and eaſily ſupported.  
The meiboc 1 mean is that which was dictated by  
the Egyptian policy, when the © infinite increaſe”  
of the children of Iſrael was apprehended as dan-  
gerous to the ſtate.* Let an act of parliament,  
an be made, enjoining the colony midwives to  
ſtifle in the birth every third or fourth child. By

But all this debate about the propriety or im-  
propriety of keeping or reſtoring Canada, is poſſi-  
bly too early. We have taken the capital indeed,  
but the country 1s yet far from being in our peſ-  
ſeſlon; and perhaps never will be: for if our  
Mrs are perſuaded by ſuch counſellors as  
thg remarker, that the French there are © not the  
« worſt of neighbours,” and that if we had con-  
quered Canada, we ought for our own ſakes to re-  
{tore it, as a check to the growth of our colonies, 1  
am then afraid we ſhall never take it. For there  
are many ways of ayoiding the completion of the  
conqueſt, that will be leſs exceptionable and leſs o-  
dious than the giving it up.  
  
The objection I have often heard, that if we had  
Canada, we could not people it, without draining  
Britain of its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance  
of the nature of population in new countries,  
When we firſt began to colonize in America, it was

it is not now neceſſary that we ſhould furniſh, for .

hence, is Tufficient in ten years to fill Canada with  
double the number of Engliſb that it now has of

other Weſt India ſettlements. Yet even this con-

tion would be, who ſhould take our manufactures  
and ſupply us with ſugar, and put us to no ex-

where they will always think their home to be.  
  
Beſides this conſumption of Britiſh manufac-  
tures, much is ſaid of the benefit we ſhall have  
from the&#x27; ſituation of Guadalupe, and we are told  
of a trade to the Caraccas and Spaniſh Main. In

not ſo well ſituated for that of the windward coaſt,  
as Tobago and St. Lucia, which in this as well as  
other reſpects, would be more valuable poſſeſſions,  
and which, I doubt not; the peace will ſecure to us.  
Nor is it nearly ſo well ſituated for that of the reſt of  
the Spaniſh Main as Jamaica. As to the greater  
ſafety of our trade by the poſſeſſion of Guadalupe,  
experience has convinced us that in reducing a  
ſingle iſland, or even more, we ſtop the privatcer-  
ing buſineſs but little. Privateers ſtill ſubſiſt, in e-  
qual if not greater numbers, and carry the veſſels  
into Martinico which before it was more conveni-  
  
ent to carry into Guadalupe. Had we all the Ca-  
  
ribbees, it is true, they would in thoſe parts be  
without ſhelter. Yet upon the whole I ſuppoſe it  
to be a doubtful point and well worth conſidera-  
tion, whether our obtaining poſſeſſion of all the Ca-  
  
ribbees, would be more than a temporary benefit, as  
  
it would neceſſarily ſoon fill the French part of Hif-  
paniola with French inhabitants, and thereby ren-  
der it five times more valuable in time of peace,  
  
and little leſs than impregnable in time of war;  
and would probably end in a few years in the unit-  
  
ing the whole of that great and fertile iſland under a  
French government. It is agreed on all hands, that  
our conqueſt of S. Chriftophers, and driving the  
French from thence, firſt furniſh&#x27;d Hiſpaniola with  
  
ſkilful and ſubſtantial planters, and was conſequently  
the firſt occaſion of its preſent opulence. On the o-  
  
ther hand, I will hazard an opinion, that valuable  
  
as the French poſſeſſions in the Weſt Indies are, and  
undeniable the advantages they derive from them,  
  
there is ſomewhat to be weighed in the oppoſite  
ſcale. They cannot at preſent make war with  
England, without expoling thoſe advantages while  
divided among the numerous iſlands they now  
  
have, much more than they would, were ay por

ſeſſed of St. Domingo only; their own ſhare of which  
would, if well cultivated, grow more ſugar, than  
is now grown in all their Jef India illands  
I have before ſaid I do not deny the utility of  
the conqueſt, or even of our future poſſeſſion of  
Guadalupe, if not bought too dear. The trade of  
the Weſt Indies is one of our moſt valuable trades,  
Our poſſeſſions there deſerve our greateſt care and  
attention. So do thoſe of North America, I ſhall  
not enter into the invidious taſk of comparing their  
  
  
very diſagreeable one, to run thro* every thing  
material on this head. It is enough to our preſent |  
point, if I have ſhown, that the value of North  
America is capable of an immenſe increaſe, by an  
acquiſition and meaſures, that muſt neceſſarily  
have an effect the direct contrary of what we have  
been induſtriouſly taught to fear; and that Guada-  
lupe is, in point of advantage, but a very ſmall ad-  
dition to our Feſt India poſſeſſions, rendered many  
ways leſs valuable to us than it is to the French, who  
will probably ſet more value upon it than upon a  
country that is much more valuable to us than to  
them. 3 :  
There is a great deal more to be ſaid on all the  
parts of theſe ſubjects; but as it would carry me  
into a detail that I fear would tire the patience of  
my readers, and which I am not without appre-  
henſions I have done already, I ſhall reſerve what  
remains till I dare venture again on the indulgence.  
of the public. *

&#x27; CONSIDERED  
  
  
Have peruſed with no ſmall pleaſure the Letter  
i addreſſed to Two Great Men, and the Remarks  
on that letter, It is not merely from the beauty,  
the force and perſpicuity of expreſſion, or the  
  
  
pamphlets, that my pleaſure chiefly ariſes; it is ra-  
ther from this, that I have lived to ſee ſubjects of  
  
the greateſt importance to this nation publickly  
diſcuſſed without party views, or party heat, with  
decency and politeneſs, and with no other warmth  
  
  
our king and country may inſpire ;------and this by  
writers whoſe underſtanding (however they may  
differ from each other) appears not unequal to their  
candour and the uprightneſs of their intention.  
But, as great abilities have not always the beſt  
information, there are, I apprehend, in&#x27;the Remarks  
ſome opinions not well founded, and ſome miſ-  
takes of ſo important a nature, as to render a few |  
  
  
tormation of the pub. TIE ET  
The author of the Letter, who muſt be every way  
beſt able to ſupport his own ſentiments, will, F  
hope, excuſe me, if I ſeem officiouſly to interfere ;  
when he conſiders, that the ſpirit of patriotiſm, 15  
„„ dir; „ „  
  
E  
  
that his long ſilence ſince the Remarks appeared  
has made us . of ſeeing the ſubject farther  
diſcuſſed by his maſterly hand. The ingenious and  
  
candid remarker, too, who muſt have been miſled  
  
  
miſlead others, will certainly, ſince he declares he  
  
  
the weakeſt effort to prevent it.  
  
  
minds of the people may poſſibly be of conſequence  
in publick affairs, it muſt be fit to ſet thoſe opinions  
right. If there is danger, as the remarker ſuppoſes, that  
extravagant expectations may embarraſs a vir-  
tuous and able miniſtry,” and“ render the nego-  
ciation for peace a work of infinite difficulty; +  
there is no leſs danger that expectations too low,  
  
  
trary effect, may make even a virtuous and able  
miniſtry leſs anxious, and leſs attentive to the ob-  
  
  
the nation are eſſentially concerned; and the peo-  
ple leſs hearty in ſupporting ſuch a miniſtry and its  
meaſures,  
  
The people of this nation are indeed reſpectable,  
  
  
ſtanding and their publick ſpirit: they manifeſt  
  
  
and an 3 and able adminiſtration; the latter  
  
  
granted in parliament unanimouſly, and paid  
  
  
And Iince to this ſpirit and theſe ſupplies our  
S victories and ſucceſſes” 4 have in great meaſure  
a been

been owing, is it quite right, is it generous to ſay,  
with the remarker, that the people © had no ſhare  
  
  
mean, even where he ſpeaks of the madneſs of the  
  
  
feeble and impotent, arm&#x27;d as the government of  
this country at preſent is, to © over-rule,” * even in  
the ſlighteſt inſtances, the © virtue and moderation”  
  
  
While the war continues, its final event is quite  
uncertain. The Victorious of this year may be the  
Vanquiſhed of the next. It may therefore be too  
early to ſay, what advantages we ought abſolutely  
to inſiſt on, and make the /ne quibus non of a peace,  
If the neceſſity of our affairs ſhould oblige us to  
accept of terms leſs advantageous than our preſent  
ſucceſſes ſeem to promiſe us, an intelligent people,  
as ours is, muſt ſee that neceſſity, and will ac-  
quieſce. But as a peace, when it is made, may be  
made haſtily; and as the unhappy continuance of  
the war affords us time to conſider, among ſeveral  
advantages gain&#x27;d or to be gain&#x27;d, which of them  
may be moſt for our intereſt to retain, if ſome and  
not all may poſſibly be retained ; I do not blame  
the public diſquiſition of theſe points, as premature  
or uſeleſs. Light often ariſes from a colliſion of  
opinions, as fire from flint and ſteel ; and if we  
can obtain the benefit of the light, without danger  
from the heat ſometimes produc&#x27;d by CO  
why ſhould we diſcourage it ?  
  
Suppoſing then, that heaven may ſtill continue  
  
  
this juſt war may put it in &#x27;our power to retain  
  
  
let us conſider whether we are to confine ourſelves  
  
  
which

which we began the war.““ This the remarker  
feems to think right, when the queſtion relates to  
Canada, properly fo called, it having never been  
© mentioned as one of thoſe. objects in any of our  
&lt; memorials or declarations, or in any national or

aada would be a real advantage to us, we may de-  
mand it under his ſecond head, as an indemniſi-  
cation for the charges incurred” in recovering our  
  
  
dation.  
That © our claims before the war were large  
  
  
it ſeems a clear point with the ingenious remarker,  
  
  
trary opinion, and ſhall preſently give my rea-  
ſons. But firſt let me obſerve, that we did not  
make thoſe claims becauſe they were large enough  
for ſecurity, but becauſe we could rightfully claim  
no more. Advantages gained in the courſe of this  
  
war, may increaſe the extent of our rights. Our  
claims before the war contain&#x27;d ſome ſecurity ; but

ſturbing our trade ; and the difficulty on our parts  
of preventing encroachments that may poſſibly  
exiſt many years without coming to our know-

cc arguments employ&#x27;d concerning a ſecurity for a  
  
  
c equally cogent for calling for the ſame ſecurity  
&amp; in Europe.”* Ona little farther reflection, he  
muſt I think be ſenſible, that the circumſtances of  
the two caſes are widely different. Here we are  
ſeparated by the beſt and cleareft of boundaries,  
the ocean, and we have people in or near every part  
of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon  
us, by building a fort, even in the obſcureſt cor-  
ner of theſe iſlands, muſt therefore be known and  
prevented immediately. The aggreſſors alſo muſt  
be known, and the nation they belong to would be  
accountable for their aggreſſion. In America it is  
  
uite otherwiſe. A vaſt wilderneſs thinly or ſcarce

at a ſmall expence, that may coſt us an age and a

this. But what is ſtill worſe, the wide extended  
  
  
induſtry of prieſts, fimiliarity of ſuperſtitions, and  
frequent family alliances. Theſe are eaſily, and  
have been continually, inſtigated to fall upon and

therefore not accountable. Surely circumſtances  
ſo widely different may reaſonably authoriſe diffe-  
rent demands of ſecurity in America, from ſuch as  
are uſual or neceſſary in Europe.  
  
The remarker, however, thinks, that our real  
dependance for keeping France or any other na-  
« tion true to her engagements, muſt not be in  
« demanding ſecurities which no nation whilſt inde-  
«© pendent can give, but on our own ſtrength and our  
% own viligance.” * No nation that has carried  
on a war with diſadvantage, and is unable to con-  
tinue it, can be ſaid, under ſuch circumſtances, to  
be independent ; and while either ſide thinks itſelf  
  
  
is no man in his ſenſes, but will, ceteris paribus,  
prefer an indemnification that is a cheaper and  
more effectual ſecurity than any other he can think  
of. Nations in this ſituation demand and cede  
countries by almoſt every treaty of peace that is  
made. The French part of the iſland of St. Cri-  
 flopher&#x27;s was added to Great Britain in circumſtan-  
ces .altogether ſimilar to thoſe in which a few  
months may probably place the country of Canada.  
Farther ſecurity has always been deemed a motive  
with a conqueror to be leſs moderate; and even  
the vanquiſh&#x27;d infiſt upon ſecurity as a reaſon for  
demanding what they acknowledge they could not  
otherwiſe properly aſk. The ſecurity of the frontier  
of France on the ſide of the Netherlands, was always  
conſidered, in the negotiation that began at Getruy-  
denburgh, and ended with that war. For the ſame  
reaſon they demanded and had Cape Breton. But

In ſhort, ſecurity and quiet of princes and ſtates  
have ever been deemed ſufficient reaſons, when

ſuch &quot;diſpoſition has never been looked on as  
want of moderation. It has always been the  
foundation of the moſt general treaties. &#x27; The ſe-  
curity of Germany was the argument for yielding  
conſiderable. poſſeſſions there to the Swedes : and

France as little as any other ceſſion; and from its

ſent war teaches us, that diſputes ariſing in A.

remain in Canada and Lonifiana, fix the bounda-

border on each other for more than 1500 miles.

may, I acknowledge be of uſe to obtain the firſt  
kind of ſecurity: but as thoſe ſituations are far ad-  
vanc&#x27;d beyond the inhabitants, the expence of  
maintaining and ſupplying the garriſons, will be  
very great, even in time of full peace, and immenſe

The ſecond kind of ſecurity, will not be obtain-

„Although the Indians live ſcattered, as a hunter&#x27;s life re-  
* quires, they may be collected together from almoſt any dif-  
tance, as they can find their ſubſiſtence from their gun in  
their travelling. But let the number of the Indians be what  
it will, they are not formidable merely on account of their  
numbers; there are many other circumſtances that give them  
a great advantage over the Eugliſ. The Engliſb inhabitants,  
though numerous, are extended over a large tract of land,  
| 500 leagues in length on the ſea- ſnore; and altho? ſome of  
their trading towns are thick ſettled, their ſettlements in  
the country towns muſt be at a diſtance from each other : be-  
ſides, that in a new country, where lands are cheap, people  
are fond of acquiring large tracts to themſelves ; and there-  
fore in the out ſettlements, they muſt be more remote: and  
as the people that move out are generally poor, they fit down,  
either where they can eaſieſt procure land, or ſooneſt raiſe a  
ſubſiſtence. Add to this, that the Zng/iþ have fixed ſettled  
habitations, the eaſieſt and ſhorteſt paſſages to which the  
Indians, by conſtantly hunting in the woods, are perfectly  
well acquainted with; whereas the Engliſb know little or  
nothing of the Indian country, nor of the paſſages thro? the  
woods that lead to it. The Indian way of making war is by  
ſudden attacks upon expoſed places; and as ſoon as they  
have done miſchief, they retire, - and either go home by the  
ſame or ſome different rout, as they think ſafeſt; or go to  
ſome other place at a diſtance, to renew their ſtroke. If a ſuf-  
ficient party ſhould happily be ready to purſue them, it is a  
great chance, whether in a country, conſiſting of woods and  
ſwamps, which the Exgliſb are not acquainted with, the ene-  
my do not lie in ambuſh for them in ſome convenient place,  
and from thence deſtroy them. If this ſhould not be the caſe,  
but the Engliſb ſhould purſue them, as ſoon as they have

which they are brought up from their infancy, they pre-

who are adroit at fortifying, will likewiſe ere&amp;  
forts in the moſt advantageous places of the coun-

We know by the experience of this war, how  
extremely difficult it is to march an army throꝰ the  
American woods, with its neceſſary cannon and  
ſtores, ſufficient to reduce a very light fort. The  
accounts at the treaſury will tell you what amazing

Point. While the French retain their influence

I ſhould indeed think it lets te Whether  
  
only the ſecurity of poſſeſſion in our colonies. I en-  
tirely agree with the Remarker, that we are ah  
  
North America a far greater continental as w  
  
de as naval power; and that only cowardice or  
ignorance can ſubject our colonies there to a French  
conqueſt. But for the ſame reaſon Idiſagree with him  
  
&amp; blood and treaſure has been expended,” as he in-  
timates, in the &quot;cauſe of the colonies,” and that we  
  
ts are making conqueſts for them : i yet I believe  
this is too common an error. I do not ſay they are  
altogether unconcerned in the event. The ina  
bitants of them are, in common with the other  
ſubjects of Great Britain, anxious for the glory of  
  
her crown, the extent -f her power and com-  
merce, the welfare and future repoſe of the whole  
Britiſh people. They could not therefore but  
take a large ſhare in the affronts offered to Bri- 7  
Zain, and have been animated with a truely Britiſh  
ſpirit to exert themſelves beyond their ſtrength,  
  
and againſt their evident intereſt. Yet fo unfor-  
tunate have they been, that their virtue has made  
againſt them; for upon no better foundation  
than this, have they been fuppoſed the authors of  
a war carried on for their advantage only, It is a  
great miſtake to imagine that the American coun-  
try in queſtion between Great Britain and France,  
is claimed as the property of any individuals or pub-  
lick body in America, or that the poſſeſſion of it by 3  
Creat- Britain, is likely, in any lucrative view, to  
  
redound at all to the advantage of any perſon there.

On the other our the bulk of the inhabitants of  
  
North America are land-owners, whoſe lands are  
inferior in value to thoſe of Britain, only by the  
want of an equal number of people. It is true the  
acceſſion of the large territory claimed before the  
war began, eſpecially if that be ſecured by the poſ-  
ſeſſion of Canada, will tend to the. increaſe of the  
Britiſh ſubjects, faſter than if they had been con-  
fin&#x27;d within the mountains: yet the increaſe within  
the mountains only, would evidently make the  
  
  
Britain, much ſooner than it can be expected when  
our people are ſpread over a country ſix times as  
large. I think this is the only point of light in  
which this queſtion is to be viewed, and is the  
only one in which any of the colonies are con-  
cerned. No colony, no poſſeſſor of lands in any  
colony, therefore wiſhes for conqueſts, or can be  
benefited by them, otherwiſe than as they may be a  
means of ſecuring peace on their borders. No  
conſiderable advantage has reſulted to the colonies  
by the conqueſts of this war, or can reſult from  
confirming them by the peace, but what they muſt

found means to murder thouſands of their people,  
and unſettle a great part of their country. Much  
more able will it be to ſtarve the growth of an in-  
fant ſettlement. Canada has alſo found means to  
make this nation ſpend two or three millions a  
year in America; and a people, how ſmall ſever,  
that in their preſent ſituation, can do this as often

It will be a conqueſt for the whole, and all our

A reader of the marks mas be. apt to A 1 if  
this writer would have us reſtore Canada on prin-  
ciples of moderation, how can we conſiſtent with  
thoſe principles, retain Guadaloupe, which he repre-  
ſents of ſo much greater value! I will endeavour  
to explain this, becauſe by doing it I ſhall have an  
  
  
of the anſwer to the intereſted application I have  
juſt ſuppoſed. The author then is only apparently:  
  
  
obtain the credit of moderation by reſtoring Cana  
da, it is well: but we ſhould, however, reſtore it  
at all events; ; becauſe it would not only be of no  
uſe to us, but the poſſeſſion, of it (in his opinion)  
&lt; may in its conſequence be dangerous . as how ?  
Why, plainly, (at length it comes out) if the French  
are not left there to check. the growth of our colo-  
nies, © they will extend themſelves almoſt without

England, living wholly on their own labour, and  
&lt; in proceſs of time knowing little and enquiring  
&amp; little about the mother country.” In ſhort, ac-  
cording to this writer, our preſent colonies are  
large enough and numerous enough, and the French  
ought to be left in North America to prevent their  
increaſe, leſt they become not N uſeleſs but  
  
dangerous to Britain. 1

I agree with the gentleman, that with Canada in our  
poſſeſſion, our people in America will increaſe amaz-  
ingly. I know that their common rate of increaſe,  
where they are not moleſted by the enemy, is doubl-  
ing their numbers every twenty- five years by natural  
generation only, excluſive of the acceſſion of fo-  
reigners.* I think this increaſe continuing; would  
probably in a century more, make the number of  
Britiſh ſubjects on that ſide the water more nume-  
.  rous than they now are on this; but I am far from  
entertaining, on that account, any fears of their be-  
coming either uſeleſs or dangerous to us; and I look  
  
on thoſe fears to be merely imaginary and without  
any probable foundation. The remarker is reſerv&#x27;din  
giving his reaſons, as in his opinion this “ is not  
  
a fit ſubject for diſcuſſion.” I ſhall give mine, be-  
cauſe I conceive it a ſubject neceſſary to be diſ-  
cuſſed ; and the rather, as thoſe fears, how:ground-  
leſs and chimerical ſoever, may, by poſſeſſing the  
multitude, poſſibly induce the ableſt miniſtry to  
conform to them againſt their own judgment, and  
thereby prevent the aſſuring to the Britih name and  
nation, a ſtability and permanency that no man ac-

The reaſon of this greater increaſe in America than in Eu-  
rope, is, that in old ſettled countries, all trades, farms, offices,  
and employments are full, and many people refrain marrying  
till they ſee an opening, in which they can ſettle themſelves,  
with a reaſonable proſpect of maintaining a family: but in 4  
merica, it being eaſy to obtain land which with moderate la-  
bour will afford ſubſiſtence and ſomething to ſpare, people  
marry more readily and earlier in life, whence ariſes a nume-  
rous offspring and the ſwift population of thoſe countries. Tis  
a common error that we cannot fill our provinces or increaſe.

our American poſſeſſions opened the pleaſing pro-  
&quot;The remarker thinks that our people in Ame-  
rica, . finding no check from Canada, would ex-  
&lt; tend themſelves almoſt without bounds into the  
ce inland parts, and increaſe infinitely from all  
© cauſes.” The very reaſon he aſſigns for their ſo  
extending, and which is indeed the true one, their  
being © invited to it by the pleaſantneſs, fertility  
and plenty of the country, may ſatisfy us, that  
this extenſion will continue to proceed as long as  
there remains any pleaſant fertile, country within  
their reach. And if we even ſuppoſe them con-  
fin&#x27;d by the waters of the Miſſiſſipi weſtward,  
and by thoſe of St. Laurence and the lakes to the  
northward, yet ſtill we ſhall leave them room e-  
nough to increaſe, even in the ſparſe manner of  
ſettling now practis&#x27;d there, till they amount to  
perhaps a hundred millions of fouls. This muſt  
take ſome centuries to fulfil, and in the mean time,  
this nation muſt neceſſarily ſupply them with the  
manufactures they conſume, becauſe the new ſettlers  
will be employed in agriculture, and the new ſettle-  
ments will ſo continually draw off the ſpare hands  
from the old, that our preſent colonies will not,  
during the period we have mention&#x27;d, find them-  
ſelves in a condition to manufacture even for their  
own inhabitants, to any conſiderable degree, much  
leſs for thoſe who are ſettling behind them. Thus  
our trade muſt, till that country becomes as fully  
pPeopled as England, that is, for centuries to come,  
be continually increaſing, and with it our naval  
Power; becauſe the ocean is between us and them,  
and our ſhips and ſeamen muſt increaſe as that  
trade increaſes. : LEE EE  
The human body and the political differ in  
  
his, that the firſt is limited by nature to a certain  
| | ſtature,  
  
Fd  
  
|  }  
ſtature, which, when attain&#x27;d, it cannot, ordinarily,  
exceed ; the other by better government and more  
prudent police, as well as. by change of manners  
and other circumſtances, often takes freſh ſtarts of  
growth, after being long at a ſtand ; and may add  
tenfold to the dimenfions it had for ages been con-  
fined to. The mother being of full ſtature, is in  
a few years equalled by a growing daughter: but  
in the caſe ofa mother country and her colonies,  
it is quite different. The growth of the children  
| tends to encreaſe the growth of the mother, and ſo  
the difference and ſuperiority is longer preſervd.  
Were the inhabitants of this iſland limited to their  
preſent number by any thing in nature, or by un-  
changeable circumſtances, the equality of popu-  
lation between the two countries might indeed  
ſooner come to paſs: but ſure experience in thoſe  
parts of the iſland where manufactures have been  
introduced, teaches us, that people increaſe and  
multiply in proportion as the means and facility of  
gaining a livelihood increaſe ; and that this, iſland,  
if they could be employed, is capable of ſupport-  
ing ten times its preſent number of people. In  
proportion, therefore, as the demand increaſes for  
the manufactures of Britain, by the increaſe of  
people in her colonies; the numbers of her people  
at home will increaſe, and with them the ſtrength  
as well as the wealth of the nation, For ſatisfaction  
in this point let the reader compare in his mind the  
number and force &#x27;of our preſent fleets, with, our  
fleet in queen Elizabeth&#x27;s&#x27; time before we had  
colonies. Let him compare the ancient with the  
preſent ſtate of our towns and ports on our welt-  
ern. coaſt, Mancheſter, Liverpool, Kendal, Lan-  
caſter, Glaſgow, and the countries round them,

our manufacturers ſhall occupy every part of the  
iſland where they can poſſibly be ſubſiſte.  
But, ſay the objectors, © there is a certain diſtance  
  
  
pence of carriage will put a ſtop to the fale and  
conſumption of your manufactures ; and this, with  
the difficulty of making returns for them, will  
oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for them-  
felves; of courſe, if you ſuffer your people to ex-  
tend their ſettlements beyond that diſtance, your  
people become uſeleſs. to you: and this diſtance  
is limited by ſome to 200 miles, by others to the  
Apalachian mountains. Not to inſiſt on a very  
  
  
whence a government may on occaſion draw ſup-  
plies and aids both of men of money, tho at too  
  
  
from ſome other part, is therefore to be deem&#x27;d  
uſeleſs to the whole; I ſhall endeavour to ſhow  
that theſe imaginary limits of utility, even in ne  
  
  
The inland parts of the continent of Europe are  
much farther from the ſea than the limits of ſettle-  
  
  
tradeſmen and artificers of all kinds, and the go-  
vernments there, are not all of them always fa-  
  
vourable to the « commerce of Britain, yet it is a  
- 1 |  
  
well-known fact, a _ manufactures find their  
way even into the heart of Germany. Aſk the great  
manufacturers and merchants of the Leeds, Sheffield,  
Birmingham, Mancheſter and Norwich goods, and they  
will tell you that ſome of them ſend their riders  
frequently through France or Spain and Italy, up to  
Vienna, and back through the middle and northern  
parts of Germany, to ſhow ſamples of their wares  
and collect orders, which they receive by almoſt  
every mail, to a vaſt amount. Whatever charges  
ariſe on the carriage of goods, are added to the  
value, and all paid by the conſumer. If theſe na-  
tions over whom we have no government, over  
whoſe conſumption we can have no influence, but  
what ariſes from the cheapneſs and goodneſs of our  
wares; whoſe trade, manufactures, or commercial  
connections are not ſubject to the controul of our  
laws, as thoſe of our colonies cerrainly are in ſome  
degree: I ſay, if theſe nations purchaſe and con-  
P ſuch quantities of our goods, notwithſtand-  
the remoteneſs of their ſituation from the ſea;  
= much leſs likely is it that the ſettlers in Ame-  
rica, who muſt for ages be employed in agricul-  
ture chiefly, ſhould make cheaper for themſelves _  
the goods our manufacturers at preſent ſupply.  
them with; even if we ſuppoſe the carriage five, ſix,  
or ſeven hatred miles from the ſea as difficult and  
expenſive as the like diſtance into Germany:  
whereas in the latter, the natural diſtances are fre-  
quently doubled by political obſtructions, I mean  
the intermix&#x27;d territories and claſhing intereſts of  
Princes. But when we conſider that the inland parts  
of America are penetrated by great navigable rivers;  
that there are a number of great lakes, communi-  
cating with each other, with thoſe rivers and with  
  
the ſea, &quot;Oy. ſmall | ee here and there ex-  
| 9 2  
  
„  
cepted; that the ſea coaſts (if one may be al-  
low&#x27;d the expreſſion) of thoſe lakes only, amount  
at leaſt to 2 700 miles, excluſive of the rivers run-  
ing into them; many of which are navigable to a  
great extent fon boats and canoes, thro” vaſt tracts  
of country; how little likely is it that the expence  
on the carriage of our goods into thoſe countries,  
ſhould prevent the uſe of them. If the poor In-  
dians in thoſe remote parts are now able to pay for  
the linnen, woolen and iron wares they are at pre-  
fent furniſh&#x27;d with by the French and Eugliſb tra-  
ders, tho&#x27; Indians have nothing but what they get  
by hunting, and the goods are loaded with all the  
impoſitions fraud and knavery can contrive to in-  
hance their value; will not induſtrious Engliſb  
farmers, hereafter ſettled in thoſe. countries, be  
much better able to pay for what ſhall be brought  
them in the way of fair commerce? {=  
  
If it is aſked, what can ſuch farmers raiſe,  
wherewith to pay for the manufactures they may  
want from us? I anſwer, that the inland parts of  
America in queſtion are well known to be fitted for  
the production of hemp, flax, potaſh, and above  
all, filk ; the ſouthern parts may produce olive-

the tame time at i . other commo-&#x27;  
| . That the commodities firſt mention&#x27;d,  
may eaſily by water or land carriage be brought to  
the ſea ports from interior America, will not ſeem  
incredible, when we reflect, that hemp formerly  
came from the Ukraine and moſt ſouthern parts of  
Ruſſia to Wologda, and down the Drina to Arch.  
angel, and thence by a perilous navigation round”  
the North Cape to England and other parts of Eu-  
rope. It now comes from the ſame country up the  
Dnieper and down the Duna with much land car-  
riage. Great part of the Ruſſia iron, no high-  
priced commodity, is brought 3000 miles by land  
and water from the heart of Siberia. Furs, [the  
produce too of America] are brought to Amſterdam  
from all parts of Siberia, even the moſt remote,  
Kamſchatſka. The fame country furniſhes me with  
another inſtance of extended inland commerce. It  
is found worth while to keep up a mercantile com-  
munication between Peking in China, and Peterſ-  
Burgh. And none of theſe inſtances of inland com-  
merce exceed thoſe of the courſes by which, at  
ſeveral periods, the whole trade of the Eaſt was  
carried on. - Before the proſperity of the Mama-  
/uke dominion in Egypt fixed the ſtaple for the  
riches of the Eaſt at Caire and Alexandria, whi-  
ther they were brought from the Red. Sea, great  
part of thoſe commodities were carried to the cities  
of Caſhgar and Balk. This gave birth to thoſe  
towns, that ſtill ſubſiſt upon the remains of their  
ancient opulence, amidſt a people and country equal-  
If wild. From thence thoſe goods were carried down  
the Ami, the ancient Oxus, to the Caſpian ſea, and»  
up the Wolga to Aftrachan, from whence they were  
carried over to, and down the Don to the mouth  
of that river, and thence again the Yenetians direct  
  
ly, and the Cenoeſe and Venetian indirectiy 55 wy  
  
  
Mediterranean and ſome other parts of Europe.  
  
  
from the Wolga to the rivers Duna and Neva; from  
both they were carried to the city of Wiſbuy in the  
Baltick, ſo eminent for its ſea-laws ; and from the  
  
  
thence round the North Cape.  
  
  
from this inland country, other metals will as well  
as iron; and certainly ſilk, ſince 3d. per Ib. is not  
above 1 per cent. on the value, and amounts to  
L. 28 per ton. |  
  
  
of it, the manufactures of the countries where they  
  
go, will infallibly find their way into it. They who  
  
  
them in places not populous ; and even in thoſe  
that are populous, hardly poſſible to eſtabliſn them  
to the prejudice of the places already in poſſeſ-  
ion of them. Several attempts have been made in  
France and Spain, countenanced by the Government,  
to draw from us and eſtabliſh in thoſe countries, our  
hard-ware and woolen manufactures, but without  
  
  
reſpondence for vending the wares, the credit and  
  
  
correſpondence, the mutual aid of different arti-  
zans, and a thouſand other particulars, which time  
  
and long experience have gradually eſtabliſhed. A

the part periſhes. | W where they are in  
fection, are carried on by a multiplicity of hands,  
each of which is expert only in his own part, no  
one of them a maſter of the whole; and if by any  
means ſpirited away to a foreign country, he is loſt  
without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the ex-  
tremeſt difficulty to perſuade a complete ſet of  
workmen, ſkilled in all parts of a manufactory, to  
leave their country together and ſettle in a foreign  
land. Some of the idle and drunken may  
be enticed away, but theſe only diſappoint  
their employers, and ſerve to diſcourage the under-  
taking. If by royal munificence, and an expence  
that the profits of the trade alone would not bear,  
a complete ſet, of good and&#x27; ſkilful hands are col-  
lected and carried over, they find ſo much of the  
ſyſtem imperfect, ſo many things wanting to carry  
on the trade to advantage, ſo many difficulties to  
overcome, and the knot of hands ſo. eaſily broken,  
by death, diſſatisfaction and deſertion, that they and  
their employers are diſcouraged together, and the  
project vaniſhes into ſmoke. Hence it happens,  
that eſtabliſhed manufactures are hardly ever Joſt,  
but by foreign conqueſt, or by ſome eminent inte-  
rior fault in manners or government; a bad police  
oppreſſing and diſcouraging the workmen, or reli-  
gious perſecutions driving the ſober and induſtrious  
out of the country, There is in ſhort, . ſcarce a  
ſingle inſtance in hiſtory of the contrary, where  
manufactures have once taken firm root. They  
ſometimes ſtart up in a new place, but are general  
ly ſupported like exotic ,plants at more expence  
than they are worth for any thing but curioſity,  
until theſe new ſeats: become the refuge of che ma- |

mer conqueſts of its provinces had before done the  
ſame. The loſs of liberty in Verona, Milan, Florence,  
Piſa, Piſtoia, and other great cities of Itahy, drove  
the manufacturers of woolen cloth into Spain and  
Flanders. The latter firſt loſt their trade and ma-  
nufacturers to Antwerp and the cities of Brabant,  
from whence by perſecution for&#x27; religion they were  
ſent into Holland and England, The civil wars  
during the minority of Charles the firft of Spain,  
which ended in the loſs of the liberty of their great  
towns, ended too in the loſs of the manufactures of  
Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, Medina del Campo, c.

cated, to all the | Proteſtant parts of Europe, the

To be convinced that it is not ſoil and climate,  
or even freedom from taxes, that, determines the  
reſidence of manufacturers, we need only turn our  
eyes on Holland, where a multitude of manufac-  
tures are ſtill carried on (perhaps more than on the  
ſame extent of territory any where in Europe) and  
ſold on terms upon which they cannot be had in any  
other part of the world. And this too is true  
of thoſe growths, which by their nature and the  
labour required to raiſe them, come the neareſt to  
  
-  
  
-  
  
manufactures. =  
A As to the common-place objection to the North  
American ſettlements, that they are in the ſame  
climate and their produce the ſame as that of Eug-  
land; inthe firſt place it is not true; it is particular-  
ly not ſo of the countries now likely to be added to  
our ſettlements ; and of our preſent colonies, the  
products, lumber, tobacco, rice, and indigo, great  
  
articles of commerce, do not interfere with the pro-  
- TT „„ ducts  
  
35 1 =  
  
ducts of England :, in the next place, a man muſt  
  
know very little of the trade of the world, who  
  
does not know, that the greater part of it is car-  
  
ried on between countries whoſe climate differs very  
little. Even the trade between the different parts  
of theſe Britiſh iſlands, is greatly ſuperior to that  
between England : and all the Weſt- India iſlands put  
together.  
  
If I have been ſucceſsful in proving that a con-  
ſiderable commerce may and will ſubſiſt between  
us and our future moſt inland ſettlements in North  
America, notwithſtanding their diſtance, I have  
  
more than half proved no other inconveniency will  
ariſe from their diſtance. Many men in ſuch a  
country, muſt. &lt; know,” muſt hin and muſt  
cares about the country they chiefly trade with,  
The juridical and other connections of government  
are yer a faſter hold than even commercial ties, and  
ſpread directly and indirectly far and wide. Buſi-  
neſs to be ſolicited and cauſes depending, create a  
great intercourſe even where Private property is not  
divided into different countries, yet this diviſion  
will always ſubſiſt where different countries are ruled  
by the ſame government. Where a man has landed  
property both in the mother country and a pro-  
vince, he will almoſt always live in the mother  
country: this, though there were no trade, is  
ſingly a ſufficient gain. It is ſaid, that Ireland”  
pays near a million Sterling annually to its abſen-  
tees in England: The ballance of trade from Spain  
or even Portugal is ſcarcely equal to this.  
  
Let it not be ſaid we have no abſentees from  
North America, There are many to the writer&#x27;s”  
knowledge; and if there are at preſent but few of  
them that diſtinguiſh themſelves here by great ex-  
pence, it is owing to the mediocrity of fortune a-

the Mit- India iſlands, fo that there are as yet but  
few large eſtates. But if thoſe who have ſuch  
eſtates, Teſfide upon and take care of them them-  
ſelves, are they worſe ſubjects than they would be  
If they lived idly in England? Great merit is aſ-  
ſumed for the gentlemen of the Weſt- Indies“, on  
the ſcore of their reſiding and ſpending their mo-  
ney in England, I would not depreciate that me-  
rit; it is conſiderable, for they might, if they  
pleaſed ſpend their money in France: but the dif-  
ference between their ſpending it here and at home  
is not ſo great. Wat do they ſpend it in when  
they are here, but the produce and manufactures of  
this country; and would they not do the ſame if  
they were at home? Is it of any great impor-  
tance to the Eugliſb farmer, whether the Weſt-Tndia  
gentleman comes to London and eats his beef, pork,  
and tongues, freſh, or has them brought to him  
in the //e ft Indies fared ; whether he eats his Eu-  
gliþ cheeſe, and butter or drinks his Eng liſb ale at  
London or in Barbadoes? Is the clothier&#x27;s, or the  
mercer&#x27;s, or the cutler&#x27;s, or the toy- man&#x27;s profit  
Jess, for their goods being worn and conſumed by  
the fame” perſons reſiding on the other ſide of the  
ocean? Would not the profits of the merchant  
and mariner be rather greater, and ſome addition  
made to,,our navigation, ſhips and ſeamen ? If  
the North American gentleman ſtays in his own  
country, and lives there in that degree of luxury  
and expence-with regard to the uſt of Britiſh manu-  
  
  
his example (from the imitation of ſuperiors ſo na-  
tural to mankind) ſpread the uſe of thoſe manufac-  
tures among hundreds of families around him, and

occaſion a much greater gemand for Sins than  
  
it would do if he ſhould remove and live in Londons  
  
However this may be, if in our views of im-  
mediate advantage, it ſeems preferable that the  
gentlemen {of large fortunes in Vort6. America  
ſhould reſide much in England, tis what may ſurely  
be expected as faſt as ſuch fortunes are acquir  
there. Their having colleges of their own for  
the education of their youth,” will not prevent  
it: A little knowledge and learning acquired, in-  
ereaſes the appetite for more, and will make the  
converſation of the learned on this ſide the water  
more ſtrongly deſired. Ireland has its univerſity  
likewiſe; yet this does not prevent the immenſe  
pecuniary benefit we receive from that kingdom.  
And there will always be in the conveniencies of  
life, the politeneſs, the pleaſures, the magnificence  
of the reigning country, many other attractions he-  
ſides thoſe of learning, to draw men of ſubſtance  
there, where they can, apparently at leaſt,  
have the. beſt bargain of ine? for their  
money.  
  
Our trade to the % eft- India: ſands: is undoubt-  
edly a valuable one: but whatever is the amount  
of it, it has long been at a ſtand. Limited as our  
ſugar planters are by the ſcantineſs of territory, they  
cannot increaſe much beyond their preſent number;  
and this is an evil, as I ſhall ſhow hereafter, that  
will be little helped by our keeping Guadaloupe.  
The trade to our Northern Colonies, is not only  
greater, but yearly increaſing with the increaſe of  
  
People: and even in a greater proportion,” as the  
people increaſe i in wealth and the ability of ſpend-  
ing as well as in numbers. I have already ſaid,

+ enables, Hy the better to pay for finer goods  
1 that otherwiſe they could not indulge themſelves  
in: fo that the exports thither are not diminiſhed  
by ſuch manufacture but rather increaſed. The  
fingle article of manufacture in theſe colonies men-  
tioned by the remarker, is hats made in New Eng-  
land. It is true there have been ever ſince the  
firſt ſettlement of that country, a few hatters  
there, drawn thither probably at firſt by the  
facility of getting beaver, while the woods  
were but little clear&#x27;d, and there was plenty of  
thoſe animals. The caſe is greatly altered now.  
The beaver ſkins are not now to be had in  
  
  
at great prices. The trade is accordingly declin-  
ing there, ſo that, far from being able to make  
hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot  
  
  
that ſome thouſand dozens are ſent thither yearly  
from London, and fold there cheaper than the in-  
habitants can make them of equal gohdneſs. In  
fact, the colonies are fo little ſuited for eſtabliſhing  
  
of manufactures, that they are continually loſing  
  
  
working braſiers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well  
as hatters, who have happened to go over from

drop the working part of their buſineſs, and im-  
port their reſpective goods from England, whence

Thus much as to Na . of dur colo-  
ties becoming ſele to us. I ſhall next conſider  
the other ſuppoſition, that their growth may ren-  
der them dangerous. Of this I own; I have not  
  
  
already fourteen ſeparate governments on the ma-  
ritime coaſt of the continent, and if we extend our  
ſettlements ſhall probably have as many more be-  
hind them on the inland ſide. Thoſe we now have,  
  
  
Intereſts, and ſome of them different religious per-  
ſuaſions and different manners. Their jealouſy of  
each other is ſo great that however neceſſary an  
union of the colonies has long been, for their com-  
mon defence and ſecurity againſt their enemies, and  
how. ſenfible ſoever each colony has been of that  
  
  
ſuch an union among themſelves, nor even to a-  
gree in requeſting the mother country to eſtabliſh it  
for them. Nothing but the immediate command  
of the crown has been able to produee even the  
imperfect union but lately ſeen there, of the forces  
  
  
for their defence againſt the French and Indians,  
who were perpetually haraſſing their ſettlements,  
burning their villages, and murdering their ꝓeople;

to prevent it, that I will venture to ſay, an union  
amongſt them for ſuch a purpoſe is not merely im-

the whole is impoſſible, the: attempt of a part  
muſt be madneſs: as thoſe colonies that did not  
join the rebellion, would join the mother country  
in ſuppreſſing it. VVVVVVVV  
When I ſay ſuch an union is impoſſible, I mean  
without the moſt grievous tyranny and oppreſſion.  
People who have property in a-country which they  
may loſe, and privileges which they may endan-  
ger; are generally. diſpos&#x27;d to be quiet; and even  
to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the  
government is mild and juſt, while important civil  
and religious rights are ſecure, ſuch ſubjects will  
be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not riſe,  
but when the winds blow. What ſuch an admini-  
ſtration as the Duke of Alva&#x27;s in the Netherlands,  
might produce, I know not; but this I think I  
have a right to deem impoſſible. And yet there  
were two very manifeſt differences between that  
caſe, and ours, and both are in our favour. The  
firſt, that Spain had already united the ſeventeen  
provinces under one viſible government, tho the  
ſtates continued independent: The ſecond, that the  
inhabitants of thoſe provinces were of a nation, not  
only different from, but utterly unlike the Spa-  
mards. Had the Netherlands been peopled from  
Spain, the worſt of oppreſſion had probably not  
provoked them to wiſh a ſeparation of govern-  
ment. It might and probably would have ruined  
the country, but would never have produced an  
independent ſovereignty. In fact, neither the very  
worſt of governments, the worſt of politicks in  
the laſt century, nor the total abolition of their re-  
maining liberty, in the provinces of Spain itſelf, in  
the preſent, have produced any independency that  
could be ſupported. The ſame may be obſerved  
Of France. And let it not be ſaid that the neigh-  
bourhood of theſe to the ſeat of government has  
1 3 [© © prevented:  
  
L 43  
prevented a ann &quot;While our ſtrength at  
ſea continues, the banks of the Ohio (in point 14  
eaſy and expeditious conveyance of troops) are  
  
. nearer to London, than the remote parts of France  
  
and Spain to their reſpective capitals; and much  
nearer than Connaught and Ulſter were in the days  
of Queen Elizabeth. No body foretels the diſſo-  
lution of the Ryſian monarchy from its extent, yet  
I will venture to ſay, the eaſtern parts of it are al-  
ready much more inacceſſiable from Peterſburgh,  
than the country on the Mi. pi is from London;  
I mean more men, in leſs time, might be con-  
veyed the latter than the former diſtance. The  
rivers Oby, Feneſea and Lena, do not facilitate the  
communication half ſo well by their courſe, nor are  
they half ſo practicable as the American rivers. To  
this I ſhall only add the obſervation of Macbiavel,  
in his Prince, that a government ſeldom long pre-  
ſerves its dominion over thoſe who are foreigners  
to it; who on the other hand fall with great eaſe,  
  
and continue inſeparably annex d to the govern-  
ment of their own nation, which he proves by the  
fate of the Engliſh conqueſts in France.  
  
Yet with all theſe diſadvantages, ſo difficult is  
it to overturn an eſtabliſhed government, that it  
was not without the aſſiſtance of France and Eng-  
land, that the United Provinces ſupported them-  
ſelves : which teaches us, that if the viſionary dan-  
ger of independence in our colonies is to be feared,  
nothing is more likely to render it ſubſtantial than  
the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the  
ſovereign government, capable of giving either  
aid or an aſylum, as the event ſhall require. Let  
againſt even theſe diſadvantages, did Spain pre-  
ſerve almoſt ten provinces, merely through their  
want of union, which indeed could never have k  
taken Place among the others, but for cauſes, ſorne |

The Romans well underſtood” that bbs which  
teaches the ſecurity ariſing to the chief government  
from ſeparate ſtates among the governed, when they  
reſtored the liberties of the ſtates of Greece,. (op-  
preſſed but united under Macedon) by an edict that  
every ſtate ſhould live under its own laws.“ They  
did not even name a governor. Independence of  
each other, and ſeparate intereſts, tho&#x27; among a  
people united by common manners, language, and  
I may fay religion, inferior neither in wiſdom,  
bravery, nor their love of liberty to the Romans  
themſelves, was all the ſecurity the ſovercigns with-  
ed for their ſovereignty. It is true, they did not  
call themſelves ſovereigns; they ſet no value on the  
title; they were contented with poſſeſſing the  
ching; and poſſeſs it they did, even without a ſtand-  
ing army. What can be a ſtronger proof of the  
ſecurity of their poſſeſſion ? And yet by a policy fi-  
milar to this throughout, was the Roman world ſub-  
dued and held : a world compos&#x27;d of above an

+ When the Romans Jad ſubdu&#x27;d Macedon and Ilhyricum,  
| they were both form&#x27;d into republicks by a decree of the ſe.  
nate, and Macedon was thought ſafe from the danger of a re-

Romans, as we learn from the tetrarchs in ſcripture. Omninm

ter would, if he could, hide from himſelf as well as  
from the public, the horror ariſing from ſuch a

the moſt likely means of driving them into. the.  
arms of the French, who can invite them by an  
offer of that ſecurity their own government chu-

how little many good-natured perſons are affected by.

The murder of huſbands, of wives, of brothers,

been for ſome time enjoyed, affects deeply the re-  
ſpective ſurviving relations: but grief for the death  
of a child juſt born is ſhort and eaſily ſupported. |  
The method I mean is that which was dictated by  
the Egyptian policy, when the © infinite increaſe”  
  
of the children of Iſrael was apprehended as dan-  
gerous to the ſtate.* Let an act of parliament,  
then be made, enjoining the colony midwives to

But all this debate about the propriety or im»  
propriety. of keeping or reſtoring; Canada, is poſſi-  
bly too early. We have taken the capital indeed,  
but the country is yet far from being in our poſ-  
ſeflion ; and perhaps never will be : for if our  
M-3----rs are perſuaded by ſuch counſellors as  
the remarker, that the French there are not the  
worſt of neighbours,” and that if we had con-  
  
  
{tore it, as a check to the growth of our colonies, I  
am then. afraid we ſhall never take it. For there  
are many ways of avoiding the completion of the  
conqueſt, that will be leſs — and leſs o-  
dious than the giving it up. 1  
The objection I have often heard, that 7 we e had  
Canada, we could not people it without draining,  
Britain of its inhabitants, is founded: on Ignorance  
of the nature of population in new countries.  
When we firſt began to colonize in America, it was  
neceſſary to ſend people, and to ſend ſeed- corn; but  
it is not now neceſſary that we ſhould furniſh, Kor. a  
new colony, either one or the other. The annual! in-  
crement alone of our preſent colonies, without di-  
miniſhing their numbers, or requiring a man from  
  
  
double the number of Engliſb that it now has of  
French inhabitants.“ Thoſe who are proteſtants  
among the French, will probably chuſe to remain  
under the Engliſo government; many will chuſe to  
remove, if they can be allowed to ſell their lands,  
  
  
bra ſettled  
  
In fact, there has not gone from Britain to our colonies  
theſe 20 years paſt, to ſettle there, ſo many as 10 families a  
year; the new ſettlers are either the offspring of the old, or  
emi migrants from Germany or the north of J reland.

from the crouds of Engliſb ſettling round and  
among them, be blended and incorporated with  
dur people both in language and mannerꝛs.  
In Guadaloupe the caſe is ſomewhat different; and  
  
though I am far from thinking * we have ſugar-  
land enough +, I cannot think Guadaloupe is ſo de-  
firable an increaſe of it, as other objects the enemy  
would probably be infinitely more ready to part  
with. A country fully inhabited by any nation is  
no proper poſſeſſion for another of different lan-  
guage, manners and religion. It is hardly ever  
tenable at leſs expence than it is worth,---But the  
. Me of Cayenne, and its appendix Equino#ial-France,  
would indeed be an acquiſition every way ſuitable  
  
  
that migrate from Barbadoes, the Leeward lands,  
or Jamaica. It would certainly recal into an Engliſh  
government (in which there would be room for  
millions) all who have before ſettled or purchaſed in  
Martineco, Guadaloupe, Santa-Cruz or St. John&#x27;s;  
except ſuch as know not the value of an Engliſb  
government, and fuch I am ſure are not worth  
Og pert re pare ons rot eng  
But ſhould we keep Guadaloupe, we are told it  
would enable us to export C. 300,000 in ſugars.

it here, to whoſe profit is this to redound ?.to

carriage impractiable, ſo that no profitable uſe can be made  
of it unleſs the price of ſugars ſhould fo greatly increaſe as to

be a doubtful point and well worth confidera-  
tion, whether our obtaining poſſeſſion of all the Ca-  
ribbees, would be more than a temporary benefit, as  
it would neceſſarily ſoon fill the French part of Hri/-  
paniola with French inhabitants, and thereby ren-  
der it five times more valuable in time of peace,  
and little leſs than impregnable in time of war;  
and would probably end in a few years in the uniting  
the whole of that great and fertile iſland under a  
French government. It is agreed on all hands, that  
our conqueſt of St. Chriſtopher&#x27;s, and driving the  
French from thence, firſt furniſh&#x27;d Hiſpaniola with  
Tkilful and ſubſtantial planters, and was conſequently  
the firſt occaſion of its preſent opulence. On the  
other hand, I will hazard an opinion, that valuable  
as the French poſſeſſions in the Weſt Indies are, and  
undeniable the advantages they derive from them,  
there is ſomewhat to be weighed in the oppoſite  
ſcale. Fhey cannot at preſent make war with  
England, without expoſing thoſe advantages while  
divided among the numerous iſlands they now  
have, much more than they would, were they poſ-

I have before ſaid I do not deny the utility of  
the conqueſt, or even of our future poſſeſſion of  
Guadaloupe, if not bought tõ dear. The trade of  
the Veſt Indies is one of our moſt valuable trades.

to Her COL ONTIES.  
  
Have peruſed with no ſmall pleaſure the Letter  
1 addreſſed to Two Great Men, and the Remarks  
on that letter. It is not merely from the beauty,  
the force and perſpicuity of expreſſion, or the  
general elegance of manner conſpicuous in both  
pamphlets, that my pleafure chiefly ariſes ; it is ra-  
ther from this, that I have lived to ſee ſubjects of  
the greateſt importance to this nation publickly  
diſcuſſed without party views, or party heat, with  
decency and politeneſs, and with no other warmth  
than what a zeal for the honour and happineſs of  
our king and country may inſpire z------ and this by  
writers whoſe underſtanding (however they may  
differ from each other) appears not unequal to their  
candour and the uprightneſs of their intention.  
  
But, as great abilities have not always the beſt  
information, there are, I apprehend, in the Remarks  
ſome opinions not well founded, and ſome miſ-  
takes of ſo important a nature, as to render a few  
obſervations on them neceſſary for the better in-  
formation of the public.  
  
The author of the Letter, who muſt be every way  
beſt able to ſupport his own ſentiments, will, I  
hope, excuſe me, if I ſeem officiouſly to interfere  
when he conſiders, that the ſpirit of patriotiſm, oe  
  
Ps Other  
  
1  
  
other qualities good and bad, is catching; and  
that his long ſilence ſince the Remarks appeared  
has made us deſpair of ſeeing the ſubject farther  
diſcuſſed by his maſterly hand. The ingenious and  
candid remarker, too, who muſt have been miſled  
himſelf before he employed his ſkill and addreſs to  
miſlead others, will certainly, ſince he declares he  
aims at no ſeduttion,* be diſpoſed to excuſe even  
the weakeſt effort to prevent it.  
  
And ſurely if the general opinions that poſſeſs the  
minds of the people may poſſibly be of conſequence  
in publick affairs, it muſt be fit to ſet thoſe opinions  
right.It there is danger,as the remarker ſuppoſes, that  
extravagant expectations” may embarraſs a vir-  
tuous and able miniſtry,” and“ render the nego-  
ciation for peace a work of infinite difficulty ; ? +  
there is no leſs danger that expectations too low,  
thro&#x27; want of proper information, may have a con-  
trary effect, may make even a virtuous and able  
miniſtry leſs anxious, and leſs attentive to the ob-  
taining points, in which the honour and intereſt of  
the nation are eſſentially concerned ; and the peo-  
ple leſs hearty in ſupporting ſuch a miniſtry and its  
meaſures,  
  
The people of this nation are indeed reſpectable,  
not for their numbers only, but for their under-  
ſtanding and their publick ſpirit : they maniteſt  
the firſt, by their univerſal approbation of the late  
prudent and vigorous meaſures, and the confidence  
they ſo juſtly repoſe in a wiſe and good prince,  
and an honeſt and able adminiſtration ; the latter  
they have demonſtrated by the immenſe ſupplies  
granted in parliament unanimouſly, and paid  
through the whole kingdom with chearfulneſs.  
And ſince to this ſpirit and theſe ſupplies our  
L victories and ſucceſſes” Þ have in great .

been owing, is it quite right, is it generous to ſay,  
with the remarker, that the people had no ſhare  
in acquiring them?“ The mere mob he cannot  
mean, even where he ſpeaks of the madneſs of the  
people; for the madneſs of the mob muſt be too  
feeble and impotent, arm&#x27;d as the government of  
this country at preſent is, to “ over-rule,” “ even in  
the ſlighteſt inſtances, the“ virtue and moderation”  
of a firm and ſteady miniſtry.  
  
While the war continues, its final event is quite  
uncertain. The Victorious of this year may be the  
Vanquiſhed of the next. It may therefore be too  
early to ſay, what advantages we ought abſolutely  
to inſiſt on, and make the ne quibus non of a peace,  
If the neceſſity of our affairs ſhould oblige us to  
accept of terms leſs advantageous than our preſent  
ſucceſſes ſeem to promiſe us, an intelligent people,  
as ours is, muſt ſee that neceſſity, and will ac-  
quieſce. But as a peace, when it is made, may be  
made haſtily ; and as the unhappy continuance of  
the war affords us time to conſider, among ſeveral  
advantages gain&#x27;d or to be gain&#x27;d, which of them  
may be moſt for our intereſt to retain, if ſome and  
not all may poſſibly be retained ; I do not blame  
the public diſquiſition of theſe points, as premature  
or uſeleſs. Light often ariſes from a colliſion of  
opinions, as fire from flint and ſteel ; and if we  
can obtain the benefit of the light, without danger  
from the heat ſometimes produc&#x27;d by controverſy,  
why ſhould we diſcourage it ?  
  
Suppoſing then, that heaven may ſtill continue  
to bleſs His Majeſty&#x27;s arms, and that the event of  
this juſt war may put it in our power to retain  
ſome of our conqueſts at the making of a peace;  
let us conſider whether we are to confine ourſelves  
to thoſe poſſeſſions only that were &amp; the o4jes for

which we began the war.““ This the remarker  
feems to think right, when the queſtion relates to  
* Canada, properly fo called, it having never been  
mentioned as one of thoſe objects in any of our  
&lt; memorials or declarations, or in any national or  
publick act whatſoever.” But the gentleman him-  
{elf will probably agree, that if the ceſſion of Ca-  
nada would be a real advantage to us, we may de-  
mand it under his ſecond head, as an ** zndemnifi-  
cation for the charges incurred” in recovering our  
uſt rights; otherwiſe according to his own prin-  
ciples the demand of Guadaloupe can have no foun-  
dation.  
  
That „“ our claims before the war were large  
«enough for poſſeſſion and for ſecurity too,” + tho?  
it feems a clear point with the ingenious remarker,  
18, I own, not ſo with me. I am rather of the con-  
trary opinion, and ſhall preſently give my rea-  
fons. But firſt let me obſerve, that we did not  
  
13ke thoſe claims becauſe they were large enough  
tor {ccurity, but becauſe we could rightfully claim  
no more. Advantages gained in the courſe of this  
war, may increaſe the extent of our rights. Our  
claims before the war contain&#x27;d ſome ſecurity ; but  
that is no reaſon why we ſhould neglect acquiring  
more when the demand of more is become rea-  
enable. It may be reaſonable in the caſe of A-  
erica to aſk for the ſecurity recommended by the  
author of the letter, || tho? it would be prepoſterous  
to do it in many other caſes : his propos&#x27;d demand  
is founded on the little value of Canada to the  
French ; the. right we have to aſk, and the power  
dee may have to inſiſt on an indemnification for our  
expences; the difficulty the French Pee.

will be under of reſtraining their reſtleſs ſubjects in  
America from encroaching on our limits and di-  
ſturbing our trade ; and the difficulty on our parts  
of preventing encroachments that may poſſibly  
exiſt many years without coming to our know-  
ledge. But the remarker “ does not fee why the  
&amp; arguments employ*d concerning a ſecurity for a  
&amp; peaceable behaviour in Canada, would not be  
« equally cogent for calling for the ſame ſecurity  
“ in Europe. Ona little farther reflection, he  
muſt I think be ſenſible, that the circumſtances of  
the two caſes are widely different. Here we are  
ſeparated by the beſt and cleareſt of boundaries,  
the ocean, and we have people in or near every part  
of our territory. Any attempt to encroach upon  
us, by building a fort, even in the obſcureſt cor-  
ner of theſe iſlands, muſt therefore be known and  
prevented immediately. The aggreſſors alſo muſt  
be known, and the nation they belong to would be  
accountable for their aggreſſion. In America it is  
  
  
at all peopled, conceals with cafe the march ot  
troops and workmen. Important paſſes may be  
ſeized within our limits and forts built in a month,  
at a ſmall expence, that may coſt us an age and a  
million to remove. Dear experience has taught us  
this. But what is ſtill worſe, the wide extended  
foreſts between our ſettlements and theirs, are in-  
  
  
in war and take pride in murder, ſubjects properly  
neither of the French nor Engliſh, but ſtrongly  
attach&#x27;d to the former by the art and indefatigable

between the two crowns, to the certain diminution  
of our people and the contraction of our ſettle-  
ments.“ And tho” it is known they are ſupply&#x27;d  
by the French and carry their priſoners to them,  
we can by complaining obtain no redreſs, as the  
governors of Canada have a ready excuſe, that the  
Indians are an independent people, over whom they  
have no power, and for whoſe actions they are  
  
| there-  
  
A very intelligent writer of that country, Dr. Clark, in his  
Ob/ervations on the late and preſent conduct of the French, &amp;C.  
printed at Boſton 1755, ſays,  
  
* The Indians in the French intereſt are, upon all proper o  
  
portunities, inſtigated by their prieſts, who have generally the  
chief management of their publick councils, to acts of ho-  
ſtility againſt the Exgliſb, even in time of profound peace be-  
tween the two crowns. Of this there are many undeniable  
inſtances. The war between the Indians and the colonies of  
the Maſachuſets-Bay and New-Hampſhire, in 1723, by which  
© thoſe colonies ſuffered ſo much damage, was begun by the  
© inſtigation of the French; their ſupplies were from them, and  
© there are now original letters of ſeveral Jeſuits to be pro-  
&lt; duced, whereby it evidently appears, that they were contin-  
* ually animating the Indians, when almoſt tired with the war,  
© to a farther proſecution of it. The French not only excited  
© the Indians, and ſupported them, but joined their own forces  
© with them in all the late hoſtilities that have been committed  
within His Majeſty&#x27;s province of Noewa-Scotia. And from an  
© intercepted letter this year from the Jeſuit at Penobſcot, and  
* from other information, it is certain that they have heen uſing  
© their utmoſt endeavours to excite the Indians to new acts of  
© hoſtility, againſt His Majeſty&#x27;s colony of the Maſachu/ets-  
Bay, and ſome have been committed. The French not only  
© excite the Indians to acts of hoſtility, but reward them for it,

therefore not accountable. Surely circumſtances  
ſo widely different may reaſonably authoriſe diffe-  
rent demands of ſecurity in America, from ſuch as  
are uſual or neceſſary in Europe.  
  
The remarker, however, thinks, that our real  
dependance for keeping France or any other na-  
tion true to her engagements, muſt not be in  
« demanding ſecurities which no nation whilſt inde-  
« pendent can give, but on our own ſtrength and our  
* own viligance.” * No nation that has carried  
on a war with diſadvantage, and is unable to con-  
tinue it, can be ſaid, under ſuch circumſtances, to  
be independent; and while either ſide thinks itſelf  
in a condition to demand an indemnification, there  
is no man in his ſenſes, but will, cæteris paribus,  
prefer an indemnification that is a cheaper and  
more effectual ſecurity than any other he can think  
of. Nations in this ſituation demand and cede  
countries by almoſt every treaty of peace that is  
made. The French part of the iſland of St. Cri-  
ſtopher&#x27;s was added to Great Britain in circumſtan-  
ces altogether ſimilar to thoſe in which a few  
months may probably place the country of Canada.  
Farther ſecurity has always been deemed a motive  
with a conqueror to be leſs moderate ; and even  
the vanquiſh&#x27;d inſiſt upon ſecurity as a reaſon for  
demanding what they acknowledge they could not  
otherwiſe properly aſk. The ſecurity of the frontier  
of France on the fide of the Netherlands, was always  
conſidered, in the negotiation that began at Getruy-  
  
For the ſame  
  
  
ways added ſomething to the power, either of  
France or the houſe of Bourbon. Even that of  
1733, Which ſhe commenced wich declarations of  
  
B her  
  
  
„  
her having no ambitious views, and which finiſhed  
by a treaty at which the miniſters of France re-  
peatedly declared that ſhe deſired nothing for  
herſelf, in effect gained for her Lorrain, an indem-  
nification ten times the value of all her North A.  
merican poſſeſſions.  
  
In ſhort, ſecurity and quiet of princes and ſtates  
have ever been deemed ſufficient reaſons, when  
ſupported by power, for diſpoſing of rights; and  
1 ſuch diſpoſition has never been looked on as  
1 want of moderation. It has always been the  
1 foundation of the moſt general treaties. The ſe-  
[ | curity of Germany was the argument for yielding  
|  
  
I conſiderable poſſeſſions there to the Srwedes : and  
5 the ſecurity of Europe divided the Spaniſb monar-  
118 chy, by the partition treaty, made between powers  
| who had no other right to diſpoſe of any part of it.  
There can be no ceſſion that is not ſuppoſed at  
leaſt, to increaſe the power of the party to whom  
it is made. It is enough that he has a right to  
aſk it, and that he does it not merely to ſerve the  
purpoſes of a dangerous ambition. Canada in the  
hands of Britain, will endanger the kingdom of  
France as little as any other ceſſion; and from its  
ſituation and circumſtances cannot be hurtful to any  
other ſtate, Rather, if peace be an advantage,  
this ceſſion may be ſuch to all Europe. The pre-  
ſent war teaches us, that diſputes ariſing in A-  
merica, may be an occaſion of embroiling na-  
tions who have no concerns there. If the French  
remain in Canada and Louiſiana, fix the bounda-  
ries as you will between us and them, we muſt  
border on each other for more than 1500 miles.  
The people that inhabit the frontiers, are generally  
the refuſe of both nations, often of the worſt morals  
and the leaſt diſcretion, remote from the eye, the  
  
prudence, and the reſtraint of government. Injuries

are therefore frequently, in ſome part or other of  
ſo long a frontier, committed on both ſides. Re-  
ſentment provoked, the colonies firſt engaged, and  
then the mother countries. And two great na-  
tions can ſcarce be at war in Europe, but ſome  
other prince or ſtate thinks it a convenient oppor-  
tunity, to revive ſome ancient claim, ſeize ſome  
advantage, obtain ſome territory, or enlarge ſome  
power at the expence of a neighbour. The flames  
of war once kindled, often fpread far and wide,  
and the miſchief is infinite. Happy it prov&#x27;d to  
both nations, that the Daſch were prevailed on  
finally to cede the New Netherlands (now the pro-  
vince of New York) to us at the peace of 1674  
a peace that has ever ſince continued between us,  
but muſt have been frequently diſturbed, if they  
had retained the poſſeſſion of that country, border-  
ing ſeveral hundred miles on our colonics of Pen-  
  
  
eaſtward. Nor is it to be wondered at that peo-  
ple of different language, religion, and manners,  
ſhould in thoſe remote parts engage in frequent  
quarrels, when we find, that even the people of our  
own colonies have frequently been ſo exaſperated  
againſt each other in their diſputes about boun-  
daries, as to proceed to open violence and blood-  
ſhed.  
  
But the remarker thinks we ſhall be ſufficiently  
ſecure in America, if we © raiſe Engliſh forts at  
* ſuch paſſes as may at once make us reſpectable to  
the French and to the Indian nations.“ * The  
ſecurity deſirable in America, may be conſidered  
as of three kinds; 1. A ſecurity of poſſeſſion, that  
the French ſhall not drive us out of the country.  
2. A ſecurity of our planters from the inroads of  
lavages, and the murders committed by them.

3. A ſecurity that the Britiſh nation ſhall not be  
  
oblig&#x27;d on every new war to repeat the immenſe  
  
expence occaſion&#x27;d by this, to defend its poſſeſſions  
  
in America. Forts in the moſt important paſſes,  
  
may, I acknowledge be of uſe to obtain the firſt  
kind of ſecurity : but as thoſe ſituations are far ad-  
  
vanc&#x27;d beyond the inhabitants, the expence of  
maintaining and ſupplying the garriſons, will be  
very great, even in time of full peace, and immenſe  
on every interruption of it; as it is eaſy for ſkulk-  
ing parties of the enemy in ſuch long roads thro? the  
woods, to intercept and cut off our convoys, un-  
leſs guarded continually by great bodies of men.  
The lecond kind of ſecurity, will not be obtain-  
ed by ſuch forts, unleſs they are connected by a  
wall like that of China, from one end of our ſettle-  
ments to the other. If the Indians when at war,  
march&#x27;d like the Europeans, with great armies,  
heavy cannon, baggage, and carriages, the paſſes  
thro&#x27; which alone ſuch armies could penetrate our  
country, or receive their ſupplies, being ſecur&#x27;d, all  
might be ſufficiently ſecure ; but the caſe is widely  
different. They go to war, as they call it, in  
{mall parties, from fifty men down to five. Their  
hunting life has made them acquainted with the  
whole country, and ſcarce any part of it is im-  
practicable to ſuch a party. They can travel thro&#x27;  
the woods even by night, and know how to con-  
ceal their tracks. They paſs eaſily between your  
forts undiſcover&#x27;d ; and privately approach the  
ſettlements of your frontier inhabitants. They  
need no convoys of proviſions to follow them; for  
whether they are ſhifting from place to place in  
the woods, or lying in wait for an-opportunity to  
ſtrike a blow, every thicket and every ſtream fur-  
niſhes fo ſmall a number with ſufficient ſubſiſtence,

Although the Indians live ſcattered, as a hunter&#x27;s life re-  
quires, they may be collected together from almoſt any diſ-  
tance, as they can find their ſubſiſtence from their gun in  
their travelling. But let the number of the Indians be what  
it will, they are not formidable merely on account of their  
numbers; there are many other circumſtances that give them  
a great advantage over the Fnglih, The Engli/h inhabitants,  
though numerous, are extended over a large tract of land,  
500 leagues in length on the ſea-ſhore; and altho&#x27; ſome of  
their trading towns are thick ſettled, their ſettlements in  
the country towns muſt be at a diſtance from each other: be-  
ſides, that in a new country, where lands are cheap, people  
are fond of acquiring large tracts to themſelves; and there-  
fore in the out ſettlements, they muſt be more remote : and  
as the people that move out are generally poor, they fit down,  
either where they can eaſte!t procure land, or ſooneſt raiſe a  
ſubſiſtence. Add to this, that the Exgliſb have fixed ſettled  
habitations, the eaſieſt and ſhorteſt paſſages to which the  
Indians, by conſtantly hunting in the woods, are perfectly  
well acquainted with; whereas the Eugliſb know little or  
nothing of the Indian country, nor of the paſſages thro* the  
woods that lead to it. The Indian way of making war is by  
ſudden attacks upon expoſed places; and as ſcon as they  
have done miſchief, they retire, and either go home by the  
ſame or ſome different rout, as they think ſafeſt; or go to  
ſome other place at a diſtance, to renew their ſtroke. If a ſut-  
ficient party ſhould happily be ready to purſue them, it 15 a  
great chance, whether in a country, conſiſting of woods and  
ſwamps, which the Engliſb are not acquainted with, the ene-  
my do not lie in ambuſh for them in ſome convenient place,  
and from thence deſtroy them. If this ſhould not be the caſe,  
but the Engliſb ſhould purſue them, as ſoon as they have  
gained the rivers, by means of their canoes, to the uſe of  
which they are brought up from their infancy, they pre

© It has been already remarked, that the tribes of the In-  
* dians living upon the lakes and rivers that run upon the back  
of the Engliſb ſettlements in North-America, are very numerous,  
and can furniſh a great number of fighting men, all per-  
fectly well acquainted with the uſe of arms as ſoon as capable  
* of carrying them, as they get the whole of their ſubſiſtence  
from hunting; and that this army, large as it may be, can be  
* maintained by the French without any expence. From their  
numbers, their ſituation, and the rivers that run into the  
Engliſb ſettlements, it is eaſy to conceive that they can at any  
time make an attack upon, and conſtantly annoy as many of  
the expoſed Engliſh ſettlements as they pleaſe, and thoſe at  
any diſtance from each other. The effects of ſuch incurſions  
have been too ſeverely felt by many of the Britiſb colonies,  
© Not to be very well known. The entire breaking up places  
that had been for a conſiderable time ſettled at a great ex-  
* pence, both of labour and money; burning the houſes, de-  
* ſtroying the ſtock, killing and making priſoners great num-  
© bers of the inhabitants, with all the cruel uſage they meet  
with in their captivity, is only a part of the ſcene. All other  
e Rene that are expoſed are kept in continual terror; the  
lands lie waſte and uncultivated from the danger that attends  
* thoſe that ſhall preſume to work upon them: beſides the  
immenſe charge the governments muſt be at in a very inef-  
fectual manner to defend their extended frontiers; and all

here: ſuch forts I think cannot prevent this. Dur-  
ing a peace, it is not to be doubted the French,  
who are adroit at fortifying, will likewiſe erect  
forts in the moſt advantageous places of the coun-  
try we leave them, which will make it more diffi-  
cult than ever to be reduc&#x27;d in caſe of another war.  
We know by the experience of this war, how  
extremely difficult it is to march an army thro? the  
American woods, with its neceſſary . cannon and  
ſtores, ſufficient to reduce a very ſlight fort. The  
accounts at the treaſury will tell you what amazing  
ſums we have neceſſarily ſpent in the expeditions  
againſt two very trifling forts, Duqueſne and Crown  
Point. While the French retain their influence  
over the Jadians, they can eaſily keep our long  
extended frontier in continual alarm, by a very  
few of thoſe people ; and with a ſmall number of  
regulars and militia, in ſuch a country, we find  
they can keep an army of ours in full employ for  
ſeveral years. We therefore ſhall not need to be  
told by our colonies, that if we leave Canada, how-  
ever circumſcrib&#x27;d, to the French, &lt;©* we have done  
&lt;* nothing ; wie ſhall ſoon be made ſenſible our-  
ſelves of this truth, and to our coſt.  
  
I would not be underſtood to deny that even if  
we {ubdue and retain Canada, ſome few forts may  
be of uſe to ſecure the goods of the traders, and  
protect the commerce, in caſe of any ſudden mil-  
underſtanding with any tribe of Indians: but theſe  
&#x27; forts will be beſt under the care of the colonies in-  
tereſted in the Indian trade, and garriſon&#x27;d by their  
Provincial forces, and at their own expence. Their  
own intereſt will then induce the American govern-

their importance; and ſee that the officers keep

I ſhould indeed think it leſs material whether  
Canada were ceded to us or not, if J had in view  
  
only the ſecurity of poſſeſſion in our colonies. I en-

acceſſion of the large territory claimed before the

ſeſſion of Canada, will tend to the increaſe of the

ſurpaſs the number that can ſubſiſt by the huſ-  
bandry of it. That this will be the caſe in America  
ſoon, if our people remain confined within the  
mountains, and almoſt as ſoon ſhould it be unſafe  
for them to live beyond, tho* the country be ceded  
to us, no man acquainted with political and com-  
mercial hiſtory can doubt. Manufactures are  
founded in poverty. It is the multitude of poor  
without land in a country, and who muſt work for  
others at low wages or ſtarve, that enables under-  
takers to carry on a manufacture, and afford it  
cheap enough to prevent the importation of the  
ſame kind from abroad, and to bear the expence  
of its own exportation. But no man who can  
have a piece of land of his own, ſufficient by his  
labour to ſubſiſt his family in plenty, is poor e-  
nough to be a manufacturer, and work for a ma-  
ſter. Hence while there is land enough in America  
for our people, there can never be manufactures to  
any amount or value. It is a ſtriking obſervation  
of a very able pen, that the natural livelihood of  
the thin inhabitants of a foreſt country, is hunting;  
that of a greater number, paſturage ; that of a  
middling population, agriculture ; and that of the  
greateſt, manufactures ; which laſt muſt ſubſiſt the  
bulk of the people in a full country, or they muſt  
be ſubſiſted by charity, or periſh. The extended  
population, therefore, that is -moſt advantageous  
to Great Britain, will be beſt effected, becauſe only  
effectually ſecur&#x27;d by our poſſeſſion of Canada. So  
far as the being of our preſent colonies in North  
America is concerned, I think indeed with the re-  
marker, that the French there are not an enemy  
« to be aprebended, * but the expreſſion is too  
vague to be applicable to the preſent, or indeed to

found means to murder thouſands of their people,

Our North American colonies are to be conſi-

it becomes not merely he cauſe” of the people im-

done nothing unleſs we © make conqueſts for

&amp; vain ambition,” &amp;c. It will not be a conqueſt  
  
It

It will be a conqueſt for the whole, and all our  
people will, in the increaſe of trade and the eaſe of  
taxes, find the advantage of it. Should we be  
obliged at any time to make a war for the protec-  
tion of our commerce, and to ſecure the exporta-  
tion of our manufactures, would it be fair to  
repreſent ſuch a war merely as blood and treaſure  
ſpent in the cauſe of the weavers of Yorkſhire,  
Norwich, or the Weſt, the cutlers of Sheffield, or  
the button- makers of Birmingham ? I hope it will  
appear before I end theſe ſheets, that if ever there  
was a national war, this is truly ſuch a one: a  
war in which the intereſt of the whole nation is di-  
rectly and fundamentally concerned.  
  
Thote who would be thought deeply ſkilled in  
human nature, affect to diſcover ſelr-intereſted  
views every where at the bottom of the taireſt, the  
molt generous conduct. Sutpicions and charges  
of this kind, meet with ready reception and belief  
in the minds even of the multitude ; and therefore  
leſs acuteneſs and addreſs&#x27;than the remarker is poſ-  
ſeſſed of, would be ſufficient to perſuade the na-  
tion generally, that all the zeal and ſpirit maniteſted  
and exerted by the colonies in this war, was only  
in © their own cauſe” to ““ make conqueſts for  
&lt;« themſelves,” to engage us to make more for  
them, to gratify their own *© vain ambition.” But  
ſhould they now humbly addreſs the mother country

for them;” allow that Engliſh forts raiſed in

e ſent limits, that in a few years the lands you are

&quot;Yr 1 You would have the French left in  
anada, to exerciſe your military virtue, and make  
  
ut you a warlike people, that you may have more

he faſted too, the ſweets of Two or THREE MILL 1ONS  
ir MWerling per annum ſpent among you by our fleets  
ne And forces, and you are unwilling to be without a

A reader of the remarks may be apt to ay x ; if  
this writer would have us reſtore Canada on prin-  
ciples of moderation, how can we conſiſtent with  
thoſe principles, retain Cuadaloupe, which he repre-  
ſents of ſo much greater value! I will endeavour  
to explain this, becauſe by doing it I ſhall have an  
opportunity of ſhowing the truth and good ſenſe  
of the anſwer to the intereſted application; J have  
juſt ſuppoſed. The author then is only apparently  
and not really inconſiſtent with himſelf. If we can  
obtain the credit of moderation by reſtoring Cana-  
da, it is well: but we ſhould, however, reſtore it  
at all events ; ; becauſe it would not only be of no

l agree with the gentleman, that with Canada in our  
poſſeſſion, our people in America will increaſe amaz-  
ingly. I know that their common rate of increaſe,  
where they are not moleſted by the enemy, is doubl-  
ing their numbers every twenty-five years by natural  
generation only, excluſive of the acceſſion of fo-  
reigners.* I think this increaſe continuing, would  
probably in a century more, make the number of  
* Britiſh ſubjects on that ſide the water more nume-  
rous than they now are on this; but I am far from  
entertaining, on that account, any fears of their be-  
coming either v/eleſs or dangerous to us; and I look  
on thoſe fears to be merely imaginary and without  
any probable foundation. The remarker is reſerv&#x27;d in  
giving his reaſons, as in his opinion this “ is not

The reaſon of this greater increaſe in America than in Eu-  
ng rope, is, that in old ſettled countries, all trades, farms, offices,  
ith and employments are full, and many people refrain marrying  
nd till they ſee an opening, in which they can ſettle themſelves,  
with a reaſonable proſpect of maintaining a family: but in 4-

not to mention Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield and Bir-  
mingham, and conſider what a difference there is in  
the numbers of people, buildings, rents, and the  
value of land and of the produce of land, even if  
he goes back no farther than is within man&#x27;s me-  
mory. Let him compare thoſe countries with o-  
thers on this ſame iſland, where manufactures have  
not yet extended themſelves, obſerve the preſent  
difference, and reflect how much greater our  
ſtrength may be, if numbers give ſtrength, when  
our manufacturers ſhall occupy every part of the  
iſland where they can poſſibly be ſubſiſted.  
  
But, ſay the objectors, © there is a certain diſtance  
from the ſea, in America, beyond which the ex-  
pence of carriage will put a ſtop to the ſale and  
conſumption of your manufactures ; and this, with  
the difficulty of making returns for them, will  
oblige the inhabitants to manufacture for them-  
ſelves; of courſe, if you ſuffer your people to ex-  
tend their ſettlements beyond that diſtance, your  
people become uſeleſs to you: and this diſtance  
is limited by ſome to 200 miles, by others to the  
Apalachian mountains. Not to inſiſt on a very  
plain truth, that no part of a dominion, from  
  
  
plies and aids both of men of money, tho? at too  
Prat a diſtance to be ſupply&#x27;d with manufactures  
rom ſome other part, is therefore to be deem&#x27;d  
uſeleſs to the whole; I ſhall endeavour to ſhow  
that theſe imaginary limits of utility, even in point  
of commerce, are much too narrow.  
  
  
tradeſmen and artificers of all kinds, and the  
vernments there, are not all of them always fa-

wpell-knovn fact, that — manufactures find their  
way even into the heart of Germany. Aſk the great  
e manufacturers and merchants of the Leeds, Sheffield,  
f Birmingham, Mancheſter and Norwich goods, and they  
  
- will tell you that ſome of them ſend their riders  
— frequently through France or Spain and Italy, up to  
e Vienna, and back through the middle and northern  
t parts of Germany, to ſhow ſamples of their wares  
r and collect orders, which they receive by almoſt  
n every mail, to a vaſt amount. Whatever charges  
e _ ariſe on the carriage of goods, are added to the  
  
value, and all paid by the conſumer. If theſe na-

d _ what ariſes from the cheapneſs and goodneſs of our  
h _ wares; whoſe trade, manufactures, or commercial

1- _ laws, as thoſe of our colonies certainly are in ſome  
degree: I ſay, if theſe nations purchaſe and con-  
ir ſume ſuch quantities of our goods, notwithſtand-  
ce ing the remoteneſs of their ſituation from the ſea ;  
1 ho much leſs likely is it that the ſettlers in Ame-

the intermix&#x27;d territories and claſhing intereſts of  
Princes. But when we conſider that the inland parts

the ſame time aſſiſt in conveying other commo-  
dities. That the commodities firſt mention&#x27;d,  
may eaſily by water or land carriage be brought to  
the ſea ports from interior America, will not ſeem  
incredible, when we reflect, that hemp formerly  
came from the Ukraine and moſt ſouthern parts of  
Ruſſia to Wologda, and down the Drina to Arch-  
  
angel, and thence by a perilous navigation round  
  
  
rope. It now comes from the ſame country up the  
Dnieper and down the Duna with much land car-  
riage. Great part of the Ryfſia iron, no high-  
priced commodity, is brought 3000 miles by land  
and water from the heart of Siberia. Furs, [the  
produce too of America] are brought to Amſterdaz::

another inſtance of extended inland commerce. It  
is found worth while to keep up a mercantile com-  
munication between Peking in China, and Peter/-  
burgh. And none of theſe inſtances of inland com-  
merce exceed thoſe of the courſes by which, at  
ſeveral periods, the whole trade of the Eaſt was  
carried on. Before the proſperity of the Mama-  
luke dominion in Egypt fixed the ſtaple for the  
riches of the Eaſt at Cairo and Alexandria, whi-  
ther they were brought from the Red Sea, great  
  
  
ly, and the Genoeſe and Venetians indirectly by way,

of Kaffa and Trebiſonde, difpers&#x27;d them thro? the  
Mediterranean and ſome other parts of Europe.  
Another part of thoſe goods was carried over-land  
from the Wolga to the rivers Duna and Neva; from  
both they were carried to the city of Miſbuy in the  
Baltick, fo eminent for its ſea-laws ; and from the  
city of Ladoga on the Neva, we are told they were  
even carried by the Dwina to Archangel, and from  
thence round the North Cape.  
  
If iron and hemp will bear the charge of carriage  
from this inland country, other metals will as well  
as iron; and certainly ſilk, ſince 3d. per Ib. is not  
above 1 per cent. on the value, and amounts to  
L. 28 per ton.  
  
If the growths of a country find their way out  
of it, the manufactures of the countries where the  
go, will infallibly find their way into it. They who  
underſtand the ceconomy and principles of manu-  
factures, know, that it is impoſſible to eſtabliſh  
them in places not populous ; and even in thoſe  
that are populous, hardly poſſible to eſtabliſh them  
to the prejudice of the places already in poſſeſ-  
ſion of them. Several attempts have been made in  
France and Spain, countenanced by the Government,  
to draw from us and eſtabliſh in thoſe countries, our  
hard-ware and woolen manufactures, but without  
ſucceſs. The reaſons are various. A manufacture  
is part of a great ſyſtem of commerce, which takes  
in conveniences of various kinds, methods of pro-  
viding materials of all forts, machinnes for expedit-  
ing and facilitating labour, all the channels of cor-  
reſpondence for vending the wares, the credit and  
confidence neceſſary to found and ſupport this  
correſpondence, the mutual aid of different arti-  
zans, and a thouſand other particulars, which time  
and long experience have gradually eſtabliſhed. A  
part of ſuch a ſyſtem cannot ſupport itſelf without  
the whole, and before the whole can be —  
  
the  
  
*  
*  
  
v7 LIKE,  
  
the partperiſhes. Manufactures where they are in  
perfection, are carried on by a multiplicity of hands,  
1 each of which is expert only in his own part, no  
one of them a maſter of the whole; and if by any  
means ſpirited away to a foreign country, he is loſt  
without his fellows. Then it is a matter of the ex-  
tremeſt difficulty to perſuade a complete ſet of  
workmen, {killed in all parts of a manufactory, to  
leave their country together and ſettle in a foreign  
land. Some of the idle and drunken may  
be enticed away, but theſe only diſappoint  
their employers, and ſerve to diſcourage the under-  
taking. If by royal munificence, and an expence  
that the profits of the trade alone would not bear,  
a complete ſet of good and ſkilful hands are col-  
lected and carried over, they find ſo much of the  
ſyſtem imperfect, ſo many things wanting to carry  
on the trade to advantage, ſo many difficulties to  
overcome, and the knot of hands ſo caſily broken,  
by death, diſſatisfaction and deſertion, that they and  
their employers are diſcouraged together, and the  
  
project vaniſhes into ſmoke. Hence it happens,  
that eſtabliſhed manufactures are hardly ever loſt,  
E but by foreign conqueſt, or by ſome eminent inte-  
. [rior fault in manners or government ; a bad police  
. Moppreſling and diſcouraging the workmen, or reli-

authentic accounts frequently required by the  
board of trade, and tranſmitted to that board by  
the reſpective governors; of which accounts I ſhall  
ſele&amp; one as a ſample, being that from the colony  
of Rhode-Ifland* ; a colony that of all the others  
receives the leaſt. addition from ſtrangers. For  
the increaſe of our trade to thoſe colonies, I refer  
to the accounts frequently laid before Parliament,  
by the officers of the cuſtoms, and to the cuſtom-  
houſe books : from which I have allo ſelected one  
account, that of the trade from Exgland (excluſive  
  
of Scotland) to Penſilvania +; a colony moſt re-

within account to be taken by officers under oath. By it there  
appears to be in this colony at this time 35,939 white perſons,  
and 4697 blacks, chiefly negroes.  
  
In the year 1730, by order of the then lords commiſſioners  
of trade and plantations, an account was taken of the number  
of people in this colony, and then there appeared to be 15, 302  
white perſons, &#x27;and 2633 blacks.  
  
Again in the year 1748, by like order, an account was taken  
of the nmber of people in this colony, by which it appears  
oy were at that time 29,755 white perſons, and 4373

man artizans, who are known to have tranſplanted  
themſelves into that country, though even theſe,  
in truth, when they come there, generally apply  
themſelves to agriculture as the ſureſt ſupport and  
moſt advantageous employment. By this account  
it appears, that the exports to that province have  
in 28 years, increaſed nearly in the proportion of  
17 to 1 ; whereas the people themſelves, who by  
other authentic accounts appear to double their  
numbers (the ſtrangers who ſettle there included)  
in about 16 years, cannot in the 28 years have in-  
creaſed in a greater proportion than as 4 to 1 :  
the additional demand then, and conſumption of  
goods from England, of 13 parts in 17 more than  
the additional number would require, muſt be  
owing to this, that the people having by their in-  
duſtry mended their circumſtances, are enabled to  
indulge themſelves in finer cloaths, better furni-  
ture, and a more general uſe of all our manufac-  
tures than heretofore. In fact, the occaſion for  
Engliſh goods in North America, and the inclination  
to have and uſe them, is, and mult be for ages to  
come, much greater than the ability of the people

of its-bulk or ſome other a? 7 &quot;0h cannot ſo.  
well be brought to them from Britain, it only  
enables. them the better to pay for finer goods  
that otherwiſe they could not indulge themſelves  
in: ſo that the exports thither are not diminiſhed  
by ſuch manufacture but rather increaſed. The  
fingle article of manufacture in theſe colonies men-  
tioned by the remarker, is hats made in New Eng-  
land. It is true there have been ever fince the  
firſt ſettlement of that country, a few hatters  
there, drawn thither probably at firſt by the  
facility of getting beaver, while the woods  
were but little clear&#x27;d, and there was plenty of  
thoſe animals. The caſe is greatly altered now.  
The beaver ſkins are not now to be had in  
New England, but from very remote places ana  
at great prices. The trade is accordingly declin-  
ing there, ſo that, far from being able to make  
hats in any quantity for exportation, they cannot  
ſupply their home demand; and it is well known  
that ſome thouſand dozens are ſent thither yearly  
from London, and ſold there cheaper than the in-  
habitants can make them of equal gohdneſs. In  
fact, the colonies are ſo little ſuited for eſtabliſhing  
of manufactures, that they are continually loſing  
the few. branches they accidentally gain. The  
working braſiers, cutlers, and pewterers, as well  
as hatters, who have happened to go over from  
time to time and ſettle in We colonies, gradually  
drop the working part of their buſineſs, and im-  
port their reſpective goods from England, whence  
they can have them cheaper and better than they  
can make them. They continue their ſhops in-  
deed, in the ſame way of dealing, but become ſel-  
ers of braſiery, cutlery, pewter, hats, Fc. brought  
  
from England, inftead of being makers of thoſe

Thus much as to the apprehenſion of our colo-  
ties becoming /eleſs to us. I ſhall next conſider  
the other ſuppoſition, that their growth may ren-  
der them dangerous. Of this I own, I have not  
the leaſt conception, when I conſider that we have  
already fourteen ſeparate governments on the ma-  
ritime coaſt of the continent, and if we extend our  
ſettlements ſhall probably have as many more be-  
hind them on the inland ſide. Thoſe we now have,  
are not only under different governors, but havedif-  
ferent forms of government, different laws, different  
intereſts, and ſome of them different religious per-  
ſuaſions and different manners. Their jealouſy of  
each other is ſo great that however neceſſary an  
union of the colonies has long been, for their com-  
mon defence and ſecurity againſt their enemies, and  
how ſenſible ſoever each colony has been of that  
neceſſity, yet they have never been able to effect  
ſuch an union among themſelves, nor even to a-  
gree in requeſting the mother country to eſtabliſh it  
tor them. Nothing but the immediate command  
of the crown has been able to produce even the  
imperfect union but lately ſeen there, of the forces  
of ſome colonies. If they could not agree to unite  
for their defence againſt the French and Indians,  
who were perpetually haraſſing their ſettlements,  
burning their villages, and murdering their people;  
can it reaſonably be ſuppoſed there is any danger  
of their uniting againſt their own nation, which  
protects and encourages them, with which they  
have ſo many connections and ties of blood, in-  
tereſt and affection, and which &#x27;tis well known they  
all love much more than they love one another? In  
ſhort, there are ſo many cauſes that muſt operate  
to prevent-it, that T will venture to ſay, an union  
amongſt them for ſuch a purpoſe is not merely im-  
probable, it is impoſſible; and if the union 0  
F C  
  
42  
the whole is impoſſible, the attempt of a part  
muſt be madneſs: as thoſe colonies that did not  
join the rebellion, would join the mother country  
in ſuppreſſing it.  
  
When I fay ſuch an union is impoſſible, I mean  
without the moſt grievous tyranny and oppreſſion.  
People who have property in a country which they  
may loſe, and privileges which they may endan-  
ger; are generally diſpos&#x27;d to be quiet; and even  
to bear much, rather than hazard all. While the  
government is mild and juſt, while important civil  
and religious rights are ſecure, ſuch ſubjects will  
be dutiful and obedient. The waves do not riſe,  
but when the winds blow. What ſuch an admini-  
ſtration as the Duke of Alva&#x27;s in the Netherlands,  
might produce, 1 know not; but this I think 1  
have a right to deem impoſſible. And yet there  
were two very manifeſt differences between that  
caſe, and ours, and both are in our favour. The  
firſt, that Spain had already united the ſeventeen  
provinces under one viſible government, tho* the  
ſtates continued independent: The ſecond, that the  
inhabitants of thoſe provinces were of a nation, not  
only different from, but utterly unlike the Spa-  
niards. Had the Netherlands been peopled from  
Spain, the worſt of oppreſſion had probably not  
provoked them to wiſh a ſeparation of govern-  
ment. It might and probably would have ruined  
the country, but would never have produced an  
independent ſovereignty. In fact, neither the very  
  
. N 8 gh  
  
  
the laſt century, nor the total abolition of their re-  
  
  
  
of France. And let it not be ſaid that the neigh-

prevented a ſeparation. While our ſtrength at  
ſea continues, the banks of the Ohio (in point of  
eaſy and expeditious conveyance of troops) are  
nearer to London, than the remote parts of France  
and Spain to their reſpective (capitals ; and much  
nearer than Connaught and Ulſier were in the days  
of Queen Elizabeth. No body foretels the diſſo-  
lution of the Ruſſian monarchy from its extent, yet  
I will venture to ſay, the eaſtern parts of it are al-  
ready much more inacceſſiable from Peterſburgh,  
than the country on the Miſiſipi is from London;  
I mean more men, in leſs time, might be con-  
veyed the latter than the former diſtance. The  
rivers Oby, Feneſea and Lena, do not facilitate the  
communication half ſo well by their courſe, nor are  
they half ſo practicable as the American rivers. To  
this I ſhall only add the obſervation of Machiavel,  
in his Prince, that a government ſeldom long pre-  
ſerves its dominion over thoſe who are foreigners  
to it; who on the other hand fall with great eaſe,  
and continue inſeparably annex d to the govern-  
ment of their own nation, which he proves by the  
fate of the Engliſh conqueſts in France.  
  
Yet with all theſe diſadvantages, ſo difficult is  
it to overturn an eſtabliſhed government, that it  
was not without the aſſiſtance of France and Eng-  
land, that the United Provinces ſupported them-  
ſelves : which teaches us, that if the viſionary dan-  
ger of independence in our colonies is to be feared,  
nothing is more likely to render it ſubſtantial than  
the neighbourhood of foreigners at enmity with the  
ſovereign government, capable of giving either  
aid or an aſylum, as the event ſhall require. Yet  
againit even theſe diſadvantages, did Spain pre-  
ſerve almoſt ten provinces, merely through their  
want of union, which indeed could never have  
taken place among the others, but for cauſes, Kone

of which are in our caſe impoſſible, and others it is

The Romans well underſtood that policy which  
teaches the ſecurity ariſing to the chief government  
from ſeparate ſtates among the governed, when they  
reſtored the libertics of the ſtates of Greece, (op-  
preſſed but united under Maceden) by an edict that  
every ſtate ſhould live under its own laws.* They  
did not even name a governor. Independence of  
each other, and ſeparate intereſts, tho* among a  
people united by common manners, language, and  
I may fay religion, inferior neither in wiſdom,  
bravery, nor their love of liberty to the Romans  
themſelves, was all the fecurity the ſovereigns wiſh-  
ed for their ſovereignty. It is true, they did not  
call themſelves ſovereigns; they ſet no value on the  
title; they were contented with poſſeſſing the  
thing; and poſſeſs it they did, even without a ſtand-  
ing army. What can be a ſtronger proof of the  
ſecurity of their poſſeſſion? And yet by a policy ſi-  
milar to this throughout, was the Roman world ſub-  
dued and held : a world compos&#x27;d of above an  
hundred languages and ſets of manners different

But what is the prudent policy inculcated by  
the remarker, to obtain this end, ſecurity of domi-

the French and their Indians check the growth of our

maſſacring men, women and children. The wri-  
ter would, if he could, hide from himſelf as well as

the moſt likely means of driving them into the

offer of that ſecurity their own government chu-

how little many good-natured perſons are affected by

neceſſary to check the growth of our colonies, give  
me leave to propoſe a method Jefs cruel. It is a  
method of which we have an example in ſcripture.  
The murder of huſbands, of wives, of brothers,  
ſiſters and children, whoſe pleaſing ſociety has  
been for ſome time enjoyed, affects deeply the re-  
ſpective ſurviving relations: but grief for the death  
of a child juſt born is ſhort and eaſily ſupported.  
The method I mean is that which was dictated by  
the Egyptian policy, when the © infinite increaſe *”?  
of the children of Iſrael] was apprehended as dan-  
gerous to the ſtate.* Let an act of parliament,  
then be made, enjoining the colony midwives to  
{ſtifle in the birth every third or fourth child. By  
this means you may keep the colonies to their pre-  
ſent ſize. And if they were under the hard alternative

they would prefer the latter.  
  
But all this debate about the propriety or im-  
propriety of keeping or reſtoring Canada, is poſſi-  
bly too early. We have taken the capital indeed,  
but-the country is yet far from being in our poſ-  
ſeſſion; and perhaps never will be: for if our  
M-;----rs are perſuaded by ſuch counſellors as  
the remarker, that the French there are © not the  
worſt of neighbours,” and that if we had con-  
quered Canada, we ought for our own fakes to re-  
ſtore it, as a check to the growth of our colonies, I  
am then afraid we ſhall never take it. For there  
are many ways of avoiding the completion of the  
conqueſt, that will be leſs exceptionable and leſs o-  
  
dious than the giving it up.  
The objection I have often heard, that if we had  
Canada, we could not people it without draining  
Britain of its inhabitants, is founded on ignorance  
of the nature of -population in new countries.  
When we firſt began to colonize in America, it was  
| neceſſary to ſend people, and to ſend ſeed-corn ; but  
it is not now neceſſary that we ſhould furniſh, for a  
new colony, either one or the other. The annual in-  
I crement alone of our preſent colonies, without di-  
I miniſhing their numbers, or requiring a man from  
4 hence, is ſufficient in ten years to fill Canada with  
double the number of Eng/i/þ that it now has of  
  
T French inhabitants.“ Thoſe who are proteſtants

In Guadaloupe the caſe is ſomewhat different; and  
though I am far from thinking “ we have ſugar-  
land enough +, I cannot think Guadaloupe is fo de-  
firable an increaſe of it, as other objects the enemy  
would probably be infinitely more ready to part  
with. A country fully inhabited by any nation is  
no proper poſſeſſion for another of different lan-  
guage, manners and religion. It is hardly ever  
tenable at leſs expence than it 1s worth,---But the  
iſle of Cayenne, and its appendix Equino#1al-France,  
would indeed be an acquiſition every way ſuitable  
to our ſituation and deſires. This would hold all  
that migrate from Barbadoes, the Leeward Iſlands,  
or Jamaica. It would certainly recal into an Engliſh  
government (in which there would be room for  
millions) all who have before ſettled or purchaſed in  
Martineco, Guadaloupe, Santa-Cruz or St. John&#x27;s;  
except ſuch as know not the value of an Engliſb  
government, and ſuch I am ſure are not worth  
recalling.  
  
But ſhould we keep Guadaloupe, we are told it  
would enable us to export . 300,000 in ſugars.  
Admit it to be true, though perhaps the amazing  
increaſe of Engliſh conſumption might ſtop moſt of  
it here, to whoſe profit is this to redound ? to

carriage impractiable, ſo that no profitable uſe can be made  
of it unleſs the price of ſugars ſhould fo greatly increaſe as to  
enable the planter to make very expenſive roads, by blowing

the profit of the French inhabitants of the iſland :  
except a ſmall part that ſhould fall to the ſhare of  
the Engliſh purchaſers, but whoſe whole purchaſe-  
money muſt firſt be added to the wealth and cir-  
culation of France.  
  
I grant, however, much of this /. 300,000  
would be expended in Britiſb manufactures. Per-  
  
| haps, too, a few of the land-owners of Guadaloupe  
might dwell and ſpend their fortunes in Britain,  
(though probably much fewer than of the inhabi-  
tants of North America). I admit the advantage ariſing  
to us from theſe circumſtances, (as far as they go) 1  
in the caſe of Guadaloupe, as well as in that of our  
other Jeſt India ſettlements. Yet even this con-  
ſumption is little better than that of an allied na-  
tion would be, who ſhould take our manufactures  
and ſupply us with ſugar, and put us to no ex-  
pence in defending the place of growth.  
  
But though our own colonies expend among, us  
almoſt the whole produce of our ſugar, * can we or 1  
ought we to promiſe ourſelves this will be the caſe 1  
  
of Guadaloupe. One 100,000 J. will ſupply them  
with Britiſb manufactures ; and ſuppoſing we can  
effectually prevent the introduction of thoſe of  
France, (which is morally impoſlible in a countr  
uſed to them) the other 200,000 will ſtill be ſpent  
in France, in the education of their children and  
ſupport of themſelves; or elſe be laid up there,  
where they will always think their home to be.  
  
Beſides this conſumption of Briti/h manufac-  
tures, much is ſaid of the benefit we ſhall have  
from the ſituation of Guadaloupe, and we are told  
of a trade to the Caraccas and Spaniſh Main. In  
what reſpect Guadaloupe is better ſituated for this  
trade than Jamaica, or even any of our. other  
iſlands, I am at a loſs to gueſs, I believe it to be  
  
* Remarks, p. 47.  
  
O ;  
not ſo well ſituated for R of the windward coaft;  
as Tobago and St. Lucia, which in this as well as  
other reſpects, would be more valuable poſſeſſions,  
and which, I doubt not, the peace will ſecure to us.  
Nor is it nearly ſo well ſituated for that of the reſt of  
the Spaniſh Main as Jamaica. As to the greater  
ſafety of our trade by the poſſeſſion of Guadaloupe,  
experience has convinced us that in reducing a  
ſingle iſland, or even more, we ſtop the privateer-  
ing buſineſs but little. Privateers till ſubſiſt in  
equal if not greater numbers, and carry the veſſels  
into Martinico which before it was more conveni-  
ent to carry into Guadaloupe. Had we all the Ca-  
ribbees, it is true, they would in thoſe parts be  
without ſhelter. Yet upon the whole I ſuppoſe it to  
be a doubtful point and well worth conſidera-  
tion, whether our obtaining poſſeſſion of all the Ca-  
7ibbees, would be more than a temporary benefit, as  
it would neceſſarily ſoon fill the French part of Hi/-  
paniola with French inhabitants, and thereby ren-  
der it five times more valuable in time of peace,  
and little leſs than impregnable in time of war;  
and would probably end in a few years in the uniting  
the whole of that great and fertile iſland under a  
French government. It is agreed on all hands, that  
our conqueſt of St. Chriſtopher&#x27;s, and driving the  
French from thence, firſt furniſh&#x27;d Hiſpaniola with  
ſkilful and ſubſtantial planters, and was conſequently  
the firſt occaſion of its preſent opulence. On the  
other hand, I will hazard an opinion, that valuable  
as the French poſſeſſions in the Weſt Indies are, and  
undeniable the advantages they derive from them,  
there is ſomewhat to be weighed in the oppoſite  
ſcale. Fhey cannot at preſent make war with  
England, without expoſing thoſe advantages while  
divided among the numerous iſlands they now  
  
have, much more than they would, were they poſ-  
ſeſſed  
  
L 51 J  
ſeſſed of St. Domingo only; their own ſhare of which  
would, if well cultivated, grow more ſugar, than  
is now grown in all their Veſt India iſlands.  
  
I have before ſaid I do not deny the utility of  
the conqueſt, or even of our future poſſeſſion of  
Guadaloupe, if not bought t6 dear. The trade of  
the Weſt Indies is one of our moſt valuable trades,  
Our poſſeſſions there deſerve our greateſt care and  
attention. So do thoſe of North America. I ſhall  
not enter into the invidious taſk of comparing their  
due eſtimation. It would be a very long and a  
very diſagreeable one, to run thro&#x27; every thing  
material on this head. It is enough to our preſent  
point, if I have ſhown, that the value of North  
America is capable of an immenſe increaſe, by an  
acquiſition and meaſures, that muſt neceſſarily  
have an effect the direct contrary of what we have  
been induſtriouſly taught to fear; and that Cuada-  
loupe is, in point of advantage, but a very ſmall ad-  
dition to our Weſt India poſſeſſions, rendered many  
ways leſs valuable to us than it is to the French, who  
will probably ſet more value upon it than upon a  
country that is much more valuable to us than to  
them.  
  
There is a great deal more to be ſaid on all the  
parts of theſe ſubjects; but as it would carry me  
into a detail that I fear would tire the patience of  
my readers, and which I am not without appre-  
henſions I have done already, I ſhall reſerve what  
remains till I dare venture again on the indulgence  
of the publick. ;

would be a real advantage to us, ye  
may demand it, under the Remarkér;  
hand, as.an indemnification for the  
charges incurred in recovering our jul  
rights; otherwife, according to his  
own principles, the demand of Guada-  
loupe can have no foundation.

claims becaufe.they were large enough  
for fecurity,: but. becaufe we cottld  
rightfully claim no more. Advanta-  
ges gained in the courfe of this war,  
may increafe the extent of our rights,  
The demand of Canada is founded  
on the little value of it to the French ;  
the right we have to afk, and the power  
  
we may have to infift on an imdemni-  
  
fication for our expences ; the difficul-  
ty the French themfelves will be under  
of reftraining their reftlefs fubjects in  
America .from ehcroaching on our Ji-  
mits, and difturbing our trade; and  
the difficulty on our parts of prevent-.  
ing encroachmeuts that may poflibly  
exift many years, without coming to  
our knowledge.  
  
_ Remarks. 1 do not fee why the ar-  
guments employed concerning a fecu-  
rity for a peaceable behaviour in Ca-  
nada, would not be equally cogent for  
  
calling for the fame fecurity in Eu \
  
rope. . . |  
  
_Anfwer. The circumftances of the  
two cafes ate widely different. Here  
any attempt to encroach upon us, by  
building a fort, even in the obfcurelt  
corner of thefe iflands, muft be knowe  
and prevented immediately. The ag-  
grellors alfo muft be known. In A-  
merica it is quite otherwife. A valt  
wildernefs, thinly, or farce at all peo-  
pled, conceals the march of the troops  
and workmen. Dear experience has  
taught us this. But what is {till worle,  
the wide extended forelts between our  
fettlements and theirs, are inhabited  
by barbarous tribes of favages, [trong

and indefatigable indultry of prielts,

family alliances. Thefe are eafily, and  
have been continually inftigated to  
maflacre our planters, even in times of  
full peace between the two crowns.  
And tho’ they are fupplied by the  
French, and carry their prifaners to  
them, we cau by complaining obtain no  
redrefs, as the governors of Canada  
have a ready excufe, that the Indians  
srean independent people, over whom  
they have no power.  
  
Remarks. We fhall be fufficiently  
fecure in America, if we raife Englifh  
forts at fuch pafles at may at once  
make us refpectable to the French and  
to the Indian nations,  
  
Anfwer. The fecurity defirable in  
America may be confidered as of three  
kinds; 1. A fecurity of poffeffion, that  
the French fhall not drive us out of  
the country. 2. A fecurity of our  
planters from the inroads of favages,  
and the murders committed by them.  
3. A fecurity that the Britifh nation  
fhall not be obliged on every new war  
to répeat the immenfe expence occafi-  
oned by this, to defend its poffeffions  
in America, Forts in the moft impor-  
tant pafies, may be of ofe to obtain  
the firft kind of fecurity : But as thofe  
fituations are far advanced beyond the  
inhabitants, the expence of maintain-  
ing and fupplying the garrifons will be  
very great even in time of full peace,  
and immenfe on every interruption of  
It; as it is eafy for fkulking parties of  
the enemy in fuch long roads through  
the woods to intercept and cut off our  
convoys, unlefs guarded continually  
by great bodies of men. The fecond  
kiad of fecurity, will not be-obtained  
by fuch forts, unlefs they were con-  
nected by a wall like that of China,  
  
from one end of our fettlements to  
  
the other, If the Indians» when et  
war, marched like the Europeans, with  
great armies, heavy cannon, baggage  
and carriages, the paffes through which  
slone fuch armies could penetrate our  
country or receive their fupplies, being  
fecured, all might be fufficiently fecure ;  
but the cafe is widely different, experi-  
ence has taught our planters that they  
  
Oe  
BOR eae  
  
any . é  
  
Lr 1760, 257  
  
cannot rely on forts as a f{ecurity a-  
gainft Indians, The Inhabitants of  
Hackney might as well rely upon the  
tower of London to fecure them againit  
highwaymen and houfebreakers. Asto  
the third kind of fecurity, that we thall  
not, in a few years, have all we have  
now done to do over again in Ameri-  
ca: During a peace, it is not to be  
doubted the French, who are adroit at  
fortifying, will likewife erect forts in  
the molt advantageous places of the  
country we leave them, which will  
make it more difficult than ever to be  
reduced in cafe of another war. Tlie  
accounts at the tresfury will tell you  
what amazing fums we have neceffarily  
fpent in the expeditions again{l two ve-  
ry trifling forts, Duquefne aud Crown-  
Point. Now all the kinds of fecurity  
we have mentioned: are obtained by  
fubduing and retaining Canada. Our  
prefent poffeflions in America, are ic-  
cured ; our planters will no longer be  
maflacred by the Indians who depend:  
ing abfolutely on us for what are now  
become the neceflaries of life to them,  
guns, powder, hatchets, knives, and  
cloathing ; and having no other Eu-  
ropeans near, that can either fupply  
them, or inftigate them againft us,  
there is no doubt of their being ai-  
ways difpofed, if we treat them with  
common juftice, to live in perpetual  
peace with us. And with r gard to  
France, fhe cannot, in cafe of another  
war, put us to the immenfe expence  
of defending that long extended fron-  
tier ; we fhall then, as it were, have  
our backs again{t a wall in Americs,  
_the fea-coaft will be eafily protected by  
our fuperior naval power. The torce  
now employed in that part of the  
world, may be {pared for any other  
fervice here or ellewhere ; fo that  
both the offenfive and  defenfive  
{treneth of the Britifh empire on the  
  
whole will be greatly increafed.  
Remarks. Our blood and treafure  
has been expended in the caufe of the  
colonies, and we are making conqnel!s  
forthem. The French in America ar

Anfwer, Itisa great miftake to i-  
  
magine that the American country in  
que(tion between Great-Britain and  
¥rance, is claimed as the property of  
any individuals or public body in A-  
merica, or that the poffeflion of it by  
Great-Britain, is likely, in any lucra-  
tive view, to redound at all to the ad-  
vantage of any perfon there. The bulk  
of the inhabitants of North-America  
are land-owners, whofe lands are in-  
ferior in value to thofe of Britain, only  
by the want of an equal number of  
people. It is true the acceflion of the  
large territory claimed before the war  
began, efpecially if that be fecured by  
the poffeflion of Canada, will tend to  
the increafe of the Britifh fubjects fa-  
{ter than if they had been confin’d  
within the mountains: yetthe increafe  
Within the mountains only would evi-  
dently make the corhparative popula-  
tion equal to that of Great-Britain  
much fooner, than it can be expected  
when our people are fpread over a  
country fix times as large. No con-  
fiderable advantage has refulted to the  
colonies by the conquelts of this war,  
or can refuli from confirming them by  
the peace, but what they mult enjoy in  
common with the reft of the Britith  
people ; with this evident drawback  
from their fore of thefe advantages,  
that they wil! neceffarily leflen, or at  
leait prevent the increafe of, the value  
of what mskes the principal part of  
their private property. A people  
{pread thro’ the whole tra&amp; of coun-

red by Canada in our hands, would  
probably by fome centuries find em-  
ployment in agriculture, and thereb

Anfwer. The very reafon the Re-  
marker afigns for their fo extending,  
and which is indeed the true one, their  
“being invited to it by the pleafant-  
nefs, fertility, and plenty of the coun-  
try,” may fatisfy us, that this exten-  
fion will continue to proceed as long as  
there remains any pleafant fertile coun-  
try within their reach. And if we e-  
ven fuppofe them confined by the wa-  
ters of the Miffifippi weltward, and by  
thofe of St Laurence and the Lakes  
to the northward, yet ftill we fhall  
leave them room enough to increafe  
even in the /parfe manner of feitling  
now practis’d there, till they amount  
to perhaps one hundred millions of  
foul. This muft take fome centuries  
to fulfil, and in the mean time, this  
nation mutt neceffarily fupply them with  
the manufactures they confume, becaufe  
the new fettlers will be employ’d in a-  
griculture, and the new fettlyments  
will fo continually draw off the fpare  
hands from the old, that our prefent  
colonies will not, during the period we  
have mentioned, find themfelves in a  
condition to manuf:cture even for their  
own inhabitants, to any confiderable  
degree, much iefs for thofe who are  
fettling behind them. Thus our trade  
mutt, till that country becomes as fully  
peopled as England, that is for centu-  
  
&quot; Fles to come, be continually increafing,  
  
and with it our naval power; becaufe  
the ocean is between us and them, and  
our fhips and feamen mutt increafe as  
  
that trade increales.  
bet fay the objectors, “ There isa  
  
certain diltance from the fea, in Ame-  
  
  
  
  
a 1760, 259  
  
rica, beyond which the expence of car-  
riage will put a ftop to the fale and  
confumption of your .manofa@ures ;  
and this, with the difliculty of making  
returns for them, will oblige the inha-  
bitants to manufacture for themfelves ;  
of courfe, if you fuffer your people to  
extend their fe:tlements beyond that  
diftance, your people become ulelefs to  
you ;” and this diftance is limited by  
fome to 200 miles, by others to the  
Apalachian mountains, . . I fhall en-  
deavour to fhow that thefe imaginary  
limits of utility, even in point of com-  
merce, are much too narrow.  
  
The inland parts of the continent of  
Europe are much farther from the fea  
than the limits of fettlement propoled  
America. Germany is full of tradef-  
men and artificers of all kinds; yet  
it is q well-known fad, that our ma-  
nufaGurers find their way even into  
the heart ofthat country. Ifthefe na-  
tions, over whom we have no govern-  
ment, over whofe confumption we can  
have no influence, but what arifes  
from the cheapnefs and goodnefs of our  
wares; whofe trade, manufadtures, or  
commercial connections, are not fubject  
to the controul of our laws, as thofe  
of our colonies certainly are in fome  
degree: I fay, if thefe nations pur-  
chafe and confume fuch quantities of  
our goods, notwithftanding the remore-  
nefs of their fituation from the fea ;  
how much Jefs likely is it that the fet-  
tlers in America, who mult for apes be  
employed in agriculture chiefly, fhould  
make cheaper for themfelves the goods  
our manufacturers at prefent fupply  
  
them with ; even if we fuppofe thecar-  
riage five, fix, or fevyen hundred miles  
from the fea, as dificult and expenfive  
as the like diltance into Germany  
whereas in the latter, the natural dj-  
ftances are frequently doubled by po-  
litical obftructions, I mean the inter-  
mixed territories and clafhing interefts  
of princes. But when we confider  
that the inland parts of America are

from Britain, it only enables them the  
better to pay for finer goods that other.  
wife they could not indulge themfelves  
in: So that the exports thither are  
not diminifhed by fuch manufacture,  
but rather increafed. The fimple ar-  
ticle of manufaéture in thefe colonies  
mentioned by the remarker, is hats  
made in New-England. It is true  
there have been ever fince the firft fet-  
tlement of that country, a few hatters  
there, drawa thither probably at firlt  
by the facility of getting beaver, while  
the woods were but little cleared, and  
there was plenty of thofe animals, The  
cafe is greatly altered now. The bea-  
ver fkins are not now to be had in  
New-England, but from very remote  
places and at great prices. The trade  
is accordingly declining there; fo that,  
far from being able to make hats in a-  
ny quantity for exportation, they can-  
not fupply their home demand. In  
fact, the colonies are fo little fuited for  
e(tablithing manufactures, that they are  
continually lofing the few branches  
they accidentally pain, The work-  
  
ing brafiers, cutlers, and pewterers, 35

become /el/ers of brafiery, cutlery, pew-

‘atead of being makers of thole  
yoods.  
Thus much as to the apprehenfion  
of our colonies becoming u/ele/s tous.  
 fhall next confider the other fuppofi-  
  
Htion, that their growth may render  
  
them dangerous. Of this I own, I  
have not the leaft conception, when I  
confider that we have already fourteen  
feparate governments On the maritime  
coalt of the continent, and if we ex-  
tend our fettlements, fhall probably  
have asmany more behind them on  
the inland fide. ‘Thofe we now have,  
are not dnly under different governors,  
but have different forms of govern-  
ment, different laws, different interelts,  
and fome of them different religious  
perfuafions, and different manners.  
Their jealoufy of each othet is fo  
graet, that however néceflary an union  
of the colonies has long been, for their  
common defence and fecurity againft  
their enemies, and how fenfible foever  
tach colony has been of that neceflity,  
yet they have never been able to effect  
fuch an union among themifelves, hor  
even to agrée in requefting the mothet  
country to eftablifh it for them. No-  
thing but the immediate command of  
the crown has been able to ptoduce e-  
ven the imperfe anion but lately feeri  
there, of the forces of fome colonies.  
The objection I have-often heard,  
that if we had Canada, we could not

now has of French inhabitants*. Thofe  
who are Proteftantsamong the French,  
will probably chufe to remain under  
the Englifh government; many will  
chufe to remove if they can be allow-  
ed to fell their lands, improvements;  
and effects: The refit in that thin-

fettling round and among them, be

mightier than we,” was doubtless extravagant. Had it been  
literally true, the subsequent oppression would not have been  
attempted, much less executed. But the whole course of  
action shows that the Egyptians regarded them as formidable  
in numbers and in power. The next verse expresses the  
apprehension that if they continued to increase, they would be  
able, by taking advantage of the next war, when the Egyptian  
army would be engaged with other enemies, to fight their own

These political relations are thoroughly treated in my  
“Through Goshen to Sinai.” It is only necessary to say  
in this connection that the Semitic inhabitants of the  
delta must have been kept in stern subjection by the  
father and grandfather of the Pharaoh of the exodus,  
Seti I. arid Rameses II.; for both of these kings lived in  
continual warfare with the peoples of Asia, and among their  
enemies, besides the great nation of the Kheta were large  
numbers of Semitic chieftains and princes. In view of  
these facts, the Bible statement, ‘‘ Lest it come to pass that  
when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves  
unto our enemies” (Exod. 1: 10), becomes full of signifi-

starve, that enable undertakers to carry on a manufacture,  
and afford it cheap enough to prevent the importation of the  
same kind from abroad, and to bear the expense of its own  
exportation.”” He contends that the North American col-

their defense against the French and Indians, who were per-  
petually harrassing their settlements, burning their villages,

there is any danger of their uniting against their own nation,

many connections and ties of blood, interest, and affection,  
and which, it is well known, they all love more than they love  
oneanother?”’ And yet Franklin was careful to leave an open  
door through which he could have escaped the charge of in-  
consistency if such charge had been preferred a dozen years  
later. ‘‘ When I say such a union is impossible, I mean with-  
out the most grievous tyranny and oppression.” ‘‘ The

hatters, who have happened to go over from time to time and settle  
in the colonies, gradually drop the working part of their business,  
and import their respective goods from England, whence they can  
have them cheaper and better than they can make them. They  
continue their shops, indeed, in the same way of dealing; but become  
sellers of braziery, cutlery, pewter, hats, etc., brought from England,

“raving ” to this effect. The argument is quite inconsist-  
ent with,what we have already learnt as to the decay of  
the fur trade in the English colonies. And the truer im-  
pression is certainly that which Franklin himself gives  
in his pamphlet of 1760, before cited, that the hat-making  
industry had been brought to an end not by the pressure  
of law, but by economic causes.  
  
It is true [Franklin then said] there have been, ever since the first  
settlement, a few hatters in New England, drawn thither probably at  
first by the facility of getting beaver while the woods were but little  
cleared and there was plenty of those animals. The case is greatly  
altered now. The beaver skins are not now to be had in New Eng-  
land, but from very remote places and at great prices. The trade is  
accordingly declining there; so that, far from being able to make hats  
in any quantity for exportation, they cannot supply their home  
demand; and it is well known that some thousand dozens are sent  
thither yearly from London, Bristol, and Liverpool, and sold cheaper  
than the inhabitants can make them.
