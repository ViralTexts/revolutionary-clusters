same. Does not this seem to indicate that the fire existed in the body, though in a quiescent state, before it was by any of these means excited, disengaged, and brought forth to action and to view? May it not constitute part, and even a principal part, of the solid substance of bodies? If this should be the case, kindling fire in a body would be nothing more than developing this inflammable principle, and setting it at liberty to act in separating the parts of that body, which then exhibits the appearances of scorching, melting, burning, &amp;c. When a man lights an hundred candles from the flame of one, without diminishing that flame, can it be properly said to have communicated all that fire? When a single spark from a flint, applied to a magazine of gunpowder, is immediately attended with this consequence, that the whole is in flame, exploding with immense violence, could all this fire exist first in the spark? We cannot conceive it. And thus we seem led to this supposition, that there is fire enough in all bodies to singe, melt, or burn them, whenever it is, by any means, set at liberty, so that it may exert itself upon them, or be disengaged from them. This liberty seems to be

in the construction of an instrument so new, and of which we could have so little experience, it is rather lucky that we should at first be so near the truth as we seem to be, and commit so few errors.  
There is another reason for sinking deeper the lower end of the rod, and also for turning it outwards under ground to some distance from the foundation; it is this, that water dripping from the eaves falls near the foundation, and sometimes soaks down there in greater quantities, so as to come near the end of the rod though the ground about it be drier. In such case, this water may be exploded, that is, blown into vapour, whereby a force is generated that may damage the foundation. Water reduced to vapour, is said to occupy 14,000 times its former space. I have sent a charge through a small glass tube, that has borne it well while empty, but when filled first with water, was shattered to pieces and driven all about the room: Finding no part of the water on the table, I suspected it to have been reduced to vapour; and was confirmed in that suspicion afterwards, when I had filled a like piece of tube with ink, and laid it on a sheet of clean paper, whereon, after the explosion, I could find neither any moisture nor any sully from the ink. This experiment of the explosion of water, which I believe was first made by that most ingenious electrician father Beccaria, may account for what we sometimes see in a tree struck by lightning, when part of it is reduced to fine splinters like a broom; the sap vessels being so many tubes containing a watry fluid, which when reduced to vapour, rends every tube length-ways. And perhaps it is this rarefaction of the fluids in animal bodies killed by lightning or electricity, that by separating its fibres, renders the flesh so tender, and apt so much sooner to putrify. I think too, that much of the damage done by lightning to stone and brick walls, may sometimes be owing to the explosion of water, found, during showers, running or lodging in the joints or small cavities or cracks that happen to be in the walls.

You seem to think highly of the importance of this discovery, as do many others on our side of the water. Here it is very little regarded; so little, that though it is now seven or eight years since it was made publick, I have not heard of a single house as yet attempted to be secured by it. It is true the mischiefs done by lightning are not so frequent here as with us, and those who calculate chances may perhaps find that not one death (or the destruction of one house) in a hundred thousand happens from that cause, and that therefore it is scarce worth while to be at any expence to guard against it. But in all countries there are particular situations of buildings more exposed than others to such accidents, and there are minds so strongly impressed with the apprehension of them, as to be very unhappy every time a little thunder is within their hearing; it may therefore be well to render this little piece of new knowledge as general and as well understood as possible, since to make us safe is not all its advantage, it is some to make us easy.

On the ground-floor in the chimney stood a gun, leaning against the back wall, nearly opposite to where the brass wire came down on the outside. The lightning fell upon the points, did no damage to the rod they were fix’d to; but the brass wire, all down till it came opposite to the top of the gun-barrel, was destroyed.

down which it seems to have pass’d, as, although it did not hurt the barrel, it damaged the butt of the stock, and blew up some bricks of the hearth. The brass wire below the hole in the wall remain’d good. No other damage, as I can learn, was done to the house. I am told the same house had formerly been struck by lightning, and much damaged, before these rods were invented.———  
  
  
Mr. William Maine’s Account of the Effects of Lightning on his Rod, dated at Indian Land, in South Carolina, Aug. 28, 1760.  
———I had a set of electrical points, consisting of three prongs, of large brass wire tipt with silver, and perfectly sharp, each about seven inches long; these were riveted at equal distances into an iron nut about three quarters of an inch square, and opened at top equally to the distance of six or seven inches from point to point, in a regular triangle. This nut was screwed very tight on the top of an iron rod of above half an inch diameter, or the thickness of a common curtain rod, composed of several joints, annexed by hooks turned at the ends of each joint, and the whole fixed to the chimney of my house by iron staples. The points were elevated (a), six or seven inches above the top of the chimney; and the lower joint sunk three feet in the earth, in a perpendicular direction.  
Thus stood the points on Tuesday last about five in the evening, when the lightning broke with a violent explosion on the chimney, cut the rod square off just under the nutt, and I am persuaded, melted the points, nut, and top of the rod, entirely up; as after the most diligent search, nothing of either was found (b), and the top of the remaining rod was cased over with a congealed solder. The lightning ran down the rod, starting almost all the staples (c), and unhooking the joints, without affecting the rod (d), except on the inside of each hook where the joints were coupled, the surface of which was melted (e), and left as cased over with solder. No part of the chimney was damaged (f), only at the foundation (g), where it was shattered almost quite round, and several bricks were torn out (h). Considerable cavities were made in the earth quite round the foundation, but most within eight or nine inches of the rod. It also shattered the bottom weather-board (i), at one corner of the house, and made a large hole in the earth by the corner post. On the other side of the chimney, it ploughed up several furrows in the earth, some yards in length. It ran down the inside of the chimney (k), carrying only soot with it; and filled the whole house with its flash (l), smoke, and dust. It tore up the hearth in several places (m), and broke some pieces of china in the beaufet (n). A copper tea kettle standing in the chimney was beat together, as if some great weight had fallen upon it (o); and three holes, each about half an inch diameter, melted through the bottom (p). What seems to me most surprising is, that the hearth under the kettle was not hurt, yet the bottom of the kettle was drove inward, as if the lightning proceeded from under it upwards (q), and the cover was thrown to the middle of the floor (r). The fire dogs, an iron loggerhead, an Indian pot, an earthen cup, and a cat, were all in the chimney at the time unhurt, though great part of the hearth was torn up

But to have a better chance of obtaining this end, the points should not be too near to the top of the chimney or highest part of the building to which they are affixed, but should be extended five or six feet above it; otherwise their operation in silently drawing off the fire (from such fragments of cloud as float in the air between the great body of cloud and the earth) will be prevented.

eless seem to indicate that the lightning was there: But as there is no mention of its having hurt any part of the beaufet, or of the walls of the house, I should rather ascribe that effect to the concussion of the air, or shake of the house by the explosion.  
Thus, to me it appears, that the house and its inhabitants were saved by the rod, though the rod itself was unjointed by the stroke; and that, if it had been made of one piece, and sunk deeper in the earth, or had entered the earth at a greater distance from the foundation, the mentioned small damages (except the melting of the points) would not have happened

of the rod near the foundation. And here we find the princi-  
pal defeét of this apparatus. “The rod not being carried to a  
  
Tuffcient diftance from the foundation, nor low enough to ar-  
  
rive at water, or a fufficient quantity of moift earth, the elec-  
tric fluid, accumulated near its lower end, quitted the rod near  
the furface of the earth, and, dividing itfelf in fearch of other  
paflages, produced the effects above-mentioned. On the whole,  
the Author, on very good grounds, concludes, that the houfe  
and its inhabitants were faved by the rod, and that, ‘ if. it had  
been made of one piece, and had been funk deeper in the earth,  
or had entered the earth at a greater diftance from the founda-

action of bodies on cach other, he infers that the fire probably  
exifted in thefe bodies, though in a quiefcent itate, before it  
was by any of thefe means excited, difengaged, and brought  
forth to action and to view. ‘ If this fhould be the cafe, he  
adds, kindling fire in a body would be nothing more than de-  
veloping this inflammable principle, and fetting it at liberty to  
act in feparating the parts of that body, which then exhibits  
the appearances of {corching, melting, burning, &amp;c. Whena  
man lights an hundred candles from the fame of one, without  
diminifhing that flame, can it be properly faid to have commu-

gives his own method by using a battery of four large glass  
jars, while at page 423 of the London edition of his ‘‘ Let-  
ters and Papers, etc.,” Franklin relates curious observations  
which are worth mentioning here. He says that he sent  
a charge of electricity ‘‘ through a small glass tube that had  
borne it well when empty, but when filled first with water  
was shattered to pieces and driven all about the room.  
Finding no part of the water on the table, I suspected it to  
have been reduced to vapor. I was confirmed in that sus-  
picion afterward when I had filled a like piece of tube with  
ink and laid it on a sheet of paper, whereon after the ex-  
plosion I could find neither any moisture nor any sully  
from the ink. This experiment of the explosion of water,  
which I believe was first made by that most ingenious  
electrician, Father Beccaxia, may account for what we  
sometimes see in a tree struck by lightning, when part of it  
is reduced to fine splinters like a broom; the sap vessels be-  
ing so many tubes containing a watery fluid, which, when  
reduced to vapor, sends every tube lengthways. And, per-  
haps it is this rarefaction of the fluids in animal bodies  
killed by lightning or electricity, that by separating its  
fibres renders the flesh so tender and apt so much sooner to  
putrefy. I think, too, that much of the damage done by  
lightning to stone and brick walls may sometimes be owing  
to the explosion of water found during showers, running  
or lodging in the joints or small cavities or cracks that hap-  
pen to be in the walls.”

London, in 1762, Franklin says: ‘* You seem to think highly  
of the importance of this discovery, as do many others on our  
side of the water. Here it is very little regarded; so little that  
though it is now seven or eight years since it was made public, I have  
not heard of a single house as yet attempted to be secured by it.’’*
