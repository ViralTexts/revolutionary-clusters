, yours by Capt. Babson to Newburry Port, and soon gave ease to my anxiety, at the same time that it excited gratitude and thankfullness to Heaven for the preservation you all experienced in the imminent Dangers which threatned you. You Express in both your Letters a degree of thankfulness. I hope it amounts to more than words, and that you will never be insensible to the particular preservation you have experienced in both your Voyages.  
You have seen how inadequate the aid of Man would have been, if the winds and the seas had not been under the particular goverment of that Being who streached out the Heavens as a span, who holdeth the ocean in the hollow of his hand, and rideth upon the wings of the wind.  
If you have a due sense of your preservation, your next consideration will be, for what purpose you are continued in Life?—It is not to rove from clime to clime, to gratify an Idle curiosity, but every new Mercy you receive is a New Debt upon you, a new obligation to a diligent discharge of the various relations in which you stand connected; in the first place to your Great Preserver, in the next to Society in General, in particular to your Country, to your parents and to yourself.  
The only sure and permanant foundation of virtue is Religion. Let this important truth be engraven upon your Heart, and that the foundation of Religion is the Belief of the one only God, and a just sense of his attributes as a Being infinately wise, just, and good, to whom you owe the highest reverence, Gratitude and Adoration, who superintends and Governs all Nature, even to Cloathing the lilies of the Field and hearing the young Ravens when they cry, but more particularly regards Man whom he created after his own Image and Breathed into him an immortal Spirit capable of a happiness beyond the Grave, to the attainment of which he is bound to the performance of certain duties which all tend to the happiness and welfare of Society and are comprised in one short sentance expressive of universal Benevolence, “Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thyself” and is elegantly defined by Mr. Pope in his Essay on Man  
  
“Remember, Man, the universal cause  
Acts not by partial, but by general laws  
And makes what happiness we justly call  
Subsist not in the good of one but all  
Theres not a Blessing individuals find  
But some way leans and hearkens to the kind.”  
  
Thus has the Supreme Being made the good will of Man towards his fellow creatures an Evidence of his regard to him, and to

re and found  
  
“Eden was tasteless till an Eve was there.”  
  
Justice, humanity and Benevolence are the duties you owe to society in general. To your Country the same duties are incumbent upon you with the additional obligation of sacrificeing ease, pleasure, wealth and life itself for its defence and security.  
To your parents you owe Love, reverence and obedience to all just and Equitable commands. To yourself—here indeed is a wide Field to expatiate upon. To become what you ought to be and, what a fond Mother wishes to see you, attend to some precepts and instructions from the pen of one who can have no motive but your welfare and happiness, and who wishes in this way to supply to you, the personal watchfulness, and care which a seperation from you, deprives you of at a period of Life when habits are easiest acquired, and fixed, and tho the advise may not be new, yet suffer it to obtain a place in your memory, for occasions may offer and perhaps some concuring circumstances give it weight and force.  
Suffer me to recommend to you one of the most usefull Lessons of Life, the knowledge and study of yourself. There you run the greatest hazard of being deceived. Self Love and partiality cast a mist before the Eyes, and there is no knowledge so hard to be acquired, nor of more benifit when once throughly understood. Ungoverned passions have aptly been compaired to the Boisterous ocean which is known to pro­duce the most terible Effects. “Passions are the Elements of life” but Elements which are subject to the controul of Reason. Who ever will candidly examine themselves will find some degree of passion, peevishness or obstinancy in their Natural tempers. You will seldom find these dissagreable ingredients all united in one, but the uncontroulable indulgence of either is sufficient to render the possessor unhappy in himself and dissagreable to all who are so unhappy as to be wittnesses of it, or suffer from its Effects.  
You my dear son are formed with a constitution feelingly alive, your passions are strong and impetuous and tho I have sometimes seen them hurry you into excesses, yet with pleasure I have observed a frankness and Generosity accompany your Efforts to govern and subdue them. Few persons are so subject to passion but that they can command themselves when they have a motive sufficiently strong, and those who are most apt to transgress will restrain themselves through respect and Reverence to Superiours, and even where they wish to recommend themselves to their equals. The due Government of the passions has been considered in all ages as a most valuable acquisition, hence an inspired writer observes, He that is slow to anger is better than the Mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city. This passion unrestrained by reason cooperating with power has produced the Subversion of cities, the desolation of countries, the Massacre of Nations, and filled the world with  
injustice and oppression.—Behold your own Country, your Native Land suffering from the Effects of Lawless power and Malignant passions, and learn betimes from your own observation and experience to govern and controul yourself. Having once obtained this self goverment you will find a foundation laid for happiness to yourself and usefullness to Mankind. “Virtue alone is happiness below,” and consists in cultivating and improveing every good inclination and in checking and subduing every propensity to Evil. I have been particular upon the passion of Anger, as it is generally the most predominant passion at your age, the soonest excited, and the least pains taken to subdue it.  
  
“What composes Man, can Man destroy.”  
  
I do not mean however to have you insensible to real injuries. He who will not turn when he is trodden upon is deficient in point of spirit, yet if you can preserve good Breeding and decency of Manners you will have an advantage over the agressor and will maintain a dignity of character which will always insure you respect even from the offender.  
  
I will not over burden your mind at this time. I mean to persue the Subject of Self-knowledge in some future Letter, and give you my Sentiments upon your future conduct in life when I feel disposed to reassume my pen. In the mean time be assured no one is more sincerely Interested in your happiness than your ever affectionate Mother,

‘* Your father’s letters came to Salem, yours to Newbury-  
port, and soon gave ease to my anxiety, at the same time that  
it excited gratitude and thankfulness to Heaven, for the pres-  
ervation you all experienced in the imminent dangers which  
threatened you. You express in both your letters a degree of  
thankfulness. I hope it amounts to more than words, and that  
you will never be insensible to the particular preservation you  
have experienced in both your voyages. You have seen how  
inadequate the aid of man would have been, if the winds and  
the seas had not been under the particular government of that  
Being, who ‘ stretched out the heavens as a span, * who ‘ hold-  
eth the ocean in the hollow of his hand,’ and ‘ rideth upon the  
wings of the wind.’  
  
‘* If you have a due sense of your preservation, your next  
consideration will be, for what purpose you are continued in  
life. It is not to rove from clime to clime, to gratify an idle  
curiosity ; but every new mercy you receive is a new debt  
upon you, a new obligation to a diligent discharge of the va-  
rious relations in which you stand connected ; in the first  
place, to your great Preserver ; in the next, to society in gen-  
eral ; in particular to your country, to your parents, and to  
yourself.  
  
‘*’The only sure and permanent foundation of virtue is reli-  
gion. Let this important truth be engraven upon your heart.  
And also, that the foundation of religion is the belief of the  
one only God, and a just sense of his attributes, as a being in-

reverence, gratitude, and adoration ; who superintends and

larly regards man, whom he created after his own image, and  
breathed into him an immortal spirit, capable of a happiness  
beyond the grave ; for the attainment of which he is bound to  
the performance of certain duties, which all tend to the happi-  
ness and welfare of society, and are comprised in one short  
sentence, expressive of universal benevolence, ‘ Thou shalt  
love thy neighbour as thyself.’ ”’  
  
** Justice, humanity, and benevolence are the duties you  
owe to society in general. To your country the same duties  
are incumbent upon you, with the additional obligation of sac-  
rificing ease, pleasure, wealth, and life itself for its defence  
and security. ‘To your parents you owe love, reverence, and  
obedience to all just and equitable commands. ‘T&#x27;o yourself,—  
here, indeed, is a wide field to expatiate upon. ‘To become  
what you ought to be, and what a fond mother wishes to see  
you, attend to some precepts and instructions from the pen of  
one, who can have no motive but your welfare and happiness,  
and who wishes in this way to supply to you the personal watch-  
fulness and care, which a separation from you deprived you of  
at a period of life, when habits are easiest acquired and fixed ;  
and, though the advice may not be new, yet suffer it to obtain  
a place in your memory, for occasions may offer, and perhaps  
some concurring circumstances unite, to give it weight and  
force.  
  
‘* Suffer me to recommend to you one of the most useful les-  
sons of life, the knowledge and study of yourself. There you  
run the greatest hazard of being deceived. Self-love and par-  
tiality cast a mist before the eyes, and there is no knowledge  
so hard to be acquired, nor of more benefit when once thor-  
oughly understood. Ungoverned passions have aptly been  
compared to the boisterous ocean, which is known to produce  
the most terrible effects. ‘ Passions are the elements of life,’  
but elements which are subject to the control of reason. Who-  
ever will candidly examine themselves, will find some degree  
of passion, peevishness, or obstinacy in their natural tempers.  
You will seldom find these disagreeable ingredients all united  
in one ; but the uncontrolled indulgence of either is sufficient  
to render the possessor unhappy in himself, and disagreeable  
to all who are so unhappy as to be witnesses of it, or suffer  
from its effects.  
  
‘* You, my dear son, are formed with a constitution feelingly  
alive ; your passions are strong and impetuous ; and, though  
I have sometimes seen them hurry you into excesses, yet with  
pleasure I have observed a frankness and generosity accompa-  
ny your efforts to govern and’subdue them. Few persons are  
so subject to passion, but that they can command themselves,

when they have a motive sufficiently strong ; and those who  
are most upt to transgress will restrain themselves through re-  
spect and reverence to superiors, and even, where they wish to  
recommend themselves, to their equals. The due government  
of the passions, has been considered in all ages as a most val-  
uable acquisition. Hence an inspired writer observes, ‘ He  
that is slow to anger, is better than the mighty ; ; and he that  
ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.’ This passion, coop-  
erating with power, and unrestrained by reason, has produced  
the subversion of cities, the desolation of countries, the massa-  
cre of nations, and filled the world with injustice and oppression.  
Behold your own country, your native land, suffering from the  
effects of lawless power and malignant passions, and learn  
betimes, from your own observation and experience, to govern  
and control yourself. Having once obtained this self-govern-  
ment, you will find a foundation laid for happiness to yourself  
and usefulness to mankind. ‘ Virtue alone is happiness below;’  
and consists in cultivating and improving every good inclina-  
tion, and in checking and subduing every propensity to evil.  
I have been particular upon the passion of anger, as it is gen-  
erally the most precominant passion at your age, the soonest ex-  
cited, and the least pains are taken to subdue it ;  
  
— ‘what composes man, can man destroy.’  
  
‘* 1 do not mean, however, to have you insensible to real in-  
juries. He who will not turn when he is trodden upon is defi-  
cient in point of spirit ; yet, if you can preserve good breed-  
ing and decency of manners, you will have an advantage over  
the aggressor, and will maintain a dignity of character, which  
will always insure you respect, even from the offender.  
  
**7T will not overburden your mind at this time. I mean to  
pursue the subject of self-knowledge in some future letter, and  
give you my sentiments upon your ‘future conduct in life, when  
T feei disposed to resume my pen.  
  
‘¢ In the mean time, be assured, no one is more sincerely in-  
terested in your happiness, than your ever affectionate moth-  
er.”’ — pp. 146 - 151.
