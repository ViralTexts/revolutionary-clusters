In mine of January 31. I informed you that Louisiana had been Transferred by the French Commissioner to our Commissioners on the 20th. of December, that nothing had officially passed on the occasion concerning the boundaries of the ceded Territory; but that Mr Laussat had confidentially signified that it did not comprehend any part of West Florida; adding at the same time that it extended westwardly to the Rio Bravo otherwise called Rio del Norde. Orders were accordingly obtained from the Spanish authority for the Delivery of all the posts on the West side of the Mississippi as well as on the Island of New Orleans. With resp⟨ect⟩ to the Posts in West Florida orders for the delivery were neither ⟨offered⟩ to nor demanded by our Commissioners. No instructions ⟨have in⟩ fact been ever given them to make the demand. This silence ⟨on the pa⟩rt of the Executive was deemed eligible first because [it] was forese⟨en that the⟩ demand would not only be rejected by the Spanish autho⟨rity at New⟩ Orleans which had in an official publication limited the cession westwardly by the Mississippi and the islan[d] of New Orleans but was apprehended as has turned out that the French commissioner might not be ready to support the demand and might even be disposed to second the Spanish opposition to it secondly because in the latter of these cases a serious check would be given to our title and in either of them a premature dilemma would result between an overt submission to the refusal and a resort to force thirdly because mere silence would be no bar to a plea at any time that a delivery of a part, particularly of the Seat of the Government, was a virtual delivery of the whole; whilst in the mean time, we could ascertain the views and claim the interposition of the French government and avail ourselves of that and any other favorable circumstances for effecting an amicable adjustment of the question with the Government of Spain. In this state of things, it was d

 It even deserves consideration that the use which Great Britain could make of the Territory in question, and the facility of seizing it, may become a casting motive with her to force Spain into war, contrary to the wishes and the policy of France.  
The Territory ceded to the United States is described in the words following “the Colony or Province of Louisiana with the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain, that it had when France possessed it, and such as it ought to be according to the Treaties subsequently passed between Spain and other States.”  
In expounding this threefold description the different forms used must be so understood as to give a meaning to each description and to make the meaning of each coincide with that of the others.
