oing to the dominions of France. For this violent and impolitic measure, which the final opinion of mankind will certainly condemn, she found colour in the saying, of some Writers of Reputation on public Law. A Passage of this kind from Vatel has been more than once quoted in these terms “Commodities particularly used in war and the importation of which to an enemy is prohibitted are called contraband goods. Such are arms military and naval stores, timber horses, and even provisions in certain junctures when there are hopes of reducing the enemy by famine.” [Heineceius

. The pride the reputation the interest of that administration forbade it.  
On our side to admit the pretension of Great Britain was still more impossible. We had every inducement of character right and interest against it.  
What was the natural and only issue out of this embarrassment? Plainly to leave the point unsettled—to get rid of it—to let it remain substantially where it was before the Treaty.  
This I have good ground to believe was the real understanding of the two negotiators; and the article has fulfilled their view.  
After enumerating specifically what articles shall be deemed contraband it proceeds thus—“And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the precise cases, in which alone provisions and other articles not generally contraband may be regarded as such, renders it expedient to provide against the inconveniences and misunderstandings which might thence arise: It is further agreed that whenever any such articles, so becoming contraband according to the existing laws of Nations, shall for that reason be seized, the same shall not be confiscated, but the owners thereof shall be speedily and completely indemnified; and the Captors or in their default the Government under whose authority they act shall pay to the Masters or Owners of such vessels the full value of all articles with a reasonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight and also the demurrage incident to such detention.”  
The difficulty of agreeing on the precise cases in which articles not generally contraband become so from particular circumstances is expressly assigned as the motive to the Stipulation which follows. This excludes the supposition that any cases whatever were intended to be

 the cases in which articles not generally contraband may from particular circumstances become so is expressly the existing laws of nations, in other words the laws of nations at the time the transaction happens. When these laws pronounce them contraband they may for that reason be seized; when otherwise they may not be seized. Each party is as free as the other to decide whether the laws of nations do in the given case pronounce them contraband or not, and neither is obliged to be governed by the opinion of the other. If one party on a false pretext of being authorised by the laws of nations makes a seizure, the other is at full liberty to contest it—to appeal to those laws and if it thinks fit, to oppose even to reprisals and war. This is the express tenor of the pr

rovided for in a subsequent part of the article. The implication therefore is that something more was intended to be embraced in the antecedent part.  
Let us first examine the fact whether all the cases of that kind are comprehended in the subsequent part of the article. I say they are not. The remaining clause of the article divides itself into two parts. The first describes the case of a vessel sailing for a port or place belonging to an enemy without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded or invested, and provides that in such case the vessel may be turned away but not detained nor her cargo, if not contraband, confiscated unless after notice she shall again attempt to enter: The second describes the case of a vessel or goods which had entered into such port or place before it was besieged blockaded or invested and declares that the one or the other shall not be liable to confiscation but shall be restored to the Owners thereof. These are the only cases described or provided for. A third which occurs on the sligh [t] est reflection is not mentioned—the case of a vessel going to a port or place which is beseiged blockaded  or invested, with notice of its being in that state when she commences her voyage or previous to her receiving notice from the beseiging blockading or investing party. This is left to the oper

ter the port by force. Wheaton and  
other eminent authorities hold that  
such notice is sufficient and accom­  
plishes all that the notice to the ship&#x27;s  
nation could, since the purpose of noti­  
fying the Government is simply to en­  
able It to give warning in turn to its  
sailing-masters.  
In 1794 Great Britain and the United  
States by treaty declared—and a simi­  
lar provision is in our treaties with  
most other powers—that:  
Whereas, it frequently happens that  
vessels sail for a port or place belonging  
to an enemy without knowing that the  
same is either besieged, blockaded or  
invested, it is agreed that every vessel  
so circumstanced may be turned away  
from such port or place, but she shall  
not be detained, nor her cargo, if not  
contraband, be confiscated, unless after  
notice she shall again attempt to enter.  
France acted upon precisely that line  
in several cases of treaty agreement;  
with Brazil in 1828, with Bolivia in  
1534, with Texas in 1839, with Ven­  
ezuela in 1843, and with Ecuador in  
1848, French writers on international  
law since those dates have, however,  
held that both notices must be given­  
general notice to the Government, and  
special notice to the ship attempting  
to enter a harbor under blockade.  
In the case of the Lafayette the own­  
ers might have given her warning, fo

Great Britain, however, insisted that in view  
of the fact that the whole male adult popu­  
 lation of France was engaged in war and that  
she was dependent upon outside sources  
for the support of her people, her enemies  
had a right to cut off this source of supply  
and thereby compel her to make peace in  
order to avert famine. Mr. Jeryerson  
 maintained his position as long as he was  
 Secretary of State, but after he left the  
Cabinet a compromise was made in the  
Jay treaty of 1794, the eighteenth article  
 of which provided:  
Whereas. The difficulty of agreeing on the preci  
cases in which alone provisions and other articles  
not generally contraband may be regarded as such,  
renders it expedient to provide against the incon  
veniences and misunderstandings which might  
thence arise; it is further agreed that whenever any  
such articles so becoming contraband, according to  
the existing laws of nations, shall for that reason b  
sized, the same shall not be confiscated, but the own-  
ers thereof shall be speedily and completelv indemni-  
 fed, and the captors, or, in their default, the Gov­  
ernment under whose authority they act, shall pay  
to the masters or owners of such vessels the full  
 value of all such articles, with a reasonable pront  
thereon, together with the freight, and also the  
demurrage incident to such detention.&quot;  
 This ar tice was denounced b the ol­  
lowers of Jerperson as a surrender to  
Great Britain of the principle of neutra
