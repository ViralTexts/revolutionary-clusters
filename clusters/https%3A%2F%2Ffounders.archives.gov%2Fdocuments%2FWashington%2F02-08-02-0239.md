Virginia 20th July 1770.  
  
I was honourd with your favour of the 18th of June about the last of that Month and read it with all the attention I was capable of but having been closely engaged with my Hay &amp; Wheat Harvests from that time till now I have not been able to enquire  
  
into the Sentiments of any of the Gentlemen of this side in respect to the Scheme of opening the Inland Navigation of Potomack by private Subscription—in the manner you have proposed—and therefore, any opinion which I may now offer on this head will be considered I hope as the result of my own private thinking—not of the Publick.  
That no person more intimately concernd in this Event wishes to see an undertaking of the sort go forward with more facility and ardour than I do, I can truely assure you; and will, at all times, give any assistance in my power to promote the design; but I leave you to judge from the Tryal, which before this you undoubtedly have made, how few there are (not immediately benefited by it) that will contribute any thing worthwhile to the work; and how many small sums are requisite to raise a large one.  
Upon your Plan of raising money, it appears to me that there will be found but two kinds of People who will Subscribe much towards it—Those who are actuated by motives of Publick Spirit; and those again, who from their proximity to the Navigation will reap the salutary effects of clearing the River. The number of the latter, you must be a competent judge of; those of the former, is more difficult to ascertain; for wch reason I own to you, that I am not without my doubts of your Schemes falling through, however

mentioned and gain considerable strength by it: I mean the monied Gentry; who tempted by lucrative views woud advance largely on Acct of the high Interest—This I am Inclind to think is the only method by which this desirable work will ever be accomplished in the manner it ought to be; for as to its becoming an object of Publick Expence I never expect to see it—Our Interests (in Virginia, at least) are too much divided—our Views too confind, if our Finances were better, to suffer that, which appears to redound to the advantage of a part of the Community only, to become a Tax upon the whole—tho^ in the Instance before Us, there is the strongest speculative Proof in the World of the immense advantages which Virginia &amp; Maryland might derive (and at a very small comparitive Expence) by making Potomack the Channel of Commerce between Great Britain and that immense Tract of Country which is unfolding to our view the advantages of which are too great, &amp; too obvious I shoud think to become the Subject of serious debate but which thro. illtimed Parsimony &amp; supiness may be wrested from us &amp; conducted thro. other Channels such as the Susquehanna (which I have seen recommended by some writers) the Lakes &amp;c.—how difficult it will be to divert it afterwards, time only can show. Thus far Sir I have taken the liberty of communicating my Sentiments on the different modes of establishing a fund but if from the efforts you have already made on the North side of Potomack it shoud be found that my fears are rather imaginary than real (as I heartily wish they may prove) I have no doubts but the same spirit may be stird up on the South side if Gentlemen of Influence in the Counties of Hampshire Frederick Loudoun &amp; Fairfax will heartily engage in it and receive all occasional Sums from those

Vircinta, 20th July, 1770,  
  
Sin: I was honored with your favor of the 18th  
of June, about the last of that month, and read it  
with all the attention I was capable of; from that  
time till now I have not been able to enquire into the  
sentiments of any of the gentlemen of this side in  
respect to the scheme of opening the inland naviga-  
tion of Potomac, vy private subscription, in the man-  
ner you have proposed—and, therefore, any opinion  
which [ may now offer on this head will be cousider-’  
ed I hope as the result of my own private thinking,  
nut of the public.  
  
That no person concerned in this event wishes to  
see an undertaking of the sort go forward wiih more  
sincerity and ardor than Ido, I can truly assure you;  
and wali at all times give any assistance in my power  
to promote the design; but I leave you to judge from  
the trial, which before this you have updoubtedly  
made, how few there are, (not immediately wenetit-  
ted by it), that will contribute any thing worth while  
to the work; and how many suall gums are requisite  
to raise a barge one.

bers were vested by the two legislatures with a kind of | as effectually answered by it: G. W.  
  
property in the navigation under certain restrictions  
and limitations, and to be reimbursed their first ad-  
vances with a high interest thereon, by a certain casy  
toll on all craft proportionate to their respective bur-  
thens, in the manner that 1 am told works of this sort  
are effected in the inland parts of England—or upon  
the plan of turnpike roads; you would add thereby a  
third set of men, to the two J] have mentioned and  
gain considerable strength by it. Imean the monied  
gentry; who, tempted by lucrative views, would ad-  
vanee largely on account of the high interest. This,  
Tam inclined to think, is the oniy method by which  
~ this desirable work will ever be accomplished in the  
manner it ought to be; for as to its becoming an ob-  
ject of public expense, I never expect to seeit. Our  
interests, (in Virginia, at least), are too much divided.  
Our views too confined, if our finances were better,  
to suffer that, which appears to redound to the advan  
tage of a part of the community only, to become a tax  
vpon the whole—though in the instance before us,  
there is the strongest speculative proof in the world  
to me of the immense advantages which Virginia and  
Maryland might derive, (and ata very small compa-  
rative expense), by making Potomac the ehannel of  
commerce betwecn Great Britain, and that immense  
territory; a tract of country, which is unfolding to  
our view the advantages of which are too great, and  
too obvious, I should thisk, to become the subject of  
serious debate, but which, through ill-timed parsimo-  
by and supineness, may he wrested from us and con-  
dueted through other chantels, such as the Susque-
