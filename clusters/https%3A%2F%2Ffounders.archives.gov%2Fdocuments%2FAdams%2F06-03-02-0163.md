Dear Sir  
  
The Course of Events, naturally turns the Thoughts of Gentlemen to the Subjects of Legislation and Jurisprudence, and it is a curious Problem what Form of Government, is most readily and easily adopted by a Colony, upon a Sudden Emergency. Nature and Experience have already pointed out the Solution of this Problem, in the Choice of Conventions and Committees of safety. Nothing is wanting in Addition to these to make a compleat Government, but the Appointment of Magistrates for the due Administration of Justice.  
Taking Nature and Experience for my Guide I have made the following Sketch, which may be varied in any one particular an infinite Number of Ways, So as to accommodate it to the different, Genius, Temper, Principles and even Prejudices of different People.  
A Legislative, an Executive and a judicial Power, comprehend the whole of what is meant and understood by Government. It is by ballancing each of these Powers against the other two, that the Effort in humane Nature towards Tyranny, can alone be checked and restrained and any degree of Freedom preserved in the Constitution.  
Let a full and free Representation of the People be chosen for an House of Commons.  
Let the House choose by Ballott twelve, Sixteen, Twenty four or Twenty Eight Persons, either Members of the House, or from the People at large as the Electors please, for a Council.  
Let the House and Council by joint Ballott choose a Governor, annually triennially or Septennially as you will.  
Let the Governor, Council, and House be each a distinct and independant Branch of the Legislature, and have a Negative on all Laws.  
Let the Lt. Governor, Secretary, Treasurer, Commissary, Attorney General and Solicitor General, be chosen annually, by joint Ballott of both Houses.  
Let the Governor with seven Councillors be a Quorum.  
Let all Officers and Magistrates civil and military, be nominated and appointed by the Governor, by and with the Advice and Consent of his Council.  
Let no Officer be appointed but at a General Council, and let Notice be given to all the Councillors, Seven days at least before a General Council.  
Let the Judges, at least of the Supream Court, be incapacitated by Law from holding any Share in the Legislative or Executive Power, Let their Commissions be during good Behaviour, and their Salaries ascertained and established by Law.  
Let the Governor have the Command of the Army, the Militia, Forts &amp;c.  
Let the Colony have a Seal and affix it to all Commissions.  
In this Way a Single Month is Sufficient without the least Convulsion or even Animosity to accomplish a total Revolution in the Government of a Colony.  
If it is thought more beneficial, a Law may be made by this new Legislature giving leaving to the People at large the Priviledge of choosing their Governor, and Councillors annually, as soon as affairs get into a more quiet Course.  
In adopting a Plan, in some Respects similar to this, human Nature would appear in its proper Glory asserting its own real Dignity, pulling down Tyrannies, at a single Exertion and erecting such new Fabricks, as it thinks best calculated to promote its Happiness.  
As you was last Evening polite enough to ask me for this Model, if such a Trifle will be of any service to you, or any gratification of Curiosity, here you have it, from, sir, your Friend and humble servant,

_ Philadelphia, Nov, 15th 1775.  
Dear Sir—The course of events naturally  
turns the thoughts of gentlemen to the sub*  
ji cts of legislation and jurisprudencc^ind it is  
a cruious problem, what form of government  
is most readily and eastly adopted by a colony  
; upon a sudden emergency. Nature and-rxpe  
rience have already pointed out the solution of  
j this problem in the choice of conventions and  
! committees of safety. Nothing is wanting in  
addition to these to make a complete govern­  
1 ment, hut the appointment, of magistrates for  
! the due administration of justice.  
Taking nature and experience for my guide  
I have made the following sketch, which may  
be varied in any one particular an infinite num­  
ber of ways so as to accomodate it to the dif­  
ferent geniuses, temper, principles and even  
prejudices of different people.  
A legislative, an executive and a judicial  
power comprehend the whole of what is meant  
and understood by government. It is by bal­  
ancing each of these powers against ihe other  
two, that the effort in human nature nrwards  
tyranny can alone lie checked dp restrained  
and any degree of freedom pieservtd in the  
constitution.  
Let a full and free representation be chosen  
lor a house of commons. Let the house choose  
by ballot twelve, sixteen, twenty four or twenty  
eight persons, either inembeis of the house or  
from the people at farge as the electors phase,  
for a council. Let the house and council hy  
joint ballot, choose a governor annually, trieni­  
ally or septenialiy, as you w ill. Lei the gover­  
nor, council and house, be each a distinct and  
independent branch of the legtslaure and have  
  
a negative on all laws.  
Let the Lieut. Governor, secretary, treasur­  
er, commissary, attorney general, and solicitor  
general be chosen annually, by joint ballot of  
| both houses. Let the governor with seven  
counsellors be a quorum Let all officers and  
magistrates,civ il ai;d military be nominated and  
appointed by the governor by and wjih the ad­  
vice and consent of his council. Let no officers  
be appointed but at a general council, and let  
notice be given to all the counsellors, seven  
days, at least, before a general council. Let  
the judges at least of the Supreme Court, be  
incapacitated, by law, from bolding any share  
of legislative power; let their commissions be  
during good behaviour, and their salaries as­  
certained and established by faw. Let the go­  
vernor have command of the army, militia,  
forts, See. Let the colony h3ve a seal and affix  
i&#x27;. to all commissions.  
In this way a single month is sufficient,with­  
out the least convulsion, or even animosity,to  
accomplish a total revolution in the govern­  
ment of a colony. If it is thought moie benefi­  
cial, a law may be made by this new legislature,  
leaving to the people, at large, the privilege of  
choosing their governor and counsellors annu­  
ally, *as soon as affairs get into a more quiet  
course.  
In adopting a plan in some resprets similar  
to this, human nature would appear in its pro­  
per glory, asserting its now real dignity, pull­  
ing down tyrannies at a single exertion and  
erecting such new fabrics, as it thinks best cal­  
culated to promoie its happiness.  
As you were last evening polite enough to  
ask me for this model, if such a trifle will be of  
any service to you, or any gratification to your  
curiosity, here you have it, from sir your friend  
and humble servant, JOHN ADAMS
