he partiality of the judges. I thought it therefore proper to enquire, not whom they had employed, but whom I ought to appoint to fulfil the intentions of the law. In making these appointments I put in a proportion of federalists equal I believe to the proportion they bear in numbers through the union generally. Had I known that your son had acted, it would have been a real pleasure to me to have preferred him to some who were named in Boston in what were deemed the same line of politics. To this I should have been led by my knolege of his integrity as well as my sincere dispositions towards yourself &amp; Mr. Adams.  
You seem to think it devolved on the judges to decide on the validity of the sedition law.

rtainty of human reason to wonder at it’s different results. Both of our political parties, at least the honest portions of them, agree conscientiously in the same object, the public good: but they differ essentially in what they deem the means of promoting that good. One side believe it best done by one composition of the governing powers, the other by a different one. One fears most the ignorance of the people: the other the selfishness of rulers independant of them. Which is right, time &amp; experience will prove. We think that one side of this experiment has been long enough tried, and proved not to promote the good of the many; &amp; that the other has not been fairly and sufficiently tried. Our opponents think the reverse. With whichever opinion the body of the nation concurs, that must prevail. My anxieties on the subject will never carry me beyond the use of fair &amp; honorable means, of truth and reason: nor have they ever lessened my esteem for moral worth, nor alienated my affections from a single friend, who did not first withdraw himself. Wherever this has happened I confess I have not been insensible to it: yet have ever kept myself open to a return of their justice. I conclude with sincere prayers for your health &amp; happiness that yourself &amp; Mr. Adams may long enjoy the tranquility you desire and merit, and see, in the prosperity of your family, what is the consummation of the last and warmest of human wishes.
