m next to examine it with relation to religion, and to endeavour to shew, that the Church of Rome has now the sanction of a legal establishment, in the province of Quebec. In order to do this the more satisfactorily, I beg leave to adopt the definition given of an established religion, by a certain writer, who has taken great pains to evince the contrary. “An established religion,” says he, “is a religion, which the civil authority engages, not only to protect, but to support.” This act makes effectual

t only for the protection, but for the permanent support of Popery, as is evident from the following clause, “And for the more perfect security and ease of the minds of the inhabitants of the said province, it is hereby declared, that his Majesty’s subjects professing the religion of the church of Rome in the said province, may have, hold, and enjoy, the free exercise of the religion of the church of Rome, subject to the King’s supremacy, &amp;c. and that the clergy of the said church may hold, receive and enjoy their accustomed dues and rights, &amp;c.”  
This is represented as a bare permission to the clergy, to enjoy the usual emoluments of their functions; and not as a legal provision for their support. Much stress seems to be laid on the word may w

ent regard for the Protestant religion. The act first declares, “That his Majesty’s subjects professing the religion of the Church of Rome may have, hold and enjoy the free exercise of their religion; and that the clergy of the said church may hold, receive and enjoy their accustomed dues and rights.” Then follows this clause:

But if there should be any, who think, that the indulgence granted does not extend to a perfect establishment, and that it may be justified by the terms of the treaty and the subsequent conduct of the Canad
