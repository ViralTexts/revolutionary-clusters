That Oath.  
We commend the following oath to  
the attention of several of our good  
friends whom we have in vain endea-­  
rored to convince that army and navy  
officers were required before the late  
war between the States to take the oath  
to support the Constitution of the United  
States. It is a copy of one on file in  
the Navy Department at Washington,  
and was taken in 1860 by the newly-­  
ppointed Consul to Melbourne. The  
New York Herald is entitled to the  
credit of unearthing this oath:  
&quot;I, James M. Morgan, appointed an  
acting midshipman in the navy of the  
United States, do solemnly swear to  
ear true allegiance to the United States  
of America, and to serve them honestly  
and faithfully against all their enemies
