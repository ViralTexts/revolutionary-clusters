Paris,  
July 30th, 1796,  
  
As censure is but awkwardly softened by apology, I shall offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful crisis to which your double politics have conducted the affairs of your country requires an investigation uncramped by ceremony.  
There was a time when the fame of America, moral and political, stood fair and high in the world. The lustre of her revolution extended itself to every individual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to respect in Europe. Neither meanness nor ingratitude had then mingled itself into the composition of her character. Her resistance to the attempted tyranny of England left her unsuspected of the one, and her open acknowledgment of the aid she received from France precluded all suspicion of the other. The Washington of politics had not then appeared.  
At the time I left America (April 1787) the continental convention that formed the federal constitution was on the point of meeting. Since that time new schemes of politics and new distinctions of parties, have arisen. The term Antifederalist has been applied to all those who combated the defects of that constitution, or opposed the measures of your administration. It was only to the absolute necessity of establishing some federal authority, extending equally over all the States, that an instrument, so inconsisent as the present federal constitution is, obtained a suffrage. I would have voted for it myself, had I been in America, or even for a worse rather than have had none; provided it contained the means of remedying its defects by the same appeal to the people by which it was to be established. It is always better policy to leave removeable errors to expose themselves, than to hazard too much in contending against them theoretically.  
I have introduced those observations, not only to mark the general difference between antifederalist and anti-constitutionalist, but to preclude the effect, and even the application, of the former of those terms to myself. I declare myself opposed to several matters in the constitution, particularly to the manner in which,  
  
what is called the Executive, is formed, and to the long duration of the Senate; and if I live to return to America I will use all my endeavours to have them altered. I also declare myself opposed to almost the whole of your administration; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not even perfidious, as I shall shew in the course of this letter. But as to the point of consolidating the States into a federal government, it so happens, that the proposition for that purpose came originally from myself. I proposed it in a letter to Chancellor Livingston in the spring of the year 1782, whilst that gentleman was minister for foreign affairs. The five per cent. duty recommended by Congress had then fallen through, having been adopted by some of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode Island, and repealed by Virginia after it had been consented to. The proposal in the letter I allude to was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a continental legislative body to Congress; for, in order to have any law of the Union uniform, the case could only be, that either Congress, as it then stood, must frame the law, and the States severally adopt it without alteration, or, the States must elect a Continental Legislature for the purpose. Chancellor Livingston, Robert Morris, Governeur Morris and myself had a meeting at the house of Robert Morris on the subject of that letter. There was no diversity of opinion on the proposition for a Continental Legislature. The only difficulty was on the manner of bringing the proposition forward. For my own part, as I considered it as a remedy in reserve, that could be applied at any time, when the States saw themselves wrong enough to be put right (which did not appear to me to be the case at that time) I did not see the propriety of urging it precipitately, and declined being the publisher of it myself. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will scarcely have the hardiness to apply to me the term of antifederalist. But I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this; for the proposition for electing a Continental Convention to form the Continental Government is one of the subjects treated of in the pamphlet Common Sense.  
Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbish that might otherwise have lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the present Federal Constitution and your administration began. It was very well said by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that “thirteen staves and ne’er  
  
a hoop will not make a barrel,” and as any kind of hooping the barrel, however, defectively executed, would be better than none, it was scarcely possible but that considerable advantages must arise from the federal hooping of the States. It was with pleasure that every sincere friend to America beheld, as the natural effect of union, her rising prosperity; and it was with grief they saw that prosperity mixed, even in the blossom, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your administration almost in the moment of its commencement. The lands obtained by the revolution were lavished upon partizans; the interest of the disbanded soldier was sold to the speculator; injustice was acted under the pretence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron of the fraud. From such a beginning what could be expected, but what has happened? A mean and servile submission to the insults of one nation, treachery and ingratitude to another.  
Some vices make their approach with such a splendid appearance, that we scarcely know to what class of moral distinctions they belong. They are rather virtues corrupted, than vices originally. But meanness and ingratitude have nothing equivocal in their character. There is not a trait in them that renders them doubtful. They are so originally vice, that they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into existence with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have found protection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.  
As the Federal Constitution is a copy, not quite so base as the original, of the form of the British government, an imitation of its vices was naturally to be expected. So intimate is the connection between form and practice, that to adopt the one is to invite the other. Imitation is naturally progressive, and is rapidly so in matters that are vicious.  
Soon after the Federal Constitution arrived in England, I received a letter from a female literary correspondent (a native of New York) very well mixed with friendship, sentiment and politics. In my answer to that letter I permitted myself to ramble into the wilderness of imagination, and to anticipate what might hereafter be the condition of America. I had no idea that the picture I then drew was realizing so fast, and still less that, Mr. Washington was hurrying it on. As the extract I allude to is congenial and with the subject I am upon, I here transcribe it.  
  
Impressed, as I was, with apprehensions of this kind, I had America constantly in mind in all the publications I afterwards made. The first, and still more, the second part of Rights of Man bear evident marks of this watchfulness; and the Dissertation on First Principles of Government goes more directly to the point than either of the former. I now pass on to other subjects.  
It will be supposed by those into whose hands this letter may fall, that I have some personal resentment against you; I will therefore settle this point before I proceed farther.  
If I have any resentment, you must acknowledge that I have not been hasty in declaring it; neither would it be now declared (for what are private resentments to the public) if the cause of it did not unite itself as well with your public as your private character, and with the motives of your political conduct.  
The part I acted in the American revolution is well known; I shall not here repeat it. I know also that had it not been for the aid received from France in men, money and ships, that your cold and unmilitary conduct (as I shall shew in the course of this letter) would, in all probability, have lost America; at least she would not have been the independent nation she now is. You slept away your time in the field till the finances of the country were completely exhausted, and you have but little share in the glory of the final event. It is time, sir, to speak the undisguised language of historical truth.  
Elevated to the chair of the Presidency you assumed the merit of every thing to yourself, and the natural ingratitude of your constitution began to appear. You commenced your Presidential carreer by encouraging and swallowing the grossest adulation, and you travelled America from one end—to the other, to put yourself in the way of receiving it. You have as many addresses in your chest as James the II. As to what were your views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are little enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from expressions of your own; but the partizans of your politics have divulged the secret.  
John Adams has said (and John, it is known, was always a speller after places and offices, and never thought his little services were highly enough paid) John has said, that as Mr. Washington had no child, that the Presidency should be made hereditary in the family of Lund Washington. John might then have  
  
counted upon some fine-cure for himself and a provision for his descendants. He did not go so far as to say also, that the Vice Presidency should be hereditary in the family of John Adams. He prudently left that to stand upon the ground, that one good turn deserves another.  
John Adams is one of those men who never contemplated the origin of government, or comprehended any thing of first principles. If he had, he must have seen that the right to set up and establish hereditary government never did, and never can, exist in any generation, at any time whatever; that it is of the nature of treason; because it is an attempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time, and of all succeeding generations. It is of a degree beyond common treason. It is a sin against nature. The equal right of generations is a right fixed in the nature of things. It belongs to the son when of age, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would himself deny the right that any former deceased generation could have to decree authoritatively a succession of Governors over him, or over his children; and yet he assumes the pretended right, treasonable as it is, of acting it himself. His ignorance is his best excuse.  
John Jay has said (and this John was always the sycophant of every thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America to Grenville in England) John Jay has said, that the Senate should have been appointed for life. He would then have been sure of never wanting a lucrative appointment for himself, or have had any fears about impeachments. These are the disguised traitors that call themselves federalists.  
Could I have known to what degree of corruption &amp; perfidy the administrative part of the government in America had descended, I could have been at no loss to have understood the reservedness of Mr. Washington towards me, during my imprisonment in this Luxembourg. There are cases in which silence is a loud language.  
I will here explain the cause of my imprisonment, and return to Mr. Washington afterwards.  
As my citizenship in America was not altered or diminished, by any thing I had done in Europe (on the contrary it ought to have been considered as strengthened, for it was the American principle of government that I was endeavouring to spread in  
  
Europe) and as it is the duty of every government to charge itself with the care of any of its citizens who may happen to fall under an arbitrary persecution abroad, and is also one of the reasons for which Ambassadors or Ministers are appointed,—it was the duty of the executive department in America to have made (at least) some enquiries about me, as soon as it heard of my imprisonment. But if this had not been the case, that government owed it to me on every ground and principle of honor and gratitude. Mr. Washington owed it to me on every score of private acquaintance, I will not now say, friendship; for it has for some time been known, by those who know him, that he has no friendships; that he is incapable of forming any; he can serve or desert a man or a cause with constitutional indifference; and it is this cold hermophrodite faculty that imposed itself upon the world, and was credited for a while by enemies as by friends, for prudence, moderation and impartiality.  
I had then been imprisoned seven months, and the silence of the executive government of America, Mr. Washington, upon the case and upon every thing respecting me, was explanation enough to Robespierre that he might proceed to extremities.  
A violent fever which had nearly terminated my existence, was, I believe, the circumstance that preserved it. I was not in a condition to be removed, or to know of what was passing, or of what had passed for more than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The first thing I was informed of was the fall of Robespierre.  
About a week after this Mr. Monroe arrived to supercede Gouverneur Morris, and as soon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be read, I found a way to convey one to him, by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the prison; and whose unabated friendship to me, from whom he had never received any service, and with difficulty accepted any recompence, puts the character of Mr. Washington to shame.  
In a few days I received a message from Mr. Monroe, conveyed to me in a note from an intermediate person, with assurance of his friendship, and expressing a desire that I would rest the case in his hands. After a fortnight or more had passed and hearing nothing further, I wrote to a friend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requesting him to inform me what was the true situation of things with respect to me. I was sure that  
  
something was the matter. I began to have hard thoughts of Mr. Washington; but I was unwilling to encourage them.  
In about then days I received an answer to my letter in which the writer says:  
I was now at no loss to understand Mr. Washington and his new fangled faction, and that their policy, was silently to leave me to fall in France. They were rushing as fast as they could venture, without awakening the jealousy of America, into all the vices and corruptions of the British government; and it was no more consistent with the policy of Mr. Washington, and those who immediately surrounded him, than it was with that of Robespierre or of Pitt, that I should survive. They have however, missed the mark and the reaction is up themselves.  
Upon the receipt of the letter just alluded to, I sent a memorial to Mr. Monroe which the reader will find in the appendix, and I received from him the following answer. It is dated the 18th of September, but did not come to hand till about the 10th of October. I was then falling into a relapse, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not to be had, and the abscess in my side, the consequence of these things, and of the want of air and exercise, was beginning to form and which has continued immoveable ever since. Here follows Mr. Monroe’s letter.  
The part in Mr. Monroe’s letter in which he speaks of the President (Mr. Washington) is put in soft language. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr. Washington had said formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact is, not only that Mr. Washington had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as the letter stated; but he did not so much as say to him, enquire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in prison or out, or see if there is any assistance we can give him.  
While these matters were passing the liberations from the prisons were numerous; from twenty to forty in the course of almost every twenty four hours[.] The continuance of my imprisonment, after a new minister had arrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months, was a matter so obviously strange, that I found the character of the American government spoken of in very unqualified terms of reproach; not only by those who still remained in prison, but by those who were liberated, and by persons who had access to the prison  
  
from without. Under these circumstances I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found occasion, among other things to say:  
The case, so far as it respected Mr. Monroe was, that having to get over the difficulties which the strange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had thrown in the way of a successor, and having no authority from the American government to speak officially upon any thing relating to me, he found himself obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual members; for though Robespierre was overthrown, the Robespierrian members of the Committee of Public Safety still remained in considerable force, and had they found out that Mr. Monroe had no official authority upon the case, they would have paid little or no regard to his reclamation of me. In the mean time my health was suffering exceedingly, the dreary prospect of winter was coming on, and imprisonment was still a thing of danger.  
After the Robespierrian members of the Committee were removed by the expiration of their time of serving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was liberated the 4th of November [1794]. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the beginning of August before. All that period of my imprisonment, at least, I owe not to Robespierre, but to his colleague in projects, George Washington. Immediately upon my liberation Mr. Monroe invited me to his house, where I remained more than a year and an half; and I speak of his aid and his friendship, as an open hearted man will always do in such a case, with respect and gratitude.  
Soon after my liberation the Convention passed an unanimous vote to invite me to return to my seat among them. The times were still unsettled and dangerous, as well from without as from within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the constitution not settled. I chose, however, to accept the invitation; for as I undertake nothing but what I believe to be right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I was willing also to shew, that, as I was not of a cast of mind to be deterred by prospects or retro-prospects of danger, so neither were my principles to be weakened by misfortune, or perverted by disgust.  
Being now once more abroad in the world I began to find that I was not the only one who had conceived an unfavourable opinion of Mr. Washington. It was evident that his character was on the decline as well among Americans as among foreigners of different nations. From being the chief of a government, he  
  
had made himself the chief of a party; and his integrity was questioned, for his politics had a doubtful appearance. The mission of Mr. Jay to London, notwithstanding there was an American minister there already, had then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It appeared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in mystery, which every day served either to encrease or to explain into matter of suspicion.  
In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Washington as President had sent Gouverneur Morris to London as his secret agent to have some communication with the British ministry. To cover the agency of Morris it was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Morris to borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted to pass uncontradicted. The event of Morris’s negociation was, that Mr. Hammond was sent minister from England to America, and Pinckney from America to England, and himself minister to France. If while Morris was minister in France he was not an emissary of the British ministry and the coalesced powers, he gave strong reasons to suspect him of it. No one who saw his conduct, and heard his conversation, could doubt his being in their interest; and had he not got off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been in arrestation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was making after him.  
A great bustle has been made by Mr. Washington about the conduct of Genet in America; while that of his own minister, Morris, in France was infinitely more reproachable. If Genet was imprudent or rash, he was not treacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French revolution in every stage of it. But, notwithstanding this conduct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr. Washington, in a letter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on the complaint and request of the Committee of Public Safety, assures him, that though he had complied with that request, he still retained the same esteem and friendship for him as before. This letter Morris was foolish enough to tell of; and, as his own character and conduct were notorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that of implicating the character of the writer. Morris still loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Washington is still in correspondence with him; Mr. Washington ought therefore to expect, especially since his  
  
conduct in the affair of Jay’s treaty, that France must consider Morris and Washington as men of the same description. The chief difference, however, between the two is (for in politics there is none) that the one is profligate enough to profess an indifference about moral principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the want of them.  
About three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay to Grenville on the subject of the capture of American vessels by British cruisers appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris. Every thing was of a-piece. Every thing was mean. The same kind of character went to all circumstances public or private. Disgusted at this national degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr. Washington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Washington) on the 22d of February (1795) under cover to the then Secretary of State (Mr. Randolph) and entrusted the letter to Mr. Letombe, who was appointed French consul to Philadelphia, and was on the point of taking his departure. When I supposed Mr. Letombe had sailed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as I was then in his house, I shewed it to him. He expressed a wish that I would recall it, which he supposed might be done, as he had learned that Mr. Letombe had not then sailed. I agreed to do so, and it was returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Monroe.  
The letter, however, will now reach Mr. Washington publicly, in the course of this work.  
About the month of September following, I had a severe relapse, which gave occasion to the report of my death. I had felt it coming on a considerable time before, which occasioned me to hasten the work I had then in hand, the Second part of the Age of Reason. When I had finished that work, I bestowed another letter on Mr. Washington, which I sent under cover to Mr. Benj. Franklin Bache of Philadelphia. The letter is as follows.

r. Monroe.  
That this letter was not written in very good temper is very evident; but it was just such a letter as his conduct appeared to me to merit, and every thing on his part since has served to confirm that opinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his silence with respect to my imprisonment in France, some of his faction has furnished me with it. What I here allude to is a publication in  
  
a Philadelphia paper, copied afterwards into a New York paper, both under the patronage of the Washington faction, in which the writer, still supposing me in prison in France, wonders at my lengthy respite from the scaffold; and he marks his politics still further by saying:  
I am not refuting or contradicting the fals[e]hood of this publication, for it is sufficiently notorious; neither am I censuring the writer; on the contrary I thank him for the explanation he has incautiously given of the principles of the Washington faction. Insignificant, however, as the piece is, it was capable of having had some ill effect, had it arrived in France during my imprisonment and in the time of Robespierre; and I am not uncharitable in supposing that this was the intention of the writer.  
I have now done with Mr. Washington on the score of private affairs. It would have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been such as not to have merited these reproaches. Errors or caprices of the temper can be pardoned and forgotten; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart, such as Mr. Washington is capable of acting, is not to be washed away. I now proceed to other matter.  
After Jay’s note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the character of every thing that was to follow might be easily foreseen; and it was upon this anticipation that my letter of February 22d was founded. The event has proved, that I was not mistaken, except that it has been much worse than I expected.  
It would naturally occur to Mr. Washington, that the secrecy of Jay’s mission to England, where there was already an American minister, could not but create some suspicion in the French government; especially as the conduct of Morris had been notorious, and the intimacy of Mr. Washington with Morris was known.  
The character, which Mr. Washington has attempted to act in the world, is a sort of non-describable, cameleon-coloured thing, called prudence. It is, in many cases, a substitute for principle, and is so nearly allied to hypocrisy, that it easily slides into it. His genius for prudence furnished him in this instance with an expedient, that served, as is the natural and general character of all expedients, to diminish the embarrassments of the moment and multiply them afterwards; for he authorised it to be made known to the French government, as a confidential matter  
  
(Mr. Washington should recollect that I was a member of the Convention, &amp; had the means of knowing what I here state) he authorized it, I say, to be made known, and that for the purpose of preventing any uneasiness to France on the score of Mr. Jay’s mission to England, that the object of that mission, and of Mr. Jay’s authority, was restricted to that of demanding the surrender of the western posts and indemnification for the cargoes captured in American vessels. Mr. Washington knows that this was untrue; and knowing this, he had good reason to himself for refusing to furnish the House of Representatives with copies of the instructions given to Jay; as he might suspect, among other things, that he should also be called upon for copies of instructions given to other ministers, and that in the contradiction of instructions his want of integrity would be detected. Mr. Washington may now, perhaps, learn, when it is too late, to be of any use to him, that a man will pass better through the world with a thousand open errors upon his back, than in being detected in ONE sly fals[e]hood. When one is detected, a thousand are suspected.  
The first account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being negotiated by Mr. Jay (for nobody suspected any) came in an English newspaper, which announced that a treaty offensive and defensive had been concluded between the United States of America and England. This was immediately denied by every American in Paris, as an impossible thing; and though it was disbelieved by the French, it imprinted a suspicion that some underhand business was going forward. At length the treaty itself arrived, and every well-affected American blushed with shame.  
It is curious to observe how the appearances of character will change, whilst the root that produces them remains the same. The Washington administration having waded through the slough of negociation, and whilst it amused France with professions of friendship contrived to injure her, immediately throws off the hypocrite, and assumes the swaggering air of a bravado. The party papers of that imbecile administration were on this occasion filled with paragraphs about Sovereignty. A paltroon may boast of his sovereign right to let another kick him, and this is the only kind of sovereignty shewn in the treaty with England. But these dashing paragraphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for France; without whose assistance in men,  
  
money and ships, Mr. Washington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of his military talents I shall speak hereafter.  
I mean not to enter into any discussion of any article of Jay’s treaty: I shall speak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be justified on the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles of the treaty pre-existing with France. But the sovereign right of explanation does not lie with George Washington and his man Timothy; France, on her part, has, at least, an equal right; and when nations dispute, it is not so much about words as about things.  
A man, such as the world calls, a sharper, and versed, as Jay must be supposed to be, in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into engagements, and make bargains in such a manner as to cheat some other party, without that party being able, as the phrase is, to take the law of him. This often happens in the cabalistical circle of what is called law. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national scale of treaties, it is too despicable to be defended, or to be permitted to exist. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay’s treaty is founded, so far as it has relation to the treaty pre-existing with France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and perverts all the great articles of that treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty to England with whom France is at war.  
The Washington administration shews great desire, that the treaty between France and the United States be preserved. Nobody can doubt their sincerity upon this matter. There is not a British minister, a British merchant, or a British agent or sailor in America, that does not anxiously wish the same thing. The treaty with France serves now as a passport to supply England with naval stores and other articles of American produce, whilst the same articles, when coming to France, are made contraband or seizable by Jay’s treaty with England. The treaty with France says, that neutral ships make neutral property, and thereby gives protection to English property on board American ships; and Jay’s treaty delivers up French property on board American ships to be seized by the English. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour, and of the preservation of treaties, whilst such a bare-faced treachery as this stares the world in the face.  
The Washington administration may save itself the trouble of  
  
proving to the French government its most faithful intentions of preserving the treaty with France; for France has now no desire that it should be preserved. She had nominated an Envoy extraordinary to America, to make Mr. Washington and his government a present of the treaty, and to have no more to do with that or with him. It was, at the same time, officially declared to the American minister at Paris, that the French Republic had rather have the American government for an open enemy than a treacherous friend. This, sir, together with the internal distractions caused in America, and the loss of character in the world, is the eventful crisis, alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to which your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It is time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.  
How France would have conducted herself towards America and American commerce after all treaty stipulations had ceased, and under the sense of services rendered and injuries received, I know not. It is, however, an unpleasant reflection, that in all national quarrels, the innocent, and even the friendly, part of the community, become involved with the culpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from America continued to manifest an invariable attachment in the general mass of the people to their original ally, in opposition to the new-fangled Washington faction,—the resolutions that had been taken were suspended. It happened also fortunately enough, that Gouverneur Morris was not minister at this time.  
There is, however, one point that yet remains in embryo, and which, among other things, serves to shew the ignorance of the Washington treaty-makers, and their inattention to pre-existing treaties when they were employing themselves in framing or ratifying the new treaty with England.  
The second article of the treaty of commerce between the United States and France says:  
All the concessions therefore made to England by Jay’s treaty are, through the medium of this second article in the preexisting treaty, made to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and can be exercised by her as a matter of right, the same as by England.  
In what a fraudulent light must Mr. Washington’s character appear in the world, when his declarations and his conduct are compared together! Here follows the letter he wrote to the  
  
Committee of Public Safety whilst Jay was negociating in profound secrecy this treacherous treaty.  
Was it by entering into a treaty with England, to surrender French property on board American ships to be seized by the English, whilst English property on board American ships was declared by the French treaty not to be seizable, that the bonds of friendship between America and France were to be drawn the closer? Was it by declaring naval stores contraband when coming to France, when by the French treaty they were not contraband when going to England, that the connection between France and America was to be advanced? Was it by opening the American ports to the British navy in the present war, from which ports that same navy had been expelled by the aid solicited from France in the American war (and that aid gratuitously given) that the gratitude of America was to be shewn, and the solicitude spoken of in the letter demonstrated?  
As the letter was addressed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr Washington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be seen by any other eye than that of Robespierre, or be heard by any other ear than that of the Committee; that it would pass as a whisper across the Atlantic, from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate. It was calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee all suspicion upon Jay’s mission to England, and, in this point of view, it was suited to the circumstances of the moment then passing; but as the event of that mission has proved the letter to be hypocritical, it serves no other purpose of the present moment than to shew that the writer is not to be credited. Two circumstances served to make the reading of the letter necessary in the Convention. The one was, that those who succeeded on the fall of Robespierre, found it most proper to act with publicity; the other, to extinguish the suspicions which the strange conduct of Morris had occasioned in France.  
When the British treaty, and the ratification of it by Mr. Washington, was known in France, all furthur declarations from him of his good disposition, as an ally and a friend, passed for so many cyphers; but still it appeared necessary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It is stipulated in the British treaty, that commissioners are to report at the end of two years on the case of neutral ships making neutral property. In the mean time neutral ships do not make neutral property, according to the British  
  
treaty, and they do, according to the French treaty. The preservation, therefore, of the French treaty became of great importance to England, as by that means she can employ American ships as carriers, whilst the same advantage is denied to France. Whether the French treaty could exist as a matter of right after this clandestine perversion of it, could not but give some apprehensions to the partizans of the British treaty, and it became necessary to them to make up, by fine words, what was wanting in good actions.  
An opportunity offered to that purpose. The Convention, on the public reception of Mr. Monroe, ordered the American flag and the French flag to be displayed unitedly in the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made a present of an American flag for the purpose. The Convention returned this compliment by sending a French flag to America, to be presented by their minister, Mr. Adet, to the American government. This resolution passed long before Jay’s treaty was known or suspected; it passed in the days of confidence; but the flag was not presented by Mr. Adet till several months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Washington made this the occasion of saying some fine things to the French Minister, and the better to get himself into tune to do this, he began by saying the finest things of himself.  
Mr. Washington having expended so many fine phrases upon himself, was obliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them “wonderful people!” The coalesced powers acknowledge as much.  
It is laughable to hear Mr. Washington talk of his sympathetic feelings, who has always been remarked, even among his friends, for not having any. He has, however, given no proof of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums he so liberally pays to himself, on the score of the American revolution, the reality of them may be questioned; and since he has forced them so much into notice, it is fair to examine his pretentions.  
A stranger might be led to suppose from the egotism with which Mr. Washington speaks, that himself, and himself only, had generated, conducted, compleated, and established the revolution: In fine, that it was all his own doing.  
In the first place, as to the political part, he had no share in it; and therefore the whole of that is out of the question with respect to him. There remains then only the military part, and it would  
  
have been prudent in Mr. Washington not to have awakened enquiry upon that subject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was disposed to take away the laurels, that, whether they were acquired or not, had been given.  
Mr. Washington’s merit consisted in constancy. But constancy was the common virtue of the revolution. Who was there that was inconstant? I know of but one military defection, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection, among those who made themselves eminent, when the revolution was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.  
But when we speak of military character, something more is to be understood than constancy; and something more ought to be understood than the Fabian system of doing nothing. The nothing part can be done by any body. Old Mrs. Thompson, the housekeeper of head-quarters (who threatened to make the sun and the wind shine through Rivington of New-York) could have done it as well as Mr. Washington. Deborah would have been as good as Barak.  
Mr. Washington had the nominal rank of Commander in Chief; but he was not so in fact. He had in reality only a separate command. He had no controul over, or direction of, the army to the northward, under Gates, that captured Burgoyne; nor of that to the south, under Green, that recovered the southern States. The nominal rank, however, of Commander in chief, served to throw upon him the lustre of those actions, and to make him appear as the soul and centre of all the military operations in America.  
Nothing was done in the campaigns of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where Gen. Washington commanded, except the taking Stony Point by Gen. Wayne. The Southern States in the mean time were over-run by the enemy. They were afterwards recovered by Gen. Greene, who had in a very great measure created the army that accomplished that recovery. In all this Gen. Washington had no share. The Fabian system of war, followed by him, began now to unfold itself with all its evils, for what is Fabian war without Fabian means to support it.  
The finances of Congress, depending wholly on emissions of paper money, were exhausted. Its credit was gone. The continental treasury was not able to pay the expence of a brigade of  
  
waggons to transport the necessary stores to the army, and yet the sole object, the establishment of the revolution, was a thing of remote distance. The time I am now speaking of is the latter end of the year 1780.  
In this situation of things it was found not only expedient but absolutely necessary for Congress to state the whole case to its ally. I knew more of this matter (before it came into Congress or was known to General Washington) of its progress, and its issue, than I chuse to state in this letter. Col. John Laurens was sent to France as Envoy Extraordinary on this occasion, and by a private agreement between him and me I accompanied him. We sailed from Boston in the Alliance frigate, Feb. 11th, 1781. France had already done much in accepting and paying bills drawn by Congress. She was now called upon to do more. The event of Col. Lauren’s mission, with the aid of the venerable minister, Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a present, six millions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to send a fleet of not less than thirty sail of the line, at her own expence, as an aid to America. Col. Laurens and myself returned from Brest the 1st of June following, taking with us two millions and an half of livres (upwards of one hundred thousand pounds sterling) of the money given, and convoying two ships with stores.  
We arrived at Boston the 25th August following. De Grasse arrived with the French fleet in the Chesapeak at the same time, and was afterwards joined by that of Barras, making 31 sail of the line. The money was transported in waggons from Boston to the Bank at Philadelphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has since put himself at the head of the list of petitioners in favour of the British treaty, was then President, and it was by the aid of this money, and of this fleet, and of Rochambeau’s army, that Cornwallis was taken; the lawrels of which have been unjustly given to Mr. Washington. His merit in that affair was no more than that of any other American officer.  
I have had, and still have, as much pride in the American revolution as any man, or as Mr. Washington has a right to have; but that pride has never made me forgetful from whence the great aid came that compleated the business. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the commencement of the revolution. It is one of the subjects treated of in the pamphlet Common Sense, but as a matter that could not be hoped for, unless Independence was declared.  
  
It is as well the ingratitude as the pusillanimity of Mr. Washington and the Washington faction, that has brought upon America the loss of character she now suffers in the world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone, and to which it is yet exposed. The British ministry soon found out what sort of men they had to deal with, and they dealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was wanting, it has been fully given since in the snivelling address of the New-York Chamber of Commerce to the President, and in that of sundry merchants of Philadelphia, which was not much better.  
When the revolution of America was finally established by the termination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character; and she had nothing to do but to stand firm upon that ground. The British ministry had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked unnecessarily a rupture with her, had she shewn a proper resolution to defend her rights. But encouraged as they were by the submissive character of her executive administration, they proceeded from insult to insult till none more were left to be offered. The proposals made by Sweden and Denmark to the American administration were disregarded. I know not if so much as an answer has been returned to them. The minister penitentiary (as some of the British prints called him) Mr. Jay, was sent on a pilgrimage to London, to make all up by penance and petition. In the mean time the lengthy and drowsy writer of the pieces signed Camillus held himself in reserve to vindicate every thing; and to sound, in America, the tocsin of terror upon the inexhaustible resources of England. Her resources, says he, are greater than those of all the other powers. This man is so intoxicated with fear and finance that he knows not the difference between plus and minus—between an hundred pounds in hand, and an hundred pounds worse than nothing.  
The commerce of America, so far as it had been established by all the treaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the principles upon which it was established were good. That ground ought never to have been departed from. It was the justifiable ground of right, and no temporary difficulties ought to have induced an abandonment of it. The case now is otherwise. The ground, the scene, the pretensions, the every thing, are changed. The commerce of America is, by Jay’s treaty, put under foreign dominion. The sea is not free for her. Her right to navigate it is reduced to the right of escaping; that is, until some  
  
ship of England or France, stops her vessels and carries them into port. Every article of American produce, whether from the sea or the land, fish, flesh, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay’s treaty, made either contraband or seizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other treaties of commerce the article which enumerates the contraband articles, such as fire arms, gun powder, &amp;c. is followed by another article which enumerates the articles not contraband: but it is not so in Jay’s treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is supplied by the article for seizing and carrying into port; and the sweeping phrase of “provisions and other articles,” includes every thing. There never was such a base and servile treaty of surrender since treaties began to exist.  
This is the ground upon which America now stands. All her rights of commerce and navigation have to commence anew, and that with loss of character to begin with. If there is sense enough left in the heart to call a blush into the cheek, the Washington administration must be ashamed to appear.———And as to you, sir, treacherous in private friendship (for so you have been to me, and that in the day of danger) and a hypocrite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide, whether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you ever had any?

Paris, Fuly zoth,. 1796,  
  
A Scenſure is but awkwardly ſoftened by apology,  
I ſhall offer you noapology for this letter. The  
eventful criſis to which your double politics have con-  
ducted the affairs of your country requires an inveſti-  
gation uncramped by ceremony. |  
  
There was a time whenthe fameof America, moral  
and political, ſtood fair and high in the world.. The  
luſtre of her revolution extended itſelf to every indi-  
vidual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to  
reſpect in Europe. Neither meanneſs nor ingratitude  
had then mingled itſelf into the compoſition of her  
character. Her reſiſtance to the attempted tyranny  
of England left her unſuſpected of the one, and her  
open acknowledgment of the aid ſhe received from

At the time I left America (April 1787) the conti-  
  
  
was on the point of meeting. Since that time new  
ſchemes of politics and new diſtinctions of parties, have  
ariſen. The term Antifederaliſt has been applied to all  
thoſe who combated the defects of that conſtitution,  
or. oppoſed the meaſures of your adminiſtration, It  
was only to the abſoluteneceſſity of eſtabliſhing ſome

a worſe rather than have had none; provided it con-  
tained the means of remedying its defects by the ſame  
  
  
It is always better policy to leave removeable errors tq  
expoſe themſelves, than to hazard too much in con-  
tending againſt them theoretically. r=  
  
I have introduced thoſe obſervations, not only to  
  
  
and anti- conſtitutionaliſt, but to preclude the effect,  
and even the application, of the former of thoſe  
terms to myſelf. I declare myſelf oppoſed to ſeveral

if L live to return to America I will uſe all my ens

ſelf oppoſed to almoſt the whole of your adminiſtra-

even perfidious, as I ſhall ſhew in the. courſe of this  
letter. But as to the point of conſolidating the States  
into a federal government, it ſo happens, that the pro-  
poſition for that purpoſe came originally from myſelf.  
I propoſed it in a letter to Chancellor Livingſton in the  
ſpring of the year 1782, whilſt that gentleman was mi-  
piſter for foreign affairs. The five per cent. duty re-  
commended -by Congreſs had then fallen through,  
having been adopted by ſome of the States, altered by  
others, rejected by Rhode Ifland, and repealed by  
Virginia after it had been conſented to. The propo-  
ſal in the letter I allude to was to get over the whole  
diiſpculty at once, by annexing a continental legiſlative  
  
  
Union uniform, the caſe could only be, that either  
Congreſs, as it then ſtood, muſt framethe.law,and the  
States ſeverally adopt it without alteration, or, the  
States muſt elect a Continental Legiſlature for the

ing the barrel, however defectively executed, would

of union, her riſing proſperity z and it was with grief  
they ſaw that proſperity mixed, even in the bloſſom,  
withthe germ of corruption. Monopolies of every  
  
  
of its commencement. The lands obtained by the re-  
volution were laviſhed upon partizans; the intereſt of  
the diſbanded ſoldier was ſold to the ſpeculator; in-

3 |  
The cantinuance of my impriſonment, after a new  
miniſter had arrited immediately | from America;  
which was now more than two months, was a mat-  
ter ſo obriouſiy ſtrange, that I found the character C  
the American government ſpoken of in very an  
. .ified terms of reproach; not only by thoſe who! iti  
remained in priſon, but by —̃ñ —  
and. by perſons who. had accets to the priſon from  
without Under theſe circumſtances I wrote again  
to Mr. Monroe, and found occaſton, among o-  
ther things to ſay: « It will not add to the popula-  
rity ul Mr. Waſhington to have it believed in Ame-  
6 rica, eee 117 mr my  
Wo « impriſonment.”  
The caſe, fo far adit reſpected Mr. Make,  
  
een to get over the difficulties which the  
ſtrange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had thrownin  
the way of a ſueceſſor, and having no authority from  
the American government to ſpeak officially upon  
any thüng relating to me, he found himfelf obliged  
lo proceed by unofficial means with individual mem-  
| bers; for though Robeſpierre was overthrown, the  
  
? Robeſpierrian members of the Committee of Public  
Bafety ſtill remained in conſiderable force, and had  
- they found but that Mr. Monroe had no official au-  
mority upon the caſe, they would have paid Iittle or  
no regard io hie reclamation of me. In tho mean  
time my health was ſuffering excecdingly, the ny  
  
  
proſpect of winter was coming 2 —  
ment was ſtill a thing of danger.  
  
After the Robeſpierrian members ofthe Committee  
were removed by the expiration of their time of  
ſerving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was libe-  
rated the th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in  
Paris the beginning of Auguſt before. All that pe-  
riod of my impriſonment, at leaſt, I owe not to Ro-  
beſpierre, but to his colleague in projects, George  
Waſhington. Immediately upon my liberation Mr-  
Monroe invited me to his houſe, where I remained  
more than a year and an half ; and I ſpeak of his aid  
and his friendſhip, . as an open hearted man will al-  
ways do in ſuch a caſe, with reſpe&amp; and gratitude:  
| Soon after my liberation the Convention paſſed  
an-unanimous vote to invite me to return to my ſeat  
among them. The times were ſtill unſettled and  
dangerous, as well from without as from within, for  
the coalition was unbroken, and the, conſtitution  
not. ſettled. I choſe, however, to accept the invi-  
tation; for as I undertake nothing but what I he-  
lieve to be right, I abandon nothing that I under-  
take; and I was willing alſo to ſhew, that, as I was  
not of a caſt of mind to be deterred by graſpedts, or  
retro-proſpects of danger, ſo neither were my prin-  
ciples to be weakened by n. or perverted  
by diſguſt. 5  
  
Y  
  
—  
  
  
Being now once more abroad in the world I be-  
gan to find that I was not the only one who had  
_ conceived an unfavourable opinion of Mr. Waſh-  
ington. It was evident that his character was on  
the decline as well among Americans as among fo-  
reigners of different nations. From being the chicf  
of a government, he had made himſelf the chief of  
a party; and his integrity was queſtioned, for his  
politics had a doubtful appearance. The miſſion of  
Mr. Jay to London, notwithſtanding there was an  
American miniſter there already, had then taken  
place, and was- beginning to be talked of. It ap-  
peared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped  
in myſtery, which every day ſerved either to en-  
creaſe or to explain into matter of ſuſpicion.  
  
In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Waſh--  
ington as Preſident had ſent Gouverneur Morris to  
London as his ſecret agent to have ſome communi-  
cation with the Britiſh miniſtry. To cover the a-  
geney of Morris it was given out, I know not by  
whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Mor-  
rigto borrow money in Europe, and the report was  
permitted to paſs uncontradicted. The event of Mor-  
ris&#x27;s negociation was, that Mr. Hammond was ſent  
miniſter from England to America, and Pinckney  
from America to England, and himſelf miniſter to  
France. If while Morris was miniſter in France he  
was not an emiſſary of the Britiſh miniſtry and the  
  
*  
  
£2014  
  
coaleſced powers, he gave ſtrong reaſons to ſuſpect  
him of it. No one who ſaw his conduct, and heard  
his converſation, could doubt his being in their in-  
tereſt ; and had he not got off at the time he did,  
after his recall, he would have been in arreſtation.  
Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of the  
Committee of Public en and enquiry was mak-  
ing after him.  
  
A great buſtle has been made by Mr. Waſhing-  
ton about the conduct of Genet in America; while  
that of his own miniſter, Morris, in France was in-  
knitely more reproachable. If Genet was impru-  
dent or raſh, he was not treacherous; but Morris  
was all three. He was the enemy of the French re-  
volution in every ſtage of it. - But, notwithſtanding  
this conduct on the part of Morris, and the known  
_ profiligacy of his character, Mr, Waſhington, in a let-  
ter he wrote to him at the time of recalling himon the  
complaint and requeſt of the Committee of Public  
Jafety, aſſures him, that though he had complied  
with that requeſt, he ſtill retained the ſame eſteem  
and friendſhip for him as before. This letter Mor-  
ris was fooliſh enough to tell of ; and, as his own  
character and conduct were notorious, the telling of  
it could have but one effect, which was that of im-  
© plicating the character of the writer, Morris till  
&#x27; loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr.  
  
Waſhington is ſtill jn correſpondence with him ;  
D-2  
  
  
Mr. Waſhington ought therefore to expect, eſpeci-  
ally fince his conduct in the affair of Jay&#x27;s treaty,  
that France muſt conſider Morris and Waſhington  
as men of the ſame deſcription, The chief differ-  
ence, however, between the two is (for in politics  
there is none} that the one is profligate enough to  
profeſs an indifference about moral principles, and  
the other is prudent enough to conceal che want of  
them, Fr! 20 * 45  
About three months after I was at liberty, the  
official note of Jay to Grenville on the ſubject of  
the capture of American veſſels by Britiſh cruiſers  
appeared in the American papers that arrived at  
Paris. Every thing was of a- piece. Every ching  
was mean. The fame kind of character went to  
all circumſtances public or private. Diſguſted at  
chis national degradation, as well as at the particu-  
lar conduct of Mr. Waſhington to me, I &quot;wrote to  
him (Mr. Waſhington) on the 22d of February  
(1795) under cover to the then Secretary of State  
(Mr. Randolph) and entruſted the letter to Mr.  
Letombe, ho was appointed French conſul to Phi-  
ladelphia, and was on the point of taking his de-  
parture. When I ſuppoſed Mr. Letombe had failed,  
J mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as I was  
then in his houſe, I ſhewed it to him. He expreſſed  
a wiſh that T would recall it, which he ſuppoſed  
might be done, as he had learned that Mr. Letombe  
  
A  
  
3  
had not then failed. I agreed to do ſo, and it was  
ee e ee m cn enger  
10e. .  
  
The 1a an will now reach Mr. Waſh-  
ington publicly in the courſe of this work.  
About the month of September following, I had  
a ſevere relapſe, which gave occaſion to the report  
of my death. I had felt it coming on a conſiderable  
time before, which occaſioned me to haſten the  
work 1 had then on hand, the Seand part of the  
Age of Reaſon. When I had finiſhed that work, I  
beſtowed another letter on Mr. Waſhington, which  
I ſent under cover to Mr. Benj. Franklin Bache of  
Philadelphia. The letter is a8 s follows.

That this letter was not written in very good tem  
per is very evident; but it was juſt ſuch a letter as  
his conduct appeared to me to merit, and every  
thing on his part fince has ſerved to confirm that  
opinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his filence

I am not refuting or contradicting the falſhood of  
this publication, for it is ſufficiently notorious  
neither am I cenſuring the writer ; on the contrary  
I thank him for the explanation he has incautiouſly  
given of the principles of the Waſhington faction.  
Infignificant, however, as the piece is, it was capa-  
ble of having had ſome ill effect, had it arrived in  
France during my impriſonment and in the time of  
Robeſpierre; and I am not uncharitable in ſuppoſing  
that this was the intention of the writer.“  
  
I have now done with Mr. Waſhington on the  
ſcore of private affairs. It would have been far  
more agreeable to me, had his conduct been ſuch 48  
not to have merited theſe reproaches. Errors or  
caprices of the temper can be pardoned and forgot-  
ten ; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart, ſuch  
as Mr. Waſhington is capable of acting, is not to  
be waſhed away. I now proceed to other matter.  
  
After Jay&#x27;s note to Grenville arrived in Paris from  
America, the character of every thing that was to  
follow might be eafily foreſeen; and it was upon  
this anticipation that my letter of February 22d was  
founded. The event has proved, that I was not  
miſtaken, except that i it has been much worſe than  
  
I expected.

(„  
It would naturally occur to Mr. Waſhington, that  
  
the ſecrecy of Jay&#x27;s miſſion to England, where there  
was Aready an, American miniſter, could not but  
  
  
eſpecially as the conduct of Morris had been noto-  
rious, and the intimacy of Mr. Waſhington with.  
Morris was known:  
  
The character which Mr. Waſhington 10 at-  
tempted to act in the world, is a ſort of non-deſcriba-  
ble, cameleon- coloured thing, called prudence. It is,  
in many. caſes, a ſubſtitute for principle, and is ſo  
  
  
in this inſtance with an expedient, that ſerved,  
as is the natural and general character of all expe-  
dients, .to- dimmiſh the embarraſſments · of the  
moment and multiply them afterwards; for he  
authoriſed it to be made known to the French go-  
vernment, as a confidential matter (Mr. Waſhington  
ſhould: recollect that I was a member of the Conven-  
tion, &amp; had the means of knowing what I here ſtate)  
he authorized it, I ſay, to be made known; and that  
  
  
on the ſcore of Mr. Jay&#x27;s miſſion to England, that the  
object ot that miſſion, and of Mr. Jay&#x27;s authority,  
was reſtricted to that of demanding the ſurrender of  
the weſtern poſts and indemnification for the cargoes  
captured in American veſſels. Mr. Waſhington knows  
  
„  
  
that this was untruc 3 and knowing this, he had good  
reaſon o himſelf for refuſing to furniſh the Houſe  
of rer with copies of tlie inſtructions  
given to Jay; as he might ſuſpect, among other  
things, that he ſhould alſo be called upon for copies  
of inſtructions given to other miniſters, and that in  
the contradiction of inſtructions his want of integrity  
would be detected. Mr. Waſhington may now, per-  
haps, learn, when it is too late, to be of any uſe to  
him, that a man will paſs better through the world  
with a thouſand open errors upon his back, than in  
being detected in ONE fly falſhood. When one is  
detected, a thouſand are ſuſpected. |  
he firſt account that arrived in Paris of a treaty  
  
being negociated by Mr. Jay (for nobody ſuſpected  
any) came in an Engliſh newſpaper, which announ-  
ced that a treaty offenſive and defenſeve had been con-  
cluded between the United States of America and  
England. This was immediately denied by every  
American i in Paris, as an impoſhble thing; and though  
it was diſbelieved by the French, it imprinted a ſuſ-  
picion that ſome underhand buſineſs was going for-  
ward.* At length the treaty itſelf arrived, and every  
Vell affected American bluſhed with ſhame.

It is curious to obſerve how the appearances of

EE Bay,  
  
ſhips, Mr. Waſhington would have cut but a poor  
figure in the American war. But of his military ta-  
lents I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.  
  
I mean not to enter into any diſcuſſion of any ar-  
ticle of Jay&#x27;s treaty : I ſhall ſpeak only upon the whole  
of it. It is attempted to be juſtified on the ground  
of its not being a violation of any- article or articles  
of the treaty pre-exiſting with France. But the ſo-  
yereign right of explanation does not lie with George  
Waſhington and his man Timothy ; France, on her  
part, has, at leaſt, an equal right; and when nations  
diſpute, it is not ſo much about wards as about things.  
A man, ſuch as the world calls, a ſharper, and  
yerſed, as Jay muſt be ſuppoſed to be, in the quibbles  
of the law, may find a way. to enter into engage-  
ments, and make bargains in ſuch a manner as to  
cheat ſome, other party, without that party being  
able, as the phraſe is, to take the law of him. This  
often happensin the cabaliſticalcircle of what is called  
law. But when this is attempted to be acted on  
the national ſcale of treaties, it is too deſpicable-to  
be defended, or to be permitted to exiſt. Yet this  
is the trick upon which Jay&#x27;s treaty is founded, ſo  
far as it has relation to the treaty, pre-exiſting with  
France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and  
perverts all the great articles of that treaty to the  
injury of France, and makes them operate as, a  
bounty to England rl France is at war.

The Waſhington adminiſtration ſhews great de-  
fire, that the treaty between France and the United  
States be preferved. Nobody can doubt their fince-  
rity upon this matter. There is not a Britiſh miniſ-  
ter, a Britiſh merchant; or a Britiſh agent or ſailor in  
America, that does not anxiouſly wiſh&#x27;the ſame thing.  
The treaty with France ferves now as a paſſport to  
ſupply England with naval ſtores and other articles  
of American produce, whilſt the ſame articles, when  
coming to France, are made contraband or ſeizable  
by Jay&#x27;s treaty with England. The treaty with  
  
  
perty, and thereby gives protection to Engliſh pro-  
  
  
talk of faith, of national honour, and of tlie preſerva-  
  
  
as this ſtares the world in the face.  
  
The Waſhington adminiſtration may ſave Itſelf  
the trouble of proving to the French government its  
moſt faithful intentions of preſerving the treaty with  
  
  
be preſerved.” She had nominated an Envoy extra-

4 treacherous friend. This, fir, together with the  
internal diſtractions cauſed in America, and the  
loſs of character in the world, is the eventful crit,  
alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to which  
your double politics have brought the affairs of your  
country. ane e of America be

friendly, part of the community, become involved  
with the culpable and the unfriendly; and as the  
accounts that arrived from America continued to  
manifeſt an invariable attachment in the general  
maſs of the people to their original ally, in oppoſition  
to the new · fangled Waſhington faction, the reſo-  
Jutions that had been taken were ſuſpended. It  
happened alſo fortunately enough, that Gouverneur  
Morris was not miniſter at this time. 158  
  
There is, however, one point that yet remains in  
embryo, and which, among other things, ſerves to  
ſhew the ignorance of the Waſhington treaty-mak-  
ers, and their inattention to pre-exiſting treaties

As the letter was addreſſed to the Committee of

any other ear than that of the Committee ; that it  
would paſs as a whiſper acroſs the Atlantic, from

of two years on the caſe of neutral ſdips making neu-  
tral property.. In the mean time neutral ſhips do net  
make neutral property, according to the Britiſh  
treaty, and they do, according to the French treaty.  
The preſervation, therefore, -of the French treaty  
hecame of great importance to England, as by that  
means ſhe can employ American ſhips as carriers,  
whilſt the ſame advantage is denied to France.  
Whether the French treaty could exiſt as a matter  
of right after this clandeſtine perverſion of it, could  
not but give ſome apprehenſions to the partizans of

have been prudent in Mr. Waſhington not to have

Nothing was done in tht catnpaigns&#x27; of 1778,  
1779, 1780, in the part where Gen. Waſhington  
- commanded, except the taking Stony Point by  
Gen. Wayne. The Southern States in the mean  
time were over-run by the enemy. They were af-  
terwards recovered by Gen. Greene, who had in a  
very great meaſure created the army that accom-  
pliſhed that recovery. In all this Gen. Waſting-  
ton had no ſhare. The Fabian ſyſtem of war, fol-  
lowed by him, began now to unfold itſelf with all  
its evils, for what is Fabian war without Fabian

emiſſions of paper money, were exhauſted. Its  
credit was gone. The continental treaſury was  
not able to pay the expence of a brigade of waggons  
to tranſport the neceſſary ſtores to the army, and  
yet the ſole object, the eſtabliſhment of the revolu-

We failed from Boſton in the Alliance frigate,

in accepting and paying bills drawn by Congreſs.  
She was now called upon to do more. The event  
of Col. Laurens&#x27;s miſſion, with the aid of the ve-  
nerable miniſter, Franklin, was, that : France gave  
in money, as a preſent, fix millions of livres, and  
ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to ſend a

that of any other American officer.

American revolution as any man, or as Mr. Waſh.

never made me forgetful from whence the great aid  
came that compleated the buſineſs. Foreign aid  
(that of France) was calculatcd upon at the com-  
mencement of the revolution. It is one of the ſub-  
jects treated of in the pamphlet Common Senſe, but

as a matter that could not * hoped for, unleſs In=  
dependence was declared.  
  
It is as well the ingratitude as the pufillanimity  
of Mr. Waſhington and the Waſhington faction,  
that has brought upon America the loſs of character  
ſhe now ſuffers - in the world, and the numerous  
evils her commerce has undergone, and to which it  
is yet expoſed. The Britiſh miniſtry ſoon found  
out what ſort of men they had to deal with, and  
they dealt with them accordingly z and if further  
explanation was wanting, it has been fully given  
ſince in the ſnivelling addreſs of the New-York  
Chamber of Commerce to the Preſident, and in  
that of ſundry merchants of Fee which  
was not much better. |  
  
When r of America was finally eſ-  
tabliſhed by the termination of the war, the world  
gave her credit for great character; and ſhe had  
nothing to do but to ſtand firm upon that ground,  
The Britiſh miniſtry had their ghands too full of  
trouble to have provoked unneceffarily a rupture  
with her, had ſhe ſhewn a proper reſolution to de-  
fend her rights. But encouraged as they were by  
the ſubmiſſive character of her executive adminiſ-  
tration, they proceeded from inſult to inſult till  
none more were left to be offered. The propoſals  
made by Sweden and Denmark to the American  
  
  
  
zdminiftration were diſregarded. I know not if fo  
much as an anſwer has been returned to them.  
The miniſter pexitentiary (as ſome of the Britiſh  
  
prints called him) Mr. Jay, was ſent on A pilgri-  
  
  
petition. - In the mean time the lengthy and drow-  
fy writer of the pieces ſigned Camillus held himſelf  
in reſerye to vindicate every thing ; ; and to ſound, in  
America, the tocſin of terror upon the inexhauſtible  
reſources of England, Her reſources, fays he, are  
greater than thoſe of all the other powers. This  
man is ſo intoxicated with fear and finance that he  
knows-not the difference between plus and minus—  
between an hundred pounds in handy and an hun-  
dred pounds worſe than nothing.  
  
The commerce aa ſo far as it had been  
eftabliſhed by all the treaties that had been formed  
prior to that by Jay, was free, and the principles  
upon which it was eſtabliſhed were good. That  
ground ought never to have been departed from.  
It was the juſtifiable, ground of right, and no tem-  
porary difficulties ought to have induced an aban-  
donment of it. The caſe now is otherwiſe. The  
ground, the ſcene, the pretenſions, the every thing,  
  
  
Jay&#x27;s treaty, put under foreign dominion. The fea  
is not free for her. Her right to navigate it is re-  
  
Py 1 1 —T 7  
  
  
duced to the right of eſcaping; that is, until ſome  
ſhip of England or France, ſtops her veſſels and  
carries them into port. Every article of American  
  
  
fleſh, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay&#x27;s trea-  
ty, made either contraband or ſeizable. Nothing is  
exempt. In all other treaties of commerce the ar-  
ticle which enumerates the contraband articles, ſuch  
as fire arms, gun powder, &amp;c. is followed by ano-  
ther article which enumerates the articles not con-  
traband : but it is not ſo in Jay&#x27;s treaty. There is  
no exempting article. Its place is ſupplied by the  
article for ſeizing and carrying into port; and the  
fweeping phraſe of « proviſions and other articles,”  
includes every thing. There never was ſuch a baſe  
and ſervile treaty of furrender fince treaties began  
to exiſt.  
  
This is the ground upon which America now  
  
  
have to commence anew, and that with lofs of  
character to begin with. If there is ſenſe enough  
  
  
Waſhington adminiſtration muſt be aſhamed to ap-

5 verneur Morris and myſelf had a meeting at the houſe  
vk Robert Morris on the ſubject of chat letter. There 8  
was no diverſity of opinion on the propoſition for **  
Continental Legiſlature. The only difficulty was on  
the manner of bringing the propoſition forward. For YL:  
my own part, as I conſidered it as a remedy i in reſerve.  
that could be applied at any time, when the States ſaw *  
themſelves wrong enough to be put right (which did not  
appear to me to be the caſe at that time) I did not ſee _  
the propriety of urging it precipitately, and declined _ 3  
being the publiſher of it myſelf. After this acecunßt  
of a fact, the leaders of your party will ſcarcely hare  
85 the hardineſs to apply to me the term of antifederaliſt.  
3 a But Ican go to a date and to a fact beyond this; for the  
3 propoſition for electing a Continental Convention to |  
+ form the Continental Government is one of the fub-  
1 Jects treated of in the pamphlet Common Se,,  
ä cleared away a little of the rubbiſh that  
might otherwiſe have lain in my way, I return to the  
| point of time at which the preſent Federal Conſtitu-  
tion and your adminiſtration began. It was very well  
ſaid by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a  
| year before that period, that « zhirteen faves and ne en:  
a hoop will not make a barrel,” and as any kind of hoop-  
ing the barrel, however defectively executed, would  
be better than none, it was ſcarcely poſlible but that  
conſiderable advantages muſt ariſe from the federal 5

ancere friend to America beheld, as the State effect  
of union, her riſing proſperity ; and it was with grief  
they ſaw that proſperity mixed, even in the bloſſom,  
with che germ of corruption. Monopolies of every  
kind marked your adminiſtrationalmoſt in the moment  
of its commencement. The lands obtained by the re-  
volution were laviſhed upon partizans; the intereſt of  
the diſbanded ſoldier was ſold to the ſpeculator; in-  
Juſtice was ated under the pretence of faith; and the  
chief of the army became the patron of the fraud.  
From ſuch a beginning what could be expected, but  
what has happened? A mean and ſervile ſubmiſſion

her revolution extended itfelf to every individual, and to be  
a citizen of America, gave a title to reſpect in Europe.  
Neither meanneſs nor ingratitude had then mingled in the

point of meeting. Since that time new ſchemes of politics,  
and new diſtinctions of parties have ariſen. The term Antifede-

of that couſtitution, or _— the meaſures of your adminj.

ſtration.  
ſome feder . extending equally over all the States,  
that-an inſtrument ſo inconſiſtent as the preſent federal con-  
ſtiturion is, obtained a ſuffrage. I would have voted for it  
myſelf, had I been in America, or even for a worſe, rather  
than have had none; provided it contained the means of reme.  
+ &amp;yivg its defe&amp;s by the fam appeal to the ple, by which  
it vas to be eſtabliſhed. It is always better policy to leave  
removable errors to expoſe themſelves; than to hazard too  
  
much in contending againſt them theoretically.  
  
I have introduced theſe obſervations not only to mark the  
general difference between Antifederaliſt and Anticonſtitu-  
tionaliſt, but to preclude the effect, and even the application,  
of the former of theſe terms to myſelf. I declare myſelf  
1 oppoſed to ſeveral matters in the conſtitution, particularly to  
the manner in which what is called the executive is. formed,  
and to the long duration of the ſenate ; and if I live to return  
to America, I will-uſe all my endeavours to have them  
altered. I alſo declare myſelf oppoſed to almoſt the whole of  
your adminiſtration ; for I know it to have been deceitful, if  
not perfidious, as I ſhall ſhow in the courſe of this letter. But  
  
  
ment, it ſo happens, that the propoſition. for that purpoſe  
  
came originally from myſelf. I propoſed it in a letter to  
  
chancellor Livingſton in the ſpring of the year 1782, whillt  
  
* that gentleman was miniſter for foreign affairs. The five  
per cent, duty recommended by congreſs had then fallen,  
  
through having been adopted by ſome of the States, altered  
  
by others, rejected by Rhode Iſland, and repealed by Vir-  
  
.ginia, after it had been conſented to. The propoſal in the  
letter I allude to, was to get over the whole difficulty at once,  
by annexing a continental legiſlative body to Congreſs ; forin  
  
order to have any law of the Union uniform, the caſe could  
  
Ga only  
  
2  
  
otly be, chat either Congreſs, as it then ſtood, muſt frame  
  
the  
or, the States muſt elect a continental legiſlature for that  
  
purpoſe. Chancellor Livingſton, Robert Morris, Governor  
  
  
Morris on the ſubject of that letter. There was no diverſity  
of opinion on the propoſition for a continental legiſlature ; the  
only difficulty was on the manner of bringing the propoſition  
forward. For my own part, as I conſidered it as a remedy  
in reſerve, that could be applied at any time, when the States  
ſaw themſelves wrong enough to be put right (which did not  
appear to be the caſe at that time), I did not ſee the propriety  
of urging it precipitately, and declined being the publiſher of  
it myſelf. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your  
party will ſcarcely have the hardineſs to apply to me the  
term of Antifederaliſt. But I can go to a date and to a fact  
beyond this, for the propoſition for electing a continental  
convention. To form the continental government is one of  
the ſubjects treated of in the pamphlet Common Senſe.  
  
  
otherwiſe have lain in my way, I return to the point of time  
  
  
in Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that * thir-  
teen ſlaves and ne er a hoop will not make a barrel;” and as  
any kind of hooping the barrel, however defectively executed,  
  
  
conſiderable advantages muſt ariſe from the federal hooping  
of the States. It was with pleaſure that every ſincere friend  
to America beheld, as the natural effect of union, her riſing  
proſperity ; and it was with grief they ſaw that proſperity  
mixed, even in the bloſſom, with the germ of corruption,

s cenſure is but ed ſoftened by apology, I ſhall  
  
offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful  
criſis, to which your double politics have conducted the  
affairs of your country, requires an inveſtigation en  
by ceremony.  
  
There was a time when the tune of Americe, moral and  
political, ſtood fair and high in the world, The luftre of  
her revolution extended itſelf to every individual, and to be  
a citizen of America, gave a title to reſpe&amp;t in Europe.  
Neither meanneſs nor ingratitude had then mingled in the  
compoſition of her character. Her reſiſtance to the attempted  
tyranny of England left her unſuſpected of the one, and her  
open acknowledgment of the aid ſhe received from France  
precluded all ſuſpicion of the other. The politics of  
Waſhington had not then appeared. |  
  
At the time I left America (April 1787) the continental  
Convention, that formed the federal conſtitution, was on the

ſome federal authority, extending equally over all the States,  
that an inſtrument ſo inconſiſtent as the preſent federal con-  
ſtitution is, obtained a ſuffrage. I would have voted for it

it was to be eſtabliſhed. It is always better policy to leave

by the revolution were laviſhed upon partizans; the intereſt up  
of the diſbanded ſoldier was ſold to the ſpeculator; injuſtice a  
was acted under the pretence of faith; and the chief of the  
army became the patron of the fraud. From ſuch a beginning  
what elſe could be expected, than what has happened? A

treachery and ingratitude ta another.  
Some vices make their approach with ſuch a ſplendid ap-

As the federal conſtitution is a copy, though not quite ſo  
baſe as the original, of the form of the Britiſh government,  
an imitation of its vices was naturally to be expected. So  
intimate is the connection between form and practice, that to  
adopt the one, is to. invite the other. Imitation is naturally  
progreſſive, and is rapidly ſo in matters that are vicious.  
  
Soon after the federal conſtitution arrived in England, l  
received a letter from a female literary correſpondent (a na-  
tive of New York) very well mixed with friendſhip, ſenti-

and having no authority from the American government to  
ſpeak officially upon any thing relating to me, he found him-  
ſelf obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual  
members; for though Robeſpierre was overthrown, the Ro-  
beſpierrian members of the Committee of Public Safety ſtill  
remained in conſiderable force, and had they found out that  
Mr. Monroe had no official authority upon the caſe, they  
would have pald little or no regard to his reclamation of me.  
In the mean time my health was ſuffering exceedingly, the  
dreary proſpect of winter was coming on, and impriſonment  
was ſtill a thing of danger. After the Robeſpierrian members  
of the committee were removed by the expiration of their  
time of ſerving, Mr: Monroe reclaimed me, and I was libe-  
rated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris  
the beginning of Auguſt before. All that period of my im-  
priſonment, at leaſt, I owe not to Robeſpierre, but to his col-  
  
  
my liberation Mr. Monroe invited me to his houſe, where L  
remained more than a year and half; and I ſpeak of his aid  
and his friendſhip, as an open-hearted man will always do in  
ſuch a caſe, with reſpe&amp; and gratitude,  
  
Soon after my liberation the Convention paſſed an unani-  
mous vote to invite me to return to my ſeat among them.  
The times were till unſettled and dangerous, as well from  
without as within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the  
conſtitution not ſettled. - I choſe, however, to accept the in- ,  
vitation; for as I undertake nothing but what I believe to be  
right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I was willing  
alſo to ſhow, that, as I was. not of a caſt of mind to be de-  
terred by proſpects or retroſpects of danger, ſo neither were  
my principles to be ene by misfortune or perverted by  
diſguſt.  
  
Feing now once more abroad 3 in the world, 1 began to find  
D that  
  
.  
  
that I was not the only one who had conceived an unfavour-  
able opinion. of Mr. Waſhington ; it was evident that his  
character was on the decline as well among Americans, as  
among foreigners of different nations. From being the chief  
of the government, he had made himſelf the chief of a party;  
and his integrity was queſtioned, for his politics had a doubt-  
ful appearance. The: miſſion of Mr. Jay to London, not-  
withſtanding there was an American miniſter there already,  
had then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It  
appeared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in myſ-  
tery, which every day ſerved either to increaſe or to. explain  
into matter of ſuſpicior. |  
  
In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Wathimgton, as  
preſident, had ſent governor Morris to London, as his ſecret  
agent, to have ſome communication with the Britiſh miniſtry.  
To cover the agency of Morris it was given out, I know not  
by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Morris, to  
borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted to  
paſs uncontradicted. The event of Morris&#x27;s negociation  
was, that Mr. Hammond was ſent miniſter from England to  
America, Pinkney from America to England, and himſelf  
. miniſter-to France. If while Morris was miniſter in France  
he was not an emiſſary of the Britiſh miniſtry, and the co-  
aleſced powers, he gave ſtrong reaſon to ſuſpe&amp; him of it.  
No one who ſaw his conduct, and heard his converſation,  
could doubt his being in their intereſt; and had he not got  
off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been  
in arreſtation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands  
of the Committee of Public Safety, and inquiry was making  
after him.  
A great buſtle has been made by Mr. Waſhington about  
the conduct of Genet in America, whilſt that of his own mi-  
  
  
190  
  
If Genet was imprudent or raſh, he was not treacherous; but  
Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French re-  
volution in every ſtage of it. But notwithſtanding this con-  
duct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his  
character, Mr, Waſhington in a letter he wrote to him at the  
time of recalling him, on the complaint and requeſt of the  
Committee of Public Safety, aſſures him, that though he had  
complied with that requeſt, he ſtill retained the ſame eſteem  
and friendſhip for him as before. This letter Morris was  
fooliſh enough to tell of; and, as his own character and con-  
duct were notorious, the telling of it could have but one  
effect, which was that of implicating the character of the  
writer. Morris ſtill loiters in Europe, chiefly in England;  
and Mr, Waſhington is ſtill in correſpondence with him. —  
Mr. Waſhington ought therefore to expect, eſpecially ſince  
his conduct in the affair of Jay&#x27;s treaty, that France muſt  
conſider Morris and Waſhington as men of the ſame deſcrip-  
tion. The chief difference, however, between the two is,  
(for in politics there is none) that the one is profligate enough  
to profeſs an indifference about moral principles, and the  
other is prudent enough to conceal the want of them.  
  
About three months after I was at liberty, the official note  
of Jay ro Grenville, on the ſubject of the capture of American  
veſſels by the Britiſh cruiſers, appeared in the American  
papers that arrived at Paris, Every thing was of a piece—  
every thing was mean. The fame kind of character went to  
all circumſtances public or private. Diſguſted at this national  
degradation, as well as at the particular conduct of Mr. Waſh-  
ington to me, 1 wrote to him (Mr. Waſhington) on the  
twenty-ſecond of February, 1795, under cover to the then  
ſecretary of ſtate (Mr. Randolph), and entruſted the let-  
ter to Mr, Letombe, who was appointed French conful  
to Philadelphia, and was on the point of taking his departure.

away. I now proceed to other matter.  
  
tio  
After Jay&#x27;s note to Grenville arrived in Paris from Ame- of  
rica, the character of every thing that was to follow might be W  
eaſily foreſeen ; and it was upon this anticipation that my let. of  
ter of February the twenty ſecond was founded. The event wo  
has proved that I was not miſtaken, except that it has been det  
much worſe than I expeted. far  
It would naturally occur to Mr. Waſhington that the ſe-  
creſy of Jay&#x27;s miſſion to England, where there was already an ne  
American miniſter, could not but create ſome ſuſpicion in the *  
French government, eſpecially as the conduct of Morris had *  
been notorious, and the i EEE of Mr, Waſhington with st  
Morris was known. nic  
The character, which Mr. Waſhington has attempted to th  
act in the world, is a fort of non-deſcribable, cameleon-co- pi  
loured thing, called Prudence. It is in many caſes a ſubſti- ler  
tute for principle, and is ſo nearly allied to hypocriſy, that it fie  
eaſily ſlides into it. His genius for prudence furniſhed him  
in this inſtance with an expedient that ſerved (as is the natural Wi  
and general character of all expedients) to diminiſh the embar- fa  
_raffments of the moment, and multiply them afterwards; for le  
he cauſed it to be announced to the French government as 2 fer  
confidential matter C Mr. Waſhington ſhould recolle&amp; that th  
was a member of the Convention, and had the means of br  
knowing what I here ftate); he cauſed it, I ſay, to be an- w  
nounced, and that for the Purpoſe of preventing any unealineſs re  
to France on the ſcore of Mr. Jay&#x27;s miſſion to England, that ar  
that the object of that miſſion, and Mr. Jay&#x27;s authority, were ly  
reſtricted to the demanding of the ſurrender of the weſtern or  
poſts, and indemnification for the cargoggygaptured in Ameri- P.

inſtructions given to Jay, as he might ſuſpect, among other  
things, that he ſhould alſo be called upon for copies of inſtruc-  
tions given to- other miniſters, and that in the contradiction  
of inſtructions his want of integrity would be detected. Mr.  
Waſhington may now, perhaps, learn, when it is too late to be  
of any uſe to him, that a man will paſs better through the  
world with a thouſand open errors upon his back, thap in being  
detected in one ly falſnood. When one is detected, a thou-  
fand are ſuſpected. N  
  
The firſt account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being  
negotiated by Mr. Jay (for nobody ſuſpected any), came in  
an Engliſh newſpaper, which announced, that a treaty offen-  
five and defenſive had been concluded between the United  
States of America and England. This was immediately de-  
nied by every American in Paris, as an impoſſible thing; and  
though it was difbelieved by the French, it imprinted a ſuſ-  
picion that ſome underhand buſineſs was going forward. At  
length the treaty itſelf arrived, and every well affected 2  
rican bluſhed with ſhame. .  
  
It is curious to obſerve how the appearances of characters  
will change, whilſt the root that produces them remains the  
lame. The Waſhington faction having waded through the  
lough of negotiation, and, whilſt it amuſed France wich pro-  
feſſions of friendſhip, contrived to injure her, immediately  
throws off the hypocrite, and aſſumes the ſwaggering air of a  
bravado. The party papers of that imbecile adminiſtration |  
were on this occaſion filled with paragraphs about ſove-  
reignty, , A poltroon may boaſt of his ſovereign right to let  
another kick him, and this is the only kind of ſovereignty  
ſhown in the treaty with England. But thoſe daſhing para-  
graphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for

tempted to be juſtified on the ground of its not being a vio- de

with George Waſhington and his man Timothy; France, on ſuc  
  
her part, has, at leaſt, an equal right; and when nations diſ- fac  
pute, it is not ſo much about words as about things.  
  
A. man, ſuch as the world calls.a ſharper, as verſed as Joy of

in the cabaliſtical circle of what is called law. But when this ne  
is attempted to be ated. on the national ſcale of treaties, it is off  
too deſpicable to be defended, or to be permitted to exil. Fr  
Vet this is the trick upon which Jay&#x27;s treaty is founded, ſo a  
far as it has relation to the treaty pre-exiſting with France. wit  
It is a counter-treaty to that treat, and perverts all the great che  
articles of that treaty to the injury of France, and makes them beg

The Waſhington adminiſtration ſhows great deſire, that the  
treaty between France and the United States, be preſerved.  
Nobody can doubt its ſincerity upon this matter. There 1s  
not a Britiſh miniſter, a Britiſn merchant, or a Britiſh agent  
or factor in America, that does not anxiouſly wiſh | the ſame  
thing. The treaty with France ſeryes now as a paſſport to  
ſupply England with naval ſtores, and other articles of Ame-  
ican produce; whilſt the ſame articles when coming to  
France are made contraband, or ſeizable, by Jay&#x27;s treaty  
with England. The treaty. with Erape ſays, that neut!

be ſeized by the Engliſh. It is too paltry to talk of faith,  
of national honour, and of the preſervation of treaties, while  
ſuch a barefaced treachery as this wk the world in the  
face.  
  
The Waſhington adrniniftration may fave itſelf the trouble  
of proving to the French government its moff faithful inten-  
tions of preſerving the treaty with France; for France has now  
no deſire that it ſhould be preſerved; ſhe had nominated an  
envoy extraordinary to America, to make Mr, Waſhington  
and his government a preſent ofthe treaty, and to have no  
more to do with that or with Bim. It was at the ſame time  
officially declared to the American miniſter at Paris, that the  
French republic had rather have the American government for  
an open enemy, than a treacherous friend. This, fir, together  
with the internal diſtractions cauſed in America, and the loſs of  
character in the world, is the eventful criſis &quot;alluded to in the  
beginning of this lettter, to which your double politics have

America was to be ſhown, and the folicitude . of in  
the letter demonſtrated? = _  
  
As the letter was addreſſed to ahh Committee of Public  
Safety, Mr. Waſhington did not expect it would get abroad  
in the world, or be ſeen by any other eye than that of Robeſ-  
pierre, or be heard by any other ear than that of the Com-  
mittee ; that it would paſs as a whiſper acroſs the Atlantic  
from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate.  
It was calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee  
all ſuſpicion upon Jay&#x27;s miſſion to England, and in this point  
of view it was ſuited to the circumſtances of the moment then  
paſſing; but as the event of that miſſion has proved the letter  
to be hypocritical, it ſerves no other purpoſe of the preſent  
moment than to ſhow, that the writer is not to be credited.  
Two circumſtances ſerved to make the reading of the letter  
neceſſary in the Convention; the one was, that they who ſuc-  
ceeded on the fall of Robeſpierre, found: it moſt proper to  
act with pnblicity ; the other, to extinguiſh the ſuſpicions  
which the nge conduct of Morris had occaſioned in  
France.  
  
When the Britiſh treaty and the ratification of it by Mr.  
Waſhington were known in France, all further declarations  
from him of his good diſpoſitions, as an ally and a friend,  
paſſed for ſo many cyphers ; but till it appeared neceſſary to  
him to keep up the farce of declarations. [t is ſtipulated in  
the Britiſh-treaty, that commiſſioners are to report at the end  
of two years on the caſe of neutral ſhips making neutral pro-  
perty. In the mean time ncutral ſhips do not make. neutral  
property according to the Britiſh treaty, and they do accord-  
ing to the French treaty. - The preſervation therefore of the  
French treaty became of great importance to England, as by  
that means ſhe can employ American ſhips as carriers, whilſt  
the ſame advantage is deniedt to France. Whether the French  
  
. | | treaty

in WM treaty could exiſt as a matter of right after this clandeſtine  
  
perverſion of it, could not but give ſome apprehenſions to the  
ic partizans of the Britiſh treaty, and it became neceſſary to them  
id to make up by fine words what was wanting in good actions.  
. An opportunity offered for that purpoſe. The Conven-  
— tion on the public reception of Mr. Monroe ordered the  
ic American flag and the French flag to be diſplayed unitedly in  
3 the hall of the Convention. Mr. Monroe made a preſent of”  
an American flag for the purpoſe. The Convention returned  
this compliment by ſending a French flag to America, to be  
preſented by their miniſter, Mr. Adet, to the American go-  
vernment. This reſolution paſſed long before Jay&#x27;s treaty  
was known or ſuſpected; it paſſed in the days of confidence;  
but the flag was not preſented by Mr. Adet till ſeveral  
months after the treaty had been ratified.” Mr. Waſhington _  
made this the occaſion of ſaying ſome fine things to the  
French miniſter, &#x27;and the better to get himſelf into tune-to do  
this, he began by ſaying the fineſt things of himſelf. Tee D

© ſee an oppreſſed people unfurl the banner of freedom.“ Mr.  
Waſhington having expended ſo many fine phraſes upon him-  
ſelf, was obliged to invent a new one for the French, and he  
calls them « Wonderful en % The coaleſced Kere  
acknowledge as much.  
  
It is laughable to hear Mr. Waſhington ak of his. Hnpa- |  
thelic feelings, who has always been remarked, even among  
his friends, for not having any. He has, however, given no  
proof of 19 to me. As to the per encomiums he ſo

liberally pays to himſelf on the ſcore of the American revolu-  
tion, the propriety of them may be queſtioned; and ſince he  
has forced them ſo much into notice, it is fair to examine his  
pretenſions. 8  
  
A ſtranger might be led to ſuppoſe, from the 3 wi  
  
which Mr. Waſbington ſpeaks, that himſelf, and himſelf only,  
had enerated, conducted, completed, and eſtabliſhed the  
revolution. In fine, that it was all his own doing.  
In the firſt place, as to the political part, he had no ſhare in  
it; and therefore the whole of that is out of the queſtion with  
reſpect to him, There remains then only the military part;  
and it would have been prudent in Mr. Waſhington not to  
have awakened inquiry upon that ſubject. Fame then was  
cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply ; and nobody was diſpoſed to take  
away the laurels, that, whether they were acquired or mots had  
been given.  
  
Mr. Waſhington&#x27;s merit « conſiſted . Bur c con-  
ſtancy was the common virtue of the revolution. Who was  
there that was inconſtant ? I know but of one military defec-  
  
tion, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection  
among thoſe who made themſelves eminent when the re-  
volution was formed by the declaration of independence.  
Even Silas Deane, Hough he attempted defraud, * not  
betray.  
  
But when we ſpeak of military a coating more  
is to be underſtood than conſtancy; and ſomething more  
&#x27; eught to be underſtood than the Fabian ſyſtem of doing not bing ·

The hope however of better times, the news of the alliance  
with France, and the unwillingneſs of ſhowing e _ |  
ſpared the matter.  
Nothing was done in the campaign of 1778, 1779, 1786,  
in the part where General Waſhington commanded, except  
the taking Stoney-Point by General Wayne. The fouthern  
  
  
were afterwards recovered by General Greene, who had ih  
a very great meaſure created the army that accompliſhed  
that recovery. In all this General Waſhington had no ſhare.  
The Fabian ſyſtem of war, followed by him, began now to  
unfold itſelf with all its evils; for what is Fabian war without  
Fabian means to ſupport it? The finances of Congreſs, de-  
pending wholly an emiſſions of paper-money, were exhauſted.  
Its credit was gone. The continental treaſury was not  
able to pay the expenſe of a brigade of waggons to tranſ-  
port the neceſſary ſtores to the army, and yet the ſole object,  
  
te eſtabliſhment of the revolution, was a thing of remote  
diſtance. The time | am now 1 IrY the muon]  
the year 1780,  
  
In this ſituation of things it was found not only expedient,  
but abſolutely neceſſary for Congreſs to ſtate the whole caſe  
to its ally. I know more of this matter (before it came into  
Congreſs, or was known to General Waſhington), of its pro-  
grefs, and irs iſfue, than I chooſe to ſtate in this letter. Colo-  
nel John Laurens was fent to France; as an envoy extraor-  
dinary on-this- otcafion, and by a private agreement between  
him and me, I accompanied him. We failed from Boſton  
in the Alliance frigate; February eleventh, 178 1. France had  
already done much in accepting and paying bills drawn by  
  
Congreſs; ſhe was now called upon to do more, Su event  
| G ol  
  
( 420  
  
of Colonel Laurens&#x27;s miſſion, with the aid of the venerable  
miniſter Franklin, was, that France gave in money as  
à preſent, ſix million of livres, and ten millions more as a  
Joan, and agreed to ſend a fleet of not leſs than thirty fail of  
the line at ber own expence as an aid to America. Colonel  
Laurens and myſelf returned from Breſt the firſt of June fol-  
lowing, taking with us two millions and a half of livres (upwards  
ol one hundred thouſand pounds ſterling) of the money given,  
and convoying two ſnips with ſtores.  
We arrived at Boſton the twenty - fiſth of Auguſt following;  
De Graſſe arriyed with the French fleet in the Cheſapeak at  
the ſame time, and was afterwards joined by that of Barras,  
making thirty- one ſail of the line. The money was tranſ-  
ported in waggons from Boſton to the bank. of Philadelphia,  
of which Mr. Thomas Willag, who has ſince. put himſelf a  
the head of the liſt of petitioners in favour of the Britiſh treaty,  
  
was then preſident. And it was by the aid of this money, of  
this fleet, and of Rochambeau&#x27;s army, that Cornwallis was  
taken ; the laurels of which have been unjuſtly given to Mr.  
  
Waſhington. His merit in that affair was no more than that  
= any other American officer. &quot;_  
  
I Lhaye had, and till have, as much de in ** Ametican  
  
838 as any man, or as Mr. Waſhington has a right to  
  
have; but that pride has never made me forgetful whence  
  
  
aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the commence-  
ment of the revolution. It is one of the ſubjects treated of  
in the pamphlet Common Senſe, but as a matter that could not  
be hoped for, unleſs, independence was declared. The aid  
however was greater than could have been expectecc.  
  
It is as well che ingratitude as the puſillanimity of. Mr.

and to which it is ſtill expoſed: The Britiſh miniſtry ſoon  
found out what fort of men they had to deal with, and they  
dealt with them accordingly ; and if further explanation was  
wanting, it has been fully giyen ſince, in the ſnivelling addreſs  
of the New York chamber of commerce to the preſident, and  
in that of ſundry merchants of bp nh moor was nos  
much better. |  
  
When the revolution of America was fnally Lablified by  
the termination of the war, &#x27;the world gaye her credit for  
great character; and ſhe had nothing to do but to ſtand firm  
upon that ground. The Britiſh miniſtry had their hands to  
full of trouble to have provoked a rupture with her, had-ſhe |  
ſhown a proper reſolution to defend her rights: but encou-  
raged as they were, by the ſubmiſſive character of the Ame-  
rican adminiſtration, they proceeded from inſult to inſult; till  
none more were left to be offered. The propoſals made by  
Sweden and Denmark to the American government were diſ-  
regarded. I know not if ſo much as an anſwer has been re-  
turned to them. The miniſter penitentiary, (as ſome of the  
Britiſh prints called him) Mr. Jay, was ſent on a pilgrimage  
to London, to make all up by penance and petition. In the  
mean time; the lengthy and drowſy writer of the pieces ſigned  
Camillus held himſelf in reſerve to vindicate every thing; and  
to ſound in America the tocſin of terror upon the inexhauſtible  
reſources of England. Her reſources, ſays he, are greater  
than thoſe of all the other powers. This man is fo intoxi-  
cated with fear and finance, that he knows not the difference  
between plus and minus between a hundred pounds in  
hand, and a hundred pounds worſe than nothing.  
  
The commerce of America, ſo far as it had been eftabliſh-  
ed, by. all: the treaties that had been formed prior to that by  
  
Jay, was free, and the principles upon which it was eſtabliſhed  
| G 2 were  
  
(4)  
  
were good. That ground ought never to have been departed  
from. It was the juſtifiable groundjof right ; and no tempo-  
rary difficulties ought to have induced an abandonment of ir.  
  
The cafe no is otherwiſe, .The ground, the ſcene, the pre-  
tenſions, the every thing is changed. The commerce of  
America is by Jay&#x27;s treaty put under foreing dominion, The  
ſea is not free for her. Her right to navigate is reduced to  
the right of eſcaping; that is, until ſome ſhip of England or  
France ſtops her veſſels, and carries them into port. Every  
article of American produce, whether from the ſea or the  
land, fiſh, fleſh, vegetable, or manufacture, is by Jay&#x27;s treaty  
made either contraband, or ſeizable. Nothing is &quot;exempt.  
In all other treaties of commerce the articles which enume-  
rates the - contraband article, ſuch as fire-arms, gunpowder,  
&amp;c. is followed by another which enumerates the articles not  
contraband : but it is not ſo 1 in Jay&#x27;s treaty. There is no ex-  
empting article. Its place ia ſupplied by the article for ſeizing  
and carrying into port; and the ſweeping phraſe of proviſions  
and other articles includes every thing. There never was  
ſuch a baſe and ſervile treaty of ſurrender, ſince treaties began  
do exiſt.  
  
This is the ground upon which America now ftands. Al  
her rights of commerce and navigation are to being anew,  
and that with loſs of character to begin with.—lf there is ſenſe  
enough left in the heart, to call a bluſh into the cheek, the  
Waſhington adminiſtration muſt be aſhamed to appear. —And  
as to you, fir, treacherous in private friendſhip (for ſo you  
have been to me, and that in the day of danger), and a hypo-  
crite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide, whe-  
ther you are an APOSTATE, or an IMPOSTOR? Whe-  
ther you have abandoned good principles, or whether you  
ever had * 4

corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your

were laviſhed upon partizans; the intereſt of the dif-

cal conduct. 1 |  
  
The part I acted in the American revolution is  
well known. [I ſhall not here repeat it. I know al-  
ſo, that, had it not been for the aid received from  
France, in men, money, and ſhips, your cold and un-  
military conduct (as I ſhall how in the courſe of this  
letter) would in all probability have loſt America;  
at leaſt ſhe would not have been the independent na-  
tion ſhe now is. You ſlept away your time in the  
field, till the finances of the country were completely  
exhauſted, and you have but little ſhare in the glory  
of the Gag) event. I1t is time, Sir, to 8887 the un-  
diſguiſed language of hiſtorical truth.  
  
Elevated to the chair of the prefidency, you defi 5  
ed the merit of every thing to yourſelf; and the na-  
tural ingratitude of your conſtitution began to appear.  
You commenced your preſident&#x27;s career by encourag-  
ing and ſwallowing the groſſeſt adulation; and you  
travelled America from one end to the other, to put  
yourſelf in the way of receiving it. You have as  
many addreſſes in your cheſt as James the Second  
As to what were your views, for if you are not great  
enough to have ambition, you are little eneugh to  
have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from  
expreſſions of your own ; but the PATTIE of your  
politics have divulged the ſecret.” ;  
  
John Adams has ſaid, (aud John it is Exod was  
always a ſpeller after places and offices, and never  
thought his little ſervices were highly enough 3

it was evident that his character was on the decline

and his integrity was queſtioned, for his politics had

The commerce of America, ſo. &quot;IN as it bad been Ae

that by Jay, was free, and the principles upon. which it-

have been departed from. It was the juſtifiable ground  
of right; and no temporary difficulties ought to have in-  
duced an abandonment of it. The cafe now is otherwiſe.  
The ground, the ſcene, the pretenfioas, the every thing  
is changed. The commerce of America ts by Jay&#x27;s treaty  
put under foreign dominion. The fea is not free for her.  
Her right to navigate is reduced to the right of eſcaping ;:  
that is, until ſome (hip of England or France ſtops ber  
veſſels, and carries them into port, Every article of A-  
merican produce, whether from the ſea or the land, fiſh,  
fleſh, vegetable, or manufacture, is by Jay&#x27;s treaty müde  
either contraband or ſeizable. Nothing is exempt. In  
all other treaties, of commerce the articles which enume-  
rates the contraband article, ſuch as fire arms, gun-pow-  
der, &amp;c. is followed by. another which enumerates the-  
  
  
There is no exempting article. Its place is ſupplied by  
the article for ſeizing and carrying into port; and the  
ſweeping phraſe of proviſions. and other a ie includes.  
every thing. There never was. ſuch. a baſe and lervile-  
treaty of ſurrender, fince treaties began to exiſt.  
  
IThis is the ground upon which America now fe  
All her rights of commerce and navigation are to begin,  
anew, and. that with-loſs of character to begin with.

As cenſure is but 1 ſoftened by apology, 1 malt |  
offer you no apology for this letter: The eventful criſis, to  
which your double politics have conducted the affairs of your  
country, requires an inveſtigation uncramped by ceremony.  
There was a time when the fame of America, moral and po-  
litical, ſtood fair and high in the world. The luſtre of her  
revolution extended itſelf to every individual, and to be a ci-  
tizen of America, gave a title to reſpect in Europe. Neither  
meanneſs nor ingratitude had then mingled in the compoſition  
of her character. Her reſiſtances to the attempted tyranny vf  
England left her unſuſpected of the one, and her open ac-  
knowledgment of the aid ſhe received from France precluded -  
all ſuſpicion of the other. Tbe politics of Waſhington had  
not then appeared. |  
At the time I left America (April I 4 5 the 3 |

too much in contending againſt them theoretically.  
  
  
to ſeveral matters in the conſtitution, particularly to the man-  
  
  
I will uſe all my endeavours to have them altered. J alſo de-  
clare myſelf oppoſed to almoſt the whole of your adminiſtra-  
  
  
as I thall ſhow in the courſe of this letter. But as to the point  
of conſolidating the States into a. federal government, it ſo  
happens, that the propoſition for that purpoſe came originally  
from myſelf. I Propoſed it in a letter to chancellor Livingſton  
in the ſpring of the year 1782, whilſt that gentleman was mi-  
  
  
by congreſs had then fallen through, having been adopted by  
  
  
and repealed by Virginia, after it had been conſented. to. The  
  
  
difficulty at once, by annexing a continental legiſlative body  
  
  
form, the caſe could only be, that either Congreſs, as it then  
. ood, muſl frame the law, and the States ſeverally adopt it  
  
  
  
3  
  
Ado e OY ihe States d dect E eoiniciental le&gt;  
giſlature for the purpoſe. Chancellor Livingſton, Robert  
Morris, Governor Morris, and myſelf, had a meeting at the  
houſe of Robert Morris on the ſubject of that letter. There  
, was no diverſity of opinion on the propoſition for a oontinen ·  
tal legiſlature: the only difficulty was on the manner of bring -  
ing the propoſition forward. For my. own part, as I conſidered  
it as a remedy i in reſerve, that could be applied at any time,  
wwhen the States ſaw themſelves. wrong enough to be put right  
a (which did not appear to be the: caſe at that time, ) I did not  
ſee the propriety of. urging it precipitately,. and declined being  
the publiſher of it myſelf. After this account of a fact, the  
leaders of your party will ſcarcely have the hardineſs to apply  
to me the term of Antifederaliſt. But I can go to a date and  
to a fact beyond this, for the propoſition for electing a conti -  
| nental convention. To form the continental government is  
one of the ſubjects treated of in the pamphlet Common Senſe. .  
Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbiſſi that might |  
otherwiſe have lain in my way, I return to the point of time  
at which the. preſent federal conſtitution and your. adminiſtra-  
tion began. It was very well faid by an anonymous writer in  
Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that- . thirteen  
ſtaves and ne er a hoop avil] not make a barrel Ng and as any. kind  
of hooping the barrel, however defectively executed, would  
be better than none, it was ſcarcely. poſſible but that conſide- |  
rable advantages mult ariſe from the, federal hooping of the  
States. It was with pleaſure that every, ſincere friend to Ame  
rica beheld as the natural effect of union, her riſing proſperity,  
and it was with grief they ſaw that proſperity mixed, even in  
the bloſſom, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of  
every kind marked your adminiſtration almoſt 3 in the moment -  
| of i its commencement. The lands obtained by the revolution  
were laviſhed upon partizans; 5 the intereſt of the diſbanded |  
ſoldier was ſold to the ſpeculator 3 in juſtice. was ated under

ondition to be removed, or to know of what was paſ⸗  
fing, or of what had paſſed, for more than à month. Ie  
makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The ae |  
I was informed of was the fall of obeſ 1 5 |  
About a week after this, Mr. Monroe viva to ſuperſede  
Governor Morris; and as ſoon as I was able to write a note le»  
gible enough to be read, I found a way to convey one to him  
by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the priſon;  
and whoſe unabated friendſhip to me, from whom he had  
never received any ſervice, and with difficulty accepted any  
recompenſe, puts the character of Mr. Waſhington to ſhame.  
In a few days I received a meſſage from Mr. Monroe, con-  
veyed to me in a note from an intermediate perſon, with aſ-  
ſurance of his friendſhip, and expreſſing a deſire tha: I would  
  
zeſt the caſe in his hands. Aſter a fortnight or more had paſ- n  
ſed, and hearing nothing farther, I wrote to a friend who was  
then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requeſting him to in-  
form me what was the true ſituation of things with reſpe&amp; to  
me. I was ſure that ſomething was the matter, I began to  
have hard thoughts of Mr. Wee, but I was wining |

I was now at no loſs to underſtand Mr. Waſhington * |

leave me to fall in France. They were ruſhing as faſt as they  
could venture, without awakening the jealouſy of America,  
into all the vices and corruptions of the Britiſſi government;  
and it was no more conſiſtent with the policy of Mr. Waſh-

proved the letter to be hypocritical, it ſerves no other pur-  
poſe of the preſetit moment than to ſhow that the writer is  
not to be credited. Two circumſtances ferved to make the  
reading of the &#x27;letter neceſſary in the Obiivehtion ; the one  
was, that they who ſucceeded on · the fall of Robefpierre, found  
it moſt proper to 2c with publicity ; the other, to extinguiſh  
the ſuſpicions which the Kranze conduct of Morris had beca-  
fioned in France. |  
When the Britiſh treaty; and ths Atta of it by Me.  
Waſhington, were known in Fra nce, all farther declarations  
from him of his good dipoſition, as an ally and a friend „  
| paſſed for ſo many cyphers ; but ſtill it appeared neceſſary to  
bim to keep up the farce of declarations. It is ſtipulated in  
the Britifli treaty, that cointtiifioners are to report, at the end  
of two years, on the caſe of neutral ſhips making neutral p Proper ty.  
In the mean time neutral ſhips do 10? make neutral property  
according to the Britiſh treaty, and they db according to the  
French treaty. | The preſetvation, therefore, of tlie French  
treaty berame of great importance to England, as by that  
means ſhe can employ American ſhips as carriers, whilſt the  
Tame advantage is denied to France. Whether the French  
  
treaty could exiſt as à matter of right after this clandeſtine

of General Waſhington. The ſame unfortunate languor that  
marked his entrance into the field, continubd always. Dif-  
content. began to prevail ſtrongly againſt him, and a  
yas formed in Congreſs, whilſt fitting at York Town, in ken-

&#x27;he hope, however, of better times, the news of the alliance  
with France, and the uavillingneſs of Genes —  
diſfipated the I +: net!  
Nothing was W in the Ms 1778, . 1780,  
in the part where general Waſhington commanded, except -  
the taking Stony- Point, by general Wayne. The ſouthern  
ſtates, in the mean time, were overrun by the enemy. They  
were afterwards recovered by general Greene, who had in 4  
very great meafure created the army that accompliſhed that  
recovery. In all this, general Waſhington had no ſhare. The  
| Fabian ſyſtem of war, followed by him, began now to un-  
  
  
Fabian means to ſupport it &gt; The finances of Congreis, de-  
pending wholly on emiſſions of paper-money, were exhauſted:  
Its credit was gone. The continental treafury was not able

In this Ktuation of f things it was fold ner only ede  
ent, but abſolutely neceſſary, for — to ſtate the kite  
_ caſe to its ally. I know more of this matter (before it came  
into Congreſs, or was known to general W aſhington) of its  
| progreſs, and its iſſue, than I chooſe to ſtate in this letter,  
Colonel John Laurens was ſent to France, as an envoy ex-  
  
  
between him and me, I accompanied him. We failed  
from Boſton, in the Alliance frigate, February 11, 1781.  
France had already done much in accepting and paying bills  
drawn by Congrefs; ſhe was now called upon to do more.  
The event of colonel Laurens s miſſion, with the aid of the  
venerable miniſter Franklin, was, that France gave in money,  
as à prefent, fix millions of livres, and ten millions more as  
a loan, and agreed to ſend a fleet of not leſs than thirty fait  
of the line, at her own expenee, as an aid to America. Co-  
lonel Laurens and myſelf returned from Breſt the firſt of  
June following, taking with us two millions and a half of  
livres (upwards of one hundred thouſand pounds Oey of  
the money given, and convoying two ſhips, with ſtores.  
We arrived at Boſton the twenty-fifth of Auguſt follow-  
ing. De Graſſe arrived with the French fleet in the &#x27;Cheſa-  
peak at the ſame time, and was afterwards joined by that of  
Barras, making thirty-one ſail of the line. The money was |  
_ tranſported in waggons from Boſton to the bank of Phila-  
delphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has fince put  
himſelf at the hegd of the liſt of petitioners in favour of the  
Britiſh treaty, - was then preſident. And it was by the aid of  
Cornwallis was taken; the laurels of which have been unjuſtly  
given to Mr. Waſhington. His merit in that affair wa. m  
more than that of any other American officer. e ©  
u have had, and ſtill have, as much ebe m merican  
winnie: as any man, or as Mr. Waſhington has a right to  
have; but that pride has never made me forgetful whence the  
great aid came that completed the buſineſs. Foreign aid (that

France) was * at the commencement of tle  
revelations It is one of the ſubjects treated of in the pam-  
5 ruten as a matter that could not be hoped &quot;oi  
- -independence was declared. - The aid, Sages wu ,  
  
greater than could have been expected. ee  
It is as well the ingratitude as the puſtlntiity: er Me.  
mn and the Waſhington faction, that has brought F  
  
merica the loſs of character ſhe now ſuffers in the  
world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone,  
and to which it is ſtill expoſed. The Britiſh miniſtry ſoon  
found out what ſort of men they had to deal with, and they 2  
dealt with them accord ingly ; and if farther explanation was  
wanting, it has been fully given fince, in the ſaivelling] ad-  
dreſs of the New York chamber of commerce to the preſi-  
dent, and in that of ſundry merchants of Philadelphiz, N. ;  
was not much better.  
| &quot;When the revolution of America was faally ctablſted by 7  
the termination of the war, the world gave her credit for great |  
character; and ſhe had nothing&#x27;to do but to ſtand firm upon  
that ground. The Britiſh miniſtry had their hands too full of  
trouble to have provoked. a rupture with her, had the ſhown  
a proper reſolution to defend her ri ights: : but, encouraged as  
they were, by the ſubmiſſive character of the American admi-  
niſtration, they proceeded from inſult to inſult, till none more 4  
were left to be offered. The propoſals made by Sweden and  
Denmark to the American government were diſregarded. I  
know not if ſo much as an anſwer has been returned to them.  
The miniſter penitentiary (as ſome of the Britin prints called 4  
him) Mr. Jay, was ſent on&#x27; a pilgrimage to London, to make  
all up by penance and petition, In the mean time, the lengthy ;

porary difficulties ought to have induced an abandoninent, of

band articles, ſuch as fire-arms, gunpowder, &amp;c. is followed by  
another which enumerates the articles not contraband. : but it is

Paris, Auguſt, 3, 1796.  
  
As cenſure is but awkwardly ſoftened by apology, I ſhall  
offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful crifis, to  
  
  
country, requires an inveſtigation uncramped by ceremony.  
There was a time when the fame of America, moral and po-  
litical, ſtood fair and high in the world, The luſtre of her  
revolution extended itſeif to every individual, and to be a ci-  
tizen of America, gave a title to reſpect in Europe. Neither  
meanneſs nor ingratitude had then mingled in the compoſition  
ot her character. Her reſiſtances to the attempted tyranny of  
England left her unſuſpected of the one, and her open ac-  
knowledgment of the aid ſhe received from France precluded  
all ſuſpicion of the other. The politicsof Waſhington had  
not then appeared. | |  
At the time I left America (April 1787) the continental  
Convention, that formed the federal conſtitution, was on the.  
point of meeting. Since that tune new ſchemes of politics,  
and new diſtin&amp;ions of parties, have ariſen. The term An-  
tifederaliſt has been applied to all thoſe who combated the de-  
fects of that conſtitution, or oppoſed the meaſures of your  
adminiſtration. It was only to the abſolute neceſlity of eſtab-  
liſhing ſome federal authority, extending equally over all the  
States, that an inſtrument ſo inconſiſtent as the preſent federal  
conſtitution is, obtained a ſuffrage. I would have voted for  
it myſelf, had [-been in America, or even for a worſe, rather  
than have haq none; provided it contained. the means of re-  
medying its defects by the ſame appeal to the people, by  
which it was to be. eſtabliſhed. It is always better policy to  
leave removable errors to expoſe themſelves, than to hazard

J have introduced theſe obſervations not only to mark the  
general difference between Antifederaliſt and Anticonſtitution-  
aliſt, but to preclude the effect, and even the application, of  
  
  
to ſeveral matters in the conſtitution, particularly to the man-  
ner in which what is called the executive is formed, and to the  
long duration of the ſenate; and if I live to return to America,  
  
  
clare myſelf oppoſed to almoſt the whole of vour adminittra-  
tion; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not perfidious,  
as I ſhall ſhow in the courſe of this letter. But as to the point  
of conſolidating the States into a federal government, it ſo  
happens, that the . for that purpoſe came originally  
From myſelf. I propoſed it in a letter to chancellor Livingſton  
in the ſpring of the year 1782, whilſt that gentleman was mi-  
niſter for foreign affairs. The five per cent duty recommended  
by „ e had then fallen a oy having been adopted by  
ſome of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode Iſland,  
and repealed by Virginia, after it had been conſented to. The  
propoſal in the leiter I allude to, was to get over the whole  
  
  
to Congreſs; for in order to have any law of the Union uni-  
form, the caſe could only be, that either Congreſs, as it then  
ſtood, muſt frame the law, and the States ſeverally adopt it  
without alteration, or, the States muſt ele&amp; a continental le-  
giſlature for the purpoſe. Chancellor Livingſton, Robert  
Morris, Governor Morris, and myſelf, had a mectiog at the  
Houſe of Robert Morris on the ſubject of that letter. There  
was no diverſity of . on th propoſition for a continen-  
tal legiſlature: the only difficulty was on the manner of bring-  
ing the propoſition forward. For my own part, as I conſidered  
it as a remedy in reſerve, that could be applied at any time,  
ewhen the States ſaw themſelves wrong enough to be put right  
  
which did not appear to be the caſe at that time,) I did not  
  
e the propriety of urging i precipitately, and declined being  
the publiſher of it myſelf. After this account of a fact, the  
  
  
to me the term of Antifederaliſt. But I can go to a date and  
to a faft beyond this, for the propoſition for electing a conti-  
  
  
one of the ſubjects treated of in the pamphlet Common Sen/c.  
Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbiſh that might  
otherwiſe have lain in my way, I return to the point of time  
at which the preſent federal conſtitution and your adminiſtra-  
tion began. It was very well faid by an anonymous writer in  
Ghia, about a year before that period, that irrten

ftaves and ne er a hoop will not make a barrel;” and as any kind  
  
of hooping the barrel, however defectively executed, would  
be better than none, it was ſcarcely poſfible but that conſide-  
rable advantages mult, ariſe from the federal hooping of the  
States. It was with pleaſure that every ſincere friend to Ame-  
rica beheld as the natural effect of union, her riſing proſperity,  
and it was with grief they ſau that proſperity mixed, even in  
the bloTom, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of  
every kind marked your adminiſtration almoſt in the moment  
of its commencement. The lands obtained by the revolution  
were laviſhed: upon partizans; the intereſt of the diſbanded  
ſoldier was ſold to the ſpeculator ; injuſtice was acted under  
the pretence of faith; and the chief of the army became rhe  
patron of the fraud. From ſuch a beginning what elſe cuuld te  
expected, than what has happeged? A mean and ſervile ſub-  
miſſion to the inſults of one nation; treachery and ingratitude  
to another. | CF.  
  
Sdme vices make their approach with ſuch a ſplendid ap-  
  
earance, that we ſcarcely know to what claſs of moral diſ-  
tinctions they belong. They are rather virtues corrupted than  
vices originally. Eut meannefs and ingratitude have nothing  
equivocal in their character. There is not a trait in them that  
renders them doubtful. They are fo originally vice, that they  
are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into&#x27;ex-  
iſtence with the filth upon their back. The fugitives have  
found protection in vou, and the levee-room is their place of  
rendezvous. | |  
  
As the federal conſtitution is a copy, though not quite ſo  
bafe as the original, of the form of the Britiſh government, an  
imitation of its vices was naturally to be expected. So inti-  
mate is the connection between form and practice, that to adopt  
the one is to invite the other. Imitation is naturally progreſ-  
ſive, and is rapidly ſo in matters that are vicious.  
  
Sgon after the federal conſtitution arrived in England, I re-  
ceived a letter from a female literary correſpondent (a native  
of New York) very well mixed with friendſhip, ſentiment,  
and politics. In my anſwer to that letter, I permitted myſelf  
to ramble into the wilderneſs of imagination, and to anticipate

Impreſſed as I was, with apprehenſions of this kind, I  
  
  
afterwards made. The Firſt, and ſtill more, the Second Part  
of the Rights of Man, bear evident marks of this watchful-  
nefs; and the diſſertations on Firſt Principles of Government  
oes more directly to the point than either of the former.  
now &#x27;paſs on to other ſubjects.  
It will be fuppoſed by thoſe into whoſe hands this letter may  
fall, that I have ſome perſonal reſentment againſt you : and  
I will therefore ſettle this point before I proceed further.  
If I have any reſentment, you muſt acknowledge that 1

declared (for what are private reſentments to the public) if  
the cauſe of it did not unite itſelf as well with your public as  
with your private character, and with the motives of your  
political conduct. „55  
The part I acted in the American revolution is well known.  
I ſhall not here repeat it. I know alſo, that, had it not been  
for the aid received from France, in men, money, and chips,  
your cold and unmilitary conduct (as I ſhall ſhew in the _

((g&#x27;9)

at leaſt ſhe would not have been the independant nation the *  
now is. You ſlept away your time in the field, till the f̃nances  
of the country were completely exhauſted; and you have but  
little ſhare in the glory of the final event.“ It is time, firs.  
to ſpeak the undifguifed language of Hiſtofical truth. |  
  
Elevated to the chair of the preſidency, you aſſumed the  
merit of every thing to yourſelf; and the natural ingratitude  
of your conſtitution. began to appear. Vou commenced your  
prefidental career by encouraging and ſwallowing the groſſeſt  
adulation; and you travelled Awerica from one end to the +  
other to put yourſelf in the way of receiving it. You have as  
many addreſſes in your cheſt as James the Second. As to-  
what were your views, for if you are not great efough to hade  
ambition vou are little enough to have vanity, they cannot be  
directly inferred from e xpreſſions of your on; but the par-  
tizans of your politics have divulged the ſecret.  
  
John Adams has ſaid, (and John it is knhown was always a.  
ſpeller after places and offices, and never thought his little ſer-  
vices were highly enough paid) John has ſaid, that as Mr.  
Waſhington had no child, the preſidency Thould be made he-  
reditary in the family of Eun Waſhington. John might then  
  
  
for his deſcendants. He did not go ſo tar as to fay alſo, that  
the vice preſidency ſhould be herèditary in the family of John  
Adams. He prudently left that to ſtand upon the ground, that  
one gaod turn deſerves another. pet  
Jolin Adams is one of thoſe inen who never contemplated.  
the origin. of government, or comprehended any thing of firſt  
principles. If he had, he might have ſeen, that the right to  
ſet up and eſtabliſh hereditary government never did, and  
never can, exiſt in any generation at any time whatever; that  
it. is of the nature of treaſon, becauſe it is an attempt to  
take away the rights of all the miners Hving at that time, and  
of all ſucceeding generations. It is of a degree beyond com-  
mon treaſon; it is a ſin againſt nature. The equal rights of  
generations it is a right fixed in the nature of things, it belongs  
to the ſon when of age, as it belonged to the father before him.  
John Adams would himſelf deny- the right that any former de-  
ceaſed generation could have to decree aut horitatively a ſucceſ-  
fion of governors over him or over his children, and yet le  
aſſumes a;pretended right, treaſonable as it is, of acting it him?

As my citizenſhip in America was not altered or diminiſhed  
by any thing I had done in Europe (on the contrary, it ought  
to have been conſidered as ſtrengthened, for it was the Ameri-

in Europe), and as it is the duty of every government to charge  
itſelf with the care of anv of its citizens who may happen to  
fall under an arbitrary perſecution abroad, and this is alſo one of  
  
  
it was the duty of the executive department in America, to  
have made, at leaſt ſome, enquiries about me, as ſoon as  
it heard of my impriſonment. But it this had not been the  
caſe, that government owed it to me on every ground and  
principle of honour and gratitude. Mr. Waſhington owed it  
to me on every ſcore of private acquaintance, I will not now

know him, that he has no friendſhips, that he is incapable of  
forming any; he can ſerve or deſert a man, or a cauſe, with  
conſtitutional indifference; and it is this cold hermaphrodite

I was informed of was the fall of Robeſpierre. |

by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the priſon ;  
and whoſe unabated friendſhip to me, from whom he had  
never received any ſervice, and with difliculty accepted any

The part in Mr. Monroe&#x27;s letter, in which he ſpeaks of the  
Preſident, (Mr Wathington) is put in ſoft language. Mr.  
Monroe knew what Mr. Waſhington had ſaid formerly, and  
he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact is, not only  
that Mr, Waſhington had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as  
the letter ſtated 3 but he did not ſo much as ſay to him, inquire  
if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in priſon or out, or ſee if there  
be any aſſiſtance we can give him. |

- While theſe matters were paſſing, the liberations from the  
priſons were numerous; from twenty to forty in the courſe  
of almoſt every twenty-four hours. The continuance of my  
  
  
from America, which was now more than two months, was a  
matter ſo obviouſly ſtrange, that I found the character of the  
American government ſpoken of in very unqualified terms of  
reproach ; not only by thoſe who ſtill remained in priſon, but  
by thoſe who were liberated, and by perſons who had acceſs to  
the priſon from without. Under theſe circumſtances, I wrote  
again to Mr. Monroe, and found occaſion to ſay, among  
other things, It will not add to the popularity of Mr.  
« Waſhington, to have it believed in America, as it is be  
« Heved here, that he connives at my impriſonment.”  
  
The caſe, ſo far as it reſpected Mr. Monroe, was, that hav-  
  
  
Governor Morris had thrown#in the way of a ſucceſſor, and  
having no authority from the American 8 to ſpeak  
officially upon any thing relating to me, he found himſelf ob-  
liged to proceed by unofficial means with individual members;  
for though Robeſpierre was overthrown, the Robeſpierrian  
members of the Committee of Public Safety, ſtill remained in  
conſiderable force, and had they found out, that Mr. Monroe  
had no official authority upon the caſe, they would have paid  
little or no regard to his reclamation of me. In the mean  
time my health was ſuffering exceedinyly, the dreary proſpect  
of winter was coming on; and impriſonment was ſtill a thing  
of danger. After the Robeſpierrian members of the Com-  
  
  
ing, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was liberated the 4th  
of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the beginning  
of Auguſt before. All that period of my impriſonment, at  
leaſt, I owe not to Robeſpierre, but to his colleague in pro-  
jets, George Waſhington. Immediately upon my liberation,  
Mr. Monroe invited me to his houſe, where I remained more  
than a year and half; and 1 ſpeak of his aid and friendſhip,  
as ar? open-hearted man will always do in ſuch a caſe, with  
reſpe&amp; and gratitude. .  
  
Soon after my liberation the Convention paſſed an unani-  
mous vote, to invite me to return to my fr among them,  
The times were ſtill unſettled and dangerous, as well from  
without as within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the  
conſtitution not ſettled. I choſe, however, to accept the in-  
vitation ; for as I undertake nothing but what I believe to be  
right, I abandon nothing that I undertake; and I was willing  
alſo to ſhow, that, as I was not of a caſt of mind, to be de-  
terred by proſpects or retroſpects of danger, ſo neither were

| being now once more abroad in the world, I began to  
find that 1 was not the only one who had conceived an unfa-  
vourable opinion of Mr, Waſhington ; it was evident that  
his character was on the decline as well among Americans,  
as among foreigners of different nations. From being the  
chief of the government, he had made himſelf the chief of  
a party; and his integrity was queſtioned, for his politics had  
a doubtful appearance. The miſſion of Mr. Jay to Hunden,  
notwithſtanding there was an American miniſter there already,  
bad then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It  
appeared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in myſte-  
ry, which every day ſerved either to increaſe or to explain  
into matter of ſuſpicion. EF 6 4} erg  
  
In the year 1799, or about that time, Mr. . Waſhington,  
as prefident, had ſent Governor Morris to London, as his  
ſecret * agent, to have ſome communication with the .Briyſh  
miniſtry. &#x27; To cover the agency of Morris it was given out,  
I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert  
Morris, to borrow money in wn. and the report was per-  
mitted to paſs uncontradicted. The event of Morris&#x27;s nego-  
ciation was, that Mr. Hammond was ſent miniſter, from Eug-  
land to America, Pinkney from America ta England, and  
himſelf miniſter to France. If, while Morris was miniſter in  
France, he was nat an emiſſary of the Britiſh miniſtry and  
the coaleſced powers, he gave ſtrong reaſon to ſuſpect him of  
it. No one who ſaw his conduct, and heard his converſation,  
could doubt his being in their intereſt; and bad he not got  
off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been in  
arreſtation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of  
the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was making  
after imm. h . + 1818  
  
A great buſtle has been made by Mr. Waſhington about  
the conduct of Genet in America, whilſt that of bis--own  
miniſter, Morris, in France was infinitely more reproachable.  
If Genet was imprudent or raſh, he was not treacherous ; but  
Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French re-  
  
  
duct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his  
character, Mr. Waſhington, in a letter he wrote to him at  
the time of recalling him on the complzint and requeſt of the  
Committee of Public Safety, aſſures him, that though he had  
complied with that requeſt, he ſtill retained the ſame. efteem  
and friendſhip for. him -as before. This letter Mofris was

very evident; but it was juſt ſuch a letter as his conduct ap-

I am not refuting or contradicting the falſehood of this  
publication, for it is ſukciently notorious; neither am I cen-  
ſuring the writer: on the contrary, I thank him for the expla-  
nation he has incautioufly given of the principles of the Waſh-

J have now done with Mr. Waſhington on the ſcore of  
rivate affairs. It would have been far more agreeable to me,  
had his conduct been ſuch as not to have merited theſe re-  
proaches. Errors, or caprices of the temper, can be pardoned  
and forgotten; but a cold . eliberate crime of the heart, iuch  
as Mr. Waſhington is capable of acting, is not to be waſhed  
away -I now proceed to other matter:  
After Jay&#x27;s note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America,  
the character of every thing that was to follow might be eaſilv  
foreſeen; and it was 2 this anticipation that my letter of  
February the twenty-ſecond was founded. The event has  
proved that I was not miſtaken, except that it has been much  
worſe than I expected. | |  
It would naturally occur to Mr. Waſhington, that the ſe-  
  
  
American miniſter, could not but create ſome ſuſpicion in the  
French government, eſpecially as the conduct of Morris had  
  
  
Morris was known.  
  
The character which Mr. Waſhington has attempted to ad  
in the world, is a ſort of non-deſcribable cameleon coloured  
thing, called Prudence. It is, in many caſes, a ſubſtitute for  
Principle, and is ſo nearly allied to Hypocriſy, that it eaſily  
ſlides into it. His genius for prudence furniſhed him, in this  
inſtance, with an expedient that ſerved (as is the natural and  
general character of all expedients) to diminiſh the embarraſl-  
ment of the moment, and multiply them afterwards; for he  
cauſed it to be announced to the French government as a con-  
fidential matter (Mr. Waſhington ſhould recolle&amp; that I was a  
  
  
  
  
on the ſcore of Mr. Jay&#x27;s miſſion to England, that the object  
of that miſſion, and Mr. Jay&#x27;s authority, were reſtricted to  
the demanding of the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, and in-  
demnification for the cargoes captured in American veſſels, —  
Mr. Waſhington knows that this was untrue; and knowing  
this, he had good reaſon, to himſelf, for refuſing to turniſh  
the Houſe of Repreſentatives. with copies of tie inſtructions  
given to Jay, as he might ſuſpect, among other things, that

in one ſly falſehood. When one is detected, a thouſand are  
ſuſpected. | | |  
The firſt account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being ne-  
gotiated by Mr. Jay (for nobody ſuſpected any) came in an  
Engliſh newſpaper, which announced that a treaty, offen/rve  
  
  
of America and England. This was, immediately denied by  
every American in Paris, as an impoſſible thing; and theugh  
it was diſbelieved by the French, it imprinted a ſuſpicion  
that ſome underhand buſineſs was going forward. At length  
the treaty itſelf arrived, and every well- affected American  
bluſhed with ſhame.

ſlough of negociation, and, whilſt it amuſed France with pro-  
feſſions of friendſhip contrived to infure her, immediately

graphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for  
Tance, without whoſe aſſiſtance, in men, money, and ſhips,  
Mr. Waſhington would have cut but a poor figure in the  
33 war. But of his military talents I ſhall ſpeak here -  
after.  
  
J mean not to enter into any diſcuſſion of any article of  
Jay&#x27;s treaty ; I ſhall ſpeak only upon the whole of it. It is  
attempted to be juſtified on the ground of its not being a  
violation of any article or articles of the treaty pre-exiſting  
with France. But the ſovereign right of explanation does  
not lie with George Waſhington and his man Timothy ;  
  
  
nations diſpute, it is not ſo much about worcs as about  
things. |

often happens in the cabaliſtica] circle of what is called law.  
But-when this is attempted to be, acted on the national ſcale of  
treaties, it is too deſpicable to be defended, or to be permitted  
to exiſt, Yet this is the trick upon which Jay&#x27;s treaty is  
  
founded,  
  
  
TT

with France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and per-  
verts all the .great articles of that treaty to the injury of  
France, and makes them -operate as a bounty to England,  
  
  
tion ſhows great deſire that the ny between France and the  
United States be preſerved. Nobody can doubt its fincerity  
upon this matter. There is not a Britiſh miniſter, a Britiſh  
merchant, or a Britiſh agent or factor, in America, that does  
not anxioufly wiſh the ſame thing. The treaty with France  
ſerves now as a paſſport to ſupply England with naval ſtores,  
and other articles of American produce; whilſt he fame  
articles when coming to France are made contraband, or ſeiz-  
able, by Jay&#x27;s treaty with England. The treaty with France  
lars, that neutra! ſhips make neutral property, and thereby  
gives protection to Engliſh property on board American ſhips;  
and Jay&#x27;s treaty delivers up French property on board Ame-  
rican ſhips to be ſeized by the Engliſh, It is too paltry to talk

« of freedom.” Mr. Waſhington, having expended ſo many  
fine phraſes upon himſelf, was obliged to invent a new one  
for the French, and he calls them 5 Wonderful people! —  
  
  
It is laughable to hear Mr. Waſhington talk of his e  
thetic Feelings, who has always been remarked, even among  
his friends, for not having any, He has, however, given no  
2 of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums he fo  
  
iherally pays to himſelf on the ſcore of the American revolu-  
tion, the propriety of them may be queſtioned; and, fince  
he has forced them ſo much into Ace it is fair 0 examine  
his pretenſions. n ene 5  
  
A ſtranger might be led to ſuppoſe, from the egotiſm with  
which Mr. Waſhington ſpeaks, that himſelf, and himſelf only,  
had generated, condu ted Completed, and eſtabliſhed, tue  
revolution. In fine, that it wis all his own doing. 1+  
la the firſt place, as to thig-political! aft, he had no mare  
in it; aud therefore the ebf Har is tut of the que ſtion  
with reſpect to him. There remains, then, only tite military  
part; and it would have been prud: ent in Mei Waſhington  
not to bave/awakened inquiry upon that ſubject. Fame then  
was che&gt;p;; he enjoyed it eheaply; and nobody was diſpoſed  
to take away thelaurels thatz whether: wy ns ig: or  
not, had been penn: en.  
  
Mr. Wafhington&#x27;s merit confiſted in conſtancy. But con-  
ſtancy was the common virtue of the-revelution. Who was  
there that was inconſtant? I&#x27;ktiow but of one military defec-  
tion, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection,  
among thoſe who made themſelves eminent when the revolu--  
tion was formed by the declaration of independence. Even  
Silas Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did- not betray.  
  
But when we ſpeak of military character, ſomethiug more  
is to be underſtood thaw&lt;onftancy ; and ſome hing more ol  
to be underſtood than the Fabian ſyſtem of doing nothing. The  
nothing part can be done by any body. Old Mrs: Thompſon,”  
the houſekeeper of head-quarters (who threatened to makes  
the ſun and the wind ſhine through Rivington of New-York):

The hope however of better times, the news of the alliance  
  
  
difipated the matter.  
  
Nothing was done in the campaign of 17 78, 1779, 1780,  
in the part where general Waihington commatided, except  
the taking Sto v- Point by gene.al Wayne. The ſouthern  
Rates in the mean time were overrun by the enemy. They  
were afterwa:ds recovered Ly general Greene, who had in a  
very great meaſare created the ariny that accompliſhed that  
recavery. In all this general Waſhington had no thare. The  
Fabian ſyſtem of war, followed by him, began now to un-  
fold itſelf with all its evils; for what is Fabian war without  
Fabian means to ſupport it? The finances of Congreſs, de-  
pending wholly on emiſſions of Paper-money, were exliauſted,  
  
  
to pay the expence of a brigade of waggons to tranſport the  
neceſſary ſtores to the army, and yet the ſole object, the eſta-  
bliſument of the revolution, was a rhing of remote diſtance.  
The time I am now ſpeaking of is in the latter end of the  
year 1780.  
  
In this ſituation of things it was fo nd not only exi-

between him and me, I accompanied him. We failed from

drawn by Congreſs; ſhe was now called upon to do more.  
The event of colonel Laurens&#x27;s miſſion, with the aid of the  
venerable miniſter Franklin, was, that France gave in money,  
as a preſent, fix millions of livres, -and ten millions more as  
a loan, and agreed to ſend a fleet of not leſs than thirty ſail  
of the line, at her own expenſe, as an aid to America. Co-  
lonel Laurens and myſelf returned from Breſt the firſt of  
June following, taking with us two millions and a half of  
livres (upwards of one hundred thouſand pounds ſterling) of  
the money given, and convoying two ſhips with ſtores.  
Me arrived at Boſton the twenty - fifth of &#x27; Auguſt follow-  
ing. De Graſſe arrived with the French fleet in the Cheſa-  
  
ak at the ſame time, and was afterwards joined by that of  
a, making thirty-one ſil of the line. The money was  
tranſported in waggons from Boſton to the bank of Phila-  
delphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has ſince put  
himſelf at the head of the liſt of petitioners in favoar of the  
-Britiſh treaty, was then preſident. And it was by the aid of  
this money, of this fleet, and of Rochambeau&#x27;s army, that  
Cornwallis was taken; the laurels of which has been unjuſtly  
given to Mr. Wafhington. His merit in that affair was no  
more than that of any other American officer.  
  
I have had, and ſtill have, as much pride in the American  
revolution as avy man, or as Mr. Wafhington has a right to  
have; but that pride has never made me forgetful whence the  
great aid came that completed the buſineſs. Foreign aid (that  
of France) was calculated upon at the commencement of the  
  
  
let Common Senſe, but as a matter that could not be hoped for,  
unleſs independence was declared. The aid however was  
greater than could have been expected, |  
  
It is as well the ingratitude as the puſillanimity of Mr.  
Waſhington, and the Waſhington faction, that has brought  
upon America the loſs of character ſhe now ſuffers in the  
world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone,  
and to which it is ſtill expoſed. The Britiſh miniſtry, ſoon

her treaty with America, when he was making  
ſuch large conceſſions in favour of England.  
The injury which Mr. Waſhington&#x27;s adminiſtra-  
tion has done to the character, as well as to the -  
commerce of America, is too great to be repaired  
by him. Foreign nations will be ſhy of making &quot;i  
treaties with a government, that has given the  
faithleſs example of perverting the liberality of a  
former treaty to the 1 injury of the ns with whom |  
it was made.  
  
In what a fraudulent light a Mr. Waſhing-  
tons character appear in the world, when his de-  
clarations and his conduct are compared together?  
  
Here follows the letter he wrote to the committee  
of public ſafety, whilſt Jay was negotiating i in pro-

‘ John Adams has faid (and John it is known was always a

ditary in the family of Lun Wafhington. John might then have  
counted upon fome finecure for himfelf, and a provifion for his  
defcendants. He did not go fo far as to fav alfo, that the vice-  
srefidency fhould be hereditary in the family of John Adams,  
He prudently left that to ftand upon the ground, that one good  
turn deferves another *.  
  
¢ John Adams is one of thofe men who never contemplated the  
  
origin of government, or comprehended any thing of firft prin-  
ciples. If he had, he might have feen, that the right to fet up  
and eltablifh hereditary government never did, and never can  
exift in any generation, at any time whatever; that it is of the  
nature of treafon, becaufe it is an attempt to take away the rights  
of all the minors living at that time, and of all fucceeding genes  
rations, It is of a degree beyond common treafon; it is a fin  
againit nature. The equal rights of generations is a right fixed in the  
nature of things. [t belongs to the fon when of age, as it belonged  
co the father before him. John Adams would himfelf deny the  
right that_any former deceafed generation could have to decree  
authoritatively a fucceffion of governors over him or over his  
children, and yet he affumes the pretended right, treafonable as  
itis, of acting it himfelf. His ignorance is the beft excufe.  
&#x27; * John Jay has faid, (and this John was always the fycophant  
of every thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America, to  
Grenville in England) John Jay has faid, that the fenate fhould  
have been appointed for life. He would then have been fure of  
never wanting a lucrative appointment for himfelf, and have had  
no fears about impeachment. Thefe are the difguifed traitors:  
that call themfelves federalifts.’  
  
Mr. P. next fiates the caufe of his imprifonment, which, a$  
well as all the other horroars of that period, he attributes to * the  
brutal letter of the duke of Brunfwick.”? On that, as on every

EXTRACTS.  
  
PAINE’S CHARACTER OF GENERAL  
WASHINGTON,  
  
“ A STRANGER might be led  
to fuppofe, from the egotifm with  
which Mr. Wathington {peaks, that  
himfelf, and himfelf only, had generat-  
ed, conducted, completed, and efta-  
blifthed the revolution’ In fine, that  
it was all his own doing.  
  
*« In the firlt place, as to the politi-  
cal part, he had no (hare in it; and  
therefore. the whole of that is  
out of the queftion with refpect  
to him. There remains, then, only  
the military part; and it weuld have  
been prudent in Mr. Wafhington not  
to have awakened inquiry upon that  
fubjeét. Fame then was cheap; he -  
enjoyed it cheaply ; and nobody was  
difpofed to take away the laurels, that,  
whether they were acquired or not, had  
been given.  
  
«© Mr. Wahhington’s merit confitted  
in conftancy. But conflancy was the  
common virtue of the revolution.  
Who was there that was inconitant?  
I know but of one military defection,  
that of Arnold; and I know of no  
political defection, among thofe who  
made themfelves eminent when the  
revolution was formed by the declava-  
tion Of independence. | Even Silas  
Deane, though he attempted to de-  
fraud, did not betray. »

Paine’s Letter to Wa/bington,  
  
removing him from the command of  
the armye The hope, however, of  
better rimes, the news of the alliance  
with France, and the unwillingnefs of  
fhewing difcontent, diffipated the  
matter.  
  
«« Nothing was done in the cam-  
paign of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the  
part where General Wafhington com-  
manded, except the taking Stony  
Point by General Wayne. ‘The  
fouthern ftates, in the mean time,  
were overrun by the enemy. ‘They  
were afterwards recovered by Gene-  
ral Greene, who had, in a very great  
meafure, created the army that accom-  
plifhed that recovery. In all this  
General Wathington had no fthare.  
The Fabian fyftem of war, followed by  
him, began now to unfold itfelf with  
all its evils; for what.is Fabian war  
without Fabian means to fupport it?  
The finances of Congrefs, depend-  
ing wholly on emiffions of paper  
money, were exhaufted. ,Its credit  
was gone. The continental treafury  
was not able to, pay the expence of a  
brigade of waggons to tranfport the  
neceflary ftores to the army, and yet  
the fole object, the eftablifhment of the  
revolution, was a thing of remote  
diftance. The time I am now fpeak-  
ing of is in the latter end of the year  
178a.  
  
* In this fituation of things it was  
found not only expedient, but abfo-  
jutely necefflary, for Congrefs to ftate  
the whole cafe to its ally. I know  
more of this matter (before it came  
into Congrefs,.or was known to Gene-  
ral Wafhington), of its progrefs, and  
its iffue, than 1 chufe to ftate in this  
letter, Colonel John Lawrens was  
fent to France, as an envoy extraordi-  
nery, on this occafion, and, by a  
private agreement between him and  
me, | accompanied him. We failed  
from Botton in the Alliance frigate,  
February 11, 1781. France had al-  
ready done much in accepting and  
paying bills drawn by Congrets, the  
was now called upon to do more.  
The event of Colonel Lawrens’s mil-  
  
Vou. I—No, I,  
  
75  
  
fion, with the aid of the venerable  
minifter Franklin,was, that Frange gave  
in money,as a prefént, fix nuillions ot  
livres, and ten millions more asa loan,  
and agreed to fend a fleet of not lefs  
than thirty fail of the line, at her own  
expence, aS an aid to America. Col.  
Lawrens and myfelf returned from  
Breft the firft of June following, taking  
with ys two millions and a half ot  
livres (upwards of two hundred thou-  
fand pounds) of the money given, and  
convoying two fhips with ftores,  
  
“¢ We arrived at Bofton the twenty  
fifth of Augutt following. De Graffe  
arrived with the French fleet in the  
Chefapeak at the fame time, and was  
afterwards joined by that of Barras,  
making thirty-one fail of the line.  
The money was tranfported in waggons  
from Botton to the bank of Philadel-  
phia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing,  
who has fince put himfelf at the head  
of the lift of petitioners in favour of  
the Britith treaty, was then prefident.  
And it was by the aid of this money,  
of this fleet, and of Rochambeau’s  
army, that Cornwallis was taken, the  
laurels of which have been unjuftly  
given to Mr. Wafhington. His meric  
in that affair was no more than that of  
  
any other American officer.””  P, 54

Paris, _71r/y Zotb, 1796.  
As censusire is but awkwardiy lotrenedsi  
by ap&#x27;ology, [shall oﬀer you no apology­  
sisct-sol&#x27; this letter. The eventful crifis to  
{which your double poiittcsis have condutlct  
  
, ed the aﬀairs of our country, requires anss  
&#x27; inveﬄgatton uncramped by-ceremony.  
  
There was a time when the fame of A­  
  
medies, moral end political, stood fair and  
  
big h tn the world. The lustre of her re­  
volunon exrended its- if to ever) individu  
dl; end to be a citizen of America gave a  
  
. title to respect in Earopcte. The Wash­  
  
ington or polirics had not then appeared.  
Atthe time I left America ( April r 787)  
  
_ the continental oonvention that formed the  
  
sederal constitution was oathe point of  
meeting. Since that time rtcte&#x27;w schemes of  
  
.politics and new distinctions os parties,  
  
have&quot; arisen. The term Autifeaeralst has  
been atp&#x27;sied to ssall those who combated  
the des: is of that eonstitution, or oppos.  
ed the measures of your administration.  
It was only to the absolute necessity of es.  
tablishing some sederal authority, extend­  
ing equally over all the states, that an in­  
ﬂrument, so inconsistent as the present se.  
  
deral conttttuttonts, obtatneu a tuurage.  
I would have v—oted for it myself, had I  
ctsibeen in America, or even for : &quot;worse ra­  
si_ ther than have none ; provided it contain­  
ul: ed the means of remedying its desccts by  
&#x27; Who-same appcal to the people by which it  
wai-tohe etlablished. It is always bet  
_ ter.policy to leave removeable errors to  
expose themselves, than to hazard too  
much in contending against them theore­  
tisscally.  
&quot;&#x27;I have introduced those observations,  
nor only to mark the general diﬀerence  
betwsieen antisederalist and antissconstituti­  
onalisl, but to preclude the eﬀect, and  
even the application, of the former of those  
terms to myself. I declare myself Oppos.  
ed to several matters in the constitution,  
siparticularly to the manner in which, what  
si is called the Executive, is formed, and  
to the long duration of the Senate; and  
if I live to return to America Iwill use  
all my endeavors to have them altered.ill  
I also declare mystelsopposed to almost the  
whole of your adminifirarion .; for I know  
it to have been deceitsul, is not even per­  
fidious, asctI shall shew in the course of  
this letter. But as to the point of conso­  
lidating the states into a sederal govern.  
  
them, it to happens, that me propotttton  
for that purpose came originally from my.  
sels. &quot;&#x27;I proposed it in a letter to Chan.  
cellor Livingston in the spring ol the year  
1782, whilst that gentleman was minister  
for soreign aﬀairs. The five per cent. du­  
ty recommended by Congress had then  
sallen through, haying been adopted by  
some of the states, altered by others, re.  
&#x27; jected by Rhode Island, and repealed by  
Virginia after it had been consented to.  
The proposal in the letter I allude to was  
to get over the whole of the difficulty at  
once, by annexing a continental legisla.  
tive body to Congt&#x27;ess; for, in order to  
have any law of the Union uniform, the  
Cast: could only be, that tithes Congress,  
_ as it then stood, must frame the law, and  
the states severally adopt it without alter­  
__ ation, or, the states must elect a Conti­  
&amp; nental Legiﬂature for the purpose. Chan­  
cellor Livingston, Robert Morris, Go.  
verneur Morris and myself had a meeting  
at the house of Robert Morrsiiz on the sub.  
ject of that letter. There was no diver­  
tity of opinion on the proposrtion for ass  
Continental Leg-nature. The only dif._  
ficulty-was on the manner of bringing the  
proposttion forward. For my own part,  
as I considered it as a remedy in resetve,  
that could be applied at any time, when  
-- tbefiatersmu tbemctse/ctvc—r wrong-enough to be  
put right (which did noc appear to me to  
be the case at that time) I did not see the  
pmpriety of urging it precipitately, and  
declined being the publisher of it myself.  
After this account of a fact, the leaders of  
your party will scarcely have the. hardi­  
\ o -  
ﬂesh to apply to me the term of atsirtticdera­  
list. But I can go ton date and to a fact ss  
beyond this; for the proposition for e- ss  
lediug a Cootinental Convention to form

Sng/e.  
Having thus cleared away a little of  
the rubhcttsh that might otherwise have  
lain in my way, I return to the point of  
time at whith the present Federal Consti­  
tuticn and your admi nistration beg,-w. It  
was very welisaid&#x27; by an anon) mous wri­  
ter in Philadelphia, about a year before  
that period, that &quot; thirteen ﬂa ws and  
he &#x27;er (: heap evil/int male (: barrel, &quot; and  
as any kind of hooping the barrel, howe­  
ver desed&#x27;tiveicty executed, would tie better  
than none, it was scarce.y p.) ﬂihlc but that  
considerable advantages mutt arite from  
the federal heat-zing of the states. It was  
wi.h pleasure that every sincere friendt to  
Amerita beheld, as the natural eﬀect of  
union, her rising prosperity- , and it was  
with grief they saw that orosperity mix.  
ed, even in the biofiom, with [? e germ of  
corruption. Monopolies of every kind  
marked your admini&#x27;dration almost in the  
moment ofits commencement. The lands  
  
.s bjects treated of in the pamphlet Common  
  
obtained by the revdlution were lnvished ct  
  
upon partizuns; the interest of the dis  
  
banded soldier was sold to the s&#x27;zeculator , ;  
  
injusticc was actcd under the premncc o!  
  
faith; and the chief of the army became \
the patron ofthe lraud. From such a be- ;  
  
ginning whatcouid be expected, but what  
  
_ has happened. ? A mean ani settile sub.  
  
  
mission to the insults of one nation, treach­  
  
cry and ingtatitudc to another.  
  
Some vices make their approach with *  
such asplendid appearance, that we scutcc. 3  
ly know to what class of moral diﬀinc&#x27;ti. ss  
ons they belong. They are taches virtues ss  
  
corrupted, than vices originally. But  
meanness and ing.-r. r.:itude hctv .-c DOIhit&#x27;g

]ohn Adams has said (and ]ohn, it is

juhn Adams is one of those men who  
never contemplated the origin ot govern­

It is of a degree beyond common treason.  
It is a sin against nature. The equal  
right of generations is a right fixed in the  
nature of things. Ithelongs to the son  
when of age, as it elonged to the sather

. TO  
GENERAL WASHINGTON.  
[: C antinaei . ]  
I had then been imprisoned seven months,  
and the silence of the executive governct  
ment osAmerica, Mr. Washington; uponsisi  
the case and upon every thing respecting  
me, was explanation enough to Robes.  
pierze that he might proceed to exrtemi-ctss  
lies. ,  
I A violent fever which had nearly ter- ]  
ssm&#x27;znatssed my existcnce, was, I believe, the  
circumstance that preserved it. I was  
not in a condition to be removed, or to  
  
  
know oswhat was passing, or of what  
  
had passed for more than&quot; a month. It si  
  
makes ablank in my remembrance of life.  
  
The first thing I was informed of was .  
  
the fall of Roberspiere.  
About a week after tiis Mr. Mon­  
roe arrived to—supercede Gouvernenr ivlor­  
ris, and as soon as I was able to write a  
note legihle enough to he read, ] sound a  
  
way to convey one to him, by me? [is of  
  
the man who lighted the lamps in the  
  
prison; and whose nnabated friendship to—  
  
me, lrom whom he had never received any  
service, and with di ffieulty accepted any  
recompence, puts the&#x27; character of Mr.  
, Washington to shasine.  
ss In a few (in) 5 I received a message from  
Mr. Monrne, convey ed to me in a note  
from an intermediate person, with assur­  
ance of his triene ship, and expresiing :!  
desire that I would test the case in his  
hands. Alsitera sortnight or more had  
passed and hearing nothing further, I  
wrote to a friend who was then in Paris,  
a citizen osPhiladelphia, requesiing him  
to inform me what was the true sittiation  
of things with respect to me. I was sure  
&quot;something was the matter. I began to

me to fall in France. They were rushing

The case, so far as it respected Mr.  
Mossnroe was, that having to getover the I  
diffitulties which the llrange conduct os  
Gouverneur Morris had thrown in thel  
wayctss of a successor, and having no autho- ;  
\ rityﬀlsrom the Ameriean government to  
ctfsispsscak oﬄcially upon any thing relating  
* to me, he found himsel obliged to pro­  
-&#x27;_&#x27;__ceed by unofficial means with individual  
ifsiinsiemhers ; for though Robespierre was  
— Overthronm, the Robespierrian members  
. of the committee of Public Sasety  
kill remained in considerable force, and  
had they found out that ÞJIr. Monroe had &quot;  
no official authority upon the case, they  
would have paid little or no regard to his  
reclamation of me. In the mean time  
my health was suﬀering exceedingly, the  
dreary prospect of winter was coming  
..on, and imprisonment was still a thing nisi  
danger.  
After the Robespierrrian members of  
the Cemmittte were removed by the expi­  
ctration&#x27;os their time of serving, Mr. Mon­  
foe reelaimed me, and I was liberated the  
4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrix ed  
in&quot; Paris the beginnig of August bes-sire.  
siAllsithat peridd of my imprisonment, at  
least, I owe not to Robespierre, but to his  
collcague in projects, George Washing,  
ton. lmmediately upon my liberation  
Mr. Monroefinvited me to his house where  
I remained more&#x27;than a yearctand an half ;  
and I speak of his aid and his friendship,  
as an open hearted man will always do in  
such a case, with respect and gratitude.  
Soon after my liberation the Conven.  
tion passed an unanimous vote to invite  
me to return to my seat among them.  
&#x27; she times were llill unsettled and danger.  
ssssizus, as well from without as from within,  
lbr the coalition was unbroken, and the  
constitution not iettled. I chose, however,  
to accept the invitation ; for as I under­  
take nothing but what l believe to be  
right, [abandon norhing that I undertake ;  
and I was willing also to shew, that, as I  
was not of a cast ofmind to be deterred  
by prospects or retPOprospects of danger,  
so neither were my principles to be weak­  
ened by missortune,-vr perverted by dis.  
  
  
  
gust.  
Bcing now once more abroad in the  
worldsil began to find that] was not the  
only one who had conceived an unl&#x27;avora­

In the year (793, or about that time,!  
Mr. &#x27;Washinsigmn as Pcesidsisscnt had (an:  
__. WYFsss-T&#x27;Wf Morris to London as his fr­  
. si ZBctfct-Qssm—ssssh&#x27;&quot; some communicatior  
  
  
with the British minitiry. To cover the  
age-ney of Msiorris it was given out, Isi  
know not by whom, that he went as an1  
agent from Robert Morris to borrow tno- .  
ney in Europe, and the report was permit. l  
]  
  
ted to pass uncontradicted. &#x27;l&#x27;lte eventss  
&#x27; l  
  
fMorria&#x27;s negociation was, that Mr.ss  
lsiammond was sent minister from England ;  
to America, and Pintkney liom&#x27; Atuerica 9  
to England, and himself minister to France.  
Iswhile Morris was minister in France he  
was not-an emissary of the British minissi  
try and the coalestsed power-s, he gave  
strong reasons to &#x27;sussizeft him of it. No  
one who saw his conduct, and heard his  
conversation, could doubt his being in  
their interest: and had he not get uﬀat  
the time he did, after hisrecasill, he would  
have been in arrellarion. Some letters of  
his had fallen into the hands of the Com­  
mittee ofPublic Salsiety, and enquiry was  
making after him.  
A great bullle has been made by Mr.  
Washington about the conduct otsiGenet in  
America ; while that of his own minister,  
Morris, in France was infinitelv more re­  
proachable. If Genet was imprudent orss  
rash, he was not treacherous ; but -Morris  
was all three. He was the enemy-of the  
French revolu-tion in every singe ofit.  
But, notwit—hstanding this conduct on the  
part of Morris, and the known proﬂigaey  
of his character, Mr. VVashington, in a  
letter he wrote to him at the time of re­  
calling him on the complaint and request  
ofthe Committee of Public Safety all&#x27;ures  
him, that though he had complied with  
that request, he ltill retained the same es.  
teem and friendship for him as before.-4  
This letter Morris was foolish enough to  
tell of; and as his own character and con.  
duc&#x27;t were notoriom, the telling ofit could  
have but one eﬀect, which was that of  
implicating the character of the writer.  
Morris still loitets in Europe, chieﬂy in  
England ; and Mr. W&#x27;ashington is still  
  
in correspondence with him ; Mr. Wash. si  
  
  
  
l_——  
  
ington dught therefore to expect, especi s  
ally since his conduct in the aﬀair of jay&#x27;s  
treaty, that France must consider Morris  
and Washington as men of the same de.  
scri tion. The chiesdisserence, however,  
etwcen the two is (for in politics there  
is none) that the one is proﬂigate enough  
to prosess an indiﬀerence about moral  
principles, and the other is prudent en­  
ough to conceal the want of them.  
About three mouths after [was at liber­  
ty, the official note of jay to Grenville on  
the sunjetctt of the capture of American  
vessels by British cruisers, appeared in the  
Amcrican papers that arrived at Paris.——  
Every thing was of:: piece. Every thing  
was mean. The same kind of character  
went to all circumstances public or private.  
Disgusted at this national degradarion, as  
well as at the particular conduct of Mr.  
Washington to me, I wrote to him (Mr.  
Washington) on the zzd of Feb. 1795,  
under cover to the then Secretary of State,  
Mr, Randolph, and entrusted the letter  
to Mr. Letombe, who was nppointe  
French consul to Philadelphia, and was on  
the point of taking his departure. When  
I supposed Mr. Letombe had sailed,-I men  
tioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as  
I was then in his house, [shewed it to  
him. He expressed a wish that I would  
recall it, which he supposed might be done,  
as he had learned that Mr. Letombe had  
not then sailed. I agreed to do so, and it  
was returned by Mr. Letombe under cover  
to Mr. Monroe.  
The letter, however, will now reach  
Mr. Washington publicly in the course of  
this work.  
  
-- . no.  
  
  
About the month of September follow. &quot;  
ing, I had a severe relapse, which gave  
occasion to the report of my death. 1 had  
felt it coming on &amp; considerable time be­  
fore, which occasioned me to hasten the  
work I had then in hand, the &quot; Sesscond  
part of the Age of Reason.&quot; Whenþl had  
finished that work, I bestowed another  
letter on Mr. Waihington, Which .I sent  
under cover to Mr. Benjamin-Franklin  
Bachess, of Philadelphia. &#x27;l&#x27;he letter is as

I am not retuting or contradicsiting the  
salshood of this publication, for it is (of.  
ficiently notorious ; neither am I censur  
ing the writer ; on the contrary I thank  
him for the explanation he has incautious  
ly git en of the principles of the Washing­  
ton faction. lnstgnisrcant, however, as  
the piece is, it was capable of having  
had some ill eﬀect, had it arrived iisi  
France during my imprisonment and in  
the time of Robessiiierre ; and I am not  
unchztritable in supposing that this was  
the intention of the writer.* -  
I have now done with Mr. Vtssashing­  
ton on the score of private aﬀairs. It  
would have been sar more agreeable to  
me, had his conduct been such as not to  
have merited these reproasihes. Errors  
or caprices of the te tper can be pardoned  
and forgotten ; but a cool deliberate crime  
of the heart, such as Mr. \&#x27;\ ashington i—  
capable ofacsssiting, is not to be washed  
away. I now proceed to other matter.  
After ]ay&#x27;s note to Grenville arrived  
in Paris srom America, the character of  
every thing that was to follow might be  
easily sorssissen ; and it was upon this anci­  
cipation that my letter of February zzd  
was sounded. The event has proud,  
that I was not mistaken, except that it  
has been much worse than I-expected.  
It would nctturaily occur to Mr. Wash.  
ington, that the secrecy of ]ctay&#x27;s misiion  
to England, where there was already at;  
American minister, could not but createﬂ  
  
  
some suspicion in the French government ;  
especially as the conduct of Morris had  
been nororious, and the intimacy of Mr.  
Washingron with Morris was known.  
The character which Mr. Washington  
has attempted to act in the world, is a  
sort of nomdescribable, cameleon coloureti  
thing, called prudence. It is, in many}  
cases, a substitute sor principle, and is so  
nearly alied&#x27;to hypocrisy, that it easily  
slides into it. I-Iis genius for prudence  
furnished him in this instadce with an ex­  
peciient, that served, as is the natural and  
general character of all exr-cdients, tt-si  
diminish the em&#x27;o-irrassments ofrhe moment  
and multiply them afterwards ; for he au­  
thorised it to be made known to the  
French government, as a confidential mat­  
ter (Mr. \Vashington should recollect that  
I was a member of the convention, and had  
the means of knowing what I here state)  
he authorised it, I say, to be made krtown  
and that for the purpose of preventing any  
uneasiness to France on the score of Mr.  
]ay&#x27;s misston to England, that the ohjee&#x27;t  
of that million, and of Mr. ]ay&#x27;s aurhori­  
tiy, was restrisiiied to that of demanding  
the surrender of the western pc-sts and in.  
demnification for the cargoes captured in  
American vessels. Mr. Washington knows  
that this was untrue ; and knowing this,  
he had good reason to himself for refu.  
sing to surnish the house of representatives  
with copies of the instructions given to  
]ay ; as he might suspect, among other  
things, that he should also be called upon  
for COplBS osinslructions given to other

ministers, and that in the contradiction of  
instructions his want ofintegritv would  
be detectcd. Mr. Washington rhay now,  
perhaps, learn, when it is too late, to be  
ot&#x27;any use to him, that a man, will pass  
better through the worid with a thousand  
oPen errors upon his&#x27;back, than in lacing  
detected in ONE {ly salshuotl. When one  
is detecicd, a thousand are suspetssted. *  
The first account that arrived in Paris  
of a treaty being negociated by Mr. jay  
(sor nohody suspected any) came in an;  
English news-Paper,} which announced that ct  
a treaty aﬀEwsi-v: and (lesissz-ve had&#x27;been  
concluded between the United States of  
Amcrica and England. This was imzntsi  
diatel&#x27;y deni&#x27;erlihyevery :}tnetican in Paris,  
as an impossible thing ; and though it  
was disnelieved by the French, it imprintct  
ed a suspicion that some underhmded bu- f  
liness was going forwards-5 At length;  
the treaty itselsarrived, and every well.}  
a edesil American blnshed with shame. ]  
It is curious to observchow the appear. \
ance oscharacter will change, whiltt the  
rout that produces them remains the same.  
The Washington administration having  
waded through the slough ofnegociation,  
and whilst it amused France with professi­  
ons osfriendship, contrived to injure her,  
immediately throws oﬀ the hypocrite, and ]  
assusning the swaggetising air oi&#x27;a bravadoﬂ  
The party papers of that imbecile admi­  
niiltra&#x27;ion were on this occasion filled with ct  
p&#x27;aragraphs about Sorverer&#x27;g/zty. A paltroonl  
nay boast of his sovereign right to let}  
air-other isiit-lss; him, and this is the only}  
lss&#x27;sstind of sotereignty lhewn in the treaty}  
with England. But these dashing parasi  
granhs, as Timoihy Pickcring well knows,  
were&#x27;intended for France ; without whose  
aﬂiuance in men, money and ships, Mn  
Washington would have cut but a poor  
figure in the American war. But of his  
military talents I shall speak hercalter. !  
  
  
  
I mean not to enter into any dilcuissiion  
of any articie of jay&#x27;s treaty: I shall  
speak only upon the whole of it. It is  
  
attempted to be justified on the ground  
  
osits not being a violation of any article  
  
or artieles of the treaty prsisiexisting with ss  
  
France. But the sovereign right of exsi  
planation does not lie with George VVash- ss  
  
ington and his man Tiznothy; France,  
on her part, has, at least, an equal right ;  
and when nations dispute, it is not so much  
about words as about things.  
A man, such as the works calls a shar­  
  
per, and versed, as jay must he supposed to ss  
  
ne, in the qnibbles of the law, may find a  
way to enter into engagements, and make  
bargains in such a manner as to cheat some  
Other party, with-Out thatparty being able  
as the phrase is, to take the law of him.  
This often happens in the cahalistical cir­  
cle of what is called law. But when this  
is attempted to be acted on the national  
scale oftreaties, it is too despicahle to be  
defended-, or to be permitted to wist.-—  
Yet this is the trick upon which Jay&#x27;s  
treaty is founded, so far as it has relation  
to the treaty preexisting with France. It  
is a counteutteaty to that treaty, and  
pervert; all the great articies of that trca

the Other, and there terminate. It was.  
calculated to remove from the mind of the  
committte all suspicion upon ]ay&#x27;s misiion  
-toEngland, and, in this point of view,  
-it was suited to the circumfiances of the  
moment then pa-siing; but as the event of  
-that mission has proved the letter to be hy­  
pocritical, it serves no other purpose of  
the present moment than to shew that the  
writer is noc to be credited. Two cir­  
cnmsiances served to make the reading of  
-the letter necessary in the Convention.  
The one was, that those who succeeded  
-on the sssall of Robespierre, found it most  
proper to act with publicity ; the other,  
to extinguish the suspicions which the  
strange conduct of Morria had occasioned  
in France.  
  
When the BriLish treaty, and the ratisi.  
ration of it by Mr Washington, was  
known-inFrance, all further declarations  
from him ok-his good difposition, at an ally  
and a—lriend passed for so many cyphers;  
but still it appeared necessary to him to  
keep up the iarce of declarations. ctIt isj  
ﬂipulated in the British treaty, that com. l  
miﬂioners are toreport at the end of two !  
yearaon the case of nmtml ships making ]  
cum-al propertyss In the mean time nen:  
tral ships do not make neutral property,  
according tothe British treaty, and they  
do,&quot; according to the French treaty. The,  
preservation, therefore, ofthe French trea­  
ty became of great importance to England,  
as by that means she can employ Ameri- \
can ships as carricrs, whilst the same ad.  
vantage is denied to France. Whether  
the French treaty could exist as a matter  
of right after this clandestine perversion  
of it, could-not but give some apprehensi­  
ons to the partizans of the British treaty,  
and it became necessary to them to make  
up, by fine words what was wanting in  
  
good actions. _  
  
  
  
An opportunity offered to that purpose.  
The Convention, on the public reception  
of Mr. Montoe, ordered the American  
Rag and the French ﬂag to be displayed  
anitedly in the hall of the Convention.  
Mr. Monroe made a present of an Ameri­  
can ﬂag for the purpose. The Conventi.  
on returned this compliment by sending  
a French ﬂag to Amorica, to be presented  
by their minister, Mr. Adet, to the Ame­  
rican government. ] his resolution pas.  
sed long before Jay s treaty was know orss  
suspected; it passed in the days of confi­  
dence ; but the Bag was not presented by  
Mr. Adet till several mmths after the,  
treaty had been ratiiied. Mr. Washing.  
ton made this the occasion of saying some  
fine things to the French minister, and the  
better to get himself into tune to do this,  
he began by saying the finest thing: of

them so much into notice it is fair to .ex- &#x27;

A stranger might be led to suppose from  
the egotisrn with which Mr. Washsiing­  
ton speaks, that himself, and himself only,  
had generated, conducted, compleated, j  
and eﬂablished the revolution: In fine,.  
that it was all his own doing. sssi  
In the first place, as to the political  
part, he had no share in it ; and therefore  
the whole ofthis is out of the question,  
with respect to him. There remains then  
only the military— part, and it would have  
been prudent in Mr. Washington not to  
have awakened enquiry upon that subject.  
Fame then was cheap ;, he enjoyed it  
cheaply ; and nobedy was disposed to  
take away the laurels, &quot;that, whether they i  
were acquired or not, had been given. 1,

But when we speak of military charac­  
ter, something more is to be understood  
than constancy; and something more  
ought to be understood than the Fabian  
system of doing nothing. The nothing  
part can be done by any body. Old  
Mrs. Thompson, the house-keeper of  
head-quarters (who threatened to make!  
the sun and the wind shine through Ri­  
vington of New-York) could have done  
it as well as Mr. Washington. De­  
borah wouldhave been as &#x27; good as Ba.

Mr. Washington had the norninal rank  
ol Commander in chief ; but he was not  
so in fact. He had in reality only a se.  
perate command. He had no controul  
over, or direction of, the army to the  
northward, under Gates, that captured  
Burgoyne, nor of that to the south, under  
Green, that recovered the southern States.  
The nominal rank, sihowever, of Com­  
mander in chief, served to throw upon  
him the lustre of those actions, and to

Lthe command of the army. The hope,  
i however,-of better times, the news of the  
si alliance with France, and the unwilling.  
ness of shewing discontent, disiipated the  
matter.

I  
  
Nothing was done in the campaign of  
1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where  
lGen. Washington commanded, except the  
; taking Stony Point by Gen Wayne. The  
TSotrtht-rn States in the usiean time were  
, over run by the enemy. They were as.  
ss terwards recovered by Gen. Greene, who  
ss had in a very great measure created the at.  
my that accomplished that recovely. In  
all this Gen. Washington had no share.  
The l&#x27;eoian sy {lem of war, sollo ved by  
him, began now to unfold itself with all :  
its evils, for what is Fabi an war without  
Fabian means to support it.  
The finances of Congress, depending  
wholly on emisiions os paper money, were  
exhausted. Its eredit was gone. &#x27;Ihe  
continental treasury was not able to pay  
the eitpence of a brigade of waggons to  
transport the necessaryb stores to the army,  
and yet the sole object, the establishment  
of the revolution, was a thing of remote  
distance. The timeI am now speaking os  
is the latter end osthe year 1780.  
  
l  
l  
!  
l  
  
  
In this fituation osthings it was found  
not only eXpedient but absolutely necessa­  
ry for Congress to state the whole case to  
its ally. I knew more of the matter (be­  
fore it came into Congress or was known  
to Grn. Washingtnn) of its progress, and  
its issue, than I chose to state in this let.  
ter. Col. John Laurens was sent to France  
as envoy extraordinary on this occasion,  
and by : private agreement between him  
and me &#x27;I accompanied him. We szziled  
srom Bosion in the Alliance srigate, &#x27;Fcb.  
ttth, 1781. France had already done  
much in acccepting and paying bills drawn  
  
by Congress. She was ro.v called upon.  
  
to do more. The event ot Col. Laurensi&#x27;s  
  
million, with the aid of the venerahle mi. \
nistcr, Franklm, was, thatFr-ance gavein .  
  
money, as a present, fix millions oflivres,  
and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed  
to send a fleet of not less than thirty sail  
of the line, at herssown essXpenCP, as an aid  
to Amcrica. Col. Laurens and myself  
  
returned from Brest the 1st0s ]une sol- &#x27;  
  
lowing, taking with us two millions and  
an half of livres .(ttpwards of one hundred  
  
thousand pounds sterling) os the money -  
  
given, and convoying two shsips with  
stores.  
  
We arrived at Bostc-n the 2&quot;5th Angnst -  
  
following, De Grasi&#x27;c arrived with the  
  
French ﬂeet in the Ch-Zsapeak at the same  
  
time. and was afterwardssijnined by that  
of Barras, making 3t&#x27;sailos the line. The  
money was transpsiorted in waggons from  
jBoston to the bank at Phiiadelphja, of  
{which Nlr. Thomas W&#x27;illing, who has

unjuﬄy given tf) Mr. Washmgcom ma  
merit in that aﬀais was no more: them tlmcssss  
ofany Other Anterican officer.  
I have had, and siiii have, as WCh Pride  
in the American revolution as any man, or  
as Mr. Washington has a right to have ;  
but that pride has never made me terge,,  
su] from whence the great aid came that  
compleated the business. Forcign zjdsi  
(that of France) was calculated Upon at  
the commencement of the revolution. 1;  
is on.-: of the subjects treated of in the  
pamphlet Common Sensc, but as a mau- :  
that could not be hoped for, unless indsi  
endence was declared.­  
  
  
  
it is as well the ingratitude as the  
pusilanimizy of Mr. Wathington and the  
Washington faction, that has brought up.  
on Amcrica the loss of character she now  
suﬀers in the world, and the numerous  
eviis her commerce has undergone and to  
which it is yet exposed. The British mi.  
ninistry soon found out what sort osmm  
they had to deal with, and they deal:  
with them accordingly ; and if further ex.  
planation was wanting, it has been sully  
given since in the snivelling address of  
the New-York Chamber of Commerce to  
the Prelident, and in that of sundry mer.  
chants of Philadelphia, which was not  
much better.  
When the revolution of Ame.ica was  
finally established by the termination of  
the war, the world gave her credit so:  
great character; and the had norhing to  
do but to stand firm upon that ground.­  
The British ministty had their hands too  
full oftrouhle to have provoked unneces.  
sarily a rupture with her, had she shewn  
a preper resolution to defend her rights.  
But encouraged as they were by the  
submissive character of her executive ad.  
minisiration, they preceeded from insult to  
insulc, till none more were left to be oﬀer.  
ed. The proposals made by Sweden and  
Denmark to the American administration,  
were disregarded. I know not if so much  
as an answer has been returned to them.  
The minister plenipotentiary (as some o  
  
{the British prints called him) Mr. jay was  
  
sent on a pilgrimage to London, to make  
all up by penance and petition. In the  
mean time the lengthy and drowsy writer  
of the pieces signed Camilius, held himself  
in reserve to vindicate every thing; and  
to sound, in America, the tociin of terror  
upon the inexhaustible resources of Eng.  
land. Her resources says he are greater  
than-all the other powers. This man is  
  
ss so intoxicated with fear and finance, that  
? he knows not the diﬀerence between plus  
si and minus ; between an hundred pounds in  
: hand, and an hundred &#x27;pounds worse than  
  
nothing..  
  
4 A  
  
  
  
The commerce of Ametica, so far as If  
had been established by all the treatits  
that had been formed prior to that by ]a)&#x27;,  
was free, and the priticisioles upon which it  
was established Were good. That ground  
ought never to have been departed from.  
It was the justifiable ground oftight, and  
no temporary difficulties ought to have in­  
duced an abandonment of it. Which cas-:  
is now otherwise. The ground, the scene,  
the pretenstons, the every thing are chang­  
ed. The commerce of Anietica is, by  
jay&#x27;s treaty, put under soreign dominiou.  
The sea is not free for her. Her right to  
navigate it is reduced to the rightosescap­  
ing; ther is, untii some ship of England trss  
France sistosia her vesiesiis and carries them  
into Po&quot;. Every articie os Atnetican pre­  
duce, whether from the sea or the land­  
fish, ficsh, vegetable or manuf-sstctuﬄa &quot;­  
by jay&#x27;s treaty, made either contrabm}  
or seizable. . Nothing is exempt. Inasi  
other treaties of commerce, the arttc&#x27;e  
which enumerates the contraban-zi articies.  
such as fire-arms, gan-POWdCs, &amp;c. is so&#x27;­  
lowed&#x27;by another article, which enume­  
rates the articlcs not contra&#x27;oanj; but it  
is not so in ]ay&#x27;s treaty. There is no 64­  
tctmpzing ar-tzcles, Its place is supplico hz&#x27;  
the article sor seizing and carrying Is!&quot;

thing. There never was such a base a&#x27;sh­

for a while, by enemies a3 by friends,  
for prudence, moderation and impar­  
tiality. It is laughable to hear Mr.  
Washington talk of his sympathetic  
feelii-gs, who has always been re­  
marked, even Among his friends, for  
not having any.&quot;  
The fame of Washington asa mili­

L &quot;As to the pompo&#x27;us enconiums he  
  
so liberally pays to himself on the  
score of the American revolution, the  
reality of them may be questioned,  
and since he has forced them so much  
into notice it is fair to examine his  
pretentions.  
&quot;A stranger might bo led to suppose,  
from tho egotism with which Mr.  
Washington speaks, that himself, and  
himself onjy, had generated, con­  
ducted, completed and established  
the Revolution in fine, that it was  
all his own doing.  
ikIn the first place, as to the politi­  
cal part, he had no share in it: and,  
  
therefore, tho whole of that is out of  
  
the question with respect to- him.  
  
There remains, then, only the milita  
  
ry part, and it would have been pru­  
dent in Mr. Washington not to have  
awakened inquiry upon that subject.  
Fame then was cheap ; he enjoyed it  
cheaply ; no one was disposed to take  
away the laurels that, whether they  
were acquired or not, had been given.

icter which Mr. Washington has attempted to act in the

hing called prudence. It is in many cases a surstitute  
or principle and is so nearly allled to hypoerlsy that it  
sasily slides into it. Mr. Washington will learn that it is  
better for a man to pass through the world with a thou  
sand open errors upon his back than in being detected in  
  
  
one sly falachood. When one is detected, a thousand  
are suspected.&quot; Thls seems to be taken out of The  
Faresdronper of yesterday. Washington is accused of  
almost the identieal thing put against Blaine, of a foreign  
intrigue. &quot;The first announcement,&quot; says Paine, &quot;of  
the treaty was immedlately denied by every American in  
Paris as an impossible thing, and though it was disbe-  
ed by the French it imprinted a suspicion that some  
underhand business was going forward. At last the  
itself arrived and every well affected American  
blushed with shame. In what fraudulent light must Mr.

during seasons of emergency.  
A SCRAP OF HISTORY.  
  
Americans have learned to regard the  
character of Washington with such ven­  
eration and his services to the cause of  
independence of such transcendent value  
that they can scarcely realize that he  
had personal enemies . and &#x27; detractors.  
The greatest and best of men have not  
escaped these, and no doubt Washing­  
ton had his share. A current publica­  
tion is in evidence on this point. The  
third volume of the writings of Thomas  
Paine, recently issued, contains a letter  
to Washington the spirit of which may  
be judged by the following extracts:  
As censure is but awkwardly softened by  
apology, I shall offer you no apology for  
this letter. The eventtul crisis to which  
yonr double politics have conuueted the af­  
fairs of your country requires an investiga­

it not been tor the aid received from France
