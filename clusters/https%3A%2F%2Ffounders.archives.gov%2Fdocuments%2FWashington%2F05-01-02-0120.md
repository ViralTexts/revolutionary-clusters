Sir,  
Mount Vernon Decr 4th 1788.  
  
I have been favored with the receipt of your letter dated the 1st day of July; and have to express my thanks for the three additional volumes of the Annals which have also come safely to hand.  
The more I am acquainted with agricultural affairs the better I am pleased with them. Insomuch that I can no where find so great satisfaction, as in those innocent &amp; useful pursuits. In indulging these feelings, I am led to reflect how much more delightful to an undebauched mind is the task of making improvements on the earth; than all the vain glory which can be acquired from ravaging it, by the most uninterrupted career of  
  
conquests. The design of this observation is only to shew how much as a member of human society, I feel myself obliged by your labours to render respectable and advantageous an employment, which is more congenial to the natural dispositions of mankind than any other.  
I am also much indebted to you for the enquiries you was so kind as to make respecting the threshing machines. Notwithstanding I am pretty well convinced from your account that the new invented Scotch Machine is of superior merit to Winlaws; yet I think to wait a little longer before I procure one. In the intermediate time, I am not insensible to your obliging offers of executing this or any other Commission for me; and shall take the liberty to avail myself of them, as occasions may require.  
I would willingly have sent you a lock of the wool of my sheep, agreeably to your desire, but it is all wrought into cloth, and I must therefore defer it until after the next shearing. You may expect it by some future conveyance. A Manufacturer from Leeds, who was lately here, judges it to be of about the same quality with the English wool in general—though there is always a great difference in the fineness of different parts of the same fleece. I cannot help thinking that encreasing &amp; improving our breed of sheep would be one of the most profitable speculations we could undertake; especially in this part of the Continent, where we have so little winter that they require either no dry fodder, or next to none; and where we are sufficiently distant from the frontiers not to be troubled with wolves or other wild vermen which prevent the Inhabitants there from keeping flocks. Though we do not feed our sheep upon leaves, as you mention they do in some parts of France; yet we cannot want for pastures enough suitable for them. I am at a loss therefore to account for the disproportion between their value &amp; that of black cattle; as well as for our not augmenting the number. So persuaded am I of the practicability &amp; advantage of it, that I have raised near 200 lambs upon my farm this year. I am glad to find that you are likely to succeed in propagating the Spanish breed of Sheep in England, and that the wool does not degenerate. For the multiplication of useful animals is a common blessing to mankind. I have a prospect of introducing into this Country a very excellent race of animals also, by means of  
  
the liberality of the King of Spain. One of the Jacks which he was pleased to present to me (the other perished at Sea) is about 15 hands high, his body &amp; Limbs very large in proportion to his height; &amp; the Mules which I have had from him appear to be extremely well formed for Service. I have likewise a Jack &amp; two Jennets from Malta, of a very good size, which the Marquis de la Fayette sent to me. The Spanish Jack seems calculated to breed for heavy, slow draught; and the others for the Saddle or lighter carriages. From these, all together, I hope to secure a race of extraordinary goodness, which will stock the Country. Their longevity &amp; cheap keeping will be circumstances much in their favor. I am convinced from the little experiments I have made with the ordinary Mules, (which perform as much labour, with vastly less feeding than horses) that those of a superior quality will be the best cattle we can employ for the harness. And, indeed, in a few years, I intend to drive no other in my carriage: having appropriated for the sole purpose of breeding them, upwards of 20 of my best Mares.  
Since I wrote to you formerly respecting the objection made by my labourers to the weight of the Ploughs; I have had sufficient experience to overcome the ill-founded prejudice, and find them answer the purpose exceedingly well. I have been laying out my farm into fields of nearly the same dimensions, and assigning crops to each until the year 1795—The building of a Brick Barn has occupied much of my attention this Summer. It is constructed somewhat according to the plan you had the goodness to send me: but with some additions. It is now, I believe, the largest and most convenient one in this Country.  
Our seasons in this Country (or at least in this part of it) have been so much in the two opposite extremes of dry and wet for the two summers past that many of my experiments have failed to give a satisfactory result: or I would have done myself the pleasure of transmitting it to you. In the first part of the last Summer, the rains prevailed beyond what has been known in the memory of man; yet the Crops in most parts of the United States are good. They were much injured, however, in those places on my farm, where the soil is mixed with clay &amp; so stiff as to be liable to retain the moisture. I planted a large quantity of Potatoes, of which only those that were put in as late as the end  
  
of June, have produced tolerably well. I am notwithstanding more &amp; more convinced of the prodigious usefulness of this root and that it is very little, if any thing of an exhauster. I have a high opinion also of Carrots. The same unfavorableness of the Season has rendered it unimportant to give a detail of my experiments this year in flax, though I had sowed 25 bushels of the seed. In some spots it has yielded well, in others very indifferently. Much injured by weeds &amp; lodjers.  
As to what you suggest at the close of your letter, respecting the publication of extracts from my corrispondence in your Annals, I hardly know what to say. I certainly highly approve the judicious execution of your well-conceived project of throwing light on a subject, which may be more conducive than almost any other to the happiness of mankind. On the one hand, it seems scarcely generous or proper that any farmer, who receives benefit from the facts contained in such publications, should withhold his mite of information from the general stock. On the other hand, I am affraid it might be imputed to me as a piece of ostentation, if my name should appear in the work. And surely it would not be discreet for me to run the hazard of incurring this imputation; unless some good might probably result to Society, as some kind of compensation for it. Of this I am not a judge—I can only say for myself, that I have endeavoured in a state of tranquil retirement to keep my self as much from the eye of the world as I possibly could. I have studiously avoided, as much as was in my power, to give any cause for ill-natured or impertinent comments on my conduct: and I should be very unhappy to have anything done on my behalf (however distant in itself from impropriety) which should give occasion for one officious tongue to use my name with indelicacy. For I wish most devoutly to glide silently and unnoticed through the remainder of life. This is my heart felt wish; and these are my undisguised feelings. After having submitted them confidentially to you, I have such a reliance upon your prudence, as to leave it with you to do what you think, upon a full consideration of the matter shall be wisest &amp; best. I am with very great regard and esteem Sir Your Most Obedt and obliged Hble Servt

I believe, the largeft and wind conveni­

IR:  
  
[ have been favored with the receipt of your let-  
terdated the first day of July ; and have to express  
imy thanks for the three additional volumes of the  
Annals, which have also come safely to hand.  
  
The more I am acquainted with agricultural af-  
fairs, the better [ am pleased with them ; insomuch,  
that I can no where find so great satisfaction as  
in those innocent and useful pursuits. In indul-  
ging these feelings, I am led to reflect how much  
  
myself obliged by your labors to render tes.  
pectable aad advantageous, an employment which  
is more congenial to the natural dispositions of  
mankind than any other.  
  
[ am also much indebted to you, for the inqui-  
ries you were sokind as to make respecting the  
thrashing machines. Notwithstanding I am pret-  
ty well convinced from your account, that the  
new-invented Scotch machine is of superior merit to  
W inlaw’s, yet I think to wait a little longer before  
I procure one, In the intermediate time, I am  
not insensible to your obliging oflers of executing  
this, or any other commission for me; and’ shall  
take the liberty to avail myself of them as occa.  
sions may require.  
  
1 would willingly have sent you a lock of the  
wool of my sheep, agreeably to your desire, but it  
is all wrought into cloth, and I must therefore de-  
fer it until after the next shearing. You may ex.  
pect it by some future conveyance. A manufac.  
turer from Leeds, who was lately here, judyes jt  
to be of about tbe eame quality with the English  
wool in general—through there is always a great  
difference in the fineness of different parts of&#x27; the  
same fleece, I cannot help thinking that increas.  
ing and improving our breed of sheep, would be one  
  
&#x27;of the most profitable speculations we could under-  
  
take 5 especially in this part of the continent, where  
we have so little winter, that they require eitherno  
dry fodder, or next to none; and where we are sul-  
ficiently distant from the frontiers, not to be trov-  
bled with wolves or other wild vermin, which pre-  
vént the inhabitants there from keeping flocks.  
Though we do not feed our sheep upon leaves, as  
you mention they do in some parts of France, yet  
ve cannot want for pastures enough suitable (or  
them. [am ata loss, therefore, to account for the  
disproportion between their value and that ol  
black cattle; as well as for our not augmenting  
the number. So persuaded am I of the practica-  
bility and advantage of it, that I have raised near  
200 lambs upon my farm this year. Iam gladto  
find that you are likely to succeed in propagating  
the Spanish breed of sheep in England, and that  
the wool does not degenerate: for the multiplica-  
tion of useful animals is a common blessing 1  
mankind, Ihave a prospect of introducing into  
this country a very excellent race of animals als  
by means of the liberality of the King of Spa.  
One of the jacks which he was pleased to present  
to me (the other perished at sea ) is about  
hands high, his body and limbs very large in pr  
portion to his height; and the mules which I have  
had from him, appear to be extremely well formed  
for service. I have likewise a jack and two Jet  
netts from Malta, of a very good size, which the  
Marquis de la Fayette sentto me. The Spao  
jack seems calculated to breed for heavy. —  
draught; and the others for the saddle, or lighté  
carriages. rom these, altogether, I hope ee  
cure a race of extraordinary goodness, which W  
stock the country. ‘Their longevity and chet?

Mt. Vernon, December 4, 1788.  
Sir :—I have been favored with the receipt of your let-  
ter dated the first day of July ; and have to express my  
thanks for the three additional volumes of the Annals,  
which have also come safely to hand.  
  
The more I am acquainted with agricultural affairs,  
the better I am pleased with them ; insomuch, that I can  
no where find so great satisfaction as in those innocent  
and usefal pursuits. In indulging these feelings, 1 am  
led to reflect how much more delightful to an undebauched  
mind is the task of making improvements on the earth,.  
than all the vain glory which he can acquire from ravag-  
ing it, by the most uninterrupted career of conquests.  
The design of this observation is only to shew how much,  
as a member of human society, I feel myself obliged by  
your labors to render respectable and advantageous, an  
employment which is more congenial to the natural dis-  
positions of mankind than any other. * * *  
  
I would willingly have sent you a lock of the wool of  
my sheep, agreeably to your desire, but it is all wrought  
into cloth, and I must therefore defer it until after the  
next shearing. You may expect it by some future con-  
veyance. A manufacturer from Leeds who was lately  
here, judges it to be about the same quality with the  
English wool in genera]—though there is always a great  
difference in the fineness of different parts of the same  
fleece. I cannot help thinking that increasing and im.  
proving our breed of sheep, would be one of the most  
profitable speculations we could undertake ;, ially  
this part of the continent, where we have so-li  
that they require either no dry fodder,  
and where we are sufficiently distant {  
not to be troubled with the wolves or wild vermin,  
which prevent the inhabitants there from keeping flocks.  
Though we do not feed ourssheep upon leaves, as you  
mentioned they do in some of nee, yet we can-.  
not want for pastures enough suitable forthem. Iam at  
a loss, therefore, to account for the disproportion between  
their value and that of black cattle ; as well as for our  
not augmenting the number. So.persuaded am I of the  
practicability and advantage of it, that I have raised near  
200 lambs upon my farm this year. I am glad to find  
that i are likely to succeed in, propagating the Spanish  
  
of sheep in England, and that the wool does not  
degenerate : forthe multiplication of useful animals is a  
common blessing to mankind. I have a prospect of in.  
trodficing into this country a very excellent race of ani.  
mals also, by means of the liberality of the King of  
Spain. One of the Jacks which he was pleased to pre.  
sent to me (the other perished at sea) is about 15 hands  
high, his body and limbs very large in p ion to his  
height; and the mules which I have had him, ap-  
pear to be extremely well formed for service. I have  
likewise a jack and two jennets frem Malta, of a very  
size, which the Marquis de la Fayette sent to me.  
he Spanish jack seems calculated to breed for heavy  
slow draught ; and the others for the saddle, or other  
lighter carriages. From these, altogether, I hope to se.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
cure a race of extraordinary goodness, which will stock  
the country. Their longevity and cheap keeping will be

As to what you suggest atthe close of yeur letter, res-  
pecting the publication of extracts from my correspon-  
dence, in your Annals, I hardly know what to say. I  
certainly highly approve the judicious execution of your  
well.conceived project of throwing light on a subject.  
which may be more conductive than almost any other to  
the happiness of mankind. On the one hand, it seems  
scarcely generous or proper, than any farmer who receives  
benefit from the facts contained in such publications,  
should withhold his mite of information from the gener-  
al stock. On the other hand, I am afraid it might be im.

some kind of compensation for it. Of this I am not a

in a state of tranquil retirement to keep myself as much  
from the eye of the world as I possibly could. I have  
studiously avoided, as much as was inmy power, to give  
any cause for ill-natured or impertinent comments on my  
conduct: and I should be very unhappy to have any thing  
done on my behalf (however distant in itself from impro-  
priety,) which showd give occasion for ene officious  
tongue to use my name with indelicacy. For I wish  
most devoutly to glide silently and unnoticed through the  
remainder of life. Thisis my heart-felt wish; and these  
are my undisguised feelings After having submitted  
them confidently to you, I have such a reliance upon your  
prudence, as to leave it with you to do what you think,  
upon a full consideration of the matter, shall be wisest  
and best, I am with very great regard and esteem, sir,  
  
Your most obedient and obliged humble servant,

In the same letter, he enters into a particular description of the price of  
products. ‘‘ Wheat,” he says, ‘“‘for the last four years has been worth four  
shillings sterling by the bushel; rye,;two shillings and fourpence ; oats, one  
shilling and sixpence,” and gives the price of a great variety of other articles,  
To Mr. Young, December 4th, 1788, he says:  
  
“T cannot help thinking, that ry our breed of sheep would be one of the  
most profitable speculations we could undertake. Though we do not feed them  
on leaves, as you say they do in some parts of France, yet we cannot want for  
pasture enough suitable for them. I am glad to find you are likely to succeed in  
propagating the Spanish breed of sheep in England, and that the wool does not  
degenerate, for the multiplication of useful animals is a common blessing to man-  
kind.”’  
  
Again he says:  
  
“T have a prospect of introducing into this country a very excellent race of  
animals also, by means of the liberality of the King of Spain. One of the jacks  
he was pleased to send me is about fifteen hands high, his body and limbs very  
large in proportion to his height; and the mules I have had from him appear to  
be extremely well formed for business. I have likewise a jack and two jennets  
from Malta, of a good size, which the Marquis de La Fayette sent me. From these  
I hope to secure a race of extraordinary goodness, which will stock the country.  
Their longevity and cheap keeping will be circumstances much in their favor. I  
am convinced from the little experiments I have made with ordinary mules, which

“*T cannot help thinking that increasing and improving our  
breed of sheep would be one of the most profitable specu-  
lations we could undertake; * * * so persuaded am  
I of the practicability and advantage of it, that 1 have  
raised nearly two hundred lambs upon my farm this year.  
I am glad to find that you are likely to succeed in propa-  
gating the Spanish breed of sheep in England, and that  
the wool does not degenerate: for the multiplication of  
useful animals is a common blessing to mankind. I have  
a prospect of introducing into this country a very excel-  
lent race of animals also, by means of the liberality of  
the King of Spain. * * I have likewise a jack and two  
jennetts from Malta, of a very good size, which the  
Marquis de la Fayette sent me. The Spanish jack seems  
calculated to breed for heavy, slow draught; and the  
others for the saddle or lighter carriages. * * * I[  
am convinced from the little experiments I have made  
with the ordinary mules, which perform as much labor,  
with vastly less feeding than horses, that those of a su-  
perior quality will be the best cattle we can employ for  
the harness; and indeed in a few years I intend to drive  
no other in my carriage, having appropriated for the sole  
purpose of breeding them, upwards of twenty of my best  
mares.”

&quot;The more I am acquainted with agricultural  
affairs,&quot; he writes under date Dec, 4 1788,  
&quot;the better I am pleased with them: insomuch  
that I can nowhere find so great satisfaction  
as in those innocent and useful pursuits. In  
indulging these feelings, I am led to reflect  
how much more delightful to an undebanched  
mind is the task of making improvements on  
the earth than all the vainglory which can be  
acquired from ravaging it by the most uninter­  
rupted career of conquests.&quot; I cannot  
help thinking that increasing and improving  
our breed of sheep would be one of the most  
profitable speculations we could undertake;  
especially in this part of the continent, where  
we have so little winter that they require either  
no dry fodder, or next to none, and where we  
an tded ee  ee  
to be troubled with wolves or other wild ver­  
min, which prevent the inhabitants there  
from keening flocksato this thave a pro;  
of introducing into this country a very  
excellent race of animals, also by means of the  
liberality of the King of Snain. One of the  
tacks which he was pleased to present to me  
tthe other perished at sear is about 15 hands  
high, his body and limbs very large in propor­  
tion to his height, and the mules which I have  
had from him appear to be extremely well  
formed for service. I am convinced  
from the experiments I have made with or­  
dinary mules twhich berform as much labor,  
with vastly less feeding than horses) that those  
of a superior quality will be the best cattle we  
can employ for the harness; and in a few vears  
I intend to drive no other in my carriage, hav­  
ing appropriated for the sole purpose of breed­  
ing them tpward of twenty of my best mares.

wolves or other wild vermin, which prevent  
the inhabitants there from keeping flocks.  
I have a prospect of Introducing Into  
this country a very excellent race of ani­

the King of Spain. One of the iacks which  
he was pleased to present to me (the other

vinced from the experiments I have made  
with ordinary mules (which perform as  
much labor, with vastly less feeding than  
horses) that those of a superior quality will  
be the best cattle we can employ for the  
harness; and in a few years I Intend to  
drive no other in my carriage, having ap­  
propriated for the sole purpose of breeding  
them upward of twenty of my best mares.
