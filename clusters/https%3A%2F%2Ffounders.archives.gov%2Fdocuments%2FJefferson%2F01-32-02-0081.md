Your favor of Aug. 26. has been duly recieved and is entitled to my thankfulness for the personal considerations you are pleased to express in it. how far the measures proposed might have the expected effect, you can best judge. however in the great exercise of right in which the citizens of America are about to act, I have on mature consideration seen that it is my duty to be passive. the interests which they have at stake are entitled to their whole attention, unbiassed by personal esteem or local considerations: and I am far from the presumption of considering myself as equal to the awful duties of the first magistracy of this country. that there should be differences of opinion among our fellow citizens is to be expected always. men who think freely &amp; have the right of expressing their thoughts will differ. it is true that these differences have of late been artificially increased. but they are now again subsiding to their natural level, and all will soon come right, if no acts of violence intervene. the great question which divides our citizens is whether it is safest that a preponderance of power should be lodged with the monarchical or the republican branch of our government? temporary panics may produce advocates for the former opinion even in this country; but the opinion will be as shortlived as the panic with the great mass of our fellow citizens. there is one circumstance which will always bring them to right: a preponderance of the executive over the legislative branch cannot be maintained but by immense patronage, by multiplying offices, making them very lucrative, by armies, navies, &amp;c which may enlist on the side of the patron all those whom he can interest, &amp; all their families &amp; connections. but these expences must be paid by the labouring citizen. he cannot long continue therefore the advocate of opinions, which, to say only the least of them, doom the labouring citizen to toil &amp; sweat for useless pageants.I should be unfaithful to my own feelings were I not to say that it has been the greatest of all human consolations to me to be considered by the republican portion of my fellow citizens, as the safe depository of their rights. the first wish of my heart is to see them so guarded as to be safe in any hands, and not to depend on the personal disposition of the depository: and I hope this to be practicable as long as the people retain the spirit of freedom. when that is lost, all experience has shewn that no forms can keep them free against their own will. but that corrupt state of mind must be very distant in a country where, for ages to come, unoccupied soil  will still offer itself to those who wish to reap for themselves what themselves have sown. our chief object at present should be to reconcile the divisions which have been artificially excited and to restore society to it’s wonted harmony. whenever this shall be done it will be found that there are very few real opponents to a government elective at short intervals. accept assurances of the respect of Sir

great exercife of right in which the citi- c  
zens of America are about to adt, I have,  
d on mature conflderation, feen, that it is 0  
smy duty to be patfive. The interefts

•if no adts of violence intervene. The  
i great queftion which divides our citizens *&#x27;

MoxTicELLO, SEPT. 4, 1800.  
SIR,  
YOUR favor of August 16th, has  
been duly received, and is entitled to  
my thankfulnefs for the personal con­  
siderations you are pleased to express  
in it. How far. the measure pro­  
posed might have the expected effe&amp;,  
you can best judge : however, in the  
great eyereife of right in which the  
citizens of America are about to a&amp;,  
I have, on mature consideration, seen,  
that it is my duty to be paflfive.—The  
interests which they have at stake are  
entitled to their whole attention, un­  
biafled by personal esteem or local  
confideraticns ; and I am_ far from  
the presumption of considering myfelf  
equal to the awful duties of the firft  
majeltracy of this country.” That  
there should be differences of opinion  
among our fellow-citizens is to be  
expected always. Men who think  
freely, and have the right of expres­  
sing their thoughts, will differ. It is  
“true that these differences have of late  
been artificially increased ; but they  
are now again subsiding te their na­  
tural level, and all will soon come  
right, if no a&amp;ls of violence intervene.  
The great question which divides our  
citizens is, whether it is fafeft that a  
preponderance of power should be  
lodged with the monarchial, or the  
republican branch of our government?  
Temporary panics may produce ad­  
vocates for the former opinion even in  
this country ; but they will be as  
short lived as the panic, with the great  
mafsofour fellow-citizens. Thereisone  
circumstance which will always bring  
them to rights: a preponderance ofthe  
executive over the legislative branch  
cannot be maintained but by immense  
patronage, by multiplying offices,  
making them very lucrative by ar­  
mies, navies, &amp;c. which may enlist  
on #he fide of the patron all those  
whom be ean interest, and all their  
farilies and conneions; but these  
  
expenses must be paid by the laboring  
citizen ; he cannot long continue,  
therefore, the advocate of opinions;  
which, to fay only the lealt of them,  
doom the laboring citizen to toil and  
{weat, for useless peagants. ;  
I thould be unfaithful t 6 my own  
feelings were I not to fay, that it has  
been the greatest of all human conso­  
lations to me, to be considered bz the  
republican portion of my fellow&quot;citi--  
zens as the fafe depository of their  
rights. The firlt wish of .my heart is  
to fee them so guarded as to be fafe  
in any hands, and not to depend on  
the personal disposition of the deposi­  
tory : and I hope this to be pra&amp;ica-.  
ble as long as the people retain the  
{pirit of freedom. When that is loft,  
all experience has shewn, that no  
forms can keép them free against their  
own will. “But that corrupt state of  
mind must be very diltant in a coun­  
try where, for ages to come, unoccu­  
pied foil will still offer itfelf to those  
who wish to reap for themf{elves what  
themselves have sown.  
Our chief ohj-&amp; at present should  
be, to reconcile the divisions which  
have been artificially excited, and to  
restore society to its wonted harmony.  
Whenever this thall be done, it will be  
found, that there are very few real  
opponents tb a government eleive at  
short intervals.

Mont; cello, Sept. 4, 1 800.  
SIR, P  
  
YOUR favor of Auguf.. 26th, has  
bee n duly received, and is entitled to my  
tna nkfulnefs for the perfonal confiderati-  
onr. \ .-u are pleated to exprefs in it. —  
Hs&#x27;w far the meafure propofed might  
ha iheexpeded effect, you are che belt  
, judge : however, in the great exercifc of  
ri$it in which the citizens of America  
are about to act, I have, on mature confi-&#x27;  
delation, feen, that it is my duty to be  
paflive. The intbrefts which they have  
at *ake are entitled to their whole at-  
tention, unbiaffed by perfonal efteem or  
lor. i cor.iideraticns&#x27;; and I am far from  
the prelumption of confidering myfelf  
equal to the awful duties of the firft ma-  
gilt-acy of this country. That there  
Ihotld be differences of opinion among  
our fellow citizens, is to be expected al-  
ways. Men who think freelv, and have  
the right of cxprcfting their thoughts,  
will lifior. It is true that thefe differ-  
ence have of late been artificially in-  
creased ; but they are now again fubfid-  
ing v&gt; their natural level, &amp; all will foon  
jfcoflij right, &quot;if no acts of violence inter-  
vene The great queflion which di-  
vide our citizens is, whether it is fafeft  
thatja preponderance of power fhould be  
lodid with the monarchical, or the re-  
; 1 branch of our government ?  
  
Tenporary panics may produce advo-  
cate for the former opinion, even in this  
country ; but the opinion will be as  
fliof lived as the panic, with the gt^at  
naj )f our f &quot;.low citizens. There is  
Mdcircumflance which will alwavs bring  
  
them to rights : a preponderance of the  
executive over the legifiative branch can-  
net be maintained but by immenfe patron-  
age, by mahiplyingoflircs,tnaking them ve-  
ry lucrative, by armies, navies, &amp;c. which  
may cnlift on the fide of a patron all thole  
whom he canintereft, &amp; all their families  
and connections ; but thefe expenfes  
muft be pp.id by the labouring citizen ;  
he cannot long continue, therefore, the  
advocate of opinions, which, to fay only  
the leaft of them, doom the labouring  
citizen to toil and fweat, for utelefs pa-  
geants.  
  
I mould be unfaithful to my own feel-  
ings v/efe I not to fay, that it bar, been  
the greateft of all human confoUtions to  
me, to be confuhrci by the republican  
portion of my fellow citizens as the fafe  
depolitory of their rights. The &#x27;firft  
wifli of my heart is, to ice them fo guard-  
ed as to be fafe in any hands&#x27;, and not to  
depend on the perfonal difpoiition of the  
depositary : and I hope ibis to be prac-  
ticable as long as the people retain the  
fpirit of freedom. When that is loft, all  
experience has fliewn, that no forms can  
keep them free againft their own will.  
But that corrupt ftate of mind muft be  
very diftant in a country, where, for ages  
to come, unoccupied foil will ftill offer it-  
felf to thofe who wifh to reap for them-  
felves What themfelves have fown.  
  
Our chief object at prefent fhould be,  
to reconcile the divifions which have  
beer) artificially excited, and to reftore  
fociety to its wonted harmonv. Whene-  
ver this (hall be done, it will be found,  
that there are very few real opponents to  
a government elective at ihott intervals.  
Accept, affurances  
of the refpect of  
Sir  
  
Your very humble  
Servant,  
THOMAS JEFFERSON
