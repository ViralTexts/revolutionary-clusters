Sir Monticello Sep. 18. 13.  
I have duly recieved your favor of Aug. 27. am sensible of the kind intentions from which it flows, &amp; truly thankful for them, the more so as the they could only be the result of a favorable estimate of my public course. during a long life, as much devoted to study, as a faithful transaction of the trusts committed to me would permit, no subject has occupied more of my consideration than our relations with all the beings around us, our duties to them, and our future prospects. after reading &amp; hearing every thing which probably can be suggested respecting them, I have formed the best judgment I could as to the course they prescribe, and in the due observance of that course, I have no recollections which give me uneasiness. an eloquent preacher of your religious society, Richard Motte, in a discourse of much unction and pathos, is said to have exclaimed aloud to his congregation, that he did not believe there was a Quaker, Presbyterian, Methodist or Baptist in heaven.  
			 having paused to give his audience time to stare and to wonder, he added, that, in heaven, God God knew no distinctions, but considered all good men as his children, and as brethren of the same family. I believe, with the Quaker preacher, that he who steadily observes those moral  
			 precepts in which all religions concur, will never be questioned, at the gates of heaven, as to the dogmas in which they all differ. that on entering there, all these are left behind us, and the Aristideses &amp; Cato’s, the Penns &amp; Tillotsons, Presbyterians and Papists, will find themselves united in all principles which are in concert with the reason of the supreme mind. of all the systems of morality which antient or modern, which have come under my observation, none appear to me so pure as that of Jesus. he who follows this steadily need not, I think, be uneasy, altho’ he cannot comprehend the subtleties &amp;  
			 mysteries erected on his doctrines by those who, calling themselves his special  
			 followers &amp; favorites, would make him come into the world to lay snares for all understandings but theirs. these metaphysical heads, usurping the judgment seat of god, denounce as his enemies  
			 all  
			 who cannot percieve the Geometrical logic of Euclid, in the demonstrations of St Athanasius, that three are one, and one is three; and yet that the one is not three, nor the three one. in all essential points, you and I are of the same religion; and I am too old to go into enquiries &amp; changes as to the unessential.  
			 repeating therefore my thankfulness for the kind concern you have been so good as to

Monticello,  
September 13, 1813.  
  
HAVE duly received your favour  
  
of August 29, and am sensible of  
the kind intentions from which it flows,  
and truly thankful for them, the more  
so as they could only be the result of  
a favourable estimate of my public  
course—as much devoted to study as a  
faithful transaction of the trust com-  
mitted to me would permit.  
  
No subject has occupied more of  
ny aman. than our relations  
with all the beings around us, our  
duties, and our future prospect. After  
hearing all which probably can be sug-  
gested concerning them, I have forme:l  
the best judgment I could, as to the  
course they prescribe, and in the due  
observation of that course I have no  
recollections which give me uneasiness.  
An eloquent preacher of your religious  
Society, Richard Mott, in a discourse  
of much unction and pathos, is said to  
have exclaimed aloud to his congre-  
gation, that “‘ he did not believe there  
was a Quaker, Presbyterian, Methodist,  
or Baptist, in heaven.” Having paused  
to give his ooenpnins time to stare  
and wonder, he added, that in ‘‘ heaven  
God knows no distinction, but consi-  
dered ail good men as his children, and  
brethren of the same family.”  
  
I believe with the Quaker preacher,  
that he who observes the moral pre-  
cepts in which all religions concur,  
will never be suastlonal at the gates  
of heaven, as to the dogmas in which  
all differ; that on entering there the  
Aristides and Catos, the Penns and  
Tillotsons, Presbyterians and Baptists,  
will find themselves united in all the  
principles which are in concert with  
the Supreme Mind. Of all the systems  
of morality, ancient and modern, which  
have come under my observation, none  
appears to me as pure as that of Jesus.  
He who follows this steadily, need not,  
{ think, be uneasy, although he cannot  
comprehend the subtilties and myste-  
ries erected on his doctrines by those  
who, calling themselves his special fol-  
lowers and favourites, would make  
him come into the world to lay snares  
for all understandings but ¢hcirs.

1323,  
SIR,  
  
Ihave duly received your  
favour of Aug. 29 -and am sen-  
sible of the kind intention  
trom which it flows, and truly  
thankful for them; the more  
so as they could only be the  
result of a favourable estimate  
of my public course, as much  
devoted to study, as a faithful  
transaction of the trust commit-  
ted tome would permit.  
  
No subject has cccupied  
more of my consideration than  
our relations with all the be-  
ings around us, our duties, and  
  
our inture prospect. After  
hearing all which can probably  
be sugeested concerning them,  
I have formed the Lest judg-  
ment t could, as to the course  
they prescribed ; and, in the  
due observation of that course,  
I have no recollections which  
give me uneasiness. An elo-  
quent preacher of your relig-  
lous scciety, Richard Mott, in  
a discourse of much uaction and  
pathes, is said to have exclaim-  
ed aloud to his congregation  
that * he did not believe there  
was a Quaker, Presbyterian,  
Methodist or Baptist in heav-  
en.’ Having paused, to give  
his congregaticn time to stare  
and wonder, he added, that “in  
heaven God knows no distinct-  
jon; but considered all good  
men as his children of the same  
family.”’

I believe with the Quaker  
preacher, that he who observes  
the moral precepts in which all  
religions concur, will never be  
questioned at the gates of heay-  
ea us to the dormas in which  
all differ ; that on entering

the Penns and &#x27;Tilottsons, Pres-

Of all the systems of morality,

follows. this steadily, need not,  
I think, be uneasy, althoug) he

Sir--I have duly received your favor of  
August 29th, and am sensible of the kind  
intentions from which it flows, and thankful  
for them--the more so as they could only  
be the result of a favorable estimation of  
my public course. During a long life as  
much devoted to duty as a faithful dis  
charge of the trust confided to me would  
permit, no object has occupied more of  
my consideration than our relation with  
the beings around us, our duties to them  
and our future prospects. After hearing  
ad reading everything which probably  
can be suggested concerning them I have  
formed the best judgment I could as to  
the course they prescribe, and in the due  
observance of that course I have no recol  
lections which give me any remorse. A  
subsequent preacher of your religious so­  
ciety, Richard Mott, in a discourse of  
much unction and pathos, is said to have  
exclaimed aloud to his congregation that  
he did not believe there was a Quaker,  
Presbyterian, Methodist or Baptist in  
heaven. Having paused to give his audi  
ence time to stare and wonder, he said  
that in heaven God knew no distinctions,  
but considered all good men as His chil­  
dren and brethren of the same family.  
I believe, witn the Quaker preacher,  
that those who steadily observe those  
moral precepts in which all religions con­  
cur will never be questioned at the gates  
of heaven as to the dogmas in which they  
differ--that on entering there all these are  
telt benind us. The Aristideses and Oatos,  
Penns, and Tillotsons, Presbyterians and  
Papists, will find themselves united in all  
principles which are in concert with the  
reason of the Supreme Mind. With all  
the systems of morality, ancient and mod  
ern, which have come under my observa­  
tion, none appear so pure to me as that of  
Jesus. He who follows this steadily need  
not, I think be uneasy although he can  
not comprenend the mysteries and subtle  
ties erected on His doctrines by those who,  
calling themselves his special followers  
and lavorites, would make Him come into  
the world to lay snares for all understand  
ings but theirs.  
The metaphysical heads, usurping the  
judgment seat of God, denounce as His  
enemies all who cannot perceive the geo­  
metrical logic of Euclid in the demonstra­  
tion of Athanasius that three are in one  
and one in three, and yet that three are  
not one nor the one three. In all essen  
tial points, you and I are of the same re  
ligion, and I am too old to go into in­  
quiries and charges as to the unessential.  
Repeating, therefore, my thankfulness for  
the kind concern you have been so good

tion ef my public cowrf e. During x long  
life as much devoted to duty as a faith­  
ful discharge of the trust oonfided to me  
would permit, no object has occupied  
more of my consideration than our rela­  
tion with the beings around 9, our du­  
ties to them and our&#x27; future prospects.  
After hearing and reading everything

cerning them I hare formed tho best  
judgment I could as to the course they

that course 1 haye no recollections which  
give me any remorse. A subsequent  
preaeher of vour reli;ioH8 society,  
Richard Alott, in a discourse of much  
unction and pathos, is said to have ex­  
claimed aloud to his congregation that  
lie did not believe there was a Quaker,  
Presbyterian, Methodist or Biptint in  
Heaven. Having paused to give his au­  
dience timo to stare and wonder, he said  
that in Heaven God knew no distinctions,  
but considered all good men a His chil­  
dren and brethren of the same family.  
I believe with the Quaker preacher  
that those who steadily observe thee  
moral preccpta in which all religions  
concur will never ba questioned at the  
gates of Heaven as to the dogmas in  
which they differ that on entering there  
all these are left behind us. The Atisti­  
descs and CatosMPenns and Tillotsons,  
Presbyterians and Papists, will find  
themselves united ia all principles which  
  
are in cencert with the reason of the Su­  
preme Mind. With all the systems of  
  
morality, ancient and modern, which  
have come under my observation, none  
appear to me so pure as that of Jesus.  
He who follows this steadily need not, I  
  
think, be uneasy, although he can not  
comprehend the mysteries aad subtleties  
erected on His doctrines by those who,  
  
calling themselves His special followers  
  
and favorites, would make Him come ia-  
  
to the world to lay snares for all under­  
standings but theirs.  
The metaphysical heads, usurping the  
judgment seat of God, denounce as Ills  
enemies all who cannot perceive the ge­  
ometrical logic of Euclid in the demon­  
stration of Anthanaslns that three are  
in one and one in three. In all essential  
points, you and I are of the same relig­  
ion, and I am too old to go into inquiries  
and charges as to the unessential. Re­  
peating, therefore, my thankfulness for  
the kind concern you haye been so good

Sir: I have duly received your favor of August 29,  
and am sensible of the kind intentions from which it  
flows, and truly thankful for them ; the more so as they  
could only be the result of a favorable estimate of my pub-  
lic course, as much devoted to study as a faithful transac-  
tion of the trust committed to me would permit. No  
subject has occupied more of my consideration than our  
relations with all the beings around us, our duties to  
them, and our future prospects.  
  
After hearing all which can probably be suggested con-  
cerning them, I have formed the best judgment I could as  
to the course they prescribe, and in the due observance  
of that course I have no reflections which give me un-  
easiness. An eloquent preacher of your religious Society,  
Richard Mott, in a discourse of much unction and pathos,  
is said to have exclaimed aloud to his congregation that  
he ‘* did not believe there was a Quaker, Presbyterian,  
or Baptist in Heaven.’’ Having paused to give his con-  
gregation time to stare and wonder, he added: ‘ In  
heaven God knows no distinction, but considers all good  
men as his children and brethren of the same family.’’  
I believe with the Quaker preacher, that he who observes  
those moral precepts in which all religions concur will  
never be questioned at the gates of heaven as to the  
dogmas in which all differ; that on entering there all  
these are left behind, and that the Aristides and Catos,  
the Penns and Tillotsons, Presbyterians and Papisté,  
will find themselves united in all the principles which are  
in concert with the Supreme Mind. Of all the systems  
of morality, ancient or modern, which have come under  
my observation, none appears so pure a$ that of Jesus.  
He who follows this steadily need not, I think, be un-  
easy, although he cannot comprehend the subtilties and  
mysteries erected on the doctrines of Jesus by those who  
calling themselves his special followers and favorites,  
would make him come into the world to lay snares for  
all understandings but theirs. Their metaphysical heads,  
usurping the judgment seat of God, denounce as his ene-  
mies all who cannot perceive the logic of Euclid, in the  
demonstrations of Saint Athanasius that three are one and  
one three.  
  
In all essential points you and I are of the same relig-  
ion, and I am too old to go into the non-essentials. Re-  
peating, therefore, my thankfulness for the kind concern  
you have been so good as to express, I salute you, with  
friendship and brotherly love.
