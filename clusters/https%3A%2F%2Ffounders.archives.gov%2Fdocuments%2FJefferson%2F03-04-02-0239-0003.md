Livingstone

demurrer to   
on a plea to the jurisdiction  
  
  
v.  
  
  
Jefferson  
  
  
The sole question now to be decided is this; Can this court take cognizance of a trespass committed on lands lying within the United States, &amp; without the District of Virginia in a case where the trespasser is a resident of &amp; is found within the District?  
I concur with my brother Judge in the opinion that it cannot.  
I regret that the inconvenience to which delay might expose at least one of the parties, together with the situation of the court, prevent me from bestowing on this subject   
question that deliberate consideration which the very able discussion it has received from the bar would seem to require; but I have purposely avoided any investigation of the subject previous to the argument, &amp; must now be content with a brief statement of the opinion I have formed, &amp; a sketch of the course of reasoning which has led to it.  
The doctrine of actions local &amp; transitory has been traced up to its origin in the common law; &amp;, it   
as has been truely stated on both sides, it appears that originally all actions were local. That is that, according to the principles of the common law, every fact must be tried by a jury of the vicinage. The plain consequence of this principle is   
was   
that those courts only could take jurisdiction of a case who were capable of directing such a jury as must try the material facts on which their judgement would depend. The jurisdiction of the courts therefore necessarily became local with respect to every species of action.  
But the superior courts of England having power to direct a jury to every part of the Kingdom, their jurisdiction could be restrained by this principle only to cases cases arising on transactions which occurred within the realm. Being able to direct a jury either to Surry or Middlesex, the necessity of averring in the declaration that the cause of action arose in either county, could not be produced in order to give the court jurisdiction, but to furnish a venue. For the purpose of jurisdiction, it would unquestionably be sufficient to aver that the transaction took place within the realm.  
  
This however being not a statutory regulation, but a principle of unwritten law, which is really human reason applied by courts, not capriciously but in a regular train of decisions, to human affairs—according to the circumstances of the nation, the necessity of the times, &amp; the general state of things, was thought susceptible of modification, &amp; Judges have modified it. They have  
			 not changed the old principle as to form. It is still necessary to give a venue; and where the contract exhibits on its face evidence of the place where it was made, the   
either   
the party is at liberty to aver that such place lies in any county in England.  
This is known to be a fiction. Like an ejectment, it is the creature of the court, &amp; is moulded to the purposes of justice according to the view which its inventors have taken of its capacity to effect those purposes. It is not however of undefinable extent. It has not absolutely prostrated all distinctions of place, but has certain limits prescribed to it founded in reasoning satisfactory to those who have gradually fixed these limits. It may well be doubted whether, at this day, they are to be changed by a Judge not perfectly satisfied with their extent.  
This fiction is so far protected by its inventors that the averment is not traversable for the purpose of defeating an action it was invented to sustain; but it is traversable whenever such traverse may be essential to the merits of the cause. It is always traversable for the purpose of contesting a jurisdiction not intended to be protected by the fiction.   
In the case at bar it is traversed for that purpose, &amp; the question is whether this be a case in which such traverse is sustainable; or, in other words, whether courts have so far extended their fiction as, by its aid, to take cognizance of trespasses on lands not lying within those limits which bound their process.  
They have, without legislative aid, applied this fiction to all personal torts, &amp; to all contracts wherever executed. To this general rule contracts respecting lands form no exception. It is admitted that on a contract respecting lands an action is sustainable wherever the defendent may be found. Yet in such a case, every difficulty may occur which presents itself in an action of trespass. An investigation of title may become necessary. A question of boundary may arise, &amp; a survey may be essential to the full merits of the cause. Yet these difficulties have not prevailed against the jurisdiction of the court. They have been countervailed &amp; more than countervailed by the opposing consideration that, if the action be disallowed, the injured party may have a clear right without a remedy in a case where the person who has done the wrong &amp; who ought to make the compensation, is within the power of the court.  
That this consideration should lose its influence where the action pursues a thing not within the reach of the court, is of inevitable necessity; but for the loss of its influence where the remedy is against the person &amp; can be afforded by the court, I have not yet discerned a reason, other than a technical one, which can satisfy my judgement.  
If however this technical distinction be firmly established, if all other Judges respect it, I cannot venture to disregard it.  
The distinction taken is that actions are deemed transitory where the transactions on which they are founded might have taken place any where; but are local where their cause is in its nature necessarily local.  
If this distinction be established: if Judges have for a long course of time determined to carry their innovation on the old rule no further; if, for a long course of time, under circumstances which have not changed, they have determined this to be the limit of their fiction, it would require a hardihood which   
in this place I cannot venture I do not possess, to pass this limit.  
This distinction has been repeatedly taken in the books, &amp; is recognized by the best elementary writers, especially by Judge Blackstone, from whose authority no man will lightly dissend   
dissent He expressly classes an action   
quare for a trespass on lands with those actions which demand their possession, &amp; which are local, &amp; makes only those actions transitory which are brought on occurrences that might happen in any place. From the cases which support this distinction no exception I beleive is to be found among those that have been decided in court on solemn argument.  
  
One of the greatest Judges who ever sat on any bench, &amp; who has done more than any other to remove those technical impediments which grew out of a different state of society, &amp; too long continued to obstruct the course of ju substantial justice, was so struck with the weakness of the distinction between taking jurisdiction in cases of contract respecting lands, &amp; of torts committed on the same lands, that he attempted to abolish it. In the case of Mostyn v FabrigasLord Mansfield stated the true distinction to be between proceedings which are in rem, in which the effect of a judgement can not be had unless the thing ly within the reach of the court, &amp; proceedings against the person where the action sounds in damages only are demanded. But this opinion was given in an action for a personal wrong which is admitted to be transitory. It has not therefore the authority to which it would be entitled had this distinction been laid down in an action deemed local. It may be termed an obiter dictum. He recites in that opinion two cases decided by himself in which an action was sustained for trespass on lands lying in the foreign dominions of his Britannic Majesty; but both those decisions were at nisi prius: And though the overbearing influence of Lord Mansfield might have sustained them on a motion for a new trial, that motion never was made, &amp; the principle did not obtain the sanction of the court.In  
			 a subsequent case reported in 4thD &amp; E. these decisions are expressly referred to &amp;overruled, and the old distinction is affirmed.  
It has been said that the decisions of British courts made since the revolution are not authority in this country. I admit it. But they are entitled to that respect which is due to the opinions of wise men who have maturely studied the subject they decide. Had the regular course of decisions previous to the revolution been against the distinction now asserted, and had the old rule been overthrown by adjudications made subsequent to that event, this court might have felt itself bound to disregard them; but where the distinction is of antient date, has been long preserved, &amp; a modern attempt to overrule it has itself been overruled since the revolution, I can consider the last adjudication in no other light than as the true declaration of the antient rule.  
According to the common law of England then, the distinction taken by the defendents counsel between actions local &amp; transitory is the true distinction, &amp; an action of trespass   
quare clausum fregit is a local action.  
This common law has been adopted by the legislature of Virginia. Had it not been adopted I should have thought it in force. When our  ancestors migrated to America they brought with them the common law of their native country so far as it was applicable to their new situation, &amp; I do not concieve that the revolution would in any degree have changed  
			 the relations of man to man, or the law which regulated those relations. In breaking off our political connection  with the parent state, we did not break our connections with each other. It remained subject to the antient rules until those rules should be changed by the competent authority.  
But it has been said that this rule of the common law is impliedly changed by the act of assembly which directs that a jury shall be summoned from the by standers.  
Were I to discuss the effect of this act in the courts of the State, the enquiry whether the fiction already noticed was not equivalent to it in giving jurisdiction, would present itself. There are also other regulations, as that the jurors should be citizens, which would deserve to be taken into view. But I pass over these considerations because I am decidedly of opinion that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States depends exclusively on the constitution &amp; laws of the United States.  
  
In considering the jurisdiction of this court   
the circuit courts as defined in the judicial act, &amp; in the constitution which that act carries into execution, it is obse worthy of observation that the jurisdiction of the court depends on the character of the parties, &amp; that only that court which has the court of that district in which the defendent resides or is found can take jurisdiction of the cause. In a court so constituted, the argument drawn from the total failure of justice should the court of that defendent in cases of trespass   
a trespasser be declared to be only amenable to the court of that District in which the land lies &amp; in which he will never be found appeared to me to be entitled to peculiar weight. But according to  
			 the course of the common law the process of the court must be executed in order to give it the   
power right to try the cause, &amp; consequently the same defect of justice might occur. Other Judges have felt the weight of this argument, &amp; have struggled ineffectually against the distinction which produces the inconvenience of a clear right without a remedy. I must submit to it.  
The law upon the demurrer is in favor of the defendent.

Demurrer on u hUu ? .  
to thin Jurisdiction. ^ .ha r. t. ;j.»t,r. c. j.  
The sole question now to be decided is  
this , can this court take cognisance of a  
trespass committed on lands*} ing within the  
United States, and without the district of  
Virginia, in a case where the trespasser is a  
resident of,and is fount! within the district?  
i 1 concur with my brother Judge in the o­  
pinion, that it cannot.  
I 1 regret that the inconvenience to which  
delay might expose at least one of the par­  
ties, together with the situation of the court,  
prevent me fr&gt; m bestowing rn this question  
that de&#x27;iberatc consideration which the very  
able iiscussion it has received from the bar  
woul.l seem to require ; but I have purpose­  
ly avoided any investigation of the subject ■  
previous to the argument, and must now be I  
content with a brief statement of the opini-j  
on 1 have formed, and a sketch of the course  
of reasoning which has led to it.  
1 he doctrine of actions local and transi­  
tory has been traced up to its origin in the  
common law ; and, as 1ms been truly stated  
on both sides, it appears that originally all  
actions were local. 1 hat is, that according  
to the principles of the common law, every  
fact must be tried by a jury of the vicinage.  
The plain consequence of this principle was,  
that those courts only could take jurisdiction  
of a case, who were capable of directing  
such a jury as must try the material facts  
on which their judgment would depend. The  
jurisdiction of the courts therefore necessa­  
rily became local with respect to every spe­  
cies of action.  
  
nut tne Superior Courts of England hav­  
nig power to direct a jury to every part of  
the kingdom, their jurisdiction could be re­  
strained by this principle only to cases ari­  
sing on transactions which occurred within  
the realm. Being able to direct a jury either  
to Surry or Middlesex, the necessity of a­  
\ erring in tiic declaration that the cause of  
action arose in cither county, could not be  
produced in order to give the&#x27;eourt jurisdic­  
tion, but.to furnish a venue. For the pur-&#x27;  
pose ol jurisdiction, it would unquestionably  
be sufficient to aver that the transaction took  
place within the realm.  
This however being not a statutory regu­  
lation, but a principle of unwritten law,  
which is really human reason applied by  
courts, not capriciously but in a regular  
train ot decisions, to human affairs accord- f  
mg to the circumstances of the nation, the  
necessity of the times, and the general state 1  
of things, was thought susceptible of modi­  
fication, and Judges have modifie it. They  
have not changed &gt; 4he old ‘principle as to  
lorr.i. It is still necessary to give a venue ;  
and where the contract exhibits on its face  
c\ idencc of the place where it was made, I  
die par».} is at liberty to aver tliat sucli place &#x27; 1  
lies in any county in England.  
I his is Known to be a riction. Eike an e- &lt;  
jeet incut, it is the creature of the court, &lt;  
and is moulded to the purposes of, justice I  
according to the view which its inventors  
have taken of its capacity to effect those &#x27;  
purposes. It is -not however, of undchnable &#x27;  
extent. It has not absolutely prostrated all  
distinctions oi place, but has certain limits &#x27;  
prescribed to it founded in reasoning satis­  
factory^ to those who have gradually fixed  
these limits. It may well be doubted whe­  
ther, at this day, they are to be changed by &gt;  
a judge not perfectly satisfied with&#x27; their M  
extent. !  
  
1 111* union IS so i IV parvccteci by its in­  
ventors that the uvernient‘Vi not traversu­  
iilc for the purpose of dvfe;&#x27;: ig an action it &lt;  
was invented tosusta.n ; but it is traversa­  
ble whenever such traverse may he essenti­  
al to the. merits of the cause. It is alway  
! traversable lor the purpose of contesting i\
jurisdiction not intended to be protected b*  
the lic.tion.  
In the case at bar it is traversed for that  
pur;i ise, and the question is whether this,  
be acase in whit h such tt averse is sustain­  
able ; or, in other words, whether courts  
have so far extended their fiction as, l&gt;v its  
aid, to take cognizance of trespasses on  
lands not lying within those limits which  
bound their process.  
I bey have, without legislative aid, ap­  
P;&#x27;cd this fiction to all personal torts, and to  
all contracts wherever executed. To this&#x27;  
general rule contracts respecting hinds form i  
no exception. It is admitted that on a con­  
tract respecting lands an action is sustaina­  
ble wherever* the defendant may be found. !  
t ct in such a case, every difficulty mav nc- I  
••nr which presents iisc&#x27;lf in an action of 1  
trcsprdv /\n investigation of title may l»e-j  
come neccs&#x27;iairv. A question of honndary 1  
! &#x27;nay ft rise, and a survey may be essential te I  
tl-e full merits of the cause. Yet these dif­  
ficulties have not prevailed against the ju­  
risdiction of the court. They have been  
i&lt; untervaiK&#x27; 1 and move than countervailed  
; by the opposing consideration that, if the  
| action be disallo ved, the injured party may  
h.nc a clear right without a remedy in a  
case where the jKrron who lmr, done the  
wro!ig and who ought to make the competi­  
tion, i&#x27;. within the power of Vue court.  
^ **at this consideration should lose it in­

within the reach of the court, is of inevita­  
ble necessity ; Out f&gt;r the loss of its influ­  
ence where the remedy is against thoper­  
.on and can he uhorded by the court, 1 h ive 1  
not j et discerned a reason, other than .. j  
technical one, which can satisfy my m&lt;W­  
ment. **

to pass this limit.  
&#x27;i&#x27;lii.s distinctionlias f*eeu repeatedly taken  
in the books, and recognized l»v the l»est  
elementary writers, especially Judge Hlack­  
stone, from whose authority no man will  
lightly dissent. Ho expressly classes an  
action for a trespass on lands with those ac­  
tions which demand tl&#x27;.cir possession, and  
; which are local, and makes only those aeti­  
[ ons trausitory which arc brought m orcur­  
lynces that might happen in any place,  
from the cases which support this uisiiMcti­  
on no exception 1 believe is to be found a­  
nu.aig those that have been decidtd in court  
on solemn argument.  
One- of the greatest Judges who ever -,nt or  
anv bench, and who has done more than am  
other to remove those technical impediments  
which grew out of a different state of society,  
and too iota; continued to obstruct the course  
of substantial justice, was so struck, with the  
weakness of the distinction between taking  
jurisdiction in cases of contract respecting  
lands, and of torts committed on the same  
lands, that he attempted to abolish it. In  
the case of Mortyn v. Fabrigas, Lord Muns­  
l.eld stated the true distinction to lie between  
proceedings which arefm run, in which the  
rfiect ol a judgment cannot he had, unless the  
thing ly within the reach of the Court, and  
[iroccedings against the pers &gt;n where dama­  
ges only are demanded, lint this opinion  
was given in art action for a personal wrong  
which is admitted to be transitory. It has  
lot thcrcfui-C the authority to which it would  
je entitled, had this distinction been laid down  
in an action deemed local, it may be termed  
\&#x27;.\o Liter dictum. He recites in that opinion  
two cases decided by himself, in which an  
action was sustained for trespass on lands lv­  
ng in the foreign dominious of his Hritapnic  
Majesty ; but both those decisions were at  
tisi/irius : And though the overhearing ir.­  
Huence of Lord Mansi.eld, might have sus­  
tained tlicm on a motion for a new trial, that  
motion never was made, and the principle  
Ji«l not obtain the sanction of the court, in a  
subsequent rase reported in 4th D. &amp; E.  
these decisions are expressly referred to and  
overruled, and the old distinction ts affirm­  
ed.  
  
It has been said, that the decisions of Bri­  
tish courts made since the revolution, arc  
not mi thorite in this country. I admit it.—  
But they arc entitled to that respect which  
is due to the opinions of wise men who have  
maturely studied the subject they decide.—  
Had the regular course of decisions pro* ious  
to the revolution, been against the distinction  
now asserted, and had tlic old rule been o­  
verihrown by adjudications made subsequent  
to that event, this court mighthave felt itself  
bound to disregard them ; bui where the dis­  
tinction is of antient date, has been long pre­  
served, and a modern attempt to overrule it,  
tas itself been overruled since the revolution,  
I can consider the last adjudication in no &lt;&gt;­  
ther light than as the true declaration of the  
indent rule.  
According to the common law of Knglaini,  
then, the distinction taken by the defendant&#x27;s  
counse^e tween actions local and transitori,  
is the true distinction, and an action of-tres­  
pass &lt;jua¥&#x27;e cluuxuin fregir is a local action.  
111 is common law lias been adopted by the  
legislature of Virginia. Had it not been a  
:iopted, I should have thought it in force.—  
IVHen our ancestors migrated to America,  
l’-ev brought with them t ■ e mmon law of  
•heir native country so far as it w - a plicu­  
ile to their new situation, and Ido not con­  
nive that tile revolution would in any degree  
aave changed the relations of man to man,  
sr the law which regulated those relations.—  
in breaking our political connection -with the  
&gt;arent state, wt did not break our connecti­  
)ii with each other. It remained subsequent  
o the antient rules, until tlic.se rules should  
&gt;e changed by&#x27;the competent authority.  
But it has been said that this rule of the  
mmnion law is impliedly changed by the act  
&gt;f assembly, which directs rhatajury shall  
a* summoned from the byi-standees.  
\\ ere 1 t&lt;&gt; discuss the effect of this act in  
he courts *&gt;t the state, the enquiry, whether  
he fiction already noticed was not equiva­  
ent to it in giving jurisdiction, would present  
tScb. Thci c are also other regulations, as,  
hat the jurors should be citizens, which  
would deserve to betaken into .&#x27;iew. But 1  
&gt;ass over these considerations; because 1 am  
lecidediy ef opinion, that the jurisdictic n of  
; ic courts ot the United States depends ex­  
clusively on the constitution and laws ol* the  
United States.  
  
jii uuiibuicri&#x27;iguic jurismcvion oi me circuit  
&#x27;ourts us defined in the judicial act, ur.cl in  
die constitution which that act carries into  
execution, it is worthy of observation that the  
urisdictiou ot the court depends on the cha­  
racter ot the parties, and that only the court  
af that district in which the defendant resides  
&gt;r is found, can take jurisdiction of the cause.  
In a court so constituted, the argument drawn j  
li&#x27;om the total failure of justice, should a j  
trespasser he declared to lie only amenable !  
to the court of that district in which the land j  
ics, andvin which he will never lie found, ap­  
peared to me to be entitled to peculiar weight.  
Hut according to the course of the common  
law, the process ot the court must be excc  
ted in order to give it the right to try the  
nuise, and consequently the same defect  
tstice might occur. Other Judge have felt  
the weight of this argument, and buvestrug­  
?!ed ineffectually against the distmetio;  
which produces the inconvenience of a clear  
right without a remedy. 1 must submit to it.,

Demurrer on a plea ) * ” , 1  
to thu jurisdiction y c- J‘  
The sole question now to be decided is this—rah  
this court take cogmmner of a trespass commuted  
on lands lying within the United Stales, and with­  
out the District ol Virginia, in a case where the  
trespass-i* is a resident ol, and is lonnd within the  
district? I . -1  
I rnneur with nay brother judge in the opinion,  
that it c«nuut.  
1 regret th.it the inconvenience to which delay  
might expose at least one of the parties, together  
with the situation of the court, prevent me from  
bestowing on this question that deliberate canside­  
ralion which the very able discussion it has receiv­  
ed from the bar would seem to itqui.e—but I have  
purposely avoid-d any investigation ol the subject  
previous to the argument, and must now be con­  
tent with a brief statement of the opinion I have  
formed, and a sketch of the course ol reasoning  
which has ted to it.  
  
1 r,edoctrine of actions local and transitory has  
been traced up to its origin in the common law—  
‘knd, as has been truly slated on both sides, it ap­  
pears that originally all actions were local. That  
is, that according to the principles ol the common  
l »w, every fact uiust be tried by a jury of the vi­  
cinage. The plain consequence of this principle is,  
that those courts only could take jurisdiction of a  
case, who were capable of directing such a jury as  
mast try tbe material facts on which their judgment  
would depend. The jurisdiction of the courts  
therefore necessarily become local .with respect to  
every species of union.  
But the Superior Courts of England having pow­  
er to direct a jury to every part of the kingdom,  
their jurisdiction could be restrained by this princi­  
ple only to ruses arising on transactions which oc­  
curred within the realm. Being able to direct a ju­  
ry either to Surry or Middlesex, the necessity of  
averring in the declaration that the cause of action  
arose in either county, rould not be produced in  
order to give the court jurisdiction, but to fuinisb  
a venue. For the purpose of juiisdiction, it would  
unqestionably be sufficient to aver that the trans­  
action, took place within the realm.  
This however being not a statutory regulation,  
but^rincple ol unwritten law, which is reallv  
human reason applied by courts, not capriciously  
but in a regular train of decisious, to human atlairs  
according to the circumstances of the nation, the  
necessity of the times, and the geneial state of  
things, drag thought susceptible of modification,  
and Judges have modified it. Tney have not chan­  
ged the old principle as to form. It is still neces­  
sary to give a venue; and where the contract ex­  
hibits on its face evidence of the place where it was  
mad -, the patty is at liber y to aver that such  
place Ins in any county in England.  
This is known to be a fiction. Like an ejectment,  
it is the creature of the court, and is moulded to  
tbe purposes of justice according to the view which  
its‘inventors have taken of its capacity to effect  
those purposes. It is however, of umiefinable ex  
tent. It has not absolutely prostrated all distor­  
tions of place, but has ceitam limits prescribed to  
it (ouuded in reasoning satisfactory to those who  
have gradually fixed these limits.* It may well be  
doubted whether, at this day, they are to be chan­  
ged by a judge not perfectly satisfied with their ex­  
tent., *•&#x27; ■ 1 &#x27; -. ■  
&quot;I his fiction is so far protected by its inventors  
-that the averment is not traversable for the pur­  
pose of defeating an action it was invented to sus­  
tain ; but it is traversable whenever such traverse  
may be essential to the merits of the cause. It is  
always traversable (or the purpose of contesting a  
jurisdiction not intended to be protected by the fic­  
tion.  
Imthe case at bar it is traversed (or that purpose,  
and the question is whether this be a case in which  
such traverse is sustainable ; or, in other words,  
whether courts have so far extended their fiction  
as, by its aid, to take cognizance of trespasses on  
lands not lying within those limits which bound  
their process.  
  
lliKj- have, without legislative aid, applied this  
fiction 10 all personal tons, and to all contracts  
wherever executed. , To this general lule contracts  
respecting lands form uo exception. It is admit­  
ted that on a contract respecting lands an action is  
sustainable wherever the defendant may be found.  
Vet in such a case, every difficulty may occur  
tyhich presents itsell in an action of trespass. An  
investigation of title may become necessary^ A  
question of boundary may arise, and a survey may  
be essential to the tull merits of the cause. Yet  
these difficulties have not prevailed against the ju­  
risdiction of the court. They have been counter­  
vailed and more than countervailed by the opposing  
consideration that, tf the action be disallowed,  
the injured parly may have a clear right without a  
remedy in a rase where the person who has done  
the wrongand who ought to make the compensa­  
tion, is within the power of the court.  
That this consideration should lose its influence  
where the action pursues a thing not within the  
reach of the court, is of inevitable necessity ; but  
for the loss of its iufiuente where the rem dy is a­  
feiusl the perron and ran be afforded by the court,  
have not yet discerned a reason, other than a  
technical one, which can satisfy my judgment.  
ll however this technical distinction be firmly  
established, if ail other judges respect it, I cannot  
venture to disregard it. , » .

transiloryt where transactions on which they are  
founded might have taken place any where ; hut

this distinction no exception I,believe is t» be found  
rtii.ong those that have be*i» iiltlded ^n cour^on  
solemn argument.  
One of the greatest judgtes who ever sat on at^r]*  
bench, and who has dune more than any other to®  
remove those technical impediments which grew  
nit of a different state ofgociefy, and too long con­  
tinued to obstruct the course of substantial justice,  
was so struck with the Weakness of the distinction  
between taking jurisdiction in cases of contract re­  
spet tine lands, and of tons committed on the same  
lands, that be attempted to abolish it. In the case  
of Mortyn v. Fabrigaa, Lord Mansfield stated the  
Hue distinction between proceedings which are tu  
rem, in which the effect of a judgmeut cannot be  
bad, unlgs^thing lye within the rearh of the court,  
and proceedings against the person where damages •*  
only are demanded. But Ibis opinion wts given in  
an action for a personal wrong which is admitted &#x27;  
to be transitory. It has not therefore the authori­  
ty to which it would be entitled, had this distincti­  
on been laid down in an action deemed local, ft ’  
may be termed an Obiter dictum. He recites in that ®  
opinion two cases decided by himself, in which S#**’  
action was sustain&#x27;d for tiespass on lands lvin“ in  
the foreign dominions of his Britannic majesty ;  
but both those decisions were at Nisiprius : And  
though the overbearing influence ol Lord Mansfield  
might have sustained them on a niotion fofi&#x27; new  
trial, that motion never was niade, and&#x27;tbe princi­  
ple did not obtain the sanction of the court.- In «  
subsequent case reported in 4th D. &amp; E. these deci­  
sions are expressly refeired to aud overruled, and  
.lie old distinction is aff.imed. — , t- .  
  
u Das oeeu said, that the decisions of British  
courts made since the revolution, are Dot authority  
in this country. I admit it. But they are entitled &#x27;  
to that respect which is due to the opinions of wise  
meu who have matuieiy studied the subject they de­  
cide. Uad the regular course ol decisions previous  
to the revolutiou, been against the distinction now  
asserted, and had the old rule been overthrown by  
adjudications made subsequent to that event, this  
court might have felt itself bound to disregard  
them; but where the ancient date has been long  
preserved, end a modern attempt to overrule is, lias  
itseli been overruh d since the revolution, 1 can con­  
sider the last adjudication in no other light than as  
ih litis declaration of the ancient rule. &#x27;■  
According to the common law of England, then, c  
the distinction taken by tbe defendant’s counsel b«­  
i&#x27;*e«n actions local and transitory, is the true dis­  
tinction, and an action oi trespass tjujre clausum  
f icgit is a local action.  
This common law has been adopted by tbe legis­  
lature of Vnginia. Had it not been adopted, F  
should have thought it in force. When our ances­  
tors migrated to America, they brought with them  
the common law of tbeir native country so far as it  
was applicable to their new situation, and I do not ‘  
conceive that the revolution would in any degree  
have changed the relations of mau to nmn, or the  
law which regulated those relations. In breaking t  
our political connection with the parent state, we ’  
did break our connection with each other. It re­  
mained subsequent to the ancient roles, until those  
rules should he changed by the competent authori- *  
ty.  
But it has been said that this inle of the com­  
mon law is implituiy changed by the act of Assem­  
bly, which directs that a jury shall be suinmoued  
from the bye-standers. *1  
Were I to dis.uss the effect of this act in the ‘  
courts ol the state, the enquiry, whether the fiction  
already noticed was not equivalent to it in giving ju­  
risdiction, would present itself. There are also  
other regulations, as, that the jurors should be cfc&amp;i  
lizeus, which would deserve to be taken mil  
la view. But I pass over these considerations,‘be­  
cause I aw decidedly of opinion, that tbe jurisclicti^  
on of the courts of the United States depends  
clusively on the constitution and laws of tblXfoij^  
In consideting the jurisdiction &#x27;of the circuit  
courts as defiued in tbe judici’al art, and in theToa­  
slitutiou which that act carries into .execution, i£  
is worthy of observation that the jurisdiction of the  
court depends on the character ol the parties, and  
that only the court of that* district in -which the  
defendant resides or is found, can t-ke jurisdiction  
ol the cause. In a court so constituted, the argu­  
uirnt drawn from the total failure of justice, should  
a trespasser be dt-cEred to be only amenable to tbe  
rourt of that district m which the land lies, and id*  
which he will never be found, appeared to me to b*  
entitled to peculiar weight. But according to the­  
course ol the common law, the proress of the court  
must be executed ii. order to give it tbe light to try&#x27; &lt;­  
the cause, aod consequently tbe same delect of jus­  
lice might occur. Other judges have felt tbo?  
weight of this argument, and have straggled io«f*  
feclually against the distinction which produces (be &#x27;  
inconvenience of a clear right without a remedy.— -

lands, an action is sustainable wherever the defendant  
may be found. Yet in such case every difficulty may  
occur that presents itself in an action of trespass. An  
investigation of title may become necessary, a question  
of boundary may arise, and a survey may be essential  
to the full merits of the case. Yet these difficulties have  
not prevailed against the jurisdiction of the court. They  
are countervailed by the opposing consideration, that if  
the action be disallowed, the injured party may have a  
clear right without a remedy in a case where a person who  
has done the wrong, and who ought to make the compen-  
sation, is within the power of the court. That this con-  
sideration loses its influence where the action pursues  
anything not in the reach of the court is inevitably neces-  
sary, but for the loss of its influence, where the remedy  
is against the person, and is within the power of the  
court, I have not yet discovered a reason, other than a  
technical one, which can satisfy my judgment.”

the defendant. The question presented is, can  
the courts of this State take cognizance of actions  
to recover damages to real estate lying without  
the State; in other words, is such an action local  
or transitory in its nature? The history of the  
progress of the English common law respecting  
the locality of actions will aid in determining  
how this question ought to be decided on princi-  
ple. Originally, all actions were local. This  
arose out of the constitution of the old jury, who  
were but witnesses to prove or disprove the alle-  
gations of the parties, and hence every case had  
to be tried by a jury of the vicinage, who were  
presumed to have personal knowledge of the par-  
ties as well as of the facts. But, as circumstances  
and conditions changed, the courts modified the  
rule in fact, although not in form. For that pur-  
pose they invented a fiction by which a party was  
permitted to allege, under a videlicet, that the  
place where the contract was made or the trans-  
action occurred was in any county in England,  
The courts took upon themselves to determin
