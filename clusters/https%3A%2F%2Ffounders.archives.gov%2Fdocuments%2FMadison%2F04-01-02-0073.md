I have recd. your letter of the 18th. inst. informing me that “the Amn. Society for the encouragemt of domestic manufactures,” have been pleased to elect me one of its members.  
Altho’ I approve the policy of leaving to the sagacity of individuals, and to the impulse of private interest, the application of industry &amp; capital, I am equally persuaded, that in this as in other cases, there are exceptions to the general rule, which do not impair the principle of it. Among these exceptions, is the policy of encouraging domestic manufactures, within certain limits, and in reference to certain articles.  
Without entering into a detailed view of the subject, it may be remarked, that every prudent nation will wish to be independent of other nations, for the necessary articles of food, of raiment, and of defence; and particular considerations applicable to the U.S. seem to strengthen the motives to this independence.  
Besides the articles falling under this above description, there may be others for manufacturing which natural advantages exist, which require temporary interpositions for bringing them into regular &amp; successful activity.  
Where the fund of industry is acquired by emigrations from abroad, and not withdrawn nor witheld from other domestic employments, the case speaks for itself.  
I will only add, that among the articles of consumption and use the preference in many cases, is decided merely by fashion or by habits. As far as an equality, and still more where a real superiority is found in the articles manufactured at home, all must be sensible that it is politic and patriotic to encourage a preference for them; as affording a more certain source of supply for every class, and a more certain market for the surplus product of the Agricultural class.  
With these sentiments, I beg you to make my acknowlegements for the mark of distinction conferred on me; and which I accept from a respect for the Society and for its objects rather than from any hope of being useful as a member. To your self, Sir I tender my friendly respects.

these exceptions is the policy of encouraging do-

in reference to certain articles.  
  
Without entering into a detailed view of the

nation will ‘wish to be independent of other na-

Besides the .articles falling under the above  
description, there may be others, for manufactur-  
ing, which natural advantages exist, which require  
temporary interpositions for bringing them into  
segular and successful activity.  
  
Where the fund of industry is acquired from  
  
abroad, and not withdrawn; not withheld from  
other domestic employments, the case speaks for  
itself.  
I will only add, that among the articles ef con-  
sumption and use, the preference in many cases,  
is decided merely by fashion er habit. As far as

Montpelier, June 27, 1817.  
  
Sir—I have received your letter of the  
18th inst. informing me that the American  
Society for the encouragement of Domes-  
tic Manufactures, has been pleased to  
elect me one of its members.  
  
Although I approve of the policy of leav-  
ing to the sagacity of individuals, and to the  
impulse of private interest, the application  
of industry and capital, I am equally per-  
suaded that in this, as in other cases, there  
are exceptions to the general rule, which  
do not impair the’principle of it. Among  
these exceptions, is the policy of encoura-  
ging domestic manufactures, within cer-  
tain limits, and in reference to certain ar-  
ticles.  
  
Without entering into a detailed view  
of the subject, it may be remarked, that  
every prudent nation will wish to be inde-  
pendent of other nations, for the necessa-  
ry articles of food, of raiment, and of de-  
fence ; and particular considerations ap-  
plicable to the United States, seem to  
strengthen the motives to this indepen-  
dence.  
  
Besides the articles falling under the  
above description, there may be others,  
for manufacturing which, natural advanta-  
ges exist, which require temporary interpo-  
sitions for bringing them into regular and  
successful activity.  
  
Where the fund of industry is acquired  
from abroad, and not withdrawn, nor with-  
held from other domestic emplcyment:,  
the case speaks for itself.  
  
I will only add, that among the articles  
of consumption and use, the prefererice,  
in many cases, is decided merely by fash-  
ion orhabit. As far as equality, and still  
more, where a real superiority 1s found in  
the articles, manufactured at home, ail  
must be sensible, that it is politic and pat-  
riotic to encourage a preference of them,  
as affording a more certain source of supply  
for every class, and a more certain marke’  
for the surplus products of the agricultu-  
ral class.  
  
With these sentiments,I beg you to make  
my acknowledgments for the marks oi  
distinction conferred on me, and which |  
aecept from respect for the Society, and  
for its objects, rather than from any hope  
of being useful as a member. Tv yourself, }  
tender my friendly respects.
