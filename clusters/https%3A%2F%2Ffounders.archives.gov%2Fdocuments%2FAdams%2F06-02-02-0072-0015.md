The Quo Warranto begins “That Sir Henry Roswell and all the Massachusetts Company &amp;c used &amp;c in several Parts beyond the Seas out of this Kingdom of England, without any Warrant or royal Grant (meaning that quoad hoc the Royal Grant was void) the Liberties, Priviledges, and Franchises following &amp;c. 1.

Johnson, Winthrop, Dudley, and others, not the rascally Rabble of Romulus but Gentlemen of Family, Fortune, Education, and Figure, offered to go over with their Families, upon Condition that the Patent and Charter Should go with them.

The Report of the Committee is not on Record, but a Mr. White a Counsellor at Law was of the Company and his opinion was taken, and the Company concurred with it “that the Government and Patent Should be Settled in New England.” It is much to be wished that this important opinion of Mr. White was preserved. It might discover “Arcana.” It was certainly a wise and judicious opinion, in Point of Prudence and Policy, and has been vastly Successfull, for the Plantation probably had dwindled away, but for that Advice.

The King’s Bench, however, in six or seven years after,  
did not accord with them ; and upon a quo warranto in 11  
Car. 1, decreed the charter forfeited. The allegations were  
‘because Sir Henry Rosewell’ (and all the Massachusetts

power the said letters patent were, that they fail not to transmit  
the said patent letters by the return of the ship.’ A compliance
