Philadelphia, August 23, 1750  
We received your favour of the 16th instant. Mr. Peters will hardly have time to write to you per this post, and I must be short. Mr. Francis spent the last evening with me, and we were all glad to hear that you seriously meditate a visit after the middle of next month, and that you will inform us by a line when to expect you. We drank your health and Mrs. Johnson’s, remembering your kind entertainment of us at Stratford.  
  
I think with you, that nothing is of more importance for the public weal, than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: much more so than riches or arms, which, under the management of Ignorance and Wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for the safety of a people. And though the culture bestowed on many should be successful only with a few, yet the influence of those few and the service in their power, may be very great. Even a single woman that was wise, by her wisdom saved a city.  
I think also, that general virtue is more probably to be expected and obtained from the education of youth, than from the exhortation of adult persons; bad habits and vices of the mind, being, like diseases of the body, more easily prevented than cured.  
I think moreover, that talents for the education of youth are the gift of God; and that he on whom they are bestowed, whenever a way is opened for the use of them, is as strongly called as if he heard a voice from heaven: nothing more surely pointing out duty in a public service, than ability and opportunity of performing it.  
I have not yet discoursed with Dr. Jenney concerning your removal hither. You have reason, I own, to doubt, whether your coming on the foot I proposed would not be disagreeable to him; though I think it ought not: for should his particular interest be somewhat affected by it, that ought not to stand in competition with the general good; especially as it cannot be much affected, he being old, and rich, and without children. I will however learn his sentiments before the next post. But whatever influence they might have on your determinations about removing, they need have none on your intention of visiting; and if you favour us with the visit, it is not necessary that you should previously write to him to learn his dispositions about your removal; since you will see him, and when we are all together, those things may be better settled in conversation than by letters at a distance. Your tenderness of the church’s peace is truly laudable; but, methinks, to build a new church in a growing place is not properly dividing but multiplying; and will really be a means of increasing the number of those who worship God in that way. Many who cannot now be accommodated in the church, go to other places, or stay at home; and if we had another church, many who go to other places, or stay at home, would go to church. I suppose the interest of the church has been far from suffering in Boston by the building of two churches there in my memory. I had for several years nailed against the wall of my house a pigeon box that would hold six pair; and though they bred as fast as my neighbours’ pigeons, I never had more than six pair, the old and strong driving out the young and weak, and obliging them to seek new habitations. At length I put up an additional box with apartments for entertaining twelve pair more; and it was soon filled with inhabitants, by the overflowing of my first box, and of others in the neighbourhood. This I take to be a parallel case with the building a new church here.  
Your years I think are not so many as to be an objection of any weight, especially considering the vigour of your constitution. For the small-pox, if it should spread here, you might inoculate with great probability of safety; and I think that distemper generally more favourable here than farther northward. Your objection about the politeness of Philadelphia, and your imagined rusticity, is mere compliment; and your diffidence of yourself absolutely groundless.  
My humble respects, if you please, to your brethren at the commencement. I hope they will advise you to what is most for the good of the whole, and then I think they will advise you to remove hither.  
Please to tender my best respects and service to Mrs. Johnson and your son. I am, dear Sir, Your obliged and affectionate humble servant,

Philadelpthia, August 23, 1750.  
DEAR SIR,  
  
WE received your favour of the 16th instant. Mr. Peters will  
hardly have time to write to you per this post, and I must be shoft.  
Mr. Francis spent the last evening with me, and we were all glad to  
hear that you seriously meditate a visit after the middle of next month,  
and that you will inform&#x27;us by a line when to expect you. We drank  
  
your health and Mrs. Johnson’s, remembering your kind entertainment  
of us at Stratford.  
  
I think with you, that nothing is of more importance for the public  
weal, than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue. Wise  
and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: much more  
$o than riches or arms, which, under the management of Ignorance  
and Wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for  
the safety of a people. And though the culture bestowed on many  
should be successful only with a few, yet the influence of those few and  
the service in their power, may be very great. Even a single woman  
that was wise, by her wisdom saved a city.  
  
I think also, that general virtue is more probably to be expected  
and obtained from the education of youth, than from the exhortation  
of adult persons; bad habits and. vices of the mind, being, like diseases  
of the body, more easily prevented than cured.  
  
J think morcover, that talents for the education of youth are the  
gift of God; and that he on whom they are bestowed, whenever a way  
is opened for the use of them, is as strongly cadled as if he heard &amp;  
voice from heaven: nothing more surely pointing out duty in a public  
service, than adility and ofportunity of performing it.  
  
I have not yet discoursed with Dr. Jenney concerning your removal  
hither. You have reason, I own, to doubt, whether your coming on  
  
‘the foot I proposed would not be disagreeable to him ; though I think  
it ought not: for should his farticular interest be somewhat affected  
by it, that ought not to stand in competition with the general good ;  
especially as it cannot be much affected, he being old, and rich, and  
without children. I will however learn his sentiments before the next

about removing, they need have none on your intention of visiting ; and  
if you favour us with the visit, it is not necessary that you should previ-

“T think with you, that nothing is  
of more importance for the public

good men are, in my opinion, the  
strength of a State; much more so  
than riches or arms, which, under the  
management of ignorance and wick-  
edness, often draw on destruction,  
instead of providing forthe safety of  
the people. And though the culture  
bestowed on many should be success-  
ful only with the few, yet the influ-  
ence of those few, and the service in  
their power, may be very great.  
Even a single woman, that was wise,  
by her wisdom saved the city. I  
think also, that general virtue is more  
probably to be expected and obtained  
from the education of youth, than  
from the exhortation of adult per-  
sous; bad habits and vices of the  
mind being, like diseases of the body,  
more easily prevented than cured.”—

end of increased income. Franklin’s reply to this is  
characteristic :  
  
Your tenderness of the Church&#x27;s peace is truly laudable ; but,  
methinks, to build a new Church in a growing place is not prop-  
erly dividing, but multiplying, and will really be a means of in-  
creasing the number of those who worship Gop in that way.  
Many who cannot now be accommodated in the Church go to  
other places or stay at home, and if we had another Church many  
who go to other places or stay at home would goto Church. I  
suppose the interest of the Church has been far from suffering in  
Boston by the building of two new Churches there within my  
memory. I had for several years nailed against the wall of my  
house a pigeon-box that would hold six pairs; and, though they  
bred as fast as my neighbors’ pigeons, I never had more than six  
pairs, the old and strong driving out the young and weak and

additional box, with apartments for entertaining twelve pairs more,  
and it was soon filled with inhabitants by the overflowing of my  
first box and of others in the neighborhood. This I take to be  
a parallel case with the building a new Church here [p. 430].
