Address to the States by the United States in Congress Assembled  
  
April 26. 1783  
The prospect which has for some time existed, and which is now happily realized, of a successful termination of the war, together with the critical exigences of public affairs have made it the duty of Congress to review and provide for the debts which the war has left upon the U. S. and to look forward to the means of obviating dangers which may interrupt the harmony and tranquility of the Confederacy. The result of their mature and solemn deliberations on these great objects is contained in their several recommendations of the 18th. instant herewith transmitted. Although these recommendations speak themselves the principles on which they are founded, as well as the ends which they propose, it will not be improper to enter into a few explanations and remarks, in order to place in a stronger view the necessity of complying with them.  
The first measure recommended is effectual provision for the debts of the U. S. The amount of these debts as far as they can now be ascertained is 42000375 Dollars, as will appear by the Schedule No 1. To discharge the principal of this aggregate debt at once or in any short period is, evidently, not within the compass of our resources, and even if it could be accomplished, both the true interest and the ease of the community would require that the debt itself should be left to a course of gradual extinguishment, and certain funds be provided for paying in the mean time the annual interest. The amount of the annual interest, as will appear by the paper last referred to, is computed to be 2415956 Dollars. Funds therefore which will certainly and punctually produce this annual sum at least, must be provided.  
In devising these funds Congress did not overlook the mode of supplying the common Treasury provided by the articles of confederation. But after the most respectful consideration of that mode, they were constrained to regard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the public debt must be thrown. The delays and uncertainties incident to a revenue to be established and collected from time to time by thirteen independent authorities, is at first view irreconcileable with the punctuality essential in the discharge of the interest of a national debt. Our own experience, after making every allowance for transient impediments, has been a sufficient illustration of this truth. Some departure therefore in the recommendations of Congress from the f≈ìderal constitution, was unavoidable; but it will be found to be as small as could be reconciled with the object in view, and to be supported besides by solid considerations of interest and sound policy.  
The fund which first presented itself on this, as it did on a former occasion, was a tax on imports. The reasons which recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been stated in an act of which a copy No. 2 is now forwarded, and need not be here repeated. It will suffice to recapitulate, that taxes on consumption are always least burdensome, because they are least felt, and are borne too by those who are both willing and able to pay them; that of all taxes on consumption, those on foreign commerce are most compatible with the genius and policy of free States; that from the relative positions of some of the more commercial States, it will be impossible to bring this essential resource into use without a concerted uniformity; that this uniformity cannot be concerted through any channel so properly as through congress, nor for any purpose so aptly as for paying the debts of a Revolution, from which an unbounded freedom has accrued to commerce.  
In renewing this proposition to the States we have not been unmindful of the objections which heretofore frustrated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the duration of the revenue to the term of 25. years: and we have left to the States themselves the appointment of the officers who are to collect it. If the strict maxims of national credit alone were to be consulted, the revenue ought manifestly to be co-existent with the object of it; and the collection placed in every respect under that authority which is to dispense the former, and is responsible for the latter. These relaxations will we trust, be regarded on one hand as the effect of a disposition in Congs. to attend at all times to the sentiments of those whom they serve; and on the other hand as a proof of their anxious desire that provision may be made in some way or other for an honorable and just fulfilment of the engagements which they have formed.  
  
To render this fund as productive as possible and at the same time to narrow the room for collusions and frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan, to recommend a liberal duty on such articles as are most susceptible of a tax according to their quantity and are of most equal and general consumption; leaving all other articles, as heretofore proposed, to be taxed according to their value.  
The amount of this fund is computed to be 915956 Dollars. The estimates on which the computation is made, are detailed in paper No. 3. accuracy in the first essay on so complex &amp; fluctuating a subject is not to be expected. It is presumed to be as near the truth as the defect of proper materials would admit.  
The residue of the computed interest is 1500000 Dollars, and is referred to the States to be provided for by such funds as they may judge most convenient. Here again the strict maxims of public credit gave way to the desire of Congress to conform to the sentiments of their constituents. It ought not to be omitted however with respect to this portion of the revenue, that the mode in which it is to be supplied, varies so little from that pointed out in the articles of confederation, and the variations are so conducive to the great object proposed, that a ready and unqualified compliance on the part of the States may be the more justly expected. In fixing the quotas of this sum Congs. as may be well imagined, were guided by very imperfect lights and some Inequalities may consequently have ensued. These however can be but temporary, and as far as they may exist at all, will be redressed by a retrospective adjustment, as soon as a constitutional rule can be applied.  
The necessity of making the two foregoing provisions one indivisible and irrevocable act is apparent. Without the first quality, partial provision only might be made where complete provision is essential; nay as some States might prefer &amp; adopt one of the funds only, and the other States the other fund only, it might happen that no provision at all would be made: Without the second, a single State out of the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bankruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar to the establishment of national credit. Instead of enlarging on these topics, two observations are submitted to the justice and wisdom of the Legislatures. First: The present Creditors[,] or rather the domestic part of them, having either made their loans for a period which has expired, or having become creditors in the first instance involuntarily, are entitled on the clear principles of justice &amp; good faith, to demand the principal of their credits, instead of accepting the annual interest. It is necessary, therefore, as the principal can not be paid to them on demand, that the interest should be so effectually and satisfactorily secured, as to enable them if they incline, to transfer their stock at its full value. Secondly: if the funds be so firmly constituted as to inspire a thorough &amp; universal confidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the domestic debt which bears the high interest of 6 perCt., may be cancelled by other loans obtained at a more moderate interest? The saving by such an operation would be a clear one and might be a considerable one. As a proof of the necessity of substantial funds for the support of our credit abroad we refer to paper No 4  
Thus much for the interest of the national debt: For the discharge of the principal within the term limited, we rely on the natural increase of the revenue from Commerce, on requisitions to be made from time to time for that purpose, as circumstances may dictate, and on the prospects of vacant territory. If these resources should prove inadequate, it will be necessary, at the expiration of 25 years to continue the funds now recommended or to establish such others as may then be found more convenient.  
With a view to the resource last mentioned, as well as to obviate disagreeable controversies, and confusions, Congress have included in their present recommendations, a renewal of those of the 6th day of Septr. and of the 10th. day of October 1780. In both those respects a liberal and final accomodation of all interfering claims of vacant territory, is an object which cannot be pressed with too much solicitude.  
The last object recommended is a constitutional change of the rule, by which a partition of the common burdens is to be made. The expediency and even necessity of such a change has been sufficiently enforced by the local injustice and discontents which have proceeded from valuations of the soil in every State where the experiment has been made. But how infinitely must these evils be increased, on a comparison of such valuations among the states themselves! On whatever side indeed this rule be surveyed, the execution of it must be attended with the most serious difficulties. If the valuations be referred to the authorities of the several States, a general satisfaction is not to be hoped for: If they be executed by officers of the U. S. traversing the Country for that purpose, besides the inequalities against which this mode would be no security, the expence would be both enormous and obnoxious: If the mode taken in the act of the 17 day of feby last which was deemed on the whole least objectionable, be adhered to, still the insufficiency of the data to the purpose to which they are to be applied, must greatly impair, if not utterly destroy all confidence in the accuracy of the result; not to mention that as far as the result can be at all a just one, it will be indebted for the advantage to the principle on which the rule proposed to be substituted is founded. This rule altho‚Äô not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other that could be devised. The only material difficulty which attended it in the deliberations of Congress, was to fix the proper difference between the labor and industry of free inhabitants, and of all other inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual concessions, and if it should be supposed not to correspond precisely with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal spirit of accomodation among the several Legislatures, will prevail against little inequalities which may be calculated on one side or on the other. But notwithstanding the confidence of Congress as to the success of this proposition, it is their duty to recollect that the event may possibly disappoint them, and to request that measures may still be pursued for obtaining &amp; transmitting the information called for in the act of 17 feby. last, which in such event will be essential.  
The plan thus communicated and explained by Congress must now receive its fate from their Constituents. All the objects comprized in it are conceived to be of great importance to the happiness of this confederated republic, are necessary to render the fruits of the Revolution, a full reward for the blood, the toils, the cares and the calamities which have purchased it. But the object of which the necessity will be peculiarly felt, and which it is peculiarly the duty of Congress to inculcate, is the provision recommended for the national debt. Altho‚Äô this debt is greater than could have been wished, it is still less on the whole than could have been expected, and when referred to the cause in which it has been incurred, and compared with the burdens which wars of ambition and of vain glory have entailed on other nations, ought to be borne not only with cheerfulness but with pride. But the magnitude of the debt makes no part of the question. It is sufficient that the debt has been fairly contracted and that justice &amp; good faith demand that it should be fully discharged. Congress had no option but between different modes of discharging it. The same option is the only one that can exist with the States. The mode which has after long &amp; elaborate discussion been preferred, is, we are persuaded, the least objectionable of any that would have been equal to the purpose. Under this persuasion, we call upon the justice &amp; plighted faith of the several States to give it its proper effect, to reflect on the consequences of rejecting it, and to remember that Congress will not be answerable for them.  
  
If other motives than that of justice could be requisite on this occasion, no nation could ever feel stronger. For to whom are the debts to be paid?  
To an Ally, in the first place, who to the exertion of his arms in support of our cause, has added the succours of his Treasure; who to his important loans has added liberal donations; and whose loans themselves carry the impression of his magninimity and friendship. For more exact information on this point we refer to paper No. 5  
To individuals in a foreign country in the next place who were the first to give so precious a token of their confidence in our justice, and of their friendship for our cause; and who are members of a republic which was second in espousing our rank among nations. For the claims and expectations of this class of Creditors we refer to paper No. 6  
Another class of Creditors is that illustrious &amp; patriotic band of fellow Citizens, whose blood and whose bravery have defended the liberties of their Country, who have patiently borne, among other distresses the privation of their stipends, whilst the distresses of their Country disabled it from bestowing them; and who even now ask for no more than such a portion of their dues as will enable them to retire from the field of victory &amp; glory into the bosom of peace &amp; private citizenship, and for such effectual security for the residue of their claims as their Country is now unquestionably able to provide. For a full view of their sentiments and wishes on this subject we transmit the paper No. 7. and as a fresh &amp; lively instance of their superiority to every species of seduction from the paths of virtue &amp; of honor, we add the paper No. 8  
The remaining class of Creditors is composed partly of such of our fellow Citizens as originally lent to the public the use of their funds, or have since manifested most confidence in their Country by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of those whose property has been either advanced or assumed for the public service. To discriminate the merits of these several descriptions of creditors would be a task equally unnecessary &amp; invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favor of some than of others; the voice of policy, no less than of justice pleads in favor of all. A wise nation will never permit those who relieve the wants of their Country, or who rely most on its faith, its firmness and its resources, when either of them is distrusted, to suffer by the event.  
Let it be remembered finally that it has ever been the pride and boast of America, that the rights for which she contended were the rights of human nature. By the blessing of the Author of these rights on the means exerted for their defence, they have prevailed against all opposition and form the basis of thirteen independant States. No instance has heretofore occurred, nor can any instance be expected hereafter to occur, in which the unadulterated forms of Republican Government can pretend to so fair an opportunity of justifying themselves by their fruits. In this view the Citizens of the U. S. are responsible for the greatest trust ever confided to a Political Society. If justice, good faith, honor, gratitude &amp; all the other Qualities which enoble the character of a nation, and fulfil the ends of Government, be the fruits of our establishments, the cause of liberty will acquire a dignity and lustre, which it has never yet enjoyed; and an example will be set which can not but have the most favorable influence on the rights of mankind. If on the other side, our Governments should be unfortunately blotted with the reverse of these cardinal and essential Virtues, the great cause which we have engaged to vindicate, will be dishonored &amp; betrayed; the last &amp; fairest experiment in favor of the rights of human nature will be turned against them; and their patrons &amp; friends exposed to be insulted &amp; silenced by the votaries of Tyranny and Usurpation.

The fir≈øt mea≈øure recommended is, effectual provi≈øion for the  
  
  
as will appear by the ≈øchedule No. x. To difcharge the  
principal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any ≈øhort period,  
is evidently not within the compa≈øs of our re≈øources; and  
even if it could be accompli≈øhed, the ea≈øe of the community  
would require that the debt it≈øelf ≈øhould be left to a cour≈øe  
of gradual extingui≈øhment, and certain funds be provided for  
paying in the mean time the annual intere≈øt, The amount of  
the annual intere≈øt, as will appear by the paper la≈øt referred to,  
it computed to be 2 415,956 dollars. Funds, therefore,  
which will certainly and punctually produce this annual ≈øum,  
at lea≈øt,‚Äù mu≈øt be provided, | | .  
In devi≈øing the≈øe funds, Congre≈øs did not overlook the  
mode of ≈øupplying the common trea≈øury, provided by the  
articles of confederation ; but, after the mo≈øt re≈øpectful con-  
≈øideration of that mode, they were con≈øtrained to regard it  
as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the

F  
to time by thirteen independent authorities, is at fir≈øt view  
irreconcileable with the punctuality e≈ø≈øential in the di≈øcharge  
of the intere≈øt of a national debt. Our own experience, after  
making every allowance for tran≈øient impediments, has been a  
| ≈øufficient illu≈øtration of this truth Some departure, there-  
fore. in the recommendations of Congre≈øs, from he federal  
con≈øtitution was unavoidable; but it will be found to be as  
≈ømall as could be reco ciled with the object in view, and to  
be ≈øupported be≈øides by ≈øolid con≈øiderations of intere≈øt and  
≈øound pylicy. -  
  
The fund which fir≈øt pre≈øented itfelf on this, as it did on  
a former occa≈øion. was a tax on imports. The rea≈øons which  
recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been  
≈øtated in an act. of which a copy, No 2, is now forwarded,  
and need not be here repeated It will ≈øuffice to recapitulate,  
that taxes on con≈øumption are always leaft burden≈øome; √æe-  
cau≈øe they are lea≈øt felt and are. borne too by tho≈øe who are  
both willing and able to pay them; that of all taxes on con-  
≈øomprion. tho≈øe on foreign commerce are mo≈øt compatible  
with the genius and policy of free ≈øtates; that from the relative  
po≈øitions of ≈øome of the more commercial ≈øtates, it will be  
  
  
concerted uniformity : that this uniformity cannot be con-  
  
  
nor for any purpoie ≈øo aptly as for paying the debts of a  
  
  
to commerce.  
In renewing this propo≈øition to the ≈øtates, we have not | been  
  
  
unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the daration of  
the revenue to the term of 25 years; and we have left to the  
≈øtates them≈øelves the appointment of the officers who are to  
colle&amp; it. If the ≈øtrict maxims of national credit alone were  
to be con≈øulted, the revenue ought manife≈øtly to be coexi≈øtent  
with the object of it, and the collection placed in every re≈øpect

re≈øpon≈øible for the latter. The≈øe relaxations will, we tru≈øt,  
  
  
gre≈øs to attend at all times to the ≈øeatiments of tho≈øe whom  
they ≈øerve. and on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious

To render this fund as productive as po≈ø≈øible, and at the  
≈øame time to narrow the room for collu≈øions and frauds, it has  
  
  
liberal duty on ≈øuch articles as are mo≈øt ≈øu≈øceptible of a tax  
according to their quantity, and are of mo≈øt equal and general  
con≈øumption ; leaving all other articles, as heretofore propo≈øed,  
to be taxed according to their value. |  
  
The amount of this fund is computed to be 915,956 dol-  
lars. The e≈øtimates on which the computation is made. are  
detailed in paper No. 3. Accuracy in the fir≈øt e≈ø≈øay on fo com-  
plex and fluctuatiog a ≈øubject is not to be expected It is  
  
  
rials would admit. f  
The refidue of the computed intere≈øt is 1,500,000 dollars,  
and is referred to the ≈øtates to be provided for by ≈øuch funds  
as they may judge mo≈øt convenient. Here again. the ≈øtrict  
maxims of public credit gave way to the defire of Congre≈øs  
to conform to the ≈øentiments of their con≈øtituents. It ought  
not to be omitted, however, with re≈øpect to this portion of  
the revenue, that the mode in which it is to be ≈øupplied, varies  
≈øo little from that pointed out in the articles of confederation,  
and the variations. are ≈øo coriducive to the great object pro-  
po≈øed, that a ready and unqualified compliance oa the part of  
the ≈øtates may be the more ju≈øtly expected. In fixing the  
quotas of this ≈øum, Congre≈øs, as may be well imagined, were  
guided by very imperfect lights, and ≈øome inequalities may  
con≈øequently have en≈øued. The≈øe, however, can be but tem-  
porary, and as far as they may exi≈øt at all, will be redre≈ø≈øed  
by a tetro≈øpect ve adju≈øtment, as ≈øoon as a con≈øtitutional rule  
can be applied. The nece≈ø≈øity of making the two foregoing  
provi≈øions one indivi≈øible and irrevocable act, is apparent.  
Without the fir≈øt quality, partial provi≈øion only might be made  
where complete provi≈øion is eflential ; nay, as ≈øome ftates  
might prefer and adopt one of the funds only, and the other  
≈øtates the other fund only it might happen that no provi≈øion  
  
  
-the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bank-  
ruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar  
to the e≈øtabli≈øhment of national credit. In≈øtead of enlarging  
on the≈øe topics, two ob≈øervations ate ≈øubmitted to the ju≈øtice  
and wi≈ødom of the Jegi≈ølatures. Fir≈øt : The pre≈øent creditors,  
  
  
* - . 4 4 loans  
  
As  
ha er  
  
9  
loans for a period which has expired. or having become credi-  
tors ia the fir≈øt inftance ƒ©avoluatarily, are iatitled oa the clear  
principles of ju≈øtice and god faith, to demand the principal  
of ther credits, in≈øtead of accepting the annual intere≈øt, - It is,  
sece≈ø≈øary, therefore, as the principal cannot be paid to them  
on demand, that the iatere≈øt ≈øhould be fo effectually and ≈øatis-  
factorily ≈øecured, as to enable them, if they incline, to transfer  
their ≈øtock at its full value. Secondly : If the funds be ≈øo  
firmly con≈øtituted as t√≤ in≈øpire a thorough. and univer≈øal con-  
fidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the dome≈øtic  
debt, which bears the high intere≈øt of fix per cent. may be can -  
eelled by other loans obtained at a more moderate intere≈øt ?  
The ≈øaving by ≈øuch an operation, would be a clear one, and  
might be a con≈øiderable one; As a proof of the nece≈ølity of  
≈øub≈øtantial funds for a ≈øupport of our credit abroad, we tefer  
to paper No. 4. | |  
Thus much for the intereft of the national debt: For the  
_ di≈øcharge of the principal within the term limited, we rely on  
the natural increa≈øe of the revenue from commerce, on requi-  
ations to be made from time to time for that purpo≈øe, as cir-  
cum≈øtances may dictate, and on the pro≈øpect of vacant territory.  
If the≈øe re≈øources ≈øhould prove inadequate, it will be nece≈ø≈øary,  
at the expiration of 25 years. to continue the funds now re-  
commended, or to e≈øtabli≈øh ≈øuch others as may then be found  
more conventent. . 2  
With a view to the re≈øour≈øe la≈øt mentioned, as well as to  
obviate di≈øagteeable controver≈øies and confu≈øions, Congre≈øs have  
. included in their pre≈øent recommendations, a renewal of tho≈øe  
of the 6th day of September and of the toth day of October  
1780. Ia both tho≈øe re≈øpects, a liberal and final accommo-  
dation of all interfering claims of vacant territory, is an object  
which cannot be pre≈ø≈øed with too much ≈øolicitude. |  
The laft object recommended is a con≈øtitutional change of  
  
the rule, by which a partition of the common burdens is to be  
made. The expedieney and even nece≈ølity of ≈øuch a change  
has been ≈øuffictently inforced by the local inju≈øtice and  
di≈øcontents which have proceeded from valuations of the  
≈øoil in every ≈øtate where the experiment has been made. ‚Äî  
  
But how infinitely mu≈øt the≈øe evils be increa≈øed, on a com-  
pari≈øon of ≈øuch valuations among the the ≈øtates them≈øelves !-  
On whatever ≈øide indeed this rule be ≈øurveyed, the execution  
of it ma≈øt be attended with the mo≈øt ≈øerious difficulties. If  
the  
  
‚Äû  
  
  
≈øtates, a general ≈øatisfaction is not to be hoped for: If they  
be executed by. officers of the United States traver≈øing the  
  
  
which this mode would be no ≈øecurity, the expence wovld  
be both enormous and abnoxious : If the mode taken in the  
act of the 19th day of February la≈øt, which was deemed on  
  
  
ency of the data to the purpo≈øe to which they arg to be ap-  
  
  
in the accuracy of the re≈øult ; not to mention that as far as  
the re≈øult can be at all a ju≈øt one, it will be indebted for the  
advantage to the principle on which the rule propo≈øed to be  
≈øub≈øtituted is founded. This 1ule, altho&#x27; not free from ob-  
je ctions, is liable to fewer than any other that could be de-  
vi≈øed. The only material difficulty which attended it in the  
deliberations of Congre≈øs, was 10 fix the proper difference  
between the labour and indu≈øtry of free inhabitants, and  
  
  
The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual con-  
ce≈ø≈øions ; ard if it ≈øhould be ≈øuppo≈øed not to corre≈øpond preci≈øely  
with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal  
≈øpirit of accomodation among the ≈øeyeral legi≈ølatures, will prevail  
again≈øt little inequalities which may be calculated on one fide  
or on the other. Pur notwith≈øtanding the confiderce of  
  
  
to recollect that the event may po≈ø≈øibly di≈øappoint them, and  
to reque≈øt that mea≈øures may ≈øtill be pur≈øued for obtaining  
and trran≈ømittivg the information called for in the act of the  
19th of February la≈øt, which in ≈øuch event will be e≈ø≈øential.  
The plan thus communicated and explained by Congre≈øs  
mu≈øt now receive its fate from their cop≈øtituents. All the  
  
  
tance to the happine≈øs of this ccnfederated republic; are  
nece≈ø≈øary to render the fruits of the revolution, a full rewzrd  
for the blood, the toils, the cares and the calamities which  
have purcha≈øed ir, But the object of Which tbe nece≈ø≈øity  
  
  
Congre≈øs to inc√πlcate, is the provi≈øion recommended for the  
  
  
been wi≈øhed, it is ≈øtill le≈øs on the whole than could have been  
  
  
incurred,  
  
‚Äî  
  
(#3  
incurred, and compared with the burdens which wars of ambi-  
- tion and vain-glory have entailed on other nations. ought ta  
  
be borne not only with chearfulne≈øs but with pride, But the  
magnitude of the debt makes no part of the que≈øtion. It is  
  
  
tice and good faith demand that it ≈øhould be fully di≈øcharged.  
Congre≈øs had no option but between different modes of di≈ø-  
ebarging it. The ≈øame option is the only one that can exi≈øt  
- with the ≈øtates. The mode which has after long and elaborate  
* di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, been preferred. is, we are per≈øuaded, the lea≈øt ob-  
- jeQionable of any that would have been equal to the pwr po≈øe.  
Under this per≈øua≈øion, we call upon the ju≈øtice aud plighted  
faith of the ≈øeveral ≈øtates to give it its proper effect, to reflect  
en the con≈øequences of rejecting it, and to remember _  
Congre≈øs will not be an≈øwerable for them.  
  
If other motives than that of ju≈øtice could be requi≈øite on,  
this occa≈øion, no nation could ever feel ≈øtronger ; for to whom  
are the debts to be paid? To an aLLy, in the fir≈øt place, who  
to the exer ion of his arms in {≈øupport of our cau≈øe, has added  
the ≈øaccours of his trea≈øure; who, to his i important loans, has  
added liberal donations; and who≈øe loans them≈øelves carry  
the impre≈øfion of his me gnanin. ity and friend≈øhip. For more  
exe infor mation on this point me refer to paper No. 5.  
  
To individuals in a foreign country, in the next place, who  
were the fir≈øt to give fo precious a token of their confidence in  
our ju≈øtice and of their friend≈øhip for our cau≈øe, and who are  
  
  
rank among nations. For the claims and expectations of this  
Cla≈øs of creditors we refer to paper No 6.  
  
Another cla≈øs of creditors is, that iliu≈øtriou and patriotic  
band e feil;w citizens, who≈øe blood and who≈øe bravery have  
defended the liberties of their country, who have patiently  
borne, 2mong other di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, the privation of their ≈øtipends,  
whil≈øt the di≈øtre≈ø≈øes of their country di≈øabled it from beitow-  
ing them; and who, even row atk no more than ≈øuch a por-  
tion of their dues as will enable them to retire from the field  
of victory and glory irto the bo≈øom of peace and private citi-  
zen≈øhip, and for {och effectual ≈øecurity for the re≈øidve of their  
claims, as their country is cow unque≈øtionably able to provide.  
For a full view of their ≈øentiments and wi≈øhes on this ≈øubject,  
we tran≈ømit the paper No. 7; and as a fre≈øh and lively inftance  
of their {uperiority to every ≈øpecies of ≈øeduction from the paths  
of virtue and of honour, we add paper No. 8.

gard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form inte  
which the public debt mu≈øt be throwu. The delays and  
uncertainties Incident to a revenue to be e≈øtabli≈øhe d ande  
collected from time to time by thirteen independent au-  
thorities, is, at fir≈øt view, irreconcileable with the punctu-  
ality e≈ø≈øential in the di≈øcharge of the intere≈øt of a nation-  
al debt. Our own experience, after making every altow.  
ance for tran≈øient impediments, has been a ≈øufficient il.  
Ju≈øtration of this truth. Some departure, therefore, in  
the recommendations of Congre≈øs, from the f≈ìderal con-  
≈øtitution, was unavoidable; but it will be found to be dd  
mall as could be reconciled; with the object in view, and  
to be ≈øuppÃÉorted be≈øides by ≈øolid con≈øiderations of intere≈øt  
and ≈øound policy. FTF N  
- The fund which fir≈øt pre≈øented it≈øelf on this, as it  
did on a former occa≈øion, was a tax on imports. The  
rea≈øons which recommended this branch of revenue, have  
heretofore been ≈øtated in an act, of which a copy, No. 2,  
is now forwarded, and need not be; here repeated; It  
_ will ≈øuffice to recapitulate, that taxes on con≈øumption  
are always lea≈øt; burthen ≈øome, becau≈øe they are lea≈øt felt,  
and are botrne too by tho≈øe who are both willing and  
able to pay them: that of all taxes on con≈øamption, tho≈øe  
on foreigu commerce are mo≈øt compatible with the geni-  
us and policy of free ≈øtates: that from the relative po≈øiti -  
ons of ≈øome of the more commercial ≈øtates, it will be im*  
po≈ø≈øible to bring this efizncial re≈øource into u≈øe without  
nu concerted uniformity : that this uniformity cannot be  
concerted through any channel. ≈øo properly as through  
Congre≈øs, nor for any purpo≈øe ≈øo aptly as for paying the  
debts of a revolution, from which au unbouuded freedom  
Has accrued to commet ce. 1  
In renewing this propo≈øition to the ≈øtates, we have not  
been unmindful of the objections which heretofore fru≈ø.  
trated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited  
the duration of the revenue to the term of 25 years; and  
we have lefc to the ≈øtates them≈øelves the appointment of  
the officers who are to collect it, If the ≈øtrict maxims of  
national credit alone were to be con≈øulted, the revenue  
ought manife≈øtly to be coexi≈øtent with the object of ir, and  
_ the collection placed in every re≈øpect under that authori-  
ty which is to di≈øpen≈øe the former, and 1s re≈øpou≈øible for  
the latter. The≈øe relaxations will, we tru≈øt, be regarded on  
one haud as the effect of a di≈øpo≈øition in Congre≈øs toattend at  
all times to the ≈øentiments of tho≈øe whom they ≈øerve, aud

on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious de≈øire that  
ovi≈øion may be made in ≈øome way or other for an ha-  
nourable and ju≈øt fulfilment of the engagements which  
they have formed. F ¬£0  
To render this fund as productive. as po≈ø≈øible, and at  
  
the ≈øame time to narrow the room for collu≈øions and  
frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan,  
  
  
≈øa≈øceptible of a tax according to their quantity, and are  
  
  
articles, as hereto  
  
ore ptopo≈øed, to be taxed according to  
their vue. 7 9060 5  
  
  
dollars. The e≈øtimates on. which the computation is  
made, are detailed in paper No. 3. Accuracy in the fir≈øt  
e≈ø≈øay on ≈øo complex and fluctuating a ≈øubject is not to be  
  
  
defect of proper materials would admit. =  
The re≈øidue of the computed intere≈øt:is 1,500,000 dol-  
lars, and is referred to the ≈øtates to be provided for by ≈øuch  
  
  
the ≈øtrict maxims of public credit gave way to the defire  
  
  
tuents. It onght not to be omitted, however, with re-  
≈øpect to this portion of the revenue, that the mode in  
  
  
ed out in the articles of confederation, and the variations  
are ≈øo conducive to tlie great object propo≈øed, that a rea;  
  
  
may con≈øequently have en≈øued, The≈øe, however, can be  
but temporary, and as far as they may exi≈øt at all, will be  
redre≈ø≈øed by a retro≈øpective adju≈øtment, as ≈øoon as a con-  
≈øtitutional rule can be applied. 35h e  
The nece≈ø≈øity of making the two foregoing provi≈øions  
one indivi≈øible and irrevocable act, is apparent. Without  
the. fir≈øt quality, partial provi≈øion only might be made  
where compleat provi≈øion is e≈ø≈øential z nay, as ≈øome ≈øtates  
  
  
ther ≈øtates the other fund only, it might happen that no  
provi≈øion at all would be made: without the ≈øecondg a  
≈øingle ≈øtate our of the thirteen might at any time involve  
the nation in bankruptey, the mere practicability of which  
  
Eren  
  
  
dit. In≈øtead of enlarging on the≈øe topics, two ob≈øerva-  
tons ere ≈øubmitied to the ju≈øtice and wi≈ødom of the legi≈ø-  
Jatures. Fir≈øt: The pre≈øent creditors, or rather the do-  
me≈øtic part of them, having eitber made their loans for  
a period which has expired, or having become creditors  
iu the fir≈øt in≈øtance involuntarily, are entitled, on the clear  
  
  
cipal of their credirs, in≈øtead of accepting the annual in-  
  
  
be paid to them on demand, that the intere≈øt ≈øhould be  
≈øo effectually and ≈øatisfactorily ≈øecured, as to enavie them *  
if they incline, to transfer their ≈øtock at its Full value.  
Secondly : if the funds be ≈øo firmly con≈øtituted as to in-  
Jpire-a thorough and univer≈øal confidence, may it not be  
hoped, that the capital of the dome≈øtic debt, which bears  
the high intere≈øt of ≈øix per cent. may be ccncelled by o-  
  
  
≈øaving by ≈øuch an operation, would be a clear one, and  
might be a con≈øiderable one. As a proof of the nece≈ølity of  
≈øub≈øtantial funds for a ≈øupport of our credit abroad, we  
refer to paper No. 4. | | 5  
  
Thus much for the intere≈øt of the national debt: for  
the di≈øcharge of the principal, within the term limited,  
we rely on the natural enerea≈øe of the revenue from eom :  
  
  
that purpo≈øe, as circum≈øtances may diftate, and on the  
pro≈øpect of vacant territory, If the≈øe-re≈øources ≈øhould  
prove inadequate, it will be nece≈øfary, at the expiration  
  
  
mended, or to eftab}i≈øh ≈øuck others as may then be found  
more convenient.  
With a view to the re≈øource la≈øt mentioned, as well as  
to obviate di≈øagreeable controver≈øies and confu≈øiuns, Con-  
gre≈øs have included in their pre≈øent recommendations, a  
renewal of tho≈øe of the 6th day of September, and of the  
toth day of October, 1780. In both tho≈øe re≈øpects, a  
li beral and final accommodation of all interfering claims  
of vacant territory, is an object Which cannot be pre≈ø≈øed  
with too much ≈øolicitude. | 1 |  
The la≈øt object recommended is a con≈øtitutional change  
of the rule, by which a partition of the common burdens  
is go be made. The expediency and even nece≈ø≈øity ot ≈øuch  
a change has been ≈øufficiently inforced: by the local inju≈ø-  
tice and di≈øcontents which have proeceded from valuati-  
ons of the ≈øoil in every ≈øtate where the experiment has  
  
been

crea≈øed, on a compari≈øon of ≈øuch valuations among the  
ates them≈øelves! On whatever fide indeed this rule be  
  
  
molt ≈øerious difficulties. If the valuations be referred to  
the authorities of the ≈øeveral ≈øtates, a general ≈øatisfacti-  
  
  
of the United States traver≈øing the country for that pur-  
po≈øe, be≈øides the inequalities again≈øt which this mode  
would be no ≈øecurity, the expence would be both enormous  
  
and obnoxious : If the mode taken in the act of the 19th  
day of February la≈øt, which was deemed on the whole  
lea≈øt objectionable, be adhered to, ≈øtill the in≈øufficieney  
  
of the data to the purpo≈øe to which they are to be appli.  
  
ed, mu≈øt greatly impair, if not utterly de≈øtroy all confi-  
dence in the accuracy of the re≈øult ; not to mention that  
as far as the re≈øult can be at all a ju≈øt one, it will be indebt-  
ed for the advantage to the principle on which the rule  
propo≈øed to be ≈øubitituted&#x27;is founded. This rule, altho‚Äú  
not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other  
that could be devi≈øed. The only material difficulty  
which attended it in the deliberations of Congre≈øs was,  
ro fix the proper difference between the labour and in-  
  
  
The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual  
conce≈ø≈øions; and if it ≈øhould be ≈øuppo≈øed not to corre≈ø -  
pond preci≈øely with the fact, no doubt ought to be enter.  
tained that an equal ≈øpirit of uccommodation among the  
  
  
which may be calculated on one fide or on the other.  
But notwith≈øtanding the confidence of Congre≈øs, as to the  
≈øucce≈øs of this propo≈øition, it is their duty to recollect  
that the event may po≈ø≈øibly di≈øappoint&#x27; them, and to re-  
que≈øt that mea≈øures may ≈øtill be pur≈øued for obraining and  
tran≈ømitting the information called for in the act of the  
17th of February la≈øt, which in ≈øuch event will be e≈ø≈øential.  
The plan, thus communicated and explained by Con-  
e≈øs, mnit now receive its fate from their con≈øtituents.  
All the objects compri≈øed in it are conceived to be of preat  
importance to the happine≈øs of this confederated republic;  
are nece≈ø≈øary to render the fruits of the revo}viion, a full

It is ≈øufficient that the debt has been fairly contracted, and  
that ju≈øtice and good faith demand that it ≈øhould be fully

has, after long and elaborate di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, been preferred, is,

which they are founded, as well as the  
ends which they propo≈øe, it will not be im-  
proper to enter into a few explanations and  
  
remarks, in order to place in a ≈øtronger  
view the nece≈ø≈øity of complying with them.  
  
Tur fir≈øt mea≈øure recommended is, effec-  
tual provi≈øion for the debts of the United  
States. The amount of the≈øe debts, as far  
as they can now be a≈øcertained, is,  
42,000,375 dollars, as will appear by the  
≈øchedule No. I. To di≈øcharge the prin-  
cipal of this aggregate debt at once, or in  
any ≈øhort period, is evidently not within  
the compa≈øs of our re≈øources; and even  
if it could be accompli≈øhed, the ea≈øe of tlie  
community would require, that the debt  
it≈øelf ≈øhould be left to a cour≈øe of gradual  
extingui≈øhment, and certain funds be pro-  
vided for paying in the mean time the an-  
nual intere≈øt. The amount of the annual  
Intere≈øt, as will appear by the paper la≈øt re-  
ferred to, is computed to be 2,415,956 dol-  
lars. Funds, therefore, which will cer-  
  
tainly  
  
  
In devi≈øing the≈øe funds, Congre≈øs did not  
overlook the mode of ≈øupplying the com-  
mon trea≈øury, provided by the articles of  
confederation; but after the mo≈øt re≈øpect-  
ful con≈øideration of that mode, they were  
con≈øtrained to regard it as inadequate and  
inapplicable to the form into which the  
public debt mu≈øt be thrown. The delays  
and uncertainties incident to a revenue to  
be e≈øtabli≈øhed and collected from time to  
time by thirteen independent authorities,  
is at fir≈øt view irreconcileable with the punctu-  
ality e≈ø≈øential in the di≈øcharge of the intere≈øt  
of a national debt. Our own experience,  
after making every allowance for tran≈øient  
impediments, has been a ≈øufficient illu≈øtra-  
tion of this truth. Some departure, there-  
fore, in the recommendations of Congre≈øs,  
from the federal con≈øtitution, was unavoid-  
able ; but it will be found to be as ≈ømall as

Tux fund which fir≈øt pre≈øented it≈øelf on  
this, as it did on a former occa≈øion, was a  
tax on imports. The rea≈øons which recom-  
  
  
tofore been ≈øtated in an act, of which a  
  
  
recapitulate, that taxes on con≈øumption are  
always lea≈øt burden≈øome, becau≈øe they are  
  
  
commerce are mo≈øt compatible with the ge-  
nius and policy of free ≈øtates : that from  
the relative po≈øitions of ≈øome of the more  
commercial ≈øtates, it will be impo≈ø≈øible to  
bring this e≈ø≈øential re≈øource into u≈øe without  
a concerted uniformity : that this unifor-  
mity cannot be concerted through any chan-

In renewing this oi to the lates,  
we have not been unmindful of the objee-  
tions which heretofore fru≈øtrated the una¬ª  
nimous adoption of it. We have limited  
the duration of the revenue to the term of  
twenty-five years; and we have left to the  
≈øtates them≈øelves the appointment of the  
officers who are to collect it. If the ≈øtrict  
maxims of national credit alone were to be  
con≈øulted, the revenue ought manife≈øtly to  
be coexi≈øtent with the object of it, and the  
collection placed in every re≈øpect under chat  
authority which is to di≈øpen≈øe the former, |  
and is re≈øpon≈øible for the latter. The≈øe re-  
laxations will, we tru≈øt, be regarded on one  
hand as the effect of a di≈øpo≈øition 1 in Con-  
gre≈øs to attend at all times to the ≈øentiments  
of tho≈øe whom they ≈øerve, and on the  
  
other hand, as a proof of their anxious de-  
≈øire that provi≈øion may be made in ≈øome

way or other for an honourable ard ju≈øt  
  
fulfilment of the engage which they  
have formed.  
  
To render this fund as productive as po≈ø-  
fible, and at the ≈øame time to narrow the  
room for collu≈øions and frauds, it has been  
Judged an improvement of the plan, to re-  
commend a liberal duty on ≈øuch articles as  
are mo≈øt ≈øu≈øceptible of a tax according to  
their quantity, and are of mo≈øt equal and  
general con≈øumption; leaving all other ar-  
ticles, as heretofore propo≈øed, to be taxed  
according to their value.  
  
Tux amount of this fund is computed  
to be 915,956 dollars. The e≈øtimates on  
which the computation 1s made, are detailed  
in paper No. III. Accuracy in the fir≈øt e≈ø-  
≈øay on ≈øo complex and fluctuating a ≈øubject  
is not to be expected. It is pre≈øumed to be  
as near the truth as the defect of proper  
materials would admit,  
  
  
  
Tres refidue of the computed intere≈øt is  
1,500,000 dollars, andis referred to the ≈øtates  
to be provided for by ≈øuch funds as they may  
judge mo≈øt convenient. Here again the ≈øtrict  
maxims of public credit gave way to the de-  
fire of Congre≈øs to conform to the ≈øenti-  
ments of their con≈øtituents. It ought not  
to be omitted, however, with re≈øpect to this  
portion of the revenue, that the mode in  
which it is to be ≈øupplied, varies fo little  
from that pointed out in the articles of  
confederation, and the variations are ≈øo con-  
ducive to the great object propo≈øed, that a  
  
ready and unqualified compliance on the  
part of the ≈øtates may be the more ju≈øtlx  
  
expected. In fixing the quotas of this ≈øum,  
Congre≈øs, as may be well imagined, were  
guided by very imperfect lights, and ≈øome  
  
inequalities may con≈øequently have en≈øued.  
The≈øe, however, can be but temporary;  
and, as far as they may exi≈øt at all, will be  
redre≈ø≈øed by a retro≈øpective adju≈øtment, as  
≈øoon as a con≈øtitutional rule can be applied.

Tux nece≈ø≈øity of making the two forego-  
ing provi≈øions one indivi≈øible and irrevoca-  
ble act, is apparent. Without the fir≈øt  
quality, partial provi≈øion only might be  
  
  
one of the funds only, and the other ≈øtates  
the other fund only, it might happen that  
  
  
the ≈øecond, a ≈øingle ≈øtate out of the Thirteen  
  
  
bankruptcy; the mere practicability of which  
would be a fatal bar to the e≈øtabli≈øhment of  
  
  
the≈øe topics, two ob≈øervations are ≈øubmitted.  
to the ju≈øtice and wi≈ødom of the legi≈ølatures.  
Fir≈øt : The pre≈øent creditors, or rather the  
  
  
their loans for a period which has expired,  
or having become creditors in the fir≈øt in-  
≈øtance involuntarily, are intitled, on the  
clear principles of ju≈øtice and good faith, ..  
to demand the principal of their credits,  
in≈øtead of accepting the annual intere≈øt. It  
  
| | 18  
  
1  
  
is nece≈ø≈øary, therefore, as the principal can-  
not be paid to them on demand, that the 1 in-  
tere≈øt ≈øhould be ≈øo effectually and ≈øatisfacto-  
rily ≈øecured, as to enable them, if they in-  
eline, to transfer their ≈øtock at its full value.  
Secondly : If the funds be fo firmly con≈øti-  
tuted as to in≈øpire a thorough and univer≈øal  
confidence, may it not be hoped, that the  
capital of the dome≈øtic debt, which bears  
the High intere≈øt of fix per cent. may be  
cancelled by other loans obtained at a more  
moderate intere≈øt? The ≈øaving by ≈øuch an  
operation would be a clear one, and might |  
be a con≈øiderable one. As a proof of the  
nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øub≈øtantial funds for a ≈øupport  
of our credit abroad, we refer to No. IV.  
  
Tuvs much for the intere≈øt of the na-  
tional debt: For the di≈øcharge of the prin-  
cipal within the term limited, we. rely e on  
the natural increa≈øe of the revenue from  
commerce, on requi≈øitions to be made from  
time to time for that purpo≈øe, as circum-

vacant territory. If the≈øe re≈øources ≈øhould  
  
prove inadequate, it will be nece≈ø≈øary, at  
the expiration of twenty-five years, to con-  
tinue the funds now recommended, or to  
e≈øtabli≈øh ≈øuch others 3 as may then be found  
more convenient. |  
  
WIxx a view to the re≈øource la≈øt mention-  
ed, as well as to obviate di≈øagreeable gon-  
trover≈øies and confu≈øions, Congre≈øs hayg in-  
cluded, in their pre≈øent recommendations,  
a renewal of tho≈øe of the 6th day of Sep-  
tember, and of the 10th day of Octob  
1780. In both tho≈øe re≈øpects, a liberal an  
final accommodation of all interfering claims  
  
of vacant territory, is an object which can-  
not be pre≈ø≈øed with too much ≈øolicitude.  
  
Tux la≈øt object recommended is a con≈øti-  
tutional change of the rule, by which a par-  
tition of the common burdens is to be made.  
The expediency. and even nece≈ø≈øity, of ≈øuch.  
a change has: been ≈øufficiently inforced by  
the local inju≈øtice and di≈øcontents which  
  
774 | have  
  
  
  
  
* raluations among the ≈øtates them≈øelves ! On  
whatever fide indeed this rule be ≈øurveyed,  
  
the gyecution of it mu≈øt be attended with  
  
the mo≈øt ≈øerious difficulties. If the valua-  
  
tions be referred to the authorities of the  
≈øeveral ≈øtates, a general ≈øatisfaction is not to  
5 hoped for: If they be executed by officers  
of the United States traver≈øing the country  
for that purpo≈øe, be≈øides the inequalities  
again≈øt which this mode would be no ≈øecurity,  
the expence would be both enormous and ob- |  
noxious. If the mode taken in the act of  
the 17th day of February la≈øt, which was  
deemed on the whole lea≈øt objectionable, be  
adhered to, ≈øtil] the in≈øufficiency of the data  
to the purpo≈øe to which they are to be ap-  
**plied, mu≈øt greatly impair, if not utterly de-  
  
≈øtroy, all confidence in the accuracy of the  
re≈øult; not to mention that, as far as the  
  
re≈øult can be at all a ju≈øt one, it will be in-

on which the rule propa≈øed to be luke 4  
ted is founded. This rule, although not  
free from objections, i is liable to fewer than  
  
any other that could be devi≈øed. The onl  
material difficulty which attended it in th 4  
  
deliberations of Congre≈øs, was to fi  
  
proper difference between the 3  
indu≈øtry of free inhabitants, and of all other  
inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed  
on was the effect of mutual conce≈ø≈øion  
and if it ≈øhould be ≈øuppo≈øed not to corre=  
≈øpond preci≈øely with the fact, no doubt  
  
ought to be entertained that an equal ≈øpirit  
of accommodation among the ≈øeveral legi≈ø-  
  
| tures, will prevail again≈øt little inequali-  
ties which may be calculated on one fide or  
on the qther. But notwithftanding the  
confidence of Congre≈øs as to the ≈øucce≈øs of  
this propo≈øition, it is their duty to recollect 0 |  
that the event may poffibly di≈øappoint them, :

of great importanee to the happine≈øs of  
this confederated republic; are nece≈ø≈øary to  
er the fruits of the revolution, a full  
reward for the blood, the toils, the cares  
and the calamities which have purcha≈øed it.  
But the object of which the nece≈ø≈øity will  
be peculiarly felt, and which it is peculiarly  
the duty of Congre≈øs to inculcate, is the  
| provi≈øion recommended for the national  
debt. Although this debt is greater than  
could have been wi≈øhed, it 1s ≈øtill le≈øs on

of the debt makes no part of the que≈øtion,  
It is ≈øufficient that the debt has been fair  
eontracted, and that ju≈øtice and good fait.  
demand that it ≈øhould be fully di≈øcharged.  
Congre≈øs had no option but betwee≈øf diffe-  
rent modes of di≈øcharging it. The ≈øame  
option is the only one that can exi≈øt with  
the ≈øtates. The mode which has after l;

we are per≈øuaded, the lea≈øt objectionable of  
any that would have been equal to the pur-

the ju≈øtice and plighted faith of the ≈øeveral  
Kates to give it its proper effect, to reflect  
  
on the con≈øequences of rejecting it, and to  
remember that Congre≈øs will not be an≈øwer+4

of our establishment, the cause of liberty  
will acquire a dignity and lustre which it

period of our history since the revolution  
just after the termination of the war, ond  
when the Slates were struggling under the  
debt incurred by it. 1 had intended to  
read this address, but time will not permit  
mc. But to show you on what principles  
of honesty upon what determination to  
preserve the public faith upon what reso¬≠  
lution to undergo all hardships in the work  
of protecting the honor of the country  
the great men of that time acted, I shall  
read the concluding paragraph:  
&quot;Let it be remembered, finally, that it hns  
ever been the pride enJ boast of America that

.uc riguts lor vrnicu sue tuiiieiiut-u cic uic  
riglits of human nature. By the blessings of  
the au&#x27;.lior of human nature she has prevailed  
ugamst all opposition, and lurmed the basis ol  
thiileen independent States. No instance has  
herelofoic occurred nor can ever be expected to  
occur again in whic h the mends ol an unadulter¬≠  
ated form of republican government can em  
brace such an opportunity of exhibiting their vir¬≠  
tue. The citizens of the United States are now  
responsible for the greatest irust ever confided to  
a political sociciy. If justice, good faiih, and all  
the other qualities which elevate a nation in the  
eyes of mankind, he now displayed, the cause of  
human liberty will acquire a dignity and lustre  
never yet seen, and an example will be set,  
which cannot but have the most favorable influ¬≠  
ence on the rights of mankind. If. on the other  
hand our government should unfortunately he  
blotted by the reverse of these cardinal viitues,  
the great cause we have so solemnly engaged to  
vindicate will be defeated. The last and first ex¬≠  
periment in favor of the tights of human nature  
will be turned against tin in, and their friends ex¬≠  
posed, unshielded, to the insults of the votaries of  
tyranny and usurpation.

whMadises. Hamilton,&quot; and Oliver  
Ellew. were slatesmen; and patriots, or  
ero tey sadicss, fools, thieves, plunderers  
and oppressors of the people  
  
Madison, Hamilton and Ellsworth say in  
their address:  
The prospoct which has for some time existed,  
und whith is now bappily realised, of a  
terminatien of the war, together with the critical  
axtsencles of pablie affairs, has made it the duty  
of Congress to reviow and provide for the debts  
akisk the war has left opon the United States.  
  
to leck forward to the means of obviating  
which mey interrupt the hasmony and  
Amangullity of the confederacy. The result of  
iinture and solemn deliberations on these  
Steat oblects is contained in their several recom-¬≠  
mendations of the 18th inst., herewith transmits  
  
Tea  
ret measare recommended is effectual  
  
nrovisien for the debts of the United States.  
Ameunt of these dobts, as far as they can now be  
ascortained, is $42,000,375. To discharge the  
brincipal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any  
short period, is evidently not within the compass  
of our resources; and even if it could be accomp-  
sished, the ease of the community would require  
that the debt itself should be left to a course of  
gradual extinguishment, and certain funds be  
Crovided for paying, in the mean time, the annual  
interest.&quot;  
  
g  
  
The fund which presented itself on this, as it  
aid on a former occasion, was a tax on imports.  
The reasons which recommended this branch of  
revenss have heretofore been stated in an act, of  
which a copy (No. 2) is now forwarded; and need  
not be here repeated. It will suffice to recapitus  
late, that taxes on consumption are always least  
burdansome, because they are least felt, and are  
borne, too, by those who are both willing and  
able to pay them; that, of all taxes on consump-¬≠  
tion, thosh on forsign commerce are most com-¬≠  
atibls with the geaius and policy of free States.&quot;  
The plan thus communicoted and explained  
by Congress must now receive its fate from their  
constituents. All the objects comprised in it are  
conceived to be of great importance to the happi-¬≠  
ness of this confederated republic--are necessary  
to ronder the fruits of the revolution a full reward  
for the blood, the toils, the cares, and the calamie  
ties which have purchased it. But the object, of  
which the necessity will be peculiarly felt, and  
which it is peculiarly the duty of Cnngress to in-¬≠  
eulcate, is the provision recommended for the na¬≠  
tional debt. Although this debt is greater than  
seuld have been wished, it is still less, on the  
whele, than could have been expected; and, when  
referred to the cause in which it has been incur-¬≠  
red, and compared with the burdens which wars  
of ambition and of vain glory have entailed  
other nations, ought to be Borne not only with  
cheerfulness, but with pride. But the magnitude  
of the debt makes no part of the question. It is  
suffibient that the debt has been fairly contracted,  
and that justice and good faith demand that it  
should be fully discharged.&quot;  
  
If other motives than that of justice could  
be requisite on this occasion, no nation could ever  
feel stronger; for to whom are the debts to be  
paid  
  
To an aly, in the first place, who, to the exer  
tion of his arms in support of our cause has added  
the succors of his treasure; who, to his important  
loans, has added liberal donations; and whose  
loans themselves carry the impression of his mag¬≠  
nanimity and friendship.  
  
To individuals in a foreign country, in the  
next place, who were the first to give so precious  
a token of their confidence in our justiee, and of  
their friendship for our cause, and who are mem-¬≠  
bers of a republic which was second in espousing  
our rank among nations.  
  
Another class of creditors is that illustrious  
and patrtotse hand of fellue-citizens, whose blood  
and whose bravery have defended the liberties of  
their country; who have patiently borne, among  
other distresses, the privation of their stipends,  
whilst the distresses of their country disabled it  
from bestowing them; and who even now ask for  
  
no more than such a portion of their dues as will  
enable them to retire from the  
  
The remaining class of creditors is composed  
partly of such of our felllow-citizens as originally  
lent to the public the use of their funds, or have  
since manitested most confidence in their country  
by receiving transfers from the lenders; and  
partly of those whose property has been either  
  
dvanced or assumed for the public service. To or   
  
discriminate the merits  
tions of creditors would be a task equally unnece  
essary and invidious. If the voice of humanity  
plead more loudly in favor of some than of others,  
the voice of policy, no lesss than of justice, pleads  
in favor of all. A wise nation will never permit  
those who relieve the wants of their country, or  
who rely most on its faith, its firmness, and its  
resources, when either of them is distrusted, to  
suffer by the event.
