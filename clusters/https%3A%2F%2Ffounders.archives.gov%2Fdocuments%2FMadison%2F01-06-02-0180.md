. appd. to prepare an address to the States, on the subject of the recommendations of the 18th. instant, submit the following  
Address to the States by the United States in Congress Assembled  
  
April 26. 1783  
The prospect which has for some time existed, and which is now happily realized, of a successful termination of the war, together with the critical exigences of public affairs have made it the duty of Congress to review and provide for the debts which the war has left upon the U. S. and to look forward to the means of obviating dangers which may interrupt the harmony and tranquility of the Confederacy. The result of their mature and solemn deliberations on these great objects is contained in their several recommendations of the 18th. instant herewith transmitted. Although these recommendations speak themselves the principles on which they are founded, as well as the ends which they propose, it will not be improper to enter into a few explanations and remarks, in order to place in a stronger view the necessity of complying with them.  
The first measure recommended is effectual provision for the debts of the U. S. The amount of these debts as far as they can now be ascertained is 42000375 Dollars, as will appear by the Schedule No 1. To discharge the principal of this aggregate debt at once or in any short period is, evidently, not within the compass of our resources, and even if it could be accomplished, both the true interest and the ease of the community would require that the debt itself should be left to a course of gradual extinguishment, and certain funds be provided for paying in the mean time the annual interest. The amount of the annual interest, as will appear by the paper last referred to, is computed to be 2415956 Dollars. Funds therefore which will certainly and punctually produce this annual sum at least, must be provided.  
In devising these funds Congress did not overlook the mode of supplying the common Treasury provided by the articles of confederation. But after the most respectful consideration of that mode, they were constrained to regard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the public debt must be thrown. The delays and uncertainties incident to a revenue to be established and collected from time to time by thirteen independent authorities, is at first view irreconcileable with the punctuality essential in the discharge of the interest of a national debt. Our own experience, after making every allowance for transient impediments, has been a sufficient illustration of this truth. Some departure therefore in the recommendations of Congress from the fœderal constitution, was unavoidable; but it will be found to be as small as could be reconciled with the object in view, and to be supported besides by solid considerations of interest and sound policy.  
The fund which first presented itself on this, as it did on a former occasion, was a tax on imports. The reasons which recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been stated in an act of which a copy No. 2 is now forwarded, and need not be here repeated. It will suffice to recapitulate, that taxes on consumption are always least burdensome, because they are least felt, and are borne too by those who are both willing and able to pay them; that of all taxes on consumption, those on foreign commerce are most compatible with the genius and policy of free States; that from the relative positions of some of the more commercial States, it will be impossible to bring this essential resource into use without a concerted uniformity; that this uniformity cannot be concerted through any channel so properly as through congress, nor for any purpose so aptly as for paying the debts of a Revolution, from which an unbounded freedom has accrued to commerce.  
In renewing this proposition to the States we have not been unmindful of the objections which heretofore frustrated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the duration of the revenue to the term of 25. years: and we have left to the States themselves the appointment of the officers who are to collect it. If the strict maxims of national credit alone were to be consulted, the revenue ought manifestly to be co-existent with the object of it; and the collection placed in every respect under that authority which is to dispense the former, and is responsible for the latter. These relaxations will we trust, be regarded on one hand as the effect of a disposition in Congs. to attend at all times to the sentiments of those whom they serve; and on the other hand as a proof of their anxious desire that provision may be made in some way or other for an honorable and just fulfilment of the engagements which they have formed.  
  
To render this fund as productive as possible and at the same time to narrow the room for collusions and frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan, to recommend a liberal duty on such articles as are most susceptible of a tax according to their quantity and are of most equal and general consumption; leaving all other articles, as heretofore proposed, to be taxed according to their value.  
The amount of this fund is computed to be 915956 Dollars. The estimates on which the computation is made, are detailed in paper No. 3. accuracy in the first essay on so complex &amp; fluctuating a subject is not to be expected. It is presumed to be as near the truth as the defect of proper materials would admit.  
The residue of the computed interest is 1500000 Dollars, and is referred to the States to be provided for by such funds as they may judge most convenient. Here again the strict maxims of public credit gave way to the desire of Congress to conform to the sentiments of their constituents. It ought not to be omitted however with respect to this portion of the revenue, that the mode in which it is to be supplied, varies so little from that pointed out in the articles of confederation, and the variations are so conducive to the great object proposed, that a ready and unqualified compliance on the part of the States may be the more justly expected. In fixing the quotas of this sum Congs. as may be well imagined, were guided by very imperfect lights and some Inequalities may consequently have ensued. These however can be but temporary, and as far as they may exist at all, will be redressed by a retrospective adjustment, as soon as a constitutional rule can be applied.  
The necessity of making the two foregoing provisions one indivisible and irrevocable act is apparent. Without the first quality, partial provision only might be made where complete provision is essential; nay as some States might prefer &amp; adopt one of the funds only, and the other States the other fund only, it might happen that no provision at all would be made: Without the second, a single State out of the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bankruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar to the establishment of national credit. Instead of enlarging on these topics, two observations are submitted to the justice and wisdom of the Legislatures. First: The present Creditors[,] or rather the domestic part of them, having either made their loans for a period which has expired, or having become creditors in the first instance involuntarily, are entitled on the clear principles of justice &amp; good faith, to demand the principal of their credits, instead of accepting the annual interest. It is necessary, therefore, as the principal can not be paid to them on demand, that the interest should be so effectually and satisfactorily secured, as to enable them if they incline, to transfer their stock at its full value. Secondly: if the funds be so firmly constituted as to inspire a thorough &amp; universal confidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the domestic debt which bears the high interest of 6 perCt., may be cancelled by other loans obtained at a more moderate interest? The saving by such an operation would be a clear one and might be a considerable one. As a proof of the necessity of substantial funds for the support of our credit abroad we refer to paper No 4  
Thus much for the interest of the national debt: For the discharge of the principal within the term limited, we rely on the natural increase of the revenue from Commerce, on requisitions to be made from time to time for that purpose, as circumstances may dictate, and on the prospects of vacant territory. If these resources should prove inadequate, it will be necessary, at the expiration of 25 years to continue the funds now recommended or to establish such others as may then be found more convenient.  
With a view to the resource last mentioned, as well as to obviate disagreeable controversies, and confusions, Congress have included in their present recommendations, a renewal of those of the 6th day of Septr. and of the 10th. day of October 1780. In both those respects a liberal and final accomodation of all interfering claims of vacant territory, is an object which cannot be pressed with too much solicitude.  
The last object recommended is a constitutional change of the rule, by which a partition of the common burdens is to be made. The expediency and even necessity of such a change has been sufficiently enforced by the local injustice and discontents which have proceeded from valuations of the soil in every State where the experiment has been made. But how infinitely must these evils be increased, on a comparison of such valuations among the states themselves! On whatever side indeed this rule be surveyed, the execution of it must be attended with the most serious difficulties. If the valuations be referred to the authorities of the several States, a general satisfaction is not to be hoped for: If they be executed by officers of the U. S. traversing the Country for that purpose, besides the inequalities against which this mode would be no security, the expence would be both enormous and obnoxious: If the mode taken in the act of the 17 day of feby last which was deemed on the whole least objectionable, be adhered to, still the insufficiency of the data to the purpose to which they are to be applied, must greatly impair, if not utterly destroy all confidence in the accuracy of the result; not to mention that as far as the result can be at all a just one, it will be indebted for the advantage to the principle on which the rule proposed to be substituted is founded. This rule altho’ not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other that could be devised. The only material difficulty which attended it in the deliberations of Congress, was to fix the proper difference between the labor and industry of free inhabitants, and of all other inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual concessions, and if it should be supposed not to correspond precisely with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal spirit of accomodation among the several Legislatures, will prevail against little inequalities which may be calculated on one side or on the other. But notwithstanding the confidence of Congress as to the success of this proposition, it is their duty to recollect that the event may possibly disappoint them, and to request that measures may still be pursued for obtaining &amp; transmitting the information called for in the act of 17 feby. last, which in such event will be essential.  
The plan thus communicated and explained by Congress must now receive its fate from their Constituents. All the objects comprized in it are conceived to be of great importance to the happiness of this confederated republic, are necessary to render the fruits of the Revolution, a full reward for the blood, the toils, the cares and the calamities which have purchased it. But the object of which the necessity will be peculiarly felt, and which it is peculiarly the duty of Congress to inculcate, is the provision recommended for the national debt. Altho’ this debt is greater than could have been wished, it is still less on the whole than could have been expected, and when referred to the cause in which it has been incurred, and compared with the burdens which wars of ambition and of vain glory have entailed on other nations, ought to be borne not only with cheerfulness but with pride. But the magnitude of the debt makes no part of the question. It is sufficient that the debt has been fairly contracted and that justice &amp; good faith demand that it should be fully discharged. Congress had no option but between different modes of discharging it. The same option is the only one that can exist with the States. The mode which has after long &amp; elaborate discussion been preferred, is, we are persuaded, the least objectionable of any that would have been equal to the purpose. Under this persuasion, we call upon the justice &amp; plighted faith of the several States to give it its proper effect, to reflect on the consequences of rejecting it, and to remember that Congress will not be answerable for them.  
  
If other motives than that of justice could be requisite on this occasion, no nation could ever feel stronger. For to whom are the debts to be paid?  
To an Ally, in the first place, who to the exertion of his arms in support of our cause, has added the succours of his Treasure; who to his important loans has added liberal donations; and whose loans themselves carry the impression of his magninimity and friendship. For more exact information on this point we refer to paper No. 5  
To individuals in a foreign country in the next place who were the first to give so precious a token of their confidence in our justice, and of their friendship for our cause; and who are members of a republic which was second in espousing our rank among nations. For the claims and expectations of this class of Creditors we refer to paper No. 6  
Another class of Creditors is that illustrious &amp; patriotic band of fellow Citizens, whose blood and whose bravery have defended the liberties of their Country, who have patiently borne, among other distresses the privation of their stipends, whilst the distresses of their Country disabled it from bestowing them; and who even now ask for no more than such a portion of their dues as will enable them to retire from the field of victory &amp; glory into the bosom of peace &amp; private citizenship, and for such effectual security for the residue of their claims as their Country is now unquestionably able to provide. For a full view of their sentiments and wishes on this subject we transmit the paper No. 7. and as a fresh &amp; lively instance of their superiority to every species of seduction from the paths of virtue &amp; of honor, we add the paper No. 8  
The remaining class of Creditors is composed partly of such of our fellow Citizens as originally lent to the public the use of their funds, or have since manifested most confidence in their Country by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of those whose property has been either advanced or assumed for the public service. To discriminate the merits of these several descriptions of creditors would be a task equally unnecessary &amp; invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favor of some than of others; the voice of policy, no less than of justice pleads in favor of all. A wise nation will never permit those who relieve the wants of their Country, or who rely most on its faith, its firmness and its resources, when either of them is distrusted, to suffer by the event.  
Let it be remembered finally that it has ever been the pride and boast of America, that the rights for which she contended were the rights of human nature. By the blessing of the Author of these rights on the means exerted for their defence, they have prevailed against all opposition and form the basis of thirteen independant States. No instance has heretofore occurred, nor can any instance be expected hereafter to occur, in which the unadulterated forms of Republican Government can pretend to so fair an opportunity of justifying themselves by their fruits. In this view the Citizens of the U. S. are responsible for the greatest trust ever confided to a Political Society. If justice, good faith, honor, gratitude &amp; all the other Qualities which enoble the character of a nation, and fulfil the ends of Government, be the fruits of our establishments, the cause of liberty will acquire a dignity and lustre, which it has never yet enjoyed; and an example will be set which can not but have the most favorable influence on the rights of mankind. If on the other side, our Governments should be unfortunately blotted with the reverse of these cardinal and essential Virtues, the great cause which we have engaged to vindicate, will be dishonored &amp; betrayed; the last &amp; fairest experiment in favor of the rights of human nature will be turned against them; and their patrons &amp; friends exposed to be insulted &amp; silenced by the votaries of Tyranny and Usurpation.

; i which is now happily realized, of a ſucceſsful ter-  
  
mination of the war, together with the critical  
exigencies of public affairs, he made it the duty  
  
  
war has left upon the United States, and to look forward to  
the means of obviating dangers which may interrupt the har-  
mony and tranquility of the confederacy. The reſult of  
their mature and-ſolemn deliberations on theſe great objects  
is contained in their ſeveral recommendations of the 18th  
  
  
tions ſpeak themſelves the principles on which they are founded,  
as well as the ends which they propoſe, it will not be improper  
to enter into a few explanations and remarks, in order to place  
  
  
The firſt meaſure recommended is, effectual proviſion for the  
  
  
as will appear by the ſchedule No. x. To difcharge the  
principal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any ſhort period,  
is evidently not within the compaſs of our reſources; and  
even if it could be accompliſhed, the eaſe of the community  
would require that the debt itſelf ſhould be left to a courſe  
of gradual extinguiſhment, and certain funds be provided for  
paying in the mean time the annual intereſt, The amount of  
the annual intereſt, as will appear by the paper laſt referred to,  
it computed to be 2 415,956 dollars. Funds, therefore,  
which will certainly and punctually produce this annual ſum,  
at leaſt,” muſt be provided, | | .  
In deviſing theſe funds, Congreſs did not overlook the  
mode of ſupplying the common treaſury, provided by the  
articles of confederation ; but, after the moſt reſpectful con-  
ſideration of that mode, they were conſtrained to regard it  
as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the  
public debt muſt be thrown. The delays and uncertainties  
  
  
to  
  
I  
  
F  
to time by thirteen independent authorities, is at firſt view  
irreconcileable with the punctuality eſſential in the diſcharge  
of the intereſt of a national debt. Our own experience, after  
making every allowance for tranſient impediments, has been a  
| ſufficient illuſtration of this truth Some departure, there-  
fore. in the recommendations of Congreſs, from he federal  
conſtitution was unavoidable; but it will be found to be as  
ſmall as could be reco ciled with the object in view, and to  
be ſupported beſides by ſolid conſiderations of intereſt and  
ſound pylicy. -  
  
The fund which firſt preſented itfelf on this, as it did on  
a former occaſion. was a tax on imports. The reaſons which  
recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been  
ſtated in an act. of which a copy, No 2, is now forwarded,  
and need not be here repeated It will ſuffice to recapitulate,  
that taxes on conſumption are always leaft burdenſome; þe-  
cauſe they are leaſt felt and are. borne too by thoſe who are  
both willing and able to pay them; that of all taxes on con-  
ſomprion. thoſe on foreign commerce are moſt compatible  
with the genius and policy of free ſtates; that from the relative  
poſitions of ſome of the more commercial ſtates, it will be  
  
  
concerted uniformity : that this uniformity cannot be con-  
  
  
nor for any purpoie ſo aptly as for paying the debts of a  
  
  
to commerce.  
In renewing this propoſition to the ſtates, we have not | been  
  
  
unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the daration of  
the revenue to the term of 25 years; and we have left to the  
ſtates themſelves the appointment of the officers who are to  
colle&amp; it. If the ſtrict maxims of national credit alone were  
to be conſulted, the revenue ought manifeſtly to be coexiſtent  
with the object of it, and the collection placed in every reſpect  
under that authority which is to diſpenſe the former, and is  
reſponſible for the latter. Theſe relaxations will, we truſt,  
  
  
greſs to attend at all times to the ſeatiments of thoſe whom  
they ſerve. and on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious  
defire that proviſion may be made in ſome way or other for  
  
  
they haye formed. £2 To

To render this fund as productive as poſſible, and at the  
ſame time to narrow the room for colluſions and frauds, it has  
  
  
liberal duty on ſuch articles as are moſt ſuſceptible of a tax  
according to their quantity, and are of moſt equal and general  
conſumption ; leaving all other articles, as heretofore propoſed,  
to be taxed according to their value. |  
  
The amount of this fund is computed to be 915,956 dol-  
lars. The eſtimates on which the computation is made. are  
detailed in paper No. 3. Accuracy in the firſt eſſay on fo com-  
plex and fluctuatiog a ſubject is not to be expected It is  
  
  
rials would admit. f  
The refidue of the computed intereſt is 1,500,000 dollars,  
and is referred to the ſtates to be provided for by ſuch funds  
as they may judge moſt convenient. Here again. the ſtrict  
maxims of public credit gave way to the defire of Congreſs  
to conform to the ſentiments of their conſtituents. It ought  
not to be omitted, however, with reſpect to this portion of  
the revenue, that the mode in which it is to be ſupplied, varies  
ſo little from that pointed out in the articles of confederation,  
and the variations. are ſo coriducive to the great object pro-  
poſed, that a ready and unqualified compliance oa the part of  
the ſtates may be the more juſtly expected. In fixing the  
quotas of this ſum, Congreſs, as may be well imagined, were  
guided by very imperfect lights, and ſome inequalities may  
conſequently have enſued. Theſe, however, can be but tem-  
porary, and as far as they may exiſt at all, will be redreſſed  
by a tetroſpect ve adjuſtment, as ſoon as a conſtitutional rule  
can be applied. The neceſſity of making the two foregoing  
proviſions one indiviſible and irrevocable act, is apparent.  
Without the firſt quality, partial proviſion only might be made  
where complete proviſion is eflential ; nay, as ſome ftates  
might prefer and adopt one of the funds only, and the other  
ſtates the other fund only it might happen that no proviſion  
  
  
-the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bank-  
ruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar  
to the eſtabliſhment of national credit. Inſtead of enlarging  
on theſe topics, two obſervations ate ſubmitted to the juſtice  
and wiſdom of the Jegiſlatures. Firſt : The preſent creditors,  
  
  
* - . 4 4 loans  
  
As  
ha er  
  
9  
loans for a period which has expired. or having become credi-  
tors ia the firſt inftance ĩavoluatarily, are iatitled oa the clear  
principles of juſtice and god faith, to demand the principal  
of ther credits, inſtead of accepting the annual intereſt, - It is,  
seceſſary, therefore, as the principal cannot be paid to them  
on demand, that the iatereſt ſhould be fo effectually and ſatis-  
factorily ſecured, as to enable them, if they incline, to transfer  
their ſtock at its full value. Secondly : If the funds be ſo  
firmly conſtituted as tò inſpire a thorough. and univerſal con-  
fidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the domeſtic  
debt, which bears the high intereſt of fix per cent. may be can -  
eelled by other loans obtained at a more moderate intereſt ?  
The ſaving by ſuch an operation, would be a clear one, and  
might be a conſiderable one; As a proof of the neceſlity of  
ſubſtantial funds for a ſupport of our credit abroad, we tefer  
to paper No. 4. | |  
Thus much for the intereft of the national debt: For the  
_ diſcharge of the principal within the term limited, we rely on  
the natural increaſe of the revenue from commerce, on requi-  
ations to be made from time to time for that purpoſe, as cir-  
cumſtances may dictate, and on the proſpect of vacant territory.  
If theſe reſources ſhould prove inadequate, it will be neceſſary,  
at the expiration of 25 years. to continue the funds now re-  
commended, or to eſtabliſh ſuch others as may then be found  
more conventent. . 2  
With a view to the reſourſe laſt mentioned, as well as to  
obviate diſagteeable controverſies and confuſions, Congreſs have  
. included in their preſent recommendations, a renewal of thoſe  
of the 6th day of September and of the toth day of October  
1780. Ia both thoſe reſpects, a liberal and final accommo-  
dation of all interfering claims of vacant territory, is an object  
which cannot be preſſed with too much ſolicitude. |  
The laft object recommended is a conſtitutional change of  
  
the rule, by which a partition of the common burdens is to be  
made. The expedieney and even neceſlity of ſuch a change  
has been ſuffictently inforced by the local injuſtice and  
diſcontents which have proceeded from valuations of the  
ſoil in every ſtate where the experiment has been made. —  
  
But how infinitely muſt theſe evils be increaſed, on a com-  
pariſon of ſuch valuations among the the ſtates themſelves !-  
On whatever ſide indeed this rule be ſurveyed, the execution  
of it maſt be attended with the moſt ſerious difficulties. If  
the  
  
„  
  
  
ſtates, a general ſatisfaction is not to be hoped for: If they  
be executed by. officers of the United States traverſing the  
  
  
which this mode would be no ſecurity, the expence wovld  
be both enormous and abnoxious : If the mode taken in the  
act of the 19th day of February laſt, which was deemed on  
  
  
ency of the data to the purpoſe to which they arg to be ap-  
  
  
in the accuracy of the reſult ; not to mention that as far as  
the reſult can be at all a juſt one, it will be indebted for the  
advantage to the principle on which the rule propoſed to be  
ſubſtituted is founded. This 1ule, altho&#x27; not free from ob-  
je ctions, is liable to fewer than any other that could be de-  
viſed. The only material difficulty which attended it in the  
deliberations of Congreſs, was 10 fix the proper difference  
between the labour and induſtry of free inhabitants, and  
  
  
The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual con-  
ceſſions ; ard if it ſhould be ſuppoſed not to correſpond preciſely  
with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal  
ſpirit of accomodation among the ſeyeral legiſlatures, will prevail  
againſt little inequalities which may be calculated on one fide  
or on the other. Pur notwithſtanding the confiderce of  
  
  
to recollect that the event may poſſibly diſappoint them, and  
to requeſt that meaſures may ſtill be purſued for obtaining  
and trranſmittivg the information called for in the act of the  
19th of February laſt, which in ſuch event will be eſſential.  
The plan thus communicated and explained by Congreſs  
muſt now receive its fate from their copſtituents. All the  
  
  
tance to the happineſs of this ccnfederated republic; are  
neceſſary to render the fruits of the revolution, a full rewzrd  
for the blood, the toils, the cares and the calamities which  
have purchaſed ir, But the object of Which tbe neceſſity  
  
  
Congreſs to incùlcate, is the proviſion recommended for the  
  
  
been wiſhed, it is ſtill leſs on the whole than could have been  
  
  
incurred,  
  
—  
  
(#3  
incurred, and compared with the burdens which wars of ambi-  
- tion and vain-glory have entailed on other nations. ought ta  
  
be borne not only with chearfulneſs but with pride, But the  
magnitude of the debt makes no part of the queſtion. It is  
  
  
tice and good faith demand that it ſhould be fully diſcharged.  
Congreſs had no option but between different modes of diſ-  
ebarging it. The ſame option is the only one that can exiſt  
- with the ſtates. The mode which has after long and elaborate  
* diſcuſſion, been preferred. is, we are perſuaded, the leaſt ob-  
- jeQionable of any that would have been equal to the pwr poſe.  
Under this perſuaſion, we call upon the juſtice aud plighted  
faith of the ſeveral ſtates to give it its proper effect, to reflect  
en the conſequences of rejecting it, and to remember _  
Congreſs will not be anſwerable for them.  
  
If other motives than that of juſtice could be requiſite on,  
this occaſion, no nation could ever feel ſtronger ; for to whom  
are the debts to be paid? To an aLLy, in the firſt place, who  
to the exer ion of his arms in {ſupport of our cauſe, has added  
the ſaccours of his treaſure; who, to his i important loans, has  
added liberal donations; and whoſe loans themſelves carry  
the impreſfion of his me gnanin. ity and friendſhip. For more  
exe infor mation on this point me refer to paper No. 5.  
  
To individuals in a foreign country, in the next place, who  
were the firſt to give fo precious a token of their confidence in  
our juſtice and of their friendſhip for our cauſe, and who are  
  
  
rank among nations. For the claims and expectations of this  
Claſs of creditors we refer to paper No 6.  
  
Another claſs of creditors is, that iliuſtriou and patriotic  
band e feil;w citizens, whoſe blood and whoſe bravery have  
defended the liberties of their country, who have patiently  
borne, 2mong other diſtreſſes, the privation of their ſtipends,  
whilſt the diſtreſſes of their country diſabled it from beitow-  
ing them; and who, even row atk no more than ſuch a por-

gard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form inte  
which the public debt muſt be throwu. The delays and  
uncertainties Incident to a revenue to be eſtabliſhe d ande  
collected from time to time by thirteen independent au-  
thorities, is, at firſt view, irreconcileable with the punctu-  
ality eſſential in the diſcharge of the intereſt of a nation-  
al debt. Our own experience, after making every altow.  
ance for tranſient impediments, has been a ſufficient il.  
Juſtration of this truth. Some departure, therefore, in  
the recommendations of Congreſs, from the fœderal con-  
ſtitution, was unavoidable; but it will be found to be dd  
mall as could be reconciled; with the object in view, and  
to be ſupp̃orted beſides by ſolid conſiderations of intereſt  
and ſound policy. FTF N  
- The fund which firſt preſented itſelf on this, as it  
did on a former occaſion, was a tax on imports. The  
reaſons which recommended this branch of revenue, have  
heretofore been ſtated in an act, of which a copy, No. 2,  
is now forwarded, and need not be; here repeated; It  
_ will ſuffice to recapitulate, that taxes on conſumption  
are always leaſt; burthen ſome, becauſe they are leaſt felt,  
and are botrne too by thoſe who are both willing and  
able to pay them: that of all taxes on conſamption, thoſe  
on foreigu commerce are moſt compatible with the geni-  
us and policy of free ſtates: that from the relative poſiti -  
ons of ſome of the more commercial ſtates, it will be im*  
poſſible to bring this efizncial reſource into uſe without  
nu concerted uniformity : that this uniformity cannot be  
concerted through any channel. ſo properly as through  
Congreſs, nor for any purpoſe ſo aptly as for paying the  
debts of a revolution, from which au unbouuded freedom  
Has accrued to commet ce. 1  
In renewing this propoſition to the ſtates, we have not  
been unmindful of the objections which heretofore fruſ.  
trated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited  
the duration of the revenue to the term of 25 years; and  
we have lefc to the ſtates themſelves the appointment of  
the officers who are to collect it, If the ſtrict maxims of  
national credit alone were to be conſulted, the revenue  
ought manifeſtly to be coexiſtent with the object of ir, and  
_ the collection placed in every reſpect under that authori-  
ty which is to diſpenſe the former, and 1s reſpouſible for  
the latter. Theſe relaxations will, we truſt, be regarded on  
one haud as the effect of a diſpoſition in Congreſs toattend at  
all times to the ſentiments of thoſe whom they ſerve, aud

on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious deſire that  
oviſion may be made in ſome way or other for an ha-  
nourable and juſt fulfilment of the engagements which  
they have formed. F £0  
To render this fund as productive. as poſſible, and at  
  
the ſame time to narrow the room for colluſions and  
frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan,  
  
  
ſaſceptible of a tax according to their quantity, and are  
  
  
articles, as hereto  
  
ore ptopoſed, to be taxed according to  
their vue. 7 9060 5  
  
  
dollars. The eſtimates on. which the computation is  
made, are detailed in paper No. 3. Accuracy in the firſt  
eſſay on ſo complex and fluctuating a ſubject is not to be  
  
  
defect of proper materials would admit. =  
The reſidue of the computed intereſt:is 1,500,000 dol-  
lars, and is referred to the ſtates to be provided for by ſuch  
  
  
the ſtrict maxims of public credit gave way to the defire  
  
  
tuents. It onght not to be omitted, however, with re-  
ſpect to this portion of the revenue, that the mode in  
  
  
ed out in the articles of confederation, and the variations  
are ſo conducive to tlie great object propoſed, that a rea;  
  
  
may conſequently have enſued, Theſe, however, can be  
but temporary, and as far as they may exiſt at all, will be  
redreſſed by a retroſpective adjuſtment, as ſoon as a con-  
ſtitutional rule can be applied. 35h e  
The neceſſity of making the two foregoing proviſions  
one indiviſible and irrevocable act, is apparent. Without  
the. firſt quality, partial proviſion only might be made  
where compleat proviſion is eſſential z nay, as ſome ſtates  
  
  
ther ſtates the other fund only, it might happen that no  
proviſion at all would be made: without the ſecondg a  
ſingle ſtate our of the thirteen might at any time involve  
the nation in bankruptey, the mere practicability of which  
  
Eren  
  
  
dit. Inſtead of enlarging on theſe topics, two obſerva-  
tons ere ſubmitied to the juſtice and wiſdom of the legiſ-  
Jatures. Firſt: The preſent creditors, or rather the do-  
meſtic part of them, having eitber made their loans for  
a period which has expired, or having become creditors  
iu the firſt inſtance involuntarily, are entitled, on the clear  
  
  
cipal of their credirs, inſtead of accepting the annual in-  
  
  
be paid to them on demand, that the intereſt ſhould be  
ſo effectually and ſatisfactorily ſecured, as to enavie them *  
if they incline, to transfer their ſtock at its Full value.  
Secondly : if the funds be ſo firmly conſtituted as to in-  
Jpire-a thorough and univerſal confidence, may it not be  
hoped, that the capital of the domeſtic debt, which bears  
the high intereſt of ſix per cent. may be ccncelled by o-  
  
  
ſaving by ſuch an operation, would be a clear one, and  
might be a conſiderable one. As a proof of the neceſlity of  
ſubſtantial funds for a ſupport of our credit abroad, we  
refer to paper No. 4. | | 5  
  
Thus much for the intereſt of the national debt: for  
the diſcharge of the principal, within the term limited,  
we rely on the natural enereaſe of the revenue from eom :  
  
  
that purpoſe, as circumſtances may diftate, and on the  
proſpect of vacant territory, If theſe-reſources ſhould  
prove inadequate, it will be neceſfary, at the expiration  
  
  
mended, or to eftab}iſh ſuck others as may then be found  
more convenient.  
With a view to the reſource laſt mentioned, as well as  
to obviate diſagreeable controverſies and confuſiuns, Con-  
greſs have included in their preſent recommendations, a  
renewal of thoſe of the 6th day of September, and of the  
toth day of October, 1780. In both thoſe reſpects, a  
li beral and final accommodation of all interfering claims  
of vacant territory, is an object Which cannot be preſſed  
with too much ſolicitude. | 1 |  
The laſt object recommended is a conſtitutional change  
of the rule, by which a partition of the common burdens  
is go be made. The expediency and even neceſſity ot ſuch  
a change has been ſufficiently inforced: by the local injuſ-  
tice and diſcontents which have proeceded from valuati-  
ons of the ſoil in every ſtate where the experiment has  
  
been

creaſed, on a compariſon of ſuch valuations among the  
ates themſelves! On whatever fide indeed this rule be  
  
  
molt ſerious difficulties. If the valuations be referred to  
the authorities of the ſeveral ſtates, a general ſatisfacti-  
  
  
of the United States traverſing the country for that pur-  
poſe, beſides the inequalities againſt which this mode  
would be no ſecurity, the expence would be both enormous  
  
and obnoxious : If the mode taken in the act of the 19th  
day of February laſt, which was deemed on the whole  
leaſt objectionable, be adhered to, ſtill the inſufficieney  
  
of the data to the purpoſe to which they are to be appli.  
  
ed, muſt greatly impair, if not utterly deſtroy all confi-  
dence in the accuracy of the reſult ; not to mention that  
as far as the reſult can be at all a juſt one, it will be indebt-  
ed for the advantage to the principle on which the rule  
propoſed to be ſubitituted&#x27;is founded. This rule, altho“  
not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other  
that could be deviſed. The only material difficulty  
which attended it in the deliberations of Congreſs was,  
ro fix the proper difference between the labour and in-  
  
  
The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual  
conceſſions; and if it ſhould be ſuppoſed not to correſ -  
pond preciſely with the fact, no doubt ought to be enter.  
tained that an equal ſpirit of uccommodation among the  
  
  
which may be calculated on one fide or on the other.  
But notwithſtanding the confidence of Congreſs, as to the  
ſucceſs of this propoſition, it is their duty to recollect  
that the event may poſſibly diſappoint&#x27; them, and to re-  
queſt that meaſures may ſtill be purſued for obraining and  
tranſmitting the information called for in the act of the  
17th of February laſt, which in ſuch event will be eſſential.  
The plan, thus communicated and explained by Con-  
eſs, mnit now receive its fate from their conſtituents.  
All the objects compriſed in it are conceived to be of preat  
importance to the happineſs of this confederated republic;  
are neceſſary to render the fruits of the revo}viion, a full  
  
  
ties which have purchaſed it. Bur the object, of Which  
the neceſſity will be peculiarly felt, and which it is pe-

be borne not only with cheerfulneſs but with pride. But  
  
  
It is ſufficient that the debt has been fairly contracted, and  
that juſtice and good faith demand that it ſhould be fully  
diſcharged. Congreſs had nd option but between differ-  
ent modes of diſcharging it. The fame option is the on-  
ly one that can exiſt with the ſtates. The mode which  
has, after long and elaborate diſcuſſion, been preferred, is,

TR „„  
which they are founded, as well as the  
ends which they propoſe, it will not be im-  
proper to enter into a few explanations and  
  
remarks, in order to place in a ſtronger  
view the neceſſity of complying with them.  
  
Tur firſt meaſure recommended is, effec-  
tual proviſion for the debts of the United  
States. The amount of theſe debts, as far  
as they can now be aſcertained, is,  
42,000,375 dollars, as will appear by the  
ſchedule No. I. To diſcharge the prin-  
cipal of this aggregate debt at once, or in  
any ſhort period, is evidently not within  
the compaſs of our reſources; and even  
if it could be accompliſhed, the eaſe of tlie  
community would require, that the debt  
itſelf ſhould be left to a courſe of gradual  
extinguiſhment, and certain funds be pro-  
vided for paying in the mean time the an-  
nual intereſt. The amount of the annual  
Intereſt, as will appear by the paper laſt re-  
ferred to, is computed to be 2,415,956 dol-  
lars. Funds, therefore, which will cer-  
  
tainly  
  
  
In deviſing theſe funds, Congreſs did not  
overlook the mode of ſupplying the com-  
mon treaſury, provided by the articles of  
confederation; but after the moſt reſpect-  
ful conſideration of that mode, they were  
conſtrained to regard it as inadequate and  
inapplicable to the form into which the  
public debt muſt be thrown. The delays  
and uncertainties incident to a revenue to  
be eſtabliſhed and collected from time to  
time by thirteen independent authorities,  
is at firſt view irreconcileable with the punctu-  
ality eſſential in the diſcharge of the intereſt  
of a national debt. Our own experience,  
after making every allowance for tranſient  
impediments, has been a ſufficient illuſtra-  
tion of this truth. Some departure, there-  
fore, in the recommendations of Congreſs,  
from the federal conſtitution, was unavoid-  
able ; but it will be found to be as ſmall as

could be reconciled with the object i in view,  
and to be ſupported beſides by ſolid confi-  
  
  
Tux fund which firſt preſented itſelf on  
this, as it did on a former occaſion, was a  
tax on imports. The reaſons which recom-  
  
  
tofore been ſtated in an act, of which a  
  
  
recapitulate, that taxes on conſumption are  
always leaſt burdenſome, becauſe they are  
  
  
commerce are moſt compatible with the ge-  
nius and policy of free ſtates : that from  
the relative poſitions of ſome of the more  
commercial ſtates, it will be impoſſible to  
bring this eſſential reſource into uſe without  
a concerted uniformity : that this unifor-  
mity cannot be concerted through any chan-  
nel ſo properly as through Congreſs, nor  
  
| for  
  
  
for any purpoſe ſo aptly as for paying the  
debts of a revolution, from which an un-  
bounded freedom has accrued to commerce  
  
In renewing this oi to the lates,  
we have not been unmindful of the objee-  
tions which heretofore fruſtrated the una»  
nimous adoption of it. We have limited  
the duration of the revenue to the term of  
twenty-five years; and we have left to the  
ſtates themſelves the appointment of the  
officers who are to collect it. If the ſtrict  
maxims of national credit alone were to be  
conſulted, the revenue ought manifeſtly to  
be coexiſtent with the object of it, and the  
collection placed in every reſpect under chat  
authority which is to diſpenſe the former, |  
and is reſponſible for the latter. Theſe re-  
laxations will, we truſt, be regarded on one  
hand as the effect of a diſpoſition 1 in Con-  
greſs to attend at all times to the ſentiments  
of thoſe whom they ſerve, and on the  
  
other hand, as a proof of their anxious de-  
ſire that proviſion may be made in ſome

way or other for an honourable ard juſt  
  
fulfilment of the engage which they  
have formed.  
  
To render this fund as productive as poſ-  
fible, and at the ſame time to narrow the  
room for colluſions and frauds, it has been  
Judged an improvement of the plan, to re-  
commend a liberal duty on ſuch articles as  
are moſt ſuſceptible of a tax according to  
their quantity, and are of moſt equal and  
general conſumption; leaving all other ar-  
ticles, as heretofore propoſed, to be taxed  
according to their value.  
  
Tux amount of this fund is computed  
to be 915,956 dollars. The eſtimates on  
which the computation 1s made, are detailed  
in paper No. III. Accuracy in the firſt eſ-  
ſay on ſo complex and fluctuating a ſubject  
is not to be expected. It is preſumed to be  
as near the truth as the defect of proper  
materials would admit,  
  
  
  
Tres refidue of the computed intereſt is  
1,500,000 dollars, andis referred to the ſtates  
to be provided for by ſuch funds as they may  
judge moſt convenient. Here again the ſtrict  
maxims of public credit gave way to the de-  
fire of Congreſs to conform to the ſenti-  
ments of their conſtituents. It ought not  
to be omitted, however, with reſpect to this  
portion of the revenue, that the mode in  
which it is to be ſupplied, varies fo little  
from that pointed out in the articles of  
confederation, and the variations are ſo con-  
ducive to the great object propoſed, that a  
  
ready and unqualified compliance on the  
part of the ſtates may be the more juſtlx  
  
expected. In fixing the quotas of this ſum,  
Congreſs, as may be well imagined, were  
guided by very imperfect lights, and ſome  
  
inequalities may conſequently have enſued.  
Theſe, however, can be but temporary;  
and, as far as they may exiſt at all, will be  
redreſſed by a retroſpective adjuſtment, as  
ſoon as a conſtitutional rule can be applied.

Tux neceſſity of making the two forego-  
ing proviſions one indiviſible and irrevoca-  
ble act, is apparent. Without the firſt  
quality, partial proviſion only might be  
  
  
one of the funds only, and the other ſtates  
the other fund only, it might happen that  
  
  
the ſecond, a ſingle ſtate out of the Thirteen  
  
  
bankruptcy; the mere practicability of which  
would be a fatal bar to the eſtabliſhment of  
  
  
theſe topics, two obſervations are ſubmitted.  
to the juſtice and wiſdom of the legiſlatures.  
Firſt : The preſent creditors, or rather the  
  
  
their loans for a period which has expired,  
or having become creditors in the firſt in-  
ſtance involuntarily, are intitled, on the  
clear principles of juſtice and good faith, ..  
to demand the principal of their credits,  
inſtead of accepting the annual intereſt. It  
  
| | 18  
  
1  
  
is neceſſary, therefore, as the principal can-  
not be paid to them on demand, that the 1 in-  
tereſt ſhould be ſo effectually and ſatisfacto-  
rily ſecured, as to enable them, if they in-  
eline, to transfer their ſtock at its full value.  
Secondly : If the funds be fo firmly conſti-  
tuted as to inſpire a thorough and univerſal  
confidence, may it not be hoped, that the  
capital of the domeſtic debt, which bears  
the High intereſt of fix per cent. may be  
cancelled by other loans obtained at a more  
moderate intereſt? The ſaving by ſuch an  
operation would be a clear one, and might |  
be a conſiderable one. As a proof of the  
neceſſity of ſubſtantial funds for a ſupport  
of our credit abroad, we refer to No. IV.  
  
Tuvs much for the intereſt of the na-  
tional debt: For the diſcharge of the prin-  
cipal within the term limited, we. rely e on  
the natural increaſe of the revenue from  
commerce, on requiſitions to be made from  
time to time for that purpoſe, as circum-  
ſtances OY — and on the proſpect of

vacant territory. If theſe reſources ſhould  
  
prove inadequate, it will be neceſſary, at  
the expiration of twenty-five years, to con-  
tinue the funds now recommended, or to  
eſtabliſh ſuch others 3 as may then be found  
more convenient. |  
  
WIxx a view to the reſource laſt mention-  
ed, as well as to obviate diſagreeable gon-  
troverſies and confuſions, Congreſs hayg in-  
cluded, in their preſent recommendations,  
a renewal of thoſe of the 6th day of Sep-  
tember, and of the 10th day of Octob  
1780. In both thoſe reſpects, a liberal an  
final accommodation of all interfering claims  
  
of vacant territory, is an object which can-  
not be preſſed with too much ſolicitude.  
  
Tux laſt object recommended is a conſti-  
tutional change of the rule, by which a par-  
tition of the common burdens is to be made.  
The expediency. and even neceſſity, of ſuch.  
a change has: been ſufficiently inforced by  
the local injuſtice and diſcontents which  
  
774 | have  
  
  
  
  
* raluations among the ſtates themſelves ! On  
whatever fide indeed this rule be ſurveyed,  
  
the gyecution of it muſt be attended with  
  
the moſt ſerious difficulties. If the valua-  
  
tions be referred to the authorities of the  
ſeveral ſtates, a general ſatisfaction is not to  
5 hoped for: If they be executed by officers  
of the United States traverſing the country  
for that purpoſe, beſides the inequalities  
againſt which this mode would be no ſecurity,  
the expence would be both enormous and ob- |  
noxious. If the mode taken in the act of  
the 17th day of February laſt, which was  
deemed on the whole leaſt objectionable, be  
adhered to, ſtil] the inſufficiency of the data  
to the purpoſe to which they are to be ap-  
**plied, muſt greatly impair, if not utterly de-  
  
ſtroy, all confidence in the accuracy of the  
reſult; not to mention that, as far as the  
  
reſult can be at all a juſt one, it will be in-  
debted

on which the rule propaſed to be luke 4  
ted is founded. This rule, although not  
free from objections, i is liable to fewer than  
  
any other that could be deviſed. The onl  
material difficulty which attended it in th 4  
  
deliberations of Congreſs, was to fi  
  
proper difference between the 3  
induſtry of free inhabitants, and of all other  
inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed  
on was the effect of mutual conceſſion  
and if it ſhould be ſuppoſed not to corre=  
ſpond preciſely with the fact, no doubt  
  
ought to be entertained that an equal ſpirit  
of accommodation among the ſeveral legiſ-  
  
| tures, will prevail againſt little inequali-  
ties which may be calculated on one fide or  
on the qther. But notwithftanding the  
confidence of Congreſs as to the ſucceſs of  
this propoſition, it is their duty to recollect 0 |  
that the event may poffibly diſappoint them, :

of great importanee to the happineſs of  
this confederated republic; are neceſſary to  
er the fruits of the revolution, a full  
reward for the blood, the toils, the cares  
and the calamities which have purchaſed it.  
But the object of which the neceſſity will  
be peculiarly felt, and which it is peculiarly  
the duty of Congreſs to inculcate, is the  
| proviſion recommended for the national  
debt. Although this debt is greater than  
could have been wiſhed, it 1s ſtill leſs on  
the whole than could have been expected;

neſs but with pride. But the magnitude  
of the debt makes no part of the queſtion,  
It is ſufficient that the debt has been fair  
eontracted, and that juſtice and good fait.  
demand that it ſhould be fully diſcharged.  
Congreſs had no option but betweeſf diffe-  
rent modes of diſcharging it. The ſame  
option is the only one that can exiſt with  
the ſtates. The mode which has after l;  
and elaborate diſcuſſion been preferred, is,  
we are perſuaded, the leaſt objectionable of  
any that would have been equal to the pur-  
pole, Under this perſuaſion, we call upon  
the juſtice and plighted faith of the ſeveral  
Kates to give it its proper effect, to reflect  
  
on the conſequences of rejecting it, and to  
remember that Congreſs will not be anſwer+4  
able for them.

the p ople in the darkest period of our history since the  
Revolution- just after the termination of the war, and  
when the States were struggling under the debt incurred  
by it. I had intended to read this address, but time will  
not permit me. But to show you on what principles of  
honesty-upon what determination to preserve the public  
foith-up in what resolution to underge all hardships in  
the work of protecting the honor of the country--the  
great men of that time acted, I shall read the concluding  
piragraphs  
alet it be remembered, finally, thet it has ever been  
the pride an d boast of America that the rights for which  
the contended were the rights of human nature. By the  
bleasing of the author of hum en nature she has prevailed  
pd  sosuidon, and formed the batis of thirteen in  
States. No instance has heretofore occurred nor  
can ever be expected to occur, in which the friends of  
ae tu a apor of epublican gorernmentean ee  
such an apportunity of exhibiting their virtue.  
The citizens of the United States are now responsible for  
the greatest trust ever confiled te a political society. if  
nta sias fath yd a the other qualiiss which ale  
a nation in the eyes of mankind, be now displayed,  
the cause of human lib rly will sequire a dignity and  
lustre never yet seen, and an example will be set, which  
cannot but have the most favorable influence on the rights  
of menkind. If on the other hand our government should  
unfortunately be blotted by the reverse of these cardinal  
virtues, the great cause we have so solemnly engaged to  
vindicate will be deleated. The last and first experiment

s » precious u token of their confidence in  
our justice, nnd of their friendship for our  
cause, and who are members ol a repub  
be which was second in espousing our  
rank among nations.  
Another class of creditors is, tbit illus­  
trious and patriotic band of our Je/low-cit­  
isms, whose blood nnd whose bravery  
have de&#x27;enderl the liberties of their coun­  
try; who have | atiently borne, among

ml glory into the bosom of peace and  
private citizenship, nnd for such effectual  
security fi rthe ns due of their claims, as  
i their country is now unquestionably able  
to provide.  
The remaining class of creditors is

To discrim nate the merits of these sev- j  
ir.il desorptions of creditors would he u  
task equally unnecessary and invidious.  
Ifthe voice ol humanity plead more loud­

voice of policy, no less than of justice,  
pleads in favirofall. A wise nation will  
never pi rmit those, who relieve the wants

giatitude nnd all tho other qualities which

fil tho ends of governments, be the fruits  
of our establishment, the cause of liberty  
will acquire a dignity and lustre which it  
bus never yet enjoyed, and an example  
will be si t which cannot but have the

Atton, should be recognised as ommending to the States the adoption of the  
  
dutiesof imported goods to pay the  
debt. Will Clagett say  
  
whMadises. Hamilton,&quot; and Oliver  
Ellew. were slatesmen; and patriots, or  
ero tey sadicss, fools, thieves, plunderers  
and oppressors of the people  
  
Madison, Hamilton and Ellsworth say in  
their address:  
The prospoct which has for some time existed,  
und whith is now bappily realised, of a  
terminatien of the war, together with the critical  
axtsencles of pablie affairs, has made it the duty  
of Congress to reviow and provide for the debts  
akisk the war has left opon the United States.  
  
to leck forward to the means of obviating  
which mey interrupt the hasmony and  
Amangullity of the confederacy. The result of  
iinture and solemn deliberations on these  
Steat oblects is contained in their several recom-­  
mendations of the 18th inst., herewith transmits  
  
Tea  
ret measare recommended is effectual  
  
nrovisien for the debts of the United States.  
Ameunt of these dobts, as far as they can now be  
ascortained, is $42,000,375. To discharge the  
brincipal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any  
short period, is evidently not within the compass  
of our resources; and even if it could be accomp-  
sished, the ease of the community would require  
that the debt itself should be left to a course of  
gradual extinguishment, and certain funds be  
Crovided for paying, in the mean time, the annual  
interest.&quot;  
  
g  
  
The fund which presented itself on this, as it  
aid on a former occasion, was a tax on imports.  
The reasons which recommended this branch of  
revenss have heretofore been stated in an act, of  
which a copy (No. 2) is now forwarded; and need  
not be here repeated. It will suffice to recapitus  
late, that taxes on consumption are always least  
burdansome, because they are least felt, and are  
borne, too, by those who are both willing and  
able to pay them; that, of all taxes on consump-­  
tion, thosh on forsign commerce are most com-­  
atibls with the geaius and policy of free States.&quot;  
The plan thus communicoted and explained  
by Congress must now receive its fate from their  
constituents. All the objects comprised in it are  
conceived to be of great importance to the happi-­  
ness of this confederated republic--are necessary  
to ronder the fruits of the revolution a full reward  
for the blood, the toils, the cares, and the calamie  
ties which have purchased it. But the object, of  
which the necessity will be peculiarly felt, and  
which it is peculiarly the duty of Cnngress to in-­  
eulcate, is the provision recommended for the na­  
tional debt. Although this debt is greater than  
seuld have been wished, it is still less, on the  
whele, than could have been expected; and, when  
referred to the cause in which it has been incur-­  
red, and compared with the burdens which wars  
of ambition and of vain glory have entailed  
other nations, ought to be Borne not only with  
cheerfulness, but with pride. But the magnitude  
of the debt makes no part of the question. It is  
suffibient that the debt has been fairly contracted,  
and that justice and good faith demand that it  
should be fully discharged.&quot;  
  
If other motives than that of justice could  
be requisite on this occasion, no nation could ever  
feel stronger; for to whom are the debts to be  
paid  
  
To an aly, in the first place, who, to the exer  
tion of his arms in support of our cause has added  
the succors of his treasure; who, to his important  
loans, has added liberal donations; and whose  
loans themselves carry the impression of his mag­  
nanimity and friendship.  
  
To individuals in a foreign country, in the  
next place, who were the first to give so precious  
a token of their confidence in our justiee, and of  
their friendship for our cause, and who are mem-­  
bers of a republic which was second in espousing  
our rank among nations.  
  
Another class of creditors is that illustrious  
and patrtotse hand of fellue-citizens, whose blood  
and whose bravery have defended the liberties of  
their country; who have patiently borne, among  
other distresses, the privation of their stipends,  
whilst the distresses of their country disabled it  
from bestowing them; and who even now ask for  
  
no more than such a portion of their dues as will  
enable them to retire from the  
  
The remaining class of creditors is composed  
partly of such of our felllow-citizens as originally  
lent to the public the use of their funds, or have  
since manitested most confidence in their country  
by receiving transfers from the lenders; and  
partly of those whose property has been either  
  
dvanced or assumed for the public service. To or   
  
discriminate the merits  
tions of creditors would be a task equally unnece  
essary and invidious. If the voice of humanity  
plead more loudly in favor of some than of others,  
the voice of policy, no lesss than of justice, pleads  
in favor of all. A wise nation will never permit  
those who relieve the wants of their country, or  
who rely most on its faith, its firmness, and its  
resources, when either of them is distrusted, to  
suffer by the event.
