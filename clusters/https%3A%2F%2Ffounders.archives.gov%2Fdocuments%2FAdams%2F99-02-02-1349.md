Quincy May  1792  
  
The first Thing I have to communicate to you, must be an Explanation of the Date of my Letter.  The Legislature of Massachusetts, last Winter, upon a Petition of the North Parish in Braintree, Seperated it from the rest of the Town, erected it into a new one and gave it the name of Quincy.  By this Measure you See they have deprived me of my Title of “Duke of Braintree,” and made it necessary that my Friends should write me in future, as an Inhabitant of Quincy. So much for this Brimborion.  
Something that interests me much more is your obliging Letter of the 12th: of this month.  
I Should have been happy to have seen Mr: Pinkney before his departure: but more from individual Curiosity, than from any opinion that I could have given him any Information of importance to him.  If he has the Talent of Searching Hearts, he will not be long at a loss: if he has not no Information of mind could give it him.  The Duke of Leeds, once enquired of me very kindly after his Class Mates at Westminster School the two Mr: Pinkneys, which induces me to conclude that our new Ambassador has many powerful Old Friends in England.  Whether this is a Recommendation of him for the Office or not, I have other reasons to believe that his Family have had their Eyes fixed upon the Embassy to St: James’s for many Years, even before I was sent there, and that they contributed to limit the duration of my Commission to 3 Years in order to make way for themselves to succeed me.  I wish they may find as much honour and pleasure in it as they expected.  And that the Public may derive from it Dignity and Utility.  But knowing as I do the long Intrigue and suspecting as I do much British Influence in the appointment, were I in Any Executive Department I should take the Liberty to keep a vigilant Eye upon them.  
Accept of my Thanks for your Reflections, on the State of the Union, which I have read with all the Pleasure which the Intelligence, Information, Accuracy, and Elegance of the remarks on Lord Sheffeild inspired.  
There is one secret which you must be careful to keep.  Manufactures must have good Government. They cannot exist where they are, without it: much less can they be introduced where they are not.  But a great part of the People of America appear to be so determined to have no Government at all, that if you let them know the whole Truth you will excite an unmanageable party against Manufactures. Manufactures cannot live much less Thrive without honour, fidelity, punctuality, public and private faith, a sacred respect, to property and the moral obligation of promisses and contracts, virtues and habits which never did and never will generally prevail in any populous Nation, without a decissive as well as an intelligent and honest Government. The Science of political Œconomy is but a late Study and is not yet generally understood among us.  Tho I have read most of the Authors of reputation on the subject, both among the French and English, I pretend not to have digested any thing relative to it, with the precission of a Master.  But to me it appears, that the general Interests of Agriculture in particular as well as of the Nation in general will be promoted by a dis-creet and judicious Encouragement of Manufactures: and that it is only the Land Jobber, who can be benefited in the rapid rise of his Monopoly, by drawing every Labouring hand into the Wilderness to fell Trees.  
The continued Accessions of Foreigners, will endanger and destroy our peace, if We know not how to govern them. They will moreover corrupt our Elections and tear us to pieces. Sufficient to the day, however, as is its own evil, and in that day and hour it always has been and I doubt not always will be given us, to provide against its dangers.  
remember me affectionaly to all Friends and / believe me to be faithfully yours  
(Signed) John Adams

Quincy, May &gt; 1798.  
  
Dear Sir,  
  
; THE firft thing I have to commu-  
nicate to you mult be an explanation  
of the date of my letter. ° The le-  
giflature of Maflachufetts laft winter,  
upon a petition of the North Parifh  
in Braintree, feparated it from the  
reft of the town, erefted it into a  
pew one, and gave it the name of  
Quincy. By this meafure you fee  
they have deprived me of my title  
of * Duke of Braintree,” and made  
it neceflary that my friends fhould  
Write me in future, as an inhabitant  
ofQuincy. Somuch forthis Brim-  
borion, .  
  
Something that interefls me much  
more is your obliging letter of the  
teth of this month.  
  
I fhould have been happy to have  
feen Mr. Pinckney, before his de-  
parture ; but more from individual  
curiofity, than from any opinion that  
l could have given him any infor.  
mation of importance to him.—I] fhe

be will not be long at a lofs, if he  
  
has not, no information of mine cae  
ive it him.  
  
The duke of Leeds, once enquir-  
ed of me very kindly, after his clafs-  
mates at Welminster-{chool, the  
two Mr. Pinckneys, which induces  
me to conclude, thet our new Am-  
baffador has many powerful old  
friends in England. Whether this  
is a recommendation of him for the  
office or not, I have other reafonsto  
believe that his family have had  
their eyes fixed upon the embafly  
to St. James’s, for many yéars,  
even before I was fent there, and  
that they contributed to limit the  
duration of my commiffion to three  
years, in order to make way for  
themfelves to fucceed me. I with  
they may find as much honor and  
pleafure in it, as they expetted, and  
that the public may derive from it,  
d goity and utility. But knowing  
as I do, the long intrigue, and fuf-  
pefting as I do, much Britifh influ-  
ence in the appointment, were I in  
any executive department, I ‘fhould  
take the liberty to keep a vigilant  
eye upon them,

ojiiNCV, May , 1792.  
  
De ir Sir.  
  
The fir&#x27;V thing 1 have to commu­  
cate to you mijtl be an explanation  
of the date ps my letter. The I.e­  
giflature of Malfachufetts, l.ift win­  
ter, upon a petition of the North  
Parilli, in Brain tree, separated it  
from the reft of the town, erefted  
it into a new one, and gave it the  
name of C)uincy. By this meafuit  
you fee they have deprived me of  
my title off Duke of Braintrec,&quot;  
and made it necefi&#x27;ary that myfriends  
fliould write me in fyture, as an in­  
habitant of Quincy. So much for­  
tius Brimborion.  
Something that interefts*me much  
more is your obliging letter of the  
12th of this month.  
I flioud have been happy to have  
seen Mr. Pinckney before his de­  
parture ; but more from individual  
curiosity, than from any opinion,  
that I could have given him, any  
information of importance to him.  
If hehas the talentof feanchinghearts  
he will not be long at a &#x27;ofs, if he  
has not, no information of mine can  
  
give it him.  
The Duke of Leeds, once enqui­  
red of me very kindly,. after his  
class-mates at Weftminfler school,  
the two Mr. Pinckneys, which in­  
duces me to conclude, that our new  
ambaflador has many powerful old  
friends in England. Whether this is a  
recommendation of him for the office  
or not, I have other reasons to be­  
lieve that his family have had their  
eyes fixed upon the embafly of St.  
James&#x27;s for many years, even before  
1 was fer.t there, and that they con­  
tributed to limit the duration of my  
commiffio:i to three years, in order  
to make way for themselves to fuc-  
C«ed me. I wish they may find as Dut Sir,  
much honor and pleasure in it as, IT was only on \%fterday that I  
they expected, and that the public received the letter you did me the honor  
may derive from it, dignity and utrl- i to write to me, on the sixteenth of Sep­  
ity. But knowing as I do, the long 1 tember. For the friendly and refpe£t

Quwcy, May, 1792.  
DEAR sir,  
THE firft thing I have to communication to  
you mull be art explanation of the date of my  
letter. The Lcgiliature of Mafiachtlfetts lalt  
v inter, upon a petition of the North Parith, in  
Braintree, feparaied tt front the reft of the  
town, eretfted it into a new one, and gave it  
the name of Quincy. By this meafure you fee  
they have depuved me of my title of “ Duke  
of Braintree,” and made it nece/Tary that my  
tiiends fttould wiite me in future, as an inhab­  
itant of Qjiircy. 80 much for this Brimbcrion.  
Something that inierefts me much more is  
your obliging letter of the 12th of this month.  
I ihould have been happy to have feen Mr,  
Pinckney btforc his departure ; but more from  
individual curiofny, than from any opinion,  
that I conld have given him. any information  
c&gt;f importance to him. IT he has the talent of  
4- arching hearts he will not be long at a lofs.  
if he has not, no information of mine can give  
it him.  
The Duke of Leeds, once enquired of me  
very kindly, after his clafs mates at Weftmin­  
fter fchool, the two Mr. Pinckneys, which in­  
duces me to conclude, that rur new ambafia­  
dor has many powerful old friends in England.  
Whether this is a recommendation of him lor  
the office or not, I have other reafons to be­  
lieve that his fi«m;ly have had their eyes fixed  
upon the embatiy of St. James’for many years,  
even before I was fent there, and that they con­  
tributed to limit rhe duration of my comm ffion  
to three years, in order to make way for them  
fdves to fucceed me. 1 wifh they may find as  
much honor and pie. fure in it as they expected,  
and that the public may derive from it, dignity  
and utility. But knowing as I do, the long  
intrigue, and fufpeiflir,g as I do, much Britiffi  
influence in the appoi tment, were 1 in any ex­  
ecu&#x27;ive department, 1 ffiould take the liberty to  
keep a vigilant eye upon them.

ccc:| t i t n y inaiiN) i* r j t&#x27;ur rciicciiuus tin  
the Date of the union, which I have read with  
all the pleafure which ihe inte licence, iniorma­  
licp, accuracy and elegance of the remarks on  
Lord Sheffield infpired.  
There is ore iecret which ycu mud be care­  
ful to keep, manufactures mud have good gov*  
crr.mcnt. They cannot exid where they are  
without it, much lefs can they be introduced  
where they are net. But a great pait of the  
people of America, appear to be fo determined  
to have no government at all, that if you let  
them know the whole truth you will excite an  
unmanageable party sgainft manufactures.—  
Manufactures cannot much lefs thrive, without  
honor, fidelity, punctuality, public ?nd private  
faith, a facred re peCt to property, and the  
moral obligation of promifes and contracts ;  
virtues and habits which never did, and never  
will generally prevail in any populous nation,  
without a dtcifive as well as an inted&#x27;gent and  
honed government. The fcieuce of political  
ceconomy h but a late dudv, and is not yet gen­  
erally underllood among us. Though I have  
read mod of the authors of reputa ion on the  
fubjeCt, both among the French and the Eng,  
liffi, I pretend not u&gt; have digeded any thing  
relative to it, with the precilion of a inaftcr.—  
But to me it appears, that the general interell  
cf agriculture in particular, as well as of the  
nau#n in general, will be promoted by a dif­  
creet and judicious encouragement, of manti  
faClurcs, and that it is not the land jobber, who  
can be benefited in the rapid rife of his mo­  
nopoly, by drawing every laboring hand into  
the w ilder refs to fall tree?.  
The continual acceffion of foreigners will  
endanger and dedroy cur peace, if we know  
not how to govern them. They will moreover  
corrupt our eleClions, and tear us to pieces.—  
Sufficient to the day, however, is its evil, and  
in that day and hour it always has been, and I  
doubt not aiw-’ays will be, given us to provide  
againll its dangers
