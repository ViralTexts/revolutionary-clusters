That some Rivers run into the Sea is beyond a doubt: Such, for Instance, are the Amazones, and I think the Oranoko and the Missisipi. The Proof is, that their Waters are fresh quite to the Sea, and out to some Distance from the Land. Our Question is, whether the fresh Waters of those Rivers whose Beds are filled with Salt Water to a considerable Distance up from the Sea (as the Thames, the Delaware, and the Rivers that communicate with Chesapeak Bay in Virginia) do ever arrive at the Sea? and as I suspect they do not,

ses of Evaporation. While the River runs in a narrow confined Channel in the upper hilly Country, only a small Surface is exposed; a greater as the River widens. Now if a River ends in a Lake, as some do, whereby its Waters are spread so wide as that the Evaporation is equal to the Sum of all its Springs, that Lake will never overflow: And if instead of ending in a Lake, it was drawn into greater Length as a River, so as to expose a Surface equal, in the whole to that Lake, the Evaporation would be equal, and such River would end as a Canal; when the Ignorant might suppose, as they actually do in such cases, that the River loses itself by running under ground, whereas in truth it has run up into the Air.  
Now many Rivers that are open to the Sea, widen much before they arrive at it, not merely by the additional Waters they receive, but by having their Course stopt by the opposing Flood Tide; by being turned back twice in twenty-four Hours, and by finding broader Beds in the low flat Countries to dilate themselves in; hence the Evaporation of the fresh Water is proportionably increas’d, so that in some Rivers it may equal the Springs of Supply. In such cases, the Salt Water comes up the River, and meets the fresh in that part where, if there were a Wall or Bank of Earth across from Side to Side, the River would form a Lake, fuller indeed at some times than at others according to the Seasons, but whose Evaporation would, one time with another, be equal to its Supply.  
When the Communication between the two kinds of Water is open, this supposed Wall of Separation may be conceived as a moveable one, which is not only pushed some Miles higher up the River by every Flood Tide from the Sea, and carried down again as far by every Tide of Ebb, but which has even this Space of Vibration removed nearer to the Sea in wet Seasons, when the Springs and Brooks in the upper Country are augmented by the falling Rains so as to swell the River, and farther from the Sea in dry Seasons.  
Within a few Miles above and below this moveable Line of Separation, the different Waters mix a little, partly by their Motion to and fro, and partly from the greater specific Gravity of the Salt Water, which inclines it to run under the Fresh, while the fresh Water being lighter runs over the Salt.  
Cast your Eye on the Map of North America, and observe the Bay of Chesapeak in Virginia, mentioned above; you will see, communicating with it by their Mouths, the great Rivers Sasquehanah, Potowmack, Rappahanock, York and James, besides a Number of smaller Streams each as big as the Thames. It has been propos’d by philosophical Writers, that to compute how much Water any River discharges into the Sea, in a given time, we should measure its Depth and Swiftness at any Part above the Tide, as, for the Thames, at Kingston or Windsor. But can one imagine, that if all the Water of those vast Rivers went to the Sea, it would not first have pushed the Salt Water out of that narrow-mouthed Bay, and filled it with fresh? The Sasquehanah alone would seem to be sufficient for this, if it were not for the Loss by Evaporation. And yet that Bay is salt quite up to Annapolis.  
As to our other Subject, the different Degrees of Heat imbibed from the Sun’s Rays by Cloths of different Colours, since I cannot find the Notes of my Experiment to send you, I must give it as well as I can from Memory.  
But first let me mention an Experiment you may easily make your self. Walk but a quarter of an Hour in your Garden when the Sun shines, with a Part of your Dress white, and a Part black; then apply your Hand to them alternately, and you will find a very great Difference in their Warmth. The Black will be quite hot to the Touch, the White still cool.  
Another. Try to fire Paper with a burning Glass. If it is White, you will not easily burn it; but if you bring the Focus to a black Spot or upon Letters written or printed, the Paper will immediately be on fire under the Letters.  
  
Thus Fullers and Dyers find black Cloths, of equal Thickness with white ones, and hung out equally wet, dry in the Sun much sooner than the white, being more readily heated by the Sun’s Rays. It is the same before a Fire; the Heat of which sooner penetrates black Stockings than white ones, and so is apt sooner to burn a Man’s Shins. Also Beer much sooner warms in a black Mug set before the Fire, than in a white one, or in a bright Silver Tankard.  
My Experiment was this. I took a number of little Square Pieces of Broad Cloth from a Taylor’s Pattern Card, of various Colours. There were Black, deep Blue, lighter Blue, Green, Purple, Red, Yellow, White, and other Colours or Shades of Colours. I laid them all out upon the Snow in a bright Sunshiny Morning. In a few Hours (I cannot now be exact as to the Time) the Black being warm’d most by the Sun was sunk so low as to be below the Stroke of the Sun’s Rays; the dark Blue almost as low, the lighter Blue not quite so much as the dark, the other Colours less as they were lighter; and the quite White remain’d on the Surface of the Snow, not having entred it at all. What signifies Philosophy that does not apply to some Use? May we not learn from hence, that black Cloaths are not so fit to wear in a hot Sunny Climate or Season as white ones; because in such Cloaths the Body is more heated by the Sun when we walk abroad and are at the same time heated by the Exercise, which double Heat is apt to bring on putrid dangerous Fevers? That Soldiers and Seamen who must march and labour in the Sun, should in the East or West Indies have an Uniform of white? That Summer Hats for Men or Women, should be white, as repelling that Heat which gives the Headachs to many, and to some the fatal Stroke that the French call the Coup de Soleil? That the Ladies Summer Hats, however should be lined with Black, as not reverberating on their Faces those Rays which are reflected upwards from the Earth or Water? That the putting a white Cap of Paper or Linnen within the Crown of a black Hat, as some do, will not keep out the Heat, tho’ it would if plac’d without[?] That Fruit Walls being black’d may receive so much Heat from the Sun in the Daytime, as to continue warm in some degree thro’ the Night, and thereby preserve the Fruit from Frosts, or forward its Growth?— with sundry other particulars of less or greater Importance, that will occur from time to time to attentive Minds?

S to our other fubjeé, the aif-  
A ferent degrees of heat imbibed  
from the fun’s rays by cloths of dif-  
ferent colours, fince I cannot find  
the notes of my experiment to fend  
you, I muft give it as well as I can  
from memory.  
  
Bat firft let me mention an expe-  
riment you may eafily make your-  
felf. Walk but a quarter of an hour  
  
in your garden when the fun fhines,  
  
with a part of your drefs white, and  
a part black; then apply your hand  
to them aliernately, and you will  
find a very great difference in their  
warmth. The black will be quite  
hot to the touch, the white ftill cool.  
  
Another. Try to fire paper with  
a burning glafs. If it is white, you  
will not eafily burn it;—but if you  
bring the focus to a black fpot, or  
upon letters, written or printed, the  
paper will immediately be on fire  
under the letters.  
  
Thus fullers and dyers find black  
cleths, of equal thicknefs with white  
ones, and hung out equaily wet, dry  
in the fun much fooner than the white,  
being more readily heated by the  
fun’s rays. It is the fame before a  
fire; the heat-of which fooner pene-  
trates black ftockings than white  
ones, and fo is apt fooner to burn  
a man’s fhins. Alfo, beer much  
fooner warms in a black mug fet be-  
fore the fire, than in a white one, or  
in a bright filver tankard.  
  
My experiment was this. I took  
a number of little fquare pieces of  
broad cloth from a taylor’s pattern  
card, of various colours. There  
were black, deep blue, lighter blue,  
green, purple, red, yellaw, white,  
and other colours, or fhades of co.  
Jours. I laid them all out upon the  
fnow in a bright fun-fhiny morn-  
ing. In afew hours, (I cannot now  
be exact as to the time) the black be-  
  
ing warmed moft by the fun, wa |  
funk fo low as to be below the flroke ©  
of the fun’s rays; the dark blucal. |  
moft as low, the lighter blue not 9  
quite fo much as the dark, the other i  
colours lefs as they were lighter; and  
the quite white remained on the fur. |  
face of the {fnow, not having entered 77  
it at all.  
  
What fignifies philofophy that does  
not apply to fome ufe ?—May we |  
not learn from hence, that black ©  
clothes are not fo fit to wear inahot ©  
funny climate or feafon, as white 7

double heat is apt to bring on putrid  
dangerous fevers? That foldiers and ©  
feamen who muft march and labour |  
in the fun, flould in the Eaf o F  
Weft Indies have an uniform of white?  
That fummer hats fur men or wo-

First, let me mention an experiment you may  
easily make yourself. W&#x27;alk a quarter of an  
hour in your garden when the sun shines, with  
a part of your dress white and a part black—  
you will find a very great difference in their  
warmth. The black will be quite hot to the  
touch—the white still cold.  
  
Another .—^Try to fire paper with a burning  
glass. If it is white you will not easily burn  
it—^but if you bring the focus to a black spot,  
or upon letters written or printed, the paper  
will immediately be on fire under the letters.  
  
Thus fullers and dyers-find black cloth.s, of  
equal thickness with white, and hung out e-  
qually wet, dry in the sun much sooner than  
the white, being more readily heated by the  
sun’s rays. It is the same before a fire, the  
heat of which sooner penetrates black stock¬  
ings than white ones. Also beer much soon¬  
er warms in a black mug than a white one, or  
in a bright silver tankard.  
  
My experiment was this :—I took a num¬  
ber of little square pieces of broadcloth from a  
tailor’s pattern card, pf various colours; there  
were black, dwp blue, lighter blue,green, yel¬  
low, white, and Other colours or shades of co¬  
lours. I laid them all out upon the snow in a !  
bright sunshiny morning, la a few-hours, (f  
cannot be precise as to the time the black be¬  
ing warmed most by the sun, was so low as to  
be below the stroke of the sun’s rays the  
dark blue almost ai low, the lighter blue not  
quite so much as tb| dark, the other colours  
less as they were lighter—and the white quite  
remained on the suoace of the snow, not hav¬  
ing entered at all.

Black cloths are not so fit to wear  
in a hot sunny climate, or season, as  
white ones ; because, in such cloths  
the body is more heated by the sun  
when we walk abroad, and is the same  
time heated by the exercise, which  
double heat is apt to bring on putrid  
fevers. Soldiers and seamen, who  
must march and labour in the sun,  
should, in the East or West Indies,  
have a uniform of white. Summer  
hats, for men or women, should be  
white, as repelling that heat which  
gives head-achs to many, and to some  
the fatal stroke called by the French  
the coup de soliel. Ladies’ summer  
  
hats, however, should be lined with  
_black, as not reverberating on their  
faces those rays which are reflected

clothes, the body is more heated by the sun when we walk abroad, and are at  
the same time heated by the exercise, which double heat is apt to bring on  
putrid dangerous fevers.” He, therefore, thinks that soldiers and sailors in  
tropical climates should wear white uniforms, and that white hats should b
