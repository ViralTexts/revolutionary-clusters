rison after being drove from the out lines &amp; retiring within the Fort surrendered themselves Prisoners of War, and giving me no Acct of the terms. By a Letter wch I have just receivd from Genl Greene at Fort Lee (wch is opposite to Fort Washington) I am informd that “one of the Train of Artillery came across the River last Night on a Raft—by his Acct the Enemy have suffered greatly on the North side of Fort Washington—Colo. Rawlings’s Regiment (late Hugh Stephenson’s) was posted there, and behaved with great Spirit—Colo. Magaw could not get the Men to Man the Lines, otherwise he would not have given up the Fort.”  
This is a most unfortunate affair and has given me great Mortification as we have lost not only two thousand Men that were there, but a good deal of Artillery, &amp; some of the best Arms we had. And what adds to my Mortification is, that this Post after the last Ships went by it, was held contrary to my Wishes &amp; opinion; as I conceived it to be a dangerous one: but being determind on by a full Council of General Officers, &amp; receiving a resolution of Congress strongly expressive of their desires, that the Channel of the River (which we had been labouring   
  
to stop a long while at this place) might be obstructed, if possible; &amp; knowing that this could not be done unless there were Batteries to protect the Obstruction I did not care to give an absolute Order for withdrawing the Garrison till I could get round &amp; see the Situation of things &amp; then it became too late as the Fort was Invested. I had given it, upon the passing of the last Ships, as my opinion to Genl Greene under whose care it was, that it would be best to evacuate the place—but—as the order was discretionary, &amp; his opinion differed from mine, it unhappyly was delayd too long, to my great grief, as I think Genl Howe considering his Army &amp; ours, would have had but a poor tale to have told without it &amp; would have found it difficult, unless some Southern Expedition may prove successful, to have reconciled the People of England to the Conquest of a few pitiful Islands, none of wch were defensable considering the great number of their ships &amp; the power they have by Sea to Surround &amp; render them unapproachable.  
Your Letter of the 30th of Octr was delivered to me a few days ago by Colo. Woodford—It is a matter of great grief and surprize to me, to find the different States so slow, and inattentive to that essential business of levying their quota’s of Men—In ten days from this date, there will not be above 2000 Men, if that, on this Side Hudson’s River (of the fixed &amp; establish’d Regiments) to oppose Howes whole Army, and very little more on the other to secure the Eastern Colonies and the Important Passes leading through the Highlands to Albany &amp; the Country about the Lakes. In short it is impossible for me in the compass of a Letter to give you any Idea of our Situation—of my difficulties—&amp; the constant perplexities &amp; mortifications I constantly meet with, derived from the unhappy policy of short enlistments, &amp; delaying them too long. Last fall or Winter; before the Army which was then to be raised, was set about, I represented in clear &amp; explicit terms the evils wch would arise from short Inlistments—the expence that must attend the raising of an Army every year—the futility of such an Army when raised; and, in a word, if I had spoke with a prophetick spirit, could not have foretold the evils with more accuracy than I did—all the year since I have been pressing them to delay no time in engaging Men upon such terms as would Insure success, telling them that the longer it was delayed the more difficult it would grow; but the measure was not set about till it was too late to be effected, &amp; then in such a manner as to bid adieu to every hope of getting an Army from which any Services are to be expected. the different States without regard to the merits or qualifications of an Officer, quarrelling about the appointments; &amp; nominating such as are not fit to be Shoe Blacks from the local attachments of this or that Member of Assembly.  
  
I am wearied almost to death with the retrog[r]ade Motions of things, and Solemnly protest that a pecuniary rewd of 20,000 £s a year would not induce me to undergo what I do; and after all perhaps, to loose my Character as it is impossible, under such a variety of distressing Circumstances to conduct Matters agreeable to public expectation or even of those who employ me—as they will not make proper allowances for the difficulties their own errors have occasioned.  
I am glad to find by your last Letter that your family are tolerably well recoverd from the Indispositions they labourd under. God grant you all health &amp; happiness—nothing in this world would contribute so much to mine as to be once more fixed among you in the peaceable enjoymt of my own vine, &amp; fig Tree.

Hackinsae, (Jersey,) where our little army was then encamped,

ten days from this date, there will not be above two thousand men, if that number,  
of the fixed established regiments on this side of Hudson’s River to oppose Howe’s  
whole army, and very little more on the other to secure the eastern colonies and  
the important passes leading through the Highlands to Albany, and the country  
about the Lakes. In short, it is impossible for me, in the compass of a letter, to  
give you any idea of our situation, of my difficulties, and of the constant perplexities  
and mortifications I meet with, derived from the unhappy policy of short enlistments,  
and delaying them too long. Last fall, or winter, before the army, which was then  
to be raised, was set about, I represented in clear and explicit terms the evils which  
would arise from short enlistments, the expense which must attend the raising an  
army every year; the futility of such an army when raised; and, if I had spoken  
with a prophetic spirit, I could not have foretold the evils with more accuracy than  
I did. All the year since, I have been pressing Congress to delay no time in  
engaging men upon such terms as would insure success, telling them that the  
longer it was delayed the more difficult it would prove. But the measure was not  
commenced till it was too late to be effected, and then in such a manner, as to bid  
adieu to every hope of getting an army, from which any services are to be expected ;  
the different States, without regard to the qualifications of an officer, quarrelling  
about the appointments, and nominating such as are not fit to be shoeblacks, from  
the local attachments of this or that member of Assembly.  
  
“TI am wearied almost to death with the retrograde motion of things, and I  
solemnly protest, that a pecuniary reward of twenty thousand pounds a year would  
not induce me to undergo what I do; and after all, perhaps, to lose my character,  
as it is impossible, under such a variety of distressing circumstances, to conduct  
matters agreeably to public expectation, or even to the expectation of those who  
employ me, as they will not make proper allowances for the difficulties their own  
errors have occasioned.

The loss of Fort Washington was at the time a serious  
affair, and was a subject of much anxiety to General  
Washington, against whose withes it had been held. Lee,  
writing about it, calls it a &quot;cursed affair,&quot; and Washington

This is a most unfortunate affair, and has given me great

Boston, who passed and repassed safely across the river and amidst

them off; but it was too late, and soon “the sight of the  
American flag hauled down and the British flag waving in  
its place, told Washington of the surrender.”  
  
The loss in killed and wounded was surprisingly small,  
but the prisoners numbered nearly three thousand, half of  
whom were good soldiers. The reverse was the worst  
which had yet befallen the cause. ‘“ And,” as Washington  
wrote to his brother, “what adds to my mortification is  
that this post, after the last ships went past it, was held  
contrary to my wishes and opinion, as I conceived it to be  
a hazardous one,” and if, as some have thought, it is stil

from Hackensack: “I am worried almost  
to death with the retrograde motion of  
things, and I solemuly protest that a pecun-

you in the peaceable enjoyment of my own

In September, 1776, Congress adopted a  
plan for the reorganization of the rmy,  
but it left so much to the States that it  
was very unsatisfactory. Washington  
urged the different States to appoint com­  
missioners to co-operate with him, and la­  
bored hard to get the new system into  
working order, but with poor success. Dan­  
gers and difficulties increased and multi­  
plied. In a private letter, written about  
this time, Washington wrote:

retrograde motion of things, and I solemn-
