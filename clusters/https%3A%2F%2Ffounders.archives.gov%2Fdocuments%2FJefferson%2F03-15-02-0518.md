Monticello, April 22, 1820.—I thank you, clear  
sir, for the copy you have been so kind as to  
send me of the letter to your constituents on  
the Missouri Question. It is a perfect justifi­  
cation to them. I had for a long time ceased  
to read newspapers or pay any attention to pub­  
lic affairs, confident that they were in good  
hands, and content to be a passenger in our bark  
to the shore from which I am not distant. But  
this momentous question, like a fire bell in the J  
night, awakened and filled me with terror. I ;  
considered it at once as the knel of the Union, j  
It is hushed indeed for the moment—but this is  
a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A geo­  
graphical line, coinciding with a marked prin­  
ciple, moral and political, once conceived and  
held up to the angry passions of men, will ne­  
ver be obliterated; and every new irritation  
will mark it deeper and deeper. I can say with  
conscious truth, that there is not a man on earth  
who would sacrifice more than I would to re­  
lieve us from this heavy reproach in any practi­  
cable way. The cession of that kind ol property,  
for so it is misnamed, is a bagatelle, which  
would not cost me a sec on cl thought, if,  
in that way, a general emancipation and  
expatriation could be effected; and gradu­  
ally and with due sacrifices, I think it might be  
But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and  
we can neither hold him nor let him go.  
Justice is in one scale and self-preservation in  
the other. Of one thing I am certain, that, as  
  
he passage of slaves from one State to another,  
vould not make a slave of a single human being  
vho would not be so without it, so their diffu­  
ion over a greater surface would make them  
ndividually happier, and proportionably facili­  
ate the accomplishment of their emancipation  
&gt;y dividing the burden on a greater number of  
;oadjutors. An abstinence too from this act of  
&gt;ower, would remove the jealousy excited by  
he -undertaking of Congress to regulate the  
ondition of the different descriptions of men  
omposing a State. This certainly is the ex­  
lusive right of every State, which nothing in  
he Constitution has taken from and given to  
he general Government. Could Congress, for  
xample, say that the non-freemen of Connec­  
icut shall be freemen,or that they shall not em­  
grate to any other State?  
&#x27; I regret that I am now to die in the belief that  
;he useless sacrifice of themselves, by the gene­  
ration of *76, to acquire self-government and  
Happiness to their country, is to be thrown  
away by the unwise and unworthy passions of  
their sons, and that my only consolation is to be,  
that I live not to weep over it. If they would  
hut dispassionately weigh the blessings they  
would throw away, against an abstract princi­  
ple more likely to be effected by an .union than  
by scisism, they would pause before they would  
perpetrate this act of suicide on themselves  
and of treason against the hopes of the world.  
To yourself, as the faithful advocate of union,  
I tender the offering of-my high esteem and re­  
spect. TH: JEFFERSON

so kind as to send me of the letter to your constitu­  
ents on the Missouri Question. It is a peilect  
justification to them- I had for a kmg time ceased  
to read newspapers or pay any attention to public  
affairs, confident that they were in good hands, and  
content to be a passenger in our bulk to the shore  
from which I am not distant  
question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and  
filled me with terror. I considered it at once as  
the knell of the Union. It is husliid indeed for  
the moment—but this is a reprieve only, not a final  
sentence. A geogtaphical line, coinciding with a  
marked principle, moral and political, once con  
ceived and held up to the angry passions of men  
will never be obliterated; and every new irritation  
will nvttk it deeper and deeper. I can say with  
truth, that there is not a man on  
Annex  
Bat this momentous  
conscious  
earth who would sacrifice more than I would to re  
lieve us from this heavy reproach in any practica  
lie way. The cession of that kind of pioptily,  
for so it is misnamed, is a bagatelle, which would  
not cost me a second thought, it, in that way, a  
general emancipation and expatriation could be  
effected; and gradually and with due sactificrs I  
think it might be.— But as it is, we have the wolf  
by the ear, and we can neither hold him nor let  
him go. Justice is in one scale and self préserva  
eion in the other. Of one thing I am certain, that,  
as the passage of slaves trom one State to another,  
would not make a slave of a single human being  
who would not be so without it, so their diffu  
si,in over a gieater surface would make them imli  
vidually happier, and proportionally facilitate the  
accomplishment of their emancipation, ny dividing  
the burden on a greater number ol coadjutors.—  
An abstinence too from this act of power, would  
remove the jealousy exci&#x27;ed by the undertaking ol  
Con -ress to regulate the condition of ihe different  
descriptions of men composing a State. This  
certainly is the exclusive light of every Stale,  
which nothing in the Constitution has taken hum  
them and given to the general Government. Could  
Congress, lor example, say that the non-freemen  
of Connecticut shall be freemen, or they shall not  
emigrate to any other State {  
I regret that lam now to die in the belief that  
;ht useless sacrifice of themselves, by the genera  
iion of &#x27;76. to acquire self-government and hap; i  
nes» to their country, is to be thrown away by ihr  
unwise and unworthy passions ol their s&#x27;-ns. and  
that my only consolation is to he, that I live not to  
Weep over it. If they would but dispassiona&#x27;ely  
weigh the blessings they would throw away, against  
an abstract principle more likely to be effected hy  
union than by scission, they would pause delore they  
would perpetrate this act of suicide on Ihemselve­  
and ot treason against the hopes of die world  
To yourself, as the fai htol advocate of union, I  
tender the off, ring of my high esteem and respect

only purpose, therefore, which these men  
can have in broaching anew the principle  
which produced the difficulty in the Mis­  
souri question, to make it pervade the. Pre­  
sidential contests, is to bring about the re­  
sults to which we referred yesterday, and  
which was so deeply deplored by Mr. Jef­  
ferson in the letter to- Mr. Short, from  
which we quoted. Of the same tenor is  
the following letter to John Holmes:  
Monticello, April 22, 1820.  
I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you  
have been so kind as to send me of the  
letter to your constituents on the Missouri  
question. It is a perfect justification to  
them. I had for a long time ceased to  
read newspapers, or pay any attention to  
ublic affairs, confident they were in good  
ands, and content to be a passenger in  
our bark to the shore from which I am  
not distant. But this momentous question,  
like a fire bell in the night, awakened and  
filled me with terror. I considered it at  
once as the knell of the Union. It is  
hushed, indeed, for the moment. But  
this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence.  
A geographical line, coinciding with a  
marked principle, moral and political,

passions of men, will never be obliterated ;

of Maine, who had sent him a copy of his letter to his  
constituents. in which he assigned his reasons for hav­  
ing voted for the unrestricted admission of Missouri  
into the Union, he says that ‘‘this question (:he Mis­  
souri question) had like a fire-bell in the night, awaken­  
ed and filled him with terrer.”” He consicered it at  
once ‘‘as the knell of the union.”” He feared it was  
only ‘“‘suspended, not settled.”” He remarks, ““on the  
subject of slaves, there is not a man on earth who  
would sacrifice mnore than I would, to relieve us from  
this heavy reproach in any practicable way &#x27;The  
cession of that kind of property, forso it is inisnamed,

fFexpatriation could be effected, and gridualiy,  
with due sacrifices, T think it might be. But as it is,  
we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold  
him, nor safely let him go.”” He further urges that  
diffusion would not have the effect of increasing the  
number of slaves, but would make them individually  
happier and facilitate their emancipation. These are  
arguments now used by the friends of the annesxatio

I thank yon, dear, sir, for the copy you have  
been so kind as to send me, of the letter to vour  
constituents on the Missouri question. It is a per­  
fect justification to them, | had for a long time  
ceased to read newspapers, or pay any attention to  
public affairs, confident they were in good hands,  
and content to he a passenger in our hark to the  
shore from which I am not distant. But this mo  
mentous question, like a fire-hell in the night,  
awakened and filled me with terror. I consider­  
ed it at once as the knell of the Union. It is  
hushed, for the moment j hut this is a reprieve  
only, not a final sentence. A geographical line,  
coinciding with a marked principle, moral ami po­  
litical, once conceived and held up to the angry  
passions inen, will never he obliterated j and every  
new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. I  
can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a  
man on earth who would sacrifice more than I  
would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in  
any practicable way. The cession of that kind of  
property [fur so it is misnamed] is a bagatelle  
would not cost men second thought,if, in that way,  
a general emancipation and expatriation could be  
effected gradually ; and with due sacrifices, 1 think  
it might he. But. as it is. we have the wolf by  
the ears; and we ran neither hold him, nor safe­  
ly let him go. Of one thing / am certain—that  
as the passage of slaves from one Slate to anolli  
er would not make a slave of a single human he  
ing who would not be so&#x27;without it, so their  
diffusion over a greater surface would make  
them individually happier, and proportionally  
facilitate the accomplishment of their cmancipa  
lion by dividing the burden on a greater number  
of coadjutors. An abstinence, too from this act of  
power, would remove the jealousy excited by the  
undertaking of Congress to regulate the condition  
of the different descriptions of men composing a

every State, which nothing in the constitution had

ment. Could Congress, for example, say th.u  
the non freemen of Connecticut should lie freemen,  
or that they shall not emigrate into aov other  
Slate ?  
  
I regret that / am now to die in the belief that  
the unless sacrifice of themselves by the genera­  
tion of 1776 to acquire self government and hap  
piness to their country, is in he thrown away by  
ihe unwise and unworthy passions of their sons.  
and that my only consolation is to be, that l live  
not to weep over it. If they would but dispassion­  
ately weigh the blessings they will throw away  
against an abstract principle more likely to bo ef­  
fected by the union than by secession, they  
would pause before they perpetrated this act of

&quot;Monticbllo, April 22, 1830.  
To John IIolmes: 1 thank you, dear sir, for the copy you  
  
ivo been so kind as to nonet me of the letter to your conituents  
on the Missouri question. It it a perfect jutly/icain  
to them. I hail for a long time ceased to read the newsi|?&#x27;rs,  
or pay any attention to public ntfairs, confident  
ey wore in good hands, and content to bo a passenger in  
ir bark to tlm shore from which I am not distant. But  
is momentous question, like a fire-bell in the night,  
vakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once  
i the knell of the Union. It is hushed, indeed, for the moent  
; but thit it a rcpriere only, not a final trntenre. A geoaphicnl  
lino, coinciding with a marked principle, moral  
id |K&gt;iittcal, once conceived and held up to the angry pus!&gt;n*  
of men, will never bo obliterated ; and every new irrition  
will mark it deeper and deefier.  
&quot;I can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man  
i earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve  
i from this heavy reproach in any practicable way. The cosm  
of that kind of property (far so it is misnamed) isabagalle  
which would not cost me a second thought, i(in that irav  
pUruition coM be eflrctvl ; and gradually, and with du  
orifices, I think it might be. But, as it is, we have the  
olf by ihe ears, and we can neith&#x27; r hold him nor safely let  
m go. Justice is in one scale, awl self-preservation in the  
her. Ol one thing I am certain, that as rnk passage or  
AVIS FROM ONE .STATE TO ANOTHER WOULD NOT MAKE A  
AVI or A BJNGlaK HUMAN BEIMl WHO WOfTLD NOT BE no

Montickllo, April 22, 1820.  
I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you havp  
bpen so kind as to send me ol the letter to your  
constituents on the Missouri question. It is a  
perfect justification to them. I had for a long  
lime ceased to read newspapers, or pay any attendon  
to public affairs, confident they were in  
good hands, and content to be a passenger in our  
barque to the shorp from which I am not dis.  
tant. Rut this momentous question, like a fire  
bell in the night, awakened and filled me with  
terror. I considered it at once the knell of the  
Union. It is hushed, indeed, for the moment.  
But this isa reprieve only?not a final sentence.  
A geographical line, coinciding with a marked  
principle, moral and political, once conceived  
and held up to the angry passions of men, will  
never be obliterated; and even* new irritation  
will make it deeper and deeper. I can say,  
with conscious truth, that there is not a man on  
earth, who would not sacrifice more than I  
would to relieve us from this heavy reproach,  
in any practical way. The cpssion of that kind  
of property (for so it is misnamed) is a bagatelle,  
which would not cost mc a second thought,  
if in that way a gerpral emancipation and ex.  
patriation could be effected; and gradually, and

there is nota man on earth who would sacrifice  
more than I would to relieve us from this heavy re-  
peenos in any practicable way. The cession of that  
  
ind of property (for so it is misnamed) is a baga-  
telle, which would not cost me a second thonght, if  
in that way a general emancipation and expatriation  
could be effected; and gradually, and with due sac-  
rifices, I think it might be. But as itis, we -have the  
wolf 2 the ears, and we can _ neither hold him. nor  
sately let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self pre-  
servation in the other. Of one thing J am certain,  
that as the passage of slaves from one free State to  
another would not make a slave of a single human  
being who would not be so without it, so their diffu-  
sion over a greater surface would make them indi-  
vidually happier, and proportionally facilitate the ac-  
complishment of their emancipation. by dividing the  
burden on a greater number of coadjutors. An ab-  
stinence, too, from this act of power, would remove  
the jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress  
to regulate the condition of the different descriptions  
of men composing a State. This certainly is the ex-  
clusive right of every State, which nothing in the  
Constitution has taken from them, and given to the  
General Government. Could Congress, for example,  
say that the non-freemen, of Connecticut shall be  
freemen, or that they shall not emigrate into any  
other State,  
  
“I regret that I am now to die in the belief that the  
useless sacrifice of themselves by the generation of  
1776, to acquire self-government and happiness to  
their country, is to be thrown away by the unwise

ly consolation 1s to be, that I shail live not to weep

blessings they will throw away, against an abstract  
Principle, more likely to be effected by union than by  
scission, they would pause before they would perpe-

sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a  
marked principle, moral and political, once concei-

never be obliterated: and every new irritation will  
mark it deeper and deeper. I can say, with con-

r &quot;I thank you, ilem sir, lor the copy you have been so

_ a reprieve only, not a final sentence. A geographical line,  
8 coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political,  
, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men,  
1 will never he obliterated ; and every new irritation will  
I mark it deeper and deeper. I can say, with conscious

1 more than 1 would to relieve us from this heavy reproach,  
- in any practicable way. The cession of that kind of propert

/ as the pass ige ol slave* from one free fckate to another

remove the jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress

&quot;I thankyou, dear sir, for the copy yorj  
have been so kind as to send me of the let­  
ter to your constituents on the Missouri  
question. It is a perfect justification of  
them. I had for a long time ceased to read  
newspapers, or pay any attention to public  
affairs, confident they were in good hands  
and content to be a passenger in our bark  
to the shore from which I am not distant  
But this momentous question, like fire a  
bell in the night, awakened and filled me  
with terror. 1 mnsidrred it, at once, at  
  
the knell of the Union. It is hushed in-  
f1(r the moment.  
But this is a reprive  
only, not a nnai sentence, a geograpnicai  
line coinciding with a marked principle,  
moral ard political,&#x27; once conceived and  
held up to the angry passions of men, will  
never be obliterated; and every new irrita­  
tion will mark it deeper and deeper. But  
as it is, we have the wolf by the ears and  
w can neither hold nim, nor safely let him  
go. Justice is in one scale, and self pre­  
servation in the other. Of one thing I am cer-  
tain, that as the passage of slaves&#x27;1 fron one &quot;  
State to another wonldnQt oakeAttave of  
a single human being, who would not be so  
without it, so their diffusion over a greater  
surface, would make them individually hap­  
pier, and proportionately facilitate the ac  
complishment oi meir emancipation, oy di­  
viding the burthen on a greater number of

coadjutors. An absunance, too, irom mis  
act of power would remove the jealousy  
excited by the understanding of Congress  
to regulate the condition of the dinerent  
descriptions of men composing a State.  
This certainly is the exclusive right of ev­  
ery State, which nothing in the constitution  
has taken from them, and given to th gen­  
eral government. Could Congress, for ex­  
ample, say that the now freemen of Con­  
necticut, shall not be freemen, or that they  
shall not emigrate into any other State.?&quot;

&quot; Mohticeilo, April 22, 1820.  
? To John Holmes.  
&quot;I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have been so kind  
as to send me of the letter to your constituents on the Mis­  
souri question. It is a perfect justification to ihem. I had  
for a long time ceased to read newspapers, or pay any atten­  
tion to public aflairs, confident they were in good hands, and  
content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which  
1 am not distant. But this momentous question, like a fire­  
bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I con­  
sidered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed,  
indeed, for the moment; but this is a reprieve only, not a  
final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a mark­  
ed principle, moral and political, once conceived and held  
up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated;  
aud every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. 1  
can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on  
earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us  
from this heavy reproach, in any practicable way. The ces­  
sion of that kind of property (for so it is misnamed) is a bag­  
atelle, which would not cost me a second thought, it, in that  
way, a general emancipation and expatriation could be ef­  
fected ; and gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it  
might be._ But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and  
we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is  
in one scale, and self-preservation in the other. Of one  
thing I am certain, that as the tree passage of slaves from one  
State to another wquM not make a slave of a single human  
being who would not be so without it, so their diffusion over  
a greater surface would make them individually happier,  
and proportionally facilitate the accompliahment of their I  
emancipation, by dividing the burden on a greater number of I  
coadjutors An abstinence, too, from this act of power, would  
remove the jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress  
to regulate the condition of the different descriptions of men |  
composing a State. This certainly is the exclusive right of  
every State, which nothing in the constitution hits taken from  
them, and given to the General Government. Could Con­  
gress, for example, say that the non-freemen of Connecticut  
shall be freemen, or that they shall not emigrate into any  
other Sute ? 6  
&quot; I regret that I am now to die in the belief that the use­  
less sacrifice of themselves bv the generation of 1776, to ac­  
quire self-government and happiness to their country, ia to  
be thrown away by the unwise and unworthy passions of their  
sons, snd that my only consolation is to be that I live not to  
weep over it. If they would but dispassionately weigh the  
blessings they will throw away, against an abstract principle,  
more likely to be effected by union than by scission, &#x27;hey  
would pause before they would perpetrate this act of suicide  
on themselves, and of treason against the hopes of the world.

&quot; Monticeixo, Aphil 22, 1820.  
&quot; To John Holmes.  
??I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have been so kind  
? as to send me of the letter to your constituents on the Mis­  
&#x27; souri question. It is a perfect justification to them. I had  
? for a long time ceased to read newspapers, or pay any atten­  
? tion to public affairs, confident they were in good hands, and  
&#x27; content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which  
? I am not distant. But this momentous question, like a fire­  
&#x27; bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. I con­  
? sidered it at onee as the knell of the Union. It is hushed,  
? indeed, for the moment; but this is a reprieve only, not a  
? final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a mark­  
? ed principle, moral and political, once conceived and held  
? up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated;  
? and every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. 1  
? can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on  
&#x27; earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us  
4 from this heavy reproach, in any practicable way. The ces­  
&quot; sion of that kind of property (for so it is misnamed) is a bag­  
? atelle, which would not cost me a second thought, it, in that  
? way, a general emsncipation and expatriation could be ef­  
? fected; and gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it  
?might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and  
? we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is  
? in one scale, and self-preservation in the other. Of one  
? thing I am certain, that as the tree passage of slaves from one  
1 State to another would not make a slave of a single human  
&#x27; being who would not be so without it, so their diffusion over  
1 a greater surface would make them individually happier,  
1 and proportionally facilitate the accomplishment ot their  
? emancipation, by dividing the burden on a greater number of  
? coadjutors An abstinence, too, from this act of power, would  
&gt; remove the jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress  
? to regulate the condition of the different descriptions of men  
1 composing a State. This certainly is the exclusive right of  
&#x27; every State, which nothing in the constitution has taken from  
? them, and given to the General Government. Could Con­  
&#x27; gress, for example, say that the non-freemen of Connecticut  
?shall be freemen, or that they shall not emigrate into any  
1 other State ?  
** I regret that I am now to die in the belief that the use­  
1 less sacrifice of themselves by the generation of 1776, to ac­  
1 quire self-government and happiness to their country, ?s to

1 sons, and that my only consolation is to be that 1 live not to

blessings they will throw away, against an abstract pnncip e,  
?more likely to be effected by union than by scission, ? ey

Monticello, April 22, 1820.  
To John Holmes : I thank you, dear  
sir, for the copy you have been so kind as  
to send me of the letter to your constitu­  
ents, on the Missouri question. It is a per­  
fect justification to them. 1 had for a lone  
time ceased to read newspapers, or pay any  
attention to public affairs, confident that  
they were in good hands, and content to be  
a passenger in our bark to the shore from  
which I am not distant. But this mo  
mentous question, like a fire-bell in the  
night, awakened and filled me with terror.  
1 considered it at once as the knell of the  
  
Union. It is hushed, indeed, for the mo­  
ment. But this is a reprieve only, not a  
final sentence. A geographical line, coin­  
ciding with a marked principle, moral and  
nnlitical. once conceived and held up to  
  
&#x27;. &#x27; I - r, ...:n . tw  
llic angry passion oi men, m ntm  
obliterated; and every new irritation will  
mark it deeper and deeper. 1 can say,  
with conscious truth, that tlicro is not a  
man on earth who would sacrifice more  
than I would to relieve us from this heavy  
renroach in anv practicable way. The  
cession of that kind of property, (for so it  
is misnamed,) is a bagatelle, which would  
not cost me a second thoueht, if, in that  
wbv. a general emancipation and cxpatria  
tion could be effected; and, gradually, and  
with due sacrifices, I think it might be.  
let lrim en. Justice is in one scale and  
self-preservation in the other. Of one  
thincr I am certain, that as the passage of  
slaves from one State to another would not  
make a slave of a single human being who  
would not he so without it, so their diffu  
sion over a irreatcr surface would make  
them individually hannier, and proportion  
ally facilitate the accomplishment ot their  
emancipation, bv dividing ttio burthen on  
a greater number of coadiutors. An an  
stinence, too, from this act of power would  
remove the jealousy excited by the under  
taking of Congress to regulate the condi  
tion of the different descriptions of men  
composing a State. This certainly is the  
exclusive right or every State, which noth  
ing in the Constitution has taken from them.  
and given to the general . government.  
Could Congress, for example, say that the  
non-freemen of Connecticut shall be free  
men,orthat they shall not emigrate into any  
other State?  
I regret that I am now to die in the be  
lief that the useless sacrifice of themselves  
by the generation of 1776, to acquire self-  
government and happiness to their country,  
is to be thrown away by the unwise and un  
worthy passions of their sons, and that my  
onlv consolation is to he, that I live not to  
weep over it. If they would but dispass  
ionately weigh the blessings tliy will throw  
away, against an abstract principle, more  
likely to be effected by union than by scis  
sion, they would pause befoie they would

&quot;1 thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have been so  
kind as to send me of the letter to your constituents on tha  
Missouri question. It is it perfect jollification to them. I  
had for a long lime ceased to read newspapers, or pay any  
afention to public allairs, confident they were in good  
hinds, and content to be a passenger in our bark to tha  
shore troin which 1 am not distant. Hut this momentous  
question, like a fire-bell in the night, awakened and  
I tilled mo with terror. 1 considered It at onoe aa tbe  
knell ot the Union. It is bushed, indeed, lor the moment.  
But this is a reprieve only, not a final seutenoe. A geo­

[ and political, once conceived and held up to tbe angry pas­

, conscious truth, that there is not a man on earth who would  
sacrifice more than 1 would to relieve us from this heavy  
; reproach, in any prarticablt way. Tho cesatw of tbat  
kind of property (for so it is misnamed) Is a bagatelle  
which would not oust me a second thought, if in that way  
a geneial emancipation and tj/iatriatirm could be effected;  
and, gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it might  
&#x27; be. But as it Is, we have the wolf by the ears, and  
we oan neither hold him nor safely let him go. Jes­  
; tioe is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.  
Of one thing 1 am certain, that as the passage of slaves  
from one State to another would not make a slave  
I of a single human being who would nor be eo with  
I out it, to their ditiunon over a greater aurlaoe would make

I too, from this act of power would rsit ore the Jealousy ex -  
l cited by ils?- undertaking of Congress to regulate tbe condi­  
tion ol the ditlerent descriptions of men composing a State.  
This certainly is the exclusive right of every State, which  
nothing In tbe constijution has taken from them and given  
I to tbe general government. Could Congress, (or example,  
I say, that the non-freemen ol (Ji nnecnoat shall be tree­

moral and political, once conceived and held up to the  
angry peesions of men, will never be obliterated; and  
every new trritatien will mark tt deeper and deeper. I  
can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on  
earth who would sacrifice more than I would to rolieve us  
Som this heavy reproach in aay pract cabls way. The  
eeasion of that kind of property (for so it is misuamed) is  
a bagatell., which would not ooat me a second thoughe if,  
in that way, a geneial emancipation and expatria.  
tion could be effected; and grasually, and with due  
sacrifice I thick it might be. But, as it is, we have the  
wolf by the ears, nd we can neither hold him nor safe-­  
F let him go. Justice is in ove soale, and self pree­  
sarvation in the other. Of one thing I am certain, that as  
the free paseage of slaves from one State to another  
woule not make a slave of a stugls human being who  
would not be so without it so their diffu-ion over a greater  
surface would make the n individually happier, and pro  
portionally facilitate the secempltan ment of their enian-­  
stpation, by cividing the burden en a greater number of  
coadjuters. Au abatinenos, too, from this act of power  
would remove the jealousy excited by the undartaviag

the exolusivs right of every State, which nothing in the  
constitution has taken from them and given to the  
Government. Could Congress, for example, say that the  
mon freemen of Comnacticut shalt be freemee, or that they  
shall not emigrate into any other State?  
I regret that I am now to ie in the belef that the use-­

&quot; I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have been  
  
so kind as to sena me of the letter to your constitu­  
ents on the Missouri question. It is a perfect justifi­  
cation to them. I had for a lone time ceased to read  
  
newspapers, or pay any attention to public affairs,  
confident they were in good hands, and content to be  
a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am  
not distant But this momentous question, like a fire­  
bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror.  
I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It  
is hushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a re­  
prieve only, not a final sentence. A geographical  
line, coinciding wilh a marked principle, moral and  
political, once conceived and held up to the angry  
passions of men, will never be obliterated ; and every  
new irritation will nark it deeper and deeper. I can  
say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on  
earth who would sacrifice more than I would to re­  
lieve us from this heavy reproach, in any practicable  
way. The cession of that kind of property (for so  
it is misnamed) is a bagatelle which would not cost  
mc a s cond. thought, if in that way a general eman­  
cipation and expatriation could be effected and, gra­  
inally. and wnh due sacrifice. I think it might be.  
But as ii is, we have the wolf by the ears and we  
can neither hold him nor safely let him go. Justice  
  
is in one scab-, and self-preservation in the other.  
Of one thing 1 am certain, that as the passage of  
slaves from one Mate to another would not make a  
ave of a single human being who would not be so  
without it, so their diffusion over a greater surface  
  
would make them individually happier, and propor-  
  
uinaby facilitate the accomplishment of their eman-  
  
paiion. by dividing tie burden on a greater number  
  
of coadjutors. An abstinence, too, from this act of  
  
power would remove the jealousy excited by the un  
  
dertaking of Congress to leulate the condition of the  
  
different descripii uns of men composing a State. This  
certainly is the exclusive right of every State, which  
  
nothing in the constitution has taken from them and  
given to the general government. Co il I Congiess,  
  
or example, ny, that the non freemen of Connect!  
  
cut shall be freemen, or that they shall not emigrate  
  
nto any other State ?  
  
I regret that I am now to die in the belief th?.t the  
  
useless saennce ot themselves by the generation ot  
  
ui 6, to acquire sell-government and happiness to  
  
their country, is to be thrown away by the unwise  
  
md unworthy passions of their sons, and that my  
  
only consolation is to be that I live not to weep over  
it. If they would but dispassionately weigh the bles­  
sings they will throw away, against an abstract prin­  
ciple more likely to be effected bv union than by scis-  
  
lon, they would pause before they would perpetrate  
  
this act of suicide on themselves, and of treason  
  
against the hopes of the world. To yourself, as the  
faithful advocate ot the Union, I tender the offering  
  
ot my high esteem and respect. TH. JEFFERSON.

terror. 1 considered it nt oncea* the knell of the Union. It  
i? bushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve  
only, not a final sentence &quot;  
Flow true tt prophet he was, Mr. President! IIow soon  
a&#x27;ter he departed this lile was this agnation commenctd, and  
it hatrtieeu continued from thai day until this :  
&quot; A geogruphicul line coinciding with a marked principle,  
moral und political, once conceived and held up to the angry  
pas&lt;-ioua of man, will never be obliterated.&quot;  
What he thought never would be done is now about to be  
done. He proceeds:  
&quot; And every new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper.  
1 enn say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on  
earth wh? would sacrifice more than 1 would to relieve us  
from thia heavy leproach in any practicable way. The ces­  
sion of that *kind of property (torso it is misnamed) is a  
bugutelle which would nut cost me u second thought, if, in  
lliat way, u gunerul emancipation and expatriation could be  
effected; and. gradually, and with duo sacrifices. I think it  
might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and  
we cap neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is  
in one scale, and self-preservation in the other. Of one  
thing 1 am certain, that as the passage of slaves from one  
State to another would not make a slavo of a single human  
beirg who would not be so without it, so their diHusiun over  
a greater cm face would make them individually happier,  
and proportionally facilitate the accomplishment ot their  
emancipation, by dividing ihe burden on a greater number of  
C jadjutors.&quot;  
Now, what succreds :  
&quot;An abstinence, too, from this act of power, would re­  
move the jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress  
to regulate the condition of the different descriptions of  
men composing a State This, certainly, is the exclusive  
right of every State, which nothing in the constitution has  
taken from them, and given to the general government.

I,bagatelle which 1:Would:not cost me a second   
thought, if in the way, a general enaancipa

gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think It   
might be. But&#x27;ast it is, we have the wolf by.   
the ears, one can   
is   
hold_ him nor let   
him go. J twice is in-one scale smdself-pre--,   
ervation in the other. Of one thing I am   
certain, that as the passsagd&#x27; of Slaves from..   
.one State to another would not make a   
slave of a single human- being who would   
not be so wittibut , it, so their diffusion   
over a great k surface would make them   
individually and proportionably facilitate tilt,   
accomplishment of their -emancipation by   
dividing the butden on a greater numbe;• of   
coadjutors: An abstinence too, from this act   
of power, would ,remove the jealousy excited   
by the undertaking .of• Congress to regulate   
the condition of the different dis.criptions_ of   
men composing a State. This ertainly.-k.

Ithe exclusive &#x27;right of&#x27;. every - tate, which.   
nothing-in thelConstitution h taken -_from,

Could Congtuss for example, say that &#x27;the   
non-free men of Connecticut shall be free-men   
or that they shall not emigrate into any oth--  
er State I 1 &#x27; •   
I regret that I- am now to die in the be­  
lief that the useless sacrifice of themselvei, by.-  
the generation   
,of 1776, to. acquireself-govern-   
meat and happiness to their country, is to be   
thrown away by . the unwise and unworthy­  
passions of their sons„ and that my only con­  
solation is to lie that .I live not to weep   
.over   
it. If they would but dispassionately weigh,   
blessings they wilt throw away, against&quot; an.,   
abstract principle more likely to be affixto   
by union than by session, they would pause   
before bey epuld perpetrate this act of sui­

and content to be a passenger in our bark to  
the shore from which I am not far distant.  
But this momentous question, like a fire  
bell in the night, awakened and filled me  
with terror. I considered it at once the  
knell of the Union. It is hushed, indeed,  
for the moment. But this is a reprieve on  
ly, not a final sentence. A geographical  
line, coinciding with a marked principle,  
moral and political, once conceived and held  
up to the angry passions of men, will never  
be obliterated; and every new irritation  
will mark it deeper and deeper. I can say,  
with conscious truth, that there is no man  
on earth who would sacrifice more than I  
would to relieve us from this heavy re  
proach, in any practicable way. The ces  
sion of that kind of property (for it is so  
misnamed) is a bagatelle which would not  
cause me a second thought, if, in that way,  
a general emancipation and expatriation  
would be effected; and gradually, and with  
due sacrifices, I think it might be. But as  
it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and can  
neither hold him, nor safely let him go.  
Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation  
in the other. Of one thing I am certain,  
that as the passage of slaves from one State  
to another, would not make a slave of a hu­  
man being who would not be so without it,  
so their diffusion over a greater surface­  
would make them individually happier, and  
proportionally facilitate the accomplishment  
of their emancipation, by dividing the bur-  
then on a greater number of coadjutors.  
An abstinence, too, from this act of power,  
would remove the jealousy excited by the  
undertaking of Congress to regulate the  
condition of the different descriptions of  
men composing a State. This certainly is  
the exclusive right of every State, which  
nothing in the Constitution has taken from  
them, and given to the General Govern  
ment. Could Congress, for example, say  
that the non-freemen of Connecticut shall be  
freemen, or that they shall not emigrate into  
any other State?  
&quot;I regret that I am to die in the belief  
that the useless sacrifice of themselves by  
the generation of 1776, to acquire self-go  
vernment and happiness to their country, is  
to be thrown away by the unwise and un  
worthy passions of their sons, and that my  
consolation is to be, that I live not to weep  
over it. If they would but dispassionately  
weigh the blessings they will throw away,  
against an abstract principle more likely to  
be effected by union than by secession, they  
would pause before they perpetrate this  
dreadful act of suicide on themselves, and  
of treason against the hopes of the world.

I thaiik vou, dear sir, for tho copy vou havo  
been so kind as to send mo of the letter to vour  
constituents on the Missouri question. It is  
a perfect justification to them. I had for a long  
time ceased to read newspapers or pay any at  
tention to public aflatrs, confident tbey were m  
good hands,content to bo a passenger in our bark  
tothe shore, from which 1 am not distant. But  
this momentous question, liko a fire bell in the  
night, awakened and filled me with terror. I  
considered it at once the knell of the Union.  
It is hushed indeed for the moment; but this  
is a reprieve only, not a final sentonco. A geo­  
graphical line, coinciding with marked principle  
moral and political, once conceived and held up  
to trio angry oassions ot men, will never be 00  
, 1 :.. -...n :n 1. :  
literated, and every now imitation will mark it  
deeper and deeper.  
1 can say with concious truth that there is  
not a man on earth who would sacrifice more  
than I would to relievo us from this heavy re  
proach in a practicable way. Tho cession of that  
kind of property for so it is misnamed is a  
bajratelle. which would not cost mo a second  
thought if in that way a goneral emancipation  
and expatriation could bo effected; and, gradu  
ally and with due sacrifices, 1 think it might ue.  
Hut as it is, we have tlie won ry tno ears, ami  
wo can neither hold him nor safely let hi in go.  
Justice is in one scale and self preservation in  
the other. Of ono thing I am certain: that as  
the passage of slaves from one State to another  
would not make a slave of a.single human being  
who would not be so without it, so their diffu­  
sion over a greater surface would make them in  
dividually happier and proportionally facilliato  
tho accomplishment of their emancipation hy di­  
viding the burden on a greater number of coad­  
jutors. An abstinence, too, from this act of pow­  
er would remove the jealousy excited by the un­  
dertaking of Congress to regulate the condition  
of the diU&#x27;efent descriptions of men composing a  
State.  
Tills cei&#x27;hiinlv is the cxclvscve right of every  
State, which nothing in the Constitution has  
taken from and given to the general government.  
Could Congress, for example, say that tho non-  
fi ceinen of Connecticut shall be freemen, that  
thev shell not emigrate to any other State.&#x27; I re  
gret that I am now to die in the belief that tho  
useless sacrifice of themselves by the generation  
of 1776 to nc mire self government and happi  
ness to men&#x27; country is inrown away oy uio

of the Abolitionists North, and their aiders,  
the Know Nothings, South, to the letter of  
Mr. Jefferson written to Mr. John Holmes,  
which reads as follows :  
ilosTKELLO, April 22, 182J.  
I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have  
beeeu so kind as to send nie of your letter to  
your constituents on the Missouri question. It  
is a perfect j&#x27;isiificatiorf to th-iu. I had for a  
long time ceased to read newspapers or pay any  
attention to puhlic affairs, confident they we re  
in good hands, and content to be a passenger in  
our Lark to the bhorc, from which 1 uni nut dis­  
tant. II ut this momentous quntion, like a Jire­  
bell in the uiyht, awaktnetl and Jilled me with trr  
ror. 1 considered it at once an the knrll of the  
Union.  
It is hwhed, indeed, for the moment; but I hi a is  
a repriece only, not a Jinul sentence. .1 yeoyraphi­  
cal tine, coinciding icith a marked principle, moral  
and political, once conceived and hill uo to the  
  
angry passions of men, trill utter be ohlitera&#x27;ed,  
and ecery ntie imitation will mark it deeper and  
deeper.  
  
I can sriy with cou-ciom truth that there is  
  
not a man on earth who would Kacnuec more  
  
than I would to relieve us from this heavy re  
  
proach in any practicable way. The cession of  
that kind of property for so it is misnamed  
  
is a bagatelle, which would not cost me a second  
thought if in that way a general emancipation  
and expatriation could bo effect d; and, gradu  
ally nnd with due Ricritice, I think it might  
be. But as it is, we have ti e wolf by the cars  
and we can neither hold him nor safely let him  
  
go. Justice in oi.e scale and self-preservation  
  
in toe other. Of one thing I am certain: that,  
as the papsago of slaves from one S&#x27;.ate to an­  
other would not make a slave of a single human  
  
being who would lot be so without it, no their  
  
diffusion ever a irrcatcr surface would make  
  
them individually happier and proportionally  
facilitate the accomplishment of their emanci  
  
pation by dividing the burthen on a greater  
number of coadjutors. An abitineuce, too, from  
  
thi-i act of pow r would remove the jealousy ex­  
cited by the undertaking of Congn ss to regu  
  
late the condition of the ditferciit descriptions  
  
of men composing a State.  
  
This certainlij ij the exclusive rijht of evtru  
  
State, tcw&#x27;cA nothing in the Constitution has taktn  
  
from thtm and yictn to the General Government.  
  
Uould Congress, for example, say that the non­  
freetnrn of Connecticut shall be freemen, that  
they shall not emigrate into any other State?  
I regret that I am now to die in the belief that  
the useless sacrifice of themselves by the gen­  
eration of 1 77 ( to acquire s lf-i;o7i.rnmeiit and  
  
hnnpiiicAs to their co.intry, to bo thrown away  
  
by the unwise and unworthy pas.-ioos of their  
sous, and that my only consultation is to he  
that I live not to weep over it. If they would  
  
iul tlispnsHionately wciyh the blessings they  
  
will throw away against an abstract principle  
  
more likely to be effected by union than by  
  
fecession, ihey would pause before they would

Mr. JerFerson&#x27;sletter on the Mis-

their aiders, the Know Nothings, South,  
to the letter of Mr. Jefferson written to Mr.  
John Holmes, and which reads as follows:  
MonTicello, April 22, 1820.  
I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you  
a have been so kind as to send me of the let  
ter to your constituents on the Missouri  
question. It is a perfect justification to  
them. I had for a long time ceased to read  
 newspapers or pay any attention to public  
affairs, confident they were in good hands,  
and content to be a passenger in our bark  
to the shore, from which I am not distant.  
But this momentous question, like a fire-bell  
in the night, awakened and filled me with  
terror. I considered it at once as the knell  
of the Union  
It is hushed, indeed, for the moment; but  
this is a reprievs only not a anal sentence  
A geographical line, coinciding with a mark­  
ed principle, moral and political, once con-  
ceived and held up to the angry passions of  
men, will never be oblitrated and every new  
imitation will mark it desper and deeper.  
I can say with conscious truth that there  
is not a man on earth who would sacrifice  
more than I would to relieve us from this  
heavy reproach in any practicable way.  
The cession of that kind of property- for  
so it is misnamed--is a bagatelle, which  
would not cost me a second thought if in  
that way a general emancipation and expa­  
triation could be effected; and, gradually  
and with due sacrifices, I think it might be.  
But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears,  
and we can neither hold him nor safely let  
him go. Justice is in one scale and self­  
preservation in the other. Of one thing I  
am certain; that, as the passage of slaves  
from one State to another would not make  
a slave of a single human being who would  
not be so without it, so their diffusion over a  
greater surface would make them individual­  
ly happier and proportionally facilitate the  
accomplishment of their emancipation by  
dividing the burthen on a greater number  
of coadjutors. An abstinence, too, from this  
act of power would remove the jealousy ex­  
cited by the undertaking of Congress to reg­  
ulate the condition of the different descrip­  
tions of men composing a State.  
This certainly is the erclusive right of en­  
ery State, wkich nothing in the Constitu­  
tion has taken from them and given to the  
General Government. Could Congress,  
 for example, say that the non freemen of

the useless sacrifice of themselves by the

would not make a slave of a human being  
who would not be so without it, so tho dif

them indjviduatly happier, and proportion  
ally facilitate the accomplishment of their

greuter number of coadjutors&#x27;.  
An abstinence, too, from this act of pow­

the undertaking of Congress to regulate the  
condition of theaifferent descriptions of men  
composing a State. This certainly is an  
exclusive right of the State, which nothing

art of  
the model of their predecessors.  
TUOS. JEFFERSON.  
Mr. llulmcs, of Maine, member of Congress,  
addressed Jottersou a letter, which drew from  
him the following remarkable reply:  
Monticei.lo, April 22, 1820.  
I thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have  
been so kind as to send me of the letter to your  
constituents on the Missouri question. It is a  
perfect justification to them.  
1 had for a long time ceased to read newspa­  
pers, or pay any attention to public affairs,  
confident they were in good hands, nnd content  
to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from  
which I am not far distant. But this momentous  
question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and  
Jilted me with terror. I considered it at once the knelt  
of the Union. It is hushed, indeed for the mo­  
ment, but this is a reprieve only, not a final  
sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a  
marked principle, moral and political, once conceived  
and held up to the angry passions of men, will never  
be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark  
i it deeper and deeper. I can say, with conscious  
, truth, that there is no man on earth, who would  
■ sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from  
this heavy reproach, In any practicable way.—  
The cession of that kind of property (for it is so  
misnamed) is a bagatelle which would not  
&#x27; cause me a second thought, if, in that way, a  
general emancipation and expatriation would  
i be effected, aud gradually, nnd with due sacri­  
fices, I tbi&#x27;.klc it might be. But as it is, we have  
the wolf by the ears, aud can neither hold him  
nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale  
aud self-preservation in the other. Of one  
thing I am certain, that as the passage of the  
slaves from one State to another would not  
make a slave of a human being who would not  
! be so without it, so their diffusion over u greater  
surface would make them individually happier,  
and proportionally facilitate the accomplish­  
ment of their emancipation, by dividing the  
| burthen on a greater number of coadjutors.  
An abstinence, too, from this act of power,  
would remove the jealousy excited by the un­  
dertaking of Congress to regulate the condition  
of the different descriptions of men composing  
a State. This certainty is the exclusive right of the  
State, which nothing in the Constitution has taken  
from them, and given to the General Government.—  
Could Congress, for example, say, that the non freemen  
of Connecticut shall be freemen, or that they shall no t  
emigrate to any other State ?  
I regret that I am not to die in the belief that  
the useless sacrifice of themselves by the gen­  
eration of 1776, to acquire self-government and  
happiness to their couutry, is to be thrown away  
by tbe unwise and unworthy passions of their  
sons, and that my consolation is to be, that I  
live not to weep over it. If they would but  
dispassionately weigh the blessings they will  
throw away, against an abstract principle more  
likely to lie effected by union than secession,  
they would pause before they perpetrate this  
dreadful act of suicide on themselves, and of  
treason against the hopes of the world.  
To yourself, as the faithful advocate of the  
Union, I tender the offer of my high esteem and  
respect. TIIOS. JEFFERSON

## [From _United States. Congress. Congressional Globe; Containing the Debates and Proceedings of the Congress 1833-1873_](https://archive.org/details/sim_united-states-congress-congressional-globe_1859-12-28_16/page/n10/mode/1up?view=theater)

“*T thank you, dear sir, for the copy you have been so kind  
as to send me of the letter to your constituents on the Mis  
souri question. It isa perfect justification to them. I had  
  
| fora long time ceased to read newspapers, or pay any at  
  
tention to public affairs, confident they were in good hands,  
and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from  
which [ am not distant. But this momentous question,  
  
| like a fire-bell in the night, awakened and filled me with  
| terror. I considered it at once as the Knell of the Union.  
  
It is hushed, indeed, forthe moment. But this isa reprieve  
only, not a final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding  
with a marked principle, moral and political, once con  
ceived and held upto the angry passions of men, will never  
be obliterated ; and every new irritation will mark itdeeper  
and deeper. I can say, with conscious truth, that there ts  
not aman on earth who would sacrifice more than [ would  
  
| to relieve us from this heavy reproach, in any practicable  
  
way. The cession of that kind of property, for so it is mis  
named, is a bagatelie, which would not cost me a second  
thought, if, in that way,a general emancipation and expa  
triation could be effected ; and, gradually, and with due sac  
rifices, I think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf  
by the ears, and we can neither hold him, nor safely tet  
him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in  
the other. Of one thing Lam certain, that as the passage  
of slaves from one State to another, would not make a  
slave ofa single human being who would not be so with  
out it, so their diffusion overa greater surface would make  
| them individually happier, and proportionally facilitate  
the accomplishment of their emancipation by dividing the  
burden on a greater numberof coadjutors. An abstinence,  
too, from this act of power, would remove the jealousy ex  
| cited by the undertaking of Congress to regulate the condi  
tion of the different descriptions of men composing a State.  
| This certainly is the exclusive right of every State, which  
nothing in the Constitution has taken from them and given  
to the General Government. Could Congress, for example,  
| say that the non-freemen of Connecticut shall be freemen,  
| or that they shall not emigrate into any other State ?  
| *] regret that [ am now todie in the belief that the use  
less sacrifice of themselves by the generation of 1776, to  
| acquire self-government and happiness to their country, is  
| to be thrown away by the unwise and unworthy passions  
of their sons, and that my only consolation is to be, that I  
live not to weep over it. If they would but dispassionately  
weigh the blessings they will throw away, against an ab  
stract principle more likely to be effected by union than by  
| secession, they would pause before they would perpetrate  
this act of suicide on themselves, and of treason against the  
hopes of the world. ‘To yourself, as the faithful advocate  
of the Union, [ tender the offering of my high esteem and  
respect.”’

I thank you, dear sir&#x27;, for the Copy -you

But this inomentuous question, like a fire­

with. terror. I considered it at once as   
the knell of the Union. It is hushed, in­

truth, that there is.noiman-on&quot; earth who

it deeper and deeper. I can say with  
conscious truth, that there is not a man  
on earth who would sacrifice more than  
I would fo relieve us from this heavy re-  
proach in any practicable way ; the ces-  
sion of that kind of property, for so it is  
misnamed, is a bagatelle which would n~t  
cost me a second thought, if in that way  
a general emancipation and expatriation  
could be effected ; and gradually and with  
due sacrifices I think it might be. But  
as it is, we have the wolf by the ears;  
and we can neither hold him nor safely  
let him go. Justice is in one scale and  
self-preservation in the other. Of one  
thing I am certain, that as the passage of  
slaves from one State to another, would  
not make a slave of a single human be-  
ing who would not -be so without it, so  
their diffusion over a. greater surface would  
make them individually happier, and pro-  
portionally facilitate the accomplishment of  
their emancipation, by dividing the bur-  
then on a greater number of coadjutors.  
An abstinence, too, from this act of pow-  
er, would remove the jealousy excited by  
the undertaking of Congress to regulate  
the condition of the different descriptions  
of men composing a State. This certain-  
ly is the exclusive right of every State,  
which nothing in the constitution has  
taken from them and given to the Gene-  
ral Government. Could Congress, for ex-  
ample, say, that the non-freemen of Con-  
necticut shall be freemen, or that they  
shall not emigrate into any State.” I re-  
gret that 1am now to die in the belief  
that the useless sacrifice of themselves by  
the generation of 1776, to acquire self-  
government and happiness to their coun-  
try, is to be thrown away by the unwise  
and unworthy passions of their sons, and  
that my only consolation is to be, that I  
live not to weep over it. If they would  
but dispassionately weigh the blessings  
they will throw away, against an abstract  
principle more likely to be effected by Union  
than secession, they would pause before  
they would perpetrate this act of suicide  
on themselves and of treason against the  
hopes of the world.” Jefferson’s Works

Of one thing I am certain, that as the  
passage of slaves from one State to anoth  
er, would not make a slave of a si  
  
man being who would not he so, without  
it, so their diffusion over a greater aurface  
would make them individually

and pleportionally lacilitate the accon-

plishment of their emancipation, by divi­  
ding the burden on a greater number of  
coadjutors. An abstinence, too, from this  
act of power; would remove the jealousy  
ozcited by the uncertaking of Congress to  
regulate the conditions of men composing  
a State. This certainly is the exclusive  
right of every State which nothing in the  
Constitution has taken from them and giv­  
en to the general government. Could  
Congress, for example, say that the non­  
freemen of Connecticut shall be freomen,  
or that they shall not emigrate into any  
other State?  
I regret that I am now to dio in the be­  
lief that the useless saorifices of themselves  
by the generation of 1776, to acquire self  
government and happiness to their coun­  
try, is to be thrown away by the unwise  
and un worthy passions of their sons, and  
that my only consolation is to be that I  
live not to weep over it. If they would  
but dispassionately weigh the blessings  
they will throw away, agains, an abstract  
principle more likely to be effected by un­  
ion than secession, they would pause be­  
fore they would perpetrate this act of sui­  
cide on themselves, and of treason against

follows- &quot;I thank you, my dear sir, for the copy  
you have been so kind as to send me of the letter  
to your constituents on the Missouri question. It is  
a perfect justification to them. I had for a long  
time ceased to read newspapers or pay any atten­  
tion to public affairs, confident they were in good  
hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to  
the shore from which I am not distant. But this  
momentous question, like a fire-bell in the night,  
awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it  
at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed in­  
deed for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, net a  
final sentence. A geographical line, coinciding  
with a marked principle, moral and political  
once conceived and held up to the angry  
Te Gotans af Mar ttl Nowos  
of men, will never be oblitera-  
ted; and every new irritation will! mark  
it deeper and deeper. I can say with conscious  
truth, that there is not a man on earth who would  
sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this  
heavy reproach in any practicable way; the cession  
of that kind of property, for so it is misnamed, is a  
baqutelle which would not cost me a second thought,  
if in that way a general emancipation and expatrid­  
tion could be effected; and gradually and with due  
sacrifices I think it might be. But, as it is, we have  
the wolf by the ears; and we can neither hold him  
safely nor let him go. Justice is in the one scale  
and self-preservation in the other. Of one thing I  
am certain, that as the passage of alaves from one  
State to another, would not make a slave of a single  
human being who would not be so without it, so  
their diffusion over a greater surface would noakce them

he regarded as the knell of the Union, and  
made some suggestions in a letter to Mr.  
Holmes, a Congressman from Maine, which  
might have saved us this bitter contest if they  
had been duly appreciated:  
  
&quot;I bad for a long time ceased to read newspa-  
pers, or pay attention to any public affairs, confi-  
dent they wore in good hands, and content to be a  
passenger in our baik to the shore from which I  
am not far distant. But this momentous question,  
like a lire-bell iu the nigbt, awakened and filled  
me with horror; I considered it at once the knell  
of the Union. It is bushed indeed for the mo-  
men&#x27;, but this is a reprieve only, not a final sen-  
tence. A geographical. -line, coinciding with a  
marked principle, moral and political, once con-  
csived nnd held np to the angry passions of men,  
will never be obliterated; and every new irrita-  
tion will mark it deeper and deeper. I can Say,  
with conscious truib, that thore is no man em  
earth who would sacrifice more than I would to  
relieve us from this heavv roproacb, in any prac-  
tical way. Of one thing 1 am certain, that as the  
passage of the slaves from one State to another  
would not make a slave of a hnman being who  
would not be ao without it, so the diffusion over a  
greater surface wonld make tbem individually  
happier, and proportionally facilitate the accom-  
plishment of their emancipation, by dividing the  
burthen on a greater number uf coadjutors.  
  
An abstinence, too, from this act of p iwer  
wonld remove the jealousy excited by tho under-  
taking of Congress to regulate the condition of the  
different descriptions of men composing a State.  
This certainly is an exclusive right of the S ate,  
which nothing in the Constitution has taken from  
them, and given to the General Government.  
Could Congress, for example, &gt;,ay that the non  
freemen cf Connecticut shall bo freemeD, or that  
they shall not emigrate to any other State?  
  
I regret that I am to die in the belief that  
the useless sacrifice of themselves by Ihe genera-  
tion of 1776, to acquire self-government and hap-  
piness, is to be thrown away by the unwise and  
unworthy passions of their son?, and that my con-  
solation is to be that I live not to weep over it.  
If they would but dispassionately weirjh the bles-  
sings they v.iil throw away, against an abstract  
principle more likolj&#x27; to be offected by union than  
secession, they would pause before tbey perpe-

Jefferson termed ‘‘ treason against human hope.’’ Never was truer  
sentence written than one which has been often, but cannot be too  
often, quoted: “A geographical line, coinciding with a marked prin-  
ciple, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry  
passions of men will never be obliterated, and every new irritation  
will mark it deeper and deeper.”

If there was one man who more than any other was the author of  
freedom in this Western Hemisphere, that man was Thomas Jeffer-  
son. He was not seeking to augment or prolong slavery when he  
wrote to Mr. Holmes, of Massachusetts, who agreed with him: “ Of  
one thing I am certain, that as the passage of slaves from one State  
to another would not make a slave of a single human being who  
would not be so without it, so their diffusion over a greater surface  
would make them individually happier and proportionately facilitate  
the accomplishment of their emancipation by dividing the burthen
