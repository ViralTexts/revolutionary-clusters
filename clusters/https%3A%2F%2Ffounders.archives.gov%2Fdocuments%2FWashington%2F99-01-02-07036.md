, the American Troops composing the right Wing will be formed into two Lines, the Continental Forces in the front line, consisting of  
the following divisions and in the following order viz. Muhlenbergh and Hazens Brigades to form the Division on the right under the Command of the Marquis de la Fayette Waynes and the Maryland Brigade, the Division of the centre for the present to be commanded by Baron de  
Steuben—Daytons and Clintons Brigades, that on the Left—The senior Continentel Officer will Command the Right Wing and his Excellency Count Rochambeau the Left Wing of which he will be pleased to make his own disposition.  
The two Companies of Delaware are for the present to be Annexed to the 3d Maryland Regiment.  
Stephens and Lawsons Brigades of Militia will form the second Line—the Park of Artillery—the Corps of sappers and Miners and the Virginia state Regiment will be posted between the two Lines in the order above Mentioned commencing from the right.  
The whole Army will March by the right in one Column at 5 oClock tomorrow Morning precisely—The particular order of March for the right Wing will be distributed by the Quarter Master Generals.  
The General desires that the Officers will confine them selves in point of Baggage to objects of the first Necessity, that the Army may March as light and unencumbered as possible—The Quarter Master General will have directions to appoint a proper deposit  
for the effects that will be left—from whence they will be transported to the Army as soon as a parmenent position is taken.  
The Quarter Master General will allot a proportionate Number of the Waggons in his possession for the service of the Left Wing.  
If the Enemy should be tempted to Meet the Army on its March, the General particularly enjoins the troops to place their principle relyance on the Bayonet—that they may prove the Vanity of the Boast which the British make of their particular pains in  
deciding Battles with that Weapon—He trusts that a generous Emulation will actuate the Allied Armies, that the french whose National Weapon is that of close fight; and the troops in General that have so often used it with success will distinguish themselves on every Occasion

atter this date this orderly book, though con-  
tinued to Oct. 11, has its text repeated in other  
existing data appertaining to the military  
events of the Revolution. As attacks may be  
expected, with hand-to-hand combats, the com-  
manoder exhorts his soldiers, possibly the  
Militia, not to be in the least intimidated if  
the British use the bayonet:
