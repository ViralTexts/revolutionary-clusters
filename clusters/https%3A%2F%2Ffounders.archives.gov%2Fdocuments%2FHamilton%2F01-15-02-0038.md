[Philadelphia, June 29, 1793]  
  
As attempts are making very dangerous to the peace, and it is to be feared not very friendly to the constitution of the UStates—it becomes the duty of those who wish well to both to endeavour to prevent their success.  
The objections which have been raised against the Proclamation of Neutrality lately issued by the President have been urged in a spirit of acrimony and invective, which demonstrates, that more was in view than merely a free discussion of an important public measure; that the discussion covers a design of weakening the confidence of the People in the author of the measure; in order to remove or lessen a powerful obstacle to the success of an opposition to the Government, which however it may change its form, according to circumstances, seems still to be adhered to and pursued with persevering Industry.  
This Reflection adds to the motives connected with the measure itself to recommend endeavours by proper explanations to place it in a just light. Such explanations at least cannot but be satisfactory to those who may not have leisure or opportunity for pursuing themselves an investigation of the subject, and who may wish to perceive that the policy of the Government is not inconsistent with its obligations or its honor.  
The objections in question fall under three heads—  
1   That the Proclamation was without authority  
2   That it was contrary to our treaties with France  
3   That it was contrary to the gratitude, which is due from this to that country; for the succours rendered us in our own Revolution.  
4   That it was out of time &amp; unnecessary.  
In order to judge of the solidity of the first of these objection [s], it is necessary to examine what is the nature and design of a proclamation of neutrality.  
The true nature &amp; design of such an act is—to make known to the powers at War and to the Citizens of the Country, whose Government does the Act that such country is in the condition of a Nation at Peace with the belligerent parties, and under no obligations of Treaty, to become an associate in the war with either of them; that this being its situation its intention is to observe a conduct conformable with it and to perform towards each the duties of neutrality; and as a consequence of this state of things, to give warning to all within its jurisdiction to abstain from acts that shall contravene those duties, under the penalties which the laws of the land (of which the law of Nations is a part) annexes to acts of contravention.  
This, and no more, is conceived to be the true import of a Proclamation of Neutrality.  
It does not imply, that the Nation which makes the declaration will forbear to perform to any of the warring Powers any stipulations in Treaties which can be performed without rendering it an associate or party in the War. It therefore does not imply in our case, that the UStates will not make those distinctions, between the present belligerent powers, which are stipulated in the 17th and 22d articles of our Treaty with France; because these distinctions are not incompatible with a state of neutrality; they will in no shape render the UStates an associate or party in the War. This must be evident, when it is considered, that even to furnish determinate succours, of a certain number of Ships or troops, to a Power at War, in consequence of antecedent treaties having no particular reference to the existing war, is not inconsistent with neutrality; a position well established by the doctrines of Writers and the practice of Nations.  
  
See Vatel Book III Chap. VI § 101.  
  
  
  
But no special aids, succours or favors having relation to war, not positively and precisely stipulated by some Treaty of the above description, can be afforded to either party, without a breach of neutrality.  
In stating that the Proclamation of Neutrality does not imply the non performance of any stipulations of Treaties which are not of a nature to make the Nation an associate or party in the war, it is conceded that an execution of the clause of Guarantee contained in the 11th article of our Treaty of Alliance with France would be contrary to the sense and spirit of the Proclamation; because it would engage us with our whole force as an associate or auxiliary in the War; it would be much more than the case of a definite limited succour, previously ascertained.  
It follows that the Proclamation is virtually a manifestation of the sense of the Government that the UStates are, under the circumstances of the case, not bound to execute the clause of Guarantee.  
If this be a just view of the true force and import of the Proclamation, it will remain to see whether the President in issuing it acted within his proper sphere, or stepped beyond the bounds of his constitutional authority and duty.  
It will not be disputed that the management of the affairs of this country with foreign nations is confided to the Government of the UStates.  
It can as little be disputed, that a Proclamation of Neutrality, where a Nation is at liberty to keep out of a War in which other Nations are engaged and means so to do, is a usual and a proper measure. Its main object and effect are to prevent the Nation being immediately responsible for acts done by its citizens, without the privity or connivance of the Government, in contravention of the principles of neutrality.  
  
See Vatel Book III Chap VII § 113.  
  
  
  
An object this of the greatest importance to a Country whose true interest lies in the preservation of peace.  
The inquiry then is—what department of the Government of the UStates is the prop⟨er⟩ one to make a declaration of Neutrality in the cases in which the engagements ⟨of⟩ the Nation permit and its interests require such a declaration.  
A correct and well informed mind will discern at once that it can belong neit⟨her⟩ to the Legislative nor Judicial Department and of course must belong to the Executive.  
The Legislative Department is not the organ of intercourse between the UStates and foreign Nations. It is charged neither with making nor interpreting Treaties. It is therefore not naturally that Organ of the Government which is to pronounce the existing condition of the Nation, with regard to foreign Powers, or to admonish the Citizens of their obligations and duties as founded upon that condition of things. Still less is it charged with enforcing the execution and observance of these obligations and those duties.  
It is equally obvious that the act in question is foreign to the Judiciary Department of the Government. The province of that Department is to decide litigations in particular cases. It is indeed charged with the interpretation of treaties; but it exercises this function only in the litigated cases; that is where contending parties bring before it a specific controversy. It has no concern with pronouncing upon the external political relations of Treaties between Government and Government. This position is too plain to need being insisted upon.  
It must then of necessity belong to the Executive Department to exercise the function in Question—when a proper case for the exercise of it occurs.  
It appears to be connected with that department in various capacities, as the organ of intercourse between the Nation and foreign Nations—as the interpreter of the National Treaties in those cases in which the Judiciary is not competent, that is in the cases between Government and Government—as that Power, which is charged with the Execution of the Laws, of which Treaties form a part—as that Power which is charged with the command and application of the Public Force.  
This view of the subject is so natural and obvious—so analogous to general theory and practice—that no doubt can be entertained of its justness, unless such doubt can be deduced from particular provisions of the Constitution of the UStates.  
Let us see then if cause for such doubt is to be found in that constitution.  
The second Article of the Constitution of the UStates, section 1st, establishes this general Proposition, That “The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”  
The same article in a succeeding Section proceeds to designate particular cases of Executive Power. It declares among other things that the President shall be Commander in Cheif of the army and navy of the UStates and of the Militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the UStates, that he shall have power by and with the advice of the senate to make treaties; that it shall be his duty to receive ambassadors and other public Ministers and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  
It would not consist with the rules of sound construction to consider this enumeration of particular authorities as derogating from the more comprehensive grant contained in the general clause, further than as it may be coupled with express restrictions or qualifications; as in regard to the cooperation of the Senate in the appointment of Officers and the making of treaties; which are qualifica⟨tions⟩ of the general executive powers of appointing officers and making treaties: Because the difficulty of a complete and perfect specification of all the cases of Executive authority would naturally dictate the use of general terms—and would render it improbable that a specification of certain particulars was designd as a substitute for those terms, when antecedently used. The different mode of expression employed in the constitution in regard to the two powers the Legislative and the Executive serves to confirm this inference. In the article which grants the legislative powers of the Governt. the expressions are—“All Legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the UStates;” in that which grants the Executive Power the expressions are, as already quoted “The Executive Po⟨wer⟩ shall be vested in a President of the UStates of America.”  
The enumeration ought rather therefore to be considered as intended by way of greater caution, to specify and regulate the principal articles implied in the definition of Executive Power; leaving the rest to flow from the general grant of that power, interpreted in conformity to other parts ⟨of⟩ the constitution and to the principles of free government.  
The general doctrine then of our constitution is, that the Executive Power of the Nation is vested in the President; subject only to the exceptions and qu[a]lifications which are expressed in the instrument.  
Two of these have been already noticed—the participation of the Senate in the appointment of Officers and the making of Treaties. A third remains to be mentioned the right of the Legislature “to declare war and grant letters of marque and reprisal.”  
  
With these exceptions the Executive Power of the Union is completely lodged in the President. This mode of construing the Constitution has indeed been recognized by Congress in formal acts, upon full consideration and debate. The power of removal from office is an inportant instance.  
And since upon general principles for reasons already given, the issuing of a proclamation of neutrality is merely an Executive Act; since also the general Executive Power of the Union is vested in the President, the conclusion is, that the step, which has been taken by him, is liable to no just exception on the score of authority.  
It may be observed that this Inference w⟨ould⟩ be just if the power of declaring war had ⟨not⟩ been vested in the Legislature, but that ⟨this⟩ power naturally includes the right of judg⟨ing⟩ whether the Nation is under obligations to m⟨ake⟩ war or not.  
The answer to this is, that however true it may be, that th⟨e⟩ right of the Legislature to declare wa⟨r⟩ includes the right of judging whether the N⟨ation⟩ be under obligations to make War or not—it will not follow that the Executive is in any case excluded from a similar right of Judgment, in the execution of its own functions.  
If the Legislature have a right to make war on the one hand—it is on the other the duty of the Executive to preserve Peace till war is declared; and in fulfilling that duty, it must necessarily possess a right of judging what is the nature of the obligations which the treaties of the Country impose on the Government; and when in pursuance of this right it has concluded that there is nothing in them inconsistent with a state of neutrality, it becomes both its province and its duty to enforce the laws incident to that state of the Nation. The Executive is charged with the execution of all laws, the laws of Nations as well as the Municipal law, which recognises and adopts those laws. It is consequently bound, by faithfully executing the laws of neutrality, when that is the state of the Nation, to avoid giving a cause of war to foreign Powers.  
This is the direct and proper end of the proclamation of neutrality. It declares to the UStates their situation with regard to the Powers at war and makes known to the Community that the laws incident to that situation will be enforced. In doing this, it conforms to an established usage of Nations, the operation of which as before remarked is to obviate a responsibility on the part of the whole Society, for secret and unknown violations of the rights of any of the warring parties by its citizens.  
Those who object to the proclamation will readily admit that it is the right and duty of the Executive to judge of, or to interpret, those articles of our treaties which give to France particular privileges, in order to the enforcement of those privileges: But the necessary consequence of this is, that the Executive must judge what are the proper bounds of those privileges—what rights are given to other nations by our treaties with them—what rights the law of Nature and Nations gives and our treaties permit, in respect to those Nations with whom we have no treaties; in fine what are the reciprocal rights and obligations of the United States &amp; of all &amp; each of the powers at War.  
The right of the Executive to receive ambassadors and other public Ministers may serve to illustrate the relative duties of the Executive and Legislative Departments. This right includes that of judging, in the case of a Revolution of Government in a foreign Country, whether the new rulers are competent organs of the National Will and ought to ⟨be⟩ recognised or not: And where a treaty antecedently exists between the UStates and such nation that right involves the power of giving operation or not to such treaty. For until the new Government is acknowleged, the treaties between the nations, as far at least as regards public rights, are of course suspended.  
This power of determ[in]ing virtually in the case supposed upon the operation of national Treaties as a consequence, of the power to receive ambassadors and other public Ministers, is an important instance of the right of the Executive to decide the obligations of the Nation with regard to foreign Nations. To apply it to the case of France, if the⟨re⟩ had been a Treaty of alliance offensive ⟨and⟩ defensive between the UStates and that Coun⟨try,⟩ the unqualified acknowlegement of the new Government would have put the UStates in a condition to become an associate in the War in which France was engaged—and would have laid the Legislature under an obligation, if required, and there was otherwise no valid excuse, of exercising its power of declaring war.  
This serves as an example of the right of the Executive, in certain cases, to determine the condition of the Nation, though it may consequentially affect the proper or improper exercise of the Power of the Legislature to declare war. The Executive indeed cannot control the exercise of that power—further than by the exer[c]ise of its general right of objecting to all acts of the Legislature; liable to being overruled by two thirds of both houses of Congress. The Legislature is free to perform its own duties according to its own sense of them—though the Executive in the exercise of its constitutional powers, may establish an antecedent state of things which ought to weigh in the legislative decisions. From the division of the Executive Power there results, in referrence to it, a concurrent authority, in the distributed cases.  
Hence in the case stated, though treaties can only be made by the President and Senate, their activity may be continued or suspended by the President alone.  
No objection has been made to the Presidents having acknowleged the Republic of France, by the Reception of its Minister, without having consulted the Senate; though that body is connected with him in the making of Treaties, and though the consequence of his act of reception is to give operation to the Treaties heretofore made with that Country: But he is censured for having declared the UStates to be in a state of peace &amp; neutrality, with regard to the Powers at War; because the right of changing that state &amp; declaring war belongs to the Legislature.  
It deserves to be remarked, that as the participation of the senate in the making of Treaties and the power of the Legislature to declare war are exceptions out of the general “Executive Power” vested in the President, they are to be construed strictly—and ought to be extended no further than is essential to their execution.  
While therefore the Legislature can alone declare war, can alone actually transfer the nation from a state of Peace to a state of War—it belongs to the “Executive Power,” to do whatever else the laws of Nations cooperating with the Treaties of the Country enjoin, in the intercourse of the UStates with foreign Powers.  
In this distribution of powers the wisdom of our constitution is manifested. It is the province and duty of the Executive to preserve to the Nation the blessings of peace. The Legislature alone can interrupt those blessings, by placing the Nation in a state of War.  
But though it has been thought adviseable to vindicate the authority of the Executive on this broad and comprehensive ground—it was not absolutely necessary to do so. That clause of the constitution which makes it his duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed” might alone have been relied upon, and this simple process of argument pursued.  
The President is the constitutional Executor of the laws. Our Treaties and the laws of Nations form a part of the law of the land. He who is to execute the laws must first judge for himself of their meaning. In order to the observance of that conduct, which the laws of nations combined with our treaties prescribed to this country, in reference to the present War in Europe, it was necessary for the President to judge for himself whether there was any thing in our treaties incompatible with an adherence to neutrality. Having judged that there was not, he had a right, and if in his opinion the interests of the Nation required it, it was his duty, as Executor of the laws, to proclaim the neutrality of the Nation, to exhort all persons to observe it, and to warn them of the penalties which would attend its non observance.  
The Proclamation has been represented as enacting some new law. This is a view of it entirely erroneous. It only proclaims a fact with regard to the existing state of the Nation, informs the citizens of what the laws previously established require of them in that state, &amp; warns them that these laws will be put in execution against the Infractors of them.

FOR THE GAZETTE.  
  
Mr. Fenno,  
AS attempts are making very dangerous  
to the peace, and it is to be feared not  
very friendly to the conftitutton of the Uni­  
ted States—it becomes the duty of those who  
wifn well to both to endeavor to prevent  
their success.  
  
The obje&amp;&#x27;.Qns, which have been raised  
against the proclamation of neutrality late y  
issued by the Preiident, ha*e been urged in a  
spirit of acrimony and inve&amp;ive, which de­  
monstrates that more was in view than mere­  
ly a free difcuflion of an importantvjpublic  
measure ; that the difculfion covers a design  
of weakening the confidence of the people in  
the author of the ineaiure, in order to remove  
or let Ten a powerful obstacle to the fu£Cefs of  
an opposition to the government, ,vbich how­  
ever it may change its form, according to  
circumstances, seems still to be adhered to  
and pursued with persevering indnftry.  
  
This reflexion adds to the motives con­  
netted with the&#x27;roeafure itfelf to recommend  
endeavors, by proper explanations, to place  
it in a just light. Such explanations at lealt  
cannot hut be fatisfa&amp;ory to those who may  
not have leisure or opportunity tor pnrfuing  
themselves an invelliggtton of the fubjeft,  
and who may wifli to perceive, that the poli­  
cy of the government is not inconsistent with  
its obligations or its honor.  
The objections in question fall under four  
heads :  
  
i. That the proclamation was without  
authority.  
  
2. That it was contrary to our treaties  
with France.  
  
3 That it was contrary to the gratitude,  
which is due from this to that country, l°r  
the succours rendered us in our own revolu­  
tion.  
4- That it was out of time and unnecc.-  
fary.  
In order to judge of the solidity of the fii ft  
of these objections, it is neceffhry to examine,  
what is the nature and design of a proclcma­  
tion of neutrality.  
The true nature and design of such an act  
is—to make known to the powers at war and  
to the citizens of the country, whole govern­  
ment does the ast, that such country is in the  
condition of a nation at peace with the belli­  
gerent parties, and under no obligations of  
treaty, to become an ajfociate in the war with  
either of them that this being its situation,  
its intention is to observe a conduct conform­  
able with it, and to perform towards each the  
duties of neutrality ; and. as a consequence

afih&#x27;ij fig; of tilings to give tracing to all  
within its jurifdittion to aWfam from acts&#x27;  
that (hall contravene those duties, under the  
penalties which the laws of the land (of which  
the law of nations is a part) annexes to arts  
of contravention.  
This, and no more is conceived to be the  
true import of a proclamation of neutrality.  
It does not imply, that the nation which  
makes the declaratiou will forbear to pel form  
to any of the warring pbwers, gny stipulations  
in treaties which can be performed, without  
rendering it an ajjociate or party in the war.  
It therefore does not imply i&lt;i our cafe, that  
the United States will not, make those dif­  
tinaions, between the present belligerent  
powers, which are stipulated in the seventh  
and tweuty-lecond articjes of our treaty with  
Frapce; because thele diftinftions are not  
incompatible with a Itate of neutrality : they  
will ill no ftiape render the United States . tin&#x27;  
ajjociate or party in the war. This must be  
evident, when if is considered, that even to  
furnilh determinate succours of a certain num­  
ber of (hips or troops, to a power at war, in  
consequence of antecedent treaties having no par.  
ttcular reference to the extjlivg war, is not incon­  
sistent with neutrality; a polition well e(ia­  
bliihed by the doctrines of writers, and the  
practice of nations.*  
But no special aids, succours, or favors  
having relation to war, not politively and  
precisely stipulated by some treaty of the  
above description, can be afforded to either  
partv, without a breach of neutrality.  
In stating that the proclamation of neutra-  
Jitydoesnot imply the non-perfoimance of  
any ftip&#x27;-alations of treaties, which are not of  
a nature to make the nation an associate or  
party in the war, it is conceded, that an ex­  
ecution of the Clause of guarantee contained  
in the eleventh article of our treaty of alli­  
ance.with France would be contrary to the  
sense and spirit of the proclamation ; because  
it would engage us with our whole force as an  
xjjveiatr, or auxiliary in the war t it wou&#x27;d be  
much more tnan the cafe of a definite limited  
fuccoui, previously ascertained.  
  
It follows, that the proclamation is virtu­  
ally a manifeftation of the sense of the go­  
vernment, that the United States are, under  
the cinumjlances oj the cafe, not bound to execute  
the claule of guarantee.  
  
If this be a just view of the force and im­  
port of the proclamation, it will remain to  
fee, whether the President in issuing it acted  
within his proper fpbeie, or stepped beyond  
the bounds of his constitutional authority and  
dutv.  
  
It will not be disputed that the manage­  
ment of tho-affhirs of this country with fo­  
reign nations, is confided to the government  
of the United States.  
  
It can as little be disputed, that a procla­  
mation of neutrality, when a nation is at li­  
berty to keep out of a war in which other na­  
tions are engaged, and means so to do, is a  
vjual and a. proper measure. Its main objefl and  
ejfecl are to prevent the nation being immediately  
ufponjihle Jor acts done b\ hs citizens, without the  
• fnvity ot lonntvanee of the government in contraven­  
tion ef the principles oj neutrality.+  
An obje&amp; this of tlie greatest importance to  
a country, whose true interest lies in the pre­  
servation of peace.  
  
The inquiry then is, What department of  
the government of the United States is the  
proper one to make a declaration of neutra­  
lity in the cases in which the engagements of  
the nation permit, and its interests require  
J&#x27;uch a declaration.  
  
A correct and well informed mind will dis­  
cern at once, that it can belong neither to the  
Jegiflative, nor judicial department, and of&quot;  
conrfe mult belong to the executive.  
  
The legislative department is not the organ  
ofintercourfe between the United States and  
foreign nations. It is charged neither with  
making, nor interpreting treaties. It is there­  
fore not naturally thaj organ of the govern­  
ment, which is to pronounce the existing con­  
dition of the nation, with regard to foreign  
powers, or to admonifli the citizens of their  
obligations and duties as founded upon ,that  
condition of things ; flill less is it charged  
with enforcing the execution and obfe-rvance  
of those obligations and those duties.  
  
It is equally obvious, that the a&amp; in ques­  
tion is foreign to the judiciary department of  
the government. The piovince of that de­  
partment is to decide litigations in particular  
cases. It is indeed charged with the inter­  
pretation of treaties, but it exercises this  
fun&amp;ion only in the litigared cases, that is  
where contending parties bring before it a  
fpecific controversy. It has no concern with  
pronouncing upon the external political rela­  
tions of treaties between government and go­  
vernment. This position is too plain to need  
being insisted upon.  
It niuft then of necessity belong to the exe­  
cutive department to exercise the function in  
question, when a proper cafe for the exercise  
of it occurs.  
  
It appears to be conne&amp;ed with that depart­  
ment in various capacities—As the organ of  
intercourse between the nation and foreign  
nations—a* the interpreter of the national trea­  
t:es in thrffe cales in which the judiciary is not  
competent, that is, in the cases between go­  
vernment and government— as that power  
which i% charged with the execution of the  
laws, of which treaties form a part—as  
that wiiich is charged with the com­  
mand and application of the public force.  
  
This viev&gt;.of the fubjeft is so natural and  
obvious, so analogous to general theory and  
practice, that no doubt can be entertained ot  
its justness, tmlefs such doubt can be deduced  
from particular provisions of the constitution  
of the United States.  
  
* $He Vat el, Beak 111. Ch. 6. Sec. toi.  
4 Seel&#x27;at el Book 111. Chap. 7. Sec. 113.  
  
L?t u~&gt; f?? then if cauftf for such doubt is  
to be found in tj)ftt constitution.  
&quot;The article of the co&#x27;nftitution of  
the United States, ffe&amp;ion firft, establishes this  
general proposition, that 44 the executive  
power fliall be belted in a President of the  
United States of America.&quot;  
  
The fame article in a succeeding fe&amp;ton  
proceeds to delineate particular cases of exe­  
cutive power. It declares among other  
things, that the President fha.ll be commander  
in chief of the army and navy of the United  
Srates, and of the militia of the several Rates,  
when called into the actual service ot the Uni­  
ted States ; that lie fliall have power, by and  
with the advice and consent of the Senate, to  
make treaties; that »t shall be his duty to re­  
ceive ambalfadors and other public ministers,  
and to take care that the taws be faithfully executed.  
It would not conlill with the rules of found  
confhu&amp;ion to confjdcr thia enumeration of par­  
ticular authorities as de&gt;ogatmg fiom ihc more  
comprehensive grant contained in the general  
clause, further than as it may be coupled with  
express rcftri&amp;ions or qualifications; as in re­  
gard to the co-operation of the Senate in the ap­  
pointment of officers and ihe making of treaties ;  
which are qualifications ofthegeueial executive  
powers of appointing officers and making trea­  
ties: because the difficulty of a complete and  
perfect fpecifir.ation«ot all the cases of executive  
authority, would naturally di£late &#x27;.he use of  
general terjns, and would render it improbable  
that a fpecifi cation of certain particulars was de­  
fined as a substitute for ihofe terms, when an­  
tecedently used. Yhe different mode of expfef­  
fion employed in the conftuution in regard to  
the two powers, the legislative and the execu­  
tive. serves to confiim this inference. In the  
article which grants the legislative powers of the  
government, the exprrlhons are, 44 All legislative  
powers herein granted, fliall be vejled in a Longrefs  
of the United States.&quot; In that which grants the  
executive power, the expreflions are, as alieady  
quoted, 44 The executive power shall be­  
velled in a Prefidenc of the United Stales of  
America.&quot;  
The enumeration ought rather thfwffore Id ba  
considered as intended by way of greater cau­  
tion, to foecify and regulate the principal arti­  
cles implied in the definition of executive pow­  
er : leaving the reft to flow from the general  
grant of that power, interpreted in conformity  
to other parts of the constitution, and to the  
principles of free government.  
The general do&amp;rine ot our constitution then  
is, that the executive power of the Nation  
is vefled in the President; fubje&amp; only to the  
exceptions and qualifcations which are exprefled  
  
in the inftrumerit,  
  
Two of these have been already noticed—the  
participation of the Senate in the appointment  
of officers, and the making of treaties. A third  
remaim to be mentioned—the right of the legif-  
  
lauire &quot; to declare war &amp; grant letters of marque  
and reprilal.&quot;  
With these exceptions the t x ecutive pow­  
er of the Union is completely lodged in the  
Prefiderit. This mode of construing the consti­  
tution has indeed been recognized by Congress  
in formal a&amp;s,upon full consideration and de­  
bate. The power of removal from office is an  
important And since upon general  
principles, for reasons already given, the lifurng  
of a proclamation of neutrality is merely an ex­  
ecutive ast; since also the general executive  
power of the Union is veiled in the President,  
the conclusion is, that the step which has been  
taken by him, is liable to no jult exception on  
the score of authority.  
It may beobferved that this inference would  
be just, &#x27;if the power ol declaring war had not  
been vested in the legiflatiire, but that this power  
naturally includes the right of judging, whether  
the nation is under obligations to make war or  
  
The answer to this is, th®t however true it  
may be, that the right of the legislature to de­  
clare war, includes the right of judging whether  
the nation be under obligations to make war or  
not, it will not follow, that the executive is in  
any cafe excluded f/om a similar right of jodg­  
mcnt in the execution of its own fun£lions.  
  
If the legislature have a right to make war on  
the one hand, it ?s, on the other, the duty of the  
executive to preserve peace till war is declared ; |  
and in fulfilling that duty, it mud neccrtarily j  
poflefs a right of judging what is the nature of &#x27;  
the obligations which the treaties of the coun­  
try impose on the government; and when in  
pursuance of this right it has concluded, that  
there is nothing in them inconsistent with a state  
of neutrality, it become* both its province and  
its duty to enforce the laws incident to that state  
of the nation. The executive is charged with  
the execution of all laws, the laws of nations as  
well as the municipal law, which recognizes and  
adopts thole laws. It is consequently bound,  
%by faithfully executing the laws of neutrality,  
when that is the state of the nation, to avoid  
giving a eauie of war to foreign powers.  
This is the dire£l and proper end of the pro­  
clamation of neutrality— It declares to the Uni­  
ted States their situation with regard to the pow­  
er? at war, and makes known to the coihmunity,  
that the laws incident to that situation will be  
enforced. In doing this, it conforms to an  
established usage of nations, the operation of  
which, av before remarked, is to obviate a re­  
sponsibility on the part of the wholefociety,for  
secret and unknown violations of the rights of  
any of the warring parties by its citizens.  
Those who ©bje£t to the proclamation will  
readily adinir, that it is the right and duty of  
the executive to judge of, or to interpret, those  
articles of our trcati&lt; s which give to Fiance par­  
ticular privileges, in order to the enforcement  
of tbofc privileges : But the neceflary confe­  
quenreof this is, that the executive mud judge  
I what are the proper bounds of those privileges—  
what nghis are given to other nations by our  
treaties with them—what rights the law of na­  
ture and nations gives and our treaties permit, in  
relpeft to those nations with whom we have no  
tieaties ; in fine, wha- are the reciprocal rights  
and obligations of the United States, and of all  
and cach of the poweis at war.  
The right of the executive to receive ambaffa-  
Jors and other public miniftcrs, may serve to il-.  
uftrate &#x27;he relative duties of the executive and  
legifla-ive departments. This right includrt  
that oi judging, in the cafe of a revolution of  
  
451  
  
government in a foreign country, whether (he  
new ruK.-;s are competent ocgatfs of the national  
w 11, mid ought to b lecogiiized ov not: And  
v here a tie&lt;ay antecedently exilts between the  
United Siates and luch nation, that right uWolves  
the power ol giving operation, or not, to (uch  
treaty. For until the new government is acknow­  
ledged, the treaties between the nations, as tar at  
lealt as regards public rights, are of coutfeiuf­  
pended.  
  
This power of determining virtually in the  
cafe supposed upon the operation of national  
treaties, as a consequence of the power to re­  
ceive ambassadors and other public ministers, is  
an important instance of the light of the execu­  
tive to decide the obligations ot the nation wuh  
regard to foreign nations. To apply it to the  
cafe ot France, it there had been a treaty ot alli­  
ance offenjxvc and defenfive between the United  
Statr» and that country,the unqualified acknow­  
jedgjnen* of the new government would have  
put the United Stiles ttt a condition to become  
an in the war in which France was en­  
gaged— and would laid the legislature un­  
der an obligation if required, and there was  
othtrvife no valid excufe,of exercifiug its power  
of aeclaring war.  
This serves a« an example of the right of the  
executive, in certain cafes,to determine the con­  
dition of the nation, though it may consequen­  
tially affect the proper or improper exercise of  
the power of the legislature to declare vrar. The  
executive indetd cannot controul the exercise of  
that power further than by its exercise of its ge­  
neral right of objecting to all a6U of the legifla­  
tui* ; liable to being overruled by two-thirds of  
both houses of Congress. The legislature is free  
to perform «its own duties according to its own  
sense of them ; though the executive in the ex­  
ercise of its conftituiional powers, may eflablifh  
an antecedent state of things, which ought to  
weigh in the legislative decisions.  
  
From the division of the executive power,  
there resultst in reference to it, a concurrent au­  
thority in the diftributcd cafcs.  
  
Hence in the cafe ftattd, though treaties can  
only be made by the President and Senate, their  
a&amp;ijvity may be continued or suspended by the  
Present alone.  
Noobje&amp;ion has been made to the Preftdeni&#x27;s  
having acknowledged the Republic of France,  
by the reception of its minister, without having  
consulted the Senate ; though that body is con­  
nefled with hini in the making of treaties, and  
though the consequence of his ast of reception  
is to give operation to the treaties hereiofore  
made with that country. But he is censured  
for having declared the United States to be in  
a Date of peace and neutrality with legard to the  
powers at war ; hecaufe the right of changing  
that (late and declaring war belongs to the legil­  
lature.  
  
It defcrves to be remaiked, that as the partici­  
pation of the Senate in the making of   
and the power of the legislature to declare war,  
are exceptions out of the general &quot; executive  
power&quot; veiled in the P/efidcnt, they are to be  
construed ftriftly, and ought to be extended no  
further than is eflential to their execution.  
  
While therefore the legislature can alone de­  
clare war, can alone actually transfer the nation  
fiom a state of peace toa ftateof war—it belongs  
to the 11 executive power&quot; to do whatever else  
lUc ]*W3 of nations, co-operating with the trea­  
ties of the country, enjoin in the intercourse of  
the United States with foreign powers.  
  
In this distribution of powers, the wisdom of  
our constitution is manifeftea. Jt is the pro­  
vince and duty of the executive to preserve to  
the nation the blcflings of peace. The legifla­  
t»re alone can interrupt those blessings, by plac­  
ing the nation in a ftateof war.  
  
But though it&#x27;has been thought advifeable to  
vindicate the authority of the executive on this  
broad and comprehensive ground, it was not ab­  
fokitely necessary to do so. That clause of the  
conilitution which makes it his duty to &quot;take  
care that the laws be faithfully executed,&quot; might  
alone have been relied upon, and this simple  
process of argument pursued.  
  
The Pfffidcnt is the constitutional r. x ecu tor  
of the laws. Our treaties and the laws of na­  
tions forma part of the law of the land. He  
who is to execute the laws, must firft judge for  
himfelf of rheir meaning. In order to the ob­  
servance of that conduct which the laws of na­  
tions, combined with our treaties, prescribed to  
this in reference to the present war in  
kut&#x27;ope, ir w&lt;*» necefTtry for the Prelident to  
judge for himfelf, whether there was any thing  
in our treaties incompatible with an adherence  
to neutrality. Having judged that there was  
not, he had a right, and if in his opinion the  
interests of the nation required it, it was his duty  
as executor of the laws, to proclaim the neutra­  
lity of the nation, to exhort all persons to ob­  
serve it, and to warn them of the penalties  
which would attend its non-obferv««nce.  
The proclamation has been represented as en­  
a&amp;ingfome new law. This is a view of it en­  
tirely erroneous. It only proclaims a fait with  
regard to the exifiingjlaU of the nation, informs  
the citizens of wh««t the laws previously ellab­  
11fHed require of them in that state, and warns  
thein that thefc laws will be put in executiou  
against the infra&amp;ors of them.

the Constitution vested in Congress the power
