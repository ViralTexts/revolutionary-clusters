The Act Authorizing a Detachment of one hundred thousand men from the Militia, will expire on the 30th. of Mar: next. It’s early revival is recommended, in order that timely steps may be taken for arrangements, such as the act contemplated.  
Without interfering with the modifications rendered necessary by the defects, or the inefficacy of the laws restrictive of commerce and navigation, or with the policy of disallowing to foreign Armed Vessels, the use of our waters; it falls within my duty to recommend also, that in addition to the precautionary measure authorized by that Act, &amp; to the regular troops, for completing the legal establishment of which enlistments are renewed, every necessary provision may be made for a Volunteer force of twenty thousand men, to be enlisted for a short period, and held in a state of Organization and readiness, for actual service, at the shortest warning.  
I submit to the consideration of Congress, moreover, the expediency of such a classification &amp; organization of the Militia, as will best ensure prompt &amp; successive aids, from that source, adequate to emergenc[i]es, which may call for them.  
It will rest with them also, to determine how far, further provision may be expedient, for putting into Actual service, if necessary, any part of the Naval Armament not now employed.  
At a period presenting features in the conduct of foreign Powers towards the United States, which impose on them the necessity of precautionary measures involving expense, it is a happy consideration that such is the solid state of the public credit, that reliance may be justly placed, on any legal provision that may be made for resorting to it, in a convenient form, and to an adequate amount.

The act authorising a detachment of one

Without interfering with the modifications,

efficacy of the&#x27;laws restrictive of commerce

establishment of which enlistments are re­  
newed, every necessary provision may be  
made, for a volunteer force of twenty thou­  
sand men, to be enlisted for a short period,  
and held in a state of organization and readi­  
ness, for actu il service, at .he shortest warn-  
hi- . ..  
I submit to the consideration of Congress,  
moreover, the expediency of such a classifi­  
cation and organization of the militia, as will  
best insure prompt and successive aids, from  
that source, adequate to emergencies, which  
may call for them.

duct of foreign powers towards the U. States,  
which impose on them the necessity of pre­  
cautionary measures involving expense, it is  
a happy consideration that such is the solid
