Sir  
  
Washington Feb. 2. 1807.  
  
The pressure of business during a session of the legislature, has rendered me more tardy in addressing you  
than it was my wish to have been. that our fellow citizens of the West would need only to be informed of criminal  
machinations against the public safety, to crush them at once, I never entertained a doubt. I have seen with the greatest  
satisfaction that among those who have distinguished themselves by their fidelity to their country, on the occasion of the  
enterprize of Mr. Burr, yourself &amp; the legislature of Ohio, have been the most eminent. the promptitude &amp; energy  
displayed by your state has been as honorable to itself as salutary to it’s sister states; and in declaring that you have  
deserved well of your country, I do but express the grateful sentiment of every faithful citizen in it. the hand of the  
people has given the mortal blow to a conspiracy, which, in other countries would have called for an appeal to armies; and  
has proved that government to be the strongest of which every man feels himself a part. it is a happy illustration too of  
the importance of preserving to the state authorities all that vigour which the constitution foresaw would be necessary,  
not only for their own safety, but for that of the whole. in making these acknolegements of the merit of having set this  
illustrious example of exertion for the common safety, I pray that they may be considered as addressed to yourself &amp; the  
legislature particularly, &amp; generally to every citizen who has availed himself of the opportunity given of proving his  
devotion to his country. Accept my salutations &amp; assurances of great consideration &amp; esteem.
