ple of the State of New-York.  
ASSUMING it therefore as an established truth that the several States, in case of disunion, or such combinations of them as might happen to be formed out of the wreck of the general confederacy, would be subject to those vicissitudes of peace and war, of friendship and enmity with each other, which have fallen to the lot of all neighbouring nations not united under one government, let us enter into a concise detail of some of the consequences, that would attend such a situation.  
War between the States, in the first periods of their separate existence, would be accompanied with much greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries, where regular military establishments have long obtained. The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and œconomy, have notwithstanding been productive of the signal advantage, of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation, which used to mark the progress of war, prior to their introduction. The art of fortification has contributed to the same ends. The nations of Europe are incircled with chains of fortified places, which mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in reducing two or three frontier garrisons, to gain admittance into an enemy’s country. Similar impediments occur at every step, to exhaust the strength and delay the progress of an invader. Formerly an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighbouring country, almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received; but now a comparatively small force of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive with the aid of posts, is able to impede and finally to frustrate the enterprises of one much more considerable. The history of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned, but of towns taken and retaken, of battles that decide nothing, of retreats more beneficial than victories, of much effort and little acquisition.  
In this country the scene would be altogether reversed. The jealousy of military establishments, would postpone them as long as possible. The want of fortifications leaving the frontiers of one State open to another, would facilitate inroads. The populous States would with little difficulty overrun their less populous neighbours. Conquests would be as easy to be made, as difficult to be retained. War therefore would be desultory and predatory. PLUNDER and devastations ever march in the train of irregulars. The calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events, which would characterise our military exploits.  
This picture is not too highly wrought, though I confess, it would not long remain a just one. Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident to war—the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty, to resort for repose and security, to institutions, which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe they, at length, become willing to run the risk of being less free.  
The institutions alluded to are STANDING ARMIES, and the correspondent appendages of military establishments. Standing armies it is said are not provided against in the new constitution; and it is therefore inferred, that they may exist under it.  
  
This objection will be fully examined in its proper place, and it will be shown that the only rational precaution which could have been taken on this subject has been taken; and a much better one than is to be found in any constitution that has been heretofore framed in America, most of which contain no guard at all on this subject.  
  
Their existence however from the very terms of the proposition, is, at most, problematical &amp; uncertain. But standing armies, it may be replied, must inevitably result from a dissolution of the confederacy. Frequent war and constant apprehension, which require a state of as constant preparation, will infallibly produce them. The weaker States or confederacies, would first have recourse to them, to put themselves upon an equality with their more potent neighbours. They would endeavour to supply the inferiority of population and resources, by a more regular and effective system of defence, by disciplined troops and by fortifications. They would, at the same time, be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government; in doing which, their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction towards monarchy. It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expence of the legislative authority.  
The expedients which have been mentioned, would soon give the States or confederacies that made use of them, a superiority over their neighbours. Small States, or States of less natural strength, under vigorous governments, and with the assistance of disciplined armies, have often triumphed over larger States, or States of greater natural strength, which have been destitute of these advantages. Neither the pride, nor the safety of the more important States, or confederacies, would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious inferiority. They would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected, to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence. Thus we should in a little time see established in every part of this country, the same engines of despotism, which have been the scourge of the old world. This at least would be the natural course of things, and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just, in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard.  
These are not vague inferrences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a constitution, the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of the people, or their representatives and delegates, but they are solid conclusions drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs.

stion. The industrious habits of the people of the present day, absorbed in the pursuits of gain, and devoted to the improvements of agriculture and commerce are incompatible with the condition of a nation of soldiers, which was the true condition of the people of those republics. The means of revenue, which have been so greatly multiplied by the encrease of gold and silver, and of the arts of industry, and the science of finance, which is the offspring of modern times, concurring with the habits of nations, have produced an intire revolution in the system of war, and have rendered disciplined armies, distinct from the body of the citizens, the inseparable companion of frequent hostility

. The smallness of the army renders the natural strength of the community an overmatch for it; and the citizens, not habituated to look up to the military power for protection, or to submit to its oppressions, neither love nor fear the soldiery: They view them with a spirit of jealous acquiescence in a necessary evil, and stand ready to resist a power which they suppose may be exerted to the prejudice of their rights. The army under such circumstances, may usefully aid the magistrate to suppress a small faction, or an occasional mob, or insurrection; but it will be unable to enforce encroachments against the united efforts of the great body of the people.  
In a country, in the predicament last described, the contrary of all this happens. The perpetual menacings of danger oblige the government to be always prepared to repel it—its armies must be numerous enough for instant defence. The continual necessity for their services enhances the importance of the soldier, and proportionably degrades the condition of the citizen. The military state becomes elevated above the civil. The inhabitants of territories, often the theatre of war, are unavoidably subjected to frequent infringements on their rights, which serve to weaken their sense of those rights; and by degrees, the people are brought to consider the soldiery not only as their protectors, but as their superiors. The transition from this disposition to that of considering them as masters, is neither remote, nor difficult: But it is very difficult to prevail upon a people under such impressions, to make a bold, or effectual resistance, to usurpations, supported by the military power.

hat kingdom.  
If we are wise enough to preserve the Union, we may for ages enjoy an advantage similar to that of an insulated situation. Europe is at a great distance from us. Her colonies in our vicinity, will be likely to continue too much disproportioned in strength, to be able to give us any dangerous annoyance. Extensive military establishments cannot, in this position, be necessary to our security. But if we should be disunited, and the integral parts should either remain separated, or which is most probable, should be thrown together into two or three confederacies, we should be in a short course of time, in the predicament of the continental powers of Europe—our liberties would be a prey to the means of defending ourselves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.  
This is an idea not superficial nor futile, but solid and weighty. It deserves the most serious and mature consideration of every prudent and honest man of whatever party. If such men will make a firm and solemn pause, and meditate dispassionately on the importance of this interesting idea, if they will contemplate it, in all its attitudes, and trace it to all its consequences, they will not hesitate to part with trivial objections to a constitution, the rejection of which would in all probability put a final period to the Union. The airy phantoms that flit before the distempered imaginations of some of its adversaries, would quickly give place to the more substantial forms of dangers real, certain, and formidable

Assuming it as an established truth that, in  
case of disunion, the several States, or such  
combination of them as might happen to be  
formed out of the wreck of the general confed­  
eracy, would be subject to those vicissitudes of  
peace or war, of friendship and enmity with each  
other, which have fallen to the lot of all other  
nations not united under one government, let us  
enter into a concise detail of some of the con­  
sequences that would attend such a situation.  
War between the States, in the first periods of  
their separate existence, would be accompanied  
with much greater distresses than it commonly  
is in those countries where regular military es­  
tablishments have long obtained. The discip­  
lined armies always kept on foot on the conti­  
j nent of Europe, though they bear a mal’gnant  
aspect to liberty and economy, have, notwith­  
i standing, been productive of the singular ad­  
vantage of rendering sudden conquests imprac­  
tible, and of preventing that rapid desolution  
which used to mark the progress of war prior to  
heir introduction.  
The art of fortification has contributed to the  
same ends. The nations of Europe are encir­  
cled with chains of fortified places, which mutu­  
ally obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted  
in reducing two or three fortified garrisons, to  
gain admittance into an enemy&#x27;s country. Sim­  
ilar impediments occur at every step, to ex­  
haust the strength and delay the progress of an  
invader.  
Formerly, an invading army would penetrate  
into the heart of a neighboring country almost  
as soon as intelligence of its approach would be  
received; but now, a comparatively small force  
of disciplined troops, acting on the defensive,  
with the aid of posts, is able to impede, and fi­  
nally to frustrate, the purposes of one much  
more considerable. The history of Avar in that  
quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of  
nations subdued and Empires overturned, but  
of towns taken, and retaken, of battles that de­  
cide nothing, of retreats more beneficial than  
victorious, of much and little acquisition.  
In this country the scene would be altogether  
reversed. The jealousy of military establish­  
ments Avould postpone them as long as possible.  
The want of fortifications, leaveiug the frontier  
of one State open to another, would facilitate  
inroads. The populous States would with little  
difficuty overrun their less populous neighbors.  
Conquests would be as easy to be made as diffi­  
cult to bo retained. War, therefore, would be  
desultory. Plunder and devastation ever march  
in the train of irregulars. The calamit ea of  
individuals avouM ever make the principal fig­  
ure in events, and would characterize our ex­  
ploits.  
This picture is not too highly wrought;  
though, I confess, it would not long remain a  
just one. Safety from external danger is the  
most powerful director of national conduct.  
Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time  
give way to its dictates. The voilont destruc­  
tion of life and property incident to war. the  
continual effort and alarm attendant on a slate  
continual danger, a ill compel nations the most  
attached to liberty to resort for repose and se­  
curity to intitntions Avhlch have a tendency to  
destroy their civil and political right.-. To be  
more safe, they would, at length, become wil­  
ling to run the risk of being less free.  
The institutions chiefly aliunded to arc stand­  
ing armies, and the corresponding appendages  
of military establishments. Standing armies,  
it is said, are not provided against in the new  
constitution, and it is thence inferred that they  
would exist under it. This inference, from (he  
very form of the proposition, is at best proble­  
matical and uncertain. But standing armies,  
it may be replied, must inevitably result from a  
dissolution of the confederacy. Frequent war  
and constant apprehension, which require, a  
state of as constant preparation, will infallibly  
produce them.  
The weaker States or confederacies Avould  
first have recourse to them, to put themselves  
on an equality with their more potent neighbors.  
They would endeavor to supply the inferiority  
of population and resources by a more regular  
and cffecfiA-e system of defence, by disciplined  
troops, and by fortifications. They would, at  
the same time, be obliged to strengthen the ex­  
ecutive arm of government; in doing which  
their constitutions would require a progressive  
direction towards monarchy. It is the nature of  
war to increase the executive, at the expense of  
the legislative authority.  
The expedients which have been mentioned  
would soon give the State or confederacies that  
made use of them a superiority over their neigh­  
bors. Small States, or States of less natural  
strengb, under vigorous governments, and with  
the assistance of disciplined armies, have often  
triumphed over large States or States of great­  
er natural strength, which have been destitute  
of these advantages.  
Neither the pride nor the safety of the impor­  
tant States or confederacies would permit them  
long to submit to this mortifying and adventi­  
tious superiority. They would quickly resort  
to means similar to those by which it had been  
effected, to reinstate themselves in thier lost  
pre-eminence. Thus we should, in a Httle time,  
see established in every part of this country the  
same engines of despotism which have been the  
scourge of the Old World.  
This, at least, would be the natural course of  
things; and our reasonings will be likely to be  
just, in proportion as they are accommodated to  
this standard. These are not vage inferences,  
deduced from speculative defects in a constitu­  
tion, the whole power of wich is lodged io the  
band* of the people, or their representatives  
and delegates; they are solid conclusions, drawn  
from the natural and necessary progress of hu­  
man affaire.—Alnwntler llamilvn.

“ War between the states, in the first periods of their

greater distresses than it commonly is in those countries  
where regular military establishments bave long ob-

rapid desolation which used to mark the progress of war

mutually obstruct invasion. Campaigns are wasted in  
reducing two or three fortified garrisons to gain admit-

war in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of  
nations subdued and empires overturned. but of towns  
taken and retaken, of battles that decide nothing... . .  
In this country the scene would be altogether reversed.  
The jealousy of military establishments would postpone  
them as long as possible. The want of fortifications,  
leaving the frontier of one state open to another, would  
facilitate inroads. The populous states would with little  
difficulty over-run their less populous neighbours. Con-  
quests would be as easy to be made, as difficult to be  
retained. War, therefore, would be desultory and pre-  
datory. The calamities of individuals would ever make  
the principal figure in events, and would characterise our  
exploits.

eocee The weaker states or confederacies would first  
have recourse to them to put themselves on an equality  
with their more potent neighbours. They would at the  
same time be obliged to strengthen the executive arm of  
government; in doing which, their constitutions would  
acquire a progressive direction towards monarchy. The  
  
| expedients which have been mentioned would soon give  
  
the states, or confederacies that made use of them, a  
superiority over their neighbours. . . . . Thus we should  
in a little time see established in every part of this  
country the same engines of despotism which have been  
the scourge of the old world. This at least would be the  
natural course of things; and our reasonings will be  
likely to be just in proportion as they are accommodated  
to this standard. These are not vague inferences, de-  
duced from speculative defects in a constitution, the whole  
power of which is lodged in the hands of the people. . . .  
They are solid conclusions, drawn from the natural and  
necessary progress of human affairs. Jf we are wise  
enough to preserve the Union, we may for ages enjoy an  
advantage similar to that of an insulated situation.  
Europe is at a great distance from us. Extensive mili-  
tary establishments cannot, in this position, be neces-  
sary to our security. But if we should be disunited, and  
the” integral parts should either remain separated, or,  
  
or three confederacies, we should be in a short time in the  
Our  
liberties would be a prey to the means of defending our-  
selves against the ambition and jealousy of each other.  
This is an idea not superficial or futile, but solid and  
weighty. It deserves the most serious and mature con-  
  
  
  
  
  
286  
  
sideration of every prudent and honest man of whatever  
party. If such men will make a firm and solemn pause,  
and meditate dispassionately on its importance, if they  
will contemplate it in all its attitudes, and trace it to all  
its consequences, they will not hesitate to part with  
  
trivial objections to a constitution the rejection of which |  
  
would, in all probability, put a final period to the Union.  
The airy phantoms that now flit before the distempered  
imaginations of some of its adversaries, would then  
quickly give place to more substantial prospects of dan-  
gers real, certain, and extremely formidable.

and preparations are being made by the  
leaders of the party in power for the crear  
tion in fact, if not in name, of an immense  
Standing Army, if such may not be said to  
be already in existence.  
Some of the evils arising from the State  
of things the Administration partisans are  
preparing for the country, are thus describ  
ed by Alexander HAMIlton in the VIIIth  
Number of the Federalist:  
The contmued necessity for his services  
enhances the importance of the soldier, and  
proportionally degrades the condition of  
the citizen. The military state becomes  
elevated above the civil. The inhabitants  
of territories after the theater of war, are  
unavoidably subjected to frequent infringe­  
ments on their rights which serve to weak  
sen their sense of those rights; and by de  
grees, the people are brought to consider  
the soldiery not only as their protectors,  
but as their superiors. The transition from  
this disposition to that of considering them  
as masters is neither remote nor difficult;  
but it is very difficult to prevail upon a peo-  
ple under such impressions, to make a bold,  
or effectual resistance to usurpations sup  
ported by the military power.&quot;
