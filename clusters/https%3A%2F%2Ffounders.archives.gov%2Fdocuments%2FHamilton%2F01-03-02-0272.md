, and of directing their operations when raised and equipped with that of ascertaining and making requisitions for the necessary sums or quantities of money to be paid by the respective states into the common treasury; contrary to the most approved and well founded maxims of free government which require that the legislative executive and judicial authorities should be deposited in distinct and separate hands.  
Thirdly. In the want of a Fœderal Judicature having cognizance of all matters of general concern in the last resort, especially those in which foreign nations, and their subjects are interested; from which defect, by the interference of the local regulations of particular states militating directly or indirectly against the powers vested in the Union, the national treaties will be liable to be infringed, the national faith to be violated and the public tranquillity to be disturbed.  
Fourthly. In vesting the United States in Congress assembled with the power of general taxation, comprehended in that of “ascertaining the necessary sums of money to be raised for the common defence and of appropriating and applying the same for defraying the public expences”—and yet rendering that power, so essential to the existence of the union, nugatory, by witholding from them all controul over either the imposition or the collection of the taxes for raising the sums required; whence it happens that the inclinations not the abilities of the respective states are in fact the criterion of their contributions to the common expence; and the public burthen has fallen and will continue to fall with very unequal weight.  
5thly. In fixing a rule for determining the proportion of each state towards the common expence which if practicable at all, must in the execution be attended with great expence inequality uncertainty and difficulty.  
6thly. In authorising Congress “to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the United States” without the power of establishing funds to secure the repayment of the money borrowed or the redemption of the bills emitted; from which must result one of these evils, either a want of sufficient credit in th

, repetitions of the calamities of depreciating paper, a continuance of the injustice and mischiefs of an unfunded debt, and first or last the annihilation of public credit. Indeed, in authorising Congress at all to emit an unfunded paper as the sign of value, a resource which though useful in the infancy, of this country, indispensable in the commencement of the revolution, ought not to continue a formal part of the constit[u]tion, nor ever hereafter to be employed, being in its nature pregnant with abuses and liable to be made the engine of imposition and fraud, holding out temptations equally pernicious to the integrity of government and to the morals of the people.  
7thly. In not making proper or competent provision for interior or exterior defence: for interior defence, by leaving it to the individual states to appoint all regimental officers of the land forces, to raise the men in their own way, to cloath arm and equip them at the expence of the United States; from which circumstances have resulted and will hereafter result, great confusion in

 not, that we are aware, brought into question.  
  
At the time when the articles of confederation were formed,  
the United States were in great danger from the tribes of In-  
dians on the borders of our settlements, who were either in a  
state of actual hostility, or liable to be made so by the emissa-  
ries of Great Britain. Under these circumstances, the propriety  
of giving the regulation of all intercourse with these tribes, to  
the General Government, was obvious. Accordingly the arti-  
cles of confederation contained a provision, that the United  
States should have the sole and exclusive right and power of  
‘ regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians,  
not members of any of the States ; provided, that the legislative  
right of any State, within its own limits, be not infringed or  
violated. :  
  
It has been urged, from this law, that the right of the old  
Congress did not “extend to the Indians within the chartered  
ienits of any State. But the expression, ‘ not members of any  
State,’ we should think, was meant to describe, not Indians who  
resided without the chartered limits of any State, but those who  
had not been subjected to the laws or jurisdiction of any State

plied to the Confederation the approved maxims of free govern-  
ment, which had been made familiar in the formation of the  
State constitutions, and which point to the distinct separation of  
the legislative, executive, and judicial functions. ‘The Confed-  
eration vested all these powers in a single body, and thus vio-  
lated the principles on which the government of nearly every  
State in the Union was founded. It had no federal judicature, to  
take cognizance of matters of general concern, and especially of  
those in which foreign nations and their subjects were concerned ;  
and thus national treaties, the national faith, and the public tran-  
quillity were exposed to the conflict of local regulations against  
the powers vested in the Union. It gave to Congress the power  
of ascertaining and appropriating the sums necessary for the  
public expenses, but withheld all control over either the imposi-  
tion or colléction of the taxes by which they were to be raised,  
and thus made the inclinations, not the abilities, of ‘he respec-  
tive States, the criterion of their contributions to the « »mmon ex-

or emit bills, on the credit of the United States, without the pow-  
er of providing funds to secure the repayment of the money, or  
the redemption of the bills emitted.

ABOUT THE COINAGE OF SILVER.  
The articles of the old Confeder­

in Congress assembled the sole and  
exclusive right and power of regu­  
lating the alloy and value of coin  
struck by their own authority or by  
that of the respective States. Here  
the power was granted to regulate  
the alloy ami value of coin struck  
in the United States. The constitu­  
tion conferred on Congress the  
power to coin money, regulate the  
value thereof and of foreign coin.  
The power extends first to deter­  
mine how many grains of precious  
metal shall bo in any particular  
coin and to regulating the value of  
the coin. We have coinage both of  
gold and silver now.  
Congress has determined how many  
grains of silver and how many grains  
of gold shall be in a dollar piece of  
either metal respectively, and dollar  
pieces are being coined. There i

declared that “the United States in Congress assembled also
