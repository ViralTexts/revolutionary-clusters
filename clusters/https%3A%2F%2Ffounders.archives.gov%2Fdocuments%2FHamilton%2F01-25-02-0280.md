[New York, January 7, 1802]  
  
The next exceptionable feature in the Message, is the proposal to abolish all restriction on naturalization, arising from a previous residence. In this the President is not more at variance with the concurrent maxims of all commentators on popular governments, than he is with himself. The Notes on Virginia are in direct contradiction to the Message, and furnish us with strong reasons against the policy now recommended. The passage alluded to is here presented: Speaking of the population of America, Mr. Jefferson there says, “Here I will beg leave to propose a doubt. The present desire of America, is to produce rapid population, by as great importations of foreigners as possible. But is this founded in good policy?” “Are there no inconveniences to be thrown into the scale, against the advantage expected from a multiplication of numbers, by the importation of foreigners? It is for the happiness of those united in society, to harmonize as much as possible, in matters which they must of necessity transact together. Civil government being the sole object of forming societies, its administration must be conducted by common consent. Every species of government has its specific principles: Ours, perhaps, are more peculiar than those of any other in the universe. It is a composition of the freest principles of the English Constitution, with others, derived from natural right and reason. To these, nothing can be more opposed than the maxims of absolute monarchies. Yet from such, we are to expect the greatest number of emigrants. They will bring with them the principles of the governments they leave, imbibed in their early youth; or if able to throw them off, it will be in exchange for an unbounded licentiousness, passing as is usual, from one extreme to another. It would be a miracle were they to stop precisely at the point of temperate liberty. Their principles with their language, they will transmit to their children. In proportion to their numbers, they will share with us in the legislation. They will infuse into it their spirit, warp and bias its direction, and render it a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass. I may appeal to experience, during the present contest, for a verification of these conjectures: but if they be not certain in event, are they not possible, are they not probable? Is it not safer to wait with patience for the attainment of any degree of population desired or expected? May not our government be more homogeneous, more peaceable, more durable? Suppose 20 millions of republican Americans, thrown all of a sudden into France, what would be the condition of that kingdom? If it would be more turbulent, less happy, less strong, we may believe that the addition of half a million of foreigners, to our present numbers, would produce a similar effect here.” Thus wrote Mr. Jefferson in 1781—Behold the reverse of the medal. The Message of the President contains the following sentiments, “A denial of citizenship under a residence of 14 years, is a denial to a great proportion of those who ask it, &amp; controls a policy pursued from their first settlement, by many of these states, and still believed of consequence to their prosperity. And shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitives, from distress, that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land? Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? Might not the general character and capabilities of a citizen, be safely communicated to every one manifesting a bona fide purpose of embarking his life and fortune permanently with us?”  
But if gratitude can be allowed to form an excuse for inconsistency in a public character, in The Man of the People; a strong plea of this sort may be urged in behalf of our President. It is certain that had the late election been decided intirely by native citizens, had foreign auxiliaries been rejected on both sides, the man who ostentatiously vaunts that the doors of public honor and confidence have been burst open to him, would not now have been at the head of the American nation. Such a proof then of virtuous discernment in the oppressed fugitives, had an imperious claim on him to a grateful return, and without supposing any very uncommon share of self-love; would naturally be a strong reason for a revolution in his opinions.  
The pathetic and plaintive exclamations by which the sentiment is enforced, might be liable to much criticism, if we are to consider it in any other light, than as a flourish of rhetoric. It might be asked in return, does the right to asylum or hospitality carry with it the right to suffrage and sovereignty? And what indeed was the courteous reception which was given to our forefathers, by the savages of the wilderness? When did these humane and philanthropic savages exercise the policy of incorporating strangers among themselves, on their first arrival in the country? When did they admit them into their huts, to make part of their families, and when did they distinguish them by making them their sachems? Our histories and traditions have been more than aprocryphal, if any thing like this kind, and gentle treatment was really lavished by the much-belied savages upon our thankless forefathers. But the remark occurs, had it all been true, prudence inclines to trace the history farther, and ask what has become of the nations of savages who exercised this policy? And who now occupies the territory which they then inhabited? Perhaps a useful lesson might be drawn from this very reflection.  
But we may venture to ask what does the President really mean, by insinuating that we treat aliens coming to this country, with inhospitality? Do we not permit them quietly to land on our shores? Do we not protect them equally with our own citizens, in their persons and reputation; in the acquisition and enjoyment of property? Are not our Courts of justice open for them to seek redress of injuries? And are they not permitted peaceably to return to their own country whenever they please, and to carry with them all their effects? What then means this worse than idle declamation?  
The impolicy of admitting foreigners to an immediate and unreserved participation in the right of suffrage, or in the sovereignty of a Republic, is as much a received axiom as any thing in the science of politics, and is verified by the experience of all ages. Among other instances, it is known, that hardly any thing contributed more to the downfall of Rome, than her precipitate communication of the privileges of citizenship to the inhabitants of Italy at large. And how terribly was Syracuse scourged by perpetual seditions, when, after the overthrow of the tyrants, a great number of foreigners were suddenly admitted to the rights of citizenship? Not only does ancient but modern, and even domestic history furnish evidence of what may be expected from the dispositions of foreigners, when they get too early footing in a country. Who wields the sceptre of France, and has erected a Despotism on the ruins of a Republic? A foreigner. Who rules the councils of our own ill-fated, unhappy country? And who stimulates persecution on the heads of its citizens, for daring to maintan an opinion, and for exercising the rights of suffrage? A foreigner! Where is the virtuous pride that once distinguished Americans? Where the indignant spirit which in defence of principle, hazarded a revolution to attain that independence now insidiously attacked?  
  
Lucius Crassus.

THE next exceptionable feature in the Mes-  
sage, is the proposal to abolish all restriction on  
naturalization, arising from a previous residence.  
In this the President is not more at variance with  
the concurrent maxims of all commentators on  
popular governments, than he is with himself.  
‘The Notes on Virginia are in direct contradiction  
to the Message, and furnish us with strong rea-  
sons against the policy now recommended. The  
passage alluded to is here presented: Speaking  
of the population of America, Mr. Jefferson there  
says, “‘ Here I will beg leave to propose a doubt.  
The present desire of America, is to produce ra-  
pid population, by as great importations of foreign-  
ers as possible. But is this founded in good policy ?”  
* Are there no inconveniences to be thrown into  
the scale, against the advantage expected froma  
multiplication of numbers, by the importation of  
foreigners? It is for the happiness of those uni-  
ted in society, to harmonize as much as possible,  
in matters which they must of necessity transact  
together. Civil government being the sole ob-  
ject of forming societies, its administration must  
be conducted by common consent. Every spe-  
cies of government has its specific principles :  
Ours, perhaps, are more peculiar than those of  
any other in the universe. Jt is a composition of  
the freest principles of the English Constitution, with  
others, derived from natural right and reason.  
‘To these, nothing can be more opposed than the  
maxims of absolute monarchies. Yet from such,  
we are to expect the greatest number of emigrants.  
They will bring with them the principles of the go-  
vernments they leave, imbibed in their early youth ;  
or if able to throw ticm off, it will be in exchange for  
an unbounded licentiousness, passing, as is usual, from  
ene extreme to another. It would be a miracle were  
they to stop precisely at the point of temperate liberty.  
Their principles with their language, they will trans-  
mit to their children. In proportion to their num-  
bers, they will share with us in the legislation. They  
will infuse into it their sptrit, warp and bias its di-  
rection, and render it a heterogeneous, incoherent,  
distracted mass. 1 may appeal to experience, dur-  
ing the present contest, for a verification of these  
conjectures: but if they be not certain in event,  
are they not possible, are they not probable? Js  
it not safer to wait with patience for the attainment  
ef uny degree of population desired or expected ?  
May not our government be more homogeneous,  
more pe.ceable, more durable? Suppose 20 millions  
of republican Americans, thrown all of a sudden  
into France, what would be the condition of that  
kingdom: If it would be more turbulent, less  
bappy, less strong, we may believe that the ad-  
dition of half a million of foreigners, to our pre-  
scent numbers, would produce a similar effect  
here.” Thus wrote Mr. Jefferson in 1781—Be-  
hold the reverse of the medal. The Message of  
the President contains the following sentiments,  
* A denial of citizenship under a residence of 14  
years, is a denial to a great proportion of those  
who ask it, and controuls a policy pursued from  
their first seitlemeut, by many of these states,  
  
  
  
THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
and still believed of consequence to their prosperity.  
And shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitives,  
from distress, that hospitality which the savages  
of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriv-  
ing in this land ? Shall oppressed humanity find  
no asylum on this globe? Might not the general  
character and capabilities of a citizen, be safely  
communicated to every one manifesting a bona fide  
  
purpose of embarking his life and fortune perma- ’  
  
nently with us?”  
  
But if gratitude can be allowed to form an ex-  
cuse for inconsistency in a public character, in  
The Man of the People ; a strong plea of this sort  
may be urged in behalf of our President. It is  
certain that had the late election been decided in-  
tirely by native citizens, had foreign auxiliaries  
been rejected on both sides, the man who osten-  
tatiously vaunts that the doars of public honor and  
confidence have been burst open to him, would not  
now have been at the head of the American na-  
tion. Such a proof then of virtuous discernment  
in the oppressed fugitives, had an imperious claim  
on him to a grateful return, and without suppos-  
ing any very uncommon share of se//-/ove, would  
naturally be a streng reason for a revolution in  
his opinions.  
  
The pathetic and plaintive exclamations by  
which the séntiment is enforced, might be liable  
to much criticism, if we are to consider it in any  
other light, than as a flourish of rhetoric. It  
might be asked in return, does the right to asylum  
or hospitality carry with it the right to suffrage  
and sovereignty? And what indeed was the  
courteous reception which was given to our fore-  
fathers, by the savages of the wilderness ? When  
did these humane and philanthropic savages exer-  
cise the policy of incorporating strangers among  
themselves, on their first arrival in the country !  
When did they admit them into their huts, to  
make part of their families, and when did they  
distinguish them by making them their sachems ?  
Our histories and traditions have been more than  
apocryphal, if any thing like this kind and gen-  
tle treatment was really lavished by the much-  
belied savages upon our thankless forefathers.  
But the remark occurs, had it all been true, pru-  
dence inclines to trace the history farther, and ask  
what has become of the nations of savages who  
exercised this policy? And who now occupies  
the territory which they then inhabited? Per-  
haps a useful lesson might be drawn from this  
very reflection.  
  
But we may venture to ask what does the Pre-  
sident really. mean, by insinuating that we treat  
aliens coming to this country, with inhospitality ?  
Do we not permit them quietly to land on our  
shores! Do we not protect them equally with  
our own citizens, in their persons and reputation ;  
in the acquisition and enjoyment of property !  
Are not our courts of justice open for them to  
seek redress of injuries?) And are they not per-  
mitted peaceably to return to their own country  
whenever they please, and to carry with them all  
their effects? What the: means this worse than  
idle declamation ?  
  
The impolicy of admitting foreigners to an im-  
mediate and unreserved participation in the right  
of suffrage, or in the sovereignty of a Republic,  
is as much a received axiom as uny thing in the  
science of politics, and is verified by the experi-  
ence of all ages. Among other instances, it is  
known, that hardly any thing contributed more to  
the downfal of Rome, than her precipitate com-  
munication of the privileges of citizenship to the  
inhabitants of Italy at large. And how terribly  
was Syracuse scourged by perpetual seditions,  
when, after-the overthrow of the tyrants, a great  
number of foreigners were suddenly admitted to  
the rights of citizenship? Not only docs ancient  
but modern, and even domestic history furnish  
evidence of what may be expected from the dis-  
  
positions of foreigners, when they get too catty:  
footing in a country. Who wields the sceptre of  
France, and has erected a Despotism on the ruins  
of a Republic? &lt;A foreigner.—Who rules the  
councils of our own ill-fated, unhappy country ?  
And who stimulates persecution on the heads of  
its citizens, for daring to maintain an opinion, and  
for exercising the rights of suffrage ? A foreigner !  
—Where is the virtuous pride that once distin-  
guished Americans *—Where the indignant spi-  
rit which in defence of principle, hazarded a re-  
volution to attain that independence now insidiously  
attacked ?

HE next exceptionable feature tn the  
Meflage, is the propofal to abolifh all  
reiiriétion of naturalization, arifing trom a  
previous refidence. In this the prefident is  
not more at variance with the concurren  
maxims of all commentators on popular gov-  
ernment, than he is with himfelf. The Notes  
on Virginia, are in direét contradiétion to the  
Meffage, and furnifh us with ftrong reafons  
againft the policy now recommended. The  
paflage alluded to is here reprefented : Speak-  
ing of the population of America, Mr. Jef-  
ferfon there fays, ‘* Here I will beg leave to  
propofe a doubt. The prefent defire of  
America, is to produce rapid population, by  
as great importatians of foreigners as poffible.  
Butis this foundedin good policy?” ** Are  
there no inconveniencies to be thrown into  
the feale, againft the advantage expected from  
a multiplication of numbers, by the zmport-  
ation of forergners ? Itis for ‘the happinels  
of thefe united in fociety, to harmonize as  
muchas poffible, in matters which they muift  
of neceflity tranfaét together. Civil govern-  
ment being the fole objet of forming focieties,  
its adminiftration muft be conduéted by com-  
mon confent. Every [pecies of gov ernment  
has its fpecific principles: Ours, perhaps  
are more peculiar than thofe of any other in  
theuniverfe. l¢1s acompofition of the free eft  
principles of the Englifh Confiitution, with  
others, derived from the natura! right and rea-  
fon. ‘To thefe, nothing can be more oppofed  
than the maxims ot ‘abfolute monarchies.  
Yet from fuch we are to expe&amp; the great. ft  
number of emigrants. They w nll bring x with  
them the principles of the governments they  
leave, imbibed in their early youth 3 01 if  
able to throw them off, it will be in exchange  
for an unbounded licentioufne/s, paffing, as  
is ufual, from one extreme to another. It  
would bea miracle were they to flop precrfe ly  
at the point of temperate kbetts. Ther  
principles with tkerr language, they wall  
tranf{mit to their children. In proportion to  
their numbers, they will fhare with usin the  
legiflation. ‘They will intufe into it their  
{pirit, warp and bias its direction, and render  
it a heterogeneous, incoherent, diftraéted  
mafs. Imay appeal to experience, during  
the prefent conteft, for a verification of thefe  
conjeétures; but if they be not certain in  
event, arethey not poflible, are they not pro-  
bable ? Is it not fafer to wait with patience  
for the attainment of any degree of popula-  
tion defired or expeéted ? May not our go-  
vernment be more homogeneous, more peace-  
able, more durable ? Suppofe 20 millions of  
republican Americans, shirdien al} of a fudden  
  
  
  
into France, what would be the condition of  
that kingdom ? If it would be more turbulent,

lefs happy, lefs ftrong, we may believe that  
the addition of half a million of foreigners, to  
our prefent numbers, would produce a fimi-  
lar effeét here.” Thus wrote Mr. Jefferfon  
in 1781—Behold the reverfe of the medal.  
The meffige of the Prefident, contains the  
following fentiments: ‘* A denial of citizen-  
fhip, under a refidence of 14 years, is a den-  
ial to a great proportion of thofe who afk it,  
and controls a_policy purfued trom their firft  
fettlement, by many of thefe ftates, and ftill  
believed of confequence to their profperity.  
And fhall we reiufeto the unhappy fugi-  
tives from diftrefs, that hofpitality which the  
favages of the wildernefs extended to our fa-  
thers arriving in this land ? Shall oppreffed  
humanity find no afylum on. this globe ?  
Might not the general charaéter and capabili-  
tics of a citizen, be fafely communicated to  
every one manifeftinga bona fide purpofe of  
embarking his life and fortune permanently  
with us ?”’  
  
But if gratitude can be allowed to form an  
excufe for inconfiftency in a public charac-  
ter,in The Man of the People; a ftrong plea  
of this fort may be urged in behalf of our  
Prefident. It is certain that had the late e-  
leftion been decided entirely by native citt-  
zens, had foreign auxiliaries been rejeéted on  
both fides, the man who oftentatioufly vaunts  
that the doors of public honor and confidence  
have been burft open to him, would not now  
have been at the head of the American nation.  
Such a proof then of virtuous difcernment in  
the oppreffed fugitives, had an imperious  
claim on him toa grateful return, and without  
fuppofing any very uncommon fhare of /e/f-  
fove, would naturally be a {trong reafon tor a  
revolution tn his opinions.  
  
The pathetic and plaintive exclamations by  
which the fentiment is enforced, might be  
liable to much eriticifm, 1f we areto confider  
itin any other light, than as a flourifh of rhe-  
toric. It migl.t be afked in return, does the  
right to a/)/um or hofpitality carry with it the  
right to fuffrage and fovereignty ? And what  
indeed was the courteous reception which  
was given to our forefathers, by the favages  
ot the wildernefs ? When did thefe humane  
and philantrophic favages exercife the policy  
of incorporating ftrangers among themielves,  
on their firft arrival in the country ? When  
did they admit them into their hnts, to make  
part of their families, and when did they dif-  
tinguifh them by making them their fachems ?  
Our hiftories and traditions have been more  
than apocryphal, if any thing like this kind,  
and gentle treatment was really lavifhed by the  
much belied favages upon our thanklefs tore-  
fathers. But the remark occurs, had it al!  
been true, prudence inclines to trace the hif-  
tory farther, and afk what has become of the  
nations of favages who exercifed this policy ?  
And who now occupies the territory which  
they theninhabited ? Perhaps a ufeful jeffon  
might be drawn from this very refleétion.  
  
But we may. venture to afk what does the  
Prefident really mean, by infinuating that we  
  
‘  
!  
‘  
  
  
  
—_  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
treat aliens coming to this country, with inhof-  
pitality ? Do we not permit them quietly to  
land on our fhores ? Do we not proteét them  
equally with our own citizens, in their per-  
fons and reputation ; in the acquifition and  
enjoyment of property ? Are not. our courts  
of juftice open for them to feek redrefs of in-  
juries ? Andare they not permitted peaceably  
to return to their own-country whenever the;  
pleafe, and to carry with them all their ef-  
feéts ? What then means this worfe than idle  
declamation ?  
  
The impolicy of admitting foreigners to an  
immediate and unreferved participation in  
the right of fuffrage, or in the fovereignty of  
a Republic, is as much a received axiom as  
any thing in the fcience of politics, and  
is verifred by the experience of all ages.  
Among other inftances, it is known, that  
hardly any thing contributed more to the  
downtall of Ronee, than her precipitate com-  
munication of the privileges of citizenfhip  
to the inhabitants of Italy at large. And  
how terrible was Syracufe fcourged by per-  
petual feditions, when, after the overthrow  
of the tyrants,a great number of foreigners  
were fuddenly admitted to the rights of citi-  
zenfhip ? Not only does ancient but modern,  
and even domeftic hiltory turnifh evidence  
of what may be expeéted from the difpofitions  
of foreigners, when they get too early foot-  
ing inacountry. Who wields the fceptre  
of France, and has ereéted a Defpotifm on  
the ruins of a Republic ? A ftoreigner.—  
Who rules the counci] of our own ill-fated,  
unhappy country ? And who ftimulates per-  
fecution on the heads of its citizens, for dar-  
ing to maintain an opinion and for exerci-  
fing the right of fuflrage ? A Foreigner !  
Where is the virtuous pride that once dif-  
tinguifhed Americans ’—Where the indig-  
nant {pirit which in defence of principle,  
hazarded a revolntion to attain that indepen-  
dence now infidioufly attacked ?

But if gratitude can be allowed to form an

“The impolicy of admitting foreigners to an  
immediate and unreserved participation in the  
right of suffrage, or in the sovereignty of a re-  
public, is as much a received axiom as any thing  
in the science of politics, and is verified by the

by perpetual seditions, when after the overthrow  
of the tyrants, a great number of foreigners were

new means of abridging labour and extending produce be intro-  
duced. Mr. Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, speaking of the  
wants of the country, with regard to population, and the acquisi-

hensive view of that question: he says, ‘the present desire of  
America is, to produce rapid population by as great importations

may retain their adherence to the principles of the governments

Yet from such, we may expect the greatest number of
