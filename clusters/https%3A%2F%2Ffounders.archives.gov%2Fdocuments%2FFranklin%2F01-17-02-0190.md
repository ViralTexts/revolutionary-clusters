This is the true political Idea, that every Writer on these Subjects should have in View. Most of them think only of the good of a Part, Britain.  
The writer lives in the country, and has not kept up with the pamphlet controversy on the American question; he may therefore be repeating inadvertently some ideas of others. “The good of the whole British empire is what he aims at: the colonies of course must come into consideration; which has obliged him to hasten his work, that it may be printed before the parliament decides what shall be done in regard to them.”  
  
  
In what Degree?

The Difference is not so great as may be imagined. Happiness is more generally and equally diffus’d among Savages than in our civiliz’d Societies. No European who has once tasted Savage Life, can afterwards bear to live in our Societies. The Care and Labour of providing for artificial and fashionable Wants, the Sight of so many Rich wallowing in superfluous Plenty, whereby so many are kept poor distress’d by Want: The Insolence of Office, the Snares and Plagues of Law, the Restraints of Custom, all contribute to disgust them with what we call civil Society.  
In the present disputes about liberty, it is important to understand the meaning of the word. The benefits we derive from society are apparent only when we lose them, but reflection will show us “the happiness we enjoy beyond what is attainable by solitary savages.” The

What ancient Laws? Probably Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, Petition of Right, &amp;c. This Author supposes the Colonists want a new Parliament in order to have the Duties taken off. He is mistaken. They did petition; they were not heard, and they will petition no more. They have taken their Measures. Keep up your Duties, if you please; they will not pay them, because they will not use the Commodities. And because they think you use them ill in laying such Duties, they will manufacture for themselves. They now find they gain and save infinitely more by your Continuing the Duties, than they should by your repealing them.  
their extravagant and unjust demands of exemption from parliamentary taxations, are not complied with.” British traders are alarmed, and the colonists fan their fears “by applying the words of ancient laws to their own case,” to which those laws are irrelevant.  
  
  
Because the present Parliament has resolved to assert its authority over all British subjects, “they (the colonists and traders) cannot expect to carry their point whilst this parliament subsists; they, therefore, desire a new one; in which they hope to get several of their friends elected, in order to allow the colonists to do as they please. …”

their economy was precarious; it would have been unfair for England, with little or no public debt, to have taxed them at that time. But the last war freed the northern colonies from the danger of the French.  
  
  
They are diminished ONE HALF, by the increas’d Plenty of Land at Market, thro’ the Conquests.  
“Their estates are doubled and tripled in value and security:  
  
  
Did not America pay half of this, and more? They kept up an equal Number of Troops. They suffer’d immensely by the Embargoes.  
the reasons of exempting them from taxes, no longer exist: the expence of the wars which produced these happy events to the Americans, is charged to the publick. There can be no doubt then in equity, that they should now bear a proportionate part in the payment of the debt, since they have more than a proportionate part of the benefit.”  
  
  
  
A false Charge.  
Some colonists carry their case further, not only claiming independence of Parliament, but “paying little regard to the crown” when its orders are not to their liking. “If this behaviour arises  
  
  
Meddle with them at your Peril. No Alteration can be made in them but by Consent of both Parties, the King and the Colonists. By violating them you break the Link that holds those two parts together.  
in consequence of their charters, it seems high time to annul or amend them.”  
  
  
But there may be in different States.  
“There cannot be two equal legislatures in any state.” One must be supreme, the others subordinate. The charters of British cities give the corporations autonomy within their areas, but no right to contest the authority of Parliament.  
  
  
The Corporations of Britain are within the Realm, therefore within the Jurisdiction of Parliament. The Colonies are without the Realm. Therefore not.  
  
  
The British State had no Share in forming and supporting the Colonies, except Georgia and Nova Scotia. And New England had a great share in the latter.  
“It is the essential quality of a province to depend on THAT STATE which formed and supported it.” The colonists like to fancy that they have the same relationship to the mother country that the Flemish provinces had to  
  
  
The Colonies depend no more on Britain than Hanover does.  
Spain, whereas in fact those provinces “depended no more on Spain, than Hanover does on Britain”; the inhabitants were not Spanish subjects. For a province composed of subjects of the state to pretend to equality is “a sort of civil mutiny,” and suggests that the colonists may intend “to withdraw their allegiance.”  
  
  
It is great Impudence or Folly in a Man to suppose, that because he is an Englishman every American Owes him Allegiance. If every Englishman is not a Sovereign over every American, neither can he communicate such Sovereignty to another, by chusing him Parliament Man.  
  
  
Never.  
“It seems in the present situation of affairs, that either the rights and dignity of Great Britain … must be submitted to the apparent (but not real) interest of the colonies; or the colonies must acknowledge the legislative supremacy of

It is very true. To keep People in England by Compulsion, is to make England a Prison, and every Englishman. The Right of Migration is common to all Men, a natural Right.

three hundred pounds there, he buys a tract of  
uncultivated land, a part of which, in a few  
years, produces all the neceſſarles of life: he

brings up his ſons to be farmers, who cultivate  
the reſt. Whilſt the advantage of agriculture  
exceeds that of manufactures, the people will  
naturally run into that method of life, and  
conſequently purchaſe goods from England.  
But when America is fully peopled, the price  
of land will encreaſe: the farther the coloniſts  
extend themſelves from the ſea and great ri-  
vers, the dearer our manufactures muſt come  
to them, on account of land- carriage: they  
will then run into manufactures. A linnen-  
manufactory was ſet up at Boſton many years  
ago, they had people from Ireland to carry it  
on; but from the reaſon already given, the  
manufacturers ſoon quitted it, and it came to  
nothing. There are indeed ſome German ma-  
nufacturers at Philadelphia who work, becauſe  
being poor, they gain thereby an immediate  
ſupport for themſelves and families: but as  
ſoon as they are able to purchaſe land, they  
will probably do as others have done before  
them.

Jalus populi fuprema lex eflvo. We muſt en-  
  
deavour to keep 50 it as near as human infir-  
mity will permit. The charters on which the  
coloniſts found their pretenſions, are merely  
acts of the crown intended for the benefit of  
order in the colonies. The crown could fix  
and limit its own rights and claims as ſovereign  
of the ſoil, but could not exempt the coloniſts  
from the obedience they owed to the Britiſh  
legiſlature : if they have retained and claimed  
the right of Britiſh ſubjects from their firſt ſet-  
tlement to this time, it is plain they did not  
look upon themſelves as aliens. In all diſtreſſes  
they have applied to Great Britain as citizens,  
and have been protected as ſuch ; their char-  
ters then muſt be underftood as conſiſtent with  
their condition of citizens, and not as repug-  
nant to it.  
  
Would the coloniſts have croſſed the fea to  
form a ſettlement in America, if their quality  
of Britiſh citizens had not been their protec-  
tion ? Or ſuppoſing one formed, would it have  
ſubſiſted ten years on any other footing than

laid taxes on the coloniſts, becauſe their pro-  
duce was precarious, , and they were obliged  
to employ part of their time and ſtrength in  
  
  
neighbours,  
  
5 E  
  
e &quot;Eggland. was then ſo far from  
taxing them, that it encouraged more people  
to go over, which it would never have done,  
but on the ſuppoſition, that they were to be as  
much Engliſh ſubjects on one fide of the ſea,  
as on the other.  
  
By the laſt war, the northern coloniſts are  
freed from the difficulties they laboured under;  
their eſtates are doubled and tripled in value  
and ſecurity : the reaſons of exempting them  
from taxes, no longer exiſt : the expence of  
the wars which produced theſe happy events to  
the Americans, is charged to the publick.  
There can be no doubt then in equity, that  
they ſhould now bear a proportionate part in  
the payment of the debt, ſince they have more  
than a proportionate part of the benefit. |  
  
To ſuppoſe, that England intended to lay all  
burthens on one part of her ſubjects, and to  
give the other part all advantages perpetually,  
is abſurd. But ſome coloniſts carry it farther  
ſtill, not only aſſerting that their charters ex-  
empt them from the legiſlative authority of  
Great Britain, but alſo paying little regard to  
the crown, which they very eaſily ſee inſulted,

when its orders are not juſt to their mind. If  
  
  
  
and others inferior. The charters of ſome cities  
give the corporations authority to enact bye-  
laws for the maintainance of order, and for  
making improvements in their own diſtricts ;  
but this authority does by no means exempt  
  
  
of the common law of the land, if their bye-  
laws are lucrative, oppreſſive, and contrary to  
the common good.  
  
It is the eſſential quality of a province to  
depend on that ſtate which formed and ſup-  
ported it. I ſpeak of the word province in its  
true ſenſe, for it ſometimes ſignifies only a  
diviſion of the ſame country; as France is  
divided into provinces, and the Netherlands  
alſo. From .this ambiguity our coloniſts in  
jeveral of their writings ſuppoſe themſelves to  
  
  
their  
  
© 3 1  
their eaſe is totally different: the Netherlands  
belonged to Charles V. as heir to the dukes of  
Burgundy; and though he became afterwards  
king of Spain, yet the provinces in the Nether-  
lands depended no more on Spain, than Ha-  
nover does on Britain; the inhabitants were  
Flemiogs and not Spaniards. For a province  
formed entirely from ſubjects of the ſtate to  
pretend to cquality, ſcems a fort of civil mu-  
tiny: it is to be hoped that our coloniſts have  
run into cheſe exceſſes rather from error in  
judgment, than from a deſign to withdraw their  
allegiance ; a ſhort time will ſhew their in-  
tentions.  
  
It ſeems in the preſent ſituation of affairs,  
that either the rights and dignity of Great  
Britain, and the good of the whole, muſt be  
ſubmitted to the apparent (but not real) intereſt  
of the colonies; or the colonies muſt acknow-  
ledge the legiſlative ſupremacy of Great Britain,  
and contribute their proportion to the good of  
the whole; or a rupture muſt enſue

Text. “Fora province, formed entirely from subjects of  
the state, to pretend to equality, seems a sort of civil mutiny. It  
is to be hoped that our colonists have run into these excesses, ra-  
ther from error in judgment than from a design to withdraw their  
allegiance.”  
  
Nore. It is great impudence or folly in a man to suppose  
that, because he is an Englishman, every American owes him  
allegiance. If every Englishman is not a sovereign over every  
American, neither can he communicate such sovereignty to ano-  
ther, by choosing him parliament man.
