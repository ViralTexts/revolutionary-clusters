suggests to me the fear of some general source of miscarriage.  
The capture of three French merchant ships by the Algerines under different pretexts, has produced great sensation in the seaports of this country, and some in it’s government. They have ordered some frigates to be armed at Toulon to punish them. There is a possibility that this circumstance, if not too soon set to rights by the Algerines, may furnish occasion to the States general, when they shall have leisure to attend to matters of this kind, to disavow any future tributary treaty with them. These pyrates respect still less their treaty with Spain, and treat the Spaniards with an insolence greater than was usual before the treaty.  
The scarcity of bread begins to lessen in the Southern parts of France where the harvest is commenced. Here it is still threatening because we have yet two or three weeks to the beginning of harvest, and I think there has not been t

o the reunion of the orders, which took place on the 27th. Within the Assembly matters went on well. But it was soon observed that troops, and particularly the foreign troops, were on their march towards Paris from various quarters and that this was against the opinion of Mr. Necker. The king was probably advised to this under pretext of preserving peace in Paris and Versailles, and saw nothing else in the measure. But his advisers are supposed to have had in view, when he should be secured and inspirited by the presence of the troops, to take advantage of some favorable moment and surprize him into an act of authority for establishing the Declaration of the 23d of June, and perhaps dispersing the States general. The Marshal de Broglio was appointed to command all the troops within the Isle of France, a high flying Aristocrat, cool and capable of every thing. Some of the French guards were soon arrested under other pretexts, but in reality on account of their dispositions in favor of the national cause. The people of Paris forced the prison, released them, and sent a deputation to the States general to solicit a pardon. The States by a most moderate and prudent Arreté recommended these prisoners

to the king, and peace to the people of Paris. Addresses  came in to them from several of the great cities expressing sincere allegiance to the king, but a determined resolution to support the States general. On the 8th. of July they vote an address to the king to remove the troops. This peice of masculine eloquence, written by Monsieur de Mirabeau, is worth attention, on account of the bold matter it expresses or covers, thro the whole. The king refuses to remove the troops and says they may remove themselves if they please to Noyons or Soissons. They proceed to fix the order in

which they will take up the several branches of their future constitution, from which it appears they mean to build it from the bottom, confining themselves to nothing in their antient form, but a king. A Declaration of rights, which forms the first chapter of their work was then proposed by the Marquis de la Fayette. This was

on the 11th.—In the mean time troops to the number of about 125. or 30,000 had arrived and were posted in and between Paris and Versailles. The bridges and passes were guarded. At 3. oclock in the afternoon the Count de la Luzerne was sent to notify Mr. Necker of his dismission, and to enjoin him to retire instantly without saying a word of it to any body. He went home, dined, proposed to his wife a visit to a friend, but went in fact to his country house at St. Ouen, and at midnight set out from thence for

Brussels. This was not known till the next day, when the whole ministry was changed except Villedeuil of the Domestic department and Barentin Garde des sceaux. These changes were as follows. The Baron de Breteuil President of the council of finance, and de la Galaisiere Comptroller General in the room of Mr. Necker; the Mareshal de Broglio minister of war, and Foulon under him, in the room of Puy-segur; Monsieur de la Vauguyon minister of foreign affairs instead of Monsieur de Montmorin; de la Porte, minister of marine, in place of the Count de la Luzerne; St. Priest was also removed from the council.

g whom had been noted thro’ their lives for the Turkish despotism of their characters, and who were associated about the king as proper instruments for what  was to be executed.—The news of this change began to be known in Paris about 1. or 2. oclock. In the afternoon a body of about 100. German cavalry were advanced and drawn up in the Place Louis XV. and about 300 Swiss posted at a little distance in their rear. This drew people to that spot, who naturally formed themselves in front of the troops, at first merely to look at them. But as their numbers increased their indignation arose: they retired a few steps, posted themselves on and behind large piles of loose stone collected in that Place for a bridge adjacent to it, and attacked the horse with stones. The horse charged, but the advantageous position of the people, and the showers of stones obliged them to retire, and even to quit the field altogether, leaving one of their number on the ground. The Swiss in their rear were observed never to stir. This was the signal for universal insurrection, and this body of cavalry, to avoid being massacred, retired towards Versailles. The people now armed themselves with such weapons as they could find in Armourer’s shops and private houses, and with bludgeons, and were roaming all night through all parts of the city without any decided and practicable object. The next day the States press on the king to send away the troops, to permit the Bourgeoisie  
  
13th.  
  
of Paris to arm for the preservation of order in the city, and offer to send a deputation from their body to tranquillize them. He refuses all their propositions. A Committee of magistrates and electors of the city are appointed, by their bodies, to take upon them it’s government. The mob, now openly joined by the French guards, force the prisons of St. Lazare, release all the prisoners, and take a great store of corn, which they carry to the corn market. Here they get some arms, and the French guards begin to form and train them. The City committee determine to raise 48,000 Bourgeois,  
  
14th.  
  
or rather to restrain their numbers to 48,000. On the 14th. they send one of their members (Monsieur de Corny, whom we knew in America) to the Hotel des Invalides to ask arms for their Garde Bourgeoise. He was followed by, or he found there, a great mob. The Governor of the Invalids came out and represented the impossibility of his delivering arms without the orders of those from whom he received them. De Corney advised the people then to retire, retired himself, and the people took possession of the arms. It was remarkeable that not only the Invalids themselves made no opposition, but that a body of 5000 foreign troops, encamped within 400. yards, never stirred. Monsieur de Corny and five others were then sent to ask arms of Monsieur de Launai,  Governor of the Bastille. They found a great collection of people already before the place, and they immediately planted a flag of truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the parapet. The deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a little, advanced themselves to make their demand of the Governor, and in that instant a discharge from the Bastille killed 4. people of those nearest to the deputies. The deputies retired, the people rushed against the place, and almost in an instant were in possession of a fortification, defended by 100 men, of infinite strength, which in other times had stood several regular sieges and had never been taken. How they got in, has as yet been impossible to discover. Those, who pretend to have been of the party tell so many different stories as to destroy the credit of them all. They took all the arms, discharged the prisoners and such of the garrison as were not killed in the first moment of fury, carried the Governor and Lieutenant governor to the Greve (the place of public execution) cut off their heads, and set them through the city in triumph to the Palais royal. About the same instant, a treacherous correspondence having been discovered in Monsieur de Flesselles prevot des marchands, they seize him in the hotel de vile, where he was in the exercise of his office, and cut off his head. These events carried imperfectly to Versailles were the subject of two successive deputations from the States to the King, to both of which he gave dry and hard answers, for it has transpired that it had been proposed and agitated in Council to seize on the principal members of the States general, to march the whole army down upon Paris and to suppress it’s tumults by the sword. But at night the Duke de Liancourt forced his way into the king’s bedchamber, and obliged him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of the day in Paris. He went to bed deeply impressed. The decapitation of de Launai worked powerfully thro’ the night on the whole Aristocratical party, insomuch that in the morning those of the greatest influence on the Count d’Artois represented to him the absolute necessity that the king should give up every thing to the states. This according well enough with the dispositions of the king, he went about 11. oclock, accompanied only by his brothers, to the States general, and there read to them a speech, in which he asked their interposition to re-establish order. Tho this be couched in terms of some caution, yet the manner in which it was delivered made it evident that it was meant as a surrender at discretion. He returned to the chateau afoot, accompanied by the States. They sent off a deputation, the  Marquis de la Fayette at their head, to quiet Paris. He had the same morning been named Commandant en chef of the milice Bourgeoise, and Monsieur Bailly, former President of the States general, was called for as Prevost des marchands. The demolition of the Bastille was now ordered, and begun. A body of the Swiss guards, of the regiment of Ventimille, and the city horse guards join the people. The alarm at Versailles increases instead of abating. They believed that the Aristocrats of Paris were under pillage and carnage, that 150,000 men were in arms coming to Versailles to massacre the Royal family, the court, the ministers and all connected with them, their practices and principles. The Aristocrats of the Nobles and Clergy in the States general vied with each other in declaring how sincerely they were converted to the justice of voting by persons, and how determined to go with the nation all it’s lengths. The foreign troops were ordered off instantly. Every minister resigned. The king confirmed Bailly as Prevost des marchands, wrote to Mr. Necker to recall him, sent his letter open to the States general to be forwarded by them, and invited them to go with him to Paris the next day to satisfy the city of his dispositions:  
  
16th.  
  
and that night and the next morning the Count d’Artois and a Monsieur de Montesson (a deputy) connected with him, Madame de Polignac, Madame de Guiche and the Count de Vaudreuil favorites of the queen, the Abbé de Vermont her confessor, the Prince of Condé and Duke de Bourbon, all fled, we know not whither. The king came to Paris, leaving the queen in consternation for his return. Omitting the less important figures of the procession, I will only observe that the king’s carriage was in the center, on each side of it the States general, in two ranks, afoot, at their head the Marquis de la Fayette as commander in chief, on horseback, and Bourgeois guards before and behind. About 60,000 citizens of all forms and colours, armed with the muskets of the Bastille and Invalids as far as they would go, the rest with pistols, swords, pikes, pruning hooks, scythes &amp;c. lined all the streets thro’ which the procession passed, and, with the crowds of people in the streets, doors and windows, saluted them every where with cries of ‘vive la nation.’ But not a single ‘vive le roy’ was heard. The king landed at the Hotel de ville. There Monsieur Bailly presented and put into his hat the popular cockade, and addressed him. The king being unprepared and unable to answer, Bailly went to him, gathered from him some scraps of sentences, and made out an answer, which he delivered to the Audience as from the king.  On their return the popular cries were ‘vive le roy et la nation.’ He was conducted by a garde Bourgeoise to his palace at Versailles, and thus concluded such an Amende honorable as no sovereign ever made, and no people ever received. Letters written with his own hand to the Marquis de la Fayette remove the scruples of his position. Tranquillity is now restored to the Capital: the shops are again opened; the people resuming their labours, and, if the want of bread does not disturb our peace, we may hope a continuance of it. The demolition of the Bastille is going on, and the milice Bourgeoise organising and training. The antient police of the city is abolished by the authority of the people, the introduction of king’s troops will probably be proscribed, and a watch or city guards substituted, which shall depend on the city alone. But we cannot suppose this paroxysm confined to Paris alone. The whole country must pass successively thro’ it, and happy if they get thro’ it as soon and as well as Paris has done. I went yesterday to Versailles to satisfy myself what had passed there; for nothing can be believed but what one sees, or has from an eye witness. They believe there still that 3000 people have fallen victims to the tumults of Paris. Mr. Short and myself have been every day among them in order to be sure of what was passing. We cannot find with certainty that any body has been killed but the three beforementioned, and those who fell in the assault or defence of the Bastille. How many of the garrison were killed no body pretends to have ever heard. Of the assailants accounts vary from 6. to 600. The most general belief is that there fell about 30. There have been many reports of instantaneous executions by the mob, on such of their body as they caught in acts of theft or robbery. Some of these may perhaps be true. There was a severity of honesty observed of which no example has been known. Bags of money offered on various occasions, thro fear or guilt, have been uniformly refused by the mobs. The churches are now occupied in singing ‘De profundis’ and ‘Requiems for the repose of the souls of the brave and valiant citizens who have sealed with their blood the liberty of the nation.’—Monsieur de Montmorin is this day replaced in the department of foreign affairs, and Monsieur de St. Priest is named to the Home department. The gazettes of France and Leyden accompany this. I send also a paper (called the Point du jour) which will give you some idea of the proceedings of the National assembly. It is but an indifferent thing; however it is the best.—I have the honor to be with great esteem and respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servt.,

P.S. July 21. Mr. Necker had left Brussels for Francfort before the Courier got there. We expect however to hear of him in a day or two. Monsieur le Comte de la Luzerne has resumed the department of the marine this day.

Extract of a letter from Paris.  
&quot; THE capture of three French merchantfhips  
by the Algerines under different pretexts, has  
produced great sensation in the seaports of this  
country. The scarcity of bread begins to leflen  
in the southern parts of France, where the harvest  
is commenced : Here it is Hill threatning, because  
we have yet two or three weeks to the beginning  
of harvest.

27th June. Within the Aflembly matters weni

A declaration oi rights which forms the firft chap­

&quot; In the mean time troops to&#x27;the number of  
about 25 or 30,000 had arrived, and were ported

he set out tor Bruflells. This was not known till  
the next day (12th) when the whole ministry  
was changed,except Villepeuij. of thedomeftic

These changes were as follows : The Baron  
de Bret e ui l, President of the Council of Finance,  
and De la Galaitiere, Comptroller General in  
the room of Mr. Neckar—the Marshal de Broc­

Minister of Foreign Affairs,inftead of M.de Mokt­

was also removed from the Council.  
&quot; The news of this change began to be known  
in Paris about lor 2 o&#x27;clock. In the afternoon a

and drawn up in the place Louis XV. and about

retire, retired hiinfelf, and the people took pof­  
feflion of the arms. It was remarkable that not  
only the invalids themselves made no opporttion,  
but that a body of 5000 foreign troops, encamp,

of the Baftile. How many of the garril&#x27;on were  
killed no body pretends to have ever heard :   
Of the aflailants, accounts vary from 6 to 600   
the moll general belief is, that there fell about  
thirty. Therehave been many reports of instan­  
taneous executions by the mob, 011 such of their  
body as they caught in atfts of theft or robbery :  
Some oftliefe may perhaps be true : There was  
a severity of honesty obfervedof which 110 exam­  
ple has been known : Bags of money offered on  
various occaftons, through fear or guilt have been  
uniformly refufed by the mobs.—The churches  
are now occupied in singing &quot; DeProfundis&quot; and  
&quot; Requiems for the r-pofe of the fouls of the brave and  
&quot; valiant citizens ixihohave fealednbith their blood the  
&quot; liberty ef the nation.&quot; M. de Montmorin is  
thisday replaced in the department of Fo­  
reign Affairs, M. de St. Priest is named to the  
Home Department. (21ft.) M. Neckar had  
left Bruflels for Franckfort before the Courier &lt;rot  
there—We expert, however, to hear of him in a  
day or two. M. le Comte de IaLuzERNE has re­  
sumed the department of the Marine this day.

‘A committtee of magistrates and electors of the city were ap-  
pointed by their bodies to take upon them its government. ‘The  
mob, now openly joined by the French guards, forced the prison  
of St Lazare, released all the prisoners, and took a great store  
of corn, which they carried to the corn-market. Here they got  
some arms, and the French guards began to form and train them.  
‘The committee determined to raise forty-eight thousand Bour-  
geois, or rather to restrain their numbers to forty-eight thousand.  
On the Mth (July, 1789,] they sent one of their members (Mon-  
sieur de Corny, whom we knew in America,) to the fotel des  
Invalides, to ask for arms their Garde Bourgeoise. He was  
followed by, or he found there, a great mob. ‘The Governor of  
the Invalides came out, and represented the impossibility of his  
delivering arms without the orders of those from whom he re-  
ceived them. De Corny advised the people then to retire, and  
retired himself; and the people took possession of the arms. It  
was remarkable, that not only the Jnvalides themselves made no  
opposition, but that a body of five thousand foreign troops, en-  
camped within four hundred yards, never stirred. Monsieur de  
Corny and five others were then sent to ask arms of Monsieur de  
Launai, Governor of the Bastile. ‘They found a great collection  
of people already before the place, and they immediately planted  
a flag of truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the  
parapet. ‘he deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a  
little, advanced themselves to make their demand of the Gover-  
nor, and in that instant a discharge from the Bastile killed four  
people of those nearest to the deputies. The deputies retired ;  
the people rushed against the place, and almost in an instant were  
in possession of a fortification, defended by one hundred men, of  
infinite strength, which, in other times, had stood several regular  
sieges, and had never been taken. How they got in has as yet  
been impossible to discover. ‘Those who pretend to have been  
of the party tell so many different stories, as to destroy the credit  
of them all. ‘They took all the arms, discharged the prisoners,  
and such of the garrison as were not killed in the first moment of  
fury, carried the Governor and Lieutenant Governor to the Greve  
(the place of public execution), cut off their heads, and sent them  
through the city in triumph to the Palais Royal. About the same  
instant, a treacherous correspondence having been discovered in  
Monsieur de Flesselles, Prévét des Marchands, they seized him  
in the Hétel de Ville, where he was in the exercise of his office,

and cut off his head. These events carried imperfectly to Ver-  
sailles, were the subject of two successive deputations from the  
States to the king, to both of which he gave dry and hard an-  
swers; for it has tri anspired, that it had been praposad and agi-  
‘ated in Council to seize on the principal members of the States  
General, to march the whole ariny down upon Paris, and to sup-  
press its tamults by the sword. But at ni; cht, the Duke de Lian-  
court forced his way into the king’s bed-chamber, and obliged  
him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of the day  
in Paris. He went to bed deeply impressed. ‘The decapitation  
of De Launai worked powerlully through the night on the whole  
aristocratical party, in so much that, in the morning, those of the  
greatest influence on the Count a’. Artois represented to him the  
absolute necessity that the king should give up everything to the  
States. ‘his according well enough with the dispositions of the  
king, he went about eleven o&#x27;clock, accompanied only by his  
brothers, to the States-General, and there read to them a speech,  
in whic h he asked their inte rposition to reestablish order. ‘Though  
this be couched in terms of some caution, yet the manner in w hich  
it was delivered made it evident that it was meant as a surrender  
  
at discretion. He returned to the Chateau afoot, accompanied  
by the States. ‘They sent off a deputation, the Marquis de la  
fayette at their head, to quiet Paris. He had, the same morning,  
been named Commandant-in-Chief of the Milice Bourg: gise, and  
Monsieur Bailly, former President of the States-General, was  
called for as Prévot des Marchands. &#x27;The demolition of the  
Bastile was now ordered and begun. &lt;A body of the Swiss guards  
of the regiment of Ventimille, and the city horse-guards joined  
the people. ‘The alarm at Versailles inc reased instead of abating.  
  
They believed that the aristocrats of Paris were under pill we and  
carnage, that one hundred and fifty thousand men were in arms,  
coming to Versailles to massacre the royal family, the court,  
  
the ministers, and all connected with them, their practices, and  
principles. ‘The aristocrats of the Nobles and Cle ray in the  
States-General vied with each other in declaring how sincerely  
they were converted to the justice of voting by persons, and how  
determined to go with the nation all its lengths. The foreign  
troops were ordered off instantly. Every minister resigned. The  
king confirmed Bailly as Prévét des ‘“Marchands, wrote to Mr  
Necker to recall him, sent his letter open to the States-General,  
to be forwarded by them, and invited them to go with him to Paris  
the next day, to satisfy the city of his dispositions; and that night  
and the next morning the Count d’Artois and Monsieur de Mon-  
tisson (a deputy connected with him), Madame de Polignac, Ma-  
dame de Guic he, and the Count de Vaudreuil, favorites of the

542 Jefferson’s Correspondence. [ April,  
  
and Duke de Bourbon, all fled, we know not whither. The king  
came to Paris, leaving =e a in consternation for his return.  
Omitting the less imp arta figures of the procession, I will only  
observe, that the king’s carriage was in the centre, on each side of  
it the States-General, in two ranks, afoot, and at their head the  
Marquis de la Fayette, as Commander-in-Chiel, on horseback, and  
Bourgeois guards before and behind. About sixty thousand citi-  
zens of all forms and colors, armed with the muskets of the Bastile  
and Invalids, as far as they would go, the rest with pistols, swords,  
pikes, pruning-looks, sc ythe S; &amp;c. , lined all the streets through  
which the procession passed, and, with the crowds of people in the  
streets, deci, and windows, saluted them every where with cries  
of Vive la Nution; but not a single Vive le Roy was heard.  
The king stopped at the fZotel de Ville. ‘There Monsieur Bailly  
presented and put into his hat the popular cockade, and address: mT  
him. ‘The king being unprepared and unable to answer, Bailly  
went to him, gathered from him some scraps of sentences, and  
made out an answer, which he delivered to the audience as from  
the king. On their return, the popular cries were Vive le Roy et  
la Nution. He was conducted by a Garde Bourgeoise to his  
palace at Versailles, and thus concluded such an amende honorabli  
as no sovereign ever made, and no people ever received. Letters  
written with his own hand to the Marquis de la Fayette remove  
the scruples of his position. Tranquillity is now restored toe the  
capital; the shops are again opened, the people resuming their  
labors, and if the want of bread does not disturb our peace, we  
may hope a continuance of it. The demolition of the Bastile is  
going on, and the Miltce Bourgeoise organizing and training.  
ah he ancient polic e of the city 1s abolishe d by the authority of the  
people, the introduction of the king’s troops will probably | Ye pro-  
scribed, and a watch or city guards substituted, which shall de-  
pend on the city Bad But we cannot suppose this paroxysm  
confined to Paris alone. ‘The whole country must piss succes-  
sively through it, and happy if they get throu; gh it as soon and as  
well as Paris has done.  
  
‘| went yesterday to Versailles to satisfy myself what had passed  
there; for nothing can be believed but what one sees, or has from  
an eye-witness. ‘hey believe there still that three thousand  
people have fallen victims to the tumults of Paris. Mr Short and  
myself have been every day among them, in order to be sure of  
what was passing. We cannot find, with certainty, that any body  
has been killed but the three before mentioned, and those who fell  
in the assault or defence of the Bastile. How many of the garrison  
were killed, nobody pre tends to have ever heard, Of the assail-

Mr Jefferson was not a man to be placed on such a stage,  
and to be admitted behind the scenes, without knowing per-  
fectly what was performed. For these advantages he hed. He  
saw the attack upon the Bastile.  
  
‘A committtee of magistrates and electors of the city were ap-  
pointed by their bodies to take upon them its government. ‘The  
mob, now openly joined by the French guards, forced the prison  
of St Lazare, released all the prisoners, and took a great store  
of corn, which they carried to the corn-market. Here they got  
some arms, and the French guards began to form and train them,  
The committee determined to raise forty-eight thousand Bour-  
geois, or rather to restrain their numbers to forty-eight thousand.  
On the Mth [July, 1789,] they sent one of their members (Mon-  
sieur de Corny, whom we knew in America,) to the //otel des  
Invalides, to ask for arms their Garde Bourgeoise. He was  
followed by, or he found there, a great mob. ‘The Governor of  
the Invalides came out, and represented the impossibility of his  
delivering arms without the orders of those from whom he re-  
ceived them. De Corny advised the people then to retire, and  
retired himself; and the people took possession of the arms. It  
was remarkable, that not only the Jnvalides themselves made no  
opposition, but that a body of five thousand foreign troops, en-  
camped within four hundred yards, never stirred. Monsieur de  
Corny and five otliers were then sent to ask arms of Monsieur de  
Laun: i, Governor of the Bastile. ‘They found a great collection  
of people already before the place, and ‘the ‘y immediately planted  
a flag of truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the  
parapet. ‘The deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a  
little, advanced themselves to make their demand of the Gover-  
nor, and in that instant a discharge from the Bastile killed four  
people of those nearest to the deputies. The deputies retired ;  
the people rushed against the place, and almost in an instant were  
in possession of a fortification, defended by one hundred men, of  
infinite strength, which, in other times, had stood several regul: ur  
sieges, and had never been taken. How they got in has as yet  
been impossible to discover. ‘Those who pre tend to have been  
of the party tell so many different stories, as to destroy the credit  
of them all. They took all the arms, discharged the prisoners,  
and such of the garrison as were not killed in the first moment of  
fury, carried the Governor and Lieutenant Governor to the Greve  
(the place of public execution), cut off their heads, and sent them  
through the city in triumph to the Palais Royal. About the same  
instant, a treacherous correspondence having been discovered in  
Monsieur de Flesselles, Previt des Marchands, they seized him  
in the Hétel de Ville, where he was in the exercise of his office,

suilles, were the subject of two successive deputations from the  
States to the king, to both of which he cave dry and hard an-  
swers; for it has transpired, that it had been proposed and agi-  
tated in Council to seize on the principal members of the States  
General, to march the whole army down upon Paris, and to sup-  
press its tumults by the sword. But at night, the Duke de Lian-

in Paris. Ife went to bed deeply impressed. ‘The decapitation  
De Launai worked powertully through the night on the whole  
aristocratical party, in so much that, in the morning, those of the  
sreatest Influence on the Count d Artois represented to him the  
ibsolute necessity that the king should give up eve rything to the  
States. ‘his according well enough with the dispositions of the  
King, he went about eleven o’cloc! KX, accompanied only by his  
brothers, to the States-General, and there read to them a speech,  
in which he asked their mterposition to reestablish order. ‘Though  
this be couched in terms of some caution, yet the manner in which  
t was delivered made it evident that it was meant as a surrender  
it discretion. He returned to the Chateau aloot, accompanied  
by the States. ‘They sent off a deputation, the Marquis de la  
fayette at their head, to quiet Paris. Ile had, the saine morning,  
been named Commandant-in-Chief of the Milic Bourgevise, and  
Monsieur Bailly, former President of the States-General, was  
ealled for as Prévct des Marchands. The demolition of the  
Bastile was now ordered and begun. &lt;A body of the Swiss guards  
of the regiment of Ventimille, and the city horse-guards joined  
the people. ‘The alarm at Versailles increased instead of abating.

States-General vied with each other in declaring how sincerely  
th y were converted to the justice of voting by persons, and how  
letermined to go with the nation all its lengths. ‘The foreign  
troops were ordered off instantly. Every minister resigned. The  
king confirmed Bailly as Prévét des Marchands, wrote to Mr  
Necker to recall him, sent his letter open to the States-General,  
to be forwarded by them, and invited them to go with him to Paris  
the next day, to satisfy the city of his eg Ad ce that night

came to Paris, leaving the queen In consternation for his return,  
Omitting the less important figures of the procession. | will ony

Marquis de i Payette as Comimander-in-Clict, on horseback, and  
Bourveoi: prtettg belore and behind About sixty thousand citi-  
zens of all forms and colors, armed with the muskets of the Bastile  
  
and fuvalids, as -. as they would go, the rest with pistols, swords,  
pikes, pruning-hooks, scythes, @&amp;c., lined all the streets through  
which the procession passed, and, with the crowds of people in the  
streets, doors, and windows, saluted them every where with cries  
of View la Netion; but not a single Viee fe Roy was heard  
The king stopped at the /fotel de Ville. There Monsieur Bailly  
presented and put into his hat the popular eockade, and address &quot;1  
him. ‘The king being unprepared and unable to answer, aay  
went to him, gathered hon 1 him some scraps of sentences, and  
made out an answer, which he delivered to the ediduee’s as from  
the king. On their return, the popular cries were Vive le Roy et  
la Nution. tle was sondacwel by a Garde Bourzeoise to his  
palace at Versailles, and thus concluded such an amende honorabl  
as no sovereign ever made, and no people ever received. Letters  
written with his own hand to the Marquis de la Fayette remove  
the scruples of his position. “Tranquillity is now restored te the  
capital; the shops are again opened, the people resuming their  
labors, and if the want of bread does not disturb our peace, we  
may hope a continuance of it. The demolition of the Bastile is  
going on, and the MWilice Bourgeoise organizing and training.  
The ancient police of the city is abolished by the authority of th  
people, the introduction of the king’s tre Ops will probably be pro-  
scribed, and a watch or city guards substituted, which shall de-  
pend on the city alone. But we cannot suppose this paroxysin  
confined to Paris alone. ‘The whole country must pass succes-  
sively through it, and happy if they get through it as soon and as  
well as Sage has done.
