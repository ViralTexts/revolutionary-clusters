Address of the Senate to the President of the US. in answer to his Speech to both Houses of Congress  
Sir.  
We, the Senate of the United States, return you our sincere thanks for your excellent Speech deliver’d to both Houses of Congress:—congratulate you on the complete organization of the Federal Government:—and felicitate ourselves, and our fellow citizens on your elevation to the Office of President: an Office highly important  by the powers constitutionally annexed to it, and extremely honorable from the manner in which the appointment is made.—The unanimous suffrage of the elective body in your favor is peculiarly expressive of the gratitude confidence and affection of the Citizens of America. And is the highest testimonial at once of your merit and of their Esteem. We are sensible Sir, that nothing but the voice of your

f declining years.—We rejoice and with us all America, that, in obedience to the call of our common Country, you have return’d once more to public life.—In you all parties confide: in you all interests unite: and we have no doubt, that your past Services, great as they have been, will be equalld by your future exertions: and that your prudence and sagacity, as a Statesman will tend to avert the dangers to which we were expos’d, to give Stability to the present government. And Dignity and Splendor to that Country, which your Skill and Valour as a Soldier, so eminently contributed to raise to independance and Empire.  
When we contemplate the coincidence of circumstances and wonderful combination of Causes, which gradually prepar’d the people of their country for independance: when we contemplate the rise, progress and termination of the late War, which gave them existence among the nations of the Earth we are, with you, unavoidably led to acknowledge and adore the great Arbiter of the Universe, by whom empires rise and fall.—A review of the many signal instances of divine interposition in favor of this Country, claims our most pious Gratitude:—and permit us Sir! to observe that, among the great Events which have led to the formation and establishment of a Federal Government, we esteem your acceptance of the Office of President as one of the most propitious and important.  
In the execution of the trust reposed in us, we shall endeavor to pursue that enlarg’d and liberal policy, to which your Speech so happily directs.—We are conscious that the prosperity of each State is inseperably connected with the welfare of all, and that in promoting the latter, we shall effectually advance the former.—In full persuasion of this truth, it shall be our invariable aim to divest ourselves of local prejudices and attachments, and to view the great assemblage of communities and interests committed to our charge with an equall Eye.—We feel, Sir! the force, and acknowledge the justness of the observation, that the foundation  of our national policy should be laid in private morality:—if individuals be not influenced by moral principles, it is in vain to look for public virtue: it is, therefore the duty of Legislators to enforce, both by precept and example the utility as well as the necessity of a strict adherence to the rules of distributive justice.—We beg you, to be assured that the Senate will at all times cheerfully cooperate in every measure, which may strengthen the union, conduce to the Happiness, or secure and perpetuate the liberties of this great confederated Republic.  
We commend you Sir. to the protection of Almighty God, earnestly beseeching him long to preserve a Life so valuable and dear to the people of the United States. And that your administration may be prosperous to the Nation and glorious to yourself.  
In Senate May 16.  
Signd by Order Jno. Adamspresident of the Senate of the United States.  
To which the President was pleas’d to make the following reply. Gentlemen.  
I thank you for your address in which the most affectionate sentiments are express’d in the most obliging terms.—The coincidence of circumstances which led to this auspicious crisis, the confidence reposed in me by my fellow citizens, and the assistance I may expect from counsels which will be dictated by an enlargd and liberal policy seem to presage a more prosperous issue to my administration, than a diffidence of my abilities had taught me to anticipate.—I now feel myself inexpressibly happy in a belief that Heaven which has done so much for our infant Nation will not withdraw its providential influence before our political felicity shall

The War Department was agreed to be administered in a similar manner.
