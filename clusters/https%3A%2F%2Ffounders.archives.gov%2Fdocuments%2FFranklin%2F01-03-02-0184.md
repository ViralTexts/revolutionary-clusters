Dear Sir  
Philada. Feb. 13. 1749, 50  
You desire to know my Thoughts about the N.E. Storms beginning to Leeward. Some Years since there was an Eclipse of the Moon at 9 in the Evening, which I intended to observe, but before 8 a Storm blew up at N E. and continued violent all Night and all next Day, the Sky thick clouded, dark and rainy, so that neither Moon nor Stars could be seen. The Storm did a great deal of Damage all along the Coast, for we had Accounts of it in the News Papers from Boston, Newport, New York, Maryland and Virginia. But what surpriz’d me, was to find in the Boston Newspapers an Account of an Observation of that Eclipse made there: For I thought, as the Storm came from the N E. it must have begun sooner at Boston than with us, and consequently have prevented such Observation. I wrote to my Brother about it, and he inform’d me, that the Eclipse was over there, an hour before the Storm began. Since which I have made Enquiries from time to time of Travellers, and of my Correspondents N Eastward and S. Westward, and observ’d the Accounts in the Newspapers from N England, N York, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina, and I find it to be a constant Fact, that N East Storms begin to Leeward; and are often more violent there than farther to Windward. Thus the last October Storm, which with you was on the 8th. began on the 7th in Virginia and N Carolina, and was most violent there. As to the Reason of this, I can only give you my Conjectures. Suppose a great Tract of Country, Land and Sea, to wit Florida and the Bay of Mexico, to have clear Weather for several Days, and to be heated by the Sun and its Air thereby exceedingly rarified; Suppose the Country North Eastward, as Pensilvania, New England, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, &amp;c. to be at the same time cover’d with Clouds, and its Air chill’d and condens’d. The rarified Air being lighter must rise, and the Dense Air next to it will press into its Place; that will be follow’d by the next denser Air, that by the next, and so on. Thus when I have a Fire in my Chimney, there is a Current of Air constantly flowing from the Door to the Chimney: but the beginning of the Motion was at the Chimney, where the Air being rarified by the Fire, rising, its Place was supply’d by the cooler Air that was next to it, and the Place of that by the next, and so on to the Door. So the Water in a long Sluice or Mill Race, being stop’d by a Gate, is at Rest like the Air in a Calm; but as soon as you open the Gate at one End to let it out, the Water next the Gate begins first to move, that which is next to it follows; and so tho’ the Water proceeds forward to the Gate, the Motion which began there runs backwards, if one may so speak, to the upper End of the Race, where the Water is last in Motion. We have on this Continent a long Ridge of Mountains running from N East to S. West; and the Coast runs the same Course. These may, perhaps, contribute towards the Direction [of the winds or at least influence] them in some Degree, [missing]. If these Conjectures do not [satisfy you, I wish] to have yours on the Subject.  
I doubt not but those Mou[ntains which you mention contain valuable mines] which Time will discover. [I know of] but one valuable Mine in this [country] which is that of Schuyler’s in the Jerseys. [This yields good] Copper, and has turn’d out vast Wealth to the Owners. I was at it last Fall; but they were not then at Work; the Water is grown too hard for them; and they waited for a Fire Engine from England to drain their Pits; I suppose they will have that at Work next Summer; it costs them £1000 Sterling.  
Col. John Schuyler, one of the Owners, has a Deer Park 5 Miles round, fenc’d with Cedar Logs, 5 Logs high, with chocks of Wood between; it contains variety of Land high and Low, woodland and clear. There are a great many Deer in it; and he expects in a few Years to be able to kill 200 head a Year, which will be a profitable Thing. He has likewise 600 Acres of Meadow, all within Bank. The Mine is not far from Passaic Falls, which I went also to see. They are very curious: the Water falls 70 foot perpendicular, as we were told; but we had nothing to measure with. It [gives me great] Pleasure that your Sentiments [are in accord] with mine. I like your No[tion] [missing] ming; and tho’ perhaps it [missing] n prudent, as we are circumstanced] [missing] them in the Proposals; I doubt [not that they will] in time become Part of the [missing]. It will be agreable to you to hear, and therefore I inform you, that our Subscription goes on with great Success, and we suppose will exceed £5000 of our Currency: We have bought for the Academy, the House that was built for Itinerant Preaching, which stands on

3. Puivapevputia, Feb. 13, 1749.  
  
Dear Sir,  
  
You desire to know my thoughts about the N. E. storms  
beginning to leeward. Some years since there was an  
eclipse of the moon at 9 in the evening, which I intended to  
observe ; but before 8 a storm blew up at N. E. and contin-  
ued violent all night and all next day ; the sky thick clouded,  
dark and rainy, so that neither moon nor stars could be seen.  
The storm did a great deal of damage all along the coast, for  
we had accounts of it in the newspapers from Boston, New-  
port, New-York, Maryland and Virginia. But what surpri-  
sed me was to find in the Boston newspapers an account of  
an obervation of that eclipse made there: for I thought as  
the storm came from the N. E, it must have begun sooner  
at Boston than with us, and consequently have prevented  
such observation. I wrote to my brother about it, and he  
informed me that the eclipse was over there an hour before  
the storm began. Since which I have made enquiries from  
time to time of travellers and of my correspondents, north-  
eastward and south-westward, and observed the accounts in  
the newspapers from N. England, N. York, Maryland, Vir-  
ginia, and South-Carolina, and I find it to be a constant fact,  
that N. East storms begin to leeward, and are often more  
violent there than farther to windward. Thus the la

October storm, which with you was on the 8th, be-  
gan on the 7th in Virginia and N. Carolina, and was most vi-  
olent there. As to the reason of this, I can only give you  
my conjectures. Suppose a great tract of country, land and  
sea, to wit, Florida and the bay of Mexico, to have clear  
weather for several days, and to be heated by the sun, and  
its air thereby exceedingly rarefied : Suppose the country  
north-eastward, as Pennsylvania, New-England, Nova-Sco-  
tia, Newfoundland, &amp;c. to be at the same time covered with  
clouds, and its air chilled and condensed. The rarefied air  
being lighter must rise, and the dense air next to it will press  
into its place ; that will be followed by the next denser air,  
that by the next, and soon. Thus when I have a fire in  
my chimney, there is a current of air constantly flowing from  
the door to the chimney : but the beginning of the motion  
was at the chimney, where the air, being rarefied by the fire,  
rising, its place was supplied by the cooler air that was next  
to it, and the place of that by the next, and so on to the door.  
So the water in a long sluice or mill-race, being stopped by  
a gate, is at rest, like the air in a calm; but as soon as you  
open the gate at one end to let it out, the water next the  
gate begins first to move, that which is next to it follows; and  
so though the water proceeds forward to the gate; the mo-  
tion which begun there runs backwards, if one may so speak,  
to the upper end of the race, where the water is last in mo-  
tion. e have on this continent a long ridge of mountains,  
running from N. East to 5. West; and the coast runs the  
same course. These may, perhaps, contribute towards the  
direction of the winds or at least influence them in somede-  
gree. If these conjectures do not satisfy you, I wish to have  
yours on the subject.  
  
1 doubt not but those mountains which you mention con-  
tain valuable mines, which time will discover. I know of  
but one valuable copper mine in this country, which is that  
of Schuyler in the Jersies. This yields good copper, and  
has turned out vast wealth to the owners. I was at it last  
fall; but they were not then at work: the water is grown  
too hard for them, and they waited for a fire engine from  
England to drain their pits. I suppose they will have that  
at work next summer ; it costs them 1000/. sterling.  
  
Col. John Schuyler, one of the owners, has a deer park  
five miles round, fenced with cedar logs, five logs high, with

are very curious ; the water falls 70 feet perpendicular, as

respondent, dated Philadelphia, February 13th, 1749-50: “ You  
desire to know my thoughts about the northeast storms begin-  
ning to leeward. Some years since, there was an eclipse of the  
moon at nine o’clock in the evening, which I intended to observe;  
but before night a storm blew up at northeast, and continued  
violent all night and all the next day; the sky thick-clouded,  
dark and rainy, so that neither moon nor stars could be seen.  
The storm did great damage all along the coast, for we had  
accounts of it in the newspapers from Boston, Newport, New  
York, Maryland and Virginia; but what surprised me was, to  
find in the Boston newspapers an account of the observation of  
that eclipse made there; for I thought as the storm came from

the northeast, it must have begun sooner at Boston than with us,  
and consequently have prevented such an observation. I wrote  
to my brother about it, and he informed me that the eclipse was  
over there an hour before the storm began. Since which I have  
made inquiries from time to time of travellers, and observed the  
acecunts in the newspapers from New England, New York,  
Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina: and I find it to be a

parison.  
  
Suppose [he wrote] a great tract of country,  
land and sea, to wit, Florida and the Bay of  
Mexico, to have clear weather for several days,  
and to be heated by the sun, and its air thereby  
exceedingly rarefied. Suppose the country north-  
eastward, as Pennsylvania, New England, Nova  
Scotia, and Newfoundland, to be at the same time  
covered with clouds, and its air chilled and con-  
densed. The rarefied air being lighter must rise,  
and the denser air next to it will press into its  
place; that will be followed by the next denser air,  
that by the next, and so on. Thus, when I have  
a fire in my chimney, there is a current of air con-  
stantly flowing from the door to the chimney; but  
the beginning of the motion was at the chimney,  
where the air being rarefied by the fire rising, its  
place was supplied by the cooler air that was next  
to it, and the place of that by the next, and so on  
to the door. So the water in a long sluice or mill-  
race, being stopped by a gate, is at rest like the  
air in a calm; but as soon as you open the gate at  
one end to let it out, the water next the gate be-  
gins first to move, that which is next to it follows;  
and so, though the water proceeds forward to the  
gate, the motion which began there runs back-  
wards, if one may so speak, to the upper end of the  
race, where the water is last in motion.  
  
It was in 1746 that Franklin’s attention  
was first drawn to electricity. From a long  
period of neglect the subject had suddenly  
secured renewed attention by Gray’s experi-  
ments as to the conductivity of various sub-  
stances, and Dufay’s discovery of what h
