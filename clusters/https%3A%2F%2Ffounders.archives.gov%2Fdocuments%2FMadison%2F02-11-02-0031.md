[ante–8 January 1806]  
  
In times of peace among all nations, their commercial intercourse is under no other restrictions than what may be imposed by their respective laws, or their mutual compacts. No one or more nations can justly control the commerce between any two or more of the others.  
When war happens between any two or more nations, a question arises, in what respect it can affect the commerce of nations not engaged in the war?  
Between the nations not engaged in the war, it is evident that the commerce cannot be affected at all by a war between others.  
As a nation not engaged in the war remains in the same relations of amity and of commercial pursuits, with each of the belligerent nations, as existed prior to the war, it would seem that the war could not affect the intercourse between the neutral and either of the belligerent nations; and that the neutral nation might treat and trade with either, or both the belligerent nations, with the same freedom as if no war had arisen between them. This, as the general rule, is sufficiently established.  
But inasmuch as the trade of a neutral nation with a belligerent nation might, in certain special cases, affect the safety of its antagonist, usage, founded on the principle of necessity, has admitted a few exceptions to the general rule.  
Thus, all instruments of war, going into the hands of one belligerent nation, may be intercepted, on the high seas, by its adversary.  
In like manner, a neutral trade with a place actually besieged is liable to be interrupted by the besiegers.  
It is maintained also on one side, though strongly contested on the other, that the property of a nation at war, in a neutral ship, may be seized and condemned by the enemy of that nation.  
To these exceptions, Great Britain has undertaken to add another, as important as it is new. She asserts a right to intercept the trade of neutrals with her enemies, in all cases, where the trade, as it respects the ship, the cargo,  
  
or even the individual port of destination, was not as free before the war, as it is made during the war.  
In applying this doctrine, the British government and courts have not, as yet, extended it beyond the trade of neutrals on the coasts, and with the colonies of enemies. But it is manifest, that this limitation is founded in considerations of expediency only; and that the doctrine is necessarily applicable to every other branch of neutral commerce with a belligerent nation, which was not open to the same nation in time of peace. It might indeed with equal reason be extended farther. It might be applied to the case of a trade legally permitted to foreign nations in time of peace, but not actually carried on by them in time of peace; because in time of peace actually carried on by the nation itself; and which is taken up by foreign nations in time of war only, in consequence of the war, which, by increasing the risk or by finding other employment for the vessels and seamen of the nation itself, invites neutral traders into the deserted channels. In both cases, the neutral intervention may be said to result from the pressure of the war; and in both cases, the effect is the same to the belligerent; since in both, neutrals carry on for him, a trade auxiliary to his prosperity and his revenue, which he could no longer carry on for himself; and which at the same time, by liberating his naval faculties for the purposes of war, enable him to carry on the war, with more vigor and effect. These inferences cannot be impaired by any sound distinction, between a trade of foreigners with colonies, and a trade of foreigners with the ports of the mother country. Colonies, more especially when they are altogether subject to the same authority which governs the parent state, are integral parts of the same dominion or empire. A trade, therefore, between a colonial port and a port of the parent or principal state, is precisely of the same nature with a trade between one and another port of the latter: and a trade between a colony and a foreign port is, in like manner, precisely the same with the trade between a foreign port and the parent country; which is only a more considerable, as a colony may be a less considerable part, of the same country or empire. Previous to the late political union of Ireland with Great Britain, the relation between those two islands was strictly analogous to the relation between Great Britain and the West-Indies. Was any difference ever entertained between a coasting trade from a British to a British port, and a trade from a British to an Irish port; or between a trade from a foreign port to an Irish port, and a trade from a foreign to a British port? In the nature of things, and in the eye of foreign nations, the cases were the same. If any difference existed, it was merely circumstantial, such as may be incident to all cases essentially the same; or merely municipal, such as may result from those regulations of trade, which all sovereigns have an acknowledged right to make. It would not be unfair, therefore, in examining the doctrine asserted by Great Britain, to view it in the whole extent of which it is susceptible. But the latitude in which  
  
it is avowed, and carried into operation, sufficiently demands the serious attention of all nations; but more than any, that of the United States, whose commerce more than any is the victim to this belligerent pretension. To prepare the way for this examination, several remarks are to be premised.  
First. The general rule being, that the trade between a neutral and belligerent nation is as free as if the latter were at peace with all nations, and the cases in which it is not as free being exceptions to the general rule, the exceptions, according to a received maxim of interpretation, are to be taken strictly, against those claiming the benefit of the exceptions, and favorably for those claiming the benefit of the general rule.  
Secondly. The exceptions being founded on a principle of necessity, in opposition to ordinary right, the necessity ought to be evident and urgent. In proportion as the necessity may be doubtful, and still more, in proportion as the sacrifice of neutral interests would exceed the advantage to the belligerent, the exception fails.  
Thirdly. The progress of the law of nations, under the influence of science and humanity, is mitigating the evils of war, and diminishing the motives to it, by favoring the rights of those remaining at peace, rather than of those who enter into war. Not only are the laws of war tempered between the parties at war, but much also in relation to those at peace.  
Repeating then, that every belligerent right to controul neutral commerce must, as an exception to the general freedom of commerce, be positively and strictly proved, and the more strictly, as the exceptions are in a course of restriction rather than extension, the question is ready for examination, whether it be a part of the law of nations, that a trade ordinarily shut in time of peace, and opened to neutrals in time of war, on account of the war, is liable, as much as a trade in contraband of war or with a blockaded port, to capture and condemnation.  
It will not be overlooked, that the principle, as thus laid down, does not extend to any of the cases, where a new trade, though opened during a war, is not opened on account of the war, but on considerations which would produce the same measure, if no war existed: from which follows another important observation, that taking into view the probable occurrence of such considerations, the still greater probability of a mixture of such with considerations derived from the war, the impossibility of distinguishing the proportion of these different ingredients in the mixture, with the evident disadvantage of rendering more complicated, instead of simplifying, a rule of conduct between independent nations, to be expounded and enforced by one of the parties themselves, it would seem to require no great effort of candor, to acknowledge the powerful objection in practice, to such a principle, were it really embraced by the most specious theory.  
But without dwelling on this view of the subject, however just in itself, the principle in question will be tried:  
  
First—by the writings most generally received as the depositaries and oracles of the law of nations;  
Secondly—by the evidence of treaties;  
Thirdly—by the judgment of nations, other than Great Britain;  
Fourthly—by the conduct of Great Britain herself;  
Fifthly—by the reasoning employed in favor of the principle.  
First. The written authorities on this subject.  
It cannot be necessary to examine the historical fragments which have been gleaned by modern authors, as evidence of the usage and tenets of the civilized nations of antiquity. The great change which has taken place in the state of manners, in the maxims of war, and in the course of commerce, make it pretty certain, that either nothing would be found relating to the question, or nothing sufficiently applicable, to deserve attention in deciding it. There is but little hazard in saying, that in none of the learned collections, is a single fact presented, which countenances the British pretension; or even shews, that a single ancient nation asserted or acted on it.

f Pufendorf with respect to the question “whether we may hinder neutral nations from trading during the war with the enemy.” Groningius, it seems, having consulted Pufendorf on a treatise he had planned upon “free navigation,” received the following answer; which, having undergone much discussion, and as found in the English translation, seeming to glance at the British principle of intercepting a commerce opened to neutrals in time of war, is copied at full length, and receives an attention which would not otherwise be bestowed on it.  
“The work, sir, that you have in view, relating to the liberty of navigation, excites my curiosity. It is a curious subject, and what no person as yet, that I know of, has particularly handled. I very much however fear, if I may judge from your letter, that you will find people who will dispute your notions. The question is, certainly, one of those which have not yet been settled upon any clear or undeniable principles; so as to afford a general rule to mankind. In all the examples brought upon this subject, there is a mixture of right and fact. Each nation usually allows or forbids the maritime commerce of neutral people with its enemy, either according as it is its interest to preserve the friendship of those people, or it finds itself strong enough to obtain from them what it requires. For example, the English and Dutch may say, without absurdity, that it is lawful for them to do all the ill they can to the French, with whom they are at war; and consequently to employ the method the most proper to weaken them, which is to traverse and ruin their trade. They say it is not reasonable that neutral nations should enrich themselves at their expence; and by engrossing to themselves a commerce which the English and Dutch want, furnish the French with money to continue the war. This seems the rather just, because England and Holland commonly favor the trade of neutral nations, by suffering them to transport and sell in foreign markets merchandizes of their own growth and manufacture. In short, they say that they are willing to leave them the trade they usually carry on in time of peace; but they cannot see them take advantage of the war, to extend their commerce to the prejudice of England and Holland. But as this  
  
matter of trade and navigation does not so much depend upon rules founded on a general law, as upon conventions made between particular nations; so in order to form a solid judgment of the point in question, we ought previously to examine what treaties subsist between the northern crowns and England and Holland; and whether these last powers have offered the former just and reasonable conditions. On the other hand, nevertheless, if the northern princes can maintain their trade with France, by sending strong convoys with their fleets, I see nothing to blame in it, provided their vessels do not carry contraband goods. The laws of humanity and equity between nations do not extend so far as to require, without any apparent necessity, that one people should give up its profit in favor of another. But as the avarice of merchants is so great that for the smallest gain they make no scruple of exceeding the just bounds of commerce; so nations that are at war may certainly visit neutral ships, and, if they find prohibited goods on board, have a full right to confiscate them. Besides I am no way surprised that the northern crowns have a greater regard to the general interest of Europe, than to the complaints of some greedy merchants who care not how matters go, provided they can satisfy their thirst of gain. These princes wisely judge that it is not at all convenient for them to take precipitate measures, while other nations unite all their forces to reduce within bounds an insolent and exorbitant power, which threatens Europe with slavery, and the protestant religion with destruction. This being the interest of the northern crowns, it is neither just nor necessary, that for a present advantage, they should interrupt so salutary a design, especially as they are at no expence in the affair and run no hazard,” &amp;c.

consideration.  
As the basis of the true doctrine, on the subject of neutral commerce, he lays down these principles:  
  
That a neutral nation is bound to an exact impartiality;  
That this impartiality relates solely to the war;  
That it includes two obligations: the first forbidding succours in troops, not stipulated before the war, arms, ammunition, or any thing of direct use in the war; the second, requiring that in whatever does not relate to the war, one of the parties must not be refused, on account of its present quarrel, what is granted to the other. He observes “that this does not trespass on the liberty of the neutral nation, in negotiations, connexions of friendship, or its trade, to govern itself by what is most advantageous to the state. When this consideration induces it to preferences in things of which every one has the free disposal, it only makes use of its right, and is not chargeable with partiality. But to refuse any one of these things, to one of the parties, purely as being at war with the other, and for favoring the latter, would be departing from an exact neutrality.”

hey should secure their neutrality by treaties for the purpose, he proceeds to state more particularly;  
1st. “That whatever a nation does in use of its own rights, and solely with a view to its own good, without partiality, without a design of favoring one power to the prejudice of another, cannot, in general, be considered as contrary to neutrality; and becomes such, only upon particular occasions, when it cannot take place without injury to one of the parties, who has then a particular right to oppose it. Thus, the besieger has a right to prohibit access to the place besieged. Exclusively of this kind of cases, the quarrels of another cannot deprive me of the free disposal of my rights in the pursuit of measures which I judge advantageous to my country.” Hence he infers a right to permit, in certain cases, levies of troops to one of the parties, and to deny it to the other, where there may be good reason for the distinction; and where it is the custom, as among the Swiss, to grant levies; and, consequently, where, the custom would of itself be a proof that the grant was not the effect of partiality in relation to the war.

 observing, that “whilst it appears that this nation lends out its money purposely for improving it by interest, it is at liberty to dispose of it according to its own discretion, and I have no reason to complain. But if the loan be manifestly for enabling the enemy to attack me, this would be concurring in the war against me.” He applies the same remark to the case of troops furnished to an enemy, by the state itself, at its own expence; and of money lent without interest: adding, at the same time, as a further instance of neutral rights, that if a nation trades in arms, timber, ships, military stores, &amp;c.

[suivre tout uniment leur commerce] they do not thereby declare themselves against my interest; they only exercise a right, which they are under no obligation of sacrificing to me.”  
The general freedom of neutral commerce, being thus asserted, the writer goes on to lay down the exceptions which war makes to it.  
“On the other hand, whenever I am at war with a nation, both my safety and welfare prompt me to deprive it as much as possible of every thing which may enable it to resist or hurt me. Here the law of necessity shews its force. If this law warrants me on occasion to seize what belongs to another, shall it not likewise warrant me to stop every thing relative to war, which neutral nations are carrying to my enemy. Even if I should, by taking such measures, render all these neutral nations my enemies, I had better run the hazard than suffer him who is actually at war to be thus freely supplied to the great increase of his power. It is therefore very proper and very suitable to the law of nations which disapproves of multiplying the causes of war, not to consider those seizures of the goods of neutral nations as acts of hostility. When I have notified to them my declaration of war against such or such a people, if they will afterwards run the risk of supplying them with things relative to war, let them not complain if their goods fall into my hands, for I do not declare war against them, because they attempted to carry such  
  
goods. They suffer indeed by a war in which they have no concern, but it is accidentally. I do not oppose their right, I only make use of my own, and if our rights clash, and reciprocally injure each other, it flows from the effect of inevitable necessity,” &amp;c.  
“But that limits may be set to these inconveniences; that the commerce of neutral nations may subsist in all the freedom which the laws of war will admit, there are rules to be observed, and on which Europe seems to be generally agreed.”  
What are the rules which fix these limits?  
“The first is carefully to distinguish common goods which have no relation to war, from those peculiarly subservient to it. In the trade of the former neutral nations are to enjoy an entire liberty, the parties at war cannot with any reason deny it, or hinder the importation of such goods into the enemy’s country,” &amp;c. He observes that the goods here referred to, as having relation to war, are those called contraband, of which he gives a description; proceeding thence to shew how

t the authority of Martens is clear and full.  
He speaks first of neutral commerce according to the universal law of nations, and next of the modern law of nations with respect to neutral commerce, and its freedom, as acknowledged by the powers of Europe.  
The first he lays down as follows: “The right that a nation enjoys in time of peace of selling and carrying all sorts of merchandize to every nation who chooses to trade with it, it enjoys also in time of war, provided that it remains neuter.” He admits at the same time that necessity may authorize a power at war to hinder the conveyance of warlike stores to its enemies, so far as to sequester them till the end of the war, or to take them at their full value for his own use.  
* This rule corresponds with the sentiments of Grotius.  
He admits again that the power at war may prohibit all commerce with such places “as he is able to keep so blocked up as to prevent any foreigner from entering.” But he maintains that “since a belligerent power cannot exercise hostilities in a neutral place, nor confiscate property belonging to neutral subjects, such power ought not to confiscate the goods of an enemy found in a neutral vessel navigating on a free or neutral sea,  
  
nor neutral goods found in the vessel of an enemy: provided, however, in both cases that these goods are not warlike stores.”  
In explaining what he stiles the modern law of nations with respect to neutral commerce, and its liberty as acknowledged by the powers of Europe, he states it “as generally acknowledged that a neutral power ought not to transport to either of the belligerent powers merchandizes unequivocally intended for warlike purposes, that treaties have at sometimes swelled out this list with articles not evidently and unequivocally intended for such purposes; at others have expressly declared these not to be contraband, and that this last ought to be presumed to be the case between powers having no treaties on the subject.”  
“With respect to merchandizes which are not contraband” he says, “it is generally acknowledged by the powers of Europe, that neutral powers have a right to transport them to the enemy,

except it be to places blockaded, with which all commerce is prohibited.”  
These two exceptions, namely contraband of war, and the case of blockaded or besieged places, are the only ones which he allows against the freedom of neutral commerce. For with respect to enemy’s property in neutral ships, he considers the new principle which identifies the cargo with the vessel, and thereby avoids the disputes and embarrassments arising from the old principle, as having been sufficiently established to take the place of the old one in the law of nations.  
The authority of Martens, then, unequivocally and undeniably concurs with that of his great predecessors, in deciding that the commerce between neutral and belligerent nations, with a very few exceptions, is entirely free, and that these exceptions do not include any such pretension as that of Great Britain, to prohibit a trade otherwise lawful, merely because it might have been laid open to neutrals in consequence of the war.  
It would have been easy to add to the authorities here selected, other respectable jurists within the same period; as well as a phalanx of authorities of later date, both in the South and the North of Europe; but the testimony of Grotius, of Pufendorf, of Bynkershoek, of Vattel, and of Martens, is more than sufficient for the occasion. They are the luminaries and oracles, to whom the appeal is generally made by nations, who prefer an appeal to  
  
law, rather than to power; an appeal which is made by no nation more readily than by Great Britain, when she has sufficient confidence in the justice of her cause.

TREATIES  
  
All writers on the law of nations, as well didactic as polemic, avail themselves, whenever they can, of the authority of Treaties.  
Treaties may be considered under several relations to the law of nations, according to the several questions to be decided by them.  
They may be considered as simply repeating or affirming the general law: they may be considered as making exceptions to the general law, which are to be a particular law between the parties themselves: they may be considered as explanatory of the law of nations, on points where its meaning is otherwise obscure or unsettled; in which case they are, first, a law between the parties themselves, and next, a sanction to the general law, according to the reasonableness of the explanation, and the number and character of the parties to it: lastly, Treaties may be considered as constituting a voluntary or positive law of nations.  
Whether the stipulations in a treaty are to be considered as an affirmance, or an exception, or an explanation, may sometimes appear on the face of the treaty: sometimes being naked stipulations, their character must be determined by resorting to other evidences of the law of nations. In other words, the question concerning the treaty must be decided by the law, not the question concerning the law by the treaty.

ered.  
  
  
In the present case, it has been shewn, from the sources generally allowed to be the most authentic, that the law of nations is violated by the principle asserted by Great-Britain. It is a just inference, therefore, that every article in treaties contradicting that principle, is an affirmance and direct proof of the general law; and that any stipulation of the principle would, as an exception to the general law, be an indirect proof of it.  
But supposing, for a moment, the present case to belong to that class, in which the great oracles of the law of nations are obscure, or at variance among themselves; and in which, moreover, the practice of nations, not being uniform, is an unsatisfactory guide; and consequently, that the evidence of treaties were necessary in order to ascertain the law; still, it will be found that the result of an appeal to that evidence is conclusive against the British pretension. It may be confidently affirmed, that on no point ever drawn into question, the evidence of Treaties was more uniform, more extensive, or more satisfactory.  
Nay more; it may be affirmed that the treaties applicable to this case may fairly be considered in their relation to the law of nations last noticed; that is, as constituting a law of themselves. If, in any case, Treaties can be sufficiently general, sufficiently uniform, and of sufficient duration, to attest that general and settled concurrence of nations in a principle or rule of conduct among themselves, which amounts to the establishment of a general law; such an effect cannot reasonably be refused to the number and character of the treaties which are applicable to the present case.  
That Treaties may amount to a law of nations, follows from the very definition of that law; which consists of those rules of conduct which reason deduces, as consonant to justice and common good, from the nature of the society existing among independent nations; with such definitions and modifications as may be established by general consent.  
One evidence of general consent is general usage, which implies general consent.  
Can treaties which express consent be an inferior evidence, where nothing on the face of the treaties, nor in any collateral authority on the law of nations is found to impair the evidence?  
Treaties may indeed in one point of view be considered as a higher authority than usage, when they have a generality and continuance, equal to the generality and continuance which give to usage the authority of law; because all treaties involve a usage commensurate with the sphere in which they are obligatory. Whilst usage, therefore, implies consent; treaties imply the usage, at the same time that they express the consent of the parties to them.  
* Bynkershoek derives the law of nations from reason and usage [ex ratione et usu] and founds usage on the evidence of treaties and decrees [pactis et edictis.] He therefore makes treaties a legitimate source of the law of nations, and constantly adduces them to illustrate and verify his doctrines. Quest. Jur. Pub. Lib. I. C. X.  
  
  
But there is another point of view in which the influence of treaties, those at least of peace and of commerce, in modifying and defining the rules of public law applicable to periods of war, ought, in preference to the influence of mere practice, to be promoted by all governments which respect justice and humanity, and by all jurists who aspire to the authority of commentators on that subject.  
The law of nations, as derived from mere usage or practice during those periods, is evidenced for the most part by ex parte ordinances, issued by belligerent governments, in the midst of the passions or policy of war; and by judicial decisions, also ex parte, and biassed more or less by the same causes, if not by the interest also, which weighty individuals, or perhaps bodies of individuals have, in widening the field of predatory wealth.  
Treaties are formed under very different circumstances. Those of peace imply that the hostile passions and pursuits have spent their force, and that a neutral spirit of liberality and accommodation have taken their place: Treaties of commerce again are necessarily founded in principles of reciprocal justice and interest, wholly at variance with the violent spirit of war: whilst in the negociation of treaties of both kinds the respective efforts and interests of the parties form those mutual checks, require those mutual concessions, and involve those mutual appeals to a moral standard of right, which are most likely to make both parties converge to a just and reasonable conclusion. Nor is a sense of character without its effect on such occasions. Nations would not stipulate in the face of the world things, which each of them would separately do, in pursuit of its selfish objects.  
It will accordingly be found, as might be expected, that the violent and cruel maxims of war, those still remaining, as well as those from time to time exploded, have had their origin and their continuance in the separate usages of belligerent nations, not in treaties; whilst on the other hand, it will be found that the reformation of those abuses has been the gradual work of treaties; that the spirit of treaties is, with few, if any exceptions, at all times more just, more rational and more benevolent, than the spirit of the law derived from practice only; and consequently, that all further meliorations of the code of public law, are to be expected from the former, not the latter source; and consequently, again, that all enlightened friends to the happiness of nations ought to favor the influence of treaties on the great code by which their intercourse is to be regulated.  
The authority of every treaty is to be considered as opposed to the principle asserted by Great Britain, where it either stipulates a general freedom of neutral commerce with a specification of exceptions to it, and an omission of this British exception; or where it stipulates not only a neutral right generally to a free trade with belligerent nations, but particularly a right to trade freely to and between the ports of such nations. These stipulations, by  
  
the force of the terms, necessarily comprehend the coasting and colonial trades, as well as other branches of commerce.  
It would be a waste of time to bestow it on the treaties of a remote period, partaking too little of the civilization and spirit of more modern times, to edify them by its examples. It will be sufficient to commence this review with the treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which forms an important epoch in the commercial and political history of Europe, and to remark as the result of some enquiry into antecedent treaties, that they contain nothing which can give the least countenance to the principle under examination.  
It will be sufficient also to limit the review of treaties, where Great Britain was not a party, to those of most importance, either for the tenor of the stipulations, or for the particular parties to them, with marginal references to others of analogous import; remarking again generally, that these others are all, either negatively or positively, authorities against Great Britain.  
As a more convenient distribution also, the first review will stop with the epoch of the armed neutrality. The relation, which the treaties subsequent to that event have to the subject, will be noticed by itself.  
  
Examples to which Great Britain is not a party.  
By a treaty concerning navigation and commerce in 1650, preceded by a particular article on the same subject concluded in 1648, it is stipulated between the United Provinces and Spain, “that the subjects and inhabitants of the United Provinces (and those of Spain reciprocally) may sail and trade with all freedom and safety in all the kingdoms, states and countries which are or shall be in peace, amity, or neutrality, with the state of the said United Provinces; and that they shall not be disquieted or molested in this liberty by the ships or subjects of the King of Spain, upon the account of hostilities which may exist, or may happen afterwards, between the said King of Spain and the aforesaid kingdoms, countries and states, or any of them that may be in amity or neutrality with the said lords the states as above.”  
* Dumont. Tom. vi. part 1. p. 570.  
  
This liberty, in relation to France, was to extend to all sorts of merchandize which might be carried thither before she was at war with Spain; even contraband of war,  
† This is not a solitary instance of such a stipulation. Another is found in the treaty of 1661, between the United Provinces and Portugal, where it was made a general right of the neutral party to carry contraband to countries at war with the other party. Dum. vol. vi. p. 2, 368. Azuni refers to other instances: a treaty between Edward 4 and the Duke of Burgundy in 1468—England and Portugal 1642 and 1654—Spain and the Hanse Towns 1647. Azuni vol. 2. p. 145, of the French translation.  
not proceeding from the states of Spain herself, and capable of being used against the Spanish dominions.  
  
With respect to other countries at peace with the United Provinces, and at war with Spain, the enumerated articles of contraband were not to be carried to them by the United Provinces, but all articles not contraband were to be freely carried, with the exception only of cities and places invested or blockaded.  
The Pyrenean treaty, between France and Spain in 1659, established so close a friendship between the two nations, that they were mutually restrained from giving either of them to those attacking the other, any assistance in men, money, or victuals, or with passage through his dominions. Yet it is stipulated in art. x.—xvi. which are reciprocal, that the French shall have liberty to trade to all parts whatsoever, though they should be in a war with his Catholic Majesty, excepting Portugal,  
* Portugal was at that time engaged in a war with Spain for the establishment of her independence, which was viewed by Spain as a rebellious war, and which France was willing, it seems, so far to regard in the same light as to acquiesce in this exception.  
whilst it continued in the condition it then was in; all merchandize may be transported to other countries in war with Spain, as was allowed before the said war, excepting  
† This exception might have been made by Spain herself as a municipal regulation.  
such as proceed from the Spanish dominions, and as may be serviceable against the Catholic King or his dominions, and contraband goods. By contraband goods are understood all sorts of arms and warlike stores; but corn and all manner of provision and goods, not being arms and warlike stores, are not reputed contraband, and they may be carried to places in war with Spain, excepting to Portugal and blockaded places. The French vessels, passing from the ports of Spain to any port in enmity with that crown, shall not be in any way retarded or molested, after producing their passes, specifying their lading.  
‡ Dum. Tom. 6. part 2, page 266.  
  
It here appears, that the parties were at liberty, when neutral, to trade to all parts of a belligerent country, not blockaded, and in all merchandizes not contraband.  
The expression “as was allowed before the said war,” in this and in the preceding examples, clearly fall within the observations made on the like expressions, used by the writers on the law of nations. They are merely a mode of describing the indefinite right to trade, as if no war had arisen, and consequently to enter into any new channels of trade which might be opened to them.  
In a treaty in 1662, between France and the United Provinces, it is stipulated, Art. xxvi–xxvii. &amp;c. that the parties reciprocally are to trade and navigate with all freedom and safety to countries respectively at war with one and at peace with the other, without any exceptions made by the treaty, other than a trade in contraband, or to a place blockaded.  
§ Dumont. Tom. 6, part. 2, p. 414.  
  
  
The treaty between France and the United Provinces, Art. xxvii–xxix, as incorporated with the treaty of Breda in 1667, between the latter power and England, declares that the subjects of either party may sail and traffic in all countries at any time, in peace with one and at war with the other, and this transportation and traffic shall extend to all articles not contraband, and to all places not blockaded.  
* Chalmers collect. treaties, vol. 1, p. 154. Dumont. Tom: 7 part 1, p. 49.  
  
In a treaty in 1672, between France and Sweden, Arts. xxiii–xxix, are of corresponding import.  
† Dumont, Tom. 7, part 1, p. 169.  
  
A treaty in 1675, between Sweden and the United Provinces, contains like stipulations in the three first and following articles.  
‡ Dum. Tom. 7, part 1, p. 317.  
  
A declaration made in 1676, by Spain and the United Provinces, confirming the treaty of 1650, stipulates the right of either party to trade with the enemy of the other, as well directly as between enemy’s ports, whether the ports belong to the same or different enemies, contraband goods and places blockaded being excepted.  
§ Dum. Tom. 7, part 1, p. 325.  
  
In Art. xiii. &amp;c. of another treaty in 1678, between France and the United Provinces, the same points are again stipulated.  
¶ Dum. Tom. 7, part 1, p. 359.  
  
The xiii. Art. of another treaty in 1679, between Sweden and the United Provinces, contains a like stipulation.  
**Dum. Tom. 7, part 1. p. 439.  
  
So again the like stipulation is contained in Art. xiii. of another treaty in 1679, between France and the United Provinces.  
††Dum. Tom. 7, part 1. p. 359.  
  
In a treaty in 1701, between Denmark and the United Provinces, the stipulations import an uninterrupted commerce of the neutral with an enemy of the other party, with the usual exception of contraband.  
‡‡Dum. Tom. viii. part 1, p. 35.  
  
The like stipulation is found in a treaty of 1716, Art. viii, between France and the Hanse Towns.  
§§Azuni, vol. ii. p. 130.  
  
A treaty, Art. vi, between the Emperor Charles VI. and Philip V. of Spain, May 1, 1725, is of like import.  
¶ ¶Dum. Tom. 8, part 2, p. 115, Azuni vol. 2, p. 124.  
  
The same is the language of a treaty in 1752, between Naples and Holland.  
* **Azuni, vol. 2, p. 131.

between France and the Duke of Mecklenburg in 1779, maintain the same doctrine.  
* Martens treaties, vol. 1, p. 255, vol. 2, p. 38.  
  
To these authorities derived from the conventional law of Europe, against the British principle under investigation,  
† The list, however, would not extend to the period between 1738 and 1761; no general collection of treaties to which Great Britain is not a party, during that period, being at hand. The chasm is of the less moment, as the British treaties of that period embrace most of the other maritime nations of Europe.  
might be added, if it were necessary, references to other treaties of the like tenor.  
  
  
Treaties to which England first, and then Great-Britain, was a party.  
By a treaty with Sweden, in 1654, and another in 1656, confirming and explaining the former, it is stipulated, Art. II—IV. that it shall be lawful for the subjects of either of the confederates to trade with the enemies of the other; and, without impediment, to carry to them, except to places blockaded or besieged, any goods whatsoever not contraband, of which a specification is inserted. Provision is also made for the efficacy of passports in certain cases, and against the abuse of them for covering enemies’ property.  
‡ Chalmers, vol. i. p. 32–3.  
  
The weight of these examples is not diminished by the name of Cromwell, under whose authority the treaties were concluded in behalf of England. In foreign transactions, as well as at home, his character was distinguished by a vigor not likely to relinquish or impair rights, in which his country, as a warlike and maritime power, was interested.  
On the other hand, it adds weight to the examples, that they are treaties of alliance, containing mutual engagements of friendship and assistance; and, consequently, the less apt to indulge the parties in an intercourse with the enemies of each other, beyond the degree required by the law of nations. This observation is applicable to all the succeeding examples, where the treaties are of the same kind.  
On the restoration of Charles II. a treaty of alliance was concluded with Sweden in 1661, the XI. article of which, in pursuance of those above copied from the treaties of 1654 and 1656, stipulates anew, that neither party shall be impeded in carrying to the enemies of the other, any merchandize whatever, with the exceptions only of articles of contraband, and of ports or places besieged.  
§ Chalm. vol. i. p. 52.  
  
In a treaty with Spain, May 13, 1667, the articles XXI–XXVI. import, that the subjects of each shall trade freely in all Kingdoms, estates, and countries at war with the other, in all merchandizes not contraband; with no other exception of places but those besieged or blockaded.  
¶ 2 Chalm. 17–19.  
  
  
In July, 1667, a treaty was concluded with the United Provinces, of which Art. III. provisionally adopts certain articles from the treaty of Breda, between the United Provinces and France, on the subject of maritime commerce; until a fuller treaty could be perfected between the parties. The articles adopted, in relation to the trade between the subjects of one of the parties and the enemies of the other, declare that the trade shall extend, without impediment, to all articles not contraband, and to all places not besieged or blockaded.  
* Chalm. vol. i. p, 154.  
  
In February, 1667–8 the same parties, then under a perpetual defensive alliance by virtue of a treaty of 21st July, 1667, and in a league moreover with Sweden by the triple league of 1668, resumed the subject of maritime and commercial affairs, and repeated, in the first article of their treaty, the precise stipulations adopted provisionally from the treaty between France and the United Provinces.  
† Chalm. vol. i. p. 163.  
  
A treaty with Denmark, in 1669, stipulates, that they may trade each with the enemies of the other, in all articles not contraband, and to all places not blockaded, without any other exceptions.  
‡ Dum. Tom. 7. part i. p. 126.  
  
On the 11th July, 1670, another treaty of alliance was concluded with Denmark, the XVI. Art. of which declares that “neither of the parties shall be impeded in furnishing to the enemies of the other any merchandizes whatever; excepting only articles of contraband, as described in the treaty, and ports and places besieged by the other.”  
§ Chalm. vol. i. p. 85.  
  
It is worthy of notice in this treaty, and the remark is applicable to others, that the V. Art having stipulated a right mutually to trade in the kingdoms, provinces, marts, towns ports, and rivers of each other, it was immediately provided in the next article, that prohibited ports and colonies should be excepted. If it had been conceived that such ports or colonies of enemies were not to be traded with, under the general right to trade with enemies acknowledged in the XVI. article, it is manifest that they would have been as carefully excepted in this, as in the other case, out of the meaning of general terms equally comprehending them. This treaty proves also, that as early as 1670, colonies began to fall under attention in making treaties.  
In a marine treaty of December 1, 1674, with the United Provinces, stating in the title that it was “to be observed throughout all and every the countries and ports of the world by sea and land,” it is stipulated again, in Art. I. to be “lawful for all and every the subjects of the most serene and mighty prince, the King of Great-Britain, with all freedom and safety to sail, trade, and exercise any manner of traffic in all those kingdoms, countries, and estates,  
  
which are, or any time hereafter shall be in peace, amity, or neutrality with his said majesty; so that they shall not be any ways hindered or molested in their navigation or trade, by the military forces, nor by the ships of war, or any kind of vessels whatsoever, belonging either to the High and Mighty States General of the United Netherlands, or to their subjects, upon occasion or pretence of any hostility or difference which now is, or shall hereafter happen between the said Lords the States General, and any princes or people whatsoever, in peace, amity, or neutrality with his said majesty”; and so reciprocally.  
Art. ii. “Nor shall this freedom of navigation and commerce be infringed by occasion or cause of any war, in any kind of merchandizes, but shall extend to all commodities which may be carried in time of peace, those only excepted which follow in the next article, and are comprehended under the name of contraband.”  
Art. iii. enumerates the articles of contraband.  
Art. iv. contains a negative list, which, with all other articles not expressly included in the list of contraband, may be freely transported and carried to places under the obedience of enemies,

except only towns or places besieged, environed, or invested.  
† Chalm. vol, i. p. 177–179.  
  
This recital has been made the more minute, because it is necessary, in order to understand the whole force of the explanatory declaration between the parties bearing the same date; a document so peculiarly important in the present discussion, that its contents will be recited with equal exactness.  
This document, after stating “that some difficulty had arisen concerning the interpretation of certain articles, as well in the treaty marine concluded this first day of December, 1674, as in that which was concluded the 17th February 1667–8 between his majesty of Great-Britain on the one part, and the states general, &amp;c. on the other part,” proceeds to state “that sir William Temple, &amp;c. on one part with eight commissioners on the other, have declared, and do by these presents declare, that the true meaning and intention of the said articles is, and ought to be, that ships and vessels belonging to the subjects of either of the parties, can and might, from the time that the said articles were concluded, not only pass, traffic and trade, from  
  
a neutral port or place, to a place in enmity with the other party, or from a place in enmity to a neutral place, but also from a port or place in enmity to a port or place in enmity with the other party, whether the said places belong to one and the same prince or state, or to several princes or states, with whom the other party is in war. And we declare that this is the true and genuine sense and meaning of the said articles; pursuant whereunto we understand that the said articles are to be observed and executed on all occasions, on the part of his said majesty, and the said states general, and their respective subjects; yet so that this declaration shall not be alleged by either party for matters which happened before the conclusion of the late peace in the month of February, 1673–4.  
* Chalm. v. i. p. 189.  
  
Prior to the peace, neither of them could claim the rights of neutrality against the other.  
This declaratory stipulation has been said to be peculiarly important. It is so for several reasons:  
1st. Because it determines the right of the neutral party, so far as may depend on the belligerent party, to trade not only between its own ports and those of the enemies of the belligerent party, without any exception of colonies, but between any other neutral port and enemies ports, without exception of colonial ports of the enemy; and moreover, not only between the ports, colonial as well as others, of one enemy and another enemy, but between the different ports of the same enemy; and consequently between one port and another of the principal country; between these and the ports of its colonies; between the ports of one colony and another, and even to carry on the coasting trade of any particular colony.  
2d. Because it fixes the meaning not only of the articles in the two specified treaties; but has the same effect on all other stipulations by Great-Britain, expressed in the same on equivalent terms; one or other of which are used in most, if not all her treaties on this subject.  
3d. Because it made a part of the treaties explained, that free ships should make free goods; and consequently, the coasting and colonial trade, when combined with that neutral advantage, was the less likely to be acknowledged, if not considered as clearly belonging to the neutral party.  
4th. Because the explanatory article was the result of the   
† See sir William Temple’s correspondence with his government, vol. 4, p. 55, of his works, where the success of his efforts, made with the sanction of his government, is particularly rehearsed.  
solicitation of England herself, and she actually claimed and enjoyed the benefit of the article, she being at the time in peace, and the Dutch in war with France.  
‡ See memorial of Dutch merchants in the Annual Register for 1778. These treaties remained in force for more than a century, viz. from 1674 to the war with the United Provinces in 1781.  
  
  
In the treaty with France, February 24, 1677, articles I, II, and III, import that each party may trade freely with the enemies of the other, with the same merchandize as in time of peace, contraband goods only excepted, and that all merchandizes not contraband, “are free to be carried from any port in neutrality, to the port of an enemy, and from one port of an enemy to another; towns besieged, blocked up or invested, only excepted.”  
* Jenkinson vol. 1, p. 209.  
  
In 1689, England entered into the convention with Holland, prohibiting all neutral commerce with France, then the enemy of both.  
† Id. vol. 1, p. 209.  
In consequence of the counter treaty of Sweden and Denmark, for defending their neutral rights against this violent measure, satisfaction was made, according to Vattel, for the ships taken from them; without the slightest evidence, as far as can be traced, that any attempt was made by either of the belligerent parties, to introduce the distinction between such part of the trade interrupted, as might not have been allowed before the war, and as was therefore unlawful, and such part as having been allowed before the war, might not lawfully be subject to capture.  
We are now arrived at the treaties of Utrecht, an epoch so important in the history of Europe, and so essentially influencing the conventional law of nations, on the subject of neutral commerce.  
The treaty of navigation and commerce, March 31, 1713, between Great-Britain and France, article XVII, imports, that all the subjects of each party shall sail with their ships with all manner of liberty and security, no distinction being made who are the proprietors of the merchandizes laden thereon, {“}from any port, to the places of those who now are, or shall hereafter be, at enmity with the queen of Great-Britain and the christian king,” and “to trade with the same liberty and security from the places, ports and havens of those who are enemies of both or of either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforementioned to neutral places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of the same prince or under several.”  
Art. xviii. “This liberty of navigation and commerce, shall extend to all kind of merchandizes, excepting those only which follow in the next article, and which are specified by the name of contraband.”  
Art. xix, gives a list of contraband which is limited to warlike instruments.  
Art. xx, specifies others, many of which are in other treaties on the list of contraband, declaring that these with all other goods, not in the list of contraband in the preceding article, “may be carried and transported in the freest manner by the subjects of both confederates, even to places  
  
belonging to an enemy, such towns or places being only excepted as are at that time, besieged, blocked up round about, or invested.”  
* Chalm. v. i. p. 390.  
  
Could the principle maintained against Great-Britain be more clearly laid down, or more strongly fortified by her sanction?  
To give to this example the complete effect which it ought to have, several remarks are proper.  
In the first place, on comparing the description given of the free trade, which might be carried on between the neutral party and an enemy of the other party, with the description of the free trade allowed between the parties themselves, by the 1st article of the treaty, it appears that in order to except the colonial trade in the latter case, the freedom stipulated in article I, is expressly limited to Europe. The terms are, “that there shall be a reciprocal and entirely perfect liberty of navigation and commerce between the subjects on each part, through all and every the kingdoms, states, dominions of their royal majestyies in Europe.” In the stipulation relating to the neutral commerce of either with the enemy of the other (who, if a maritime enemy, could not fail to possess colonies out of Europe) the terms are, “that all merchandizes, not contraband, may be carried in the freest manner to places belonging to an enemy, such towns or places only being excepted, as are at that time besieged or blockaded, &amp;c.” without any limitation to Europe, or exception of colonies any where. It is obvious, that the terms here used comprehend all colonies, as much as the terms in the first article would have done, if colonies had not been excepted by limiting the freedom of trade to places “in Europe”; and consequently that if any distinction between the colonial and other places of an enemy, had been contemplated in the neutral trade of either party with him, as it was contemplated between the colonies and European possessions of the parties in their commerce to be carried on between themselves, the distinction would have been expressed in the latter case, as it was in the former; and not being so expressed, the trade in the latter case was to be as free to the colonies, as it would have been in the former, if the colonies had not been excepted by the limitation of the trade to Europe.  
† There are other treaties to which this reasoning is applicable.  
  
Secondly. But the treaty not content with this necessary construction, in favor of a neutral commerce with the colonies of an enemy, proceeds, in conformity to the example in the declaratory convention between England and Holland in 1674, explicitly to declare the freedom of the neutral party, to trade not only from any port, to the places of an enemy, and from the places of an enemy to neutral places, but also from one place to another place belonging to an enemy, whether the places be under the same or different sovereigns. Here both the coasting trade and the colonial trade, which, in  
  
relation to the parent country, is in the nature of a coasting trade, are both placed on the same footing with every other branch of commerce between neutral and belligerent parties, although it must have been well known, that both those branc{h}es are generally shut to foreigners in time of peace, and if opened at all, would be opened in time of war, and for the most part, on account of the war.  
Thirdly. It is well known, that this particular treaty underwent great opposition and discussion, both without and within the British parliamet and that it was for some time, under a legislative negative. Yet it does not appear, either from the public debates, or from the discussions of the press, as far as there has been an opportunity of consulting them, that the difficulty arose in the least from this part of the treaty. The contest seems to have turned wholly on other parts, and principally on the regulations of the immediate commerce between the two nations. This part of the treaty may be considered, therefore, as having received the complete sanction of Great-Britain. Had it indeed been otherwise, the repeated sanctions given to it on subsequent occasions, would preclude her from making the least use of any repugnance shewn to it on this.  
On the 28th November, 1713, a treaty of peace and another of commerce and navigation, were concluded at Utrecht with Spain, renewing and inserting the treaty of May 13th, 1667, the XXI, and XXVI articles of which have been seen to co-incide with the rules of neutral commerce, established by the treaty at Utrecht, between Great-Britain and France.

The treaty of Aix la Chapelle concluded in 1748, forms another memorable epoch in the political system of Europe. The immediate parties to it were Great-Britain, France and the United Provinces.  
The III.  
§ The treaty of commerce at Utrecht not being specially mentioned in that of Aix la Chapelle, it may, perhaps, be questioned, whether it be included in the confirmation. The question is of little consequence as that treaty is expressly included in the confirmation of preceding treaties, by the treaties of Paris, 1763 &amp; 1783.  
Art. of this treaty renews and confirms, among others, the treaties of Utrecht.

§§Chalm. vol. 1. p. 97.  
  
The treaty of peace in 1783 with France, by Art. II. renews and confirms, among others, the treaties of Westphalia in 1648, of Utrecht in 1713, of Aix-la Chapelle in 1748, and of Paris, 1763; in all of which the neutral right, now denied by Great Britain, was formally sanctioned by her stipulations.  
¶¶Jenk. vol. 3. p 337.

In the treaty of commerce again with France in 1786, deliberately undertaken in pursuance of Art. XVIII. of the treaty of 1783, the articles above recited from the treaty of Utrecht are inserted word for word; and thus received anew the most deliberate and formal sanction. Chalm. vol. I. p. 350.  
It may be here again remarked, that although this treaty underwent the most violent opposition in Great-Britain, it does not appear that the opposition was at all directed against the articles on the subject of neutral commerce.  
The treaty of 1786 was explained and altered in several particulars, by a convention bearing date August 31, 1787; without any appearance of dissatisfaction, on either side, with the articles on neutral commerce.  
In the negotiations at Lisle, in 1797, it was proposed on the part of Great Britain, by her ambassador, Lord Malmsbury, to insert, as heretofore usual in the articles of peace, a confirmation of the treaties of Utrecht, Aix la Chapelle, &amp;c. which was opposed by the French negotiators, for reasons foreign to the articles of those treaties in question.  
On this occasion, Lord Malmsbury, in urging the proposed insertion, observed, “that those treaties had become the law of nations, and that if they were omitted  
† Those treaties were not inserted in the treaty of Amiens, probably for the reasons which prevailed at Lisle.  
it might produce confusion.” This fact is attested by the negotiations, as published by the British Government.  
‡ See Lord Malmsbury’s dispatch to Lord Grenville, dated 16th July, 1797.  
  
If the treaties had become, or were founded in, the law of nations; such an omission, although it might be made a pretext for cavil between the parties, could certainly have no effect on the law of nations: and if the treaties expressed the law of nations on any subject at all, on what subject, it might be asked, have they been more explicit than on that of the maritime rights of neutrals?  
This series of treaties, to which Great-Britain is an immediate party, lengthy and strong as it is, has not exhausted the examples by which she stands self-condemned. One, in particular, remains for consideration; which, if it stood alone, ought forever to silence her pretensions. It is the treaty with Russia on the 5–17 of June, 1801.  
A very important part of the treaty is the preamble:  
“The mutual desire of his majesty the King of the United Kingdoms, &amp;c. and his majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, being not only to come to an understanding between themselves with respect to the differences  
  
which have lately interrupted the good understanding and friendly relations which subsist between the two states; but also to prevent, by frank and precise explanations upon the navigation of their respective subjects, the renewal of similar altercations and troubles which might be the consequence of them; and the common object of the solicitude of their said majesties being to settle, as soon as can be done, an equitable arrangement of those differences, and an invariable determination of their principles upon the rights of neutrality, in their application to their respective monarchies, in order to unite more closely the ties of friendship and good intercourse, &amp;c. have named for their plenipotentiaries, &amp;c. who have agreed,” &amp;c.  
With this declaratory preamble in view, attend to the following sections in article III.  
“His Britannic majesty and his Imperial majesty of all the Russias having resolved to place under a sufficient safeguard the freedom of commerce and navigation of their subjects, in case one of them shall be at war while the other shall be neuter, have agreed;  
“1st. That the ships of the neutral power may navigate freely to the ports and upon the coasts of the nations at war.  
“2d. That the effects embarked on board neutral ships shall be free, with the exception of contraband of war and of enemy’s property; and it is agreed not to comprize under the denomination of the latter, the merchandize of the produce, growth, or manufactures of the countries at war which should have been acquired by the subjects of the neutral power, and should be transported on their account; which merchandize cannot be excepted in any case from the freedom granted to the flag of the said power.” &amp;c. &amp;c.  
These extracts will receive additional weight from the following considerations:  
First. This treaty, made with Russia, the power that took the lead in asserting the principles of the armed neutrality, was, with exceptions not affecting the point in question, acceded to by Sweden and Denmark, the two other European powers most deeply interested in, and attached to, those principles. It is a treaty, therefore, of Great-Britain, as to this particular point, as well as to most of the others, with Russia, Sweden, and Denmark.  
Secondly. The treaty had for its great object, as appears by its adoption of so many of the definitions of the armed neutrality, to fix the law of nations on the several points therein, which had been so much contested; the three northern powers yielding the point of free ships, free goods: and Great-Britain yielding to all of them, those relating to the coasting, as well as every other branch of neutral trade; to blockades, and to the mode of search; and yielding to Russia, moreover, the point relating to the limitation of contraband. With respect to the case of convoys, a case not comprehended in the armed neutrality of 1780, but of much subsequent litigation, and inserted in that of 1800; a modification, satisfactory to the northern powers,  
  
was yielded by Great-Britain; with a joint agreement, that the subjects on both sides should be prohibited from carrying contraband or prohibited goods, according to an article in the armed neutrality of both dates.  
Thirdly. The treaty is expressly declared to be an {“}invariable determination [fixation] of their principles upon the rights of neutrality, in their application to their respective monarchies.”  
It cannot be pretended that this stipulated application of the rights of neutrality to the contracting parties, limits the declaratory effect, which is equally applicable to all neutral nations. Principles and rights must be the same in all cases, and in relation to all nations; and it would not be less absurd than it would be dishonorable, to profess one set of principles or rights in the law of nations towards one nation, and another set towards another nation.  
If there be any parts of the treaty, to which this declaratory character is regarded as not applicable, it cannot be pretended that they are the parts relating to the rights of neutrals to trade freely to the ports and on the coasts of nations at war; because, as already observed, the main object of the treaty was to settle the questions involved in the armed neutrality; of which this was a primary one, and is here placed by the structure of the article under the same precise stipulation, with the liability to confiscation, of enemy’s property in neutral ships; a point above all others which Great-Britain must have wished to consecrate as the law of nations, by declaratory acts for that purpose.  
It cannot be pretended that the neutral rights here declared, do not extend to the colonial as well as coasting trade of belligerent nations, because the colonial trade is not only included in a “free trade to the ports and on the coasts” of such nations, but because it is expressly declared that the effects belonging to neutrals, and transported on their account from countries at war, cannot be excepted from the freedom of the neutral flag in any case, and consequently not in the case of colonies, more than any other portion of such countries. It is not improper to remark that this declaratory stipulation is not only included in the same article, which recognised the principle that enemy’s property is excepted from the freedom of the neutral flag, but is associated with that recognition in the same section of the article, and even in the same sentence.  
* The British government having become aware of the entire renunciation here made of her claim to intercept, in time of war, the commerce of neutrals with the colonies of her enemies, set on foot negociations, with a view to new model the stipulation. Nothing more, however, could be obtained from Russia than her concurrence in an explanatory declaration, dated October 20, of the same year, in the terms following: “In order to prevent any doubt or misunderstanding with regard to the contents of the second section of the third article of the convention, concluded 5–17 June, 1801, between his Britannic Majesty, and his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, the said high contracting parties have agreed and declare, that the freedom of commerce and navigation granted by the said article to the subjects of a neutral power, [in the column in French de la puissance neutre] does not authorise them to carry in time of war, the produce and merchandize of the colonies of the belligerent power direct to the continental possessions; nor vice versa from the mother country to the enemy’s colonies; but that the said subjects are, however, to enjoy the same advantages and facilities in this commerce, as are enjoyed by the most favored nations, and especially by the United States of America.”  
  
In this declaration it will be observed, that it excepts from the general right of the neutral party to trade with the colonies of an enemy, merely the direct trade between the colony and the

r the fact of little consequence in any point of view.  
  
  
If it were possible to controvert the construction here given to the treaty, a reference might be made to a very able speech delivered by Lord Grenville in the British House of Lords in November 1801, in which this very construction is fully demonstrated. The demonstration is rendered the more striking by the embarrassed and feeble opposition made to it by the ingenuity of the very able speakers who entered the list against him.

Such is the accumulated and irrisistible testimony borne by Great Britain, in her own treaties, against the doctrine asserted by her.  
It will be in order now to resume the notice of treaties to which she was not a party, but which authorize some inferences and observations contributing still further, if possible, to invalidate her novel pretensions.  
The review heretofore taken of this class of treaties was limited to such as preceded the armed neutrality. Those now to be added, are principally the treaties and conventions entered into in the years 1780 and 1800.  
The treaties of 1780 declare the right of neutrals in the case under discussion, in the following terms: “that all vessels shall be permitted to navigate from port to port, and on the coasts of the belligerent powers.” Those of 1800 are in terms too little varied to require recital.  
  
It has never been questioned, that these definitions of the neutral right were as applicable to colonies as to any other of the territories belonging to a belligerent nation. All the British writers have so understood the text, and in that sense, have employed their pens against it.  
It need scarcely be remarked that the treaties in question were framed with a view, not of making a new law of nations, but of declaring and asserting the law as it actually stood. The preamble to the convention of 1800, for the re-establishment of an armed neutrality between Russia and Sweden, explains the object in the terms following: “In order that the freedom of navigation and the security of merchandize of the neutral powers may be established, and the principles of the law of nations be fully ascertained, &amp;c.”  
The preamble to the convention of 1780, states the principles avowed by the parties to be {“}the principles derived from the primitive rights of nations.”  
The treaty of 1780 was originally concluded between Russia and Denmark. But it was acceded to by Sweden, Prussia, the United Provinces, Austria, Portugal and Naples; and in effect, by France and Spain. The principles of the treaty had the sanction also of the United States of America in their cruizing ordinances. Thus it is seen, that with the exception of Great-Britain alone, all the powers of Europe, materially interested in the maritime law of nations, have given a recent and repeated sanction to the right of neutrals to trade freely with every part of the countries at war. And although several of those nations have, on some of the points contained in these treaties, as on the points of contraband and enemy’s property under neutral flags, entered since into adverse stipulations; not one of them has by treaty or otherwise relinquished the particular right under consideration,

* To these might be added their treaties with the coast of Barbary, which are all favorable to the neutral rights of commerce. So are various treaties of Great-Britain, and of the other powers of Europe, with that coast and with the Ottoman Porte; all of which, as well as those with the Asiatic powers, it was thought most proper to omit in this enquiry.  
In all of these, except the treaty with Great-Britain, they have positively maintained the principle that neutrals may trade freely between neutral and belligerent ports, and between one belligerent port and another, whether under the same or different jurisdictions; and the treaty with Great-Britain contained not even an implication against the principle. It merely omitted a stipulation on the subject, as it did on many others, contained in other treaties.

The Conduct of Other Nations.  
The evidence from this source is merely negative; but is not on that account without a convincing effect. If the doctrine advanced by Great-Britain had been entertained by other nations, it would have been seen in the documents, corresponding with those which contain the British doctrine. Yet, with all the research which could be employed, no indication has been met with, that a single nation, besides herself, has founded on the distinction between a trade permitted and a trade not permitted in time of peace, a belligerent right to interrupt the trade in time of war. The distinction can be traced neither in their diplomatic discussions, nor their manifestos, nor their prize ordinances, nor their instructions to their cruizers, nor in the decisions of their maritime courts. If the distinction had been asserted or recognized, it could not fail to have exhibited itself, in some, or other, of those documents. Having done so in none of them, the inference cannot be contested, that Great-Britain is the only nation that has ever attempted this momentous innovation on the law of nations.  
  
  
Conduct of Great-Britain.  
If it be not enough to have shewn, that the belligerent claim asserted by Great-Britain is condemned by all the highest authorities on the law of nations, by the clearest testimony of treaties among all the principal maritime nations of the world, herself included, and by the practice of all other nations; she cannot surely demur to the example of her own proceedings. And it is here, perhaps, more than any where else, that the claim ought to shrink from examination. It will be seen, in the course of the following observations, that Great-Britain is compelled, under every appeal that can be made to herself, to pronounce her own condemnation; and what is much worse, that the innovation, which she endeavors to enforce as a right of war, is under that name a mere project for extending the field of maritime capture, and multiplying the sources of commercial aggrandizement; a warfare, in fact, against the commerce of her friends, and a monopolizing grasp at that of her enemies.  
1st. Whilst Great-Britain denies to her enemies a right to relax their laws in favor of neutral commerce, she relaxes her own, those relating as well to her colonial trade, as to other branches.

The efforts of Great-Britain to maintain a trade at all times with the

It has been already noticed, that, in the infancy of her belligerent pretension against the trade of neutrals with the colonies of her enemies, she favored, by special licences, a trade of her own subjects with the same colonies.

 time of peace.  
The origin of this novel principle deserves a more particular developement. The English government had no sooner made war on the French commerce, than the Dutch began to avail themselves of their neutral and stipulated rights to enter into it; particularly the commerce of the colonies, both to their own ports, and to French ports. The English immediately made war on this commerce, as indeed they did on the commerce to Spain, Portugal and other countries. The Dutch vessels were even pillaged on the high seas, and their seamen very badly treated. In the years 1757 and 1758 alone, the number of vessels captured and pillaged, amounted to no less than three hundred; and the damages were estimated at eleven millions of florins, between five and six millions of dollars. The Dutch appealed to their treaties with England [those in 1674 and 1675] which made enemy’s goods free in their ships, contraband only excepted, and the Dutch trade free from and to the enemy’s ports, and from one enemy’s port to another. The English were driven to the pretext that the treaty of 1674, said only that the liberty of trade should extend to all merchandizes which were transported in time of peace, those of contraband excepted; and was, therefore, not applicable to the colonial trade in time of war. Besides that the time of peace, if it had been any thing more than a mode of expressing the entire freedom of commerce, could refer only to the kind of merchandizes, not to the ports or channels of trade, the Dutch were able to appeal to  
  
the declaratory treaty of 1675, which stipulated an unlimited freedom of trade from and to ports of enemies, without saying any thing as to times of peace. This admitting no reply, the English found no refuge but in the pretext, that the Dutch vessels, being engaged in the colonial trade, were to be considered as French vessels. This

These shapes and uses soon began to disclose themselves: for it appears from the references made in the case of the Providencia,

tried before Sir W. Scott in 1799, that French West-India produce, conveyed by neutrals from Monte Christi, a Spanish neutral port, was, in the progress of the war of 1756, condemned, on the pretext that the intervention of a neutral port, was a fraudulent evasion of the rule which condemned the trade with a French port; notwithstanding the previous rule of the Lords of appeal, according to which the landing or even trans-shipment of such produce, at a neutral port, neutralized the trade, and made it lawful.  
There is some obscurity, it must be owned, as to the principle on which a neutral trade with the French colonies was condemned, after the discontinuance of special licences; it being sometimes stated in the arguments referring to that period, that the condemnation was founded on the principle, that the trade was virtually or adoptively, a French trade; and sometimes, that it was founded on the general principle that it was a trade not open in time of peace. Certain it is, that the original principle was that of a virtual adoption, this principle being commensurate with the original occasion; and that, as soon as this original principle was found insufficient to reach the new occasions, a strong tendency was seen towards a variation of the principle, in order to bring the new occasions within its reach.

s, it must be observed, is a case of colonial trade; and a colonial trade of the most exclusive kind in time of peace; a trade between the colony and the parent country.  
To these authorities, an explanation equally singular and unsatisfactory is opposed. It was understood, says sir William Scott, that “France in opening her colonies, during the war [of 1778] declared that this was not done  
  
with a temporary view relative to the war, but on a general and permanent purpose of altering her colonial system, and of admitting foreign vessels; universally and at all times, to a participation of that commerce. Taking that to be the fact, (however suspicious its commencement might be, during the actual existence of the war) there was no ground to say that neutrals were not carrying on a commerce, as ordinary, as any other in which they could be engaged; and therefore, in the case of the Verwagtig, and many other succeeding cases, the lords decreed payment of freight to the neutral ship owner.”

The project, however, had little other effect, than to disgust those most interested in neutral commerce, and least hostile to France. This was particularly the case with the United States, who did not fail to make the most strenuous remonstrances against so extraordinary a proceeding. The correspondence of their secretary of state with the British plenipotentiary, (Mr. Hammond), and of Mr. Pinckney the American plenipotentiary with Lord Grenville, the British secretary of state, are proofs of the energy  
  
with which the innovation was combated, and of the feebleness and fallacy with which it was defended. The defence was rested on a loose expression of Vattel. Bynkershoek, who had not altogether got rid of the ideas of the former century, and by whom Vattel probably was misled, could have furnished a still stronger authority.

For some time the irregularities went on, without any known instructions from the government reviving the abandoned principle; but without the licentious excesses which followed.  
As early, however, as November 6, 1793, instructions were issued, which struck generally at the neutral commerce with the French West Indies. That of the United States was the principal victim. The havoc was the greater, because the instructions being carried into operation before they were promulged, took the commerce by surprize.  
This instruction of November 6th, 1793, was addressed to the commanders of ships of war, and to privateers having letters of Marque against France, in the following terms:  
“That they shall stop and detain all ships laden with goods the produce of any colony belonging to France, or carrying provisions or other supplies  
  
for the use of any such colony, and shall bring the same with their cargoes to legal adjudication in our courts of admirality.

The resentment produced by it, and which was doubled by the ensnaring concealment of the instruction, appeared not only in the outcry of the suffering merchants, but in the discussions and proceedings of the government. Important restrictions on the commerce of Great Britain were agreed to by one branch of the congress, and negatived by a single vote in the other. A sequestration of British funds and effects in the United States was proposed and strongly supported. And an embargo withholding supplies essential to the subsistence of the British West Indies, actually passed into a law, and remained in force for some time.

4. “The relaxations that have since [the instructions of November 6, 1793] been adopted, have originated chiefly in the change that has taken place in the trade of that part of the world, since the establishment of an independent government on the continent of America. In consequence of that event, American vessels had been admitted to trade in some articles, and on certain conditions, with the colonies, both of this country and of France. Such a permission had become a part of the general commercial arrangements, as the ordinary state of their trade in time of peace. The commerce of America was therefore abridged by the foregoing instructions, and debarred of the right generally ascribed to neutral trade in time of war, that it may be continued, with particular exceptions, on the basis of its ordinary establishment. In consequence of representations made by the American government, to this effect, new instructions to our cruizers were issued, 8th January, 1794, apparently designed to exempt American ships trading between their own country and the calonies of France.”

ded then, that the commercial policy for which she employs  
  
her new belligerent principle, is the more apparent from two subsidiary pretensions, as new, as they are at variance with the maritime rights of neutral nations.  
The object of drawing through her own warehouses and countinghouses, the colonial trade of her enemies, on its way from the West Indies to the other countries of Europe, being counteracted by the extensive intercourse between the United States and those colonies, and by the re-exportation from the United States, of the imported surplus of colonial produce, the project was adopted, of forcing this trade directly from the West Indies to, and through, Great Britain—1st, by checking the West India importations into the United States, and thereby lessening the surplus for re-exportation. 2d, by embarrassing the re-exportation from the United States; both considerations seconded, no doubt, by the avidity of her cruizers and by the public interest, supposed to be incorporated with their success in making prizes; and the first consideration, seconded also, perhaps, by a desire to give an indirect check to the exportation of contraband of war from the United States.  
In order to check importations, the principle is advanced, that the outward and the return voyage are to be regarded, as forming but a single voyage; and consequently, if a vessel is found with an innocent cargo on board, but on her return from a hostile port, her outward cargo to which, was as contraband of war subject to capture, the vessel is thereby rendered liable to capture, and the chance for capture, by that means, doubled.

 between that date and the 24th June, 1803, conducting the policy or opinion of the cabinet, towards the instructions of this last date. These form, however, a very natural result to those preliminary ideas, as appears by the tenor of the instructions which is as follows:  
“In consideration of the present state of commerce, we are pleased hereby to direct the commanders of our ships of war, and privateers, not to seize any neutral vessel which shall be carrying on trade directly between the colonies of enemies and the neutral country to which the vessel belongs, and laden with the property of inhabitants of such neutral country: Provided, that such neutral vessel shall not be supplying, nor shall have, on the outward voyage supplied the enemy with any articles of contraband of war; and shall not be trading with any blockaded port.”  
In these instructions we find the principle formally adopted, and the returned cargoes of West-India produce, actually obstructed, on their way to the United States, by the application of the principle, wherever the outward cargo had included contraband. We find, of course, the West-India trade so far forced out of the channel to Europe through the United State

.  
The second pretension subsidiary to the commercial policy of instructions, cloathed with the language of belligerent rights, is that of subjecting to capture, colonial produce, re-exported from a neutral country, to countries to which a direct transportation from the colonies by vessels of the re-exporting country, has been disallowed by British regulations. The effect of this pretension evidently is, to check neutral nations, particularly the United States, in the circuitous transportation of West-India produce; and in the same proportion, to force the trade into channels terminating in British ports.

The next occasion, on which the judge delivered an opinion on this

It was the case of an American ship taken October 16, 1799, on a voyage from Marblehead to Bilboa, with a mixed cargo of fish, sugar and cocoa. The fish, which made the principal part of the cargo, could not enter into the question. The sugar was part of a whole cargo brought from the Havanna in the same ship, had been warehoused from some time in June ’till some time in August, during the repair of the ship, and was then re-shipped.

ered at the custom-house. The ship had been restored by the captors. The property of the cargo was proved. The legality of the voyage was the sole question. On this question, sir William Scott pronounced the following judgment.  
“There remains then only the question of law, which has been raised, whether this is not such a trade as will fall under the principle that has been applied to the interposition of neutrals in the colonial trade of the enemy? On which it is said that if an American is not allowed to carry on this trade directly, neither can it be allowed to do it circuitously. An American has undoubtedly a right to import the produce of the Spanish colonies for his own use; and after it is imported bona fide into his own country, he would be at liberty to carry them on to the general commerce of Europe; very different would such a case be from the Dutch cases, in which there was an original contract from the beginning, and under a special Dutch licence to go from Holland to Surinam, and to return again to Holland with a cargo of colonial produce. It is not my business to say what is universally the test of a bona fide importation. It is argued that it would not be sufficient that the duties should be paid, and t

urts having condemned, American vessels bound from the United States to the Spanish West-Indies, on the pretext that their cargoes consisted of articles the growth of Spain, then at war with Great Britain; the American minister in London, in March 1801, represented to the British government the iniquity of the proceeding, with the indignation which it inspired; and required that precise instructions should be dispatched to the proper officers in the West-Indies and Nova Scotia, to put an end to the depredations.  
  
The subject was referred to the king’s advocate general, an extract from whose report was communicated by the British secretary of state to the American minister, with information that the king had ordered the doctrine laid down in the report, to be immediately transmitted to the several inferior judges, as the law for their future guidance and direction.  
The extract containing this doctrine shall be literally recited.  
“I have the honor to report, that the sentence of the vice-admiralty court appears to be erroneous, and to be founded in a misapprehension or misapplication of the principles laid down in the decision of the court of admiralty referred to, without attending to the limitations therein contained.  
“The general principle respecting the colonial trade has in the course of the present war been to a certain degree relaxed in consideration of the present state of commerce. It is now distinctly understood, and has been repeatedly so decided by the high court of appeals, that the produce of the colonies of the enemy may be imported by a neutral into his own country, and may be re-exported from thence, even to the mother country of such colony; and in like manner the produce and manufactures of the mother country may, in this circuitous mode, legally find their way to the colonies. The direct trade, however, between the mother country and its colonies has not, I apprehend, been recognized as legal, either by his majesty’s government or by his tribunals.  
“What is a direct trade, or what amounts to an intermediate importation into the neutral country, may sometimes be a question of some difficulty. A general definition of either applicable to all cases, cannot well be laid down. The question must depend upon the particular circumstances of each case; perhaps the mere touching in the neutral country, to take fresh clearances, may fairly be considered as a fraudulent evasion, and as in effect the direct trade; but the high court of admiralty has expressly decided (and I see no reason to expect that the court of appeal will vary the rule) that landing the goods and paying the duties in the neutral country, breaks the continuity of the voyage, and is such an importation as legalizes the trade; altho’ the goods be reshipped in the same vessel, and on account of the same neutral proprietors, and forwarded for sale to the mother country.”

Thus stood the admiralty law in Great Britain, as announced by British tribunals, and officially communicated by the British Cabinet, to the neutral world. So it had continued to stand, as a pledge and safeguard to neutrals, conforming themselves to it, from the dates of those authorities, the last of which is as far back as the spring of the year 1801.  
With what astonishment, then, must the neutral world now learn, from the decision of Sir William Scott on the 23d July, 1805, that, according to the rule of law just laid down, after much deliberation, by the lords of appeals “the circumstances of landing the goods, or securing the duties do not furnish complete evidence of the termination of the voyage”; and that without this complete evidence, derived from the original intention of the importing voyage, the voyage from the neutral port will be treated as the continuance of the voyage from the colony to the mother country.  
This political change in the judicial rules of condemnation, admits no other satisfactory, than a commercial explanation; for the loss of character, which it induces, is a greater sacrifice than could be made to the cupidity of cruizers, or the value of their prizes to the public.  
The whole course, indeed, of modifications pursued by the instructions, and by the decisions of the courts as they appear from day to day, can leave no doubt that the primary object with Great-Britain has been to transfer to herself as large a share as possible of the commercial advantages yielded by the colonies of her enemies. An absolute monopoly was embarrassed by the irresistible pretensions of neutral countries; more especially of the United States, whose neighborhood and habits of intercourse, together with other considerations, forbade a perseverance in the original attempt to exclude them. They were accordingly the first of the neutral nations towards which a relaxation was afforded. The relaxation, after considerable delay, was extended, by the instruction of 1798, to the neutral nations of Europe. That instruction was founded on a compromize between the interest and the prudence of Great-Britain. It permitted neutral nations to trade directly with the colonies of her enemies; without trading in colonial productions with one another; and permitted all of them to carry those productions directly to Great-Britain. This arrangement was manifestly calculated to limit the importations of each neutral country to the amount of its own consumption; and consequently to turn the immense residue of colonial wealth, through neutral vessels, into her own market; whence it might be dispensed, under her own regulations, to the neutral countries of Europe having no direct commerce with the West-Indies, and even to the belligerent nations whose commerce with their respective colonies she has as completely destroyed, as she has their commerce with foreign countries. The arrangement was specious, but proved to be deceptive. It was expected that the expence and  
  
delay of a circuitous trade through the United States would prevent importations and re-exportations, interfering with the projected trade directly from the West-Indies to herself; and as long as this expectation was in any degree indulged, the right of re-exportation was admitted, though reluctantly, both by the government and the courts. Experience, however, finally shewed, that the activity, the capital, and the economy employed by the American traders, overpowered the disadvantages incident to the circuit through the ports of the United States; and secured to them the profits of supplying Europe with the colonial productions of her enemies. In proportion as this unforeseen operation disclosed itself, the commercial jealousy of Great-Britain began to take alarm. Obstructions were to be thrown in the way of importations. Re-exportations were seen with growing discontent. The idea of continuity, by which two voyages were consolidated into one, came into vogue. The Vice-Admiralty courts, regardless of the superior decisions in England, would not allow that the landing of a cargo, and paying the duties, protected it against condemnation. At length appeared the sentence of Sir Wm. Scott, above cited, carrying into effect the construction of the inferior courts, as having been deliberately sanctioned by the Lords of Appeal. The doctrine established by that decision has been followed by other decisions, and dicta, at first requiring the re-exportation, in another ship, then a previous sale of the articles in the neutral market, then other conditions, one after another, as they were found necessary; till it is finally understood, that no precautions whatever are to bar the cruizers from suspecting, nor the courts from scrutinizing, the intention of the original importer, and that the proof of this intention not to re-export the articles, is to fall on the claimant. To fill up the measure of judicial despotism, these wanton innovations are now extended to vessels returning from the belligerent mother countries, as well as to those going thither from the United States; with the addition of demands of proof never before heard of in prize courts, on points utterly unknown to the law of nations.  
These unexampled and vexatious proceedings manifestly have in view the entire obstruction of colonial re-exports from the United States; and it would be more candid in Great-Britain, if not more just, to give public notice, at once, that in all such cases capture and condemnation would be authorized.  
Her present system, as subsidiary to the extension of her commerce, will be still further seen in her concurrent measures, of a type not less extra-ordinary than that of any which have preceded them.  
According to the instructions issued within the period of the existing war, or to the received interpretation of them, the permission given to neutrals by those of 1798, to carry the produce of enemy’s colonies, directly therefrom to Great-Britain, has not been continued. At first view this might appear to be inconsistent with the policy ascribed to her, in obstructing re-exportations from the United States. The act of Parliament, of June 27,  
  
1805, however, which has been already noticed, changes this appearance of departure from that policy, into a new proof, and even an extension of that policy. By the regulations of that act a direct trade is opened between the British colonies in the West-Indies and those of her enemies; and her enemies themselves are invited to enter into the trade. Whilst neutrals, therefore, are excluded from carrying colonial produce directly from the colonies to Great-Britain, the commercial views of Great-Britain are answered by the substitution of another channel through her own colonies; with the additional advantage of a monopoly to her own ships, in the transportation from her colonies across the Atlantic; and for the sake of this advantage, or for that of repressing the growth of neutral rivalship, or on both these accounts, she has been willing to encounter all the reproach of cultivating an avowed commerce with her enemies, in the very moment of laying new restrictions on that of neutrals with them.  
Further; the act of Parliament, of June 27, 1805, providing for a trade between Great-Britain and the colonies of her enemies, through the medium of free ports in her own colonies, was preceded by an act of April 10, 1805, authorizing licences to British subjects, to import, during the war, into Great-Britain, in neutral vessels, for their own or neutral account, from the American colonies of her enemies, most of their productions; requiring, at the same time, that all sugar and coffee so imported should be re-exported; and that the value of a certain portion of the imports from such colonies should be returned in goods and commodities from Great-Britain.  
Again; in concert with the act of June 27, instructions, founded on another act of Parliament, were issued, June 29, 1805, authorizing British subjects to export in neutral vessels to France, Spain, and Holland, a long list of articles, including their respective colonial productions; and to import therefrom a long list of such articles as suited her own wants.  
To complete the arrangement, in all its forms, it has been officially announced in the American Gazettes, conformably to a resolution of the British privy council, of August 3, 1805, that the trade with the settlements and islands belonging to the enemy, in America and the West-Indies, is to be carried on through the medium of the British free ports in the West-Indies, and not otherwise.  
The system of Great-Britain may, therefore, now be considered as announced to all the world, without disguise, and by the most solemn acts of her government. Her navy having destroyed the trade of her enemies, as well between the mother countries and their colonies, as between the former and neutral countries; and her courts, by putting an end to re-exportations from neutral countries, reducing the importations into these, to the mere amount of their own consumption; the immense surplus of productions accumulating in the American possessions of her enemies can find no outlet but through the free ports provided for it; nor any other market  
  
than the British market, and those to which she finds it for her interest to distribute it; with a view to which, she not only allows her enemies to trade with her possessions, but allows her own subjects to trade with her enemies. And thus, in defiance as well of her treason laws and of her trade laws, as of the rights of neutrality, under the law of nations, we find her, in the just and emphatic language of the President, “taking to herself, by an inconsistency at which reason revolts, a commerce with her own enemy, which she denies to a neutral, on the ground of its aiding that enemy in the war.”  
* President’s message, December 3, 1805.  
  
But let us return for a moment to the series of instructions of which an historical review has been taken; and advert to some additional lights in which the judicial construction and application of them present the conduct of Great-Britain.  
Prior to the orders of November 6, 1793, the general principle forbidding to neutrals a trade opened to them during the war, must, if it be a principle of the law of nations, as asserted by Great-Britain, have been the rule of Admiralty decisions. Accordingly, it appears, by 4 Rob. Appendix p. 12, that condemnations in cases prior to that date were, in the court of Appeals, made to rest on that principle.  
The orders of November 6, 1793, designated for the operation of the principle, the trade with the colonies of the enemy; as well the trade to, as the trade from, them.  
The orders of January, 1794, expressly revoking the orders of November, 1793, designated for capture, the trade only from the West-India Islands of the enemy, and bound directly to Europe, only.  
The orders of January, 1798, revoking expressly the orders of January, 1794, designated for capture the trade from the islands or settlements of the enemies, bound directly to any port in Europe; excepting what might be bound to British ports, or to the ports of the country to which the neutral vessels should belong.  
Without entering into a variety of minute questions growing out of the varied and very inaccurate expressions in which the orders are penned, several of very great importance occur, in expounding and applying the rules laid down.  
The first question is, whether the first order of 1793, which made no express reference to the general principle, and which was limited to the colonial branch of the enemy’s trade, was to be understood as merely a specification of certain cases to which the general principle was applicable, leaving the general principle in force as to all unspecified cases; or whether this specification of certain cases was to be understood as implying a legalization of cases unspecified.  
The question arises, also, under the successive orders, each of them  
  
revoking the orders immediately preceding, whether it was to be understood, that the specification of certain cases did, or did not, legalize the cases omitted in the same order, but specified in the orders preceding.  
The more obvious construction of the original order, even, seems to be, rather that it was meant to define the only cases to which the general belligerent claim was to be applied, than that it was meant merely to notify the claim in those particular cases; a claim not more requiring notification in those cases, than in the cases not notified.  
With respect to the orders of posterior dates, the fair construction implies, that the belligerent claim was narrowed, first, by all the difference between the orders of 1793 and those of 1794; and finally, by all the difference between the orders of 1794, and those of 1798.  
Taking the whole together under these constructions, the application of the general principle of capture was restricted by these orders to the trade of neutrals from the colonies of enemies, directly to ports, other than their own respective ports and the British ports, and consequently there remained exempt from capture:  
1st. The coasting trade, and every branch of trade not colonial.  
2d. The trade from any neutral country, to belligerent colonies.  
3d. The trade by neutrals from any belligerent country to its own colonies, and to the colonies of another belligerent country.  
4th. The trade between belligerent colonies, whether belonging to the same or to different belligerent countries.  
Applying this rule of implication to the two orders only of 1794 and 1798; and admitting those of 1793 not to have superceded, by implication, the claims to capture in cases not therein specified, there will be no other exception to the relaxations or exemptions just enumerated in favor of neutral commerce, but the coasting trade, and other trades not colonial, to which Great Britain has applied, or may choose to apply, the general principle.  
In general the high court of admiralty seems, by applying the assumed principle to the coasting trade, to have pursued that construction of the original order of 1793, which left the general principle in force as to cases not specified in it; and to have considered the relaxations in the succeeding orders of 1794 and 1798, as referring solely to the colonial trade.  
There appears, however, at no time to have been any clear and fixed opinion in the court, with respect to the illegality and penal consequences of the coasting trade.  
Few cases are reported, perhaps few have occurred, of discussions relative to this branch of trade. In 1 Rob. p. 104, the subject is incidentally brought into view, in a case where a French vessel had been purchased. The doctrine held by the judge is expressed as follows: “We certainly do allow it [the purchase] but only to persons conducting themselves in a fair neutral  
  
manner, &amp;c. besides, this vessel appears to have been engaged in the coasting trade of France. The court has never gone so far as to say, that pursuing one voyage of that kind would be sufficient to fix a hostile character: But in my opinion, a habit of such trading would. Such a voyage however must raise a strong degree of suspicion against a neutral claim; and the plunging at once into a trade so highly dangerous, creates a presumption that there is an enemy proprietor lurking behind the cover of a neutral name.” Here, not the coasting trade itself, but the presumption of enemy’s property found in it, is made the ground of animadversion.  
In the case of the Speculator, the same idea presents itself.  
* 2 Rob. p. 244.  
  
The Emanuel  
† 1 Rob. 249.  
was itself the case of a coasting trade. In this case the judge descanted with great energy and rigor, on the manifest illegality of the coasting trade. “Can there be described” says he “a more effective accommodation that can be given to an enemy during war than to undertake it for him during his own inability.” He did not however proceed further than to refuse freight on the principle settled by ancient judgments, that “neutrals are not permitted to trade on freight.” He particularly refers to the case of the Mercurius [Lords, March 7, 1795] in which freight was refused. Why were not the ships confiscated in these cases? that being laid down in other cases as included in the penalty for illegal voyages, and actually applied ultimately to cases of a trade between a colony and the mother country, to which the coasting trade is strictly analogous; both being trades from one port to another port of the same nation. It is not even to be inferred from the authorities here cited, that a coasting trade, in the produce of the country, if carried not on freight, but as property belonging to the neutral owner of the ship, is subject to any penalty. This indulgence to the coasting, and rigor towards the colonial trade, is it to be explained by the fertility of the one, and the little value of the other, as a source of captures and commercial profit, or in what other way?  
With respect to the orders of ’94 and ’98, and the colonial trade, it appears to have been in general understood, that they were to be construed as successively enlarging the trade of neutrals with the colonies of enemies, in the manner and to the extent above explained.  
The dilemma was indeed unavoidable; either the orders were to be considered as relaxations, (and if relaxations at all, in that extent) or as leaving the general principle in force in cases not specified in the orders, and therefore as no relaxations at all.  
This latter decision would have given a character of mockery to the profession and parade of making, in their orders, so many sacrifices of belligerent rights to a spirit of moderation and amity towards neutrals. The former  
  
side of the dilemma, therefore, was necessarily taken. The orders, those of ’94 and ’98 at least, were relaxations.  
As relaxations however in the extent required by an obvious and consistent interpretation, the door, opened to neutral commerce with the belligerent colonies, was found to be wider than was compatible either with the interests of British commerce, the avidity of British cruizers, or the probable intentions of the British government.  
What was to be the remedy? The first tried was that of shutting the door gradually, by the dint of constructions, as may be seen by tracing the colonial cases adjudged by Sir William Scott, and reported by Robinson, and the decisions of the Lords of Appeals referred to by the reporter.  
The task was assuredly not a little difficult, of which there is the strongest demonstration in the crooked and contradictory reasonings and decrees, into which it forced the very eminent talents of the judge who presides in the high court of admiralty.  
In addition to the evidence already presented, take the following comparison between his rule of construction in the case of the Providentia,  
* 2 Rob. p 126.  
and the rule of construction in the case of the Emanuel  
† 2 Rob. p. 159.  
  
In the former case, August 16, 1799, he observes, “the first instructions were to bring in all ships which had been trading with any colony of the enemy: but this country afterwards receded from those directions; and the second orders were to bring in all ships laden with the produce of the West India islands, coming directly from the ports of the said islands to any port in Europe. I cannot but consider this as an abandonment of the former law, [instruction] and I cannot but think that a cruiser taking this instruction, in conjunction with those given before, must have inferred that it was no longer the intention of government to bring in, and much less to confiscate,” [was there room for this distinction?] “cargoes of West India produce, unless coming to some port in Europe: this was followed by instructions now in force, which direct the bringing in of all vessels laden with the produce of the French and Spanish settlements, coming from the ports of such settlements to any port of Europe, other than the ports of that country to which the vessel belongs. It is certainly not laid down in the negative that they shall not bring in such vessels as are coming from such settlements to their own ports; but looking at the former instruction, I think it was a strong admonition to cruisers not to bring in such ships, and I believe it has been generally so understood and acted upon by them; and in this court cargoes brought from Surrinam to ports in Europe to which the vessels belonged, have been uniformly restored on proof of the neutrality of the property.”  
The reasoning here is plain and just. The first instructions designated  
  
for capture the colonial trade, without distinguishing between Europe and America: the second designated the trade to Europe only: therefore, by fair inference, the trade to America was exempted from capture.  
Again, the second orders designated for capture the trade to Europe: the third orders designated the trade to ports of Europe not being of Great Britain or of the country owning the vessel: therefore by fair inference the trade to Great Britain and to countries owning the vessels, was exempted from capture.  
In the Emanuel, November 7, 1799, the case was that of a neutral ship taken on a voyage last from France to a French colony. According to the reasoning of Sir William Scott, just quoted, the inevitable inference ought to have been that the voyage was legal.  
The first instructions designated for capture the trade to and from the colonies. Both the second and third designated for capture the trade only from the colonies; therefore, according to that reasoning, the trade to the colonies was exempted from capture.  
Hear nevertheless the reasoning employed by the judge himself in this case.  
After combating the neutral right to trade with the colonies of an enemy, by arguments applicable, in principle, as well to a trade between neutral ports and the colonies, as to a trade between the mother country and its colonies; he proceeds to state, in answer to all pleas for a neutral trade from the mother country to its colonies, “that the true rule to this court is the text of the instructions; what is not found therein permitted, is understood to be prohibited, upon this plain principle, that the colony trade is generally prohibited, and that whatever is not specially relaxed, continues in a state of interdiction.”  
Now as what is not permitted, not specially relaxed, is by the instruction to continue prohibited, the question to be decided is, what it is that is permitted, or specially relaxed by the instructions? Is it what is positively and expressly permitted or relaxed? Then there is no permission or relaxation at all; for every thing positive and express in the instruction is for the capture, not for the permission or relaxation. Is it to be a permission or relaxation implied and inferred from a positive and specified prohibition in one order, and an omission of that or of a part of that prohibition, in a succeeding order? Then the neutral trade from a belligerent country to its colonies, which was prohibited in the order of 1793, and omitted in the orders of 1794 and 1798, was as much permitted, as specially relaxed, as the trade from a neutral country to the colonies of an enemy, is permitted or relaxed by the omission in the orders of 1794 and ’98, to prohibit the trade to the colonies, which as well as the trade from the colonies, was positively and specially prohibited by the previous order of 1793; or to recur to the reasoning of Sir William Scott, in the former case of the Providentia, as much  
  
permitted or relaxed as the trade from the colonies going not to Europe, was inferred to be so from the order of 1794, taken in conjunction with the order of 1793; the order of ’93 having prohibited the trade from the colonies generally, and the order of ’94 having omitted to prohibit more of the trade from the colonies than what was bound to some port in Europe.  
The judge concludes with declaring, “I see no favorable distinction between an outward and return voyage. I consider the intent of the instruction to apply equally to both communications, though the return voyage is the only one specially mentioned.”  
What favorable distinction, then, could the judge see between the outward and the return voyage, in a trade between a neutral country, and the colonies of an enemy, more than between the two voyages to Spain, a mother country, and the colonies? Is not the return voyage the only one specially mentioned, whether the instruction be applied to the former trade or to the latter trade? This is self evident. Either then he must admit the distinction in both, and say that the return voyage only being specially mentioned, the outward voyage is in both trades permitted; or he must reject the distinction in both, and say, that the outward voyage, tho’ the return voyage only be specially mentioned, is prohibited in both. A different course however was pursued. The instruction was applied to the outward voyage in the neutral trade from the mother country to the colony, without being considered as applicable to the outward voyage in the trade from the neutral country to a colony; which last has not as yet been subjected to condemnation. Whether that is to be its future destiny, as has happened to some other branches of commerce, where it was equally precluded by legal decisions and even official assurances, is among the arcana of the admiralty cabinet of Great Britain.  
The judgment in this case, it is to be observed, did not go beyond the condemnation of the goods. The vessel was restored, but with a forfeiture of freight and expences.  
By degrees, however, with the aid of alleged fraud, of false destination, and of contraband in the outward voyages, the ship as well as the cargo were brought within the rules of condemnation in the high court of admiralty. The decision of the lords of appeal has finally established, in the case of a voyage from a Spanish colony to a neutral, but forbidden port in Europe, that any illegal trade of neutrals with the colonies of an enemy forfeits both ship and cargo.  
* 4 Rob. Appen. p. 11.  
  
Other examples might be drawn from the proceedings in the British courts of admiralty, to illustrate the constructive return towards the general principle which had been mitigated by successive instructions, and the anomalous and entangled decisions, which have been employed for  
  
the purpose. These illustrations cannot be here pursued, without too great an addition to the prolixity which has already been incurred. It will only therefore be remarked generally; first, that the course of proceedings, as they relate to the coasting, and different branches of the colonial trade; to the grounds on which these have been interdicted to neutrals; and to the penalties attached to breaches of the interdictions, compose a labyrinth for which no concatenation of principles, no thread of reasoning whatever, affords a clue: Secondly, that constructive decisions, as appears in the last volume of Robinson’s reports, have not only restored, in a great measure, the operation of the general principle; but have introduced collateral principles, greatly extending the mischiefs of its operation.  
Whilst all the considerations therefore which originally led to the examination of this principle, are acquiring additional force, it is fortunate that so irresistible a testimony against its legitimacy, should have been furnished by the conduct of Great Britain herself.  
  
  
  
  
Review of the reasons urged in defence of the British principle.  
Although some of the reasons by which this belligerent claim of Great-Britain is defended, have incidentally fallen under consideration in the course which the subject has taken, yet a more particular notice of those most relied on, may be necessary to complete the present examination.  
The principal champions for the claim, are the judge of the high court of admiralty himself, sir William Scott; Mr. Ward, now under Secretary of State in Great-Britain, who is sufficiently known by his treatises on the law of nations, one of which embraces this precise subject; and Mr. Brown, a professor of civil law in the University of Dublin, and author of a work on civil and admiralty law.  
Sir William Scott has, in every view, the first title to be heard.  
In the judgment delivered by him in the case of the Immanuel, his eloquence has painted the belligerent claim in very glowing colours. The passage shall be given in his own words.  
“It is an indubitable right of the belligerent to possess himself of such places, as of any other possession of his enemy. This is his common right, but he has the certain means of carrying such a right into effect, if he has a decided superiority at sea: Such colonies are dependent for their existence, as colonies, on foreign supplies; if they cannot be supplied and defended they must fall to the belligerent of course—and if the belligerent chooses to apyly his means to such an object, what right has a third party, perfectly neutral, to step in and prevent the execution? No existing interest of his is affected by it; he can have no right to apply to his own use the beneficial consequences of the mere act of the belligerent, and to say, ‘True it is, you  
  
have, by force of arms, forced such places out of the exclusive possession of the enemy, but I will share the benefit of the conquest, and by sharing its benefits prevent its progress. You have in effect, and by lawful means, turned the enemy out of the possession which he had exclusively maintained against the whole world, and with whom we had never presumed to interfere, but we will interpose to prevent his absolute surrender, by the means of that very opening, which the prevalence of your arms alone has affected; supplies shall be sent and their products shall be exported; you have lawfully destroyed his monopoly, but you shall not be permitted to possess it yourself; we insist to share the fruits of your victories, and your blood and treasure have been expended, not for your own interests, but for the common benefit of others.’ Upon these grounds it cannot be contended to be a right of neutrals, to intrude into a commerce which had been uniformly shut against them, and which is now forced open merely by the pressure of war; for when the enemy, under an entire inability to supply his colonies and to export their products, affects to open them to neutrals, it is not his will but his necessity that changes his system; that change is the direct and unavoidable consequence of the compulsion of war, it is a measure not of French councils, but of British force.”  
The first remark to be made is, that were the intrinsic reasonableness

d thus we are arrived at the true foundation of the principle which has so often varied its attitudes of defence, and when driven from one stand, has been so ready to occupy another. Finding no asylum elsewhere, it at length boldly asserts, as its true foundation, a mere superiority of force. It is right in Great-Britain to capture and condemn a neutral trade with her enemies, disallowed by her enemies in time of peace, for the sole reason that her force is predominant at sea. And it is wrong in her enemies to capture and condemn a neutral trade with British colonies, because their maritime force is inferior to hers. The question no longer is, whether the trade be right or wrong in itself, but on which side the superiority of force lies? The law of nations, the rights of neutrals, the freedom of the seas, the commerce of the world, are to depend, not on any fixt principle of justice, but on the comparative state of naval armaments, which itself may change at every moment, may depend on the event of a battle, on the skill of an admiral, on the tack of the wind; on one of those thousand casualties which verify the admonition, that the battle is not always given to the strong, any more than the race to the swift.

d in his own words.  
“Let it be remembered, therefore, that the question on the part of the belligerent is not, as has been grossly supposed, whether he has a right to interfere with the neutral; but merely whether he cannot prevent the neutral from interfering with him? In other words, whether, when the former extends the bounds of his trade not with but for a belligerent; not only purchases what he wants for his own consumption, or sells his usual peace supply of articles; but sells to him articles which may be easily converted into the means of annoyance; or even turns carrier for his oppressed friend who uses the surplus strength which is thus afforded him against his opponent; whether in such case the other belligerent has no reason to be offended, and to reclaim those rights which the pretended neutral is disposed to deny him. This is in fact the true state of the question.”

“In granting, therefore, the fair and reasonable enjoyment of their privileges to neutral nations, there must always be added the fair and reasonable caution that they use them so as not to hurt the belligerent; and that I may not seem to entrench myself in generals ‘ubi sœpe versatur error,’ I would add that they have certainly no right to use them in any one, the smallest degree more than they did in times of peace, nor even in so great a degree, if such augmented, or the ordinary use of them, bears immediate mischief  
  
to either belligerent. For example, they may increase their purchases to any amount in the belligerent countries, provided their own consumption requires it, and provided they remain domiciled in their own country. But if they persist in carrying, much more, if they extend their faculty of carrying for the belligerent, where the latter was in the habit of carrying before; and if, in consequence, he is enabled to come to the battle, and to stand the shock of war, with augmented strength, which he never would nor could have possessed without it, I see little or no difference between this and an actual loan of military assistance. All the distinction is, that he substitutes his own people in the place of taking foreigners, for every man which the neutral lends to his trade enables him to furnish a man to his own hostile fleets. In other words, it enables him to meet his enemy with undiminished forces, and yet preserve entire his sources of revenue; when, if it was not for this conduct of the neutral, either the forces or the revenue of the belligerent must be diminished.

d author of that defence of the maritime principles of Great-Britain, to deny it the merit of learning, ingenuity, and a vein of candor more than is always found in such discussions. His attention, however, was almost wholly directed to the question whether free ships make free goods, a question not within the limits of this investigation. He has, indeed, a few cursory observations, such as could not be here noticed without going into unnecessary repetitions, in favor of the doctrine that a trade not customary in peace cannot be lawful in war. These observations, he concludes, with one referred to by Mr. Ward as of great force, on the general question between belligerent and neutral nations; namely, “that if this right were admitted, it would be the interest of all commercial states to promote dissentions among their neighbors.”  
If there be any plausibility in this argument, it is certainly all the merit that can be claimed for it. The wars which afflict mankind, are not produced by the intrigues or cupidity of the weaker nations, who wish to remain in peace, whilst their neighbors are at war. They are the offspring of ambitious, and not unfrequently commercial rivalships, among the more  
  
powerful nations themselves. This is a fact attested by all history. If maxims of public law are to be tested, therefore, by their pacific tendency, such maxims, it is evident, must be favored as circumscribe, not the rights and interests of neutral nations, but the belligerent and commercial interests, of their more powerful and warlike neighbors.  
As a further answer to the observations of this noble author, and as a final answer to all the arguments which are drawn from the intrinsic equity or conveniency of this principle, the following considerations must have weight with all candid and competent judges.  
In the first place it may be repeated, that on a question which is to be decided, not by the abstract precepts of reason, but by rules of law positively in force, it is not sufficient to show on which side an intrinsic reasonableness can be traced. It is necessary to shew, on which side the law as in force, is found to be. In the present case, it has been shewn that this law is not for, but against, the British side of the question.  
But secondly, it is denied that if reason, equity, or conveniency, were alone to decide the question, the decision would be different from that which the law in force pronounces on it.  
War imposes on neutral commerce a variety of privations and embarrassments. It is reasonable, therefore, as well as lawful, that neutrals should enjoy the advantages which may happen to arise from war.  
1. In the case of contraband, the articles of which, especially according to the British catalogue, may compose an important branch of exports in time of peace, the commerce of particular nations remaining at peace may suffer material defalcations from the exercise of the rights of war.  
2. In the case of enemy’s property carried by neutral ships, (as Great Britain, at least, understands and enforces the law of nations), a branch of trade more or less important to all commercial nations, and constituting the most profitable branch of trade with some in times of peace, becomes an object of belligerent interruption and confiscation.  
3. In the case of blockades the abridgment and embarrassment to which the trade of neutrals, especially those at a distance, is subjected by war, form other important items of loss on their side. This is a belligerent claim, on which much might be said, if the notoriety of its effects, to say nothing of its extravagant abuses, did not render it unnecessary.  
4. The interruptions, proceeding from searches of neutral vessels on the high seas, the erroneous suspicions and inferences which send them into port for trial, the difficulty of obtaining all the requisite proofs thereon by the claimant, the delays and expences incident to the judicial proceedings, more especially where the trial is at a great distance, and above all when appeals still more distant become necessary, the changes in the state of markets during all these delays, which convert into loss the gains promised by  
  
the expedition, the suspension of the mercantile funds, the heavy sacrifices, and sometimes bankruptcies thence ensuing; all these injuries, which war brings on neutral commerce, taken together, must surely, during war, require a very great weight in the opposite scale to balance them, and the weight of these injuries is sometimes not a little increased by the piracies which a state of war generates and emboldens.  
The injuries, besides, which are here enumerated, are limited to such proceedings as the laws of war may be thought to authorize. To a fair estimate of the evils suffered by neutral commerce, must be added all those abuses which never fail to be mingled with the exercise of belligerent rights on the high seas; the protracted interruptions, the personal insults, the violent or furtive spoliations, with a thousand irregularities, which are more or less inseparable from the proceeding, and which can seldom be so far verified and prosecuted to effect against the wrong-doers, as to amount to a reparation.  
If the evils, brought on neutrals by a state of war, were to be traced to their full extent, a long list of a distinct kind ought moreover to be thrown into the same scale. How many condemnations are made either directly contrary to the law of nations, or by means of unjust presumptions, or abitrary rules of evidence, against neutral claimants? How often and how severely are the neutral appellants aggrieved by measuring the restitution awarded to them, not according to the actual loss, but according to the deficient estimates, or the scanty proceeds of sales, decreed by ignorant or corrupt vice admiralty courts,  
* The character of these courts may be estimated by a single fact stated on the floor of the British House of Commons, 29th April, 1801, that out of three hundred and eighteen appeals, thirty five only of the condemnations were confirmed by the superior court. Notwithstanding this enormity of abuses, and the strong remonstrances against them, no change was made in the courts till about four months before the war was over. They were then put on an establishment somewhat different, but which still leaves them a scourge to the fairest commerce of neutrals.  
in places and under circumstances, which reduce the price to a mere fraction of the value? Examples of this sort might easily be multiplied; but they may be thought of the less weight in the present case, as they furnish a just ground of resort from the ordinary tribunals of justice, to those ulterior remedies, which depend on negotiations and arrangements between the belligerent and neutral governments. But whatever may be the provisions for indemnity, obtained in these modes, it remains an important truth on the present subject, that besides the intermediate disadvantage to neutral traders from the mere delay of diplomatic and conventional remedies, the justice stipulated is always rendered very incomplete, by the difficulties in verifying the losses and damages sustained.  
  
The principle urged against a neutral trade in time of war, not permitted in peace, is the more unreasonable, because it gives to a tribunal established by the belligerent party only, a latitude of judgment improper to be confided to courts of justice, however constituted.

 In answer to the objection made in a Prussian remonstrance against the condemnation of Prussian vessels during the war of 1739, viz. that the Admiralty courts were ex parte tribunals, and their decisions not binding on other nations, the duke of Newcastle, in his letter enclosing the report of the four law officers, observes, “that these courts, both inferior courts and courts of appeal, always decide according to the universal law of nations only; except in those cases where particular treaties between the powers concerned have altered the dispositions of the law of nations.” In the Report itself it is declared, “that this Superior court [Lords of Appeal] judges by the same rule which governs the court of Admiralty, viz. the law of nations and the treaties subsisting with that neutral power whose subject is a party before them;” “that in England the crown never interferes with the course of justice. No order or intimation is ever given to any judge;” that “had it been intended, by agreement, to introduce between Prussia and England, a variation in any particular from the law of nations, and consequently a new rule for the court of Admiralty to decide by, it could only be done by a solemn treaty in writing, properly authorized and authenticated. The memory of it could not otherwise be preserved; the parties interested, and the courts of admiralty, could not otherwise take notice of it.” In the judgment pronounced by Sir Wm. Scott, in the case of the Swedish convoy, [2 Rob. 295] the independent and elevated attributes of his judicial station are painted with his usual eloquence. “In forming that judgment,” says he, “I trust that it has not escaped my anxious recollection for one moment, what it is that the duty of my station calls for from me, namely, to consider myself as stationed here not to deliver occasional and shifting opinions to serve present purposes of particular national interest; but to administer with indifference that justice which the law of nations holds out without distinction to independent states, some happening to be neutral and some to be belligerent. The seat of judicial authority is indeed locally here in the belligerent country, according to the known law and practice of nations; but the law itself has no locality. It is the duty of the person who sits here to determine this question, exactly as he would determine the same question if sitting at Stockholm; to assert no pretension on the part of Great-Britain, which he would not allow to Sweden in the same circumstances; and to impose no duties on Sweden, as a neutral country, which he would not admit to belong to Great-Britain in the same character. If, therefore, I mistake the law in this matter, I mistake that which I consider, and which I mean should be considered, as the universal law upon the question.”

parties, it has ever been deemed proper, that the rules of decision should be as plain and as determinate as possible; in order not only, that they might be the surer guide to those who are to observe them; but also a better guard against the partialities and errors of those who are to apply them.

This question was decided in the first instance by a vice-admiralty court at Ceylon; and will probably be removed to Great-Britain for a re-examination. The case, therefore, will have for its space three quarters of the globe. Through what period of time it may extend, is a problem to be decided.

These are not questions of fancy or of unfairness. They are questions which it has been seen, that the enlightened judge in the British high court of admiralty has himself recognized as involved in the principle for which he contends. But they are questions in their nature improper to be decided by any judicial authority whatever; and in their importance, they are questions too great to be left even to the sovereign authority of a country where the rights of other sovereigns are to be the object of the decision.  
Finally: The belligerent claim, to intercept a neutral trade in war not open in peace, is rendered still more extravagantly preposterous and pernicious, by the latitude which it is now assuming. According to late decisions in the British courts, it is in future to be a rule, that produce of an enemy’s colony, lawfully imported into a neutral country, and incorporated into its commercial stock, as far as the ordinary regulations of a sovereign state can work such an effect, is to be subject on re-exportation to capture and condemnation; unless it can be shewn that it was imported in the preceding voyage, with an intention that it should not be re-exported. Consider for a moment the indignity offered to a neutral sovereign in subjecting the integrity of its internal regulations to the scrutiny of foreign courts, and to the interested suspicions of belligerent cruizers; consider the oppression on the individual traders inseparable from a trial in a distant court, and perhaps an appeal to another court still more distant, where the intention of an antecedent voyage is to be traced through all the labyrinth of mercantile transactions. A neutral vessel goes to sea with a cargo consisting, in whole or in part, of colonial produce. It may be the produce of a neutral colony. It may be the produce of the country exporting it: The United States already produce cotton, sugar, rice, &amp;c. as well as the West Indies. The cruizer does not forget, that the proof will probably be thrown on the claimants; that besides the possibility that it may be a licensed capture, the difficulty of proof may have the same effect in producing condemnation. He recollects also that in the event of an acquittal the costs  
* It is well known to be the practice to favor the activity of cruizers against the colonial trade. Sir William Scott in the case of the Providentia, in which the ship and cargo were restored—2 Rob. 128, says “Cases respecting the trade of neutrals with the colonies of the enemy are of considerable delicacy; and I therefore think it has been properly brought before the court.”  
will, where there is the least color for seizure, be thrown on the claimants; and that, at the worst, he can  
  
only be put to the inconvenience of giving up a few men to take charge of the prize, in exchange for a few others, not unfrequently impressed into the vacancy. In a word, his calculation is, that he may gain, and cannot lose. Will not, under such circumstances, every hogshead of sugar, or bale of cotton, or barrel of rum, &amp;c. be a signal for detention? Could ingenuity devise a project holding out a more effectual premium for the multiplication of vexatious searches and seizures, beyond even the ordinary proportion of condemnations? A project, in fact, more unjust in itself, more disrespectful to neutral nations, or more fatal to the liberty and interests of neutral commerce? Would Great-Britain be patient under such proceedings against her, if she held in her hands, the means of controuling them? If she will not answer for herself, all the world will answer for her, that she would not, and what is more, that she ought not.

there is a mixture of right and fact:  
Each nation ofually allows, or forbids»  
the marine commerce of neutral people  
with its enemy ; either according as it  
is its interelt to preferve the friend-  
fhip of thofe people, or it finds itlelf  
{trong enough to obtain from them  
what it requires. For example; the  
Engli/b and Dutch may fay, without  
ab{urdity, that it is lawful for them to  
do all the ill they can tothe French,  
with whom they are at war, and con-  
fequently, to employ the method the  
mo(t proper to weaken them, which is  
totraverfe andruin theirtrade. They  
fay, itis not reafonable that neutral  
nations fhould enrich themfelves at  
their expence, and by engrolling to  
themfelves a commerce, which the Ex-  
glifo and Dutch want, furnifh the  
French with money to continne the  
war, This feems the rather juft, be-  
caufe Eng/andand Holland commonly  
favour the trade of neutral nations, by  
fuffering them totran{port, and fell, in  
forcign markets, merchandizes of their  
own growth and manufa¢ture. In  
fhort, they fay, that they are wiiling to  
leave them the trade they ufually car-  
ry on, in time of peace, but they can-  
not fee them take advantage of the  
war to extend their commerce, to the  
prejudice of England and Aslland,  
But as this matter of trade and navi-  
gation does not fo much depend upon  
rules founded on a general law, as up-  
on conventions made between particu-  
lar nations, fo in order to form a folid  
judgment of the point in queftion, we  
ought previoully to examine, what trea-  
ties fubfift between the northern crowns  
and England and Holland; and whe-  
ther thefe laft powers have offered the  
former jult and reafonable conditions.  
On the other hand, neverthelefs, if  
the northern princes can maintain their  
trade with France, by fending {trong  
convoys with their fleets, I fee nothing  
to blame in it, provided their veilels  
do not carry contraband poods. The  
Jaws of humanity and equity between  
nations, do not extend fo far as to re-

tain the extenfion of it, as right can  
never be upon the two oppofite fides of  
  
that one people fhould give up its pro-

avarice of meichants is fo great, thar,  
for the imallelt gain, they make no

The Lords Commissioners of Admiralty.  
Extract of the Advtcate General&#x27;s Report,  
dated the \6th March, 1801.  
I have the honour to report that the fen­  
tence of the Vice-admiralty court appears  
to me to be er • neous, and to be founded  
in a mifapprehenfion or mifapplication of  
the principles laid down in the decifion of  
the court of admiralty referred to, without  
attending to the limitations therein contain­  
ed.  
The general principle refpedling the co­  
lonial trade has in the, courfe of the prefent  
war been to a certain degree relaxed in  
conlideration of the prefent flate of com­  
merce. It is now diftinclly underftood, and  
it has been repeatedly i&#x27;o decided by the  
high court of admiralty, and the court ol  
appeal, that the produce of the colonies  
of the enemy maybe imported by a  
neutral into his own country, and  
may be re-exported from thence even  
to the mother country of fuch colony ;  
and in like manner the produce and manu  
failures of the mother country may in thi  
• ireuitous mode legally find their way to thi  
olonies. The direct trade, however, be  
ween the mother country and itscolonii  
as not, I apprehend, been recognifed a«,  
! ::ral either by his majefty&#x27;s government o&gt;  
y his tribunals.  
What is a direct trade, or what amount  
&gt; an intermediate importation into ti  
1 utral country, may fome time be a qnei  
ion of fome difficulty : A general definitio  
•if either, applicable to all cafes cannoi  
  
&#x27; well be laid down. The queftion muft de­  
pend upon the particular circumftances of  
each cafe. Perhaps the mere touching ir»  
the neutral country to take frefh clearances  
may properly be confidered as a fraudulent  
evador), and as, in effedl, the direct trade;  
but the high court of admiralty has exprefs­  
ly decided (and I fee no reafon to expedt  
that the court of appeal will vary the rule)  
that landing the goods and paying the du­  
ties in the neutral country breaks the con­  
tinuity of the voyage, and is fuch an im­  
portation as legaliles the trade, although  
the goods be re-(hipped in the fame veffel,  
and on account of the fame neutral proprie­  
tor, and be forwarded for fale to the mo­

I HAVE the honor to report that  
the fenténce of the Vice Admiraliy  
Court * appears to me to be errone­  
ous, and to be founded in a misappre­  
hension or misapplication of the prin.  
ciples laid down in the deciion of the  
Court of Admiralty referred to, with- .  
out attending to the limitations there­  
in contained. - :  
The genetal principle refpe@ing the  
Colonial Trade, has, in the course of  
the present war, been to acertain des  
gree, relaxed, in consideration of the  
present state of commerce. It is now  
diftinétly understood, and it has been  
repeatedly so decided by the High  
Court of Admiralty, and the Court of  
Appeal, that the produce of the Col­  
onies of the enemy may be imported  
by a neutral into his own country, and  
may be re-exported from thence even  
to the mother country of such colony ;  
and in like manner the produce and  
manufactures of the mother country  
may in the circuitous mode legally  
find their way to the Colonies. The  
dire? trade, however, between the  
mother country and its colonies has  
not, I apprehend, been recognized as  
legal either by His Majesty’s Govern­  
ment or by his T&#x27;ribunals.  
What is a dire? trade, or what a­  
mounts to an infermediate importation  
into the neutral -country, may some  
time be a question of some difficulty :  
—A’ general definition of either, ap­  
plicable to all cases cannot be laid  
down. &quot;The question mult depend  
upon the particular circumstances of  
each case. Perhaps the mere touch­  
ing in ihe neutral country to take  
frefth clearances may properly be con­  
sidered as a fraudulent evasion, and  
as, in effe, the dire/? trade ; but the  
high court of Admiralty has expressly  
decided (and I fee no reason to ex­  
pect that the court of appeal will vary  
the rule) that landing the goods and  
paying the duties in the neutral coun­  
try breaks the continuity of the voyage  
and is such an importation as legali­  
zes the trade, although the goods be  
thipped in the fame veflel, and on ac­  
count of the fame neutral proprietor,  
and be forwarded for sale to the  
mother country or the colony.

hitherto stood by, should. step ‘in, and do that for the Belligerent  
which he.was no longer.able to.do himself ?: To ‘come a little more  
into the detail and application of this argument, let, ys. suppose, as  
was the case with France, a heavy duty upon foreign freight, had  
formed an almost fundamental, lay of her. own, commercial :cade ¢

to an interdiction of ,foreign interference ;, and that, of a sudden,  
while engaged in war, wanting her sailors, poknaniies cates Ips,  
for hostile expeditions, ‘at the same time wanting the pecuniary, a  
other sources of her trade, which would thus be ccihaaaae FA  
applied to nations calling themselves neutral, by taking off this duty,  
or even by bounties, to.carry on this trade. Here is a proof how  
necessary this trade is to. her exigencics, and how impossible is it to  
preserve it, consistently: with her warfare. But-where is the man of  
plain understanding, and uninterested in the question, who would  
not determine, that if the Neutral accepted the offer, that instant he  
interfered in the war? But Neutrals do thus interferg, nay, they arm  
in order to support their interference. Adien, then, to the boasted  
philanthropy of the Neutral, whose great duty 1s to do all he can  
for the re-establishment of peace!—Adieu to those good offices  
which he is sincerel¥ to employ, in order that the injured party in the  
war should obtain satisfaction! For if, according to Hubner’s supe

EXTRACT OF THK ADVOCATE-CFXE-  
RAL’s report, dated MARCH 16,  
1801.  
  
1 have the honour to report, that the  
fentence of the Vice-Admiralty Court  
appears to me erronanus, and to he  
founded in a mifapprehenfioii or mifappli-  
cation of the principles laid down in the  
decifion of the Court of Admiralty re-  
feried to, without attending to the limita¬  
tions therein contained.  
  
The geneial princijile refpefllng the  
colonial trade has, in the cctule of the  
preicnt war, been to a certain degree  
relaxed in confuiciation of the prcler.t  
ftate of ccmmtice. It is now dillindly  
underrtood, and it has been repeatedly lb  
decided by the High Couit of Appeal,  
that the produce of the colonics of tl e  
enemy may he imported by a neutral into  
his own country, and may he re-exported  
from thence even to the mother country  
of fuch colony j and, in like manner, the  
proilucc and manufadures of the mother  
country may, in this circuitous mode,  
legally (ind their way to the colonies.  
The dired trade, however, between the  
mother country and its colonics, has hut,  
  
I apprehend, been recegnifed as legal,  
either by his MajcUy&#x27;s Government, or  
by his tribunals.  
  
What is adiied trade, or what amounts  
to an intermediate importation into the  
neutral country, may feme time t&gt;e a  
quertion of feme dirticulty.—A general  
dcHnition of either, applicable to all cafes,

touching in the neutral country to take  
irefh clearances may properly be confi-  
dered as a fraudulent evafion, ard is, in  
effed, the dired trade, .hut the High

(and I fee no rtalbn to exped that the

“s In granting, therefore, the fair and reafonable enjoyment of their  
privileges to Neutral Nations, there inuft always be added the fair and  
reafonable caution, that they yfe them fo as not to hurt the Belligerent ;  
and that I may not feem to entrench myfelf in generals * ubi fepe

them in any one, the {malleft degree of proportion, more than they did  
in times of peace, nor even in fo great a degree, if fuch augmented,  
or ordinary ufe of them bears immediate mifchief to either Belli-  
gerent. :  
  
«© For example, they may increafe their purchafes to any amount.in  
the Belligerent countries, provided their own confumption require it,  
and provided they remain domiciled in their own country. But if  
they perfift in carrying, much more, if they extend their faculty of  
carrying for the Belligerent, where the latter was in the habit of car-  
rying before; and if, in confequence, he is enabled to come to the  
battle, and to ftand the thock ot war with augmented ftrength, which  
he never would, nor could have poffeffed without it, I fee little or no  
difference between this and an actual loan of military affiftance. All  
the diftinétion is, that he fubititutes his own people in the place of  
taking toreigners; for every man, which the Neutral lends to his trade,  
enables him to turnifh a man to his own hoftile fleets. [n other words,  
it enables him to meet his enemy with undiminifhed forces, and yee

ftood, and it has been repeatedly fo  
decided by the high court of admi-  
ralty, and the court of appeal, that  
the produce of the colonies of the e-  
nemy may be imported bya neutral  
into his own country, and may be  
re-exported from thence even to  
the mother country of fuch colo-  
pny; and in like manner the pro-  
duce and marufactures of the mo-  
ther country may in this circuitous  
mode legally find their way to the  
colonies. The dec? trade, how-  
ever, between the mother country  
and its colonies has not, | appre-  
hend, been recognifed as legal ei-  
ther by his majetty’ Ss government  
or by his tribunals.  
  
What is a dire trade, or what  
amounts to an intermediate impor-  
tation into the neutral country,  
  
may fome time be a queftion of  
  
fome difficulty. A general defini-  
tion of either, applicable to all cafes  
cannot well be laid down, The  
gueftion muft depend upon the par-  
ticular circumfiances of each cafe.  
Perhaps the mere touching in the  
neutral country to take frefh clear-  
ances may properly be confidered  
as a fradulent evafion, and as, in  
effet, the direé? trade; but the high  
court of admiralty has exprefsly de-  
cided (and [ fee no reafon to ex-  
pect that the court of appeal will  
vary the rule) that landing the  
goods and paying the duties in the  
neutral country breaks the conti-

Soon after the commencement of the late war fa ),  
i the first set of instructions.that issued, were framed,  
I not on the exception,of the American war, but on the  
1 antecedent practice, and directed cruisers “ to bring  
in for lawful adjudication, all vessels laden with  
goods, the produce of any colony of Frame, or car­  
r&gt; ing provisions of supplies for the use of any such  
colony.” The relaxations that have since been a­  
dopted, have originated chiefly in the change that  
has taken place, in the trade of that part of the  
world, since the establishment of an independent go­  
vernment on the continent of America. In conse­  
quence of (hat event, American vessels had been  
admitted to trade ill some articles, and on certain  
| conditions, with the colonies both of this country and  
! of France. Such a permission had become a part of  
the general commercial arrangements, as the ordina­  
ri state of their trade in time of peace. The com­  
merce of America was therefore abridged by the  
foregoing instructions, and debarred of the right  
generallv ascribed to neutral trade in time of war,  
that it mav be continued, with particular exceptions,  
on the basis of its ordinary establishment. In conse­  
quence of representations made bv the American go­  
vernment to this effect, new instructions to our  
erniers were issued, 8th January, 1794, apparently  
designed to exempt Amadcan ships, trading between  
their own country, and the colonies of France. Th

Extract of the advocate general&#x27;s re/iorts, dated  
March 16, 1801.  
“ I have the honour to report, tlmt the sentence of  
the \ icc acjiiiuvln court appears to me erroneous  
ami to be founded in a misapplication of the princi­  
ples laid down in the decision of the court of admi­  
ralty referred to, without attending to the limitati­  
ons therein contained.  
The general principle respecting the colonial trade  
has, m the course of the present war, been to a cer­  
tain degree relaxed in consideration of the present  
state of commerce. Jt is now distinctly understood,  
and it has been repeatedly so decided by the high  
court of appeals, that the produce of the- colonies of  
the enemy maybe imported by a neutral into his own  
[ country, and may be re-exported from thence, even  
to ti&#x27;.e mother country or such colonv; and in like  
manner the produce and manufactures of the mother  
country may, in this circuitous mode, legally find  
their way to the colonies. The direct trade however,  
between the mother country au.l its colonies, has not  
I apprehend been recognised as legal, either by his  
majesty’s government or In his tribunal.  
\\ hat is a direct trade, nr whut amounts to an in­  
termediate importation in the neutral country, mav  
sometimes be a question of some difficulty—a general  
definition ot either applicable to all cases cannot lift  
v-cll laid down. The question must depend upon the  
pal lii ulae circumstances ot each case ; perhaps the  
mere touching in the neutral country, to take fresh  
clearances, may properly lie considered as a fraudu­  
lent evasion, and is in effect the direct trade; but  
tile high Li.urt of admiralty has expressly decided!  
(and 1 sec no reason to expect that the court of ap­  
peals wid \ ary the rules) that landing the goods ami  
paying tlie duties in the neutral country, breaks the  
continuity ot the voyage, and is «uch an importation  
as legalizes the trade, although the goods be re-ship­  
ped in the same vessel, and on account of the same  
neutral propi ietors, and forwarded for sale to the*

In like manner, a neutral trade with

Interrupted by the besiegers.  
It is maintained also on one side,&#x27;  
though strongly contested on the other,  
that the property of a nation at Avar, in

trade, as it respects the ship, the cargo,  
or even the individual port of   
tion, was not as free before the Avar, as !  
it is made during the war.  
Fa applying this doctrine, the British  
ir.i entment and courts have not, as yet,  
nded it beyond the trade of ncutivls  
on the coasts, and with the &#x27;colonies &quot;of

limitation is founded in consideration ; of  
expediency only ; and that the doctrine  
is necessarily applicable to every other  
blanch of neutral commerce with a bel­  
ligerent nation, which Avas not open to

und Avhich is taken up by foreign nations  
in time of war only, in consequence of  
the War, which by increasing the rh k  
or by iii-idiiift other employment for the  
vessels and sea men of the nation itself,  
invites neutral trailers into th  
channels. In both cases, the neutral  
intervention may be said to result liom  
the pressure of the war; and in. bokh  
. the effect is the same to the bel­  
ligerent ; since In both, neutrals carry  
on for him, a trademuxiiiary to his pros­  
perity and his revenue, which he could  
no longer carry on for himself; and  
which at the same time, by liberating  
his naval faculties for the purponi  
war, enable him to carry on the war,  
with more vigor and effect. These in­

fupported, and the well-earned reputation of  
its reputed author, would in no long timecon­  
vev it into almod every man’* hand, in the  
mod didant corners of the date.  
The author begins with a general rule, that  
a nation not engaged in the war remaining in  
the fame relations of amity and of commercial  
purfuita, with each of the belligerent nations,  
as exidrd prior to the war, it would feem that  
the war could noteffedt the intercourfe between  
the netdral and either of the belligerent nati­  
ons. The fafety of the belligerents however,  
his introduced a few exceptions to this gene­  
ral rule. “ Thus all injlrumentt of avnrt going  
into the h.v &gt;f one belligerent nation, may  
be iutercep;&lt; d, on the high fias, bv its adver­  
  
l-ary. In like manner, a neutral trade with a  
place .actually befieged is liable to be interrupted  
Ity the b &#x27;fieger* I; is maintained alfo on ot.«r  
fide, though fhvnnrly rontefled on the other,  
that the property of a notion at war, in a neu­  
tral fbifi, maybe frizcd and condemned by the  
enemy of that nation. To thefe exceptions, O.  
Britain has undertaken to add another as impor­  
tant as it is new. Bite afferts a right to inter­  
cept the trade of neutrals with her enemies, in  
all cafes w here the trade as it refpec&#x27;ts the fliip,  
the cargo, or even the individual port 6f def­  
dnntion, was not as frvt before the war, as it is  
made daring the war.&quot;  
“ In applying this doftrine, tHe Brmft, government  
and court* have not, us yet, extended it beyond the  
trade of neutrals on the coafls, artd with the colonies  
of enemies. But iris ni.inifeft, that this limitation is  
founded in mud deration* of expediency otsly ; and  
that fh- dtvflrine is nec&lt; dsrily applicable to every ci­  
ther branch of neutral commerce with a belligerent  
nation, which wa« not open to the fame nation in  
time of peace. It tncht indeed with equal r«afon  
W extended further. It might be applied to the cafe  
  
| of a trade tega!!y perm-led idfor.dgn nations in time  
of peace, bur tux atfw&#x27;l carried on hy them in time  
of peace ; hecaufe in tuf» of peace actually carried &lt;*u  
by the nation itfelf; an I which ic taken up by foreign  
nation* in time of war;only, in conf-quci.ee of ciiu  
war, which, by incr.alifij the rifle or by iinding o­  
ther employment for t|« veflt-ls cml fea&#x27;ncti of the  
nation itfelf, invites neutral traders into the deferted  
channels. In bodt ca|:% the neutral intervention  
may belaid to r«!&#x27;uit frpn the prefTure of the war;  
arid in Ijotn cafes, the ided is the fame to the belli­  
gerent; fince in both tteutrjlii carry on for hint,  
a trade auxiliary to his » nfperity and his revenue,  
&quot;j1; y he could no iou^r carry on for himfelf; and  
Wine ’ :;t the fault time, by liberating his naval facul­  
ties for the ptirpnfes of s-nr, enable him to carry on  
i the war, with more \”&lt;-&gt;r »nd tif, ct. Thefe infer­  
  
slices cannot he impaired by any found difliudtinn  
between u trade of for-sgittrs with colonies, and a  
trade of foreigners with the ports «&gt;f the mother coun­  
try. Colonies more efpetiaiiy when they are alto­  
gether fu&#x27;ijrft to tiie fame authority which governs  
the parent ftate, are integral parts of the lame do­  
minion or empire. a trade, therefore, between a  
colonial port and a port of the parent or principal  
bate, is precilely of the time nature with a trade  
between one and another port of the latter: and a  
trade between a colony all i a foreign port is, in tike  
manner, pucifely the fan c with t.&#x27;ie trade between a  
foreign port aud the partut country; which is only  
a in-.rr mnfidtr.ihie, as a colony may be a lefs con­  
udcraole part, of tile fame country or empire.**  
Alter fume preliminary remarks, the author pro­  
ceeds to examine the fundamental queftion ; “ whe­  
tner it be a part of the law of nations, that a trade  
ordinarily (hut in time of peace, and opened to neu­  
trais in time of war, account of the war, is liable,  
a* much as a trade in contraband of war or with a  
blockaded port, to capture and condemnation. It  
will not he overlooked, that the principle, as thus  
laid down, does not extend to any of the cafes, where  
anew trade, though opuned during a war, is not o­  
pened or, ,-f the w.ir, hut on confideratioiis  
which would produce the fame meafure, if no war  
exiited : from which follows another importunt-ob­  
lervation, that talcing into view the probable occur­  
renceof fuch confide!ations, the dill greater proba­  
bility nfa mixture of fuch with confldcrations deriv­  
ed from the war. the imraffibility of diOinguifhing  
the proportion of th-fe different ingredients in the  
mixture, with the etfhlent difndvautage of reiulcriutr  
mure complicated, inltead of Amplifying, a rule of  
condobetween independent nations! to be expound­  
ed and enforced by one of the parties themfelves, it  
would feem to re,p,ire no great effort ,.f candor, to  
*.i no.% ec.ge the powerful obje&amp;ion fn pra*5licet to  
tuch a principle, were it really embraced by the  
molt Ipcciou? theory.”  
The author has trieJ the principle in qttef­

To this lift are tobcalfo added all thetrea- 1  
ties and conventions, entered into in the years !  
1780 and 1800 ; the two aeras of an armed mu- &#x27;  
trality. To this lift too “of the conventional  
monuments of Europe” we may addthe“tef­  
timony oft he only nation at once civilized and  
  
iMocpciuicni mi me American liemifpherr. The  
U. States have or have had treaties with France,  
Holland, Sweden, Ruflia, Spain and G. Bri­  
tain, and in all of thefe except that with Great  
Britain, they have positively maintained the  
principle that neutrals may trade freely between  
neutral and belligerent ports, and between one  
belligerent port and another, whether under  
the fameor different jurifdiftinrts.’* The trea­  
ty with G. Britain was filent. « It merely  
omitted a Stipulation on the fubjedt, as it did on  
many others, contained in other treaties.”  
2. The lilt of treaties to which G. Britain was  
a party, confirms the fame opinion. The trea­  
ties with Sweden in I6j», 11&gt;.*6, and 1&lt;&gt;C1, fe­  
cure the right of trading with the enemies of  
the other, with the ufual exceptions of con­  
traband and blockade. A treaty with Spain  
in 1667, with the United Provinces in the  
fime year, with Denmark in 1 coo, and 1670,  
i in the latter of which the trade of colo­  
nies is for the firfl.time introduced into treaties,  
all contain fimilarstipulations. In a declaration  
of the fame date with the marine treaty of  
Dec. 1, 1674, with the U. Provinces, it is Hat­  
ed as the true meaning of the latter, that the

Tfcus fto&lt;xl the admiralty law in Oreat-Britain as  
announced by Britifh tribunals, and officially commu­  
nicated by the Britiih Cabinet, to the neutral world.  
So it had continued to ftaud, as a pledge and lafegunrd  
to neutrals, conforming theinfelvrsto it, from the dates  
of thofe authorities, the laft of which it as far back as  
the fpriug of the year 1801.  
With what aftoniftiment, then, rouft the neutral  
world now learn, from the deci.ion of Sir William  
Stott on the 2&amp;d July, I SO.5, that, according to the  
rule of lav.- juft laid down, after much deliberation, by  
the lords of appeals “ the circmr.ftantcs of landing  
the goods, or fecuring the duties do not furnifh com­  
plete evidence of the termination of the voyage and  
that without this complete evidence, derived from the  
Original intention of the importing voyage, the voyage  
from the neutral port will be treated as the continu­  
ance of the voyage from the coleny to the mother  
touhtfy.  
  
i his political change in the judicial rules of con­  
demnation, admits no other fatisfi&amp;ory, than a com­  
mercial explanation ; for the lofs of character, which  
it induces, is a greater (acrifice than could he made to  
tVie cupidity of pruizer*, or the value of their prizes  
to the public.  
The whole conrfe, indeed, of modification* pnrfued  
Vy theinftruiHions,and by the decifions of the courts  
_ .as they appear from day to dav. can leave no doubt  
that the primary ohi&#x27;ft with Great-Britain has been  
to tran-fer to herfeir as large n lharc as pofiible «Tthe  
commercial advantages yielded by the colonies of her  
Rneniic*. An ahfolute monopoly was emlnrrxfled by  
the imdiftihle preterfinns of neutral countries; more  
efpscially of tl e United States, whofe neighborhood  
and habits of intercourfe, together with other conli­  
deiat:on?,forbade a perfevrratice in the origuial at­  
tempt to exclude them. They were accordingly the  
firft of the neutral siat ions towards which a relaxation  
svas afforded. The relaxation, after confiderahle ds­  
lay, was extended, by the iuftru&#x27;ftion of 17113, to the  
neutral nation* of Europe. That inftru&amp;ioii v/as  
founded on a cotupromife between the inttreft and the  
jirudence of Great-Bi itain. It permitted neutral 11a­  
tions to trade threatiy with the colonies of her ene­  
mies; without trading in colonial productions with  
one another ; and permitted all of them to carry  
^K&gt;fe pndudtious Jiredly to Great-Britain. This ar­  
rangement was mrnifeftly calculated to limit the im­  
portations of each neutral country to the amount of  
itsow.’ cot fiiniption; and cenf-&#x27;quenrly to turn the  
itn&#x27;iienfe reftdue of colonial wealth, through neutral  
veiT-ls into her own market ; whence it might be  
difperfed, under her own regulations, to the neutral  
countries of Europe having no direeft commerce with  
the Weft-Indies, and even to the belligerent nations  
whofe commerce with their refpetSive colonies ihe  
has as completely dtftroyed, as ihe has their com­  
merce with foreign countries. The arrangement was  
lpe&lt; ious, but proved to he deceptive. It was expect­  
ed that the expence and delay of a circuitous trade  
through the United States would prevent importati­  
ons and re-expcnations, interfering with the pro­  
jrdted trade diredUy from the Weft-Indies to nerfclf;  
and as long as this expectation was in any degree in­  
dulged, the right pf re-exportation w as admitted, tho’  
rchuS.intly.both by the government and the courts.  
Experience, however, finally flit wed, that the activi­  
ty, the capital, and the economy employed by the  
American traders, overpowered the difad vantages iu­  
ndrm to the circuit through the ports of the United  
Urates; and fecured to them the profits of fupplying  
Europe with the colonial productions of her enemies.  
In proportion as this unforefeeii operation difdofed it­  
hlf. the coaimc* ciat jc&amp;Ioufyof Cre.u-Britain be&lt;nui to  
take alarm- Ohlkitfliotu were to be thrown in the  
*ay of importations. Re-exportations were feen  
with growing difrontent. The idea of continuity, by  
Vth.ch two voyages were cmifolidated into one, came  
into vogue. The Vice-Admiralty courts, regardlefs  
of,the liuitrior decifions in England, would not allow  
that the lauding of a cargo, and (laying the duties,  
prettfted it againft condemnation. At length ap­  
p-rared tie frnterue of Sir If&#x27;m. Scott, above cited,  
carrying imoeffeift the conffrui9ion of the inferior  
courts, at having been deliberately famSioned hy the  
lairds of Appeal. The doilrine eftahliftied by that  
derifion has been followed hy other decifions, and dic­  
ta, at firft requiring the re-exportxtinn, in another  
fhip. then a prcviousf.de of the articles .in the neutral  
market,thert other condition*, one after another, as  
they went found nfeccfTury ; till it is finally under­  
llrod. that no precautions whatever are to bar the  
cruiztrs from fufpeaing, nor the courts from feruti­  
»’izingfthe intention of the original importer, and that  
the proaf of this intention not to re-export the arti­  
cles i&lt; to fall on thec’aimanr. To fill up the mea­  
fure of judicial delpotifm, thefe wanton innovations  
on* now extended to v. lftU returning front the belli  
grrent mother countries, as well as to thofe going thi­  
thtr from the United S&#x27;ates; with the addition of de­  
iuzii.&#x27;.- of prn:.f never before heard of in prize courts,  
on points Utterly unknown to the law of nations.  
Thefe unexampled and vetatinxsproce dings rrani­  
fsftly have in vie.v the entire oifiruHiw of colonial re­  
«&lt;u»rt* from the II. Stare* ; and it would be more  
e mdiJ in Great-Britain, if not me re juft, to give puh

parture fnrn that policy, into a new pro,if, and even

C-dunirs hi thr Weft-Indie* and thufe of her enemies;  
and her enemies thenifelve* are invited to enter into

fr-y carrying colonial produce dirrftly from the co­  
J-,.. - to Great-Britain, the commercial views of  
Ore it-Britain are anfwered by the fubftitution of a­  
nothi-r channel through her own colonies; with the

ail tbe reproach of cultivating an avowed commerce

vy council, of Auguft S, 1805, that the trade with  
the fettlements and iftands belonging to the enemy, in  
America and the VVcfl-lndies, is to be carried on thro*  
the medium of the llritiQi free ports in the Weft-In­  
dies, and not otbem &#x27;ft.  
The fyOeni uf Great- Britain may, therefore, now  
be corfidercd a* announced to all the world, without  
difguife, and by the moftfolemn arts of her govern­  
ment. Her navy having deftroyed the trade of her  
enemies, as well between the mother countries and  
their colonies, as between the former and neutral coun­  
tries ; and her courts, by putting an end to re-expor­  
tations from neutral countries, reducing the importati­  
ons into thefe, to the mure amount of their own con­  
fumption; the iminenfefurp’us of produrtions accu­  
mulating in the Anierjcan pnflrffiorM «f her enemies  
can find no outlet but through the free ports provided  
for it; nor any other market than the Brit&#x27;Ih mar­  
ket, and thofe to which Ibe finds it far her iutereft to  
diftributc it; with a view to which, (he not only al­  
lows her enemies to trade with her polTt flions, but al­  
lows her own fubjerts to trade with her enemies. And  
thus, in defiance as well other treat- n laws and of  
her trade laws, as of the right* uf neutrality, under  
the law of nations, we find her, in the juft and em­  
phatic language of the Prefident, “ taking to herfelf,  
by an incmiGttency at which reafun revolts, a com­  
merce with her owi enemy, which (he denies to a  
neutral, on the ground of its aiding that enemy in the  
war.’ 1  
But let us return for a moment to the feries of in­  
ftrttrtiors of which an hiftorica! review hat been taken  
■—an&lt;l advert t« fome additional lights in which the  
itiJici.il coiillrir.fiion and application of them prefeut  
the comlurt of Great-Britain.  
Brior to tho orders of November 6, 1793, the ge­  
neral principle furbidding tu neutrals a trade opened  
to them during the scar, mu ft. if it be a principle of  
the law of nations, aa afirrted by Great-Hritaio, have  
been die rule of Admiralty decifion*. Accordingly, it  
appear*, by -I Rob. Appendix p. J t, that condemna­  
tions i:i cafes prior to tliut date were, in the court of  
Appeals, made to reft on that principle.  
The orders of Bfovumber «, 1793, defignated for  
the operation uf the principle, the trade with the co­  
lonies of the enemy ; as well the trade to, a* the trade  
from, them.  
The orders of January, 1791, exprefsly revoking  
the orders of November. 1 793, defignated for capture,  
rbe trade oiilyy&gt;«»» tbt Wif India IJuih.Ii of the ene­  
my, and bound dirertly to Europe.mily.  
1 he order* of January, 1798, revoking exprefsly  
tbe order* of January, 17‘H, defignated for capture  
the trade from the iflands or fettlements of the ene- i  
mies, oiredlly to any. port in Europe ; c-xstepting what  
might be bound to Britiih port*, or to the ports of  
, the county to which the neutral veffeU Ihould be­  
I lo,,P&#x27; . .  
  
W Ithout entering into a variety of minute quefli­  
ona growing out of the v&amp;rieJ and very inaccurate  
cxprtflioas in which the order* are penned, federal of  
very great importance occur, in expounding and ap­  
plying the rule* laid down.  
The firft queftinn is, whethefthe firft order of 1703,  
which made •&lt;&gt; exprefs reference to th*1 general prin­  
ciple, and which wai limited to the colonial branch  
of the enemy’s trade, was to be underftood as merely  
a lpecificatioO of certain cafes to which the general  
principle was applicable, leaving the general princi­  
ple iu force as to ail unfpecified cafe* ; or whether  
this fpecificarion of certain cafes was to be underftood  
a* implying a legalisation of cafes unfpecified.  
The queftinn arifes, alfo, under the fuecefliv* or­  
ders, each of them revoking the order* immediately  
preceding, whether it was to he underftood, that the  
fpecificarion of certain cafes did, or did not, legalize  
the cafe* omitted iu the fame order, bat fpecified in  
the order* preceding.  
The more obvious conftrudlion of the original or­  
der, even, feemt to be. rather that it was meant to de­  
fine the only cafes to which the general belligerent  
I claim was to be applied, than that it was meant  
merely to notify the claim in thofe particular cafes ;  
u . lairn not me/* requiring D eification in thofa cafe*,  
| than in the cafes it*t notified.  
With refped* to the ord.-rs of pofterror dates, the  
la.r conft.ru£1 ion implies, that the belligerent claim  
was narrowed, firft, by all the difference between the  
ordersof 1799 and thofe of 1794 ; and finally, by all  
the difference between the orders of 1794, and thofe  
of 1798.  
Taking the whole together under thefe eonftruc­  
fiono, the application of the general principle of cap­  
ture was roftri-fted by tliefe orders to the trade of  
neutralsfrom the colonies of enemies, Jirefily to ports,  
other than their own rrfpeliivc port, and the Brit-ft  
ports, and coufequeutly there remained exempt from  
capture:  
1st. The coafting trade, and every branch of trade  
not colonial*  
Od. The trade from any neutral cotmtry, to bellige­  
rent colonies.  
9d. The trade by neutrals from any belligerent  
country to its owu colonies, and to the colonies of a­  
nother belligerent country.  
4th. 1 lie tiadtt between belligerent colonies, whe­  
ther belonging to the fame or to different belligerent  
countries. °  
Applying this rule of implication to the two orders  
only of 1 79 1 and 1798; and admitting thofe of I79S  
not to have fuperceded, by implication, the claims to  
capture in caft* not therein fpecified, there will he  
no ether exception to the relaxations or exemption*  
juft eui merafed in favor of neutral commerce, but  
the coafting trade, and other trades not colonial, to  
which Great Britain has applied, or may choofe to  
apply, the general principle.  
In general the high court of aJmiralty feem*, by  
applying theaffumed principle ro the coafting trade,  
r.i have, purfued that conftruiflion of the origmal or­  
der of 1799, which left the general principle in force  
us 10 cafes not fpecified in it; and to have con­  
fide rr.d the relaxations in tho fuccci-ding orders of  
1794 and 1798, as referring folely to the colonial  
trade.  
There appears, however, at on time to have been  
any clear and fixed opinion in th* court, with refpe^l  
to the illegality and penal coufequences of the coaft­  
ing trade.  
  
rev/ ca.rs are reported, perhap* few have oemr­  
ed, of difcuffiona relative to thi» branch of trade. Jn  
1 Rob. p. 104, the fubjedl i&gt; incidentally brought  
into view, in a cafe where a French vedel had beer,  
purchafed. The dodlrlne held by the judje is wx.  
preffed a, follow, : “ We certainly do allow it [the  
“ P&#x27;Tchafe] but only to per^n. conducing themfelve,  
“ a fair neutral manner, 5cc. befi.le,, thi, vefl&#x27;el

M picion again(l a neutral claim ; and the plunging

Here, not the coaflmg trade iffelf, but the prefnmu­

jffotina of animj(lvrrfi«n.  
hi the cafe of the Speculator, the fame idea prefeot,  
Ufclf.2 r  
’Flvt Emanuel 3 was itfelf the cafe of the coaflinv  
trade. In this cafe the judge dcfcantcd with great en­

mg trade. •• Can there he deferibed” fay, he “ a

from the authorities here cite-, that a couUmg trade,  
iu the produce of the cou«iy, if carried not on  
freight, b it at property begging to the neutral  
owurrof the (hip, i» fuhjeA •&gt; any penalty. This •  
indulgence to the voafiiug, a d rigor towards the co- I  
lonial trade, it it to be eipLmcd by the fertility of j  
the one, and the little value if the other, as a fource i  
of capture and commercial irofit, or in what other  
way ?  
&quot; iih refpedt to the orders if ’91 and &#x27;98, and the ;  
colomal trade, it appe-trs to lave been iu general un­  
dcriiood, that they were to h« con(lruedasfucc^. -r­  
ly enlarging the trade of nentr.L with the cnloti. j of  
enemies, in the manner and o the extent above ex­  
plained.  
The dilemma was indeed inavoidable: either thr  
orders were to be confidtvef as relaxations, (and if  
relaxations at all, i» that extent) cr as leaving the  
general principle in force in cifes not fpecified in the  
orders, and therefore as no relaxation* at all.  
1 his latter deciiion would have given a charatRer  
of mockery to the profefiinX’ ard para-le of making, in  
their orders, fo many facrifitcs of belligerent rights  
to a fpirtt of moderation and amity towards neutrals.  
The tormer fide of the JBeamia, therefore, was  
uecefi&#x27;arily taken. The orders, th-.fe of’ydand ’93  
at lead, were relaxations.  
As relaxations however in the extent required by  
an obvious and cuid&#x27;ifient interpretation, the door, ri­  
pened to neutral commerce with the belligerent colo­  
nies, was found to be wider than was compatible ei­  
ther with the illicit fis of Britilb commerce, the avi­  
dity of Britilb crullers, or the probable intentions of  
the Britifii government.  
What was to be the remedy ? The firfi fried was  
that of (hutting the door gradually, by tire dint of con­  
firuClioas, as may be feen by tracing the colonial ca­  
fes adjudged by Sir William Scott, and reported by  
Robinfin, and the decifionsof the Lords of Appeals  
refet red to by the reporter.  
The talk was afl&#x27;uredly nor a little difficult, of which  
there is the drongeft. demon drat ion in the crooked and  
eoart aditflory realonings and decrees, info which it  
forced the very eminent talents of the judge who  
prefides in the high court of admiralty.  
In addition to the evidence already prefented, take  
the following companion between his rule of con­  
firudion in the cafe of the Providential and the  
rule cf coaftruction in the cafe of the Emanuel,.5  
  
In the former cafe, Auguft 16, 1799, he fthfcrves,  
“ the firft inftru&amp;ions were to bring in all ihipi whch  
“ had been trading with any colony of the enemy :  
“ but this country afterwards recoded fro?n thofe di­  
&quot; redions; and the fecond orders were to bring in  
“ all fhips laden with the produce of the Weft­  
“ India iilatids, earning din-lily from the port* of the  
“ faid ifl.it-.4s to any port in Europe. 1 cannot but  
“ confider this as an abandonment rif the former law,  
“ [inftru&amp;ion] and I cannot bur think thai a cmifer  
“ taking thisinftrudion, in utn-unHitn n&gt;Hl tbofe giv­  
“ en before, extft bai-e inferred that it wa* no longer  
“ the intention of government to bring in, and much  
“ lefstoconfifr.ite.&quot; [was there room forth:* difthic­  
tion?] « cargoes of Weft-Iudia produce, u.tbfi can  
“ inZ tofomefort in Europe : this w a* followed or in­  
ftiudioos now in force, which direbt tl&#x27;.e bringing  
“ in nf all veflels laden with the produce of i lie French  
“ and Spanifb fettlements, coming from the port* of  
“ fuch fettlements to any port of Europe, oth&lt; r than  
“ fhe pons of that country to which the vtfTel he­  
“ longs. It is certainly not laid down in the nega­  
“ live that they fhall not bring in fuch vtfTel* us are  
“ coming from fuch fettlements to their own port*;  
“ but loan ing at tic farmer injfrufiiin, I think it was&#x27;  
“ a ftrong admonition to cruifers not to bring in fuch  
“ fhips, and l believe it hat-been generally l&lt;&gt; under*  
“ flood and aded upon by them { and in this court  
“ cargoes brought/»o*i* Surrinam to ports in Europe  
“ to which the vt-fiel* belonged, have beeH uniformly  
“ reftored on proof of the n-utrality of the property.”  
The reafonirg here is plain and juft. The firft  
inftrudions dclignated for capture the colonial trade,  
without diftinguifhiug betwe n Europe and Ameri­  
ca : the fecond defignatrd the trade to Europe only :  
therefore, by fair inference, the trade to America  
wat exempted from capture.  
Again, the fecond orders defignated for capture  
the trade te Europe : the third orders defigr.atcd ihe  
trade to ports of Europe not being of Great Britain cr  
of tbc country otvning the -veffrl: therefore by fair in­  
ference the trade t« Great’ Britain and to countries  
owning the veffels, was exempted from capture.  
In the Emanuel, November 7, 1799, the cafe w»*  
that of a neutral (hip t;sken on a voyagu laft from  
France to a French colony. According to the rea­  
fouing of Sir William Scott, juft qnnted, the inevi­  
table inference ought to have been that the voya-e  
was legal. •  
  
The brft mltructions defignated for capture the  
trade to Mi from the colonies. Both the fecond anti  
third defignated fer capture the trade only from ihe  
colonies; therefore, according to that reafonmg, the  
trade to the colonies, was exempted from capture.  
Hear nevertheless the realouing employed by the  
judge himlelf in this cafe.  
After combating the neutral right to trade with the  
colonies of an enemy, hy argument* applicable, in  
principle, as well to a trade between neutral ports and  
the colonies, as to a trade betwuui the mother coun­  
try and its colonies; he proceeds to ftate, in anf*er  
to all pleas for a r.eutral trade from the mother coun­  
try t» its colonies, “ that the true rule to this court is  
** the text of the inftruAions; wh it is not found  
“ therein permitted, is ttriderllood to he prohibited  
“ tipou this plain principle,- that the colony trade is J  
“ generally prohibited, ar.d that whatever is notfpe­  
“ cially relaxed, continue* in a ftate of intei didl ion. ”  
Now as what is net permitted, not fpiciaH y relaxed is  
hy the inftruriioo to continue prohibited, the qoeftion  
to be deciJed is, what it is that is permitted, or lj&gt;e  
daily relaxed by the infirudlions? Is it what is pofi­  
tively and exprefsly permitted or relaxed ? &#x27;1 hen  
there is no permiflijn or relaxation at all; for every  
thing pofitive and exprefs in the inrtrutSiorf is for the  
capture, not for the ptrmiifion or relaxation. Is it to  
be a permifiioo &lt; r relaxation implied and inferred from  
a pofitive and fpecified prohibition in one order, and  
an omillion of that or of a p-&gt;rt of that prohibition,  
in a fuccecdmg order ? Then the neutral trade from  
a belligerent country to its colonies, which was prohi­  
bited in the order of I79t&gt;, and omitted in the (tr­  
iers of 1794 ar.d 1703, was as much permitted, as  
fperially relaxed, as the trade from a neutral country  
to the colonies of an enemy, ispermi.ted or relaxed by  
the omiftion ill the order* of 179t and’93, to prohi­  
bit the trade /• the colonies, which as well as the  
trade from the colonies, was pofitiveiy and fpccially  
prohibited by the previous order of 1793; or to re­  
cur to the reafoning of Sir William Scott, in the for­  
mer cale of the Providentia, as much permitted or  
relaxed as the trade from the colonies going not to  
Europe, was inferred to b-t fo from the order of J 791.  
taken in conjunflion with the order of 1793; the or­  
der of ’93 having prohibited the rrad* from the colo­  
nies generally, and the order of *9f having omitted to  
prohibit more of the trade from the coiociev than  
what was hound to f«me port in Europe.  
The judge concludes with detiaring, “ I fee no fa­  
vorable diflinriion between an outward and return  
voyage. I ennfider the intern of the iyiftrudioo to  
apply equally to both communications, though the re­  
turn voyage is the only fine fperially mentioned.”  
What favorable dlflindion, then, could the judge  
fee between the outward and thv returu voyage, in a  
trade between a neutral country, and the colonics of  
an enemy.more than between the two voyages to  
Spain, a mother country,and the colonies t Is not the  
return voyage the only one fyeial/y mentioned, whe­  
ther the iiiftru&amp;ion be applied to thv former trade or  
to the latter trade ? This is fvlf evident. Either  
then he n-.oft admit the difti-iikinn in both, and fay  
that the return voyage only being fpesitdly mention­  
ed, the onward vny;qje is in both trades permitted ;  
or he muft rejeel the diftinriion in both, and fay, that  
the outward voyage, tho’ the return voyage only  
he fperially mentioned, is prohibited in both. A dif­  
ferent (nurfe however was purfued. &#x27;f lu: inflruriion  
was applied to the outward- voya ;e in the neutral  
trade Iroui the mother country to the colony, without  
being foundered as applicable to the outward vpvage  
its the trade from tbc stsitil cvip.try t« a colony.  
  
damnation. Whether th&lt;‘.( i» to be its future def­  
tiny, as lias happened to Jfome other brancht’s o&#x27;  
commerce, whiiie it was equally precluded hy le­  
gal detiftons and even off: oil aJLrvmts, is among the  
arcana of the admiralty cabinet of Great Britain.  
-The judgment in this cafe.. it is to be obferved, did  
not go beyond the condemnation of the goods. &quot;1 he  
veflfvl was reftored, but with a forfeiture of freight  
and expences.  
By degrees, however, with the aid of alleged fraud,  
; of filfe u« ft mat ion, and of contraband in the outward  
! voyages, the fhip a-- well as the cargo were brought  
I within the rules of condemnation in the high court of  
J admiralty. The drrifion of the lord* of appeal has fi •  
ni.lly t flcbliftied, in the cafe of a voyage from a Span­  
ilh colony to a neutral, but forbidden port it; Europe,  
that any illegal trade of neutrals with the colonies ol  
an e temy forfeits both Clip ami cargo, (tj)  
Other examples might l.e drawn Irom the proceed­  
ing* in the Britith courts of admiralty, to illuftru’e  
the cnofou&amp;ivc return towards the ^nenl principle  
which had been mitigated by fucciflive inflrudlioua,  
and the .• lomalmis and entangled deciftons, which have  
been employed for the purpnfe. Tiicfe illuftratioti!.  
cannot be here Dtiriu’d, without ton great an additi­  
on to the prolixity which has already be eh incurred.  
It will only therefore be remarked generally ; ftrfi  
that the com fe of proceedings, as they relate to the  
coaling, and different branches of the colonial trad*.-;  
to the grounds on which theie have been interdicted&#x27;  
to neutrals; and to the penalties attached to brea­  
ches of the interdictions, compofe a labyrinth for  
which no concatenation of principles, no thread of  
reafanipg whatever, affords a clue: Secondly, that  
conftruAive dvcifions, as appears i:i the laft volume  
of Rohsnfon’*reports, have not only reftored, in a  
great measure, the operation of the general principle ;  
but have introduced collateral principles, greatly ex­  
tending the mifciiiefs of its operation.  
Whilft all the conlideratior.s therefore which origi­  
nally led to the examination of this principle, ate ac­  
quiring additional force, it is fortunate that fo’ irr&lt;-ftfti.  
ble a teftiniony againft its legitimacy, ft.r.vld have  
been furnifhed by the coiidutft of Great-Britain her­

it the  
duty of every American citizen, alive to the honour  
. qn&lt;j interest of.his country, to form precise ..ml deft.  
ideas .respecting it, that he.in^y be qualified to  
determine i#hat me ifures it way be proper to adopt  
to tmtinjurite which might otherwise be oppres­  
  
*Ire. The discharge of this duty,tv ill be greatly fa­  
eil.tatcd by the perusal of tVm tract, rr» which thw  
subject is discussed in a calm, able and comprehen­  
sive maimer.  
Its length forbids the giving it entire. We shr.l&#x27;  
occasion.&#x27;1 y, however, offer an extract, calculated to  
awaken publick attention. It commences as follows:  
In times of peace among all nations, their com­  
mercial intercourse is under no other restrictions  
than what may be imposed bv their respective laws,  
or their mutual compacts. No one or more nations  
can justly controul the commerce between any two or  
more of the others.  
When war happens between any two or more nnli­  
onx, a question arises, in what respect it can affect  
the commerce of nations not engaged in the war ?  
Between the nations not engaged in the war, it is  
evident that the commerce cannot be affected at all  
by a war between others.  
  
As a nation not engaged in fhe war remains in the  
same relations of amity and of commercialI pursuits,  
with each ot the belligerent nations, as existed prior  
to the war, it would seem that the war could not af­  
fect the intercourse between the neutral and either of  
the belligerent nations: and that the neutral nation  
might treat and trade with either, or both the belli­  
gerent nations, with the same freedom as if no war  
, had arisen between them. This, as the general rule,  
is sufficiently established.  
Hut inasmuch as the trade of a neutral nation with  
a belligerent nation might, in certain special cases,  
affect the safety of its antagonist, usage, founded on  
the principle of necessity, 1ms admitted a few ex­  
ceptions to the general rule.  
- ^IUS&gt; all instruments of war, going into the hands  
of one belligerent nation, may be intercepted, on the  
high seas, by its adversary.  
In like manner, a neutral trade with a place actu­  
ally besieged, is liable to be interrupted by the besie­  
gers.  
It is maintained also on one side, though strongly  
contested on the other, that the property of a nation  
at war, in a neutral ship, may be seized and condem­  
ned by the enemy of that nation.  
f*o these exceptions, Gre.it Britain has underta­  
ken to add another, as important as it is new. She  
asserts a right to intercept the trade of neutrals with  
her enemies, in all cases, where the.trade, as it res­  
pects the ship, the cargo, or even the individual port  
of destination, was not as free before the war, us it is  
made during the war.  
In applying this doctrine, the British government  
anti courts have not, as yet, extended it beyond the  
trade of neutrals on the coasts, and with the&#x27; colonics  
of enemies. But it is manifest, that this limitation is  
founded on considerations of expediency only ; and  
that the doctrine is necessarily applicable to every  
other branch of neutral commerce with a belligerent  
nation, which was not open to the same nation in  
time ot peace. It might indeed with equal reason he  
extended f. rther. It might be applied to the case of  
a trade legally permitted to foreign nations in time of  
peace, but not actunHy earned on bv them in time of  
peace p because in time of peace actually carried on  
&gt;y the nation itself: and which is taken up by foreign  
nations in time of war only, in consequence of the  
war, which by increasing the risk or by finding other  
employment tor the vessels and seamen of the nation  
Ubclfy invites neutral traders into the deserted chan­  
nels. In both cases, the neutral intervention may  
be said to result from the pressure of the war; and  
in both cases, the effect is toe same to the belligerent;  
since in both, neutralscarry on forhim, a trade auxi­  
liary to Ins prosperity and his revenue, which he  
could no longer carry on for himself; awf which at  
the same lime, by liberating his naval faculties for the  
purposes of war, enable him to cam-on the warwiih  
mote vigour and effect. These inferences cannot be  
impaired by any sound distinction, between a tr .de  
of foreigners with colonies, and a tfade of foreigners  
with the ports of the mother country. Colonies, &#x27;more  
especially when they are altogether subject to the same  
authority which governs the parent state, are inte­  
gral parts of the same dominion or empire. A trade,  
therefore, between a colonial port and a port of the  
parent or principal state, is precisely of the same  
nature with a trade between one ;.nd another port of  
the latter : and a trade between a colony and a fo­  
reign port is, in like manner, precisely the same  
with the trade between a foreign port and the parent  
country ; which is only a more considerable, as a  
colony may lie a less considerable part, of the same  
country or empire. Previous to the late political  
union of Ireland with Great Britain, the relation be­  
tween those two islands was strictly analogous to the  
relation between (Vreat-Britain and the West-Indies.  
Was any difference ever entertained between a coast­  
ing trade from a British to a British port, and a  
trade from a British port to an Irish port ; or be­  
tween a trade from a foreign port to an Irish port,  
and a trade from a foreign to a British port &gt; In the  
nature of things, and in the eye of foreign nations,  
the cases were the same. If any difference existed,  
it was merely circumstantial, such as may be inci­  
dent to all cases essentially the same ; or merely mu­  
nicipal, such as may result from those regulations of  
trade, winch all sovereigns have an acknowledged  
  
ng&#x27;ii n&gt; mane. u would not De unfair, therefore, in  
examining the doctrine asserted by (Jreat-Britain, to  
view it in the whole extent of which it is susceptible.  
But the latitude in which it is avowed, and carried  
into operation, sufficiently demands the serious at­  
tention of all nations ; but more than any, that of the  
United States, whose commerce more than any is  
the victim to this belligerent pretension. To pre­  
pare the way for this examination, several remarks  
are to be pieinised.  
First. The general rule being, that the trade be­  
tween a neutral and belligerent nation is as free as it  
the latter were at peace with all nations, and the  
cases in which it is not as free being exceptions to  
the general rule, the exceptions, according to a re­  
ceived maxim of interpretation, are to be taken  
strictly, against those claiming the benefit of the ex­  
ceptions, and favourably for those claiming the bene­  
fit of the general rule.  
Secondly. The exceptions being founded on a prin­  
ciple of necessity, hi opposition to ordinary right, the  
necessity ought to be evident and urgent. In pro­  
portion as the necessity may be doubtful, and still  
more, m proportion as the sacrifice of neutral inter­  
est would exceed the advantage to the belligerent,  
the exception fails.  
Thirdly. The progress of the law of nations, un­  
der the influence of science and humanity, is mitigat­  
ing the evils of war, and diminishing live motives to  
it, by favoring the rights of those remaining at peace,  
rather than of those who enter into war. Not only  
are the laws of war tempered between the parties at  
war, but much also in relation to those at peace.  
Repeating then, that e*very belligerent right to con­  
troul neutral commerce must as an exception to the  
general freedom of commerce, be positively and  
strictly proved,, and the more strictly, as the excep­  
sions are in a course of restriction rather than exten­  
sion, the question is ready for examination, whether  
it he a part of the law of nations, that a trade ordina­  
i ily shut in time of peace, ami opened to neutrals in  
time of war, is liable, as much as a trade in contra­  
band of war or with a blockaded port, to capture and  
condemnation.  
It will not be overlooked, that the principle, as  
thus laid down, does not extend to any of the cases,  
where a new trade, though opened during a war, is  
not opened on account of the war, but on considera­  
tions which would produce the same measure, if no  
war existed ; from which follows another important  
observation, that taking into view the probable oc­  
  
currence of such considerations, the still greater prn­  
babiiity of a mixture of such with consideration&#x27;s de­  
rived rum the war, the impossibility of distuiguish­  
init the propoi tion of these different ingredients in the  
mixture, with the evident disadvantages of render­  
ing more complicated, instead of symplifying, a rule  
oi conduct between independent nations, to be ex­  
pounded and enforced by one of the parlies themselves  
it would seem to require no great effort of candour  
to acknowledge the powerful objection in practice, to  
such a principle, were h really embraced by the most  
specious theory.  
fiut without dwelling on this view of tlie subject,  
however just in itself, the principle in question will  
be tried :  
First—by the writings most generally received as  
the depositaries and oracles of the law of nations.  
Secondly—by the evidence of treaties ;  
Thirdly—by the judgment of nations, other than  
Great Britain ;  
Fourthly—by the conduct of Great Britain her­  
self.  
Fifthly—by the reasoning employed in favour of the  
principle.

TREATIES.  
All writers on the law of nations, as  
well didactic as polemic, avail them­  
selves, whenever they can, of the au­  
thority of Treaties.  
Treaties may be considered under se­  
veral relations to the law of nations,  
according to the several cpiestions to be  
decided by them.  
They may be considered as simply re­  
peating or affirming the general law:  
they may be considered as making ex­  
ceptions to the general law, which are  
to bo a particular law between the pari­  
ties themselves: theymavbe consider*  
cd as explanatory of the l.w of nations,  
on points where its meaning is other­  
wise obscure or unsettled ; in whit h  
case they are, first, a hi w bct.vccn the  
parties themselves, and next, a sanc­  
tion to the general law, according to  
the reasonableness of the explanation,  
and the number and (huracter ef the  
parties to it: lastly, Treaties mr.y be  
considered as constituting a voluntary or  
positive law of nations.  
Whether the stipulations in a treaty  
are to be considered as an affirmance or  
an exception, or an explanation, may  
■times appear on the face of the  
treaty : i  
i is, their i I I be deter  
mined by resorting to 01  
of the law ot nations. I  
the question c &gt;ncerningl must  
be dee! &#x27;- !by t&quot; law, not the question  
concerning the law  
In the present case, it I  
shewn, from the sources&#x27;general!) !  
lowed to be the most authentic,  
the law of nations i* Ho!_t&lt; ; &quot;  
principle asserted by (Treat Britain, It  
just inference, therefore, that eve­  
ry article in .. &#x27;Tities co-. g.that  
principle, is an nee and direct  
proof of the general law ; and that any  
&#x27; stinul tion of the princ.pie would, as an  
exa p ion to the general law, be an in­  
direct proof of it.  
Butsupposingfor a moment, the pre­  
sent case to belong to that class, in  
which the great oracles of t&#x27;ae law of  
: nations re obscure, or at variance a­  
j mong themselves , and in which, more­  
over, the practice of nations, not be­  
ing uniform, is an unsatisfactory guide;  
and consequently, that the evidence of  
treaties were necessary in order to as­  
certain the law ; Still it will be found  
that the result of an appeal to that evi­  
dence is conclusive against the British  
pretension, It may be confidently af­  
firmed, that on no point ever drawn in­  
to question, the evidence of Treaties ,  
was more uniform, more extensive, or \
more satisfactory.  
Nay more ; it may be affirmed that I  
the treaties applicable to this case may j  
fairly be considered in their relation to  
the law of nations last noticed ; that is,  
9.3 constituting a law off themselves. Ii&quot;,  
in any case, Treaties can be sufficiently  
general, sufficiently uniform, and of ,  
sufficient duration, to attest that gene- j  
ral and settled concurrence of nations in :  
a principle ©f rule of conduct among j  
themselves, which amounts to the esta- I  
bllsliment of a general l_w ; such an I  
effect cannot reasonably be refused to  
the number and character of the trea­  
ties Which arc applicable to the pre­  
sent case.  
That Treaties may amount to a law of  
:•, follows from tiie very defini­  
tion of that law; which consists of  
those rules of conduct which reason de­  
duces, as consonant to justice and com­  
mon good, from tiie nature of ihesooie­  
isting among ind-pendent nations ;  
with suchdefiniirons and modification*  
y be established by general con­  
cent.  
One evidence of general consent is  
ral usage, which implies general &#x27;  
eon .-rut.  
Can treaties which express consent  
be ah inferior evidence, Where nothing  
on the face of the treaties, nor in any  
collateral authority on the law of na­  
tions is found to impair the evidence i  
Treaties may indeed in one point of j  
  
] View be corisiicVred as a higtitf authori-l  
ty tlian usage, when they have a gene-1  
r.tlity and continuance which give to v-  
I sage the authority of law ; because all  
j treaties involve a usage commensurate  
i i with the sphere in which they are ob­  
. I ligatory. Whilst usage, therefore, im­  
. plies consent ; treaties imply the v  
: at the same time that they express the  
consent of the parties to them.  
, But the io. is another poiat ef view In  
which the influence of treaties, those at  
. | least of peace and of commerce, in mo­  
, difying and defining the rules of public  
: law applicable to periods of war, ought  
&gt; in preference to the influence of mere  
i practice, to be promoted by all go­  
• vernmeUts which respect justice and  
■ humanity, and by all jurists who aspire j  
1 to the authority: of commentators on j  
■ ; that, subject.  
The law of nations, as derived from !  
• mere usage or practice during those pc- j  
. nods, is evidenced for the most part by j  
, ex parte Ordinances, issued hybelliger­  
: ent governments in tbe midst of tbe |  
• | passionspr policy of war ; and by ju- J  
: di&#x27;cial deciiioni, also ex parte, and bi- i  
cj more or less by the same causes,  
ij if not by the interest also, which i  
j weighty individuals, or perhaps bodies J  
! of individuals have, In widening the  
iI of predatory wealth.  
. I Treaties arc formed under very dif­  
ferent circumstances. Those of peace  
. imply that the hostile passions and pur­  
; suits have spent their force, and that a  
mutual spirit of liberality and accom­  
modation have taken their place : Trea­  
ties of commerce again are necessarily  
founded vi principles of&#x27; reciprocal jus­  
and i..teresl:, wholly at variance j  
with the violent spirit of war: whilst  
in the negotiation of treaties of both j  
kinds the respective efforts and inter­  
est -, of the parries form those: mutual  
checks, require those mutual eoiices&#x27;­  
) sinus, and involve those mutual appeals j  
&#x27; to a moral standard ef right, which are j  
most likely to make both parties con  
verge to a just and reasonable conclusi­  
on. Nor is a sense of character with­  
out its effect oh such occasions. Nati­  
ons would not stipulate m the-, face of  
the world things, which each of them  
would separately do, in pursuit of its  
selfish obi  
1 It will accordingly be found, as might  
tw xpecteu, thi t tho violent and cruel  
maxim*ol war, those still remaining,  
as well as those from time to time ex  
plodeu, have had their Origin and their  
&#x27; continuance in the separate usages of  
at nation&quot;., not iii treaties;  
whm.t on tbe other hand, it will be  
found that the. reformation of those a­  
-1 buses has been Mie gradual work of  
treaties ; that the spirit of treaties ii;,  
with lew if any ex. . pilous, at al&#x27;.  
more jc&#x27;sv, more rational audi more be­  
lent, than the spirit of the law de­  
rived fr .v ;.. tie-- only; and conse*  
ntly, that all further meliorations of  
the code of public law, are to bu cx­  
ptcted from the former, not the latter  
rce ; and consequently, agon, that  
all enlightened frems to the happiness  
of nations ought to favor the inffuenci  
of treaties oh th.-gvet code by which  
tin ir intercourse is to be regulated.

as weit e.s other branches of com­  
merce,  
It would be a waste of time to bestow  
it on tiie treaties of a remote period,  
partaking too little ot the civilisation  
and spirit of mere modern times, to e­

. sufficient to commence this n

which forms an important epoch in the  
commercial and political history ol t_u«  
rope, and to remark as the result of  
• some enquiry into antecedent treaties,  
that they contain nothing which can  
give the least &#x27;&lt;&quot;iintenance to the princi­  
ple under c: a ruination.  
It .ill be sufficient also to limit the re­  
view of treaties, where Great Britain  
wfts not a party, to those of most im­  
portance, either for the: tenor of the  
I stipulations, or for the particular par­  
ties to them, with marginal references  
to others of analogs is import; remark­

Ab a more convenient distribution al­  
so, the first review will stop with the  
I epwch of the armed neutrality. The  
; relation, which tbe treaties subsequent  
;to that event have to the subject, will  
De noticed by itself.  
I Examples to which Great Britain is  
not a party.  
By a treaty concerning navigation  
arid commerce in lf&gt;so, preceded by a  
p ticular article on tiie same subject  
concluded in 1648, it is stipulated be­  
tween the United Provinces nd Spain, j  
I &quot;that the abjeets and inhabitants of!  
the United Provinces (8t those of Spain  
&#x27; reciprocally) may sail and trade with  
all freedom and safety in all the king­  
dom I, states and countries which are  
OT shall be in peace, amity, or neutrality  
with the state of the said United Pr vin­  
ceS ; and that they shall not he disquiet­  
ed or molested in this liberty by the  
&quot;ships or subjects of the king of Spain,  
upon the account of hostilities which  
may exist, or may happen : fterwards,  
between the said king of Spain and the  
aforesaid kingdoms, countries ar&gt;d states,  
or any of them that may be in amity or  
neutrality with the said lords the states I  
as above.&quot;  
  
I This liberty, in relation to &quot;Prance,!  
j was to extend to all sorts oi men  
disc which might be carried thither be-1  
fore she was ,j. war witb Spain ;  
roui.raiau&#x27;l c/&#x27;ev..&#x27;, not proceeding  
the states of Spain hersel  
of being used against the Spanish domi­  
nions.  
With respect to other countries at  
peace with the United Provinces, 8c at  
Wat&quot; With Spain, tbe enumerated arue.ies  
of contraband were not to be carried .to  
them by the United Provinces, but all  
articles not contraband were to be free­  
ly carried, wnu the exception only of  
cities and places invested or blockad­  
ed.  
The Pyrenean treaty, between Prance  
! and Spain in 1659, established  
j friendship between tor two nations, that j  
they were mutually restrained from giv­  
! ing either of them to these attacking the  
Other, any assistance in men, riionev, er j  
J victuals, or with passage through his do- j  
minions. Yet it is stipulated—! art. X—  
XVt. Which are reciprocal, that the,  
j French shall have liberty to fade to all &#x27;  
i parts ■whut.iOiver, though they si

excepting Portugal, whilst it continued

are understood ail sorts of arms and  
warlike stores ; but corn and all man­  
ner of provision and goods, not being  
j arms and warlike, stores, are net reput­  
i ed contraband, and they may be carried  
to pi Lies in war wit! pting

French vessels, passing from the pearls j  
of Spain to any port in enmity with  
i crown, shall not oe in any way tetai  
lof molested, after producing their  
ses, specifying their lading.  
It here Appears) that the parties were  
at liberty, when neutral, to tr.idc to all  
parts of b belligerent country, not bloc­  
kaded, end in nil merchandises not con­  
trabahd.  
The expression &#x27;*&#x27;_! was allowed lie­  
fore tbe said war,&quot; iv ibis an 1 in tVie  
preceding examples, clearly fall within  
the observations made on the like ex­  
pressions, used by the writers on the law  
oi&quot; nations. They are merely a mode of  
describing the indefinite right t&#x27;&gt; trad,  
as if no war bad arisen, and cortsequen.tr  
ly to enter into any new channels of  
trade which night lie opened to them.  
In a treaty in 1662, between France  
and the United Provinces, it is stipulat­  
•rt. XXVI—XXViI. fee. that the  
parties reciprocally are to trade and na­  
vigate with all freedom and safety u&gt;  
countries respectively at war with one  
and at peace with the other, without any  
exceptions mule by the treaty, other  
than a trade in contraband, or to a  
place blockaded,  
The treaty between France and tbe  
United Provinces, art. jcxVii—xxix,as  
incorporated with the treaty of ilre la in  
16671, between the latter power and  
England, declares th.&#x27;t the subjects of  
either party niay sail and traffic ih all  
countries ataey thnefm peace with one  
and it&#x27;ll other, ana tni«

In a treaty tid 167 ~ between France

corn spoadii; import,  
A treaty in i.675, be*weeti Sweden ahd  
the United Provinces, contains iike sti­  
pulations m the thrfce first and following  
articles.  
A declaration made in 167G, by Spain  
ck the United Provinces, confiymhigthe  
treaty of 16jo, stipulates the right *f  
. ither ; art-, -o trade with the enemy of  
the other, as well directly as between  
enemy&#x27;s ports, whrth rthe ports belong  
to the same or different enemies, con­  
traband goods and places blockaded be­  
ing excepted.  
in art. xm. BtC of another treaty in  
!678, between France and the United  
Provinces, the Same points are again  
stipulated.  
Phe xin. art. of another treaty in  
1679, between Sweden and the United  
Provinces, contains a like stipulation.  
S&quot; igdn the like stipulation is con­  
ed in Art. xiii. of another treaty in  
1679, between France and the United  
Provinces.  
In a treaty in 1701, between Den­  
mark and the United Provinces, the  
stipulations import an uninterrupted  
commerce ofthe neutral with an enemy  
of the other party, with the usual excep. ,  
tion of contraband.  
The like stipulation is found m a trea­  
ty eflf 16, Art. viii. between France  
and the Hanse towns.  
A treaty, Art vi. between the empe­  
ror Charles VI. and Philip V. of Spain,  
May 1,172.5, is of like import.  
The same is the language of a treaty  
in 1752, between Naples and Holland.  
A treaty. Art. xvi. in 1767, between  
France and Hamburg, and another ne­  
tween France and the? duk.c of iVlcck­  
&#x27; lenburg in 1779, maintain the same  
j dot trine.  
To these authorities deriv d from the  
j eonvnotional law of Ki.t-pc, against

RICHMOND, doth JANUARY.  
NUMBER II.  
EXAMINATION OF THE BRITISH DOC&#x27;  
TRINF,  
WHICH SUBJECTS TO CAPTURE A NEUTRAL  
TRADE, NOT OPEN IN TIME OF PEACE. »  
In trying thet»d«ce of this belligerent pri -  
ciplehy the third dandard which is laid dowi ,  
viz. the conduit of nations other than Great  
Britain; our author has confined his obferv:­  
tions within the following paragraph :  
THE CONDUCT OF OTHER NATIONS.  
The evidence from this fonree is merely negative  
hut is not on that account without convincing ed&#x27;eift­  
If the doftrine advanced by Great-Britain had been  
entertained by other nations, it would have been feen  
in the documents, cnrrefpondsng with thofe which  
ointain the Britilh do&amp;rine. Yet, with all the re­  
f-arch which could be employed, no indication has  
been met with, that a Tingle nation, belides herfclf,  
lias founded on the didinllioii between a trade per­  
mitted and a trade not permitted in time of peace, a  
belligerent right to interrupt the trade in time of  
war. The didin&lt;dion can be traced neither in their di­  
plomatic difeuflions, nor their manifeftos, nor their  
prize ordinances, nor their in ft mA ions to their trui­  
7 rs, nor in the decifions of their maritime courts. If  
the difHnftion had been afTertcd or recognized, it  
coulJ not fail to have exhibited itfelf, in fome, or other,  
of thofe documents. Having done fo in none of  
them, the inference cannot be contelled, that Great­  
Eritain is the only nation that has ever attempted this  
momentous innovation on the law of nations.  
“ But if (fays our author when proceeding  
to the fourth dandard he has laid down) it be  
not enough to have fhown that the belligerent  
c&#x27;aim aflrrted by Britain is condemned by .all  
the h’ghejlauthorities on the law of nations, by  
the cleared teflimony of treaties among all the  
principal maritime nations of the world, her­  
felf included, and by the practice of all other  
nations ; fhe cannot furely demur to the exam­  
ple of her own proceedings. And it is here  
perhaps more than any where clfe, that the  
c laim ought to (brink from examination. It  
will be feen in the courfe of the following ob­  
fervations, that G. Britain is compelled, under  
every appeal that can be made to hcrfelf, to  
pronounce her own condemnation ; and what  
is much worfe, that the innovation, which flic  
endeavors to enforce as a right tf war, is un­  
d r that name a mere project for extending the  
field of maritime capture, and multiplying the  
( lurces of commercial nggrandifement: a war­  
fare, in faS, again d the commerce of her friends,  
8z a monopolizing grafp at that of her enemies.”  
  
Our author lays down two propohtions: 1st,  
that “ whiltt G. Britain denies to her enemies  
a right to relax their laws in favour of neutral  
commerce, (he relaxes her own, thole relating  
to her colonial trade, a« to other branches j”  
2 id, that “ whilft (he denies to neutrals the  
right to trade with the colonies of her enemies,  
Ihe trades berfelf with her enemies and invites  
them to trade with her colo.ries.”  
The truth of the firlt propofition is proved

vigation afl, which permitted many articles of  
the trade of Afin, Africa, and America, to be  
brought from any place, in any /hips belonging  
to a nation in amity. From the preamble to  
thcl&#x27;e aft s of the Legiflatnre, it is clearly demon.  
Prated, that in all thefe relaxations of her peace  
i. Rem, fhe has even avowed berfelf to be go­  
verned by the fame policy of eluding the pref­  
fures of war, and of transferring her merchant  
fliip3 and mariners from the purfuits of com­  
merce to the operations «l w ar, which fhe re­  
pufewts as rendering unlawful the like relaxa­  
tions of her enemies.”  
The truth of the 2nd propofition is alfo de­  
mo nitrated by “ the efforts of Great-Britain to  
maintain a trade at all times with tire colonics  
of other nations, particularly of Spain, both in  
peace and war, both by force and clandeftinely,

“ But (fays our au&#x27;hor) a mod interefting  
view of the conduH of Great-Britain will he  
prefented by a bijlory of the novel principle  
v/hici fhe is endeavouring to interpolate into  
tin code of public law, and by an examination  
of tie fallacies and inconftjlendes to which her  
government, and her courts have reforted, in  
maintaining the principle ?” In his inveftiga­  
tiou of this part of the fubjeft, our author en­  
ters into an able and elaborate detail, which  
ir is fcarcely poflible to condcnfe within any  
intelligible compafs.  
He proves that this principle was never af­  
J ried or enforced by her again A other nations,  
before the war of 17 5G ; and I hat it was during  
t iis war, that “ the naval refnurers of Great­  
Britain augmented by her prolperoas com­  
merce, inoic cfpcCodly that of her ll,cn coin,  
nies, now the U. States of America, gave her  
an afcendancy over all her rivals and enemies,  
and prompted thofe abufes wh:ch ratfed the  
voice of all Europe againft her.” It is here  
that he developed the origin of this novel prin­  
ciple. The linglifh government had no iooncr  
made war upon tile Dutch commerce, th.-ui the  
Dutch began to avail thcmlVIvcs of their neu­  
tral and Amputated rights to enter into it ; par­  
ticularly the cd nmcrce of the colonies. The  
  
F.ng ilh immediately made war on ibis com­  
merce, and in two years alone, captured and  
pillaged not lefs than 300 vefiel3. The Dutch  
jrmo&#x27;iftrated : they appealed to the treaties  
of 1674 and 1675, which made enemy’s goods  
fret in their Ibip , and the Dutch trade free  
to a .id from the enemy’s port*, and from one  
enemy’s port to another, &#x27;[’he F.njlilh were

Uid nothing as to times of peace. This admit­

in the pretext, that the Dutch vcflels, being  
engaged in the colonial trade were therefore to  
be confidered as French vcficls. Such was th

demned but upon the prefumpti »n or rather

however, foon developed the other lhapesand  
iifes of which this belligerent innovation was  
fufceptible, for the accomplifhmcnt of commer­  
cial purpofes. Ill the progrefs of the war of  
1755, French W.India produce conveved by neu­  
trals from aSpanifb neutral port, was condemned  
on the pretext that the intervention of theneutral  
port was a fraudulent evafion of the rule, which  
condemned the trade with a French port._  
“ There is foir.c obfeurity, it mull be owned,  
as to the principle on which a neutral trade  
with the French colonies was condemned after  
fhe difcontinuance of fpecial licences ; it being  
fometimes dated in the arguments referring to  
that period, that the condemnation was found­  
ed on the principle, that the trade was virtually  
or adoptively a French trade; and fometimes,  
that it W33 founded on the general principle,  
that it was a trade not open in time of peace.  
&#x27;Certain it is, that the original principle was  
that of a virtual adoption, that principle being  
commenfurate with the original occafion ; ami  
that as foon as this original principle was  
found infufiicient to reach the new occafions, a  
ft rung tendency was feen towards a variation  
of the principle in order to bring the new occa­

the laft he proves that it was the intention of  
the Britifh cabinet to employ this belligerent  
principle not as a mere right of war, blit as  
a pretext for arrefting the increafing carrying­  
trade of the United States, which fiipplied all  
parts of Europe, with the produce of the W.  
Indies and without affording to G. Britain any  
of the profits of an entrepot. He fliows that  
the commercial policy for which flic employs her  
new belligerent principle is the more apparent  
from two other fubfidiary pretenfions. The  
objed of drawing through her own ware­  
lio ifes and counting-houfes, the colonial trade  
of her enemies, on its way from the W. Indies  
to the other countries of Europe, being coun­  
tcraded by the extenfive intercourfe between  
the U. States and thofe colonies, and by the  
re-exportation from the U. States of the im­  
ported furplus of colonial produce, the pro­  
ject was adopted of forcing this trade diredly  
from the W. Judies to, and through O. Britain,  
id: by checking the W. In lia importations  
into the U. States, and thereby lellening the  
furplus for re-exportation; 2 I. by embarraffing  
the re-exportation from the U. S.  
“ In order to check importations, the prin­  
ciple is advanced, that the outward and the  
return voyage are to be regarded ns forming  
but njingle voyage ; and conf qnently, ifavef­  
fel is found with an innocent cargo on board,  
but on her return rom a hoftile port, her out­

y ar impofes on neutral commerce a variety of pri­  
vations and embarraffinents. It is reafonable, there­  
fore, as well as lawful, that neutrals fhould enjoy the  
advantages which may happen to arife from war.  
1. In the cafe of contraband, the articles of which,  
efpecially according to the Britilh catalogue, may  
conipofc an important branch of exports in time of  
peace, the commerce or particular nations remaining  
at peace may fuffer material defalcations from the ex­  
ercifeof the rights of war.  
2. In the cafe of enemy’s property carried hy neu­  
tral mips, (as Great-Britain, at Waft, underftands and  
enforces the law of nations), a branch of trade more  
or left important to all commercial nations, and con­  
ftituting the mod profitable branch of trade with  
fome in times of peace, becomes an objeift of belli­  
gerent interruption and conGfcation.  
.1. In the cafe of blockades, the abridgement and  
enibarraffment to which the trade of neutrals, efpe­  
cially thofe at a diftance, is fubje&amp;ed by war, form  
other important items oflofs on their fide. This is a  
belligerent claim, on which much might he faid, if !  
the notoriety of itsefFe&amp;s, to fay nothing of its extra- I  
vagant abufes, did not render it unneceffary.

neutral veffels on the high feas, the erroneous fufpi- |  
cions and inferences which fend them into port fot I  
trial, the difficulty of obtaining all the requifite proofs }  
thereon by the claimant, the delays and expences in- &#x27;  
cident to the judicial proceedings, more efpecially !  
where the trial is at a great diftance, and above all ’  
when appeals flill more diftant become neceffary.the i  
changes in the ftate of markets during all thefe de­  
lays, which convert into lofs the gains pronnfed by I  
the expedition, the fufpenfton of the merchantile j  
funds, the heavy facrifices, and fometimes bankrupt- &#x27;  
cies thence enfuing ; all thefe injuries, which war ,  
bringson neutral commerce, taken together, mud fure­  
ly, during war, require a very great weight in the !  
oppofite fcale to balance them, and the weight of  
thefe injuries is fometimes nor a littleincreafed by the  
piracies which a (late of war generates and embol­  
dens.  
1 he injuries, befides, which are here enumerat­  
ed, are limited to fuch proceedings as the laws of war  
may be thought to authorife. To a fair eftimate of  
the evils fuffered hy neutral commerce, mu ft be add­  
ed all thofe abufes which never fail to be mingled  
with the exercife of belligerent rights on the high  
Teas; the protra»51ed interruptions, the perfonal in­  
fults, the violent or furtive fpoliations, with a thou­  
fand irregularities, which are more or lefs infepara­  
b!e from the proceeding, and which can feldom be fo  
j far verified and profecuted to effed againft the wrong­  
doers, as to amount to a reparation.  
If the evils, brought on neutrals by a ftate of war,  
were to be traced to their full extent, a long lift of a  
diftindl kind ought moreover to be thrown into th±  
fame fcale. How many condemnations are made ei­  
ther direflly contrary to the law of nations, or by  
means of unjuft preemptions, or arbitrary rules of  
evidence, againft neutral claimants ? How often and  
how feverely are the neutral appellants aggrieved by  
meafuring the reftitution awarded to them, not accor­  
ding to the actual lofs, hut according to the deficient  
eftimates, or the fcanty proceeds of fules decreed by  
| ignorant or corrupt vice admiralty courts,* in places  
I and under circumfiances, which reduce the price to  
a mere fra&amp;ion of the value ? Examples of this fort  
might ealily be multiplied ; hue they may b? thought  
of the lefs weight in the prefent cafe, as they furnifh  
a juft ground of refort from the ordinary tribunals of  
juftice, to thofe ulterior remedies, which depend on  
negociations and arrangements between the bellige­  
rent and neutral governments. But whatever may  
be the provifions for indemnity, obtained in thefe  
modes, it remains an important truth on the prefent  
fubjedl, that befides the intermediate difadvantage to  
neutral traders from the mere delay of diplomatic and  
conventional remedies, the juftice ftipuluted isalways  
rendered very incomplete, by the difficulties in veri­  
fying the Ioffes and damages fuftained.  
1 he principle urged againft a neutral trade in time  
of war, not permitted in peace, is the more unrea­  
fonable, hecaufe it gives to a tribunal eftablilhed by  
a h-lhgerent party only, a latitude of judgement im­  
proper to be coufided to courts of juftice, however  
conftitutcd.

In cales, even where the tribunal has an equal re­  
lation to both the parties, it has ever been deemed  
pr-per, that the rules of decifion fln,uld he as plain  
and as determinate as poffible; in order not only  
that they might he the furer guide to thofe who are  
to ohferve them ; but alfo a better guard againft the  
partialities and errors of thofe who are to apply them  
Say, then, whether it be not an abandonment of eve­  
ry reafonahle precaution, while the judges have, in  
the.r national prejudices, in the tenure of their offi­  
cial emoluments, and in their hopes of perfonal ad­  
vancement, an exclufive relation to one of the par­  
ties ; fay whether it he not unreafonable to 1.&#x27; ive  
to the opinion, perhaps to the conjedlures of a tribu­  
nal fo comp^fed, the queflions whether in a diflant  
quarter of the globe a particular tradef was or was  
not allowed before the war, whether if not allowed  
before the war, ns allowance during the war pro­  
ceeded from caufesdiftindt from the war, or arifintr  
out of the war ; whether the allowance had or had  
not been common to all wars; whether again, ifre­  
fulting from the particular prefTure of war, the pref­  
fure amounted to a neceffity; whether if amounting  
to a neceffity the neceffity refund from an impof­  
&#x27;ability, Ifnpofed by a decided predominance and f«­  
penonty at fea, of the sdverfe party ? Thefe are not  
queflions of fancy or of unfsirnefs. They are quefti­  
ons which it has been feen, that the enlightened judge  
m the Britifh high court of Admiralty has himfelf  
recognized as involved in the principle for which he  
contends. But they arc queflions in their nature im­  
proper to be decided by any judicial authority what­  
ever ; and in the.r importance, they are queflions  
too great to be left even to the fovereign authority of  
a country where the right, of other fovereign, are to  
be the objedl of the d &#x27;cilton.  
Finally I I,e k;’.|igerc„t claim, to intercpft „ n(,„.

more extravagantly prepoflernu, and pernicious, by  
he latitude wh.ch ,t ,s now aflutning. At cording to

thrown on the claimants; that betides the podihiliry  
that it may be ■ licenied caoture, the difficulty of  
proof may have the fame effeift in producing condem­

of giving up a few men to take charge of the prize, in  
exchange of a few others, not unfrequentl y imprejfed  
into the vjeaney. In a word, his calculation is, that he  
may gain, and cannot lole. Will not under fuch cir­  
cumdances, every hogffiead of fugar, or bale of cot­  
ton, or barrel of rum, &amp;c. be a fignnl for detention ?  
Could ingenuity devife a projetft holding out a more

I tbe month of Feb. 1672—4.  
Prior to the peace, neither of them  
I could claim the rights of neutrality a­  
gainst the. other.  
This declaratory stipulation has been  
said to be peculiarly important, It is so  
fat&#x27; several reasons :  
Ist. Because it determines the &quot;Yd in &#x27;  
of the neutral party, so far as may d.-- &#x27;  
peiul on the belligerent party, la trade  
not only between its own ports and those  
of the enemies ol the belligerent party, ;  
without any exception of colonies, but &#x27;  
ay other neutral port and ene- &#x27;  
porti, without ex-ception dfcoloni- ;  
al ports Of the enemy ; and moreover, !  
not only between the ports, colooial as  
Well as Others, clone enemy and another &#x27;  
ween the different ports &#x27;  
of the same enemy; and consequently &#x27;  
between one pen. and another of the  
principal Country j between these and &#x27;  
the ports of its colonies j between the &#x27;  
portsofone colony and another, and ■  
even to cany on the trade of I  
any particular colony. :  
2&lt;l. Because it fixes the meaning not  
only of the ;.r;i,U sin the two specified &#x27;  
treaties ; but has the same effect on all &#x27;■■ &#x27;  
other stipulations by Great Britain, ex- j I  
&quot;d in .the sane; on equivalent  
terms ; ene or other of which are used &#x27;  
m most, it not all her treaties on this &#x27;  
subject.  
3d. because it made a part of the i  
es explained, that free ships should J i  
■ free goods ; and consequently,!  
•asting and colonial trade, when &#x27;  
conjbiued wish that neutral advantage,  
was the less likely to be acknowled  
if&quot; not considered as clearly belonging to  
the neutral party.  
4th. Because the explanatory article  
was the result ot the-SQltcit&amp;tion of-Eng­  
i Irtd ;,/&gt;■-&lt;//; and she actually claimed  
and M.joyed the benefit of-the article,  
she being at the time in peace,and the  
Dutch in war with France.  
in&#x27;the-treaty With France, February  
24, 1677, articles i. ir. and til. import &#x27;  
that each party may trade freely with  
the enemies of the oth( r, With the same  
merchandise as in time of peace, con­  
traband goods only excepted, and that  
all merchandises not contraband, &quot;are  
1 i be carried from any port in neu­  
trality, to the port of an enemy, and  
irom one port (fan enemy to another ;  
towns besieged, blocked up or invested,  
only excepted.&quot;  
In M&gt;B9, England entered into the con •;  
vention with Holland, prohibiting ail  
neutral commerce with France, then  
the enemy of both. In consequence of  
thee tty of Sweden and Den­  
mark, tar defending their neutral rights ;  
list this violent measure, saihvlac- «  
; tion was made, according to Vattcl, for :  
j the ships taken from them ; without the  
vidence, as far as can be trac­  
, ed, that any attempt was made by either  
:ol the belligerent parties, to introduce  
the distinction between such part of the  
trade interrupted, as might not have  
been allow, d before the war, and as was  
i therefore unlawful, and such part as  
i having been allowed before the war,  
might not lawfully be subject to can.

cepted as ftre at that time, besieged, !  
bio. ked up round about, or invested.  
Could the principle maintained a­  
gainst Great-Britain be mere clearly  
laid down, or move strongly fortified by  
her sanction ?  
To give to this example the complete  
effect which it ought to have, several  
remarks are proper/  
In tiie first place, on comparing the  
description given of the free trade which  
might be carried on between the neu- ;  
fral party and an enemy cf the other  
&#x27;party, with the description of the free  
trade allowed between the parties  
themselves, by the Ist article of the 1  
treity, it appears that in order to ex­  
cept the colonial trade in the latter i  
case, the freedom stipulated in article  
1, is expressly limited to Euro,&#x27;&#x27;-.  
The terms are,&quot;that there shall be 1  
a reciprocal and entirely perfect liberty :  
of navigation and commerce between  
the subjects on each part, through ;dl &lt;  
and every the kingdoms, states, chimin- 1  
nmnsoftheir royal majesties/.v Europe.&quot; 1  
In the stipulation relating to the neutral 1  
commerce ef tither w it&#x27;ll the enemy of 1  
the other (who, if a maritime enemy,;  
could not fail to possess colonies out of «  
Europe) the terms are, «that all mer- 1  
chandtaes, not contraband, may be car- j  
ried in the freest manner to places he- i  
longing to an enemy, such towns or 1  
places only being excepted, as ar  
that time besieged or blockaded, &amp;c.&quot; 1  
without any limitation to Europe, or ex- 1  
ceptinn of colonies any where. It is 1  
obvious, that the terms here used com- «  
ad all col inies, as much as the [*  
in the first article would have  
if colonies had not been excel t- 1  
edby limiting the freedom of tre.de to t  
; places &quot;ia Europe ;&quot; and consequently 1 «  
that it any distinction between the colo- , t  
i.i tl and other places of an encmv, had I ;  
! been contemplated in the neutral tied- :  
of either party with him, as it Was con- \ *  
templattci between the colonies and &#x27; &#x27;  
European possessions of the parties in 1  
their commerce to be carried on be- &#x27;  
tween themselves, the distinction would 1  
have been expressed in the latter «  
Was in the former ; and lot being &#x27;  
so expressed, the trade in the latter  
case v/as to be as free to die colonies,  
as would have been 111 the former, If the &#x27;  
colonies had not been excepted by the &#x27;  
limitation ol the trade to Europe. &#x27; 1  
Secondly. But the treaty n«t con- &#x27;  
tent with this necessary construction, in &#x27;  
favor ol a neutral commerce with the :  
colonies of an enemy, proceeds, in con­  
formity to the example in ! tra- :  
t&#x27;.ry convention between England and (  
Holland in 1674, explicitly to declare  
the freedom ot the neutral party, to  
trade not only from any port, to the &#x27;  
places of an enemy, and from the pi  
,ol an enemy to neutral places, but also :  
I from one place to another place belong­  
ing to an enemy, whether the places be ]  
under the same or different sovereigns. &#x27;  
Here both the coasting trade and the  
colonial trade, which,&quot;in relation to the :  
parent country, is In the nature of a  
coasting trade, are both placed on the &#x27;  
! same footing with every other branch of  
j commerce between neutral and bellig­  
-1 crent parties, although it must have  
been well known, that both those bran­  
ches are generally shut ta foreigners in  
time of peace, and if opened&#x27;at all,  
would be opened in time of war, and  
for the most part, on account of the  
war.  
Thirdly. It is well known, that this  
particular treaty underwent great op­  
position and discussion, both without  
and within the British parliament j and  
that it was for some time, under a legis- ■  
1 itive negative. Yet it does not appear,  
cither from the public debates, or&#x27;from  
the discussions of the press, as far as  
there has been an opportunity of con­  
sulting them, that the difficulty arose  
in the least from this part of the treaty.  
The contest seems to have turned Whol­  
ly on other parts, and principally on the  
regulations of the immediate comma  
between the two nations. This part of  
the treaty may be. considered, therefore,  
as having received the complete sanc­  
tion of Great-Britain. Had it lie  
been otherwise, the repeated sanctions  
given to it on subsequent occasions,  
would preclude her from making the  
least use of any repugnance shewn to it  
on this.  
On the 28th November, 1713, a trea­  
ty of peace and another of commerce  
and navigation, were concluded at Ut­  
recht with Spain, renewing and insert­  
ing the treaty of May 13th, 1667, the  
xxi, and xxvi articles of which have  
been seen to coincide with the rules of  
neutral commerce, established by the  
v at Utrecht, between Great Bri­  
tain and France.  
I ana and Venice were comprehend­  
ed in the treaty of Utrecht, between  
Great Britain and Spam.  
  
, The above treaty of 1713, was coo-  
F firmed by article xii, of a treaty of De­  
cern! ar S, Uls, between Great-Britain  
1 and Spain.  
From the above date to the treaty of1  
{ 1748, at Aix la Chapede, the following J  
F J treaties between England and other  
1 &#x27;powers took place ; in each of which,

in all of which the neutral right, now l&lt;  
dcniei tßritain, was formally j;  
sanctioned by her stipulations.

ed.  
In the treaty o£commerce again with

in pursuance or Art. xvm.ef the trea­

from the 11 trecht are im&lt;  
word for word ; and thus received a- &#x27;  
new the most deliberate and formal &#x27;  
sanction—Chalm. vol. 1. p. 350.  
It mA) !&gt;e here again remarked, that  
although this treaty underwent the most &#x27;  
violent opposition iv Great Britain, it j  
does not appear that the opposition was j  
at all directed against the articles on 5  
the subject of neutral commerce.  
The treat, of 1786 was explained and I  
altered in several particulars, by a&#x27;cen­  
yent ion bearing date August 31, 178*;  
without any appearance of dissatisfac­  
tion, on either side, With the article-son  
neutral commerce.  
In thenegociations at Lisle, in 1797,  
it was proposed on the pari of Great  
Britain,by her ambassador, lord Malms- j  
bury, to insert, as heretofore usual in  
the articles of peace, a confirmation of  
.the treaties of Utrecht, Aix la Cha­  
■-, Sec. which was opposed by the  
French negociators, for reasons foreign  
to the articles of those treaties in ques­  
tion.  
On this occasion, lord Malmsbury, in  
urging the proposed insertion, observed,  
&quot; thatthase treaties had become the law  
of nations, and that if they were omit­  
ted it might produce confusion.&quot; This  
fact is attested by the negociations, as  
published by the British government.  
If the treaties had become, or were  
founded in, the law of nations ; such an  
omission, although it might be made a  
pretext for cavil between the parties,  
could een.iini\ have, no effect en the  
law of nation;,; and if the treaties ex­  
pressed the law of nations on any sub­  
ject at all, on what subject, it might be  
asked, have they been more explicit  
than on that of the maritime rights ol  
neutrals I  
This series of treaties, to which G.  
Britain is atwimmediaU party, lengthy  
stro. gas it is, has hot exhausted the  
examples by winch she stands self-COn­  
ined. One, in particular, remains  
consideration; which1, if It stood a­  
ione,.ought forever to silence her pre­  
tensions. It is the treaty with HUSSiaon  
the 5—17 cf -&#x27;une, I  
  
No. DCCCXXIX.  
  
PAID IN AUV4NCE.  
  
II A very important part of the treaty  
is the preamble :  
&quot; The mutual desire of his majesty  
the king of the United Kingdoms, &amp;.c\
and Ms majesty the emperor of all the  
Russias, being not only to come to an

Itftiir account ; which merchandise  
i Cannot be except* case from the  
freedom grmt-il to the fiagof the said  
I ower.&quot; See. he.  
These extracts will receive addition*  
!al weight from the following considera­  
tions, :  
j first, This treaty made with Rus­  
sia, the power that took the lead in as­  
serting the principles of the armed  
neutrality, was, with exceptions not af­  
fecting the point in question, acceded  
t &gt; by Sweden and Denmark, the twa fa­  
ther European powers most deeply in­  
terested in, and attached to those prin­  
ciples. It is a treaty, therefore, ot  
Great Britain, as to this particular  
p tat, .s v ell as to most of the others  
with Russia, Sweden and Denmark.  
Secondly. The treaty had for its  
object, as appears by its adopti­  
on of so mam of the definitions it the  
armed neutrality, to fix the law of na­  
tions on the several points therein,  
which had been so much contested ; the  
three northern powers yielding the  
point of free ships, free goods ; &amp;. Greet  
| Britain yielding to all of them, those  
j relating to the coasting, as well as eve­  
ry other branch ot neutral trades ; to  
blockades, and to the mode of search ;  
I and yielding to Husiia, moreover, the  
! point relating to the limitation of coti­  
&#x27;trabaud. VVith respect to the case(f  
| convoys, a case not comprehended in  
llr; armed neutrality of 17t(), but ef  
much subsequent litigation, and insert*  
jed in that of I8&amp;G ; a modification, Sa­  
tisfactory tothe northern powers, was  
J yielded by Great Britain ; with a joint  
i agreement, that the subjects on both  
should be prohibited from carry­  
ing contraband or prohibited goods, aw­  
csrdlog to an article in the armed neu­  
trality ol both dates.  
Thirdly* The treaty is expressly de­  
clared to be an invariable dettrtuinfc­  
tibii [fixation] of their firinciftle* upb&amp;  
I the rtghls oj neutrality, In their  
j plication to their respective monar­  
chies.&quot;  
It cannot be pretended tint this ■  
j pulated application ot the rights of neu­  
trality to the contracting parties, limits  
the declaratory effect, which is equally  
applicable to al! neutral nations. 2*Hn~  
ctplcs and rights must be the same in  
all cases, and in relation to all nations.;  
and it would not he less absurd than it  
would to profess one  
set of principles or rights in the liw of  
nations towards one nation, and another  
set towards another nation.  
If there be any parts of the treaty,  
to which this declaratory character is  
regarded as not applicable, it cannot bo  
nded that they are the pafCS rela*  
ting to the rights of neutrals to tl  
fret ly to the p.or s and on the c idstn t i  
nations at w r ; b&lt; c Hi c, as already cb­  
■ di, the n am oi)&#x27;; ot. of the treaty  
was to settle the questions involved in  
the armed neCttnlitj ; of which this  
was a primary one, and is here placed  
by the ftructuro of t! und?er the  
same precise &#x27;stipulation, with the lia­  
bility to confiscation, ot enemy*  
In neutral shins ; a point »

have wished to consecrate as the I  
nations, by ceclaraiery acts mr that,

The latter instruction remained in force till January 1799, when  
a new one was substituted, which remained unrevoked to the  
end of the war. By this last royal order a further relaxation of  
the rule of law was introduced, in consideration, as the preamble

The decisions of the Admiralty Courts, and.of the Lords Com-  
  
missioners of Appeal, consequently proceeded uniformly upon  
the text of the last instructions: for the results, in various cases,  
we recommend a reference to page 24, and sequel to p. 35.  
. On the recommencement of hostilities with France in-1803, the  
same system was, with little variation, pursued. An instruction,  
however, dated the 24th of June in that year, directed the com-  
manders of his majesty’s ships of war and privateers ** not to  
seize any neutral vessels which should be found carrying on trade  
directly between the colonies of the enemy and the neutral coune  
try to which the vessel belonged, and Jaden with property of  
the inhabitants of such neutral country ; provided that such neu-  
tral vessel should not be supplying, nor should have, on the out-  
ward voyage, supplied the enemy with any articles contraband  
of war, and should not be trading with any blockaded ports.”  
  
From the whole. statement of the historical facts up to this  
time, it-clearly appears, ‘ that we have receded very far in prac-  
tice from the application of the equitable rule of the war of 1756  
in some points, while we have adhered to it in others; but that

Nassau on the ground that it was of the growth of Spain,  
which decision he contended was contrary .to the law of  
nations, and requested that suitable instructions might  
be despatched to the proper officers in the West-In­  
dies, to prevent like abuses in future. Ixird Hawkes­  
bury in a reply of April 14t\ communicated the re­  
port of the king’s advocate general, in which it is  
expressly stated that the produce of an enemy may  
be imported by a neutral into his own country, and  
re-exported thence to the mother country; and in  
like manner in that circuitous mode, that the pro­  
duce and manufactures of the mother countrv might  
find their way to its colonies; that the landing the  
goods and paying the duties in the neutral country,  
broke the continuity of the voyage, and legalized the  
trade, although the goods were re-shipped in the  
same vessel on account of the same neutral proprie­  
tors, and forwarded for sale to the mother country of  
the colony.. It merits attention in this report, (so  
clearly and positive is the doctrine laid down, that  
the landing the goods and paying the duties in the  
neutral, country broke the continuity of the voyage)  
that it is stated as a doubtful point whether the mere

We&#x27;ctoh&#x27;all occastooally, however, oﬀer an  
&quot;&#x27;_&#x27;-&lt;c;_tract, ealcutated to awaken public atten­  
sisi don. &#x27; lt commences as follows :  
in times of peace among all nations,their  
&#x27;si-ctcommcrcial intercottrse is under no other  
-restrictions than what may be imposed by  
&#x27;thectrespective laws, or their mutual com­  
—-_pacts.* &quot;No one or more nations can justly  
  
ss&#x27;ssconss l the commerce between any-two  
&#x27; orMof the others.  
&#x27; &quot;en war happens between any two or  
more nations., assquestion arises, in what&quot;  
respect it can aﬂeet the commerce of na­  
Jtious not engaged in the war? si &quot;  
Between the nations not engaged&#x27;siin the  
war, it is evident that the commerce cannot  
be aﬀected at all by a war between others.  
As a nation not&#x27;engnged in the war re­  
—-l_nains in the same re-ations of&#x27; amity and  
&quot;of commercial pursuits, with each of &quot;the  
besiligerent nations, as existed prior to the  
war, it w0uld seem that the War could not  
affect the intercourse between the nentral  
and either of the belligerent nations-: and  
that—the neuttal nation mighsitreat &amp; trade  
with either-,or both the belitgerent nations,  
with the same freedom as if no War- had  
had arisen between them. This, as the  
general-rule, is sufficiently estabiis&#x27;hed.  
But inasmuch-asss the trade of a netttral  
&quot; nation with a belligerent nation might, in  
si certain special cases. aﬀecfth&#x27;e safety of its  
antngo&#x27;n&#x27;tst,&quot; usage, founded on. the princi­  
&#x27;-ple of necessity, has admitted a few ex­  
ceptiuns to the general rule.  
Thus, all inszruments of war, going-in­  
to the hands ol one belligcrent nation,  
may be intercepted on the high seas,siby  
its ad versary. -  
lnsi&#x27;like manner, a neutral tr&#x27;ade with  
&#x27;a place actually besieged, is liable ta-be  
interrupted by the besiegers.  
lt is maintained also on one side, tho&#x27;  
strongly contested on the other. that the  
property of a nation at war, in a neutrai  
ship, may bessscizcd and condemned by  
—ct-the enemy of that nation. ,  
&#x27;Bo&#x27;tsiese exceptions, Great&#x27;Britain has  
uzdertalteo to add another, as important  
as it is new. si She asserts :: right to in.  
terce&#x27;pt t&#x27;hesi tude of neutrals with her ene  
mies in&#x27;siall cases where the trade, as is  
&#x27;respects the-ship,.the cargo, or even the  
individual port of destination, was not as  
free before the war,si*as it is made during  
full: war. _ _ _ si

&#x27;ssssgbvessrnment and courts have not, as yet,  
eittended it&#x27;besiyond the made of neutrals  
on the cnasts, and With the colonies of  
encmies.si But it is mztnisest. that this ii­

siexpediency Only ; and that the doczrine  
&#x27;is necessarily applicahle to every other  
&quot;branch of ncutral commerce-si-wi-th a belli.

sir&quot;? P&#x27;crettsion. To prepare&#x27;the&#x27; way for  
this exami&#x27;nation; several remarks are to  
be: premiscd. &quot;  
  
A  
  
_ First. &#x27;l&#x27;hegeneralss-rnle- being thatthe  
&#x27;si-trade&#x27;si be&#x27;tWeen a neutral and belligcrent  
lnation is as free as if the latter were at  
{peace with all nations, and the cases in  
i whichit is not as free being exceptions,  
to the genersil rule, the exCeptions accord­  
ing to the received mantm siof interpreta­  
tion, are to be taken strictly against those  
claiming the benestt of the exceptions, and  
lssavurably for those claim-ing the bent—fit&#x27;isf  
thegeneralrule. .  
- Secondly. siT-he e&#x27;xceptions being inund­  
ed on a principle&quot;of-neces&#x27;sssity, in oppo&#x27;sition  
to ordinary right, the necessity ought to  
-be evident and—urgent.--—Insi proportion  
as the necessity-may be dosiubtful, and still  
more in proportion as the sacrifice of nen­  
tsi-nl interest would exceed the advantage  
to the belliger- m the excepeion latls.  
Thirdlctv. The progress ofthelaw of nati­  
ons, undersithe inﬂuence olssscience and hu­  
manity, is tsinitignting the evils of war, and  
dimiotshtng the motives to it, by favoring  
the righte: of those remaining at peace, ra­  
ther than at thou: Who enter into war. Not  
only are the laws of war tempered between  
the pcturties at war, but mach also !D rela­  
tioo to those at peace.  
&#x27; R. pcatinsig then &#x27;that every belligerent  
right to controul tct-eutrnl &quot;commerce mnit  
as an exception to the general freedom of  
comfnerce, he positively and strictly pro­  
&#x27;vi&lt;led,and&#x27;the more strictly asthe excep­  
t&#x27;ions are in :: coorseo &#x27;resstriction rather  
than extention, ctthe-queStionsiie ready for  
exa&#x27;mtttatisim, whether it be a part. usthcct law  
of nations, that a trade ordinarily shut in  
time of peace, and opened to neucrals in  
time of war, is liable, as much as a trade  
in contrabmd of war or with a blockaded  
  
  
) port. to-c&#x27;a&#x27;ptut&#x27;c and condemnution.

any of she cases, when: a new trade tho&#x27;  
opened during a war; is not Opeuzcd (m &#x27;a&#x27;c­

havehad their origin and their continuance

-with i&#x27;ew if any exceptions at all times more  
  
just, more rational and more&#x27;benevolent,  
than the spirit-of the law derived from  
practice only; and consequently, -tl&#x27;lat all  
farther meliorations of the code of public  
law, are to be expected lrom the former,  
notthe latter source; and consequently, a.  
gain, that all enltghtenedct&#x27; friends to the  
happiness of nations ought to sat-or the in­  
fiue ce of treaties. on thessgreat codectby  
which their intercourse is to be regulated.  
The authority of every treaty is to be  
considered as opposed to the principle as­  
serted by Great Britain, where it either  
Stipulates age.-neral freedom of neutsiral  
commercc with a specificatiun of excep­  
tions to it, andau omission of this British  
exccption ; or where it stipulatcs not only  
a neutral right generally to afree trade

right to trade freely to and between the-parts

the force of the terms, necessarily cann­  
prehend the coasting and collonial trades,

By a treat) concerning navigation and  
commcrce in sixteen hundred and fifty pre­  
cedcd by a part: cular artille on the same  
subject, concluded in sixteen hundred and  
forty eighty, itis stipulasiccd between the  
United Piovinces &amp; Spain, &quot; -&#x27;] hat the sub­  
jects and inhab-tanis of the United Pro.  
vinces, and those of Spain reciprocally,  
may sail and trade with all freedom and  
  
safety in all the kingdoms states and coun­  
  
tries which are or shall be in peace, amity,  
or neutrality with the state of the said U.  
  
Provincee, and that they shall nocbesidzs­  
  
gsiquietsieﬂ or &quot;in olestefssd in this] liberty&#x27;by— ctthe  
&quot;ships-or subjects siofsithess king of- Spain, tip-si  
on the account ofhastililies, which may ex­  
isc or happen afterward-, between the&#x27; said  
niting-of Spain and the atsiiresssaid si- kingdoms,  
countries and-states, or any, of- them that  
may-be in amity,or nentraltty with the said  
lordssithe states—as above.&quot; ss  
This liberty insirelation to France was  
to extend to—all sorts of merchandise  
which mightbsie carried thither before she  
was-at was with—Spain, even-contrabandoi  
war, not. proceeding from the states of  
Spain herself, and capable of being used  
against the Spanish dominions. 1  
With respect to other countries at peace &quot;?  
with the United - Provi-nces, and at war,  
with Spain, the enumerated articles of con- l  
trabund were not to be carried to theml  
by the Unit:d Provinces, but all articlesl  
not contraband were to be freely carried  
with- the exception only ol c1ties- and places,  
inves&#x27;ted -or blockaded.  
The Pyrenean treaty between France &amp;  
Spain in siXteen hundred and fil&#x27;ty nine, es­  
tabllshed so close alriendship between the  
two nations, that the) are mutually re­  
s-raincd [tom giving either of them to  
those attacking the other, any assistance in  
Men money or rictuals, or with passage  
through his dominions. Yet it is stated in  
articles ten and sixteen which are r-ecipro­  
cal,that the French shall have liberty to trade  
to all parts whatsuever, though they should  
be in awar with his cutholic majesty, ex­  
cepting Portugal, whilst it continued in  
the condition it then was in : all merchan­  
ttiSe may be transported to Other count-ries,  
in war with Spam,as was allowed before  
(he: will war, eXCepting such as proceed  
from the Spanish dominiong, and as may be  
serviceable against the catholic king or his  
dominions, and contraband goods. By  
contraband goods are understood all sorts  
of arms or warlike stores;—but corn and  
all manner of&#x27;provisions and goods, notbe­  
ing arms and warlike &#x27;stores, are not reput­  
ed contraband, and they may be carried  
to &quot;places in war with Spain, excepting to  
Portugal and blnclzaded places. she  
Frenost vessels passing from the parts of  
Spa&#x27;zn to any portin enmity with that crown  
shall not be in any way recorded or mo­  
&#x27;lcsted, after producing their passes, speci­  
fying their lading.  
  
  
  
lt here appears that me parties were at  
liberty, when nentra&#x27;l, to tradc to all parts  
ofa belligerent country, not blockaded, and  
in all merchandises not contraband.  
The expression &quot; as was allowed before  
the said war,&quot; in this and in the preced­  
ing examples clearly fall Within the obser­  
vatinns made on the like expressions, used  
by t&#x27;s&#x27;riters- on the law of nations. They  
are merely a mode os describing the inde­  
finite right to trade, as if no war had aris­  
en and consequently to enter into any new  
Channels of trade which might be opened  
to them.  
ss ln&#x27;a treaty in 1662. between France and  
the United Provinces, it is stipolated, art.  
X}; I—XXVH. Ere. that the parties re­  
ciprocally are to trade and navigate with all  
freedom and safety to countries respecss­  
tively at war with one and at peace with  
the other, without any exceptions made by  
the treaty, other than a trade in contra.  
hand, or to a place siblockaded. .  
si&#x27;siThe treaty between France and the U.  
nited Prcvincea, XXVll—XXl-X, as in­  
corporated with the treaty of Bredn in  
1667, between the latter power and Eng­  
land, declares that the subjects of either  
  
  
pctrty may sail and trafiie in all countries at ct  
  
any time, in peace with one and at war  
siwith the other, and this transportation and  
  
traﬄc shall extend to all articct&#x27;es not contrass ss  
  
band, andto asillctolircrs not blockadcd. *  
[n.a treaty in 1672, etweett France and  
Sweden, art. X—Klil—KZUX, are of cor­  
responding import.  
A treaty in 1675, between chden and  
the United &quot;Provinces, contains like strpu­  
latiuus in the three first and following arti­  
cles.  
  
A dt—siclnration made in 1676, by Spam  
and the&#x27;United Provinces, &#x27;cunfirming the  
treaty of 1&#x27;650, stipulates the right of ei.  
ther party to trade with the enemy or the  
other, as well directly az between enemy&#x27;s  
-ports,-whether the parts belong to the  
same or diﬀerest enemies, contraband  
-goods and places blockadcdsibeing except.  
ed.  
in article&#x27;xnl. &amp;c. of another treaty in  
1678, between France and the &#x27;United  
Provinces, the same points are again sti­  
pulated.  
The xul. articles of another treaty in  
1679. between SWeden and tbeUnitcd  
ss-Provinces, contains alike stipulation.  
So again the&#x27;hke &#x27;atipulationgis contained

This document, after stating &quot; that&#x27;some  
ssdifficnlty had.-varisen concerning the inter­  
pretation of certain articles, as well in the  
treaty manne concluded? this first day of  
-December,-1674, as in that which was  
siconcltide&#x27;d the 17th February, 1667—8 be­  
tween his tnsiaj&#x27;esty of&#x27;Greatsi Bmmn on the

other-part,&quot; proceeds; to state, &quot;that sir  
William &#x27;l&#x27;enipiezss-Ect. on ene part, with  
eight commissiuners on the other,hasive de—  
clared.siand do by these-presents declare,  
&#x27;that the true meaning and &#x27;lﬂsUﬂllOD-Uf the  
said article is, and oughtto be, that ships  
and vessels behmgmgct to the subjeccs-of  
either of the parties, can and might, from  
the time that the&#x27;said articles were consi  
cluded, not only &#x27;pAfSS, traﬄc and made,  
from a neucrnl port or place, to a place  
in-enmity with the other party, or from a  
place in enmizy (() a nentrul place, but al­  
  
so from a port or place in enmity to a port  
or place in enmtty- with the other party,  
whether the satd places belong to one and  
the same prince or state, or to several  
princes or states, with whom the other  
party is in war. And we declare this is the  
true and genuine sense and meaning of the  
said articsites; puranant wheretinto&#x27; Wenn­  
derstantl that tlsiie- said arttcles are to be ub­  
sert-ed and ex-xcnted on all occasions, on  
the part of his said majesty, and the said  
states general, and their respective mld-.­  
jects; yet so that &#x27;this declaration shall not  
be alledged by &#x27;ctther party for matters­  
which happened bsizsore the conclusion of  
the late peace in the month of Fabrnary,­  
1673—4.  
Prior-to the peace, neither of them could&#x27;  
claim the rights of neucrality against the  
&#x27;Other.  
This declaratory stipnlation has been  
said robe-peculiarly important. it is so&#x27;  
for several reasons.  
lstsi. Because it determines the right-of  
the neutral party, so far as may depend on  
the&quot; behigerent party, to trade not. only be­  
tween its own parts and those of the ene­  
mies of the belligerent party, without any  
exception of colunies, but between any  
Other&#x27;neutral port and enemiesporssts, with­  
ontexception of colonial ports of the ensie.  
my; and moreover. not only between the  
ports, colonial as well as Others, of one  
enemysi and another enemy, but between  
the drssctent porss of the same enemy; and  
consequently between one port and another  
of the princrpal country; between these  
and the ports of its colontessi; between the  
ports of one colonctv and another, and even  
to carry on the coastingtrade of any part:­  
  
cular colony.  
  
—2d. Because it fixes the meamng not on.  
ly of the articles in the two specisiad tr3a\
ties ;&#x27; but has the same eﬀect on all other  
supulatious by Great Britaio expressed m  
the same on equivalent terms; one or Other  
of which-me used in most, if not in all  
her treaiiea on this subject. si  
Sd. Because it made a part of the trea­  
ties exPZaim—zd, that free ships should make  
free goods ; and consequently, the coasting  
and colonial trade. when wmbined with  
that oeutmladvantage, was the less Likely  
to be aus-khowchged, if not considered as  
dearly be!-mg&#x27;mg to the neutrai-party.

&#x27; Cdo  
; Could the principle maintained against  
ctGreat-Britain be more clearly laid down,  
  
los more strongly fortified by her sanctt­  
on ?  
  
  
Tc give to this example the complete el­  
si sect which it ought to have, several remarks -  
&#x27;are proper.  
In the first place on comparing the de­  
scription given by the free trade which  
&quot;might &#x27;be carried on- between the neutral  
party, and an enemy of the other party  
with the description of the free trade al­  
lowed between the parties themselves,&#x27; by  
the lst article of the treaty, it appears that  
in order to except the colonial trade in the  
latter - case, the freedom stipnlate&#x27;d -in  
article [. is expressly limited to Europe.  
The terms are, *&#x27; that th&#x27;frz- shall be&#x27;a re­  
ciproca: and entirely perltu liberty of na.  
vigetion and commerce between the sub­  
jects on each part, through all and every  
the kingdoms, states, and dominions of  
their royal majesties in Europe.&quot; &#x27;in the  
stipulsitttuu rt luting to the nemral commerce  
ol either with the enemy of theiother.(who,  
if &amp; martttime enemy,&quot; could not fail to pos.  
sess colontes out of Europe) the terms are,  
-* that all mercttandizes, not contruband,  
may be carried in the sreestsstttanner to pla­  
ces belonging to an enemy, such towns or  
places only being excepted. as are at that  
time besieged, or-bl-sickaded, &amp;c,&quot; with- &#x27;  
out any litnttetion to- Europe, or ectsiiception  
of colonies any where. It is obvious, that  
the terms here used comprehend all colo­  
*nies, as much as the tet sits in the first arti­  
cle would-have done, if colonies had not  
been excepzed by lit-niting the freedom of  
  
si trtttle to places &quot; in Europe,? and conse­  
  
  
  
qtently tltzttit any distincuon between tne  
ctsizloni: tl and other places of an enemy, had  
been contempt tted in the neuralttade ol  
e: ther partt \.itt1&#x27;nim,au it waz contem­  
plated be ween the coionies and European  
possessions of the parties, in their com.  
met ee to be carried on between themselves,  
the. tlistinction would hate been expressed  
in the latter case, as it was in the for­  
{mer ; nd not&#x27;being so expressed. the trade  
{in the latter case Was to be free to the colo­  
tnies, as.would have been in the former, if  
* the coloniea had not been excepted by the  
[imitation of the trade osFurope.  
Secondly. But the treaty not content  
[with this necessary consthtion, in f-avor  
-cf a neutral commerce with the colonies of  
:an enemy, p. oceeds, in consormity to the  
lexample in the declaratory convention be­  
  
tween England and Hoilandtn1674, ex­  
  
  
plicitly to declare the lreedom of the nen-i  
tr-al party, to trade not only from any part,  
  
;to the places of an enemy., and from the  
  
places of an enemy to neucral places, but  
  
.! also&#x27;srom one, place to another .,place belong­

yiunciple that encmssy&#x27;e property is excepted from  
-the freedom of the neutral Bag, but is associnted  
with that recognition in the tame section of the  
articie, and even in the same sentence.  
I! it were possible to converc the construction  
here gin-0 to the treaty, a reference might be  
made to a very able speech delivered by lord  
Gremrli&#x27;e in the British House of Lords in No.  
vember, 1801, in which this very conllructioo  
is fully demonstrated. The demonstratian ]! ren­  
dered the more striking, by the rmbarrassesid  
and lsieeble Oppirsiliﬂﬂ made to it by the ing-erruity  
of the very aute lþeukers&#x27;who entered the list a- L  
  
  
  
ainit him. &#x27;­  
_ Such is the accomulated and irresifiible testi.  
mony borne bysi-Grrat Britain, in her&quot; own trea  
ties, against the thctsmc aﬀected by her.

treatiet to which she was not apart), but—which  
authorise some interenCcs and observations contri­  
&quot;curing still further, is possible, to invalidate her  
navel pretensions.  
The review heretofore taken of this elass of  
treatiet was litmtsied to such as proceded the arm.  
ed neutrality. &quot;Those now to be added, are prin.  
cipally the&#x27;sitreaties and corzveutiont entered into  
in&#x27;sirhe&#x27;yeatssi 1780 and 1800.  
&#x27;l&#x27;he treatres of 1780, declare the right of  
neutrals in the case Under discnsiion, in the ib].  
How terms: &quot;ctThat all vessels shall be permitted  
to navigatsse from port to part, and &quot;on the chaste—  
ol the belligent powersss.&quot; Those of 1800, are  
in terms too-little varied to require recital,  
It has ne-ver&#x27; been questiuned, that these desi.si  
  
nitiors of the neutral right were as epplieasible&#x27;ct&#x27;to -T_  
  
  
  
colonies- as to any other-of the territoriet belong. ;  
  
ing to a belligent nation. Ali the British writers  
  
have- so unde:stood the texc, and in that sense, :;  
  
have employed their pens against it.  
It needs scarcely be remarked that the treatiee  
  
ss in question were stained with : view,not of mak­  
  
-rtg a new iaw oi nations, but of declaring and  
asserting the law as it actually stood. The pre.  
  
ss amble to the csimvention of 1800, for the resses.  
  
tablishment of an armed nentratitssv between Rus. .  
  
sia and Sweden, Expl&#x27;ains the object in the terms  
following : &quot; In order that the freedom of navi. ;  
  
gation and the security of merchand-se of the neu.  
tral powers may he ettablished, and (be princip-cter  
of the law of nations be fully ascerlaimd,-&amp;c.&quot;  
The preamble to the convention of 1780,  
  
states the principlea avowed by the parties to be :  
  
&quot; the principle: derived ltom tl eprimffive right:  
  
of nations.&quot;  
  
  
Lv—f  
  
The treaty of 1780 was originally concluded. ;  
  
!  
  
between Rusiia and Denmark. But it was ac.  
ceded to by Sweden, Radix, the United Pro. i  
  
vincer, Austria, Portugal and Napies; and in  
  
eﬀect, by--France and strain. &#x27; The principle! of sif  
  
the treaty had the sanction alssisi of the United  
States as America in their c-urzir-g ordinances.  
  
&#x27; That it is seen that withssthe exceptron ol Great­

¢ From this distinct and full view of the sentiments of Bynkers-  
hoek, it is clear, that the whole weight of his authority is opposed to  
the principle advanced by Great Britain’  
  
The reputation which Vatel (on the law of nations) enjoys  
in Great Britain, requires that he should be particularly con-  
sulted on this subject. As the basis of the true doctrine on  
the subject of neutral commerce, he lays down these princi-  
ples: ‘* That a neutral nation is bound to an exact impartla  
ity; that this impartiality relates solely to the war: thea,  
making impartiality the test of lawfulness in the conduct o  
anit and the mere pursuit of their own interest, without  
a design to injure any of the belligerents, the test of impartia-  
lity, he enters more particularly on the discussion of the ac-  
tive trade which neutral nations carry on with those at war.”  
—P. 25 to 31.  
  
-Martens is the last authority whose evidence ought to be  
heard on this question ; he was a professor of Jaw ina Hano-  
verian university, with a salary from the king of Great Br  
tain, as elector of Hanover, and has distinguished himself by  
several publications, which demonstrate his critical judgment

On the present subject, his authority is clear and full. He  
speaks firgt of neutral commerce according to the universal  
law of nations, and next of the modern law of nations with re-  
  
to neutral commerce, and its freedom as acknowledged  
by the powers of Europe: Admitting that necessity may au-  
thorise a power at war to hinder the conveyance of warlike  
sores to its enemies, so far as to sequester them till the end of  
the war, or to take them at their full value for his own use.  
Also, that the power at war may prohibit all commerce with  
sach places, ** as he is able to keep so blocked up as to pte-  
vent any foreigner from entering.”  
  
He then proceeds to maintain—  
  
“ That, since a belligerent power cannot exercise hostili-  
ties in~a neutral place, nor confiscate property belonging .to  
neutral subjects, such power ought not to confiscate the goods  
ofan enemy found in a neutral vessel navigating on a free or  
neutral sea, nor neutral goods found in the véssel of an enemy,  
provided however, in both cases, that these goods are not  
warlike stores,”  
  
With respect to the modern law of nations, he states it to  
be generally acknowledged by the powers of Europe, “ that a  
neutral power ought not to transport to either of the bellige-  
tent powers merchandises unequivocally intended for warlike  
purposes ; that treaties have sometimes swelled out this list  
with articles not evidently and unequivocally intended for  
such purposes ; at others have expressly declared these not to  
be contraband ; and that this last ought to be presumed tobe  
the case between powers having no treaties on the subject.”  
Merchandises then, which are‘not contraband, neutral powers  
have a right to transport them to the enemy, except it be to  
places blockaded.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
* Thus the authority of Martens undeniably concurs with that of  
his great predecessors, in deciding that the commerce between neutral  
and belligerent nations, with a very few @xceptions, is entirely free,  
and that these exceptions do not include any such pretension as that  
Great Britain, fo prohibit a trade otherwise lawful, merely because  
it might have been laid open to neutrals in consequence of the war.’

Inthe war of 1793, resulting from the French Revolution—* One  
of the first measures of the British government, was that of interdic.  
ting all neutral supplies of provésions to France, with a view to pro.  
duce submission by famine. ‘The project, however, had little other  
  
elect than to: disgust these most interested in neutral commerce, and  
  
least hostile to France. This was particularly the case with the  
United States, who did not fail to make the most strenuous remon.  
strances against so extraordinary a procceding. ‘The correspondence  
oftheir secretary of state with the British plenipotentiary, Mr. Ham.  
mond, and of Mr. Pinkney, the American plenipotentiary, with  
Lord” Grenville, the British secretary of state, are proofs of the  
eiergy with which the innovation was combgted, and of the feeble.  
ness and fallacy with which it was defended. : |  
  
* The next experiment of depredation on neutral commerce, was *  
directed (notwithstanfling the former abandonment of the principle  
inthe war of 1778, and the continuance of that abandonment into  
the early cases of the war of 1793,) against that carried on with the  
possessions of France in the West Indies. This experiment, too, fell  
with peculiar- weight on the United States. As early as November  
6, 1793, instructions were issued, which struck generally at the neu-  
tal commerce with the French West India islands. That of the  
  
hited States was the principal victim. The havoc was the greater,  
ecause the instructions being carried into operation before they were  
Promulged, took its commerce by surprise.

outcry of the merchants, but in the discussions and proceedings of  
the American government. Important restrictions on the commerce  
of Great Britain were agreed to by one branch of the congress, and  
negatived by a single vote in the other. A sequestration of British  
funds ,and effects in the United States was proposegypand strongly  
supported. And an embargo, withholding supplies essential to the  
subsistence of the British West-India islands actually passed into a  
law, and remained in force for some time. These measures at length  
gave way to the mission of a plenipotentiary extraordinary to the

voked, and, in lieu thereof, the following was issued: That his Ma.  
jesty’s ships of war, cruizers, &amp;c. should bring in for lawful adjadica.  
tion all vessels, with their cargoes, that are laden with goods the  
produce of any island or settlement belonging to France, Spain, or  
the United Provinces (Holland), and coming directly from any port  
of the said islands or settlements, fo any port in Europe, not being a  
port of this kingdom, nora port of that country to which such ships,  
being geutral ships, shall belong.  
  
‘ This new change sanctioned a direct trade from a// the French  
islands as well as-from those“in the West Indies, and also from the  
French settlements which were not islands ; with alike sanction toa  
like trade from the islands and settlements of the other enemies of  
Great Britain; to extend to neutrals in Europe the enjoyment of this  
trade ; with a refusal tothe American States of the direct trade trom  
those islands and settlements to such European neutrals ; and, finally,  
to permit to those States, as well as to the neutrals of Kurope, a di-  
rect trade from the hostile islands and settlements to Greai Britain  
herself. The policy of this measure conciliated the northern nations  
of Europe, then perhaps listening to a revival of the armed neutra-  
lity, and from whom no apprehensions were to be entertained of an  
injurious competition with the commercial interests of Great Britain;  
and, at the same time, it so far took the advantage of re-exportation  
out of the hands of the American merchants, from whom such a con-  
petition probably was apprehended.’

The Examination closes with a Review of the Reasons urged  
tn Defence of the British Principle. Sir William Scott, judge  
of the high court of admiralty ; Mr. Ward, who is sufficient&#x27;y  
known by his treatises on the-law of nations, one of which em-  
braces this precise object; and Mr. Brown, a professor of civil  
law in the university of Dublin, are considered by our author  
as the principal champions for the British claim.  
  
Sir William’s opinion is the first taken notice of ; and the  
following passage from his speech, in giving judgment in the  
case of the Immanuel, is given in his own words:  
  
* It is an indubitable right of the belligerent to possess himself.of  
such places (colonies) as of any other possession of his enemy. Th

isthe common right: but he has the certain means of carrying such a  
right into effect, if he has a decided superiority at sea, Such colonies  
are dependent for their existence, as colonies, on foreign supplies:  
if they cannot be supplied and defended, they must fall to the belli-  
  
ent of Course; and if the belligerent chooses to apply his means to  
such an object, what right has a third party, perfectly neutral, to step  
jn and prevent the execution ? No existing interest of his is affected  
by it; he can have no right to apply to his own use the beneficial  
consequencewof the mere act of the belligerent, and to say,—Truc it  
js, you have by force of arms forced such places out of the exclasive  
possession of the enemy, but I will share the benefit of the conquest,  
and by sharing its benefits prevent its progress. You have in effect,  
and by lawful means, turned the enemy out of the possession which  
he had exclusively maintained against the whole world, and with whom  
he had never presumed to interfere; but he will interpose to prevent  
  
his absolute surrender, by the means of that very opening, which the |  
  
prevalence of our arms alone has effected ; supplies shall be sent, and  
their products shall be exported; yon have lawfully destroyed his  
monopoly, but you shall not be permitted to possess it yourself; we  
insist to share the fruits of your victories; and your blood and trea-  
sure havé been expended, not for your own interests, but for the  
tommon benefit of others.—Upon these grounds, it cannot be con-  
teaded to be a right of neutrals to intrude into a commerce which had  
been uniformly shut against them, and which is now forced open  
merely by the pressure of war; for when the enemy, under an entire  
inability to supply his colonies and to export their products, affects  
to open them to neutrals, it is not his will, but his necessity, that  
changes his system. ‘That change is the direct and unavoidable conse-  
quence of the compulsion of war ; it isa measure not of French coun-  
cils, but of British force.’

tion with that of whether free ships make free goods ; and, un-  
der this confusion, they bring the former within the arguments

sion results not only from the more general expressions with

Examination of the British Doctrine, Ke: 441  
of the maritime principles of Great Britain, to deny the merit of  
garning, ingenuity, and a vein of candour more than is always found  
in such discussions. His attention, however, was almost wholly  
firected to the question, whether free ships make free goods? He  
as, indeed, some cursory observations in favour of the doctrine, that  
strade not customary in peace cannot be lawful in war. ‘These ob-  
grvations he concludes with one referred to by Mr. Ward, as of great  
force, on the general question between belligerent and neutral na-  
tions, namely, that, if this right-were admitted, it would be the inte-  
rst of all ‘commercial states to promote dissensions among their  
veighbours.’ eG. !  
  
  
  
  
  
-  
  
If there be any plausibility in this argument, it is all the  
merit, according to our author, that can be claimed for it.  
The wars which afflict mankind are not produced by the -in-  
trigues and cupidity of the weaker nations, who wish to remain  
in peace Whilst their: neighbours are at war. They are the  
spring of ambitious, and not unfrequently commercial rival-  
ships among the more powerful nations themselves. This 1s a  
fact attested by all history. If maxims of public law are to be  
tested, therefore, by their pacific tendency, such maxims, it  
evident, must be favoured as they circumscribe, not the  
rights and interests of neutral nations, but the belligerent and  
commercial interests of their more powerful and warlike  
neighbours. :  
As a further answer to the observations of the noble author,  
and as a final answer toall the arguments which are drawn from  
the intrinsic equity or conveniency of this principle, the fol-  
bwing considerations must have weight with all competent  
  
‘and candid judges.  
  
« In the first-place, it may be repeated, that, on a quéstion which  
  
‘Sto be decided, not only by the abstract precepts of reason, but by  
  
wiles of law positively in force, it is not sufficient to show on which  
fide of the question an intrinsic reasonableness can be traced ; it is  
necessary to show on which side the law, as in force, is found to be.  
In the resent case,, it has been shown, that this law is not for, but  
ainst the British side of the question,  
  
_* But, secondly, It is denied, that, if reason, equity, or conve-  
tence, were alone to decide the question, the decision would be dif-  
ferent from that which the law in force pronounces on it. War im-  
poses on neutral commerce a variety of privations and embarras:-  
ments ; it is reasonable, therefore, as well as lawful, that neutrals  
should enjoy the advantages which may happen to arise from war.’

the general rule, the exceptions, according to a received maxim of ing  
terpretation, are to be taken strictly against those claiming the be-  
nefit of the exceptions, amd favourably for those claiming ine bene~  
fit of the general rule, , ;  
  
* Secondly. Theexceptions being founded ona principle of ne-  
cessity, in opposition to ordinary right, the necessity ought to be evi-  
dent and urgert. In proportion asthe necessity may be daubtful,  
and still more in proportion as the sacrifice of neutral interests would  
exceed the advantage to the belligerent, the exception fails, _  
  
“Thirdly. The progress of the law of nations, under the influence  
of science and humanity, is mitigating the evils of war, and diminish-  
ing the motives to it, by favouring the rights of those remainingat  
peace, rather than of those who enter into war. Notonly are. the  
laws of war tempered between the parties at war, but much also in  
relation to those at peace.  
  
* Repeating, then, that every belligerent right to’ controul neutral  
commerce, must, as an exception to the. general freédom of come  
merce, be positivety and strictly proved; and the more strictly,  
as the exceptions are ina course of restriction rather than extension ;  
the question és ready for examination, whether it be a part of the law  
of nations, that a trade ordinarily shut in time of peace, and opened  
to neutrals in time of war, on account of the war, 18 liable, as. much  
as a trade in contraband of war or with.a blockaded port, to captutg  
and condemnation. rs&quot;  
  
* It will not be overlooked, that the principle, as thus laid down,  
does not extend to any of the cases where a new trade, though open-  
ed during a war, is not opened on account of the war, but on consi-  
derations which would produce the same measure if no war existed :  
from which follows another impertant observation; that fakingiato  
view the probable occurrence of such considerations, the still. grea-  
ter probability of a mixture of such with considerations derived ‘from  
the war, the impossibility of distinguishing the proportion of ‘these  
diferent ingredients in the mixture, with the evident disadvantage of  
rendering more complicated, instead of simplifying, a rule of conduct  
between independent nations, to be expounded and enforced by one  
of the parties themsélves, it would seem to require no great effort of  
candour to acknowledge the powerful objectiutt in practice to such  
a principle, were it really embraced by the most specious theory. :  
  
‘ But without dwelling on this view of the subject, however just in  
itself, the principle in question will be tried : basthas.  
  
‘ First—by the writings most generally received as the depositories  
and oracles of the law of nations :  
  
* Secondly—by the evidence of treaties ; aie  
  
‘ Thirdly—by the judgment of nations, other than Great Britain :  
  
‘ Fourthly —by the conduct of Great Britain herself: a Aa  
  
‘ Fifthly—by the reasoning employed in favour of the principle.”

terprizes, which were thought to be secure while within that limit. Your  
tordship will permit me to refer you to several examples of this kind,  
which were equally formal and official, in which the sense of his majesty’s  
government was declared very differently from what it has been in the late  
condemnations. In Robinson’s Reports, vol. 2, page 368, (case, the Polly,  
Lasky, master) it seems to have been clearly established by the learned  
judge of the court of admiralty, that an American has a right to import the  
produce of an enemy’s colony into the United States, and to send it on after-  
wards to the general commerce of Europe; and that the landing the  
goods, and paying the duties in the United States, should preclude all fur-  
ther question relative tothe yoyage. The terms “for his own use,” which  
are to be found in the report, are obviously intended to assert the claim only  
that the property shall be American, and not that of an enemy ; by ad-  
mitting the right to send on the produce afterwards to the general com-  
merce of urope, it is not possible that those terms should convey any other  
idea. A bona fide importation is also held by the judge to be satisfied by

sel going from the United States to a Spanish colony had been condemned  
by the vice admiralty court of Nassau, on the ground that it was of the  
growth of Spain, which decision he contended was contrary to the law of  
nations, and requested that suitable instructions might be dispatched to the  
  
roper officers in the West Indies, to prevent like abuses in future. Lord  
_cedran in a reply of April 1ith, communicated the report of the king’s  
advocate-general, in which it is expressly stated that the produce of an ene-  
my may be imported by a neutral into his own country, and re-exported  
thence to the mother country ; and in like manner, in that circuitous mode,  
that the produce and manufactures of the mother country might find their  
way to its colonies ; that the landing the goods and paying the duties in the  
neutral country broke the continuity of the voyage, and legalized the trade,  
although the goods were re-shippedin the same vessel,on accountof the same  
neutral proprietors, and forwarded for sale to the mother country of the  
colony. It merits attention in this report (soclearly and positively is the  
doctrine laid down, that the landing the goods and paying the duties in the  
neutral country broke the continuity of the voyage) that it is stated as a  
doubtful point whether the mere touching in the neutral country to obtai

crnmtty having seized American vessels, hound  
ti-o.n the United States to the Spanish West-ln.  
du-s, on the pretext that their furgoes consisted

wuo Great Britain, and the vice adtoirnl&#x27;y court  
of H assail havir g c mdcumed til* ear^oofottc of  
thowi vessel upon that pretext, Mr. Kit g, in a :  
  
note to lord Ilawkesburv of the 13th of March,  
1801, remonstrated against these acts as palpa­  
ble abuses. .The subject of this remonstrance  
was immediately referred to the king’s advocate,  
whose report of the 16th of March, 1801, after  
declaring that the sentence of the vice admiral­  
ty court was erroneous, concludes with the fol­  
lowing exposition of the law as understood in  
Great Britain, relative to the commerce of neu­  
trals with belligerents and their colonies. “ It is  
now distinctly understood, and has been repeat­  
edly so decided by the high court of appeal, that  
the produce of the colonies of the enemy may he  
imported by a neutral into his own country, and  
may be re-exported from thence, even to the mo­  
ther country of such colony ; and in like manner  
the produce and manufactures of the mother  
country may, in this circuitous mode, legally find  
their way to the colonies. The direct trade, how­  
ever, between the mother country and its colo­  
nies, has not, I apprehend, been recognised as le­  
gal, cither by his majesty’s government, or by his  
tribunals.  
  
“ What is a direct trade, or what amounts to  
an intermediate importation into the ncatrul coun­  
try, may sometimes be a question of some difli­  
culty. A general definition of either, applicable  
to all cases, cannot well be laid down. The ques­  
tion must depend upon the particular circumstan­  
ces of each case. Perhaps the mere touching in  
the neutral couutrv, to take fresh clearances, may  
properly be considered as a fraudulent evasion,  
and is in effect the direct trade ; but the high  
court of admiralty lias expressly decided (and I  
see no reason to expect that the court of appeal  
will vary the rule) that landing the goods and pay­  
ing the duties in the neutral country, breaks the  
continuity of. the voyage, and is such an importa­  
tion as legalizes the trade, although the goods be  
reshipped in the same vessel, and on account of  
the same neutral proprietors, and be forwarded  
for sale to the mother country or the colony.

my anxious recollection for one moment what it is that the duty  
of my station calls for from me ; namely, to consider myself as  
stationed here, not to deliver occasional and shifting opinions, to  
serve present purposes of particular national interest, but to ad-  
minister, with indifference that justice which the law of nations.  
holds out, without distinction, to independent states, some hap-  
pening to be neutral, and some to be belligerent. The seat of  
judicial authority is indeed locally here in the belligerent country,  
according to the known law and practice of nations ; but the Jaw  
ttself Has no localtty. It is the duty of the person who sits here,  
to determine this question exactly as he would determine the  
same question if sitting at Stockholm ;—to assert no pretentions  
on the part of Great Britain which he would not allow to Swe-  
den in the same circumstances ;—and to impose no duties on  
Sweden as a neutral country which he would not admit to belong  
to Great Britain in the same character. If, therefore, I mistake  
the law in this matter, I mistake that which I consider as the  
universal law upon the question ;—a question regarding one of  
the most important rights of belligerent nations, relatively to neu-  
trals.’ (1. Rob. 350.)

by the principles of the law of nations, as collected from autho

cember, 1675, was itself declaratory of the meaning of the trea-

William Temple‘ It is true, it contains a proviso, “that this  
declaration shall not be alleged by either party for matters  
which happened before the late peace, February, 1673-4.”  
But, before that peace, the two parties were at war with one  
another, and could not claim the rights of neutrality against  
each other, and previous to that war they were at peace with  
all the world; so that this reservation could not imply that ves-  
sels had been recently drawn into judgment on a different un-  
derstanding of the principle. Nor does the letter of Sir Leoline  
Jenkins, of the 6th of February, 1667, imply, that at that time a  
vessel carrying enemy’s goods between ports of an enemy was  
held liable to condemnation. It is admitted that the preceding  
letter of the Swedish resident adverted only to the circumstance  
of the vessel’s having carried enemy’s goods on her outward

my duty not to rely wholly on my own Memory or observation,

ing to some of his majesty’s allies, having carried goods belong-  
ing to his majesty’s enemies, from one enemy’s port to another,  
and being seized after it had discharged the said goods, laden  
with the proceeds of that freight which it had carried, and receiv-  
ed of the enemy upon the account of the ship’s owners, had

any such judgment or condemnation ever passed in the said  
court; and to this, their testimony, I must, as far as my experi-  
ence reaches, concur; and if my opinion be, as it seems to be,  
required, I do not, with submission to better judgment, know  
any thing, either in the stafutes of this realm, or in his majesty’s  
declarations upon occasion of the late war, nor yet in the laws  
and customs of the seas, that can (supposing the property of the  
said proceeds to be bona fide vested in the ship owners of his

First, whatc-ver a nation d &gt;cs iu use of  
it# own rights, and #ole*iy with a view to its  
own good, without partiality, without a de-  
eign of favoring one p-awnr to the prejudice  
of another, cannot, I say, iu general be  
c onsidered, as contrary to neutrality, and  
becomes such ouly upon par.ic&amp;lur occa-  
sions, when it cannot bike place without  
injury to one of the pirties, who ha9 then  
a particular ri^ht to oppose it. Thus, the  
besieger has a right to prohibit access to  
the place besieged. Exclusively of this  
kind of cases, the quarrel# of another can-  
not deprive me of the free disposal of my  
rlghis in the pursuit of measures w hich I  
Judge advantageous to my country. There-  
fore, when It is a custom in a nation, in or-  
der for employing and exercising its sub-  
jects, to permit levies of troops in favor of  
a power in whom it is pleased to confide,  
the enemy of this power cannot call these  
permission hostilities, unless given for in-  
vading his territories, or for tho defence of  
a cause manifestly odious and unjust. He  
cannot even claim, with any right, that the  
like should be* grouted to him, because vhia  
p*eop!e may have reasons to refuse him,  
which do not hold good with regard to his  
adversary: and who but this nation shall  
be judge of its own convenience * * * *  
If the sovereign or hie subjects lend money  
to my enemy, and refuse it to me * * *,  
if such preference be not founded on rea-  
sons; I may impute it to ill will against me,  
or to a predilection of m v enemy. If the  
loan be manifestly for enabling the enemy  
to attack me, this would be concuring in  
the war against me. Were such troops  
furnished to my enemy by the State itself,  
aud at its expense, as also the money lent  
to him without interest, it would be no  
longer a question whether such succor be  
incompatible with neutrality.  
  
Farther, it may be affirmed on the same  
principles, that if a uation trades in arm3,  
timber, ships, military stores, A-c., I cannot  
take it amiss that it sells such thing to my  
enemy, provided il does not refuse to cell  
them to me also. It carries on its trade  
without any design of Ldj jring me, aud in  
continuing it the tame as if I was not en-  
gaged In war, that nation gives mcnocauve  
of complaint. *****  
  
Let ns now discuss another point, name-  
ly, the trade whk h neutral nations carry-  
on with my enemy&#x27;s country. It is certain,  
as they hvva no part in my quarrel, they  
are under no obligation to abandon their  
trade, that they may avoid tarnishing my  
enemy with the means of making war. —  
Should they refuse to sell me any of these  
arliclo?, or by taking mcasnrtb for transport-  
ing great quantities of them to my enemy,  
with a manifest intentloa of favoring them,  
such a partiality would exclude them from  
the neutrality they enjoyed. Bat if th-y  
only c-oatinas their customary trade, they  
do not, therefore, declare themselves  
against my interest; they only exercise a  
right which they are under no obligation  
of Bicriflclng to me. * * *
