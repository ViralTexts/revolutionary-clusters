Sir,  
						London Octr. 10, 1807  
					  
					I have the honor to transmit to you by Doctr. Bullus a copy of my correspondence with Mr Canning on the subject which was committed to my care by your letter of the 6th. July last. You will find by it that the pressure which has been made on this  
						Government, in obedience to the instructions contained in that letter, has terminated in a decision to send a Minister to the U States, to adjust the business there. What the powers of that Minister will be; whether it is intended to confine them to the sole object of  
						reparation for the special outrage, or to extend them, in case the proposed separation of that from the general topic of impressment is admitted, to the latter object, it is not in my power to state. Mr Canning has given me no information on that head in conference, and his  
						note is not explicit on it. It states that the Minister who shall be sent to the United States to bring the dispute relative to the attack on the Chesapeake to a conclusion, shall not be empowered to entertain as connected with that  
							subject any proposition respecting the search of merchant vessels. A presumption is authorized by these terms that the Minister will have power to proceed to treat on the general topic after the special one is  
						arranged But it is possible that that presumption may have been raised for some other purpose or that the terms which excite it were introduced merely to convey the idea that the Mission should be confined to the  
						special object.  
					In the discharge of this delicate and important trust, I thought I should be able more effectually to promote its object by opening the subject to Mr Canning in conference, than by an official note. As the attitude taken by my government, which was  
						evidently supported by the whole nation, was of a very impressive nature, it seemed probable from the feverish state of the public mind here in regard to us, that a tone of conciliation which should not weaken the pressure, would be more likely to succeed in obtaining the  
						reparation desired, than in an official and peremptory demand. Under this impression I had several conferences with Mr Canning, the substance of which in each I will endeavour to state with precision. A knowledge of what passed in these interviews, in aid of that which is  
						afforded by the correspondence, will enable you to form the most correct idea of the object of the proposed Mission, that present circumstances will admit of.  
					The first interview was on the 3d. of Septemr. as soon as it could be obtained after the receipt of your letter of July 6 which was on the 30 August. I informed Mr Canning that as I wished the discussion in  
							which we were about to enter to terminate amicably and favorably to both our Governments, I had asked the interview for the purpose of promoting that desirable end and by explaining to each other  
						fully, in friendly conference, the views of our respective Governments relative to the late aggression. I was persuaded that it would be more easy for us to arrange the business to the satisfaction of  
						both parties, than by any other mode which we could pursue. He expressed his sensibility to that which I had chosen, and his readiness to concur in it. I then stated in detail, in explicit terms, the  
							reparation which my government thought the United States entitled to and expected that they should receive, for the injury and indignity offered by the late aggression: that the men taken from the frigate should be restored to it;  
						that the Officers who had committed the aggression should be exemplarily punished; that the practice of impressment from Merchant vessels should be suppressed; and that the reparation consisting of those several acts should be announced to our Government thro’ the medium of a  
						special mission, a solemnity which the extraordinary nature of the aggression particularly required. I observed that as the aggression and the principle on which it was founded had been frankly disavowed as soon as known, by his government, I was persuaded that there could be  
						no serious objection on its part, to any of the acts which it was desired should constitute the proposed reparation: that to the first act, the restoration of the men, there could doubtless be none; as the least that could be done, after such an outrage,  
							would be to replace the U States as far as it might be practicable, on the ground they held before the injury was received: that the punishment of the Officers followed as a necessary consequence to the disavowal of  
						the act: that the suppression of the practice of impressment from Merchant vessels had been made indispensable by the late aggression, for reasons which were suffficiently well known to him. I stated to him  the mode in which it was desired that the reparation should be made by a Special mission, was that which had been adopted by other powers, and by Great Britain herself for injuries less severe  
						than the one alluded to, of which I gave him the examples furnished me in your letter of July 6th. Mr Canning took a note of what I had stated, and made some general remarks on the whole subject, which were intended to  
						give his view of it, on each point, but without compromitting himself in a positive manner on any one. He said that by the proclamation of the President and the seizure and detention of some men who had landed on the coast to procure water, the government seemed to have taken  
						redress into its own hands; he complained of the difference which he said we had made between France and England, by restoring deserters to the vessels of the former and not the latter: he insisted that the late aggression was an act which differed in all respects from the  
						former practice; and ought not to be connected with it, as it shewed a disposition to make a particular incident in which they were in the wrong, instrumental to an accommodation in a case where his government held a different doctrine. I urged in reply  
						that the proclamation could not be considered as an act of hostility or retaliation for injuries, tho’ the aggression had provoked and would have justified any the strongest act of reprisal, but as a mere measure of Police which had  
						become indispensable for the preservation of order within the limits of the U States. I informed him that the men who had landed from the Squadron in defiance of the proclamation, and of the law on which it was founded, had been restored  
						to it, that with respect to the other point, the difference said to be made in the case of deserters from British and French ships I was unacquainted with the fact, but was satisfied if the statement was correct that the difference was imputable to the  
						local authorities, and not to the national government, because as the UStates were not bound by Treaty to restore deserters from the service of either nation, it was not presumable that their Government would interfere in the business. I observed however that if such a  
						preference had been given, there was a natural and justifiable cause for it, proceeding from the conduct of the squadrons of France and England on the coast of the U States, and on the main ocean, it being a well known fact, that the former did not maintain as a right or  
						adopt in practice the doctrine of the latter to impress seamen from our merchant vessels. I then discussed at length and urged with great earnestness the justice and policy of his terminating at this time all the differences which had arisen between Our Governments from this  
						cause, by an arrangement which should suppress the practice on the part of Great Britain, and remedy the evil of which she complained. In aid of those reasons which were applicable to the merits of the question, I urged the example given by the late  
						Ministry in the paper of Novr. 8 presented to Mr Pinkney and myself by the British Commissioners, which had, as I thought laid the foundation of such an arrangement. I stated that as it was stipulated by that paper, that the negotiation  
						should be kept open for the purpose of arranging this great interest without prejudice to the rights of either party, it was fairly to be understood as the sense of both parties that our rights were to be respected  
						’till that arangement was concluded, whence it would follow that the same effect would be produced in practice as if it had been provided for by Treaty. I relied on this paper and the construction which I  
							thought it admitted, with which however the practice had since, in no degree corresponded, to shew the extent to which the former Ministry had gone in meeting the just views of our government, and thereby to prove that the present  
						ministry, in improving that ground had nothing to apprehend from the preceding one. Mr. Canning admitted that the view which I had taken of that paper derived much support from its contents, and the time and circumstances under which it was presented, but persisted in his  
						desire to keep the subjects separate. I proposed as an expedient to get rid of his objection, that we should take up and arrange both points informally, in which case, provided it was done in a manner to be obligatory, I offered to frame my note, which should demand  
						reparation for the outrage, in general terms, so as that it should not appear by official document that the subjects had any connection in the negotiation.  
					I urged that unless it was intended to make no provision against impressment from Merchant vessels, I could see no objection to his meeting me on that ground, as after what had passed it was impossible to take up either subject without having the other  
							in view, and equally so to devise any mode which should keep them more completely separate than that which I proposed. Mr. Canning still adhered to his doctrine of having nothing to do with impressment from  
							Merchant vessels, till the affair of the Chesapeake was disposed of, after which he professed his willingness to proceed to the other object: In this manner the Conference ended; without having produced the  
							arrangement which I had hoped for from it. Mr Canning’s conduct was in all other respects conciliatory.  
					My note to Mr Canning was founded on the result of this conference. As it had not been in my power to come to any agreement with Mr Canning, on the great subject of impressment from merchant vessels, I considered it my duty to combine it  
						with the affair of the chesapeake in the paper which I presented him to claim reparation for the outrage. I thought it best however to omit the other acts of which it was desired that the reparation should consist. It seemed probable that a specification of each circumstance,  
						in the Note, would increase the indisposition of the Ministry to accommodate, and give it support with the Nation in a complete rejection of the demand. I expressed myself therefore in regard to the other acts, in general, and conciliatory terms, but with all the force in my  
						power. The details had been communicated to Mr Canning in conference too recently to be forgotten. Still it was just that no improper inference should be drawn from the omission of them. To prevent it I obtained an interview  
						of Mr Canning immediately after my note was presented, in which, after reminding him of the omission alluded to, the motives to which I presumed he could not mistake, I added that my object in asking the interview had been to  
							repeat to him informally, what I had stated in the former one, the other acts of which my government expected that the reparation should consist. In this interview, nothing occurred without the limit of the special object for which it had been obtained.  
						Mr Canning did not lead the conversation to any other topic, and I could not invite it.  
					Mr. Canning’s answer to my note was delayed more than a fortnight. Having refused to treat the subjects in connection, and intimated in plain terms that if I was not authorized to separate them, it  
						would be needless to prolong the discussion. I thought it improper to press it. My reply was equally explicit, so that with it, the negotiation ended. The measure which he announced as being determined on by the King, in case I could not agree to the separation was completely  
						the act of his government. You will observe that it is announced in a form which precludes in a great degree, the idea of its being adopted at my suggestion as an act of reparation, and in a tone of decision which seemed equally to preclude my holding any communication with  
						him on it.  
					My mission being thus brought to an end has afforded an opportunity for me to return to the U States, as I have long desired. Nothing but the great interest I take in the welfare of my country, and my earnest desire to give all the aid in my  
							power to the present administration in support of the pure principles of our most excellent Constitution, would have detained me here so long. In the present state however, it is not possible, if  
						in any it would be, for me to render any service by a longer continuance here. As soon therefore, as I had answered Mr Canning’s Note, I communicated to him my intention to return and requested, that he would be so good  
						as to obtain for me an audience of the King for the purpose of taking my leave of him. This was granted on the 7th. of this Month, in which I renewed the Assurance of the sincere desire of my  
						government to preserve the most friendly relation between the U States and Great Britain, which sentiment was reciprocated by His Majesty. Mr Pinkney succeeds me by an arrangement with Mr Canning, which will appear in  
						the inclosed Copy of my correspondence with him, and which I have full confidence the President will approve. I regret that in transferring the business  
						into his hands, I do not leave him altogether free from difficulty. I have the honor to be &amp;c

						P. S. Not being satisfied with the undefined character of the proposed Mission to the U States, and Mr Canning having communicated nothing to me on the Subject, in my interview with him on the day I was presented to the King, altho’ an opportunity was  
							afforded for the purpose, I wrote him a note after the commencement of this letter, to make certain enquiries on that head, a copy of which note and of his answer is herewith inclosed. You will observe that he still holds himself aloof on it. I thought it my duty and that  
							it comported with strict delicacy to make the enquiry, and I cannot but consider his reserve as affording cause for an unfavorable inference. It is probable however, as the door is left open for further communication between us, the moment of my  
							departure that he will take some other occasion to explain himself more fully on the subject You may be assured that I will seek every favorable opportunity to obtain such explanation from him.

London, October 10, 1807.  
Sir—l have the honor to transmit  
you by doctor Bullus, a copy of my  
cOrrespondence with Mr. Canning on  
the subject which was Committed to  
my care, by your letter ofthe 6th of  
July last. You will find by it that  
the pressure which has been made on  
this government, in obedience to the  
instruction contained in that letter,  
his terminated in a decision to send a  
minister to the United States, to ad­  
just the business there. What the  
powers of that minister will be ; whe­  
ther i. is intended to confine them to  
the sole object of reparation for the  
special outrage, or to extend them, in  
i case the proposed separation of that  
from the general topic of impress­  
ment is admitted, to the latter object,  
it is not in my power lo state. Mr,  
Canning has given me no information  
on that beau m conference, and lis  
note is not explicit on it. It states  
that the minister who shall be sent to  
the United States, to bring the dis­  
pute relative to the attack on the Che­  
sapeake to a conclusion, shall not be  
empowered to entertain, as connected  
with that subject, any proposition rc­  
i specling the search of merchant  
| sels—a presumption is authorized by  
I those terms, tnat the minister will  
! have power lo treat on the general  
i topic after the special one is arranged.  
j But it is possible mat that prusump­  
: t:on may have been raised for some  
! other pui pose, or that the terms which  
I excited it, were introduced merely to  
J convey the idea that tac mi  
; should be confined to tne special ob-  
I jeefc  
j In the discharge of  
| and important trust, I thought that I  
I should be able more effectually to  
I promote its object, by opening the  
I subject to Mr\ Canning in conference,  
! than by an As tne alii­  
n&#x27;by my government, which  
wascvi lently supported bj the whole  
&#x27;nation, was of a very impi esaive l.a-  
I lure, it se- name from the fe­  
verish slate ol the public mind .  
lin regard to us, that a tone oi\conciiia­  
tion, which should not weaken the  
pressure, would -c more likely to  
succeed in obtaining the reparation  
desired, than an official *x peremptory;  
demand. Under this impression, f  
had several conferences with  
Canning, the substance of which, m  
each, 1 will endeavor to ate with  
precision. A knowledge of what pas­  
sed in llu ws, m aid ol hat  
which is afforded by the correspon­  
dence, will enable you to foi m the  
most correct idea of the object of the  
proposed mission, that present cir­  
cumstances will admit of.  
The first interview was on the !&gt;d  
of September, as soon as it could be  
obtained, after the receipt eiyourlet­  
terof July the 6th, which was on the  
30th of August. 1 informed  
Canning, that as I wish. ctfs­  
sion in which we were about to enter,

London, October 10, 1807.  
Sir,  
I have the honor to transmit you +&gt;y  
doctor Rnllus, a copy of my correspondence  
with Mr Canning on the subject which was  
committed to my care, by your letter of  
the 6ih of J&#x27;dy last. You will find by it,  
that the pressure which has been made on  
this government, in obedience to the instruc­  
tion contained in that letter, has terminated  
in a decision to send a minister to the U.  
S. to adjust the business there. What the  
powers of that minister will be ; whether  
it is intended toconfine them to the sole ob­  
ject ol reparation for the special outrage,  
or to extend them, in case the proposed se­  
paration ol that from the general topic of  
impressment is admitted, to the latter ob­  
ject, it is not in my power to state. Mr.  
Canning has given me no information on  
that head in conference, and his note is not  
explicit on it. It states that the minister  
who shall he sent to the U. S. to bring the  
dispute relative to the attack on the Ches­  
apeake to a conclusion, shall not beetnpow­  
• t ec! to entertain, as connected wth that  
subject, any proposition respecting the  
search of merchant vessels—a presumption  
is authorised by those terms, that the mi­  
nister will have power to treat on the ge­  
neral topic alter the special one is arranged.  
Hut it is possible that that presumption may  
have been raised for some other purpose,  
or that the terms which excited it, were  
introduced merely to convey the idea that  
the mission should be confined to the speci­  
al object.  
In the discharge of this delicate and im­  
portant trust, I thought that 1 should he i.­  
ble more effectually to promote its object,  
by opening the -ubject to Mr Canning in con­  
ference, than by an official note. As the  
attitude t ken by my government, which  
was evidently supported by the whole nati­  
  
w.., impressive nature, it see­  
med probable from the feverish state of the  
public mind here in regard to us, that a tone  
ot conciliation which should not weaken the  
pressure, would be more likely to succeed  
in obtaining the reparation desired, than  
an official and peremptory demand. Un­  
der this impression, I had several confer­  
ences with Mr. (fanning, the substance cf  
which, in each, I wiilendeavor to state with  
precision. A knowledge of what passed in  
these interviews, in aid of that which is af­  
forded by the correspondence, will enable  
you to form the most correct idea of the oh­  
jeet of the proposed mission, that present  
circumstances will admit of.  
The first interview, was on the 3d of Sep.  
temher, as soon ns it could he obtained, af­  
ter the receipt of your letter of July the 6th,  
which was on the 30th of August. I infor­  
med Mr Canning, that as I wished the. dis­  
cussion in which we were about to enter,  
to terminate amicably and honorably to both  
our governments ; I had asked the inter­  
view, for the purpose of promoting that de­  
sirable end ; that by explaining to each o­  
ther fully, in friendly conference, the views  
of our respective governments, relative ti  
the late aggression, I was persuaded that  
it would be more easy for ns toarrai-ge tht  
business, to t.ie satisfaction &lt; f both parties  
than :&gt;y any other mode which wc could  
! pursue. He expressed his sensibility u  
that which I had chosen, and his r adiness  
to concur in it; I then stated in detaii, in  
i explicit terms, the rep ration which my go­  
vernment thought the U S. emitted to, m  
expected that they should rece ve, t-~r tht  
injury and indignity offered by the late ag­  
gression: that the-rre:i taken from the ft:  
gate should be restored to it; that the offi­  
cers who had committed the aggression  
  
Sin n.;- be rxi-fti »rily punished ; that the  
practice *t vrr.pr t f: om merchant  
vessels should : r - ij &#x27;pressed ; and that the  
reparation consisting of ill so several arts  
should be announced to our government,  
through ihe medium of a special mission,  
a solemnity •» fi »cli the extraordinary nature  
oi he agg e. : mi ; rticularly required. I  
observed that as the aggression and the prin­  
ciple on which it was founded had been  
frankly disavowed as soon as known, by hi®  
government, I was persuade ’ that there  
could be no serious objection on its part, to  
any of the acts which it was desired should  
constitute the proposed reparation : that to  
ll.r first act, the restoration of the men,  
’here could doubtless be none, as the least  
that could be done, after such an outrage,  
would be to replace the U. S. as far as it  
might be practicable on the ground they held  
♦ore the injury was received : that the  
punishment of the officers followed, as a ne­  
cessary consequence, to the disavowal of  
the act: that the suppression of the prac­  
tice of impressment Irom merchant vessels  
had been made indispensable by the iHte  
aggression, for reasons which were suffici­  
ently well known to him. I stated to him  
that the ovale in which it was desired that  
the reparation should be made, by a speci­  
al mission, was that which had been adop­  
ted b) other powers, and by Great Britain  
heiself, for injuries less severe than the one  
alluded to, of which I gave him the exam­  
ples furnished me in your letter of July 6th  
—Mr Canning took a note of what I had  
stated, and made some general remarks on  
the w hole subject, which were intended to  
give h s view of it, on each point, but with­  
out compromitting himself in a positive  
manner on any one. He said that, by the  
proclamation of the President, and the sei­  
zure and detention of some men who had  
landed on the coast to procure water, the  
government seemed to have taken redress  
■nto its own hands; hr complained of the  
difference which he said had been made be­  
tween France and England, bv restoring  
deserters to the vessels of the former, and  
not the latter s he insisted that the late ag­  
  
grcsslon was ah ticl different in all respects  
from the former practice, atul night not to  
be connected with it, :is it shewed a dispo­  
sition to make a particular incident, in which  
they were in the wrong, instrumental to an  
accommodation in a case where his govern*  
merit held a dilTtrent doctrine. I urged in  
reply, th at the proclamation could not be  
considered as an act of hostility or retalia­  
tion for injuries, though the aggression had  
provoked and would have justified any the  
strongest act of reprisal, but as a mere mea­  
sure of police, which had become indispen­  
sable for the preservation of order within  
the limitsnf the U. States; 1 informedhim  
that the men who had landed fr&lt; m the squa­  
dron, in defiance of the proclamation, and  
of the law on which it was fuunded, had J  
been restored to it: that with respect to the  
ether point in difference, said to be made  
in the case of deserters from British and  
French ships, 1 was unacquainted with the  
fact, but Was satisfied, if the statement was  
correct, that the difference was imputable  
to the local authorities, and not to the na­  
tional government, because as the U. States  
were not bpund by treaty to restore deser­  
ters from the service of either nation, it  
was not presumable that their government  
would interfere in the business. I observed,  
however, that if such a preference had  
been given, there was a natural and justi­  
fiable cause for it, proceeding fr&lt;- n the con- J  
duct of the squadrons of Franco and Eng­  
land, on the coast of the U. S. and on the :  
main ocean, it beinga well known fact that ,  
the former did not maintain as a right or  
adopt in practice the doctrine of the latter, i  
to impress seamen from our merchant ves- ,  
sels. I then discussed at length, and urged  
with great earnestness the justice ami po­  
! licy of his terminating at this time all tl;e  
j differences which had arisen between our  
governments from this cause, by an arrange*  
I meat which should suppress the practice on  
the part of Great Britain, and remedy the  
evil of which she complained.  
In aid of those reasons which were ap­  
plicable to tiie merits of the question, I ur­  
ged the example given ^y the late minis­  
try, in the paper of Nov. 8th, presented to  
Mr. Pinkney and myself, by the British  
commissioners, which had, as I thought,  
.laid the foundation of such an arrangement.  
! I stated that as it was stipulated by that  
paper, that the negociation should be kept  
r&#x27;MtPn foi* fllO luil&#x27;lw.t.i /»f  
  
v. » - ; »-t-V -o’&quot;o- o* —*  
interest, without prejudice to the rights of  
cither power, it was fairl)&#x27;to be understood  
as the sense of both parties, that our rights  
were to be respected, till that arrangement  
was concluded ; whence it would follow that  
the same effect would be produced in prac­  
tice, as if it had been provided for by trea­  
ty. I relied on this paper and the construc­  
tion which I thought it admitted, with  
which, however, the practice had since in  
no degree corresponded, to shew the extent  
to which the former ministry had gone in  
meeting the just views of our government,  
ami thereby to prove that the present min­  
istry in improving that ground had nothing  
to apprehend from the preceding one. Mr  
Canning admitted that the view which I  
had taken of this paper derived much sup­  
port from its contents, and the time arid  
circumstances under which it was present­  
ed, but persisted in his desire to keep the  
subjects seperate. I proposed, as an expe­  
dient to get rid of his objection} that we  
should take up and arrange both points in­  
formally, :n which case, provided it was  
done in a manner to be obligatory, I offer­  
ed to frame my note which should demand  
reparation for the outrage, in gtneral  
terms, so as that it should not appear by  
official document, that the subjects had any  
■i connection in the negociation. I urged that  
unless it was intended to make no provision  
against impressment from merchant ves­  
sels, I could see no objection to ins meet­  
ing me on that ground, as after what had  
passed, it was impossible to take up cither  
subject without having the other in view,  
j and equally so to devise any mode which  
! should keep them move completely st-pa­  
&#x27; rate, than that which I proposed. Air.  
Canning still, adhered to h doctrine of  
having nothing to do with impressment  
from merchant vessels, till the affair of the  
-Chesapeake was disposed of, after which  
| lie prof ^ed his willingness to proceed to  
i&#x27;:o other object. In this manner the con­  
! for: iv. ended, without having produced  
J v.r.gement which I had noped from  
I it. M&gt; l. ami!mr’s conduct was in all uiiier  
  
re^jv ,t&#x27;. conciliatory.  
My nme to Mr Canning was founded on  
the result of tins conference. As it had  
O&#x27; ’ l&lt; en in my power to coine to any agree­  
ment with tiiiii on the general subject of  
impressment from merchant vessels, I con­  
sidered it my duty to combine it with the  
&lt;»t.&quot;air of the Chesapeake, in the paper  
which I presented him to claim reparation  
for vhe outrage. I thought it best, howe­  
ver, to omit tho other acts, of which it was  
desired that the reparation should consist.  
It seemed probable that a specification of  
each circumstance, in the note, would in­  
crease the indisposition of the ministry to  
accommodate, end give it support with the  
nation, in a complete rejection of the de­  
mand. I expressed myself therefore in re­  
gard to the other acts, in general and con­  
ciliatory terms, but with all the force in  
my power The details had been commu­  
nicated to Mr Canning in conference too  
recently to be forgotten Still it was just  
that no improper inference should be drawn  
from the omision of them. To prevent it,  
I obtained an interview of Mr Canning im­  
mediately after my note was presented, in  
which, after reminding him of the omision  
alluded to, the motive to which • presu­  
med he could not mistake, I added that my  
object in asking the interview had been to  
repeat to him informally, what I had sta­  
ted in the former one, the other acts of  
which my government expected that the  
reparation should consist. In this inter­  
view nothing occurred without the limit of  
the special object, for which it had been ob­  
tained. Mr Canning did not lead the con­  
versation to any other topic, and I could  
not invite it.  
Mr Canning’s answer to my no*e was  
delayed more limn a fortnight. Having  
refused to treat the subject in connection,  
and intimated in plain terms that if I was  
not authorised to separate them, it would  
bcostlesst prolong the discussion, I thought  
it improper to press it. My reply was e­  
qually explicit, so that witn it the ncgoci­  
ation ended. The measure which he an- j  
nounccd, as being determined on by the &#x27;  
  
king, incase I could not agree totheseuar­  
Ktion, is Completely the net of It s guv&#x27;r-r.  
ment. You will observe that it i« &#x27;tui.tv,- .  
ced in a form which precludes in a »rc,;r  
degree, the idea of its hem* adopted ;u ,,  
suggestion, as an act of paration, and in  
a tea*: of decision which seemed equiWv to  
preclude my holding any cunmunicnttoti  
with himonit.  
My mission being thus brought to an end  
lias afford- d an opportunity for me to reI  
turn to the U. States, as I have long de n­  
rtd. Nothing but the great interest which  
1 take in the welfare oUnv countrv aud  
my earnest desire to give all th- aid hi  
my power to the present administration  
in support of the principles of our most ex­  
cellent sonstitution, would have detaine l  
me here so long. In the present state  
however, it is nr* possible, if i« any u  
would be, for me to render any service  
by a lunger continuance here. As Sf&gt;;J.  
therefore, as I had answered Mr Canoe,•-’*  
note, I communicated to htm my inttut.&quot; *  
to return, t requested that he would be‘ao  
good as to obtain forme an audienc** of the  
ing tor the purpose of takit g my lea. e of h m  
This was granted on the “th of this month,  
in which 1 renewed the assurance or the  
sincere desire of my government, to pre­  
serve the most friendly relation between  
the United States and Great Britain, which  
sentiment was reciprocated hy his majesty.  
Air Pinkney succeeds me by an arrange­  
ment with Mr Canning, which w,H appear  
in the enclosed copy ot my correspondence

the President will approve. 1 regret that

London, October 10, 1807­  
Sir,  
I have the honour to transmit you by doctor  
Bullus, a copy of my correspondence with Mr.  
Canning on the subject which was mininittrd to my  
rare, by your letter of theO&#x27;th ol July last. You  
will find by it, that the pressure which has been  
made on (his government, in obedieiire to the in­  
struction contained in that letter, has terminated  
in a decision to send a minister to the United States,  
to adjust the business there. What the powers ol  
that minister will he ; whether it is intended to con­  
fine them to the sole object of reparation for the  
special outrage, or to extend them, in rase the pro­  
posed separation of that from the general topick ol  
impressment is admitted, to the latter object, it is  
not in mv power Instate. Mr. Canning has given  
me no information on that head in conference, and  
his note is not explicit on it. It stales that the mi­  
nister who shall be sent to the United States, to  
tiling the dispute relative to the attark on the Che  
sapeake to a conclusion, shall not he empowered to  
entertain, as connected with that subject, any pro­  
position respecting the search of meu-hant vessels  
—a presumption is authorized by those terms, that  
the minister will have power to treat on the geneial  
topick utter the special one is arranged. But it is  
possible that that presumption may have heemais­  
ed for some other purpose, or that the terms which  
excited it, were introduced merely to&#x27; convey the  
idea that the mission should be confined to the spe­  
cial object.  
In the discharge of this delicate and important  
trust, I thought that I should be able more effectu­  
ally to promote ils object, by opening the subject  
to Mr. Canning in conference, than by an oflicial  
note. As the attitude taken by my government,  
which was evidently supported by the whole nation,  
was of a very impressive nature, it sremed proba­  
ble from the feverish state of the public mind here  
in regard to us, that a tone of conciliation, which  
should not weaken the pressure, would bp more like­  
ly to succeed in obtaining the reparation desired,  
than an official and peremptory demand Under  
this impression, I had several conferences with Mr.  
Canning, the substance of which, in each, I will  
endeavour to state with precision. A knowledge of  
what passed in these interviews, in aid of that  
whirh is afforded by the conference, will enable you  
to lorm the most correct idea of the object of the  
proposed mission, that present ciicumstanres will  
admit of.  
  
I ne first interview was on the 3d of September,  
as soon as it could be obtained, alter the receipt of  
your letter of July the 6th, which was on the 30tb |  
ol August. I informed Mr. Canning, that as 1  
wished the discussion in which we were about to  
enter, to terminate amicably and honourably to  
both our governments, 1 had asked the interview,  
for the puipose of promoting that desirable end ;  
that by explaining to each other fully, in friendly  
conference, the views of our respective govern­  
ments, lelative to the late aggression, 1 was per­  
suaded that it would be more easy for us to arrange  
the business, to the satisfaction of both parties,  
I ban by any other mode which we could procure.— I  
He expressed his sensibility to that which I had ;  
chosen, and his readiness to concur in it; I then I  
stated in detail, in explicit terms, the reparation  
which my government thought the United States j  
entitled to, and expected that they should receive, I  
for the injury and indignity offered by the late ag­  
gression ; that the men taken fioin the frigate  
should be restored to it; that the officers who had  
committed the aggression should he exemplaiily pu­  
i uished ; that the practice of impressment from  
j merchant vessels should be suppressed ; and that the  
reparuliun consisting of those several acts should  
j be announced to our government, through the me­  
dium of a special mission, a solemnity which the  
extraoidinary nature of the aggression particularly  
required. 1 observed that as the aggression and  
the principle on which it was founded had been  
frankly disavowed us soon as known, by his govern­  
ment, I was persuaded that there could be no seri­  
ous objection on its part, to any of the acts  
which it was desired should constitute the proposed  
reparation ; that to the first act, the restoration of  
the men, there could doubtless be none, as the  
least that could be done, after such an outrage,  
would be to replace the United States as far as it  
might be practicable, on the ground they held be­  
fore the injury was received : that the punishment  
of the officers followed, as a necessary consequence,  
to the disavowal of the art: that the suppression  
of the practice of impressment from merrhaut ves­  
sels hud been made indispensable by tbelate aggres­  
sion, for icasons whirh were sufficiently well known  
to him. I stated to him that the mode in which it  
was desired that the reparation should be made, by  
a special mission, was that which had been adopt­  
ed by other powers, and by Great-Brilain herself,  
for injuries less severe than the one alluded to, ol  
which I gave him the examples furnished me m  
yout letter of July 6tb.—Mr. Canning took a note  
of what 1 had stated, and made some general re  
marks on the whole subject, whirh were intended te  
give bis view ofit, on each point, but without coin­  
promitling himself in a positive manner on any one.  
  
Il« (aid that, by tbe proclamation of the president,  
and the seizure and detention of some men who bad  
landed on the roost to procure water, the govern­  
ment seemed to have taken redless into its own  
hands: be complained of the difference which he  
said had been made between France and England,  
ny restoring deserters to the vessels el&#x27; the former,  
and nut to the latter : he insisted that the late ag­  
gression was an act different in all respects from the  
loruief practice, and ought not to be connected  
with it, as it shewed a disposition to make a parti­  
cular incident, in which they were in the wrong, in­  
strumental to an accommodation in a case where  
Ins gyernment held a different doctrine. I urged  
in reply, that the proclamation could not be consi­  
dered as an art of hostility or retaliation for injuries,  
though the aggression had provoked and would have  
justified any tne strongest act of reprisal, but as a  
mere measure of polire, which had become indis­  
pensable tor the preservation of order within the li­  
miisol the United Slates; 1 informed him that the  
men who had landed from the squadron, in defiance  
ol tbe proclamation, and of the law on which it was  
founded, had been restored to it: that with respect  
to the other point in difference, said to be made in  
the case of deserters from British and French ships,  
I was unacquainted with the the fact, but was sa­  
tisfied if the statement was correct, that the differ­  
ence was imputable to the local authorities, and  
not to tlie national government, because as the U­  
mted Stales were not bound by treaty to restore de­  
serters irom the service of either nation, it was not  
  
pie&amp;uiiidme inai iheir government would interfere  
in the business. I observed, however, that it suf-h  
a preference lied been given, there was a natural  
and justifiable cause lor it, proceeding from the  
conduct of the squadrons of France and Kngland,  
on the coast of the United States, and on the main  
ocean, it being a well known fact that the former  
did not maintain as a right or adopt in practice the  
doctrine of the latter, to impress seamen from our  
merchant vessels. 1 then discussed at length, and  
ur^ed with great earnestness the justice and policy  
ol his terminating at this time all the differences  
which had arisen between our governments from  
ibis cause, by an arrangement which should sup­  
press the practices on the paitof Great-Uritain,  
and remedy the evil of which she complained.  
lu aid of those reasons which were applicable to  
the merits of the question, I urged the example  
given by the late ministry, in the paper of Nov.  
8th, presented to Mr. Pinckney and myself, by the  
British commissioners, which had, as 1 thought,  
laid the foundation of such an arrangement. I j  
stated that us it was stipulated by that paper, that  
the negotiation should be kept open for the purpose  
ot uriauging this great interest, without prejudice  
to the rights ol either power, it was fairly to he un­  
derstood as the sense of Loth parties, that our  
rights were to he respected, till that ariangement was  
concluded ; whence it would lullow that the same  
effect would he produced in practice, as if it bad  
been provided for by treaty. I relied on this paper  
and the construction which I thought it admitted,  
with which, however, the practice had since in no  
degree corresponded, to shew the extent to which  
the former ministry had gone in meeting the just  
views ot our government, and thereby to prove that  
the present ministry in improving that ground had  
nothing to apprehend Irom the preceding one. Mr.  
Canning admitted that the view which I had taken  
ol this paper derived much support from its con­  
tents and the time and circumstances under which  
it was presented, hut persisted in his desire to keep  
the subject separate. I proposed as an expedient  
to get rid ol his objection, that we should take up  
and arrange both points infoiinaily, in which case,  
provided it was done in a manner to he obligatory,  
I offered to frame my note which should demand re­  
paration for the outrage, in general terms, so as that  
it should not appear by official document, that the  
subje&#x27; ts had any connection in the negotiation, i  
urged that unless it was intended to make no nrovi­  
  
sion against impressment from merchant vessels, I  
could sre no objection to his meeting me on that  
ground, as after what had passed, it was impossible  
to take up either subject without having the other  
in view, and equally so to devise any mode which  
should keep them more completely separate, than  
that which I proposed. Mr. Canning still adhered  
to his doctrine ol having nothing to do with im­  
pressment front merchant vessels, till the affair of the  
Chesapeake was disposed of* after which he profess­  
ed his willingness to proceed to the other object.—  
In this manner the conference ended, without ha­  
ving produced the arrangement which I had hoped  
front it. Mr. Canning’s conduct was tn all other re­  
spects conciliatory.  
My note to Mr. Canning was founded on the re­  
sult of this conference. As it had not been in my  
power to conte to any agreement with hint on the  
general subject of impressment front merchant ves­  
sels, 1 considered it rny duty to combine it with the  
allair ot the Chesapeake, in the paper which I pre­  
sented him to claim the reparation for the outrage.  
I thought it best, however, to omit the other acts,  
of which it was desired that the reparation shoulJ  
consist. It seemed probable that a specification of  
each circumstance, in the note, would increase the  
indisposition of the ministry to accommodate, and  
give it support with the nation, in a complete rejecti­  
on of the demand. I expressed myself therefore in  
regard to the other acts, in general and conciliatory  
terms, but with all the force in nty power. The  
details had been communicated to Kir. Canning in  
conference too recently to be forgotten. Still it  
was just that no improper inference should he drawn  
front the omission of them. To preveut it, I  
obtained an interview of Mr. Canning immediately  
after my note was presented, in which, after remind­  
ing him of the omission alluded to, the motive to  
which 1 presumed he could not mistake, added that  
my object in asking the interview had been to re­  
peat to him informally, what 1 had stated in the  
loruter one, the other acts of which my government  
expected that the reparation should consist. In  
this interview nothing occuired without the limit of  
the special object for which it had been obtaiued.  
Mr. Canning did not lead the conversation to any  
other topick, and I could not invite it.  
Mr. Canning’s answer to my note wus declared,  
more than a fortnight. Having refused to treat the  
subject w connection, and intimated in plain terms  
that it 1 was not authorized to separate them, it  
would be useless to prolong the discussion, I thought  
t improper to press it. My reply was equally ex­  
plicit, to that with it the negoriation ended. The  
ue.isure which he announced, as being determined  
•n by the king, in rase 1 could not agree to the se­  
Iparation, it completely the act of bit government.  
  
You will observe that it it announced jn a form  
which preclude in a gieut degree, idea cl its  
being adopted at mv suggestion, r.s an ; of h,m­  
ratioii, and in a tone ol decision v io-h seamed  
equally to preclude my holding any c. . ..unicuiism  
with him on it.  
My mission being thus brought to ,.n vod, lias  
afforded me an opportunity for me to mum to the  
United States, as 1 have long drsiied. Nothing  
but the great interest which I take in the welfare  
ot my country, and my earnest desire to gne all the  
aid in my power to the present administration, in  
support ol the principles ol our must excellent  
constitution, would have detained me lure so long.  
In the present state, however, it is not possible, if  
in any it would he, lor me to render any service by  
a longer continuance here. As soon, therefore, as  
1 had answered M r. Canning’s note, 1 communicat­  
ed to him my intention to return, and requested  
that he would he so good as to obtain lor me an au­  
dunce of the king lor the purpose of taking my  
leave of him. This was granted on the 7th of this  
month, in which I renewed the assurance of the sin*  
cere desire ol my government, to preserve the most  
friendly relation between the United States and G.  
Britain, which sentiment was reciprocated bv his  
majesty. Mr. Pinkney succeeds me by an arrange­  
ment with Mr. Canning, which will appear in the  
inclosed copy ot my correspondence with him, and  
which I have lull confidence the president will ap­  
prove. I regret that in transferring the business  
into his hands, I do nut leave him altogether free  
from difficulty.  
1 have the honor to be,  
With great respect,  
Sir,  
lour most obedient servant,  
  
J .L\ M .MU.A KUh.  
James Madison, Esq. Secretary of State.  
P. S. Not being satisfied with the undefined cha­  
racter ut the proposed mission to the United States,  
and Mr. Canning having eommanirated nothing  
new to me on the subjeet, in my inlet view with  
him on the day I was presented to the king, altho’  
an opportunity was offered lor the purpose, I vviote  
him a note alter the commencement of this letter,  
to make certain enquiries on that head, a copy of  
which note, and of his answer, is herewith enclos*  
ed. \ ou will observe that he still holds himself  
aloof on it. 1 thought it my duly, and that it  
comported with strict delicacy, to make the enqui­  
ry, and I cannot hut consider Ins reserve as aiiord­  
ing cause lor an unlavourahle inference. It is pro­  
bable however, as the door is left open for further  
communication between us till the moment of my  
departure, that he will take some other occasion to  
explain himself more luily on the subject. You  
may he assured that I will srpk every favourable op­  
portunity to obtain such explanation of him

l&#x27;*s»os, October 10, 1807.  
i MK,  
I have flip ’honor to transmit you bv doc­  
tor Bullus, a copy oi any correspondence with Mr.  
Canning pn the subject which was romniittcd  
to nyv c,.rc, by your tetter of the 6J. of Julv last  
i ou wdl hurt by it ibat the pressure v bich has  
been made on this government, in obedience to  
the instruction-contained in that 1- tier, has termi­  
nated in a dec ision to send a minister to the U­  
mted Spates, to adjust the business there. Wh-1  
the powers of that minister will be ^ whether it  
is intended to confine them to the sole object of  
reparation for the special outrage, or”to extend  
them, in case the proposed separation of that  
I ruin the general topic of impressment, is admit­  
ted, to the latter objectf it is not in my power to  
itate. Mr. Canning has given me no information  
on that head in conference, and his note is not ex­  
plicit on it. It states that die minister who shall  
(lie sent to the United Stales, to bring the dispute  
relative to the attack ou the Chesapeake to a con­  
clusion,shall not he empowered to entertain,as con­  
nected with that subject, any proposition respect­  
ing the search of mei chant Vessels—a presumption  
is authorised by those terms, thattlic minister will  
have power to treat on the general topic after th&lt;­  
special one is arranged. But it is possible that  
that presumption may have been raisi d for some  
other purpose, or that the terms which excited it,  
were introduced merely to convey the idea that  
the mission should he confined to the special ob­  
ject *  
lit the discharge of this delicate and important  
irust, I thought that 1 should be able more effec­  
tually to promote its object, by opening the sub­  
&lt;*ctto Mr. Canning in conference, tin ii by an of­  
ficial note.. As the attitude taken by niv govern­  
ment, which was evidently supported &quot;by the  
whole nation, was of a very impressive nature  
it seemed probable from the feverish state of the  
public mind here in regard to us, that a tone of  
conciliation, which should net weaken the pres­  
sure, would be more likely to succeed in obtain­  
ing the reparation desired, than an official ai d  
peremptory demand. Under this impression, I  
had several conferences with Mr. Canning, the­  
subst nee of winch, in c ell, 1 will endeavor  
to state with precision. A knowledge of what  
passed in these interviews, in aid oftfi.it which  
s aflorded by the correspondence, will enable  
von to form the most corn et idea of the object  
&gt;f the proposed mission, that present circumstan­  
ces will admit of  
  
I he first interview was on the 3d of Sepf. ru­  
ber, as soon ns it could lie obtained, after the re­  
ceipt of your letter of Juh the Olli, width was  
on the 30th of August. I in iu-nicd Mr. Can­

mode which we could pursue. He , xpiesscd his

was desired that the reparation should he made,

iloped bv other powers, and by Great Britain hcr­  
fcclf, for injuries less severe than tlie one alluded  
to, of which 1 gave him the examples, furnished

a note of what 1 hud stated, and made some ge­  
neral remarks on the whole subject, winch were  
intended to give his view of it, on each point, but  
Without compromitting himself in a positive man­

complained of the difference, which he said, had  
been made between France and England, by res*

1 urged in reply, that the proclamation could not

for injuries, though the aggression had provoked  
and would have justified any tlie strongest act of

restored to it : that with respect to the other  
point in difference, said to be made in the case  
of deserters from British ami French ships, l was  
liil cquailitccL with the fact, but was satisfied,  
the statement was correct, that the difference w as  
imputable to the local authorities, and not to the  
national government, because as the U. States  
were not bound by treaty to restore deserters  
from tlie service of either nation, it was not pre­  
sumable that their government would interfere h  
the business. 1 observed, however, that if such  
a pre fere no* had been given, there was a natural  
and justifiable cause for it, proceeding from the  
conduct of the squadrons of France and England,  
or. the coast of the United States, and tn tlie main  
ocean, it be:ng a weil kruv.vh f?r* that the former  
did not maintain as a right or adopt in practice  
the doctrine of the latter, to impress seamen from

it ! urged with great earnestness tlie justice and  
j; icy of his terminating at this time all the dif­  
fetdices which had arisen between our govern­  
ments from this cause, by an arrangement which  
• should suppress tlie practice on the part of Great I  
Britain, and remedy the evil of which she coin j  
&#x27;Sained. ■ ,  
  
. In aid of those reasons which were applicable  
in the merits of the question, I urged the exam­  
ple given by the late ministry, in the paper of  
Nov. 8t!i, presented to Mr. Pinkney and myself  
by the British commissioners, which had, as 1  
thought, laid the foundation of such an arrange­  
ment. I stated that as it was stipulated by that!  
paper, that the negociation should be kept open  
lor the purpose of arranging tliis gT&#x27;ftat interest  
without prejudice to the rights of cither power,  
it was fairly to be understood as the sense of both  
parties, that our rights were to be respected, till  
that arrangement was concluded ; whence it  
would follow that the same effect would be pro­  
duced-in practice, as if it had been provided for  
by treaty. I relied on this paper and the construc­  
tion which I thought it admitted, with which,  
however, t lie practice had since in&#x27;no degree cor-j  
responded, to shew the extent to which the for­  
mer ministry had gone in meeting the just views,  
of our government, and thereby to prove that  
the present, ministry in improving that ground,,  
had nothing to apprehend f. otn the preceding one.  
Mr. Canning admitted that the view which 1 had  
taken of this paper derived much support front,  
its contents and the time and &#x27;circumstances un­  
der which it was presented, but persisted in his  
desire to keep the subject separate. 1 proposed­  
*s an expedient to g&lt; t rid of his objection, that  
«r should take up and at range both points infer­  
nv 1K-, in which ease, pro\idc-d it was done in a  
m.iriner to be obligatory, I offered to frame uiy  
n &gt;tc which should demand reparation for the out-,  
r e, in general terms, so as that it should not  
appear by official document, that the subjects had;  
■any connection in the negociation. 1 urged that  
Unless it was intendedto make no provision a­  
y hist impressment from merchant vessels, I  
c u!d see no objection to his meeting me on that  
ground, as after what had passed, it was impos­  
sible to t ke up either subject without having the  
othei in view, andeqiAilly so to devise any mode  
which should keep them more completely sepa­  
rate. than that which I proposed. Mr. Canning  
slid adhered to his doctrine of having nothiug to  
do with impressment from merchant vessels, till  
tiie affair of the Chesapeake was aisposedof, af­  
ter which he professed his w illingncss to proceed  
to the oilier object In this manner the confer­  
ence ended, without having produced the ar­  
rangement which I had hoped from it. Mr. Can­  
ning&#x27;s conduct was in all other respect* concilia­  
tory.  
  
My note to Mr. Canning was founded on the  
res.lit of this conference. As it had not bed) ill  
my power to come to any agreement with him on  
tin- general .subject of impressment from mer- j  
chant Vessels, I considered it my duty to combine J  
it with the affair of the Chesapeake, in the paper  
which I presented him to claim reparation for the  
outrage. 1 thought it heat,however, to omit the  
other acts, of which it wan desired that the re­  
paration should consist. It seemed probable that j  
a specification of each circumstance, in the note, j  
would increase the indisposition of the ministry ]  
to accommodate,-and give it support with the na­  
tion, in a complete rejection of the demand. I  
expressed myself therofnre in regard to the oilier  
arts, in general and conciliatory terms, but with  
all the force in my power. The details had been  
Communicated to Mr. Canning in conference too  
recent to be forgpttcn. Still it w s just that no  
improper inference should lie drawn from the o«  
mission of them. To prevent it, 1 obtained an  
interview of Mr. Canning immediately after my  
note was presented, in which, after reminding  
Inn of the omission allmded to, the motive to  
which I presumed Jie could not mistaky, 1 added  
that my object in asking the interview had been  
to repeat to him infbrmally, w tyat I had stated in  
ti e form* r one, the other acts of which my g*&gt;­  
v i nnici&#x27;t expected that the reparation should  
C&#x27; :u,i*1. In this interview nothing occurred with­  
. tl&gt;&lt; limit oftlfc sneri 1 object for which it had  
I *r , btained. Mr. Canning did not lead the  
* I&#x27;Wsation to any other topic and I could not  
ii rfe it  
* . (&#x27;. inning’s answer t*&gt; my note was declared  
&#x27; i c •’ ,ir, a f jrtnight. Having re fused to treat  
&#x27; r.tl &#x27;cttin connection, and intimated in plain  
ms. that if I was not autbotiscd to separate  
i-&#x27; in, it Wool*! be useless U» prolong Uit discus­  
  
hion, 1 thought it improper to pres* it. My reply  
was equally explicit, so that with it the negocia­  
t»on The measure which he announce*!,&#x27;  
as being determined on by the king, in case I  
could not agree to tlie separation, is completely  
the act of his government. You will observe  
that, it is announced in a form which precludes  
in a great degree, the idea of its being adopted.  
at my suggestion, us an act of reparation, and in  
a tone of decision which srenu-ii equally to pre­  
clude my holding any communication with him on  
it.  
M y mission being thus brought to an end, has  
•Horded an opportunity for me to return to the  
United States as 1 have long desired. Nothin;­  
but the great iivterest which I take in the welfare  
of my country, and my earnest desire to give all  
the aid in n»y power to the present administrati­  
on, in support of the principles of our most ex­  
cellent constitution, would have detained me  
here so long. In the prei nt state, howcvcr.it  
is not poaaible, if in any it weald be, for me to  
render any service by a longer continuance here.  
As soon, therefore, as I had answered Mr. Can­  
ning’s note, 1 communicated to him my intenti-&#x27;  
on to return, and requested that lie would be so  
good as to obtain for me aft audience of the King  
for the purpose of taking mv leave of him. Tins  
was granted on the 7th of this month, in which  
I renewed the assurance Of the sincere desire of  
mv government, to preserve the most f.iendly  
relation between the United States and Great  
Britain, which sentiment&#x27; tvns reciprocated by  
his majesty. Mr. Pinkney succeeds me by an  
; arrangement with Mr. Canning; which will ap­  
j pear in tlic enclosed copy of mv correspondence  
j with him, and which I have full confidence the­  
President will approve. I regret that in trans­  
ferring the business, into his hands, l do Twit leave  
him altogether free from difficulty.  
| I have the honor to he, with grout respect, sir,  
your most bbedieht servant,  
JAS. MONROE.  
James Madtsov, Esq.  
Secretary of State.  
P. S. Not being satisfied with the undefined  
character of the proposed mission to the United  
States and Mr. Canning having communicated­  
nothing new to me on the subject, in my inter­  
view with him on the day 1 was presented to the  
King, alihoug an opportunity was offered for the  
purpose, I wrote him a note after the commence-&#x27;  
Tn«nt ofthis letter, to make certain enquiries on  
that head, a copy of which note, and of his an­  
swer, is herewith enclosed. You will observe  
that he still holds himself aloof on it. 1 thought  
it my duty, and that it comported with strict de-i  
lrcacy, tf&gt; make the enquiry, 2nd l cannot but  
consider his reserve as affording cause for an un­  
favorable inference. It is probable, however,  
as the door is left open for further communicati­  
on between us till the moment of my departure,  
that he will take some other occasion to explain  
himself more fully on the subject. You may be  
assured that I will seek every favorable opportu­  
nity to obtain such explanation of him.

s - LcndoHgf October 10, ISO?. r  
Sir I hare the horW.to transmit you by  
Doctor Bullus, a copy of mjr corresiealcnce  
with Ate. Caning iw the iaTycct which was  
committed to my care, by your letter of the,  
6th of July last You w&amp;l find by it, . that  
the pressure which has been made on this go­  
vernment, in obedience to the instnsction  
contained; io that letter, has terminated In a  
decUlon to tend a minister to the United  
States, to adjust the business there, What  
the powers of that minister wiU be t whether  
it U tntiniAi tn mnfinc thrm to the sole ob  
  
ject reparation fur the ilcialortrage, or  
  
to extend tnem in case . tne proposca sepa-  
J liii rm K iiipbI - lAUIC nf tm. .  
  
&quot;I - nlr..S.l Initio riirt. It  
  
Ji nor hi my power to state. Mr Canning  
  
hat given me no infhrmatron on that head in  
conference, and his note it nqt explicit on it.  
It states that the minister who shall be sent  
to the United Sutesj tobring tho dispute re­  
lative to the attack en thjf ; Chesapeake to- a  
conclusion, slull not be empowered to enter  
tain, ts connected with : that subject, any  
proposition respecting the search . of mer­  
chant vessels presumption is authorized  
by those terms, ihat the minister will have  
power to treat on the general topic&#x27; after the  
special one is arranged. &#x27; But it it possible  
that that presumption may have been raised  
for some other purpose, or that the terms  
which excited it, were Introduced merely to  
Convey the idea that the mission should be  
confined to the special object, a i ;  
- In the discharee of this delicate and im-  
  
portant trust, I thought that I should be able  
  
more effectually to promote its object, by o­  
pening the subject to Mr. Canning in confer  
ence, than by an official note. At the atti­  
tude taken, by my government, whkh was e  
vWcnUy stipported by the whole nation, waa  
of a very impressive nature, it seemed pro­  
bable from the feverish state of the public  
mind here in regard to us, that a tone of con­  
ciliation, which should not weaken the pres­  
sure, would be more likely to succeed in. ob­  
taining the reparation desired, than an offi­  
cial and peremptory demand.. Under. thit  
impression, I had several conferences With  
Mr, Canning, lhc substance of which, in  
each, J wiUendearor to state with precision .  
A know led ftt of what passed in these inter  
  
views, in aid of that which is afforded by  
  
the conference, wiu enable you to form the  
most correct idea of the, object of the propo­  
sed mission, that present f ciixumsUrKes will  
admit of. &quot;;. &#x27; v:.v&#x27;;V  
NThe first Interview wat on the 3d of Sep­  
tember, at soon as it could be obtained, af­  
ter the- receipt of your letter of July the 6th,  
whkh wasoj the 30thof Angustr I4nform-.  
ed Mr. Canning,. that at I whhed the dis  
ctmioo m which -we were about : to enter, to  
terminate amicably; and honorably to both  
our governments, I had asked the interview,  
for -the purpose of promoting that desirable  
end f that by &#x27;explaining to each other fully,  
hr fnendiy conferencef the iews f our ret­  
pectijt governments, relative to the late ag­  
greidn, I vu persuaded that itswould be  
more eay for us to arrange the buimess, to  
the satisfaction of both parties, than byvany  
other mode whkh we could procure lie  
expressed his sensibility to that whkh I had  
chosen, and his readiness to concur fa it ; I  
then stated in detail, in explicit terms, the  
reparation whkh my government thought the  
United Sutes entitled to, and expected that  
they should receire, for the injury and indig­  
nity offered by the late aggression ; that the  
men taken from the frigate should be resto­  
red to it ; that the ofikcra who had commit­  
ted the tggresskfi should be excmplarily pun­  
salted ; that the practice cf impressment  
from merchant veueli should be suppressed ;  
and Out the reparation consisting of those  
sevrral acts ihotiM be announced to our go­  
vernment, through the medium of a . special  
mission, a tolemuity whkh the extraordina  
ry namree tiie argressionparticuJarly  
quired. I observed that as the aggression  
and the principle on whkh it waa founded  
had been frankly disavowed as toon as known,  
by his government, I was persuaded that  
there could be no serious objection on its part,  
to any of the acts which it was desired should  
constitute; the propoied reparation that to  
the first act, the restorauoo of . the men,  
there, cW doubtless be none, as the feast  
that could be done, idler such an. 4 outrage,  
would be to replace the Uuited Sutes u tar  
ash might be practicable, on the ground  
they held before the Injury wat received t  
that the punishment of the officers followed,  
as a necessary consequence, to the disavowal  
of the act I. that the oppression of the prac  
ticeof impressment from merchant vessels  
had been made indispensable by the late ag­  
gxoucti,JotreascMwhJdiweje.aul5well known to him. I stated to him that the  
mode in whkh it waa desired that the repa­  
ration should be made, by a special mission  
was that whkh had been adopted by other  
powers, and by Great Britain hcrwelf, for in  
juries less&#x27; severe than the one alluded to, of  
which I gave him the examples furnished me  
in your letter of July 6th. Mr. Canning  
took a note of what I bad atatcd, and made  
tome general remarks on the whole subject,  
which were intended to give his view of it.  
  
otv.eaclurinlnt, hit.withp5tjeooprpntiuingt-  
  
nimseit in a po&amp;iQve manner on 1 any one.  
He said &#x27;that, by the proclamation of the  
President and the scicure and detensioa of  
tome men who bad landed on the coast to  
procure , water, the government seemed to  
  
have taken redress into ita own haads t he  
  
complained of the difference which he said  
had been made between France and England,  
by testoring deserters to the vessels of the  
former, and not to the latter : be Insisted  
that the late aggression was an act different  
to all respects from the former practice, and  
ought not to be connected with it, as it shew­  
ed t disposition to make a partkular incident.  
  
In which thejf wcrti mtht rong mitrumen  
  
tal to an accommouaUon In&#x27;a case where nis  
government held a cufFerentdoctrine, I ur­  
ged in reply, that the proclamation could not  
be considered aa an act of hostility or retaliati­  
on for injuries, though the argression had pro­  
voked and would have jutncd any strong­  
est act of . reprisal, but as a mere measure of  
police, which had become indispensable for  
the preservation of order within the limitt of  
the United States j I informed him that the  
men who had landod from the squadron, in  
defiance of thei proclamatlonrand of the law  
&#x27;.on which it was founded, had been .restored

and justifiable cause for if, proceeding froni

In aid of. those reasons whkh were appll &quot; &quot;

Pmckney and myself, by ute Brush cornmis-

ted that as It was stipulated by that pajier, &#x27;  
that the negooation should bs kept open for-the  
purpose of arranging this great interest,  
without prejudice to the rights of either pow­

ent to get rid of his objection, that we should  
tak.e up and arrange both points .informally,  
fa which case, provided it was done in a  
manner to be obligatory, I offered to frame  
my note which should demand reparation for-the  
outrage, in general terms, so as that it  
should not appear by official document,&#x27; that  
the subjects had any connection Ihlhe negcw

to make no provision, against impressment  
from merchant vessels, I could see no ob  
  
  
jectkxrto his meeting mie von&#x27; that ground,  
as after what bad passed, it was impassible  
to take up either subject without having the  
other fa view&quot;, and equally so to devise any  
inode which should keep them more com ,  
pletely separate, than that which I proposed.  
Mr. Canning still adhered to his doctrine of  
baying aothing to do with impressment froov  
merchant vessels, till the affair of the Che  
tapeake was disposed of, after which he pro-  
fcased his willfagness to proceed to the other ,  
object. Irr this manner the cordereoce end-

My note to Mr. Canning was founded on  
the result of this conference. As it had not;  
been fa my power to coma to any agreement  
with him on the general subject ot impress&#x27;  
ment from, merdvajrit.ve&amp;sels, I considered it  
  
my duty to combine it with the affair of the  
Chesapeake, in. the paper which I presented.&#x27;  
him to claim the rrparatloo for the outrage&#x27; x

acts, of which it was desired mat the repa­  
ration should, consist. It seemed probable  
that a specification of each circumstance, in  
  
&quot;the fiotc, would increase the indispositi of  
  
the. ministry to accommodate, and give it  
support with the nation, In a complete rejec­  
tion of s the demand. I expressed myself  
therefore in regard to the other axis, in ge- ,  
neral and conciliatory terms, but with all the ,  
force in my power. The details had been .  
communicated tp Mir. Canning in conference,  
todreccnUyto be forgotten ;r SUll it was just­  
that no improper inference should be drawn  
from the omission of thera. &#x27; To prevent it,  
I obtained an interview of Mr. Canning im­  
mediately after my4 note wat presented, &#x27;in  
which, after reminding hint of the omission ,  
alluded to, the motive to whoht 1 presumed .  
could not mistake, added that my object in  
asking the interview had been to repeat to:  
hirq informally, what I bad stated In the for­

SIR I have the houor to trans­  
mit to you by Dr. Bullus a copy of  
my correpondence wrth Mr; &#x27;Can­  
ning n the subject which wasxom­  
miitcd o my care&#x27;by your letter of  
the 6th iof July last; You will find  
by it, that the pressure which has  
been made on this1 government , In  
obedience to the instructions contain­  
ed in that letter, has -erminated in a  
decision to.isend a ..Minister tq the  
United State? (o adjust the business  
there. rWht the powers of thai  
Minister will be ; whether it is(in­  
tendedPto confine them to trn fole  
object of, reparation fr the special  
outrage, or to extend them, m case  
the proposed separation of that from  
the general topic of impressment is  
admitted, to the latter object, it is not  
in my power to btate. Mr, Canning­  
has given nie no information on that  
head in conference, and his Qote is  
not explicit on it. It states that the  
Minister who shall bte sunt to the U.  
States to bring the dispute relative  
to the attack on thtfChe.sapeake to a  
conclusion, shall not be rnp nvered  
to entertain as connected With that  
subject, any proposition respecting  
the search of merchant vessels. A  
presumption is authorized by those  
terms that the Minister will have  
power to proceed to treat on the ge­  
neral topic, after the special one is  
arranged. Jgfut it is possible that that  
presumption may j have been raised  
for ome other purpose, or that the  
tei ms which excite it were introduced  
merely to convey the idea that the  
mission should be confined to the spe­  
cial objects &#x27;  
, In the discharge of this delicate 8c  
important trust, I thought I ahould  
be able more effectually to promote  
its object, by openinglhe subject to  
Mr. Canning in; conference than, by  
an official note. 1 As the attitude ta­  
ken by my government, which was  
evidently supported by the whole,  
nation, was of j a very Jmprts  
sive nature ; it seemed probable,  
from the feverish j state of the pub­  
lic mind here. in regard to us, that a  
tone of conciliation which should not  
weaken the pressure, would be more  
likely to succeed in obtaining the re­  
paration desired, than an official and  
peremptory demand. Under this  
impression I had several conferences  
with, Mr. Canning, the substance of  
Which, in each, Ijwill endeavour to  
state with precision. . A knowledge  
of what passed in,these interviews,  
in aid of that which is afforded by the  
correspondence, will enable you tc  
form tile most correct idea of the ob­  
ject of the proposed mishion, that  
prestnt circumstances will admit of.  
The first interview was on the 3d  
of September, as soon as it could be  
obtained after the receipt of your let­  
ter of July the 6th j which was on the  
30th of August, j I informed Mr,  
Canning that as I wished the discus-

London, Oct. 10, 1 307.  
Sir,  
I have the honour to transmit you,  
i,v doctor Bulius, a copy oi m\ corres­  
pond hce with i r. Canning, on the  
sir jett which was committed to my  
care, l»v vour i *ttci of the (&gt;th of July  
Ir-st. You will find by it, that the prev­  
sure which h; s hen n mint, on this vo­  
vernment, in obedience lo the instruc­  
tion&#x27; contain■ d in that 1 ttcr, has V rmi­  
d in a d. ci*i n to send a ministt r to  
the lw.it d Star- s, tc adju* ■ th business  
there. V\ hat the pow , ol t.v ininis­

of tint b om the gt u ral topirk of im­  
press mentis ad mitt &lt;:d, to tht latte rob jeet,  
it is not in my power to state. .Mr.  
Canning has given me no information  
&lt;,n that brad in conference, and his note  
not explicit on it. It states, that Uic  
  
j minister ulio shall be sent to the United  
I States, to briiag the dispute relative to  
the attack on the Chesapeake to a con­  
clusion,shall not be empowered to enter­  
tain, as connected with that subject, any  
proposition respecting the search oh  
merchant vessels—a presumption is au­  
thorized by those terms, that the mini­  
ster v ill have power to treat on the ge­  
neral topick alter the special one is ar­  
ranged. But it i&#x27; .possible that that pre­  
sumption may have been raised lor  
some other p&gt; rpose, or that the terms  
which excited it, were introduced  
merely to convey the idea that the  
mission should be confined to the speci­  
al object.  
In the discharge of this delicate and  
important trust, I though tthatl should  
be able, more cfloetuallv, to promote, its  
object, by opening the subject to JNIr.  
Canning in conference, that by _-u offi­  
ce 1 note. As the attitude taken Ip  
iny government, which was evidently  
supported by the whole nation, was of a  
very impressive nature, it seemed pro­  
bable from the feverish state oi the pub­  
  
iu.&lt;v mum mil, m ? garu :o,us, mat a  
tone of conciliation v. hi eh would not  
weaken the presto w, would he more like­  
1&gt; to succeed in Obtaining the reparati m  
desired, th tn a\toilitial Sc peremptory de­  
tnmd. Linder this impression, j had  
several conferences with Mr. Canning,  
the substance of which, in each, I will  
endeavour to state with precision. A  
knowledge . of what passed in these in­  
terviews, hi aid of that which is afford­  
ed bv the correspondence, will enable  
you to form the most correct idea of  
the object of the proposed mission,  
1 that prt sente.ircumstances will admit of.  
l&#x27;he first inter, iew, was on the 3d of  
September, as soon as it co ild be obtain­  
ie l, after the receipt of your letter of  
Juiv the Gth, which was on the 30th of  
August. 1 informed Mr. Canning,  
that as 1 wished the discussion in which  
we were about to enter, to terminate a­  
micably and honourably to both our  
governments, I had asked the inter­  
view for the purpose of promoting that  
dcsi. abj ■ end ; that by explaining to  
each other fully, in friendly conference,  
the views of our respective governments  
relative to the late aggression, 1 was  
persuaded that it would be more easy  
for us to arrange the business, to the sa­  
tisfaction &lt;/! both parties, than Ivy am o­  
ther mode which we c ould pursue. He  
expressed his sensibility to that which  
I had chosen, and his readiness to con­  
  
| cur in it; I then stated in detail, in ex­  
| plicit terms, the reparation which my v  
government thought the United States  
entitled to, and expected that they  
should receive^ for the injury and in­  
dignity offered by the late aggression ;  
that t ie men taken from the frigate  
should he restored to it;- that the officers  
who committed the aggression should  
be exemplarily . punished ; ^that the  
practice of impressment from merchant  
vessels should be suppressed ; and that  
the reparation consisting ol those Seve­  
rn’ acts should be announced to our go­  
vernment, though the medium of a  
special mission, a solemnity which the  
extraordinary nature of the aggression  
particularly required. I observe that

the vessels of the former, and* not the  
lattci . He insisted that the late aggres­  
sion was an act different in all respects  
fi o n the former practice, and ought not  
to he connected with it, as it showed a  
disposition to make a particular inci­  
dent, in w hich they were in the wrong,  
instrumental to an accommodation in  
a case were his government held a dif­  
ferent doctrine. I urged in reply, that  
the proclamation could not be consider­  
ed as an act of hostility or retaliation  
01 lnjui&#x27;ies, though the aggression had  
provoked and would have justified any  
the strongest act of reprisal, but as a  
mere measure of police, what had be­  
come in dispensable for the preserva­  
tioii of order within the limits of the  
United States ; I informed him that the  
men who had landed from the squadron  
in defiance of the proclamation, and  
of the law on which it was founded,  
hau been restored to it: that with re­  
spect to the oilier point in difference,  
said to be made in the case of deserters  
fi&#x27;jin Uritish and Trench ships, I was  
luai qua in ted with the fact, hut was sa­  
tisfied, il the statement was correct, that  
the difference was imputable to the lo­  
■&#x27;al authorities, and not to the national  
  
Uy Jveinment, bcxuuse as the TJuited  
Suites were not bound by treaty to rv­  
sLore deserters from tbe service of ei­  
tiiri nation, it was aot presumable that  
tiu ir government would interfere in the  
ousint ss. I observed, however, that if  
such a preference had been given, there  
was a natural and justifiable cause for  
it, proceeding from the conduct of the  
squadrons ol France and England, on  
the coast of the United States, and on  
the main ocean, it being a well known  
fact that the former did no maintain as  
aright or adopt in practice the doctrine  
ol the latter, to impress seamen from  
our merchant vessels. I then discussed  
at length, and urged with great earnest­  
ness,the justice and policy of his termi­  
nating at this time all the differences  
which had arisen between our govern­  
ments from this cause, by an arrange­  
ment which should suppress the prac­  
tice on the part of Great Britain, and  
remedy the evil ot which she complained.  
In aid of those reasons which were  
applicable to the merits of the question,  
l urged the example given by the late  
ministry, in the paper of November 8th,  
presented to JVIr. Pinckney and myself  
by the British commissioners,which had,  
as I thought, laid the foundation of such  
an air mgement. I stated that as it was  
•stipulated by that paper, that the negoci­  
  
ation should be kr;pt open for the purpose  
ot arranging this great interest without  
prejudice to the &#x27;rights of either power,it  
was fairly to be understood as the sense  
or both parties., that our rights were to  
e respected, till that arrangement was  
concluded ; v/hence it would follow that  
the same effect would be produced in  
practice, as if it had been provided for  
b) treaty. I relied on this paper and  
the construction, which I thought it ad­  
mitted, wivh which, however, the prac­  
tice had since in no degree correspond­  
ed, to shew the; extent to which the for­  
mer ministry had gone in meeting the  
just views of our government, and  
theieby to prove that the present mini­  
stry in improving that ground had no­  
uung to apiprehend from the preceding  
one. Mr . Canning admitted that the  
view whi ch I had taken of this paper  
derived rnuch support from its contents,  
and the time and circumstances under  
which it was presented, but persisted  
in his desire to keep the subjects sepa­  
iate. I proposed, as an expedient to  
get rid of his objection, that we should  
talce up and arrange both points inform­  
ady, in which case, provided it was  
  
i-iwiic. in h manner to be obligatory, I oi­  
feretl to frame my note which should  
demand reparation for the outrage, in  
general terms, so as that it should not  
appear by official documents, that the  
subjects had any connection in the ne­  
gotiation. I urged that unless it was  
intended to make no provisions against  
impressment from merchant vessels, I  
could see no objection to bis meeting me  
on that ground, as after what had pass­  
ed, it was impossible to take up either  
subject without having the other in  
view, and equally so to devise any  
mode which should keep them more  
completely separate, than that which I  
proposed. Mr. Canning still adhered  
to his doctrine of having nothing to do  
with impressment from merchant ves­  
sels, till the affair of the Chesapeake  
was disposed of, after which he profes­  
sed his willingness to proceed to the o­  
ther object. In this manner the confer­  
ence ended, without having produced  
l the arrangement which I had hoped  
j from it. Mr. Canning’s conduct was  
I in all other respects conciliatory.  
My note to Mr. Canning was found­  
ed on the result of this conference. As it  
had not been in my pow er to come to any  
agreement with him on the general sub­  
i ject of impressment from merchant ves­  
sels, I considered it my duty to coni­  
  
bine it with the affair of the Chesa­  
peake, in the paper which I presented  
him to claim reparation for the outrage,  
l thought it best, however, to omit the  
other acts, of which it was desired that  
the reparation should consist. It seem­  
ed probable that a specification of each  
circumstance, in the note, would in­  
crease th&lt;j indisposition of the ministry  
to accommodate, and give it support  
with the nation, in a complete rejection  
ot the demand. I expressed myself  
therefore in regard to the other acts, in  
general and conciliatory terms, but with  
all the force in mv pow&#x27;er. The details  
had been communicated to Mr. Can­  
ning in conference too recently to be for­  
gotten. Still it was just that no impro­  
per inference should be drawn from the  
omission of them. To prevent it, I ob­  
tained an interview of Mr. Canning  
immediately after my note was present­  
ed, in which, after reminding him of the  
omission alluded to,the motive to which  
I presumed he could not mistake, I ad­  
ded that my object in asking the inter­  
view had been to repeat to him infor­  
mally, what I had stated in the former  
one, the other acts of which my govern­  
ment expected that the reparation should  
consist. In this interview nothing oc­  
curred without the limit of the special  
object for which it had been obtained,  
j Canning did not lead the conversa­  
! .tio» to any other topic, and I could not  
invite it.  
  
;Yir. canning s answer to my note was  
delayed more than a fortnight. Hav­  
ing refused to treat the subject in con­  
nection, and intimated in plain terms  
that ii I v as not authorised to separate  
them, it would be useless to prolong the  
discussion, I thought it improper to  
press it. My reply was equally expli­  
cit, so that with it the negotiation end­  
ed. The measure which he announced,  
as being determined on by the king, in  
case I could not agree to the separation,  
is-completely the act of his government.,  
You will observe that it is announced in  
a form which precludes in a great de­  
gree, the idea of its being adopted at  
my suggestion, as an act of reparation,  
and in a tone of decision w hich seemed  
equally to preclude my holding any  
communication with him on it.  
My mission being thus brought to an  
eno, has afforded an opportunity for me  
to return to the United States, as I have  
long desired. Nothing but the great  
interest which I take in the welfare of  
niy country, and my earnest desire to

_Sir+=l have the honor to tran{mit  
you by do&amp;or Bullus, a copy of my  
correspondence with Mr. Cannmeg on  
the fubje@ which was committeg to  
my care, by your letter of the Gthof  
July las. You will ind by it that  
the preflure which has been made on  
this gévernment, in obedience to the  
janltru&amp;ion contained in that letter,  
‘has terminated in a decision to fend a  
miniflter to the United States, to ad­  
jult the business there. What the  
powers of that minilter will be ; wheth.  
er it is intended to confine them to -  
the sole obje&amp; of reparation for the  
special outrage, or to extecd them, in  
case the proposed separation of that  
from the general togic of imprefl  
ment 1s admitted, te the fatter objed,  
it is not in my power to state. Mr.  
Canning has given me go information  
on that head in conference, and his  
note is_mot explicit on it. It [tates  
that the minister” who shall be sent to  
thg Unicted States, to bring the dif­  
yute relative to the attack on the Che­  
sapeake to a conclusion, shall not be  
c¢mpowered to entertain, as conne&amp;ted  
with that fubje&amp;, any proposition re­  
ipeding the search of merchant ves­  
sels—a presumption is authorized by  
those terms, that the minister will  
have power to treat on the general .  
topic after the {pecial one is arranged.  
But it is poflible that that presump­  
tion may have been raised for some  
other purpose, or that the terms which -  
excited it, Were introduced merely to  
~ convey the idea that the mission should  
‘be confined to the special object. %  
In the discharge of this delicate  
and important trust, I thought that I  
should be able more effedtually to  
promote its objed, by opening the  
{ubje&amp; to Mr. Canaing in conference,  
than by an official note. As ?he_; atti­  
tade taken’ by my government, which  
was evidently supported by the whole&#x27;  
nation; was of a very impreflive na­  
ture, it seemed probable from the fe­  
verifh :I{at_t of the public mi‘gd- I}qre  
inregard to us, that a.tone of concilia­  
tien, which should not weaken the  
pressure, would be miore likely*to fuc­  
‘ceed in obtaining thereparation desir­  
ed, than an official and peremptory  
_demand, Under this impression, T  
“had several conferences with M}&#x27;f |

_each, [ will endeavor to Rate with

Canning, that as I wished the discus:  
fion in which we were about to enter,  
to terminate amjcably and honorably  
to both our ga¥ernments, I had atk­  
ed the interview, for the purpose of  
promating that desirable end ; that by  
cxplw‘ to each other fully, in  
friendi¥ conference, the views of our  
refpeftive governmetts, relative to  
the late apgreffion, I was persuaded  
that it would be more easy for us to  
artange the business, to the fatisfac­  
tion of both parties, than by any other  
mode which ve could pursue., He  
expreflzd his {eafibility to that which  
I had chosen, and his readiness to  
copeur in 1t 3 Ithen stated in d=tail, in  
explicit terms, the reparation which  
my government thought the United  
States entitled to, and expeéted that  
they should receive, for the injury  
and indignity offered by the late ag­  
greflion ; that the men taken from  
the frigate should be restored to it ;  
that the officers who had committed  
the aggreflion should be exemplarily  
punithed ; that the pra&amp;ice of imprefl­  
ment from merchant vessels (hould be  
fupprefled ; and that the rep:ration  
consisting of those several aéts thould  
be snnounced to our government,-  
through the medium of a special mis­  
sion, a solemnity which the extraordi.  
nary nature of the aggreflion particu­  
larly required, I observed that as  
the aggreflion and the principle on  
which it was founded had been frank­  
ly disavowed as soon as known, by his .  
government, I was persuaded that  
there could be no serious objeétion on  
its part, to any of the a&amp;s which it  
was desired should constitute the pro­  
posed reparation ; that to the firlt a&amp;,  
the restoration of the men, there could  
doubtless be none, as the least that  
could be done, after such an outrage,  
would be to replace the United States  
as far as it might be praicabley Ong  
the ground they held before tht inju. -  
ry was received ¢ that the pdnithment  
of the officers folowed. 48 a neccfliry  
consequence, to the ifavowal of the |  
act : that the fuppreflion of the pruc­  
tice. of impreflment from merchant |  
veflels had been made indifpen{able by  
the late aggression, for reasons which  
were {ufliciently well known to him.  
I tated to him that the mode in which  
it was delired “that the reparation  
{fhould be made, by a special miflion,  
was that which hdad been adoptad by  
other powers, and by Great Britain,  
herielf, for injuries less severe than the  
one alluded to, of which I gave him  
the examples furnifhed me in your let­  
terof July 6th.—Mr. Canning tooka  
note of what I had stated, and made  
some general remarks on the whole  
fubj=€t, which were intended io give  
his view of it, on each point, but with­  
out compromitting himfelt-jn a posi­  
tive manner on any one. He {4id that, -  
by the proclamatian of the President,  
-and the seizure and detention of some  
men who had landed on the coalt to |  
procure water, the government seem- i  
ed to have taken redress into itssown  
hands ; he complained of the differ- |  
ence which he said bad been made  
between France and England, by re- .  
storing deserters to the veflels of the |  
former, and not the latter : he insist- |  
ed that the late aggression was an a&amp;  
different in all re(pe@s from the for­  
mer praftice, and ought- not to be  
conne&amp;ed with it, as it thewed a dis- |  
position to make a particular incident,  
in which they were in the wrong, in- |  
firamental to am accommodation in a |  
case where his governmencheld a dis- |  
ferent, do@rine. 1 vrged in reply, :  
that (hg proclamation could not be |  
confidéred as an a&amp; of holtility or, re- |  
taliation for injuries, though the ag- |  
greflion had provoked and wouid

lice, which had become imdifpenfable  
for the preservation of -order ‘within

formed him that the men who had

ever, thatif such a preference had  
been given, there was a natural and  
jultifiable cause for it, proceeding from  
the condué of the squadrons of France  
and England, on the coast of the U.~  
‘nited States, and on the mzin acean,  
it being a well known fa&amp;t that ihe  
former did not maintain as aright or  
adopt in praice the doctrine of the  
latter, to impress seamen from our  
merchant vessels. 1 then discussed at  
length, and urged with great carneft­  
nefs the jultice and poliry ot his ter.  
minating at this time all the differen­  
ces which had arisen between our gov­  
ernments from this cause, by an ar­  
rangement whicll should suppress the  
praétice on the part of Great Britain,  
and remedy the evil of which she com­  
plained. : koo  
In aid of those reasons whith were  
applicable to the merits of tng ques­  
tion, I urged the example given by  
the late ministry, in the paper of Nov,  
Bth, -presented to Mr. Pinckney and  
myfelf, by the Britith commissioners,  
which had, as I.thought, laid the foun­  
dation of {uch an arrangement. I  
stated that as it was fiipulared by that  
paper, that the negociation fhauld be  
kept epen for the purpose of arrang­  
ing this great interest, withowt pre­  
judice to the tights of either power,  
it was fairly to be understood as the  
sense of both parties, that our righrs  
were to be refpe&amp;ed, till that arrange­  
ment was concluded 3§ whence it  
would follow that the fame effect  
would be produced in pratice, as if  
it had been provided for by treaty.  
I relied on this paper and the con­  
firu&amp;ion which I thought it admitted,  
with which, however, the pradice had  
since in no degree corresponded, to  
shew the extent to which the former  
trainiftry bad gone if meeting the juit  
views of our government, and there­  
by to prove that she present miniliry  
in improving that ground had nothing  
to apprehend from the preceding oue.  
Mr. Cannjpg admitted that the view  
which I had taken of this paper, de­  
rived much support from its contents  
and the time and circamftances un­  
der which it was presented, but per­  
fited in his delire to keep the fubjsct  
separate. 1 proposed as anexpedient”  
to get rid of his obj:&amp;ion, that we  
thould takeup and arrange both points  
informaily, in which case, provided it  
was done in.a manner to be obligato­  
ry, I offered todframe my note which  
tnould demand reparation for the out­  
rage, in general terms, {6 as that it  
should not appear by official docu­  
ment, that the fubjeéts had any con­  
neftion in the negociation. 1 urged  
that unless it was intended to make no  
provilion against impreflinent from  
merctiant vellels, I could fee no ob­  
je&amp;tion to his meeting me on that  
ground, as after what had passed, it  
was impoflinle tg take up cither fub­  
j=&amp; without Kaving the other in view, .  
and equally {o to-devise any mode  
which {hould keep them more com­  
pletely separate, than_ that which I  
proposed. Mr. Canning Qill adhered  
to his do&amp;rine of having nothing to  
do with impressment from merchant  
veflels, till the affair of the Chesa­  
peake was dilpofed of, after which he  
profeffed his willingness (o proceed to  
the other obje@. In this magner the

My note to Mr. Canning was found- _  
ed on the result of this conference.—  
As it had not been in my power to  
‘come to any agreement with him on  
the general IIII»J:&amp; of impreflment  
from merchang veflels, I considered  
it my duty to combine it with the aff.ir  
‘of the Chesapeake, in the paper which I  
prefested him to claim repiration for  
the outrage. I thought it best; how­  
ever, to omit the other a&amp;s, of which  
it was desired that the reparation  
should ¢onfift. It seemed probable  
.that .a {pecification of each circum­  
flance, in the note, would increase *he­

was prefentgd, in which, aftér remind­  
ing him of the omiflion a}luded to,  
the motive ro which 1 presumed he  
could not mistake, I added that my |  
objet in asking the interview ha ! been‘  
to repeat to him informally, what I  
had stated in the former one, the other  
adts of which my government expe&amp;.

In this interview nothifg occurred  
without the limit of the {pecial object  
for ‘which it had been obiained. Mr.  
Canning did not lead the conversation  
to any other top&#x27;e, and- I could ot  
invite it, - 3  
Mr. Canning’s answer to my note  
was delayed more than a formight.  
Having refufed to treat the fubjedi in  
connection, and intimated in plain  
terms that if [ was not authorifed to  
separate them, it woald be ifelefs to  
prolong the dif.uflion, I thought it im­  
proper to press it. My reply was e­  
quaily explicit, so that with it the ne­  
goci==ion ended. &#x27; The&#x27;meafure which  
he announced, as being determined on  
by the king in ease I could not a­  
gree to the separation, is completely  
the a&amp; of his government. You will  
observe that it 1s announced in a form  
which precludes in a great degree, the  
idea of its being adopted at my fug­  
geltion, as an al of teparation, and in  
a tone of decition which seemed equal­  
ly to preclude my holding any com­  
munication with him on it. |  
  
My mifiion being thus brought to  
an end, has afforded an opportunity  
for me to return ro the United States,  
as I bave long desired. Nothing but

desired,  
  
Mr. Munroe To Mr. Mapison, Ocr. 10,  
1807.  
  
Six,—I have the honour to transmit you,  
by Doctor Bullus, a copy of my correspon-  
dence with Mr. Canning, on the subject  
which was committed to my care, by your  
letter of the Oth of July last. You will find  
by it, that the pressure which has been made  
on this government, in obedience to the in-  
struction contained in that letter, has termi-  
nated in a decision to send a minister to the  
U.S,, to adjust the business there. What  
the powers of that minister will be; whe-  
ther it is intended to confine jthem to the  
sole object of reparation for the special out-  
rage, orto extend them, in case the propo-  
sed separation of that from the generai topic  
  
| of impressment is admitted, to the latter ob-  
  
ject, it is not in my power to state. Mr.  
Canning bas given me no information on  
that head in conferefce, and his note is not  
explicit on it. It states, that the minister  
who shall be senttothe U. S., to bring the  
dispute relative to the attack on the Chesa-  
peake to a conclusion, shal] not be empowere  
ed to entertain, as connected with that sub-  
  
| ject, any proposition respecting the search of  
  
—_—  
  
  
  
merchant vessels—a presumption is authoe  
rised by those terms, that the minister will  
have power to treat on the general topic af-  
ter the special one is arranged, But it is  
possible that that presumption may have been  
raised for some other purpose, or that the  
terms which excited it, were introduced  
merely to convey the idea that the mission  
should be confined to the special object. —In  
the discharge of this delicate and important  
trust, I thought that I should be able, more  
effectually, to promote its object, by open-  
ing the subject to Mr. Canning in conference  
than by an official note. As the attitude ta»  
ken by my government, which was evidents  
ly supported by the whole nation, was of a  
very impressive nature, it seemed ble  
from the feverish state of the public mind  
here, in regard to us, that a tone of concilia-  
tion which would not weaken the pressure,  
would be mere Ikely to succeed in obtain-  
ing the reparation cksired, than an official

and peremptory demand. Under this im-  
pression, I had several conferences with Mr.  
Canning, the substance of which, in each, I  
will endeavour to state with precision. A  
knowledge of what passed in these inter-  
views, in aid of that which is attorded by the  
correspondence, wii] enable you to form the  
most correct idea of the object of the pro-  
posed mission, that present circumstances  
will admit of —The first interview, was on  
the 3d of Sept. as soon as it could be obtain-  
ed, after the receipt of your letter of July  
6th, which was on the 30th of Aug. I in-  
formed Mr. Canning, that as I wished the  
discussion in which we were about to enter,  
to terminate amicably and honourably to  
both our governments; 1 had asked the in-  
terview, for the purpese of promoting that  
desirable end; that by explaining to each  
other iully, in friendly conterence, the views  
of our respective governments relative to the  
late aggression, I was persuaded that it would  
be more easy for us to arrange the business,  
tu the satisfaction of both parties, than by any  
other mode which we could pursue. He  
expressed his sensibility to that which I had  
chosen, and his readiness to concur in it; I  
then stated in detail, in explicit terms, the  
reparation which my government thought  
the U.S entitled to, and expected that they  
should receive, for the injury and indignity  
uftered by the late aggression ; that the men  
taken from the frigate should be restored to  
it; that the offcers-who had committed the  
aggression should be exemplarily puni: hed;  
that the practice of impressment from mer  
  
chant vessels should be suppressed ; and that  
the reparation consisting of those several acts  
should be announced to our government,  
through the medium of a special mission, a  
  
solemnity which the extraordinary nature of |  
  
the aggression particularly require’. JI ob-  
served that as the aggression and the princi-  
ple on which it was founded, had been frank-  
Jy disavowed as soon as known, by his go-  
vernment, I was persuaded that there could  
be no serious objection on its part, to any of  
the acts which «u was desired should consti-  
tate the proposed reparation : that to the first  
act, the restoration of the men, there could  
doubtless be none, as the least that could be  
done, after such an outrage, would be to re-  
piace the U.S. as far as it might be practi  
  
cable, on the ground they held before the in-  
jury was received; that the punishment of  
the officers followed, as a necessary conse-  
quence, to the disavowal of the act: that the  
suppression of the practice of impressment  
frosn merchant vessels had been made indis-  
pensable by the late aggression, far reasons  
which were sufficiently well known to bim.

I stated to him that the mode in which it  
  
was desired that the reparation should be  
made, by a special mission, was that which  
had been adopted by other powers, and by G.  
Britain herself, for injuries less severe than  
the one alluded to, of which I gave him the  
examples furnished me in your letter of July  
| Oth. Mr. Canning took a note of what |  
_ had stated, and made some general remarks  
| on the whole subject, which were intended  
| to give his view of it, on each point, but  
without compromising himself in a positive  
manner on any one. He said that, by the  
proclamation of the president, and the sei-  
zure and detention of some men who had  
Junded on the coast to procure water, the go-  
vernment seemed to have taken redress into  
its own hands; he complained of the differ-  
ence which he said bad been made between  
| France and England, by restoring deserters  
to the vessels of the former, and not the lat-  
ter: he insisted that the late aggression was  
an act different in all respects from the for-  
mer practice, and ought not to be connected  
with it, as it shewed a disposition to make a  
| particular incident, in which they were in the  
wrong, instrumental to an accommodation in  
a case where his government held a different  
doctrine. I urgedin reply, that the procla-  
mation could not be considered as an act of  
hostility or retaliation for injuries, though the  
aggression bad provoked and would have  
justitied any the strongest act of reprisal, but  
as a mere measure of police, which had be-  
coine indispensable for the preservation of  
order within the limits of the U.S.; I in-  
formed him that the men who had landed  
from the squadron, in defiance of the procla-  
mation, and of the law on which it was  
founded, had been restored to. it: that with  
respect to the uther point in difference, said  
to be made in the case of deserters from bri-  
tish and French ships, I was unacquainted  
with the fact, but was satisfied, if the state  
  
  
  
| ment was correct, that the difference was  
  
imputable to the local authorities, and nol to  
the national government, because as the U.  
S. were not bound by treaty to restore ce-  
serters from the service of either nation, !  
was not presumable that their government  
would interfere in the business. I observed,  
however, that if such a preference had been  
given, there was a natural and joribsbe  
cause for it, proceeding from the conduct :  
the squadrons of France and England, on! .  
coast of the U.S., and on the main aaypt  
being a well known fact that the former  
not maintain as a right or adopt 10 practic  
the doctrine of the latter, to impress seamet  
from our merchant vessels. I then —

the justice and policy of his terminating at  
  
this time all the differences which had arisen  
  
between our governments from this cause,  
  
by an arrangement which should suppress  
  
the practice on the part of G. Britain, and  
  
remedy the evil of which she complained.—  
In aid of those reasons which were applica-  
  
ble to the merits of the question, | urged the  
example given by the late ministry, in the  
paper of Nov. 8th, presented to Mr. Pinck-  
ney and myselt, by the British commission-  
ers, which had, as I thought, laid the foun  
  
dation of such an arrangement. I stated that  
as it was stipulated by that paper, that the  
negociation should be kept open for the pur-  
pose of arranging this great interest, without  
prejudice to the rights of either power, it  
was fairly to be understood as the sense of  
both parties, that our rights were to be re-  
spected, till that arrangement was concluded;  
whence it would follow that the same effect  
would be produced in practice, as if it had  
been provided for by treaty. I relied on  
this paper and the construction which I  
thought it admitted, with which, however,  
the practice had since in no degree corre-  
sponded, to shew the extent to which the  
former ministry had gone in meeting the just  
views of our government, and thereby to  
prove that the present ministry in improving  
that ground had nothing to apprehend from  
the preceding one. Mr. Canning admitted  
that the view which I had taken of this pa-  
per derived much support from its contents,  
and the time and circumstances under which  
it was presented, but persisted in his desire  
to keep the subjects separate. I proposed,  
as an expedient to get rid of his objection,  
that we should take up and arrange both  
poiuts informally, in which case provided it  
was done in a manner to be obligatory, I  
offered to frame my note which should de-  
mand reparatien for the outrage, in general  
ternis, so as that it should not appear by of-  
ficial document, thatthe subjects had any  
connection in the negociation. I urged that  
unless it was intended to make no provision  
against impressment from merchant vessels,  
I could see no objection to his meeting me  
on that ground, as after what had passed, it  
was impossible to take up either subject  
without having the other in view, and  
equally so to devise any mode which should  
keep them more completely separate, than  
that which I proposed. Mr. Canning still  
adhered to his doctrine of having nothing to  
do with impressment from merchant vessels,  
till the affair of the Chesapeake was disposed  
of, afier which he professed his willingness  
to proceed to the other*object. In this  
manner the conference ended, without hay-

conference. As it had not been in my pows  
er tocome toany agreement with him on  
the general subject of impressmeot from  
merchant vessels, I considered it my duty to  
combine it with the affair of the Chesapeake,  
in the paper which I presented him to claim  
reparation for the outrage. I thought it  
best, however, to owit the other acts, of  
which it was desired that the reparation  
should consist. It seemed probable that a  
specification of each circumstance, in the  
note, would increase the indisposition of the  
ministry to accommodate, and give it sups  
port with the nation, in a complete rejection  
of the demand. | expressed myself there-  
fore in regard tothe other acts, in general  
and conciliatory terms, but with all the force  
in my power. ‘lhe details had been com-  
municated to Mr. C. in conference too re-  
cently to be forgotten, Stil) it was just that  
no improper inference should be drawn from  
the omission of them. To prevent it, Iob-  
tained an interviewof Mr. C, immediately  
efter my note was presented, in which, after  
reminding him of the omission alluded to,  
the motive to which I presumed he could not  
mistake, I added that my object in asking  
the interview had been to repeat to him ine  
formally, what I had stated in the former  
one, the other acts of which my government  
expected that reparation should consist, In  
this interview nothing occurred without the  
  
limit of the special object for which it had  
  
been obtained. Mr. C. did not jead the  
conversation to any other topic, and I could  
not invite it —Mr, C.’s answer to my note  
was delayed more than a fortnight. ving  
refiised to treat the subject in connection,  
  
and intimated in plain terms that if I was  
  
not authorised to separate them, it would be  
useless to prolong the discussion, I thought it  
improper to press it. My reply was equal)

pletely the act of his government, You will  
observe that it is annoanced in a form which  
precludes in a great degree, the idea of its  
being adopted at my suggestion, as an act of  
reparation, and in a tone of decision which  
seemed equally to preclude my holding any  
communication with him on it—My mits  
sion being thus brought to an end, has afs  
forded an opportunity for me to return to the

of my country, and my earnest desire to give  
all the aid in my power to the present ad mi-  
nisiration, in support of the principles of our  
most excellent constitution, would have de-  
tained me here so long. In the present  
state, however, it is not possible, if in any it  
would be, for me to render any service by a  
longer continuance here. As soon, there-  
fore, as 1 had answered Mr. C&#x27;s note, I  
communicated to him my intention to re-  
turn, and requested that he would be so good  
as to obtain for me an audience of the king  
for the purpose of taking my leave of him.  
&quot;Fhis was granted on the 7th of this month,  
in which I renewed the assurance of the  
sincere desire of my government, to -pre-  
serve the most friendly relation between the  
U. S. and G. Britain, which sentiment was  
reciprocated by his majesty. Mr. Pinckney  
succeeds me by an arrangement with Mr  
Canning, which will appear in the enclosed  
copy of my correspondence with him, and  
which I have full confidence the president  
will approve. 1 regret that in transferring  
the business into his hands, I do not leave  
him altogether free fron difficulty.
