r Sir  
  
  
  
Montpellier  
  
Ocr. 30. 1828  
  
  
  
In my letter of September 18th. I stated briefly the grounds on which I rested my opinion that a power to  
impose duties &amp; restrictions on imports with a view to encourage domestic productions, was constitutionally lodged  
in Congress. In the observations then made was involved the opinion also, that the power was properly there lodged. As  
this last opinion necessarily implies that there are cases in which the power may be usefully exercised by Congress, the  
only Body within our political system capable of exercising it with effect, you may think it incumbent on me to point out  
cases of that description.  
I will premise that I concur in the opinion that, as a general rule, individuals  
ought to be deemed the best judges, of the best application of their industry and resources.  
I am ready to admit also that there is no Country in which the application may, with more safety, be left to  
the intelligence and enterprize of individuals, than the U. States.  
Finally, I shall not deny that, in all doubtful cases, it becomes every Government to lean rather to a  
confidence in the judgment of individuals, than to interpositions controuling the free exercise of it.  
With all these concessions, I think it can be satisfactorily shewn, that there are exceptions to the general  
rule, now expressed by the phrase &quot;Let us alone,&quot; forming cases which call for interpositions of the competent authority,  
and which are not inconsistent with the generality of the rule.  
1. The Theory of &quot;Let us alone,&quot; supposes that all nations concur in a perfect freedom of commercial  
intercourse. Were this the case, they would, in a commercial view, be but one nation, as much as the several districts  
composing a particular nation; and the theory would be as applicable to the former, as to the latter. But this golden age  
of free trade has not yet arrived: nor is there a single nation that has set the example. No nation can, indeed, safely do  
so, until a reciprocity at least be ensured to it. Take for a proof, the familiar case of the navigation employed in a  
foreign commerce. If a nation adhering to the rule of never interposing a countervailing protection of its vessels, admits  
foreign vessels into its ports free of duty, whilst its own vessels are subject to a duty in foreign ports, the ruinous  
effect is so obvious, that the warmest advocate for the theory in question, must shrink from a universal application of it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all cases, to regulate itself, might soon find it regulated by other  
nations, into a subserviency to a foreign interest. In the interval between the peace of 1783, and the establishment of  
the present Constitution of the U. States, the want of a General authority to regulate trade, is known to have had this  
consequence. And have not the pretensions &amp; policy latterly exhibited by G. Britain, given warning of a like  
result from a renunciation of all countervailing regulations, on the part of the U. States. Were she permitted, by  
conferring on certain portions of her Domain the name of Colonies, to open from these a trade for herself, to foreign  
Countries, and to exclude, at the same time, a reciprocal trade to such Colonies by foreign Countries, the use to be made  
of the monopoly need not be traced. Its character will be placed in a just relief, by supposing that one of the Colonial  
Islands, instead of the present distance happened to be in the vicinity of G. Britain, or that one of the Islands in that  
vicinity, should receive the name &amp; be regarded in the light of a Colony, with the peculiar privileges claimed for  
colonies. Is it not manifest, that in this case, the favored Island might be made the sole medium of the commercial  
intercourse with foreign nations, and the parent Country thence enjoy every essential advantage, as to the terms of it,  
which would flow from an unreciprocal trade from her other ports with other nations.  
Fortunately the British claims, however speciously coloured or adroitly managed, were repelled at the  
commencement of our commercial career as an Independent people; and at successive epochs under the existing Constitution,  
both in Legislative discussions, and in diplomatic negociations. The claims were repelled on the solid ground, that the  
Colonial trade as a rightful monopoly, was limited to the intercourse between the parent  
Country &amp; its Colonies, and between one Colony and another; the whole being, strictly, in the nature of a coasting  
trade from one to another port of the same nation; a trade with which no other nation has a right to interfere. It follows  
of necessity, that the Parent Country, whenever it opens a Colonial port for a direct trade to a foreign Country, departs  
itself from the principle of Colonial monopoly, and entitles the foreign Country to the same reciprocity in every respect,  
as in its intercourse with any other ports of the nation.  
This is common sense, and common right. It is still more, if more could be required. It is in conformity with  
the established usage of all nations, other than Great Britain, which have colonies; notwithstanding British  
representations to the contrary. Some of those nations are known to adhere to the monopoly of their Colonial trade, with  
all the rigor &amp; constancy which circumstances permit. But it is also known, that whenever, and from whatever  
cause, it has been found necessary or expedient, to open their Colonial ports to a foreign trade, the rule of reciprocity  
in favour of the foreign party, was not refused, nor, as is believed, a right to refuse it ever pretended.  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity was dictated by a deficiency of the commercial marine. France, at  
least, could not be, in every instance, governed by that consideration; and Holland still less: to say nothing of the  
navigating States of Sweeden and Denmark, which have rarely if ever, enforced a colonial monopoly. The remark is indeed  
obvious, that the shipping liberated from the usual conveyance of supplies from the parent Country to the Colonies, might  
be employed in the new channels opened for them, in supplies from abroad.  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the only rule of intercourse among Independent communities; and no  
nation ought to admit a doctrine, or adopt an invariable policy, which would preclude the counteracting measures necessary  
to enforce the rule.  
2. The Theory supposes moreover a perpetual peace, not less chimerical, it is to be feared, than a universal  
freedom of commerce.  
The effect of war among the commercial and manufacturing nations of the world, in raising the wages of labour  
and the cost of its products, with a like effect on the charges of freight and insurance, needs neither proof nor  
explanation. In order to determine, therefore, a question of economy between depending on foreign supplies, and  
encouraging domestic substitutes, it is necessary to compare the probable periods of war, with the probable periods of  
peace; and the cost of the domestic encouragement in times of peace, with the cost added to foreign articles in times of  
war.  
During the last century the periods of war and of peace have been nearly equal. The effect of a State of war  
in raising the price of imported articles, can not be estimated with exactness. It is certain, however, that the increased  
price of particular articles, may make it cheaper to manufacture them at home.  
Taking, for the sake of illustration, an equality in the two periods, and the cost of an imported yard of  
cloth in time of war to be 9 1/2 dollars, and in time of peace to be 7 dollars, whilst the same could, at all times, be  
manufactured at home, for 8 dollars; it is evident that a tariff of 1 1/4 dollars on the imported yard, would protect the  
home manufacture in times of peace, and avoid a tax of 1 1/2 dols. imposed by a state of war.  
It cannot be said that the manufactories, which could not support themselves in periods of peace, would  
spring up of themselves at the recurrence of war prices. It must be obvious to every one, that apart from the difficulty  
of great &amp; sudden changes of employment, no prudent capitalists would engage in expensive establishments of any  
sort, at the commencement of a war of uncertain duration, with a certainty of having them crushed by the return of peace.  
The strictest economy, therefore, suggests, as exceptions to the general rule, an estimate, in every given  
case, of war &amp; peace periods and prices, with inferences therefrom, of the amount of a tariff which might be  
afforded during peace, in order to avoid the tax resulting from war. And it will occur at once, that the inferences will  
be strengthened, by adding to the supposition of wars wholly foreign, that of wars in which our Country might be a party

Mo&gt;TrEi.UER, Oct. 30, 1828.  
Dear Sir: 1»» my- letter of September 18th I  
atu rd briefly, the grounds on which 1 resled  
my opinion, that a power to impose duties and  
restrictions on imports, with a view to encour­  
age domestic productions, was constitutionally  
lodged in Congress. In the observations then  
ma le was involved the opinion, also that the  
power was properly there lodged. As this last  
opinion necessarily implies that there are ca^ei  
in which the power may be usefully *xeicised  
by Congress, the ordv body within our political  
system capable of*■x^rcising it with effect, you  
may think it incuinlrent on me to point out ca  
ses of that description.  
1 will premia* that I concur in the opinion,  
that, as a general rule, individuals oug »i to be  
U*-enied the best judges of the best application  
of their industry and resources  
I am ready to admit, also, there is no coun  
rrv in which the application may, with more  
  
•safety, be left to Ute intelligence ana enterprise  
of individuals, than the United Stages.  
Finally, 1 shall not denv, that, in all doubtful  
cases, it becomes every Government to learn  
rather IQ a CO&#x27;fidence in tin* judgement of incii  
vduals, than to interpositions controlling the  
free ex rcise of it.  
W ith all these concessions, I think it can be  
sati factonally shown,that theie ute exceptions  
to the general rule,now* expressed by the phrase  
4 Le| us aloU* ,” forming cases which call for  
imerposil&#x27;oii &gt; of the competent authority, and  
which ate not incor.uiveni with the generality  
o! tt.e rule.  
1. l’i&gt;c i*heo-y of I.et us *lnne” supposes  
that ail nau ins eo’icttr rn a perfect frtrdom of  
commercial intercouisei Were this the case,  
they would, in a com n rci. 1 view, be but one  
n-tion, ai mucii as the several distticts com*  
posing a paricular tra&#x27;i-n, Sc the theory would  
be as applicable to the former as to the latter.  
Rut this goldti age of fur trade h:.s no: yet  
the example u ion can, i!.de*c’, safely  
d i so, umi! a reciprocity, at least, Ke ensured  
toil. T.ike, for a proof, the familiar case of:  
the navigation, adhering to t^e rule of never

vessels, admin foreign vessels into its Forts  
f.ee orduty, whilst its own vessels are subject  
to a July in foreign ports, the ruinous « ff ct ts 1  
so obvious, that the warmest advocate lot- the  
theory in question must shrink from a umver­  
*al application ol it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all cases  
to regulate itself, might so n find it rt gu ated.  
by other na ions, into a subserviency to a for- j  
»ig.v uvrres . In the interval between the &#x27;

time, a reciprocal trade to such Colonics, by  
foieig&#x27;i c (un&#x27;ries, the use to be made of the  
mo &lt;*polv need not be traced. Its character  
vt i I l&gt;e placed in a just rrltel, by vuppo«itig ihai !  
one of the Colonial Island*, instead of i s p&lt;e- i  
s it divauce, happened to be in the vicinity of

vicinity *hou d receive the name ami be regard­  
ed in tlic light of u Col &gt;ny, with the peculiar  
piivileges claimed lor Colonies. Is it not m.«n­  
ifes , that, in this case, the favored Is and might  
be made the sole medium ol the commercial in* |  
trreourve with foreign nations, and tne parent ;  
country thence enjo.’ every e&amp;sen ial ad* an&#x27;a go, 1  
as to the terms ol it, which would flow from an  
unreciptocal trade from her other ports, with  
o.he: nations?  
For-unately, the British claims, however spe­  
ciously colored or adronly managed, were re­  
plied at the commencement ol ..ur commer­  
cial career as an Independent People, and at i  
successive epochs under the existing Consti*  
tutton,both tu legislative discuvsions jnJ in di­  
plomatic negotiations. &#x27;1 he claims wrre re­  
pelled ou the solid ground that »he Colonial  
trade, as a rightlul monopoly, was limited to  
the intercourse between the parent country and  
its colonies, and between on*- colony and anoth­  
er; the whole being, sirioty.in the nature of a  
coasting trade from one »o another port of the  
same nation; a trad • wiin whi h no other nation  
has a right to inierfne. It follows, of neressity,  
that the parent coumry whenever it opens a co  
lonial port f*&gt;r a direct trad*- to a foieign coun- |  
try to the same reciprocity, in every respect, as i  
in its ioiercouise with any other ports of the  
nation. 1 &lt;  
This is common sense and common right.— t  
It is Mill more, if more tould be r-qutred. It I  
is in conformity with the ts-abii-hed usage ol t  
all nations, other han (Jr&lt;a Biain, which (  
have colonies tv*roe of those nations are t  
known to adhere to the monop toy of their co- -  
Initial trad*, with »&#x27;l toe rigor ind constancy t  
which circwmstauocs permit. But it is aiso t  
  
known, that, whenever, and from whatever&#x27;  
cause, it lias been found nesces»a&gt;y or exoedi- j  
ent to open their colonial ports t&lt;» a foreign  
trade, the rule of reciprocity in favor of the  
foteign party was no*, r« fused, nor, as is be­  
lieved, a right to refuse it pretended  
It cannot be said that the recipro* i y was  
dictated by a d firitncy of the commercial ma­  
rine Fiance. at least, could not be, in every  
instance, governed bv that consideta’ion —and  
Holland, still less, to say nothing of the navi­  
gating States of Sweden and Denmark, which  
have rarely, if ever, enforced a colonial mono­  
poly. The remark is, indeed, obvious, that the  
shipping liberated from the usual cunvey.vtire  
of supplies from the parent country &lt;o &#x27;he  
colonies might be employed in the pew than  
ncls opened for them, in supp&#x27;ic* from ubroid­  
Recipiocitv, or an equivalent for it, is the  
only rule of intercourse among independent  
communi’ies; and no nation ougo&#x27; to admit a  
doctrine, o&#x27; adopt an invariable policy, which  
would preclude the counteracting measures  
! necessaty to enforce the tufe.  
2. The Theory supposes, moreover, a perpe­  
tual peace; a supposition, it is to be feared, nut  
less chimerical than a universal freedom of  
commeice.  
The i ff&lt; ct of war among the commercial and  
■ manufacturing nations of the world, in raising  
I the wages of labor, and the cost oT ns products;  
with a like effect on the ( barges of freight and  
] insurance, need neither proof nor explanation  
i In order to determine, therefore, a question of  
economy, between depending on foreign sup­  
plies, and encouraging domestic sub-titutes, it  
is necessary to compare the probable periods  
of war with the probable periods of peart; and  
the cost of the domestic encouragement in  
• imes of peace, with the cost added to foreign  
ai icles in times of war.  
During the last century, the periods of war  
and peace have beren nearly equ tl. The effect  
of a sute of war in raising the price of impoi t­  
t ed articles, Cannot be estimated with exactness.  
It is certain, however, thai the increased price  
of particular articles may make it cheaper to  
manufacture them at home.  
Taking, for the sake of-illustration, an rqua­  
Iity in the two period*, and the cost of an im­  
ported yard of cloth in &gt;ime of war to be nine  
  
arid a halt dollars, and m time ol peace to d  
he veil dollars, whilst the same could at all tim&lt; s  
be manufactured at home lor e ght dollars, it  
| is evident that a tariff of one dollar and a quar­  
ter oil the imported yard would protect the  
home manufacture in time of peace, anti avoid  
a tax of one dol&#x27;ar and a half impos* d by a  
state of war  
It cannot lie said that the manufactories which  
could not support ilu mselves against foreign  
competi ion in periods of peace, w &gt;u!d spring  
up of themselves at the recurrence of war pric­  
es. It must be obvious to every one, that, apart  
from the difficulty of great and sudden Chang&#x27; s  
« f employment, m prudent cap talisis would  
engage in expensive establishments of anv sort,  
at the commencement ol a war of uncertain du­  
ration, with a certainty of having them crush­  
ed by the return ot p-jee.  
The strictest economy therefore sugg-st*,, as  
exceptions to the general rule, an estimate, in  
every giv-n rase, of war and peace periods and  
of a tariff which migli be afforded during  
peace, in order to avoid th** tax resulting from  
war. And it will occur at on« e, that the infer­  
ences will he strengthened &#x27;by adding, to the  
supposition of wars wholly foreign, that of  
wars in which our own country might be a

with a view to encourage domestic productions, was cons

it cot gy aera | government to lean rather to a confi-

_ With all these concessions, I think it can be satisfac-  
torily shown, that there are exceptions to the general  
tule, now expressed by the phrase ‘‘L¢t us alone,” form-  
ing cases which call for interpositions of the eompc-  
tent authority, and which are not inconsistent with the  
generality of the rule. .  
~ 4. The theory of ‘‘Let.us alone” supposes that all na-  
‘tions concur in a perfect frecdom of commercial inter-  
course. Were thisthe case, they would, in a commercial  
view, be but one nation, as.much as the several districts  
compo 52 particular natiou; and the theory would be  
plicable to the former as to the latter. But this  
golden age of free trade has not yet arrived: nor is there  
a single nation that has set the example. No nation can,  
indeed, safely do so, until a reciprocity, at least, be en-  
suredtoit. Take, fora proof, the familiar case of the  
navigation employed in foreign commerce. Ifa nation,  
adhering to the rule of never interposing a countervailing  
protection of @s vessels, admits foreign vessels into its  
ports free of duty, whilst its own vessels are subject to a  
duty in foreign ports, the ruinous effect is so obvious,  
that the warmest advocate for the theory in question must  
ahrink from a wriversal application of it.  
  
A nation Ieaving its foreign trade, in all cases, to reg-  
ulate itself, might soon fiud it regulated, by other na-  
tions, into a subserviency to a forciguinterest. In the  
interval between the peace of 1783 and the establish-  
ment of the present constitution of the United States,  
the want of a general authority to regulate trade is’  
known to have had this consequence. And have not |  
the pretensions and policy latterly exhibited by Great |  
Britain given warning of a like result from a renuncia- |  
tion of all couutervuiling regulations on the part of the |  
United States? ‘Were she permitted, by conferring on)  
certain portions of-her domain the name of colonies, to  
open from these a trade for herself, to foreign countries,  
and to exclude, at the same time,.a reciprocal trade to |  
such colonies, by foreign conntries, the use to be made  
of the monopoly need not be traced. Its character will  
be placed in a just relief, by supposing that one of the  
colonia! island, mstead of its present distance, happened  
to be in the vicinity of Great Britain; or that one of the  
islands in that vicinity should receive thut name and be  
regarded in the light of a colony, with the peculiar pri-  
v sclaimed for colonies. Is it not manifest, that,  
in this case, the favored island might be made the sole  
medium of the commercial intercourse with foreign na-  
tions, and the parent country thence enjoy every essen-  
tial advantage, as to the terms of it, which would flow  
from an wrrectprocal trade from her other ports, with  
other nations?  
  
Fortunately, the British claims, lLowever speciously  
colored or adroitly managed, were repelled at the com-  
wencement of our commercial career xs an independent  
people, and at successive epochs under the existing con-  
stitution, both in legislative discussions and in diplomat-

permit. But it is also known, that, whenever, and from  
whatever cause, it has been found necessary or ex dient  
to open their colonial ports.to a foreign trade, the rut.  
of reciprocity in fayor. of the foreign party was not re.  
used, nor, asis believed, a right to refuse it pretended  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity was dictated by  
a deficiency of the commercial marine. France, 3;  
least, could not be, in every instance, governed by ‘that  
consideration—and Holland still less: to say nothing of  
the navigating states of Sweden and Denmark, whic),  
have rarely, if ever, enforced a colonial monopoly,—  
The remark is, indeed, obvious, that the shipping libera-  
ted from the usual conveyane¢ of supplies from the parent  
country to the colonies, might be employed in the ney  
chunnels opened for them, in supplies from abroad,  
  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the only rule of  
intercyurse among the independent communities; and no  
nation oughtto admit a doctrine, or adopt.an invariable  
policy, which would preclude the counteracting measures  
necessary to inforce the rule.  
  
2. The theory supposes, moreover, a perpetual peace;  
a supposition, it is to be feared, not less chimercial than  
a universal freedom of commerce.  
  
The effect of war among the commercial and manufac.  
turing nations of the world, in raising the wages of labor,  
and the cost of its products; with a like effect on the  
charges of freight and insurance, need neither proot nor  
explanation. In order to determine, therefore, a ques-  
tion of economy, between depending on foreign supplies,  
and encouraging domestic substitutes, it is necessary to  
compare the probable periods of war with the probable  
periods of peace; and the cost of the domestic encourage-  
ment in times of peace, with the cost added to foreign ar-  
ticles in times of war.

Daring the last century, the periods of war and peace  
have been nearly equal. The effect of a state of war  
in raising the price ef imported articles, cannot be esti-  
mated with exactness. It is certain, however, that the  
increased price of particularjarticles may make it cheaper  
to manufacture them at home.  
  
‘Taking, for the sake of illustration, an equality in the  
two periods, and the cost of an imported yard of cloth in  
time of war to be nine and a half dollars, and in time of  
peace, to be seven dollars, whilst the same could at all  
times be manufactured at home for eight dollars, it is  
evident that a tariff of one dollar and a quarter on the in-  
ported -yard would protect the home manufacture in time  
of peace, and avoid a tax of one doilar and ahali imposed  
by a state of war.  
  
It cunnot be said that the manufactorics which could  
not support themselves against foreign competition in  
periods of peace, would spring up of themselves at the  
recurrence of war prices. It must be obvious to every  
one, that, apart from the difficulty of great and sudden  
changes. of employment, no prudent capitalists would en-  
gage in expensive establishments of any sort, at the com-  
meucemcut of a war. ofuncertain duration with a certainty  
of having them crushed by the return of peace.  
  
The strictest economy therefore suggests, as excep-  
tions to. the gencral rule, an estimate, in every given  
case, of war and peace periods and prices, with inferen-  
eesthercfrom, ofthe amount of a tariff which might 0¢  
afforded curing peace, in order to avoid the tax result  
ing from war. And it will occur at once, that the ir-  
ferences will be strengthened by adding, to the suppos&#x27;-  
tiou of wars wholly foreign, that of wars in which ow  
own country might be a party.

Mon i prUER, October 30,1S2S.  
T)rAR Srn,—fn my letter of September ISrh, f  
stated, briefly, the grounds on which I tested my  
opinion, that a power to impose duties and re­  
strictions on impoits, with a view to encourage  
domestic productions, was constitutionally lodg­  
ed in Congress, fn (lie observations then made  
was involved tho opinion, also, that the power  
was properly there lodged. As this last opinion  
necessarily implies that there are cases in which  
the power may he usefully exercised by Cotigress,  
the only body within our political system capa­  
ble of exercising it with effect, you may think it  
incumbent on me to point out cases of that de­  
scription.  
I will premise that f concur in the opinion, that,  
at a eenrral rule, individuals ought to he deemed  
the best judges o’* the host application ot their in­  
dustry and resources.  
I r.m ready to admit, also, that there is no coun­  
try in which the application may, with more safe­  
ty, he left to the intelligence and enterprise of in­  
dividuals, than the U. SS&#x27;ates.  
Finally, I (.hall not deny, that, in all doubtful  
cases, it becomes every Government to lean rather  
to a confidence in the judgment of individuals,  
than to interpositions controlling the free exer­  
cise of it.  
With all these concessions, I think it ran be  
satisfactorily shown, that there are exceptions to!  
the general rule, now expressed by tiie phrase,  
•« Let us alone,” forming cases which call for in- I  
terpositions ef the competent authority, and i  
which arc not inconsistent with the generality of j  
the rule.  
  
1. j no i n*ory ci us aione, supposes i  
that all nations concur in a perfect freedom of]  
commercial intercourse. Were this the rase, they I  
would, in a commercial view, be but one nation,  
os much as the several districts composing a par­  
ticular nation; and the theory would be as apph  
cable to the former as to the latter, But this  
golden age of free trade has not yet arrived—nor  
is there a single nation that has set the example.  
No nation can, indeed, safely do so, until a reci­  
procity, at least, ho ensured to it. Take, for a  
proof, the familiar ca*c of the navigation employ  
ed in a foreign commerce. If a nation, adhering  
to the rule of never interposing a countervailing  
protection of its vessels, admits foreign vessels into  
its ports free of duty, whilst its own vessels are  
subject to a duty in foreign ports, the ruinous ef­  
fect is so ohviou0, that the warmest advocate for  
the theory in question must shrink from a urtiver  
gal application of it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all ca«es,  
to regulate itself, might soon find it reg dated, by  
other nations, into a *uh-erviency to a foreign in­  
terest. In the interval brtween the peace of  
17S3 and the establishment of the present Con­  
stitution oi the United States, the wont of a ge­  
neral authoiity to regu&#x27;atn trade i« known to have  
had this consequence- And have not the preten­  
sions and policy latte ly exhibited by Great Biitain  
given warning of a lik&quot; result from n renunciation  
of-all countervailing regulation* on the part of the  
Uni&#x27;ol States? Weie she permitted, by confer­  
ring on certain portions of her domain the name  
of Colonies, to open from these a trade for herself,  
to fi.eign countriec, and to exclude, at the seme  
time, a reciprocal trade to such Colonies, by fo­  
reign countries, the use to 1 e mule of the rnonop  
oly need not be traced. Itscliaracter will he plac­  
&#x27;d in a jt st relief, by slippering that on&quot; of the Co  
lonial Islands, instead of i’spresent distance, hup  
pened to be in the vicinity of Great Britain; or that  
•vie of the Islands in that vieinitv should receive  
the name and be re; arded in the light of a t’olony,  
wilh tho peculiar privileges claimed for Colonies.  
Is it no* manifest, that, in this case, the favored  
Island might he made the sole medium of the  
commercial intercourse with foreign nations, and  
the parent country thence enjoy every essential  
advantage, a« to the terms of it, which would flow  
from an unreciproral trade from her other pot ts,  
with other nation&quot;?  
Fortunately, the British claims, however spe­  
ciously cotorod or adroitly managed, were repel! |  
■ d s&#x27;, tb a eem tn &lt;■*&gt;&quot;■ ‘O1 c,oi*-,&#x27;“&#x27;Trrc»lo^-.-,gr  
  
as an Independent iVople, and ut successive epochs &lt;  
under the existing Constitution, both in legislative  
discussions and iu diplomatic negociations. 1&#x27;hc j  
; claims were repelled on the solid ground that the i  
| Colonial trade, as a rightful monopoly, was limit­  
I cd to tho intercom so between the parent country  
j and its colonies, and botween one colony and ano­  
j ther; the whole being, strictly, in the nature of a  
i coasting tiade from one to another port of the same  
: nation; a trade with which no other nation has a  
■right to interfere. It follows, of necessity, that the  
i parent country, whenever it opens a colonial port  
1 for a direct trade to a foreign country, departs, it­  
self, from the principle of colonial monopoly, and  
entitles the foreign country to the same recipro­  
city, in every respect, as in its intercourse with any  
other ports of the nation.  
This is common sense and common r s’it. It  
is still more, if more could he required, it is in  
conformity with the established usage of all na­  
tions, other than (ircat Biitain, which have colo­  
nies. Some ot&#x27;lhnse nations are known to adhere  
to the monopoly of their colonial trade, with all th»*  
rigor and constancy which circumstances permit, j  
But it is also known, that, whenever, and from  
whatever cause, it has been found necessary or  
expedient to open their colonial putts to a foreign  
trade, the rule of reciprocity in lavorof tho foreign  
party wa9 not refused, nor, as is believed, a right  
to refuse it pretended.  
It cannot he said that the reciprocity was dic­  
tated by a deficiency of the commercial marine.—  
France, at least, could not be, in every instance,  
governed by that consideration—and Holland,  
still less : to say nothing of tho navigating States  
of Sweden and Denmark, which have rarely,if  
! ever, enforced a colonial monopoly. The remark  
• is, indeed, obvious, that the shipping liberated  
: from the usual conveyance of supplies from the  
: parent country to the colonies might he employ­  
ed in the new channels opened for them, in sup­  
plies from abroad.  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the only  
• rule of intercourse among independent romum­  
• nities; and no nation ought to admit a doctrine, or i  
| adopt an invariable policy, which would preclude I  
! the counteracting measures necessary to enforce I  
• the rule.  
  
2. I lie Theory supposes, moreover, a perpetual  
peace; a supposition, it i9 to be feared, not lcsschi­  
. metical than a universal freedom of commerce.  
The effect of war among the commercial and  
manufactuiing nations of the world, in raising the  
wages of labor, and the cost of its products with a  
■ like effect on the charges of freight and insurance,  
nerd neither proof nor explanation. In older  
i to determine, therefore, n question of economy,  
J between depending on foreign supplies, and en  
■ couraging domestic substitutes, it is necessary to  
compare the probable periods of war with the  
probable periods of peace; and tire cost of the  
domestic encouragement in times of peace, with  
the cost added to foreign articles in times of war  
During the last century, the periods oT war and  
peace have been nearly equal. The effect of a  
“late of war in raising tire price of imported arti­  
cles, cannot be estimated with exactness. It i­  
certuin, however, that tire increased price of par­  
ticular articles may mako it cheaper to manufac­  
ture them at home.  
Taking, for the sake of illustration, an equality  
in tiro two periods, and the cost of an imported  
yard of cloth in time of war to be $9 1-2, and in  
time of peace tobe ;S;7, whilst the same could at  
all times be manufactured at home lor SH, it i*  
evident that a tariff of rjil 1-4 on tire imported  
yard would protect the home manufacture in time  
ol peace, and avoid a tax of .-jil 1-2 imposed by a  
state of war.  
It cannot be said that the manufactories which  
could not support themselves again-t foreign com­  
petition in periods of peace, would spring up of  
themselves at the recurrence of war prices. It  
must be obvious to every one, that, apart from the  
difficulty of great and sudden changes of employ­  
ment, no prudent capitalists would engage in ex­  
pensive establishments of any sort, at the com­  
mencement ot a war ot uncertain duration, with  
a certainty of having them crushed by the return  
of peace.  
The strictest economy therefore suggest, as ex  
ceptions to the general rule, an estimate, in every  
given case, ol war and peace periods and price-,  
with inferences therefrom, of the amount of a ta­  
riff which might be afforded during peace, in order  
to avoid the tax resulting from war. Audit will  
occur at once, that the inferences will be strength­  
ened by adding, to the supposition of wars wholly  
foreign, that of wars in which our own country  
might be a party

Montpelier, Oct. 30, 1828.  
tw0 Sm: In mv letter of September J8th,I  
stated, briefly, tlie grounds on which I rested my  
opinion, that a power to impose amies mu .c­  
strictions on imports, with a view to encourage  
-imn8tir nroductions. was constitutionally lodg-  
in Congress. In the observations then made  
un involved the opinion, also, that the power  
was Drooerly there lodged. As this last opinion  
orOSnrilv imDlies that there arc cases in which  
the power may bo usefully exercised by Congress,  
nnlv hodv within our political system capa  
ble of exercising it with effect, you may think it  
incumbent on me to point out cases oi mat ae  
I will nremiso that I concur in the opinion,  
that, as a general rule, individuals ought to be  
deemed the best judges ot the Desi application  
nf their industry and resources.  
I am ready to admit, also, that there is rto  
country in which the application may, with more  
safety, be left to the intelligence ana enterprise  
of individuals, than the United States.  
Finally, I shall not deny, that, in all doubtful  
.-ases. it becomes every Government to lean ra  
ther to a confidence in the judgment of individu  
als, than to interpositions controlling the tree ex  
crcise of it. &#x27;  
With nil these concessions, I think it can be  
satisfactorily shown, that there are exceptions to  
the general rule, now expressed by tho phrase  
&#x27; Let us alone,&quot; forming cases which call for in  
terpositions of the competent authority, and  
which are not inconsistent with the generality of  
the rule.  
1. Tho Theory of &quot; Let us alone&quot; supposes  
that all nations concur in a perfect freedom of  
commercial intercourse. Were this the case  
they would, in a commercial view, be but one na  
tion, as much as the several districts composing  
a particular nation ; and the theory would be as  
applicable to the former as to the latter. But  
this golden age of free trade has not yet arrived  
nor is there a single nation that has set the cx  
ample. No nation can, indeed, safely do so, un  
til a recipjpeity, at least, be ensured to it. Take,  
for a proof, the familiar case of the navigation  
employed in a foreign commerce. If a nation,  
adhering to the rule of never interposing a coun  
tcrvailing protection of its vessels, admits foreign  
vessels into its ports free of duty, whilst Us own  
vessels are subject to a duty in foreign ports, the  
ruinous effect is so obvious, that the warmest ad  
vocate for the theory in question must shrink  
lrom a universal application of it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all cases,  
to regulate itself, might soon find it regulated, by  
other nations, into a subserviency to a foreign in  
terest. In the interval between the peace of  
183 and the establishment of the present Con  
stitution of the United States, the want of a ge  
neral authority to regulate trade is known to have  
had this consequence. And have not the pre  
tensions and policy latterly exhibited by Great  
Britain given warning of a like result from a re  
nunciation of all countervailing regulations on the  
part of the United States ? Were she permitted,  
by conferring on certain portions of her domain  
the name of Colonies, to open from these a trade  
tor herself, to foreign countries, and to exclude,  
at the same time, a reciprocal trade to such Co  
lonies, by foreign countries, the use to be made  
of the monopoly need not be traced. Its charac  
ter will be placed in a just relief, by supposing  
that one of the Colonial Islands, instead oi its  
present distance, happened to be in the vicinity  
of Great Britain ; or that ono of the Islands in  
that vicinitv should receive the name and bo re  
garded in the light of a Colony, with the pecu  
liar privileges claimed for Colonies. Is it not  
manifest, that, in this case, the favoured Island  
might bo made the sole medium of the commer  
cial intercourse with foreign nations, and the pa  
rent country thence enjoy every essential advan  
tage, as to the terms ot it, which would flow lrom  
an unreciprocal trade from her other ports, with  
otner nations i  
Fortunately, the British claims, however spe­  
ciously coloured or adroitly managed, were re­  
pelled at the commencement of our commercial  
career as an Independent People, and at succes  
sive epochs undci the existing Constitution, both  
in legislative discussions and in diplomatic nego  
tiations. The claims were repelled on the solid  
ground that tho Colonial trade, as a rightful mo­  
nopoly, was limited to the intercourse between  
the parent country and its colonies, and between  
one colony and another ; the whole being strict­  
ly, in the nature of a coasting trado from one to  
another port of the same nation ; a trade with  
which no other nation has a right to interfere.  
It follows, of necessity, that the parent count! ,  
trade to a foreign country, departs, itself, from  
pnncipio ot colonial monopoly, and entitles  
  
the foreign country to the same reciprocity, in  
  
every respect, as in its intercourse with any other  
ports ot the nation.  
This is common sense and common right. It  
is still more, if more cpuld be required. It is in  
conformity with the established usage of all na­  
tions, otlier than Great Britain, which have colo  
nies. - Some of those nations aro known to ad­  
here to the monopoly of their colonial trade, with  
all the rigour and constancy which circumstances  
permit. , But it is also known, that, .whenever,  
and from whatever cause, it has been found ne­  
cessary or expedient to open their colonial ports  
to a foreign trade.&#x27;the rule of reciprocity in favor  
of the foreign party was not refused, nor, as is  
believed, a right to retuse it pretended. ,  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity was dic  
tated by a deficiency of the commercial marine.  
i ranee, at least, could not be, in every instance.  
governed by that consideration and Holland,  
still less: to say nothing of the navigating States  
of sweeden and Uenmark, which have rarely, if  
ever, enforced a colonial monopoly. The re  
mark is, indeed, obvious, that the slnppinr libera  
ted from the usual conveyance of supplies from  
the parent country to the colonies might be era-  
ployed in the new .channels opened for them, in  
supplies from abroad, , .  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the only  
rule of intercourse among independent commu­  
nities ; and no nation ought to admit a doctrine,  
or adopt an invariable policy, which would pre­  
clude the counteracting measures necessary to  
enforce the rule. &quot;; ,  
2. The Theory supposes, moreover, a perpe­  
tual peace ; a supposition, it is to be feared, not  
less chimerical than a universal freedom of com­  
merce. . &quot; v , &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;  
&#x27; The effect of war among tho commercial and  
manufacturing nations of the world, in raising the  
wages of labour, and the cost of its products;  
with a like effect on tlw charges of freight and  
insurance, need neither proof nor explanation.  
In order to determine, therefore, a question of  
economy, between depending on foreign supplies,  
and encouraging domestic substitutes, it is neces­  
sary to compare the probable periods of war with  
the probable periods of peace ; and the cost of  
the domestic encouragement in times of peace,  
with the cost added to foreign articles in times of  
war.  
During the last century, the periods of war and  
peace have been nearly equal. The effect of a  
state of war in raising the price of imported arti  
cles, cannot be estimated with exactness. It is  
certain, however, that the increased price of par  
ticular articles may make it cheaper to manufac  
ture them at home.  
Taking, for the sake of illustration, an equality  
in tho two periods, and the cost of an imported  
vard of cloth in time of war to be nine and a half  
dollars, and in time of peace to be seven dollars,  
whilst the same could at all times be manufac  
tured at home for eight dollars, it is evident that  
a tariff of one dollar and a quarter on the import­  
ed yard would protect the home manufacture in  
time of peace, and avoid a tax of one dollar and  
a half imposed by a state of war.  
It cannot be said that the manufactories which  
could not support themselves against foreign com  
petition in periods of peace, would spring up of  
themselves at the recurrence of war prices. It  
must be obvious to every one, that, apart from the  
difficulty of great and sudden changes of employ  
ment, no prudent capitalist would engage in ex  
pensive establishments of any sort, at the com­  
mencement of a war of uncertain duration, with  
a certainty of having them crushed by tho re  
turn of peace.  
The strictest economy therefore suggests, as  
exceptions to the general rule, an estimate, in  
every given case, of war and peace periods and  
prices, with inferences therefrom, of the amount  
of a tariff which might be afforded during peace,  
in order to avoid the tax resulting from war. And  
it will occur at once, that the inferences will be  
strengthened by adding, to the supposition of  
wars wholly foreign, that of wars in which onr  
own country might be a party

Finally, I shall not deny, that, in ali doubtful  
cases, it becomes every Goverament to lean rather  
to a contidence in the judgment of individua&#x27;s, than  
to interpositions contralling the free excercise of&#x27;it.  
With all these concessions, I think it ean be eat.  
isfactorily shown, that there are exceptions to the  
general rule, now expressed by the phrase *“Let us  
alone,” forming cases which call ior interpositions  
of the competent authority, and which are not in­  
consistent with the generality of theiule.  
1. The Theory of **Let ns alone’ supposes that  
all natious concur in u perfect freedom of commer­  
cial interoourse. Wero this the case, they would,  
in a commercie! view, be but one nution, as much  
as the several districts composing A particular na­  
tivn ; and the theary wou!d be as applicable to the  
former as tv the latter, DBt this golden age of free  
trade has not yet arrived ; nor is there a single na­  
tion that has set the example. No nation can, in­  
deed, safely do «», until a reeiprocity, ut least, be  
ensured to it. Take, for a proof; the familiar case  
of the navigation emploved in a foreign commerce  
If a nation, adhering to the rule of never interposing  
a countervailing protection of its vessels, admits  
foreign vessels into its ports free of duty, whilst its  
own vessels are subject to a duty in foraiga ports,  
the roinous effect is s 0 obvious, that the warmest  
advocate for the theory in question must shrink from  
a universal application of it.  
A nation leaving its faneign trade, in all cases, to  
regutato itself, might soon find it regulated, by other  
nations, into a subserviency to a foreign interesl.  
In the interval between the poace of 1783 and Ihe  
establishment of the presext Constitution of the  
United States, the want of a general authority to  
regulate trade is known to have had this conse­  
quence. And have not the pretendions and policy  
latterly exhibited by Grest Britain given warning  
of a like result from a renunciation of ail- counter­  
vailing regulations on the part of the Unitad Statoes?  
Were she permitted, by conferring on certain por­  
tions of ‘her domain the name of Coloniss, to open  
from thesa a trade for herself, to foreing couutrins,  
and to exclude, at the same time, &amp; reciproecal trade  
to such Colonies, by foreign ecuntries, tﬁc use to be  
made of the monopoly need not be traced. Its char­  
acter will be placed in a just reliel, by supposing  
that one of the Colonial Islands, instead of its pres­  
ent distance, hanpened to be in the vicinity of  
Great Britain; or that one of the Islands in that vi­  
cinity should receive the name and be regarded in  
the light of a Colony, with the peculiar privileges  
claimed for Colonies. Is it not manifest, that,  
this case, the favored Island might be made the sole  
medium of the commercial intercourse with foreign  
nations, and the parent country thence enjoy every  
essential advantage, as to ithe terms of it, which  
would flow from au unreciprocal trade from her  
other ports, with other nations?  
Fortunately, the British claims, however specious­  
ly colored or adroitly managed, were repelied at the  
commencement of our commercial carecr, as an In­  
dependent People,’and at successive epochs under  
the existing Constitution, both in legislative discus­  
sions and in diplomatic negotiations. The claims  
ware repelled on the solid ground that the Colonial  
trade, as a rightful monopoly, wag limited to the in­  
tercourse between the parent eountry and. its co&#x27;o­  
nies, and between the one colony and another ; the  
whole being, strictly, in tho na&#x27;ure of a coasting  
trade from one to another port of the saine nation ja  
trade with which no other nation hag a right to in­  
terfere. It follows, of necessity, that the parent  
country, whenever it apens a colonial port for a di­  
rect trade to a foreign country, departs itself, from  
the pringiple of colonial monopoly, and entitles the  
foreign country to the same reciprocity, in eyery re­  
spect as in its intercourse with any other ports of  
the nation.  
  
‘Phis 18 common sense and common right. It ie  
still more, i&#x27;more could be required. Itis in con­  
formity with the established usago of all nations,  
other than Great Britain, which have colomes.—  
Some of those nations are known to adhere to the  
monopoly of their colonial trad:, with all the rigor  
and cohstancy which circamstances permit. But it  
is also known, that, whenever, and from whatever  
cause, it has been found necessary or expedient to  
open their. colonial ports to a foreign trade, the ru&#x27;e  
of reciprocity in favor of the foreign party was not  
refused, nor, is belioved, aright o reluie it pre­  
tended. . !  
  
It cannot be said hat the resiprocity was dictas  
ted by a deliciency of the commercial maring.—  
France, at least, could not be, in every instance, go­  
verned by that consideration-—and Holland, stiil  
less :to say nothing of the navigating States ol Swe­  
den and Denmark, which have rarely, i’ ever, enfor­  
ced a colonial monupoly. &#x27;The remark is, indeed,  
obvious, that the shipping liberated from the ‘usual  
conveyance of suppiies (rom the parent country to  
the colonies mizht be employed in the new channels  
opeuned for them, 1 supplies from abroad.  
Leciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the only  
rule of igterconrse amoag ind.pendent communities;  
and no nation ought to adunt a doctrine or adopt an  
invariable policy, which would preciude the coun­  
teracting measures necessary to enforce the rule.  
2. The Theory suppuscs, moreover, a perpetual  
peace; &amp; supposition, it 18 to be feared, not less chim.-  
erical than a universal ficedoin of commerce.  
  
The effect of war amouny the commercial and man­  
ufacturing nativns of the world, in raising the wages  
of labor, and the cost ol its producis; with a hike ef­  
fect on the chargas of freight and insurance, need  
neither proofnor explanation. In order to deter­  
mine, thereloro, a question of economy, betweusn  
depending on foreign supplics, and encouraging do­  
mestic substitutes, it is necessary to compare the  
probable periods of war with the probavle periods of  
peace; and the cost ol the domestic eacouragem ut  
in times of peace, with the cost added to loreign  
articles i times ol war. &amp;  
  
During the last ceutury, the peciods of war and  
peace have been nearly equal. “Phe effect of a state  
of war in raising the price of inported articles, caus  
nut be estimated with axastoness. I 1s certain, how­  
ever, that the increased price of particular articies  
may make it cheaper (o manulacture them at homa.  
Taking, for the sake ofillustration, an equality in  
the two periods, und the cost ol un imported yard ot  
cloth in time ol war tobe mine and a balt’ dollars,  
and in time of peace to be seven dollurs, whilsl the  
same could at all times be manutaciured at howe for  
cight dotlaes, it 1s evident that « tanff ol oue dollar  
aud a quarter on the imported yard would protect  
the hiome manutacture 1o time of peace, and avorl a  
tag of one dollar and a hail unposed by &amp; state o!  
war.  
  
1L cannot bo said that the manufactories which  
could not support themseives againgt loreign com­  
petition in periods ol peace, would spitug vp ol  
themselves at the recurrence of wae prices. 1t must  
be obvious to eve:y oaa, that, apart trom the dhili­  
cuity of great anl sudden coanges of empluyment, no  
pradout capitalists would cagige 1 expensive es:  
tabiishments of any sort, at the eommaencencnt ol a  
war ol uncertain J’uulion. with a cortanty ol hav­  
ing them crushed by the return of peace.  
  
“I&#x27;he strictest economy herelore suggests, as ex.-  
coptions to the general rule, s estimate, in eyery  
given case, of war and peace periods and prices,  
with inferences therefrom, of the waount of a tarul  
which might be atforded during peace, in order to  
avoid the tax resulting from war. And it willvecar  
at once, that the Inlerences will be strengthened  
by adding, to the supposition of wars wholly loreigu,  
that of wars in wiiich onr own eountry might be &amp;

With all these concessions. i think it

I 1. The Theory of ‘‘Let us alone,” sup­  
I tiiat all nations concur in a perfect  
dom of commercial intercourse. W ere  
i rtjcase, they would, in a commercial  
| i, he but one nation, us much as the  
ml districts composing a particular

bole to the former as to the latter. Gut  
: nor is there a single nation that has  
it the example. No nation can, indeed,  
| !v do so, until a rect irocity, at least,  
sured to it. Take for a proof, the  
i jiar case of the navigation employed  
foreign coi..mor-e. It a nation, a  
•■■t to the rule of never interposing a  
Section oi its vessels, ad*  
ts fore i L.‘i veesels into its ports free ot  
’, whilst its own vessels are subject to  
iduty on foreign ports, the ruinous effect  
i o ob\ ions, that the warmest advocate  
: r the theory in question must shriuk from  
iviirertal application of it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all  
5 s, to regulale itself, might soon find it  
diluted, by other nations, into a sub­  
Erviencv to a foreign interest. In the in­  
between the peace of 1?33 and the  
i Mishment ofthe present Constitution ot  
I * United States, the want of a general  
rily to regulate trade is known to have  
i:s consequence. And have not the  
i i-ions and policy latterly exhibited  
llre.it Britain given warning of a like  
i!t from a renunciation of all counter­  
g regulations on the part of the l ni­  
Wer&lt; she permitted by con­  
no^ on certain portions of her domain  
same of colonics, to open from these a

the use to be made of the monopoly  
not be traced. Its character will be  
d in a just relief, by supposing that

p of Great Britian; or that one of the  
A&gt; in that vicinity should receive the

• with the peculiar privileges claimed  
Colonies. Is it not minutest, that, in  
ise, the favored Island might be  
3 medium of the commercial  
*tourse with foreign nations, and the  
‘t country thence enjoy every essen­  
‘idvantage, as to the terms of it, which  
■ flow from an unrcciprocal trade  
h r other ports, with other nations 1  
nutely, the British claims, how­  
peciouslv colored or adroitly maria­  
•’ vvcre repelled at tlie commencemenl  
*** commercial career us an lndepeu­  
’eopic, and at successive epochs uu­  
? ex &gt;ting Constitution, both in Lc­  
discussions and in diplomatic  
I* &#x27;utioos. The claims were repelled  
- solid ground that the Colonial trade  
a *?£ tfid monopoly, was limited to ihc  
between the pareut country and  
•oiiics, and between one colony and  
the wiio.e being strictly, in th  
coasting trade from one to am&gt;  
I rt ot the same nation; a trade with  
no other cation lias a right to inter­  
h tv.lows of necessity, that the pa  
. ♦ w • ver i-v ens a coloni;  
»r a direct trade to a foreign country.  
!t, from the principle of cdoma  
___  
  
| m uolopy, ami entitles the foreign country  
to the same reciprocity, in every respect.  
! as :i its .-.itercourse v i&#x27;th any otlier ports of  
1 :iie nation*  
This is common sense and common  
. right. It is still more, if more could be  
I required. It is in conformity with the es­  
■ lubhshed usage of all nations, other than  
Groat Britiau, which have colonies. Some  
| ot those nations are known to adhere to the  
| monopoly of their colonial trade, with all  
! the rigor and constancy which ctrcum­  
sbnices permit. But it is also known, that  
whenever, and from w hatever cause, it has  
been found uecessary or expedient to open  
tii&#x27; ir colonial ports to a foreign trade, the  
rule ot reciprocity in favor of the foreign  
j rty was not relused, nor. as is believed,  
a right to refuse it pretended.  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity  
was dictated by a deficiency of the com  
mercial marine. France at least, could  
not be, in every instance, governed by that1  
consideration—mid Holland, still less: to  
say nothing of the navigating States of  
Sweden and Denmark, which have rarely  
it ever, entorced a colonial monopoly,  
file remark is, indeed, obvious, that the  
shipping liberated from the usual convey­  
ance of supplies from the parent country  
to the colonics might be employed in tha  
new channelsopeued for them, in supplies  
from abroad.  
Keciprocity, or an equivalent n»r it, is  
the only rule for intercourse among inde­  
pendent communities; and no nation ought  
to admit a doctrine, or adopt an invariable  
policy, which would preclude the counter  
acting measures necessary to enforee the  
rule.  
&#x27;.i. The Theory supposes, moreover, a  
perpetual peace; a supposition, it is to he  
I feared, not less chimerical than a universal  
freedom of commerce.  
The etfect of war among the comrner­  
icial and manufacturing nations of the  
world, in raising the wages of labor, and  
die costs of its products; with a like effect  
on the charges of freight and insurance,  
need neither proof nor explanation. In or­  
der to determine, therefore, a question of  
I economy, between depending on foreign  
! supplies, ami encouraging domestic sub­  
stitutes, it is necessary to campare the pro­  
bable periods of war with the probable pe­  
riods of peace; and the cost of the domes­  
tic encouragement in times of peace, w ith  
the cost added to foreign articles in times  
  
)i war.  
During the last century, the periods of  
war and peace have been nearly equal.  
I&#x27;he effect o; a state of war in raising the  
price of imported articles, cannot be esti­  
j mated with exactness.—It is certain, how  
u r, that the increased price of particular  
j .rticles may make it cheaper to manufac­  
t ire them at home.  
Taking, for the sake of illustration, an  
equality in the two periods, and the cost oi  
an imported yard of cloth iti the time of  
war to be 89 and 50 cents, and in time of  
peace to be ? dollars, whilst the same  
could at all times be manufactured at home,  
: for 8 dollars, it is evident that a tariff of  
one dollar and a quarter on the imported  
. ird would protect the home manufacture  
m tune of peace, and avoid a tax of one  
dollar and a half imposed by a state of  
war.  
It cannot be said that the manufactories  
which could not support themselves a­  
gaiust foreign competition in periods ol  
peace, would spriug up of themselves at  
the recurrence of war prices. It must be  
obvious to every one, that, apart from the  
difficulty of great and sudden changes of  
employment, no prudent capitalists would  
engage in exoensive establishments of any  
, sou, at the commencement of a war of un­  
; certain duration, with a certainty of hav­  
ing them crushed by the return of peace.  
The strictest economy therefore sug­  
gests, as exceptions to the general rule, an  
estimate, in every given case, of war and  
pence periods and prices, with inferences  
therefrom, of the amount of a tariff which  
might be afforded during peace, m order  
avoid the tux resulting from war. And it  
will occur at once, that the inferences will  
be strengthened by adding to the supposi­  
tion of wars wholly foreign, that of wars in  
which our own country might be a party

of supplies from the pareat country to the  
colomes wmight be employed in the new  
channels opened for them, in supphies from

Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is  
the only rule of intercourse among inde­  
pendent communities; and no mtio:“ih!  
to adimit a doctrine, or adopt an invariible  
policy, which would preclude the coun&#x27;es­

2 The Theory supposes, morcover, a  
perpetual peace; a supposition, it is 1o be  
feared, not less chimerieal than a univer­  
sal freedom of commerce,  
  
The ellect of war among the chbmmer  
cial and manufacturing nations of the  
world, in raising the wages of labor, and  
the cospt of its products; with a Like effect  
on the charges of freight and msurance,  
need neither proof nor explanation. In  
order 1o determine, therefore, a question  
of economy, between depending on foreign  
supphes, and encouraging domestic sub­  
stitutes, it is necessary to compare the  
probable periods of war with the probable  
periods of peace; and the cost of the do­  
mestic encouragement in times of peace,  
with the cost added to foreign articles 1  
timee of war.  
  
During the last century, the periods of  
war and peace have been nearly equal  
The effect of a state of war in raising the  
price of imported articles, cannot be esti­  
mated with exactness, It is certain, how­  
cver, that the increased price of particular  
erticles may make it cheaper to manufac­  
tnre them at home,  
  
Tuking, for the sake of illustration, an  
eqonlity 1 the two periods, and the cost  
of un imported yard of cloth in time of war |  
to be nine and a half dollarg, and in time  
of peace to be seven dollars, whilst the  
same could at all times be manufactored at  
home for eight dollars, it is evident that a |  
taniff of one doltar and a quarter on the |  
hoported yard would protest the lLowe |  
manufacture in time of peace, and avoid o |  
tax of one dollas and a bhait imposed by n‘  
state of war. |  
It&#x27;cannot be said that the manufactories |  
which could nat sapport themselves ngainst ||  
foreign competition in periods of pvm-(e,’  
would spring up of themselves at the re. |  
currence of war prices. It most be obvi- |  
ons to cvery oye, that, apart from the diffi- | !  
eulty of great and sudden changes of em. | !  
ployment, no prudent eapitalists would cn-!  
goge in expensive cstablishments of any l &#x27;  
sort, at the commencement of a war of un­  
certain duration, witlta certainty of having l  
them crushed by the return of pence., !  
The strictest economy therefore sug- | !  
gosts, agexceptions to the general rule, an |  
estimate, in every given case, of war and |  
peace periods and prices, with inferences (  
therefrom, of the amount of a tavifl which | &#x27;  
might be offorded during peace, in order ‘  
to avolrl the tax resulting from war, And l (  
o will cecur at once, l?\!lt the inferences | ¢  
will he strengthened by adding, to the sup. &quot;&#x27;

M nilprlii r, Oct. 33, 1323.  
Dtar Sir: In my lettei ofSeptembei 18th,  
I stated, briefly, the grounds on winch I i  
rested my opinion, that a power to impose  
duties mid restrictions on imports, wdn n  
view to encourage do nestie pnmuciions,  
was constitutionally lodged in Congress. ’  
Ju the observations then made was involved  
the opinion,also, that the power was properly  
there lodged. As tiiis last opinion necessa- j  
rdy implies that there are cases in which  
the power nt ty lie usefully exercised by  
Congress, the only body within our politi­  
cal system capable of exercising it with es-1  
feet, you may think it incumbent on me to  
point out cases of that description.  
I will premise that I concur in the opin-!  
ion, that, Mngsntral rule, individuals ought  
to be deemeii the best judges of the best  
application of their industry and resources.  
1 am ready to admit, also, that there is  
no country in which the application may,  
with more safety, lie left to the intelligence  
and enterprise of individuals, than the Uni­  
ted States.  
Finally, I shall not deny, that, in all I  
doulitlul cases, it becomes every Govern- j  
meat to lean rather to a confidence in the  
judgment of individuals, than to interposi­  
tions controlling the free exercise of it.  
With all these concessions. I think it can  
be satisfactorily shown that there are excep­  
tions to the general rule, now expressed by  
the phrase “Let ns alone,” forming eases  
which cull for interpositions of the compe­  
tent authority, and which are not inconsis­  
tent with the generality of the rule.  
1. The Theory of &quot;Let us alone,” sup­  
poses that all nations concur in n perfect  
freedom of eommetciid intercourse. Were  
this the case, they would, in a commercial  
view, be but one nation, ns rniicli as the  
several disliiets composing n pariicnhir na­  
tion; and the theory wmd I he as npplicu-  
Ide tn ttie former as to the latter. But this  
golden age of free trade has not yet arriv­  
ed : nor is there a single nation that has net  
the example. No nation can, indeed, safe-  
  
l ly do so. until a reciprocity, at least, be en­  
i sored to it. Take, fora proof, the familiar  
j case of the navigation employed in a for­  
( pign commerce. It a nation adheiing to  
I the rule of never interposing a coumervail­  
( ing p oteetion of its vessels, admits foreign  
vessels into its ports free of duty, whilst its  
1 own vessels are subject to a duty in for-  
I cign ports, the ruinous effect is so obvious,  
that the warmest advocate for the theory in  
question must shrink from a universal appli­  
cation of it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all  
cases, to regulate itself, might soon find it  
regulated, by other nations, into a subser­  
viency to a foieign interest. In the inter­  
val between the peace of 1783 an I the es­  
tai pshment of (he present C&lt; nstitution of  
tiie United States, the want of a general  
  
; authoiity to regulate trade is known to have  
had Ibis consequence. And have not the  
i pretensions and policy latterly exhibited by  
। Great Britain given warning of a like result  
I from a renunciation of all countervailing re­  
! gelations on the part of the United States?  
, Were she permitted, by conferring oir cer­  
i tain portions of her domain the name of  
I Colonies, to open from these a trade foi her-  
I self, to foreign countries, and to exclude, at  
the same time, a reciprocal trade to such  
| Colonies, by foreign countries, the use to be  
| made of the monopoly need not be traced.  
Its character will lie placed in a just relief,  
by supposing that one of the Colonial Isl­  
[ auds, instead of its present distance, happen­  
&#x27; ed to be in the vicinity of Great Britain ; or  
that one of these Islands in that vicinity  
should receive the name and bo regarded  
in the light of a Colony, with the peculiar  
privileges claimed for Colonies. Is it not  
; manifest, that, in this case, the favored Isl­  
and might be made the sole medium of the  
commercial intercourse with foreign na­  
tions, and the parent country thence enjoy  
every essential advantage, as to the terms  
of it. which flow from an unreciprocal trade  
from her other ports, with other nations?  
Fortunately, the British claims, however  
speciously colored or adroitly managed,  
were repelled nt the t ommem ement of our  
, commercial career as an Independent Peo­  
’ pie, and at successive epochs under the ex­  
isting Constitution, Imth in legislative dis­  
cussions an I in dipiom die negotiations.  
The claims were repelled on the solid  
ground that the Colonial trade, ns a right­  
ful monopoly, was limited to the intercourse  
between the parent country and its colonies,  
and between one colony mi l another; the  
whole being, strictly, in the nature of a  
coasting trade from one to another port of  
the same nation ; a trade with which no  
other nation has a right to interfere. It  
follows, of necessity, t. at the parent coun­  
try, whenever it opens a colonial port for a  
direct trade tn a foreign country, departs,  
itself, from the principle of c&lt;Jvni»l monopo­  
ly, and entitles the foreign country to the  
same reciprocity, in every respect, as in its  
intercourse with any ports of the nation.  
This is common sense and common right.  
It is still mote, if more co&#x27;d.l be required.  
It is in conformity with the established  
। usage of all n itions, Other t h in Great Brit­  
ain, which have colonies. Some of those  
nations are known to adhere to the monopo­  
ly of their colonial trade, with all the rigor  
and constancy which circumstances permit.  
But it is also known, that, whenevei, and  
from whatever cause, it has been found ne­  
cessary or expedient to open their colonial  
ports to a foreign trade, the tide of recipro­  
city in favor of the foreign party was not  
refused, nor, as is believed, a tight to refuse  
। if pretended.  
It cannot be said tiiat the reciprocity was  
dictated bv a deficiency of the commercial  
; marine. France, at least, could not lie, in  
I every instance, governed by that considera­  
tion—and Holland, still less: to say noth­  
ing of the navigating Stales of Denuiaik  
। and Sweden, which have rarely, if ever,  
| enforced a colonial monopoly. The remark  
| is. indeed, obvious, that the shipping liber­  
ated fiom the usual conveyance of supplies  
from the parent country to the colonies  
might be employed in Ine new channels  
i opened for them, in supplies from abroad.  
  
Rei iproi ity, or tin equivulenl tor it. is the  
only rule of intercourse mining independ­  
ent cmnmunites ; and no nation ought to  
admit a dm trine, or adopt an invariable pol­  
icy, which woulil preclude the eounten.ct­  
ing measures necessary to enfotce the rule.  
2. The &#x27;Theory supposes, moreovt r, a  
perpetual peace ; a supposition, it is to be  
seated, not less cliimericid tnan a uinvuraal  
freedom of coniineice.  
Thfe effect of war among the commercial  
an l manufacturing nations of the woil , in  
raising the wages of lulior, ami the cost of  
its pro hicls; with a like ett&#x27;wet on the  
charges of freight nnd insurance, need  
neither proof nor explanation. In order to  
determine, therefore, a questi n of economy,  
between depending on foreign supplies, and  
encouraging domestic substitutes, it is ne­  
i cessary to compare the probable periods of  
war with the probable periods of peace;  
and the cost of domestic encouragement in  
times of peace, with the cots added to for­  
eign articles in times of war.  
  
During the last century, the periods of,  
wat, and peace have been neatly equal.— |  
The effect of a state of war in laising the j  
price.of iuqtorted articles, cannot be esti-,  
5 mated with exactness. It is certain, howid  
I ever, that the increased pi ice of particular -  
, articles may make it cheaper to m.muluc- ■  
| tore them at home.  
■ Taking, for the sake of illustration, an  
! equality in the two periods, and the cost of  
j an imported yard of cloth in lime of war to  
! he nine ami a half dollars, and in the time j  
; of peace to be seven dollars, whilst the same  
j could at all times be maniifuctured al home &#x27;  
I for eight dollars, it is evident that n tardf  
of one dollar and a quarter on Ilie nnpoited  
yard would protect the home tn inuhiciure  
m time of peace, and avoid a tax (done dol­  
lar and a half imposed by a state of war.  
It cannot he said that the manufactories ;  
which could not support themselves against  
foreign competition nt pet iods of peine, would I  
spring up of themselves at the recurrence  
of war prices. It must be obvious to every I  
one, that, apart tiom the diiiicuhy of great  
and sudden changes of employment, no pru­  
dent capitalists would engage in expensive  
establishments of any suit, at the com

Montpelier,Oct. 30,1828.  
Dear Sir: In my letter ®f September  
19th, I stated, briefly, the grounds on  
which I rested my opinion, that a power  
to impose duties and restrictions on im­  
ports, with a view to encourage domes­  
tic productions, was constitutionally  
lodged in congress. In the observations  
then made was involved the opinion, al­  
so, that the power was properly there  
lodged. As the last opinion necessari­  
ly implies that there are cases in which  
the power may be usefully exercised by  
congress, the only body within our po­  
litical srtem capable of exercising it  
with effect, you may think it incumbent  
on me to point out the cases of that de  
scription.  
I will premise that I concur in the o­  
pinion, that as a general rule, individu­  
als ought to be d eemed the best judges  
ol the best application of their industry  
and resources­  
I am reedy to admit, also, that there  
is no country in which the application  
o. Av, with more safety, he left to the in  
teliigenee and en&#x27;.erpiise of individuals,  
than the United Stale*.  
Finally, I shall not deny, that in all  
doubtful cases, it becomes evtrv gov­  
ernment to lean rather to confidence in  
the judgment of individuals, than to in­  
; terposifions controlling the free exer­  
| r.ise of it  
With all these concessions, I think it  
j c*n be satisfactory shown, that there  
! are exceptions to the general rule, now  
expressed by the phrase “Let us alone.”  
foiming cases which call for interposi­  
tions of the competent authority, and  
which are not inconsistent with the gene  
rality of the rule  
S The theory of &quot;Let vs alone” sup­  
poses that ail nations concur in a per­  
fect free.* &gt;m of commercial intercourse.  
Were this the case, they would, in a  
commercial view, be hut one nation, as  
much as tiie se veral districts composing  
a particular nation; and the theory ,  
would bo as applicable to the former ns  
to the latter. Hut this golden age of  
free trade lots not yet arrived: nor is  
there a single nation that has set the  
example- No nation can, indeed, safe  
ly do so. until a reciprocity, at least, be  
ensured to it. Take, for a proof, the fa­  
miliar case of the navigation employed  
in a foreign commerce If a nation,  
adhering to (he rule of never interpos-]  
ing a countervailing protection of its;  
vessels, admits foreign vessels into its1  
ports free of d ity, whilst its own vessels  
are subject to a duty in foreign ports,  
the ruinous effect is sc obvious 1 hat the  
warmest advocate for the tiifory ir  
question must shrink from a -uwoertel  
application of it  
A nation having its foreign trade, in  
all cases, to regulate itself, might soon  
find it regulated by other nations into a  
subserviency to a foreign interest, in  
the interval between the poare of 17£3  
and the establishment of the present  
constitution of (tie United stales** the  
want of-a general authority to regulate  
trade is known to have had this conse­  
quence- And have not the pretensions  
and policy latterly exhibited by &quot;Great  
Britain-giving warniog-of a like result  
from a renunciation of all countervail  
ing regulation on the part of the United  
States. Were she permitted, by con­  
fer ring on certain portions of her do­  
main the name of colonies to open from  
these a trade to herself, to foreign court­  
I tries, and to exclude, at the same time,  
n reciprocal trade to such colonies by  
foreign countries, the use to be made  
| of the monopoly need not to be traced,  
i Its character will be placed in a just re­  
i lief, by supposing that one of the islands  
| in that vicinity should receive the name  
| and be regarded in the light of a colony,  
! with the peculiar privileges claimed for  
i colonies. Is it not manifest, that in this  
.case, the favored islund might be made  
! the sole medium of the commercial in­  
I tercourse with foreign nations, and the  
parent country thenee enjoy every es­  
sential advantage, as to the terms of it,  
■ which would flow from an unreciproeal  
trade from her other ports, with other  
I nations?  
Fortunately the British claims, how.  
ever speciously colored or adroitly ma­  
naged, were repelled at the commence­  
ment of our commercial career as an  
independent people, and at the succes­  
i sive epochs under the existing constitu­  
tion, both in legislative discussions and  
in diplomatic negr tiatior.s. The claims  
were repelled on the solid ground that  
the colonial trade as a righifui mo­  
nopoly, was limited to the intercourse  
between the parent eountiy and its co­  
lonies, and between one colony and an  
other, the whole being strictly, in the  
nature of a coasting trade from one to  
anotberofthe same nation; a trade with  
which no other nation has a right to in­  
terfere. It follows of necessity, that  
the parent country, whenever it opens a  
colonial trade t® « foreign country, de­  
parts, itself, from the principle of colo­  
nial monopoly, and entitles the fo  
reign country T® the same reciprocity,  
in every respect, as in its intercourse  
i with any other ports of the nation.  
This is common sense and common  
right. It is still more, if more could be  
required. It is in conformity with the  
established usage of all nations, other  
I than Great Britain, which have colonies­  
  
Some of those nal.ons ave k»oWn to ad.  
here to the monody ot their colonial  
trade with all the rigor a.d con.,a™*  
which circumstauces permit But it  
also known that whenever and from  
whatever cause, it has been found ne  
cessary or expedient to open their co-’  
1 lonial ports to a foreign trade, the rule  
of reciprocity in favor of the foreign  
party, was not refused, nor, as believed  
a right to refuse it pretended. *  
It cannot be said that tbe reciprocity  
was dictated by a deficiency ot the  
commercial marine France, at least  
could not be, in every instaoce govern-*  
ed by that consideration—and Holland  
still less: to say nothing of the naviga­  
ting states of Sweeden and Denmark  
which have rarely, if ever, enforced a  
colonial monopoly. The remark is  
indeed, obvious, that the supplies from  
the parent country to the colonies might  
be employed in the new channels open­  
ed for them, in supplies from abroad.  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for ihia  
| the only rule of our intercourse among  
| independent communities; and no na­  
! &lt;&#x27;°n ought *n adn it a doctrine, or adopt  
! r.u invariable policy, whirh would pre­  
clude the counteracting measures ne­  
cessary to enforce the rule.  
2. Tfo- theory supposes moreover, a  
perpetual peace; a supposition, it is to  
be feared, not less chimerical than a u­  
niversal freedom of commerce.  
The effect of war among thy com­  
mercial a ml manufacturing nations of  
the world, in raising tbe wages oflabour,  
and the cost of its products; with a lika  
effort on the charges of freight and in­  
surance, needs neither proof nor expla­  
nation. In order to determine, therefore,  
a question of economy, between de­  
pending on foreign supplies and encou.  
raging domestic substitutes, it is neces­  
sary to compare the probable periods of  
peace; and the cost added to foreign  
arficlesin times of war.  
During the last century, the periods  
of war and peace ave been nearly e­  
Tjiial. The effort of a state of war ia  
raising the price of imported article*  
cannot be estimated with exactness—  
il is certain, however, that the increased  
price of particular »itides may make  
it cheaper to manufacture them at  
home.  
Taking, for tbe sake of illustration,  
an equably in the periods, and the cost  
of an imported yard of rlolb in time of  
war to be nine end a half dollars, and in  
time of peace to he seven dollars, w hilst  
the same couM at all times be manufac­  
tured at home for eight dollars, it is evi­  
dent that a tariff of one dollar Sraquav­  
ter on the imported yard would &#x27;protect  
the home manufecture in&#x27;time of pt3ce.  
and * void a tax of one dollar and adio.lf  
imposed by ? state of war.  
It cannot be1 cv;id that’the’ftvarivifacto.  
ries which ccdtl not snpport thevnielvea  
against foreign competition ■ in ‘periods  
of peK.ee, would spring up of themselves  
at the recurrence of war prices It  
must be obvious to*every one, that, a­  
part from &#x27;the difficulty of great and  
sudden changes of employment, no pru.  
dent capitalists would engage in expen­  
sive establishments of any sort, at the  
commencement of a war of uncertain  
duration, with e certainty of having  
them crushed by the return of peace.  
&#x27;Hie strictest economy therefore sug­  
gests as exceptions to tbs general rule,  
an estimate* ia every given case, of war  
and peace, periods and prices with infer­  
ences therefrom, of the amount of a  
tariff which might be afforded during  
peace in order to avoid the tax result­  
ing from war. A nd it wiil occcur at once,  
that the infetence will he strength*d by  
adding to supposition of wars wholly  
foreign, that of wars in which our owe

Montpelier, October 20, 1828.  
Dear Sir: In my letter of September 18th, 1  
stated, briefly, the grounds on which L rested my  
opinion, that a power to impose duties and restric­  
tions on imports, with a view to encourage domes­  
tic productions, was constitutionally lodged in Con­  
gress. In the observations then made was involved  
the opinion, also, that the power was properly there  
lodged. As this last opinion necessarily implies that  
there are cases in which &#x27;he power may be usefully  
exercised by Congress, the only body within our po­  
litical system capable of exercising it with effect,  
you may think it incumbent on me to point out cases  
of that description.  
1 will premise that 1 concur in the opinion, that,  
as a general rule, individuals ought to be deemed  
the best judges of the best application of their in­  
dustry and resources.  
a  
, - , , . , , . . .  
1 am ready to admit, also, that there is no conn ry ^  
m which the application may, with moresafety,  
be left to tbe intelligence and enteipnse ol individ- p  
uals, than the United States.  
Finally, 1 slfcll notdeny, that, in all doubtful ca- j  
ses, it becomes every Government to lean rather to t  
a confidence in the judgement of individuals than  
to interpositions controlling the free exercise ot it. p  
VVitli all these concessions, I think it can lie sat- u  
isfactorily shown, that there are exceptions to the  
general rule, now expressed by the phrase &quot; Let us  
alone,&quot; forming cases which call for interpositions  
of the competent authority, and which are not incon- |  
sistenc with the generality of the rule.  
I. The Theory of &quot; Let us alone&quot; supposes that j  
all nations concur in a perfect freedom ot coinmer­  
cial intercourse. Were this the case, they would,  
in a commercial view, be but one nation, as much  
as the several districts composing a particular na­  
tion ; and the theory would be as applicable to the l  
iormer as to the latter. But this golden age of free  
trade has not yet arrived ; nor is there a single na­  
tion that lias set the example. No nation can, in­  
deed, safely do so, until, a reciprocity, at least, be  
ensured to it. Take, for a proof, the familiar case  
of the navigation employed in a foreign commerce,  
If a nation, adhering to the rule of never iuterpos­  
ing a countervailing protection of its vessels, admits  
forcign vessels into its port3 free uf duty, whilst its  
own vessels are subject to a duty in foreign ports,  
thc rumous effect is so obvious, that the warmest ad­  
vacate for the theory in question must shrink from  
a universal application of it.  
• Anation leaving its foreign trade, in all cases, to  
reoulate itself, might soon find it regulated, by other  
nations, into a subserviency ton foreign interest,  
In the interval between the peace of 1733 and the  
establishment of the present Constitution of the U.  
States the want of a general authority to regulate  
trade is known to have had this consequence. And  
have not the pretensions and policy latterly exhibi­  
ted bv Great Britain given warning of a like result  
from a renunciation of all countervailing regulations  
on the part of the United States ? Were she per­  
„fitted, by conferring on certain portions of her do­  
mam the name of Colonies, to open from these a  
trade for herself, to foreign countries, and to exclude,  
at the same time, a reciprocal tr ide to such Colonies,  
by foreign countries, the use to bo made of the mon­  
«pot v need not be traced. Its character will be  
placed in a just relief, by supposing that one of the  
Colonial Islands, instead of its present dis&#x27;ance,  
happened to be in the vicinity of Great Britain ; or  
that one of the Islands in that vicinity should re- j  
ceive the name and be regarded in the light of a  
Colonv, with the peculiar privileges claimed for  
C,domes. Is it not manifest, that, in this case, tne  
favored Island might be made the sole medium ol  
the commercial intercourse with foreigu nations, and  
the parent country thence enjoy every essential ad­  
vantage, as to the terms of it, which would flow  
from an unreciprocal trade from her other ports, with  
other nations ?  
Fortunately, the British claims, howeverspecious­  
|y colored or adroitly managed, were repelled at  
the commencement of our commercial career as an  
Independent People, and at successive epochs un­  
der the existing Constitution, both in legislative dis­  
cussions and in diplomatic négociations. The claims  
were repelled on the solid ground that the Colonial  
trade, as a rightful monopoly, was limited to the in­  
tercourse between the parent country and its colon­  
ies, and between one colony and another ; the whole  
being, strictly, in the nature of a coasting trade Irom  
.... j to another port of the same nation ; a trade  
with which no other nation has a right to interfere.  
It follows, of necessity, that the parent country,  
whenever it opens a colonial port lor a direct trade  
to a foreign country, departs, itself, from the prin­  
iple uf colonial monopoly, and entitles the foreign  
country to the same reciprocity, in every respect, as  
in its intercourse with any other ports ot the nation.  
This is common sense and common right. It is  
still more, if more could be required. It is in con­  
formity with the established usage of all nations,  
other than Great Britain, which have colonies.  
Some of those nations are known to adhere to the  
monopoly of their colonial trade, with all the rigor  
and constancy which circumstances permit. But it  
is also known, that, whenever, and from whatever  
cause, it has been tound necessary or expedient to  
open their colonial ports to a foreign trade, the rule  
j of reciprocity in favor of die foreign party was not  
refused, nor, as is believed, a right to refuse it pie  
tended. ,  
1 It cannot be said that the reciprocity was dictated  
one  
ci  
  
by a deficiency of tlie commercial marine. France»  
at leSSt, toolil not be, in every instance, governed  
by that consideration—and Holland, still less; tu  
say nothing of the navigating States of Sweden and  
Denmark, which have rarely, il&#x27;ever, enforced a co­  
lonial monopoly. The remark is, indeed, obvious,  
that the shipping liberated from the usual convey­  
ance of supplies from the parent country to the col­  
onies might be employed in the new channels open­  
ed for them, in supplies from abroad.  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the only  
rule of intercourse among independent communi­  
ties ; and no nation ought to admit a doctriue, or  
adopt an invariable policy, which would preclude  
the counteracting measures necessary to enforce the  
rule.  
2. The Theory supposes, moreover, a perpetual  
peace ; a supposition, it is to be feared, not less  
chimerical than a universal freedom of commerce.  
The effect of war among the commercial and  
manufacturing nations ot the world, in raising the  
waves of labor, and the cost of its products ; with  
a like client on the charges of freight and insurance,  
need neither proof nur explanation. In order lo de­  
termine, therefore, a question of economy, between  
depending on foreign supplies.and eticouiaging do­  
me r slic sl f bsti t u te8, it is nece ssary to compare the  
p t .«|} a 5| e periods of war with the probable periods of  
peace ; and the cust of the demesne encouragement  
j 0 times of peace, with the cost added tu foreign ar­  
t j c i es t ;„ ies u f war­  
During the last century the periods of war and  
p Cace | la v e been nearly equal. The eftect of a stäte  
u p war) ln ra j s j n g U 10 price of imported articles, can­  
nut b e estimated with exactness. It is certain,  
however, that the increased price of particular ar­  
viclta may make it cheaper to manufacture them at  
| ll))ne&gt;  
Taking, for the sake of illustration, an equality  
j n th e two periods, and the cost of an imported  
val ( j of doth in time of war to be nine and a half  
dollars, and in time of peace to be seven, whilst the  
sa me could at all times ue manufactured at home  
for eight dollars, it is evident that a tariff of one dol­  
l ar and a quarteron the imported yard would pre­  
tect the home manufacture in time of pence, and  
avoid a tax of one dollar and a hall imposed by estate  
of war.  
It cannot bs said that the manufactories which  
could not support themselves against foreign com­  
petition in periods of peace, would spring up of  
themselves at the recurrence of war prices. It must  
be obvious to every one, that, apart from the difficul­  
ty of great and sudden changes of employment, no  
prudent capitalists would engage in expensive es­  
tablishments of any sort, at the commencement of a  
war of uncertain duration, with a certainty ofhav­  
ing them crushed by toe return of peace.  
The strictest economy therefore suggests, as ej­  
copiions to the general rule, an estimate, in every  
given case, of war and peace periods and prices, with  
inferences therefrom, ol the amount ol a tariff which  
might be afforded during peace, in order to avoid the  
tax resulting from war. And it will occur at once,  
that the inferences will be strengthened by adding,  
to the supposition of wars .wholly foreign, that of  
wars in which our own country might be a party

Moxreerier. Oct. 30, 1823.  
Dear Sir,~Ja wy letter of Sept. 13th, 1 stat­  
ed, briefly, the grounds on which I rested my  
opinion, that a power to hmpose duties and re­  
strictions on imports, with a view to encourage  
domestic productions, was consiituiionally lodg­  
od ia Congress. Inthe observations theh made  
wag involved the opinion, also, that the power  
was probably there lodged. Asthislast opinion  
necessarily imiplies that there are cases in which  
the powerinay Lo usefully exercised by Con­  
gress, the ouly bedy within our political ‘system  
capabletof exercising it with effect, you may  
think it incumbent on iae &lt;o point out cascs of  
that description.  
I wil preinize that I coneur in the opinion,  
that, as o general rule, individuals ought to be  
deemed the best judges of the best application of  
their industry and resources.  
I am ready to ad:nit, also, that there is no coun­  
try in whica the application may, with more  
safety, be left to the int»lligence and enterprise  
of individuals, than the United States. .  
Finally, [ shall not deny, that, in all doubtful  
cases, it becomes every Government to leun  
rather to a confidence in the judginent of indi­  
viduals, than to interpositions controlling the free  
exercise of it. ]  
With all these concessions, I think it can be  
satisfactorily shown, that there are exceptions to  
the genoral rule, now expressed by the phrase  
“Let us alone,” forming cases which call for  
interpositions of the compotent authority, and  
which are not inconsistent. with the generality,  
of the rule. ,  
  
I. The Theory of “Let us alone’” supposes  
that all nations concurin a perfect freedom of  
commercial intercourse. Were this the case,  
they would, in a commercial view, be but one  
nation, as much as the several districts composing  
a particular nation ; and the theory would be as  
ap{s‘aicable to the former as to the latter. But this  
golden age of {ree trade has not yet arrived ; nor  
18 there a single nation that has set the examp&#x27;e.  
No nation can, indeed safely do so, until a reci­  
procity, at least, he ensured to it. Take, for a  
proof, the familiar case of the navigation employ­  
ed in a foreign commeree. Isa nation, adhering  
to the rule of never interposing a countervailing  
protection of its vessels, admits foreign vessels  
into its ports free of duty, whilst its own vessels  
are subject to a-duty in foreign ports, the ruinous  
effoctis so obvious, that the warmest advocate  
for the theory in question must shrink from a  
universal application es it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all cases,  
to regulate itself, might soon find it regulated, by  
other nations, into a subserviency toa foreign  
interest. In the interval between the peace of  
1733 and the establishment of the present Con­  
stitution of tho United States, the want ofa gen­  
eral authority to regulate trade is known to have  
had this censequencé. And have not the preten­  
sions and policy latterly exhibited by Great-  
Britain given warning of&#x27; a -like result from a  
renunciation of all countervailing regulations on  
the part of the U. States ? Were she permiited,  
by conferring on certain portions of her domain  
the name of Colonies, to open from these a trade  
for herself, to foreign countries, and to exclude  
at the same time, a reciproeal trade to such Col­  
onies, by forcign countries, the use to be made  
of the monopoly need not be traced. Its charac­  
ter will be placed in a just relief, by suppesing  
that one of the Colonial Islands, instead of its  
present distance, happened to be in the vicinity  
of Great-Britain ;or that one of the Islands in  
that vicinity should receive the name and be  
regarded in the lig‘ht of a Colony, with the pe­  
cnﬁiar privileges claimed for Colonies. Is it net  
manifest, that, in this case, the favored Island  
might be made the sole mediuwn of the commercial  
intercourse with foregin nations,and the parent  
country thence enjoy every essential advantage,  
as to the terms of it which would flow from an  
unreciprocal trade fiom her other ports, with oth­  
~ er nations ?  
Fortunately, the British claims however spe­  
} ciously colored or adroitly managed, were  
repelled at the commencement of our cemmer­  
cial career as an Independent People, and at sue­  
cessiva epochs under the existing Constitution,  
  
both iwrlagislative discussions and in diptimatia  
negotiatisns. Thie claiins wore repelled on - 4  
solid ground that the Colonial trade, asa r7v -  
monopoly, was limited to the intarconra. ..  
tween the parentcountiry and its calonies, and u.  
tween one colony and ansther ; tha wile . e  
strietly, in the nature ofa constin a irade G-y  
one to another port of the sane aation ;4 111 y  
with which no other nation has g right t~ 5.

country, whenever it opens a eolupial port far 4

froin the principle of colonini m mepoly, and o  
titles the forcign country toths smine recine o :  
in every respect, as in i&#x27;s intercourse wiih o -  
other ports of the nation.  
This is common sense and esm pon right .-  
It is stili more 1f more could be required. It 4

nations, other than Great-Britain. which hov.  
colonies. Some of those nations ars known T 3  
adhere to the monopoly of their colonial trade,  
with all the rigor and constancy whieh circum­  
stances perm:it. But it is also known. Lisnt,  
whenever, and from whatever canse, it has bean  
found necessary or expedicat io open their  
colonial ports toa i&#x27;-.)rei{gn trade . the rule of rzei­  
procity in favor of the forowen party was not re­  
fused. nor, as is believed, a rightto refuse it  
pretended.  
It cannot be said that the rociprocity was dic­  
tated by a deficieucy of the commeraial wmoar ne.  
Franee, at least, could not be in every irsianco,  
governed by that consideration—ans Holisnd,  
still less : to say nothing of the nuvigating Siates  
of Sweden and Dentnark, which hava rarely, if  
ever, enforced a colonial monopoly. The remrk  
is, indeed, obvious, that the shippine liberated  
from the usnal conveyance of supplies from tiae  
parent ceuntry to the colonies might be employ­  
ed in the new channels opened for them, in  
supplies from abroaa.  
Reciprocity, or an equiva&#x27;ant for it, is the only  
rule of intercourse amnong independent eommuniz  
ties ; and no nation ought to ad.ait a doetrine, or  
adopt an invariable policy, which would preclude  
the counteracting measures necessary to enforce  
toe rule.  
  
- 2. The Theory sapposes, moresver, a por­  
petual peace ; a suppnsition. it is to he fearad,  
not less chimerical thana universal freedom of  
gomumerce,  
The effect of war among the conmercial and  
-manutacturiaz nations of the wou!d, in risine  
the wagas of libor, and the cost of its prnductso;  
with a lite affect on the charges of straight  
and insurance, need neither prosi” nor exslina­  
tion. In order to determine, therefore, a ques­  
tion of econamy, between depending on foreion  
supplies, and encoaraging domestic substimtgs,  
it 1s necessary Lo compare the probable pericds  
of war with the probable periods of peace ; and  
the cost of the dowmestic encouragewnlcut in thnen  
of peace, with the cost added to toreign articles  
in times of war.  
During the last century. the neri~ds of war  
and pgace have been nearly equal The ofact  
of a state of war in rasing Lhe ;‘:r ce of inno ried  
i}rticles, cannaot be estimated with exneti . g —  
It‘is certain, however, that the increas=d uiice  
of particular articles. may snake it cheascr to  
manufacture them at homne  
~ Taking for the sake of illustration, an enquaiity  
In the two periods, and the cost of an imnortad  
yard of elothin timie of war te be nine =nd a  
half dotlars. and in time of pence 10 be sever dol­  
lars, whilst the same could’ai all tines be I.an­  
afactured at howme for eioht dollars it is -v­  
--ident that a tariff of dollar and a ganrter o he  
uaparted yard, would protect the home mana­  
facture in timna of poace, and awveda x - g  
dollar and a hali imposed Ly 2 state ~F wa; ;  
[t cannot be said that the manuf otories whirh  
could not support themselves agriust Drop  
competition in periods ~f peace, would spring ap  
of themscives at the recurrense 7 war srinns.  
It must be obvicus to every ne, that. =partfram  
the dificulty of great and sudden exanges of  
employment, no prudent ecapitalisis would  
engaze In expensive estanlishmenis of any sort,  
at the commencement of a war of nnceriain  
duration, with a certainty of having them  
crushed by the return »f peaco’

es that all nations concur in a perfect freedom  
of commercial intercourse. Were this the

for herself, to foreign countries, and to ex­  
clude at the same time, a reciprocal trade to  
such colonics, by foreign countries, the use  
to be made of the monopoly need not be tra­  
ced. Its character will be placed in a just  
relief, by supposing that one of the colonial  
islands, instead of its present distance, hap­  
pened to be in the vicinity of Great Britain ;  
or that one of the islands in that vicinity,  
should receive the name and he regarded in  
the light of a colony with the peculiar privil­  
eges claimed for colonies. Is it not manifest,  
that, in this case, the favored island might be  
made the sole medium of the commercial in­  
tercourse with foreign nations,and the parent  
country thence enjoy every essential advan­  
tage, as to the terms of it, which would flow  
from an unreciprocal trade from her other  
ports, with other nations ?  
  
i Fortunately, me uriusn claims, however  
speciously colored or adroitly managed, were  
repelled at the commencement of our com­  
mercial career as an independent people, and  
at successive epochs under the existing con­  
stitution, in legislative discussions and in di­  
plomatic negotiations. The claims were re­  
pelled on the solid ground that the colonial  
trade, as a rightful monopoly, was limited to  
the intercourse between the parent country  
lind its colo lies, and between one colony and  
, another; the whole being, strictly in the na­  
ture of a coasting trade from one to another  
port of the same nation; a trade with which  
no other nation has a right to interfere. It  
follows of necessity, that the parent country,  
whenever it opens a colonial port for a direct  
trade to a foreign country, departs, itself,from  
the principle of colonial monopoly, and enti­  
tles the foreign country to the same recipro­  
city, in every respect, as in its intercourse  
with any other ports of the nution.  
This is common sense and common right.  
It is still more, if more could be required. It  
is in conformity with the established usage  
of all nations, other than Great Britain.which  
has colonies. Some of those nations are  
known to adhere to the monopoly of their  
colonial trade, with all their rigour and  
constancy which its circumstances permit.—  
But it is also known, that whenever, &amp; from  
whatever cause, it has been found necessary  
or expedient to open their colonial ports to a  
foreign trade, the rule of reciprocity in favor  
of the foreign party, was not refused, nor is it  
Ivctieved, a right to refuse it pretended.  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity was  
dictated by a deficiency of the commercial  
marine. Franee, at least,could not be, in ev -  
ery instance, governed by that consideration;  
and Holland, stilt le18 ; t0 8ay nothing of the  
navigation states of£wedeil Hl)d Denmark,  
which have rarely, if ev^.enforced a colonial  
monopoly, fhe remark is. i„d^.d( Obvious,  
that the shipping liberated fro,. ttu. u#ua| con;  
veyance of supplies from the pa,*,* country  
to the colonies,might be employed the new  
channels opened for them in supplies from u­  
broad.  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is j,e  
only rule of intercourse among independent  
communities ; and no nation ought to admit  
a doctrine, or adopt an invariable policy,  
which would preclude the counteracting  
measures m-ci -sary to enforce the rule.  
2. Tin tin ry supposes, moreover, a per­  
petual peace; .« -upposi’.ion. it is to be feared  
not less chimerical than a univcsal freedom of  
eopimerce.  
The effect of war among the commercial  
iff  
  
ami manuiat&#x27;iurtng iwImmm of the world, ini  
the wage* of labour, and tba coat of it*&#x27;  
1 product*; with a like effect on the charge* of  
1 freight ami insurance, need neither proof nor!  
ex plan.-i lion. In order to determine therefore j  
a question of economy, between depending  
, nn foreign supplies and encouraging domestic  
; soh**»tuc*, it is necessary to compare the pro­  
bable periods of war with the probable peri­  
od* of peace; and the cost of domestirk eu­  
I couragement in times of peace, with .he cost  
added to foreign articles in times of war.—  
I During the I,tat century, the periods of war &amp;.  
peace have been nearly equal. The effect of  
j a stale of war in raising the price ol imported  
articles, cannot be estimated with exactness.  
It isccrtain, however, that the increased price  
of particular articles may make it cheaper to  
t manufacture them at home.  
Taking,for the sake of illus&#x27;ration.an eqtial­  
1 ity in the two periods, and the eost of an im­  
ported yard of cloth in time of war to nine  
I and a half dollars, and in time ol peace to he  
| seven dollars, whilst the same could he man­  
i ul&#x27;arttired at home for eight dollars, it is evid­  
| cut that a taiiiT of one dollar and a quarter on  
| the imported yard would protect the home  
manufacture in time of peace.and avoid a tax  
of one dollar and a half impulsed by a state of  
war.  
It cannot be said that the manufactories  
which could support themselves against for­  
eign competition in periods of peace, would  
spring up ot themselves at the recurrence of  
war prices. It must I e obvious to ev« ry one,  
that,apart from the difficulty of great and sud­  
1 den changes of employment, no prudent cap­  
j italists would engage in expensive estahlish­  
j incuts of any sort, at the commencement of a  
I war of uncertain duration, with a certainty of  
having them crushed by the return of peace.  
The strictesteconomy therefore suggests,as  
exceptions to the general rule, an estimate.in  
every given case of war and peace periods and  
prices, with inferences therefrom, of the am­  
ount of the tariff which might be afforded du­  
ring peace, in order to avoid the tax resulting  
from war. And it will occur at once, that  
the inferences will be strengthened by adding  
to the supposition of wars wholly foreign,  
that of wars in which our country might be. a  
party

Montpelier, October 30,185.8.  
Dear Sir :—ln my letter of September  
18th, I stated, briefly, the grounds on which  
I rest my opinion, that a power to impose  
duties and restictions on imports with a view  
to encourage domestick productions, was  
constitutionally lodged in Congress. In the  
observations then made was involved the  
opinion, also, that the power was properly  
there lodged. As this last opinion necessa­  
rily implies that there are cases in which the  
power may be usefully exercised by Congess,  
the only body within our political system  
capable of exercising it with effect, you may  
think it incumbent on pie to point oift cases  
of that description.  
1 Will prfcltllst- lhttt: Twncnria the epm wm,  
that as a general rule, individuals ought to  
be deemed the best judges of the applica­  
tion of their industry and resources.  
I am ready to admit, also, that there is no  
country in which the application may, with  
more safety, be left to the intelligence and  
enterprise of individuals, than the United  
State* s  
Finally, I shall not deny,that, in all doubtful  
cases, it becomes every government to lean  
rather to a confidence in the judgment of  
individuals, than to interpositions controll­  
ing the free exercise of it.  
With all these concessions, I think it can  
be satisfactorily shown, that there are ex­  
ceptions to the general rule, now express­  
ed by the phrase “ Let us alone,” forming  
bases which call for interpositions of the  
competent authority, and which are nut  
inconsistent with the generality of the  
rule.  
1. The Theory of “ Let us alone,” sup­  
pose that all nations concur in a perfect free­  
dom of commercial intercourse. Were  
this the case, they would in a commercial  
view, be but one nation; as much as the  
several districts composing a particular na­  
tion ; and the theory would be as applicable  
to the former as to the latter. But this gold­  
en age of free trade has not yet arrived;  
nor is there a single nation that has set the  
example. No nation can, indeed, safely do  
so, until a reciprocity, at least, be ensured  
to it. Take, for a proof, the familiar case  
of the navigation employed in a foreign  
commerce. If a nation, adhering to the  
rule of never interposing a countervailing  
protection of its vessels, admits foreign  
vessels into its ports free of duty whilst its  
own vessels are subject to a duty in foreign  
ports, the ruinous effect is so obvious, that  
the warmest advocate for the theory in  
question must shrink from a universal ap­  
plication of it.  
A nation, leaving its foreign trade, in all  
cases, to regulate itself, might soon find it  
egulated, by other nations, into a subservi­  
ency to a foreign interest. In the interval  
between the peace of 1783 and the estab­  
lishment of the present Constitution of the  
United States, the want of a general au­  
thority to regulate trade is known to have  
had this consequence. And have not the  
pretensions and policy latterly exhibited by  
Great Britain given warnings of a like re­  
sult from a renunciation of all countervail­  
ing regulations on the part of the United  
States ? Were she permitted by conferring  
on certain portions of her domain the name  
of colonies, to open from these a trade for  
herself, to foreign countries, and to exclude,  
at the same time, a reciprocal trade to such  
Colonies, by foreign countries, the use to  
be made of the monopoly need not be trac­  
ed. Its character will be placed in a just  
relief, by supposing that one of the Colonial  
Islands, instead of its present distance,  
happened to be in the vicinity of Great  
Britain; or that one of the islands in that  
vicinity should receive the name and be re­  
garded in the light of a Colony, with the  
peculiar privileges claimed for Colonies. Is  
it not manifest, that, in this case, the favour­  
ed island might be made the sole medium of  
the commercial intercourse with foreign na­  
tions, and the parent country thence enjoy  
essentia] advantage, as to the terms of it,  
which would flow from an unreciprocal  
trade from her other ports, with other na­  
tions ?  
  
Fortunately, the British tlaims, however  
speciously coloured or adroitly managed,  
were repelled at the commencement of our  
commercial career as an Independent Peo­  
ple, and at successive epochs under the ex­  
isting Constitution, both in legislative dis­  
cussions and in diplomatick negotiations.  
The claims were repelled on the solid ground  
that the Colonial trade, as a rightful monop­  
oly, was limited to the intercourse between  
the parent country and its colonies, and be­  
tween one colony and another; the whole  
being, strictly, in the nature of a coasting  
trade from one to another port of the same  
nation; a trade with which no other nation  
has a right to interfere. It follows, of ne­  
cessity, shat the parent country, whenever  
it opens a colonial port for a direct trade to  
a foreign country, departs, itself, from the  
principle of colonial monoply, and entitles  
the foreign country to the same reciprocity,  
in every respect, as in its intercourse with  
any other ports of the nation.  
This is common sense and common right.  
It is still more, if more could be required.  
It is in conformity with the established us 4  
age of all nations, other than Great Britain,  
which have colonies. Some of those na­  
tions are known to adhere to the monopoly  
of their colonial trade, with all the rigour  
and constancy which circumstances permit.  
But it is also known, that whenever, and  
from whatever cause, it has been found ne­  
cessary or expedient to open their colonial  
ports to a foreign trade, the rule of recipro­  
city in favour of the foreign party wbs not  
refused, nor, as is believed, a right to refuse  
it pretended.  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity vu  
dictated by a deficiency of the commercial  
marine. France, at least, could not be, in  
&gt; every instance, governed by that considera­  
■ tion—and Holland still leu ; to sty nothing

of the navigating States of Sweden and  
Denmark, which have rarely, if ever, enfor­  
ced a colonial monopoly. The remark is,  
indeed, obvious, that the shipping liberated  
from the usual conveyance of supplies from  
the parent country to the colonies might be  
employed in the new channels opened for  
them, in supplies from abroad.  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is the  
only rule of intercourse among independent  
communities; and no nation ought to admit  
a doctrine, or adopt an invariable policy,  
which precludes thecounteracting’measures  
necessary to enforce the rule.  
2. The Theory supposes, moreover, a per­  
petual peace; a supposition, it is to be feared,  
not less chimerical than a universal freedom  
of commerce.  
The effect of war among the commercial  
and mannfactoring nations of the world, in  
raising the wages of labour, and the cost of  
its products; with a like effect on the charg­  
es of frieght and insurance, need neither  
proof nor explanation. In order to deter­  
mine, therefore, a question on economy, be­  
tween depending on foreign supplies, and  
encouraging domestick substitutes, it is nec­  
essary to compare the probable periods of  
war with the probable periods of peace; and  
the cost of domestick encouragement in  
times of peace, with the cost added to for­  
eign articles in times of war.  
During the last century, the periods of  
war and peace have been nearly equal. The  
effect of a state of war in raising the price  
of imported articles, cannot be estimated  
with exactness. It is certain, however, that  
the increased price of particular articles  
may make it cheaper to manufacture them  
at home.  
  
Taking, for the sake of illustration, an  
equality in two periods, and the cost of an  
imported yard of cloth in time of war to be  
nine and a half dollars, and in time of peace  
to be seven dollars, whilst the same could at  
all times be manufactured at home for eight  
dollars, it is evident that a tariff of one dol­  
lar and a quarter on the imported yard  
would protect the home manufacture in time  
of peace, and avoid a tax of one dollar and a  
half imposed by a state of war.

MOKTriLIIB, OCT. 30, 1828.

I will premise that I concur in the o­  
pinion, that, as a general rule, individu­  
als ought to be deemed the best judges of  
the best application of their industry attd  
resources.  
I am teady to admit, also, that there is  
no country in which the application may,  
with more safety, be left to the intelli­  
gence and enterprise of individuals, than  
the United Slates.  
Finally, I shall not deny, that, in all  
doubtful cases, it becomes every govern­  
ment toleab rather to a confidence in the  
judgment of individuals, than to inter  
  
positions controlling the free exercise of  
  
it.  
With all these concessions, I think it

pressed by the phrase &quot;Let us alone,  
  
forming cases which call for interposi  
  
tions, ol the competent authority, and  
whtch awotuHicns  
erality of the rule.  
  
1. The theory of &#x27; Let us alone&quot; sup  
  
poses that all nations concur in a perfect  
freedom of commercial intercourse.&#x27;  
  
Were this the case, they would, in a com­  
mercial view, be but one nation, as much  
  
as the several districts composing a par  
  
ticular nation ; and the theory would be  
as applicable to the former as to the lat­  
ter. But this golden age. of free trade  
has not yet arrived : nor is there a single  
nation that has set the example. No na­  
tion can, indeed, safely do so, until a re­  
ciprocity, at least, be ensured to it.  
Take, for a proof, I he familiar case vf  
the navigation employed in foreign com­  
merce. If a nation, adhering to the rule  
of never interposing a countervailing pro­  
tection of its vessels, admits foreign ves  
  
sels into its ports free of duty, whilst its  
own vessels are subject to a duty in for­  
eign ports, the ruinous effect is so obvi­  
ous, that the wannest advocate for the  
  
theory in question must shrink Irem a  
universal application of it.  
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in  
all cases, to regulate itself, might soon  
find it regulated, by other nations, into  
a subserviency to a foreign interest. In  
the interval between the peace of 1783  
and the establishment of the present con­  
stitution of the United States, the want  
of a general authotity to regulate trade is  
known to have had this consequence.

country, whenever it opens a colonial  
port for a direct trade to a foreign coun­  
try, departs itself from the principle of  
colonial monopoly&#x27; and entitles the for­  
eign country to the same reciprocity, in  
every respect, at in its intercourse with  
any other ports of the nation. -  
This is common sense and common  
right. It is still more, if .more could be  
  
&#x27;required. It is in conformity -With- the  
  
established usage ol oil nations, otner  
than Great Britain, which have colonies.  
Some of those nations are known to tfd  
here to the monopoly of their colonial  
  
trade, -with all the rigr&#x27;tKl&#x27; constancy  
  
which circumstances petOiit. , JJut it is  
also known, that, whenever, and from  
whatever cause, ithas been found neces­  
sary or expedient to open their colonial  
ports to a foreign trade, the rule of re­  
ciprocity in favour of the foreign party  
was not refused, nor, as is believed, a  
right to refuse it pretended.  
It cannot be said that the reciprocity  
was dictated by a deficiency of the com­  
mercial marine. Fi ance, at least, coulc!  
not be, in every instance, governed by  
that consideration and Holland still  
less ; to say nothing of the navigating  
states of Sweden aod Denmark, which  
have rarely, if ever, enforced a colonial  
monopoly. This remark is, indeed, ob­  
vious, that the supplies from the parent  
  
country to the colonies, might be em­  
ployed in the new channels opened for  
  
them, in supplies Irons aoroaa.  
  
Reciprocity, or an equivalent for it, is  
the only rule of intercourse amone the  
  
Tri dene ndeh ft 6 m tn ii ni tits f &quot;arid &quot;no ha

nernetual Dcace ;a supposition, it is to  
  
be feared, not less chimerical thati a uni­  
versal freedom of commerce.  
The effect of war among the comraer  
  
cial and manufacturing nations of the  
  
world, in raising the wages of labor, and  
  
the cost of its product ; with a like ef  
  
fect on the charges of freight and insur  
  
ance, need neither proof nor explanation  
In order to determine, therefore, I  
  
question of economy, between depend  
  
ing on foreign supplies, and encourag  
  
ing domestic substitutes, it is necessary  
  
to compare the probable periods ol war  
  
with the probable periods of peace ; and  
  
the cost of the domestic enconragemrnt  
in times of peace, with the cost added  
  
to foreign articles in times of war.  
  
During the last century, the periods of  
  
war and peace have been nearly equal  
  
1 he ettect ol a state ol war in raising  
  
the price of imported articles, cannot be  
  
estimated with exactness. It is certain,  
  
however, that the increased price of par­  
ticular articles may make it cheaper to  
  
manufacture them at home.  
  
Taking,&#x27; for the sake of illustration, an  
  
equality in the two periods, and the cos:  
of an imported yard of cloth in time of  
  
war to he nine and a half dollars, and in  
time of peace to be seven dollars, whilst  
the same could at all times be manufac­  
tured at home for eight dollars, it is evi­  
dent that a tariff of one dollar and a quar­  
ter on the imported yard would protect  
  
the home manufacture in time of peace,  
  
and avoid a tax of one dollar and a half  
  
imposed by a state of war.  
  
It cannot be said that the manufacto  
  
ries winch could not support themselves  
against foreign competition in periods  
of peace, would spring up of themselves  
  
at the recurrence of war prices. It must  
be obvious to every one, that, apart from  
the difficuliy-of great-aod suddeni chan­  
ges of employment, no prudent capital

nomy would thus  
require to be instructed in its rudiments.  
The editor of the Advocate is at some  
pains to prove that it is cheaper to give  
from thirty dollars to twenty dollars for  
a coat in time of war, and ten dollars in  
time of peace, than to give twenty dollars  
for it during both war and peace. So un-  
deniable a proposition scarcely required  
such an array of arithmetic to prove it.  
  
Nor have the more temperate defenders of  
  
the protecting system maintained that the  
addition to the price of manufactures in war  
justified “ exorbitant duties.” The prin-  
ciple is thus stated by Mr. Madison.  
  
“ Taking, for the sake of illustration, an equa-  
lity in the two periods, and the cost on an im-  
ported yard of cloth in time of war to be nine  
and a half dollars, and in time of peace, to be  
seven dollars, whilst the same could, at all times,  
be manufactured at home for eight dollars, it is  
evident that a tariff of one dollar and a quarter  
on the imported yard, could protect the home  
manufacture in time of peace, and avoida tax of  
one and a half dollars imposed by a state of war  
  
It cannot be said that manufactories  
could not support themselves against foreign  
competition in periods of peace, would spring up  
of themselves at the recurrence of war prices. It  
must be obvious to every one, that apart from the  
difficulty of great and sudden changes of employ-  
ment, no prudent capitalists would engage in  
expensive establishments of any sort, at the com-  
mencement of a war of uncertain duration, with  
acertainty of having them crushed by the return  
of peace.  
  
The strictest economy, therefore, suggests, as  
exceptions to the general rule, an estimate, in  
every given case, of war and peace periods and  
prices ; with inferences therefrom, uf the amount  
of a tariff which might be affected during peace,  
in order to avoid the tax resulting from war.  
And it will occur at once, that the inferences  
will be strengthened by adding to the supposi-  
tion of wars wholly foreign, that of wars in  
which our own country might be a party.

a worthy son of Virginia, under date of October  
3rd, 1828. Says Mr. M: &quot;The theory of &#x27;let us  
alone&#x27; supposes that all nations concur in a per  
feet freedom of commercial intercourse. Were  
this the case, they would, in a commercial view,  
be but one nation, as much as the several districts  
comprising a particular aation; and the theory  
would be as applicable to the former as to the lat-  
ter. But this golden age of free trade has not  
yet arrived, nor is there a single aaties that tas  
set the example. No nation can, indeed, safoly do  
so, until a reciprocity, at least, be insured to it.  
Take for a proof, the familiar case of the naviga  
tion employed in a foreign commerce. If a nation,  
adhering to the rule of never interposing a coun­  
tervailing protection of its righta, admits foreign  
vessels inte its ports free of duty, whilst its own  
vessels are subject to a duty in foreign ports, the  
ruinous affect is so obvious, that the warmest ad­

blorororadun, Oot. 30,1823.   
&#x27;ODE/at Sin In my lettor of September 18th I   
Stated, briefly, the grounds on which I rested my   
opinion that a power to Imposts duties and rostrie­  
lions On imparts, with a view to encourage domes­  
tic productions, was constitutionally lodged In   
Congrese,   
pi the observations then made was involved the   
Opinion, also, that the power was property lodged   
there. As this last opinion noonesarily implies   
that there are oases in which the power may be   
Mleftilly exorcised by Congress, the only body   
*thin our volition! system capable of exercising   
it,ivith °treat, you may think it ineumbent on me   
to,voint out oases of that dosoriPtiell•   
I will promise that I concur in the opinion that,   
aak koneral rule, individuals ought to be deemed   
thebest judges of the beet application of their in­  
dustry and resources.   
act ready to admit, also, that there is no coon­  
try in which the application May With more safety   
be loft to the intelligence and enterprise of indi­  
ylduals than the United States.   
- Finally, I shall not deny, that;in all doubtful   
flases,•it becomes every Government&#x27; to lean&#x27; rather   
to a eonfitlonce in the judgment of individual, thou   
to interposition, controlling, the free exercise of it.   
• &#x27;With all those coneetsions, I&#x27; think, it can be   
Satisfaaterily shown, that there&#x27;re exceptions to   
the&#x27;, general rule, now expressed by the phrase   
&quot;t Let na alone,&quot; forming oases which calf for the   
Interposition of the cotnpeterit authority, and   
whieh are not Inconsistent with the generality of   
the role, , ,   
I. The theory of &quot;let 4 alone&quot; supposes that   
All nations concur in a perfect freedom of coup   
nierolal, intercourse Wore this the ease, they   
Would, in to commercial view, be but o.e nation, as   
Much as the several distrials comPoshig a particu­  
lar nation; and the theory would he as applicable&#x27;   
to the. former as to the latter. But this golden   
age of free trade boa notyet arrived ; nor is there   
a single nation that has set the example. No na­  
„Von eon; indeed, safely do so until a reciprocity,   
at least, he insured to it. Take, for a proof, the   
&#x27;familiar ease of navigation employed in foreign   
commerce. If a nation, adhering to the rule of   
never interposing a countervailing protection of   
its vessels, admits foreign vessels Into 48 ports free   
of ant*, &quot;whilst its owe verselts are Subject to a duty   
in foreign ports, the ruinous effect is 80 obvious,   
•that the warmest advocates for the theory in gees­  
port must shrink from a universal application of it.   
A nation leaving its foreign trade, in all eases   
to regulate itself, might soon And&#x27; it regulated, by   
other nations, into subservieney to a foreign in­  
terest. In the interval between the peace of 1783   
and the establishment of the present Constitution   
Of tho United States, the want of a general au­  
thority to regulate trade is known to have bad   
this consequence. And have not the pretensions   
and policy latterly exhibited by Great Britain   
given warning of a like result from a renunciation   
of all QojAptorvailing regulations on the part of the   
United States? Were she permitted, by confer­  
ring upon&#x27;oertain portions of her domain the name   
of colonies, to open&#x27; from theist a trado&#x27;for herself   
to foreigfi countries, and to exclude at the same   
time a reciprocal trade to such colonies, by foreign   
countries; the use to be made of the monopoly   
need not betraead. Its character will be placed   
.in a just relief by supposing that one of the colo­  
nial Islands, instead of its present distance, hap­  
pened to be An the &#x27;vloinity of Great Britain, or   
that one of the islands in that vicinity should re­  
ceive that name and be regarded in. tho light of a   
.colony, with the peculiar privileges claimed for   
.colonies. Is it not manifest, that, in this case, the   
favored Island might be made the • sole niediuda of   
the oommerpial Intervenes° with foreign nations,   
and the parent country therms&#x27; enjoy every essen­  
tial advantage, as to the terms of it, which would &#x27;   
flow from an unreriproeal trade from her other   
;ports, with other nations?   
Fortunately, the British claims, however Sipe­  
oiontly colored or adroitly managed, were repelled   
&#x27;at the cornmenclement of our commercial career as   
an indePOndent people, and at successive epochs   
under the existing Constitution, both inlogislattve   
discussions and in diplomatic negotiation&#x27;s. The   
,olainas wore repelled on the solid ground that the   
Colonial trade, as a rightful monopoly, was limited   
to the intercourse betweon the parent country and   
Its colonies, and between one colony and another ;   
the whole being strictly in the nature of o coasting   
trade from ono to another port of the same nation,   
&#x27;ts trade willkwhieh no other nation has a right to.   
liteaftte, • lit follows, of rocesaity that the.ps.reat   
emintry, when:Our&#x27; it °pone @, colonial port ,for a-  
Attest tratte4o ,a-forergn toutitry,. departa Itself   
from the principles of colantal monopoly, end po­  
litica the foreign country to the same reelproeity;   
Tn every respect, as in, intercourse with any   
other ports of the nation.   
This is common senie and common right. It-is   
Still more if more could be&#x27;requircti. It is in con-   
formity with the established usage of all nations,   
other than Great Britain, which have colonies   
Some of these nations are known to adhere to ,the&#x27;   
monopoly of their colonial trade with all the vigor   
and constancy which 6room:fiances permit ;   
but,it is also known that,&#x27; whenever, and from   
whatever cause, it has been found necessary or ex­  
pediont to open their colonial ports to a foreign   
trade, the rule of reel procity in favor of the foreign ,   
party was not refused, nor, as is hollered, a right   
to refuse it pretended   
It cannot he said that the reciprocity was die-   
tiled by a deficiency of the commercial marine.   
&#x27;&#x27;ranee, at least, could not be, in every instance,   
governed by that consideration and ffolland still   
less, to say nothing of the navigating States of   
Sweden and Denmark, which have rarely, if over,   
enforced a colonial monopoly. The remark is   
indeed obvious that the shipping liberated from   
the usual conveyance of supplies from the parent.   
country to the colonies might he employed IU the   
new channels opened for theta in supplies from   
abroad.   
  
Reolp.roalty, or au, equivalent for it, is the only   
rule of intercoms° among the independent 00111-  
munities; and no nation ought to admit a doctrine   
or adopt an invariable policy which would pre­  
clude the counteracting measures necessary to en­  
force the rule.   
  
2. The theory supposes, itioreovnr, A perpetual   
peace) a supposition, it is to be feared; not Joss   
ohimorical than a universal freedom °commerce.   
The offeot of war among the commercial and   
manufacturiog nations of the world, in raising the   
wages of labor and the oost of produots, with a like   
effect on tho charges of freight and in•uraneo,   
needs neither proof nor explanation. In order to   
.determine, therefore, a question of economy, be.   
twoen depending upon foreign supplies and on•   
oouraging domestic imbatitutes, It is necessary to   
compare the probable periods of war with the   
probable periods of peace; and the cost of the   
don/rdio enoottragetnent in times of peace with   
the oost added to foreign articles in times of   
war.   
  
During the Last century the periods of war and   
ponce have been nearly equal. The effect of a   
Sate of war in raising the price of imported arti­  
cles cannot be estimated with exactness. It is   
certain, however, that the increased price of par­  
ticular articles may make it cheaper to manufao­  
tare them at home. Tithing, for the mks of illus­  
tration, an equality in the two periods, and the   
omit of an imported yard of cloth in time of war to   
ho nine and a half dollars, and in time of peace to   
be seven dollars, whilst the same could, at all   
times, be manufactured at home for eight dollars,   
it is evident that a tariff of ono dollar and a quar­  
ter on the imported yard would protect the home   
manufacture In time of peace, and avoid a tag of   
one dollar and a half imposed? in a state of war.   
It sanest bo said that the manufactories which   
Could not support themselves against foreign com­  
petition In periods of peace, would spring up of   
themselves at the recurrence of war prices. It   
must be obvious to every one that, apart from the   
difficulties of groat and sudden changes of employ­  
ment, no prudent capitalist would engage In ex­  
pensive establishments of any sort at the com•   
mcneement of it war of uncertain duration with a   
certainty of having them crushed by a return of   
peace. The strictest economy, therefore, suggests,   
as exceptions to the general rule, an estimate, in   
every given ease, of war and pence periods and   
prices, with inferences therefrom of the amount of   
a tariff which might be afforded during peace, In   
order to avoid the tax resulting from war ; and it   
will occur at once that the Inferences will ho   
strengthened by adding to the supposition of wars   
wholly foreign that of wars in which our own coun•   
try might be a party.
