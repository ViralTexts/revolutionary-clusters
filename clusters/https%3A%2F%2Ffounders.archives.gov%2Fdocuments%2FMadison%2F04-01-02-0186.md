## The 45th number of the Federalist, written by James Madison, is devoted to a "discussion of the supposed danger from the powers of the Union, to the State Governments;" and it may be advantageous at this moment, when such assiduous efforts are made to impress the public mind with the belief that the United States have encloeshed dangerously on the rights of Georgia, South Carolina, &c. to place before our readers a brief extract from this number

upon the topics, and the connection of the  
Numbers 47 and 48  
are, without question, Madison’s. The title  
of 47 is: “The Meaning of the Maxim,  
which requires a Separation of the Depart-  
ments of Power, Examined and Ascertain-  
ed ;” the title of 48 is : ““The Same Sub-  
  
  
  
1864,]  
  
ject Continued, with a view of giving  
Efficacy in Practice to that Maxim ;” the  
titles of 49 and 50 are: ‘“ The Same Sub-  
ject Continued, with the Same View ;” the  
title of 51 is : ‘“‘ The Same Subject Continu-  
ed, with the Same view, and Concluded.”  
These five numbers are thus really but parts  
of one essay. The first two parts are cer-  
tainly by Madison, and the antecedent  
probability is that the others are his also,  
for it is not likely that an essay tending to  
one point would be commenced by one and  
finished by the other. Number 52 com-  
mences a new essay on a topic closely allied  
to the preceding one. It is entitled, ‘“‘ Con-  
cerning the House of Representatives,” &amp;c.  
Numbers 53 to 58 are all entitled, ‘“‘ The  
Same Subject Continued,’ &amp;e. These  
seven numbers are thus parts of a single  
  
essay, without doubt written by the same |  
  
person. It, as we have seen, is claimed for  
both writers. To assign them to Madison
