le for them to their Country.  
This, however, is not the proper time, nor place for the discussion of those points. I shall therefore proceed to take notice of that part of the Treaty only, which you have done me the honour to ask my sentiments upon.  
The 8th. Article of the original Treaty proposed by Congress contains the following words. “The most Christian King shall retain the same rights of fishery on the banks of Newfoundland, and all other rights relating to any of the said Islands, which he is entitled to by virtue of the Treaty of Paris.”  
The 13th. Article of the Treaty of Utrecht contains the following, “It shall be allowed to the subjects of France to catch fish, and to dry them on land, in that part only, and in no other besides that, of the said Island of Newfoundland, which stretches from the place called Cape Bonavista, to the northern point of the said Island, and from thence running down by the western side, reaches as far as the place called Point Riche.” The French pretended that in consequence of the above Article, they had an exclusive right to fish on such parts of the coast of Newfoundland as are therein described, but the claim was never admitted by England; indeed the Treaty of Utrecht does not af­  
  
  
  
ford any grounds for such a claim. The 5th. Article of the Treaty of Paris says, “The subjects of France shall have the liberty of fishing, and drying on a part of the coasts of the Island of Newfoundland, such as it is specified in the 13th. Article of the Treaty of Utrecht.” The words “indefinite, and exclusive right,” make no part of either of the above Treaties, yet they are inserted in the 10th. Article of our Treaty of Commerce; and that it may seem as if no innovation was

ility of being excluded from part of it is considered. Since the advantages of Commerce have been well understood, the Fishery has been looked upon by the naval Powers of Europe as an object of the greatest importance. The French have been encreasing their Fishery ever since the Treaty of Utrecht, which has enabled them to rival Great Britain at Sea. The Fisheries of Holland were not only the first rise of that Republic, but have been the constant support of all her Commerce, and Navigation.  
This branch of trade is of such concern to the Dutch, that in their public prayers, they are said to request the Supreme Being “that it would please him to bless the Government, the Lords the States, and also their Fisheries.” The Fishery of Newfoundland appears to me to be a mine of infinitely greater value than Mexico, and Peru. It enriches the Proprietors, is worked at less expence, and is the source of naval strength, and protection. I hav

 William, to encourage the trade to New- i  
foundland, do’s require that no alien or stranger whatsoever (not  
residing within the Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales  
or Toun of Berwick upon Tweed) shall at any time hereafter  
take any bait, or use any sort of trade or fishing whatsoever in  
Newfoundland or any of the Islands or places thereunto belonging.  
The 13th Article of the Treaty of Peace with France concluded  
at Utrecht, doth give up all Newfoundland with the Islands  
adjacent to this Kingdom, and the French are thereby excluded  
from fishing in any parts thereof, except in that part only, which  
stretches from the place call’d Cape Bonavista, to the Northern  
Point of the said Island, and from thence running down by the  
Western side, reaches as far as the place call’d Point Riche.  
As these interfere with one another, we are apprehensive that in  
case we shou’d give an instruction to the Commodore, to take  
care that the French do not fish in any parts, but those to which  
they are limited, it may be interpreted, that they have leave t

Ralph Izard, of South Carolina, writing from Paris, Sep-  
tember 24, 1783, says: “Since the advantages of commerce  
have been well understood, the fisheries have been looked  
upon by the naval powers of Europe as an object of the great-  
est importance. The fisheries of Holland were not only the  
first rise of the Republic, but have been the constant support  
of all her commerce and navigation. This branch of trade is  
of such concern to the Dutch, that in their public prayers they  
are said to request the Supreme Being ‘that it would please  
him to bless the government, the lords, the states, and also  
their fisheries.’ The fishery of Newfoundland appears to me  
to be a mine of infinitely greater value than Mexico and Peru.  
It enriches the proprietors, is worked at less expense, and is  
the source of naval strength and protection.” “ No peac
