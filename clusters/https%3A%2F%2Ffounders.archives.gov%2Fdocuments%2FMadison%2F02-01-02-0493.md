politan ship of 28 guns, (American  
built) with 246 men commanded by  
their High Admiral; an English Re­  
negado, married to the Bafhaw’s  
daughter ; also a brig of 16 guns and  
146 men.—They are both cruisers  
failing in company. They reported  
on arrival to the health-office, that  
they had been out 35 days and cap­  
tured nothing, but wanted water—  
the Prattic master asked the Admiral  
if they were at war with 4merica, who  
said they were not. On the 30th ar­  
rived the President, Commodore Dale,  
the Philadelphia and Essex frigates ;  
they anchored close to the above crui­  
sers, who were under quarantine. I  
immediately waited on the Commo­  
dore, taking with me Confitls O’Brien  
and Cathcart’s letters relative to the  
affairs of Barbary, &amp;c. for his infor­  
mation. He delivered me your favor  
of the 24th of May last, the contents  
of which I have duly noted, and per~  
  
mit me to assure you, that every thing  
in iy power to serve the Commeo.  
dore, his squadron, and the nation in  
general, shall not be wanting, and it  
will give me the greatest pleasure,  
when [ can be ufeful to either, as in  
dity bound:&lt;=The Commodore made  
enquiry of the Admiral if ‘they were  
at. war or peace with the United  
States ; he said the latter.—He then  
enquired if he left Coniul Cathcart  
well ; he replied that he had gone  
from Tripoli a fortnight before he fail­  
ed for Tunis ; that he went of his  
own accord, and that he was no friend  
tothe Americans. I likewise went a­  
long fide of him yesterday morning  
(as his agent expressed to me that he  
wifhea to have some conversation with  
commodore Dale) to tell him, as he  
was to get Prattic that day, the com­  
modore had no obje&amp;ion to fecing him  
on board the Prelident,orat myhoufe  
on thore, which he rejected, faying he  
would meet us at a tavern, and no  
where else. Indeed I perceived he  
was trifling in the business, so that  
the commodore determined to go to  
sea with the squadron, which he did  
this morning, t«king with him the ship  
Grand Turk, bound to Tunis with  
the flipulations, and the brig Hope of  
Baltimore, James Norman, comman­  
des.”
