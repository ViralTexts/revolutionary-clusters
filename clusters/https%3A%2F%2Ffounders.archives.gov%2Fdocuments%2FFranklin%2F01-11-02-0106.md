*We are sorry to give the Reader trouble, but if he will be pleased to consult Dyche’s English Dictionary for his first Definition of Gold-Finder, it will Convey that very Idea which we have of the old Women [sic] Barbara, the Drs. Hand Maid. Tho’ we cannot help confessing that some Authors have positively asserted that Barbara is that Species of Animal which the Marylanders call a Powne, the Scots a Gallowe: and the English by some other Name. However it be, Posterity are welcome to decide the Controversy.
