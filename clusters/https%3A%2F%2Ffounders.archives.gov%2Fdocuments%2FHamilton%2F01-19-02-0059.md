les of natural right as relative to political societies or States. 2 The voluntary law, which is a system of rules resulting from the equality and independence of nations, and which, in the administration of their affairs and the pursuit of their pretensions, proceeding on the principle of their having no common judge upon earth, attributes equal validity, as to external effects, to the measures or conduct of one as of another without regard to the intrinsic justice of those measures or that conduct.

ctly treats the point. His opinion has been said to favour the right to confiscate and sequester. But when carefully analized it will add to the proofs of the levity with which the opposers of the Treaty make assertions.  
After stating among other things that “War gives the same right over any sum of money due by a neutral nation to our enemy as it can give over his other goods” he proceeds thus  
Book III Chap V § 77  
“When Alexander by conquest became absolute Master of Thebes he remitted to the Thessalians a hundred talents which they owed to the Thebans. The sovereign has naturally the same right over what his subjects may be indebted to his enemies. Therefore he may confiscate debts of this nature, if the term of payment happen in the time of War, or at least he may prohibit his subjects from paying while the War last[s]. But at present in regard to the advantage and safety of Commerce, all the sovereigns of Europe have departed from this Rigour. And as this Custom has been generally received, he who should act contrary to it would injure the public faith; for strangers trusted his subjects only from a firm persuasion that the General Custom would be observed. The State does not so much as touch the sums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in case

as confiscation.  
In another place the Author gives the reason of this position—Book II Chapt XVIII “In reprisals, the goods of a subject are seized in the same manner as those of the State or the Sovereign. Every thing that belongs to the nation is liable to reprisals as soon as it can be seized provided it be not a deposit trusted to the public faith. This Deposit is found in our hands only in consequence of the confidence which the proprietor has put in our good faith, and it ought to be respected even in case of open War. Thus it is usual to behave in France England and elsewhere with respect to the money which foreigners have placed in the public funds.” The same principle if he had r

. And the general voice of our Nation, together with the very arguments used against the Treaty accord in the same point. ’Tis indubitable that the customary law of European Nations is as a part of the common law and by adoption that of the U States.  
But let it not be forgotten, that I derive the vindication of the article from a higher source; from the natural or necessary law of nations, from the eternal principles of morality &amp; good faith.  
There is one more authority which I shall cite in reference to a part of the question—property in the public funds. It is a Report to the British King in the year 1753, from Sir George Lee Judge of the Prerogative Court Doctor Paul Advocate General in the Courts of Civil Law Sir Dudley Ryder and Mr. Murray Attorney &amp; Solicitor General

f one of the Governments interested in the Contest—had it not since received the eulogies and concurrence of impartial and celebrated foreign Writers. Among these, Vatel calls it an excellent piece on the law of Nations.  
The following is an extract—“The King of Prussia has pleged his Royal word to pay the Silesia Debt to private men. It is negotiable and many parts of it have been assigned to the subjects of other powers. It will not be easy to find an instance, where a Prince has thought fit to make reprisals upon a debt due from himself to private men. There is a confidence that this will not be done. A private man lends money to a Prince upon an engagement of honor, because a prince cannot be compelled like other men in an adversary way by a Court of Justice. So scrupulously did England and France adhere to this public faith, that even during the War, they suffered no inquiry to be made whether any part of the public Debt was due to the subjects of the enemy, though it is certain many English had money in the French Funds and many French had money in our’s.”  
The universal obligation of good faith is thus reenforced on a special ground by the point of honor; to confirm the position that money which a sovereign or State owes to private men is not a proper object of Reprisals.  
  
This case of the Silesia debt is the only example within the present Century prior to the

“The decrees concerning the sequestration of the property of the subjects of the powers at War with the Republic are annulled. Such sums as have been paid by French Citizens into the Treasury in consequence of those Decrees will be reimbursed.”  
In the course of the debates upon this decree, it was declared that the decrees which it was to repeal had prepared the ruin of Commerce and had severed, against the right of Nations, the obligations of Merchants in different states. This is a direct admission that the sequestration was contrary to the law of Nations.

The report (mace to his Majefty by Sir  
George Lee, Dr. Paul, and the Attorney and  
Solicitor General) of the proceedings of the  
Court of Admiralty, and of their opinion con-  
ceming the nature and regularity of the pro-  
steiimgs peter the Pruffian commiffion, :nd  
  
The UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
the demand pretended to be founded thereon,  
has the following obfervation: The Kigg of  
Pruffia has engaged his royal word to pay the  
Silefia debt to private men, Tt is negotiable,  
and raany parts have been afligned to the fub-  
jeéts of other powers. It will not be eafy to  
find an inftance, where a Prince has thought  
fit to make reprifals upon a debt due from  
himafelf to private men. There is a confidence  
that this will not be done: A private man  
lends money to a Prince upon the faith of an  
engagement of honour; becaufe a Prince can-  
not be compelled, like other men, in an ad-  
verfe way, by a Court of Juftice. So {crupu-  
loufly did England, France, and Spain adhere to  
this publick faith, that even during the war  
they fuffered no enquiry to be made, whether  
any part of the publick debts was due to fub-  
jects of the enemy ; though it is certain many  
Englith had money in the French funds, and  
many French had money in ours.  
  
This loan to the late Emperor of Germany,  
Charles VI, in January’ 1734-5, was not a  
ftate tranfaétion, but a mere private contract  
with the lenders, who advanced their money,  
upon the Emperor&#x27;s obliging himfelf and his  
heirs to repay the principal with intereft, at  
the rate, in the manner, and at the times in
