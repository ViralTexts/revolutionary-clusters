Sunday, 1763. Dined at Dr. Putnam&#x27;s  
with Col. Putnam and lady, and two  
young gemlemen, nephews of the doc­  
tor, and Colonel—, and a Miss Schooley  
Putnam told a story of an Indian upon  
Connecticut River, who called at a tav­  
ern in the fall of the year for a dram.  
The landlord asked him two coppers for  
it. The next spring happening at the  
same house, he called for another, and  
had three coppers to pay for it. &#x27;&#x27;How  
is this, landlord,&quot; said he; &quot;last fall  
you asked two coppers for a glass of  
rum, now you ask three.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says  
the landlord, it costs me a good deal to  
keep rum over winter. It is as expen­  
sive to keep a hogshead of rum oyer  
winter as a horse.&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; Says the  
Indian, &quot;I can&#x27;t see through that; he  
wont eat so much hay; may be he drink  
as much water.&quot; This was sheer wit,  
pure satire and true humor. Humor,  
wit and satire, in one very short re­  
partee.

Adamsin his diary: An Indian living neat  
the Connecticut River, called at a tavern in  
the fall of the yearforadram. The landlord  
asked him two coppers for it. The next  
spring, happening at the same house, he cal-  
led for another, and had three coppers to pay  
for it. ‘‘How is this, landlord?” said he;  
‘‘last fall you asked two coppers fora glass  
of rum, now you ask three.”? ‘‘O,” says the  
landlord, ‘‘ it costs mea good deal to keep  
rum over winter. It isas expensive to keep  
a hogshead of rum over winter asa horse.”  
‘¢ Ah!”? says the Indian, ‘‘ I can’t see through  
that; he won’t eat so much hay; maybe he  
drink as much water.’’? This was sheer wit,  
pure satire, andtrue humor. Humor, wit and  
satire in one short repartee.
