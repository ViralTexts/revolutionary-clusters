My dear friend—Enclosed is my letter to Mr. Fox. I beg you would assure him that my expressions of esteem for him are not mere professions. I really think him a great man; and I would not think so, if I did not believe he was at bottom, and would prove himself a good one.—Guard him against mistaken notions of the American people. You have deceived yourselves too long with vain expectations of reaping advantage from our little discontents. We are more thoroughly an enlightened people, with respect to our political interests, than perhaps any other under heaven. Every man among us reads, and is so easy in his circumstances as to have leisure for conversations of improvement, and for acquiring information. Our domestic misunderstandings, when we have them, are of small extent, though monstrously magnified by your microscopic newspapers. He who judges from them, that we are upon the point of falling into anarchy, or returning to the obedience of Britain, is like one being shewn some spots in the sun, should fancy that the whole disk would soon be overspread with them, and that there would be an end of day-light. The great body of intelligence among our people, surrounds and overpowers our petty dissensions, as the sun’s great mass of fire, diminishes and destroys his spots. Do not therefore any longer delay the evacuation of New-York, in the vain hope of a new revolution in your favor, if such a hope has indeed had any effect in occasioning the delay. It is now nine months since the evacuations were promised. You expect with reason that the people of New-York should do your merchants justice, in the payment of their old debts, considering the injustice you do them, in keeping them so long out of their habitations and out of their business, by which they might have been enabled to make payments.  
There is no truth more clear to me than this, that the great interest of our two countries is a thorough reconciliation. Restraints on the freedom of commerce and intercourse between us can afford no advantage equivalent to the mischief they will do, by keeping up that ill humour and promoting a total alienation. Let you and I, my dear friend, do our best towards advancing and securing that reconciliation. We can do nothing that will in a dying hour afford us more solid satisfaction.  
	    I wish you a prosperous journey, and a happy sight of your friends. Present my best respects to your good brother and sister, and believe me ever, with sincere and great esteem, yours affectionately.  
  
Signed, B Franklin

 &quot;PAssy, Sepf. 6, 1783.  
  
&quot;MY DeAr FrIend: Enclosed is my letter  
to Mr. Fox. I beg you would assure him  
that my expressions of esteem for him are  
not mere professions; I really think him a  
great man, and I could not think so if I did  
not believe he was at bottom, and would  
prove himself a good one. Guard him  
against mistaken notions of the American  
people. You have deceived yourselves too  
long with expections of reaping advantage  
from our little discontents. We are more  
thoroughly an enlightened people with res­  
pect to our political interests than, perhaps,  
any other under heaven. Every man among  
us reads, and is so easy in his circumstances  
as to have leisure for conversations of im  
provement and for acquiring information.  
Our domestic misunderstandings, when we  
have them, are of small extent, though mon­  
strously magnified by your microscopic news­  
papers. He who judges from them that we  
are at the point of falling into anarchy, or  
returning to the obedience of Britain, is like  
one who, being shown some spots on the sun,  
should fancy that the whole dise would soon  
be overspread by them, and that there would  
be an end of daylight. The great body of  
intelligence among our people surrounds and  
overpowers our petty dissensions, as the  
sun&#x27;s great mass of fire diminishes and des­  
troys his spots. Do not, therefore, any lon­  
ger delay the evacuation of New York in the  
vain hope of a new revolution in your favor,  
if such a hope has indeed had any effect in  
causing that delay. It is now nine months  
since that evacuation was promised. You  
expect, with reason, that the people of New  
York should do your merchants justice in the  
payment of their old debts. Consider the in  
justice you do them in keeping them so long  
out of their habitations and out of their busl­  
ness, by which they might have been enabled  
to make payment. There is no truth more  
clear to me than this, that the great interest  
of our two countries is a thorough reconcilia  
tion. Restraints on the freedom of commerce  
and intercourse between us can afford no ad­  
vantage equivalent to the mischief they will  
do by keeping up ill-humor, and promoting  
a total alienation. Let you and I, my dear  
friend, do our best towards securing and ad­  
vancing that reconciliation. We can do  
nothing that in a dying hour will afford us  
more solid satisfaction.  
&quot;I wish you a prosperous journey and a
