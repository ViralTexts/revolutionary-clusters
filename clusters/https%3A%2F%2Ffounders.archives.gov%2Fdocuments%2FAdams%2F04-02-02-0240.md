od of tears from my Eyes, and rung my Heart with anguish inexpressible. I pray Heaven I may not live to realize it.  
Tis almost 14 years since we were united, but not more than half that time have we had the happiness of living together.  
The unfealing world may consider it in what light they please, I consider it as a sacrifice to my Country and one of my greatest misfortunes for my husband to be seperated from my children at a time of life when the joint instructions and admonition of parents sink deeper than in maturer years.  
The Hopes of the smiles and approbation of my Friend sweetens all my toil and Labours—  
  
Ye pow’rs whom Men, and birds obey,  
Great rulers of your creatures, say  
Why mourning comes, by bliss convey’d  
  
And ev’n the Sweets of Love allay’d?  
Where grows enjoyment, tall and fair,  
Around it twines entangling care  
While fear for what our Souls possess  
Enervates ev’ry powe’r to Bless.  
Yet Friendship forms the Bliss above  
And life! what art thou without love
