But he said as no proof appeared, and the fact being that War did not commence till after the Vessel sailed, he thought it unlikely that Americans would speculate upon the Subject. But supposing says he that it was an importation from Manila to Amsterdam, at this period it would have been an importation perfectly legal: and all transactions in America may be laid out of the question.
