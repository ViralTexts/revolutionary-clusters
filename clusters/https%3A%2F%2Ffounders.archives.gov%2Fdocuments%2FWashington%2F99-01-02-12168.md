ffairs of government. This Conduct, might, forever endear you to all the  
lovers of God and man.  
And now, dear Sir, my earnest wish, and fervent prayer is, that the great God Would still regard you with a favourable Eye, and that after many years of Service here, he may be pleased of his free mercy and grace to receive you to the Mansions of Glory, and  
give you that Abbrobation which is infinitely superior to the highest Applause of Mortals, &quot;Well done, thou good and faithful Servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.&quot; There you shall  
drink at the fountain Head of pleasure, and be refreshed with the emanations of original Life and Joy, you shall hear the voice of uncreated Harmony speaking peace, and ineffable Consolation to your soul.  
I have wrote a lengthy and free letter, but the great love I have for you may be my excuse, and tho’ at present you will have congratulations more worthy of your Attention, than this poor servant of mine, yet when you come to retire
