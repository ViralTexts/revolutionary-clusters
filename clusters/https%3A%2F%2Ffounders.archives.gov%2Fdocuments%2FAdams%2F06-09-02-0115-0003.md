se of Things, and have not only lost, forever, that dominion, which they had and might have held, but the extirnal Parts of the Empire are, one after another falling off, and it will be once more reduced to its insular Existence.  
On the other hand, this new System of Power, moving round its own proper Center, which is, America, has dissolved all the Forces Sent against it by the English. and has formed natural Connections, with France and Spain, and other Countries. Founded in Nature, it is growing, by accellerated motions, into a great and powerfull Empire. It has taken its equal Station among the nations of the Earth. Video Solem orientem in Occidente. North America The Congress of The United States of North America is a new primary Planet, which taking its Course in its own orbit, must have an Effect upon the orbit of every other, and Shift the common Center of Gravity of the whole System of the European World. The are De Facto, an independant Power, and must be so de Jure.  
The Politicians of Europe, may reason; and the Powers of Europe may negotiate or fight: but such Reasonings, Negotiations, and Wars, will have no Consequence on the Right or the Fact. It would be just as wise to fight or negotiate for the dominion of the moon, which is common to them all; and all may profit of her reflected Light. The Independence of America, is as fixed as Fate. She is Mistress of her own Fortune; knows that She is So; and will manage that Power which She feels herself possessed of, to establish her own System, and change that of Europe.  
If the Powers of Europe, will See the State of Things, and act accordingly, the Lives of Thousands may be Spared, the Happiness of millions Secured and the Peace of the World preserved: if not, they will be plunged into a Sea of Blood. The War, which is almost gorged, between Britain and America, will extend itself to all the maritime Powers, and most probably afterwards to all the Inland Powers, and like the thirty years War of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, will not end, but by a general Resettlement of Interests, according to the Spirit of the new System, which has taken Place. Why may not all this be done, by a Congress, of all Nations, before, as well as after the War?  
The final Settlement of Power, at a Peace, is never in Proportion to the Success of Arms. It depends upon the Interposition of Parties, who have not meddled in the War, but who come to the Treaty of Peace, brought forward by Intrigue, with the Aid of Jealousy, and counteract by Negotiation the Envied Effects of Arms.  
The Britons have forced the present system into Establishment, before its natural Season. They might have Secured the Attachment of the Plantations for years to come: but it was a principal part of the Plan of the confidential Counsellors, in a general Reformation of the Kings Government, to reform the Constitutions of America. They were informed it would lead to War, but they thought it would be a good measure to force the Americans to Arms. Conquest of which they were sure, would give them the right of giving what Constitutions they thought fit, Such as that of Quebec, little foreseeing what a War it would prove, and Still less Suspecting, that France and Spain, and all the rest of the World, would interpose.  
None of the Powers of Europe, and few of the most knowing Politicians have considered, what Effect this Revolution will have on the general System of Europe. (Note. Here it Should Seem, Governor Pownal is mistaken. Every Power in Europe, and every great Politician in Europe, except those in Great Britain, have digested this Subject.)  
One Thing is certain, that on whatever Ground the War between G. Britain and Bourbon began, whatever course it may take, however long they may continue it, to their mutual destruction, the Americans will never belong to either Foedere inaquali. The Powers of Europe who will become Parties, before these affairs come shall have been brought to the Issue will concur, in no other Settlement, than that these States are an independant Sovereign Power, holding a free Commerce equally with all.  
In order to Shew how these matters will finally be Settled, he proposes to lay before, the Sovereigns, a View of Europe and America, and point out, what will be the natural Effects of the Seperation of them, and of the Independence of America, upon the commercial and political State of Europe; and finally to Shew how, the present Crisis, may be, by Wisdom and Benevolence, wrought into the greatest Blessing of Peace, Liberty and Happiness, which the World hath yet Seen.  
He then proceeds to compare, the new and old World, in Point of Spirit, Magnitude and Power. In measuring the Magnitude of States too much is commonly ascribed, to Extent of Country and Fertility of Soil. That Extent of Dominion, which is most capable of a Systematical Connection and Communication, has the most natural Greatness. The three other Parts of the World, are naturally Seperated from each other, and altho, once under the dominion of the Romans, as this was an unnatural Exertion, beyond the Resources of human nature, it Soon dissolved, and they Seperated. Europe, Asia, and Africa, are not only Seperated by their local Positions but are inhabited by distinct Species of the human Being. North and South America, are, in like manner naturally divided. North America is possessed, by Englishmen, and this natural Circumstance forms this division of America into one great Society, the Basis of a great Dominion. There is nowhere in Europe So great and combined an Interest, communicating through So large a Territory, as that in North America. The northern and Southern Parts of Europe, are possessed by different nations, actuated by different Sovereignties and Systems. Their Intercourse is interrupted: they are at perpetual Variance. Intercourse is difficult over Land, and by Sea. They are cutt off, by intervening nations. On the contrary, when North America is examined, you find every Thing united in it, which forms Greatness. The nature of the coast and the Winds renders communication by navigation perpetual. The Rivers open an Inland navigation, which carries on a Circulation through the whole. The Country thus united, and one part of it, communicating with another, by its Extent of Territory, and Variety of Climates, produces all that nature requires, that Luxury loves, or that Power can employ. All those Things, which the Nations of Europe, under every difficulty, that a defect of natural communication, under every Obstruction that a perverse artificial System throw in their Way, barter for; are in North America possessed, with an uninterrupted natural Communication, an unobstructed navigation and an universal Freedom of Commerce, by one Nation. The naval Stores, Timber, Hemp, Fisheries, and Salt Provisions of the North; the Tobacco, Rice, Cotton, Silk, Indigo, Fruits and perhaps Wines, Resin and Tar, of the South, form a Reciprocation of Wants and Supplies. The Corn, Flour, Manufactures &amp;c. of the middle States, fill up the Communication and compleat its System. They unite those Parts, which were before connected, and organize the Several Parts, into one whole.  
Civilization, next to Union of System and Communication of Parts constitute, what Lord Bacon calls, the Amplitude and Growth of State. The Civilization of America, may be compared to that of Europe. It is Superiour to that of Europe. Architecture, Painting, Statuary, Poetry, oratory, and the mechanick Arts are not So well understood and practiced nor are the Sciences, those of Government and Policy particularly, So learnedly mastered by any Individual in America, as they are by Some in Europe. But Arts, Sciences, Agriculture, Manufactures, Government, Policy, War, and Commerce, are better understood by the Collective Body of the People in America than they are by that of Europe, or any nation in it. And this is the only Way of Stating the Comparison of Civilization, and in this Respect America is infinitely further removed from Barbarity, than Europe.  
  
Translation of the Memorial to the Sovereigns of Europe upon the present State of Affairs between the old and the new World, into common Sense, and intelligible English, continued.  
When the Spirit of Civilization began first in Europe, after the barbarous Ages of the northern Invaders; the Clergy were the blind Leaders to Light, and the feudal Lords, the Patrons of Liberty. What Knowledge! What Liberty! The Instruction of the first was more pernicious than Ignorance. The Patronage of the last was the Benevolence of the Grazier, who fattens his Cattle for the Profit of their Hides and Tallow. The People held their Knowledge, as they did their Lands, by a servile Tenure, which did not permit them to Use it as their own. Such was the Source of Civilization in Europe.  
The first movement of Civilization, is the application of Labour to the Culture of the Earth, in order to raise that Supply of food, which is necessary for Men in Society. The application of Labour to Architecture, Cloathing, Tools and Instruments is concomitant with this. Marketts, in which a Reciprocation of Wants and surplusses, is accomplished, Succeed. Hence arise by a farther Improvement Artificers and Manufacturers: and in succession, a surplus is created beyond what is wanted by the Individuals or the Community, which produces Commerce, by exchanging this surplus for Articles of Conveniency, or Enjoyment, which the Country does not produce. By the Violence of the military Spirit, under which Europe was a second Time peopled, the Inhabitants were divided into two Classes, Warriours and Slaves. Agriculture, was conducted by the latter; Wretches annexed to, not owners of the Soil; degraded Animals! Cattle! Property! Not Proprietors! They had no Interest in their own Reason, Labour or Time. They had neither Knowledge nor Motive to make an Effort of Improvement. Improvement in Agriculture, was therefore many hundred Years at a Stand. Altho in Some Countries of Europe it may Seem at present progressive, it is so slow, that for Ages, it can have no great Effect, except perhaps in England, yet even here the Farmer is absurdly and cruelly oppressed. Manufactures, or the Labour of Men, in Wool, Iron, Stone, or Leather, were held as the Servile offices of Society, and fit only for Slaves. These Artificers were mere Machines of the most arrogant and ignorant Masters. They would never make Experiments—so that Mechanicks and Arts went on for Ages without Improvements.  
Upon the Dissolution of the Hanseatick League, the Sovereigns, who had Seen the Power, which arose from manufactures and Trade, began to encourage their Subjects and invite Strangers, to establish them. Civilization took a momentary Start. But the Policy of the Sovereigns, held the Manufacturers in a wretched Condition, by many obstructing Regulations. The same Policy affecting to encourage Manufactures, gave them a false help, by Setting assizes on the Produce of Land, which oppressed Agriculture. This Same System of Policy, confined Ingenuity, by making imposing Regulations, on every motion of Manufactures, on their coming from the Hand of the Workman; on the Carriage; on the Sale; on the Return, whether in goods or Money. This Policy was directed to draw into the Treasury of the State, all the Profit beyond the Labourers Subsistance. Commercial Legislation was directed wholly, to make the subject Sell, but not buy: export Articles, but import money of which the State must have the greatest share. Hence exclusive Property of certain materials of manufacture, which they called Staple Commodities—hence monopolies—exclusive Priviledges of Trade, to Persons, Articles and Places; exclusive Fisheries; hence the notions of the Ballance of Trade: and hence the whole Train of Retaliations, Restraints on Exportation; Prohibitions of Importation; alien Duties, Imposts. Having thus rendered Communication among themselves almost impracticable, they were forced to look out for foreign Settlements. Hence Colonies, which might be worked like out Farms for the exclusive Benefit of the Metropolis. Hence that wildest of all the wild Visions of Avarice and Ambition, the Attempt to render the Ocean an Object of Property; the Claim of Possession in it, and dominion over it. Thus Civilization was obstructed, the Spirit of Improvement checked, and the Light of Genius extinguished. Events may arise, which may induce, the Rulers of Europe, to revise and reform the hard Conditions of its Imprisonment, and give it Liberty.  
In America, all the Inhabitants are free, and allow universal naturalization to all that wish to be so, and a perfect Liberty of using any mode of Life they choose, or any means of getting a Livelihood, that their Talents lead them to. Their Souls are their own. Their Reason is their own. Their Time is their own. They are their own Masters. Their Labour is employed on their own Property, and what they produce is their own. Where every man has the free and full Exertion of his Powers, and may acquire any Share of Profit or Power that his Spirit can work him up to, there is an unabated Application; and a perpetual Struggle of Spirits, sharpens the Wit, and trains the Mind. The Acquisition of Knowledge in Business, necessary to this mode of Life, gives the Mind a Turn of Investigation, which forms a Character peculiar to these People. This is called Inquisitiveness, which goes often to ridicule, but is in matters of Business and Commerce an usefull Talent. They are animated with the Spirit of the New Philosophy. Their Life is a Course of Experiments; and Standing on as high Ground of Improvement as the most enlightened Parts of Europe have advanced, like Eaglets commence the first Efforts of their Pinnions from a Towering Advantage.  
In Europe the poor mans Wisdom is despized. The poor mans Wisdom is not Learning but Knowledge of his own Picking up, from Facts and nature, by Simple Experience. In America, the Wisdom and not the Man is attended to. America is the Poor Mans Country. The Planters there reason not from what they hear, but from what they See and feel. They follow what mode they like. They feel that they can venture to make Experiments, and the Advantages of their Discoveries are their own. They therefore try what the Soil claims, what the Climate permits, and what both will produce to the greatest Advantage. In this Way, they have brought into Cultivation, and Abundance of what no Nation of the old World ever did, or could. They raise not only plenty and Luxury for their internal Supply, but the Islands in the West Indies have been Supplied from their Superabundance, and Europe, in many Articles has profited of it. It has had its Fish from their Seas: its Wheat and Flour from one Part: its Rice from another part: its Tobacco and Indigo from another: its Timber and naval Stores from another. Olives, oranges and Wines are introducing by Experiments.  
This Spirit of Civilization first attaches itself to mother Earth, and the Inhabitants become Land Workers. You See them labouring at the Plough and the Spade, as if they had not an Idea above the Earth yet their minds are all the while enlarging all their Powers, and their Spirit rises as their Improvements advance. Many a real Phylosopher, Politician and Warriour, emerges out of this Wilderness, as the Seed rises out of the Ground.

t could at that moment be made. The Fact was, that at that period, Quantities of English Gold Coin, to a great Amount, were actually imported into England in bulk; and yet this was no mark of any Sudden Change of a Ballance of Trade in favour of that Country. The Ballance of Trade reckoned by this false Rule, has been always Said to be against North America: but the Fact is, that their Government, profiting of a Credit arising from the progressive Improvements, and advancing Commerce of the Country hath, by a refined Policy, established a Circulation of Paper money, to an Amount that is astonishing. That from the immense quantity, it should depreciate, is nothing to this argument, for it has had its Effect. The Americans therefore can Spare their Gold and Silver as well as England, and Information Says, there is now locked up in America, more than three millions of English money, in Gold and Silver, which when their Paper is annihilated, will come forth. The Efflux, therefore of Gold and Silver, is no Proof of a Ballance against them: on the contrary, being able to go without Gold and Silver, but wanting other Articles without which they could not proceed in their Improvements, in Agriculture, Commerce, or War, the Gold and silver is, in Part hoarded, and part exported for these Articles. In Fact, this objection, which is always given as an Instance of Weakness in America, under which, she must Sink, turns out, in the true State of it, an Instance of the most extensive Amplitude and Growth of State. It would be well for England, if, while She tryumphs over this mote in her Sisters Eye, She would attend to the Beam in her own, and prepare for the Consequences of her own Paper Money.  
From this Comparison of the State of Civilization, applied to Agriculture, Mechanicks and Commerce, extended through a large Territory, having a free Communication through the whole, it appears, that North America has advanced, and is every day advancing, to a Growth of State, with a constant and accellerating motion, of which there has never been any Example in Europe.  
To be continued.  
Translation of the Memorial to the Souvereigns of Europe, continued.  
The two Countries may be compared, in the Progress of Population. In North America Children are a Blessing. They are Riches and Strength to the Parents. In Europe, Children are a Burden. The Causes of which have been explained in the observations concerning the Increase of

 Progress of Population, in the ordinary course advanced in a Ratio, between that of Virginia and that of Massachusetts Bay. The City of Philadelphia advanced more rapidly. It had in 1749—2076 Houses. In 1753—2300. In 1760—2969. In 1769—4474. From 1749 to 1753 from 16 to 18,000 Inhabitants; from 1760 to 1769 from 31,318 to 35,000. There were in 1754 various Calculations and Estimates made of the Numbers on the Continent. The Sanguine made the Numbers, one million and an half. Those who admitted less Speculation into the Calculation, but adhered closer to Facts and Lists, Stated them at one million, two hundred and fifty thousand. The Estimate Said to be taken in Congress in 1774 makes them 3,026,678. But there must have been great Scope of Speculation in that Estimate. Another after two or three years of War is Two Million Eight hundred and Ten Thousand. 2,141,307 would turn out nearest to the real amount in 1774. But what an Amazing Progress, which in 18 years has added a million to a million two hundred and fifty thousand, altho a War was maintained in that country for seven years of the Term. In this View one sees a Community unfolding itself beyond any Example in Europe.  
But the Model of these Communities, which has always taken Place, from the Beginning, has enrolled, every Subject as a Soldier, and trained a greater Part or 535,326 of these People to Arms, which number the Community has, not Seperate from the civil, and formed into a distinct Body of regular Soldiers, but remaining united in the internal Power of the Society, a national Piquet Guard, always prepared for defence. This will be thought ridiculous by the regular Generals of Europe: But Experience hath evinced, that for the very Reason, that they are not a Seperate Body, but members of the Community, they are a real and effectual Defence. The true Greatness of a State consists in Population, where there is Valour, in Individuals, and a military Disposition in the Frame of the Community: where all, and not particular Conditions and degrees only, make Profession of Arms, and bear them in their Country’s defence.  
This Country is now an independent State, and has been avowedly and compleatly so, for more than four Years. It is indeed Six years, Since it was so in Effect. It hath taken its equal Station among the Nations. It is an Empire, the Spirit of whose Government, extends from the Center to the extream Parts. Universal Participation of Council, creates Reciprocation of universal Obedience. The Seat of Government, will be well informed of the State and Condition of the remote and extream Parts, which by Participation in the Legislature, will be informed and Satisfied in the Reasons and necessity of the Measures of Government. These will consider themselves as acting in every Grant that is made, and in every Tax imposed. This Consideration will give Efficacy to Government, that Consensus Obedientium, on which the permanent Power of Empire is founded. This is the Spirit of the new Empire in America. It is liable to many disorders, but young and Strong, like the Infant Hercules it will Strangle these Serpents in the Cradle. Its Strength will grow with Years. It will establish its Constitution and perfect Growth to Maturity. To this Greatness of Empire, it will certainly arise. That it is removed Three thousand miles from its Ennemy; that it lies on another Side of the Globe, where it has no Ennemy: that it is Earth born and like a Giant ready to run its Course, are not the only Grounds, on which a Speculatist may pronounce this. The fostering Care with which the Rival Powers of Europe will nurse it, ensures its Establishment, beyond all doubt or danger.  
When a State is founded on such Amplitude of Territory; whose Intercourse is So easy; whose Civilization is So advanced; where all is Enterprize, and Experiment: where Agriculture has made So many discoveries of new and peculiar Articles of Cultivation: where the ordinary Produce of Bread Corn, has been carried to a degree, that has made it a Staple Export, for the Supply of the old World: whose Fisheries are mines, producing more Solid Riches than all the Silver of Potosi: where Experiment hath invented so many new and ingenious Improvements in mechanicks: where the Arts, Sciences, Legislation and Politicks, are Soaring with a Strong and Extended Pinion; where Population has multiplied like the Seeds of the Harvest: where the Power of these numbers, taking a military Form, shall lift itself up as a young Lion: where Trade of extensive orbit, circulating in its own Shipping, has wrought these Efforts of the Community to an active Commerce: where all these Powers have united and taken the Form of Empire; I may Suppose I cannot err, or give offence to the greatest Power in Europe, when upon a Comparison of the State of Mankind and of the Powers of Europe, with that of America, I venture to Suggest to their Contemplation, that America is growing too large for any Government in Europe to manage as subordinate. That the Government of Congress and the States is too firmly fixed in the Hands of their own Community to be either directed by other Hands, or taken out of those, in which it is. And that the Power in Men and Arms is too much to be forced, at the distance of Three Thousand miles. Were I to ask an Astronomer whether, if a Satellite Should grow, untill it could ballance with its Planet, whether it could be held any longer, by any of the Powers of nature in the orbit of a Satellite, and whether any external Force could keep it there, he will answer me directly, no. If I ask a Father, after his Son is grown up to full Strength of Body, Mind and Reason, whether he can be held in Pupillage, and will Suffer himself to be treated and corrected as a Child, he must answer, No. Yet, if I ask an European Politician, who learns by Hearsay and thinks by Habit, whether North America will remain dependent, he answers, Yes. He will have a Thousand reasons why it must be So, altho Fact rises in his Face to the very contrary. Politicians, instead of being employed to find out Reasons to explain Facts, are often employed with a Multitude about them, to invent and make Facts according to predetermined Reasonings. Truth, however, will prevail. This is not Said to prove, but to explain the Fact, So that the Consequences may be Seen. The present Combination of Events, whether, attended to or not, whether wrought by Wisdom into the System of Europe or not, will force its Way there, by the Vigour of natural causes. Europe, in the course of its commerce, and even in the internal order and Oeconomy of its communities, will be affected by it. The Statesman cannot prevent its Existence, nor resist its operation. He may embroil his own Affairs, but it will become his best Wisdom, and his duty to his Sovereign and the People, that his measures coincide and cooperate with it.  
The first Consequence of this Empire, is, the Effect it will have as a naval Power on the Commerce, and political System of Europe.  
Whoever understands the Hanseatic League, and its Progress, in naval Power, by possessing the commanding Articles of the Commerce of the World; the command of the great Rivers; its being the Carrier of Europe; that it could attract, resist and even command the landed Powers; that it was made up of Seperate and unconnected Towns, included within the dominions, of other States; that they had no natural communication, and only an artificial Union: whoever considers, not only the commercial but naval and political Power, which this League established throughout Europe, will See, on how much more Solid a Basis, the Power of North America Stands; how much faster it must grow, and to what an Ascendancy of Interest, carrying on the greatest Part of the Commerce, and commanding the greatest Part of the Shipping of the World, this great commercial and naval Power must Soon arrive. If the League, without the natural Foundation of a political Body, in Land, could grow by commerce and navigation to such Power: if, of Parts Seperated by nature and only joined by Art and Force, they could become a great political Body, acting externally with an Interest and Power, that took a lead and even an Asendancy, in Wars, and Treaties. What must North-America, removed at the Distance of half the Globe, from all the Obstructions of Rival Powers, founded in a landed Dominion peculiarly adapted for

 in their Trade, and for a Settlement of the Forms, on which they may carry it, on, with them. America, will then become, the Arbitress of the Commercial, and perhaps as the Seven united Belgic Provinces were in the Year 1647 the Mediatrix of Peace, and of the political Business of the World.  
If North America follows the Principles on which nature has established her; and if the European Alliances Which She has made do not involve her in and Seduce her to, a Series of Conduct, destructive of that System, which those Principles lead to, She must observe, that as nature hath Seperated her from Europe, and established her alone on a great Continent, far removed from the old World, and all its embroiled Interests, and wrangling Politicks, without an Ennemy or a Rival or the Entanglement of Alliances.—1. that it is contrary to her Interest, and the Nature of her Existence, that She Should have any Connections of Politicks with Europe, other than merely commercial; and even, on that Ground, to observe inviolably the caution of not being involved, in either the Quarrells, or the Wars of Euro­peans. 2. That the real State of America is, that of being the common Source of Supply to Europe in general, and that her true Interest is therefore, that of being a free Port to all Europe at large, and that all Europe, at large, Should be the common market for American Exports. The true Interest therefore of America, is, not to form any partial Connections with any Part, to the Exclusion of the rest. If England had attended to her true Interest, as connected with that of America, She would have known that it is the Commerce, and not the Conquest of America by which she could be benefited: and if She would even yet, with temper listen to her true Interest, She would Still find, that that Commerce, would in a great measure continue, with the Same benefit, were the two Countries as independent of each other as France and Spain, because in many Articles, neither of them can go to a better market. This is meant as under their present habits and Customs of Life. Alienation may change all this.  
The first great leading Principle will be that North America, will become a free Port to all the nations of the World, indiscriminately; and will expect, insist on, and demand, in fair Reciprocity, a free market in all those nations with whom She trades. This will, if She forgets not, nor forsakes her real nature, be the Basis of all her commercial Treaties. If She adheres to this Principle, She must be in the course of Time, the chief Carrier of the commerce of the whole World, because unless the Several Powers of Europe, become to each other, likewise free Ports and free marketts, America alone will come to and act there, with an ascendant Interest, that must command every Advantage to be derived from them.  
The Commerce of North America, being no longer, the Property of one Country only, her Articles of Supply will come freely, and be found now in all the Marketts of Europe: not only moderated by, but moderating the Prices of the like Articles of Europe. The Furs and Peltry will meet those of the North East Parts of Europe; and neither the one nor the other can any longer be estimated by the Advantages to be taken of an exclusive Vent. Advantages of this Kind, on Iron and naval Stores, have frequently been aimed at by Sweeden: and the Monopoly in them was more than once used as an Instrument of Hostility against England, which occasiond the Bounties on those articles, the Growth of America, which gave rise to the Export of them from America. When they come freely to the European Market co-operating with the Effect which those of Russia have, will break that monopoly. For Russia, by the Conquest of Livonia, and the Advancement of her Civilization has become a Source of Supply in these Articles, to a great Extent. All Europe by the Intervention of this American Commerce, will find the good Effects of a fair Competition, both in Abundance of Supply, and in moderation of Price. Even England who hath lost the Monopoly, will be no great Looser. She will find this natural Competition as advantageous to her, as the Monopoly, which in Bounties and other Costs of Protection, She paid so dear for.  
Translation &amp;c. continued.  
Ship building and navigation having made Such Progress in America, that they are able to build and navigate cheaper, than any Country in Europe, even than Holland with all their Oeconomy, there will arise a Competition in this Branch of Commerce. There will also be a Competition in the marketts of Europe, in the Branch of the Fisheries. The Rice and Corn, which the Americans have been able to export, to an amount that Supplied in the European Markett, the defect arising from Englands withholding her Exports will, when, that Export Shall again take Place, keep down depressed, the Agriculture of Portugal and Spain and in Some measure of France, if the Policy of those countries does not change the Regulations, and order of their internal Oeconomy. The particular Articles, to be had as yet from America only, which Europe So much Seeks after, will give the Americans the Command of the Markett in those Articles, and enable them, by annexing assortments of other Articles, to produce those also, with Advantage in these marketts. The Refuse Fish, Flour, Maize, Meat, Live Stock, Lumber &amp;c. all carried in American Shipping to the West India Islands: the African Slaves, carried by a circuitous Trade, in American Shipping also to the West India Marketts: taking from thence the Molasses: aiding those Islands with American shipping in the Carriage of their produce, must ever command, and have the Ascendancy, in that Part of the World, if this ascendency even Stops here. The cheap manner, in which the Americans produce their Articles of Supply: the Low Rates, at which they carry them to Europe, Selling also their shipping there: the Small profits at which their Merchants are used to Trade, must lower the Price of the like Articles in Europe: oblige the European Merchants to be content with a less Profit: occasion Some reform in the Oeconomy of Europe, in raising and Police in bringing to Markett, the active Articles of Supply. But further, the Americans by their principle of being a free Port in America and having a free Markett in Europe; by their Policy of holding themselves, as they are remote from all the wrangling Politicks, So neutral in all the Wars of Europe: by their Spirit of Enterprize, in all the quarters of the Globe, will oblige the nations of Europe to call forth within themselves Such a Spirit, as must entirely change its commercial System also.  
But will a People whose Empire Stands Singly predominant, on a great Continent, who before they lived, under their own Government, had pushed their Spirit of Adventure in Search of a North West Passage to Asia, Suffer in their Borders the Establishment of Such a Monopoly as the European Hudsons Bay Company? Will that Spirit which has forced an extensive Commerce in the two Bays of Honduras and Campeachy, and on the Spanish main, and which has gone to Falkland’s Islands in Search only of Whales, be Stopped at Cape horn, or not pass the Cape of Good Hope? It will not be long, after their Establishment as an Empire, before they will be found trading in the South Sea and in China. The Dutch will hear of them in Spice Islands, to which the Dutch can have no Claim, and which those Enterprizing People will contest, on the very ground, and by the very Arguments, which the Dutch used to contest the Same Liberty against Portugal. By the Intercourse and correspondance, which there will be between Europe and America, it will be as well known, as Europe. By Attention, to the Winds, Currents, the Gulph Stream and its Lee Currents, the Passage will be better understood, and become shorter. America will Seem every day to approach nearer and nearer to Europe. When the Alarm which the Idea of going to a Strange and distant Country, gives to a Manufacturer or Peasant, or even a Country Gentleman, Shall thus be worn out; a thousand Attractive motives respecting a Settlement in America will raise a Spirit of Adventure, and become the irresistable Cause of a general Emigration to that World. Nothing but Some future, wise and benevolent Policy in Europe, or Some Spirit of the Evil one, which may mix itself in the Policy of America can prevent it. Many of the most usefull Enterprizing Spirits, and much of the active Property will go there. Exchange hath taught the Statesmen of the World long ago, that they cannot confine money: and the Governments of Europe, must fall back to the Feudal Tyranny, in which its own People are locked up, and from which all others are excluded, or Commerce will open a Door to Emigration.  
These Relations of Things; these Leges et Foedera Rerum are forming the new System. The Sublime Politician, who ranges in Regions of predetermined Systems—the Man of the World, narrowed by a selfish Experience, worse than Ignorance, will not believe: and it is but Slowly, that nations relinquish any System, which hath derived Authority from Time and Habit. These Sovereigns of Europe, who have despized the awkward Youth of America, and neglected to form Connections, and interweave their Interests with these Rising States, will find the System of this new Empire, obstructing and Superseding the old System of Europe, and crossing all their maxims and measures. They will call upon their Ministers Come curse me this People, for they are too mighty for me. The Spirit of Truth will answer How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? How shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied? From the Top of the Rock, I See them, and from the Hills, I behold them. Lo! the People shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. On the contrary those Sovereigns, who Shall See Things as they are, and form, if not the earliest, yet the most Sure and natural Connections with America, as an independent State; as the Market of and a free Port to Europe: as that being which must have a free Markett in Europe, will become the principal leading Powers in Europe, in regulating the Courses of the rest, and in Settling the common Center of all.  
England is the State in those Circumstances, and in that Situation. Similar modes of living and thinking, Manners, and Fashions, Language and Habits, all conspire naturally to a Rejunction by Alliance. If England would treat America, as what She is, She might Still have the ascendency in Trade and navigation: might Still have a more Solid and less invidious Power than that Magni Nominis Umbra with which she braves the whole World. She might yet have an active leading Interest among the Powers of Europe. But She will not. As though the Hand of divine Vengeance was upon her, England will not See the Things which make for her Peace! France, who will be followed by other nations, acknowledging these States to be what they are, has formed Alliances, with Terms of perfect Equality and Reciprocity. And behold the Ascendant to which She directly arose, from that politick Humiliation. There never was a wiser or a firmer Step taken by any established Power, than that which the new States took for their first Footing in this Alliance. There never was more Address, Art, or Policy Shewn by any State, than France has given Proof of, in the Same, when both agreed and became allied on Terms, which exclude no other Power, from enjoying the Same Benefits by a like Treaty. Can it be Supposed that other States, conceiving that the exclusive Trade of England to America is laid open, will not desire, and have their Share? They certainly will. Here then are the Beginnings of Changes in the European System.  
There are two Courses, in which this general Intercourse of Commerce, between Europe and North America, may come into operation: one, by particular Treaties of Commerce the other by all the maritime States of Europe, previous to their engaging in a War or upon the general settlement of a Peace, meeting in Some Congress, to regulate among themselves as well as with north America; the Free Port, on one Hand, and the free Markett on the other, as also general Regulations of Commerce and navigation, Such as must Suit this free Trader, now common to them all, indifferently, and without Preference. Such Regulations, must exclude all Monopoly of this source of Supply and course of Trade, and So far make an essential Change in the commercial system. Such Regulations, not having Reference only to America, but reciprocal References, between all the contracting Parties, trading now, under different Circumstances, and standing towards each other in different Predicaments, must necessarily change the whole of that System in Europe.  
The American will come to Markett in his own ship, and will claim the Ocean as common: will claim a navigation restrained by no Laws, but the Laws of nations, reformed as the rising Crisis requires: will claim a free Markett, not only for his Goods but his ship, which will make a Part of his Commerce. America being a free Port to all Europe, the American will bring to Europe not only his own peculiar Staple Produce, but every Species of his produce which the Markett of Europe can take off: he will expect to be free to offer to Sale in the European Markett, every Species of wrought materials, which he can make to answer in that markett: and further as his Commerce Subsists, by a circuitous Interchange with other Countries, whence he brings Articles not Singly for his own Consumption, but as exchangeable Articles, with which he trades in foreign Marketts; he will claim as one of the Conditions of the free Markett, that these foreign Articles, as well as his own Produce, Shall be considered as free for him to import in his own shipping to such Market. Those States who refuse this at first, Seeing others acquiesce in it, and Seeing also how they profit by having Articles of Supply and Trade, brought so much cheaper to them, will be obliged, in their own defence, and to maintain their Balance in the commercial World, to accede to the Same Liberty. Hence again, even if the American should not, by these means, become the ascendant Interest in the carrying Trade and in shipping and Seamen, a most essential Change, must arise in the European System.  
The American raises his produce and navigation cheaper, than any other can: his Staples are Articles which he alone can Supply. These will come to market assorted with others, which he thus can most conveniently Supply; and unless the Same freedom of Trade which he enjoys, be reciprocally given and taken by the European Powers, among each other, he will come to the European market, on Terms, which no other can: but Europe will be affected, benefited, and improved by his manner of trading. The peculiar Activity of the Americans, will raise a Spirit and Activity among those, who come to the Same market. That peculiar Turn of Character, that Inquisitiveness, which in Business animates a Spirit of Investigation to every Extent, and the minutest detail, enables them to conduct their dealings in a manner more advantageous, than is usually practised by the European Merchant. They acquire a Knowledge not only of the Marketts of Europe, that is of the Wants and Supplies, how they correspond, and of their relative Values; but they never rest, till they are possessed of a Knowledge of every Article of Produce and Manufacture, which comes to those Marketts; untill they know the Establishments, the operations and the Prices of Labour, and the Profits made on each, as well, even better, than the Merchants of the Country themselves. A little before the War, Several of the American Merchants, especially those of Pensilvania, Sending some of their own Houses to England, became their own Factors, went immediately to the Manufacturers in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Sheffield; to the woolen Manufacturers in Yorkshire, and Lancashire: to those of Liverpool, and those in the West: and opened an immediate Trafick with them at the first hand. This Same Spirit of Investigation and Activity, will activate their dealings in every other Country of Europe. The Effect of this, instead of being disadvantageous to those Countries, will become a general Blessing; by raising a more general Competition, and diffusing a more proportional Share of Profit, between all Ranks of the industrious. While Trade is Solely in the Hands of the Merchant he bears hard on the Purchaser, by his high Profit, and oppresses the Manufacturer by the little share he allows him. The merchant grows rich and magnificent, makes a great Bustle and Figure. It can never be well where Merchants are Princes. The more the Merchant can make by high Profit, the less quantity will he carry to markett. Whereas when Commerce Shall be free, and by the Mixture of this American Spirit, trade run with fair Competition in a broad Channell, the Merchant must make his Way by being content with small profit, and by doing a deal of Business, on those Small Profits. The Consumer and Manufacturer will come nearer together—the one will Save an unreasonable Advance, and the other obtain a more equal Share of Profit. More Work will be done: The Profits of Industry more equally distributed—The Circulation will Spread through the lesser Vessells, and Life, Health, and Growth be promoted.  
If these operations take this Course, it will be needless to point out to the Shrewd Speculations of the Merchants, what their Conduct must necessarily be. But it will behove Statesmen, to be aware that they do not Suffer the Merchant to perswade them, that the Commerce is languishing merely because there is not the Same Parade of Wealth, in such dazzling Instances. Let them look to the Marketts of Supply, and See if there is not plenty. Next to the rude produce, which is the Basis of manufactures, and enquire, whether, while more and more Industry, is daily called forth, it is not employed, and more adequately paid, by a free and extended Vent? While the Numbers and Ingenuity of Manufacturers increase they do not all live more comfortably, so as to have and maintain increasing Families? Whether Population does not increase? Let them in future guard against the exclusive Temper of Trade. The political Founders of the old System, were totally ignorant of this Principle of Commerce. It was W

Instead of being an equal Communication, concentring the Enjoyments of all Regions and Climates, and a Consociation of all nations, in one Communion of the Blessings of Providence; when actuated as it has been by a Selfish Principle, it hath been to the nations an occasion of Jealousies, alternate depressions of each others Interests, and a never ceasing Source of Wars, perhaps they may also See that Treaties of Peace have been but Truces and Guarrantee

lthough Pride will not open Prudence will connive at; through which the Intercourse of Marketts finds every Year, a freer Vent; and that the active Spirit of Commerce is like the Spirit of Life, diffusing itself through the whole Mass of Life Europe. They will find there is an End of all their monopolizing Systems: They will See that any one of the Powers of Europe, who would aim to deal with the rest of mankind, with an unequal Ballance, will only find, that they have raised among their Neighbours a Jealousy, that will conspire to wrest that false Ballance out of their Hands, and to depress them down again to a level with the rest of the World. The Cities of Italy, the low Countries, Portugal, Holland, England, have all, for their Period, as commercial Powers, arisen above the common Level, but pressing, with a Weight which was felt as unequal by those below them, they have each in its Turn found, even in the moment of their highest Elevation, a general Rising all around them, and themselves Sinking to the common Level. Statesmen must See, how much it is the Interest of all, to liberate each other, from the Restraints, Prohibitions, and Exclusions, by which they have aimed to depress each other. They will See, that the most advantageous Way, which a landed nation can take, to encourage and multiply Artificers, Manufacturers and Merchants of their own, is to grant the most perfect Freedom, to the Artificers, Manufacturers, and merchants of every other nation. That a contrary Practice lowers the Value of their own internal Productions, by raising the Prices of all Things, which must be bought with them; and gives to the Artificers, Manufacturers and Merchants a monopoly against their own Farmers. Seeing this, they will encourage Population, and an universal Naturalization, and Liberty of Conscience.

e a Congress, before they are engaged in further Hostilities; before the devastation of War, extends Ruin and Misery yet farther. Some Such measure, as led the great trading Bodies of Europe to convene in a Congress, which gave rise to the Hanseatic League, is not out of the Course of public Business but is what the nature of the present Crisis, in a more than ordinary Necessity requires. Whether Some general Council, on the Model of that concerted between the Great Henry of France and Elizabeth of England, two as noble Spirits and as wise Politicians as the World hath Since Seen, Should not now be proposed; not indeed a Council of Administration, for regulating and conducting a general political System of all Europe but a Council of Commerce for Europe and North America, exclusive of every Point of Politicks.  
Such a Council might prevent future Occasions of War, from commercial Quarrells. The present vague State of the marine Law of Nations, Seems to be Such, as creates a necessity of Such a measure. At present, all Principle, Rule, and Law, Seem to be as much lost as if the nations were fallen back to the old State of Piracy under their old Barbarism. Europe cannot, even in War, go on under the present Abrogation of all Treaties, and all the Laws of Nations.  
The Cardinal Points which will come under Deliberation, will be 1. how far, in Right and Policy, it may be best for all to establish the Mare liberum. And how far each nation, providing for the Property and Dominion, which they hold in Bays and Harbours, may accede to this Establishment, as a Law of Nations. 2. How far the universal Jus navigandi, may be established. 3. This will lead to Deliberation on the Libertas universalis Commerciorum; free Ports; and free Marketts. It will be best by degrees to abolish all Port Duties, and raise their Revenues by Excise, Tailles &amp;c. and other internal Sources of Finance, immediately laid on the Consumer. This Measure would make that Country which adopted it a free Port, a Circumstance very desirable to every well wisher to his Country.

but by a general re ſettlement of intereits, ac-

has taken place. Why may not all this be done,

The final ſettlement of power, at a Peace, is  
never. in proportion to the ſucceſs of arms. It  
depends upon the interpoſition of parties, who  
have not meddled in the war, but who come to  
the treaty of peace, brought forward by intrigue,  
by the aid of jealouſy, and counteract by W 3 771

The Britons bave forced the preſent ſyſtem in  
to eſtabliſhment, before its natural ſcaſon. They  
might have ſecured the attachment of the Planta-  
tions for years to come: but it was a principal  
part of the plan of the confidential counſellors,  
in a general reformation. of the king&#x27;s govern-  
ment, to reform the conſtitutions of America.  
They were informed it would lead to war, but  
they thought it would be a good meaſure to force  
the Americans to arms. Conqueſt of which they  
were ſure, would give them the right of giving  
what conſtitutions they thought fit, ſuch as that  
of Quebec, little forcſeeing what a war it would  
prove, and ſtill leſs ſuſpecting, that France and.

One thing is certain, that on whatever ground  
the war between Great Britain and Bourbon be-  
gan, whatever courſe it may take, during what-  
ever length of time they may continue it, to their  
mutual deſtruction, the Americans will never be-  
long to either federe ineguali. The powers of  
Europe who will become parties, before theſe -  
affairs ſhall have been brought to the iſſue will  
concur, in no other ſettlement, than that theſe  
ſtates are an independent ſovereign power, hold-  
  
ing a free commerce equally with all, |  
  
In order to ſhew how theſe matters will nally  
be ſettled, he propoſes to lay before the Sove-  
reigns a view of Europe and America, and point  
out, what will be the natural effects of the ſepa-  
ration of them, and of the independence of Ame-  
rica, upon the commercial and political ſtate of  
Europe; and finally, to ſhew how the preſent  
crifis may be, by wiſdom and benevolence,  
wrought into the greateſt bleſſing of peace, li-  
berry — W which the world hath *  
ſeen.  
  
Be ches n to compare the 0d ey new  
world, in point of Spirit, Magnitude, and Power.  
In meaſuring the magnitude of States too much  
is commonly aſcribed to extent of country and  
fertility of foil. That extent of dominion which  
is moſt capable of a ſyſtematical connection and  
communication has the moſt natural greatneſs,  
The three other parts of the world are naturally  
  
ſeparated

ſeparated from each other, and although, once  
under the dominion of the Romans, as this was  
an unnatural exertion, beyond the reſources of  
human nature, it ſoon diſſolved, and they ſepa-  
rated. Europe, Aſia and Africa are not only  
ſeparated by their local poſitions, but are inhabited  
by diſtinct ſpecics of the human Being. North  
and South America are, in ike manner, naturally  
divided. North America is poſſeſſed by Engliſh-  
men, and this natural circumſtance forms this di-  
viſion of America into one great Society, the baſis  
of à great Dominion. There is no where in Eu-  
rope ſo great and combined an intereſt, commu-  
nicating through ſo large a territory, as that in  
North America. The northern and ſouthern  
parts of Europe are poſſeſſed by different nations,  
actuated by different ſovereignties and ſyſtems.  
Their intercourſe is interrupted: they are at per-  
  
al variance. Intercourſe is difficult over land  
and by fea. They are cut off by intervening na-

forms&#x27;greatneſs. The nature of the coaſt and the  
winds render communication by navigation per-  
petual. The rivers open an inland navigation  
  
  
The country, thus united, and one part of it

ſeſſed, with an uninterrupted natural communica-  
ton, an unobſtructed navigation and an univerſal

Tbe firſt movement of Civilization is the ap-  
  
  
order to raiſe that ſupply of food which is ne-  
ceſſary for men in ſociety. The application of  
labour co Architecture, Cloathing, Took and In-  
ſtruments is concomitant with this. Markets, in  
which-a reciprocation of wants and ſurpluſſes is  
accompliſhed, ſucceed. Hence ariſe by a farther  
improvement Artificers and Manufacturers: and,  
in ſucceſſion, a ſurplus is created beyond what is  
** by the individuals or by the commu-  
  
* &quot; nity,

nity; which produces commerce, by exchanging this  
ſurplus either for articles of conveniency, or for  
enjoyment, which the country does not produce. By  
the violence of the military ſpirit,” under which  
Europe as a ſecond time peopled, the inhabi-  
tants were divided into two claſſes, Warriors and  
  
  
graded animals I cattle | property] not proprietors!  
They had no intereſt either in their own reaſon, their  
labour, or their time. They had neither knowledge,  
nor motive to make an effort of improvement.  
Improvement in Agriculture was, therefore, during  
many hundred years, ata ſtand. Although in ſome  
countries of Europe it may ſeem at preſent pro-  
greſſive, it is ſo ſlow, that, for ages, it can have  
no great effect, except perhaps in England, yet  
even here the farmer is abſurdly and cruelly op-  
preſſed. Manufactures, or the labour of men,  
in wood, iron, ſtone; ur lrather were conſidered  
as the ſervile offices of ſociety, and fit only for  
ſlaves, | Theſe: artificers- were mere machines of  
the moſt. arrogant and ignorant maſters. They  
would never make experiments; ſo that mecha-  
nics and arts went on for ages without improve-

Upon the diſſolution of the Hanſeatic League,

aroſe from manufactutes and trade, began to en-  
courage their ſubjects and invite ſtrangers, to  
E C. _ eſtabliſh  
  
eſtabliſh them. Civilization took a momentary  
ſtart. But the Policy of the Sovereigns held the  
manufacturers in a wretched condition, by many  
obſtructing regulations. The ſame policy, affect  
ing to encourage manufacturers, gave them a falſe  
help, by ſetting Aſſizes on the produce of land,  
which oppreſſed agriculture. This ſame ſyſtem  
of policy confined ingenuity, by making impoſing  
regulations on every motion of manufactures, on  
their coming from the hand of the workman ; on  
the carriage; on the ſale; and on the return, whether  
in goods or in money. This policy was directed to  
draw into the treaſury of the ſtate all the profit,  
beyond the labourers ſubſiſtence. Commercial  
legiſlation was directed wholly to make the ſub-  
je ſell, but not buy: export articles, but import  
money, of which the ſtate muſt have the greateſt  
ſhare. Hence, cxcluſive property of certain ma-  
terials of manufacture, which they called Staple  
Commodities; hence, monopolies; excluſive pri-  
vileges of trade to perſons, articirs and places;  
excluſive Fiſheries; hence, the notions of the Ba-  
lance of Trade: and hence, the whole train of re-  
taliations, reſtraints on exportation; prohibitions  
of importation ; alien duties, impoſts. Having  
thus rendered&#x27; communication among themſelves  
almoſt impracticable, they were forced ro look  
out for foreign ſettlements. Hence, colonies,  
which might be worked like out farms for the  
excluſive benefit of the metropolis. Hence, that  
wildeſt  
  
En  
wildeſt of all the wild viſions of avarice and am-  
dition, the attempt to render the ocean an object  
of property; the claim of poſſeſſion in it, and  
dominion over it. I hus civilization was obſtruct-  
ed, the ſpirit of improvement checked, and the  
light of genius extinguiſhed. Events may ariſe,  
  
which may induce, the Rulers of Europe, to re.  
  
vile and reform the hard conditions of its impsi-  
ſonment, and give it Liberty.  
  
In America, all the = &gt; 00G are fo and  
allow univerſal naturalization to all that wiſh to  
be fo, and a perfect liberty of uſing any mode of  
life they chooſe, or any means of getting a liveli-  
hood that their talents lead them to. Their fouls  
are their own, Their reaſon is their own. Their  
time is their own. They are their own maſters.  
Their labour is employed on their own property,  
and what they produce is their own. Where every  
man has the free and full exertion of his powers,  
and may acquire any ſhare either of profit or of  
power that his ſpirit can work him-up to, there  
is an unabated application; and a perpetual ſtrug-  
gle of ſpirits ſharpens the wit and trains the  
mind. The acquilition of knowledge in bulineſs,  
neceſſary to this mode of life, gives the mind a  
turn of inveſtigation which forms a character pe-  
culiar to theſe people. This is called inquiſitive-  
neſs, which goes often to ridicule, but is in mat-  
ters of buſineſs and commerce an uſeful talent.  
They are animated with the ſpirit of the New  
C 2 Phi-  
  
Philoſophy. Their life is a courſe of experts  
ments; and ſtanding on as high à ground of im-  
provement as the moſt enlightened parts of Eu-  
rope, they have advanced like Eaglets, they com-  
mencing the firſt efforts of the it pinions from a  
towering advantage.  
  
In Europe the poor man&#x27;s viſdom is de ſpiſctil.  
The poor man&#x27;s wiſdom is nor L.carning bur

they like. They feel that they can ventute 10  
make experiments, and the advantages af their  
diſcoveries ate their o n. They therefore try  
what the ſoil claims, what the climate permits,  
and what both will produce to the greate ſt ad-  
vantage. In this way, they have brought into  
cultivation an abundance of what no nation of the  
old World ever did, or could imroduce. T hey:raile

that, at that period, quantities of Engliſh gold  
coin, to a great amount, were actually imported  
into England in bulk; and yet this was no mark  
of any ſudden change of a balance of trade in  
favour of that country. The balance of trade,  
reckoned by y this falſe rule, has been always ſaid  
to be againſt North America: but the fact is, that  
their government, profiting by a credit ariſing  
from the progreſſive improvements and advanc-

ſilver as well as England, and information ſays,

 progreſs of population,  
in the ordinary courſe advanced in a Ratio, be-  
tween that of Virginia and that of Maſſachuſet&#x27;s  
Bay. The city of Philadelphia advanced more  
rapidly. It had in 1749, 2,076 houſes. In 1753,  
2, 300; in 1760, 2,969; in 1769, 4,474 ; from  
1749 to 1753, from 16 to 18, oo inhabitants;  
from 1760 to 1769, from 31,318 to 33, ooo.  
There were in 1754 various calculations and eſti-  
mates made of the numbers on the continent.  
The ſanguine made the numbers one million and  
an half. Thoſe who admitted leſs ſpeculation into  
the calculation, but adhered cloſer to facts and  
liſts, ſtated them at one million, two hundred and  
fifty thouſand, The eſtimate ſaid to be taken in  
Congreſs, in 1774, makes them 3,026,678. But  
there mult have have been great ſcope of ſpecu-

lation in that eſtimate. Another, after two years  
war, is two millions, eight hundred and ten thou-  
ſand, Two millions, one hundred and forty- one  
thouſand, three hundred and ſeven, would turn  
out neareſt the real amount in 1774. What an  
amazing progreſs! which in eighteen years has  
added a million to a million, two hundred and  
fifty thouſand, although a war was maintained in  
that country for ſeven years of the term. In  
Point of view we perceive a community unfolding | f  
itſelf beyond any example in Europe.  
Zzut the model of theſe communities, which  
has always taken place, from the beginning, has  
enrolled every ſubject as a ſoldier, and trained a  
greater part, or 535,326 of theſe people to arms,  
which number the community has, not ſeparate  
f from the civil, and formed into a diſtin body of  
N regular ſoldiers, but remaining united in the in-  
| L &quot;7 FM 3 ternal power of the ſociety, a national Piquet

| be thought ridiculous by. the regular Generals of  
Europe: but experience hath evinced, that for  
34 {- the very reaſon, that they are not a ſeparate body,

it was ſo in effect. It hath taken its equal ſtation  
among the nations. It is an empire the ſpirit of  
whoſe government extends from the centre to the  
extteme parts. Univerſal participation of council  
ercates reciprocation of univerſal obedience. The  
Scat of Government will be well informed of the

It will eſtabliſh its conſtitution and perfect growth

certainly ariſe. That it is removed three thouſand

When a ſtate is founded on hoch amplitude of

I venture to ſuggeſt to their contemplation, that  
America is growing too large, for any govern-  
ment in Europe to manage as ſubordinate. That  
the government of Congreſs and the States is too  
firmly fixed in the hands of their on commu-  
nity to be either directed by other hands, or  
taken out of thoſe in which it is: and that the  
power in men and arms is too much to be forced  
at the diſtance of three thouſand miles. Were I  
to aſk! an Aſtronomer, whether, if a Satellite  
ſnould grow, until it could balance with its planet,  
it could be holden any longer by any of the  
powers of nature in the orbit of a, Satellite;  
and Whether any external force could keep it  
there, he would anſwer me directly, Noe. If 1  
aſk a Father, when his fon is grown up to full  
ſtrength of body, mind and reaſon, whether he  
can be kept forcibly in pupillage, and will ſuffer |  
himſelf to be treated and corrected as a child, he  
  
muſt anſwer, No. {Yer, if 1 aſk an European  
politician, ho learns by | hearſay, and thinks h  
habit, Whether North America will remain depen-  
dent, he anſwers, Yes. He will have a thouſand  
teaſons why it muſt be ſo, although fact riſes. in

the fact, ſo that the conſequences may be ſeen.  
The preſent combination of events, whether at-  
tended to or diſregarded, whether wrought by  
wiſdom into the ſyſtem of Europe, or fooliſhly  
neglected, will force its way there by the vigour  
  
  
commerce, and even in the internal order and  
ceconomy of its communities, will be affected by  
it. The Stateſman cannot prevent its exiſtence,  
nor reſiſt its operation. He may embroil his own  
affairs, but it will become his beſt wiſdom, and  
his duty to his Sovereign and the people, that his  
— coincide and co-operate with it.  
The firſt conſequence of this empire, is, the

an aſcendant intereſt, that muſt command every  
benefit that can reſult from them.  
  
- The commerce of North America, being no  
longer the property of one country only, her ar-  
ticles of ſupply will come freely, and be found  
now in all the markets of Europe: not only mo-  
derated by, bur moderating the prices of the like  
  
meet thoſe of the north-eaſt parts of Europe;  
and neither the one nor the other can any longer  
be eſtimated by the advantages to be taken of an  
excluſive vent. Advantages of this kind, on iron  
and naval ſtores, have frequently been aimed at  
by Sweden: and the monopoly in them was more  
than once uſed as an inſtrument of hoſtility againſt  
  
  
articles, the growth of America, which gave riſe  
  
  
they come freely to the European market, co-  
  
have, they will break that monopoly. For Ruſſia,  
by the conqueſt of Livonia, and the advance ment  
. of her civilization, has become a ſource of ſupply  
in theſe articles, to a great extent. All Europe,  
by the intervention of this American commerce,  
will find the good effects of a fair competition,  
both in abundance of ſupply, and in moderation  
of price. { Even England, ho hath loſt the mo-  
nopoly, will be no * looſer. She will find  
this  
  
  
  
—  
  
this natural competition as advantageous to her,  
as the monopoly, which, in bounties and other  
coſts of protection, ſhe paid ſo dear for.) |  
  
Ship- building and navigation having made ſuch  
progreſs in America, that the natives are able ro  
build and navigate cheaper than any country in  
  
  
  
  
nomy, there will ariſe a competition in this branch  
  
  
the markets of Europe, in the branch of the  
Fiſheries. - The Rice and corn, which the Ameri-  
cans have been able to export, to an amount that  
ſupplied in the markets the defect ariſing from  
England&#x27;s withholding her exports will, when  
that export ſhall again take place, keep down de-  
preſſed the agriculture of Portugal and Spain,  
and, in ſome meaſure, of France, if the policy  
of thoſe countries does not change the regulations  
and order of their internal ceconomy. The par-  
ticular articles to be bad as yet from America  
only, which Europe ſeeks ſo much after, will give  
the Americans the command of the market in  
thoſe markets, and enable them, by annexing aſ-  
ſortments of other articles, to produce thoſe alſo  
with advantage in theſe markets. The refaſe Fith,  
Flour, Maize, Live Stock, Lumber, &amp;c. all car-  
ried in American &#x27; ſhipping to the Weſt-India  
iſlands: the African ſlaves, carried by a citcuitous  
  
markets: taking from thence the molaſſes: aiding

E

riage of their produce, muſt ever command and

: duce their articles of ſupply : the low rates at  
Which they carry them to Europe, felling allo _  
1 their ſhipping there: the ſmall profits at Which

Europe, in raiſing and pelfeenn bringing to mar-  
  
Wer dhe ative articles of ſupply. But farther,  
| ide Americans, by their principle of being a free  
——_ port in America and having a free market in Eu-  
- rope; by their policy in holding themſelves, as  
  
they are remote from all the wrangling politics,  
  
ſo neutral in all the wars of Europe: by their  
  
ſpirit of enterprize, in all the quarters of the  
  
F. globe, will oblige the nations of Europe to call  
forth within themſelves ſuch a ſpirit as muſt en-  
  
  
But will a people whoſe empire ſtands ſingly  
© predominant on a great continent, who, before  
— they lived under their own government, had  
  
puſhed their ſpirit of adventure in ſearch of a  
— North-Weſt paſſage to Aſia, ſuffer in their borders  
the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a monopoly as the Eu-  
ropean Hudſon&#x27;s Bay company? will that ſpirit  
\ which

which has forced an extenſive commerce in the  
two Bays of Honduras and Campeachy, and on  
the Spaniſh Main, and which has gone to Falk-  
  
  
  
at Cape Horn, or not paſs the Cape of Good Hope?  
It will des de long, after their eſtabliſnment as an  
Empire, before they ll; be found trading to the  
South Ses and in China? The Dutch will hear  
  
  
people will conteſt on the very ground and by the  
  
  
the ſame liberty againſt Portugal. By the int  
courſe and correſpondence, which there will be  
  
between Europe and America, it will be as well  
known as Europe. By attention to the winds,  
currents, the Gulph ſtream and its Lee; currents,  
the paſſage will be better underſtood and become  
ſhorter, America will ſeem: every day to ap-  
proach nearer and nearer to Europe. When the

Many

(2):  
  
Many of the moſt -uſeful enterpriſing ſpirits and  
much of the active property will go there. Ex-  
change hath taught the ſtateſmen of the world  
long ago that they cannot confine money : and  
the government of Europe muſt fall back to the | |  
x Feudal Tyranny in which its own people are  
bdbocked up, and from which all others are exclud-  
ed, or commerce will open&#x27;a door to emigration.  
Theſe relations of things, theſe Leges et Fædera  
Rorum are forming the new ſyſtem. The ſublime  
politician, who ranges in regions of predeter- {  
mined ſyſtems ; fie man of the world, narrowed  
by a ſclfiſh experience, worſe than ignorance, will  
not believe . and it is but lowly that nations re-  
linquiſh any ſyſtem which hath derived authority  
from time and habit. Thoſe ſovereigus of Eu-  
rope; who- have deſpiſed the aukward youth of  
America, and neglected to form connections, and  
- nterweave their intereſts with theſe: riſing ſtares, .  
will find the ſyſtem of this new empire obſtructing  
and ſuperſeding the old ſyſtem of Europe, and  
croſſing all their maxims and meaſures, They  
vill call upon their miniſters, Come! curſe me this 8  
people; for they are ius mighty for me. The ſpirit  
of truth will anſwer, How fball I curſe, whom  
GOD bath not curſed ? Hou ſpall T defy, whom the  
LORD&#x27; bath not defied? From the top of the rock 1

if not the earlieſt, yet the moſt ſure and natural  
connections with America, as an independent  
ſtate; as the market of, and a free pott to Eu-  
rope: and as being that which muſt have a free  
market in Europe, will become the principal lead-  
ing powers in Europe, in regulating the courſes  
of the reſt, and in ſettling the common centre of  
England is the tate in theſe circumſtances, and  
in that ſituation. Similar modes of living and  
thinking, manners and faſhions, language apd  
habits all conſpire naturally to a rejunction by  
alliance. If England would treat America as  
what ſhe is, ſhe might till have the aſcendency in  
Trade and Navigation; might ſtill have a more  
ſolid and leſs invidious power than that Magni  
Nominis Umbra, with which ſhe braves the whole  
world. She might yet have an active leading in-  
tereſt among the powers of Europe. But ſhe  
will not !-— 4s though the Hand of Divine Vengeance  
  
were upon ber, England will not ſee the things which  
make for her peace! France, who will be followed  
by other nations, acknowledging theſe ſtates to be  
what they are, has formed alliances, with 4erms of  
perfelt Equality and Reciprocity. And behold the  
aſcendant to which ſhe directly aroſe, from that  
politic humiliation. There never was a wiſer or a  
firmer ſtep taken by any eſtabliſhed power, than  
that which the new ſtates took for their firſt foot-

ing io &gt; rh alliance. {There never was more ad-  
dress, art,, or policy neun by any ſtate than  
1 France has given proof of in the ſame, when  
—— both agreed and became allied on terms, which  
exclude no other power from enjoying the ſame be-  
nefits by a like treaty |. Can it be ſuppoſed that  
other ſtates, conceiving that the excluſive trade  
of England to America is laid open, will not de-  
— fire and have their ſhare! They certainly will.  
_ then are ihe beginnings of changes in the Euro-  
  
— bean ſtem. _ 621 .. ana 101.  
— SThete are two courſes in which this general ir in-  
tercourſe of comer tween Europe and North  
America may come into operation; one, by par-  
  
  
maritime ſtates of Europe, previous to their en-  
gaging in a war, or ypon the general ſettlement  
of a peace, meeting in ſome Congreſs, to regulate  
among themſelves, as well as with North Ame-  
rica, the Free Port, on one hand, and the Free  
Market, on the other, as alſo general regulations  
of commerce arid navigation, ſuch as mult ſuit  
this free Trader, now common to them all, in-  
differently, and without preference. Such regu-  
tions muſt exclude all monopoly of this ſource  
  
— &gt; ſupply and courſe of Trade, and ſo far make  
8 an eſſential change in the commercial ſyſtem.

America, bur reciprocal” references between all  
the comrativg parties crading now, under diffe-

rent circumſtances, 2nd ſanding towards each  
other in different pregicaments} &#x27; muſt Hecellarily  
change the whole of that ſtem in Europe.  
  
The American will come to market in his own  
ſhip, and will claim the ocean as common: will  
claim a navigation reſtrained by no laws, but the  
laws of nations, reformed as the xiſing crilis te-  
quires: will claim a free marker, not only for his  
goods, but his_ſhip, which will make a part of  
his commerce. America being a free port to all  
Europe, the American will bring to Europe  
not only his on peculiar ſtaple produce,” but  
every ſpecies of his produce, which the mar-  
ker of Europe can take off: he will expect to be  
  
  
ſpecies of wrought materials, which he can make  
  
  
merce ſubſiſts, by a circuitous interchange with  
other countries, whence he brings articles not  
ſingly for his own conſumption, but as exchange-  
able articles, with which he trades in foreign mar-  
kets, he will claim as one of the conditions of  
the free market, that theſe foreign articles, as well  
as his own produce, hall be conſidered as free for  
him to import in his own ſhipping to ſuch mar-  
ket. Thoſe ſtates who refule this at firſt, ſeeing  
others acquicſce in it, and ſeeing allo how they  
profit by having articles of ſupply, and trade  
brought ſo much cheaper to them, will be ob-  
  
liged, in their own defence, and io maintain theis

The American raiſes his produce and navigation  
cheaper than any other can: his ſtaples are articles  
which he alone can ſupply. Theſe will come to  
market aſſorted with others, which he thus can  
  
  
freedom of trade which he enjoys be reciprocally

ket on terms which no other can: but Europe will  
be affected, beneſited and improved by his man-  
ner of trading. The peculiar activity of the  
Americans-will-raiſe a ſpirit and activity in thoſe  
who come to the ſame market, That peculiar

merchant. They acquire a knowledge not only  
  
and ſupplies, how they correſpond, and of their  
relative values; but they never reſt till they are  
poſſeſſed of a knowledge of every article of pro-  
  
  
markets; until they know the eſtabliſhments, the  
operations  
  
  
  
- :  
  
the merchants of the country themſelves. Not  
long before the war ſeveral of the American mer-  
chants, eſpecially thoſe of Penſylvania, ſending  
ſome of their own houſes to England, became  
their own factors, went immediately to the ma-  
nufacturers in Birmingham, Wolverhampton and  
Sheffield; to the woollen manufacturers in York-  
ſhire and Lancaſhire: to thoſe of Liverpool and  
thoſe of the Weſt; and opened a traffic with  
them at the firſt hand. This ſame ſpirit of in-  
veſtigation and activity ill actuate their dealings  
in every other country of Europe. The effect of  
this, inſtead of being diſadv us to thoſe  
countries, will became a. general, bleſſing, by  
raiſing a more general competition, diffu-  
ſing a more proportional ſhare of profit be-  
tween all ranks of the induſtrious. While trade  
is Tolely in the hands of the merchant he  
bears hard on the purchaſer, by his high  
profit, and oppreſſes the manufacturer by the  
little ſhare he allows him. The merchant grows  
rich and magnificent, makes a great buſtle and  
figure. It can never be well where merchants are  
  
  
ker, Whereas when commerce ſhall be free, and  
by the mixture of this American ſpirit, trade run  
with fair competition in a broad channel, the  
merchant muſt make his way by being content

tain a more equal ſhare of profit. More work  
will be done: the profits of induſtry more equally

Some ſuch meaſure as led the great trading bodies

riſe to the Hanſeatic league, is not out of the  
courſe of public buſineſs, but is what the nature
