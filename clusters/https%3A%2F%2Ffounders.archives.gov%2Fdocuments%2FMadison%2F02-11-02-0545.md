entlemen,  
Department of State May 17th. 1806.  
  
I herewith inclose a Commission and letters of Credence authorizing you to treat with the British Government concerning the maritime wrongs which have been committed, and the regulation of Commerce and navigation, between the parties. Your authority is made several as well as joint, as a provision for any contingency depriving either of the co-operation of the other.  
The importance of the trust is evinced by its being made the occasion of an extraordinary mission, as well as by the subjects which it embraces. And I have great pleasure in expressing the confidence which the President feels in the prudence and talents to which the business is committed.  
It is his particular wish that the British Government should be made fully to understand, that the United States are sincerely and anxiously disposed to cherish good will and liberal intercourse between the two nations, that an unwillingness alone to take measures not congenial with that disposition has made them so long patient under violations of their rights and of the rules of a friendly reciprocity, and that when forced at length by accumulating wrongs to depart from an absolute forbearance, they have not only selected a mode strictly pacific, but in demonstration of their friendly policy, have connected with the measure, an extraordinary mission, with powers to remove every source of difference, and even to enlarge the foundations of future harmony and mutual interest.  
  
There can be the less ground of umbrage to the British Government in the act prohibiting the importation of certain articles of British manufacture, 1. because there is nothing in the face of the Act beyond a mere Commercial regulation, tending to foster manufactures in the United States, to lessen our dependence on a single nation by a distribution of our trade, and to substitute for woolens and linens, manufactures made from one of our principal agricultural Staples, 2. because it is far short of a reciprocity with British exclusions of American articles of export, 3. because as a Commercial measure discriminating in time of war, between British and other nations, it has examples in British practice. It deserves attention also that a discrimination was made, and under another name, still exists in the amount of convoy duty imposed on the trade between Great Britain with Europe, and with America, 4. because the measure can not be ascribed to a partiality towards the enemies of Great Britain, or to a view of favoring them in the war; having for its sole object the interest of the United States, which it pursues in a mode strictly conformable to the rights and the practice of all Nations.

s of British manufactures.  
In fine the Act may truly be represented as so far from derogating from the amicable dispositions of the United States towards Great Britain, that it has resulted solely from the inefficacy of their protracted and reiterated endeavors otherwise to obtain a just redress, and from a hope that an appeal, in this peaceable form, to the reflections and interest of an enlightened nation, would be more successful in removing every obstacle to a perfect and permanent cordiality between the two nations.  
The instructions given to Mr. Monroe January 5th. 1804, having taken into view, and being still applicable to, a great proportion of the matter now committed to your joint negotiations, it will be most convenient to refer  
  
you to those instructions, as your general guide; and to confine the present, to the alterations and additions which a change of circumstances, or a contemplation of new objects may require.  
The first article of the project comprized in the instructions of 1804, relates to the impressment of Seamen. The importance of an effectual remedy for this practice derives urgency from the licenciousness with which it is still pursued, and from the growing impatience of this Country under it. So indispensable is some adequate provision for the case, that the President makes it a necessary preliminary to any stipulation requiring a repeal of the Act shutting the market of the United States against certain British manufactures. At the same time he authorizes you, in case the ultimatum as stated in the Article above referred to, should not be acceptable to the British Government, to substitute one in the terms following. “No Seaman nor Sea-faring person shall upon the high Seas, and without the jurisdiction of either party, be demanded or taken out of any Ship or Vessel, belonging to the Citizens or Subjects of one of the parties, by the public or private armed Ships or men of war belonging to or in the service of the other party: and strict orders shall be given for the due observance of this engagement.”  
An article in these terms was, with the acquiescence of Lord Hawkesbury and Mr. Addington, concerted between Mr. King and Ld. St. Vincents, on the approaching renewal of the late war: It was frustrated by an exception of the narrow Seas inserted by Lord St. Vincents; an exception so evidently inadmissible both in principle and in practice, that it must have been intended as a pretext for evading the stipulation at that time. Perhaps the present Ministry may neither be disposed to resort to such a pretext, nor unwilling to avail themselves of the precise sanction, as far as it was given, by their predecessors.  
With respect to contraband which is the subject of the 4th. Article, it may be observed that as it excludes naval stores from the list, and is otherwise limited to articles strictly military, it must if admissible to Great Britain, leave but feeble objections to an abolition of contraband altogether. In the present state of the arts in Europe, with the intercourse by land, no nation at war with Great Britain can be much embarrassed by leaving those particular articles subject to maritime capture. Whilst belligerent nations therefore have little interest in the limited right against contraband, it imposes on neutrals all the evils resulting from suspicions and vexatious searches, and from questions incident to the terms used in the actual enumeration. It is not an unreasonable hope therefore, that in place of this article, an entire abolition of contraband may be substituted. Should this be found unattainable, it may be an improvement of the Article as it stands, to subjoin, for the sake of greater caution, to the positive enumeration, a negative specification of certain articles, such as provisions, money, naval Stores &amp;c, as in no case to be deemed within the meaning of the article; with a proviso, that the  
  
specification shall not be construed to imply in the least, that any article not specified in the exception, shall, on that account, be liable to be drawn into question.  
A doctrine has been latterly introduced by the British Courts and at length adopted by the instructions of June 1803, to British Cruisers, which regards contraband conveyed in one voyage as affecting a resumed or a return voyage, although the contraband shall have been previously deposited at its port of destination. It will be a further improvement of the article, to insert a declaratory clause against this innovation and the abuses incident to it.  
The 4th. Article, besides the stipulation on the subject of contraband, relates to two other Subjects; 1. that of free Ships free goods, 2. that of a trade with enemies Colonies.  
1. With respect to the first, the principle that a neutral flag covers the property of an enemy, is relinquished, in pursuance of the example of the Russian Treaty, on which the article is modelled; the relinquishment however being connected with and conditioned on, the provision required in favor of the neutral right to the Colonial Trade. The importance of that principle to the security of neutral Commerce, and to the freedom of the Seas, has at all times been felt by the United States; and although they have not asserted it as the established law of Nations, they have ever been anxious to see it made a part of that law. It was with reluctance of course that a contrary stipulation was authorized, and merely as a mean of obtaining from Great Britain the recognition of a principle now become of more importance to neutral nations possessing mercantile Capital, than the principle of “free Ships free goods.” It is to be particularly kept in view therefore that such a contrary stipulation is to be avoided if possible; and, if unavoidable, that the stipulation be so modified as to interfere as little as possible with the spirit and policy of any provisions in favor of the principle which may be likely to be introduced into a treaty of peace among the present belligerent powers of Europe. Should it be known that Russia, as well as France, means to insist on such a provision, and that such a stipulation by the United States, however modified, will materially affect her confidence and good will towards them, the objection to the measure will acquire a force that can yield only to the consideration that without such a sacrifice the provisions for the security of our Seamen, and of our neutral commerce can not be obtained, and that the sacrifice will effectually answer those purposes. 2. The vast importance of the Colonial Trade, with the circumstances and the excitement which have taken place since the date of the original instructions to Mr. Monroe, will require that the neutral right on this subject be provided for in an appropriate article, and in terms more explicit than are used in the article under review. As the right in this case, turns on the general principle, that neutrals may lawfully trade, with the  
  
exceptions of blockades and contraband, to and between all ports of an enemy, and in all articles, although the trade shall not have been open to them in time of peace, particular care is to be taken, that no part of the principle be expressly or virtually abandoned, as being no part of the law of nations. On the contrary it is much to be desired that the general principle in its full extent, be laid down in the stipulation; but as this may not be attainable and as too much ought not to be risked by an inflexible pursuit of abstract right, especially, against the example and the sentiments of great powers having concurrent interests with the United States; you are left at liberty, if found necessary, to abridge the right in practice, as it is done in the supplement of October 1801, to the treaty of June of that year, between Russia and Great Britain; not omitting to provide that in case Great Britain should by her Treaties or instructions leave to any other nation the right in a greater extent than it is stipulated to the United States, they may claim the enjoyment of it in an equal extent.  
The abuses which have been committed by Great Britain under the pretext that a neutral trade, from enemy Colonies, through neutral ports, was a direct trade, render it indispen[s]able to guard against such a pretext by some express declaration on that point. The most that can be conceded on the part of the United States is, that the landing of the goods, the securing the duties, and the change of the Ship, or preferably, the landing of the goods alone, or with the securing the duties, shall be requisite to destroy the identity of the voyage and the directness of the trade; and that the ordinary documents of the Custom House Officers, shall be sufficient evidence of the facts or fact.  
A satisfactory provision on this subject of a trade with enemy Colonies, is deemed of so much consequence to the rights and interests of the United States, and is so well understood to have been contemplated along with a like provision against the impressment of Seamen, in the late act of Congress prohibiting the importation of certain classes of British manufactures, that, as was enjoined with respect to the provision against impressment, no stipulation is to be entered into not consistent with a continuance of that Act, unless the provision with respect to the Colonial trade be also obtained.  
In remodelling the provision with respect to the Colonial Trade, you may with great propriety urge the distinction between the West India Colonies, and the very distant ones in the East Indies and elsewhere; and the reasonableness of limiting to the former, the exception of the direct trade with their parent Countries, out of the general neutral right. The distinction is supported by several considerations, particula[r]ly by the greater difficulty, in the case of the more distant Colonies, of previously knowing, and eventually proving, the regulations as they may have actually stood in time of peace, and by the ruinous delays and expences attending the judicial  
  
investigations. The British Courts have in fact admitted the distinction so far as to presume the lawfulness of the neutral trade with the East India Colonies, as being generally open in peace as well as war; whilst they reverse the presumption with respect to the West Indies.  
In addition to what is proposed on the subject of blockades in VI and VII. articles, the perseverance of Great Britain in considering a notification of a blockade, even of an intended blockade, to a foreign Government, or its Minister at London, as a notice to its Citizens, and as rendering a Vessel wherever found, in a destination to the notified Port as liable to Capture, calls for a special remedy. The palpable injustice of the practice, is aggravated by the auxiliary rule prevailing in the British Courts, that the blockade is to be held in legal force, until the Governmental notification be expressly ⟨resc⟩inded, however certain the fact may be that the blockade was never formed or had ceased. You will be at no loss for topics to enforce the inconsistency of these innovations with the law of nations, with the nature of blockades, with the safety of neutral commerce; and particularly with the communication made to this Government, by order of the British Government in the year 1804; according to which the British Commanders and Vice Admiralty Courts were instructed, “not to consider any blockade of the Islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe as existing unless in respect of particular ports, which may be actually invested, and then not to capture Vessels bound to such ports, unless they shall previously have been warned not to enter them.”  
The absurdity of substituting such Diplomatic notifications in place of a special warning from the blockading Ships, cannot be better illustrated than by the fact, that before the notification of a proposed blockade of Cadiz in the year 1805 was received here from our Minister at London, official information was received from Cadiz, that the blockade had actually been raised, by an enemy’s fleet.  
It may be worth your attention, that a distinction has been admitted, by the British prize Courts in consideration of the distance of the United States from the European blockades, between their Citizens and those of States less distant, the notice required for the former being more positive than is made necessary for the latter. You will be able to avail yourselves in the discussion, and perhaps in the modification of the article, of the reasons on which such a distinction rests.

.  
There remains, as an object of great importance, some adequate provision against the insults and injuries committed by British Cruisers in the vicinity of our Shores and harbours. These have been heretofore a topic of remonstrance, and have in a late instance, been repeated with circumstances peculiarly provoking, as they include the murder of an American Seaman within the jurisdictional limits of the United States. Mr. Monroe is in full possession of the documents explaining a former instance. Herewith will be received, those relating to the late one. They not only support a just demand of an exemplary punishment of the Offenders, and of indemnity for the spoliations, but call for some stipulations guarding against such outrages in future. With this view it is proper that all armed belligerent Ships should be expressly and effectually restrained from making seizures or searches, within a certain distance from our Coasts, or taking stations near our harbours commodious for those purposes.  
In defining the distance protected against belligerent proceedings, it would not perhaps be unreasonable, considering the extent of the United States; the shoalness of their coast, and the natural indication furnished by the well defined path of the Gulf stream, to expect an immunity for the space between that limit and the American Shore. But at least it may be insisted that the extent of the neutral immunity should correspond with the claims maintained by Great Britain, around her own territory. Without any particular enquiry into the extent of these, it may be observed, 1. that the British Act of Parliament in the year 1736. 9G. 2. C. 35. supposed to be that called the Hovering Act assumes for certain purposes of Trade, the distance of four leagues from the Shores, 2. That it appears both in the Reign of James I. and of Charles II, the security of the Commerce with British Ports, was provided for by express prohibitions against the roving or hovering of belligerent ships so near the neutral harbours and Coasts of Great Britain as to disturb or threaten Vessels homeward or outward bound; as well as against belligerent proceedings, generally, within an inconvenient approach towards British Territory.  
With this example, and with a view to what is suggested by our own experience, it may be expected that the British Government will not refuse to concur in an article to the following effect.  
  
“It is agreed that all armed Vessels belonging to either of the parties engaged in war shall be effectually restrained by positive orders and penal provisions from seizing, searching or otherwise interrupting or disturbing vessels to whomsoever belonging &amp; whether outward or inward bound, within the Harbours, or the chambers formed by head-lands, or any where at Sea within the distance of four leagues from the shore, or from a right line from one head land to another. It is further agreed that by like orders and provisions all armed Vessels shall be effectually restrained by the party to which they respectively belong, from stationing themselves, or from roving or hovering so near the entry of any of the harbours or Coasts of the other, as that Merchantmen shall apprehend their passage to be unsafe, or a danger of being set upon and surprized; and that in all cases where death shall be occasioned by any proceeding contrary to these stipulations, and the offender cannot be conveniently brought to trial and punishment under the laws of the party offended, he shall on demand made within    months be delivered up for that purpose.”  
If the distance of four leagues cannot be obtained, any distance not less than one sea league may be substituted in the article. It will occur to you that the stipulation against the roving and hovering of armed Ships on our Coasts, so as to endanger or alarm trading Vessels, will acquire importance in proportion as the space entitled to immunity shall be narrowed.  
Another object not comprehended in the instructions of 1804, to Mr. Monroe, is rendered important by the number of illegal captures and injuries, which have been committed by British Cruisers since that date. An indemnity for them is due on every consideration of justice and friendship, and is enforced by the example heretofore given by Great Britain herself, as well as by other nations which have provided by Treaty for repairing the spoliations practised under colour of their authority. You will press this as an object too reasonable not to be confidently expected by the United States. Many of the claims indeed for indemnification are so obviously just, that a refusal to satisfy them, can not be decently made, and ought not therefore to be presumed.  
The two modes most readily presenting themselves for a comprehensive provision for the claims, are first the establishment of a Board analogous to that provided for in the 7th. Article of the Treaty of 1794: Secondly the substitution of a gross sum to be distributed among the claimants according to a liquidation to be made under the authority of the United States.  
The second is the mode most eligible, if the gross sum to be allowed, be thought to approach the amount of losses to be indemnified. To assist you in estimating these the statements addressed to this Department by the Underwriters and others are herewith transmitted. These statements, with those furnished by Mr. Lyman to Novr. 1st. will be to be reduced  
  
according to the redress which shall have been judicially afforded; and on the other hand to be augmented by the addition of cases not reported here, and to be collected from the sources of information within your own reach.  
If the first mode should be adopted, great care will be requisite in describing the cases, to employ such general terms as will comprehend all that are fairly entitled to redress. It will be well at the same time to secure, by specifying such of the cases, as can be specified, and as are least susceptible of objection. Under this head may be classed, 1. cases in which the Official communication made by Lord Hawksbury to Mr. King of the 11th. day of April 1801, has been violated. 2. cases in which the rules of blockade stated in Mr. Merry’s communication to the Department of State on the 12th. day of April 1804. have been violated, 3. cases where the Territorial jurisdiction of the United States has been violated. The list of neutral rights asserted in the report of the Secretary of State to the President on the 25th. day of Jany. 1806 will suggest other specifications which may be attempted. It may be worth recollecting that the British order of Council bearing date the 24th. June 1803, and subjecting to capture Vessels on a return Voyage, which had carried contraband in the outward voyage, was never promulged, nor was it known that such a rule was to be enforced until the summer of 1805. Could the rule be regarded otherwise than as it certainly is, an innovation on the law of Nations, all captures before it was made known, and contrary to antecedent practice, would be marked by an unjust surprize, fairly entitling them to redress.  
The business to come before such a board may be much diminished by the reference of cases, particularly of costs and damages and such others whose description by common consent entitles them to redress, to the Kings Advocate and an advocate to be named on your part (Dr. Laurence for example) who may be authorized to report the sums due, subject to the approbation in each case of Mr. Lyman, our Agent. As far as the cases fall within the observation here made, a liquidation of them may be carried on during the period of negotiation.  
Altho’ the subject of indemnifications for past wrongs is to be pressed as of great magnitude in a satisfactory adjustment of our differences with Great Britain, yet as the British Government may be inflexible in refusing an arrangement implying that her maritime principles of capture were contrary to the law of Nations, whilst she would not be inflexible in stipulating a future practice conformable to our wishes, it is not thought proper that a provision for indemnities should be an absolute condition of the repeal of the Act of Congress concerning British manufactures, provided satisfactory arrangements shall be made relative to impressments, and the trade with enemy’s Colonies. Still however it is to be kept in view, that there are claims founded on acts of British Cruisers violating the law of Nations, as recognized by Great Britain herself, and others founded on unexpected  
  
departures, without notice, from rules of practice deliberately settled and formally announced. Of these, examples have been referred to in the communications of Lord Hawksbury to Mr. King, and of Mr. Merry to the Department of State.  
With respect to claims of these several Kinds, it is evident that provision is clearly due for them, and that it may be made without any implication which can alarm the pride or the caution which may be professed. You will not fail therefore, to bring, if necessary, these claims into view, as distinguished from others founded on controverted principles, and to let it be understood that a refusal of them will be a painful ingredient in the negotiations for extinguishing discontents on both sides, and consolidating and perpetuating the friendship between them. In case this distinction should operate in the adjustment, it will furnish an additional reason for preferring a gross sum, to the liquidations of a joint Board; first, because it will admit of a liberal sum, if the British Government should be liberally disposed, on presumptions not affecting her maritime principles; Secondly, because it will leave the United States free to apply the gross sum, in redressing claims according to our maritime principles. A precedent for such an expedient may be found in the Convention of January 1756, between Great Britain and Prussia; whereby a gross sum of £20.000 Stg. was paid to the latter, as an extinguishment of claims, on account of illegal captures, without reference to the precise rules by which it was to be applied. The Treaty of Pardo in January 1739, between Great Britain and Spain, is another precedent. In that Treaty the sum of £95.000 Stg was stipulated in the like general manner, to be paid to Great Britain by Spain, as a compromise for all reparations of maritime injuries.  
If the United States succeed in making satisfactory arrangements on the principle points of impressment of Seamen, Colonial Trade, and still more, if provision be also made for indemnity for Spoliations, it may be naturally expected that Great Britain will require, not only the repeal of the prohibition Act of last Session, but also some security that the United States will not, by subsequent Acts of the same nature, place her on a worse footing than other nations. She may reasonably urge that demand on the double plea, of having yielded on these points which were the subjects of complaint on the part of the United States, and of her being now for want of a Commercial Treaty, placed in that respect at the discretion of the United States; whilst they are precluded by their Treaties with the enemies of Great Britain (Holland, France and Spain) from the power of laying prohibitions or restrictions particularly affecting those Nations.  
The most natural arrangement in that respect will be simply to agree that the two parties shall enjoy in the Ports of each other, in regard to commerce &amp; navigation, the privileges of the most favored Nation. But the Article should be framed so as to embrace, 1st. every privilege and particularly the  
  
exemption from higher duties of every description either on imports or exports and including convoy duties, that are paid by the most favored nation; 2dly. All the possessions of Great Britain in every part of the world; which will secure admission, at all times in both the East and West Indies, on the same terms as are now or may in future be enjoyed by the most favored Nation, whether it be a friend or an enemy.  
The same clause of the footing of the most favored Nation may be extended not only to navigation and Commercial intercourse between the two nations, but to points which relate to the rights and duties of belligerents &amp; neutrals: An arrangement which would secure to Great Britain the same rights in relation to the admission of her armed Vessels in our Ports and to the exclusion of her enemies privateers and of their prizes, which are now enjoyed by Holland, Spain and other most favored nations: Whilst it would place the rights of the United States as neutrals on the same footing with Russia or the most favored Nation, in respect to search, Convoys, blockades and contraband.  
If it shall be thought eligible to place the reciprocal Commercial privileges of the two nations on a more definite basis, than they would be placed by the general expression of the most favored nation (a stipulation which is liable to the difficulty of ascertaining the equivalent to be given in cases where a privilege is granted by one of the contracting parties to another nation, in exchange for some favor, which the other contracting party cannot specially give) it may be done, either by abolishing all alien duties either on Vessels or Cargo or both, and reciprocally placing the Vessels of the other nation on the same footing with National Vessels conformably to the provision in which Great Britain concurred by an Act of parliament in the year 1802; or by fixing the maximum of alien duty which each nation shall have the right to impose on the Vessels or Cargoes of the other Nation. But should the last plan be adopted, care must be taken 1st. that in fixing the maximum of the alien duty to be levied on Vessels, all charges whatever, and under whatever name known, whether tonnage, light house money, port charges &amp;c. shall be included—2ndly. that the maximum of the alien duty to be levied on merchandize imported in the Vessels of the other Nation (beyond the duties levied on similar articles imported in the National Vessels) shall be a per centage on the value of the merchandize itself and not on the original duty—3dly. that the right of imposing such maximum duties either on the Vessels, or merchandize shall never be exercised so as to contravene the other stipulation of enjoying the privileges of the most favored nation—4thly, that the stipulation shall not embrace Vessels &amp; Cargoes coming from or going to ports from which the Vessels or Cargoes of the United States are excluded.  
Should the expedient of a maximum be adopted it must not be overlooked that the productions of the United States exported to Great Britain  
  
employ a far greater tonnage than the exports from Great Britain to the United States; that the higher the maximum therefore the more favorable to Great Britain, who may avail herself according to the degree of it, to secure to her Vessels the carriage of our bulky productions, of which her duty on Tobacco imported in American Vessels is an example; leaving to the United States the opportunity only of securing to their Vessels, the carriage of her unbulky exports; and that consequently no maximum ought to be admitted more unfavorable to the United States, than the regulations likely to prevail, if uncontrouled by Treaty. A mutual abolition of alien duties would probably be favorable to the navigation of the United States, which would then have to contend on equal terms with British navigation, for which it may be expected to be at least a match at all times, and more than a match when Great Britain is at war, which is not less than half the time.  
The only great branch of Commercial Intercourse which would remain unprovided for, is that of intercourse with the British Colonies and dependencies: and if nothing can be obtained on that ground, care also must be taken in framing the article for reciprocally enjoying the privileges of the most favored nation, not to deprive the United States of the right of making such regulations as they may think proper in relation to Vessels coming from Ports from which their own Vessels are excluded, or in relation generally to the intercourse with such ports.  
As the United States confer no particular benefit on the British possessions in the East Indies by their intercourse with that Country, it can hardly be expected that Great Britain will grant any thing more than the general stipulation to be placed on the footing of the most favored nation; or possibly a stipulation to the United States of the privileges heretofore granted to foreigners, which in relation to the coasting trade, and the trade from India Ports to all foreign Countries, as well as that owning the Vessel, exceeded the privileges stipulated in the Treaty of 1794. But as relates to the West Indies and North American Colonies, it must be a permanent object of the policy of the United States, to have the intercourse with them made as free as that with Europe. The relative situation of the United States and of those Colonies, and particularly those wants which we can alone supply, must necessarily produce that effect at some not very distant period. And it should not be voluntarily retarded either by abandoning by Treaty the strong hold which our right of stopping the intercourse gives us, or by accepting any temporary or trifling privilege the exercise of which would diminish the probability of soon obtaining a perfectly free trade.  
It is not probable that Great Britain will be disposed to open the intercourse to our Vessels with her North American

 it will give us a very great share of their carrying trade.  
The minimum which should be accepted in relation to the intercourse with the West Indies, will be the admission of our Vessels laden solely with articles of our growth, produce or manufacture, the importation of which in British Vessels is not prohibited, on the same terms as British Vessels solely laden with the Colonial Articles shall be admitted in our ports, that is to say, either without alien duties or with a fixed maximum of such alien duties, with the two following restrictions—1st. that Great Britain may prohibit our Vessels from exporting from the British West India Islands in Sugar and Coffee, more than one half of the proceeds of their inward Cargo—2ndly. That such Sugar and Coffee shall be exported only to the United States, or that the Vessels thus admitted in the West Indies shall be obliged to return and land their Cargoes in the United States, provided they may however, on their return touch at any other West India Island or the Bahamas to complete their Cargo. For it is usual to carry the specie, which proceeds from the sale of a Cargo in the West Indies to Turks Island or the Bahamas and there load with Salt for the United States. Although  
  
those restrictions and particularly the first be inconvenient, yet they may be acquiesced in. As respects the first restriction, the value of our average exportations to the British West India Islands, being Six Millions of Dollars, and our importations from thence in every article (sugar and Coffee excepted) being three millions of Dollars, the privilege of bringing in return in Sugar and Coffee one half of the Value of our exportations, will just complete the return Cargoes. But it would be desirable that the restriction should be altogether dispensed with, or that Great Britain should allow the exportation in these two articles to the amount of 2/3 or 3/4 of the value of our Cargoes. As relates to Great Britain, if she once yields the point of admission, the restrictions which are proposed seem to be amply sufficient to remove her minor objections. We now import notwithstanding the nominal prohibitions to some amount in American Vessels, about one million and half Dollars, being the whole amount imported from the British Islands in both American and British Vessels.  
The value of our average importations from all the world is  
  
  
in Sugar  
7.800.000  
}  
or more than Sixteen Millions of Dollars  
  
  
in Coffee  
8.400.000  
  
  
The value of our annual consumption exclusively of the New Orleans Sugar, is  
  
  
in Sugar  
4.000.000  
}  
or 5½ Millions of Dollars.  
  
  
in Coffee  
1.500.000  
  
  
  
To permit us therefore to import for 3 Millions cannot enable us to reexport. And three Millions of Dollars compared with the value of the Sugar and Coffee exported annually from the British West Indies which amounts to not less than    millions, cannot in any degree affect their own Commerce or navigation.  
The second restriction is intended still more effectually to remove any apprehension that our Vessels might become carriers of British West India produce to any other Country than the United States. And it may even, if insisted on, be further agreed that no drawback shall be allowable on the reexportation of those articles imported from the British West Indies in American Vessels; provided, however, that on that condition the first mentioned restriction limiting the quantity which may be thus imported from the British West Indies in American Vessels; shall be dispensed with. The utmost care is to be taken in framing the restriction on reexporting from the United States, the produce of the British West Indies imported in American Vessels so to express it as to leave no possible pretext for applying the restriction to any similar articles whether produced within the United States, or imported from any other than British possessions.  
It will be a reasonable Stipulation on the part of Great Britain, that at all times and places at which the trade of the United States is admitted generally or partially, the residence of Consuls and factors shall also be admitted.  
  
The duration of the Commercial part of the Treaty, and of any other parts which do not establish in their full extent, the rights of neutral nations, ought not to exceed the term of eight years; and an abridgment even of that term may perhaps be rendered expedient by the tenor of articles not inconsistent with these instructions.

in London.  
DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  
May 17, ISOS.  
Gentlemen,­  
I herewith enclose a commis­  
sion and letters of credence, authorising you  
to treat with the British government con­  
cerning the maritime wrongs which have  
been committed, and ttie regulation of com- J  
mcrce and navigation between the parlies.  
Your authority is made several as well as  
joint, as a provision for any contingency de­  
priving either of the co-operation of the o­  
thcr.  
The importance of the trust is evinced by  
icS being made the occasion of an extraordi­  
nary mission, as well as the yibjects which  
it embraces. And I have great pleasure in  
expressing the confidence which the presi­  
dent feels, in the prudence and talents to  
which the business is committed.  
It is his particular wish, that the British  
government should lie made fully to under­  
stand, that the ITnited States are sincerely  
and anxiously disposed to cherish food will  
and liberal intercourse between the two na­  
tions; that an unwillingness alone to take  
measures not congenial with that dispositi­  
on, has made them so long patient under vi­  
olations of their rights and of the rules of a  
friendlv recipiocity j and when forced at  
length, by accumulating wrongs to depart  
from an absolute forbearance, they have not  
only selected a mode strictly pacific, but in  
demonstration of their friendly policy, have  
connected with the measure an extraordina­  
ry mission, with powers to remove every  
source of difference, and even to enlarge the  
foundations of future harmony and mutual in­  
terest.  
  
i iieie can nc cue less ground of umbrage to  
the British government, in the act prohibit­  
ing the importation of certain articles of Bri­  
tish manufacture—1st. Recause there is no­  
thing on the face of the act Lyohd « mere  
commercial regulation, tending to foster ma­  
nufuctui ts in the United States, to lessen our  
dependence on a single nation by the distri­  
bution of our trade, and to substitute for  
woollens 8c linens, manufactures made from  
one of our principal agricultural staples —  
2d. Because it is far short of a reciprocity  
with Bv.tish exclusions of American articles  
of expot t.——. .1. Because as a commercial  
measure,&#x27;discriminating in time of war, be­  
tween British and other nations, it has ex  
amples in British practice. It deserves at­  
tention also, that a discrirhmation was made  
and under another name still exists, in the  
amount of convoy duty imposed on the trade  
between Great-Britain with Europe, &amp; w, h  
America—4th. Because the measure cannot  
be ascribed to a partiality towards the ene­  
mies of Great-Britain, or to a view of favor­  
ing them in the war, having for its sole ob­  
ject the interest of the United States which  
it pursues in a mode strictly conformable to  
the rights and practice of all nations.  
In line, the act may truly he represented  
as so far from derogating from the am cable  
dispositions ot the United States towards G  
Britain, that it has resulted solely from the  
inefficacy of their protracted and reiterated  
endeavors, otherwise to obtain a just redress  
and from a hope that an appeal in this peace­  
able form to the reflections and interest of  
an enlightened nation, would be more suc­  
cessful in lemoving every obstacle to a per­  
fect 8c pci manent cordiality between the t wo  
nations.  
  
I he instructions given to Mr. Monro&quot; Ja­  
nuary 5, 1804, having taken into view, &amp; be­  
ing still applicable to a great proportion of  
the matter now committed to your joint ne­  
gociations, it will be most convenient to refer  
you to those instructions as your general  
guide, and to confine the present t« the alte­  
rations £c additions, which a change of cir­  
cumstances, or a contemplation of new ob­  
jects, may require.  
’1 he first aiticle of the project comprised  
in the instructions of lk04, relates to the im­  
pressment ot seamen. The importance of an  
effectual remedy for this practice, derives  
urgcncA from the licentiousness with which  
it is still pursued, and from the growing im­  
patience of this country under it. So indis­  
pensable is some adequate provision for the  
case, that the president makes it a ne-espia­  
ry preliminary to any stipulation, reqitii ing  
u repeal of the act shutting the market of  
the United States against certain British ma­  
nufactures. At the same time he authori­  
zes you, in case the ultimatum as stated in  
the article above referred to, should not be &#x27;  
acceptable to the British government, to sub- I  
stitute one in tlie terms following : “nosea- I  
man or seafaring person shall upon the nigh 1  
seas, and without the jurisdiction of either  
party, be demanded, or taken out of any  
ship or vessel, belonging to the citizens or  
subjects of one of the parties, by the public !  
or private armed ships or men of war he­  
longmgto, or in the service of the other party 1  
and strict orders shall be given for the du« 1  
Observance of this engagement.”  
An article hi these terms wa?, %7ith th&#x27;­  
acquiescence of lm-d Hawkesbtry and Mr  
Addington, concerted between Mr. King &lt;&lt;c  
lord St. Vincent, on the approaching renew­  
al of the lat • war. It was frustrated by an  
exception of the “ narrow seas,” inserted by  
lord St. Vincent, an exception so evidently  
i »n«wln»w.ble both in principle and in prac­  
Iticcvtlrat it itjqst hewn ird&lt;p&gt;ded as a  
  
pretext for evading the stipulation at that  
time.—Perhaps the present ministry may  
neither be disposed to resort to such a pre­  
text ; nor unwilling to avail themselves of the  
precise sanction as far as it was given, by  
their predecessors.  
W ith respect to contraband, which is the  
subject of the 4th article, it may be obser­  
ved, that as it excludes naval stores from the  
list, and is otherwise limited to articles  
strictly military, it must, if admissible toG.  
Britain, leave but feeble objections to an a­  
bolition of contraband altogether. In the  
present state of the arts in Europe, with the  
intercourse by land, no nation at war with G.  
Britain can lie much embarrassed by leaving  
those particular articles subject to maritime  
captures.—\\ hilst the belligerent nations,  
therefore, have little interest in the limited  
right against contraband ; it imposes on neu­  
trals all the evils resulting from suspicious  
and vexatious searches, and from questions  
incident to the terms used in tile actual enu­  
meration. It is not an unreasonable ho; c,  
therefore, that in place of this article, an en­  
tire abolition of contraband may be substitu­  
ted. Should this be found unattainable, it  
may be an improvement of the article, as it  
stands, to subjoin, for the sake of greater cau­  
tion, to the positive enumerati on, a negative  
specification of certain articles, such as pro­  
visions, money, naval stores, £cc. as in no  
case to be deemed within the meaning of the  
&quot;article; with a proviso, that the specificati­  
on shall not be construed to imply in the least,  
that any articles not specified in the excep­  
tion, shall, on that uccount, be liable to be  
drawn in question.  
A doctrine has been lately introduced by  
the British courts, and at length adopted by  
the instructions of June, 1803, to British crui­  
z«rs, which regards contraband conveyed in  
one voyage as affecting a resumed or return  
voyage, although the contraband shall have  
been previously deposited at its port of des­  
tination. It will be a further improvement  
of the article to insert a declaratory clause  
against this innovation, and the abuses inci­  
dent to it.  
The 4th article, besides the stipulation on  
the subject bf contraband, relates to twoo­  
ther subjects. 1st—That of free ships, free  
goods.—2d— 1 hat of a trade with enemy’s co­  
lonies.  
  
1st. witn respect to the first, the princi­  
ple that a neutral flag covers the property of  
an enemy, is relinquished in pursuance of the  
example of the Russian treaty on which the  
article is modelled ; the relinquishment how­  
ever being connected with, and conditioned  
on, the provision in favor of the neutral right  
to the colonial trade. The importance of  
that principle to the security of neutral  
commerce, and to the freedom of the seas,  
has at all times been felt by the United States  
—and although they have not asserted it as  
the established law of nations, ‘hey have  
been ever anxious to sec it made a part of  
that larv. It was with reluctance of course,  
that a contrary stipulation was authorised,  
merely as a mean of obtaining from Great­  
Britain, the recognition of a&#x27; principle now  
become of more importance to neutral nati­  
ons possessing mercantile capital, than the  
principle of “ free ships, free goods.” It is  
to be particularly kept in view, therefore,  
that such a contrary stipulation is to be a­  
voided if ^possible, and if unavoidable, that  
the stipulation be so modified as to inter­  
fere as little as possible, with the spirit and  
policy of any provisions in favor of the prin­  
ciple, which may be likely to be introduced  
into a treaty of peace among the present  
belligerent powers of Europe. Should it be  
known that Russia as well as Fiance mean  
to insist on such a provision ; and that sucli a  
stipulation by the United States, however  
modified, will materially affect her confi­  
dence and good will towards them, the ob­  
jection to the measure will acquire a force  
that can yield only to the consideration, that  
without such a sacrifice the * provisions for  
the security of oui seamen, and of our neu­  
tral commerce, cannot be obtained, and that  
the sacrifice will effectually answer these  
purposes.  
  
2d. The vast importance of the colonial  
trade, with the circumstances and the excite­  
ment which have taken place sii e the date  
of the original instructions to Mr. Monroe,  
will require that the neutral right ow* .this  
subject, be provided for in an appropriate ar­  
ticle, and in terms more explicit than are  
used in the article under review. As the  
right in this case, turns on the general pritff.  
ciplc that neutrals may lawfully trade, wi/t/j  
the exceptions of blockades arid contraband  
to and between all ports of an enemy, and in  
all articles, although the trade shall not have  
been open to them in time of peace ; parti­  
cular care is to lie taken, that no part of the  
principle be expressly or virtually abandon­  
ed, as being no part of the law of nations._  
On the contrary, it is much to be desired,  
that the genera! principle in its full extern]  
be laid down in the stipulation. But as this  
may not lx: attainable, and as too much  
ought not to be risked as an inflexible pur­  
suit of abstract right, especially against the  
example and the sentiments of great pow­  
ers having t oncurrent interests with the U­  
ntted States, you are left at liberty, if found  
necessary, to abridge the right rn practice,  
as is done in the supplement of Oct. 1801, to  
the treaty of June of that year, between Rus­  
sia and G. Britain ; not omitting to provide,  
that in case Great-Britain should by her  
treaties or instructions leave to any other na  
tion the right in a greater extent than is sti­  
pulated to the United States, they may claim  
the enjoyment of it in equal extent.  
&#x27;1 lie abuses which have been committed  
by Great-Britain, under the pretext that a  
neutral trade, from enemy colonies, throu&#x27;li  
neutral ports, was a direct trade, render 4t  
indispensable to guard against such a pretext,  
by some express declaration on that point.—  
1 lie most that can ue conceded, on the part  
of the United States is, that the landing of  
the goods, tin securing the duties, and the  
change of the ship, or preferably the landing  
of the goods a»on«s, or with the securing tin  
duties, shall be requisite to destroy the iden­  
tity of the Voyage and the directness of the  
trade, and that the ordinary&#x27; documents op  
the custom house officers, shall be sufficient,  
evidence of the facts or fact. J  
A satisfactory provision on this subject on  
a trade with enemy colonies, is deemrd „*  
so iriuch consequence to the ri^h.t# and uJ;«!  
  
rests of the United States, and is so well un­  
, derstood to have been contemplated atom*  
i with a like provision against&#x27;the impressment  
of seamen, in the late act of congress prohi­  
biting the importation of certain classes of  
British manufactures, that, as was enjoined  
with respect to the provision against im­  
pressment, no stipulation is to be entered  
info, not consistent wil7 a continuance of  
t.iat act, unless the firtrcisicn with resjiect  
to the colonial trade be also obtained.  
&#x27; In remodelling thv provision with respect  
&#x27;.o tlie colonial trade,-you may with great  
propriety urge a distinction between the  
YVesi-India colonics, und the very distant  
fines in the Ivtsl-Judies and cl »e where, and.  
the reasonableness ot limiting to the former  
the exception of the dirfect trade , with their  
parent countries out of the general neutral  
right.. The distinction is supported !&gt;v seve­  
ral considerations, particularly by the great­  
er difficulty, in the case oi &#x27;he move distant  
colonics, ot previously knowing, and eventu­  
allv proving,the regulations as thev may have  
actually stood in the time of peace ; and by  
the ruinous delays and expenccs attending  
the judicial investigations. The British  
courts have in fact admitted the distinction  
so far as to presume the lawfulness of the  
neutral trade with the East-India colonies,  
us being-generally open in peace as well as  
war; whilst they reverse the presumption,  
with respect to the West Indies.  
In addition to what is proposed on the sub­  
ject of blockades, in VI. and VII. articles  
the per severance of Great- liri tain in con­  
sidering a notification of a blockade, and e­  
vrn of an intended blockade, to a fori ign go­  
vernment, or i&#x27;s ministers at London, as a  
notice to its citizens, and as rendering a ves­  
sel wdterrver found in a destination to the  
notified fiort, as liable to capture, calls for  
a special remedy. The palpable injustice of  
the practice, is aggravated by the auxiliary,  
rule prevailing in the British courts, that  
the blockade is to lie held in legal force, un­  
til the governmental notification be expressly­  
rescinded ; however certain the fact maybe  
that the blockade was never formed or had  
ceased. You will be at no loss for topics to  
enforce the inconsistency of these innovations  
with the law of nations’ with the nature of  
blockades, witli the safety of neutral com­  
merce ; and particularly with the communi­  
cation made to this government by order oi  
the British government, in the year 1804  
according to which, the . British commander  
and vice-admiralty epurts, were instructed  
“ not to consider any blockade of the islands  
of Martinique and Guadaloupe as existing,  
unless in respect of particular ports which  
may be actually invested, and then not to  
  
uuuuu to sucu ports, unless  
tiiey shall previously have been warned not  
to enter them.”  
The absurdity of -substituting such diplo­  
matic notifications in place of a special warn­  
ing from the blockading ships, cannot he bet­  
ter illustrated than by the fact, that before  
the notification of a proposed blockade of  
Cadiz, in the year 1805, was received here  
worn our minister at London, official infor­  
mation was received from Cadiz, that the  
blot k.ule hud uctuullv been raised by un en­  
emy’s fleet.  
. It may be worth your attention, that a dis­  
tinction has been admitted by the British  
prize courts, in consideration of the distance  
of the United States from the European  
blockades, between their citizens and those  
of states less cus^ant; the notice required for  
the former being more positive than is made  
necessary for the latter. You will be able  
to a\ ail yourselves in the discussion, and per­  
haps in the modification of the article, of the  
reasons on which such a distinction rests.

and whether outward or inward bound,

mouths, be delivered up for that purpose.”  
If the distance cf lour leagues cannot be  
obtained, any distance not less than one sea  
l**ignv n ay be substituted in the article. It  
.will occur to you that the stipulation against  
the roving and hovering of armed skips on  
our c ts, so as to cud an cr or alarm tra­  
ding vc el&#x27;;, will acquire importance, us the  
space entitled toimlliunity shall be narrow­  
ed.  
Ai ether rbiect, not comprehended in the  
instructions of 1 04, to Mr. Monroe, is ren­  
dered important by the number of illegal  
captures and injurit s, which have been com­  
mitted by Briri:-ii ervizers since that date.  
An indt&#x27;.ou:.) h r them is due on every con  
siderntion oi iustice and friendship, and is  
enforced hv the example here to:ore given by  
Great-BrhaSn herself, a» well as by ether  
rations which have provided by treaty, for  
repairing the spoliations practised under  
• ’colour of their authority. You will press  
this as an object too reasonable not to be  
confidently expected bv the United States.  
Many of the claims, indeed, for indemnifica­  
tion are so chvi«*usly just, that a refusal to  
satisfy them, cannot be decently made, and  
ought not therefore to be presumed.  
  
i lie two modes most rei.duy presenting  
themselves for a comprehensive provision  
for the claims, are, first, the establishment  
of a board analogous to that provided for  
in the 7th article of the treatv of 1794; se­  
condly, the substitution of a gross sum to be  
distributed among the claimants, according  
to a liquidate n to be made under the autho­  
rity of the United States.  
The second is the mode most eligible, if  
the gross sum to be allowed, be thought to  
approach the amount of losses to be indem­  
nified. To;.ssi t you in ev.ima ingthc.se, the  
statements addressed to this department by  
the underwriters, and others are herewith  
transmitted. These statements, with those  
furnished by Mr. Lyman, to November 1st,  
will be n be reduced, according to the re­  
dress v hich shall have been judicially afford­  
ed, and on the other hand to be augmented  
by the addition of cases not reported here  
end to be collected from the.sources of infor­  
mation within your own reacli.  
If the first mode should be adopted, great  
care w ill be requisite, in describing the ca­  
ses, to employ such general terms as will  
comprehend all that are fai ly entitled to ;  
redress: It will be well at the samp time to !  
secure, by specifying such of the cases as can  
be specified, and as are least susceptible of ,  
objection. Under this head may be classed !  
1st, cases in which the official communica- &#x27;  
tion made by lord Hav. k esbury to Mr. King,  
of the lith da} of April, J 801, has been vio-’  
iaied ; 2d, cases in which the rules of block­  
ade, stated in Mr. Merry’s communication  
to the department c: state on the 12th day  
of April, .1804, have been violated—3d,  
cases where the territorial jurisdiction of the  
United States has neen violated.  
The list of neutral rights,&#x27; asserted in the  
report of the secretary of state to the Presi­  
dent, on the 25th dav of January, 1306, will  
suggest other specifications which may be  
attempted. It may be worth recollecting,  
tliat the British order cf council nearing date  
24th June, 1803, and subjecting to capture  
vessels on a return voyage, which had car- !  
ried contraband in the outward voyage,  
was never promuiged, nor was it known that1  
such a rule was to be enforced, until the  
summer of 1805. Could the rule be regard­  
ed otherwise than as it certainly is, an&#x27;inno­  
vation or. the law of nations, ail captures be­  
fore it was made known, and conti ary to an­  
tecedent practice, would be marked by an  
fmjust surprise, taiily entitling them to re­  
dress.  
  
i lie business to come before such a board  
rm.}&#x27; be much diminished by the reference of  
cases* particularly oi cost and damages, and  
such others whose description by common  
consent entitles them to redress, to the king’s,  
advocate, and an advocate to be named on  
your part, who may be authorised to reprffrt  
the sums due, subject to the approbatkwVin  
each c ;&lt;-e, of Mr. Lyman, cur agent  
far as the cases fail within the obsen. el0u\
here made, a liquidation of them may !j v.  
vied on during the.period of negociay C.7 j  
Although tlie subject of indemnifications  
for past wrongs is to be pressed as of, great  
magnitude, in a satisfactory adjustment of  
our differences with CJreat-Britain ; Let as  
the British Government may be inflexible  
in refusing an arrange uent iinplyingtlLit her i  
maritime principles of capture were :qntra- &#x27;  
ry to the jaw of nations, whilst she wtyuld not&#x27; i  
be inflexible in stipulating a future f/iracticc  
conformable to our wishes, it is not thought i  
I’1&quot; ?cr that a prnvisi, &gt; for inden.nitie; 5 should

aet&#x27; of congress,concerning British m «nufac , ■  
ture’.s, provided satisfactory arran^j crnenrs  
»hall be made relative toimpressnien is, and !  
the trade with cm. m-, ’&amp; colonies, fiti ‘1 h w­  
e.er, it is to be kept in view, that the* -e arc 1  
claims found&#x27;d on acts of British criZizcra, 1  
violating tin law ol nations, as rec«/|tnized &#x27;  
hy Or. at-nritiiin her elf, and others founded I  
to ime.-iurtMl departures, without Yotice, I  
lpofn rtih-&#x27;i of practice deliberately f.etlled .  
and formally announced. Of these,/exam- I  
l-&#x27;i i ha i e been referred to in the comuVmica­  
t:rn of lord Hawkrsbury to Mr. KirJg, and  
Murry tu the department of si ate.  
•i «i ia j.ect to c aim* of these .• vcral  
kind . it is evident that provision is cl early  
&lt;J&#x27;&lt; for the u, and that it maj be made! with­

P d« or the caution which may be plrofes­  
i d You will not fail therefore, to bring if  
I  
} “.&#x27; bed from others founded on controverted  
pka; and to lei it be understood, f that  
V vt .u.fil of them will be a painful ing!cdi­  
t .&#x27; t ifi the negotiations for extinguishing! fa.  
&lt; nt&#x27; uf* on both sides and consolidatii gjW:,d  
r» rpettn &#x27; ing thr friendship between »7i&#x27;!n.  
In cair- -his di-tinction i.h v d operate in tjf.e  
a &#x27; tmrnt it will fm .ish an additional rjSv - j  
V ”&gt;r preferring a g oss sum, to the liqtLp I &lt;  
  
da t ions of a joint board. First. Because it  
will admit of a liberal sum, if the British :  
government should be liberally disposed, on j  
presumptions not affecting; her maritime |  
principles. Secondly. Because it will leave,  
the United States free to apply the gross  
sum, in redressing claims according to our  
maritime principles. A precedent for such  
an expedient may be found in the conventi­  
,on of January, 1756 between Great-Britain  
and Prussia; whereby a gross sum ofiiO.OOO  
pounds, sterling, was paid to the latter as an  
extinguishment of claims on account of ille­  
gal captures, without reference to the pre­  
cise rules bv which it was to lie applied.—  
1 he treaty of Pardo, in January, 175?, be­  
tween Great-Britain and Spain, is another  
precedent. In that treaty the sum of 95,000  
pounds, sterling, was stipulated in the like  
general manner, to be paid to Great-Britain  
by Spain, as a compromise for all reparati­  
ons of maritime injuries.  
If the United States succeed in making sa­  
tisMctorv arrangements on the principal  
points of impressment of seamen, colonial  
trade, and still more if provision bo also  
made for indemnity for spoliations, it may  
be naturally expected that Great-Britain  
will require, not only the repeal of the pro­  
hibitory act of last session, but also some se­  
curity that the United States will not by sub­  
sequent acts of the same nature, place her  
on a worse footing than other nations. She  
nr-iv reasonably urge that demand on the  
double plea, of having yielded on those points  
&quot;’b’ch were the subjects of complaint on the  
part of the United State#, and of her being  
now for want of a commercial treatv, placed  
in that respect at the discretion of the Unit­  
ed States : whilst they are precluded by their  
treaties with the enemies of Great-Britain  
(Holland, Frar.ee and Sp^in,) fr-m the power  
ot laying pi ohibitions or restrictions parti­  
cularlv affect!n«r those natinne  
  
i he most natural arrangement in that res­  
pect will be, simply to agree that the two  
parties shall enjoy in the ports of each other  
in regard to commerce and navigation, the  
privileges ol the most favored nation. But  
the article should be framed so as to em­  
brace 1st, every privilege, and particulars  
the exemption from higher duties of every  
description either on imports or exports, and  
including convoy duties, that nre paid by the  
most favored nation ; 2d, all the possessions  
of Great-Britain in every part of the world,  
which will secure admission at all times in  
both the East and West-Indies, on the same  
terms as are now or may in fucwre be en­  
joyed by the most favored nation, whe­  
ther it be a friend or an enemy.  
1 he same clause of the footing of the must j  
favored nation, may be extended not only to |  
navigation and commercial intercourse be­  
tween the two nations, but to points which  
relate to the rights and duties of belliger­  
ents and neutrals; an arrangement which  
would secure to Great-Britain the same  
rights in relation to the admission of her  
armed vessels in our ports, and to the ex­  
clusion of her enemies, privateers and of  
their prizes, which are now enjoyed by Hol­  
land, bpain, and other most favored nations,  
whilst it would place the rights of the Uni­  
ted States, as neutrals, on the same footing  
with Russia, or the most favored nation, in  
respect to search, convoys, blockades and  
contraband.  
If it shall be thought eligible to place the  
reciprocal commercial privileges of the two  
nations on a more definite basis than they  
would be placed by the general expression  
of the most favored nation, (&lt;t stipulation  
which is liable to the difficulty of ascertaining  
the equivalent to be given in cases where a  
privilege is granted by one of tl)e contract­  
ing par ties to another nation, in exchange for  
some favor which the other contracting party  
cannot specifically give,) it may be done ei­  
ther by abolishing a.t alien duties, either on  
vessels or cargo, or on both, and reciprocal­  
ly placing the vessels of the other nation,  
on the same footing with national vessels;  
conformably to a provision in which Great­  
Britain concurred, by an act of parliament, in  
the year 1802; or by fixing the maximum of  
alien duty, which each nation shall have the  
right to impose on the vessels or cargoes of  
the other nation. But should the last  
plan bz adopted, care must be taken, 1st.  
That in fixing the maximum of the alien  
duty to be ievied on vessels, all charges  
whatever, and under whatever name known  
whether tonnage, light-house money, port  
charges, &amp;c. shall be included. 2diy. That  
the maximum of the alien duty to be levied  
on merchand&#x27;zc imported in the vessels of  
the other nation, (beyond the duties levied  
on similar amides imported in the national  
  
vessels; sr.au oe a per centage on the value  
of the merchandize itseif, and not on the  
original dr y. 3dly. That the right of im­  
posing =uch maximum duties, either on the  
vess- &amp; or merchandize, shall never be cx­  
&quot;■^ised so as to contravene the other stipula­  
tion of enjoying tile privileges of the most  
favored nation. 4thly, That the stipulation  
shall not embrace vessels and cargoes com­  
ing from, or going to ports, from which the  
vessels pr cargoes of the United States are  
excluded.  
Should the expedient of a maximum be a­  
iopted, it must not be overlooked that the  
productions of the United States exported  
:o Great-Britain, employed a far greater  
tonnage than the exports from Great-Britain  
to the United States—that the higher the  
Tiaximum, therefore, the more favorable to  
Lircnt-Britain, who may avail herself ac­  
cording to the degree of it, to secure to her  
■essels the carriage of our bulky productions,  
A which her duty on tobacco imported in  
\merican vessels is an example, leaving t  
the United States the opportunity only of se­  
curing to their vessels the carriage of her  
inbulky exports ; and that consequently no  
naxinmin ought to be admitted more unfa­  
mrab e to the United S.ates, than the regu­  
ations iikely to prevail, if uncontrolled by  
reaty. A mutual abolition of alien duties  
vould probably be favorable to the naviga­  
ion of the United States, which would then  
lave to contend on equal terms with British  
lavigation, for which it may be expected to  
&gt;(: at least a match at all times, and more  
ban a match when Great-Britain is at  
var, which is not less than half tljc time.  
1 he only great branch of commercial inter­  
course which would remain unprovided for, 1  
s that of intercourse with the British colo^  
lies and dependencies—and if nothing can he  
&gt;bt.lined on that ground, care must also be  
nken in framing the article for reciprocalIv  
mjoying the privileges of the most favoured  
lation, not to deprive the U. States of the  
ight of making sdeh regulations ns they may  
hi nit proper in relation to vessels coining •  
rom ports from which their own vessels are &#x27;  
xcludcd, or in relation gei jfy to the inter- J  
oursc with such ports.

bject of the United States to have the in­  
  
tcrcourse with them made as free as that  
w ith Europe. The relative situation of the  
United States and those colonies, and parti­  
cularly-those wants which we can alone sup­  
ply, must necessarily produce that effect at  
some no very distant period. And it should  
not be voluntarily retarded, cither by aban­  
doning by treaty, the strong hold which our  
right of stopping the intercourse gives us  
or by accepting any temporary or trifling  
privilege, the exercise of which would dimi­  
nish the probability of soon obtaining a per­  
fectly free trade.  
\Lonfidcntial—not firinted.]  
The minimum which should be accepted  
in relation to the intercourse with the VVcsl­  
Indies, will he the admission of our vessels  
laden solely with articles of our growth, pro­  
duce or manufacture, the importation of  
which, in British vessels is not prohibited,  
on the same terms as British vessels, solely  
laden with the colonial articles, shall he ad­  
mitted in our ports ; that is to saV, either  
without alien duties, or with a fixed maxi­  
mum of such alien duties, with the two fol­  
lowing restrictions:—1st. That Great-llri­  
tain may prohibit our vessel from exporting  
from the British West-India islands in su­  
gar and coffee, more than one half of the  
proceeds of their inward cargoes : 2d. That  
such sugar and coffee shall be exported onlv  
to the l/n&#x27;tcd S;a:es, or that the vessels thus  
admitted in the West-Indies shall be obli­  
ged to return arid land their cargoes in the  
United States, provided they may, however,  
on their return, touch at any other West-In­  
dia island or the Bahamas, to complete thejr  
cargo. For it is usual to carry the specie  
which proceeds from the sale of a c.irgp in  
the West-Indics to Turk’s island or the Ba­  
hamas, and there load with salt fur the U.  
States. Although those restrictions, and par­  
ticularly the first, be inconvenient, yet the’’  
maybe acquiesced in. As respects the first  
restriction, the value of our average expor­  
tations to the British West-India islands, be­  
ing six millions of dollars, and on exportati­  
ons from thence in every article (sugar and  
coffee excepted) being three millions dollars,  
the privilege of bringing in return, in sugar  
and coffee, one half of the value of our ex­  
portations, will just comniete the return nr­  
  
goes. But it would be desirable that the res­  
triction should be altogether dispensed with,  
or that Great-Britain should allow the ex­  
portation in those two articles to the amount  
of two-thirds or three-fourths of the value  
of om- cargoes. As relutes to Great-Britain,  
if she one &gt; ields the point of admission, the  
-cs’victions which arc proposed, seem to be  
imply sufficient, to remove her minor objec­  
tions. YVe now import, notwithstanding the  
nominal prohibitions to some amount, in A­  
merican vessels, about one million and half  
dollars, being the whole amount imported  
froth the British islands, in both American  
and British vessels. The value of our ave­  
rage importations from all the world, is,  
In Sugar, t ,800,000 ^ Or more than sixteen  
In Coffee, 8,400,000 j millions of dollars.  
T he value of our annual consumption, ex­  
clusively of the New-Orleans Sugar, is,  
In Sugar, 4,000.000 ^ Or five and a half  
In Coffee, 1,500,000 3 millions of dolls.  
*1 o permit us therefore toimport for three  
millions,canno: enable us tore-export. And  
three millions ot dollars compared with the  
value cf the sugar and coffee exported annu­  
a.ly from the British West-Indies, which a­  
mount to not less than millions, cannot in  
any degree affect their own commerce or na­  
vigation.  
The second restriction is intended still  
more effectually to remove any apprehensi­  
.at our vessels might become carriers  
ct British West-India produce to any other  
country than.the United States. Anti it may  
even, if insisted on, be further agreed, that  
no drawback, shall be allowable on the re­  
exportation of those articles imported t?vo&quot;  
the British West-Indies in American \es­  
sels : provided, however, that on that condi­  
tion the first mentioned restriction, limiting  
the quantity .which may be thus imported  
from the British West-Indies in American  
vessels, shall be dispensed with. The ut­  
most care is to be taken in framing the res­  
trictior on re-exporting from the United  
States, the produce of the British West-In­  
dies, imported in American vessels, so to ex­  
press it as to leave no possible pretext for  
applying the restriction to any similar arti­  
cles, whether produced within the U. S or  
imported from any other than British posses­  
sions. ,  
It will be a reasonable s&#x27;ipulation on the  
part of Great-Britain, that at all times and  
places at which the trade of the United  
States is admitted generally or partially, the  
residence of consuls and lactors shall also be  
admitted.

: minor objections. We now import, j

I from the British. West Indies, which j  
J amounts to not less than ,  
millions, cannot in any degree affect |  
&#x27;.heir own commerce or navigation.  
The second restriction is intended I  
still more effectually to remove any |  
; apprehension that our vessels might !  
ne carriers of British West India  
; produce to any other countr. than the  
jU. States. And it may even, if in­  
: sEted on, be further agreed, th  
drawback shall be allowable on the  
re-exportation of those articles im­

i ver, that on that condition the first;  
mentioned restriction* limiting the  
quantity which may he thus imported !

* The first article of the project comprised in the instructions of 1804,  
relates to the impressment of seamen. ‘The importance of an effectual  
remedy for this praétice, derives urgency from the licentiousness with  
which it is still pursued, and from the growing impatience of this coun-

1806, &quot;will be, simply to agree, that  
the two parties shall enjoy in the ports  
of each other, in regard to commerce  
and navigation, the privileges of the  
most favored nation. But the arti­  
cle should be framed so as to embrace  
—1st, every privilege, and particular­  
ly the exemption from higher duties of  
description either on exports or im­  
ports, and including convoy duties ,  
that are paid by the most favored nati­  
on ; 2nd all the possessions of Great­  
Britain in every part of the world,  
which will secure admission at all  
times in both the East and West-In­  
dies, on the same terms as are now or  
may in future, be enjeyed by the moss  
favored nation.&quot; &quot;If,&quot; continues Mr.  
Madison, &quot; it shall be thought eligi­  
ble to place the reciprocal commerci­  
al privileges of the two nations on a  
more definite basis than they would  
be placed by the general expression  
of the most favored naton (a stipulati­  
on which is liable to the difficulty of  
ascertaining the equivalent tobe giv­  
en, in cases where a privilege is gran­  
ed by one of the contracting parties to  
another nation, in exchange foi some  
favor, which the other contracting  
party cannot specially give) it may be  
done, either by abolishing .ail alien du­  
ties, either on vessel and cargo, or  
both, and reciprocally placing the  
vessels of the other nations on the  
same fooling with national vessels,  
conformably to a provision in which  
Great Britain concurred by an act of  
prrliament, in the year 1802 ; or, by  
fixing the maximum of alien duty,  
which each nation shall have the right  
to impose on the vessels or cargoes of  
the other nation. But should the last  
plan be adopted, care must be taken  
—1st, That in fixing the maximum  
of the alien duty to be levied on  
vessels  
under whatever name known, wheth­  
tonage, light house money, port  
charges, &amp;c. shall be included. 2d,  
That the maximum of the alien du­  
tv to be levied on merchandize impor­  
ted in the vessels of the other nation  
(beyond the duties levied on similar  
articles imported in the national vess­  
els) shall be per centage on the value  
of the merchandise itself, and not on  
the original duty. 3d. That the right,  
of imposing such maximum duties,  
either on the vessels or merchan­  
dise, shall never be exercised, So as

Department of state, May 17, 1806.  
  
GenTLemMEN,—I herewith enclose a commission  
and letters of credence, authorising you to treat  
with the British government concerning the mari-  
time wrongs which have been committed, and the  
regulation of commerce and navigation between the  
parties. Your authority is made several as well as  
joint, as a provision for any contingency depriving  
either of the co-operation of the other.  
  
The importance of the trust is evinced by its  
being made the occasion of an extraordinary mission, |  
as Well as by the subjects which it embraces. And  
Ihave great pleasure in expressing the confidence  
which the president feels, in the prudence and ta-  
lents to which the business is committed.

beyond a mere commercial regulation, tending to  
foster manufactures in the United States, to lessen  
our dependence on a single nation by the distribu-  
tion of our trade, and to substitute for woolens and  
linens, manufactures made from one of our principal  
agricultural staples. 2d—Because it is far short of  
a reciprocity with British exclusions of American  
articles of export. 3d—Because as a commerci:.l  
measure, discriminating in time of war, between  
British and other nations, it has examples in British  
practice. It deserves attention also, that a discrimi-  
nation was made, and under another name still exists,  
in the-amount of convoy duty imposed on the trade  
between Great Britain with Europe, and with Ame-  
rica. 4th—Because the measure cannot be ascribed  
to a partiality towards the enemies of Great Britain,  
or to a view of favoring them in the war, having for  
its sole object the interest of the United States,  
which it pursues in a mode strictly conformable to  
the rights and the practice of all nations.  
  
In fine the act may truly be represented as so far  
from derogating from the amicable dispositions of  
the United States towards Great Britain, that it has  
resulted solely from the inefficacy of their protracted  
and reiterated endeavors, otherwise to obtain a just  
redress, and from a hope that an appeal in this peace-  
able form to the reflections and interests of an en-  
lightened nation, would be more successful in re-  
moving every obstacle to a perfect and permanent  
cordiality between the two nations  
  
The instructions given to Mr. Monroe, January 5,  
1804, having taken into view, and being still appli-  
cable to a great proportion of the matter now com-  
mitted to your Joint negociations, it will be most  
convenient to refer you to those instructions as your  
general guide, and to confine the present to the  
alterations and additions, which a change of circum-  
stances, or a contemplation of new objects, may  
require.  
  
The first article of the project comprised in the  
instructions of 1804, relates to the impressment of  
seamen. Thé importance of an effectual remedy for  
this practice, derives urgency from the licentious-  
ness with which it is still pursued, and from the  
growing impatience of this country under it. So

to cherish good will and liberal intercourse between

measures not congenial with that disposition, has  
made them so long patient under violations of their

serced by lord St. Vincent, an exception so evidently  
inadmissible both in principle and in practice, that it  
frust have’been intended as a pretext for evading  
the stipulation at that time. Perhaps the present  
trinistry may neither be disposed to resort to such  
a pretext; nor unwilling to avail themselves of the  
precise sanction as far as it was given, by thei  
predecessors.  
  
With respect to contraband, which is the subject  
‘of the 4th article, it may be observed, thut as it ex-  
clifdes naval stores from the list, and is otherwise  
limited to articles strictly military, it must ifadmis-  
sible to Great Britain, leave but feeble objections to  
ai abolition of contraband altogether. In the present  
state of the arts in Europe, with the intercourse by  
‘and, no nation at war with Great Britain can be  
much embarrassed by leaying those particular arti-  
cles subject to maritime captures. Whilst bellige-  
rent ations, therefore, have little interest in the  
limited right against contraband; it imposes on  
netttrals all the evils resulting from suspicious and  
vexatious searches, and from questions incident te  
the terms used in the actual enumeration. It is not  
an Unreasonable hope, therefore, that in place of  
  
his article, an entire abolition of contraband may be  
$ubstituted. Should this be found unattainable, it  
may bean improvement of the article as it stands, to  
subjoin, for the sake of greater caution, to the posi-  
live enumeration, a negative specification of certain  
articles, such as provisions, money, naval stores, &amp;c.  
as in no case to be deemed within the meaning of the  
article; with a proviso, that the specification shall  
not be construed to imply in the least, that any ar-  
ticles not specified in the exception, shail, on that!  
account, be liable to be drawn into the question.  
  
  
  
A doctrine has been lately introduced by the Bri-|  
tish courts, and at length adopted by the instruc-)  
tions of June, 1893, to British cruizers, which re-!  
gards contraband conveyed in one voyage as affecting |

as_well as France mean to insist on such a provision;  
and that such a stipulation by the United States,  
however modified, will materially affect her confi.  
dence and good will towards them, the objection to  
the measure will acquire a force that can yield only  
to the consideration, that without such a, sacrifice  
the provisions for the security of our seamen, and of  
our neutral commerce, cannot be obtained, and that  
the sacrifice will effectually answer these purposes,  
  
21. The vast importance of the colonial trade,  
with the circumstances and the excitement which  
have taken place since the date of the original in-  
structions to Mr. Monroe, will require that the  
neutral right on this subject, be provided for in an  
appropriate article, and in terriis more explicié than  
are used in the article under review. As the right in  
this case, turns om the general principle that neu-  
trals may lawfully trade, with the exceptions of  
blockades and contraband, to and between all ports  
of an enemy, and in all articles, although the trade  
shall not have been open to them in tfme of peace;  
particular cure is to be taken, that no part of the  
principle be expressly or virtually abandoned, as  
being no part of the law of nations. On the contrary,  
it is much to be desired, that the general principle in  
its full extent, be laid down in the stipulation. But  
as this may not be attainable, and as toomuch ought  
not to be risked by an inflexible pursuit of abstract  
right, especially against the example and the senti-  
ments of great powers having concurrent interests  
with the United States, you are left at liberty, if  
found necessary, to abridge the right in practice, as  
is done in the supplement of October, 1801, to the  
treaty of June of that year, between Russia and  
Great Britain; not omitting to provide that in case  
Great Britain should by her treaties or instructions  
leave to any other nation the right in a greater  
extent than is stipulated to the United States, they  
may claim the enjoyment of it in an equal extent.

knowing, and eventually proving, the regulations as  
they may, have actually stood in time of peace; and  
by the ruinous delays and expences attending the  
judicial, investigations. ‘The British courts have in  
¢uct admitted the distinction so far as to presume the  
lawfulness of the neutral trade with the East India  
colonies, as being generally open in peace as well as  
war; Whilst they reverse the presumption, with  
respect to-the West INdies,  
_ In addition to what is proposgd on the subject of  
blockades in Vf and VII articles, the perseverance  
of Great Britain in considering a notification of a  
blockade, and even of an intended blockade, to a  
foreign government, or its ministers at Lundon, as a  
notice to its citizens, and as rendering a vessel  
wherever found in a destination to the notified port,  
as liable to capture, calls fora special remedy. ‘Phe  
palpable injustice of the prdctice, is aggravated by  
the auxiliary rule prevailing in the British courts,  
that the blockade is to be held in legal force, until  
the governmental notification be expressly rescinded;  
however certain the fact may be that the blockade  
was never so formed or had ceased. You will be at  
no loss for topics to enforce the inconsistency of  
these innovations with the law of nations, with the  
nature of blockades, with the safety of neutral com-  
merce; and particularly with the communication  
made to this government by order of the British  
government, in the year 1804; according to which,  
the British commander and vice-admiralty courts,  
were instructed “not to consider any blockade of the  
islands’of Martinique and Guadaloupe as existing, |  
unless in respect of particular ports which may be  
actually invested, and then not to capture vessels  
bound to such ports, unless they shail previously  
lave been warned not to enter them.”  
  
The absurdity of substituting such diplomatic no-;  
tifications in place of a special warning from the  
blockading ships, cannot be better illustrated than  
by the fact, that betore the notification of a proposed}  
biockade of Cadiz, in the year’ 1805, was received  
here from eur minister at London, official informa-|  
t.on was received from Cadiz, that the blockade had!  
actually been raised by an enemy’s fleet.  
  
it may be worth your attention, that a distinction  
has been admitted by the British prize courts, in}  
consideration of the distance of the United States |  
from the European blockades, between their citi-|  
zens ancl those of states less distant; the notice re-  
quired for the former being more positive than is  
mace necessary for the latter. You will be able to  
avail yourselves in the discussion, and perhaps in  
the modification of the article, of the reasons on  
which such a distinction rests.

There remains as an object of great importance,  
  
Some adequate provision against the insults and |  
  
  
  
  
  
injuries committed by British cruizers, in the vici-|  
tuty of our shores and harbors. ‘These have been  
heretofore a topic of remonstrance, and have ina  
late instance been repeated with circumstances pe-  
citliarly provoking, as they include the murder of  
an American seaman within the jurisdittional limits  
of the United Stases. Mr. Monroe is im falt-posses- 2  
sion of the documents explaining a former instances  
Uevewith will be received those relating to the late  
one. They-not only support a just demand of an  
exemplary ptinishment of the offenders, and of  
indemnity for the spoliations, but call for some sti-  
ations guarding against such outrages in; future.  
Vith this view it is proper that ull armed bellige-  
Fent ships should, be expressly and effectually re-  
strained from making seizures, or searches, within  
2 Certain distance from our coasts, or taking sta-  
  
205  
in defining the distance protected against belli-  
gerent proceedings, it would not perhaps be unrea-  
sonable, considering the extent of the United States,  
the shoalness of their coast, and the natural indi-  
cation furnished by the well defined path of* the  
Gulph stream, to expect an immunity forXhe space  
between that limit, and the American sliore. But at  
teast it may be insisted that the extent of the neu-  
tral immunity. should ¢orrespond with the claims  
maintained by Great Britain, around her own terri-  
tory. Without any particular enquiry into the ex-  
tent of these it may be observed, ist. That the British  
act of parliament in the year 1736, 9 G. 2. ¢. 33, sup-  
posed to be that called the Hovering act, assumes for  
certain purposes ot wade, the distance of four leagues  
from the shores. 2d. That it appears that both in the  
reign of James I. and of Charles I1.* the security of  
the commerce with British ports was provided for,  
by express prohibitions ugainst the roving or hovet-  
ing of belligerent ships so near the neutral harbors  
and coasts of Great Britain, as to disturb or threaten  
vessels homeward or outward bound; as well as  
against belligerent proceedings generally, within an  
inconvenient approach towards British territory. —  
  
With this example, and with a view to what is  
suggested by our own experience, it may be ex-  
pected that the British government will not refuse  
to concur in an article to the following effect.  
  
“It is agreed that all armed vessels belonging: to  
either of the parties engaged in war, shall be effec-  
tually restrained by positive orders and penal provi-  
sions, from seizing, searching, or otherwise imter-  
rupting or disturbing vessels to whomsoever belong-  
ing, and whether outward or inward bound, within  
the harbots, or the chambers formed by headlands,  
  
  
  
lor any where at sea within the distance of four  
  
leagues from the shore, or from a right line frons  
one headland to another: It is further agreed, That,  
by like orders and provisions, all armed vessels shaii  
be effectually restrained by the party to which they  
respectively belong, from stationing themselves, or  
frou roving or hovering so near the entry of any ct  
the harbors or coasts of the others, as that mer-  
chantmen shall apprehend their passage to be un-  
safe, ora danger of being set upon aba surprised,  
and that in all cases where death shall be occasioned  
by any proceeding contrary to these stipulations,  
and the offender cannot conveniently be brought to  
trial and punishment under the laws of the party  
offended, he shall on demand imade within  
  
months be delivered up for that purpose.”  
  
If the distance of four leagues cannot be obtained,  
any distance not less than one sea league may be  
substituted in the article. It will occur to you, that  
the stipulations against the roving and hovering of  
armed ships on our coasts, so as to endanger. cr  
  
jalarm trading vessels, will acquire importance, as  
  
the space entitled to immunity shall be marrowec.  
Another object, not comprelended in the instruc-  
tions of 1804, to Mr. Monroe, is rendered important,  
by the number of illegal captures and injuries,  
which have been committed by British cruizers  
since that date. An indemnity for them, 28 due on  
every consideration of justice and friendship, and is  
fenforted by the example heretofore given by Great  
Britain herself, as well as by other nations which  
have provided by treaty, for repairing the Spolia-  
tions practised under color of their authority. zou  
will piées this as an object too reasonable not to be  
confidently expected by the United States. Many  
of the claims, indeed, for indemnification are $v  
obviously just, that a refusal to satisty them, ag  
be decently made, and ought not therefore to  
  
presumed.

the United States will not by subsequent acts of the

The same clause of the footing of the most favored  
nation, may be extended not only to navigation and  
commercial intercourse between the two nations, but  
to points which relate to the rights and duties of  
belligerents and neutrals: an arrangement which  
would secure to Great Britain the same rights in  
relation to the admission of her armed vessels in  
our ports, and to the exclusion of her enemies, pri-  
vateers and of their prizes, which are now enjoyed  
by Holland, Spain, and other most favored nations;  
  
whilst it would place the rights of the United States,  
  
as neutrals, on the same footin#® with Russia, or the  
most favored nation, in respect to search, convoys,  
blockades and contraband.  
  
If it shall be thought eligible to place the reci-  
procal commercial privileges of the two nations on  
a more definite basis than they would pe placed by  
the general expression of the most favored nation,  
(a stipulation which is liable to the difficulty of  
ascertaining the equivalent to be given in cases  
where a privilege is granted by one of the contract-  
ing parties to another nation, in exchange for some  
favor which the other contracting party cannot spe-  
cifically give,) it may be done, either by abolishing  
ail alien duties, either on vessel or cargo, or both,  
and reciprocally placing the vessels of the other  
nation, on the same footing with national vessels;  
conformably to a provision in which Great Britain  
concurred, by an act of parliament, in the year  
1802; or by fixing the maxium of alien duty, which  
each nation shall have the right to impose on the  
vessels or cargoes of the other nation. But should  
the last plan be adopted, care must be taken, Ist,  
that in fixing the maximum of the alien duty to be  
levied on vessels, all charges whatever, and under  
whatever name known, whether tonnage, light-  
house money, port charges, &amp;c. shall be included.  
2ndly, That the maximum of the alien duty to be  
levied on merchandize imported in the vessels of  
the other nation, (beyond the duties levied on simi-  
jar articles imported in the national vessels) shall  
be a per centage on the value of the merchandise  
itself, and not on the original duty. 3dly, That the  
right of imposing such maximum duties, either on  
the vessels or merchandise, shall never be exercised  
so as to contravene the other stipulation of enjoying  
  
the privileges of the most favored nation. 4thly,  
That the stipulation shall not embrace vessels and  
cargoes coming from, or going to ports, from which  
the vessels or cargoes of the United States are  
excluded.  
  
Should the expedient of a maximum be adopted,  
it must not be overlooked that the productions of  
the United States exported to Great Britain, employ  
a far greater tonnage than the exports from Great  
Britain to the United States; that the higher the  
Maximum, therefore the more favorable to Great  
Britain, who may avail herself according to the de-  
Sree of it, to secure to her vessels the carriage of  
our bulky productions, of which her duty on tobac-  
co imported in American vessels is an example,  
leaving to the United States the opportunity only of  
securing to their vessels the carriage of her unbulky  
exports; and that consequently no maximum ought  
to be admitted more unfavorable to the United  
States, than the regulations likely to prevail, if  
uncontroled by treaty. A mutual abolition of alien  
duties would probably be favorable to the navigation  
of the United States, which would then have to  
contend on equal terms with British navigation, for |  
Which it may be expected to be at least a match at  
all times, and more than a match when Great Britain  
  
which would remain unprovided for, is that of inter-  
course with the British colonies and dependencies:  
and if nothing can be obtained on that ground, care  
must also be taken in framing the article for reci-  
procally enjoying the privileges of the most favored  
nation, not to deprive the United States of the right  
of making such regulations as they may think pro-  
per in relation to vessels coming from ports from  
which their own vessels are excluded, or in relation  
generally to the intercourse with such ports.  
  
[CONFIDENTIAL—NOT PRINTED. ]  
  
As relates to the West Indies and North American  
colonies, it must bea permanent object of the United  
States to have the intercourse with them made as  
free as that with Europe. The relative situation of  
the United States and those colonies, and particular-  
ly those wants which we can alone supply, must  
necessarily produce that effect at some no very dis-  
tant period. And it should not be voluntarily retard-  
ed, either by abandoning by treaty the strong hold  
which our right of stopping the intercourse gives us;  
or by accepting any temporary or trifling privilege,  
the exercise of which would diminish the proba-  
bility of soon obtaining a perfectly free trade.

The minimum which should be accepted in rela-  
tion to the intercourse with the West Indies, will be  
the admission of our vessels laden solely with arti-  
cles of our growth, produce or manufactures, the  
importation of which in British vessels is not pro-  
hibited, on the same terms as British vessels, solely  
laden with the colonial articles, shall be admitted in  
our ports; that is to say, either without alien duties,  
or with a fixed maximum of such alien duties, with  
the two following restrictions: Ist. That Great  
Britain may prohibit our vessels from exporting from  
the British West India islands in sugar and coflee,  
more than one half of the proceeds of their inward  
cargoes: 2d. That such sugar and coffee shall be  
exported only to the United States, or that the  
vessels thus admitted in the West Indies shall be  
obliged to return and land their cargoes in the  
United States, provided they may, however, on  
their return, touch at any other West India island or  
ithe Bahamas, to complete their cargo. For it is  
jusual to carry the specie which proceeds from the  
‘sale of a cargo in the West Indies to Turk’s Island  
or the Bahamua’s, and there load with salt for the  
United States. Although those restrictions, and par-  
ticularly the first, be inconvenient, yet they may be  
acquiesced in. As respects the first restriction the  
value of our average exportations to the British  
West India islands, being six millions of dollars,  
and our exportations from thence in every article  
(sugar and coffee excepted) being three millions of  
dollars, the privilege of bringing in return in sugar  
aad coffee, one half of the value of our exportations,  
will just complete the return cargoes. But it would  
be desirable that the restriction should he altoge-  
ther dispensed with, or that Great Britain should  
allow the exportation in those two articles to the  
amount of two-thirds or three-fourths of the value  
of our cargoes. As relates to Great Britain, if she  
once yields the,point of admission, the restrictions  
which are proposed seem to be amply sufficient to  
remove her minor objections. We now import, not-  
withstanding the nominal prohibitions to some  
amount, in Amcrican vessels, about one million and  
a half dollars, being the whole amount imported  
from the British islands, in both American and  
British vessels. Fhe value of our average importa  
tions from all the world, is,
