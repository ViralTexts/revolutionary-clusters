To the President of the United States:  
					December 23, 1799  
				  
				The Senate of the United States respectfully take leave, sir, to express to you their deep regret for the loss their country sustains in the death of General George Washington. This event, so distressing to all our fellow–citizens, must be peculiarly heavy to you, who have long been associated with him in deeds of patriotism. Permit us, sir, to mingle our tears with yours: on this occasion it is manly to weep. To lose such a man at such a crisis is no common calamity to the world. Our country mourns her father. The Almighty Disposer of human events has taken from us our greatest benefactor and ornament. It becomes us to submit with reverence to Him who “maketh darkness his pavilion.”With patriotic pride we review the life of our Washington, and compare him with those of other countries who have been pre–eminent in fame. Ancient and modern names are diminished before him. Greatness and guilt have too often been allied; but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant. The destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue. It reproved the intemperance of their ambition, and darkened the splendor of victory. The scene is closed, and we are no longer anxious lest misfortune should sully his glory; he has travelled on to the end of his journey, and carried with him an increasing weight of honor; he has deposited it safely, where misfortune cannot tarnish it, where malice cannot blast it. Favored of Heaven, he departed without exhibiting the weakness of humanity: magnanimous in death, the darkness of the grave could not obscure his brightness. Such was the man whom we deplore. Thanks to God, his glory is consummated: Washington yet lives—on earth in his spotless example—his spirit is in heaven. Let his countrymen consecrate the memory of the heroic general, the patriotic statesman, and the virtuous sage. Let them teach their children never to forget that the fruit of his labors and his example are their inheritance.

With patriotic pride we review the life

Greatness and guilt have too often been al­

brilliant. The destroyers of nations stood  
abashed at the majesty of his virtue. It  
reproved the intemperance of their ambi­

end of his journey, and carried with him  
an increasing weight of honor; he has  
deposited it safely where misfortune can­  
not tarnish it—where malice cannot blast  
it. Favored of Heaven, he departed with­

The Senate of the United States |  
respectfully take leave, sir, to express  
to you their deep regret for the loss |  
their country has sustained in the ;  
death of General George &quot;NV ashing­  
ton. This event distressing to all ;  
our fellow-citizens, must be peculiarly  
heavy to you, who have so long been  
associated with him in deeds of pat­  
riotism. Permit us, sir, to mingle our j  
tears with yours: on this occasion it;  
is manly to weep. To lose such a  
man at such a crisis, is no common  
calamity to the world: our country  
mourns her Father. The Almighty  
disposer of human events has taken  
from us our greatest Beneraetor and  
ornament. It becomes us to submit  
with reverence to him, who &quot;maketh  
darkness his Pavilion.  
With Patriotic pride we review the  
life of our Washington, and compare  
him with those of other countries who  
have been pre-eminent in fame. An­  
cient and modern fames are diminish­  
ed before him. Greatness and guilt  
have too often been allied, but Ins  
fame is whiter than it is brilliant, he  
destroyer of nations stood abashed at  
the majesty of his virtue. It reprov-;  
ed the temperance of their ambition, j  
and darkened the splendor of victory.)  
The scenes closed, and we are no  
longer anxious lest misfortune should ;  
sully his glory; he has traveled on to  
the end of his journey, and carried j  
with him an increasing weight of hon­  
or; he has deposited it safely, where  
misfortune cannot tarnish it-where  
malice cannot blast it. Favored ov,  
heaven he departed without exhibit­
