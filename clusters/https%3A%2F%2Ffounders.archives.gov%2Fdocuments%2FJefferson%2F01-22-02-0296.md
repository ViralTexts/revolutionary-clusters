salination of Sea Water  
  
Novemr. 21. 1791  
  
The Secretary of state, to whom was referred by the H. of Representatives the petition of Jacob Isaacks of Newport in Rhode island, has examined into  the truth and importance of the allegations therein set forth and makes thereon the following report.  
The petitioner sets forth that by various experiments, with considerable labor and expence, he has discovered a method of converting salt water into fresh, in the proportion of 8 parts out of 10. by a process so simple that it may be performed on board of vessels at sea by the common iron Cabouse with small alterations, by the same fire; and in the same time which is used for cooking the ships provisions, and offers to convey to the government of the U.S. a faithful account of his art or secret to be used by or within the U.S. on their giving to him a reward suitable to the importance of the discovery and in the opinion of government adequate to his expences, and the time he has devoted to the bringing it into effect.  
In order to ascertain the merit of the petitioner’s discovery, it becomes necessary to examine the advances already made in the art of converting salt water into fresh.  
Ld. Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the first germs of so many branches of science, had observed that with a heat sufficient for distillation salt will not rise in vapour, and that salt water distilled is fresh. And it would seem that all mankind might have observed that the earth is supplied with fresh water chiefly by exhalation from the sea, which is in fact an insensible distillation effected by the heat of the sun. Yet this tho’ the most obvious, was not the first idea, in the essays for converting salt water into fresh. Filtration was tried in vain, and congelation could be resorted to only in the coldest regions and seasons. In all the earlier trials by distillation some mixture was thought necessary to aid the operation by a partial precipitation of the salt and other foreign matters contained in sea water. Of this kind were the methods of Sr. Richd. Hawkins in the 16th. century, of Glauber, Hauton, and Lister in the 17th. and of Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman and Dove in the 18th. Nor was there any thing in these methods worthy noting on the present occasion except the very simple still contrived extempore by capt. Chapman, and made from such materials as are to be found on board every ship great or small. This was a common pot, with a wooden lid of the usual form, in the center of which a hole was bored to receive perpendicularly a short wooden tube made with an inch and half auger, which perpendicular tube received at it’s top and at an acute angle another tube of wood also, which descended till it joined a third of pewter made by rolling up a dish and passing it obliquely thro a cask of cold water. With this simple machine he obtained 2 quarts of fresh water an hour, and observed that the expence of fuel would be very trifling, if the still was contrived to stand on the fire along with the ship’s boiler.  
In 1762. Dr. Lind, proposing to make experiment of several different mixtures, first distilled rain water, which he supposed would be the purest, and then Sea water, without any mixture, which he expected would be the least pure, in order to arrange between these two supposed extremes the degree of merit of the several ingredients he meant to try. To his great surprise as he confesses, the sea water distilled without any mixture was as pure as the rain water. He pursued the discovery and established the fact that a pure and potable fresh water may be obtained from salt water by simple distillation without the aid of any mixture for firing or precipitating it’s foreign contents. In 1767. he proposed an extempore still which in fact was Chapman’s, only substituting a gun barrel instead of Chapman’s pewter tube, and the hand pump of the ship  to be cut in two obliquely and joined again at an acute angle instead of Chapman’s wooden tubes bored express; or instead of the wooden lid and upright tube he proposed a teakettle (without it’s lid or handle) to be joined bottom upwards over the mouth of the pot, by way of still head, and a wooden tube leading from the spout to a gun barrel passing thro a cask of water the whole luted with equal parts of chalk and meal moistened with salt water.  
With this apparatus of a pot, teakettle and gun barrel the Dolphin a 20. gun ship in her voyage round the world in 1768. from 56 galls. of sea water, and with 9. lb. of wood and 69. lb. of pit coal made 42. galls. of good fresh water at the rate of 8. galls. an hour. The Dorsetshire, in her passage from Gibraltar to Mahon made 19. quarts of pure water in 4. hours with 10 lb. of wood. And the Slambal in 1773. between Bombay and Bengal with the hand pump, gun barrel and a pot of 6. galls. of sea water made 10 quarts of fresh water in 3. hours.  
In 1771. Dr. Irving putting together Lind’s idea of distilling without a mixture, Chapman’s still, and Dr. Franklin’s method of cooling by evaporation, obtained a premium of £5000. from the British parliament. He wet his tube constantly with a mop instead of passing it through a cask of water. He enlarged it’s bore also in order to give a freer passage to the vapour and thereby increase it’s quantity by lessening the resistance or pressure on the evaporating surface. This last improvement was his own. It doubtless contributed to the success of his process: and we may suppose the enlargement of the tube to be useful to that point at which the central parts of the vapour passing thro it would begin to escape condensation. Ld. Mulgrave used his method in his voyage towards the North Pole in 1773. making from 34. to 40. gallons of fresh water a day, without any great addition of fuel as he says.  
M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the world used very succesfully a still which had been contrived in 1763 by Poyssonier, so as to guard against the water being thrown over from the boiler into the pipes by the agitation of the ship, in which one singularity was that the furnace or fire box was in the middle of the boiler so that the water surrounded it in contact. This still however was expensive and occupied much room.  
Such were the advances already made in the art of obtaining fresh from salt water when Mr. Isaacks the petitioner suggested his discovery.  
As the merit of this could be ascertained by experiment only the Secretary of state asked the favor of Mr. Rittenhouse President of the Amer. Ph. soc. of Dr. Wistar professor of Chemistry [in the college of Philadelphia,] and Doctor Hutchinson professor of chemistry in the University be present at the experiments. Mr. Isaacks fixed the pot of a small Cabouse, with a tin cap, and strait tube of tin passing obliquely through a cask of cold water. He made use of a mixture the composition of which he did not explain and from 24. pints of sea water taken up about 3. miles out of the capes of Delaware at flood tide he distilled 22. pints of fresh water in 4. hours with 20. lb. of seasoned pine which was a little wetted by having lain in the rain.  
In a 2d experiment of the 21st. of March performed in a furnace and 5. gallon still at the College, from 32. pints of sea-water he drew 31. pints of fresh water in 7. H. 24. M. with 51 lb. of hiccory which had been cut about 6. months. In order to decide whether Mr. Isaacks mixture contributed in any and what degree to the success of the operation, it was thought proper to repeat his experiment under the same circumstances exactly, except the omission of  the mixture. Accordingly on the next day the same quantity of sea water was put into the same still, the same furnace was used and fuel from the same parcel. It yielded as his had done 31. pints of fresh water, in 11’ more of time and with 10. lb. less of wood.  
On the 24th. of March Mr. Isaacks performed a 3d. experiment. For this, a common iron pot of 3 1/2 galls. was fixed in brickwork, and the flue from the hearth wound once round the pot spirally, and then passed off up a chimney. The cap was of tin and a straight tin tube of about 2. I. diam. passing obliquely through a barrel of water served instead of a worm. From 16. pints of seawater he drew off 15. pints of fresh water in 2 H. 55’ with 3 lb. of dry hiccory and 8 lb. of seasoned pine. This experiment was also repeated the next day, with the same apparatus, and fuel from the same parcels, but without the mixture. 16. pints of sea water yeilded in like manner 15. pints of fresh in 1’ more of time and with 1/2 lb. less of wood. On the whole it was evident that Mr. Isaacks mixture produced no advantage either in the process or result of the distillation.  
The distilled water in all these instances was found on experiment to be as pure as the best pump water of the city: it’s taste indeed was not as agreeable; but it was not such as to produce any disgust. In fact we drink in common life in many places and under many circumstances and almost always at sea a worse tasted, and probably a less wholesome water.  
The obtaining fresh from salt water was for ages considered as an important desideratum for the use of Navigators. The process for doing this by simple distillation is so efficacious, the erecting an extempore still with such utensils as are found on board of every ship is so practicable, as to authorize the assertion that this desideratum is satisfied to a very useful degree. But tho’ this has been done for upwards of 30. years, tho it’s reality has been established by the actual experience of several vessels which have had recourse to it, yet neither the fact nor the process is known to the mass of seamen, to whom it would be the most useful, and for whom it was principally wanted. The Secretary of state is therefore of opinion that, since the subject has now been brought under observation, it should be made the occasion of disseminating it’s knowlege generally and effectually among the sea-faring citizens of the U.S. The following is one of the many methods which might be proposed for doing this. Let the Clearance for every vessel sailing from the ports of the U.S. be printed on a paper on the back whereof shall be a printed account of the essays which have been made for obtaining fresh from salt water, mentioning shortly those which have been unsuccesful, and more fully those which have succeeded; describing the methods which have been found to answer for constructing extempore stills of such implements as are generally on board of every vessel, with a recommendation, in all cases where they shall have occasion to resort to this expedient for obtaining water, to publish the result of their trial in some gazette on their return to the U.S. or to communicate it for publication to the office of the Secretary of state in order that others may, by their success be encoraged to make similar trials, and may be benefited by any improvements or new ideas which may occur to them in practice

nace or fire box was in the midale of the boiler,  
so that the wafer Surrounded&#x27;it in Con&#x27;tafr. Tim  
still, however, was expensive and occupied nuuh  
room.  
Such were the advances already made in the art  
of obtaining frefti from fait water, when Mr.  
Ifaacks, the pdtitionT, fuggerted his diScovery.  
As the merit of this could be ascertained by  
experiment only, the Secretary of State asked the  
favor of Mr. Rittenhoufe, President of the Ame­  
rican Philosophical Society, of Dt. Wiftar, pro­  
feflbr of chemistry in the college of Philadelphia,,  
and Dr. Hutchinfon, profelfor of chemistry in  
the university of Pen jfylvania, to be prefer Cat  
the experiments. Mr. Ifaacks 6xed the pot cf a  
small caboufe, with a tin cap and strait tube of  
tin pasting obliquely through a calk of cold water 5  
he made use of a mixture, the compohtioa of  
which he did not explain, and from 24 pints of  
Tea water, taken up about 3 miles our of the  
Capes of Delaware at flood tide, he distilled 22  
pints of freih water, in 4 hours, with 2olb. of  
seasoned pine, which was a little wetted by hav­  
ing lain in the rain.  
In a 2d experiment of the 21ft of March, per­  
formed in a furnace and five gallon ftiil at th«  
college, from 32 pints of sea water he drew 31  
pints of fre/h water in 7 h. 24 min. with slib.5lib.  
of hickory which had been cut about fix months.  
in Order to decide whether Mr. Ifaacks&#x27;s mixture  
contributed in any and what degree to the success  
of the operation, it was thought proper to repeat  
his dxperirrTfcnc under the fame circumstances  
exactly, except the omifiion of the mixture. Ac­  
cordingly on the next day the fame quantity ot* sea  
water was put into the fame still, the lame furnace  
was used, and fuel from the lame pa.cel. It yield­  
ed, as his had done, 31 pints.of freih water in n  
min. more of time and with lolb less of wood.  
On the 24th of March Mr. Ifaacks performed  
a3d experiment. For this, a common iron pot  
of gallons was fixed, in brick, work, and the  
flue from the hearth wound once round the poc  
fpiially, and then parted off up a chimney. Th«  
can was of tin, and a strait tin tube of about two  
inches diameter, passing obliquely through a bar­  
rel of water, Served infteard of a worm. From 16  
pints of Cca water he drew off 15 pints of frefli  
wafer in 2 h. 55 min. with 31b. of dry hickory and  
Sib. of seasoned pine. This experiment was also  
repeated the next day, with the fame apparatus  
and fuel from the lame parcel, but without the  
mixture. Sixteen pints, of sea water yielded in  
like manner 15 pints of freih, in 1 min. more of  
time and with naif a pound less of wootl* On the  
whole, it was evident that Mr. Ifaaeks&#x27;a mixrure  
produced no advantage, either in the procels or  
result of the distillation.  
Theaiftilled water in ail these instances was  
found on experiment to be as pure as the best  
pump water of the city. Its taste indeed was not  
as agreeable, but it was not such as ro produce  
any oifguft. In fa&amp;, we dr-inJc in common life,  
in many places, and under many circumstances,  
md almoit always at sea, a worse tasted, and pru­  
sably a less wholeiome water.  
The obtaining frelh from saltwater, forages was  
onfidered as an important desideratum for the us&amp;  
if navigators. The procels for doing this by  
iraple distillation is so efficacious, the ere#ing an  
xtempore ftiil with luch utenltTs as are found on  
voard of every lhip is lo practicable, as to autho­  
ize the aflertion, that this desideratum is fatisfied.  
o a very ufefui degree. But though this has been  
Lone for upwards of 30 years, though Its realitv  
las been eftablifhcd by the aCiual experience of  
everal veifeis which have hadiecouife to it, yec  
leither the fa£k nor the process i» known to the  
nafsof seamen, to whom it would be the iru-ft ofe­  
ulf and for whom it was principally wanted.  
The Secretary of State is therefoie of opinion,  
hat lincethe fubjeel has now been brought under  
►bfervation, it ihould be made the occasion of  
lifleminating its knowledge generally and effec­  
ually among th- feafaring citizrns of the United

The Secretary of Stats. to xuhom was referred, b\ the House  
of Representatives of the United States, the petition o)  
Jacob Ifaacks, of Newport, in Rkodc-ljland, has examined into the  
&#x27;truth and importance oj the allegations therein fit forth, and makes  
thereon the following  
  
REPORT.  
  
THE petitioner sets forth, that, by various experiments, with  
eonfiderable labor and expence, he has diicovered a method  
of converting fair-water into frefh, in the proportion of 8 pints  
out of 10, bv a process so simple th?.t it may be performed on  
board of velfels at sea by the common iron caboufe with small al­  
terations, by the fame fire, and in the fame time, which is used  
tor cooking the ship&#x27;s provisions ; and offers to convcy to the go­  
vernment of the United States a faithful account of his art, or se­  
cret, to be used by or svithin the United States, on their giving  
to him a reward suitable to the importance of the discovery, and,  
in the opinion of government, adequate to his expences, and the  
time lie has devoted to the bringing it into effc£t.  
  
In order to alcertain rhe merit of the petitioner&#x27;s discovery, it  
becomes necefiary to examine the advances already made in the  
art ol converting fait-water into frefh.  
  
Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for thefirft germs  
of so many branches of feience, had oMervcd, that, with a heat  
fufficicnt for diftillition, fait w:l! not rile in vapour, and that  
falt-iwater distilled, is frefh. And it would fcem that ail man­  
kind ifiight have observed, that the earth is supplied with frelh-  
Water chiefly by exhalation from the lea, which,is in fa6l an in­  
fenfib&#x27;le diitillaiion elided bv the heat of the fun. Yet this, tho&#x27;  
the moil obvious, was not the firft idea in the eflays for convert­  
ing salt-water into frefh. Filtration was tried in vain, and con­  
gelations could be relorted to only In the coideft regions and fca­  
ions. In all the earlier trials by distillation, some mixture was  
thought necelTai v to aid the operation by a partial precipitation  
of the fait, and other foreign matters contained in   
Of this kind were the methods of Sir Richard Hawkins, in the  
a6th century, of Glauber, Hauton and Lilt r, in the 17th, and  
ol Hales, Appl by, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman and Dove, ituhe  
ißih : nor was there any thing in thefc methods worthy noting  
on the present occasion, except the very simple still contrived ex­  
tempore by Capt. Chapman, and made from such materials as  
are to be found on board evciy ship, great or small. This was  
a common pot with a wooden lid of the usual form, in the cen­  
ter of which a gieathole was bored to receive perpendicularly a  
short wooden tube, made with an iuch and half auger, which  
perpendicular tube received at its top, and at an acute angle, ano­  
ther tube of wood also, which descended till it joined a third, of  
pcwrei, made bv rolli&#x27;ig ub a dish, and paflir.g it obliquely thro&#x27;  
a cask of cold water. With this simple machine he obtained two  
quarts of frrlh-watcr an hour, and observed, that the expence of  
fuel would be very trifhug, if the flill was contrived to itand on  
the fire along with the ship&#x27;s boiler.  
  
In 1762, Dr. Lind proposing to make experiments of several  
different mixtures, firft,diftiljed rain-water, which he luppofed  
would be the purcft, and then sea-water, without any mixture,  
which he expedted would be the least pure, in order to arrange  
between thele two supposed extremes the degree of merit of the  
ieveral ingredients he meant to try. &quot; To his great surprise,&quot; as  
he confeffes, the sea-water diftiiled without any mixture, was  
as pure as the rain-water. Me puriued the dilcovery and cftablilh­  
cd the fatt, th. t a pure and potable Irefli water may be obtained  
irom lait-water by limpie diftillaiion without the aid of any mix­  
ture for fining ot precipitating it&#x27;s foreign contents. In 1767,  
he propol. dan extempore still, which in fatt, was Chapman&#x27;s,  
only substituting a gun-barrel mftead of Chapman&#x27;s pewter tube,  
and the hand-pump of the {hip to be cut in two obliquely, and  
joined again at an acute angle, inftcad of Chapman&#x27;s wooden  
lubes bored express ; or, inltead of the wooden lid and upright  
tube, he proposed a tea-kettle (without its lid or handle) to be  
turned bottom upwards over the mouth of the pot, by way of  
itill-head, and a wooden tube leading from the spout to a gun­  
barrel palling through a calk of water, the whole luted with equal  
parts of chalk and meal 11101 defied with falt-W3ter.  
  
With this apparatus of a pot, tea-kettle and gun-barrel, the  
Dolphin, a 20 gun (hip, in her voyage round the woild, in 1768  
from 56 gallons o! lea-water, and with gib. of wood and 691b. of  
pit-coal, made 42 gallons of good fre(h water at the rate ot 8 gal­  
lons an hour. The Dorfetfhin ,in her palfage from Gibraltar to  
Mahon, in 1769, made 19 quarts of pure water in 4 hours with  
lolb. of wood And the Slambal, in 1773, between Bombay and  
Bengal, with a hand-pump, gun-barrel and a por, of 6 gallons of  
sea-water made 10 quarts of frefh water in 3 hours.  
In 1771, Dr. Imn, putting together Lind&#x27;s idea of distilling  
without a mixture, Chapman&#x27;s Rill, and Dr. Franklin&#x27;s method  
of cooling by evaporation, obtained a premium of 50001. from  
the British Parliament. He wet his tube conftantlv with a mop  
instead of paflirtg it through a calk of water : He enlarged its bore  
also in order to give a freer passage to the vapour, and thereby en­  
crcafe its quantity by leflening the refinance or prelfure on the  
evaporating furface : this last improvement was his own, and it  
doubtless contributed to the success of his models; and we may  
suppose the enlargement of the tube to be ufelul to that point at  
which the central parts of the vapour, paflingthrough it, would  
begin to efcapc condenfaiion. Lord Mulgrave used his method  
in his voyage towards the North Pole, in 1773, making Irom 34  
1040 gallons of frefh water a day, without any great addition of  
fuel, as he fays.  
  
M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the world, used, very  
fuccefstuliy, a still which had been contrived in 1763, by PoyHo­  
mer, so as to guard against ihe water being thrown over trom the  
boiler into the pipe, by the agitation ot the ship. In this one sin­  
gularity was, that the furnace or fire box was in the middie of the  
b&lt;&gt;&gt;ler3 so that the water fui rounded it in contact. This still, how­  
ever, was cxpenfive and occupied much room .  
Such were ihe advances already made in the art of obtaining  
ftelh from fait water, when Mr. lfaacks, the petitioner, suggested  
his discovery.  
As the merit of this could be 3fcertained by experiment only,  
the Secretary of State asked the favor of Mr. Ritlcnhoufe, Prtfident  
of the American Philofophicai Society, of Dr. Wiftar, profelTor  
of chemistry m the college of Philadelphia, and Dr. Hutchinfon,  
profeffor of chemistry in the univevfity of Pennsylvania, to be prc­  
fenr at the experiments. Mr. lfaacks fixed the pot of a small ca­  
boufe. with a tin cap and lirait tube of tin palling obliquely thro&#x27;  
  
Wednesday, November 50, ly9l.  
  
a cask of cold water ; he made use of a mixture, the compolition  
of which he did not explain, and from 24 pints of fca-wa.ter, tak­  
en up about 3 miles out of the Capes of Delaware at flood tide,  
he drilled 22 pints ot frclh water in 4 hours, with 2olb. of sea­  
soned pine, which was a little wetted by having lain in the rain.  
In a 2d experiment ot the 21ft of March, performrd in a fur­  
nace and 5 gallon still at thecollege, from 32 pints of fea-u a&#x27;er he  
drew 31 pints of trelh water in 7 h. 24 mm. with 511b. of hicko­  
ry which had been cut about 6 months. In order to decide whe­  
ther Mr. Ifaack&#x27;s mixture contributed in any and what degree to  
the success of the operation, it w.ts thought proper to repeat his  
experiment under the fame circumstances exafclly, except the o­  
miflion ot the mixture. Accordingly on the next day the fame  
quantity of sea-water was put into the fame still, the fame furnace  
was used, and fuel from the fame parcel. It yielded, as his had  
done, 31 pints of frefh water in 11 min. more of time and with  
lolb. less of wood.  
  
On the 24th of March Mr. Ifaacks performed a 3d experiment.  
For this, a common iron pot of gallons was fixrd in brick  
work, and the flue from the hearth wound once round the pot spi­  
rally, and then pasTed off up a chimney. The cap was ot tin, and  
a lira it tin tube of about two inches diameter, palling obliquely  
through a barrel of water, fcrved inttead ot a worm. From 16  
pints of sea water he drew off 15 pints of frefh water in 2 h. 55  
min. with 31b. of dry hickory and 81b. of seasoned nine. This  
experiment was also repeated Ihe next day, with the fame appa­  
ratus and fuel from the fame parcel, but without the mixture. Six­  
teen pints ot sea water yielded in like manner 15 pints of Irefh, in  
t min. more of time, and with half a pound less ot wood. O9  
the whole,it was evident that Mr. Ifaacks&#x27; mixture pioduced no adr  
vantage, either in tiie process or result of the distillation.  
  
The diltilled water in all these instances was found on expert  
ment to be as pure as the bed pump water of the city. Its taste  
indeed was not as agreeable, but it was not such as to produce  
any dlfguft. In fa£t, we drink in common life, in many places,  
and under many circumstances, and almost always at sea, a worse  
tailed, and probably a lei&#x27;s wholesome water.  
  
The obtaining frefh from fair-water, for ages was confidcred ajs  
an important defiderarum for the use of navigators. The process  
for doing this by iimple distillation is so efficacious, the erecting  
an extempore still with such ulenfils as are found on board of every  
iV.ip is so pra&amp;icable, as to authorize the aflertion, that this deside­  
ratum is fatisiicd to a very ufeful degree. But though this has  
been done for upwards of 30 years, though its reality has been ef­  
tab!ifHed by the a£lual experience of several vessels which have  
had recourse to it, yet neither the fact nor the process is known  
to the mass of seamen, to whom it would be the moil ufeful, and  
for whom it was principally wanted. The Secretary of State is  
therefore of opinion, that since the fubjeft has now been brought  
under observation, it should be made the occasion of difl*eminatin&lt;r  
its knowledge generally and effe&amp;uallv among the fea-faring citi­  
zens of the United States. The following is one of the many me­  
thods which might be fordoing this. Let the clearance for  
every vessel failing from the ports of the United States, be printed  
on a paper, on the back whereof shall be a printed account of the  
eflays which have been made for obtaining frefh from fait water  
mentioning shortly those which have been unfuccefsful, and more  
fully those which have fuccccded ; describing the methods which  
have been found to answer for conftiu£ling extempore fti||s Qf  
such implements as are generally on board of every veflel, with a  
recommendation, in all cases where they shall have occasion to  
resort to this expedient for obtaining water, to publish the result  
of tfreir trial in some gazette on their return to the United States,  
or to communicate it for publication to the office of the Secretary  
of State, in-order that others may, by their fuccels, be encouraged  
to make similar trials, and be benefitted by any improvements or  
new ideas which may occur to them in practice

Read in the houfe of reprefentatives, November 22. 1791.  
  
H F fecretary of ftate to who.n v. as referred by the houfe of reprofentatives of  
the united ftates, the petition of Jacob Haucks of Newport, in Rhode-Iflaad,  
has examined into the truth and importance of the ailegations thereia fet forth, and  
makes thercon the following  
‘ E P Oo R T.  
  
The petitioner fets forth, that, by various experiments, with confidccrable labour and  
expence, he has difcovered a method of converting falt water into frefh, in the pro-  
portion of 8 pints out of 10, by a procefs fo fimple that it may be performed on board  
of veffels at fea, by the common iron caboufe with fmall alterations, by the fame fire,  
and in the fame time, which is ufed for cooking the fhip&#x27;s provifions; and offers to con-  
vey to the government of the united ftates, a faithful account of his art or fecret, to  
be ufed by or within the united ftates, on their giving him a reward fuitable to the  
importance of the difcovery, and, in the opinion of government, adequate to his ex-  
pences, and the time he has devoted te the bringing it into effed.  
  
In order to afcertain the merit of the petitioner&#x27;s difcovery, it becomes neceflary  
to examine the advances already made in the art of converting falt water into fret.  
  
Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the firft germs of fo many branch-  
es of {cience, has obferved, that with a heat fufficient for diftillatien, falt will not rife  
in vapour, and that falt water diltilledisfrefh. And it would feem that all mankind  
might have obferved, that the earth is fupplied with freth-water chiefly by exhalation  
from the fea, which is in fae, an infenfible diftillation effected by the heat of the  
fun. Yet this, though the moft obvious, was not the firft ideain the eflays for cen-  
verting falt water into frefh. Filtration was tried in vain, and congelation could be  
reforted to only in the coldeft regions and feafons. In all the earlier trials by diftilla-  
tien, fome mixture was thought neceflary to aid the operation by a partial precipita-  
tion of the falt, and other foreign matters contained in fea-water. Of this kind  
were the methods of Sir Richard Hawkins inthe 16th century, of Glauber, Hauton  
and Lifter, in the 17th, and of Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Heffman, and  
Dove, in the 18th: nor wasthere any thing in thefe methods worthy noting on the  
prefent occafion, except the very fimple {till contrived extempore, by capt. Chap-  
man, and made from fuch materials as are to be found on board every thip, great  
cr fmall. This was a common pot with a wooden lid of the ufual form, in the  
centre of which a hole was bored to receive perpendicularly a fhert wooden tube,  
made with an inch and a half auger, which perpendicular tube received at its top,  
andat an acute angle, another tube, of wood alfo, which defcended till it joined  
  
third of pewter, made by rolling upa difh, and pafling it obliquely through a catk of  
  
cold water. With this fimple machine he ebtained two quarts of freth water an hour,  
and obferved, that the expence of fuel would be very trifling, if the ftill was contrived  
to ftand oa the fire along with the thip’s boiler.

Political Regifter. 427  
  
In 1762, Dr. Lind, propofing to make experiments of feveral different mixtures, firft  
diftilled rain-water, which he fuppofed would be the pureft, and then fea-water, with-  
out any mixture, which he expected would be the leat pure, in order to arrange  
between thefe two fuppofed extremes the degree of merit of the feveral ingredients  
he meant totry. “ To his great {urprife,”’ as he confeffes, the fea-water diftilled  
without any mixture was as pure asthe rain-water. He purfued the difcovery, and  
eftablithed the fact, that a pure and potable freth water may be obtained from falt  
water by fimple diftillation, without the aid of any mixture for fining or precipitating  
its foreign contents. In 1767,he propofedan extempore {till, which in fact was  
Chapman&#x27;s, only fubftituting a gun- barrel, inftead of Chapman&#x27;s pewter tube, and  
the hand-pump of the fhip to be cut in two obliquely, and joined again at an acute  
angle, inftead of Chapman’s wooden tubes bored exprefs ; or, inftead of the wooden  
lid and upright tube, he propofed a tea-kettle (without its lid or handle) to be turn-  
ed bottom upwards over the mouth of the pot, by way of {till-head, and a wooden  
tube leading from the {pout to a gun-barrel pafling through a catk of water, the whole  
luted with equal partsof chalk and meal moiltened with falt-water.  
  
With this apparatus of a pot, tea-kettle, anc gun-barrel, the Dolphin, a 20 gun  
fhip, in her voyage round the world, in 1768, from 56 gallons of fea-water, aad  
with glb. of wood, aud Oglb. of pit coal, made 42 gallons of good freth-water, at  
the rate of 8 gallons an hour. The Dorfetthire, in her paflage from Gibralter to  
Mahon, in 1769, made 19 quarts of pure water in 4 hours, with rolb. of wood:  
And the Slambal, in 1773, between Bombay and Bengal, witha hand-pump, gun-  
barrel, and a pot of 6 gallons of fea-water, made :o quarts of frefi water in hours.  
  
in 1771, Dr. Irvin, putting together Lind’s idea of diftilling without a mixture,  
Chapmin’s ftill, and Dr. Franklin’s method of cooling by evaporation, obtained  
premium of ;o00el. from the Britith parliament. He wet his tube conftantly with a  
mop, inftead of palling it througha cafk of water : He enlarged its bore alfo, in or-  
der tc give a freer paffage to the vapour, and thereby encreafe its quantity, by leffen-  
ing the refiftance of preflure on the evaporating furface : this laft improvement was  
his own, andit doubtlefs contributed to the fuccefs of his models; and we may fup-  
pole the enlargement of the tube to be ufeful to that point, at which the central parts  
of the vapour, pafling through it, would begin to efcape condenfation. Lord Mul-  
grave ufed this method, in his voyage towards the North Pole, in 1773, making  
from 34 to 40 gallons of frefh water a day, without any great addition of fuel, as  
he fays.  
  
M. de Bougainville, in his voyage round the world, ufed, very fuccefsfully, a ftill  
which had been contrived in 1763, by Poyflonier, fo asto guard againtt the water be-  
ing thrown over from the boiler into the pipe by the agitation of the fhip. In this,  
one fingularity was, that the furnace or fire-box was in the middle of the boiler, fo  
that the water farrounded it in contact. ‘This itill, however, was expenfive, and oc-  
cupicd much room.  
  
Such were the advances already made in the art of obtaining {refh from falt water,  
when Mr. Ifaacks, the petitioner, fuggefted his difcovery.  
  
As the merit of this could be afcertained by experiment only, the fecretary of ftate  
afked the favour of Mr. Rittenhoufe, prefident of the American Philofophical Soci-  
ety, of Dr. Wiftar, profeffor of chemiftry in the college of Philadelphia, and Dr.  
Hutchinfon, profeffor of chemiftry in the univerfity of Pennfylvania, to be prefont  
at the experiments. Mr Ifaacks fixed the pot of a {mall caboufe, with a tin cap, and  
a ftrait tube of tin, pafling obliquely through acafk of cold water ; he made ufe of  
@ mixture, the compofition of which he did not explain, and from 24 pints of fea-  
water, taken up about three miles out of the capes of Delaware at flood-tide, he di-  
ftilled 22 pints of frefh water, in 4 hours, with 20lb. of feafoned pine, which was  
a little wetted hy having lain in the rain.  
  
In a fecond experiment of the 21f of March, performed in a furnace and five gal-  
lon. ftill at the college,ffrom 32 pints of fea-water, he drew thirty one pints of freih-  
water, in 7h. 24 min. with silb. of hickory, which had been cut about fix months.  
In order to decide whether Mr. Ifaacks’s mixture contributed in any and what degree  
te the fuccefs of the operation, it was thought proper to repeat his experiment under  
the fame circumftances exactly, except the omiflion of the muxture. Accordingly on  
the next day the fame quantity of fea-water was put into the fame fil, the lame fur-

nace was ufed, andfuel from the fame parcel. It yielded, as his had done, #1 pints  
of frefh water, in Ir min. more of time and with solb. leis of wood.  
  
On the 24th of March, Mr. Maacks performed a third experiment. For this, a  
ommon iron pot of 34 gallons was fixed in brick work, and the flue from the hearth  
wound once round the pot fpirally, and then paiied off up a chimney. The cap was  
of tin, and a ftrait tintubc, of about two iuches diameter, pafling obliquely through  
a barrel of water, ferved inftead of aworm. From 16 pints of fea water he drew  
off 15 pints of frefh water, in 2h. 55 min. with 3lb. of dry hickory and 8ib,  
of feafoned pine. ‘This experiment was alfo repeated the next day, with the fame  
apparatus, and fuel from the fame parcel, but without the mixture. Sixteen pints of  
f{ea-water yielded in like manner 15 pints of freth water in 1 mifi. more of time,  
and with half a pound lefsof wood. On the whole, it was evident that Mr, Ifaacks’s  
mixture produced no advantage, cither in the precefs ur refult of the diftilla-  
tion.  
  
The diftilled water in gll thefe inftances was found, on experiment, to be as pure as  
the beft pump water of the city. Its tafte indeed was not as agreeable, but it was  
not fuch as to produce any difgult. In fact, we drink in common life, in many places,  
  
} ind under many circumflances, and almoft always at fea, a worfe tafted, and probably  
  
a leis wholcfome watcr  
  
The obtaining freth from falt water, was confidered for ages as an important defi.  
deratum for the ule of navigators. The procefs for doing this by fimple dittillation  
  
is fo efficacious, the erecting an extempore fill with fuch utenfils as are found on  
a board of every thip is fo practicable, as to authorife the affertion, that this defidera-  
&#x27;Y tum is fatisfied to a very ufeful degree. But though this has been done for upwards  
  
of 30 years, though its reality has been eftablithes ! by the aétual experience of feveral  
  
veflels which have had recourfe to it, yet neither the fa@ nor the proc ce{s is known to

Being a report by him to the American Congre/s.cn a claim  
for a reward for a discovery, alléged to have been  
made on that subject.  
  
Tur petitioner sets forth, that, by various experiments,  
with considerable labour and expence, he has discovered a  
method of converting, salt water into frefh, in the propor-  
-tion of eight ‘pints out of ten, by a procefs so simple,  
that it may be performed on board of vefsels at sea by the  
common iron cabouse, with small alterations, by the same  
fire, and in the same time, which is used for cooking the  
thip’s provisions ; and offers to convey to the government  
of the United States, a faithful account of his art, or se-  
cret, to be used by or within the United States, on their  
giving to him a reward suitable to the importance of the  
discovery, and, in the opinion of goverament, adequate  
to his expences, and the time he has devoted to the bring-  
ing it into effect.  
  
In order to ascertain the merit of the petitioner’s disco-  
very, it becomes necefsary te examine the advances al-  
ready made in the art of converting salt water into  
freth.  
  
Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the  
first germs of so many branches of science, had observed,  
that, with a heat sufficient for distillation, salt will not  
rise in vapour, and that salt water distilled, is frefh. And  
it would seem that all mankind might have observed, that  
the earth is supplied with freth water chiefly by exhalati-  
on from the sea, whichis im fact an insensible distillation  
effected by the heat of the sun. Yet this, though the

34 on the distillation of salt water. Jan. 4.  
‘most obvious, was pot the first idea in the efsays for con-  
verting salt water into frefh. Filtration was tried in  
vain, and congelations could be resorted to only in the col-  
dest regions and seasons. In all the earlier trials by dis-  
tillation, some mixture was thought necefSsary to aid the  
‘operation by a partial precipitation of the salt, and other ~  
foreign matters contained in sea water. Of this kind  
were the methods of Sir Richard Hawkins, in the 16th  
century, of Glauber, Hauton, and Lister, in the 17th,  
and of Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman,  
and Dove, in the 18th: nor was there any thing in these  
methods worth noting on the present occasion, except the  
very simple still contrived extempore by captain Chap-  
man, and made from such materials as are to be found on  
board every fhip, great or small. This was a common  
pot with a wooden lid of the usual form in the center of  
which a great hole was bored to receive perpendicularly  
a fhort wooden tube, made with an inch and half auger,  
which perpendicular tube received at its top, and at an  
acute angle, another tube of wood also, which descen-  
ded till it joined a third, of pewter, made by rolling up a  
difh, and pafsing it obliquely through a cafk of cold  
water. With this simple machine he obtained two quarts  
of frefh water an hour, and observed, that the expence  
of fuel would be very trifling, if the still was contrived  
to stand on the fire along with the fhip’s boiler.  
  
In 1792, Dr Lind proposing to make experiments of  
several different mixtures, first distilled rain water, which  
he supposed would be the purest, and then sea water,  
without any mixture, which he expected would be the  
least pure, in order to arrange between these two sup-  
posed extremes the degree of merit of the several ingre-  
dients he meant totry. ‘“ To his great surprise,” as he  
confelses, “ the sea water distilled without any mixture  
was as pure as the rain water.”” He pursued the discovery,  
  
  
  
¥793- on the distillation of salt water.  
  
and establifhed the fact, that a pure and potable freth wa-  
ter, may be obtained from salt water by simple distillation  
without the aid of any mixture for fining or precipitating  
its foreign contents. In 1767, he proposed an extempore  
still, which, in fact, was Chapman’s, only substituting a  
gun barrel instead of Chapman’s pewter tube, and the  
hand pump of the fhip to be cut in two. obliquely, and  
joined again at an acute angle, instead of Chapman’s  
wooden tubes bored exprefs; or instead of the wooden  
lid and upright tube, he proposed a tea kettle, (without its  
lid or handle,) to be turned bottom. upwards, over the  
mouth of the pot, by way of still head, and a wooden tube  
leading from the spout to a gun barrel pafsing through a.. —  
cafk of water, the whole luted with equal parts of chalk  
  
and meal moistened with salt water.  
  
With this apparatus, of a:pot, tea kettle, and gun bar-  
rel, the Dolphin, a twenty gun fhip, in her voyage round  
the world in 1768, from fifty six gallons of.sea water, and  
with nine pounds of wood, and sixty-nine pounds of pit  
coal, made forty two gallons of good frefh water at the  
rate of eight gallons an hour. The Dorsethhire, in her  
pafsage from Gibralter to Mahon, in 1769, made nineteen  
quarts of pure water in four hours with ten pounds of  
wood. And the Slambal, in.1773, between Bombay and  
Bengal, with a hand pump, gun barrel, and a pot, of six  
gallons.of sea.water made ten. quarts of freth. water in.  
three hours.. ’  
  
In 1771, Dr Irvin putting together Lind’s idea of dis-  
tilling without a mixture, Chapman’s still, and Dr Frank-  
lin’s method of cooling by evaporation, obtained a premi-  
um of L. 5003 from the Britifh parliament. “He wet his  
tube constantly with a.mop instead of pafsing it through  
a cafk of water: he enlarged its bore also, in order to give  
a freer pafsage to the vapour, and thereby increase its  
quantity by lefsening the resistance or prefsure on the ¢~

vaporating surface: this last improvement was his own,  
  
and it doubtlefs contributed to the succefs of his models ;.  
‘and we may suppose the enlargement of the tube to be  
  
useful to that point at which the central parts of the vapour,  
‘pafsing through it, would begin to escape condensation.  
  
Lord Mulgrave used his method in his voyage towards the  
north pole, 1773, making from thirty four to forty-gal-  
  
lons of frefh watet a day, without any great addition of  
fuel, as he says.  
  
M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the world,  
used very succefsfully, a still which had been contrived in  
1763, by Poyfsonier, so as to guard against the water  
being thrown over from-the boiler into the pipe, by the  
agitation of the fhip. In this, one singularity was, that  
the furnace or fire box was in the middle of the boiler, so  
that the water surrounded it in contact. This still, how-  
ever, was expensive, and occupied much room.  
  
Such were the advances already made in the art of ob-  
taining frefh fromsalt water, when Mr Isaacks, the petiti-  
oner, suggested his discovery.  
  
As the merit of this could be ascertained by experi-  
ment only, the secretary of state afked the favour of  
Mr Rittenhouse, president of the American philosophi-  
cal society, of Dr Wistar, profefsor of chemistry in the  
college of Philadelphia, and Dr Hutchinson, profefsor of  
chemistry in the university of Pensylvania, to be present:  
at the experiments. Mr Ifsaacks fixed the pot ofa small  
iron cahouse, with a tin cap, and straight tube of tin, pafsing  
obliquely through a cafk of cold water ; he made use of a  
mixture, the composition of which he did not explain, and  
from twenty-four pints of sea water, taken up about three  
miles out of the Capes of Delaware at flood tide, he dis-  
tilled twenty-two pints of frefh water in four hours, with  
twenty pounds of seasoned pine, which wasa little wetted  
by having lain in the rain.

In a second experiment on the 21st of March, oefenank  
im a furnace and five gallon still at the college, from thir-  
ty-two pints of sea water he drew thirty-one pints of  
frefh water in seven hours, twenty-four minutes, with  
fifty-one pounds of hickory which had been cut about six  
months. In order to decide whether Mr Isaack’s mixture  
contributed in any, and what degree, to the succefs of the  
operation, it was thought proper to repeat his experiment  
under the same circumstances exactly, except the omif-  
sion of the mixture.. Accordingly, on the next day, the  
same quantity of sea water was put into the same still,  
the same furnace ‘was used, and fuel from the same par-  
cel. It yielded, as his had done, thirty-one pints of freth  
water in eleven minutes more of time, and with ten  
pound lefs of wood.  
  
On the 24th of March, Mr Isaacks performed a third’  
experiment. For this, a common iron pot of 3% gallons  
was fixed in brick work, and the flue from the hearth  
wound once round the pot spirally, and then pafsed off  
up a chimney. The cape was of tin, and a straight tin tube  
ef about two inches diameter, pafsing obliquely througha.  
barrel of water, served instead. of a worm. From sixteen  
pints of sea water he drew off fifteen pints of freth water, in  
two hours fifty-five minutes, with three pounds of dry  
hickory and eight pounds of seasoned pine. This ex-  
periment was also repeated the next nay, with the same  
apparatus and fuel, from the same parcel, but without  
the mixture. Sixteem pints of sea water yielded in like  
manner, fifteen pints of frefh, in one minute more time,  
and with half a pound le{&amp; of wood. On the whole, it  
was evident that Mr Isaacks’s mixture produced no ad-  
vantage either in the procefs. or result of the distilla-  
tion.  
  
The distilled water, in all these instances, was found on  
  
experiment to be as pure as the best pump water of t

city. Its taste indeed was not as agreeable, but it was not  
such as to produce any disgust. In fact, we drink, in  
common life, in many places, and under many circum-  
stances, and almost always at sea, a worse tasted, and  
probably a lefs wholesome water.  
  
The obtaining frefh from salt water, for ages, was con-  
Sidered’ as an important desideratum for the use of naviga-  
tors. The procefs for doing this by simple distillation is  
so efficacious, the erecting an extempore still with such  
utensils as are found on board of every fhip, is so practi+  
cable, as to’ authorise the afsertion, that this desideratum  
is satisfied to a very usefuldegree. But though this has  
been done for upwards of thirty years, though. its reali-  
ty has been establiflied by the actual experience of seve-  
ral vefsels which have had recourse to it, yet. neither the  
fact nor the procefs is known.to the mafs of seamen, to  
whom it would be most useful, and for whom it was  
principally wanted. The secretary of state is therefore  
of opinion, that since the subject has now been brought  
under observation, it fhould be made the occasion of dif-  
seminating its knowledge generally and effectually among  
the seafaring citizens of the United.States. Fhe follow-  
ing is one of the many methods which might be proposed:

the United States, on their giving to him a reward suitable to the im-  
portance of the discovery, and, in the opinion of government, ade-  
quate to his expenses, and the time he has devoted to the bringing it  
into effect.  
  
In order to ascertain the merit of the petitioner’s discovery, it be-  
comes necessary to examine the advances already made in the art of  
converting salt water into fresh,  
  
Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the first germs of  
so many branches of science, had observed, that, with a heat sufficient  
for distillation, salt will not rise in vapour, and that salt water distil-  
led is fresh. And it would seem that all mankind might have observ-  
ed, that the earth is supplied with fresh water chiefly by exhalation  
from the sea, which is, in fact, an insensible distillation effected by  
the heat of thesun, Yet this, though the most obvious, was not the  
first idea in the essays for converting salt water into fresh, Filtration  
was tried in vain, and congelations could be resorted to only in the  
coldest regions and seasons. In all the earlier trials by distillation,  
some mixture was thought necessary to aid the operation by a partial  
precipitation of the salt, and other foreign matters contained in sea  
water. Of this kind were the methods of Sir Richard Hawkins, in the  
16th century; of Glauber, Hauton, and Lister, in the 17th; and of  
Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffman, and Dove, in the 18th;  
nor was there any thing in these methods worth noting on the pre-  
sent occasion, except the very simple still contrived extempore by  
Captain Chapman, and made from such materials as are to be found  
on board every ship, great or small. ‘This was a common pot with a  
wooden lid of the usual form, in the centre of which a great hole was  
bored to receive, perpendicularly, a short wooden tube, made with an  
inch and a half auger; which perpendicular tube received at its top,  
and at an acute angle, another tube of wood also, which descended till  
it joined a third, of pewter, made by rolling up a dish, and passing  
it obliquely through a cask of cold water. With this simple machine  
he obtained two quarts of fresh water an hour, and observed, that the  
expense of fuel would be very trifling, if the still was contrived to  
stand in the fire along with the ship’s boiler,  
  
In 1792, Dr. Lind proposing to make experiments of several diffe-  
rent mixtures, first distilled rain water, which he supposed would be  
the purest, and then sea water, without any mixture, which he expect-  
ed would be the least pure, in order to arrange between these two  
supposed extremes, the degree of merit of the several ingredients he  
meant totry. “To his great surprise,” as he confesses, **the sea wa-  
ter distilled without any mixture was as pure as the rain water.”’ He  
pursued the discovery, and established the fact, that a pure and pot-  
able fresh water may be obtained from salt water by simple distilla-  
tion, without the aid of any mixture for fining or precipitating its fo-  
reign contents. In 1767, he proposed an extempore still, which, in  
fact, was Chapman’s, only substituting a gun barrel instead of Chap-  
man’s pewter tube, and the hand-pump of the ship to be cut in two,  
obliquely, and joined again at an acute angle, instead of Chapman’s  
wooden tubes bored express; or instead of the wooden lid and upright

tube, he proposed a tea kettle, (without its lid or handle,) to be turned  
bottom upwards, over the mouth of the pot, by way of still head, and  
a wooden tube leading from the spout to a gun-barrel passing through  
a cask of water, the whole luted with equal parts of chalk and mea!  
moistened with salt water.  
  
With this apparatus, of a pot, tea kettle, and gun barrel, the Dol-  
phin, a twenty gun ship, in her voyage round the world in 1768, from  
fifty-six gallons of sea water, and with nine pounds of wood, and sixty  
nine pounds of pit coal, made forty-two gallons of good fresh water  
at the rate of eight gallons an hour. The Dorsetshire, in her passage  
from Gibralter to Mahon, in 1769, made nineteen quarts of pure water  
in four hours with ten pounds of wood. And the Slambal, in 1775, be-  
tween Bombay and Bengal, with a hand-pump, gun-barre!, and a pot,  
from six gallons of sea water made ten quarts of fresh water in three  
hours.  
  
In 1771, Dr. Irvine, putting together Lind’s idea of distilling with-  
out a mixture, Chapman’s still, and Dr. Franklin’s method of cooling  
by evaporation, obtained a premium of £5,000 from the British Par-  
liament. He wet his tube constantly with a mop instead’of passing  
it through a cask of water: he enlarged its bore also, in order to give  
a freer passage to the vapour, and thereby increase its quantity by  
lessening the resistance or pressure on the evaporating surface; this  
last improvement was his own, and it doubtless contributed to the  
success of his models; and we may suppose the enlargement of the  
tube to be useful to that point at which the central parts of the va-  
pour, passing through it, would begin to escape condensation. Lord  
Mulgrave used his method in his voyage towards the North Pole,  
1775, making from thirty-four to forty gallons of fresh water a day,  
without any great addition of fuel, as he says. ;  
  
M. de Bougainville in his voyage round the world, used very suc-  
cessfully a still which had been contrived in 1763, by Poyssonier,  
so as to guard against the water being thrown over from the boiler  
into the pipe, by the agitation of the ship. In this, one singularity  
was, that the furnace or fire-box, was in the middle of the boiler, so  
that the water surrounded it in contact. This still, however, was  
expensive, and occupied much room.  
  
Such were the advances already made in the art of obtaining fres)  
from salt water, when Mr. Isaacks, the petitioner, suggested his  
discovery.  
  
As the merit of this could be ascertained by experiment only, the  
Secretary of State

 and Dr. Hutchinson, Pro-  
fessor of Chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, to be present  
at the experiments. Mr. Isaacks fixed the pot of a small iron ca  
bouse, with a tin cap, and straight tube of tin passing obliquely  
through a cask of cold water; he made use of a mixture, the compo-  
sition of which he did not explain, and from twenty-four pints of sea  
water, taken up about three miles out of the Capes of Delaware at  
  
Distillation of Salt Water. 349  
  
flood tide, he distilled twenty-two pints of fresh water in four hours,  
with twenty pounds of seasoned pine, which was a little wetted by  
having lain in the rain.  
  
In a second experiment on the 21st of March, performed in a fur-  
nace and five gallon still at the college, from thirty-two pints of sea  
water he drew thirty-one pints of fresh water in seven hours, twenty-  
four minutes, with fifty-one pounds of hickory, which had been cut  
about six months. In order to decide whether Mr. Isaacks’ mixture  
contributed in any and in what degree to the success of the operation,  
it was thought proper to repeat his experiment under the same circum-  
stances exactly, except the omission of the mixture. Accordingly, on  
the next day, the same quantity of sea water was put into the same  
still, the same furnace was used, and fuel from the same parcel. It  
yielded, as his had done, thirty-one pints of fresh water in eleven  
minutes more of time, and with ten pounds less of wood.  
  
On the 24th of March, Mr, Isaacks performed a third experiment.  
For this, a common iron pot of 3 gallons was fixed in brick work,  
and the flue from the hearth wound once round the pot spirally, and  
then passed off upa chimney. The cap was of tin, and a straight  
tin tube of about two inches diameter, passing obliquely through a  
barrel of water, served instead of a worm, From sixteen pints of sea  
water he drew off fifteen pints of fresh water, in two hours fifty-five  
minutes, with three pounds of dry hickory and eight pounds of seas-  
oned pine. ‘This experiment was also repeated the next day, with  
the same apparatus and fuel, from the same parcel, but without the  
mixture. Sixteen pints of sea water yielded, in like manner, fifteen  
pints of fresh, in one minute more time, and with a half pound less  
of wood. On the whole, it was evident that Mr. Isaack’s mixture pro-  
duced no advantage either in the process or result of the distillation.  
  
The distilled water, in all these instances, was found on experi-  
ment to be as pure as the best pump water of the city. Its taste, in-  
deed, was not as agreeable, but it was not such as to produce any dis-  
gust. In fact, we drink, in common life, in many places, and under  
many circumstances, and almost always at sea, a worse tasted, and,  
  
robably, a less wholesome water.  
  
The obtaining fresh from salt water, for ages, was considered as an  
important desideratum for the use of navigation. The process for doing  
this by simple distillation is so efficacious, the erecting an extempore  
still with such utensils as are found on board of every ship, is so practi-  
cable, as to authorise the assertion, that this desideratum is satisfied toa  
very useful degree. But though this has been done for upwards of 30  
years, though its reality has been established by the actual experience of  
several vessels which have had recourse to it, yet neither the fact nor  
the process is known to the mass of seamen, to whom it would be most  
useful, and for whom it was principally wanted. The Secretary of  
State is therefore of opinion, that since the subject has now been  
brought under observation, it should be made the occasion of dissem-  
inating its knowledge generally and effectually among the seafaring  
citizens of the United States. The following is one of the many me-  
thods which might be proposed for doing this. Let the clearance for

If so, the truth deserves to be known. The practical reasons  
against its adoption we are ignorant of.  
  
‘Lord Bacon, to whom the world is indebted for the first  
germs of so many branches of science, had observed, that  
  
with a heat sufficient for distillation, salt will not rise in.  
  
vapor, and that salt water distilled is fresh. And it would  
seem that all mankind might have observed, that the earth is  
supplied with fresh water chiefly by exhalation from the sea,  
which is, in fact, an insensible distillation effected by the  
heat of the sun. Yet this, though the most obvious, was not  
the first idea in the essays for converting salt water into  
fresh. Filtration was tried in vain, and congelations could  
be resorted to only in the coldest regions and seasons.  
  
‘In all the earlier trials by distillation, some mixture was  
thought necessary to aid the operation by a partial precipita-  
tion of the salt, and other foreign matters contained in sea  
water. Of this kind were the methods of Sir Richard Haw-  
kins, in the 16th century ; of Glauber, Hauton and Lister, in  
the 17th; and of Hales, Appleby, Butler, Chapman, Hoffinan  
and Dove, in the 18th; nor was there anything in these  
methods worth noting on the present occasion, except the  
very simple still contrived extempore by Captain Chapman,  
and made from such materials as are to be found on board  
every ship, great or small.

fining or precipitating its foreign contents.

the Dolphin, a twenty gun ship, in her voyage round the  
world in 1768, from fifty-six gallons of sea water, and with  
nine pounds of wood, and sixty-nine pounds of pit coal, made  
forty-two gallons of good fresh water at the rate of eight
