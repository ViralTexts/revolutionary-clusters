						I James Wilkinson Brigadier General &amp; commander in chief of the Army of the United States, to warrant the arrest of Samuel Swartout, James Alexander Esqr. and Peter V. Ogden, on a charge of Treason, misprision of Treason or such other offence against the Government &amp; Laws of the United States as the following facts may legally Charge them with. On my Honor as a Soldier, and on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, do declare &amp; Swear, that  
							in the beginning of the month of October last when in Command at Natchitoches, A Stranger was introduced to me by Colo. Cushing, by the name of Swartout who a few minutes after the Col: retired from the room, Slipt into my hand a letter of formal introduction from Colo.  
							Burr of which the following is a Correct Copy,  
						  
					  
					  
						  
							&quot;Dear Sir,  
							Philadelphia 25th. July 1806.  
						  
						Mr. Swartout the Brother of Colo. S. of New York, being on his way down the Mississippi and presuming that He may pass you at Some Post on the River, has requested of me a letter of introduction which I give with pleasure as he is a most amiable young  
							man, and highly respectable from his Character and connections. I pray you to afford him any friendly office which his Situation may require and beg you to pardon the trouble which this may give you. With entire respect Your friend &amp; obedt. Servt.  
						  
							(Signed) Aaron Burr  
						  
						  
							His Excellency Genl. Wilkinson}&quot;  
						  
					  
					  
						Together with a Packet which he informed me he was charged by the Same person to deliver me in private. This packet contained a letter in cypher from Colo. Burr of which the following is substantially as fair an interpretation as I have heretofore been  
							able to make, the original of which I hold in my possession.  
						&quot;I (Aaron Burr) have obtained funds &amp; have actually commenced the enterprize. Detachments from different points &amp; under different pretences will rendezvous on the Ohio 1st. November. Everything internal &amp; external favors views. Protection of  
							England is secured. T. is going to Jamaica to arrange with the Admiral on that Station. It will meet on the Mississippi. England, Navy of the United States are ready to join and final orders are given to my friends &amp; followers. It will be an Host of Choice Spirits.  
							Wilkinson Shall be Second to Burr only. Wilkinson shall dictate the rank &amp; promotion of his Officers. Burr will proceed Westward 1st. August, Never to return. With him go his daughter. The Husband will  
							follow in October with a corps of Worthies.  
						&quot;Send forth with an intelligent &amp; confidential friend with whom Burr may confer. He Shall return immediately, with further interesting details. This is essential to concert and harmony of movement. Send a list of all persons known to Wilkinson west of the Mountains, who may be useful, with a note delineating their Characters. By your Messenger Send me 4 or 5 of the Commissions of your officers, which you Can borrow under any pretence you please. They shall be returned  
							faithfully. Already are orders to the Contractor given to forward Six months provisions to points Wilkinson may name. This shall not be used until the last moment &amp; then under proper injunctions. The project is brought to the Point so long desired. Burr guarantees the  
							result with his life &amp; honor, With the lives, the honor &amp; fortunes of hundreds, the best blood of our Country. Burr’s plan of operations is to move down rapidly from the falls on the 15th. of Novemr. with the first 500, or 1000 Men in light boats now Constructing  
							for that purpose, to be at Natchez between the 5th. &amp; 15th. of December, there to meet Wilkinson, Then to determine whether it will be expedient in the first instance to Seize on or pass by Baton Rouge. On receipt of this, Send Burr an answer. Draw on Burr for all  
							expences &amp;ca. The People of the Country to which we are going are prepared to receive us. Their Agents now with Burr Say, that if we will protect their Religion &amp; will not Subject them to a foreign power, that in 3 weeks all will be Settled. The Gods invite to  
							glory and Fortune. It remains to be Seen whether we Deserve the Boon. The bearer of this goes express to you. He will hand a formal letter of introduction to you from Burr. He is a man of inviolable honor and perfect discretion, formed to execute rather than to project,  
							Capable of stating facts with fidelity, and incapable of relating them other wise. He is thouroughly informed of the Plans &amp; intentions of  and will disclose to you as far as you enquire, and no further. He has imbibed a reverence  
							for your Character, and may be embarrassed in your presence. Put him at ease, and he will Satisfy you.  
						  
					  
					  
						  
							29th. July&quot;  
						  
						I instantly resolved to avail myself of the reference made to the Bearer, and in the course of some days, drew from him (the Said Swartout) the following disclosure. &quot;That he had been dispatched by Col. Burr from Philadelphia, had passed through the  
							States of Ohio and Kentucky, and proceeded from Louisville for St. Louis, where he expected to find me, but discovering at Kaskaskias, that I had descended the River, he procured a Skiff, hired hands and followed me down the Mississippi to Fort Adams, and from thence set  
							out for Natchitoches in Company with Captns. Sparks and Hooke under the pretence of a disposition to take part in the Campaign against the Spaniards then depending. That Colo. Burr with the Support of a powerful association, extending from New York to New Orleans was  
							levying an armed body of 7000 Men, from the State of New York and the Western States &amp; Territories, with a view to carry an expedition against the Mexican provinces, and that 500 Men under Colo. Swartout and a colo. or Major Tyler were to descend the Allegany, for  
							whose accommodation light boats had been built and were ready&quot;. I inquired what would be their Course. He Said, &quot;this Territory would be revolutionized, where the People were ready to join them, and that there would be Some Seizing he Supposed at New Orleans. That they  
							expected to be ready to embark about the first of February, and intended to land at vera crutz and to march from there to Mexico&quot;. I observed that there were Several Millions of Dollars in the banks of this Place, to which he replied, &quot;We Know it full well&quot; and on my  
							remarking that They certainly did not mean to violate private property, He Said they &quot;Merely Meant to borrow &amp; would return it, that they must equip themselves in New Orleans, that they expected Naval protection from Great Britain, That the Capt. … and the Officers of  
							our own Navy, were So disgusted with the Government that they were ready to join, That similar disgusts prevailed throughout the western Country where the People were zealous in favor of the enterprize, and that Pilot boat built Schooners were Contracted for along our  
							Southern Coast for their Service, that he had been accompanied from the falls of Ohio to Kaskaskias &amp; from thence to Fort Adams by a Mr. Ogden, who had proceeded on to New Orleans with letters from Colo. Burr to his friends there&quot;. Swartout asked me whether I had  
							heard from Doctor Bollman, and on my answering in the negative, He expressed great Surprize and observed, &quot;That the Doctor &amp; a Mr. Alexander had left Philadelphia before him, with dispatches for me, and that they were to proceed by Sea to New Orleans where he Said,  
							they must have arrived.&quot;  
						Tho’ determined to deceive him if possible, I could not refrain telling Mr. Swartout, it was impossible that I could ever dishonor my Commission, And I believe I duped him, by my admiration of the Plan, and by observing &quot;that although I could not join  
							in the expedition, the engagements which the Spaniards had prepared for me in my front might prevent my opposing it&quot;. Yet I did the moment I had deciphered the letter, put it into the hands of Colo. Cushing, my Adjutant and Inspector, making the declaration that I should  
							oppose the lawless enterprize with my utmost force. Mr. Swartout informed me he was under engagements to meet Colo. Burr at Nashville the 20th. of November and requested of me to write him, which I declined and on his leaving Natchitoches, about the 18th. of October, I  
							immediately employed Lieut. T. A. Smith to Convey the information in Substance to the President, without the committment of names, for from the extraordinary nature of the project, and the more extraordinary appeal to me, I could but doubt its reality notwithstanding the  
							testimony before me, and I did not attach Solid belief to Mr. Swartout’s reports respecting their intentions on this Territory &amp; City, until I received confirmatory advice from St. Louis. After my return from the Sabine I crossed the Country to Natchez and on my  
							descent of the Mississippi from that place, I found Swartout and Peter V. Ogden at Fort Adams. With the latter I had no communication, but was informed by Swartout, that he Ogden had returned So far from New Orleans, on his route to Tennessee, but had been So much alarmed  
							by Certain reports in circulation that he was afraid to proceed. I inquired whether he bore letters with him from New-Orleans, and was informed by Swartout that He did not, But that a Mr. Spence had been Sent from New Orleans through the Country to Nashville with letters  
							for Colonel Burr.  
						I reached this City the 25th. ultimo and on the next morning James Alexander Esqr. visited me. He inquired of me aside whether I had Seen Doctor Bollman, &amp; on my answering in the negative, he asked me whether I would Suffer him to conduct Bollman to  
							me which I refused. He appeared desirous to communicate Some thing, but I felt no inclination to inculpate this young man and he left me. A few days after he paid me a Second visit &amp; Seemed desirous to communicate, which I avoided, until he had risen to take leave. I  
							then raised my finger and observed, &quot;take care, you are playing a dangerous game.&quot; He answered &quot;it will succeed&quot;. I again observed, &quot;take care&quot;, and he replied with a Strong affirmation, &quot;Burr will be here by the beginning of next month&quot;. In addition to these  
							Corroborating circumstances against Alexander, I beg leave to refer to the accompanying Documents. A. &amp; B.  
						From all which I feel no hesitation in declaring under the Solemn obligation of an oath, that I do believe the Said Swartout, Alexander &amp; Ogden, have been parties to, and have being concerned in the insurrection formed or forming in the States &amp;  
							Territories on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, against the Laws and constitution of the United States.

posed to move down rapidly from the falls on the 15th of No-  
vember, with the first five hundred or thousand men, in light  
boats, then constructing for the purpose, and to reach Natchez  
within a month, where, on a meeting with Wilkinson, it was to  
be determined whether they should seize on or a by Baton  
Rouge.  
  
From these particulars we are obliged to infer the design of  
a hostile: expedition of some kind; but whether New Orleans  
was the object in view, either solely or jointly with some other  
object, does not from these particulars appear.  
  
Some light is thrown upon this object by that part of the let-  
ter which says, that “¢ the people of the country to which we  
are going are prepared to receive us; their agents, now with  
Burr, say, that if he will protect their religion, and will not sub-  
ject them to a foreign power, all will be settled in three weeks.

Covering a communication in cypher from. col.  
Aaron Burr, of which the following is substantially

session : “ I (Aaron Burr) have obtained funds  
and have actually commenced the enterprise! De­  
tachments from different points and under differ­  
ent pretences will rendezvous on the Ohis, 1st.  
November. Every internal aud external favours  
views ; protection of England is secured, • f.... is  
gone to Jamaica to arrange with the admiral on tb t  
station, and will meet at the Mississippi——Eng­  
land-navy of the United States are ready to  
join, and final orders are given to my friends and  
I followers, it will be an host of choice spirits. Wil­  
t kinson shall be second to Burr only; Wilkinson shall  
j dictate the rank and promotion of his officers. Burr  
will proceed westward 1st Aug. never to return ;  
with him go his daughter ; the husband will follow  
; in Oct. with a corps of worthies-, send forth with a  
confidential friend with whom Burr may confer ; ho  
  
bimu reiui u immediately witn interesting details;  
this is essential to concert and harmony of move­  
| ment; send a list of all persons known to Wilkin­  
son west of the mountains, who could be useful,  
! with a note delineating their characters.  
I By your messenger send me four or five of the  
[ commissions of your officers, which you can borrow  
| under any pretence you please : these shall be re­  
i turned faithfully : already arc orders to the contrac­  
tors given to forward six months provisions to  
points Wilkinson may name : this shall not be used  
until the last moment, and then under proper in­  
junctions : the project is brought to the point so  
long desired : Burr guarantees the result with his  
life and honour, the lives, the honour, and fortunes  
of hundreds, the best blood of our country; Burr’s  
plan of operations is to move down rapidly from the  
falls on the 15th Nov. with the first five hundred  
or one thousand men, in light boats, now construct­  
ing for that purpose ; to be at Natchez between the  
5th and 15th Dec. then to meet Wilkinson; then  
to determine whether it will be expedient in the first  
instance to seize on or pass by Baton Rouge : on re­  
ceipt ojf this send Burr an answer; draw on Burr  
fur all expenses, &amp;c. The people of the country to  
which we are going are prepared to receive us; their  
agents now with Burr say, that if we will protect  
their religion, and will not subject them to a fo­  
reign power, that in three weeks all will be settled.  
The Gods invite to glory and fortune : it remains  
to be seen, whether we deserve the boon ; the bear­  
er of this goes express to you ; he will hand a  
formed letter of introduction to you from Burr, a  
copy of which is hereunto subjoined : he is a man  
of inviolable honour and perfect discretion; and  
formed to execute rather than to project; capable  
of relating facts with fidelity, and incapable of re­  
lating them otherwise : he is thoroughly informed  
of the plans and intentions of and will dis­  
close to you as far as you enquire, and no further:  
he has imbibed a revereuce for your character, and  
may be embarrassed in your presence ; put him at

With entire refpcCt,  
Your friend and obedient fervant,

His Excellency

Together with a packet which he informed  
me he was charged by the fame perfon to deli­

letter in cypher from Colonel Burr, of which  
the following is fubftantially as fair an interpre­  
tation as I have heretofore been able to make,  
the original of which I hold in my pofleffion.  
“ I» (Aaron Burr) have obtained funds and  
have aClually commenced the enterprize-de­

ferent pretences wi l rendezvous on the Ohio

will follow in OClober with a corps of worthies

tial friend with whom Bnrr may confer. He  
(hall return immediately with further intereft­  
ing details—this is effential to concert and har­  
mony of movemenf. Send a lift of all perfons  
known to Wilkinfon weft of the mountains,  
who may be ufeful, with a note delineating  
their characters. By your meffenger fend me  
4 or S of the commiffions of your officers which  
you can borrow under any pretence yeu pleafe.  
They (hall be returned faithfully—Already are  
orders to the contractor given to forward fix  
months provifions to points Wilkinfon may  
name—this (hall not be ufed till the laft mo­  
ment, and then under proper injunctions—the  
project is brought to the point fo long defired—  
Burr guarantees the refult with his life and ho­  
nor—with the lives, the honor and fortunes of  
hundred?, the be/t blond of our country-—  
Burr’s plan of operation is to move down rapid­  
ly from the falls on the 15th of November with  
the fir ft 600 or lOOO men in light boats now  
conftruCting for that purpofe—to be at Nat­  
chrz between the 5th and 15th of December_

whether it will be expedient in thefirft inftance  
to fcize on or pafs by Baton Rouge—on receipt  
of this fend Burr an anfwer ; draw on Burr for  
all expcnces, fee. The people of the country

barraffed in your prefence ; put him at cafe and  
be will fatinfy you.—29th July.&quot;  
1 inflantly refolvcd to avail myfelfof the re­  
ference made to the bearer, an.I for the courfc  
of fome days drew from hitr. (the faid Swart­  
wont) the following difdofurf:—4 That lie had  
4 been difpatr.hed by Colonel Burr from Phila­  
4 delphia, bad pafTed through the Bates of O­  
4 hio and Kentucky, ami proceeded from Lou.  
4 isville for St. Louis, where he expected to  
4 find rne, but| difeovering at Kafkafkias that I  
4 had defeended the river, he procured a Stiff,  
4 hired hands, and followed me down the Mif.  
4 fiffippi to Fort Adams, and from thence fet  
4 out for Natchitoches, in company with cap­  
4 tains Sparks anel Hooke, under the pretence  
4 of a difpofition to take part in the campaign  
&#x27; againft the Spaniards then depending. That  
4 Col. Burr with the fupport of a powerful aflo­  
4 elation extending from New.York to New­  
* Orleans, was levying an armed body of 7000  
4 men from the Bate of Ncw-York and the j  
4 weftern Bates, and territories, with a view to i  
4 carry an expedition againft the Mexican pro-1  
* v:trees, a&amp;d that kotf men under Col. Swart­  
  
* wmit, and a Colonel,or M jor Tyler were to  
‘ defeend the Allegany, for whole .iccommo­  
* dation light boats had been built and were  
* ready.* I enquired what would be their  
courfe. Me faid * This territory would be rc­  
* vnlutionized, where the people were ready to  
* join them, and that there would he I&#x27;ome  
* feizing he fuppoftd at New-Orleans—that  
4 they expedted to be ready to embark, about  
4 the firft of February and intended to land at  
4 Vera Cruz, and to march from thence to  
4 Mexico * I obferved that there were feveral  
millions of dollars in the bank of this place,  
to which he replied, 4 We know it full well,*  
and on ir.y remarking that they certainly  
did not mean to violate private property, he  
faid 4 they merely meant to borrow and would  
‘ return it—that they muft equip themfelves in  
4 New-Orleans, that they expedted naval pro­  
4 tedlion from Great-Britain—That the cap­  
4 tain-and the officers of our navy were fo  
4 difgufttd with the government that they were  
4 ready to join—that limilar difguft prevailed  
4 throughout the weffern country, whete the  
‘ people were zealous in favor of the enter­  
4 prize, and that pilot-boat built fehooners were  
4 contradted for along our fouthern court far  
4 their fervice—-that he had been accompanied  
4 from the falls of Ohio, to Kalk ilkias, and  
4 from thence to Fort Adams by a Mr. Ogden,  
4 who had proceeded on to New-Orleans with  
4 letters from Col. Burr to his friends there.’  
Swartwout a Iked me whether I had heard  
from Dodlor Boll man, and on my an five ring  
in the negative, heexprefled great furprizr, and  
obferved—4 that the Dodlor and a Mr. Alexan­  
4 der had left Philadelphia before him with dif­  
4 patches for me, and that they were to pro­  
‘ ceed by fea to New-Orleans where he faid  
  
‘ they muft have arrived.  
Though determined to deceive him if poffible,  
I could not refrain telling Mr. Swartwout, it  
wa9 impoffible that I could ever dishonor my  
commiffion ; and I believe I duped him by my  
admiration of the plan, and by ofcferving, “ that  
although I could not join in the expedition—  
the engagements which the Spaniards had pre­  
pared for me in my front, might prevent my op­  
pofing it.” Yet I did, the moment I had dc­  
cyphered the letter, put it into the hands of  
Col. Cufhing, my adjutant and infpe&lt;ftor, mak­  
ing the declaration that I Should oppofe the law­  
less enterprize with my utmoft force. Mr.  
Swartwout informed me he was under engage­  
ments to meet col. Burr at Nafhville the 20th  
of November, and requested of me to write liim,  
which I declined, and on liis leaving Natchito­  
ches about the 18th of Odt. I immediately em­  
ployed lieut. T. A. Smith to convey the infor­  
mation in fubltance to the President, without  
the commitment of names, for from the extra­  
ordinary nature of the project, and the more  
extraordinary appeal to me, I could but doubt  
its reality, notwithstanding the teftimony before  
me, and I did not attach folid belief to Mr.  
Swartwout’s reports refpefling their intentions  
on this territory and city, until I received con­  
firmatory advice from St. Louis.  
After my return from the Sabine, I crofted  
the country to Natchez and on my defeent of  
the Miffiflippi from that place I found Swart­  
wout and Pvter V. Ogden at Fort Adams—with  
the latter I held no communication, but was in­  
formed by Swartwout, that he (Ogden) had re­  
turned fo far from New-Orleans on his route to  
Tennellee, but had been fo much alarmed by  
certain reports in circulation that he was afraid  
to proceed. I enquired whether he bore letters  
with him from New-Orleans, and was informed  
by Swartwout that he did not, but that a Mr.  
Spence had been fent from New-Orleans thnn’  
the country to Nafhville with letters for Col.  
Burr.  
I reached this city the 25th ultimo, and on ]  
the next morning James Alexander, efq. vifited  
me—he enquired of me afide whether I bad  
feen Doctor Bollman, and on my anfwering in j  
the negative, he afked me whether I would fuf­  
fer him to conduct Bollman to me, which I re­  
fufed. He appeared defirous to communicate  
fomething, but I felt no inclination to inculpate  
this young man and he left me. A few days af­  
ter he paid me a fecond vilit and feemed defirous  
to communicate, which I avoided, until he had  
rifen to take leave, I then raifed my finger, and  
obferved, “ take care, you are playing a dan­  
gerous game”—he anfwered—“ it will fucceed”  
—I again obferved, “take care”—and he re­  
plied with a Strong affirmation—“ Burr will be  
here by the beginning of next month”—In ad­  
dition to thefe corroborating circumftances a­  
gainft Alexander, I beg leave to refer to the ac­  
companying documents—A and B—from all  
which I feel no hesitation in cjcclnring under  
the folemn obligation of an oath, that I do be­  
lieve the faid Swartwout, Alexander and Ogden,  
have been parties to and have been concerned  
in the infurreftion formed or forming in the  
ftates and territories on the Ohio and Miffiflippi  
rivers, againft the laws and constitution of the  
United States.

ferson.  
January 26, 1807. *  
[Here are introduced gen. Wilkinson&#x27;s affidavit, Burr&#x27;s  
introductory letter to the general in favour of  
young Swartwout, and Burr’s letter in cypher to  
gen. IV. all of which were laid before the readers  
&lt;f the Ledger on Friday last. Gen. Wilkinson  
then continues to detail the circumstances relative  
to the conspiracy which had come to his knowledge,  
as follows :J  
I instantly resolved to avail (Myself of the refe­  
rence made to the bearer, and in the course of some  
days drew from him (the said Swartwout) the follow­  
ing disclosure—“ That be had been dispatched by  
  
“ c°l- Burr from Philadelphia, had passed through  
| “ the states of Ohio and Kentucky, and proceeded  
“ from lx)uisville for St. Louis, where he expected  
to find me, but discovering at Kaskaskias that I  
“ *la&lt;J descended the river, he procured a skiff, hired  
“ hands, and followed me down the Mississippi to  
“ ^ort Adams, and from thence set out for Natchi­  
“ toches, in company with captains Sparks and  
Hooke, under the pretence of a disposition to  
“ take part in the campaign against the Spaniards,  
“ tiicn depending. That col. Burr with the support  
“ of a powerful association extending from New­  
^ °rk to New Orleans, was levying an armed bo­  
“ dy of 70OO men from the state of New York and  
“ the western states, and territories, with a vievr  
“ to carry an expedition against the Mexican pro­  
“ vinces and that 500 men under col. Swartwout,  
“ and a col. or major Tyler were to descend the Al­  
“ legally, for whose accommodation light boats  
had been built and were ready. * I enquired what  
would be their course. He said “This territory  
“ would be revolutionized, where the people were  
ready to join them, and that there would be some  
“ seizing he supposed at New Orleans—that they  
“ expected to he ready to embark about the first of  
“ February and intended to land at Vera Cruiz, and*  
“ to march from thence to Mexico.” I observed  
that there were several millions of dollars in the  
hank of this place, to which he replied, “We know  
it full well, &amp; on my remarking thatthev certaii -  
Iy did not mean to violate private property, lie said  
“ they merely meant to borrow and would return it  
“ —that they must equip themselves in New Or­  
leans, that they expected naval protection from.  
“ Great Britain—That the captain-and the of­  
“ ficers of our navy were so disgusted with ti e go­  
“ vernment that they were ready to join—that the  
“ similar disgust prevailed throughout the western  
“ country where the people were z alous m favour  
“ of the enterprize, and that pilot-boat built scho &gt;­  
“ ners were contracted for along our southern coast  
“ for their service—that lie had been accompanied  
“ from the falls of Ohio, to Kaskaskias, and from  
“ thence to Fort Adams by a Mr. Ogden, who had  
“ proceeded on to New Orleans with letters from  
“ col. Burr to his triends there.” Swartwout asked  
me whether I had heard from Doctor Bollman, and  
on my answering in the negative, lie expressed great  
surprize, and observed—“ that the Doctor and a  
“ Mr. Alexander had left Philadelphia before him  
“ with dispatches for me, and that they were to  
proceed by sea to New Orleans where he said they  
“ must have arrived.”  
  
inougn determined to deceive him if possible, I  
could not refrain telling Mr. Swartwout, it was im­  
possible that I could ever dishonour my commissi­  
on ; and I believe I duped him by my admiration of  
thegpiun, and by observing, “ That although I  
could not join in the expedition—the engagements  
which the Spaniards had prepared for me in my  
front, might prevent my opposing it.” Yet I did,  
the moment I had decyphered the letter, put it into  
the hands of col. Cushing, my adjutant and inspec­  
tor, making the declaration that 1 should oppose the  
lawless enterprize with my utmost force. Mr.  
Swartwout informed me he was under engagement*  
to meet col. Burr at Nashville the 20th of &quot;Novem­  
ber, and requested of me to write him, which I  
declined, and on his leaving Natchitoches about the  
18th of October, I immediately emploved lieut.  
T. A. Smith to convey the information in substance  
to the President, without the commitment of names,  
for tioiu the extraordinary nature of the project,  
and the more extraordinary appeal to me, 1 could  
but doubt its reality, notwithstanding the testimo­  
ny before me, and I did not attach solid belief to  
Mr. Swartwout’s reports respecting their intentions  
on this territory and city, until 1 received confir­  
matory advice from St. Louis.  
After my return from the Sabine, I crossed the  
coantry to Natchez and on my descent of the Mis­  
sissippi from that place I found Swartwout and Pe­  
ter V. Ogden at Port Adams; with the latter I  
held no communication, hut was informed by Swart­  
wout, that he (Ogden) had returned so far from  
New Orleans on his route to Tennessee, but had  
been so much alarmed by certain reports hi circula­  
tion that he was afraid to proceed. 1 enquired whe­  
ther he bore letters with him from New Orleans,  
and was iniormed by Swartwout that he did not,  
but that a Mr. Spence had been sent from New Or­  
leans through the country to Nashville with letters  
for col. Burr.  
  
l reached this city the 25th wit. and on the next  
morning James Alexander, Esq. visited me—lie en­  
quired of me aside whether I had seen Dr. Bollman,  
and on my answering in the negative, he asked me  
whether 1 would sutler him to conduct llollinan to  
me, which I refused. lie appeared desirous to com­  
municate something, but I felt no inclination to in­  
culpate this young man and he left ine. A few days  
alter he paid me a second visit and seemed desirous  
to communicate, which I avoided, until he had  
risen to take leave, I then raised my finger, and ob­  
served, “ take care, you are playing a dangerous  
game”—he answered—“ it will succeed’’—I again  
observed, “ take care”—and he replied with a strong  
affirm ition—Burr will be here by the beginning of  
next month”—In addition to these corroborating  
circumstances against Alexander, I beg leave to re­  
fer to the accompanying documents—A. and B.—  
from all which I feel no hesitation in declaring un­  
der the solemn obligation of an oath, that I do be­  
lieve the said Swartwout, Alexander and Ogden, have  
been parties to and have been concerned in the in­  
surrection formed or forming in the states and ter­  
ritories on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, against  
the laws and constitution of the United States.

I instantly resolved to avail myself of the reference made to the  
bearer, and in the course of some days drew from him (the said  
Swartwout) the following disclosure.—‘ That he had been dispatch-  
ed by Col. Burr from Philadelphia, had passed through the states  
of Ohio and Kentucky, and’ proceeded from Louisville for St. Louis,  
where he expected to find me, but discovering at Kaskaskias that I  
had descended the river, he procured a skiff, hired hands and fol-  
lowed me down the Mississippi to Fort Adams, and from thence  
set out for Natchitoches, in company with captams Sparks and  
Hooke, under the pretence of a disposition to take part in the cam-  
paign against the Spaniards, then depending. That Col. Burr, with  
the support of a powerful association, extending from New-York to  
New-Orleans, was levying an armed body of 7000 men from the  
state of New-York andthe western states and territories, with 2  
view tocary an expedition against the Mexican provinces, aad that

AMERICAN STATE PAPERS&gt; 17  
  
500 men under Col. Swartwout, and a Col. or Major Tyler, were to  
  
been built and were ready.” I enquired what would be their course ;  
he said, “* this territory would be revolutionized, where the peons  
were ready to join them, and that there would be some seizing, he  
supposed, at New-Orleans ; that they expected to be ready to em-  
bark about the first of February, and intended to land at Vera Cruz,  
and to march from thence to Mexico.” I observed that there were  
several millions of dollars in the bank of that place; to which he  
replied, ‘* We know it full well ;” and on my remarking that they  
certainly did not mean to violate property, he said they ‘‘ merely  
meant to borrow, and would return it ; that they must equip them-  
selves in New-Orleans ; that they expected naval protection from  
Great Britain ; that the capt. and the officers of our navy were  
so disgusted with the government that they were ready to join ;  
that similar disgusts prevailed throughout the western country,  
where the people were zealous in favour of the enterprize, and that  
pilot boat built schooners were contracted for along cur southern  
coast for their service; that he had been accompanied from the  
falls of Ohio to Kaskaskias, and from thence to Fort Adams, by a  
Mr. Ogden, who had proceeded on to New-Orleans with letters  
from Col. Burr to his friend there.”” Swartwout asked me whether  
I had heard from Dr. Bollman ; and on my answering in the nega-  
tive, he expressed great surprize, and observed, ‘‘ That the doctor  
and a Mr. Alexander had left Philadelphia before him, with dis-  
patches for me, and that they were to proceed by sea to New-Or-  
leans, where he said they must have arrived.”  
  
Though determined to deceive him if possible, I could not-re-  
frain telling Mr. Swartwout it was impossible that I could dishon-  
otir my commission ; and | believe I duped him by my admiration  
of the plan, and by observing, ‘“* That although I could not join in  
the expedition, the engagements which the Spaniards had prepar-  
ed for me in my front, might prevent my opposing it.” Yet I did  
the moment I had decyphered the letter, put it into the hands of  
Col. Cushing, my adjutant and inspector, making the declaration  
that I should oppose the lawless enterprize with my utmost force.  
Mr. Swartwout informed me he was under engagements to meet  
Col. Burr at Nashville the 20th of November, and requested me fo  
write him, which I declined ; and on his leaving Natchitoches  
about the 18thof October, I immediately employed Lieut. T. A.  
Smith to convey the information in substance to the President,  
without the commitment of names; for from the extraordinary  
nature of the project, and the more extraordinary appeal to me, I  
could but doubt its reality, notwithstanding the testimony before  
me, and I did not attach solid belief to Mr. Swartwout’s reports  
respecting their intentions on this territory and city, until I receiv-  
ed confirmatory advice from St. Louis.  
  
After my return from the Sabine, I crossed the country to  
Natchez, and on my descent of the Mississippi from that place I  
found Swartwout and Peter V. Ogden at Fort Adams; with the  
jatter I held no communication, but was informed by Swartwout.  
that he, Ogden, had returned so far from New-Orleans, on his  
  
rout to Tennessee, but had been so much alarmed by certain re

ports in circulation that he was afraid to proceed. I enguired whe-  
ther he bore letters with him from New-Orleans, and was inform-  
ed by Swartwout that he did not, but that a Mr. Spence had been  
sent from New-Orleans through the country to Nashville, with  
letters for Col. Burr.  
  
I reached this city the 25th ultimo, and onthe next mornin  
James Alexander, Esq. visited me ; he enquired of me aside whe-  
ther I had seen doctor Bollman, and on my answering in the nega-  
tive, he asked me whether I would suffer him to conduct Bollman  
to me, which I refused. He appeared desirous of communicating  
something, but I felt no inclination to inculpate this y oung man, and  
he left me. A few days after he paid me a second visit, and seem-  
ed desirous to communicate, which I avoided, until he had risen to  
take leave ; I then raised my finger, and observed, ‘*‘ Take care,  
you are playing a dangerous game ;” he answered, ‘ It will suc-  
ceed.” I again observed, “Fake care ;” and he replied witha  
strong affirmation, «Burr will be here ‘by the beginning of next  
month.” In addition to these corroborating circumstances against  
Alexander, I beg leave to refer to the accompanying documents,  
A. B. From all which I feel no hesitation in declaring, under a  
solemn obligation of an oath, that Ido believe the said Swartwout,  
Alexander, and Ogden, have been parties to, and have been con-  
cerned in the insurrection formed or forming in the states and terri-  
tories on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, against the laws and con-
