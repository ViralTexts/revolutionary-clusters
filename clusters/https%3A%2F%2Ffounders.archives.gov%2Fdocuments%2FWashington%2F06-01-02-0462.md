Mount Vernon 17th Decr 1797.  
  
It is unnecessary, I persuade myself to assure you, that with whatsoever pleasure your letters may be received, the satisfaction to be derived from them, will fall far short of that which your company wd give: but as stern winter (which has commenced with uncommon severity) has closed all expectation of the latter, I can only offer my thanks for your kind remembrance of us in your letter of the 24th of November, while I add, as our hopes, that when all things will be blooming here, in the Spring, except the withering Proprietors of the Mansion, that you will carry into effect the long promised visit to this retreat; and make it your head quarters, during your stay in Virga.  
It was indeed, with sympathetic concern, we heard of the late  
  
calamitous situation of Philadelphia; and of the death, and indisposition of some of your friends: These occurrences, however, are inflicted by an invisible hand, as trials of our Philosophy, resignation and patience; all of which it becomes us to exercise.  
Poor Mrs Morris! I feel much for her situation; and earnestly pray that Mr Morris may, &amp; soon, work through all his difficulties; in which I am persuaded, that all who know him, heartily join me; as they do that their ease, quiet &amp; domestic enjoyments, may be perfectly restored. Mrs Marshalls arrival must be a comfort to them all, however disappointed she herself may be, in the apparent reverse of their situation, since she embarked for Europe. We hear with concern too, of the declining state of Mrs White’s health; and to her, Mrs Morris, &amp; the rest of our Phila. acquaintances, we would thank you, when occasions offer, to present our best, &amp; sincerest regards.  
Mr Fitzhugh &amp; family, have, within the last fortnight, become residents of Alexa. &amp; We should, ’ere this, have made them a congratulatory visit on the occasion, but the bad weather in which they travelled, has indisposed Mrs Fitzhugh so much, as to confine her to her room with an inflamation, more troublesome than dangerous.  
I am now, by desire of the General to add a few words on his behalf; which he desires may be expressed in the terms following, that is to say, that despairing of hearing what may be said of him, if he should really go off in an apopletic, or any other fit, (for he thinks all fits that issue in death—are worse than a love fit, a fit of laughter, and many other kinds which he could name)—he is glad to hear beforehand what will be said of him on that occasion; conceiving that nothing extra: will happen between this and then to make a change in his character for better, or for worse. And besides, as he has entered into an engagement with Mr Morris, and several other Gentlemen, not to quit the theatre of this world before the year 1800, it may be relied upon that no breach of contract shall be laid to him on that account, unless dire necessity should bring it about, maugre all his exertions to the contrary. In that case, he shall hope they would do by him as he would by them, excuse it. At present there seems to be no danger of his giving them the slip, as neither his health, nor spirits, were ever in greater flow, notwithstanding, he adds, he is descending, &amp; has almost reached, the bottom of the hill; or in other words, the  
  
shades below. For your particular good wishes on this occasion he charges me to say, that he feels highly obliged, &amp; that he reciprocates them with great cordiallity.  
Nelly Custis (who has been a little indisposed with a swelling in her face) offers her thanks for the kind expressions of your letter in her behalf, and joins the General &amp; myself in every good wish for your health and happiness. I am my dear Madam with the greatest esteem Your most Affectionate Martha Washington

“Moont Vernon 17th Dee. 1797.  
“My Dear Madam:—It is neccessarv, I  
persuade myself to assure you, that with  
whatsoever pleasure your letters may he  
received, the satisfaction to be derived from  
them will fall short of that which your com­  
pany would give:—hut as stein winter  
(which has commenced with uncommon  
severity) has closed all expectation of the  
latter, 1 can only offer my thanks for your  
kind remembrance of us in ymi letter of  
the 24th of November, while I add as our  
hopes, that when all things will lie bloom­  
ing here, in the spring, except the wither­  
ing Proprietors of the Mansion, that you  
will carry into effect the long promised vis­  
it to this retreat; and make it your head  
quarters, during your stay in Virga.  
“It was indeed, with sympathic concern,  
we heard of the late calamitous situation of  
Philadelphia, and of the death aud indispo­  
sition of some of your friends; These oc­  
currences, however, are inflicted by an in­  
visible hand, as trials of our Philosophy,  
resignation and patience; all of which it  
becomes ns to exercise.—  
“Poor Mrs. Morris! I feel much for her  
situation; and earnestly pray that Mr. Mor­  
ris may, and soon work through all his dif­  
ficulties; iu which I am persuaded, that all  
who know him, heartily join me; as they  
do that their ease, quiet and domestic hap­  
piness, may be perfectly restored. Mrs.  
Marshall&#x27;s arrival, must he a comfort to  
them all. However disappointed she her­  
self may be, in the apparent reverse of  
their situation, since she embarked for Eu­  
rope. We hear with concern too, of the  
declining state of Mrs. White’s health, and  
to her, Mrs. Morris aud the rest of our  
Philadelphiaacquaiutances, we would thauk  
you, when occasion offers, to present our  
best aud sincerest regards.  
“Mrs. Fitzhugli aud family, have within  
the last fortnight, become residents of Al­  
exandria, and we should, ere this, have  
made them a congratulatory visit on the  
occasion, but the bad weather in which  
they travelled, has indisposed Mrs, Fitz­  
hugh so much, as to couflae her to her room  
with an inflammation, more troublesome  
than dangerous.  
“I am now, by desire of the General, to  
add a few words on his behalf; which he  
desires may be expressed in the terms fol  
lowing, that is to say,—that despairing of  
hearing what may he said of him, if he  
shall really go oil&#x27; in an apopletic. or any  
other tit, (for he thinks all fits that issue in  
death, are worse than a love lit, a tit of  
laughter, and many other kinds which he  
could name) he is glad to hear beforehand  
what will be said of him on that occasion;  
conceiving that nothing extra will happen  
between this and then to make a change in  
his character for better or for worse. And  
besides, as lie lias entered into an engage­  
ment. with Mr. Morris, and several other  
gentlemen, not to quit the theatre of this  
world before the year 1800, it may be relied  
upon that no breach of contract shall be  
laid to him on that account, unless dire ne­  
cessity should bring it about, maugre all  
his exertions to the contrary. Iu that case,  
he shall hope they would do by him as lie  
would by them—excuse it. At present,  
there seems to be no danger of his giving  
them l.he slin. as neither his health nor  
  
spirits were ever in greater flow, notwith­  
standing, lie adds, he is descending, and  
has almost reached, the bottom of the hill;  
or in other woids. the shades below.  
“For your particular good wishes on this  
occasion, he charges me to say tlia&#x27; he feels  
highly obliged, aud that he reciprocates  
them with great cordiality.

minds us painfully of alienations in the last years of Wash-  
ington’s presidency. It was Mrs. Washington’s letter to  
Mrs. Elizabeth Powell in Philadelphia, but every word of it is  
in her husband’s handwriting, and evidently his composition.  
  
‘‘It was indeed, with sympathetic concern, we heard of the late  
calamitous situation of Philadelphia, and indisposition of some of  
your friends :—These occurrences, however, are inflicted by an invis-  
ible hand, as trials of our Philosophy, resignation and patience ; all  
of which it becomes us to exercise.  
  
“Poor M™ Morris! I feel much for her situation; and earnestly  
pray that M&quot; Morris may, and soon, work through all his difficulties ;  
in which I am persuaded, that all who know him heartily join me; as  
they do that their ease, quiet and domestic enjoyments, may be per-  
fectly restored. M&#x27; Marshalls arrival must be a comfort to them all,

their situation, since she embarked for Europe.  
  
M&#x27; Fitzhugh and family, have, within the last sechndahi become  
  
residents of Alex* and we should, ’ere this, have made them a con-  
&quot; gratulatory visit on the occasion, but the bad weather in which they  
travelled, has indisposed M&#x27; Fitzhugh so much, as to confine her to  
her room with an inflammation, more troublesome than dangerous.  
  
“‘T am now, by desire of the General to add a few words on his be-  
half; which he desires may be expressed in the terms following, that  
is to say,—that despairing of hearing what may be said of him, if he  
should really go off in an apoplectic, or any other fit (for he thinks all  
fits that issue in death are worse than a love fit, a fit of laughter, and  
many other kinds which he could name)—he is glad to hear before-  
hand what will be said of him on that occasion ;—conceiving that  
nothing extra: will happen between this and then to make a change in  
his character for better, or for worse.—And besides, as he has entered  
into an engagement with M&#x27; Morris, and several other Gentlemen, not  
to quit the theatre of ‘his world before the year 1800, it may be relied  
upon that no breach of contract shall be laid to him on that account,  
unless dire necessity should bring it about, maugre all his exertions  
to the contrary.—In that case, he shall hope they would do by him as  
he would do by them—excuse it. At present there seems to be no  
danger of his giving them the slip, as neither his health nor spirits,  
were ever in greater flow, notwithstanding, he adds, he is descending,  
and has almost reached, the bottom of the hill ;—or in other words,  
the shades below.—For your particular good wishes on this occasion  
he charges me to say that he feels highly obliged, and that he recip-  
rocates them with great cordiallity.  
  
“Nelly Custis (who has been a little indisposed with a swelling in her  
face) offers her thanks for the kind expressions of your letter in her  
behalf, and joins the General and myself in every good wish for your  
health and happiness.—I am my dear Madam with the greatest es-  
teem  
  
Your most affectionate  
Martha Washington.”
