Dear Sir  
Monticello July 9. 19.   
  
I am in debt to you for your letters of May 21. 27. &amp; June 22. the first delivered me by mr Greenwood gave me the gratification of his acquaintance; and a gratification it always is to be made acquainted with gentlemen of candor, worth and information, as I found mr Greenwood to be. that on the subject of mr Samuel Adams Wells shall not be forgotten in time and place, when it can be used to his advantage. but what has attracted my peculiar notice is the paper from Mecklenburg county of N. Carolina, published in the Essex Register which you were so kind as to inclose in your last of June 22. and you seem to think it genuine. I believe it spurious. I deem it to be a very unjustifiable quiz, like that of the Volcano, so minutely related to us as having broken out in N. Carolina, some half dozen years ago, in that part of the country, and perhaps in that very county of Mecklenburg, for I do not remember it’s precise locality. if this paper be really taken from the Raleigh Register, as quoted, I wonder it should have escaped Ritchie, who culls what is good from every paper, as the bee from every flower; and the National Intelligencer too, which is edited by a N. Carolinian. and that the fire should blaze out all at once in Essex, 1000. miles from where the spark is said to have fallen. but if really taken from the Raleigh Register, who is the Narrator, and is the name subscribed real, or is it as fictitious as the paper itself?   it appeals too to an original book, which is burnt, to mr Alexander who is dead, to a joint letter from Caswell, Hughes and Hooper, all dead, to a copy sent to the dead Caswell, and another sent to Doctr Williamson, whose memory, now probably dead, did not recollect, in the history he has written of N. Carolina, this Gigantic step of it’s county of Mecklenburg. Horry too is silent in his history of Marion, whose scene of action was the country bordering on Mecklenburg. Ramsay, Marshal, Jones, Girardin, Wirt, historians of the adjacent states, all silent. when mr Henry’s  resolutions, far short of independance, flew like lightning thro’ every paper, and kindled both sides of the Atlantic, this flaming declaration, of the same date, of the independance of Mecklenburg county of N. Carolina, absolving it from British allegiance, and abjuring all political connection with that nation, altho’ sent to Congress too, is never heard of. it is not known even a twelve month after when a similar proposition is first made in that body. armed with this bold example, would not you have addressed our timid brethren in peals of thunder, on their tardy fears? would not every advocate of independance have rung the glories of Mecklenburg county in N. Carolina in the ears of the doubting Dickinson and others, who hung so heavily on us? yet the example of independant Mecklenburg county in N. Carolina, was never once quoted. the paper speaks too of the continued exertions of their delegation, (Caswell, Hooper, Hughes) ‘in the cause of liberty and independance.’ now you remember as well as I do, that we had not a greater tory in Congress than Hooper: that Hughes was very wavering, sometimes firm, sometimes feeble, according as the day was clear or cloudy; that Caswell indeed was a good whig, and kept these gentlemen to the notch, while he was present; but that he left us soon, and their line of conduct became then uncertain until Penn came, who fixed Hughes and the vote of the state. I must not be understood as suggesting any doubtfulness in the state of N. Carolina. no state was more fixed or forward. nor do I affirm positively that this paper is a fabrication: because the proof of a negative can only be presumptive. but I shall believe it such until positive and solemn proof of it’s authenticity shall be produced. and if the name of M’Knitt be real, and not a part of the fabrication, it needs a vindication by the production of such proof. for the present I must be an unbeliever in this apocryphal gospel.  
I am glad to learn that mr Tickner is safely returned to his friends. but should have been much gladder had he accepted the Professorship in our University, which we should have offered him in form. mr Bowditch too refuses us. so fascinating is the vinculum of the dulce natale solum. our wish is to procure natives where they can be found, like these gentlemen, of the first order of acquirement in their respective lines; but, preferring foreigners of the 1st order to natives of the 2d we shall certainly have to go, for several of our Professors, to countries more advanced in science than we are.  
I set out within 3. or 4. days for my other home, the distance of which and it’s cross mails, are great impediments to epistolary communications. I shall remain there about 2. months: and there, here and every where, I am and shall always be affectionately &amp; respectfully Your’s.

Dear Si a:. I am in debt to vou for your and in one of them, had actually declared  
letters of May t!!st;27th, and une 52. The h,r independence on the mother country.  
nrst, delivered me by Mr. Oreenwood, gave . &quot; . .

to be. That oir the Mibject of Mr. Samuel Neither is it any proof that those move­  
Adams Wells, shall not be forgotten in time i ments were never mad . Thn imth im

tasre. f .  
. . . .  
But what has attracted mv peculiar no

oi in. i. pumibneu in iiie r.x Kegister.  
which you were to kind us to enclose in vour  
last, of June the ??d. And vou seem to

cise locality. If this paper be really taken  
O  
from the Raleigh Register, as quoted, I won­  
der it should have e?caped Ritchie, who culls  
what is good fiom every paper, as the bee  
from every llower; and the National Intelli­  
gencer, too, which is edited by a N. Caroli­  
nian: and that the fire ehou&#x27;d blaze out all at  
once in Ksscx, one thousa: J miles from  
where the spark is 6aid to have fallen. But  
if really taken from the Raleigh Register,  
who is the narrator and is the name sub­  
scribed real, oris it as fictitious as the paper  
ilpclf? It appeals, too, to an original book,  
which is burnt, to Mr. Alexander, who is  
dead, to a joint letter from Caswell, Hughes  
and Hooper, all dead, to a copy sent to the  
dead Caswell, and another sent to Dr. Wil­  
liamson, now probablod ad, whose memory  
did not recollect, in the history he has writ­  
ten of North Carolina, this gigantic step of  
its county of Mecklenburg,. &#x27; Horry, too, is  
silent in his history of Marion, whose scene  
of action was the country bordering on  
Mecklenburg. Ramsay; &#x27; Marshall, Jones,  
Girardin. Wirt, historians of the adjacent  
States, all silent. When Mr. Henry&#x27;s reso­  
lutions, far short of independence, flew like  
lightning through every paper, and kindled  
both sides of the Atlantic, this flaming decla­  
tion of the same date, of the independence  
of Mecklenburg county, of North Carolina,  
absolving it ;rom the British allegiance, and  
abjuring all political connection with that  
nation, although sent to Congress, too, is  
never heard of. It is not known even a twelve  
month after, when a! similar proposition is  
first made in that body. Arme-1 wiith this  
bold example, would not you have addressed  
our timid brethren in peals of thunder, on  
their tardy fears? Wovld not every advo­  
cate of independence have rung the glories  
of Mecklenburg county, in N. C. in the ears  
of the doubting Dickinson and others, who  
hung eo heavy on us? Yet the example of  
independent Mecklenburg county, in North  
, Carolina, was never once quoted. The paper  
speaks, too, ot the continued exertions of  
their delegation (Caswell Hooper. Hughes,)  
&quot;in the cause of liberty and independence.&quot;  
,Now, you remember as well as I do, that we  
had not a greater tory in Congress than  
Hooper; that JJughes was very -wavering.  
sometimes firm, sometimes feeble, according  
as the day was clear or cloudy; that Caswell,  
indeed, was a good whig, and &quot; kept these  
gentlemen to the notch, while he was pres­  
ent; but that he left us soon, and their line  
of conduct became then uncertain until Penn  
came, who fixed Hughes, and the vote of  
the State. I must not be understood as sug­  
gesting any doubtfulness in the State bf N.  
Carolina. No State was more fixed or for­  
ward. Nor do I affirm, positively, that this  
paper is a fabrication: because the proof of  
a negative can only be presumptive- But J  
shall believe it such until positive-and sol-.  
emn proof ot its authenticity shall be pro­  
duced. And if the name of McKnit be real,  
and not a part of the fabrication, it needs a  
vindication by the production bf such proof.  
For the present, I must be an unbeliever in  
the apocryphal gospel.

the glories of Mecklenburg county, in  
North Carolina, in the ears of the doubting  
Dickinson and others, who hung so heavily  
upon us? Yet the example of Mecklen  
burg county, in North Carolina, was never  
once quoted. The paper speaks, too, of  
the continued exertions of their delega-  
tion--Caswell, Hooper, Hughes tHewes-­  
in the cause of liberty and inde-  
pendence.&quot; Now, you remember as  
well as I do that we had not a greater Tory  
in Congress than Hooper; that Hughes  
was very wavering,-sometimes firm, some-  
times feeble, according as the day was clear  
or cloudy; that Caswell, indeed, was a  
good Whig, and kept these gentlemen to  
the noich while he was present; but that  
he left us soon, and their line of conduct  
became then uncertain until Penn came.  
who fixed Hughes and the vote of that  
State. I must not be understood as suge  
gesting any doubtfulness in the State of  
North Carolina. No State was more fixed  
or forward.&quot;
