Washington June 1st. 1812  
I communicate to Congress certain Documents, being a continuation of those heretofore laid before them, on the subject of our Affairs with Great Britain.  
Without going back beyond the renewal in 1803, of the war in which Great Britain is eng[a]ged, and omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferior magnitude; the conduct of her Government presents a series of acts, hostile to the United States, as an Independent and neutral nation.  
British cruisers have been in the continued practice of violating the American flag on the great high way of nations, and of seizing and carrying off persons sailing under it; not in the exercise of a Belligerent right founded on the Law of Nations against an Enemy; but of a municipal prerogative over British subjects. British jurisdiction is thus extended to neutral vessels, in a situation where no laws can operate but the law of nations, and the laws of the Country to which the vessels belong; and a self-redress is assumed, which, if British subjects were wrongfully detained and alone concerned, is that substitution of force, for a resort to the responsible sovereign, which falls within the definition of War. Could the seizure of British subjects, in such cases, be regarded as within the exercise of a Belligerent right, the acknowledged laws of war, which forbid an article of captured property to be adjudged, without a regular investigation before a competent Tribunal, would imperiously demand the fairest trial, where the sacred rights of persons were at issue. In place of such a trial, these rights are subjected to the will of every petty commander.  
The practice, hence, is so far from affecting British subjects alone, that under the pretext of searching for these, thousands of American Citizens, under the safeguard of public law, and of their national flag, have been torn from their country, and from every thing dear to them; have been dragged on board ships of war of a foreign nation; and exposed, under the siverities of their discipline, to be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes, to risk their lives in the battles of their oppressors, and to be the melancholy instruments of taking away those of their own brethren.  
Against this crying enormity, which Great Britain would be so prompt to avenge; if committed against herself, the United States have, in vain, exhausted remonstrances and expostulations: And that no proof might be wanting of their conciliatory dispositions, and no pretext left for a continuance of the practice, the British Government was formally assured of the readiness of the United States to enter into arrangements, such as could not be rejected, if the recovery of British subjects were the real and the sole object. The communication passed without effect.  
British cruisers have been in the practice also, of violating the rights and the peace of our Coasts. They hover over and harrass our entering and departing Commerce. To the most insulting pretentions, they have added the most lawless proceedings in our very harbors; and have wantonly spilt American blood, within the sanctuary of our territorial jurisdiction. The principles and rules enforced by that nation when a neutral nation, against armed vessals of Belligerents hovering near her coasts, and disturbing her commerce, are well known. When called on, nevertheless, by the United States to punish the greater offences committed by her own vessels, her Government has bestowed on their commanders, additional marks of honor and confidence.  
Under pretended blockades, without the presence of an adequate force, and sometimes without the practicability of applying one, our commerce has been plundered in every Sea; the great staples of our Country have been cut off, from their legitimate markets; and a distructive blow aimed at our agricultural and maritime interests. In aggravation of these predatory measures, they have been considered as in force, from the dates of their notification; a retrospective effect being thus added, as has been done in other important cases, to the unlawfulness of the course pursued. And to render the outrage the more signal, these mock blockades, have been reiterated and enforced, in the face of official communications from the British Government declaring, as the true definition of a legal Blockade “that particular ports must be actually invested, and previous warning given to vessels bound to them, not to enter.”  
Not content with these occasional expedients for laying waste our neutral trade, the Cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at length, to the sweeping system of Blockades, under the name of orders in Council; which has been moulded and managed, as might best suit its political views, its commercial jealous[i]es, or the avidity of British cruisers.  
To our remonstrances against the complicated and transcendent injustice of this innovation, the first reply was that the orders were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain, as a necessary retaliation on decrees of her Enemy proclaiming a general Blockade of the British Isles, at a time when the naval force of that Enemy dared not to issue from his own ports. She was reminded, without effect, that her own prior blockades, unsupported by an adequate naval force actually applied and continued, were a bar to this plea: that executed Edicts against millions of our property, could not be retaliation on Edicts, confessedly impossible to be executed: that retaliation to be just, should fall on the party setting the guilty example, not on an innocent party, which was not even chargeable with an acquiescence in it.  
When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our trade with her enemy, by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with Great Britain; her Cabinet, instead of a corresponding repeal, or a practical discontinuance, of its orders, formally avowed a determination to persist in them against the United States, until the markets of her enemy should be laid open to British products: thus asserting on obligation on a neutral power to require one Belligerent to encourage, by its internal regulations, the trade of another Belligerent; contradicting her own practice towards all nations, in peace as well as in war; and betraying the insincerity of those professions, which inculcated a belief that having resorted to her orders with regret, she was anxious to find an occasion for putting an end to them.  
Abandoning still more all respect for the neutral rights of the United States, and for its own consistency, the British Government now demands, as prerequisites to a repeal of its orders, as they relate to the United States, that a formality should be observed in the repeal of the French Decrees nowise necessary to their termination, nor exemplified by British usage; and that the French repeal, besides including that portion of the Decrees which operate within a territorial jurisdiction, as well as that which operates on the high seas against the commerce of the United States; should not be a single and special repeal in relation to the United States, but should be extended to whatever other neutral nations, unconnected with them, may be affected by those Decrees. And as an additional insult, they are called on for a formal disavowal of conditions and pretentions advanced by the French Government, for which the United States are so far from having made themselves responsible; that, in official explanations; which have been published to the world, and in a correspondence of the American Minister at London with the British Minister for foreign affairs, such a responsibility was explicitly and emphatically disclaimed.  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain, that the commerce of the United States is to be sacrificed, not as interfering with the Belligerent rights of Great Britain; not as supplying the wants of her enemies, which she herself supplies; but as interfering with the monopoly which she covets for her own commerce and navigation. She carries on a war against the lawful commerce of a friend, that she may the better carry on a commerce with an enemy; a commerce polluted by the forgeries and perjuries, which are, for the most part, the only passports by which it can succeed.  
Anxious to make every experiment, short of the last resort of injured nations, the United States have withheld from Great Britain, under successive modifications, the benifits of a free intercourse with their market; the loss of which could not but outweigh the profits accruing from her restrictions of our commerce with other nations. And to entitle these experiments to the more favorable consideration, they were so framed, as to enable her to place her adversary under the exclusive operation of them. To these appeals her Government has been equally inflexible; as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort, rather than yield to the claims of justice, or renounce the errors of a false pride. Nay, so far were the attempts carried, to overcome the attachment of the British Cabinet to its unjust Edicts, that it received every encouragement, within the competency of the Executive branch of our Government, to expect that a repeal of them, would be followed by a war between the United States and France, unless the French Edicts should also be repealed. Even this communication, although silencing for ever the plea of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in those Edicts, originally the sole plea for them, received no attention.  
If no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British Government against a repeal of its orders, it might be found in the correspondence of the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at London and the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs; in 1810, on the question whether the Blockade of May 1806 was considered as in force, or as not in force. It had been ascertained that the French Government, which urged this Blockade as the ground of its Berlin Decree, was willing, in the event of its removal, to repeal that Decree; which being followed by alternate repeals of the other offensive Edicts, might abolish the whole system on both sides. This inviting opportunity for accomplishing an object so important to the United States, and professed so often to be the desire of both the Belligerents, was made known to the British Government. As that Government admits that an actual application of an adequate force is necessary to the existance of a legal Blockade, and it was notorious, that if such a force had ever been applied, its long discontinuance had annulled the Blockade in question, there could be no sufficient objection on the part of Great Britain to a formal revocation of it; and no imaginable objection to a declaration of the fact, that the Blockade did not exist. The declaration would have been consistent with her avowed principles of Blockade; and would have enabled the United States to demand from France the pledged repeal of her Decree; either with success, in which case the way would have been opened for a general repeal of the Belligerent Edicts; or without success, in which case the United States would have been justified in turning their measures exclusively against France. The British Government would, however, neither rescind the Blockade; nor declare its non-existence; nor permit its nonexistence to be inferred and affirmed by the American Plenipotentiary. On the contrary by representing the Blockade to be comprehended in the orders in Council, the United States were compelled so to regard it, in their subsequent proceedings.  
There was a period when a favorable change in the policy of the British Cabinet, was justly considered as established. The Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britanic Majesty here, proposed an adjustment of the differences more immediately endangering the harmony of the two Countries. The proposition was accepted with the promptitude and cordiality corresponding with the invariable professions of this Government. A foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere and lasting reconciliation. The prospect, however, quickly vanished. The whole proceeding was disavowed by the British Government, without any explanation which could, at that time, repress the belief, that the disavowal proceeded from a spirit of hostility to the commercial rights and prosperity of the United States. And it has since come into proof, that at the very moment, when the public Minister was holding the language of friendship, and inspiring confidence in the sincerity of the negociation with which he was charged, a secret agent of his Government was employed in intrigues, having for their object, a subversion of our Government, and a dismemberment of our happy union.  
In reviewing the conduct of Great Britain towards the United States, our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare just renewed by the Savages, on one of our extensive frontiers; a warfare which is known to spare neither age nor sex, and to be distinguished by features peculiarly shocking to humanity. It is difficult to account for the activity, and combinations, which have for some time been developing themselves among tribes in constant intercourse with British traders and garrisons, without connecting their hostility with that influence; and without recollecting the authenticated examples of such interpositions, heretofore furnished by the officers and agents of that Government.  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and indignities which have been heaped on our Country: and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and conciliatory efforts have not been able to avert. It might at least have been expected, that an enlightened nation, if less urged by moral obligations, or invited by friendly dispositions on the part of the United States would have found, in its true interest alone, a sufficient motive to respect their rights and their tranquility on the high seas, that an enlarged policy would have favored that free and general circulation of Commerce, in which the British nation is at all times interested, and which in times of war, is the best alleviation of its calamities to herself, as well as to other Belligerents; and, more especially, that the British Cabinet, would not, for the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile markets, have persevered in a course of measures, which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable market of a great and growing Country, disposed to cultivate the mutual advantages of an active commerce.  
Other Councils have prevailed. Our moderation and conciliation, have had no other effect than to encourage perseverance, and to enlarge pretentions. We behold our seafaring Citizens still the daily victims of lawless violence committed on the great common and high way of nations, even within sight of the Country which owes them protection. We behold our vessels, freighted with the products of our soil and industry, or returning with the honest proceeds of them, wrested from their lawful destinations, confiscated by prize courts, no longer the organs of public law, but the instruments of arbitrary Edicts; and their unfortunate crews dispersed and lost, or forced, or inveigled in British ports, into British fleets: whilst arguments are employed, in support of these aggressions, which have no foundation but in a principle equally supporting a claim, to regulate our external commerce, in all cases whatsoever.  
We behold, in fine, on the side of Great Britain a state of war against the United States; and on the side of the United States, a state of peace towards Great Britain.  
Whether the United States shall continue passive under these progressive usurpations, and these accumulating wrongs; or, opposing force to force in defence of their national rights, shall commit a just cause into the hands of the Almighty disposer of events; avoiding all connections which might entangle it in the contests or views of other powers, and preserving a constant readiness to concur in an honorable re-establishment of peace and friendship, is a solemn question, which the Constituation wisely confides to the Legislative Department of the Government. In recommending it to their early deliberations, I am happy in the assurance, that the decision will be worthy the enlightened and patriotic Councils, of a virtuous, a free, and a powerful Nation.  
Having presented this view of the relations of the United States with Great Britain, and of the solemn alternative growing out of them, I proceed to remark, that the communications last made to Congress, on the subject of our relations with France, will have shown, that since the revocation of her Decrees, as they violated the neutral rights, of the United States, her Government has authorized illegal captures, by its privateers and public ships: and that other outrages have been practiced, on our vessels and our Citizens. It will have been seen also, that no indemnity had been provided or satisfactorily pledged, for the extensive spoliations committed under the violent and retrospective orders of the French Government, against the property of our Citizens seized within the jurisdiction of France. I abstain, at this time, from recommending to the consideration of Congress, definitive measures with respect to that nation, in the expectation, that the result of unclosed discussions between our Minister Plenipotentiary at Paris and the French Government, will speedily enable Congress to decide, with greater advantage, on the course due to the rights, the interests, and the honor of our Country.

I communicate to congress certain  
documents, being a continuation of  
those heretofore laid before them, on  
the subject of our affairs with Great  
Britain.  
  
Without going beyond the renewal  
in 1803, of the war in which Great  
Britain is engaged, and omitting un¬  
repaired wrongs of inferior magnitude,  
the conduct of her government pre¬  
sents a series of acts hostile to the  
United States as an independent and  
neutral nation. ‘  
  
British cruizers have been in the  
continued practice of violating the  
American nag on the great hi^way  
of nations, and of seizing and carry¬  
ing off persons sailing under it, not in  
the exercise of a belligerent right,  
founded on the law of nations, against  
an enemy, but of a municipal prero¬  
gative over British subjects. British  
jurisdiction is thus extended to neu*

tnl veuels in a situation where no  
laws can operate but the law of na¬  
tions and the laws of the country to  
which the vessels belong; and a self¬  
redress is assumed, which, if British  
subjects were wrongfully detained  
and alone concerned, is that substitu¬  
tion of force for a resort to the re¬  
sponsible sovereign, which falls with¬  
in the definition of war. Could the  
seizure of British subjects, in such  
cases, be regarded as within the ex¬  
ercise of a belligerent right, the ac¬  
knowledged laws of war, which for¬  
bid an article of captured property  
to be adjudged without a regular in¬  
vestigation before a competent tribu¬  
nal, would imperiously demand the  
fairest trial, where the sacred rights  
of persons were at issue. In place of  
such trial, these rights are subjected  
to the will of every petty command¬  
er.  
  
The practice, hence, is so far from  
affecting British subjects alone, that  
under the pretext of searching for  
these, thousands of American citi¬  
zens, under the safe-guard of public  
laws, and of their national flag, have  
been tom from their country, and  
from every thitig dear to them,—  
have been dragged on board ships of  
war of a foreign nation, and exposed,  
under the severities of their discipline,  
to be exiled to the most distant and  
deadly climes, to risk their lives in  
the battles of their oppressors, and to  
be the melancholy instruments of ta¬  
king away those of their own bre¬  
thren.  
  
Against this crying enormity,  
which Great Britain would be so  
prompt to avenge if committed against  
herself, the United States have in  
vain exhausted remonstrances and ex¬  
postulations ; and that no proof  
inight be wanting of their concilia¬  
tory dispositions, and no pretext left  
  
for continuance of the practice, the  
British government was formally as¬  
sured of the readiness of the United  
States to enter into arrangements, such  
as could not be rejected, if the reco¬  
very of the British su^ects were the  
real and sole object. The communi¬  
cation passed without effect.  
  
British cruisers have been in the  
practice also of violating the rights  
and peace of our coasts. They ho¬  
ver over and harass our entering and  
departing commerce. To the most  
insulting pretensions they have added  
lawless proceedings in our very har¬  
bours, and have wantonly spilt Ame¬  
rican blood within the sanctuary of  
our territorial jurisdiction. The  
principles and rules enforced by that  
nation, when a neutral nation, against  
armed vessels of belligerents hovering  
near her coasts, and disturbing her  
commerce, are well known. When  
called on, nevertheless, by the United  
States to punish the greater offences  
committed by her own vessels, her  
government has bestowed on their  
commanders additional marks of ho^  
nour and confidence.  
  
Under pretended blockades, with¬  
out the presence of an adequate force,  
and sometimes without the practica¬  
bility of applying one, our commerce  
has been plundered in every sea, the  
great staples of our country have  
been cut off from their legitimate  
markets; and a destructive blow aim¬  
ed at our agricultural and maritime  
interests. In aggravation to these  
predatory measures, they have been  
considered as in force from the dates of  
their notification ; a retrospective ef¬  
fect being thus added, as has been  
done in other important cases, to the  
unlawfulness of the course pursued :  
and to render the outrage more sig¬  
nal, these mock blockades have been  
reiterated and enforced in the face of

official communications from the Bri*  
tish government, declaring, as the  
true definition of a legal blockade,  
** that particular ports must be ac¬  
tually invested, and previous warning  
given to vessels bound to them not to  
enter.’*  
  
Not content with these occasional  
expedients for laying waste our neu¬  
tral trade, the cabinet of Great Bri¬  
tain resorted, at length, to the sweep¬  
ing system of blockades, under the  
name of orders in council, which has  
been moulded and managed as might  
best suit its political views, its com¬  
mercial jealousies, or the avidity of  
British cruisers.  
  
To our remonstrances against the  
complicated and transcendant injus¬  
tice of this innovation, the first reply  
was, that the orders were reluctantly  
adopted by Great Britain as a neces¬  
sary retaliation on decrees of her ene¬  
my proclaiming a general blockade of  
the British isles, at a time when the  
naval force of the enemy dared not to  
issue from his own ports She was re¬  
minded without effect, that her own  
prior blockades, unsupported by an  
adequate naval force actually applied  
and continued, were a bar to this  
plea; that executed edicts against  
millions of our property could not be  
retaliation on edicts confessedly im¬  
possible to be executed ; that retalia¬  
tion, to be just, should fall on the  
party setting the guilty example, not  
on an innocent party, which was not  
even chargeable with an acquiescence  
in it.  
  
When deprived of this flimsy veil  
for a prohibition of our trade with  
- Great Britain, her cabinet, instead of  
a corresponding repeal, or a practical  
discontinuance of its orders, formally  
avowed a determination to persist in  
them against the United States, un¬  
til the markets of her enemy should  
  
be laid open to British products;  
thus asserting an obligation on a neu¬  
tral power to require one belligerent  
to encourage, by its internal regula¬  
tions, the trade of another beuige-  
rent; contradicting her own practice  
towards all nations in peace as well  
as in war; and betraying the insince¬  
rity of those professions which incul-  
cated a belief, that, having resorted  
to her orders with regret, she was an¬  
xious to find an occasion for putting  
an end to them. -  
  
Abandoning still more all respect  
for the neutral rights of the United  
States, and for its own consistency,  
the British government now demands  
as pre-requisites to a repeal of its  
orders, as they relate to the United  
States, that a formality should be ob¬  
served in the repeal of the French de¬  
crees nowise necessary to their ter¬  
mination, nor exemplified by British  
usage ; and that the French repeal,  
besides including that portion of the  
decrees which operates within a ter¬  
ritorial jurisdiction, as well as that  
which operates oiT the high seas  
against the commerce of the United  
States, should not be a single special  
repeal in relation to the United States,  
but should be extended to wb i*ever  
other neutral nations unconi &quot;ted  
with them may be affected with .luse  
decrees.  
  
And as an additional insult, they  
are called on for a formal disavowal  
of conditions and pretensions advan¬  
ced by the French government, for  
which the United States are so far  
from having been themselves respon¬  
sible, that, in official explanations  
which have been published to the  
world, and in a correspondence of the  
American minister at London with  
the British minister for foreign aSairs,  
such a responsibility was explicitly  
and empliatically disclaimed.  
  
APPENDIX—STATE PAPERS.  
  
SOI  
  
It has become, indeed, sufficiently&#x27;  
certain that the commerce of the Uni¬  
ted States is to be sacrificed, not as  
interfering with the belligerent rights  
of Great Britain—not as supplying  
the wants of their enemies, which she  
herself supplies—but as interfering  
with the monopoly which she covets  
for her own commerce and navigation.  
She carries on a war against the law¬  
ful commerce of a friend, that she may  
the better carry on a commerce with  
an enemy,—a commerce polluted by  
the forgeries and perjuries which are  
for the most part the only passports&#x27;  
by which it can succeed.  
  
Anxious to make every experiment  
short of the last resort of injured na¬  
tions, the United States have with¬  
held from Great Britain, under suc¬  
cessive modifications, the benefits of  
a free intercourse with their market,  
the loss of which could not but out¬  
weigh the profits accruing from her  
restrictions of our commerce with  
other nations. And to entitle those  
experiments tp the more favourable  
consideration, they were so framed as  
to enable her to place her adversary  
under the exclusive operation of them.  
To these appeals her government has  
been equally inflexible, as if willing to  
make sacrifices of every sort, rauier  
than yield to the claims of justice, or  
renounce the errors of a fuse pride.  
Nay, so far were the attempts carried  
to. overcome the attachment of the  
British cabinet to its unjust edicts,  
that it received every encouragoment,  
within the competency of the execu¬  
tive branch of our government, to ex-  
TCct that a repeal of them would be  
followed by a war between the United  
States and France, unless the French  
edicts should also be repealed. Even  
this communication, although silen¬  
cing for ever the plea of a disposition  
in the United States to acquiesce in  
  
those edicts, originally the sole plea  
for them, received no attention.  
  
If no other proof existed of a pre¬  
determination of the British govern¬  
ment against a repeal of its orders, it  
might be found in the correspondence  
of the minister plenipotentiary of the  
United States at London, and the  
British secretary for foreign affairs  
in 1810, on the question whether the &#x27;  
blockade of May, 1806, was consi¬  
dered in force or as not in force. It  
had been ascertained that the French  
government, which urged this block¬  
ade as the ground of its decree, was  
willing, in the event of its removal,  
to repeal that decree; which being  
followed by alternate repeals of the  
other offensive edicts, might abolish  
the whole system on both sides. This  
inviting opportunity for accomplish¬  
ing an object so important to the U-  
nited States, and professed so often  
to be the desire of both the bellige¬  
rents, was made known to the British  
government. As that government ad¬  
mits that an actual application of an  
adequate force is necessary to the ex¬  
istence of a legal blockade, and it was  
notorious that if suoh a force had ever  
been applied, its long discontinuance  
had annulled the blockade in question,  
there could be no sufficient objection  
on the part of Great Britain to a for¬  
mal revocation of it; and po imagin¬  
able objection to a declaration of the  
fact that the blockade did not exist.  
The declaration would have been con¬  
sistent with her avowed principles of  
blockade, and would have enabled the  
United States to demand from France  
the pledged repeal of her decrees; ei¬  
ther with success—in which case the  
way would have been opened for a ge¬  
neral repeal of the belligerent edicts,  
—or without success, in which case  
the United States would have been  
justified in turning their measures ex-

clusively against France. The British  
government would, however, neither  
rescind the blockade, nor declare its  
non-existence, nor permit its non-ex¬  
istence to be inferred and affirmed by  
the American plenipotentiary. On the  
contrary, by representing the block¬  
ade to be comprehended m the orders  
in council, the United States were com¬  
pelled so to regard it in their subse¬  
quent proceedings.  
  
There was a period, when a favour¬  
able change in the policy of the Bri¬  
tish cabinet was justly considered as  
established. The minister plenipoten¬  
tiary of his Britannic majesty here,  
proposed an adjustment of the differ¬  
ences more immediately endangering  
the harmony of the two countries.  
The proposition was accepted with  
a promptitude and cordiality, corre¬  
sponding with the invariable profes¬  
sions of this government. A founda¬  
tion appeared to be laid for a sincere  
and lasting reconciliation. The pros¬  
pect, however, quickly vanished. The  
whole proceeding was disavowed by  
the British government, without any  
explanation which could at that time  
repress the belief, that the disavowal  
proceeded from a spirit of hostility to  
the commercial rignts and prosperity  
of the United States: and it has since  
come into proof, that, at the very mo¬  
ment when the public minister was  
holding the language of friendship,  
and inspired confidence in the since¬  
rity of the negociation with which he  
was charged, a secret agent of his go¬  
vernment was employed in intrigues,  
having for their object a subversion  
of our government, and a dismember¬  
ment of our happy union.  
  
In reviewing the conduct of Great  
Britain towards the United States,  
nur attention is necessarily drawn to  
the warfare just renewed by the sa¬  
vages on one of our extensive fron¬  
  
tiers ; a warfare which is known to  
spare neither age nor sex, and to ba  
distinguished by features particularly  
shocking to humanity. It is difficult  
to account for the activity and com¬  
binations which have for some time  
been developing themselves among  
the tribes in constant intercourse with  
British traders and garrisons, without  
connecting their hostility with that  
influence; and without recollecting  
the authenticated examples of such  
interpositions heretofore furnished by  
the officers and agents of that govern¬  
ment.  
  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and  
indignities which have been heaped on  
our country; and such the crisis which  
its unexampled forbearance and con¬  
ciliatory efforts have not been able to  
avert. It might at least have been  
expected, that an enlightened nation,  
if less urged by moral obligations, or  
invited by friendly dispositions on the  
part of the United States, would have  
found in its true interests alone a suf¬  
ficient motive to respect their rights  
and their tranquillity on the high seas:  
that an enlarged policy wo^ have  
favoured the free and general circula¬  
tion of commerce, in which the Bri¬  
tish nation is at all times interested,  
and which in time of war is the best  
alleviation of its calamities to herself,  
as well as the other belligerents; and  
more especially that the British cabi¬  
net would not, for the sake of a pre¬  
carious and surreptitious intercourse  
with hostile markets, have persevered  
in a course of measures which neces¬  
sarily put at hazard the invaluable  
market of a great and growing coun¬  
try, disposed to cultivate the mutual  
advantages of an active commerce.  
  
Other councils have prevailed. Our  
moderation and conciliation have had  
no other effect than to encourage per¬  
severance, and to enlarge pretensions.

We behold our seafaring citizens still  
the daily victims of lawless violence  
committed on the great and common  
highway of nations, even within the  
sight of the country which owes them  
protection. We behold our vessels  
freighted with the products of our  
soil and industry, or returning with  
the honest proceeds of them, wrested  
from their lawful destinations, confis*  
cated by prize courts, no longer the  
organs of public law, but the instru*  
ments of arbitrary edicts, and their  
unfortunate crews dispersed and lost,  
or forced or inveigled in British ports  
into British fleets ; whilst arguments  
are employed in support of these ag¬  
gressions, which have no foundation  
but in a principle equally supporting  
a claim to regulate our external com¬  
merce in all cases whatsoever.  
  
We behold, in fine, on the side of  
Great Britain, a state of war against  
the United States ; and, on the side  
of the United States, a state of peace  
towards Great Britain.  
  
Whether the United States shall  
continue passive under these progres¬  
sive usurpations, and these accumu¬  
lating wrongs, or, opposing force to  
force in defence of their natural rights,  
shall commit a just cause into the hands  
of the Almighty Disposer of events,  
avoiding all connections which might  
entangle it in the contests or views of  
other powers, and preserving a con¬  
stant readiness to concur in an ho¬  
nourable re-establishment of peace  
and friendship, is a solemn question,  
which the constitution wisely confides  
to the legislative department of the  
government. In recommending it to  
their early delibei-ations, I am nappy  
in the assurance, that the decision will  
be worthy the enlightened and patri¬  
otic councils of a virtuous, a free, and  
a powerful nation.  
  
Having presented this view of the  
  
relations of the United States with  
Great Britain, and of the solemn al¬  
ternative growing out of them, I pro¬  
ceed to remark, that the communica¬  
tions last made to congress on the  
subject of our relations with France,  
will have shewn, that since the revo¬  
cation of her decrees, as they violated  
the neutral rights of the U nited States,  
her government has authorised illegal  
captures by its privateers and public  
ships ; and that other outrages have  
been practised on our vessels and our  
citizens. It will have been seen, also,  
that no indemnity had been provided,  
or satisfactorily pledged, for the ex¬  
tensive spoliations committed under  
the violent and retrospective order of  
the French government against the  
property of our citizens seized with¬  
in tne jurisdiction of France.  
  
I abstain at this time from recom¬  
mending to the consideration of con¬  
gress definitive measures with respect  
to that nation, in the expectation,  
that the result of the enclosed dis¬  
cussions between our minister pleni¬  
potentiary at Paris, and the French  
government, will speedily enable con¬  
gress to decide with greater advan¬  
tage, on the course due to the rights,  
the interests, the honour of our coun¬  
try. James Madisok

United States,  
I communicate to Congress certain docu­  
ments, being a continuation of those hereto­  
fore laid before them, on the subject of our  
affairs with Great-Britain.  
v Without going back beyond the renewal in  
1803 of the war in which G. Britain is engag­  
ed, and omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferi­  
or magnitude, the conduct of her governpnent  
presents a series of acts hostile to the U. S. as  
an independent and neutral nation.  
British cruisers have been in the continued  
practice of violating the American flag on the  
great highway of nations, and of seizing and  
carrying off persons sailing under it; not in  
the cx^cise of a belligerent right, founded on  
the la&#x27;w of nations against an enemy, but of a  
municipal prerogative over British subjects.  
British jurisdiction is thus extended to neu­  
tral vessels in a situation where no laws can  
operate but the law of nations and the laws of  
j the countiy to which the vessels belong ; and  
j a self-redress is assumed, which, if British  
! subjects were wTongfully detained and alone  
concerned, is that substitution of force for a  
resoit to the responsible sovereign, which falls  
I within the definition ©f war. Could the sei­  
| zure of British subjects, in such cases, be re­  
garded as within the exercise of a belligerent  
right, the acknowledged laws of war, which  
forbid an article of captured property to be ad­  
judged, without a regular investigation before  
a competent tribunal, would imperiously de­  
mand the fail :st trial where the sacred rights  
of persons were at issue. In place of such a  
trial, these rights are subjected to the will of  
every petty commander.

ing British subjects alone, that under the pre­  
text of searching for these, thousands of A­  
inerican citizens, under the safeguard of pub­  
lic law, and of their national flag, have been  
torn from their country and from every thing  
dear to them ; have been dragged on board  
ships of war of a foreign nation, and exposed  
under the severities of their discipline, to be  
exiled to the most distant and deadly climes,  
to risk their lives in the battles of their op­  
pressors, and to be the melancholy instru­  
ments ol taking away those of their own bre­  
thren.  
Against this crying enormity, which G. Bri­  
tain would be so prompt to avenge if commit­  
ted against herself, the U. Slates have in  
vaiw exhausted remonstrances and expostu­  
lations. And that no proof might be wanting  
of their conciliatory dispositions, and no pre­  
text left for a continuance of tht practice, the  
British government was formally assured cf  
the readiness of the U. States to enter into  
arrangements, such as could not be rejected,  
if the recovery of British subjects were the  
real and the sole object. The communication  
passed without effect.  
British cruizers have been in the practice  
also of violating the rights and the peace of  
our coasts. They hover over and harra**  
our entering and departing commerce, io  
the most insulting pretensions they have ad­  
ded the most lawless proceedings in our ve­  
ry harbors ; and have wantonly spilt Ameri­  
can blood within the sanctuary of our territo­  
rial jurisdiction. The principles and rules  
enfoiced by that nation, when a neutral nation*  
against armed vessels ol belligerents hovering  
near her coasts, and disturbing her commerce,  
are well known. When called on neverth­  
less, by the U. States to punish 11:e greau?  
offences committed bv hoi* own vcsboU, l.e*&#x27;  
government has bestowed on their coinuinii^&#x27;

iiv invested, and previous warning given  
;:ssels bound to them, not to enter.M  
content with these occasional expedi­  
• for hying waste our neutral trade, the ca­  
\ of Great Britain resorted, at length, to  
sweeping system of blockades, under tne  
ie of the Orders in Council, which has  
o moulded and managed, as might best  
. ;ts political views, its commercial jea­  
sies, or the avidity of British cruisers,  
fo our remonstrance* against the compli­  
transcendant injustice of this inno­  
[on, the first reply was that the orders were  
jct uitly adopted by Great Britain as a ne­  
saly retaliation on decrees of her enemy  
claiming a general blockade of the British  
s, at a time when the naval force of that  
iny dared not to issue from his own ports&#x27;.  
f iias reminded, without effect, that her  
i prior blockade, unsupported by an ade­  
tc naval force actually applied and conti­  
d, were a bar to this plea.: that executed  
;ts against millienfr of our property could  
be retaliation on edicts confessedly impos­  
e to be executed ; that retaliation, to be  
, should fall o» the party setting the guil­  
xample, not on an innocent party, which  
not even chargeable with an acquiescence  
  
When deprived ot this nimsy veil ior a pro­  
hibition of our trade with bar enemy, by the  
repenl of his prohibition of our trade with G.  
Britain, her cabinet, instead of a correspond­  
it&#x27;g repeal or a practical discontinuance ot its  
orders, formally avowed a determination to  
persist in them against the United States, un­  
til tbe markets of her enemy should be laid  
open to British products ; thus asserting an  
obligation on a neutral power to require one  
belligerent to encourage, by its internal re­  
gulations, the trade of another belligerent;  
contradicting her own practice towards all na­  
tions in peace as well as in war; and betray­  
ing the insincerity of those professions which  
inculcated a belief that, having resorted to  
her orders with regret, she was anxious to  
find an occasion for putting an end to them.  
Abandoning still more all respect for the  
neutral rights of the United States, and for its  
own consistency, the British government now  
demands as prerequisites to a repeal of its or­  
ders, as they relate to the United States, that  
a formality should be observed in the repeal  
of the French decrees nowise necessary to  
(heir termination, nor exemplified by British  
Lage; and that the French repeal, besides in­  
ducing that portion of the decrees which ope­  
rates within a territorial jurisdiction as well  
25 that which operates on the high seas u­  
ydnst the commerce of the United States,  
should not he a singie special repeal in rela­  
tion to the United States, but should be ex­  
tended to whatever other neutral nations un­  
connected with them may be affected by those  
decrees. And as an addditional insult, they  
He called on for a formal disavowal of condi­  
tion and pretentions advanced by the French  
ytnemnient, for which the United States are  
hi from having made themselves respon­  
se, that, in official explanations, which have  
ken published to the world, and in a corres­  
pondence, of the American minister at Lon­  
**°*i with the British Minister for Foreign Af­  
such a responsibility was explicitly and  
emphatically disclaimed.  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain  
tiiat the commerce of the United States is to  
he sacrificed, not as interfering with the bel­  
  
ciu ngncs ot ureat Britain, not as sup­  
the wants of her enemies, which she  
herself supplies; but as interfering with the  
Monopoly which she covets for her own com­  
n&#x27;ei‘ce and navigation. She carries on a war  
Against the lawful commerce of a friend, that  
5l;e the better carry on a commerce with  
*a enemy, a commerce polluted by the forge­  
r,es perjuries which are for the most part  
dve only passports by which it can succeed.  
Anxious to make every experiment short  
01 tnc last resort of injured nations, the Unit­  
c i States have withheld from Great Britain,  
tirnh-r successive modifications, the benefits  
^taiice intercomse with their market, the  
&#x27;,8S °* which could not but outweigh the  
profits accruing from her restrictions of our  
c.nnmerce with other nations. And to entitle  
,1;sc experiments to the more favorable con­  
* aeration, they were so framed as to enable  
aei t0 pi &#x27;ce her adversary under the exclu­  
**,c °P* rationof them. To these appeals her  
MHenllnent has been equally inflexible, as if  
i1:!ng »0 n»«he sacrific* s of every sort, ra­  
aci dian yield to the ciaitns of justice or re­  
nounce the errors of a false, pride. Nay, so  
d Wr&#x27;r? the attempts carried, to overcome  
•aUuCnuicnt oi the British Cabinet toils  
r hlls* that it received every encou­  
^ r^ment, within the competency of the Ex­  
branch c)four goverumeut, to expect  
**&#x27;a repeal ot them wouUl be followed by a  
] * ^ rV.votn ,lJu\ V. States-and France, un­  
“c i ench’ edicts should also bo repealed.  
  
Even this communication, although silencing  
for ever the plea of a disposition in the United  
States to acquiesce in those edicts, originally  
the sole plea for them, received no attention.  
If no other proof existed of a prede­  
termination of the British Government  
against a repeal of its orders, it might be  
found in the correspondence of the Minis­  
ter Plenipotentiary of the United States  
at London, and the British Secretary for  
Foreign Affairs in 1810, on the question  
whether the blockade of May 1806 was  
considered as in force cr as not in force.  
It had been ascertained that the French  
government, which urged this blockade  
as the ground of its Berlin decree, was  
willing, in the event of its removal, to re­  
peal that decree; which being followed  
by alternate repeals of the other offensive  
edicts, might abolish the whole system  
on both sides. This inviting opportunity&#x27;  
for accomplishing an object so important  
to the United States, and professed  
so often to be the desire of both the  
belligerents, was made known to the  
British Government. As that government  
admits that an actual application of an ade­  
quate force is necessary to the existence ol a  
legal blockade, and it was notorious, that if  
&quot;such a force had ever been applied, its long  
discontinuance had annulled the blockade in  
question, there could be no sufficient objec­  
tion on the part of Great-B) itain to a formal  
revocation of it ; and no imaginable objec­  
tion to a declaration of the fact that the block­  
ade did not exist. The declaration would |  
have been consistent with her avowed princi­  
ples of blockade, and would have enabled  
the United States to demand from France the  
pledged repeal of her decrees j either with  
success, in which case the way would have  
been opened for a general repeal of the bcl­  
  
ligerent edicts ; or without success, in which  
case the United Stales would have been justi­  
fied in turning their measures exclusively a­  
gainst France. The British government would,  
however, neither rescind the blockade nor de­  
clare iis non-existence; nor permit its non­  
existence to he inferred and affirmed by the A­  
merican Plenipotentiary. On the, contrary by  
representing the blockade to b&lt;? comprehend­  
ed in the orders in council, the United States  
were compelled so to regard it in their sub- j  
sequent proceedings.. . J  
There was a period when a favorable change j  
in the policy of the British cabinet was justly  
considered as established. The minister ple­  
nipotentiary of his Britannic majesty here pro­  
posed an adjustment of the differences more  
immediately endangering the harmony of the  
two countries, 1 he proposition w-.s accept­  
ed with a promptitude and cordiality corres­  
ponding with the invariable professions of this  
government. A foundation appeared to be  
laid for a sincere and lasting reconciliation —  
The prospect, however, quickly vanished.—  
The whole proceeding was disavowed by the \
British government without any explanation :  
which could at that time repress the belief,  
that the disavowal proceeded from a spirit of  
hostility to the commercial rights and pros­  
perity of the United States. And it has since  
come into proof, that at the very moment when  
the public ministd was holding the language  
of friendship, and inspiring confidence in the  
sincerity of the ncgociation with which lie was  
charged, a secret agent of his government  
was employed in intrigues, having for their  
object a subversion of our government, and a  
dismemberment of our happy Union.  
In reviewing the conduct of Great Britain  
towards the United States, our attention is ne­  
cessarily drawn to the warfare just renewed  
by the savages on one of our extensive fron­  
tiers; a warfare which is known to spare nei­  
ther age nor sex, arid to be distinguished by  
features peculiarly shocking to humanity. It  
is difficult to account for the activity and com­  
l* _ i * _ \ i _ r .. _ _ .:_- u -_ _i _

veloping themselves among the tribes in con­  
stant intercourse with British traders and gar­  
risons, without connecting their hostility with j  
that influence; and without recollecting the j  
authenticated examples of such interposi- r  
tions heretofore furnished by the officers and j  
agents of thst government.  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and Indig- S  
nities which have been heaped on our coun- [  
try; and such the crisis which its unexam-1  
pled forbearance and conciliatory efforts have j  
not been able to avert. It might at least have j  
been expected, that an enlightened nation, if \
less urged by moral obligations, or invited by 1  
friendly dispositions on the p u t of the United  
States, would have found in its true interest  
alone a sufficient motive to respect their rights  
and their tranquility on the high seas ; that an j &#x27;  
enlarged policy would have favored that free &#x27;  
and general circulation of commerce, in which I i  
the British nation is at all times interested, and -  
which in times of war is the best alleviation *  
of its calamities to herself, as well as to other  
belligerents ; and more especially that the , &lt;  
British cabinet would not, for the sake of a s  
precarious and surreptitious intercourse with &lt;  
hostile markets, have persevered in a course j 1  
of measures which necessarily put at hazard j i  
the invaluable market of a great and growing  
country, disposed to cultivate the mutual ad­  
j vantages of an active commerce. (  
Other councils have prevailed. Our mo* *■  
deration and conciliation have had no other \
effect than to encourage perseverance, and to i  
enlarge pretentions. We behold our seafar- &#x27;  
ing citizens still the daily victims of lawless ]  
  
violence committed on the great common and  
highway of nations, even within sight of the  
country which&#x27; owes them protection: We  
behold our vessels, freighted with the pro­  
ducts of our soil and industry, or returning  
with the honest proceeds of them, wrested  
from their lawful destinations, confiscated by  
prize court! no longer the organs of public  
law, but the instruments of arbitrary edicts ;  
and their unfortunate crews dispersed and  
lost, or forced or inveigled in British ports  
into British fleets&#x27;: whilst arguments are em­  
ployed, in support of these aggressions, which  
have no foundation but in a principle equally  
supporting a claim to regulate our external  
commerce in all cases whatsoever.  
. We behold, in fine, on the side of Great  
Britain, a state of war against the United  
States; and on the side of the United  
Slates a state of peace towards Great  
Britain.  
Whether the United States shall continue  
passive under these progressive usurpations,  
and these accumulating wrongs ; or,{opposing  
three to force in defence of their natural l ights  
shall commit a just cause into the hands of  
the-.Almighty Disposer of events; avoiding  
all connections which might entangle it in the  
contests or views of other powers, and pre­  
serving a constant readiness to concur in ap  
honorable re-establishment of peace oc friend­  
ship, is a solemn question, which the consti­  
tution wisely confides to the Legislative De­  
partment Of the government. In recommend­  
ing it to their early deliberations, I arn happy  
in the assurance that the decision will be wor­  
thy the enlightened and patriotic councils of a  
virtuous, a free, and a powerful nation.  
Having presented this view of the relations  
of the United States wu.h Great Britain and  
of the solemn alternative growing out of them,  
1 proceed to remark that the communications  
iast made to Congress on the subject of our  
relations with France will have shown that,  
since the revocation yaf her decrees as they  
violated the neutral rights of the United  
  
states, ncr government has authorised illegal  
captures, by its privateers and public ships,  
and that other outrages have been practised  
on our vessels at id our citizens. It will have  
been seen also, mat no indemnity had been pro­  
vided, or satisfactorily pledged, for the exten­  
sive spoliations committed under the violent  
and retrospective orders of the French go­  
vern mem against the property of our citizens  
seized within the jurisdiction of France. I  
abstain at tins time from recommending to the  
consideration of Congress definitive mea­  
sures with respect to that nation, in the ex­  
pectation, that the result of unclosed discus­  
sions between our Minister Plenipotentiary at  
Paris and the French government will speedi­  
ly enable Congress to decide, with greater  
advantage, on the course due to the rights  
the interests, and the honor ot our country.  
JAMES MADISON.

Prodessions which ineulcated a belief that, having resorted to her  
ord-rs with regret, she was anxious to find an occasion for putting  
an« nd te them.  
  
, Abandoning still more ail respect for the neutral rights of the  
UVuited States, and for its own consistency, the British government  
v1oW demands, as pre quisites toa repeal of its orders as they ree  
Jat) to the United States, that @ formality should be observed in  
the repeal of the French decrees, nowise necessary to their termi-  
haon, por exesiplifi d by British usage; and that the Freich re-  
peal, besides including that portion of the decrees which operate  
within a territorial jurisdiction, a3 well as that whieh operates on  
the high seas seaiust the commerce of the United States, should  
not be a single special repeal in relation to the United States, but  
should be extended to whatever other neutral nations unconnected  
with them, may be aff cted by those decrees. And as an addition-  
2! insult, they are called on for a formal disavowal of conditions  
ainl pretensions advanced by the French government, for which  
tie United States are so far trom having made themselves respon-  
sible, that, in official explanations, which have beew published to  
the work!, and ina correspondence of the American minister at  
London with the British minister for foreign affairs, such a respon-  
sunlity Was explicitly and emphatically disclaimed.  
  
Ic has become, indeed, sufficiently certain that the ecommerce of  
  
th: United States is to be sacrificed, not as interfering with the bel-  
hgerent rights of Great Britain, not as supplying the wants of her  
enemies, which she herself supplies, but as interfering with the  
monopoly which she covets for her own commerce and navigation.  
She carries ona war against the lawful commerce of a friend, that  
she may the hetter carry on 2 commer? polluted by the forgeries  
and perjurics which are, for the most part, the only passports by  
which it can sucered,  
., Anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of in-  
jured nations, the United States have withheld from Great Britain,  
under successive modifications, the benefits of q free intercourse  
with their market, the loss of which could not’ but outweigh the  
profits accruing from her restrictions of our commerce with other  
nations. And to entitle these experiments to the more favorable  
consiieration, they were so framed as to enable her to place her  
adversary under the exclusive operation of them. To these ap-  
peals her government has been equally inflexible, as if willing to  
make sacrifices of every sort, rather than yield to the claims of jus-  
tice or renounce the errors of a false pride. Nay, so far were the  
attempts carried, to overcome the attachment of the British cabi-  
net to its unjust edicts, that it received every encouragement with-  
in the competency of the executive branch of our government, to  
expect that a repeal of them would be followed by a war between  
the United States and France, unless the French edicts should also  
be repealed. Even this communication, although silencing for-  
ever the plea of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in  
those edicts, originally the sole plea for them, received no at-  
tention,  
  
It no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British go-  
veriiment against a repeal of its orders, it might be found in the  
correspondence of the minister plenipotentiary of the United  
States at London, aud the British seeretary for foreign affairs, in  
1916, on the question wheth+r the bluckade of May 1806, was cons  
sidered as in force or as not inforee. It had been ascertained that  
the French government, which urged this- blockade as the ground  
of its Berlin decree, was witling,in the event of its removal, to re-  
peal thatdecree; which, being followed by alternate repeals of the  
other offensive edicts, might abolish the whole system on hoth  
sides. ‘Hhis inviting opportunity for accomplishing an object so  
important to the United States, and professed so often to be the  
desive of both the belligerents, was made known to the British go  
vernment. As that goverument admits that an aetual application  
  
fan advequate force, is necessary to the existenee of a legal blockade,  
andit Was notorjous,that ifsuch a forec had ever been applied,its long  
discontinuce bad annuiled the blockade in question, there could be  
no sufficient objection on the part of Great Britain to a formal  
revocation of it; and no imaginable objection, to a declaration of  
the fact, that the blockade did not exist. The declaration would  
have been consistent with her avowed principles of blockade, and  
wonld have enabled the United States to demand from France, the  
pledged repeal of her decrees; either with-success, in whicb case  
the wey would have been opened for a general repeal of the bel-  
fiverent edicts ; or without success. in which case the United States  
would bave been justified in turning their measures exclusively  
against France. ‘The British government would, however, neither  
rescind the blockade nor declare its non-existenec 3 nor permit its  
non-existence to be inferred and affirmed by the American pleni-  
potentiiry- On the contrary, by representing the blockade to be  
comprehended in the orders in council, the United States were  
com pelled so to regard itin their subs: quent proceedings.  
  
‘here wasa period when a favorable change in the policy of the  
British cabinet. was justly consid red as established. The minister  
pjenipotchtiar fof bis Britannic majesty here. proposed an adjust-  
met of the diffirene:s more immediately endangering the harmo-  
ny of the two countries. The pronosition wasaccepted with a promp-  
titude and cordiality corresponding with the invariable professions  
  
  
  
the belief, that the disavowal proceeded from a spicit of hostility to  
the commercial rights and prosperity of the United Ststes. And iz  
has since come into proof, that at the very moment, when the pub-  
lic minister was holding the language of friendship and inspiring  
confidence in the sincerity of the negociation with which he was  
charged, a secret agent of his government was «m ployed in intrigues,  
having for their isedémint of our government, and a dis-  
memberment of our happy union. ;  
  
In reviewing the conduct of Great Britain towards the United  
States our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare just renew-  
ed by the savages on one of our extensive frontiers ; wartare which  
is known to spare neither age or sex, and to be distinguished by  
features peculiarly shocking to humanity. It is difficult to account  
for the activity and combinations which have for some time been  
developing themseives among tribes in the constant intercourse with  
British traders and garrisons, without connecting their hostility  
with that influence ; and without recollecting the authenticated  
examples of such interpositions heretofore furnished by the officers  
ald agents of that government.  
  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and indignities  
which have been heaped on our country: and such  
the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and  
conciliatory efforts have not been able to avert. It  
might at least have been expected that an enlight-  
ened nation, if less urged by moral obligations, or  
invited by friendly dispositions on the part of the  
United States would have found, in its true interest  
alone, a sufficient motive to respect their rights and  
their tranquility on the high seas; that an enlarged  
policy would have favored that free &amp; general circula-  
tion of commerce, in which the British nation is at all  
times interested, and which in times of war is the  
vest alleviation of its calamities to herself as well as  
the other belligerents ; and more especially that the  
British cabinet would not, for the sake of the pre-  
carious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile  
markets, have persevered in a course of measures  
which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable mar-  
ket of a great and growing country, disposed to  
cultivate the mutual advantages of an active com-  
merce. s  
  
Other councils have prevailed. Our moderation  
and conciliation have had no other effect than to  
encourage perseverance, and to enlarge pretensions.  
We behold our seafaring citizens still the daily vic-  
tims of lawless violence committed on the great  
common and highway of nations, even within sight  
of the country which owes them protection. We  
  
ehold our vessels, freighted with the products of  
our soil and industry, or returning with the honest  
proceeds of them, wrested from their lawful desti-  
nations, confiscated by prize courts, no longer the  
  
organs of public law, but the instruments of arbi-  
  
irary edicts; and their unfortunate crews dispersed  
and lost, or forced or inveigled, in British ports,  
into British fleets: whilst arguments are employed  
in support of these aggressions, which have no  
foundations but in a principle equally supporting a  
claim to regulate our external commerce 1n all ca-  
ses whatsoever. ip  
  
We behold, in fine, on the side of Great Britain  
a state of war against the United States ; and on the  
side of the United States a state of peuce towards  
Great Britain.  
  
Whether the United States shall continue passive  
under these progressive usurpations, and these ac-  
cumulating wrongs; or opposing force to force in  
defence of their natural rights, shall commit a just  
  
cause into the hands of the Almighty Disposer of  
  
events, avoiding all connections which might en-  
tangle it in the contests or views of other powers,  
and preserving a constant readiness to concur 1D an  
honorable re-establishment of peace and friendship,

will have shown that since the revocation of her de-  
crees as they violated the neutral rights of the Uni-  
ted Siates, her government has authorized illegal  
captures, by its privateers and public ships, and  
that other outrages have been practised on our ves  
sels and our citizens. It will have been seen also,  
that no indemnity had been provided, or satisfactorily  
pledged for the extensive spoliations committed un-  
der the violent and retrospective orders of the French  
government against the property of our citizens  
seized within the jurisdiction of France. I abstain  
at this time from recommending to the considera-  
tion of congress definitive measures with respect to  
that nation, in the expectation that the result of un-  
closed discussions between our minister plenipoten-  
tiary at Paris and the French government will spee-  
dily enable congress to decide, with greater advan-  
tage, on the course due to the rights, the interests,  
and the honor of our country.

&gt; I communicate to Congress certain documents,  
being a continuation of thos&quot; heretofore Knit before  
V them, on the subject of our affairs mill Great Bri­  
tain. .vv v-v  
, Without going back beyond the renewal in 1803  
, of the war in which Great Britain IS engaged, and  
omitting unrepaired wrongs of inferior in ignuu le,  
&lt;tba conductor her government presents a series of  
• &#x27; acts hostile to the Uoitid States, as an indep-u­  
&#x27; dent and neutral natron. • i ^  
&#x27; British ciuisers base been in the continued prac­  
f-f &gt;)fice of violating the American Big on li.e great  
highway at nations,’ and of seiz&#x27;rtg and carrying  
• off persons sailing under it—not in the exercise id  
i« belligereni right, founded on the law ol nations  
&#x27; • tigamst an enemy, but of a&#x27;municipal prerogative  
• over British subjects. British jurisdiction is thus  
extended to neutral vessels ?n a situation where no  
laws can operate hut the law of nation* and the  
laws of the country to which the vessels belong—  
iV *nd a self-redress is assumed, which, if British  
.subjects were wrongfully detained end alone con­  
cerned, is that substitution of force for a resort to  
-the responsible sovereign, which falls within the  
definition of war. Could the seizure of Biitish  
subjects, in such cases, be regarded as within the  
exercise of /* belligerent right, the acknowledged&#x27;  
laws of War, which forbid an article ot eapiored  
t property to be adjudged, without a regular inves­  
tigation before a competent tribunal, would impe­  
riously demand the fairest trial where the sacred  
Tights ol persons Were at issue. In place of su-h  
a, trial, these rights are subjected to the will «f  
every petty rommrander.  
, The practice, hence, is so far from affecting Bri­  
tish subjects alone, that under the pretext of search­  
ing for tnery thousands of American citizens, tin­  
. der the saf*guard of public laW, and of their nati­  
onal fl ig, have been turn from -their couo&#x27;r/and  
from every tiling dear to them—have been dragged  
on bn»rd ships of war of a foreign nation; and ex-1  
pased under the severities ol their discipline, to be.  
&quot; exiled to the roost distant and deadly d.iues, to risk  
their lives in the battles of thur oppr&#x27; ssars, and  
&#x27; to be the melancholy instruments of taking away  
those &lt;&gt;f thsir own brethren. &#x27;

tain would he sn ploinpt to avettg? 11 commuted&#x27;

When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibit  
tlon of our trade with bet enemy, by the repeal of  
his prohibition of our trade with Gr^at Britain, her  
cabinet, instead of a corresponding repeal or&#x27; a  
practical discontinuance of iisorders, tormally «­  
vowed a determination to persist in them against  
the United States; until the markets of her enemy  
should be laid open to British products; thus as­  
serting an obligation On a neutral power to tequila  
one belligerent to encourage, by&#x27;its internal regula­  
tions, tlie trade of another belligerent ; contradict­  
ing ber own practice towards all nntions in peace,  
as well as in warj anil betraying the insincerity of  
those professions which &#x27;inculcated a Belief that,  
having resorted to her orders with regret, aEe was  
anxious lor finding an occasion ful putting an end to  
them. I-..&#x27;&#x27; i- . ‘■■Vv--&#x27; VT\&#x27;  
  
Abandoning still more ail respect for (be neutral  
rights of the United States, and for its own con­  
sistency, the British government now demands ns&#x27;  
prerequisites tu a repeal of its orders, as they re­  
late to the,United States, that a formality should  
be observed in the repeal of the French decrees no­  
■wise necessary to their termination, nor exempli­  
fied by British usage ; and that the J-Vencb repeal,*  
iits-d&#x27;S mctading that portion of the decrees which  
operate* within a territorial jurisdiction as well as  
that whirh ppeiates on the high seas against the  
commerce of the United States, should not be a  
single special repeal in relation to the United States,  
but should be extended to&#x27;whatever other neutral  
nations unconnected with them may be affected by  
those derrei s. - And as ah additional mselt, they  
are called on for a formal disavowal of conditions  
and pretensions advanced by the Frenrli govern­  
ment, for which the United States are to far from  
having made themselves responsible, that, in offi­  
cial explanations, which have been published to the  
world, and in a correspondence of the American  
minister at London with the British minister for  
foreign affairs, such a responsibility was explicitly  
and emphatically disclaimed.  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain that the  
commerce &lt;&gt;| toe United States is to be sacrificed,  
not as interfering with the belligerent rights of  
Great Britain, not as supplying the wants of her e­  
nemies,- which she herself supplies, but as inter­  
fering with the monopoly which she covets fur her  
own commerce and navigation. She carries on a  
war against the lawful commerce of a friend, that  
she may the better carry on a commerce with an  
enemy, a commerce polluted by the forgeries&#x27;and  
perjuries which are for ihy most part the only pass­  
ports by which it can succeed.  
Anxious to make every experiment short of the.  
last resort of injated nations, the United States  
nave withheld horn Great Britain, under succes­  
sive modifications, the benefits of a fiee intercourse  
with th ir market, the loss of w hich could not but  
outweigh the prufru accruing from her restrictions  
ol our commerce with other nations. And to en­  
title these experiments to the-more favourable con­  
sideration, they were so framed as to enable her to  
place her adversary under the exclusive operation  
&lt;•1 them. To these appeals her government has  
tieeu equally inflexible, as if willing to make sacri­  
fices of every sort, rather than yield to the claims  
»• justice, or (enounce the errors of a false pride.  
Niv, so far were the attempts’carried, to overcome  
u.c attachment of the British cabinet to its unjust  
edicts, that it received every encouragement, with­  
in Ipe competency of (be executive branch of oor  
government, to expert that a repeal of them would  
ne l.dlowed bf a war between the United States  
and France, unless the French edicts should also  
t&gt;e rip.sled. Kven this communication, although  
silencing forever the plea of a disposition in the  
United.States th acquiesce in those edicts, original­  
ly the sole plea for them, received no attention.  
If ft* oti ecpmof existed of a predetermination  
of ibe British government against a repeal of its  
ord.-r*, it might be found in the correspondence of  
u e minister plenipotentiary of the United State* at&#x27;  
London, and the British Secretary for foreign af­  
lairsin 1810, on the queatioo whether the blockade  
&lt;&gt;t Al iy, 1806, was considered as in force or e* Kot­  
in lor.*; It had been ascertained that the French  
government winch urged tbit blockade at the  
groued of its Berlin decree, was willing, in the •»&#x27;  
vmt ol us removal, to repeij that decree j which,  
being followed by alternate repeals of the other ©j­  
i tensive edicts, might abolish the whole eysteig on  
t both sides. I his inviting opportunity for arenra­  
| phishing an object «o important to the United States,  
! and pruiessed So oiten ii&gt; be the desire of both the  
j helligerante, Was made known to the British go­  
vernment. As that government admits that an ar­  
; ihhI application of an adequate force is necessary  
to the existence of a legal blockade, and it wits no­  
torious, that If such a force had ever been applied,  
tts long discontinuance had annulled the blockade  
| in question, theie mold be no Sufficient objection  
do the part of Grrat-Biitain to a formal revocation  
of it ; and no imaginable objection to a declarati  
on of the last that ibe blorkadedid not exist. The  
deClafatimv *ootd have been consistent with her a­  
  
i v«wed principles ot Mork.de, and would have ena­  
bl&#x27;d the United Stotes to demand from France the  
pledged icpeal other decrees; either with success,  
in which case the way would have been opened for  
&#x27;a gftnetai repeal nf tho belligerent e-Ji^ls; or with­

the sincerity of ilie negociation with which hews;  
charged, a sedreiagent of his government Was  
employed in intrigpes, having for their object a  
subversion of our government, and a dismember­  
ment ol oor happy Union.  
In revieuring tbe conduct of Great Britain toward  
the United States, our attention is necessarily drawn  
to the warfare just renewed by the savages, on one  
of opr extensive frontiers—a warfare which is,  
known to spare neither age nor sex, and to be dis­  
tinguished by features peculiarly shocking to hunia &#x27;  
j nity. ft is difficult to account lor the activity and  
[ combinations which have, for some time been deve­  
loping themselves among the tribes in ronst.nt  
intercourse with British traders and garrisons, with­  
out connecting their hostility with tout influence—  
| and without recollecting the authenticated exam­  
ple* of such interpoBilions beretofoie furnished by  
the officers and agents of that governrrvnt.  
  
oucn is tne spectacled injuries and in/lenities  
which have been heaped on our country—and buch ]  
the crisis which its ua-xamplcd forbearance and I  
conciliatory efforts have not been able to avert. It  
at least h:ive hern expected, that BQ &lt;nligl t­  
en d nation, if less urged by moral obligt turns, or  
invited by Iri-n ily dispositions &lt;n the part of the  
Umt»d Stab s, tvould have hunt t in its true inte­  
nt alone a sufficient m tivr t» respect their right*  
and their tramjuility on the high seas—that ,n  
enlarged policy , would have f.verCd that free and  
gene ral circulation of commerce, in which the Bri­  
tish p tion n at all timvs interested, and which in  
times ol war is the best alle viation of its calami *  
| tievtb bersel!, as well as to other belligerents—and  
| more especially that the British cabinet would a t  
for the sake of a precarious sod seirupli ions in­  
t&gt; rcourse with hostile markets, have persevered in  
a course ef measures which necessarily put at ha­  
zard tha invaluable market of a great and growing  
country, disposed to cultivate the mutual advanta­  
ges of an active commerce.  
Other councils have prevailed. Our moderation  
and conciliation have had no other effect than to en­  
courage perseverance, and to enlarge pretensions.’  
We behold our seafaring citiaens still the dally , vic­  
tims of lawless violence committed on the creat com­  
mon and highway of nations, even within sight of  
the country which owes them protection. Wt be­  
hold our vessels, freighted with the produrts of our  
soil and industry, or returning with the honest pro­  
ceeds of them, wrested from their lawful dest/na­  
| lions, confiscated by prize courts no longer the or­  
gans of public law, but the instruments of arbitra  
ry edicts; and their unfortunate crews dispersed  
aud iost, or forced or loveigled in British ports in­  
to British fleets; whilst arguments are employed,  
in support ol these aggressions, which have no  
foundation but tn^a pitnriple equally supporting a  
claim to regulate our external commerce in all ca­  
ses whatsoever. • . &#x27; : ; *  
We bebold, in fine, on the side of Great Britain,  
a state Of war against the United States; and on  
the side of the United Statea a atale of peare to  
wards Great Britain.  
Whether the United States shall continue passive  
under thele progressive usurpations, and these ac­  
cumulating wrongs ; or, opposing, force to force  
in defence of their natural rights shaH commit a  
just CAUse-into the hands of the Almighty Disposer  
of events ; avoiding all connections which might  
entangle it iu fhe contests or views of Other  
powers, and preserving a constant readiness to  
ronrur in an honorable re-establishment of peace  
nod friendship, is a solemn question, which the  
constitution wisely confides to the legislative depai t­  
ment at the government. In reCommeuding it to  
[ their early deliberations, t am happy in the assur­  
ance that the decision will be worthy the rnligh*.  
tebed efed patriotic Councils of a virttfhus, a free,  
and a powerful nation. ,■...  
Having presented this view of th« relations o*1  
I the Uuited States with Great Britain and of the so­  
t I«r»n alternative growing out of them, I proceed  
Utremark that the communications last made to  
Congress on the subject of our relations with  
France will have shown that, since the revocation&#x27;  
: of her decrees as they violated the neutral rights of

UNITED STATES.  
I communicate to Congress certain do­  
cuments, being a continuation of those here­  
tofore laid before them, on the subject of  
our affairs with Great Britain.  
Without going back beyond the renewal  
in 1803, of the war in which Great Britain  
is engaged, and omitting unrepaired wrongs  
of inferior magnitude, the conduct of her  
government presents a series of acts hostile  
to the United States as an independent and  
neutral nation.  
  
man cruiscis nave uccn in vnc continued  
practice of violating the American flagon  
the great high way of nations, and of seizing  
and carrying off persons sailing under it ;  
not in the exercise of a belligerent right  
founded on the law of nations against ati e­  
nemy, but of a municipal prerogative over  
British subjects. British jurisdiction is  
thus extended to neutral vessels in a situati­  
on where no laws can operate but the law  
of nations and the laws of the country to  
which the vessels belong; and a self-redress  
is assumed which, if British subjects were  
wrongfully detained and alone concerned,  
is that substitution of force, for a resort to  
the responsible sovereign, which falls within  
the definition of war. Could the seizure of  
British subjects in such cases be rcgnrdcd  
as within the exercise of a belligerent right,  
the acknowledged laws of war, which forbid  
an article of captured property to b&lt;; ad­  
judged without a regular investigation before  
a competent tribunal, would imperiously de­  
mand the fairest trial where the sacred rights  
of |&gt;ersons were at issue. In place of such a  
trial, these rights are subjected to the will  
of every petty commander.  
The practice, hence, is so far from affect­  
ing British subjects alone, that, under the  
pretext of searching for these, thousands ef  
American citizens, under the safeguard of  
public law, and of their national fag, have  
beet) torn from their cduntiy apd f/sui, ere­  
  
ry tlung dear to them; have been (f&#x27;igged  
on Ik ;i’ tl mi|ii oi war o{ a foreign nation,  
and exposed, under the severities of their  
discipline, to be exiled to the most distant  
and deadly climes to risk their lives in the  
I battles of their oppressors, and to bo the  
melancholy instruments of taking away  
those of tueirown brethren.  
Against this crying enormity, which G  
Britain would be so prompt to avenge if  
committed against herself, the United States  
have in vain exhausted remonstrances and  
c*p &#x27;S:u&#x27;(t|nni. Ami that no proof might be  
an* in* of inc-. t&#x27;conciliatory dispositions, and  
no peer vt left lor a continuance nftheprac­  
dec, the British government was formally  
• usvred • f t lie readiness cf the U. States to  
I v n ;• i,to arrangements, such as could not  
j lie rejected, li the recovery of British sub­  
• ji jis were ihe real and the sole object. The  
commmneation passed without effect.  
Br.t&#x27;sh era zers have been in &#x27;he practice  
I also cf violating die rights and the peace of  
our coasts. They hover over and hurras*  
our entering and departing commerce. To  
.lie most insulting pretensions they have ad­  
ded the mos. lawless proceedings in our ve­  
ry harbors; and have wantonly spilt Ame­  
rican oloou within the sanctuary of onr ter­  
ritorial jurisdiction. The principles and  
rules enforced by that nation, when a neu­  
tral nation, against armed vessels of belligc  
rents hovering near her coasts, and distm ly­  
ing her commerce, are veil known. When  
ruling nt, _ k. _  
  
to punish the greater offences committed by  
her own vessels, her government, has bes­  
towed on their commanders additional marks  
of honor and confidence.  
Under pretended blockades, Without the  
presence of an adequate force, and some­  
times without the practicability of applying  
one, our commerce has been plundered in  
ovtry sea ; the great staples • f our country  
have been cut off from their legitimate mar­  
kets ; and a destructive blow aimed at our  
agricultural and maritime interests. In ag­  
gravation of these predatory measures, they  
have been considered as in force from the  
dates of their notification ; a retrospective  
effect being thus added, as has been done in  
other important cases, to the unlawfulness ot  
the course pursued. And to render the out­  
rage the more signal, these mock-blockades  
have been reiterated and enforced in the face  
of official communications from the British  
government, declaring, as the true definiti­  
on of a legal blockade “ that particular  
ports must be actually invested, anil previ­  
ous warning given to vessels bound to them,  
not to enter.’*  
Not content with these occasional expedi­  
ents ior laying waste our neutral trade, the  
Cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at length  
to the sweeping system of blockade!, under  
the name of Orders in Council, which has  
been m added and managed, as might best  
suit its political views, its commercial jea­  
lousies, or the avidit\ ot British cruisers.  
To&#x27;oir remans*ranees &#x27;.gainst the compli­  
cated and transcendant njusiice of this inno  
vati- n. the first reply was ’.hat the orders  
were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain as  
a necessary retaliation on decrecsof lierc­  
nemy proclaimi ng a general blockade of the  
British isles, at a time when the naval force  
ot that enemy dared not to issue from his  
&lt;&gt;wn ports. She was reminded, without ef  
feet, that her own prior blockades, unsup­  
ported &gt; y an adequate naval force actually  
applied m-l continued, weie a bar to this  
plea: that exeetded edicts against millions  
of our pr perty could not he retaliation on  
edicts, confessedly impossible to be execut­  
ed : that retaliation, to be just, should fall  
  
on me party semng me guilty example, noi  
on an inn- cent party, which was not even  
chargeable with an acquiescence in it.  
When deprived ot&#x27; this flimsy veil for a  
prohibition of our trade with her enemy, by  
the repeal of his prohibition of cur trade  
with Great Britain, her cabinet, instead of  
a corresponding repeal or a practical discon­  
tinuance of its orders, formally avowed a  
determination to persist ip them against the  
United States, until the markets of her ene­  
my shculdhe laid open to British products;  
thus asserting an obligation on a neutral  
power to require one belligerent to encou­  
rage, by its internal regulations, the trade  
of another belligerent; contradicting her  
own practice towards all nations in peace as  
well as in tvar ; and betraying the insince­  
rity of those professions which inculcated a  
belief that, having resorted to her orders  
with regret, she was anxious to tind an oc­  
casion for putting an end to tham.  
Abandoning still more all respect for the  
neutral rights of the Uni*ed States, and for  
its own consistency, the British government  
now demands as prerequisites to a repeal of  
its orders, as they relate to the U. States,  
that a formality ^houkl he observed in the  
repeal of the French decrees nowise neces­  
sary to their termination, nor exemplified  
by British usage ; and that the French rer  
peal, besides including that portion of the  
decrees which operates within a territorial  
jurisdiction as well as that which operates  
on the high seas against the commerce of  
the United States, should not be a single spe­  
cial repeal in relation to the United States,  
but should be extended to whatever ether  
neutral nations unconnected with them may  
be affected by those decrees; And as an  
additional insult, they are Called on f-»r a  
f__ i a:-* ___ i ~c _i__i -_  
  
sinns advanced by the French government,  
for which the United States arc so far from  
having made themseLyes responsible, that,  
in official explanations, which have been  
published to the world, and in a correspon­  
dence of the American Minister at London  
with the British Minister for Foreign Af  
fairs, such a responsibility was explicitly  
and emphatically disclaimed.  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain  
that the commerce of the United States is to  
be sacrificed, not as interfering with the bel­  
ligerent rights of Great Britain, not as sup­  
plying the wants of her enemies, which she  
herself supplies ; but as interfering with the  
monopoly which she covets for her own  
commerce and navigation. She carries on  
a war against the lawful commerce of a  
friend, that she may the better carry c.n a  
commerce with an enemy, a commerce  
polluted by the forgeries and perjuries which  
ate for the most part the only passports by  
which it can succeed.  
Anxious to make every experiment short  
of the last resort of injurad nations, the U­  
nited States have withheld fr&lt;»m Great Bri­  
tain, under successive modifications, the be­  
nefit.. of a f**cc intercourse with their mar­  
ket, the loss of which could not but outweigh  
&#x27;.he profits accruing from her restrictions of  
rnr commerce with other nation!*. And to  
crAUle these &#x27;experimentloth&#x27;.- rrvtfTQClVov­  
  
able cortsMeralftn, they* ah framed a|  
to enable her to pl ace her adversary under  
.he exclusive operation of them. To these  
appeals her government has been equally  
indexible, as if willing to make sacrifice* of*  
every sort, rather than yield to the claims of  
justice or renounce the errors of a false pride.  
Nay, so far were the attempts carried, too-*  
vercome the attach men t of the British Cabi­  
net to its unjust edicts, that it received eve­  
ry encouragement, within rtie competency  
of the Executive branch of our government,  
to expect that a repeal of them would In­  
followed by a war between the United States  
and France, unless the French edicts should  
also lie repealed. Even this communication, ,  
although silencing for ever the plea of a dis^  
position in the United Slates to acquiesce itr  
those edicts, originally the sole plea tor them,  
received no attention.  
If no other proof existed of a predetermi­  
nation of the British government against a.  
repeal of its orders, it might be found in the  
correspondence of the Minister Plenipotenti­  
ary of the United States at London, and the  
British Secretary for Foreign Affairs in 1810,  
on the question whether the blockade of  
May 1806, was considered as in force or as  
not in force. It had been ascertained that  
the French government, which urged this  
blockade as the ground of its Berlin decree,&#x27;  
was willing, in the event of its removal, to  
repeal that decree; which, being followed by  
alternate repeals of the otheroffensive edicts  
  
luigub uuousuine wnoie system on both sides,­  
rius inviting opportunity for accomplishing  
ail object so important to the United States^  
and professed so often to be tbe desire of  
!*&gt;th llie belligerents, was made known to  
the British government. As that govern­  
ment admits that an actual application of an  
adequate force is necessary to the existence  
of a legal blockade, Hnd it was notorious,  
that it such a fovee had ever been applied*  
its long discontinuance had annulled tin;  
blockade in question, there could be no suf­  
ficient objection on the part of Great Britain  
to a formal revocation of it; and noimagin-.  
able objection to a declaration of the fact  
that the blockade did not exist. The decla­  
ration would have been consistent with her­  
avowed principles of blockade, and would  
have enabled the United States to demand  
from France the pledged repeal of her de­  
crees; either with success, in which case,  
the way would have been opened for a gene­  
ral repeal of the belligerent edicts ; or with­  
out success, in which case the United States  
would have be; n justified in turning their  
measures exclusively against France. The  
British government wuuld, however, neither­  
rescind the blockade nor declare its non-ex-,  
istencc ; nor permit its non-existence to bn  
inferred and affirmed by the American Ple­  
nipotentiary. On the contrary, by repre-,  
senting the blockade to be comprehended in.*  
the orders in council, the U. States were  
compelled so to regard it in their subsequent,  
proceedings. 7  
There was a period when a favorable,  
change in the policy of the British cabinet,  
was justly considered us established. The.  
Minuter Plenipotentiary of His Britannic  
Majesty here proposed an adjustment ot the.  
differences more immediately endangering  
the harmony ofthe two countries. The pro?  
position was accepted with a promptitude  
and cordiality corresponding with the inva­  
riable professions (it this government. A,  
foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere,  
and lasting reconciliation. The prospect,  
however, quickly vanished. The whole proef  
reeding vvas disavowed by the British go­  
vernment without any explanations wb.ch.  
could at that time repress the belief, that,  
the disavowal proceeded from a snirit i.f luvaZf  
  
tiiity to the conmierci.il rights and proper­  
ty of the United States. And it i.as since,  
come into proof, that a the ei y moment*  
when the public Minister was holding the*  
language of friendship and inspiring confi­  
dence in the sincerity of ihe negotiation w itfa.  
which he w is charged, a secret agent of his.  
government was employed in intrigues, hav-*  
ing for their object a subversion of our go­  
vernment, and a dismemberment of our hap-/  
py U nion.  
In leviewingthe conduct of Great Britain  
towards the United States our attention is.  
necessarily drawn to the warfare just re­  
newed by the savages on one of our extensive,  
frontiers; a warfare which is known to spar©  
neither age nor sex, and to be distinguished  
by features peculiarly shocking to humanity.  
It is difficult to account for the activity and  
combinations which hive for some time been  
developing themselves among tribes in th©  
constant intercourse with British traders &amp;r  
garrisons, without connecting their hostility­  
with that influence; and without recollect*,  
ing the authenticated examples of such inter­  
positions heretofore furnished by theofficcrv  
and agents of that government.  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and in­  
dignities which have been heaped on our  
country : and such the crisis which its un­  
exampled forbearance and conciliatory ef­  
forts have not been able to averr. It mighr  
at least have been exjiectcd, that an Culighti*  
ened nation iflcss urged by moral obligati­  
ons, or invited by friendly dispositions on  
the part of the United States, would have­  
found, in its true interest alone, a sufficient  
motive to respect their rights and their rran-*  
quility on the high seas ; that an enlarged.

British nation is at all times interested, and  
which, in times of war, is the best allevia­  
tion of its calamities to herself, *u&gt; well a«  
the other belligerents; and more especially,  
that the British Cabinet would not, for the  
sake of a precarious and surreptitious jn^  
tcrcoursc with hostile markets, have perse­  
vdred in a course of measures, which ne­  
cessarily put at hazard the invaluable mar­  
ket of a great and growing country, disposed  
to cultivate the mutual advantages of an ac­  
tive commerce.  
Other councils have prevailed. Our mo­  
deration and conciliation have had no other  
effect than to encourage perseverance, and  
to enlarge pretensions. We behold our sea­  
faring citizens still the daily victims of law­  
less violence committed on tho great com*­  
mon, and highway of nations, e\ei* within  
sight of the country which owes them pro*  
teepon. We behold our vessels, freighted

them, wrested from their lawful destinati­

p&#x27;rfrting a claittf ta rt^tdate ohr cxlerhal  
commerce in all cases whatsoever.  
We behold, in tine, on the side of Great  
Britain, a state of war against tile United  
Siates; and on the side of the United States,  
n state of peace towards G. Britain.  
Whether the United States shall conti­  
nue passive under these progressive usur­  
pations, and theseaccumulatiug wrongs ; or,  
opposing force to force in defence of their  
natural rights, shall commit a just cause in­  
to the hands ot the Almighty Disposer of  
events, avoiding all connexions which might  
entangle it in the contests or views of other  
powers, and preserving a constant readi­  
t ness to concur in an honorable re-establish­  
ment of peace and friendship, is a solemn  
question, which the Constitution wisely con  
tides to the Legislative Department of the  
government. In recommending it to their  
early deliberations, I am happy in the as­  
surance, that the decision will be worthy the  
enlightened and patriotic councils of a vir­  
tuous, a free and a powerful nation.  
Having presented this view of the relati­  
ons of the United States with Great Bri­  
tain, and of the solemn alternative growing  
out of ilium, 1 proceed to remark, that the  
communications last made to Congress, on  
the rubject of our relations with France,  
will have shown, that since the revocation  
of her decrees, as they violated the neutral  
rights ot the United States, her government  
has authorised illegal captures, by its priva­  
teers and public ships, and that other out­  
rages have been practised on ouf vessels  
and our citizens. It will have been sfcen nl­  
sp, that no indemnity had been provided, or  
satisfactorily pledged fur the exteusive spu­  
(i Uions committed under the violent anti re­  
trospective orders of the French govern­  
ment against the property of our citizens.  
  
auidcu wiuuij uiu juriMiiuimu 01 nance, l  
abstain at this time from recommending to  
the consideration of Congress definitive men­  
wires with respect to that nation, in tlie ex­  
pectation, that the result of unclosed discu*­  
tions between our Minister Plenipotentiary  
ut Paris and tlie French government, will  
speedily enable Congress to decide, with  
greater advantage, on the coursedue to the  
rights, the interests and %thc honor of our  
Country.

 for ah adjournment in a few days.  
The Deck ration of War has been recei­  
ved with exultation by all those among us  
who love &amp; understand the interest of their  
country.—It w as ushered in with a Federal  
Salute both in the Morning and in the liven­  
ing.  
* Port Maiden is nearly ofifiositt to De­  
troit—on the other side the Strait which  
onnecta Luke St. Cluir with J.ake Krie,  
Washington, June 18, 1812.  
The injunct ioiKot sceiecy was about an  
hour ago remoVen from the following Mes­  
sage, Report ot* Manifesto, and Act.  
JYat. Int.  
  
To the Senate urul House of Representa­  
tives of the United States.  
I communicate to Congress certain docu­  
ments, being a continuation of those hereto­  
fore laid betore them, on the subject of our  
affairs with Great-Britain.  
Without going back, beyond the renewal  
in 1803 of the war in which G. B. is engag  
cd, and omitting unrepaired wrongs of infe­  
rior magnitude, the conduct of her govern­  
ment presents a series of acts hostile to  
the U. S. as an independent and neutral na­  
tion.  
British cruisers have Oeen in the contin­  
ued practice of violating the American Hug  
on the great high way of nations, and of sei­  
zing and carrying off persons sailing under  
it ; not in the exercise of a belligerent right  
founded on the law of nations against an  
enemy, but ot a municipal prerogative over  
British subjects. British jurisdiction is thus  
extended to neutral vessels u a situation  
where no laws can operate but the law of na­  
tions &amp; the laws i lie country to which the cos­  
sets belong ;£5c.i self-redress is assumed which  
if British subjects were wrongfully detained  
and alone concerned, is that substitution of  
force, tor a resort to the responsible sovereign,  
which falls within the definition of war ——  
Could the seizure of British subjects in  
such cases be regarded as within the  
i xercise of a be. 1 gerent right, the acknowl­  
edged laws of war, which forbid an arti­  
cle of captured property to be adjudged  
without a regular investigation before a  
competent tribunal, would imperiously de­  
mand the fairest trial where the sacred  
. iglits of persons were at issue : In place of  
such a trial, these rights are subjected to  
the wdl of every petty commander.  
I he practice, hence, is so far from affect­  
ing British subjects alone, that, under the  
pretext of searching for these, thousands of  
American citizens, under the safeguard of  
public law, and of their national llag have  
been torn from their country and from eve­  
ry thing dear to them ; have been dragged  
on board ships af war of a foreign nation, &amp;  
exposed, under the severitiesof their discip­  
line, to be exiled to the most distant and  
deadly climes, to risk their lives in the bat­  
tles (.I their oppressors, and to be the me­  
lancholy instruments of taking away those  
of their own brethren.  
Against this crying enormity, which Great  
Britain would be so prompt to avenge if com­  
mitted against herself, the LJ. S. have in  
vain exhausted remonstrances and expos­  
tulations And that no proof might be wan­  
ting of their conciliatory dispositions, and  
no pretext left for a continuance of the prac­  
tice, the British government was formally  
assured of the readiness of the U. S. to en -  
ter into arrangements, such as could not be  
rejected, if the recovery of British sub­  
jects were the real and the sole objec t.—  
The communication passed without effect.  
British cruizers have been in the prac­  
tice also of violating the rights Sc the peace  
  
oii.isis. x uey nover over aiul narrass  
out* entering and departing Commerce. To  
th“ most insulting pretensions they have  
added the most lawless proceedings in our  
very harbors ; and have wantonly spil ed A­  
nierican blood within the sanctuary of our  
territorial jurisdiction. The principles and  
rules enforced by that nation, when a neu­  
tral nation, against armed vessels of bellige­  
rents hovering near her coasts, and distur­  
bing her commerce, are.well known. When  
called on, nevertheless, by the U. States to  
punish the greater offences committed by  
her own vessels, her government has lie­  
stowed on their commanders additional  
m *rks of honor and confidence.  
Under pretended blockades, without the  
presence of an adequate force, and some­  
times without tlie practicability of applying  
one, our commerce has been plundered in  
esery sea ; the great staples of cair country  
have been cut of) from their legitimate mar­  
kets; and a destructive blow aimed at our  
Agricultural and maritime interests. In ag­  
gravation of fhe*c predatory measures, they  
have been considered as ir. force from the  
..ates of their notification ; a rcstrospec­  
ive effect being thus added, r.» Has been  
hwn-in other important cases, to the unlaw-’  
fulness of the course pursued, Andtorcn-’  
ler this outrage the more signal, these innek  
blockades have ueen reiterated and enforced  
  
in the face t.f official contmm.if ct&#x27;cm frc*n !  
the British government, deviating, as the &#x27;  
true definition uf a le gal Blockade &quot; mat par­  
ticular ports must lie actually invested, and ;  
previous warning given to \esstls bound, to !  
them, not to enter.”  
Not content with these occasional expo- .  
dients for laying waste our neutral trade, i  
the Cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at  
length, to the sweeping system of blockades,  
under the name of Orders iu Council, which  
has been moulded &#x27;and managed, as might i  
lust suit its political views, its commercial  
jealousies, or the avidity of British cruisers.  
To our remonstrancei against the compli­  
cated and transcendant injustice of this in­  
novation. the first reply was that the orders  
were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain}  
as a necessary retaliation on decreed of her j  
enemy proclaiming a general blockade of i  
the British isles, at a time when the naval  
force of that enemy dared not to issue from  
his own ports. She was reminded, with­  
out effect, that her own prior blockades, un­  
supported by an adequate naval force actu­  
ally applied and continued, were a bar to  
this pica : that executed edicts against mil­  
lions of bur property could n&lt;*i he retaliation  
on edicts, confessedly impossible to be exe­  
cuted : that retaliation, to be just, should  
fall on the party setting the guilty example,  
not on an innocent pat ty, which was not e­  
  
ven chargeable with an acquiescence in it.  
When deprived of this flimsy \i il for a  
prohibition of our trade with her enemy, by  
the repeal of his prohibition of our trade  
with Great Britain, her cabinet, instead of  
a corresponding repeal or a practical dis­  
continuance of its orders, formally avowed a  
determination to persist in them against the  
U. S., until the markets of her enemy should  
be laid open to British products ; thus assert •  
ing an obligation on a neutral power to re­  
quire one belligerent to encourage, by its  
internal regulations, the trade* of ano­  
ther belligerent ; contradicting her own  
practice towards all nations in peace as  
well as in war ; and betraying the insin­  
cerity of those professions which inculcated  
a belief that having resorted to her orders  
with regret, she was anxious to find an oc­  
casion for putting an end to them.  
Abandoning still more all respect for the  
neutral rights of the United States, and for  
its own consistency, the British government  
now demands as prerequisites to a repeal  
of its orders, as they relate to the United  
States, that informality should he observed  
in the lepeal of the French decrees no wise  
necessary to their termination, nor exempli­  
fied by British usage ; and that the French  
repeal besides including that portion of the  
decrees which operates within a territorial  
jurisdiction as well as that which operates  
on the high seas against the commerce of  
the United States, should not be a single  
special repeal in relation to the U. States,  
hut should be extended to whatever other  
neutral nations unconnected with them may  
he affected by those decrees. And as an  
additional insult, they are called on for a  
formal disavowal of conditions and preten­  
sions advanced by the French government,  
for which the United States arc so far from  
having made themselves responsible, that,  
in official explanations, which have been  
published to the world, and in a correspon­  
dence of the American minister at London  
with the British Minister for Foreign Affairs,  
such a responsibility was explicitly and em­  
phatically disclaimed.  
  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain  
that the commerce nf the United States is  
to be sacrificed, not as interfering with the  
belligerent rights of Great Britain, not as  
supplying the wants of her enemies, which  
&#x27; she herself supplies ; but as interfering with  
&#x27; the monopoly which she covets for her own  
commerce and navigation. She carries on  
. a war against the lawful commerce of a  
friend, that she may the better carry on a  
commerce with an enemy, a commerce pol­  
luted by the forgeries and perjuries which  
are for the most part the only passports by  
w hich it can succeed;  
Anxious to make every experiment short  
! of the last resort of injured nations, the Uni­  
ted States ha&gt;’e withheld from Great Bri­  
tain muter snrn&#x27;Ssive modifications, the be­  
nefits of a free intefcourse with tUeir mar­  
ket, the loss ©f which co &#x27;1^ rm*’ but outweigh  
the profits accruing from ^er restrictions of  
our commerce with other nat*008&#x27; t0  
entitle these experiments to the *nore favor­  
able consideration, they were so as  
to enable her to place her adversary v&#x27;hder  
the exclusive operation of them. To  
appeals her government lias been equally  
indexible, as if willing to make sacrifices of  
every sort, rather than yield to the claims  
■ of justice &lt; r renounce the errrors of a false  
pride. Nay, so far were the attempts car­  
ried to overcome the attachment of the Bri­  
tish Cabinet to its unjust edicts, that it re­  
ceived every encouragement, within the  
competency of the Executive branch of our  
government, to expect that a repeal of them  
would be followed by a war between the U­  
nited States and France, unless the French  
edicts should also be repealed. Even this  
communication, although silencing for ever  
the plea of a disposition in the United States  
to acquiesce in those edicts, originally the  
sole pica for them, received wo attention.  
If no other proof existed of a predeter­  
mination of the British government against  
ja repeal of its orders, it might be found in  
the correspondence of the Minister Plenipo­  
tentiary of the United States at London, and J  
the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs  
in 1810, on the question w nether the block- I  
ade of May 1806 was considered as in force  
or as not in force. It had been ascertained  
that the French government, which urged  
this blockade as the ground ©fits Berlin de­  
cree, was willing, in the event of its remo­  
val, to repeal that decree ; which being fol­  
lowed by alternate repeals of the other of­  
  
tensive edicts, might abolish the whole sys­  
tem on both sides. This inviting opportuni­  
ty for accomplishing an object so important  
to the United States, and professed so often  
to be the desire of both the belligerents, was  
made known to the British government_  
As that government admits that an actu­  
al application of an adequate force is ne­  
cessary to the existence of a legal block­  
ade, and it was notorious, that if such n  
force had ever been applied, its long discon­  
tinuance had annulled the blockade in ques­  
tion. there could be no sufficient objection  
on the part of (ireat Britain to a formai re­  
vocation of it ; and no imaginable objection  
to a declaration of the fact that the block­  
ade did not exist. The declaration would  
have been consistent with her avowed prin­  
ciples of blockade, and would have enabled  
the United States to demand fromJTFrancc  
the pledged repeal of her decrees ; eithei  
with success, in which c;.sc the way would  
have been opened for a general repeal of tin  
belligerent edicts ; or without success, it  
which case the United States would havr  
been justified in turning tiu-ir measures ex  
clusively against France. The British go  
vernment would, however, neither rescim  
tiie blockade nor declare its non-existence ;  
  
ior permit its non-existence to be inferred i  
md affirmed by the American Pleuipoien- ;  
Liary. On the contrary by representing the ;  
blockade to be comprehended in the orders  
in council, the United States wete compel­  
led so to regard it in their subsequent pro­  
ceedings.  
There was a period when a favorable  
change in the policy of the British cabinet  
was justly considered as established. The  
Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic  
Majesty here proposed an adjustment of the  
differences more immediately endangering  
the harmony of the two countries. The pro­  
position was accepted with a promptitude  
and cordiality corresponding with the inva­  
riable professions of this government. A  
foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere  
and lasting reconciliation. The prospect,  
however, quickly vanished. The whole pro­  
ceeding was disavowed bv the British go­  
vernment without any explanation which  
could at thit time repress the belief, that  
Hie disavowal proceeded from a spirit of  
hostility to the commercial rights and pros­  
perity of the United States. And it has  
since cdinc into proof, that at the very mo­  
ment when the public Minister was holding  
the language of friendship, and inspiring  
confidence in the sincerity of the negociatlon  
with which life was charged, a secret agent  
of his government was employed in intrigues,  
having for their object a subversion of our  
government, and a dismemberment of our  
happy Uni&lt; n.  
  
In reviewing the conduct of Great Hritain  
towards the United States, our attention is  
necessarily drawn to the warfare just renew­  
ed by the savages on one of our extensive  
frontiers; a warfare which is known to  
spare neither age nor sex, and to be distin­  
guished by features peculiarly shocking U  
humanity. It is difficult to account for  
the activity and combinations which have  
for some time been developing themselves  
among the tribes in constant intercourse with  
British traders and garrisons, without con­  
necting their hostility with that influence ;  
and without recollecting the authenticated  
examples of such interpositions heretofore  
furnished by the officers and agents of that  
government.  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and indig­  
nities which have been heaped on our conn  
try ; and such the crisis which its unexam­  
pled forbearance and conciliatory efforts  
have not been able to avert. It might at  
least have been expected, that ah enlight  
| ened nation, if less urged by moral obligati­  
ons, or invited by friendly dispositions on the  
part of the U. States, would have found in  
its true interest alone a sufficient motive to  
respect their rights and their tranquility on  
the high seas ; that an enlarged policj |  
would have favored that free and general  
circulation of commerce, in which the Bri­  
tish nation is at all times interested, and  
which in time of war is the best alleviation  
of its calamities to herself&quot;, as well as to the o­  
ther belligerents ; and more especially that  
the British Cabinet would not, for the sake  
of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse  
with hostile markets, have persevered in a  
course of measures wiiich necessarily put at  
hazard the invaluable market of a great and  
growing country,disposed to cultivate the mu­  
tual advantages of an active commerce.  
Other councils have prevailed. Our mo­  
deration and conciliation have had no other  
effect than to encourage perseverance, and  
  
to enlarge pretensions. We behold our  
seafaring citizens still the daily victims of  
lawless violence committed on the great  
common and highway of nations, even with­  
in sight ©f the country which owes them  
protection. We behold our vessels, freight­  
ed with the products of our soil and industry,  
or returning with the honest proceeds of  
them,wrested from their lawful destinations,  
confiscated by prize courts, no longer ilie.  
organs of public law, but the instruments of  
arbitrary edicts ; and their unfort unate  
crews dispersed and lost, or forced or in­  
veigled in British ports into British fleets ;  
whilst arguments are employed,-in support  
of these aggressions, which have no founda­  
tion but Iti a principle equally supporting a  
claim to regulate our external commerce in  
all cases whatsoever.  
We behold, in tine, on the side of Great  
Britain, a state of war against the United  
States ; and on the side of the United States  
a state of peace towards G. B.  
Whether the United States shall Continue  
passive under these progressive usurpations,  
and these accumulating wrongs : or.oppos  
ing force to force in defence ot their natu­  
ral rights, shall commit a just cause into tin.­  
nds of the Almighty Disposer of events ;  
avcioVn6 all connections which might entan­  
gle itiri contests or Views of other pow­  
ers and ni&#x27;fc-sei v*nS a constant readiness to  
concur in an honorable re-establishment of  
peace and frieiu&gt;’-is a s,olcm» question,  
which the constiti. w*sely confides to the  
Legislative Department of the government.  
In recommending it to tiVc* * car ) de libera­  
tions, I am happy in the assurance tuat the  
decision will be worthy the ei.&#x27;lightened and  
patriotic councils of a virtuous, A i.&#x27;te, and  
powerful nation.  
Having presented this view of the relati­  
ons of the United States with G. Brita,n  
and of the solemn alternative grown’g. out  
of them, I proceed to remark that the coi.1&#x27;*  
inunications last made to Congiesson the  
subject of our relations with France will  
have shewn that, since the revocation of  
I her decress p.s they violated the neutral  
rights of the United States&#x27;, her government  
has authorised illegal captures by its pri  
vateers and public ships, and that other  
outrages have been practised on our ves­  
sels ami our citizens. It will have been  
seen also, that no idemnily had been provi­  
ded, or satisfactorily pledged, for the exten­  
sive spoliations committed under the vio­  
lent and retrospective orders of the French  
government against the property of our ci­  
tizens seized within the jurisdiction of  
France.  
  
I abstain at this tunc from recommending  
to the consideration of Congress definitive  
measures with respect to that nation, in the  
expectation, that the result of unclosed dis­  
cussions between our Minister Plenipotenti­  
ary at Paris and the French government will  
speedily enable Congress to decide, with  
greater advantage, on the course due to the  
rights, the interests, and the honor of our  
country.

The injunction of secrecy was  
about an hour ago removed from the  
following Message, Report or Ma  
nlfetto and Act-  
?o tii Senate urJ H.ute of Fepresrnt&amp;tixet cf  
toe Untied State  
I communicate to Congress certain  
documents, beins 3 continuation .of  
those heretofore laid before them, on  
the subject of our affiirs with Great­  
Britain.Without going back beyond the  
renewal in 1803 of the war in which  
G. B. is engaged, and omitting un  
repaired wrongs of ; inferior magni­  
tude, the conduct. of her government  
presents a scries of acts hostile to the  
(J. States as an independent and neu­  
tral nation.

xruisn cruisers na&#x27; c ocen in tnovi  
ontinued oractice of violating the  
American flag on the great highway  
of j nations, and&quot; of seizing and -car  
tying oGTpersons sailing under it not  
in the rxerise of a belligcfent right  
loundeq on the law ot nations against  
an enemy, but of a municipal prero  
gative over British subjects.,. British  
jurisdiction- is thus extended to neu  
tral vessels in a situation where no  
laws can operate but Ihe law of na  
tions and the laws of the, country to  
which the vessels belong ;5and a self­  
redress is assumed which, if British  
kubjects were wrongfully detained and  
alone concerned, is that substitution  
of force, for a resort to the responsi  
ble sovereign, which f.dls within the  
uennmon 01 war. vouiu tne seizure  
of British subjects, in such cases be  
regarded as within the exercise of a  
belligerent right, the acknowledged  
laws of war, which forbid an article.  
of-captured property to be adjudged  
without a regular investigation before  
a competent tribunal, would imneri  
ously demand the fairest trial where  
the sacred rights of persons were at  
issue. In place of stich a trial, these  
rights are subjected, to the will of  
even; petty commander. ;. r  
The practice, hence, is so far from  
.(fleeting BritisK subjects &quot;alone,thati  
under the Dretext of searching . for  
these,&#x27; thousands of American citi­  
zens, under the safeguard 6f public  
law, and oFthpxr, national flag, have  
been torn from their, countrvv arid  
from every thing dear to them ; have  
been dragged , oflloard ships of war  
of a foreign nation, and exposed,  
under the severities of their discipline,

to be the j melancholy intrumtnt a of  
taking away those of their own bre-  
tnren. ,  
f Against thi3 crying enormity,  
which G. Brita1nW0uld.be so prompt  
to avenge if. committed against her­  
self, Ihe U. States haVe in vain ex­  
hausted remonstrances and expostu  
lations. And that no proof might  
be wanting ot their conciliatory,dis  
positions, and no pretext left for a  
continuance of, the pfattxce, the.Bri&#x27;  
tish Government was&#x27; formerly as  
sured of the readiness of the U. S.&quot;.  
to enter into arrangements, such as  
could not be rejected; if the recovery  
of British subjects were the real and  
the sole object. The comjnunication  
Dassed without effect. , ;  
fen  
Bntisp cruisers have been in the pi  
actice also of violating the rights  
and the peace of our coasu. , They  
hover over harrass our entering and V  
departing commerce. To the? most. I  
insulting pretensions they have added I  
&#x27;&#x27; PI  
the most lawless proceeqingc .in our  
very harbors ; and have1 wantonly  
spilt Ametrican blood within the sanc­  
tuary of our territorial jurisdiction.  
The principles and rules enforced by  
that nation, when a neutral nation,  
against armed vessels of belligerents  
hovering near her coasts, and dis­  
turbing her commerce,! are well  
known. When called on, neverthe­  
less, by the U. States to punish the  
greater offences committed by her  
own vessels, her government has be  
stowed on their commanders additi  
onal marks of honor and confidence.  
Under pretended blockades, with  
out the presence of an adequate force,  
and sometimes without the practica  
bility of applying one, our commerce  
has been plundered in every sea ; the  
great staples of our country have been  
cutoff from their legitimate markets,  
anda destructive blow aimed ;at our  
agricultural and maritime interests.&#x27;  
In aggravation of these j predatory  
measures, they have been considered  
as in force from the dates of their no  
tification j a retrospective effect being  
thus added, as has been done mother  
important cases, to the unlawfulness  
ot the course pursued. And to ren  
der the outrage the more signal, these  
mock blockftjes have been! reiterated  
and enforced irVthe facer of official  
communications from the British go  
vernment, declaring; as the true de­  
finition of a legal blockade,!1 that par  
ticular ports must be actually invest  
ed, and previous warning given to  
vessels bound to theci not&#x27; to enter.&quot;  
Not content with these JKxasiona&#x27;  
expedients, for laying waste our neu-  
iral trade.&#x27; thc cabinet &#x27;of G. Britain  
resorted, at lernth, to the sweeping  
system of blockades, under the name  
of :&#x27;,Orders in Council, which bas  
been moulded and manage, as might  
Best suit its politicalviews, its com  
merciat jealousies, .or the Avidity of  
British cruisers. ;;. I f  
To our renionstfances against the  
complicated and transcendent injus­  
tice of this innovation, the! first reply  
was that the orders were reluctantly  
auoptea&#x27;Dy u. oritain as a; necessary  
retaliation on decrees of her enemy  
proclaiming a general blockade of the  
British isles, at a time when the naval  
force of that enemy dared notto issue  
from his own pprts. bhe,was.re  
minded, without effect, .that .Her own  
prior blockades, unsupportecJy an  
adequate navaLforce attually applied,  
and continued,wereabar to this plea :  
that executed edicts against millions  
of our property could not be&#x27;Tfctalia-  
lion oneaicrsconiesscaiy impossiDic  
to be &#x27;executed ; , that retaliati6n, to  
be just, should 4all on. the party setr  
ting the guilty example, not on an in-  
nocentrpart),; which wasjnot even  
chargeable with an acquiescence in it.

for a prohibition of ourAtradcwitlher  
enemy, by the&quot; repeal of hs prohlbi-  
lion .of our trade Atith Gi Britain,- iier.  
&#x27;cabinet, instead of a corresponding J  
repeal or a practical aiscontmoance.  
of its orders, formally avowed a de  
termination to persist m them against  
  
  
Uhe U.&#x27; States&quot;, until &quot;fine markets of

ing the insincerity of those profes  
sions which inculcated a belief thatp  
having resorted to her orders with re  
gret, she was anxious to jRnd an oc  
casion for putting an end to the m  
Abandoning still mors all trespeci  
for the neutral rights of the-U. States,  
and fdrjts own consistency, the Bri-  
tisn government now demands, , as  
prerequisites to a repeal of its orders,  
asr.hey.TeJate- to the UfiStates, that a  
formality shouldl be &#x27;observed in the  
repealof the French decrees nowise  
necessary to their termination;&#x27; nor  
exemplified by British I usage ; and  
that the French irepealj -Jbesides inclu  
ding that portion of the decrees which  
operates withitra territorial jurisdic-;  
tion, as wellas that which operates  
on the high seas against the commerce  
of the U. States, should not be a sin­  
gle special repeal in relaiibri to the  
U. States, but should be extended t  
whatever other neutral nations uncon­  
nected with them may be.affected by  
those decrees. And as an additional  
insult, thqy are called on for a formal  
disavo wis! ;of .conditi ons and preten -&quot;  
sidns advanced by the&#x27; French go-  
vernment, for, Which the, U States  
are. so far from having made ufiem-  
selves responsible, that, inofficial ex-  
planations,which have been published  
to the world, add in a correspondence  
of the American Minister at London  
with the British Minister for Foreign  
Affairs such a-responsibility was-ex-  
plicitly and emphatically disclaimed;  
It has. become indeed sumcieriuy  
certain that the Commerce of the U.  
States is to be sacrificed,&#x27; not as inter  
fering with the belligerent rights of  
Great Britain, not as supplying the  
wants ot her enemies which she her  
self supplies ; but as interfering with  
the monopoly which she .covets for  
ner own commerce ana navigation.-  
She carries on a war against the law  
ful commerce of a.friend, thatshc may  
the better carry on a commerce with  
5 lit!  
an enemy, a commerce polluted oy  
the forgeries and perjuries; which arc  
for the most ,part the onlypassports  
by which it can succeed.?  
Anxious1 to make every experiment  
short of the last risort of injured na­  
tions, the United States have withheld  
from Great Britain, under successive  
modifications, the? ; benefits of a free  
intercourse with their market, the loss  
of which could not but outweigh the  
profits accruing from&#x27;her restrictions  
of our commerce with other nations;  
And to entitle these .experiments to ;

of the United States.  
I communicate to congress certain docu  
! ments. being a continuation of tliose here o­  
fore laid beiorethem, on the suoject of our  
aiTsi&#x27;s wi^n Great Britain.  
Without going back beyon l the renewal  
in Iir-03 oftne war in which G Britain is en  
gaged, and orniting unrepaired wrong* of in  
te’ior magnitude, the voJuct of her govern,  
men* prevent* i series of hostile to the  
United States as an independent and neutral  
nation.  
British cruisers have been in the continued  
practice of violating the American ilag on the  
great highway of nations, and of seizing and  
carrying ofTpersons sailing under it; not in  
the exercise of a belligerent right founded on  
the law of nations against an enemy, but of a  
municipal prerogative over British subjects.  
British jurisdiction is t! s extended to neutral  
vessels in a situation where no laws can ope­  
rate but the law of nations of the country to  
which the vessels belong ; and a self-redress  
is assumed which, if British subjects wore  
wrongfully detained and alone concerned, is  
that substitution of force, fora resort to the  
responsible sovereign, which falls within the  
definition of war. Could the seizure of Bri­  
tish subjects in such cases lie regarded as with­  
in the exercise of a belligerent li xht, tiie ac­  
knowledged laws of war, wnich forbid an ar­  
ticle of captured property to be a■&#x27;-judged  
without a regular investigation before .1 coni  
petent tribunal, would impeiio .sly demand  
the fairest trial where the sacred rights of  
persons were at issue. In place of such a tri­  
al, these rights are subjected to the will of  
every petty commander.  
The practice, hence, is so far from affect­  
ing British subjects alone, taut, under the  
pretext ef searching for these, thousands of;  
American citizens, under the safeguard of!  
public law, and of their national flag, have  
been torn from their country and from every  
thing dear to them ; have been dragged *&gt;n  
board snips ot war of a foreign nation and ex­  
posed, unde,rthe severities of their discipline,  
to be exiled to the most distant elimci, to  
risk their lives in the battles of their oppres  
sors, and to he the melancholy instruments of  
taking away those of their own brethren.  
Against this crying enormity, which Great  
Britain would be so prompt to avenge, ifcom­  
mitted against herself, tne U. States have in  
vain exhausted remonstrances and expostula­  
tion*. And that no proof might he wanting  
of their conciliatory dispositions, and no pre,  
text loft for a continuance of the practice,  
the British government was formally assured  
of the readiness of the U. S. to enter into ar­  
rangements, such as could not be rejected, if  
the recovery of British subjects were the real  
and the sole object. The communication  
passed without effect.  
British cruizers have been in the practice  
also of violating the rights and the peace of  
our coasts. They hover over and harr.iss our  
entering and departing commerce. To the  
most insulting detentions they have added the  
most lawless proceedings in our very har­  
bours ; and have wantonly spilt American  
blood within the sanctuary of our territoreal  
jurisdiction. The principles and rules enfor­  
ced by that nation when a neutral nation, a­  
gainst armed vessels of belligerents, hovering  
near her coasts, and disturbing her commence,  
are well known When called on, neverthe  
less, by the U. States to punish the greater of  
fences committed by her own ves.-els, her go­  
vernment has bestowed on their comman  
ders additional marks of honor and eonC,­  
denoe.  
  
To our remonstrance* against the compli  
cated and trancendant injustice of this inno  
vatinn. the lirst reply was that the orders  
were reluctantly adopted by Great Britain as  
a necessary retaliation on decrees of her ene­  
my proclaiming a general blockade of the  
British isles, at a time when the naval force  
of that enemv dared not to issue from his own  
ports. She was reminded, without effect,  
that her own prior blockades, unsupported bv  
an adequate naval force actually applied and  
continued, were a bar to this plea ; that exe  
cuied edicts against millions of our property  
could not be retaliation on edicts, confess! My  
impossible to be executed : that retaliation,  
to be just should fall en the party setting the  
guilty example, not on an innocent party,  
which was not even chargeable with an acqui­  
escence in it.  
When deprived of this flimsy veil for a pro  
hibition of our trade with her enemy, bv the  
repeal of his prohibition of our trade with G.  
Britain, her cabinet, instead of &amp; correspond­  
mg repeal or a practical discontinuance of its  
orders, formally avowing a determination to  
persist in them against the United States, an  
tii the markets of her enemy should be laid  
oprn to British products; thus asserting an  
obligation on a natural power to require one  
belligerent to encourage, by its internal regu  
lations, the trade of another belligerent ; con­  
tradicting her own practices to all nations in  
peace as well as in war; and betraying the  
insincerity of those professions which uicul  
cated a belief that, having resorted to her or­  
ders with regret, she was anxious to find an  
occasion for putting an end to them.  
Abandoning still more all respect for the  
neutral rights of the United States, and for  
its own consistency, the British goternment  
ri&#x27;uv demands as prerequisites to a repeal of  
its orders, as they relate to the United States  
that formality should be observed in the re­  
vocation of the French decrees nowise neces­  
sary to their termination, nor exemplified by  
British usage ; and that the French repeal,  
besides including that portion of the decrees  
which operates within a territorial jurisdic­  
tion as well as that which operates on the hmh  
sous against the commerce of the U. Siates,  
should not be a single special repeal in rela  
lion to the U. S. but should be extended to  
whatever other neutral nations unconnected  
wi1 1 them may be affected by those decrees  
And ex at) additional insult, they are called  
on for a formal disavowal of conditions and  
pretensions advanced by the French govern­  
ment, for which the United States are so far  
from having made themselves responsible,  
that, in official explanations, which have been  
published to the world, and in a correspon­  
dence of the American minister at London  
with the British minister for Foreign Affairs  
such a responsibility was explicitly and em­  
phatically disclaimed.  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain  
that the commerce of the United St ates is to  
be sacrificed, not as interfering with the bel­  
ligerent rights of Great Britain, not as sup­  
plying wants of her enemies, which she her­  
self supplies ; but as interfering with the mo­  
nopoly which she eovets for her own com­  
merce and navigation. She carries on a war  
against the lawful commerce of a friend,  
that she may the better carry on a commerce  
with an enemy, a commerce polluted by the  
forgeries and perjuries which are for the most  
part the only passports by which it can suc­  
ceed. »  
  
Anxious to make every experiment short  
of the last resort of injured nations, the Uni­  
ted States have withheld from Cireat-Britain,  
under successive modifications, the benefits  
of a free intercourse with their market, the  
loss of which could not but outweigh the pro­  
fits accruing from her restrictions of our  
commerce with other nations And to enti­  
tle ti.e&#x27;ie experiments to th8 more favorable  
consideration, they were so framed as to ena­  
ble her to place her adversary under the ex  
elusive operation of them. To these appeals  
her government has been equally indexible,  
as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort,  
rather than yield to the claims of justice or  
renounce the errors of a false pride. Na v, so  
far were, the attempts carried to overcome the  
attachment of the British Cabinet to its un  
just edicts, that it received every encourage­  
ment, within the competency of the executive  
branch of our government, to expect that a  
repeal of them would be followed by a war be­  
tween the United States and France, unless  
the French edicts should also be repealed.  
Even this communication, although silencing  
forever the plea of a disposition in the United  
States to acquiesce in those edicts, originally  
the sole plea for them, received no attention.  
If no other proof existed of a predetermina­  
tion of the British government against a repeal  
of its orders, it might be found in the corres­  
pondence of the minister plenipotentiary of  
the United States at London, and the British  
secretary for foreign affairs in 1810, on the  
question whether the blockade of May lfi06  
was considered as in force or as not in force.  
It had been ascertained that the French go­  
vernment, which urged this blockade as the  
ground of its Berlin decree, was willing, in j  
the event of its removal, to repeal that de i  
cree ; which being followed by alternate r

l.iuler pretended blockades, without the  
presence of an adequate force, and sometimes  
without the practicability of applying one,  
our commerce has been plundered in every  
sea ; the great staples of our country have  
been cut off from their legitimate markets;  
and a destructive blow aimed at our agricul­  
tural and maritime interests. In aggravation  
of these predatory measures, they have been  
considered a3 in force from the dates of their  
notification ; a retrospective effect being thus  
added, as has been done in other important  
cases, to the unlawfulness of the course pur­  
sued. And to render the outrage the more  
signal, these mock blockades have been rei­  
terated and enforced in the face of official  
communications from the British government,  
declaring as the true definition of a legal  
blockade “ that particular ports must be ac­  
tually invested, and previous warning given  
to vessels bound to them, not to enter.&quot;  
Not content with these occasional expc  
dients for laying waste our neutral trade, the  
Cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at length,  
to the sweeping system of blockades, under

peal* of the other offensive edicts, might a&lt;U\‘  
bolish the whole system on both sides. Thi»Jr  
inviting opportunity for accomplishing an ob-\v  
ject so important to the United States, an&lt;*T*\
professed so often to he the desire of both tbeUV  
belligerents, was made known to the B &#x27;•&#x27;if&#x27;Vw  
government. As that government adn  
tnat an actual application of an adequate fo» je&#x27;T  
is necessary to the existence ofa legal bkv t-M  
side, and it was notorious, that if such a forca wk  
had ever been applied, its long discontinuance Ski  
had annulled the blockade in question, there Ct  
could be no sufficient objection on the part of ™  
(.treat Britain to a formal revocation of it; \
and no imaginable objection to a declaration A  
i of the fact tnat the blockade did not ejtist. I  
The declaration would have been consistent &#x27;  
with tier avowed principles of blockade, and  
would have enabled the United states to de­  
mand from France the. pledged repeal of her  
decrees ; either with success, in which ease  
the way would have been opened for a gene­  
ral repeal of the belligerent edicts ; or with­  
out success, in which case the United States  
would have been justified in turning their  
measures exclusively against France. The  
British government would, however, reitlier  
rescind the blockade nor declare its nun exia­  
tence ; nor permit its non existence to he in­  
ferred and affirmed by the American plenipo­  
tentiary. On the contrary, by representing  
the blockade to be comp,eoended in the or­  
ders in council, the United Sta&#x27;ea we-e com­  
pelled so to regard it in their subsequent pro­  
  
ceedmga.  
Inhere was a period when a favorable  
change in the policy of t ie British cabinet,  
was justly considered as established. Tii*  
minister plenipotentiary erf his Britannic ma­  
jesty here proposed an adjustment of the dif­  
ferences more immediately endangering the  
harmony of the two countries. The proposi­  
tion was accepted with promptitude and cor­  
diality corresponding with the invariable pro­  
fessions of this government. A foundation ap­  
peared to be laid for a sincere and lasting re­  
conciliation. The prospect, however, quick­  
ly vanished. The whole proceeding was disa­  
vowed by the British government, without any  
explanations which could at that time repress  
the belief, that the disavowal proceeded from  
a spirit of hostility to the commercial right*  
and prosperity of the U. S. And it has since  
come into proof, that at tko very moment,  
when the public minister was funding the  
language of friendship and inspiring confi­  
dence in the sincerity of the negotiation with  
which he was charged, a secret agent of&quot; hi*  
government was employed in intrigues, hav­  
ing for their object a subversion of our go­  
vernment, and a dismemberment of our hap­  
py union.  
In reviewing the conduct of Cl. Britain to­  
wards the U. Slates our attention is necessa­  
rily drawn to the warfare just renewed by the  
savages on one of our extensive frontiers; a  
warfare which is known to spare neither age m  
nor sex, and to he distinguished by feature*  
peculiarly shocking to humanity. It is diffi­  
cult to account for the activity and combina- I 1  
tions which have for some time been devel­  
oping themselves among tribes in the con­  
stant intercourse with Britisli traders and  
garrisons, without connecting their hostility  
with that influence ; and without recollecting  
the authenticated examples of such interposi­  
tions heretofore furnished by the officers and  
agents of that government.  
  
Such is the spectacle oi injuries ann mcig­  
nitie.s which have been heaped on onr coun­  
try : ami such the crisis which its unexampled  
! forbearance and conciliatory efforts have not  
* been able to avert. It miglit at least have  
been exjieetad, that an enlightened nation, if  
less urged by moral obligations, or invited  
by friendly dispositions on the part of the |7.  
States would have found in its true interest  
alone, a sufficient motive to respect their  
rights and their tranquility on the high seas ;  
that an enlarged policy would have fnvorW ,  
that free and general circulation of ( ommerce,  
in which the British nation is at all times in­  
terested, and which in times of warn theh-st  
alleviation of its calamities to hersell as welt  
as the other belligerents ; and more especial­  
ly that the British cabinet would not, tor the  
sake of a precarious and surreptitious inter­  
course with hostile markets, have persevered  
in a course of measures which necessarily put if  
at hazard the invaluable market of a great  
ami growing country, disposed to-cultivatetlie  
mutual advantages of an active commerce.  
Other councils have prevailed. Our mode­  
ration and conciliation have had no other ef­  
fect than to encourage perseverance, and to  
enlarge pretensions. We behold oar seafar­  
ing citizens still the daiiy victims ofiawles*  
violence committed on the great conumin and  
Highway of nations, even in sight ot the coun­  
try which owes them protection. Wo behold  
our vessels, freighted with the products of C!  
soil and industry, or returning with the horn  
proceeds of them, wrested from their law

We Ijc’iold, in tine, on the part of Great­  
Britain a state of war against the UnitedStates;  
and on the side of the United States a state of  
peace towards Great-Britain.  
Whether the United States shall continue

force to force in defence ot their natural rights,  
shall commit a just cause into the hands ol  
the Almighty Disposer of events, avoiding

of the United Stites with Great-Britain and oi

1 proceed to remark that the communications

since the revocation of her decree# as they  
violated the neutral rights of the United  
States, her government lias authorised illegal

and that other outrages have been practised  
on our vessels and our citizens. It will have  
been seen also, that no indemnity hau been  
provided, or satisfactorily pledged tor tbe ex  
tensive spoliations committed under the vio  
lent and retrospective orders of the French  
government against the property of our citi  
v.ens seized within the jurisdiction of France  
1 abstain at this time from recommending to  
the consideration of congress delinitive raen­

pectation that the result of unclosed discus

oulrage the inore figoal, these mock  
blockaces have been .reiterated and  
enforced in the faice of ¢ flicial com.  
muaications from the Biruth zovert.

particular ports aiuft be «&amp;ually ia­  
velted, and previous warning given  
to vellels bouad 1o them, not to

Not content with thefz occasional  
expedients for layiny: waste cur ncu­  
tral trade, the Caibmet. of Greag  
Britain resorted, at length. to the  
sweeping fyflem of blockaces, under

which has been moulded and mana­

To our remonftracees against the  
coa.plicated &amp; traniceadant i jaltice  
of this Innovatign, the firlk reply was  
that the orders wzre reiuétuntiy ad­  
opied by Great Britain &#x27;as a neceflary  
reialiation on decrees of her enewmy .  
proclaiming a geueral blockade of  
the British ifl:s, at a time when the  
naval force of th2t enemy dared not  
to issue from his own ports. She  
was reminded without effe @, that her  
own prior blockades, unin, portec by  
an adeqﬁ&#x27;i?ﬁaval forceaduaily appli­  
ed and continued, were a bar to this  
plea ; that exccuted ed.&amp;s againlk

party fztting the guilty example, not,  
on an innocent party, which was not  
even churgeable with an acquieicence  
in it. . .  
When deprived of this flimfey veil

- publified’ to the world, and in a  
“correfpor ence of the American  
pmg: at London with the British  
~Minifter for Foreign Affairs, such  
a responsibility was explicitly and  
empbatically disclaimed. o  
It has become indzed fufficiently  
certain that the cowimerce of the  
United States is to be facrificed,  
not as interfering with the belig­  
erent rights of Great Britain, not as  
supplying the wants of herenemies,  
which fh= herfelf {upplies; &quot;but as in­  
terfering with the monropoly which  
flie covets for her own commerce and­  
. pavagation. She carries on a war  
against the lawful commerce of a  
friend, that she may the better carry  
on a commerce with an enemy, a  
commerce polluted by the forgeries  
and perjuries which are for the  
molt part the only pafiport by which  
it can succeed.  
Arncxious to make every experi­  
ment thare of the last refore of iocjur­  
ed natioas, the Unitred States have  
withheld from Great Britain, under  
foceefive modifications, the bene­  
fits of a free intercourfz with their  
market, the loss of which counld not  
but outweigh the profits accruing  
from her reftrictsion of our com:  
merce with other nations. And to  
entitle these experiments to the more  
favorable consideration, they were  
framed asto enable her to place her  
adversary undér the exclusive opera­  
tion of them. ,  
To these appeals her government has  
“been equally inflexible, as if willing  
to make facrifices of every fort,  
‘rather thdn yield to the claims of  
““juflice or rembunce the errors of a  
falfe pride. n Nay, {o far were the  
attempts carried, to overcome the  
attachment of the British Cabinet to  
its uvjult edifts, thar it received  
every encouragement, within the  
competency cf the Executive branch  
‘of our government, to expet that  
a repeal of them would be follow­  
ed by a war between the United  
States and France, unless the French  
edi&amp;ts should aifo be repezled. Even  
this communication, although silen­  
cing forever the plea of a difpofi  
tion in the United States to acquiesce  
in those edifs, - originally the sole  
plea for them, received no attention.  
If no other proof. existed of a pre­  
determination of the Britith govera­  
ment against a repeal of its orders, it  
might be found in the correspondence  
of the Minilter Plenipotentiary of the  
United Stdates at Londos, and the  
Biitifly Secretary for Foreign Affairs  
in 1810, on&quot;the question whether the  
blockade of May 1806 was consider­  
ed as in force or as not in force. It  
had been ascertained that the French  
government, which urged this block­  
ade as the ground of its Berlin decree,  
was willing, inthe event of its removal,  
to repeal that” decree ; which being  
followed by alternate repeals of the  
other offénfive edicts, might abolith  
the whole {yltem on bot;\%ﬁdcs. This  
inviting opportunity for zccomplifh­  
ing an obje&amp; so important to the Uait  
ed States, and profefied so often to be  
the delire of both the belligerents,  
was made kaowu to the Briufh gov­  
érnment. As that government ad­  
mits that aa a&amp;ual application of an  
adequate force is necessary to the ex­  
titence of a legal blockade, and it was  
notorigus, that if such a force had ev­  
er been %applied, its long difcontin­  
uwance had ‘2nnulled the blockzde in  
2neﬂim, there ‘could be no fufficient  
‘6bje&amp;ion on the part of G. Britaintoa  
formal revocation of it ; and no imag­  
iable objeftion to a declaration of  
the ‘fa&amp; that the blockade did “not  
exilt,, The declaration wotlld have  
‘be=en consistent with her avowed prin­  
ciples of blockade, and would bave  
enabled the U. BBtates to demand  
from France the pledged repeal of  
her decrees; either with success, in  
which case the way would have been  
- opened for a general repeal of the bel­  
ligerent edi@®: ; or without success, in  
which case the U. States would have  
“been juftified o turning their mea­  
fores exclusively again® France. The  
Briuih governmwent wovld, however,  
‘neither refeind the blockade nor des  
claie its non-existence, nor permit its  
non existence -to be inferred and af­  
firmed by the American Plenipoten­  
tiary.—~Qn the contrary by reprefent­  
-ipg the blockade to be comprehended  
in the orders in council, the United  
States were compeiled so to-regard it  
4 their subsequent procecdings. .  
. There was a period when a favora.  
ble changein the policy of the Britith  
eabinst-was juitly e@hl{ dered as eftab.  
‘lithed. ‘The Mmifter Pienipotentiary  
i Brinsmmlic i by hete propot­  
-€d ‘an acjufment of the differentes

“The whole prereeding was disavowed  
by the British government without  
any explanation which could at that  
“time rgorels the belicf, that the dila.  
mwxmceded from a {pirit of hol  
tility ‘to the commercial rights and  
profperty of the United States. And  
it has finct tome into proof, that at  
the very moment when the public  
Minister was holding the language of  
friendfhip, and inspiring confdence in  
the sincerity of the negociation with  
which he was charged, a secret agent  
of his goverament was employed in  
wntrigues, chaving for their obje@ a  
fuhverfion of our government and a  
‘difmemb=2rmeant of our happy Union.  
Ia reviewing the con uct of Great  
Britain towards the United States,  
our attention is neccfiarily drawn to  
the warfare just renswed by the fava.  
ges on one of our extensive frontiers ;  
a warfare which is kaown to {paré  
neither age nor {:x, and to be diltin­  
guithed by features peculirly thock.  
in to humanity. It is dificult toac­  
count for the a&amp;ivity and combina­  
tions which have for some time been  
developing themfeives amoang the  
®ibes in coaftact intercourfe’ with  
British traders and garrifoas, without  
conneing their hostility with that in­  
fluence ; agd without recoile@ing the  
authenticated examplés of such ioter:  
poiitions heretofore furnilhed by the  
officers and agents of that govern­  
ment.  
Such is the fpe@acle of injuries and  
indignaties which have been tieaped on  
our country ; and {uch the crisis which  
its unexampled forbearance and cen­  
ciliatory efforts have not been able to  
avert. It might at leat have been  
expected, that an ¢nlightened nation,  
if lets uiged by moral obligations, or  
invited by frieadly dispositions on the  
part of the United States wouid hdve  
found in its true interests alone a {uf­  
ficient motive to refpe® their rights  
and their tranquility on the high seas ;  
that an enlarged policy would have  
favered that fiee and general circula­  
tioa of commerce, in which the Brit.  
ith vation is at all times interelted,  
and which in times of war is the b=  
alleviation of its calamities to ht{eif,  
~as well as the other belligerents’; and  
more especially that the British Cabi.  
net would not, for the fake of a pre.  
carious and surreptitious intercourse  
- with hostile markets, have persevered  
in a course of measures- which neces­  
sarily put at hazard the invaluable  
market of a great and growing coun­  
try, disposed to cultivate the mutual  
advantages of an a&amp;tive eommerce.  
. Other councils have prevailed. Cz;t  
- moderation and conciliation have had  
0o other cffe&amp;@ than to encourage per­  
severance, and to enlarge pretentions.  
We behold our feafaring citizens fill  
the daily v&#x27;@ims of lawlels vislence  
committed ag the great common and  
highway of nations, even within fight  
of the country which owes them pro­  
teCtion. We behold our veflels,freight­  
ed with the produés of our {uil and  
industry, or returaing with the honest  
proceeds of them, wrested fiom their

couris no loager the organs of public  
law, but the inflramenis of arbitrary  
edifs ;3 and their uufortunate crews  
dispersed and loft, or torced or inveig­  
led in Britith ports into Britith fleets  
whillt arguments are employed in  
support of these aggreflions, which  
have no fouandation but in a principle  
equally supporting a claim to regulate  
our external commerce in all cases  
what{osver. -  
We behold, in fine, on the fide of  
G. Britain, a state of war against the  
United States 3 and on the fide of the  
United States, a state of peace to­  
wards Great Britain.  
Whether the United Srates shall

ing wrongs 3 or, opposing force to  
force in defence of their natural rights,  
’fhali; commit a just cause into the

might entangle it in the contefls ot

honorable &#x27; re.eftablithment of peace  
and friendfhip, is a solemn queßion,  
which the conftitation wifely confides  
to the Legislative Department of the

I communicate to Congress certain docus  
ments, being a continuation of thuse bereto­  
fore laid belore them, on the subject of our  
affairs with Great Briwin.  
  
Without going back beyond the renewal in  
1803 of the war 1a which G, Britain is engag­  
ed, and omitting vnrepaired wiougs ol lafcrior  
muagnitude, the conduct ol her government  
presentea series of acts hostile o the United  
States a 8 an independent and neutral nation,  
  
“British cruizers have been in the continued  
practice of violating the American flug on the  
great highway of natfons, and ol scizing any  
carrying off pcrsons saliing under 1t not in  
the exercise of a beiligerent right founded  
on the law of nations against an enemy, but  
of a municipal prerogation over Brinsh sub­  
jects. Briush juiisdicuon s thus extended  
(0 neutral vessels in a situation where no laws  
can operate but the law ol nauons and of the  
country to which the vesscis belong 5 and a  
self-cedress is agsumed which, if Broash sube  
jects were wrongluily detamed and alone con­  
cerned, is that substi.uition ot force, lor a re­  
sort to the tesponsibie sovercign, which falls  
within the definiion of war. Could the seiz­  
ure of Briiish subjects in such cases be regar­  
ded as within the cxercise ol a belllgerent  
right, the acknowledged laws of war, which  
fornid an arugle of captured property to be  
adjudiged wihout a_regular tnvestigauon be­  
fore + competent tribunal, would wmperiousty  
demand the faorest wial where the sacred  
rights of persons were at Issue. In place ol  
such a trial, these rights ave subjected to the  
will of every p~uy commander.  
Tle practice, hence, is 50 far fiom aflect­  
ing British subjects alone, that, under the  
aretext of searcoing for these, thousands ol  
American citizens, under the saleguard of  
public law, and of their nationai flig, have  
been torn from their countiy and [own every  
thing dear to them ; have been diagyped on  
bourd ships of war of a loreign nauon and  
exposed, under the severities of therr disci­  
pline, to be exiled to the most distunt and  
deudly cliraes, to visk their lives in the bat­  
tles of their oppressors, and to b: the mel­  
ancholy instraments of taking away those  
af their own brethren.  
  
Against this crying enormity, which Great  
Britain would be suo prompt to avenge, if  
committed against herselfy the Unired States  
have in vain exhausted remonstrances and  
expostulations. Aad that no proot might be  
wantipy of their conciliatory disporitions, and  
no pretext lelt for « continuance ot the prac­  
tice, the British government was formally as­  
sured of the readiness ol the Janited Siates  
to enter into arrangements, such as could not  
be rejected, it the recovery of British sub­  
jects were the real and sole object. The  
communication passed without etlect.  
British cruizers have been in the practice  
also ol violating the rights and the peace of  
our coasts. They hover over and harrass our  
entering and departing commetrce. To the  
most msulting detentions they have added the  
most lawless proceedings in our very barbors;  
and have wantonly spilt Americsn blood with­  
in the sanctuary of our territorial jutisdiction.  
The principles and rules enlorced by that pa­  
tion when a neutral nation, against armed  
vessels of belligerenis hovering unear her  
coasts, and disturbing her commerce, are  
well known. When called on, nevertheless,  
by the U, States te punish the greater offzn­  
ces committed by her own vessels, ber gov­  
ernment has bestowed on ler commanders  
additional macks of honor and confidence.  
Under pretended blockades, without the  
presence of an adequate lorce, and sometimes  
without the pracuibility of applying one, ous  
commerce hus been plundered in every sea ;  
the great staples of our county have been  
cut off from their legitimute markets ; and «  
destructive blow aimed at our agriculiural and  
maritime interests. In aggravation of these  
predatory measures, they have been consider­  
ed i+ in force from the dates of their notifica  
tion ; &amp; retrospective effect being thus udded,  
as (las been done in other important cases, 10  
the uniawlulness ol the course pursued.  
And to render the outrage the more signal,  
these mock blockades have been reiterated  
and enforced in the face of official communi­  
cations from the British goverament, declar­  
jng the true definition of a lcgal blockade  
« that particular ports must be actually inves.  
ted, and previous warning given (o vessels  
pound 1o them, not to enter.”  
ot content with these occavional expedi­  
  
W AR.  
  
* m A |  
ent for laying w heutral trade, the  
Cabinet of Great resorted, at length,  
to the sweeping sy of biuckades, under  
l the name of Orders in Council, which bas  
been moulded and managed, as mizht best  
! suit its political views,its commercial jealou­  
sies, or the avidity of British cruizers,  
To our remonstrances against the cempli­  
cated and transcendant injustice of this inno­  
vation, the first reply was that the orders  
were reluctantly adopted by Grear britain as  
l a necessary | cuailation on decrees of her ene­  
my proclaimicg a general blockede ol the  
Briush isles, ot a time when the n+val force  
of thet enemy dared not to issue from his  
own ports. She was reminded, without effect,  
~ that her own prior bleckades, unsupported by  
an adequate naval force actually vpplicd and  
continued, were &amp; bar to this ples 5 that exe­  
cuted edicts against millions of our property  
could not be retaliation on edicts, coulessed­  
ly impossible to be exccuted @ that retaliation,  
to be just shouid fall on the party sciing the  
guilty example, not on au Inpeccnt parly  
which was not even chargeable with an ac­  
qeiescence in it.  
When deprived of this flimsy veil for a  
prohibition ef our trade with her enemy, by  
the repeal of his prohibition ¢f our trade with  
Great Bratain, her cabiner, instead of a cor­  
responding repeal or a practical disconting­  
ance of its orders, formally avowed a deter­  
mination te persist in them agaiust the Uni.  
ted States, until the markets of her enemy  
should be laid open 1o British products ; thus  
usserting an obligation on a neutral power to  
require one belligerent to encourage, by its  
interna! regulations, the trade of anether bel­  
ligerent ; contradicting her own practices to  
all nations in peace as well as in war ; and  
betraying the lnsincerity ol those prolessions  
whica inculcaled a belief tnat, having resort­  
ed to her orders with regret, she was anxious  
to find an occusion for puiting an end to them,  
Abandoning still more all respect for the  
neutral rights of the United States, and for  
its own cousistency, the British government  
now demands as prerequisites to a repeal of  
its orders, as they relate to the United States,  
that a formallry should be observed in the re­  
peal of the French decrees nowise necessary  
to theiv termination, nor exewplified by  
British usage ; and that the French repeal,  
besides including that portion of the decrees  
whichoperetes within a territorial jurisdiction  
as well as that which operates on the high  
scas against the commieree of the U, States,  
should not be a single special repeal in relas’  
tion o the U. Stutes,but should be extended  
1o whatever other neutral nattons unconnect.-  
cd with themm may be affected by those de­  
ciees. And as an addidional insult, they ate  
called on lor a formal disavowal of conditions  
and pretensions advanced by the French gov­  
eroitient, for which the U. States are so far  
from having made themsclves respensible,  
that, in ofiicial explanations, which hare been  
published 1o the world, and in a co&#x27;respon­  
dence of the American minister at London  
with the British minister for Foreign Aflairs,  
such u responsithility was explicitly and em­  
phatically disclaimed.  
It has become indeed sufficiently certain  
that the commerce of the U. States is to be  
sacrificed, not as interfering with the bellig­  
erent rights of G, Britain, not as suppiying  
waunts of her enemics, which she hersell sup­  
plies ; but as interlering with the monopoly  
which she covets tor her own commerce and  
pavigaton. She carrics on a war aghinst the  
lawtul commerce ol a lriend, that she may  
the better carry on a commerce with an enc­  
my, a commerce polluted by the jorgeries  
and perjuries which are for the most part the  
only passports by which it can succeed.  
Auxious to make every experimaent short  
of the last resort of injured nations, the U.  
States have withheld from G. Brituin, under  
successive modifications, the &quot;benelits of a  
itee intercourse with their market, the loss  
of which could not but outweigh the profits  
accruing from her restrictions of our com­  
merce with other nations. And to entitle  
these experiments to the more favorable con­  
sideration, they were so framed 23 to enable  
her to place her adversary under the exclu­  
sive operation of them. To these appeals  
her government has been equally inflexible,  
as 1 willing 10 make sacrifices of every sort,  
vathor then yield to the claims of justice or  
renounce the errors of a false pride. Nay,  
so far were the attempts carvied to overcome  
the attachment of the British Cubinet to its  
unjust edicts, that it received every encour­  
agement, within the competency of the ex­  
ecutive branch of our government, to expect  
that a repeal of them would be followed by a  
war between the Unied States and France,  
unless the French edicts shouid also be re­  
pealed. Even this communication, although  
silencing for ever the plea of a disposition in  
the U. States to acquiesce in those cdicts, o­  
riginally the sole plea for them, received no  
attention.  
  
If no other proof existed of a predetermi­  
nation of the Briush government against a  
repeal of its orders, 1t might be found in the  
correspondence ol the minister plenipotentia­  
ry of the U. States at London, and the Brit­  
ish secretary for foreign uffairs m 1810, on  
he ouesticn whether the blockade ot May  
1806 wus cousidered as in force or as not in  
iorce, It had been ascertained that the  
I&#x27;rench government, which urged this block­  
ade as the ground with its Berlin decree, was  
willing, in the event of its remeval, to repeal  
that decree ; which, being followed by alter­  
nae repeals of the other offensive edicts,  
might abolish the whole system on both sides.  
T&#x27;his invitiog opportunity for accomplishing  
an vbject so important to the U, States, and  
professed so often to be the desire of both  
the belligerents, was made known to the Bri­  
ush. government. As that government ad­  
mits that an actual application of an adequate  
  
force is necessary to the existence of a legal  
blockade, and it was notorious, that if such a  
force had ever Leen applied,its long discontin­  
ance had annulled the ULlockade in question,  
there could Le no sufficient ohjection on the  
part of G, Dritin to a formal revocation of  
it ; and no imaginable objection to a declara-  
  
tion of the fact that the blockade did not ex-  
  
ist. The declaration would have been con­  
sistent with ber avowed principles of block­  
ade, and would have enabled the U. States to  
demand fiom Frence the pledged repeal of  
her decrees ; either with success, in which  
case the way wou!d have been opened for a  
general repeal of the belligerent edicts ; or  
without success, in which case the United  
States would have been jusufied in turning  
their measures exclusively against France.  
The British government would, however,  
peither rescind the blockade nor declare its  
  
non-existence ; nor permit its non-existence  
  
w 0 be nferred and afirmed by the American  
  
plenipetentiary. On the contrary, by repre­  
seuting the biockade to be compiehended in  
the orders in council, the United States were  
compelled 50 to regard it in their subsequent  
preceedings.  
There was a period when a favorable change  
in the policy of the British cabinet, was just­  
i considered as established. &quot;The minister  
Menipotentiary of his Britannic majesty bere  
proposed an adjustment of the differences  
more immediately endangering the harmony  
-of the two countiies, ‘L&#x27;he proposition was  
accepted with promptitnde and cordiality cor­  
responding with the invariable professions of  
this government. A foundation appeared to  
be laid for a sincere and lasting reconciliation.  
The prospeety, however, quickly vanished.  
The whole proceeding was disavewed by the  
British government without any explanations  
which could at that time repress the beliel,  
that the disavowal proceeded from a spirit of  
hostility to the commercial rights and pros­  
perity of the United States. And it has since  
come into proof, that at the very moment,  
when the public minister was holding the  
language ol friendship and inspiring confi­  
dence in the sincerity of the negotiation with  
which he was charged, a secret agent of his  
government was employed in intrigues, hav­  
ing [or their object a subversion of our gov­  
cromenty and a dismemberment of our hap­  
py union. e  
  
In reviewing the conduct of (. Britain to­  
wards the U, States our atteftion is necessa­  
vily drawn to the warfare just renewed by the  
savages on one of our extensive frontiers ; a  
warlare which is known to sppare neither age  
nor scx, and to be distinguisfed by features  
peculiarly shocking to humuanity. It is diffi­  
cult to account for the activity and combina­  
tions which have for some time been develo­  
ping themsclves umong tribes in the constant  
intercourse with British traders and garrisons,  
without connecting that hostility with that in­  
fuence ; and without recollecting the authen­  
ticated examples of such interpositions here­  
tofore furnished by the officers and agents of  
that goverament, ‘  
  
Soch is the spectacle of injuries and indig­  
uities which have been heaped on our country;  
and such the crisis which its unexampled for­  
bearance and concilistory eflorts have not  
been able to avert. It might at ieast have  
been expected, that an enlightened nation, if  
less urged by moral obligations, or invited by  
triendly dispositions on the part of the Unit­  
ed States would have {ound, 1n its true inter­  
cst alone, a suflicient motive to respect their  
rights and their tranquility on the high seas ;  
that an enlarged policy would have favored  
that {ree and general circulation of com­  
merce, in which the British nation is at all  
times interested; and which in umes of war  
is the best alleviation of its calamities to her­  
selfl as well as the other belligerents ; and  
more especially that the British cabinet would  
not, for the sake of a precarious and sur­  
reptitious intercourse with hostile markets,  
have persevered in the course of measurcs  
which necessarily put at hazard the invalua­  
ble market of a great and growing country,  
disposed to cultivate the mutual advantages  
of an active commerce. A  
  
Other councils have prevailed. Our mod­  
eration and conciliation have had no other ef  
fect than to encourage perseverunce, and to  
enlarge pretensions. \We bebold our seafar­  
ing citizens still the daily victims of lawless  
violence committed on the great common  
and highway of nations,even withinsightof the  
country which owes them protection. \We  
behold our vessels, freighted with the pro­  
ducts of our scil and industry, or returning  
with the honest proceeds of them, wrested  
from their lawlul destinations, confiscated by  
prize courts, no longer the organs of pubiic  
taw, but the instruments of arbitrary edicts ;  
and the unfortunate crews dispersed and lost,  
or forced or inveizled, in Beutish ports, into  
British fleets ; whilst arguments are employ­  
ed in support of these aggressions, which  
have no foundation but in a principle equally  
supporting a claim to regulate our external  
commerce in all cases whatsoever.  
We behold, .n fine, on the side of Great  
Britain a state of war against the U. States ;  
and on the side of the United States a state  
of peace towards Great Britain. !  
  
Whether the United States shall continue  
passive under these pregressive usurpations,  
and these accumulating wrongs ; or, oppo­  
sing force to force in defence of their natural  
rights, shall commit a just cause into the  
hands of the Amighty Disposer of events, a­  
voiding all connections which might entangle  
it in the contests or views of other powers,  
and preserving a constant readiness to concur  
in an honorable re-establishment of peace  
and friendship, is a solewnn question, which  
the constitution wisely confdes to the Legis­  
lative Department of the government. In  
recommending it 1o their carlg deliberations  
I am Bappy in the assuranis that the decision  
  
will be worthy the enlightened and patrictie  
councils of a virtuous, a free, and powerful  
nation. o  
  
Having presented this view of the relations  
of the United States with Great Britain end  
of the solemn alternative growing cut of  
them, I proceed to remurk that the commu­  
nicaticns last mude 10 Congress on the subw  
ject of our relations with l&#x27;r?nce will bhave  
shown that since the revocation of her de­  
crees as they vielated the neutral rights of  
the United States, her government has au­  
thorised illegal coptures by its privateers and  
public ships, end that other outrages have  
been practiced cn our vessels @nd our citi­  
zens It will bave been seen also, that ne  
indemnity hud been provided, or satisfaciori­  
ly pledged for the extensive spoliations com-&quot;  
mitted under the violént and retrospective  
oiders ol the French government against the  
property ef ou: ciizens seized within \he ju~  
risciction of France. 1 abstsin at this \ime  
from recommending to the consideration of  
Congress definitive measures with respect  
to that nation, in the expectution, that the re­  
sult of unclosed discussions between our  
Minister Plenipotentiary at Paris und the  
IFrench government will speedily enable Con­  
gress to decide, with gicater advsntege, on  
the course due to the rights, the interests,  
and the honor of our country.

At this time, the most important topic for consideration,  
with respect to the blockade of May 1806, is, whether our  
administration was entitled to regard and exhibit it, as a dis-  
tinct, substantial ground of war? On this head the reasoning  
of the address, is absolutely conclusive. Nothing more, in-  
deed, can be necessary for our readers than what has been al-  
ready said. We have seen, that this blockade is merged in

T communicate to Congress certain documen&#x27;s, being a cons  
tinuation of those heretofore laid befare them, ou the subject of  
our affairs with Great Britain,  
  
Without going bevond the renewal, in 1893, of the war in  
which Great Britain is engaged, and omitting unrepaired wrongs  
of infetior magnitude, the canduct of her Goverment presents  
a series of acts hostile to the United States as an independent  
and neutral nation.  
  
British cruizers have heen in the continned practice of vio.  
lating the American flag on the great highway of nations, and  
of seizing and carrying off persons sailing under it, not in the  
exercise of a belligerent right, founded on the law of vations  
against an enemy, but of a mauicipal prerogative over British  
subjects. British jurisdiction is thus extended to neatral vessels  
in a situation where no laws can operate but the law of natione  
and the laws of the couutry to which the vessels belong ; and a  
self-redress is assumed, which, if British subjects were wrong.  
fully detained and alone concerned, is that substitution of force  
for a resort to the responsible Sovercign, which falls within the  
deGinition of war. Could the seizure of British subjects, in  
such cases, be regarded as within the exercise of a belligerent  
right, the acknowledged laws of war, which forbid an article  
of captured property to be adjudged without a regular investi-  
gation before a competent tribunal, would imperiously demaid  
the fairest trial, where the sacred rights of persons were at  
issue. In place of such trial, these rights are subjected to the  
will of every petty commander,  
  
The practice, hence, is so far from affecting British subjects  
alone, that under the pretext of searching for these, thousands  
of American citizeds, under the safeguard of public laws and of  
their national flag, have been torn from their covniry, and from  
every thing dearte them,— have been dragged on board ships  
of war of a foreign nation, aad exposed, under the severities  
of their discipline, to be esifed to the most distant and deadly  
climes, to risk their lives in the battles of their opptessors, and  
to be the melancholy instruments of tnking away thove of their  
own brethren. s ’ |

THE EXAMINER  
  
S ates have in vain exhausted remonstrances and expostulations:  
god that no proof might be wanting of their conciliatory dispa-  
siftons, and no pretest lefi for continuance of the practice, the  
Brith Government was formally assured of the readiness of  
the United States to enter into arrangements, such as could not  
  
be rejected, if the recovery of the British subjects were the real |  
and the sole object. The communication passed w ithnut effect. |  
  
British ercizers have beeo in the practice also of viclating  
the rightsand peace of oar coasts. They haver and harass our  
entering and departing cémmerce, To the mast insulting pre-  
tensions they have added inwless proceedings in our very har-  
bours, ond have wantonly spilt American blood within the sanc-  
tuiry of our territorial jurisdiction, The principles and rules  
enforced by that nation, when a neutral nation, ae. armed  
vessels of belligerents hovering near her coasts, and disturbing  
her cofemerce, are well known, When called on, nevertheless,  
by the United States, to punish the greater offences committed  
by her own vessels, her Government has hestowed on their Com-  
inanders additional marks of honour and confidence,  
  
Unicr pretended blockades, without the presence of an ade-  
quate force, and sometimes without the practicability of ap-  
pivine one, our commerce has been plundered in every sea;  
fire creat staples of our coantry have been cut off fram their le-  
filimate markets; aod a destructive blow aimed at our agri-  
cultural cud maritime interests. In aggravation of these pre-  
cautery mensures, they tave been considered as in force from  
the dates of their notification; a retrospective effect being thus  
  
‘ded, as bas been done in other important cases, ta the unlaw-  
fulness of the course pursued; and to render the outrage more sig-  
nol those mock blockades have beea reiterated and enforced in  
the face of official communications from the British Govern-  
ment, declaring, as the true definition of a legal hjockade,  
¢ jhat particular ports must be actually invested, aud previous  
wirsing given to vessels bound to them not to enter,”  
  
Not content with these occasional ex pedients for laying waste  
our neutral-trade, the Cabinet of Great Britaia resorted, a:  
leneth, to the sweeping system of blockades, under the names  
of Orders in Council, which bas been moulded and managed as  
mright best cuit its political views, its commercial jealousies, or  
the avidity of the British cruizers, ;  
  
To oar remonstrancesagainst the complicated and transcendant  
injustice of this innovation, the first reply was, that the Or-  
ders were reluctantiy adopted by Great Britain as a necessary  
retaliation on decrees of ber enemy proclaiming a general block-  
ade of the British Isles, at a time when the naval force of the  
enemy dared pot to i-sue from his own ports, She was reminded,  
withont effect, that her own prior-blockades, unsupported by  
an adequate naval force actually applied and continued, were  
wu bar to this plea; that executed edicts against millions of our  
property could not be retaliation on edicts confessedly impos-  
sible tu he executed ; that retaliation, to be just, should fall  
on the party setting the guilty example, not on an innocent  
pirty, which was not even chargeable with an acquiescence  
fo ir.  
+ When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prehibition of our  
trnde with Great Britain, her Cabinet, instead of a corre-  
svonding repeal, or a pYactical distontinuance of its Orders,  
formally avowed a determination to persist in them against the  
United States, until the markets of her enemy should be laid  
epen to the Beitish products; thus asserting an obligation on a  
peviial power fo require one belligerent ta encourage, by its  
inieroul reguiations, the trade of another belligerent; contra-  
diciing her owe practice towards all nations in peace as well as  
io war; and helroying the insincerity of those professions which  
tuculeated a belief, that, having resorted to her Orders with  
regret, she was paxious (o Gad an occasion for putting an end  
  
ste them, * ; &#x27;  
&#x27; Abandoning still more all respect for the neutral rights of the  
TWoited States, and fur its own copsistency, the British Govern-  
mom gow demants, as pre-requisites to a repeal of its Orders,  
as they relate to the United Sintes, that a formality should be  
observed in the repeal of the French Decrees nowise necessary  
to their termination, nor exemplified by British asage; and  
Gat the Freoch repeal, besides including that portion of the  
  
ars 7 ’  
  
;  
  
Decrees which operates within a territorial Jurisdiction, Rs well  
as that which operates en the high seas against the commerce af  
the United States, should not be a single Special repeal in sles  
tion to the United States, but should be extended to whatever  
other pcutral nations unconnected with them inay be affecied by  
those Decrees, ‘  
And as ao additional insult, they are called on for a formal  
| disavowal of conditions and pretensions advanced by the French  
Government, for which the United States are so far from having  
been themselves responsible, that, in official explanations which  
have heen published to the world, and in a Corre«pondence o:  
the American Minister at London with the British Minister fo,  
Foreign Affairs, such a responsibility was explicitly and empha-  
tically disclaimed.  
  
It has become, indeed, sufficiently certain that the commerce  
of the United States is to be sacrificed, not as interfering with  
the belligerent rights of Great Britain—not as supplying the  
wants of their enemies, which she herself supplies—but as in-  
terfering with the monopoly which she covets for her own com.  
merce and navigation, She carries on a war against the law/u!  
commerce of a friend, that she may the better carry ona com-  
werce with an enemy,—a commerce polluted by the forgeries  
and perjuries which are for the most part the only passports by  
which it can succeed,  
  
Anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of  
injured nations, the Uniled States have withheld from Great  
Britain, under successive modifications, the benefits of a free  
intercourse with their market, the lass of which: could nat but  
outweigh the profits accruing from her restrictions of our com-  
merce with other nations, And to entitle those experiments to  
the more favourable consideration, they were se framed as to  
enable her to place her adversary under the exclasive operation  
of them. To these appeals her Government has been equally  
inflexible, as if willing to make sacrifices of every sort, rather  
than yield to the clhims of justice, or renounce the errors of 2  
false pride. Nay, so far were the attempts carried to overcome  
the attachment of the British Cabinet to its unjust edicts, that  
it received every encouragement, within the competency of the  
executive branch of our Government, to expect that a repeal of  
them would be fallowed by a war between the United States  
and France, unless the French edicts should also be repealed,  
Even this communication, although silencing for ever the plea  
of a disposition in the United States to acquiesce in those edicts,  
  
‘originally the sole’ plea for them, received noattention.  
  
If no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British  
Government against a repeal of its Orders, it might be found in  
the Correspondence of the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United  
States at London, and the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs,  
in 1810, on the question whether the blockade of May, 1806,  
was considered in force or not in force. It had been ascertained  
  
| that the French Government, which urged this blockade as the  
ground of its decree, was willing, in the event of its removal,  
to repeal that Decree; which being followed by alternate te-  
peals of the other offensive edicts, might abolish the whole  
system on both sides, This inviting opportanity for accom-  
plishing an object so impertant to the United States, and pro-  
fessed go often to be the desire of both ‘the belligeren&#x27;s, #4  
made known to the British Government. As that Goyero-  
ment admits that an actual application of an adequate force &#x27;s  
necessary tu the existence of a legal blockade, and it was n0-  
torious that if such a force had ever been applied, its }ong 4&#x27;s-  
continaance had annulled the blockade i. question, there could  
be no sufficient objection on the part of Great Britain to%  
formal revocation of it; ‘and no imaginable objection to a de  
claration of the fact that the blockade did pot exist. The  
declaration would have been consistent with her avowed prin-  
ciples of blockade, and would have enabled the United States  
to demand from France the pledged repeal of her Decrees  
either with suecess—in which case the way would have noe  
opened for a general repeal of the Belligerent Edicts; or ¥&quot;&#x27;  
out success—in which case the United States would have been  
justified in turning their measures exclusively agaiost F ee  
The British Government would, however, neither rescind  
Liockade, nor declare its ngn-existence, nor permit its pet

tenltary- ;  
comprehended in the :  
edso to regard it to their subsequent proceedings,  
  
as a period, when a favourable change in the po-  
tish Cabinet was justly considered as established.  
The Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty here  
  
roposed an adjustment of the differences more immediately  
endangering the frarmuby of the two countries, The proposi-  
tion was accepted with a promptitude and cordiality corre  
ponding with the invariable professions of this Government.  
4 foundation appeared to be laid for a sincere and lasting ré-  
conciliation. The prospect, however, quickly vanished. The  
whole proceeding -was disavowed hy the British Government,  
without any explanation whieh could at that time repress the  
belief, that the disavewal proceeded from a spirit of hostility  
wo the commercial rights and prosperity of the United States ;  
and it has since come into proof, that, at the very momegt  
ahea the public Minister was holding the language of friend-  
ship, and inspired confidence in the sincerity of the negociation  
wiih which he was charged, a secret Agent of his Government  
was employed in intrigues, having for their object a subver-  
sion of our Government, and a dismemberment of our happy  
Union. &#x27;  
  
{n reviewing the conduct of Great Britain towards the  
United States, our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare  
just renewed by the Savages on one of our extensive frontiers ;  
awarfare which is known to spare nefther age nor sex, and to  
be distinguished by featares particularly shocking to humanity.  
lt is didicult to account forthe activity and combinations which  
have for some time been developing themselves among the tribes  
in cunstant intercourse with British traders and garrisons, with-  
out coanecting their hostility with that influence; and without

enlightened nation, if less urged by moral obligations, or in-

would have found in its true interests alone a sufficient motive  
‘0 respect their rights and their tranquillity on the high seas ;  
that an enlarged policy would bave favoured the free and gene-  
rilcireulation of commerce, in which the British nation is at all  
times interested, and whicb in times of war is the best allevia-  
tion of its calamities to herself, as well as the other bellige-  
rents; and more especially, that the &quot;British Cabinet would  
oot, for the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse

rogative over British subjects. British ju-  
risdiction is thus extended to neutral vessels  
in a situation where no laws can operate  
but the law of nations and the laws of the  
country to which the vessels belong; and a  
self redress is assumed, which if British  
subjects were wrongfully detained and  
alone concerned, is that substitution of  
force for a resort to the responsible Sove-  
reign, which falls within the definition of  
war. Could the seizure of British subjects,  
in such cases, be regarded as within -the

mand the fairest trial, where the sacred  
rights of persons were at issue. In place  
of such trial, these rights are subjected to  
the will of every petty Commander.  
The practice, hence, is so far from affect-  
ing British subjects alone, that under the

Against this crying enormity, which Great  
Britain would be so prompt to avenge, if  
committed against herself, the United  
States have in vain exhausted remonstrances  
and expostulations. And that no proof  
might be wanting of their conciliatory dis-

ment was formally assured of the readiness  
of the United States to enter into arrange-

the recovery of the British subjects were  
the real and the sole object. The commu-  
nication passed without effect. British  
cruizers have been in the practice also of  
violating the rights and the peace of our  
coasts. They hover over and harass our  
entering and departing commerce. To the  
mest insulting pretensions they have added  
lawless proceedings in our very harbours,

hovering near her coasts, and disturbing  
her commerce, are well known. When  
called on, nevertheless, by the United  
States, to punish the greater offences com-  
mitted by her own vessels, her Government  
has bestowed on their commanders addi-  
tional marks of honour and confidence.  
Under pretended blockades, without the  
presence of an adequate force, and some-  
times without the practicability of applying  
one, our commerce has been plundered in  
every sea; the great staples of our country  
have been cut off from their legitimate mar-  
kets ; and a destructive blow aimed at our  
agricultural and maritime interests. In  
aggravation of these predatory measures,  
they have been considered as in force from  
the dates of their notification; a retrospec-  
tive effect being thus added, as has been  
done in other important cases, to the un-  
lawfulness of the course pursued.—And to  
render the outrage the more signal, these  
mock blockades have been reiterated and  
enforced in the face of official communica-  
tions from the British Government, de-  
claring, as the true definition of a legal  
blockade, ‘* that particular ports must be  
actually invested, and previous warning  
given to vessels bound to them not to enter.”’  
Not content with these occasional ex-  
pedients for laying waste our neutral trade,  
the Cabinet of Creat Britain resorted, at  
length, to the sweeping system of block-  
ades, under the name of Orders in Council,  
which has been moulded and managed as  
might best suit its political views, its com-  
mercial jealousies, or, the avidity of British  
cruizers. To our remonstrances against  
the complicated and transcendent injustice  
of this innovation, the first reply was that  
the orders were reluctantly adopted by  
Great Britain as a necessary retaliation on  
decrees of her enemy proclaiming a general  
blockade of the British Isles, at a time  
when the naval force of that enemy dared  
not to issue from his ports. She was re-  
minded without effect, that her own prior  
blockades, unsupported by an adequate  
naval force actually applied and continued,  
were a bar to this plea; that executed  
edicts against millions of our property could  
not be retaliation on edicts confessedly im-  
ossible to be executed ; that retaliation, to  
he just, should fall on the party setting the  
guilty example, not on an innocent party,  
which was not even chargeable with an  
acquiescence in it. When deprived of  
this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our  
trade with Great Britain, her Cabinet,

tical discontinuance of its orders, formally  
avowed a determination to persist in them  
against the United States, until the mar-  
kets of her enemy should be laid open to  
British products ; thus asserting an obliga.  
tion on a neutral power to require one bel-  
ligerent to encourage, by its internal regu.  
lations, the trade of another belligerent,  
contradicting her own practice towards al]  
nations in peace as well as in war; and be-  
traying the insincerity of those professions  
which inculcated a belief, that, having  
resorted to her orders with regret, she was  
anxious to find an occasion for putting an  
end to them. Abandoning still more all  
respect for the neutral rights of the United  
States, and for its own consistency, the  
British Government now demands as pre-  
requisites to a repeal of its Orders, as they  
relate to the United States, that a formality  
should be observed in the repeal of the  
French decrees no wise necessary to their  
termination, nor exemplified by British  
usage ; and that the French repeal, besides  
including that portion of the decrees which  
operates within a territorial jurisdiction as  
well as that which operates on the high  
seas against the commerce of the United  
States, should not be a single special repeal  
in relation to the United States, but should  
be extended to whatever other neutral na-  
tions uncounected with them may be al-  
fected by those decrees.———And as an ad-  
ditional insult, they are called on for a  
formal disavowal of conditions and _pre-  
tensions advanced by the French Govern-

far from having been themselves respon-  
sible, that, in official explanations, which

have withheld from Great Britain, under  
successive modifications, the benefits of a  
free intercourse with their market, the loss  
of which could not but outweigh the profits  
accruing from her restrictions of our com-  
merce with other nations. And to entitle  
those experiments to the more favourable  
consideration, they were so framed as to  
enable her to place her adversary under the  
exclusive operation of them. To these ap-  
peals her government has been equally in-  
flexible, as if willing to make sacrifices of  
every sort, rather than yield to the claims  
of justice, or renounce the errors of a false  
pride. Nay, so far were the attempts car-  
ried to overcome the attachment of the Bri-  
tish Cabinet to its unjust edicts, that it  
received every encouragement, within the  
competency of the executive branch of our  
government, to expect that a repeal of them  
would be followed by a war between the  
United States and France, unless the French  
edicts should also be repealed. Even this  
  
communication, although silencing for ever  
  
the plea of a disposition in the United  
States to acquiesce in those edicts, originally  
the sole plea for them, received no attention.  
If no other proof existed of a predeter-  
mination of the British Government against  
a repeal of its Orders, it might be found in  
the correspondence of the Minister Pleni-  
potentiary of the United States at London  
and the British Secretary for Foreign Af-  
fairs in 1810, on the question whether the  
blockade of May 1806 was considered as in  
force or as not in force. It had been ascer-  
tained that the French Government, which  
urged this blockade as the ground of its de-  
cree, was willing, in the event of its re-  
moval, to repeal that decree; which being  
followed by alternate repeals of the other  
offensive edicts, might abolish the whole  
System on both sides. This inviting oppor-  
tunity for accomplishing an object so im-  
portant to the United States, and professed  
So often to be the desire of both the bellige-  
rents, was made known to the British Go-  
vernment. As that Government admits  
  
  
  
_that an actual application of an adequate  
  
force is necessary to the existence of a legal  
blockade; and it was notorious, that if  
such a force had ever been applied, its long  
discontinuance had annulled the blockade  
in question, there could be no sufficient ob-  
jection on the part of Great Britain to a for-  
inal revocation of it; and no imaginable ob-  
jection to a declaration of the fact that the  
blockade did not exist. The declaration  
would have been consistent with her avow-  
ed principles of blockade, and would have

enabled the United States to demand from  
France the pledged repeal of her decrees ;  
either with success, in which case the way  
would have been opened for a general re-  
peal of the belligerent edicts; or without  
success, in which case the United States  
would have been justified in turning their  
measures exclusively against France. The  
British Government would, however, nei-  
ther rescind the blockade, nor declare its  
non-existence, nor permit its non-existence  
to be inferred and affirmed by the Ameri-  
can Plenipotentiary. On the contrary, by  
representing the blockade to be compre-  
hended in the Orders in Council, the  
United States were compelled so to regard  
it in their subsequent proceedings.  
There was a period when a favourable  
change in the policy of the British Cabinet  
was justly considered as established. The  
Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic  
Majesty here proposed an adjustment of the  
differences more immediately endangering  
the harmony of the two countries. The  
proposition was accepted with a prompti-  
tude and cordiality corresponding with the  
invariable professions of this Government.  
A foundation appeared to be laid for a sin-  
cere and lasting reconciliation. The pro-  
spect, however, quickly vanished. The  
whole proceeding was disavowed by the  
British Government, without any explana-  
tion which could at that time repress the  
belief, that the disavowal proceeded from a  
spirit of hostility to the commercial rights  
and prosperity of the United States. And  
it has since come into proof, that at the very  
moment when the public Minister was hold-  
ing the language of friendship, and inspired  
confidence in the sincerity of the negociation  
with which he was charged, a secret agent  
of his government was employed in in-  
trigues, having for their object a subversion  
of our Government, and a dismemberment  
of our happy union, In reviewing the  
conduct of Great Britain towards the United  
States, our attention is necessarily drawn  
to the warfare just renewed by the savages  
on one of our extensive frontiers ; a warfare  
which is known to spare neither age nor sex,  
and to be distinguished by features peculiarly  
shocking to humanity. It is difficult to ac-  
count for the activity and combinations  
which have for some time been developing  
themselves among the tribes in constant in-  
tercourse with the British traders and gar-  
risons, without connecting their hostility  
with that influence ; and without recollect-  
ing the authenticated examples of such in

I communicate to Congress docu-  
ments being a continuation of those  
heretofore laid before them, on the sub-  
ject of our affairs with Great Britain.  
Without going back beyond the re-  
newal in 1803 of the war in which G,  
Britain is engaged, and omitting unre-  
paired wrongs of inferior magnitude, the  
conduct of her government presents a  
series of acts hostile to the United Sta.  
tes as an independent ,and neutra! na-  
tion.  
  
British cruizers have been in the con  
tinued practice of violating the Ameri-  
ean flag on the great highway of nations,  
and of seizing and carrying off persons  
sailing under it ; not in the exercise of a  
belligerent right founded on the law of  
nations against an enemy, but of a mu-  
nicipal prerogative over British sub-  
jects. British jurisdiction is thus ex-  
tended to neutral vessels in a_ situation  
where no laws can operate but the Jaw of  
‘nations and the laws of the country to  
which the vessels belong ; and a self-re-  
dress is assumed, which, if British sub-  
jects were wrongfully detained &amp; alone  
concerned, is that substitution of force,  
for a resort to the responsible sovereign,  
which falls within the definition of war.  
Could the seizure of British subjects in  
such cases be regarded as within the  
exercise of a belligerent right, the ac-  
knowledged laws of war, which forbid  
an article of captured property to be ad  
judged without a regular. investigation  
  
fore a competent tribunal, would im  
periously demand the fairest trial, where  
the sacred&#x27;rights of persons were at is-  
sue. In place of such a trial, these rights  
are subjected to the will of every petty  
  
  
  
‘commander.  
  
The practice, hence, is so far from  
affecting British subjects alone, that, un-  
der the pretext of searching for these,  
thousands of American citizens, under  
  
jthe safe guard of public law, and of their  
  
xational tlag, have been torn from their  
country and every thing dear to them ;  
  
{have been dragged on board ships of  
  
war of a foreign nation, and exposed,  
under the severities of their discipline, to  
be exiled to the most distant &amp; deadly  
climes, to risk their lives in ‘the battles  
of their oppressors, and to be the me-  
lancholy instruments of taking away  
those of their own brethren.  
  
Against this crying enormity, which  
Great Britain would be so prompt to a-  
venge if committed aguzinst herself, the  
United States have in vain exhausted  
remonstrances and expostulation. And  
that no proof might be wanting of their  
conciliatory dispositions, and no pre-  
text left for a continuance of the practice,  
the British government was formally  
assured of the readiness of the United  
States to enter into arrangements, sucha  
as could not be rejected, if the recovery  
of British subjects were the real and the  
sole object. ‘The communication pass-  
ed without effect.  
  
British cruizers have been in the prac-  
tice also of violating the rights, and the  
peace of our coasts. ‘They hover over  
and harass our. departing commerce.—  
To the most insulting pretentsions the  
have added the most lawless eweneeit:  
ings in our very harbors; and have  
wantonly spilt American blood within  
the sanctuary of our territorial jurisdic-  
tion. ‘The principics and rules enforc-  
ed by that nation, wher a neutral na-  
tion, against armed vessels or bellige-  
rents hovering near her coasts, and dis.  
turbing her commerce, are well known.  
When called on, nevertheless, the Uni-  
ted States, to punish the greater offences  
committed by her own vessels, her go-  
vernment has bestowed on their com-  
mander additional marks of honor and  
confidence.  
  
Under pretended blockades, withou  
the presence of an adequate force, and  
sometimes without the practicability of  
applying one, our commerce has been  
plundered in every sea ;the great sta-  
ples of our country have been cut off  
from their legitimate markets ; and a  
destructive blow aimed at our agricultu-  
raland maritime interests. In aggra-  
vation of these predatory measures, they  
fiave been considered as in force from  
the dates oftheir notification ; a restros-  
  
ctive effect being thus added, as has  
sete done in other important cases, to  
the anlawfulness of the course pursued.  
And to render the outrage the more sig-  
  
  
  
nal, these mock blockades have beep  
  
eo -—_  
  
  
  
  
~ _  
  
™- ‘  
  
  
  
  
  
  
péiternted &amp; enforced in the face of offi-  
cial communications from the British  
government, declaring, as the true defi-  
nition of a legal blockade, *‘ that particu-  
lar ports must be actually invested, and  
previous warning given to vessels bound  
to them not to enter.”  
  
Not content with these occasional  
expedients for laying waste our neutral  
trade, the cabinet of Great Britain re-  
sorted at length, to the sweeping system  
of blockades, under the name of Orders  
in Council, which have been moulded &amp;  
managed as might best suit its political  
views, its commercial jealousies, or the  
avidity of British cruisers.  
  
To our remonstrances against this  
complicated and transcendent injustice  
of this innovation, the first reply was,  
that the orders were reluctantly adopted  
by Great Britain as a necessary retalia-  
tion on the decrees of her enemy pro  
claiming a general blockade of the Bri-  
tish isles, at atime when the naval force  
of that enemy dared not to issue from his  
own ports, Sheswas reminded, with-  
out effect, that her own prior block-  
ades, unsupported by an adequate naval  
force, actually applied and continued,  
were a bar to this plea ; that executed  
edicts against millions of our property  
could not be retaliatign on edicts, cory,  
fessedly impossible to be executed ; that  
retaliation, to be just, should fall on the  
party, setting the guilty example, not on  
an innocent party, which was not even  
cheargeable with an acquiescence in it.  
  
When deprived of this flimsy veil for  
a prohibition of our trade with her ene-  
my, by the repeal of his prohibition of our  
trade with Great Britain, her cabinet,  
instead of a corresponding repeal, or  
practical discontinuance of its orders,  
formally avowed a determination to per-  
sist in them against the United States,  
until the markets of her enemy should  
be laid open to British prodacts; thus  
asserting an obligation on a neutral pow-  
er to require one belligerent to encou-  
rage, by its internal regulations, the  
trade of another belligerent ; contradict-  
ing her own practice towards all na-  
tions, in peace as well asin war ; and  
betraying the insincerity of those pro-  
fessions which inculecated a belief that,  
having resorted to her orders with re-  
gret, she was.anxious to find an occasion  
for putting an end to them.  
  
Abandoning still more all respect for  
the neutral rights of the United States,  
and for its own consistency. the British  
government now demands as prerequi-  
sites to arcpeal of its orders, as they  
relate to the United States, that a forma-  
lity should be observed in the repeal of  
the French decrees nowise necessary to  
  
[3]  
  
British usage ; and that the French te-  
peal, besides including that portion of  
the decrees which operates within a ter-  
ritorial jurisdiction, as well as that which  
operates en the high seas against the  
commerce of the United States, should  
not be a single special repeal in relation  
to the United States, but should be ex-  
tended to whatever other neutral nations,  
uncennected with them, may be affect-  
ed by those decrees, And as an addi  
  
tional insult, they are called on for a for-  
mal disavowal of conditions and preten-  
tions advanced by the French govern-  
ment, for which the United States are  
so far from having made themselves  
responsible, that, in official explanations,  
which have been published to the world,  
&amp; in a corresdondence of the American  
minister at London with the British mi-  
nister for foreign. affairs, such a respon-  
sibility was explicitly and emphatically  
disclaimed,  
  
It has become indeed sufficiently cer-  
tain, that the commerce of the United  
States is to be sacrificed, not as interfer-  
ing with the belligerent rights of Great  
Britain—not as supplying the wants of  
her enemies, which she herself supplies ;  
but as interfering with the monopoly  
which she covets for her own commerce  
and navigation. She carries ona war  
against the lawful commerce of a friend,  
that sne may the better carry on a com-  
merce with an enemy—a commerce,  
polluted by the forgeries and perjuries  
which are for the most part the only pass-  
ports by wv hich it can succeed.  
  
Anxious to make every experiment  
short of the last resort of injured nations,  
the United States have withheld from  
Great Britain, under successive modi  
fications,the benefits of afree intercourse  
with their market, the loss of which  
could not but outweigh the profits ac-  
cruing from her restrictions of our com-  
merce with other nations. And to en-  
title these experiments to the more fa-  
vorable consideration, they were so fra-  
med as to enable her to place her adver  
sary under the exclusive operation of  
them. ‘To these appeals her govern-  
ment has been equally inflexible, as if  
willing to make sacrifices of every sort,  
rather than yield to the claims of justice,  
or renounce the errors of a false pride.  
Nay, so far were the attempts carried to  
overcome the attachment of the British  
cabinet to its unjust edicts, that it receiv-  
ed every encouragement within the com-  
petency of the executive branch of our  
government, to expect that a repeal of  
them would be followed by a war bet  
ween the United States and France,  
unless the French edicts should also be  
repealed. Even this communication, al-  
  
  
  
their termivation; nor exemplified by  
  
though silencing for eycr the plea of a  
  
disposition in the United States to at  
quiesce in those edicts, originally the.  
sole plea of them, received no attention.  
If no other proof existed of a predeter-  
mination of the British government a-  
ainst a repeal of its orders, it might be  
ound in the correspondence of the mi-  
nister plenipotentiary ofthe U. States  
at London, and the British secretary for  
foreign affairs, in 1810, on the question,  
whetherthe blockade of May, 1806, was  
considered as in force, or as not in force.  
It had been ascertained that the French  
government, which urged this blockade  
as the ground of its Berlin decree, was  
willing, in the event of its removal, to  
repeal that decree ; which, being follow-  
ed by alternate repeals of the other of-  
fensive edicts, might abolish the whole  
system on both sides. This inviting op-  
portunity for accomplishing an object so  
important to the U. States &amp; professed so  
often to be the desire of both the belli-  
gerents, was made known to the Bri-  
tish government. As that government  
admits that an actual application of an  
adequate force is necessary to the exis-  
tence of a legal blockade, and it was  
notorious, that if sucha force had ever  
been applied, its long continuance had  
annulled the blockade in question, there  
could be no sufficienf objection on the  
part of Great Britain to a formal revo-  
  
cation of it; and no umaginable objec-..  
  
tion to a declaration of the fact that the  
blockade did not exist. The declara-  
tion would have been consistent with  
her avowed priaciples of blockade, and  
would have enabled the United States to  
demand from France the pledged re-  
peal of her decrees ; either with suc  
cess, in which case the way would have  
been opened for a general repeal of the  
belligerent edicts; or without success,  
in which case the United States would  
be penne in turning their measures  
exclusively against France. The Bri-  
tish government would, however, nei-  
ther rescind the blockade, nor declare  
its non-existence ; nor permit its non-  
existence to be inferred and affirmed by  
the American plenipotentiary. On the  
contrary, by representing the blockade  
to be comprehended in the order in coun-  
cil, the United S. were compelled so to  
regard it in their subsequent proceed-  
ings.  
  
There was a period when a favora-  
ble change in the policy of the British  
cabintt, was justly considered as estab.  
lished. ‘The minister plenipotentiary of  
his Britannic majesty here proposed an

professions of this government. A foun-  
dation appeared to be laid for a sincere  
and lasting reconciliation. The pros-  
pect, however, quickly vanished. ‘The  
whuie proceeding was disavowed by  
the British government, without any ex-  
planations which could at that time re-  
press tie beliei, that the disavowal pro-  
ceeded from a spirit of hostility to the  
commercial rights and prosperity of the  
United States And it had since come  
into proof, thatat the very moment, when  
the public minister was holding the lan  
guage of friendship and inspiring confi-  
dence in the sincerity of the negociation  
with which he was charged,a secret a-  
gent of his government was employed in  
intrigues, having fur their object a sub-  
version of our government, and a dis  
memberment of our happy anion.  
  
In reviewing the conduct of Great  
Britain seieatile the United States, our  
attention is necessarily drawn to the  
warfare just renewed by the savages  
on our extensive frontiers ; a warfare  
which is known to spare neither age nor  
sex, and to be distinguished by features  
peculiarly shocking to humanity, It is dif-  
ficult to account for the activity &amp; com-  
binations which have for some time been  
developing themselves among tribes in  
the constant intercourse with British tra-  
ders and garrisons, without connecting  
their hostility with that influence ; and  
without recollecting the authenticated  
examples of such interpositions hereto-  
fore furnished by the officers and agents  
of that government.  
  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and  
indignities whiclt have been heaped on  
our country ; and such the crisis which  
Hs unexampled forbearance and conci-  
liatory efforts have not been able to a  
vert. It might at least have been ex-  
  
ected, that an-enhghtened nation, if  
  
ess urged by moral obligations, or invi-  
ted by friendly dispositions on the part  
of the United States, would have found,  
in its true interest alone, a sufficient mo-  
tive to respect their rights and their tran-  
quillity on the high seas; and that an  
  
enlarged policy would have favored that  
  
free and general circulation of com-  
  
merce, in which the British nation is at  
all times interested, and which, in times  
of war, is the best alleviation of its cala-  
mitiesto herself as wellas the other belli-  
gerents ; &amp; more especially that the Bri-  
tish cabinet would not, for the sake of a  
precarious and surreptitious, intercourse  
rsevered  
  
with hostile markets, have  
  
in a course of measures which necessa-  
  
rily put at hazard the invaluable market  
t &amp; grewing country, disposed:  
  
ofa  
  
to cultivate the mutual advantages of an  
active sommerce.  
  
Other coupcils have prevailed, Our  
  
  
  
[4]  
  
moderation and conciliation have had  
no other effect thanto encouraye erse-  
verance, and to enlarge pretentions —  
We behold our seafaring citizeiss, still  
the daily victims of lawless violence  
committed on the great common and  
highway of nations, even within sight  
of the country which owes tiem protec-  
tion. We behold our vessels, freigh-  
ted with the products of our soil and in-  
dustry, or retaruing with the honest  
roceeds of them, wrested from. their  
awful destinations, confiscated by prize-  
courts, no longer the organs of public  
law, but the instruments of arbitrary e-  
dicts ; and their unfortunate crews dis-  
persed and lost, or forced or inveigled,  
in British ports, into British fleets ;  
whilst arguments are employed in ‘sup-  
port of these aggressions which have no  
foundation but in a principle equally  
supporting a claim to regulute our ex-  
ternal commerce in all cases whatsoever.  
  
We behold, in fine, on the Side of G.  
Britain, a state of war against the U-  
nited States; ou the side of the U. States,  
a state of peace towards Great Britain,  
  
Whether the U. States shall continue  
passive under these progressive usurpa-  
tions,and these accumulating wrongs ;  
or, opposing force to force in defence of  
their nataral right, shall commit a just  
cause into the bands of the Almighty  
Disposer of events, avoiding all connec-  
tions which might faarceng. it in the  
contests or views of other powers, and  
  
reserving a constantreadiness to concur  
in an honorable re-establishment of peace  
and friendship, is a solemn question,  
which the constitution wisely confides  
to the legislative department of the go-  
vernment. In recommending it to their  
early deliberation, I am happy in the  
assurance that the decision will .be  
worthy the enlightened &amp; patriot-coun-  
cils of a virtuous, a free, and a powerful!  
nation.  
  
Having presented this view of the re.  
lations of the United States with Great  
Britain, and of the solemn alternative  
growing out ofthem, I proceed to re-  
mark, that the communication last made  
to congress on the subject of our relation  
with France, will have shown, that  
since the revocation of her decrees as  
they violated the neutral rights of the  
United States, her government has au-  
thorised illegal captures, by its priva-  
teers and ablic ships, and that other  
outrages haive been practised on our  
vessels and our citizens, It will have  
been seen also, that no indemnity had  
been provided, or satisfactorily pledged  
for the extensive spoliations committed  
under the violent and retrospective or-  
ders of the French government against  
the property of our eitiaeng seized with-  
  
  
  
te te at ase  
  
  
  
in the jurisdiction of France. I abstain  
at this time from recommending to the  
consideration of congress definitive mea-  
sures with respect to that nation, in the  
‘xpectation, that the result of unclosed  
discussions between our ministers ple.  
nipotentiary at Paris and the French go-  
vernment, will speedily enable congress  
to deeide, with greater advantage, on  
the course duc to the rights, the inte-  
rests, and the honor of our country.

ficers and agents of that Government.  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and indig-  
nities which have been heaped on our coun-  
try; atid such the crisis which its unex-  
ampled forbearance and conciliatory efforts  
have not been able to avert. It might at  
least have been expected, that an enlight-  
ened nation, if less urged by moral obliga-  
tions, or invited by friendly dispositions on  
the part of the United States, would have  
found in its true interests alone a sufficient  
motive to respect their rights and their  
‘tranquillity on the high seas; that an en-  
larged policy would have favoured the free  
and general circulation of commerce, in  
which the British nation is at all times in-  
terested, and which in times of war is the  
best alleviation of its calamities to herself,  
as well as the other belligerents; and more  
especially that the British Cabinet would  
not, for the sake of a precarious and sur-  
reptitious intercourse with hostile markets,  
have persevered in a course of measures  
which necessarily put at hazard the inva-  
luable market of a great and growing coun-  
try, disposed to cultivate the mutual advan-  
tages of an active commerce. Other  
councils have prevailed. Our moderation  
and conciliation have had no other effect  
than to encourage perseverance, and to en-  
large pretensions. We behold our sea-  
faring citizens still the daily victims of law-  
Jess violence committed on the great and  
common highway of nations, even within  
sight of the country which owes them pro-

I COMMUNICATE te Congress certain documents, being 2  
continuation of those heretofore laid before them, on the subject of  
our affairs with Great Britain.  
  
Without going back beyond the renewal in 1803, of the war in  
which Great Britain is engaged, and omitting unrepaired wrongs  
of inferior magnitude, the conduct of her government presents a  
series of acts, hostile to the United States as an independent and  
neutral nation.  
  
British cruizers have been in the continued practice of violating  
the American flag on the great high way of nations, and of seizing  
and carrying off persons sailing under it; not in the exercise of a  
belligerent right, founded on the Jaw of nations against an enemy,  
but of a municipal prerogative over British subjects. British  
jurisdiction is thus extended to neutral vessels, in a situation  
where no laws can operate but the law of nations, and the laws of  
the country to which the vessels belong; and a self redress is as-  
sumed, which, if British subjects were wrongfully detained and  
alone concerned, is that substitution of force, for a resort to the  
responsible sovereign, which falls within the definition of war.  
Could the seizure of British subjects, in such cases, be regarded  
as within the exercise of a belligerent righi, the acknowledged  
laws of war, which forbid an article of captured property to be  
adjudged, without a regular investigation before a competent tri-  
bunal, would imperiously demand the fairest trial, where the  
sacred rights of persons were at issue. In place of such a trial,  
these rights are subjected to the will of every petty commander.  
  
The practice, hence, is so far from affecting British subjects  
alone, that under the pretext of searching for these, thousands of  
American citizens, under the safeguard of public law, and of their  
national flag, have beeu torn from their country, and from every  
thing dear to them; have been dragged on board ships of war of a  
foreign nation, and exposed, under the severities of their discipline,  
to be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes, to risk their  
lives in the battles of their oppressors, and to be the melancholy  
instruments of taking away those of their own brethren.  
  
Against this crying enormity, which Great Britain would be so  
prompt to avenge if committed against herself, the United States

have in vain exhausted remonstrances, and expostulations; and  
that no proof might be wanting of their conciliatory dispositions,  
and no pretext left for a continuance of the practice, the British  
government was formally assured of the readiness of the United  
States to enter into arrangements, such as could not be rejected,  
if the recovery of British subjects were the real and the sole object.  
The communication passed without effect.  
  
British cruizers have been in the practice also of violating the  
rights and the peace of our coasts. They hover over and harass  
our entering and departing commerce. To the most insulting  
pretensions they have added the most lawless proceedings in our  
very harbors; and have wantonly spilt American blood within the  
sanctuary of our territorial jurisdiction. The principles and rules  
enforced by that nation when a neutral nation, against armed ves-  
sels of belligerents hovering near her coasts and disturbing her  
commerce, are well known. When called on, nevertheless, by the  
United States, to punish tk2 greater offences committed by her  
own vessels, her government has bestowed on their commanders  
additional marks of honor and confidence.  
  
Under pretended blockades, without the presence of an ade-  
quate force, and sometimes without the practicability of applying  
ene, our commerce has been plundered in every sea; the great  
staples of our country have been cut off from their legitimate  
markets; and a destructive blow aimed at our agricultural and  
maritime interests. In aggravation of these predatory measures,  
they have been considered as in force from the dates of their noti-  
fication; a retrospective effect being thus added, as has been done  
in other important cases, to the unlawfulness of the course pursue  
ed. And to render the outrage the more signal, these mock block-  
ades have been reiterated and enforced in the face of official com-  
munications from the British government, declaring, as the true  
definition of a legal blockade, “that particular ports must be  
actually invested, and previous warning given to vessels bound to  
them, not to enter.”  
  
Not content with these occasional expedients for laying waste  
our neutral trade, the cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at length,  
to the sweeping system of blockades, under the name of orders in  
council; which has been moulded and managed, as might best suit  
its political views, its commercial jealousies, or the avidity of  
British cruizers.  
  
To our remonstrances against the complicated and transcendant  
injustice of this innovation, the first reply was, that the orders were  
reluctantly adopted by Great Britain, as a necessary retaliation on  
decrees of her enemy, proclaiming a general blockade of the  
British isies, at a time when the naval force of that enemy dared  
not to issue from his own ports. She was reminded, without effect,  
that her own prior blockades, unsupported by an adequate naval  
force actually applied and continued, were a bar to this plea: that  
executed edicts against millions of our property could not be re-  
taliation on edicts, confessedly impossible to be executed: that

retaliation to be just, should fall on the party setting the guilty  
example, not on an innocent party, which was not even chargeable  
with an acquiescence in it.  
  
When deprived of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our trade  
with her enemy, by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with  
Great Britain, her cabinet instead of a corresponding repeal, or a  
practical discontinuance of its orders, formally avowed a determi-  
nation to persis in them against the United States, until the mar-  
kets of her enemy should be laid open to British products; thus,  
asserting an obligation on a neutral power to require one bellige-  
rent to encourage, by its internal regulations, the trade of another  
belligerent; contradicting her own practice towards all nations, in  
  
i peace as well as in war; and betraying the insincerity of those  
iy professions which inculcated a belief, that having resorted to her  
orders with regret, she was anxious to find an occasion for putting  
&amp; an end to them.  
pi Abandoning, still more, all respect for the neutral rights of the  
; United States, and for its own consistency, the British government  
4 now demands, as prerequisites to a repeal of its orders as they  
  
relate to the Unitea States, that a formality should be observed  
-§ in the repeal of the French decrees, no wise necessary to their  
i termination, nor exemplified by British usage; and that the French  
‘a repeal, besides including that portion of the decrees which operate  
within a territorial jurisdiction, as well as that which operates on  
the high seas, against the commerce of the United States, should  
P not be a single and special repeal in relation to the United States,  
{ but should be extended to whatever other neutral nations, uncon-  
. nected with them, may be affected by those decrees. And, as an  
ie additional insult, they are called on for a formal disavowal of con-  
A _ ditions and pretensions advanced by the French government, for  
fis which the United States are so far from having made themselves  
responsible, that in official explanations, which have been publish-  
ed to the world, and in a correspondence of the American Minis-  
ter at London with the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, such  
a responsibility was explicitly and emphatically disclaimed.  
It has become, indeed, sufficiently certain, that the commerce  
of the United States is to be sacrificed, not as interfering with  
} the belligerent rights of Grea! Britain; not as supplying the wants  
i of her enemies, which she herself supplies; but, as interfering  
with the monopoly which she covets for her own commerce and  
a navigation. She carries on a war against the lawful commerce of  
i a friend, that she may the better carry on a commerce with an  
‘* enemy; a commerce polluted by the forgeries and perjuries,  
which are, for the most part, the only passports by which it can  
  
succeed.  
Anxious to make every experiment, short of the last resort of  
  
injured nations, the United States have withheld from G:eat Bri-  
tain, under successive medifications, the benefits of a free inter-  
course with their market, the loss of which could not but outweigh

the profits accruing from her restrictions of our commerce with  
other nations. And to entitle these experiments to the more  
favorable consideration, they were so framed as to enable her to  
place her adversary under the exclusive operation of them. To  
these appeals her government has been equally inflexible, as if  
willing to make sacrifices of every sort, rather than yield to the  
claims of justice, or renounce the errors of a false pride. Nay, so  
far were the attempts carried to overcome the attachment of the  
British cabinet to its unjust edicts, that it received every encour-  
agement within the competency of the executive branch of out  
government, to expect that a repeal of them would be followed by  
a war between the United States and France, unless the French  
edict should also be repealed. Even this communication, although  
silencing for ever the plea of a disposition in the United States to  
acquiesce in those edicts, originally the sole plea for them, receiy-  
ed no attention.  
  
If no other proof existed of a predetermination of the British  
government against a repeal of its orders, it might be found in the  
correspondence of the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United  
States at London and the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs,  
in 1810, on the question whether the blockade of May, 1806, was  
considered as in force, or as not in force. It had been ascertained  
that the French government, which urged this blockade as the  
ground of its Berlin decree, was willing, in the event of its re-  
moval, to repeal that decree; which being followed by alternate  
repeals of the other offensive edicts, might abolish the whole sys-  
tem on both sides. This inviting opportunity for accomplishing  
an object so important to the United States, and professed so often  
to be the desire of both the belligerents, was made known to the  
British government. As that government admits that an actual  
application of an adequate force, is necessary to the existence of a  
legal blockade, and it was notorious, that if such a force had ever  
been applied, its long discontinuance had annulled the blockade  
in question, there could be no sufficient objection on the part of  
Great Britain to a formal revocation of it; and no imaginable  
objection to a declaration of the fact, that the blockade did  
not exist. The declaration would have been consistent with  
her avowed principles of blockade; and would have enabled the  
United States to demand from France the pledged repeal of  
her decrees; either with success, in which case the way would  
have been opened for a general repeal of the belligerent edicts;  
or without success, in which case the United States would  
have been justified in turning their measures exclusively against  
France. The British government would, however, neither rescind  
the blockade, nor declare its non existence; nor permit its non ex-  
istence to be inferred and affirmed by the American plenipoten-  
tiary. On the contrary, by representing the blockade to be compre-  
hended in the orders in council, the United States were compelled  
so to regard it, in their subsequent proceedings.

70 Appendix.—State Papers.  
  
There was a period when a favourable change in the policy of  
the British cabinet, was justly considered as established. The  
Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty here, proposed  
an adjustment of the differences more immediately endangering  
the harmony of the two countries. The proposition was accepted  
with the promptitude and cordiality, corresponding with the inva-  
riable professions of this government. A foundation appeared to be  
laid fora sincere and lasting reconciliation. The prospect, how-  
ever, quickly vanished. The whole proceeding was disavowed by  
the British government without any explanations, which could, at  
that time, repress the belief, that the disavowal proceeded from a  
spirit of hostility to the commercial rights and prosperity of the  
United States. And it has since come into proof that at the very  
moment, when the public minister was holding the language of  
friendship, and inspiring confidence in the sincerity of the nego-  
tiation with which he was charged, a secret agent of his govern-  
ment was employed in intrigues, having for their object, a sub-  
version of our government, anda dismemberment of our happy  
Union.  
  
In reviewing the conduct of Great Britain towards the United  
States, our attention is necessarily drawn to the warfare, just re-  
newed by the savages, on one of our extensive frontiers; a warfare,  
which is known to spare neither age nor sex, and tobe distin-  
guished by features peculiarly shocking to humanity. It is difficult  
to account for the activity and combinations which have for some  
time been developing themselves among tribes in constant inter-  
course with British traders and garrisons, without connecting their  
hostility with that influence, and without recollecting the authen-  
ticated examples of such interpositions, heretofore furnished by the  
officers and agents of that government.  
  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and indignities, which have  
been heaped on our country; and such the crisis which its unex-  
ampled forbearance and conciliatory efforts, have not been able to  
avert. It might, at least have been expected, that an enlightened  
nation, if less urged by moral obligations, or invited by friendly  
dispositions ov the part of the United States, would have found, in  
its true interest alone, a sufficient motive to respect their rights  
and their tranquillity on the high seas; that an enlarged policy  
would have favored that free and general circulation of commerce  
in which the Hritish nation is at all times interested, and which,  
in times of war, is the best alleviation of its calamities to herself,  
as well as to other belligerents; and, more especially, that the  
British cabinet, would not, for the sake ofa precarious and surrep-  
titious intercourse with hostile markets, have persevered in a  
course of measures, which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable  
market of a great and growing country, disposed to cultivate  
the mutual advantages of an active commerce.  
  
Other councils have prevailed. Our moderation and conciliation  
have had no other effect than to encourage perseverance and to

enlarge pretensions. We behold our seafaring citizens still the  
daily victims of lawless violence, committed on the great common  
and highway of nations, even within sight of the country which  
owes them protection. We behold our vessels, freighted with the  
products of our soil and industry, or returning with the honest  
proceeds of them, wrested from their lawful destinations, confis-  
cated by prize courts, no longer the organs of public law, but the  
instruments of arbitrary edicts; and their unfortunate crews dis-  
persed and lost, or forced or inveigled in British ports into British  
fleets; whilst arguments are employed, in support of these aggres-  
sions, which have no foundation but in a principle, equally sup-  
porting a claim to regulate our external commerce, in all cases  
whatsoever.  
  
We behold, in fine, on the side of Great Britain, a state of war  
against the United States; and on the side of the United. States, a  
state of peace towards Great Britain.  
  
Whether the United States shall continue passive under these  
progressive usurpations, and these accumulating wrongs; or, op-  
posing force to force in defence of their national rights, shall  
commit a just cause into the hands of the Almighty Disposer of  
events; avoiding all connections which might entangle it in the  
contests or views of other powers, and preserving a constant  
readiness to concur in an honorable re-establishment of peace and  
friendship, is a solemn question, which the constitution wisely  
confides to the legislative department of the government. In re-  
commending it-to their early deliberations, | am happy in the  
assurance, that the decision will be worthy the enlightened and  
patriotic councils of a virtuous, a free, and a powerful nation.  
  
Having presented this view of the relations of the United States  
with Great Britain, and of the solemn alternative growing out of  
them, I proceed to remark that the communications last made to  
Congress on the subject of our relations with France, will have  
shown, that since the revocation of her decrees, as they violated  
the neutral rights of the United States, her government has au-  
thorized illegal captures by its privateers and public ships; and  
that other outrages have been practised on our vessels and our  
citizens. It will have been seen, also, that no indemnity had been  
provided, or satisfactorily pledged, for the extensive spoliations,  
committed under the violent and retrospective orders of the French  
government against the property of our citizens, seized within the  
jurisdiction of France. I abstain, at this time, from recommend-  
ing to the consideration of Congress definitive measures with  
respect to that nation, in the expectation, that the result of unclos-  
ed discussions between our minister plenipotentiary at Paris and  
the French government, will speedily enable Congress to decide,  
with greater advantage, on the course due to the rights, the inter-  
  
ests, and the honor of our country.

real and the sole view. The communica­  
tion passed without effect.  
&quot; British Cruizers have been in the  
practice also of violating (he rights aid  
the peace o four Coasts. They hover over  
and harrass our entering and departing  
commerce. To the most insulting preci­  
sions they have added lawless proceedings  
in our very harbours ; and have wanton­  
ly spilt American blood within the sanc­  
tuary of territorial jurisdiction. The prin­  
ciples and rules enforced by that Nation,  
when a neutral nation, against armed ves­  
sels of Belligerents hovering near her  
coasts and disturbing her commerce, are  
well&#x27;known. When called on, neverthe­  
less, by the United States, to punish the  
greatest offences committed by her oyvu  
vessels, her Government has bestowed on  
their Commanders additional marksof hon­  
our and confidence.  
&quot; it has become indeed sufficiently cer­  
tain that the commerce of the United  
&quot; When deprived of this duns -y veil for  
a prohibition of our trade with Great  
Britain, her Cabinet, instead of a cor­  
responding repeal of a practical dis­  
continuance of its orders, formally avowed  
a determination (o persist in them against  
the United States, until the markets of her  
enemy should be laid open to British  
produce; thus asserting no obligation oh  
a neutral Power to require one Belligerent  
to encourage by its internal regulations the  
trade of another Belligerent; contradicting  
her own practice towards ail nations in  
peace as well as in war, and betraying the  
insincerity of those professions which  
inculcated a belief, that haring resorted to  
her orders with regret, she was anxious lo  
find an occasion fqr putting an endtothetn.  
&quot; Abandoning still more all respect for  
the neutral rights of the United States, and  
for its own consistency, the British Go­  
vernment now demands as free requisites  
to a repeal of its Orders as they relate to  
the United States, that a formality should  
be observed in the repeal of the French  
Decrees, no wise necessary to their ter­  
mination norexemplified by British usage;  
and that the French repeal, besides includ­  
ing that portion of the Decrees wh;ch  
operates wilhm a territorial jurisdiction,  
as well as that which operates on the high  
seas agatrlst the commerce of the United  
States, should not be a simple special re.  
peal in relation to the United States; but  
should be extended to whatever other neu­  
tral nations unconnected with them may  
be affected by those Decrees.  
&#x27;.&#x27; And as an additional insult they are  
called on fora formal disavowal of condi­  
tions and pretension advanced by the  
French Government, for which the United  
States are themselves so far from having&#x27;  
been reponsible, that, in official explana­  
tions which have been published to the  
World and in a correspondence of the  
American Minister at London, with tlie  
British Minister for foreign affairs, such  
a responsibility was explicitly and empha­  
tically disclaimed.  
&quot; To our remonstrances against the com*  
plicated and transcendent injustice of tins  
innovation, the first reply was that (he Or­  
ders were reluctantly adopted by Great  
Qritain as a necessary retaliation on decrees  
of her enemy proclaiming a general  
blockade of the British Isles, at a time  
when the naval forces of that enemy dared  
not issue from his own Forts. She was  
reminded without effect that her own prior  
blockades unsupported by an adequate  
naval force actually applied and continu­  
ed were a bar to this plea ; that execuied  
E-ucis against millions of our property  
cpuld not. be retaliation on Edicts con­  
fessedly impossible to be executed ; tnat  
retaliation to be just should fall on the  
party setting the guilty example, m&lt;t o.i  
an innocent party which was not even  
chargeable in an acquiescence to it.  
&quot; Not content with these occasional ex­  
pedients for laying waste puroeutral trade,  
the Cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at  
length to the sweeping system of Block­  
ades under the name ol Orders in Count il,  
which have been moulded and managed  
as might best suit its political views, its  
commercial jealousies or the avidity of  
British Cruizers.  
&quot; Under pretended blockades without,  
the presence of ah adequate force, and  
sometimes without the practicability of ap­  
plying one, pur commerce has been plun­  
dered in every sen, the great staph sol&#x27; our  
country have been cut oft&#x27;lrom iheir legi­  
timate markets, and a destructive biow  
aimed at our agricultural and maritime  
interests, In aggravation to these preda­  
tory measures, they have been considered  
as in force from the dates of their notifica­  
tion, a retrospective effect being thus added  
as has been done in other important, cases,  
to the unlawfulness ol&#x27;thecourse pursued.  
And lo render tlie on:rage more signal,  
these mock blockades have &#x27;een reiterated  
and enforced in ihe face ot&#x27;oifieia» commu­  
nications from the British Government de­  
claring, as (he true definition ofa blockade,  
&#x27; that particular Ports must be actually  
invested and previous warning given to  
vessels bound to them not to enter.&#x27;  
States is to be sacrificed not as interfering  
with the belligerent rights of Great Britain,  
not as supplying the wants of her enemies  
which, she herself supplies; but as  
interfering with the mouoply which she  
covets for her own commerce and  
navigation. She carries on a war against  
(he lawful commerce of a friend that she  
may the better carry on a commerce with  
an enemy, a commerce polluted by the  
forgeries and perjuries which are for the  
most pari the only passports by which it  
can succeed.

&quot; In reviewing the conduct of&#x27; Great  
Britain towards the United States, our  
attention is necessarily drawn to the war­  
fare just renewed by the Savages on one  
of our extensive frontiers; a warfare  
which is known to spare neither age nor  
sex, and to be distinguished by features  
peculiarly shocking fo humanity. It is  
difficult to account for the activity and  
combinations which have for some time  
been developing themselves among the  
tribes in constant intercourse with British  
traders and garrisons, without connecting  
&quot; Anxious to make every experiment  
short of the last resort of injured nations,  
the United States have withheld from  
Great Britain, under successive modifica­  
tions, the benefits of a free intercourse with  
their hostility with that influence; i  
without recollecting the authenticated ex­  
amples of such interpositions heretofore  
furnished by the officers and agents of that  
Government,  
their market, (he loss of which could not  
but outweigh the profits arising from her  
restrictions of our commerce with other  
nations. And to entitle those experiments  
1 o favourable consideration, they were  
framed so as to enable her to place her ad­  
versary under the exclusive operation of  
them. To these appeals her Government  
have been equally inflexible, as if willing  
to make sacrifices of every sort rather than  
yield to the claims of justice or renounce  
the errors ofa false pride. Nay, so far were  
the attempts carried to overcome the attach­  
ment ofthe British Cabinet to its unjust  
edicts, that it received every encourage­  
ment within the competency of the Ex­  
ecutive Branch of our Government, to ex­  
pect that a repeal of them would be  
followed by a war between the United States  
and&#x27; France, unless the French Edicts  
should also be repealed. Even this com­  
munication, although silencing forever the  
pica of a disposition in the United States, to  
acquiesce in those Edicts, originally the  
sole plea for them, received no attention.  
&quot; If no other proof existed of a prede­  
termination of the British Government  
&quot; Such is the spectacle of injuries anil  
indignities which have been heaped upon  
our Country ; and such the crisis which iis  
unexampled forbearance and conciliatory  
efforts have not been able to avert. It  
might at least have been expected, that an  
enlightened-nation, if less urged by moral  
obligations, or invited by friendly disposi­  
tions, on the part of the United States,  
would have found its true interests alone a  
sufficient motive to respect their rights and  
their tranquillity on the high seas; that an  
enlarged policy would have favoured the  
free and general circulation of commerce,  
in which the British nation is at all times  
interested, and which in times of war is  
the best alleviation of iis calamities to  
herself, as well as the other belligerents ;  
and more especially that the &quot; British  
Cabinet would not, for the sake of a  
precarious and surreptitious intercourse  
with hostile markets, have persevered in  
a course of measures which necessarily  
put at hazard the invaluable market of a  
great and growing country, disposed to  
cultivate the mutual advantages of an  
active Commerce.  
against a repeal of its.orderjs, it might be  
found iv the correspondence ofthe Minister  
Plenipotentiary ofthe United States, at  
London, and the British Secretary for For­  
eign Affairs in 1810, on their question,  
whether the blockade of May 1806, was  
considered as iv force or as not iv force.  
It had been ascertained that the French  
Government, which urged this blockade  
as the ground of its decree, was willing, in  
the event of its removal, to repeal that  
decree ; which being followed by alternate  
repeals, qfthe other offensive edicts, might  
abolish ihe whole system on both siiles.  
The inviting opportunity for accomplish­  
ing an object, so important to the United  
Sates, and protissed so often to be the  
desire of both the belligerents, was made  
known to the British Government. As  
that Government admits that an actual  
application of an adequate force is  
:, cessary to the existence of a legal  
blockade, aud it was notorious, I hat if  
such a force had ever been applied, its  
loilg discontinuance had annulled the  
blockade in question, there could be no  
sufficient objection on the part of Great  
Britain to a formal revocation of it; and  
no imaginable objection to a declaration of  
the fact that the blockade did not exist.  
Tin declaration would have been consistent  
with her avowed principles of blockade,  
and would have enabled the United States  
to demand from France the pledged repeal  
oi her decrees: either with success, in  
which case the way would have been  
opened for a general repeal of the belli­  
gerent edicts; or without success, in which  
case the United States would have  
been justified iv turning their measures  
exclusively against France. The British  
Government would, however, neither re­  
scind the blockade, nor declare its non-ex­  
istence, nor permit its nou-existence to  
&quot; Other Councils have prevailed. Our  
moderation and conciliation have had no  
other effect than to encourage preseverance,  
and to enlarge pretensions. We behold  
our seafaring citizens still the daily victims  
of lawless violence committed on the great  
and common highway of nations, even  
within sight df the Country which owes  
them protection. We behold our vessels,  
freighted with tha products of our soil and  
industry, or returning with the honest pro­  
ceeds of them, wrested from their lawful  
destination, confiscated by prize couris no­  
longer the organs of public law, but the in­  
strument of arbitrary edicts; and their  
unfortunate crews dispersed and lost, or  
forced or inveigled in British ports into  
British fleets, whilstarguments are employ­  
ed in support of these aggressions, which  
have no foundation but in a principle  
equally supporting a claim to regulate our  
external commerce in all cases whatsoever.  
We behold, in fine, on the side oi&#x27; Great  
Britain, a state of war against the United  
States; and on the side of the United States,  
a slate of peace towards Great Britain.  
&quot; Whether the United States shall con­  
tinue passive under these progressive usur­  
pations, and these accumulating wrongs;  
or, opposing force to force in defence of&quot;  
their natural rights, shall commit a just  
cause into the hands of the Almighty Dis­  
poser of events, avoiding all connections  
which might entangle it in the contests or  
views of other powers, and preserving a  
constant readiness to concur in an honoura­  
ble re-establishment of peace &amp; friendship,  
is a solemn question, which the constitu­  
tion wisely confides to the Legislati&#x27;-

Plenipotentiary. On the contrary, by  
representing the blockade to be com­  
prehended iv the Orders in Council, the  
United States were compelled so to regard  
il in their subsequent proceedings.  
** There was a period when a favourable  
change in the policy of the British Cabinet  
was justly considered as established. The  
Minister Plenipotentiary of His Britannic  
Majesty here, proposed au adjustment of  
the differences more immediately endan­  
gering the harmony of the two countires.  
The proposition was accepted with a  
promptitude and cordiality corresponding  
with the invariable professions of this Go­  
vernment. A foundation appeared to be  
laid fora sincere and lasting reconciliation.  
The prospect, however, quickly vanish­  
ed.—The whole proceeding was disavowed  
by the British Government, without any  
explanation which could at that time re­  
press the belief, that the disavowal pro­  
ceeded from a spirit of hostility to the  
Commercial rights and prosperity of the  
United Suites. And it hag since come into  
proof, that at the very moment when the  
public Minister was holding the language  
oi friendship) and inspired confidence in  
the sincerity ofthe negociation with which  
he was charged—a secret agent of his Go­  
vernment, was employed in. intrigues.; hav­  
ing for their object a subversion of our  
Government, and a dismemfeermeat of our  
tappy union.  
nation.  
&quot; Having presented this view of the  
relations of the United States with Great  
Britain, and of the solemn alternative  
growing out of them, I proceed toremark,  
that the communications last made te  
Congress on the subject of our relation&#x27;  
with Fiance, will have shewn that sine,  
the revocation of her Decrees, as they  
violated the neutral rights of the Uuitei&#x27;  
States, her Government has authorizes  
illegal captures by its privaleers and public  
ships, and that other outrages have been  
practised on our vessels aud our Citizens.  
It will have been seen also, that no  
indemnity had been provided, or satisfac­  
torily pledged, for the extensive spoliations  
committed under the violent and retros­  
pective order of the French Government  
against the property of our Cilizens, seiz­  
ed within the jurisdiction of France.  
I abstain at this time from recom­  
mending to the consideration of Congress  
definitive measures with respect to that  
nation, in the expectation that the result of  
unclosed discussions between our Minister  
Plenipotentiary at Paris and the French  
Government, will speedilyouable Congress  
to decide with greater advantage, on the  
course due to the rights, the interests, and  
Ihe honour of our country.

I communicate to congress certain docu¬  
ments, being a continuation of those hereto¬  
fore laid before them, on the subject of our  
affairs with Great Britain.  
  
Withput going back beyond the renewal  
in 1803, of the war in which Great Britain  
is engaged, and omitting unrepaired wrongs  
9f inferior magnitude, the conduct of her  
l^pyerimient preieats a series of acts hostile  
  
to the United States as an independent and  
neutral nation.  
  
British cruisers have been in the conti*  
nued practice of violating the Americaa  
fliig on the great high way of nations, and  
of seizing and carrying off persons dfeailing  
under it; not in the exercise of a belliger¬  
ent right founded on the law of nationi  
against an enemy, but of a municipal prero¬  
gative over British subjects. British juiii-  
dictiun is thus extended to neutral vessels in  
a situation where no laws can operate but  
the laws of nations and the laws of the  
country to which the vessels belong; and a  
self reilress is assumed which, if British sub¬  
jects were wrongfully detained are alone  
concerned, is that substitution of force, for  
a resort to the responsible sovereign, which  
falls within the definition of war. Could the  
seizure of British subjects in such cases be  
regarded as within the exer^e of belliger¬  
ent right, the acknowledged laws of war,  
which forbid an article of captured proper¬  
ty to be adjudged without a regular investi¬  
gation before a com[)elent tribunal, would  
imperiously demand the fairest trial where  
the sacred rights of persons were at issue.  
  
In place of such a trial, these rights are  
subjected to the vnIII of every petty com¬  
mander.  
  
The practice, hence, is so far from affect¬  
ing British subjects alone, that, under the  
pretext of searching for these, tliousands, of  
American citizens, under the safeguard of  
public law, and of their national flag, have  
been torn from their country arid from every  
thing dear to them; have been dragged on  
board ships of war of a foreign nation, and  
exposed, under the severities of their disci- ^  
pline, to be exiled to the most distant and i  
deadly climes, to risk their lives in the bat- j  
ties of their oppressors,&#x27; and be the me-  
lancholly instruments of taking away those  
of their ow n brethren.  
  
Against this crying enormity, which  
Great Britain would be so promfft fo avenge  
if committed against herself, the United  
States have in vain exhausted remonstran¬  
ces and expostulations. And that no proof  
might be wanting of their conciliatory dis¬  
positions, and no pretext left for a contiiiu-.  
ance of the practice, the British govern¬  
ment was formerly assured of the readiness  
of the United States to enter into arrange¬  
ments, such as could not be rejected, if the  
recovery of British subjects were the real  
and the sole object. The copimunication  
‘ passed without effect*  
  
TftlE EXAMINER.  
  
347  
  
British cruisers have been in the practice  
fliso of violalinfij the richts and the peace of  
our coasts. They hover over and harrass  
our entering and departing commerce. To  
the most insulting pretensions they have  
added the most lawless proceedings in our  
very harbors; and have wantonly spilt A-  
merican hloml within the sanctuary of our  
territorial jurisdiction. The principles and  
rules enforced hy that nation, when a neu¬  
tral nation, against armed vessels of hellige-  
rents hovering near her coasts, and disturb¬  
ing her commerce, are well known. When  
called on, nevertheless, by the United  
States to |)uuish the greater oflTeiices com¬  
mitted hy her own vessels, her government  
has bestowed on their commanders additi¬  
onal marks of honour and confidence.  
  
Under [)retentled blockades, without the  
presence of an adequate force, and some¬  
times without the practihility of applying  
one, our commerce has been plundered in  
every sea; the great staples of our country  
have been cut off fi*oin their legitimate  
markets; and a destructive blow aimed at  
our agricultural and maritime interests. In  
aggnvation of these pre&lt;lafory measures,  
they have been considere&lt;l as in force from  
the dates of their notihcation ; a retrospec¬  
tive effect being thus added, as has been  
d(uie in other important cases, to the unlaw¬  
fulness of the course pursued. And to ren¬  
der the outrage the more signal, these mock  
blockades have been reiterated and enforc¬  
ed in the face of otlicial communications  
from the British government, declaring, as  
the true definition of a legal blockade “ that  
particular ports must he actually invested,  
and previous warning given to vessels bound  
to them, not to enter.”  
  
Not content with these occasional expe¬  
dients for laying waste our neutral trade,  
the cabinet of Great Britain resorted, at  
length, to the sweeping system of blo&lt;!k-  
ades, under the name of orders in council,  
which has been moulded ami managed, a?  
&#x27;might best suit its political views, its com-  
meiadal Jealousies, or the avidity of British  
cruisers.  
  
To our remonstrances against the com¬  
plicated and transcendent injustice of this  
innovation, the first reply was, (hat the or¬  
ders were reluctantly adopted by Great  
Britain as a necessary retaliation on de¬  
crees of her enemy, proclaiming a genera]  
blockade of the British isles, at a time when  
the naval force of that enemy dared not to  
issue from his own ports. She was remind¬  
  
ed, without effect, that her own prior block¬  
ades, unsupported by an adequate naval  
force actually applied ami continued, were  
a bar to this plea; that executed eilicla  
against millions of our property could not  
be retaliation on edicts, confessedly impos¬  
sible to be executed; that, retaliation to be  
just, should fall on the party setting the  
guilty example, not on an innocent party,  
which was not even chargeable with an  
acquiescence in if.  
  
When deprived of this flimsy veil for a  
prohibition of our trade with her enemy,^  
hy the repeal of his jirohiliition of our tra&lt;le  
with Great Britain, her cabinet, instead of  
a corresponding repeal, or a practical dis¬  
continuance of its orders, formally avowed  
a determination to persist in them against  
the United States, until the markets of her  
enemy should be laiil open to British pro¬  
ducts; thus asserting an obligation on a  
neutral power to require one belligerent to  
encourage, by its internal regulations, the  
trade of another belligerent; contradicting  
her own practice towards all nations, in  
peace as well as in war; and betraying the  
insincerity of those professions which in  
cnicated a belief that, having resorted to  
her orders with regret, she was anxious to  
find an occasion for putting an end to them.  
  
Abandoning still more all respect for the  
neutral rights of the United States, and for  
its own consistency, the British govern¬  
ment now demands, as prerequisites to a  
repeal of its orders as they relate to the  
United States, that a formality should be  
observed in the re[)eal of the French de¬  
crees, no wise necessary to their termina¬  
tion, nor exemplified by British usage: and  
that the French repeal, besides including  
that portion of the decrees which operate  
within a territorial jurisdiction, as well as  
that which operates on the high seas against  
the commerce of the United States, should  
Tiot he a single special repeal in relation to  
the Unitetl States, hut should be extended  
to whatever other neutral nations uncon¬  
nected with them, may be affected by  
those decrees. And as an additional in¬  
sult, (hey are called on for a formal dis¬  
avowal of conditions and pretensions ad¬  
vanced by the French government, for  
w&#x27;hich the Unite&lt;l States are so far from  
having made themselves responsible, that,  
in official explanations, which have been  
published to the world, and in a correspon¬  
dence of the Americ a minister at London  
with the British minister for foreign affoir?.  
  
348 THE EXAMINER.  
  
such a responsibility was explicitly and em¬  
phatically disclaimed.  
  
It has become, indeed, sufficiently certain  
that the commerce of the United States is  
to be sacrihced, not as interfering with the  
belligerent rights of Great Britain, not as  
supplying the wants of her enemies, which  
she herself supplies, but as interfering with  
the monopoly which she covets for her own  
commerce, and navigation. She carries on  
a war against the lawful commerce of a  
friend, that she may the better carry on a  
commerce polluted by the foi^eries and per¬  
juries which are, for the most part, the only  
\ assports by which it can succeed.  
  
Anxious to make every experiment short  
of the last resort of injured nations, the  
United States have withheld from Great  
Britain, under successive modihcations, the  
benefits of a free intercourse with their  
market, the loss of which could not but out-  
w^eigh the profits accruing from her restric¬  
tions of our commerce with other nations.  
And to entitle these experiments to the  
more favourable consideration, they were so  
framed as to enable her to place her adversa¬  
ry under the exclusive operation of them.  
To these appeals her government has been  
equally indexible, as if willing to make sa¬  
crifices of every sort, rather than yield to  
the claims of justice or renounce the errors  
of a false pride. Nay, so far were the at¬  
tempts carried, to overcome the attachment  
of the British cabinet to its unjust edicts,  
that it received every encouragement with¬  
in the competency of the executive branch  
of our government, to expect that a repeal  
of them would be followed by a war be¬  
tween the United States and Prance, unless  
the French edicts should also be repealed.  
Even this communication, although silenc¬  
ing forever the plea of a disposition in the  
United States to acquiesce in those edicts  
originally the sole plea for them, received  
310 attention.  
  
If no other proof existed of a predetermi-  
3iation of the British government against a  
xepeal of its orders, it might be found on the  
correspondence of the minister plenipoten¬  
tiary of the United States at London, and  
the British secretary for foreign affairs in  
1810, on the question whether the blockade  
of May 1806, was considered as in force or  
as not in force. It had been ascertained  
that the French government, which urged  
this blockade as the ground of its Berlin de¬  
cree, was willing^.in the event of its remo¬  
val, to repeal that decree; which being fol¬  
lowed by alternate repeals of the other of.  
  
fensive edicts, might abolish the whole sfyi;-  
tem on both sides. This inviting op|)ortu-  
nity for accomplishing an object so import  
anf to the United States, and professed so  
often to be the desire of both the bellige¬  
rents, was made known to the British go¬  
vernment. As that government admits that  
an actual application of an adequate force,  
is necessary to the existence of a legal  
blockade and it was notorious, that if such a  
force had ever been applied, its long dis¬  
continuance had annulled the blockade in  
question, there could be no sufficient objec¬  
tion on the part of Great Britain to a formal  
revocation of it; and no imaginable objec¬  
tion, to a declaration of the fact, that the  
blockade did not exist. The declaration  
would have been consistent with her avow¬  
ed principles of blockade, and would have  
enabled the United States to demand from  
France, the pledged repeal of her decrees;  
either with success, in which cas* the way  
would have been opened for a general re¬  
peal of the belligerept pdicts; or without  
success, in which case the United States  
would have l)een justitied in turning their  
measures exclusively against Erance. The  
British government would, however, neither  
rescind the blockade nor declare its non¬  
existence •y nor permit its non-existence lo  
be inferred and affirmed by the American  
plenipotentiary. On the contrary, by re¬  
presenting the blockade to be comprehended  
in the orders in council, the United States  
were compelled so to regard it in their sub¬  
sequent proceedings.  
  
There was a periwl when a favorable  
change in the policy of the British cabinet,  
was justly considered as established. The  
minister plenif)oteiitiary of his Britannic  
majesty here proposed an adjustment of the  
differences more immediately endangering  
the harmony of the two countries. The  
proposition was accepted with a prompt! &lt;  
tude and cordiality corresponding with the  
invariable professions of this government.  
A foundation appeared to be laid for a sin¬  
cere and lasting reconciliation. The pros¬  
pect, however, quickly vanished. The  
whole proceeding was disavowed by the  
British government without any explana¬  
tions which could at that time repress the  
belief, that the disavowal proceeded from a  
spirit of hostility to the commercial rights  
and prosperity of the United States. And  
It has since come into proof, that at the ve¬  
ry moment, when the public minister was  
holding the language of friendship and in¬  
spiring confidence in the sincerity of the

Hegeclation with wliich he was charged, a  
secret agent of his government was employ¬  
ed in intrigues, having for their object a  
subversion of our government, and a dis¬  
memberment of our happy union.  
  
In reviewing the conduct of Great Bri¬  
tain towards the United States our attention  
is necessarily drawn to the warfare just re¬  
newed by the savages on one of our exten¬  
sive frontiers; a warfare which is known to  
spare neither age or sex, and to be distin¬  
guished by features peculiarly shocking to  
humanity. It is didicult to account for the  
activity and combinations which have for  
some time been developing themselves  
among: tribes in the constant intercourse  
with British traders and garrisons, without  
connecting their hostility with that influ¬  
ence ; aud without recollecting the authen¬  
ticated examples of such interpositions  
heretofore furnished by the officers and  
agents of that government.  
  
Such is the spectacle of injuries and indigni¬  
ties which have been heaped on our country :  
and such the crisis which its unexampled for¬  
bearance and conciliatory efforts have not been  
able to avert, ft might at least have been ex¬  
pected that an enlightened nation, if less urged  
by moral obligations, or invited by friendly dis¬  
positions on the part of the United States would |  
have found, in its tnie interest alone, a sufficient  
motive to respect their rights and their tran¬  
quility on the hi^h seas ; that an enlarged poli¬  
cy would have favoured that free and general  
circulation of commerce, in which the British  
nation is at all times interested, and which in  
times of war is the best alleviation of its cala¬  
mities to herself as well as the other beliige-  
rents; and more especially that the British ca¬  
binet would not, for the sake of the precarious  
and surreptitious intercourse with hostile mar¬  
kets, have persevered in a course of measures  
which necessarily put at hazard the invaluable  
market of a great and growing country, disposed  
to cultivate the mutual advantages of an active  
commerce.  
  
Other councils have prevailed. Our mode¬  
ration and conciliation have had no other effect  
than to encourage perseverance, and to enlarge  
pretensions. We behold our seafaring citizens  
still the daily victims of lawless violence com*  
mitted on the great common and highway of na-  
* tions, even within sight of tfic country which  
owes them protection. W^e behold our vessels  
freighted with the products of onrsoil and indus¬  
try, or returning with the honest proceeds of  
them, wrested from their lawful destinations,  
confiscated by prize courts, no longer the organs  
of public law, but the instruments of arbitrary  
edicts; and their unfortunate crews dispersed  
and lost, or forced or inveigled, in British  
ports, into British fleets; whilst arguments are  
employed in support of these aggressions, which  
have no foundation but in a priuciple equally  
  
supporting a claim to regulate, our external com¬  
merce in all cases whatsoever.  
  
We behold, in fine, on the side of Great Bri^  
tain a state of war against the United States;  
and on the side of the United States a state of  
peace towards Great Britain.  
  
Whether the United States shall continue pas¬  
sive under these progressive usurpations, and  
these accumulating wrongs ; or, opposing force  
to force in defence of their natural rights, shall  
commit a just cause into the hands of the Al-«  
mighty Disposer of events, avoiding all connec¬  
tions which ipight entangle it in the contests or  
views of other powers, and preserving a constant  
readiness to concur in an honourable re-establish¬  
ment of peace and friendship, is a solemn ques¬  
tion, which the constitution wisely confides to  
the legislative department of the government.  
In recommending it to their early delibera¬  
tions, 1 am happy in the asinranee that the de¬  
cision will be worthy the enlightened and pa¬  
triotic councils of a virtuous, a free, and a pow-t  
erflil nation.  
  
Having presented this view of the relations  
of the United States with Great Britain and of  
the solemn alternative growing out of th«&quot;m, I  
proceed to remark that the communications  
last made to coiigiCvSS on the subject of our rela¬  
tions with France will have sbowm that since the  
revocation of her decrees as they violated the  
neutral rights of the United States, her govern¬  
ment has authorised illegal captures, by its pri¬  
vateers and public ships, and that other outrages  
have been practised on our vessels and our citi¬  
zens. It will have been seen also, that no in¬  
demnity had been provided, or satisfactorily  
pledged for the extensive spoliations committed  
under the violent and retrospective orders of  
the Fi’ench government against the property of  
our citizens seized within the jiuisdictiou of  
France. I abstain at this time from recon-  
mending to the consideration of congress defini¬  
tive measures with respect to that nation, m  
the expectation that the result of iinclosefl dis¬  
cussions between our minister plenipotentiary  
at Paris and the French government will speedir  
ly enable congress to decide, with greater ad¬  
vantage, on the course due to the rights, the in¬  
terests, and the honour of our countrv.
