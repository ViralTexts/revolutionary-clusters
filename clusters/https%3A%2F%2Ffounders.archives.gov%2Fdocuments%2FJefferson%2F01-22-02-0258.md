reReport on Public Lands  
The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the President of the United States, the resolution of Congress requesting the President “to cause an estimate to be laid before Congress at their next session, of the quantity and situation of the lands not claimed by the Indians, nor granted to, nor claimed by, any citizens of the United States within the territory ceded to the United States by the state of North Carolina, and within the territory of the United States north west of the river Ohio,” makes thereon the following  
Report.  
  
The  
South-Western Territory.  
territory ceded by the State of North Carolina to the United States, by deed bearing date the 25th. day of February 1790, is bounded as follows, to wit: Beginning in the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina, that is to say, in the parallel of Latitude 36½ degrees north from the Equator, on the extreme height of the stone mountain, where the said boundary or parallel intersects it, and running thence along the said extreme height to the place where Wataugo river breaks through it; thence a direct course to the top of the yellow mountain, where Bright’s road crosses the same; thence along the ridge of the said mountain between the waters of Doe river and the waters of Rock creek, to the place where the road crosses the Iron mountain; from thence along the extreme height of said mountain to where Nolichuckey river runs through the same; thence to the top of the Bald mountain; thence along the extreme height of the said mountain to the painted rock on French Broad river; thence along the highest ridge of the said mountain to the place where it is called the Great Iron or Smoaky mountain; thence along the extreme height of the said mountain to the place where it is called Unaka mountain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of the said mountain to the southern boundary of the said State of North Carolina, that is to say, to the parallel of Latitude 35 degrees north from the Equator; thence westwardly along the said boundary or parallel to the middle of the river Missisippi; thence up the middle of the said river to where it is intersected by the first mentioned parallel of 36½ degrees; thence along the said parallel to the Beginning: which tract of country is a degree and a half of Latitude from North to South, and about 360 miles in general, from East to West, as nearly as maybe estimated from such maps as exist of that country.  
The  
Indian Claims.  
Indians having claims within the said tract of country, are, the Cherokees and Chickasaws, whose boundaries are settled by the treaties of Hopewell, concluded with the Cherokees on the 28th. day of November 1785, and with the Chickasaws, on the 10th. day of January 1786, and by the treaty of Holston concluded with the Cherokees, July 2d. 1791. These treaties acknowledge to the said Indians all the lands westward and southward of the following lines, to wit: Beginning in the boundary between South and North Carolina where the South Carolina Indian boundary strikes the same; thence North to a point from which a line is to be extended to the river Clinch, that shall pass the Holston at the ridge which divides the waters  running into Little river from those running into the Tannissee; thence up the river Clinch to Campbell’s line, and along the same to the top of the Cumberland mountain; thence in a direct course towards the Cumberland river, where the Kentucky road crosses it, as far as the Virginia line, or parallel aforesaid of 36½ degrees; thence Westwardly or Eastwardly, as the case shall be, along the said line or parallel, to the point thereof, which is due North East from another point to be taken on the dividing ridge of Cumberland and Duck rivers 40 miles from Nashville; thence Southwest to the point last mentioned on the said dividing ridge, and along the said dividing ridge northwestwardly to where it is intersected by the said Virginia line, or parallel of 36½ degrees. So that there remained to the United States the right of pre-emption of the lands westward and southward of the said lines, and the absolute right to those northward thereof, that is to say; to one parcel to the Eastward, somewhat triangular, comprehending the counties of Sullivan and Washington, and parts of those of Greene and Hawkins, running about 150 miles from East to West on the Virginia boundary as its base, and between 80 and 90 miles from north to South, where broadest and containing, as may be conjectured, without pretending to accuracy, between seven and eight thousand square miles, or about five millions of acres: and to one other parcel to the Westward, somewhat triangular also, comprehending parts of the counties of Sumner, Davidson, and Tannissee, the base whereof extends about 150 miles also from East to West on the same Virginia line, and its height from North to South about 55 miles, and so may comprehend about four thousand square miles, or upwards of two and a half millions of Acres of land.  
Within  
Claims of Citizens.  
these triangles, however, are the following claims of citizens reserved by the deed of cession, and consequently forming exception to the rights of the United States.  
i. Appropriations by the State of North Carolina for their Continental and State Officers and Soldiers.  
ii. Grants, and titles to grants vested in Individuals by the laws of the State.  
iii. Entries made in Armstrong’s office, under an Act of that State of 1783, for the redemption of specie and other Certificates.  
The  
Military Bounties.  
claims covered by the first reservation are, 1st. The bounties in land given by the said State of North Carolina to their continental line, in addition to those given by Congress: These were to be located  within a district bounded northwardly by the Virginia line, and southwardly by a line parallel thereto, and fifty five miles distant: Westwardly, by the Tannissee, and eastwardly by the meridian of the intersection of the Virginia line and Cumberland river. Grants have accordingly issued for 1,239,498 Acres, and warrants for the further quantity of 1,549,726 Acres, making together 2,789,224 Acres. It is to be noted, that the Southwestern and Southeastern Angles of this district, constituting, perhaps, a fourth or a fifth of the whole, are south of the lines established by the treaties of Hopewell and Holston, and, consequently in a country wherein the Indian title is acknowledged and guaranteed by the United States. No information is received of the exact proportion of the locations made within these angles.  
2nd. Bounties in Land to Evans’s battalion raised for State purposes: these were to be taken West of the Cumberland mountain. The locations are not yet made.  
The  
Entries and Grants.  
second reservation covers the following claims. 1st. Lands for the Surveyor General’s fees for laying out the military bounties, to be located in the military district. The grants already issued on this Account, amount to 30,203 Acres.  
2nd.  
Commissioners.  
Grants to Isaac Shelby, Anthony Bledsoe, and Absalom Tatum, commissioners for laying out the military bounties; and to guards, chain carriers, markers, and hunters, who attended them, already issued to the amount of 65,932 Acres, located in the Military district.  
3d.  
Washington County.  
Entries in Washington county, amounting to 746,362½ Acres, for 214,549¾ of which grants have already issued. Of the remaining 531,812¾ Acres, a considerable proportion were declared void by the laws of the State, and were particularly excluded from the cover of the reservation in the deed of cession by this clause in it, to wit: “Provided that nothing herein contained shall extend, or be construed to extend to the making good any entry or entries, or any grant or grants heretofore declared void by any Act or Acts of the General Assembly of this State.” Still it is to be considered, that many of these persons have settled and improved the lands, are willing, as is said, to comply with such conditions as shall be required of other purchasers, form a strong barrier on the new frontier acquired by the treaty of Holston, and are, therefore, Objects meriting the consideration of the Legislature.  
4th.  
Sullivan County.  
Entries in Sullivan county, amounting to 240,624 Acres, for 173,332 Acres of which grants have already  issued. Of the remaining entries, many are certified void; and others understood to be lapsed, or otherwise voidable, under the laws of the State.  
5th.  
Pre-emptions.  
Certain Pre-emption rights granted to the first settlers of Davidson county on Cumberland river, amounting to 309,760 Acres.  
6th.  
Henderson.  
A grant of 200,000 Acres to Richard Henderson and others on Powel’s and Clinch’s rivers, extending up Powel’s river in a breadth of not less than four miles, and down Clinch’s from their junction in a breadth not less than twelve miles. A great part of this is within the Indian territory.  
Among the grants of the State, now under recapitulation, as forming exceptions out of the absolute rights of the United States are not to be reckoned here two  
Martin &amp; Wilson.  
grants of 2000 Acres each to Alexander Martin, and David Wilson, adjacent to the lands allotted to the officers and soldiers; nor a grant of 25,000 Acres on   
General Greene.  
Duck river to the late Major General Greene; because they are wholly within the Indian territory, as acknowleged by the treaties of Hopewell and Holston.  
The  
Armstrong’s office.  
extent of the third reservation, in favor of entries made in Armstrong’s office, is not yet entirely known, nor can be ‘till the 20th. of December 1792, the last day given for perfecting them. The sum of certificates, however, which had been paid for these warrants into the Treasury of the State, before the 20th. day of May 1790, reaches in all probability, near to their whole amount. This was £373,649.6.5. Currency of that State, and at the price of ten pounds the hundred Acres, established by law, shews that Warrants had issued for 3,736,493 Acres. For 1,762,660 of these grants have passed, which appear to have been located partly in the counties of Greene and Hawkins, and partly in the country from thence to the Missisippi, as divided into Eastern, middle, and Western districts. Almost the whole of these locations are within the Indian territory. Besides the Warrants paid for as before mentioned, it is known that there are some others outstanding, and not paid for; but perhaps, these need not be taken into account, as payment of them has been disputed on the ground that the lands, being within the Indian territory, cannot now be delivered to the holders of the Warrants.  
On a review of all the reservations, after making such conjectural allowance as our information authorizes, for the proportion of them which may be within the Indian boundaries, it appears probable, that they cover all the ceded lands susceptible of culture, and cleared of the Indian title, that is to say; all the habitable  parts of the two triangles beforementioned, excepting only the lands south of French Broad and Big Pidgeon rivers. These were part of the tract appropriated by the laws of the State to the use of the Indians, whose title being purchased at the late treaty of Holston, they are now free to be disposed of by the United States, and are probably, the only lands open to their disposal within this South Western territory, which can excite the attention of purchasers. They are supposed to amount to about 300,000 Acres, and we are told that three hundred families have already set down upon them without right or license.  
The  
North Western territory.  
territory of the United States northwest of the Ohio, is bounded on the south by that river, on the East by Pennsylvania; on the north and West by the lines which divide the United States from the dominions of Great Britain and Spain.  
The  
Claims of Indians.  
part of this territory occupied by Indians, is north and West of the following lines established with the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippawas and Ottawas, by the treaty of Fort McIntosh, and, with the Shawanese, by that of the Great Miami, to wit: Beginning at the mouth of the Cayahoga, and running up the river to the Portage between that and the Tuscaroras branch of the Muskingum; then down the said branch to the forks at the crossing place above Fort Lawrence; then Westwardly towards the portage of the Big Miami, to the main branch of that river; then down the Miami to the fork of that river next below the old fort which was taken by the French in 1752; thence due West to the river de la Panse, and down that river to the Wabash. So far the lines are precisely defined, and the whole country Southward of these lines, and eastward of the Wabash, cleared of the claims of those Indians, as it is also of those of the Poutiwatimas and Sacs, by the treaty of Muskingum. How far on the other side of the Wabash, the Southern boundary of the Indians has been defined, we know not. It is only understood, in general, that their title to the lower country between that river and the Illinois, has been formerly extinguished by the French, while in their possession. As to that country then, and what lies still beyond the Illinois, it would seem expedient that nothing be done, ‘till a fair ascertainment of boundary can take place, by mutual consent between us and the Indians interested.  
The country within the Wabash, the Indian line before described, the Pennsylvania line, and the Ohio, contains, on a loose estimate, about 55,000 square miles, or 35 millions of Acres.  
  
During  
Antient Companies.  
the British government, great numbers of persons had formed themselves into companies, under different names, such as the Ohio, the Wabache, the Illinois, the Missisippi, or Vandalia companies, and had covered, with their applications, a great part of this territory. Some of them had obtained orders on certain conditions, which having never been fulfilled, their titles were never completed by grants. Others were only in a state of negociation, when the British authority was discontinued. Some of these claims, being already under a special reference, by order of Congress, and all of them probably falling under the operation of the same principles, they will not be noticed in the present report.  
The  
Claims of Citizens.  
Claims of citizens to be here stated, will be Ist. Those reserved by the States in their deeds of cession.  
iind. Those which have arisen under the government of the United States themselves.  
Under  
Connecticut.  
the first head presents itself the tract of country from the completion of the 41st. degree to 42°.2’ of North Latitude, and extending from the Pennsylvania line before mentioned 120 miles westward, not mentioned in the deed of Connecticut, while all the country westward thereof was mentioned to be ceded. About two and a half millions of Acres of this, may perhaps, be without the Indian lines beforementioned.  
2nd.  
French at Kaskaskias &amp;c.  
A reservation in the deed of Virginia of the possessions and titles of the French and Canadian Inhabitants, and other settlers of the Kaskaskias, St. Vincents, and the neighbouring Villages, who had professed themselves citizens of Virginia; which rights have been settled by an Act of the last session of Congress, intituled “An Act for granting lands to the Inhabitants and settlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country in the territory North-West of the Ohio, and for confirming them in their possessions.” These lands are in the neighbourhood of the several villages.  
3.  
Clarke’s Regiment.  
A reservation in the same deed of a quantity, not exceeding 150,000 Acres of land, for General George Rogers Clarke, and the officers and soldiers of his regiment, who were at the reduction of Kaskaskias, and St. Vincents: to be laid off, in such place on the North-West side of the Ohio, as a majority of the officers should choose. They chose they should be laid off on the river adjacent to the rapids, which, accordingly, has been done.  
4. A reservation in the same deed, of lands between the Scioto and Little Miami, to make up to the Virginia  troops,   
  
Virginia Line.  
on continental establishment, the quantity which the good lands in their Southern allotment, might fall short of the bounties given them by the laws of that State. By a statement of the 16th. of September, 1788, it appears that 724,045⅔ Acres had been surveyed for them on the South-eastern side of the Ohio; that 1,395,385½ Acres had been surveyed on the northwestern side; that Warrants for 649,649 Acres more, to be laid off on the same side of the river, were in the hands of the surveyor, and it was supposed there might still be some few warrants not yet presented: so that this reservation may be stated at 2,045,034½ Acres, or perhaps, some small matter more.  
ii. The claims of individual citizens, derived from the United States themselves, are the following.  
1.  
Continental Army.  
Those of the Continental army, founded on the resolutions of Congress, of September 16th. 1776, August 12th. and September 30th. 1780, and fixed by the Ordinance of May 20th. 1785; the resolution of October 22d. 1787, and the supplementary Ordinance of July 9th. 1788, in the seven ranges of townships; Beginning at a point on the Ohio, due north from the Western termination of a line then lately run as the Southern boundary of Pennsylvania: or, in a second tract of a million of Acres, bounded East by the seventh range of the said townships; south, by the lands of Cutler and Sargent; North, by an extension of the northern boundary of the said townships, and going towards the West so far as to include the above quantity: or lastly, in a third tract of country, Beginning at the mouth of the Ohio, and running up the Missisippi, to the river au Vause; thence up the same ‘till it meets a West line from the mouth of the little Wabash; thence along that line to the Great Wabash; thence down the same, and the Ohio to the Beginning. The sum total of the said military claims is 1,851,800 Acres.  
2.  
Purchasers at New-York.  
Those of the Individuals who made purchases of land at New York, within the said seven ranges of townships, according to the Resolutions of Congress of April 21st. 1787, and the supplementary ordinance of July 9th. 1788, which claims amount to 150,896 Acres.  
3. The purchase of one million and a half Acres of land by Cutler and Sargent, on behalf of certain individuals,   
  
Ohio Company.  
associated under the name of the Ohio company. This begins where the Ohio is intersected by the Western boundary of the seventh range of townships, and runs due North on that boundary 1306 chains and 25 links; thence due West to the Western  boundary of the seventeenth range of townships; thence due South to the Ohio, and up that river to the Beginning; the whole area containing 1,781,760 Acres of land, whereof 281,760 Acres, consisting of various lots and townships, are reserved to the United States.  
4: The purchase by the same Cutler and Sargent on behalf also of themselves and others. This begins at the   
  
Scioto Company.  
North-eastern angle of the tract of their purchase before described, and runs due north to the northern boundary of the tenth township from the Ohio; thence due West to the Scioto; thence down the same, and up the Ohio to the south-western angle of the said purchase before described, and along the Western and Northern boundaries thereof to the Beginning; the whole area containing 4,901,480 Acres of land; out of which, however, five lots, to wit: Nos: 8. 11. 16. 26. and 29. of every township, of six miles square, are retained by the United States, and out of the whole are retained the three townships of Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrun, and Salem, and certain lands around them, as will be hereafter mentioned.  
5.  
Symmes.  
The purchase of John Cleves Symmes, bounded on the West by the Great Miami; on the South by the Ohio; on the East by a line, which is to begin on the bank of the Ohio, twenty miles from the mouth of the Great Miami, as measured along the several courses of the Ohio, and to run parallel with the general course of the said Great Miami: and on the North by an East and West line, so run as to include a million of acres in the whole area, whereof five lots, numbered as beforementioned, are reserved out of every township by the United States.  
It is suggested that this purchaser, under colour of a first and larger proposition to the Board of Treasury which was never closed (but pending that proposition) sold sundry parcels of land, between his eastern boundary beforementioned, and the little Miami, and that the purchasers have settled thereon. If these suggestions prove true, the settlers will, perhaps, be thought to merit the favor of the Legislature, as purchasers for valuable consideration, and without notice of the defect of title.  
The contracts for lands, which were at one time under   
  
Flint &amp; Parker.  
consideration with Messieurs Flint and Parker, and   
Morgan.  
with Colonel Morgan, were never so far prosecuted as to bring either party under any obligation. All proceedings thereon were discontinued at a very early stage, and it is supposed that no further views exist with any party. These, therefore, are not to be enumerated among existing claims.  
  
6. Three townships were reserved by the Ordinance of May 20th. 1785, adjacent to Lake Erie, for refugees from   
  
Canadian Refugees.  
Canada and Nova Scotia, and for other purposes, according to resolutions of Congress made, or to be made on that subject. These would of course contain 69,120 Acres.  
7. The same Ordinance of May. 20th. 1785, appropriated the three towns of Gnadenhutten, Schoenbrun, and Salem on the Muskingum, for the Christian   
  
Christian Indians.  
Indians formerly settled there, or the remains of that society, with the grounds round about them, and the quantity of the said circumjacent grounds, for each of the said towns was determined by the resolution of Congress of September 3d. 1788, to be so much as, with the plat of it’s respective town, should make up 4,000 Acres; so that the three towns and their circumjacent lands were to amount to twelve thousand Acres. This reservation was accordingly made out of the larger purchase of Cutler and Sargent, which comprehended them. The Indians, however, for whom the reservation was made, have chosen to emigrate beyond the limits of the United States, so that the lands reserved for them still remain to the United States.  
on   
  
  
  
  
Connecticut about  
  
2,500,000  
  
  
Kaskaskians &amp;c. abt.  
  
100,000  
  
  
Clarke’s Regiment  
  
150,000  
  
  
Virginia Line  
  
2,045,034  
  
  
Continental Army  
  
1,851,300  
  
  
Purchasers at N. York  
  
150,896  
  
  
Ohio Company  
  
1,500,000  
  
  
Scioto Coy.31/36 of 4,901,480 …12,000  
}  
4,208,720  
  
  
  
Symmes  
  
1,000,000  
  
  
  
  
13,506,450  
  
  
  
  
35,000,000  
  
  
  
  
21,493,550  
  
  
the whole it appears that the United States may rightfully dispose of all the lands between the Wabash, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, the forty first parallel of Latitude, and the Indian lines described in the treaties of the great Miami and Fort McIntosh, with exceptions only of the rights saved by the deed of cession of Virginia, and of all rights legally derived from the Government of the United States, and supposing the parts south of the Indian lines to contain as before conjectured, about thirty five millions of Acres, and that the claims of citizens, before enumerated, may amount to between thirteen and fourteen millions, there remain at the disposal of the United States, upwards of twenty one millions of Acres in this Northwestern quarter.  
and ‘though the want of actual surveys of some parts, and of a general delineation of the whole on paper, so as to exhibit to the eye the locations, forms, and relative positions of the rights before described, may prevent our forming a well defined idea of them at this distance, yet, on the spot, these difficulties exist but in a small degree; the individuals there employed in the details of buying, selling, and locating, possess local informations of the parts which concern them, so as to be able to keep clear of each others rights: or if, in some instances, a conflict of claims should arise  from any Want of certainty in their definition, a local judge will doubtless be provided to decide them without delay, at least provisionally. Time, instead of clearing up these incertainties, will cloud them the more, by the death or removal of Witnesses, the disappearance of lines and marks, change of parties, and other casualties.

Still it is to be confideied, that many of thele  
ierfons have fettled and improved the lands, are  
vllling, as is laid to comply with lucli conditions  
iS ihall be required of other purchasers, form a  
hong barrier on the new frontier, acquired by

have already iffusd ; pr the remaining entries,  
many are certified void, and others understood  
:o be lapsed or otherwise voidable under the laws  
}f the state.  
5. Certain pre-emption rightsgranted to the  
?rft ftttleis of Davidfon countv, 0:1 Ciimber­

•fs than 4-miles, and down Clinch&#x27;s from their  
unflion in a breadth not less than 12 miles. A  
;reat part of this is within the Indian teriitory.  
Among the grants &lt;5f the fla&#x27;e now under re­  
:apitulation, as forming exceptions Out of the  
:bfolu:e lights of the United States, irt rrot to  
&gt;e reckoned here two grants of 2,000 acres each  
o Alexander Martin and David Wilfoii, adja­  
ent to the lands allotted to the officers and lol­  
liers ; nor a grant ol 25,000 acres on Duck river  
u the late Major General Greene ; because  
hey are wholly within the Indian territory, as  
ckno-vlcdged by the treaties of Hopewell and  
iolftod.  
The extent of the third reservation in favour  
if entries made in Armstrong&#x27;s office is not yes  
n*iro!y known, not can be t)U the soth-el I  
1795, the last day given for perfecting  
hem : the sum of certificates, however, which  
lad been paid for these warrants into the trea­  
sury ofthe state, before the 20th day of May  
1790, reaches in all probability near to their whole  
amount; this was /&quot; 373&gt;649-6 5&gt; currency of  
:hat State, and at the price of/. 10 the hundred  
icres eftablilbed by law, {hews that warrants had  
fl&#x27;ued for 3,736,493 acres; For 1,762,660 of  
?hefe, grants have palled, which appear to have  
seen located partly in thecoun ies of Greene and  
Hawkins, and partly in the country, from ihence  
to the Miffifippi as divided into Ealtern, Middle  
and Western diftrifts. Almost the whole of  
these locations are within the Indian territory—  
besides the warrants paid for as before mention­  
ed it is known that there aie some others out­  
standing and not paid for : but perhaps these  
need not be taken into account, as payment of  
them has been de puted on thr ground, that the  
lands being within the Indian territory, cannot  
now be a livered to the holders of the war  
rants.  
On a review of all the reservations, after mak­  
in fiich con &quot;eftural allowance as our information  
authorizes, for the proportion of them,which may  
be within the Indian boundaries, it appears pro­  
bable that they cover all the ceded lands suscep­  
tible of culture, and Ch-ated of the Indian t.tle,  
that is to fay, all the habitable parts of the two  
triangles beforementioned, excepting only the  
lands louth of French Broad, and 3ig Pigeon  
Rivets. Thele were part of the tract appropri­  
ated by-the laws of the state, to the use of the In­  
dians, whose title being purchased at the late  
treaty of Holfton, they are now free to be dif­  
uofed of by the United States, and are probably  
the only lands open to their disposal, within (hi:  
southwestern territory, which can excite the at­  
tention of purchasers. 1 hey are supposed to a­  
mount to about 300,000 acres, and we are told  
ihat 300 families have already set down upor  
them without right or license.  
The territory of the United States nortnwell  
of the Ohio, is bounded on the foufh by that ri­  
ver, on the east, by Pennsylvania, on the north  
and weft, bv the lines which divide the United  
States from the dominions of Great Britain and  
Sf&gt;Th&#x27;e part of this territory occupied by Indians,  
is north and well of the following lines, efta­  
-1 11flaed with the Wiandots, Delawares, Chippa­  
was and Ottawasby the treaty of Fort M&#x27;lntolh,  
andi with the Shawanefe, by that of the Great  
Miami, to wit; beginning at the mouth of the  
t avaho. a, and running up the river to the pou­  
a -e&#x27; between that and the Tufcaroras branch o!  
theMutkingum, then down the laid branch to  
the Forks, at the crofting place above Fort Law­  
cace then weltwardly, towaids the pottage ol  
  
Numb. 5  
  
the Big Miami, to the main branch of that river,  
then down the.Miaini to theFoikof that river,next  
below the old For ,which was taken by th; French  
in 1752 ; thence due weft to the river De la  
Pante, and iown that river to the VVabafh. So  
far the lines are precil&#x27;e.ly defined, and the whole  
country southward of these lines, and ea&#x27;tward ot  
the VVabafi. cleared of the claims oi thole Indi­  
ans, as it is also of those of the Pou iwatinias,  
and Sacs, by the treaty of MuOtingum. How­  
far on the other lide of the Wabalh, the southern  
boundary of the Indians has been defined, we  
know not. It is only understood in general,that  
theirtitle toih lower country, betweenthat river  
and (he Illinois, has been formerlv extinguiihed  
by the French, while ifi their poileflion. As to  
that countiy then, and what lies still Bevond the  
Illinois, it would seem expedient that nothing be  
done, till a fair afcenainmetit ot boundary can  
take place, bv mutual consent, between us and  
the Indiansinlereftcd.  
The country within the Wabafb, the Indian  
line before dcfcribed, the Pennfvlvania line,  
and the Ohio, contains, on a loose eflimate, a-  
Dout 55,000 square miles, or 35 millions of acres.  
During the British government, great numbers  
of perfonshad formedthemlelves intocompanies  
inder different names, such as the Ohio, the  
Wabache, the Illinois, the Mifiifippi, or Van­  
lalia companies, and had covered, with their  
ipplications, a great part of this territory. Some  
if them had obtained orders 011 certain conditi­  
ons, which, having never been fulfilled, their ti­  
les were never completed by-giants. Others  
tfere only in a state of negociation, when the Bii­  
ifli authoiity was discontinued; Some of these  
:laims being already Under a special reference by  
irder ofCongrefs, and all of them probably fat­  
ing, nnderthe operation of the fame principles,  
hey will not be itoticed in the present report.  
The ■claim&#x27;s if citizens o be-here ftaied Will be,  
1. Those refeived by the state.-. in their deeds  
i&gt;f ceflion.  
11. Those .which have arisen under the go­  
&#x27;ernmem of the United States themTelves.

2. A rcfervation in the deed of Virginia of  
the poiLfTions and titles of the French and Cana­  
dian inhabitants and other settlers of the Kutkaf­

Virginia, which rights have been fettled by an  
afct of the last fefiioii of Congress, intituled &quot;An  
ast for framing lands to the inhabitants and set­  
tlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country in the  
territory north weft of the Ohio, and for con­  
firming them in their pofTeffions.&quot; These lands  
are in the neighbourhood of the several villa­  
gers.  
g. A rcfervation in the fame deed of a qunn­

eduction of Kafkafkias, and St Vincents, to be

;he Ohio, as ama onty of the officers iboiud  
choose. Th 1 chose they Ihou&#x27;id be laid off 011

cordingly has been dene.  
4. A reservation, in the fame deed, of lands  
between the Siota and Little M.ami, to make up  
to the Virginia troops on continental establish­

southern allotment, might fall lhort of the boun­  
ties given them by the laws of that state. 3y a  
statement of the 16th of September 1788, it ap­  
pears that 724,045 2-3 acres had been fuiveyed  
for them on the south eafietn fide of the Ohio;  
that 1,395,385 1-3 acres had been furveved oil  
the north wefternlide ; that warrants for 649 649  
acres mOFe, to be laid off on the fame fide of the  
the river, were in the hands of the lurveyor, and  
it was supposed there might (till be some few  
warrants not yet presented ;so that \his reserv­

perhaps some small matter more.

fiv lots, to wit, Nos. 6, 26, and .1

tained by the United State&#x27;s, and out of the whol  
are retained the three townships of Gnadenhut  
ten, choenbrun, and alenr: and certain lane!  
around them, as will be hereafter mentioned.  
5. The purchase of ohn Cltves Symmes, boun  
ded on the weft by the Great Miami; on the foutl  
by the Ohio; on the east by a line which is to be  
gin on the bank of the Ohio, 20 miles from th  
mouth of the great fv iami, as measured along th  
several courfcs of the Ohio, and to run parallel  
with the general course of the said Great Iv iami

as to include a million of acres in the whole area  
whereof five lots, numbered as before mentioned  
are reserved out of every townftiip by the Unite&lt;  
States.  
It is suggested that this purchaser, under colou  
of a fir ft and larger proportion to the board o  
Treasury, which was never closed, (but pendinj  
that proposition) fcld funclry parcels of land, be  
tween his eastern boundary before mentioned, an*  
the Little i\ iami ; and that the purchasers hav  
fettled thereon. If these suggestions prove true  
the fettlcrs will, perhaps, be thought to merit th  
favor of the legifluture, as purchasers for valuabl&lt;  
confederation, ;j aud without notice of the defedl 0  
title.  
The contrasts for lands, which were at one tim*  
under confederation with MefTrs. Flint fetid Park  
er, and with Colonel Morgan, were never i&#x27; 6Fa  
prosecUted as to bring either party under any o&#x27;oli  
gation. All proceedings thereon were difcontinu  
cd at a very early ft: and it is supposed that n&lt;  
further views exist with any party, These, there  
fore, are not to be enumerated among exiftinj  
claims.  
6. Three townships were reserved by the ordi  
nance of May 20, 17 5 adjacent to Lake Erie, so  
refugees from Canada and Nov a Scotia, and so  
other pur poles, according to refolutinnsof Congress  
made or to be made on chat fubjctfl. , liefe vvouli  
of course contain 6 ,120 acres.  
7. The fame ordinance of ay 20th,r 785, appro  
priated the three towns of Gnadenhutten, Schoen  
brun, and Salem, on the Muikingum, for the chril  
tian inuians formerly fettled there, or the re  
mains of that society, with the grounds round a  
bout them, and the quantity of the said circum  
jact-nt grounds, for each of the said towns, &quot;wa  
determined by the resolution of Congre&#x27;s of Sep­  
tember 3d, 1 88, to be so much as, with the piai  
of its refpeilive town, ou&#x27;d make up 4000 a­  
cres ; i&#x27;o that the three towns and their circumja­  
cent lands were to amounfto 12,000 acres. Thu  
reservation was accordingly made out of the  
larger purchase of cutler and Sargent, which  
comprehended them. The Indians, however, for  
whom the reservation was made, have chosen  
to emigrate beyond the limits ef the United  
States, so that the lands reserved for them, still  
remain to the United States.  
On the whole, it appears that the United &#x27; tate«  
may rightfully difpoi&#x27;e of all the lands between the  
Vabafh, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, the forty-firfl  
parallel of latitude, and the ndian lines described  
in the treaties of the Great Miami, and Fort  
iw&#x27;.ntofh, with exceptions only of the rights saved  
by the deed of cefiion of Virginia, and of all rights  
legally derived from the government of the Uni­  
tes States,&quot; and the pait louch of the  
Indian lines, to contain as before conjectured a­  
bout 35 millions of acres, and that the claims ef  
citizens before enumerated may am to be­  
tween thiitfeen and fourteen millions there remaiil  
at the difpolal ot the United State:, upwards oj  
twenty-one millions of acres, in this north-western  
quarter.  
And though the want of actual surveys of fomc  
parts, and of a general delineation of the whol  
on paper, so as to exhibit to the eye the   
forms, and relative positions of the rights brfoH  
described, may prevent our forming a weil de­  
fined idea of them at this distance, yet, on the  
spot these dithculties exist but in a small degree i  
The individuals there employed in the details oj  
buying, felling, and locating, pofiefs local in  
formationsof the parts which concern them, so*?  
  
to be able to keep clearofeaih others rights; or  
fin some inflances a conflict of claims should a  
i iie, from any want of certainty in their definiti  
an, a local judge will doubtless be provided to de  
ide them without delay, at least provilionally  
Time, infiead of clearing up these incertainties  
will cloud them the more, by the death or remov  
al of vvitnelles, the disappearance of lines ant  
marks, change of parties, and other casualties,

to be laid before congrefs at their next feflion, of the quantity and fitwation of the  
lands not claimed by the Indians, nor granted to, nor claimed by any citizen of the  
united ftates, within the territory ceded to the united flates, by the ftate of North-  
Carolina, and within the territory of the united fates, north welt of the river Ohio,’  
makes thereon the following :  
  
R EP.OR T.  
  
The territory ceded by the flate of North-Garolina to the united flates, by  
deed bearing date the asth day of February 1790, is bounded as follows, to wit : Be-  
ginning in the boundary between Virginia and North-Carolina, that is to fay, in the  
parallel of latitude 36 1-2 degrees north from the equator, on the extreme height of  
the Stone mountain, where the faid boundary or parallel interfedts it, and running  
thence along the faid extreme height to the place where Wataugo river breaks  
through it ; thence a direct courfe to the top of the Yellow Mountain, where Bright&#x27;s  
road crofles the fame ; thence along the ridge of the faid mountain between the wa-  
ters of Doe River and the waters of Rock Creek, to the place where the road crofles  
the Iron Mountain ; from thence along the extreme height of faid mountain to  
where Nolichuckey River runs through the fame ; thence to the top of the Bald  
Mountain ; thence along the extreme height of the faid mountain to the painted  
rock, on French Broad River ; thence along the higheft ridge of the faid mountain,  
to the place where it is called the Great Iron or Smoaky Mountain ; thence along the  
extreme height of the faid mountain to the place where it is called Unaka Mountain,  
between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of  
the faid mountain, to the fouthern boundary of the faid ftate of North-Carolina,  
that is to fay, to the parallel of latitude 35 degrees north from the equator ; thence  
weltwardly along the {aid boundary or parallel to the middle of the river Miffifippi ;  
thence up the middle of the faid river to where it is interfeted by the firft mentioned  
parallel of 36 2-2 degrees; thence along the faid parallel to the beginning; which  
tract of country is a degree and a half of latitude from north to fouth, and about 366  
miles, in general, from eait to welt, as nearly as may be eftimated from fuch maps as  
exift of that country.  
  
The Indians having claims within the faid trac of country, are, the Cherokees and  
Chickafaws, whofe boundaries are fettled by the treatics of Hopewell, concluded with  
the Cherokees on the 28th day of Novembe: 1785, and with the Chickafaws, on the  
1oth day of January 1786, and by the treaty of Holfton, concluded with the Chero-  
kees, July ad, 1791. Thefe treaties acknowledge to the faid Indians all the lands  
weftward and fouthward of the following lines, to wit ; beginning in the boundary  
between South and North-Carelina, where the South-Carolina Indian boundary  
ttrikes the fame ; thence north to a point from which a line is to be extended to the  
river Clinch, that fhall pafs the Holiton, at the ridge which divides the waters runs  
ning into Little River from thofe running inte the Tanniffee ; thence up the river  
Clinch to Campbell’s Line, and along the fame to the top of the Cumberland Moun-  
tain ; thence in a dire&amp; courfe towards the Cumberland River, where the Kentucky  
road crofles it, as far as the Virginia line, or parallel aforclaid, of 36 1-2 degrees ;  
thence weltwardly, or eaftwardly, as the cafe fhall be, along the faid line or parallel  
to the point thereof, which is due north-caft from another point to be taken on the  
dividing ridge of Cumberland and Duck Rivers, 40 miles from Nafhville ; thence  
fouth-weift to the point laft mentioned, on the faid dividing Ridge, and along the faid  
dividing ridge north-weftwardly, to where it is interfected by the faid Virginia line,  
or parallel of 36 1-2 degrees. So that there remained to the united ftates, the right  
of pre-emption of the lands weRward and fouthward of the faid lines,and the abloiuie

aviat triangular, eomprehending the counties.of Sullivan and Wathington, and parts  
of thofe of Greene and Hawkins, running about 150 miles from eat to weit, on the  
Virginia boundary as its bafe, and between 80 and go miles from north to fouth,  
where broadett; and centaining, as may be conjectured, without pretending to ac.  
curacy, between feven and eight thaufand fquare miles, or about five millions of

hending parts of the counties of Sumner, Davidfon, and Tannifice, the bale whereof  
extends about 150 miles alfo, from eat to weft, on the fame Virginia line, and its  
height, from north to fouth, about 55 miles, and fo may comprehend about four thou-  
fand fquare miles, or upwards of two anda half millions of acres of land.  
  
Within thefe triangles, however, are the following claims of citizens, referved by  
the deed of ceflion, and confequently forming exceptions to the rights of the united  
ftates.  
  
1. Appropriations by the flate of North-Carolina, for their continental and flate  
officers and foldiers.  
  
il. Grants, and titles to grants, vefted in individuals by the laws of the ftate.  
  
Hl. Entries made in Armilrong’s office, under an aét of that flate, of 1783, for the  
redemption of fpecie and other certificates,  
  
The claims covered by the rf refervation are,  
  
1. The bounties in land given by the faid ftate of North-Carolina, to their can-  
tinental Jine, in addition to thofe given by congrefs ; thefe were to be located with-  
in a diftri€&amp; bounded northwardly by the Virginia line, and fouthwardly by a line  
parallel thereto, and 55 miles diftant ; weftwardly, by the Tanniffee, and caftward-  
ly by the meridian of the interfeétion of the Virginia line and Cumberland river  
Grants have accordingly iflued for 1,239,498 acres, and warrants for the further  
quantity of 1,549,726 acres, making together 2,789,224 acres.  
  
Ir is to be noted that the fouth-weftern and fouth-caftern angles of this diftria,  
conftituting perhaps a fourth or a fifth of the whole, are fouth of the lines efablihed  
by the treaties of Hopewell and Holiton, and confequently in a country wherein the  
Judian title is acknowledged and guaranteed by the united fates. No information is  
received of the exa&amp; proportion of the locations made within thefe angles,  
  
ad. Bounties in land to Evans’s battalion, raifed for ftate purpofes. Thefe were  
to be taken weit of the Cumberland Mountain. ‘The locations are not yet made,  
  
The ad refervation covers the following claims,  
  
r. Lands for thé furveyor-general’s fees for laying out the military bounties, to he  
Incated in the military diftrict. ‘T’he grants already iffued on this account amount to  
3 »203 acres.  
  
2. Grants to Ifaac Shelby, Anthony Bledfoe, and Abfalom ‘Tatam, commiflioners  
for laying out the military bounties ; and to guards, chain carriers, markers and hun-  
ters, who attended them, already ifiued to the amount of 65,932 acres, located in the  
niilitary diftria  
  
3. Entries in Waifhington county, amounting to 746,362 1-2 acres ; for 214,549  
3-4 of which grants have already ifflued. Of the remaining 531,812 3-4 acres, a con-  
fiderabie proportion were acclared void by the laws of the ftate, and were particue  
larly excluded from the cover of the refervation in the deed of ceflion, by this claufe  
in it, t- wit, Provided that nothing herein contained fhall extend, or be conftrucd to  
extend, to the making good any entry or entries, or any grant or grants, heretofore  
declared void, by any act or acts of the general aflembly of this ftate. Still it is to  
be confidered, that many of thefe perfons have fettled and improved the lands, are  
willing, as is faid, to comply with fuch conditions as fhall be required of other  
purchafers, form a flrong barrier on the new frontier, acquired by the treaty of Hol-  
fton, and are therefore oljccts meriting the confideration of the legiflature.  
  
4. Entries in Sullivan county, amounting to 240,624 acres; for 173,332 acres of  
which grants have already iflued ; of the remaining entries, many are certified void,  
and others underRood to be lapfed or otherwife voidable under the laws of the  
ftate.  
  
5. Certain pre-emption rights granted to the firft fettlers of Davidfon county, on  
Cumberland river, amounting to 309,760 acres.  
  
6. A grant of 200,00) acres to Richard Henderfon and others, on Powel’s and  
  
Clinch’s rivers, extending ap Powel’s river in a breadth of not lefs than 4 miles, and

down Clinch’s, frem their junction, in a breadth not lefs than 12 miles. A great part  
of this is within the Indian territory.  
  
Among the grants of the ftate now under recapitulation, as forming exceptions out  
of the abfolute rights of the united ttates, are not te be reckoned here two grants of  
acco acreseach to Alexander Martin and David Wilfon, adjacent to the lands al-  
otted to the officers and foldiers ; nor a grant of 25,000 acres on Duck river to the  
late major general Greene ; becaufe they are wholly within the Indian territory, 2%  
acknowledged by the treaties of Hopewell and Holfton,  
  
The extent of the 3d refervation, in favour of entries made in Armftrong’s office, is  
not yet entirely known, nor can be till the 20th of December 172, the laft day giv-  
en for perfecting them ; the fum of certificates, however, which had been paid for  
thefe warrants into the treafury of the ftate, before the 2oth day of May 1791, reaches  
in all probability near to their whole amount ; this was £.373,649-6-5 currency of  
that ftate, and at the price of rol. the hundred acres eftablifhed by law, thews that  
warrants had iffued for 3,736,493 acres; for 1,762,460 of thefe, grants have paffed,  
which appear to have been located partly im the counties of Greene and Hawkins, and  
partly in the country from thence to the Miflifippi, as divided into Eaftern, Middle  
aud Weftern diftri€ts. Almoft the whole of thefe locations are within the Indian  
territory---befides the warrants paid for as before mentioned, it is known that there  
are fome others outftanding and not paid for : but perhaps thefe need not be taken  
into account, as payment of them has been difputed on the greund, that the lands be-  
ing within the Indian territory, cannot now be delivered to the holders of the war-  
rants.  
  
On a review of all the refervations, after making fuch conjetural allowance as  
our information authorizes, for the proportion of them which may be within the In-  
dian boundaries, it appears probable that they cover all the ceded lands fufceptible of  
culture, and cleared of che Indian title, that is to fay, all the habitable parts of the two  
triangles beforementioned, excepting only the lands fouth of French Broad, and Big  
Pigeon rivers. Thefe were part of the tra appropriated by the laws of the fate,  
to the ufe of the Indians, whofe title being purchafed at the late treaty of Holfton,  
they are now free to be difpofed of by the united ftates, and are probably the only  
lands open to their difpofal, within this fouth-weftern territory, which can excite the  
attention of purchafers. They ar¢ fuppofed to amount to about 300,000 acres, and  
we are told that 300 families have already fat down upon them, without right or  
licenfe.  
  
The territory of the united ftates northweft of the Ohio, is bounded on the fouth by  
that river, on the eaft, by Pennfylvania, on the north and weft, by the lines which  
divide the united ftates from the dominions of Great-Britain and Spain.  
  
The part of this territory occupied by Indians, is north and weit of the following  
lines, eftablithed with the Wyandots, Delawares, Chippawas, and Ottawas by the  
treaty of Fort M‘intofh, and with the Shawanefe, by that of the Great Miami, to  
wit ; beginning at the mouth of the Cayahoga, and running up the river to the port-  
age, between that and the Tufcaroras branch of the Mufkingum, then down the faid  
branch to the Forks, at the crofling-place above Fort Lawrence, then weftwardly, to-  
wards the portage of the Big Miami, to the main branch of that river, then down the  
Miami to the Fork of that river next below the old Fort, which was taken by the  
French in 1752; thence due weit to the river de la Panfe, and down that river to  
the Wabath. So far the linesare precifely defined, and the whole country fouthward  
of thefe lines, and eaftward of the Wabath, cleared of the claims of thofe Indians, as  
it is alfo of thofe of the Poutiwatimas, and Sacs, by the treaty of Mutkingum. How  
far on the other fide of the Wabath, the fouthern boundary of the Indians has been de-  
fined, we know not, It is qnly underftood, in general, that their title to the lower  
country, between that river and the Illinois, has been formerly extinguithed by the  
French, while in their poffeffion. Asto that country then, and what lies beyond the  
Hlinois, it would feem expedient that nothing be done, till a fair afcertainment of  
boundary cap take place, by mutual confent, between us and the Indians interefted.  
  
_ The country within the Wabath, the Indian line before defcribed, the Pennfyiv2-  
nia line, and the Ohio, contains, on a loofe eftimate, about 55,000 fquare miles, or 35  
millions of acres.

the Mifliffppi, or Vandalia companies, and had covered, with their applications, 1 t  
art of thisterritory. Some of them had obtained orders on certain eenditions, which  
ving never been fulfilled, their titles were never completed by grants. Others  
were aly in a ftate of negociation, when the Britith authority was difcontioued,  
Some of thefe claims being already under a {pecial reference by order of congrefs,  
and all of theni probabiy falling under the operation of the fame principles, they will  
mot be noticed in the prefent report.  
  
The claims of citizens to be here ftated will be,  
  
1. Thofe referved by the flates in their deeds of ceffion :  
  
1. Thofe which have agifen under the government of the united fates them-  
felves.  
  
Under the firft head prefents itfelf the tra&amp; of country from the completion of the  
allt degree, to 42 degrecs 2 minutes of north latitude, and extending from the Penn-  
fylvania line beforementioned, 120 miles weftward, not mentioned in the deed of  
Connecticut, while all the country weitward thereof, was mentioned to be ceded :  
about two and a half millions of acres of this may perhaps be without the Indian  
lines beforementioned.  
  
2. A refervation in the deed of Virginia, of the poffeffions and titles of the French  
and Canadian inhabitants, and other fettlers of the Kafkafkias, St. ‘Vincents, and the  
neighbouring villages, who had profefled themfelves citizens of Virginia, which rights  
have been fettled by an act of the lait {eflion of congrefs, intituled “ An a@ for  
granting lands to the inhabitants and fettlers at Vincennes and the Illinois country in  
the territory north weit of the Ohio, and for confirming them in their poffeflions,”  
Thefe lands are in the neighbourhood of the feveral villages.  
  
3. A refervation, in the fame deed, of a quantity not exceeding 150,00¢ acres of  
land, for general George Rogers Clarke, and the officers and foldiers of his regiment  
who were at the reduction of Kafkatkias, and St. Vincents, to be laid eff in fuch place  
on the north weft fide of the Ohio, asa majority of the officers fhould chuofe. They  
chofe they fhould be laid off on the river adjacent to the rapids, which accordingly  
has been donc.  
  
4. A refervation, in the fame deed, of lands between the Sciota and Little Miami, to  
make up to the Virginia troops on continental eftablifhment, the quantity which the  
good lands, in their fouthern allotment, might fall thort of the bounties given them  
by the laws of that ftate. By a ftatement of the 16th of September 1788, it appears  
that 724,045 2-3 acres had been furveyed for them on the fouth eaftern fide of the  
Ohio; that 1,395,385 1-3 acres had been furveyed on the north weitern fide ; that  
warrants for 649,649 acres more, to be laid off on the fame fide of the river, were ia  
the hands of the furveyor, and it was fuppofed there might ftill be fome few war-  
rants not yet prefented; fo that this refervation may be flated at 2,045,034 I-3 acres,  
or perhaps fome {mall matter more.  
  
ll. The claims of individual citizens derived from the united Rates themfelves are  
the following :  
  
1. Thofe of the continental army, founded on the refolutions of congrefs of Septem-  
ber 16,1776, Auguft 12, and September 30, 1780, and fixed by the ordinance of  
May 20, 1785, the refolution et OGober 22,1787, and the fupplementary ordi-  
nance of July 9, 1788, in the feven ranges of townthips, beginning at a point on the  
Ohio, due north from the weftern termination of a line then lately run, as the fouthero  
boundary of Pennfylvania: of in a fecond tract of a million of acres, bounded eaft, by  
the 7th om of the faid townfhips,fouth by the lands of Cutler and Sargent, north,  
by an extention of the northern boundary of the faid townthips, and going towards  
the weit fo far as to include the above quantity; or laftly, in a third tract of country,  
beginning at the mouth of the Ohio, and running up the Miflifppi to the river Au  
Vaule, thence up the fame till it mects a weft line from the muath of the Little Wa-  
bath ; thence along that line to the Great Wabafh ; thence down the fame, and the  
Ohio, to the beginning. The fum total of the faid military claims is 1,351,800  
  
cres.  
y a. Thefe of the individuals who made purchafes of land at New-York, within the  
faid {even ranges of townfhips, according to the refulutions of congrefs of April at,  
3787, afd the fuppismentary ordinance of July 9, 1788, which claims amount to  
550,896 actes.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Political Regifler 425  
  
3. The purchafe of one million and a half acres of land by Cutler and Sargent, on  
behalf of certain individuals, affociated under the name of the Ohiv Company. This  
begins where the Ohio is interfected by the weltern boundary of the 7th range of  
townfhips, and runs due north on that boundary 1306 chains and’ a5 links; thence  
due weft to the weitern boundary of the 17th range of townthips ; thence due fouth  
to the Ohio, and up that river to the beginning : the whole area containing 1,733,760  
acres of land, whereof 281,760 acres, coniifling of various lots and townfhips, are re-  
ferved to the united ftates.  
  
4. The purchafe by the fame Cutler and Sargent on behalf alfo of themfelves and  
others. This begins at the north-caitern angle of the tract of their purchafe before  
defcribed, and runs due north to the northern boundary of the roth townfhip from the  
Ohio; thence due wett, to the Scioto ; thence down the fame, and up the Ohio tothe  
fouth-weftern angle of the faid purthafe before deferibed, and along the weftern and  
northern boundaries thereof to the beginning, the whole area containing 4,901,480  
acres of land, out of which, however, five lots to wit, Nos. 8, 11, 16, 26, and 29 of  
every townthip, of fix miles f{quare, are retained by the united fates, and out of the  
whole are retained the three townthips of Gnadenhutten, Shoenbrun, and Salem : and  
certain lands around them, as will be hereafter mentioned  
  
5. The purchafe of John Cleves Symmes, bounded on the weft by the Great Mi-  
ami; on the fouth by the Ohio, and on the eaft by a line whichis to begin on the bank ef  
the Ohio, 20 miles-from the mouth of the Great Miami, as meafured along the feve-  
ral courfes of the Ohio, and to run parallel with the general courfe of the faid Great  
Miami ; and on the north by an eaft and weit line, fo run as to include a million of  
acres in the whole area, whercof five lots, numbered as before mentioned, are referv-  
ed out of every townhhip by the united fates.  
  
It is fuggefted that this purchafer, under colour of a firft and larger propolition to  
the hoard of treafury, which was never clofed, (but pending that propofition) fold  
fundry parcels of land, between his eaftern bonndary before mentioned, and the Little  
Miami: and that the purchafers have fettled thereon, If thefe fuggeftions prove  
true, the fett‘ers will, perhaps, be thought to merit the favour of the legiflature, as  
purchafers for valuable confideration, and without notice of the defe&amp; of title.  
  
The contracts for lands, which were at one time under confideration with Mefsrs.  
Flint and Parker, and with col. Morgan, were never fo far profecuted as to bring  
either party under any obligation. All proceedings thereon were difcontinued at a  
very early ftage, and it is fuppofed that no further views exift with any party. Thefe  
therefore, are not to be enumerated among exifting claims.  
  
6. Three townthips were referved by the ordinance of May 20,1785, adjacent to  
Lake Erie, for refugees from Canada and Nova-Scotia, and for other purpoles, accord-  
ing to refolutions of congrefs, made or to be made, on that fubject. ‘Thefe would of  
courle contain 67,120 acres.  
  
7: ‘The fame ordinance of May 20th, 1785, appropriated the three towns of Gnad-  
enhutten, Schoenbrun, and Salem, on the Mufkingum, for the chriftian Indians for-  
merly fettled there, or the remains of that fociety, with the grounds round about  
them, and the quantity of the faid circumjacent grounds, for each of the faid towns,  
was determined by the refolution of congrefs of September 34, 1788, to be fo much as,  
with the plat of its ref{pective town, fhould make up 4000 acres ; fo that the three  
towns and their circumjacent lands were to amount to 12,000 acres. This referva-  
tion was accordingly made out of the larger purchafe of Cutler and Sargent, which  
comprehended theme. The Indians, however, for whom the refervation was made,  
have chofen to emigrate beyond the limits of the united ftates, fo that the lands re-  
ferved for them, {till remain to the united flates.  
  
On the whole, it appears that the united ftates may rightfully difpofe of all the  
lands between the Wabath, the Ohio, Pennfylvania, the forty-firlt parallel of laticude,  
and the Indian lines defcribed in the treaties of the Great Miami, and Fort M&#x27;Intofh,  
with exceptions only of the rights faved by the deed of ceflion of Virginia, and of ait  
Tights legally derived from the government of the united ftates, and fuppefing the  
part fouth of the {ndian lines to contain, as before conjectured, about 35 millions of  
acres, and that the claims of citizens before enumerated, may, amount to between  
thirteen and fourteen millions, there remain at the difpofal of the united fates up-  
wards of twenty-one millions of acres, in this north-wefterg quarter.

And though the want of actual furveys of fome parts, and of a general delineation  
of the whole on paper, fo as to exhibit to the eye the locations, forms, and relative po.  
fitions of the rights before defcribed, may prevent our forming a well defined idea of  
them at this diftance, yet, ou the {pot thefe difficulties exift but in a fmall degree. The  
individuals there employed in the details of buying, felling, and locating, poffefs local  
information of the parts which concern them, fo asto be able to keep clear of each  
others rights; or if in fome initances a conflict of claims fhould arife, from any want  
of certainty in their definition, a local judge will doubtlefs be provided to decide them  
without delay, at leat provifionally. ‘Time, inftead of clearing up thefe uncertain.  
ties, will cloud them the more, by the death or removal of witneffes, the difappear-  
ance of lines and marks, change of parties, and other cafualties.

The SECRETARY oT STATE, t® whom was referred by the  
PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, the Refol.nion of  
■ Cotlgrefs, requeuing the President •&#x27; to cause an estimate to be  
laid before Congress at their next foflion, of the Quantity and  
Situation of the Lands not claimed by the Indians, nor granted  
to, nor claimed by any Citizens of the United Slates, within the  
Territory ceded to the United States, by the State of North-Ca­  
rolina, and within the Territory of the United States, North­  
west of the River Ohio,&quot; makes thereon the following  
  
REPORT.  
THE territory ceded by the date of North-Carolina to the ti­  
nned States, by deed bearing date the 25th day of February,  
1790, is bounded as follows, to wit : Beginning in the boundary  
between Virginia and North-Carolina, that is to fay, in the paral­  
lel of latitude 36J degrees north from the equator, cn the extreme  
height of the Stone mountain, where the said boundary or paral­  
lel interfefts it, and running thence along the said extreme height  
to the place where Wataugo river breaks through it ; thence a di­  
rect course to the top of the Yellow Mountain, where Blight&#x27;s  
road erodes the fame ; thence along the ridge of the said moun­  
tain between the waters of Doe river and the waters of Rock  
creek, to the place where the road erodes the Iron Mountain­  
from thence along the extreme height of said mountain to where  
Nolichuckey r ver runs through the fame ; thence to the top of  
the Bald mountain ; thence along the extreme height of the said  
mountain to the painted rock, on French Broad river ; thence a­  
long the highest ridge of the said mountain, to the place where it  
is called the Great Iron or Smoaky mountain; thence alono- the  
extreme height of the said mountain to the place where it is called  
Unaka mountain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old  
Chota ; thence along the main ridge of the said mountain, to the  
southern boundary of the said state of North Carolina, that is to  
fay, to the parallell of latitude 35 degrees north from the equator ;  
thence weft wardly along the laid boundary or parallell, to the  
middle of the river Miffifippi ; thence up the middle of the said  
river to where it is interfered by the firft mentioned parallell of  
365 degrees; thence along the said parallell to the beginning:  
which tract of country is a degree and a half of latitude from north  
to south, and about 360 miles, in general, from east to weft, as  
nearly as may be estimated from iuch maps as exist of that coun­  
ty-  
  
The Indians havingclaims within the said tract of country, are,  
the Cheriikees and Chickafaws, whose boundaries are fettled by  
the treaties of Hopewell, concluded with the Cherokees on the  
28th djy of November, 1785, and with the Chickafaws, on the  
10th day of January, 1786, and by the treaty of Holfton, conclud­  
ed with the Cherokees, July 2d, 1791. These treaties acknow­  
ledge to the said Indians all the lands westward and southward of  
thefollnwing lines, to wit : beginning in the boundary between  
South and North-Carolina, where the South-Carolina Indian  
boundary flrikes the fame ; thence north to a point from which a  
line is to be extended to the rirer Clinch, that (hall pass the Hol­  
fton, at the ridge which divides the waters running into Little Ri­  
ver from those running into the Tenneftee ; thence up the river  
Clinch to Campbell&#x27;s line, and along the fame to the top of the  
Cumberland Mountain ; thence in a direst course towards the  
Camberland River, where the Kentucky road erodes it, as far as  
the Virginia line, or parallel! aforefaid, of degrees ; thence  
weftwardly, or eaftwardly, as the cafe (hall be, along the said line  
or parallell to the point thereof, which is due northeast from ano­  
ther point to be taken on the dividing ridge of Cumberland and  
Duck Rivers, 40 miles from Nashville ; thence south weft to the  
point 1a ft mentioned, on the fnid dividing ridge, and along the  
said dividing ridge north weftwardly, to where it is interfered  
by the said Virginia line, or parallell of degrees. So that  
there remained to the Unued States, the right of pre-emption of  
the lands westward and southward of the said lines, and the abso­  
lute right to thole northward thereof, that is to fay : to one parcel  
to the eastward, some what triangular, comprehending the coun­  
ties of Sullivan and Washington, and parts of those of Greene and  
Hawkins, running about 150 miles from east to weft, on the Vir­  
ginia boundary, as its base, and between 80 and 90 miles from  
to south, where broadest ; and containing, as may be con­  
j&quot;£hired, without pretending to accuracy, between seven and eight  
thousand square miles, or about five millions of acres : And to one  
other parcel to the westward, somewhat triangular also, compre­  
hending parts of the counties of Sumner, D jvidfon, and Term (fee,  
the hafe whereof extends about 150 miles also, from east to weft,  
on the fame Virginia line, and its height, from north to south, a­  
b°ut 55 miles, and so may comprehend abont four thousand  
square miles, or upward s of two and a half millions of acres of  
land.  
  
Within these triangles, however, are the following claims of  
citizens, reserved by the deed of ceflion, and confequentlp form­  
ing exceptions to the rights of the United States.  
I. Appropriations by the State of North-Carolina,for their con­  
tinental and state officers and soldiers.  
  
11. Grants and titles to grants vested in individuals by the laws  
• f the state.  
  
111. Entries made in Armstrong&#x27;s office, under an ast of that  
state, of 1783, for the redemption of specie and other certificates.  
The claims covered by the ill reservation are,  
ill. The bounties in land given by the said state of North-Ca­  
rolina, to their continental line, in addition to those given by  
Congress; these were to be located within a diftrifcl bounded  
northwardly by the Virginia line, and southwardly by a J:nepa-  
Jallell thereto, and 55 miles diflant. Weftwardly, by the Ttn­  
&quot;ellec, and eaftwardly by the meridian of the interfc&amp;ion of the  
Virginia line, and Cumberland River ; grants have accordingly  
ilTued for 1,239,498 acres, and warrants for the further quantity  
•&#x27; 1 &gt;549,726 acre*, making together 2,739,224 acres.  
It. is i&lt;&gt; be noted that the fouthweftein and southeastern angles  
this diftrift, rooftituriug perhaps a fourth or fifth of the whole,  
are south of the lines eftablilhed by the treaties of Hopewell and  
Hollfon, and consequently in a country wherein the Indian title  
acknowledged and guaranteed by the United States. No in­  
formation is received of the exact proportion of the locations made  
within these angles. .  
?d. Bounties in land to Evans&#x27;s battalion, raiTed for state pur­  
poses. These were to be taken weft of Cumberland Mountain  
I he locations are not yet made.  
she second reservation covers the following c&#x27;aims.  
1. Lands for the surveyor general&#x27;s fees tor laying out the mili­  
tary bounties, to be located in the military siftn6fc. The grants  
atready iffaed this account amount to 30,203 acres.  
  
J. Giants to Isaac Shelby, Anthony Bledfoe, and Abfaiom Ta­  
tum, commissioners for laying out the military bounties ; and to  
guards, chain carriers, markers, and huntei&#x27;3, who attended them,  
already issued to the amount of 65,932 acres, located in the mili­  
tary diftrifi.  
  
3. Entries in Washington county amounting to 746,362jacres ;  
for 214.546J of which grants have already issued. Ot the re­  
maining acres, a considerable proportion were declared  
»oid by the laws of the state, and were particularly excluded from  
the cover of the reservation in the deed of ceflion, by this clause  
in it, to wit—Provided, that nothing herein contained (hall ex­  
tend, or be construed to extend, to the making good any entrv or  
entries, or any grant or grants, heretofoie declared void, by any  
acl or afls of the general effembly of this slate. Still it is to be con­  
dertd, that many of thele pcrfons have fettled and improved the  
lands, are willing, as is said, to comply with such conditions as  
&#x27;&quot;all be reqired of other purchasers, form a strong barrier on the  
new frontier, acquired by the treaty of Holfton, and are, therefore,  
objects meriting the conlideration of the legislature.  
4. Entries in Sullivan county, amounting to 240,624 acres ; for  
&#x27;73&gt;332 acres of which grants have already issued ; o( the remain­  
ing entiies, many are certified void, and others understood to be  
lapsed, or otherwifevoidable under the laws of the state.  
  
5. Certain pre-emption rights, granted to the firft fettlersof Di­  
vidfon county, on Cumberland liver, amountingto 309,760 acres.  
6. A grant of 200,000 acres to Richard Henderfon, and others,  
on Powcl&#x27;i and Clinch&#x27;s rivers, extendiug up Po Wei&#x27;s river in a  
breadth ps not less than 4 miles, and down Clinch&#x27;s from their  
junction in a breadth not less than 12 miles. A great part of this  
is within the Indian territory.  
Among the grants of the state now under recapitulation,as form­  
ing exceptions out of the absolute rights of the United States, are  
not to be reckoned here two grants of 2,000 each to Alexander  
1 lartin and David Wilson, adjacent to the lands allotted to the  
officers and soldiers ; nor a grant of 25,000 acres on Duck river to  
the late Major General Greene; because they are wholly within  
the Indian territory, as acknowledged by the treaties of Hopewell  
and Holfton.  
  
The extent of the third reservation in favor of entries made in  
Armstrong&#x27;s office is not yet sntirely known, nor can be until the  
20th ot December, 1792, the last day given for them :  
the sum of certificates, however, which had been paid for thefewar­  
rants into the treasury of the ftate,before the 20th day of May, 1790,  
reaches, in all probability, near to their whole amount: this was  
373,6491. 6s. currency of that state, and at the price of lal. the  
hundred acres,eflabhlhed by law,(hews that warrant* had issued for  
3:736&gt;493 acres ; for 1,762,660 of these, grants have paffed,which  
appear to have been located partly in the counties of Greene and  
Hawkins, and partly in the country,from thence to the Miffifippi,  
as divided into Eastern, Middle and Wefterri diftri&amp;s. Almost  
the whole of these locations are within the Indian territory : be­  
sides the warrants paid for as before mentioned, it is known that  
there are some others outstanding and not paid ibr ; bun   
there riectf not E£ Wken tmir account, payment of them has  
been disputed on the ground, that the lands being within the In­  
dian territory, cannot now be delivered to the holders of the war­  
■&quot;ants.  
  
On a review of all the reservations, after making such conjectu­  
ral allowance as our information authorises, for the proportion&#x27;of  
them, which may be wiiliin the Indian boundaries, it appears pro­  
bable theycoverall the ceded lands fufceptibleof culture,and clear­  
ed of the Indian title, that is to fay, all the habitable parts of the two  
triangles beforementioned, excepting only the lands south of  
French Broad, and Big Pigeon rivers. These were part of the  
tra£t appropriated by the laws of the state to the use of the IndU  
ans, whose title being purchased et the late treaty of Holfton, they  
are now free to be disposed by the United States, and are proba­  
bly the only lands open to their disposal, within this southwestern  
territory, which can excite the attention of purchasers. They are  
supposed to amount to about 300,000 acres, and we are told that  
300 families have already set down upon them without right or  
licence. [remainder in our next.J

nPHE United States north-weft of the Ohio, is  
on the f.juth by that river, on the cast, by Penii- ,  
on the north and weft, by the lines which divide ..he ,  
United States from the dominions of Great-Britain and Spain.  
The part of this territory occupied by Indians, is north &lt;nd  
weft of the following lines, tlkablilhed with the Wiandots, De­  
laware?, Chippawa*, and On::was by the treaty of fort M&#x27;lntolh,  
and with tli&quot; Shawanefe, by that ot the Great JVliami, to wit : be­  
ginning at the mouth ot the Cayahoga, and running up the river  
to the portage, between that and the Tufcaroras branch of the  
Muflungurn, then down the said branch to the forks, at tlecrof­  
{\ng place above fort Lawrence, then weilwardiy, towards the  
portage of ihe Big Miami, to the main branch of that river,  
then down the Miatn&#x27; 10 the tork of that river next below the  
old fort, which was taken by the French in 1752 ; thence due  
veil to the river De la Panfe, und down thatriver to the Wabafh.  
Solar the lines are preciiely defined, and the whole countiy  
southward of these lines, and eallward of the Wabafh cleared ot  
the claim* of thole Indians, as it is also of those of the Poutiwati­  
jna*, and Sacs, by the treaty of Mutkingum. How far on the  
other fide of the Wabath, the fouihern boundary of the Indiana  
has been defined, we know not. It is only understood in gene­  
ral, that their title to the lower country, between that river and  
the Illinois, has been formeily extinguilhed by the French, while  
in their pofl ffion. As to that countiy then, and what lies Hill  
bevond the Illinois, it would leem expedient that nothing be­  
gone, until a fair afecrtainment of boundary can t3ke place, by  
mutual consent, between us and the Indians mteicfted.  
Tne country within the YVabafn, the Indian line before aef­  
cribed, the Pennfylvanian line, and the Ohio, contains, 011 a  
loose estimate, about 55,000 iouare miles, or 35 millions of  
  
acres,  
  
During the Biitifh government, gr&lt;°at numbers of persons had  
formed themselves in companies under different names, such a &amp;  
the Ohio, theWabafli, ihe Illinois, the Mifliiippi, or Vaudalia  
companies, and had covered with their applications, a great part  
of their territory. Some of them had obtained eiders on certain  
conditions, which, having never been fulfilled, their luits were  
never completed by grants. Oiheis were only in a state of mgo­  
ciation when the Biitifti authority was discontinued. Some of  
these claims being already under a special tcierencc by order of  
Congress, and all of them probably tailing under the operation of  
the lame principles, they will not be noticed in the present  
report.  
The elaims of citizens to be here stated will be,  
1. Those reserved to the States by their deeds of ceflion.  
11. Thole which have anien under the government of the  
United States themselves.  
Und«r the fir ft head presents itfelf the tract ot country from the  
completion of the 41ft degree, to 42 deg 2 min. of north latitude,  
and extending from the Pennlylvania line before mentioned, 120  
miles wtftward, not mentioned in the deed of Connecticut, while  
all the country westward thereof, was mentioned to be ceded ;  
about two and a half millions of acres of this may perhaps be  
wiihou: the Indian lines befoie mentioned.  
2. A refcivdtion in the deed ot Virginia, of the pofTefiions  
and titles of the French and Canadian inhabitants, and other  
fcttlersof the Kaflfcafkias, St. Vincennes, and the neighboring vil­  
lages, who had profeffed themselves citizens of Virginia, which  
rights have been fettled by an ast ot the last feflion of Congrels,  
entitled, &quot; An a£t for graining lands to the inhabitants and fu­  
llers ai Vincennes and the Illinois country, in the territory north­  
west of the Ohio, and for confirming them in their poflefiions.&quot;  
Thele lands are in the neighborhood of the fcveral villages.  
3 A refervution in the lame deed, of a quantity, not exceeding  
150,000 acres of land for General George Rogers Clarke, and  
the officers and soldiers of h:s regiment, who were at the reduc­  
tion ot Kaikaikias, and St. Vincennes, to be laid off in such place  
on the northwest fide ot the Ohio, as a majority of the orticers  
Ibouid choofThey chole they ihould be laid off on the river  
adjacent to the rapids, which accordingly has been done.  
4. A refervauon in the fame deed, ot lands between the Sciota  
and Little Miami, to make up to the Virginia troops on conti­  
nental establishment, the quantity which the good lands, in their  
southern allotment, might tall Ihort of the bounties given them by  
the laws ot that Slate. By a statement ot the i6h Sept. 1788, it  
appears, that 724,045 acres had been furveytd tor them on ihe  
south eaftcrn fide of the Ohio; that 1 acres had been  
farv.vedon the northweitern fide; th,jt warrants lor 649,649  
acre* more, to be laid off on the fame fide of the river, were in  
tbe flands of the furvcyor, and it was supposed there might iiill be  
iome tew warrants not yet piefented ; io that this refervauon may  
Deflated ai 2,045,034 £ acies ur perhaps some Imall matter  
more.  
  
If. The claims of individual citizens, derived from the United  
States thcmleives, are the following :  
1. Thole of the continental army, founded on the resolutions of  
Congrelsof Sept. 16, 1776, August 12, and Sept. 30, 1780, and  
fix».d by the ordinance of May 20, 1785. The resolution of  
O&amp;ober 22, 1787, and tl»e fupplenaentary ordinance of July 9,  
3788, in the feveu ranges of townlhips, beginning at a point on  
the Ohio, due north from the western termination of a line then  
lately run, as the southern boundaiy of Pennsylvania : 01 in a fc­  
cond trad of a million ol acres, bounded eaii, by the 7 h range  
of the laid townlhips, fouih by }he lands ot Cutler and Sargent ;  
*orth, by an extension of the northern boundary ot the said town­  
&amp;»ps ; and going towards the weft io far as to include the above  
quantity, or, lastly, in a third tra&amp; of country, beginningat the  
mouth ot the Ohio, and running up the river Miffifxppi to the ri­  
ver An Vaule, thence up the lame till it meets a welt line from the  
mouth of the little Wabalh ; thence along that line to ttie Great  
Wabafh ; thence down the fame and the Ohio, to the beginning.  
The ftim iota! of the said military claims i* 1,851,800 acres.  
2. Those of the individuals who mads pgrchafes of land a..  
New-York, wi:hin the laid fevco rangetof townships, according  
to the resolutions of Congrek ot Apnl 2tft, 1787, and the i &lt;p­  
p»ernentary Ordinance ot July 9, 1788, which claims amount tc  
acres.  
3. Tlie purchase of one million and a half acres of land by Cut­  
ler ai»d Sargent, on behalf of certain individuals, aflociatrd under  
name ol the Ohio Company. This begins w here the Ohio is  
interfered by the weflcrn boundary of the 7th range ol town­  
ftipy, and runs due nonh oil thai boundary 1306 chains and 25  
Ji&amp;ks ; thence due Weft to the western boundaryof the 17th range  
w» townfiitps ; thence due south to the Ohio, and up that nvi  
to the beginning; the whole area containing 1:781,760 acres &amp;•  
  
December 17, 170 1.  
  
R T,  
  
l*nd, whereof 281,760 acres, contifting of various lots and town-  
Ihips, are teferved to the United States.  
  
4. The purchase by the fame Cutler and Sargent on&#x27;behalf also  
of themselves and_others ; This begins at the tiortheaftem angle  
oft oTtheir purchase before described, and runs due north  
-ttTthe northern boundary of the 10th townlhip from the Ohio ;  
rhene&lt;? due weft, to the Scioto; thence down the fame, and up the  
Ohio 10 Ihe South western angle of the said purchase before dcfcr.-  
bed, and along the wefterp and northern boundaries thereof to  
the beginning ; the whole area containing 4,901,480 acres of  
land, out of which, however, five lots, to wit, No. 8, 11, 16, 26,  
and 29 q.t every township, of fix miles square, are retained by the  
United States, and out of the whole are retained the three town-,  
(hips of Gna enhuuen, Schoenbrun, and Salem ; and certain  
lci;os aroumi them, as will be hereafter mentioned.  
  
5. The purchairof JohnCI eves Symmes, bounded on the weft  
by the G»eat Miami; en the south by the Ohio; on the eafl  
by a line which is to bgin on the bank of the Ohio, 20 miles  
from the mouth of the great Miami, as measured along the fev ral  
couifes of the O&#x27;iio, and to run parallel with the general courfeof  
the laid Great Miami ; and on the north by an eait and weft liner,  
10 lun as io include a mil! on of acres in &#x27;he whole area, whereof  
live lots, numbered as before mentioned, aie reserved out of eve­  
ry townllnp by the United States.  
  
  
It is fuggefV d that this purchaser, under colour of a firft and  
larger proportion to.the board of ireafury, which wds never clo­  
sed (but pending that proportion) fold sundry parcels of land,  
between his eastern boundary before mentioned, and the Little  
Miami; and that the purchafeis have fettled thereon. If these  
luggefhons prove true, the fettlcrs will, perhaps, be thought to  
meut th. favor of the*legiflature, as purchafert for valuable con­  
federation, and without notice of the defe£l of title.  
  
The contra As. for lands, which were at one time under confi­  
dcration with MeilYs. Flint and Parker, and with Colonel Mor­  
gan, were never so tar orofecutcd as to biinj either party under  
any obligation. All proceedings thereon were dil&#x27;continued at a  
very early stage, and it &#x27;S supposed that no further view&#x27;s cxiit with  
any other party These, therefore, are not to be enumerated a­  
mong t xtftmg claims.  
  
6. Three townihips were reserved by the ordinance of May 20,  
1785, adjacent to Ljke Erie, for refugees from Canada and No-  
and for other purposes according to lefolutiom ot  
Coiigrefs, made or to be m -de on that fubjc&amp;. Theie would oi  
couiie contain 60,120 acrcs.  
  
7. The lame ordinance of May 20th, 1785, appropriated the,  
ihicr. towns of Gnadenhuitcn, Sthoenbrun, and Salem, on the  
Mufkingum, tor the christian Indians formesly fettled there, or  
the remains of that society, with the grounds round about them,  
and the quantity of the said circumjacent grounds, for each ot th  
ia:d towns, was determined by the relolution of Congress of Sep­  
tember 3d, 1788, to be so much as, with the plat of us iefpe£tive  
town, would make up 4000 acre*; lo that three towns aud theii  
circumjacent lands were to amount to 12,000 acres. This refei­  
vation was accoidmgiy made out of the large purchase of Cutlet  
and Sargent, which comprehended them. The Indians,however,  
tor whom the lefervation was made, have chosen to emigraic be­  
yond tliv limits of the United States, so that the lands icferved  
tor them, ftiil remain to the United States.  
On the whole, it appears that the United States may rightfully  
difpofeof the lands between the Wabafh, and the Ohio, Penn­  
sylvania, the torty-fii ft parallel of latitude, and the Indian hues  
defci ibed in the treaties of the Great Miami, and fort M&#x27;lntolh,  
with excepnons only of the rights saved by the deed of ceflion oi  
Virg. and of all rights legally derived trom the government ot the  
United States, and supposing the part south ot the Indian lines, to  
contain as before conje&amp;ured about 35 millions of acres, and  
that the claims of citizens before enumerated may amount to be­  
tween thirteen and fourteen millions, there remain at the difpofai  
of the United States upwards of twenty-one millions of actes, in  
thi&amp; northwestern quarter.  
And though the want of a&amp;ual surveys of fomc parts, and of a  
general delineation of the whole on paper, so as to exhibit to the  
eye the locations, forms, andielative portions of the rights betoie  
dcfcribcd, may prevent our forming a well defined idea ot them  
at this difUuce, yet, on the spot th.fe difficulties exilt but in a  
small degree. The individuals theie employed in the details of  
buying, felling and locating, possess local informations ot th,  
parts which concern them, to as to be able to keep clear ot eacn  
others rights ; or, it in some lnftances a confltft ot clauns (houlu  
arise, from any want of certainty in their definition, a ucal juug&#x27;.  
wil! doubtless be provided to decide them without delay, at Icaii  
provisionally. Time, instead of clearing up these uncertainties,  
will cloud them the more, by the death or removal ol witneiic,  
the difappearanee ot lines aad masks, change oi parties, and other  
cafualtics.
