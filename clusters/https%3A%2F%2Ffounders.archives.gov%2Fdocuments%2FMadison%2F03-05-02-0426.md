,Navy Department 21 Decr 1812  
On the subject of the Resolution of the honorable the House of Representatives, of the 16th: instant, I have the honor to state:  
That in pursuance of the Resolution of congress of the 3rd March 1805, a gold medal, emblematical of the attacks on the town batteries &amp; naval force of Tripoli, by the squadron under commre. Preble’s command, was presented to commre. Preble—in the manner stated in the enclosed letter dated May 17. 1806:  
That one month’s pay was allowed, “exclusively of the common allowance, to all the petty officers, seamen &amp; Marines of the squadron, who so gloriously supported the honor of the American flag, under the orders of their gallant commander in the several attacks”:  
That no sword has been presented to either of the commission officers or midshipmen, who distinguished themselves in the several attacks:  
And that it is not known to this Department, that there ever was made by Congress, a specific appropriation of 20.000$ for the purpose of carrying into effect the Resolution referred to.  
With respect to that part of the Resolution which “requests the President to cause a sword to be presented to each of the Commission officers &amp; midshipmen who distinguished themselves,[”] it is presumed that the President saw what to his mind appeared, difficulties of great delicacy, from the peculiar language of the Resolution. By the Resolution he was requested to present swords to such only as had distinguished themselves; and all having been represented to him, as having acted gloriously, he could not, in justice, draw with precision, a line of discrimination. He felt it is presumed a repugnance to the making of a selection which, by implication, would necessarily have cast an unmerited reproach upon all not therein included. A degradation of that kind, might have greatly injured the Service; &amp; could not possibly have been grateful to the honorable feelings of the favored officers. I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Sir Y. most O S

Sir—On the subject of th$ resolution of  
the honorable the Mouse of Representatives,  
•r»e &#x27; 6th instant, I have the honor tostate  
1 hat in the pursuance of the resolution of  
Congress of the third March 1803, a gold  
medal, embleir.a ical of the attacks on&#x27;the  
town j batteries and naval force of Tripoli,  
by the squadron under commodore Preble’s  
command, was presented to- commodore  
1 icble in the manner stated in the enclos­  
ed letter dated May 17, 1806 :  
That one month’s pay was allowed, &quot; ex­  
clusively of the common allowance, to all  
the petty officers, seamen and marines of  
tite squadron, who so gloriously supported  
the honor of the American Hag, under the  
orders of their gallant commander in the  
several attacks.”  
I hat no sword has been presented to ei­  
ther ot the commission officers or midship­  
men, who distinguished themselves in the  
several attacks:  
And that it is not known to this depart­  
ment that there ever was made by Con­  
gress a specific appropriation of S20.000  
tor the purpose of carrying into effect the  
resolution referred to :  
With respect to that part of the Resolu­  
tion which requests the President to cause  
a sword to be presented to each of the com­  
mission offictrs &amp; midshipmen who distin­  
guished themselves, it is presumed that the

and all having been represented to him as  
having acted gloriously, he could not injus­  
tice draw with precision a line of discri­  
mination. lie felt, it is presumed, a repug­  
nance to the making of a selection which,  
by implication, would necessarily have cast  
an unmerited reproach upon all not therein  
included. A degradation of that kind might  
have greatly injured the service : and could  
not possibly have been grateful to the

Navy Department, 21st Dec. 1812.  
Srn—~On the subject of the resolution of the honor-  
able the house of representatives, of the 16th inst.  
I have the honor to state,  
That in pursuance of the resolution of con-  
gress of the third March, 1805, a gold medal, em-  
blematical of the attacks on the town, batteries and  
naval force of Tripoli, by the squadron under com-  
modore Preble’s command, was presented to com-  
mocdore Preble—in the manner stated in the enclos-  
_ed letter dated May 17, 1806: ,  
  
* &quot;Phat one month’s pay was allowed, “exclusively  
of the common allowance, to all the petty officers,  
seamen and marines of the squadron, who so glori-  
ously supported the honor of the American flag,  
under the orders of their gallant commander in the  
several attacks.”  
  
That no sword has been presented to either of the  
commissioned officers or midshipmen, who distin-  
  
ished themselves in the several attacks :  
  
And that it is not known to this department that  
there ever was made by congress a specific appro-  
pri:tion of $20,000 for the purpose of carrying into  
effect the resolution referred to:  
  
With respect to that part of the resolution which  
requests the president to cause a sword to be pre+  
sented to each of the commissioned officers and mid-  
shipmen who distinguished themselves, it is pre-  
sumed that the president saw what to his mind ap-  
peared difficulties of great delicacy, from the pecu-  
liar language of the resolution. By the resolution  
he was requested to present swords to such only as  
had distinguished themselves; and all having been

could not in justice draw with precision a line of  
discrimination. He felt, it is presumed, a repug-  
nance to the making of a selection which, by impli-  
cation, would necessarily have cast un unmcrited  
reproach upon all not therein included. &lt;A degra-  
dation of that kind might have greatly injured the  
service: and could not possibly have been grateful  
to the honorable feelings of the favored officers.

Navy DeEpartMENT, December 21, 1812.  
  
Sir :—On the subject of the resolution of the Honorable the House of  
Representatives of the 16th inst. I have the honor to state, that, in pursuance  
of the resolution of’ Congress, of the 3d of March, 1805, a gold medal,  
emblematical of the attacks on the town, batteries, and naval force of Tripoli,  
by the squadron under Commodore Preble’s command, was presented to  
Commodore Preble in the manner stated in this enclosed letter dated May  
17, 1806. [See page 52, anéea.|  
  
That one month’s pay was allowed, exclusively of the common allowance, -  
to all the petty officers, seamen, and marines of the squadron, who so glori-  
ously supported the honor of the American flag under the orders of their  
gallant commander in the several attacks, - :  
  
That no sword has been presented to either of the commission officers  
or midshipmen, who distinguished themselves in the several attacks, and that  
it is not known to this Department, that there ever was made by Congress, a  
specific appropriation of twenty thousand dollars for the purpose of carrying  
into effect the resolution referred to. ee  
  
With respect to that part of the resolution which “ requests the President  
to cause a sword to be presented to each of the commissioned officers and  
midshipmen who distinguished themselves,” it is presumed the President saw  
what to his mind appeared difficulties of great delicacy, from the peculiar ~  
language of the resolution. By the resolution he was requested to present _  
swords to such only as had distinguished themselves, and all having been  
represented to him as having acted gloriously, he could not in justice,draw § ff  
with precision a line of discrimination, He felt, it is to be presumed, a  
repugnance to thé’making of a selection which, by implication, would 7 ad  
sarily have cast an unmerited reproach upon all not therein included. A  
degradation of that kind might have greatly injured the service, and could _  
not possibly have been grateful to.the honorable feelings of the favored  
officers. ae

The Secretary stated that no swords had
