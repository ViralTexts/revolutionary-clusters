Mr Pearce,  
Philadelphia 18th Decemr 1793.  
  
The paper enclosed with this letter will give you my ideas, generally, of the course  
of Crops I wish to pursue. I am sensible more might  
be made from the farms for a year or two—but my object is to recover the fields from  
the exhausted state into which they have fallen, by oppressive crops, and to restore  
them (if possible by any means in my power) to health &amp; vigour. But two ways will  
enable me to accomplish this. The first is to cover them with as much manure as  
possible (winter &amp; summer). The 2d a judicious succession of Crops.  
Manure cannot be had in the abundance the fields require; for this reason, and to  
open the land which is hard bound by frequent cultivation and want of proper  
dressings, I have introduced Buck Wheat in the plentiful manner you will perceive by  
the Table, both as a manure, and as a substitute for Indian Corn for horses &amp;ca;  
it being a great ameliorater of the Soil. How far the insufferable conduct of my  
Overseers, or the difficulty of getting Buck Wheat &amp; Oats for Seed, will enable me  
to carry my plan into effect, I am unable at this moment to decide. You, possibly,  
will be better able to inform me sometime hence. Colo. Ball of Leesburgh has promised  
to use his endeavours to procure &amp; send the first to Mount Vernon; but where to get as much of the latter as will answer my  
purposes (unless I send them from this City) I know not; but before  
I can decide on the quantity it may be necessary for me to purchase, it is essential I  
should know the quantity grown on my own estate; and which after I went to Virginia in  
September last I directed should no longer be fed away. The common Oats which are  
brought from the Eastern shore to Alexandria for sale, I would not sow—first, because  
they are not of a good quality—and 2dly because they are rarely, if ever, free from  
Garlick &amp; wild Onions; with which, unfortunately, many of my fields are already  
but too plentifully stocked from the source already mentioned; and that too before I  
was aware of the evil.  
I have already said that the insufferable conduct of my Overseers may be one mean of  
frustrating my plan for the next year—I will now explain myself. You will readily  
perceive by the rotation of Crops I have adopted, that a great deal of Fall plowing is  
indispensible. Of this I informed every one of them, and pointed out the fields which  
were to be plowed at this season. So anxious was I, that this work should be set about  
early, that I made an attempt soon after you were at Mount Vernon in September, to  
begin it; and at several times afterwards repeated the operation in different fields  
at Dogue run farm; but the ground being excessively hard &amp; dry, I found that to  
persevere would only destroy my horses without effecting the object, in the manner it  
ought to be, &amp; therefore I quit it; but left positive directions that it should  
recommence at every farm as soon as ever there should come rain to moysten the  
earth—&amp; to stick constantly at it, except when the horses were employed in  
treading out Wheat (which was a work I also desired might be accomplished as soon as  
possible). Instead of doing either of these, as I ordered, I find by the reports, that  
McKoy has, now &amp; then, plowed a few days only as if it were for amusement. That  
Stuart has but just begun to do it. and that neither Crow, nor Davy at Muddy hole, had  
put a plow into the ground so late as the 7th of this month. Can it be expected then,  
that frosts, Snow &amp; Rain will permit me to do much of this kind of work before  
March or April? When Corn planting, Oats sowing, and Buck Wht for manure, ought to be  
going into the grd, in a well prepared state, instead of having it to flush up at that  
Season—and when a good deal of Wheat is to be got out with the same horses. Crow  
having got out none of his that was stacked in the field, nor  
Stuart &amp; McKoy much of theirs, which is in the same predicament; the excuse being,  
as far as it is communicated to me, that their whole time &amp; force since the month  
of October has been employed in securing their Corn—When God knows little enough of  
that article will be made.  
I am the more particular on this head for two reasons—first to let you see how little  
dependence there is on such men when left to themselves (for under Mr Lewis it was  
very little better)—and 2dly to shew you the necessity of keeping these Overseers  
strictly to their duty—that is—to keep them from running about, and to oblige them to  
remain constantly with their people; and moreover, to see at what time they turn out  
of a morning—for I have strong suspicions that this, with some of them, is at a late  
hour, the consequence of which to the negroes is not difficult to foretell. All these  
Overseers as you will perceive by their agreements, which I herewith send are on  
standing wages; and this with men who are not  
actuated by the principles of honor or honesty, and not very regardful of their  
characters, leads naturally to endulgences—as their profits,  
whatever may be mine, are the same whether they are at a horse  
race or on the farm—whether they are entertaining company (which I believe is too much  
the case) in their own houses, or are in the field with the Negroes.  
Having given you these ideas, I shall now add, that if you find any one of them  
inattentive to the duties which by the articles of agreement they are bound to  
perform, or such others as may reasonably be enjoined, Admonish them in a calm, but  
firm manner of the consequences. If this proves ineffectual, discharge them, at any  
season of the year without scruple or hesitation, &amp; do not pay them a copper;  
putting the non-compliance with their agreemt in bar.  
To treat them civilly is no more than what all men are entitled to, but my advice to  
you is, to keep them at a proper distance; for they will grow upon familiarity, in  
proportion as you will sink in authority, if you do not. Pass by no faults or neglects  
(especially at first)—for overlooking one only serves to generate another, and it is  
more than probable that some of them (one in particular) will try, at first, what  
lengths he may go. A steady &amp; firm conduct, with an inquisitive inspection into  
and a proper arrangement of every thing on your part, will, though it may give more trouble at first, save a great deal in the end—and you may  
rest assured that in every thing which is just, and proper to be done on your part,  
shall meet with the fullest support on mine. Nothing will contribute more to effect  
these desirable purposes than a good example—unhappily this was not set (from what I  
have learnt lately) by Mr Whiting, who, it is said, drank freely—kept bad company at  
my house and in Alexandria—&amp; was a very debauched person—where ever this is the  
case it is not easy for a man to throw the first stone for fear of having it returned  
to him: and this I take to be the true cause why Mr Whiting did not look more  
scrupulously into the conduct of the Overseers, &amp; more minutely into the smaller  
matters belonging to the Farms—which, though individually may be trifling, are not  
found so in the agregate, for there is no addage more true than an old Scotch one,  
that “many mickles make a muckle.”  
I have had but little opportunity of forming a correct opinion of my white Overseers,  
but such observations as I have made I will give.  
Stuart appears to me to understand the business of a farm very well, and seems  
attentive to it. He is I believe a sober man, &amp; according to his own account a  
very honest one. As I never found him (at the hours I usually visited the farm) absent  
from some part or another of his people I presume he is industrious, &amp; seldom from  
home. He is talkative, has a high opinion of his own skill &amp; management—and seems  
to live in peace &amp; harmony with the Negroes who are confided to his care. He  
speaks extremely well of them, and I have never heard any complaint of him—His work  
however, has been behind hand all the year, owing, he says, and as I believe, to his  
having too much plowing to do—and the last omission, of not plowing when he knew my  
motives for wishing it, has been extremely reprehensible—But upon the whole, if he  
stirs early, &amp; works late, I have no other fault to find than the one I have just  
mentioned—His talkativeness &amp; vanity may be humoured.  
Crow is an active man, &amp; not deficient in judgment. If kept strictly to his duty  
would, in many respects, make a good Overseer. But I am much mistaken in his character  
if he is not fond of visiting, &amp; receiving visits. This, of course, withdraws his  
attention from his business, and leaves his people too much to themselves; which produces idleness, or slight work on one side, &amp; flogging on  
the other—the last of which besides the dissatisfaction which it creates, has, in one  
or two instances been productive of serious consequences—I am not clear either, that  
he gives that due attention to his Plow horses &amp; other stock which is necessary,  
although he is very fond of riding the former—not only to Alexandria &amp;ca but about  
the farm, which I did not forbid as his house was very inconvenient to the scene of  
his business.  
McKoy appears to me to be a sickly, slothful and stupid fellow. He had many more  
hands than were necessary merely for his Crop, &amp; though not 70 acres of Corn to  
cultivate, did nothing else. In short to level a little dirt that was taken out of the  
Meadow ditch below his house seems to have composed the principal part of his Fall  
work; altho’ no finer season could have happened for preparing the Second lot of the  
Mill Swamp for the purpose of laying it to grass. If more exertion does not appear in  
him when he gets into better health he will be found an unfit person to overlook so  
important a farm, especially as I have my doubts also of his care &amp; attention to  
the horses &amp;ca.  
As to Butler, you will soon be a judge whether he will be of use to you or not. He  
may mean well, and for ought I know to the contrary may, in something have judgment;  
but I am persuaded he has no more authority over the Negroes he is placed, than an old  
woman would have; and is as unable to get a proper days Work done by them as she  
would, unless led to it by their own inclination wch I know is not the case.  
Davy at Muddy hole carries on his business as well as the white Overseers, and with  
more quietness than any of them. With proper directions he will do very well, &amp;  
probably give you less trouble than any of them, except in attending to his care of  
the stock, of which I fear he is negligent; as there are deaths too frequent among  
them.  
Thomas Green (Overlooker of the Carpenters) will, I am persuaded, require your  
closest attention, without which I be

elieve it will be impossible to get any work done  
by my Negro Carpenters—in the first place, because, it has not been in my power, when  
I am away from home, to keep either him, or them to any settled work; but they will be  
flying from one trifling thing to another, with no other design, I believe, than to  
have the better opportunity to be idle, or to be employed on their own business—and in the next place, because—although authority is given  
to him—he is too much upon a level with the Negroes to exert it; from which cause, if  
no other every one works, or not, as they please, &amp; carve out such jobs as they  
like. I had no doubt when I left home the 28th of Oct. but that the house intended for  
Crow wd have been nearly finished by this time, as in order to facilitate the  
execution I bought Scantling, Plank &amp; Shingles for the building, instead of this I  
do not perceive by his weekly report that a tool has yet been employed in it—nor can I  
find out by the said report that the Barn at Dogue run is in much greater forwardness  
than when I left it.  
To correct the abuses which have crept into all parts of my business—to arrange it

indebted to Mr. George Hannah, Li-

In one of his letters to Mr. Pearce, as  
he is about to take charge, Washington  
says, Dec. 18, 1793: “ My object is to  
recover the fields from the exhausted  
state into which they have fallen by op-  
pressive crops, and to restore them (if  
possible by any means in my power) to

sketch of previous experiences with  
worthless overseers, adds: ‘ ‘Io correct

Philadelphia 18 Decem® 1793.  
Mr. Pearce,  
  
The paper enclosed with this letter will give you my ideas,  
generally, of the course of Crops I wish to. pursue.—I am  
sensible more might be made from the farms for a year or  
two—but my object is to recover the fields from the ex-  
hausted state into which they have fallen, by oppressive  
crops, and to restore them (if possible by any means in my  
power) to health and vigour—But two ways will enable me  
to accomplish this.—The first is to cover them with as much  
manure as possible (winter and summer),—The 2° a judicious  
succession of Crops.  
  
Manure can not be had in the abundance the fields re-  
quire; for this reason, and to open the land which is hard  
bound by frequent cultivation and want of proper dressings,  
I have introduced Buck Wheat in the plentiful manner you  
will perceive by the Table, both as a manure, and as a sub-  
stitute for Indian Corn for horses &amp;c‘; it being a great  
ameliorater of the soil.—Ilow far the insufferable conduct of  
my Overseers, or the difficulty of getting Buck Wheat and  
Oats for seed, will enable me to carry my plan into effect, I  
ain unable at this moment to decide.—You, possibly, will be  
better able to inform me sometime hence.—Col° Ball of  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
12 GEORGE WASHINGTON  
  
Leesburgh&#x27; has promised to use his endeavours to procure  
and send the first to Mount Vernon; but where to get as  
much of the latter as will answer my purposes (unless I send  
them from this city) I know not; but before I can decide on  
the quantity it may be necessary for me to purchase, it is es-  
sential I should know the quantity grown on my own estate ;  
and which after I went to Virginia in September last I di-  
rected should no longer be fed away.—The common Oats  
which are brought from the Eastern Shore to Alexandria for  
sale, 1 would not sow—first, because they are not of a good  
quality—and 2° because they are rarely, if ever, free from  
Garlick and wild Onions: with which, unfortunately, many  
of my fields are already but too plentifully stocked from the  
source already mentioned ; and that too before I was aware  
of the evil.  
  
I have already said that the insufferable conduct of my  
Overseers may be one mean of frustrating my plan for the  
next year.—I will now explain myself.—You will readily per-  
ceive by the rotation of Crops I have adopted, that a great  
deal of Fall plowing is indispensible.—Of this I informed  
every one of them, and pointed out the fields which were to  
be plowed at this season.—So anxious was I, that this work  
should be set about early, that I made an attempt soon after  
you were at Mount Vernon in September, to begin it; and  
at several times afterwards repeated the operation in differ-  
ent fields at Dogue-run farm ; *—but the ground being exces-  
sively hard and dry, I found that to persevere would only de-  
stroy my horses without effecting the object, in the manner it  
ought to be, and therefore I quit it; but left positive direc-  
tions that it should recommence at every farm as soon as ever

there should come rain to moysten the earth—and to stick  
constantly at it, except when the horses were employed in  
treading out Wheat (which was a work I also desired might  
be accomplished as soon as possible).—Instead of doing either  
of these, as I ordered, I find by the reports, that M*Koy has,  
now and then, plowed afew days only as if it were for amuse-  
ment.—That Stuart * has but just begun to do it—And that  
neither Crow &#x27; nor Davy * at Muddy-hole, had put a plow into  
the ground so late as the 7 of this month.—Can it be expect-  
ed then, that frosts, Snow and Rain will permit me to do much  
of this kind of work before March or April? When Corn  
planting, Oats sowing, and Buck Wh‘ for manure, ought to  
be going into the gr‘, in a well prepared state, instead of  
having it to flush up at that season—and when a good deal  
of Wheat is to be got out with the same horses.—Crow hav-  
ing got out none of his that was stacked in the field, nor  
Stuart’ and M°Koy* much of theirs, which is in the same  
predicament ;—the excuse being, as far as it is communicated  
to me, that their whole time and force since the month of  
October has been employed in securing their Corn—When  
God knows little enough of that article will be made.  
  
Iam the more particular on this head for two reasons—  
first to let you see how little dependence there is on such  
men when left to themselves (for under Mr. Lewis it was very  
little better)—and 2° to show you the necessity of keeping  
these Overseers strictly to their duty—that is—to keep them  
from running about, and to oblige them to remain constantly  
with their people ;—and moreover, to see at what time they  
turn out of a morning—for I have strong suspicions that this,  
with some of them, is at a late hour, the consequence of which  
to the Negroes is not difficult to foretell.—All these Overseers  
as you will perceive by their agreements, which I herewith  
send, are on standing wages; and this with men who are

not actuated by the principles of honor or honesty, and not  
very regardful of their characters, leads naturally to endul-  
gences—as their profits, whatever may be mine, are the same  
whether they are at a horse race or on the farm—whether  
they are entertaining company (which I believe is too much  
the case) in their own houses, or are in the field with the  
Negroes.  
  
Having given you these ideas, I shall now add, that if you  
find any one of them inattentive to the duties which by the  
articles of agreement they are bound to perform, or such  
others as may reasonably be enjoined,—Admonish them in a  
calm, but firm manner of the consequences.—If this proves  
ineffectual, discharge them, at any season of the year without  
scruple or hesitation, and do not pay them a copper ;—putting  
the non-compliance with their agreem* in bar.  
  
To treat them civilly is no more than what all men are en-  
titled to, but, my advice to you is, to keep them at a proper  
distance; for they will grow upon familiarity, in proportion  
as you will sink in authority, if you do not.—Pass by no  
faults or neglects (especially at first) for overlooking one only  
serves to generate another, and it is more than probable that  
some of them (one in particular) will try, at first, what lengths  
he may go.—A steady and firm conduct, with an inquisitive  
inspection into, and a proper arrangement of everything on  
your part, will, though it may give more trouble at first, save  
a great deal in the end—and you may rest assured that in  
everything that is just, and proper to be done on your part,  
[you] shall meet with the fullest support on mine.—Nothing  
will contribute more to effect these desirable purposes than a  
good example—unhappily this was not set (from what I have  
learnt lately) by Mr. Whiting, who, it is said, drank freely—  
kept bad company at. my house and in Alexandria—and was  
a very debauched person—wherever this is the case it is not  
easy for a man to throw the first stone for fear of having it  
returned to him;—and this I take to be the true cause why  
  
  
  
  
  
AND MOUNT VERNON. 15  
  
Mr. Whiting did not look more scrupulously into the conduct  
of the Overseers, and more minutely into the smaller matters  
belonging to the Farms—which, though individually [they]  
may be trifling, are not found so in the agregate; for there  
is no addage more true than an old Scotch one, that “many  
mickles make a muckle.”  
  
I have had but little opportunity of forming a correct  
opinion of my white Overseers, but such observations as I  
have made I will give.  
  
Stuart appears to me to understand the business of a farm  
very well, and seems attentive to it.—He is I believe a sober  
man, and according to his own account a very honest one.—  
As I never found him (at the hours I usually visited the farm)  
absent from some part or another of his people, I presume  
he is industrious, and seldom from home.—He is talkative,  
has a high opinion of his own skill and management—and  
seems to live in peace and harmony with the Negroes who  
are confided to his care.—He speaks extremely well of them,  
and I have never heard any complaint of him.—His work  
however, has been behind hand all the year, owing he says,  
and as I believe, to his having too much plowing to do—and  
the last omission, of not plowing when he knew my motives  
for wishing it, has been extremely reprehensible—But upon  
the whole, if he stirs early, and works late, I have no other  
fault to find than the one I have just mentioned—lIlis talk-  
ativeness and vanity may be humoured.  
  
Crow is an active man, and not deficient in judgment.—If  
kept strictly to his duty would, in many respects, make a good  
Overseer.—But I am much mistaken in his character, if he is  
not fond of visiting, and receiving visits.—This, of course,  
withdraws his attention from his business, and leaves his  
people too much to themselves; which produces idleness, or  
slight work on one side, and flogging on the other—the last  
of which besides the dissatisfaction which it creates, has, in  
one or two instances been productive of serious consequences  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
16 GEORGE WASHINGTON  
  
—I am not clear either, that he gives that due attention to  
his Plow horses and other stock which is necessary, although  
he is very fond of riding the former—not only to Alexandria  
&amp;c&#x27; but about the farm, which I did not forbid as his house  
was very inconvenient to the scene of his business.—  
  
M°Koy appears to me to be a sickly, slothful and stupid  
fellow.—He had many more hands than were necessary merely  
for his Crop, and though not 70 acres of Corn to cultivate,  
did nothing else.—In short to level a little dirt that was taken  
out of the Meadow ditch below his house seems to have com-  
posed the principal part of his Fall work; altho’ no finer  
season could have happened for preparing the second lot of  
the Mill swamp for the purpose of laying it to grass.—If  
more exertion does not appear in him when he gets into better  
health he will be found an unfit person to overlook so im-  
portant a farm, especially as I have my doubts also of his  
care and attention to the horses &amp;*.  
  
As to Butler, you will soon be a judge whether he will be  
of use to you or not.—He may mean well, and for ought I  
know to the contrary may, in some things have judgment;  
but I am persuaded he has no more authority over the Ne-  
groes he is placed, than an old woman would have; and is  
as unable to get a proper day’s Work done by them as she  
would, unless led to it by their own inclination w™ I know is  
not the case.—  
  
Davy at Muddy-hole’ carries on his business as well as the  
White Overseers, and with more quietness than any of them.  
—With proper directions he will do very well; and probably  
give you less trouble than any of them, except in attending  
to his care of the stock, of which I fear he is negligent ; as  
there are deaths too frequent among them.—  
  
Thomas Green (Overlooker of the Carpenters) will, I am  
persuaded, require your closest attention, without which I be

lieve it will be impossible to get any work done by my Negro  
Carpenters—in the first place, because, it has not been in my  
power, when I am away from home, to keep either him, or  
them to any settled work ; but they will be flying from one  
trifling thing to another, with no other design, I believe, than  
to have the better opportunity to be idle, or to be employed on  
their own business—and in the next place, because—although  
authority is given to him—he is too much upon a level with  
the Negroes to exert it; from which cause, if no other every  
one works, or not, as they please; and carve out such jobs as  
they like.—I had no doubt when I left home the 28™ of Oct.  
but that the house intended for Crow w* have been nearly  
finished by this time, as in order to facilitate the execution I  
bought Scantling, Plank and Shingles for the building; in-  
stead of this I do not perceive by his weekly report that a  
tool has yet been employed in it—nor can I find out by the  
said report that the Barn at Dogue-run is in much greater  
forwardness than when I left it.  
  
To correct the abuses which have crept into all parts of my  
business—to arrange it properly, and to reduce things to sys-  
tem ; will require, I am sensible, a good deal of time and  
your utmost exertions ;—of the last, from the character you  
bear, I entertain no doubt; the other, I am willing to allow,  
because I had rather you should probe things to the bottom,  
whatever time it may require to do it, than to decide hastily  
upon the first view of them ; as to establish good rules, and  
a regular system, is the life, and the soul of every kind of  
- business. —
