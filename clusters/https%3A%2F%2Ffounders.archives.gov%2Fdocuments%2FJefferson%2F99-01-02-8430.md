To the Legislature of New Hampshire.   
Aug. 2. 1808.  
  
In the review, fellow citizens, which, in your address of the 14th. of June, you have taken of the measures pursued since I have been charged with their direction, I read with great satisfaction, and thankfulness the approbation you have bestowed on them; and I feel it an ample reward for any services I may have been able to render.  
The present moment is certainly eventful, and one which peculiarly requires that the bond of confederation connecting us as a nation should recieve all the strength which unanimity between the national councils &amp; the state legislatures can give it. the depredations committed on our vessels and property on the high seas, the violences to the persons of our citizens employed on that element, had long been the subject of remonstrance and complaint, when, instead of reparation, new declarations of wrong are issued, subjecting our navigation to general plunder. in this state of things our first duty was to withdraw our seafaring citizens &amp; property from abroad, and to keep at home resources so valuable at all times, and so essential, if resort must ultimately be had to force. it gave us time too to make a last appeal to the reason &amp; reputation of nations: in the mean while I see with satisfaction that this measure of self-denial is approved and supported by the great body of our real citizens: that they meet with chearfulness the temporary privations it occasions, and are preparing with spirit to provide for themselves those comforts and conveniencies of life, for which it would be unwise ever more to recur to distant countries. how long this course may be preferable to a more serious appeal must depend for decision on the wisdom of the legislature; unless indeed a return to established principles should remove the existing obstacles to a peaceable intercourse with foreign nations. in every event, fellow-citizens, my confidence is entire that your resolution to maintain our national independance &amp; sovereignty will be as firm as it has been forbearing. and looking back on our history, I am assured by the past, that it’s future pages will present nothing unworthy of the former.  
I am happy that you approve of the motives of my retirement. I shall carry into it ardent prayers for the welfare of my country, and the sincerest wishes for that of yourselves personally.

IN the review, Fellow-Citizensi  
which, in your addre(s of the 14th of

pursued since I have been charged

eventful, and one which peculiarly re.  
quires that the bond of confederation  
conneting us asa nation should re.  
ceive all the firength which unanimi.  
ty between the national councils and  
the State Legislatures can give it.—  
The depredations committed on our  
vessels and property on the high seas,  
the violences to the persons of our ci­  
tizens employed on that element, had  
long bzen the {ubj=&amp; of remonfirance  
and complaint, when, instead of repa­  
ration, new declarations of wrong are  
issued fubjeding our mavigation tfo  
general plunder. In this slate of  
things ouir firlt doty was io withdraw  
our feafaring citizens and properiy  
from abroad, and to keap at home re­  
sources so valnable at a}ff times, and  
so eicential, if resort must ultimately  
be had to force. It gave ustime too  
to make a last appeal to the reason  
and reputation of nations; In the  
mean while I fee with fatisfation that  
this measure of felf denial is approved  
and supported by the great body of  
our teal citizens ; that they meet with  
cheerfulnefls the temporary privations  
it occasions, and are preparing with  
{pirit to provide for themselves those  
comforts and convéeniences of fifc, for  
which it would be unwifé ever more  
to recut. to distant countries, How  
long this tourfe muy be preferable to  
a more serious appeal, must depend  
sot decision on the wisdom of the Le­  
gislature ; unless indeed a retutn to  
eltablithed principles should remove  
the exilting obflacles to a peaceable  
intercourse with foreign nations. ~ln  
every event, fellow-citizens, my confi­  
dence is entire that your refolation to  
maintain our national independence  
and sovereignty will be as irm as it  
has been torbearing ; and looking

s to every one who is not an incurable  
party-man, that the rescinding the orders in coun­  
cil would he the most unwelcome news that Mr.  
Jefferson could hear of, as removing the grand pre­  
text for the continuance of his strong and favouiite  
measure, the repeal of which would bring down up­  
on his head Buonaparte’s impotent vengeance. It  
is the fear of this which keeps open the wounds with  
Britain, and is the true and only cause of all our  
present privations and distresses, and of those more  
deep and alarming, which we have in perspective.  
  
READ AND REFLECT!

in your address of the 14th of June,  
you hare taken of the measure* pursued

have been able to render.  
The present moment ii certainly e­

quires that the bond of confederation  
connecting us as a nation, should re*  
ceive all the strength which unanimity  
between the national councils and the  
state legislatures can give it. The de­  
predations committed on our vessels  
and property on the high seas, the vio­

ployed on that element, had king bach  
the subject of remonstrance ana com­  
plaint, when instead of reparation, new  
dcclartions of wrong are issued subject­  
ing oiir navigation tu general plunder.  
In this state of dungs our first duty was  
to withdraw our sea-faring citizens and  
property from abroad, and to keep at
