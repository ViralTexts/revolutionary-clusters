Monday September 9, 1776.  
Resolved, that in all Continental Commissions, and other Instruments where heretofore the Words, “United Colonies,” have been used, the Stile be altered for the future to the United States.  
The Board of War brought in a report, which was read.  
On this day, Mr. Franklin, Mr. Edward Rutledge and Mr. John Adams proceeded on their Journey to Lord Howe on Staten Island, the two former in Chairs and the last on Horseback; the first night We lodged at an Inn, in New Brunswick. On the Road and at all the public Houses, We saw such Numbers of Officers and Soldiers, straggling and loytering, as gave me at least, but a poor Opinion of the Discipline of our forces and excited as much indignation as anxiety. Such thoughtless dissipation at a time so critical, was not calculated to inspire very sanguine hopes or give great Courage to Ambassadors: I was nevertheless determined that it should not dishearten me. I saw that We must and had no doubt but We should be chastised into order in time.  
The Taverns were so full We could with difficulty obtain Entertainment. At Brunswick, but one bed could be procured for Dr. Franklin and me, in a Chamber little larger than the bed, without a Chimney and with only one small Window. The Window was open, and I, who was an invalid and afraid of the Air in the night blowing upon me, shut it close. Oh! says Franklin dont shut the Window. We shall be suffocated. I answered I was afraid of the Evening Air. Dr. Franklin replied, the Air within this Chamber will soon be, and indeed is now worse than that without Doors: come! open the Window and come to bed, and I will convince you: I believe you are not acquainted with my Theory of Colds. Opening the Window and leaping into Bed, I said I had read his Letters to Dr. Cooper in which he had advanced, that Nobody ever got cold by going into a cold Church, or any other cold Air: but the Theory was so little consistent with my experience, that I thought it a Paradox: However I had so much curiosity to hear his reasons, that I would run the risque of a cold. The Doctor then began an harrangue, upon Air and cold and Respiration and Perspiration, with which I was so much amused that I soon fell asleep, and left him and his Philosophy together: but I believe they were equally sound and insensible, within a few minutes after me, for the last Words I heard were pronounced as if he was more than half asleep.... I remember little of the Lecture, except, that the human Body, by Respiration and Perspiration, destroys a gallon of Air in a minute: that two such Persons, as were now in that Chamber, would consume all the Air in it, in an hour or two: that by breathing over again the matter thrown off, by the Lungs and the Skin, We should imbibe the real Cause of Colds, not from abroad but from within. I am not inclined to introduce here a dissertation on this Subject. There is much Truth I believe, in some things he advanced: but they warrant not the assertion that a Cold is never taken from cold air. I have often conversed with him since on the same subject: and I believe with him that Colds are often taken in foul Air, in close Rooms: but they are often taken from cold Air, abroad too. I have often asked him, whether a Person heated with Exercise, going suddenly into cold Air, or standing still in a current of it, might not have his Pores suddenly contracted, his Perspiration stopped, and that matter thrown into the Circulations or cast upon the Lungs which he acknowledged was the Cause of Colds. To this he never could give me a satisfactory Answer. And I have heard that in the Opinion of his own able Physician Dr. Jones he fell a Sacrifice at last, not to the Stone but to his own Theory; having caught the violent Cold, which finally choaked him, by sitting for some hours at a Window, with the cool Air blowing upon him.  
The next Morning We proceeded on our Journey, and the Remainder of this Negotiation, will be related from the Journals of Congress, and from a few familiar Letters, which I wrote to my most intimate Friends before and after my Journey. The abrupt uncouth freedom of these, and all others of my Letters, in those days require an Apology. Nothing was farther from my Thoughts, than that they would ever appear before the Public. Oppressed with a Load of Business, without a Clerk an Amanuensis, or any Assistance, I was obliged to do every Thing myself. For seven Years before this I had never been without three Clerks in my Office as a Barrister: but now I had no Secretary nor servant whom I could trust to write: and every thing must be copied by myself, or be hazarded without any. The few that I wrote upon this Occasion I copied; merely to assist my memory as Occasion might demand.  
There were a few Circumstances which appear neither in the Journals of Congress nor in my Letters, which may be thought by some worth preserving. Lord How had sent over an Officer as an Hostage for our Security. I said to Dr. Franklin, it would be childish in Us to depend upon such a Pledge and insisted on taking him over with Us, and keeping our Surety on the same side of the Water with Us. My Colleagues exulted in the Proposition and agreed to it instantly. We told the Officer, if he held himself under our direction he must go back with Us. He bowed Assent, and We all embarked in his Lordships Barge. As We approached the Shore his Lordship, observing Us, came down to the Waters Edge to receive Us, and looking at the Officer, he said, Gentlemen, you make me a very high Compliment, and you may depend upon it, I will consider it as the most sacred of Things. We walked up to the House between Lines of Guards of Grenadiers, looking as fierce as ten furies, and making all the Grimaces and Gestures and motions of their Musquets with Bayonets fixed, which I suppose military Ettiquette requires but which We neither understood nor regarded.  
The House had been the Habitation of military Guards, and was as dirty as a stable: but his Lordship had prepared a large handsome Room, by spreading a Carpet of Moss and green Spriggs from Bushes and Shrubbs in the Neighbourhood, till he had made it not only wholesome but romantically elegant, and he entertained Us with good Claret, good Bread, cold Ham, Tongues and Mutton.  
I will now proceed to relate the Sequel of this Conference,

he affirmatire.  
The felllowing extract dated Sept o, of the  
same year is highly characteristic  
A JOURNEY ON HORSERAaCk.  
On this day Mr. Franklin, Mr. Edward Rntledze,  
and Mr. Joln Adams, proceeded on their journey to  
Lord Howe, on Staten Island, the two former in  
chairs, and the latter on horseback. The first night  
we lodged at an inn in New-Brunswick. On the  
road, and at all the public houses, we saw such num­  
bers of officers and soldiers, straggling and loitering,  
as gave me, at least, but a poor opinion of the discl  
pline of our forces, and excited as much indignation  
as anxiety. Such thoughtless dissipation, at a time  
so critical, was not calculated to inspire very san­  
guine hopes, or give great courage to ambassadors.  
I was, nevertheless, determmed that it should not  
dishearten me. I saw that we must, and had no  
doubt but we should, be chastised into order in time.  
The taverns were so full we could with difficulty  
obtain entertainment. At Brunswick, but one bed  
could be procured for Dr Franklin and me, in a  
chamber little larger than the bed, without a chim­  
ey, and with only one small window. The window  
was open, and I who was an invald and afraid of  
the aif in the night, shut it close. &quot;On tnys  
Franklin, &quot;don&#x27;t shut the window we shall be suffoe­  
cated.&quot; I answered, I was afraid of the evening  
air beFtanthin tephed, &quot;The alf within ths  
er will soon be, and indeed is now, worse  
than that without doors, Come, open the window  
and come to bed, and I will convince you I be  
hieve you are not acsuainted with my theorr of  
colds.&quot; Opening the window, and leaping into  
I said I had read his letters to Dr. Cooper, in whics  
he had adyanced, that nobody ever got cold by gound  
into a cold church or any other cold air, but the  
theory was so little consistent with my expenenct;  
that I thought it a parador. However, I had to  
much curiosity to hear his reasons that I would runl  
the risk of a cold. The Doctor then began a hare­  
angue upon air and cold, and respiration and perspl  
ration, with which I was to much amused that I soon  
fell asleep dand left him and his philosophy together,  
but I selieve they were equally sound and insenarbls  
within a few minutes arter me, for the last words  
heard were pronounced as if he was moret  
than half  
asleep I remember little of the lecture, ercepe  
that the human body, by respiration and persgeranf,  
destroys a galion of aif in a minute that twe  
persons as were now in that chamber, would con,  
sume all the air in it in an hour or two that by  
breathing over again the matter thrown off by the  
lungs and the skin, we should imbibe the real caut  
of colds, not from abroad, but from within. I am  
not inclined to introduce here a dissertation on this  
bject. There is much truth, I believe, in some  
things he advanced, but they warrant not the  
tion that a cold is never taken from cold air. I hare  
often conversed with him since on the same subjecd,  
nd I believe with him, that colds are often taken is  
air in close rooms, but they are often taked.  
from cold air abroad, too I have often asked hiffl  
whether a person heated with exercise going eud,­  
senly into cold air, or standing still in a current of  
it, might not have his pores suddenly contracted, his  
perspiration stopred, and that matter thrown inte  
the circulations, or cast upon the lungs, which he  
nowledved was the cause of colds. To this he  
never could sive me a satisfactory answer, and I  
have heard that in the opinion of his own able physl  
cian, Dr. Jones, he fell a sacrifice at last, not to the  
stone, but to his own theory, having caught the vice  
ent cold which finally choked him, by sitting fof  
some hours at a window, with the cool air blowing  
upon him  
The next morning we proceeded on our journey,  
ane the remainer of this wegotiation will be related  
from the Jouinals of Congress, and troet a fes fe

JOHN ADAMS AND DR. FRANKLIN IN ONE Bep.  
“The taverns were so full we could with dif.  
fieulty obtain entertainment. At Brunswick  
but one bed could be procured for Dr. Franklin  
and me, in a chamber little larger than the bed,  
without a chimney, and with only one small  
window. .The window was open, and I, who  
was an invalid and afraid of the air in the night,  
shut it close. ‘Ob! says Franklin, ‘don’t shut  
the window, we shall be suffocated.’ I answer-  
ed, I was afraid of the evening air. Dr. Frank-  
lin replied, ‘The air within this chamber wil]  
soon be, and indeed is now, worse than that  
without doors, Come, open the window and  
come to bed, and I will convince you. I be-  
lieve you are not acquainted with my theory of  
colds.’ Opening the window, and leaping into  
bed, I said I had read his letters to Dr. Couper,  
in which he had advanced, that nobody ever  
got cold by going into a cold ehureh or any  
other cold air, but the theory was so little con-  
sistent with my experience, that I thought ita  
paradox. However, I had so much curiosity to  
hear his reasons that I would run the risk of a

air and cold, and respiration and perspiration, with  
which I was so much amused that [ soon fell

but I believe they were equally sound and iu-  
sensible within a few minutes after me, for the  
last words I heard were pronounced as if he was  
more than halfasleep. I remember little of the  
lecture, except that the human body, by respira-

On this day Mr. Franklin, Mr. Edward Rutledge,  
and Mr. John Adams, proceeded on their journey to  
Lord Howe, on Staten Island, the two former in  
chairs, and the latter on horseback. The first night  
we lodged at an inn in New-Brunswick. On theroad,  
and at all the public houses, we saw such nuinbers of  
officers and soldiers, straggling and loitering, 2s gave  
me, at least, but a poor opinion of the discipline of  
our forces, and excited as much indignation as anxi-  
ety. Such thoughtless dissipation at a time so criti-  
cal, was not calculated to inspire very sanguine hopes,  
or give great courage to ambassadors. I was, never-  
theless, determined that it should not dishearten me.  
I saw that we must, and had no doubt but we should,  
be chastised into order in time.  
  
The taverns were so full we could with difficulty  
obtain entertainment. At Brunswick, but one bed  
could be procured for Dr. Franklin and me, in a  
chamber little larger than the bed, without a chimney,  
and with only one small window. The window was  
open, and I, who was an invalid and afraid of the air  
in the night, shut it close. ‘‘Oh !’’ says Franklin,  
** don’t shut the window, we shall be suffocated.’’ T

tlemen, you make me a very high compliment, and  
you may depend upon it, I will consider it as the most  
sacred of things.’’ We walked up to the house be-  
tween lines of guards of grenadiers, looking fierce as  
ten furies, and making all the grimaces, and gest-  
ures, and motions of their muskets, with bayonets  
fixed, which, 1 suppose, military etiquette requires,  
but which we neither understood nor regarded.  
  
| The house had been the habitation of military  
guards, and was as dirty as a stable ; but his lordship  
had prepared a large, handsome room, by spreading  
|a carpet of moss and green sprigs, from bushes and  
|shrubs in the neighborhood, till he had made it not  
|only wholesome, but romantically elegant ; and he  
| entertained us with good claret, good bread, cold ham,  
| tongues, and mutton.

heard were pronounced as if he was more than half |  
  
asleep. I remember little of the lecture, except that  
the human body, by respiration and perspiration,  
destroys a gallon of air in a minute ; that two such  
persons as were now in that chamber would consume  
all the air in it in an hour or two ; that by breathing  
over again the matter thrown off by the lungs and the  
skin, we should imbibe the real cause of colds, not  
from abroad, but from within. I am not inclined to  
introduce here a dissertation on this subject. There  
is much truth, I believe, in some things he advanced,  
but they warrant not the assertion that a cold is never  
taken from cold air. I have often conversed with him  
since on the same subject, and I believe with him,  
that colds are often taken in foul air in close rooms,  
but they are often taken from cold air abroad too. I  
have often asked him whether a person heated with  
exercise going suddenly into cold air, or standing still  
in a current of it, might not have his pores suddenly  
contracted, his perspiration stopped, and that matter  
thrown into the circulation, or cast upon the lungs,  
which he acknowledged was the cause of colds. To  
this he never could give me a satisfactory answer, and  
I have heard that, in the opinion of his own able  
physician, Dr. Jones, he fell a sacrifice at last, not to  
the stone, but to his own theory, having caught the  
violent cold which finally choked him, by sitting for  
some hours at a window, with the cool air blowing  
upon him.  
  
The next morning we proceeded on our journey,  
and the remainder of this negotiation will be related  
from the Journals of Congress, and from a few  
familiar letters, which I wrote to my most intimate  
friends before and after my journey. The abrupt,  
uncouth freedom of these and all others of my letters,  
in those days, requires an apology. Nothing was  
further from my thoughts than that they would ever  
appear before the public. Oppressed with a load of  
business, without an amanuensis, or any assistance,  
I was obliged to do everything myself. For seven  
years before this, I had never been without three  
clerks in my office as a barrister, but now I had no  
secretary, or servant, whom I could trust to write,  
and everything must be copied by myself, or be haz-  
arded without any copy. The few that [ wrote, upon  
this occasion, I copied merely to assist my memory, as  
oceasion might demand.  
  
There were a few circumstances which appear  
neither in the Journals of Congress, nor in my let-  
ters, which may be thought by some worth preserving.  
Lord Howe had sent over an officer as a hostage for  
cur security. I said to Dr. Franklin, it would be  
childish in us to depend upon such a pledge, and in-  
sisted on taking him over with us, and keeping our  
suciety on the same side of the water with us. My  
colleagues exulted in the proposition, and agreed to  
it instantly. We told the officer, if he held himself  
under our direction, he must go back with us. He  
bowed assent, and we all embarked in his lordship’s  
barge. As we approached the shore, his lordship,  
observing us, came down to the water’s edge to

? l&#x27; ranklin and Adams were obliged to

window, which was open. ?? Oh.&quot; cried

he observes, that ‘“* Lord Howe had sent over an officer as a hostage for our security. I said to Dr.  
Franklin, it would be childish in us to depend upon such a pledge, and insisted on taking him over  
with us, and keeping our surety on the same side of the water with us. My colleagues exulted in  
the proposition and agreed to it instantly. We told the officer, if he held himself under our direc-  
tion, he must go back with us. He bowed assent, and we all embarked in his lordship’s barge. As  
we approached the shore, his lordship, observing us, came down to the water’s edge to receive us,  
and, looking at the officer, he said, ‘Gentlemen, you make me a very high compliment, and you may  
depend upon it, I will consider it as the most sacred of things’? We walked up to the house be-  
tween lines of guards of grenadiers, looking fierce as ten Furies, and making all the grimaces, and  
gestures, and motions of their muskets, with bayonets fixed, which, I suppose, military etiquette re-  
quires, but which we neither understood nor regarded.”  
  
“ The house had been the habitation of military guards, and was as dirty as a stable ; but his lord-  
ship had prepared a large handsome room, by spreading a carpet of moss and green sprigs, from  
bushes and shrubs in the neighborhood, till he made it not only wholesome, but romantically elegant ;  
and he entertained us with good claret, good bread, cold ham, tongues, and mutton,”

Furies, and making all the grimaces and gestures and  
motions of their muskets, with bayonets fixed, which, I  
suppose, military etiquette requires, but which we neither  
understood nor regarded. The house had been the hab-

At Brunswick, but one bed could be procured  
for Dr. Franklin and me, in a chamber little  
larger than the bed, without a chimney, and with  
only one small window. The window was open,  
and I who was an invalid and afraid of the air of  
night, shut it close. “Oh,” says Franklin, “don’t  
shut the window, we shall be suffocated.” I an-  
swered I was afraid of the evening air. Dr.  
Franklin replied, “The air within this chamber  
will soon be, and indeed is now, worse than that  
without doors. Come, open the window and come  
to bed, and I will convince you. I believe you are  
not acquainted with my theory of colds?” Open-  
ing the window, and leaping into bed, I said I had  
  
.read his letters to Dr. Cooper, in which he had ad-  
  
vanced, that nobody ever got cold by going into  
a cold church or any other cold air, but the theory  
was so little consistent with my experience, that  
I thought it a paradox. However, I had so much  
curiosity to hear his reasons that I would run the  
risk of a cold. The Doctor then began a harangue  
upon air and cold, and respiration and perspiration,  
with which I was so much amused that I soon fell  
asleep, and left him and his philosophy together,  
but I believe they were equally sound and insen-  
sible within a few minutes after me, for the last  
words I heard were pronounced as if he was more  
than half asleep. I remember little of the lecture,  
except that the human body, by respiration and  
perspiration, destroys a gallon of air in a minute;  
that two such persons as were now in that cham-  
ber, would consume all the air in it in an hour or  
two; that by breathing over again the matter  
thrown off by the lungs and the skin, we should  
imbibe the real cause of colds, not from abroad,  
but from within.  
  
Even Franklin, however, could have a sur

According to John Adams, “it was the
