ptionable decisions of their respective courts. But the errors and usurpations of the supreme court of the United States will be uncontrolable and remediless.” This, upon examination, will be found to be altogether made of false reasoning upon misconceived fact.  
In the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration, which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the constitution, or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect, than may be claimed by the courts of every state. I admit however, that the constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the constitution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention; but from the general theory of a limited constitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable to most, if not to all the state governments.

ceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these papers, that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a part of the legislative body. But though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule; yet it verges so nearly upon it, as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the convention. From a body which had had even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application. The same spirit, which had operated in making them would be too apt to operate in interpreting them: Still less could it be expected, that men who had infringed the constitution, in the character of legislators, would be disposed to repair the breach, in the character of judges. Nor is this all: Every reason, which recommends the tenure of good behaviour for judicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power in the last resort in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period. There is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes in the first instance to judges of permanent standing, and in the last to those of a temporary and mutable constitution. And there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men selected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to the revision and control of men, who for want of the same advantage cannot but be deficient in that knowledge. The members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges; and as on this account there will be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information; so on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions, there will be no less reason to fear, that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice. The habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides, will be too apt to stifle the voice both of law and of equity.  
These considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those states, who have committed the judicial power in the last resort, not to a part of the legislature, but to distinct and independent bodies of men. Contrary to the supposition of those, who have represented the plan of the convention in this respect as novel and unprecedented, it is but a copy of the constitutions of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia; and the preference which has been given to these models is highly to be commended.  
It is not true, in the second place, that the parliament of Great Britain, or the legislatures of the particular states, can rectify the exception

 and extent, to the state governments, as to the national government, now under consideration. Not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject.  
It may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has been upon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system. This may be inferred with certainty from the general nature of the judicial power; from the objects to which it relates; from the manner in which it is exercised; from its comparative weakness, and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force. And the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check, which the power of instituting impeachments, in one part of the legislative body, and of determining upon them in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department. This is alone a complete security. There never can be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the bo

imits.  
But why, it is asked, might not the same purpose have been accomplished by the instrumentality of the state courts? This admits of different answers. Though the fitness and competency of those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude; yet the substance of the power in question, may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan, if it were only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out of the national constitution. To confer the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of the several states, would perhaps be as much “to constitute tribunals,” as to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more direct and explicit provision to have been made in favour of the state courts? There are, in my opinion, substantial reasons against such a provision: The

ibuted between the supreme and the inferior courts of the union.  
The supreme court is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only “in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which A STATE shall be a party.” Public ministers of every class, are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns. All questions in which they are concerned, are so directly connected with the public peace, that as well for the preservation of this, as out of respect to the sovereignties they represent, it is both exp

dient and proper, that such questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the nation. Though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong, the same observation is in a great measure applicable to them. In cases in which a state might happen to be a party, it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal. Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this paper, I shall take occasion to mention here, a supposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds: It has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one state to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute that state in the federal courts for the amount of those securities. A suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation.  
It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty, not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent. This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the union. Unless therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the states, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of state sovereignty, were discussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no colour to pretend that the state governments, would by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would it be to authorise suits against states, for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident that it could not be done without waging war against the contracting state; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a preexisting right of the state governments, a power which would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.  
Let us resume the train of our observations; we have seen that the original jurisdiction of the supreme court would be confined to two classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. In all other causes of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would appertain to the inferior tribunals, and the supreme court would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction, “with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the congress shall make.”  
The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamours have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact. Some well intentioned men in this state, deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury, in favour of the civil law mode of trial, which pr

lance is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law. But if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of New-England. There an appeal from one jury to another is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side. The word “appellate” therefore will not be understood in the same sense in New-England as in New-York, which shews the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular state. The expression taken in the abstract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision, (in a new government it must depend on the latter) and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as

The powers of congress are enumerated in, and defined by the  
8th section of the 1st article of the constitution. If this power  
has been granted to congress by any part of this section, it is by  
the following passage : ‘* Congress shail have power to-constitute  
tribunals inferior to the supreme court.”

thority has observed, “ that to confer upon the existing courts of  
the several states, the power of determining such causes, would  
perhaps be as much to constitute tribunals, as to create new courts

‘“‘Tn all other cases before mentioned the Supreme Court  
shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with

Mr. Hamilton, in the 81st number of the Federalist, after  
quoting the provision observes: “The propriety of this ap-

regard to matters of law, but the clamors have been loud  
against it as applied to matters of fact. Some well-inten-

induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial

many instances, either triumphed over, or sought to  
triumph over, the judicial power? The alarm is not  
new. It was raised, and was exposed, while the  
Constitution was before the people for their adop  
tion or rejection. Again, we may recur to The Peder  
alist, number so, written by the pen of Hamilton, a  
lawyer as well as a statesman:  
&quot;The supposed danger of judiclary encroachments on  
the legislative authority, which has been upon many  
oceasions relterated, is, in reality, a phantom. Particular  
misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the  
Legislature may now and then happen; but they can  
 never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenlence,  
or in any sensible degree affect the order of the political  
 system. This may be inferred with certainty from the  
general nature of the judicial power, from the otqects to  
which it relates, fromn the manner in which it is exercised.  
from its comparative weakness, and from its total inca  
pacity to support its usurpations by force. And the in  
ference is greatly fortined by the consideration of the  
important constitutional check which the power of inen  
tuting impeachments in one part of the legislative body,  
and of determining upon them in the other, would give  
to that body apon the members of the judiclal depart  
ment. This alone is a complete security.&quot;  
With one more grosslylerroneous statement, we  
pass to more valuable matter. &quot;The Judicial power,&quot;

cle al of the Federalist, in which he says:  
&quot;It has been suggested that an assignment of the  
public securities of one State to the citizens of  
another would enable them to prosecute that State  
in the Federal courts for the amount of those secu-­  
ritses. A suggestion which the following considera-  
tions orove to be without fonndation: It is inherent  
in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to  
the suit of an individual without its consent. This  
is the general cense and the general practice of  
mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attrle  
butes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the govern-  
ment of every State in the Union.&quot;  
And referring to his remarks in a previ  
ous number on the article of the Constitue  
tion in respect to taxation, Mr. Hamilton  
goes on to say:  
A recurrence to the principles thare estab-­  
lished will satisfy us that there is no color to pre  
tend that the State Governments would, by the  
adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege  
of paying their own debts in their own way free  
frein every constraint but that which flows from  
the obligations of good faith.&quot;  
And still more forcibly he says:  
&quot;The contracts hetween a nation and individ-  
nals are only binding on the conscience of the  
sovereign, and have no pretension to a compelsive  
force. They confer no right of action independ-  
ent of the sovereign will.&quot;  
They confer no right of action? Is not  
that strong enough? Does that not clinch  
this whole question? Certainly, so far as  
Mr. Hamilton is considered authority, it  
is conclusive that a State cannot be stied  
by its own citizens, nor by any one else,

SOAN A STATE BE SUED.  
A late decision of Judge Billings,  
of the U. 8. circuit court, reiterates  
tih time hased doctrine that States  
are not amenable to suits by individ­  
uals, whether citizens of the State  
sued or of some other State. This  
doctrine has been firmly held to since  
the time of Alexander Hamilton, in  
t 1818. That eminent jurist says:  
&quot;It is inherent in the nature of  
sovereignty, not to be amenable to  
the suit of an individual without its  
consent. This is the general sense  
and the general practice of mankind;  
4, and the exemption, as one of the at­  
tributes of sovereignty, is now en­  
to joyed by the government of every  
State in the Union. * * There is  
no color to pretend that the State  
governments would, by the adoption  
ir of the plan of the convention, be di­  
eY vested of the privilege of paying  
their debts in their own way, free  
from every constraint but that which  
Sflows from the obligations of good  
faith. The contracts between a na­  
tion and individals are only binding  
, on the conscience of the sovereign  
de and have no pretension to a com­  
pulsive force. They confer no right  
y. of action independent of the sover­  
eign will. To what purpose would it  
be to authorize suits against States  
for the debts they owe t How could  
recoveries be enforced ? It is evident  
it could not be done without waging  
war against the contracting State;  
and to useribe to the Federal courts  
by mere implieation and in destrue­  
tion of a pre-existing right of the  
State governments a power which  
V would involve suhe a omsaequenee  
would be altogether forced and n­  
warrantable.&quot;

might be subjected to prosecution by the citizens of another. To this the  
Federalist replied that the danger intimated was “ merely ideal,” and that

The eighty-first number of the Federalist, written by Hamil-

“It has been suggested that an assignment of the public  
securities of one State to the citizens of another, would enable  
them to prosecute that State in the federal courts for the

“Tt is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be  
amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.  
This is the general sense and the general practice of mankind;  
and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is  
now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union.  
Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in  
the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States,  
and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circum-  
stances which are necessary to produce an alienation of state  
sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of tax-  
ation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the  
principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no  
color to pretend that the state governments would, by the  
adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying  
their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint  
but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The  
contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding  
on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretension to  
a compulsive force. They confer no right of action indepen-  
dent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would it be to  
authorize suits against States ‘for the debts they owe? How  
could recoveries be enforced? It is evident that it could not  
be done without waging war against the contracting State ;  
and to ascribe to the federal courts by mere implication, and  
in destruction of a pre-existing right of the state governments,

In making the judiciary a distinct branch of the govern-  
ment, the Convention only followed the lead of the majority  
of the states. Having spoken of the dangers and incon-  
venience of constituting either branch of the legislature a  
court of final appeal, Hamilton writes as follows: “ These  
considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those  
states who have committed the judicial power, in the last

independent bodies of men. Contrary to the supposition
