April 4. 1769  
Positions to be examined.  
1 All Food or Subsistence for Mankind arise from the Earth or Waters.  
2 Necessaries of Life that are not Foods, and all other Conveniencies, have their Values estimated by the Proportion of Food consumed while we are employed in procuring them.  
  
3 A small People with a large Territory may subsist on the Productions of Nature, with no other Labour than that of gathering the Vegetables and catching the Animals.  
4 A large People with a small Territory finds these insufficient, and, to subsist, must labour the Earth to make it produce greater Quantities of vegetable Food, suitable for the Nourishment of Men, and of the Animals they intend to eat.  
5 From the Labour arises a great Increase of vegetable and animal Food, and of Materials for Clothing, as Flax, Wool, Silk, &amp;c. The Superfluity of these is Wealth. With this Wealth we pay for the Labour employed in building our Houses, Cities, &amp;c. which are therefore only Subsistence thus metamorphosed.  
6 Manufactures are only another Shape into which so much Provisions and Subsistence are turned as were equal in Value to the Manufactures produced. This appears from hence, that the Manufacturer does not in fact, obtain from the Employer, for his Labour, more than a mere Subsistence, including Raiment Fuel and Shelter; all which derive their Value from the Provisions consumed in procuring them.  
7 The Produce of the Earth, thus converted into Manufactures, may be more easily carried to distant Markets than before such Conversion.  
8 Fair Commerce is where equal Values are exchanged for equal the Expence of Transport included. Thus if it costs A. in England as much Labour and Charge to raise a Bushel of Wheat as it costs B. in France to produce four Gallons of Wine then are four Gallons of Wine the fair Exchange for a Bushel of Wheat. A and B meeting at half Distance with their Commodities to make the Exchange. The Advantage of this fair Commerce is, that each Party increases the Number of his Enjoyments, having, instead of Wheat alone or Wine alone, the Use of both Wheat and Wine.  
9 Where the Labour and Expence of producing both Commodities are known to both Parties Bargains will generally be fair and equal. Where they are known to one Party only, Bargains will often be unequal, Knowledge taking its Advantage of Ignorance.  
10 Thus he that carries 1000 Bushels of Wheat abroad to sell, may not probably obtain so great a Profit thereon as if he had first turned the Wheat into Manufactures by subsisting therewith the Workmen while producing those Manufactures: since there are many expediting and facilitating Methods of working, not generally known; and Strangers to the Manufactures, though they know pretty well the Expences of raising Wheat, are unacquainted with those short Methods of working, and thence being apt to suppose more Labour employed in the Manufactures than there really is, are more easily imposed on in their Value, and induced to allow more for them than they are honestly worth.  
11 Thus the Advantage of having Manufactures in a Country, does not consist as is commonly supposed, in their highly advancing the Value of rough Materials, of which they are formed; since, though sixpenny worth of Flax may be worth twenty shillings when worked into Lace, yet the very Cause of it’s being worth twenty shillings is, that besides the Flax, it has cost nineteen shillings and sixpence in Subsistence to the Manufacturer. But the Advantage of Manufactures is, that under their shape Provisions may be more easily carried to a foreign Market; and by their means our Traders may more easily cheat Strangers. Few, where it is not made are Judges of the Value of Lace. The importer may demand Forty, and perhaps get Thirty shillings for that which cost him but twenty.  
12 Finally, there seem to be but three Ways for a Nation to acquire Wealth. The first is by War as the Romans did in plundering their conquered Neighbours. This is Robbery. The second by Commerce which is generally Cheating. The third by Agriculture the only honest Way; wherein Man receives a real Increase of the Seed thrown into the Ground, in a kind of continual Miracle wrought by the Hand of God in his Favour, as a Reward for his innocent Life, and virtuous Industry.

every new difeafe, which may appear  
onthe decline of others, that fo he  
mav be enabled to bring effectual and  
feafonable relief to fuch perfons, as  
may be committed to his care.  
2 &gt; S&amp;S“ O  
  
Pofitions to be examined,  
1. LL food or fubfiltence for  
  
LX mankind arifes from the earth  
or waters,  
  
2. Neceffaries of life that are not  
ds, and all other conveniencies,  
have their value eftimated by the pro-  
portion of food confumed while we  
are employed in procuring them.  
  
9 A {mall people with a large ter-  
nory, may fubfilt on the productrons  
of ature, with no other labour than  
thar of gathering the vegetables and  
caching the animals,  
  
. A large people with a fmall ter-  
tory, find thefe infufhicient, and to  
  
4  
  
fubfift, muft labour the earth, to make  
it produce greater quantities of vege-  
table food, fuitable for the nourifh-  
ment of men, and of the animals they  
intend to eat,  
  
5» From this labour arifes a great  
increafe of vegetable and animal food,  
and of materials for clothing, as flax,  
wool, filk, &amp;e. The fuperfluity of  
thefe ts wealth, With this wealth  
we pay for the labour employed in  
building our houfes, cities, &amp;c. which  
are therefore only fubfiftence thus me-  
tamorphofed.  
  
6. Manufaétures are only another  
fhape into which fo much provifions  
and fubliftence are turned, as were  
equal in value to the manufactures pro-  
duced. This appears from hence,  
that the manufacturer does not, in  
fatt, obtain from the employer, for  
his labour, more than a mere fubfitt-  
ence, including raiment, fuel, and  
fhelter; all which derive their value  
from the provifions confumed in pro-  
curing them.  
  
7. The produce of the earth, thus  
converted into manufactures, may be  
more eafily carried to diftant markets  
than before fuch converfion.  
  
8. Fair commerce ts, where equal  
values are exchanged for equal, the  
expence of tranfport included. Thus,  
if it cofts A in England as much la-  
bour and charge to raife a bufhel of  
wheat, asit colt B in France to pro-  
duce four gallons of wine, then are  
four gallons of wine the fair exchange  
for a bufhel of wheat, A and B meet-  
ing at half diftance with their commo-  
dities to make the exchange. The  
advantage of this fair commerce is,  
that each party increafes the number  
of his enjoyments, having, inflead of  
wheat alone, or wine alone, the ufe  
of both wheat and wine,  
  
g. Where the labour and expenfe  
of producing both commodities are  
known to both parties, bargains wil  
generally be fair and equal, Where  
they are known to one party only,  
bargains will often be unequal, know -  
ledge taking its advantage of ignorance.  
  
10. Thus he that carries 1000 bufhels  
of wheat abroad to fell, may not pro-  
bably obta&#x27;n fo great a profit thereon,  
as uf he had frit turned the wheat in-  
to manufactures, by fubfillirng there-

thods of working, not generally known;  
and ftrangers to the mannfactures,  
though they know pretty well the ex-  
pente of raifing wheat, are unacquaint-  
ed with thofe thort methods of work-  
ing, and thence being apt to fuppofe  
more labour employed in the manu-  
faftures than there really is, are more  
eatily impofed on in their value, and  
induced to allow more for them than  
they are honeftly worth.  
  
a1. Thus the advantage of having  
manufattures in a country, does not  
confit, as is commonly fuppofed, in  
their highly advancing th: value of  
rough materials, of which they are  
formed ; fince, though fix pennyworth  
of flax may be worth twenty fhillings  
when worked into lace, yet the very  
caufe of its being worth twenty fhil-  
lings, is, that, befides the flax, it has  
colt nineteen fhillings and fix pence in  
fubfiflence to the manufacturer, But  
the advantage of manufactures ts, that  
under their fhape provifions may be  
more eafily carried to a foreign mar-  
ket; and by their means our traders  
may more eafily cheat flrangers: Few,  
where it is not made, are judges of  
the value of lace. ‘Tbe importer  
may demand forty, and perhaps get  
thirty {billings for that which coil him  
but twenty.  
  
12. Finally there feem to be but  
three ways for a nation to acquire  
wealth. The firft is by war, as the  
P.omans did, in plundering their con-  
quered neighbours. This is robbery.  
-——The fecond by commerce, which is  
generally cheating.— The third by a-  
yticulture, the only honeft way;  
wherein man receives a real increafe  
of the feed thrown into the ground,  
in akind of continual miracle wrought  
by the hand of God in his favour, as  
reward fer his innocent life and his  
virtuous indultry.

POSITIONS TO BE EXAMINED.  
BY THE LATE DR FRANKLIN.  
  
Au food, or subsistence for mankind, arises  
from the earth or waters.  
  
2. Necefsaries of life that are not foods, and all  
other conveniencies, -have their value estimated by  
the proportion of food consumed while we are em-  
ployed in procuring them.  
  
3. A small people, with a large territory, may sub.  
sist on the productions of nature, with no other la-  
bour than that of gatherigg the vegetables and cateh-  
ing the animals.  
  
4. A large people, with a small territory, find these  
insufficient ; and, to subsist, must labour the earth,  
to make it produce greater quantities of vegetable  
food, suitable for the nourifhment of men, and of the  
animals they intend to eat.  
  
5. From this labour arises a great increase of vege-  
table and animal food, and of materials for clothing ;  
as flax, wool, silk, t%c. The superfluity of these is  
wealth. With this wealth we pay for the labour  
employed in building our houses, cities, 8c. which  
are therefore only subsistence thus metamorpho-  
sed.  
  
6. Manufactures are only another fhape into which  
so much provisions and subsistence are turned, as  
were in value equal to the manufactures produced.  
This appears from hence, that the manufacturer  
does not, in fact, obtain from the employer, for his  
labour, more than a mere subsistence, including rai-  
  
  
  
£792- positions to be examined. 329  
ment, fuel, and fhelter ; all which derive their value  
from the provisions consumed in procuring them.  
  
7. The produce of the earth, thus converted in-  
to magufactures, may be more easily carried to dise  
tant markets than before such conversion.  
  
8. Fair commerce is where equal values are ex&gt;  
changed for equal, the expence of transport inclu-  
ded. Thus, of it costs A in England as much la-  
bour and charge to raise a bufhel of wheat, as it costs  
B in France to produce four gallons of wine, then are  
four gallons of wine the fair exchange for a bufhel  
of wheat, A and B meeting at half distance with  
their commodities to make the exchange. The ad-  
vantage of this fair commeree is,,that each party in-  
creases the number of his enjoyments, having, in-  
stead of wheat alone, or wine alone, the use of both  
wheat and wine.  
  
g- Where the labour and expence of producing  
both commodities are known to both parties, bar-  
gains will generally be fair and equal. Where  
they are known to one party only, bargains will  
often be unequal, knowledge taking its advantage  
of ignorance.  
  
10. Thus he that carries 1oao bufhels of wheat  
abroad to sell, may not probably obtain so great a  
profit thereon, as if he had first turned the wheat in-  
to manufactures, by subsisting therewith the work-  
men while producing those manufactures, since  
there are many expediting and facilitating methods  
of working, not generally known; and strangers to  
the manufactures, though they know pretty well  
the expence of raising wheat, are unacquainted with  
  
  
  
328 positions to be examined. Dec. 26.  
those. fhort methods of working ; and thence, being  
apt to suppose more Jabouremployed in the manu-  
factures than there really i is, are more easily impo-  
sed on in their value,and induced.to allow more for  
them than they are honestly worth.  
  
11. Thus the advantage. of.having manufactures  
in a country, does not consist, ‘as is commonly sup~  
posed, in their highly advancing the value of rough  
materials, of which they are formed; since, though  
six pennyworth of flax may be-worth.twenty {hil-  
lings when worked into lace, yet the yery cause of  
its being worth twenty fhillings, is, that, besides the  
flax, it has cost nineteen fhillings and sixpence in sub-  
sistence to the manufacturer. But ‘the advantage  
of manufactures is, that under their dhape, provisions  
maay be more easily carried to a foreigd market ; and  
by their means our traders may moreveasily cheat  
strangers. Few, where it is not made, are judges  
of the value of lace. The importer may demand  
forty, and pehaps get thirty thillings. for that which  
cost him but twenty.  
  
12. Finally, there seem to be: but thfee ways for  
a nation to acquire wealth. The first is by war,  
as the Romans ‘did, in plundering their conquered  
neighbours ; this is robbery —The second by com-  
merce, which is generally cheating.—The third by  
agriculture, the only honest way; wherein man

POSITIONS TO BE EXAMINED.  
  
1, Aut food, or subsistence for mankind, arises from the  
earth or waters.  
  
2, Necessaries of life that are not foods, and all other con-  
vemences, have their value estimated in the proportion of food  
consumed while we are wre in procuring them,  
  
3. A small people with a large territory, may subsist on the  
  
uctions of nature, with no other labor than that of gather-  
ing the vegetables and catching the animals, J  
  
4A —_ people with a small territory, find these insuf-  
ficient; and, to subsist, must labor the earth, to make it pro-  
duce greater quantities of vegetable food, suitable to the nou-  
rishment of men, and of the animals they intend to eat.  
  
5. From this labor arises a great increase of vegetable  
and animal food, and of materials for clothing; as flax, wool,  
sik, &amp;c. The er of these is wealth, With this  
wealth we pay for the labor employed in building our houses,  
cities, &amp;c. which are therefore only subsistence thus meta-  
morphosed. .  
  
6. Manufactures are only another shape into which so  
much provisions and subsistence are turned, as were in value  
equal to the manufactures produced. This appears from  
hence, that the manufacturer does not, in fact, obtain from the  
employer, for his labor, more than a mere subsistence, includ-  
ing raiment, fuel, and shelter; all which derive their value  
from the provisions consumed in procuring them.  
  
1. The produce of the earth, thus converted into manufac-  
tures, may be more easily carried into distant markets, than  
before such conversion.  
  
8. Fair commerce is where equal values are exchanged for  
equal, the expense of transport included. Thus, if it costs  
A in England, as much labor and charge to raise a bushel of*  
wheat, as it costs B in France to produce four gallons of wine,  
then are four gallons of wine the fair exchange for a bushel  
of wheat, A and B meeting at half distance with their com-  
modities to make the exchange. The advantage of this fair  
commerce is, that each party increases the number of his  
enjoyments, having, instead of wheat alone, or wine alone,  
the use of both wheat and wine,  
  
9. Where the labor and expense of producing both com-  
modities are known to both parties, bargains will generally be  
fair and equal. Where they are known to one party only,  
bargains will often be unequal, knowledge taking its advan-  
  
e of ignorance.  
  
0, Thus he that carries a thousand bushels of wheat abroad  
to sell, may not probably obtain so great a profit thereon, as  
ifhe had first turned the wheat into manufactures, by subsist-  
ing therewith the workmen while producing those manufac-  
tures, since there are many expediting and facilitating methods  
of working, not generally faown ; and strangers to the manu-  
factures, though they know pretty well the expense of raising  
wheat, are unacquainted with those short methods of work-  
ing; and thence, being apt to suppose more labor employed  
in the manufacture than there really is, are more easily  
imposed on in their value, and induced to allow more for them  
than they are honestly worth.  
  
11. Thus the advantage of having manufactures in a coun-  
try does not consist, as is commonly supposed, in their highly  
  
vancing the value of rough materials, of which they are  
formed ; since, though sixpennyworth of flax may be worth  
twenty shillings when worked into lace, yet the very cause of  
its being worth twenty shillings is that, besides the flax, it has  
cost nineteen shillings and sixpence in subsistence to the  
manufacturer. But the advantage of manufactures is, that,  
under that shape, provisions may be more easily carried to a  
foreign market ; and by their means our traders may more  
easily cheat strangers. Few, where it is not made, are  
judges of the value of lace, The importer may demand for-  
ty, and perhaps get thirty shillings for that which cost him  
but twenty,  
  
12, Finally, there seems to be but three ways for a nation  
to acquire wealth. The first is by war, as the Romans did,  
in plundering their conquered neighbors ; this is robbery.—  
The second by commerce, which is generally cneating.—  
The third by agriculture, the only honest way wherein man  
receives a real increase of the seed thrown into the ground,  
ma kind of continual miracle, wrought by the hand of God  
in his favor, as a reward for his innocent life and his virtuous  
industry. B. Franxuin

In determining the value of manufactured articles, he  
comes out more plainly still on the physiocratic side.  
Though six pennyworth of flax, he says, be worth twenty  
shillings, when worked into lace, yet the very cause of its  
being worth twenty shillings is that, besides the flax, it has  
cost 19s. 6d. in subsistence to the manufacturer.’

of manufactures is in this, that by their means our traders  
may more easily cheat strangers. Few, where it is not made,  
are judges of the value (¢. ¢., cost of production) of lace.  
The importer may demand 4os. and perhaps get 30s. for that  
which cost him but 20s.
