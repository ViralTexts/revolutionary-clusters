You will perhaps be Surprized at the Liberty I take in addressing you, but being governed by motives of humanity &amp; encouraged in my design by Some military gentlemen and merchants of the united States now in this place, I Beg leave to claim your attention for a moment, on the Situation of the unhappy persons in your country who have the misfortunate misfortune to be deaf &amp; dumb. afflicted myself with these infirmities &amp; feeling with great Sensibily Sensibility for all these in the Same Situation I have enquired of the american gentlemen who have visited our Institution in Bordeaux, for the Instruction of deaf and dumb, whether there existed any Similar establishment in the united States. Being informed that no Such School had been established with you &amp; Learning that among your deaf and dumb all those who had not the means of coming to Europe were deprived of Instruction I feel an ardent desire to devote my Labours and existence to procure for them the inestimable blessing of the education of which their organisation is Susceptible &amp; which is So indispensable both for their own happiness &amp; to render them useful members of Society.  
I was educated myself in the Institution of the deaf &amp; dumb in this city &amp; having acquired by long application a Perfect Knowledge of the most approved method of Instructing this unfortunate Portion of society I have for these eight years exercized the Function of Teacher &amp; have also acquired a tolerable Knowledge of the English Language. If The american Government or Benevolent Individuals of your Country are disposed to Form an Institution in the united States I would Willingly go there for that purpose. I can pur procure Satisfactory testimonial of my moral character and my Capacity for Teaching the deaf &amp; dumb from american Consul &amp; Several respectable military &amp; Commercial Gentlemen of the united States who honour me with Their friendship &amp; Esteem—I will entirely depend on the wisdom &amp; judgment of the american Government or of the individuals who undertake to assist me in the proposed establishment, to fix the mode &amp; plan of its organisation.

If you think your Government Cannot from its formation establish Such an Institution, Will you inform me what probability there is of any one of States Governments undertaking to create Such an Establishment, or whether in your Opinion Individual Subscription could be raised for its formation. Your worthy consul, mr Lee. has given me great encouragement, but I wish to feel Secure of a competency before I undertake a Voyage, as it would not be prudent in me to let go a certainty for an uncertainty having from the Institution here a Salary of 1800 francs besides other Emoluments

. Borpeavx, April 9, 1816..  
Sir—Yon will, perhaps, be strprized at a li-  
berty f take in addressing you; but being govern-  
ed by motives of humaity, and encouraged in my  
design by some military gentlemen and metchants  
of the United States, now in this place, I beg  
leave to call your attention, for a moment, to the  
situation of the unhappy persons in your country  
who have the misfortune to be deaf and dumb.  
Afflicted myself with these infirmities, and feeling,  
with great sensibility, for all those in the same  
situation, I have enquired of the American gen-  
tlemen, who have visited our institution in Bor-  
deaux, for the instrdction of the deaf and dumb,  
whether there existed any similar establishment  
in the U. States.—Being infottied that no such  
school had been established with you, and learn-  
ing, that, among your deaf and dumb, all those  
who have not the means of coming to Europe,  
were deprived of instruction, | feel an ardent de-  
site to devote my labors and existence to procure  
for them the iiestimable blessing of the education.  
of which their orgahization is susceptible, and  
which is so indispensable, both for their own hap-  
piness, and to render them useful members of  
society.  
  
I was educated myself in the institution of the  
deaf and dumb, in this city, and having acquired,  
by long application, a perfect knowledge of the  
most approved method of instructing this unfor-  
tunate portion of society: I have, for these eight  
years, exercised the functions of teacher—I have  
also aequired a tolerable knowledge of the English  
language. If the Ameriaan government or be«  
nevolent individuals of your country are disposed  
to favour an institution in the United States, I  
would willingly go there for that purpose. I ean  
procure satisfactory testimonials of my moral

Our institution here is calenlated for sixty poor  
students, at the expense of the goverment, which  
pays for each 600 francs (about 114 dolls.) per  
anoum, and 24,000 (less than 5000 dolls.) for pro-  
fessors, aud sundry other charges ; to which is to  
be added the expense of a suitable building, beds,  
linens, &amp;e. making the aggregate expense about  
1000 franes annually (190 dollars) for each indi-  
vidual. The rich pay the expense of their chil-  
dren-—and if, as I have been told, a considerable  
portion of the deaf and dumb in the U. States  
have the means of paying for these instructions,  
ihe expense to the goverament or a private so-  
ciety would be inconsiderable--for myself, I do  
not claim great emoluments, my desired object is

ambition is to secure a comfortable subsistance  
for my family.

Bordeaux, April Pth, 1816.  
Sir—You will, perhaps, be surprised  
ai the liberty I take in addressing you,  
  
but being governed by motives of hu- |  
  
mauity, and encouraged in my design by  
some tnilitary gentlemen and mer hants  
of the United States now in this place,  
I beg leave to claim your attention, for  
zmoment, to the situation of the unhap-  
py persons in your country who have the  
misfortune to be deaf and dumb. Af-  
tlicted myself with these infirmities, and  
fecling, with great sensibility, for all  
those in the same skwuation, I have in-  
quired of the American gentlemen who  
have visited our Institution in Bordeaux  
  
jor the instruction of the deaf and dumb, .  
  
whetlier there existed any similar es-  
tablishment in the United States ; being  
informed, that no such School had been  
  
established with you, and t-arning that |  
  
among your deaf and dumb, all those  
  
who had not the means of coming to Eu- |  
rope, were deprived of instruction, I fec} |  
an ardent desire to devote my labors and |  
  
existence to procure for them the inesti-  
mable blessing of the education of which  
theif organization is susceptible, and  
which is soindispensable, both for their  
own happiness and to render them Usc-  
ful members of society.  
  
I was educated myself in the Institu-  
tion of the deaf and dumb in this city,  
and having acquired, by long applica-  
tion, a perfect. knowledge of the most  
approved method of instructing this un-  
fortunate portion of socicty, I have, for  
these cight, years, exercised the func-  
tions of teacher, and have also acquir-  
eda tolerable knowledgé of the Eng-  
lish language. If the American gov-  
crnment or benevolent individuals of  
your country, are disposed to form an  
Institution in the United States, 1 would  
willingly go there for that purpose. I  
can procure setisiactory testimoniais of  
my moral character, and my capacity for  
teaching the deaf and dumb, from the  
American consul and several respecta-  
ble military and commercial gentlemen  
of the United Siates, who honor me with  
their friendship and estcem. 1 will en-  
tirely depend on the wisdom and judg.  
ment of the American government, or of  
the individuals who undertake to assist  
me in the proposed establishment, to fix  
the mode and plan of its organization.  
Our institution here is calculated for 50  
poor students at the expence of ‘the yov-  
ernmecnt, Which pays for each 600 francs  
per aanum, and 24,000 francs for profes-  
sors and sundry other charges, to which  
is to be added the expense of a suitable  
building, beds, linen, &amp;c. moking the ag-  
gregate expense about 1000 francs annu-  
atiy for each indivicual The rich pay  
the expence of their children, aud it, as  
{ have been told, a considerable portion  
of the dezf and dumb in the United  
States have the means of paying for their  
instructim, the expence to government  
or a private society would be inconsider-  
able ; for mysclf I do not claim great  
emoluments ; my desire and object is to  
serve an afflicted postion of humanity.  
1 have awilc, and my only ambition is to  
  
focuré a comfortable existence for my  
milly...  
  
If you think your Gorérnment cannos,  
from us formation, establish such an In-  
stitution, will you inform me what proba-  
bility thece is of any one of the Sate  
governments undertaking to create such  
an establishment, or whewher, in your  
opinion, individual subscription couid be

Borpgaux, April 9, 1816.  
  
Sin,—You will, perhaps, be surprized at a li-  
berty I take in addressing you ; but being govern-  
ed by motives of humanity, and encouraged in my  
design by some military gentlemen and merchants  
of the United States, now in this place, I beg leave  
to call your attention, for 4 moment, to the situa-  
tion of the unhappy persons in your country whe  
have the misfortune to be deaf and dumb. Af-  
flicted myself with these infirmities, and fecling,  
with great sensibility, for all those in the same  
situation, [ have enquired of the American gentle-  
men, who have visited our institution, in Bordeaux,  
for the instruction of the deaf and dumb, whether  
there existed any similar establisliment in the  
United States.—B cing informed that no such school  
had been estublished with you, and learning, that,  
among your deaf and dumb, all those who have  
not the means of coming to Europe were deprived  
of instruction, I feel an ardent desire to devote my  
labors and existence to procure for them the in-  
estimable blessing of the education of which their  
organization 1s susceptable, and which is so indis-  
pensible, both for their own happin ss, and to  
render them useful members of society.  
  
I was educated myself in the institution of the  
deaf and dumb, in this city, and having scquired,  
by long application, a perfect knowledge of the  
most approved method of instructing this unfor-  
tunate portion of society; I have, for these eight  
years, exercised the functions of teacher; Ihave  
ulso acquired a tolerable knowledge of the Eng-  
lish language. If the American government or  
benevolent individuals of your country are dis.  
posed to favour an institution inthe United States,  
I would willingly go there for that purpose. 1  
can procure satisfactory testimonials of my moral  
character, and of my capacity for teaching the  
deaf and dumb, from respectable military and  
commercial gentlemen of the United States, who  
honor me with their friendship and esteem. !  
shall entirely depend upon the wisdom and judg-  
ment of the American government, or of the in-  
dividuals who undertake to assist me, in the pre-  
sent establishment, to fix the mode and plan of its  
organization.  
  
Our institution here is calculated for sixty poor  
students, at the expense of the government, which  
pays for each 600 francs (about $114) per annum,  
and 24,000 (less than $5,000) for professors, and  
sundry other changes, to which is to be addec  
the expense of a suitable building, beds, linens,  
&amp;ec. making the aggreg:re expense about one 1000  
francs annually ($190) for each individual. The  
rich pay the expense of their children—and if,  
as [ have been told, a considerable portion of the  
deaf and dumb in the United Statea have the  
means of paying for these instructions, the expense  
to the government or a private society would be  
inconsiderable; for myself, Ido not claim great  
emoluments, my desire and object is te serve an  
afflicted portion of humanity; my ambition is to  
secure a comfortable subsistance for my family.
