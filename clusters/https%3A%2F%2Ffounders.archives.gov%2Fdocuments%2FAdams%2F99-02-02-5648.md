sty’s assurances that he will readily employ his good offices in support of the United States in all points relative to their prosperity—and considering the territorial claims of these states, as heretofore made, their participation of the fisheries, and of the free navigation of the Mississippi, not only as their indubitable right, but as essential to their prosperity, they trust that his majesty’s efforts will be successfully employed to obtain a sufficient provision and security for those rights. Nor can they refrain from making known to his majesty, that any claim of restitution or compensation for property confiscated in the several states will meet with insuperable obstacles; not only on account of the sovereignty of the individual states, by which such confiscations have been made; but of the wanton devastation which the citizens of these states have experienced from the enemy and in many instances from the very persons in whose favour such claim may be urged.  
That Congress trust that the circumstances of the allies, at the negotiation for peace, will be so prosperous as to render these expectations consistent with the spirit of moderation recommended by his majesty.
