Dear Sir  
Bath Hotel Westminster June 2. 1785  
  
During my Interview with the Marquis of Carmarthen he told me, that it was customary, for every foreign Minister, at his first Presentation to the King, to make his Majesty Some Compliments conformable to the Spirit of his Credentials: and when Sir Clement Cottrell Dormer, the Master of the Ceremonies, came to inform me, that he Should accompany me to the Secretary of State and to Court, he Said that every foreign Minister, whom he had attended to the Queen, had always made an Harrangue to her Majesty, and he understood, tho he had not been present that they always harrangued the King. on Tuesday Evening the Baron de Lynden, called upon me and Said he came from the Baron De Nolken, and had been conversing upon the Singular Situation I was in, and they agreed in Opinion that it was indispensable that I Should make a Speech, and that it Should be as complimentary as possible. all this was parrallel to the Advice lately given by the Comte de Vergennes to Mr Jefferson. So that finding it was a Custom established at both these great Courts, and that this Court and the foreign Ministers expected it, I thought I could not avoid it, although my first Thought and Inclination had been to deliver my Credentials Silently and retire.  
At one on Wednesday the first of June, the Master of Ceremonies called at my House, and went with me to the Secretary of States Office in Cleveland Row, where the Marquis of Carmarthen received me and introduced to me, his Under Secretary Mr Frasier, who has been as his Lordship said, uninterruptedly in that Office, tho all the Changes in Administration, for thirty Years, having first been appointed by the Earl of Holderness. After a Short Conversation upon the Subject of importing my Effects from Holland and France, free of Duty, which Mr Frasier himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen invited me to go with him in his Coach to Court. When We arrived in the Antichamber, the Œil de Beuf of St James’s, the Master of the Ceremonies met me and Attended me, while the Secretary of State went to take the Commands of the King. While I Stood in this Place, where it Seems all Ministers Stand upon Such occasions, always attended by the Master of Ceremonies, the Room very full of Ministers of State, Bishops and all other Sorts of Courtiers, as well as the next Room which is the Kings Bedchamber, you may well Suppose that I was the Focus of all Eyes. I was relieved however from the Embarrassment of it, by the Sweedish and Dutch Ministers, who came to me and entertain’d me, in a very agreable Conversation during the whole time. Some other Gentlemen whom I had Seen before came to make their Compliments too untill the Marquis of Carmarthen returned, and desired me, to go with him to his Majesty. I went with his Lordship, through the Levee Room into the Kings Closet, the Door was Shut, and I was left with his Majesty and the Secretary of State alone. I made the three Reverences, one at the Door, another about half Way and the third before the Presence, according to the Usage established at this and all the northern Courts of Europe, and then address’d myself to his Majesty in the following Words.  
Sir  
The United States of America, have appointed me their Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty, and have directed me to deliver to your Majesty, this Letter, which contains the Evidence of it. It is in Obedience to their express Commands that I have the Honour to assure your Majesty of their Unanimous Disposition and desire, to cultivate the most friendly and liberal Intercourse, between your Majestys Subjects and their Citizens, and of their best Wishes for your Majestys Health and Happiness, and for that of your Royal Family.  
The Appointment of a Minister from the United States to your Majestys Court, will form an Epocha, in the History of England and of America. I think myself more fortunate, than all my fellow Citizens, in having the distinguish’d Honour, to be the first to Stand in your Majestys Royal Presence, in a diplomatic Character: and I Shall esteem myself the happiest of Men, if I can be instrumental in recommending my Country, more and more to your Majestys Royal Benevolence and of restoring an entire esteem, Confidence and Affection, or in better Words, “the old good Nature and the old good Humour” between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and   
  
  
  
under  
different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood.— I beg your Majestys Permission to add, that although I have Sometimes before, been entrusted by my Country it was never in my whole Life in a manner So agreable to myself.—  
The King listened to every Word I Said: with dignity, it is true, but with an apparent Emotion. Whether it was the Nature of the Interview, or whether it was my visible Agitation for I felt more than I did or could express, that touch’d him, I cannot Say, but he was much affected, and answered me with more tremor, than I had Spoken with, and Said  
Sir  
The Circumstances of this Audience are so extraordinary, the language you have now held is So extreamly proper, and the Feelings you have discovered, So justly adapted to the Occasion, that I must Say, that I not only receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States, but that I am very glad the Choice has fallen upon you to be their Minister. I wish you, Sir to believe, and that it may be understood in America, that I have done nothing in the late Contest, but what I thought myself indispensably bound to do by the Duty which I owed to my People. I will be very frank with you. I was the last to consent to the Seperation: but the Seperation having been made, and having become inevitable, I have always Said as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the Friendship of the United States as an independent Power. The moment I See Such Sentiments and Language as yours prevail, and a disposition to give to this Country the Preference, that moment I Shall Say let the Circumstances of Language, Religion and blood, have their natural and full Effect.  
I dare not Say, that these Were the Kings precise Words, and it is even possible that I may have in Some Particular, mistaken his meaning for, although his Pronunciation is as distinct, as I ever heard, he hesitated Sometimes between his Periods, and between the Members of the Same Period. He was indeed much affected, and I was not less so, and therefore I cannot be certain, that I was So attentive, heard So clearly and understood So perfectly, as to be confident of all his Words or sense and I think that all which he Said to me, Should at present be kept Secret in America, unless his Majesty or his Secretary of State, Should judge proper to report it.— This I do say, that the foregoing is, his Majestys Meaning as I then understood it, and his own Words, as nearly as I can recollect them.  
The King then asked me, whether I came last from France, and upon my Answering in the Affirmative, he put on an Air of Familiarity, and Smiling or rather laughing Said “There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France.” I was Surpris’d at this, because I thought it, an Indiscretion and a descent from his Dignity. I was a little embarrassed, but determined not to deny the Truth on one hand, nor leave him to infer from it, any Attachment to England on the other, I threw off as much Gravity as I could And assumed an Air of Gaiety and a Tone of Decision, as far as was decent, and said “That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country.[”] The King replied, as quick as lightning “An honest Man will never have any other.”  
The King then Said a Word or two, to the Secretary of State, which being between them I did not hear, and then turn’d round and bow’d to me, as is customary with all Kings and Princes, when they give the Signal to retire. I retreated, Stepping backwards, as is the Ettiquette, and making my last Reverence at the Door of the Chamber, I went my Way. The Master of the Ceremonies joined me, the moment of my coming out of the Kings Closet, and accompanied me, through all the Appartments, down to my Carriage, Several Stages of Servants Gentlemen Porters and Under Porters, roaring out like Thunder as I went along “Mr Adams’s Servants, Mr Adams’s Carriage[”] &amp;c  
I have been thus minute in these details, because they may be usefull to others hereafter to know. The Conversation with the King I Should not dare to withhold from Congress, who will form their own Judgment of it.— I may possibly expect from it a Residence here less painfull, than I once expected, because so marked an Attention from the King will Silence many Grumblers But We can infer nothing from all this concerning the Success of my Mission.  
There is a Train of other Ceremonies to go through, in Presentations to the Queen and Visits to and from Ministers and Ambassadors which will take up much time and interrupt me in my Endeavours to obtain, all that I have at Heart the Objects of my Instructions. Thus it is that the Essence of Things is lost in   
  
  
  
Ceremony,  
in every Country of Europe. We must submit to what We cannot alter. Patience is the only Remedy.  
With great and Sincere Esteem I have the / Honour to be, dear sir, your most obedient / and most humble servant  
  
John Adams

: Bath Hotel, Westminster, June 2, 1785.  
4 Dear Sir,—During my interview with the Mar.  
quis of Carmarthen, he told me that it was cus-  
tomary for every foreign minister at his first pre-  
sentation to the king, to make his majesty some  
compliments conformable tothe spirit of his cre-  
dentials; and when Sir Clement Cottrel Dormer,  
the master of the ceremonies, came to inform me  
that he should accompany me to the Secretary of  
State, and to court, he said that every foreign  
. Minister whom he had attended to the queen, had  
always made a hurangue to her majesty, and he  
understood, thoug!, he had not been present, that  
they always harangued the king. On Tuesday  
’ evening the Baron de Lynden, (Dutch ambassa-  
j dor) called upon me, and said he came from the  
Baron de Nolkin, (Swedish envoy,) and had been  
conversing upon the singular situation I was in,  
and they agreed in opinion that it was indispen-  
sable that | should make a speech, and that it  
should be as complimentary as possible, All this  
was parallel to the advice lately given by the  
Comte de Vergennes to Mr. Jefferson. So that  
finding that it was a custom established at both  
these great courts, and that this court and the fo-  
reign ministers expected it, 1 thought I could not  
avoid it, although my first thought and inclination  
had been to deliver my credentials silently and  
rere. At one, on Wednesday, the Ist of June,  
the master of ceremonies called at my house, and  
went with me to the Secretary of State’s office, in

me, and attended me, while the Secretary of  
State went to take the commands of the king.—  
While I stood in this place, where it seems all  
ministers stand upow such occasions, always at-  
tended by the master of ceremonies, the room  
very full of ministers of state, bishops, and all  
other sorts of courtiers, as well as the next room,  
which is the king’s bed chamber, you may well  
suppose that I was the focus of all eyes. I was  
relieved however from the embarrassment of it,  
by the Swedish and Dutch ministers, who came. to  
me and entertained me in a very agreeable con-  
versation during the whole time. Some other  
gentlemen whom I had seen before, came to make  
their compliments too—until the Marquis of Car-  
marthen returned, and.desired me to go with him  
to his majesty! I went with his lordship through  
the levee room into the king’s closet—the door  
was shut, and I was left with his majesty and the  
Secretary of State alone. I made the three re-  
verenceg one at the door, another about half-way,  
and the third before the presence, according to  
the usage established at this and all the northern  
courts of Europe, and then addressed myself to  
his majesty in the following words:  
  
‘*Sir,—The United States of America have ap-  
pointed me their minister plenipotentiary to your  
majesty, and have directed me to deliver to your  
majesty this letter, which contains the evidence  
of it. It isin obedience to their express com-  
mands, that I have the honor to assure your ma-  
jesty of their unanimous disposition and desire to  
cultivate the most friendly and liberal intercourse  
between your maijesty’s subjects and their citi-  
zens, and of their best wishes for your majesty’s  
health and happiness, and for that of your reyal  
family.  
  
“The appointment of a minister from the Unit-  
ed States to your majesty’s court, will form an  
epacha in the history of England and of America,  
I think myself more fortunate th@p all iny fellow-  
citizens, in having the distinguished honor to be  
the first to stand in your majesty’s royal presence  
in a diplomatic character; and I shall esteem my-  
self the happiest of men if I can be instrumental  
in recommending my country more and more to  
your majesty’s royal benevolence, and of restoring  
an entire esteem, confidence, and affection, or in

good humour,” between people, who though se-  
parated by an ocean and under different govern-

The king listened to every word I said, with  
dignity it is true, but with an apparent emotion.  
Whether it was the nature of the in’erview, or  
whetner it was my visible agitation, for I felt more  
than { did or could express, that touched him, |  
cannot say, but he was much affected, and an  
swered me with more tremor than I had spoken  
with, and said—  
  
“ Sin,—The circumstances of this audience are  
so extraordinary, the language you have now held  
is so extremely proper, and the feelings you have  
discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that  
Fmust say, that | not only receive with pleasure  
the assurances of the friendly disposition of the  
United States, but that I am very glad the chorce  
has fallen upon yon to be their minister. } wish  
you, sir, to believe, and that it may be understvod  
in America, that IT have done nothing in the late  
contest but what 1 thought myself indispensably  
bound to do, by the duty whieh 1 owed to my  
people. Iwill be very frank with you. Iwas the  
last to conform to the separation: but the separa-  
tion having been made, and having become inevi-  
table, I have always said as I say now, that I would  
be the first to meet the friendship of the United  
States as an independent power. The moment I  
see such sentiments and language as yours prevail,  
and a disposition to give this country the prefer-  
ence, that moment I shall say, let the circum-  
stances of language, religion, and blood, have  
their natural and full effect.”  
  
t dare not say that these were the king’s pre  
cise words, and it is even possible that I may  
have in some particular mistaken his meaning;  
for although his pronunciation is as distinct as 1  
ever heard, he hesitated sometimes between his  
periods, and between the members of the same  
period. He was indeed much affected, and 1b was  
not less so, and therefore 1 cannot be certain  
that I was so attentive, heard so clearly, and  
understood so perfectly, as to be confident of all  
his words or sense; and I think that all which he  
said to me should at present be kept secret in|  
America, unless his majesty or his Secretary of |  
State should judge proper to report it. This I  
do say, that the foregoing 1s his majesty’s mean- &#x27;  
ing! as then understood it, and his own words as)  
nearly as I can recollect them |  
  
The king then asked me, whether I came last |  
from France? and upon my answering in the |  
affirmative, he put on an air of familiarity, and |  
smiling, or rather laughing, said, “ there is an}  
opinion among some people that you are not the |  
most attached of all your countrymen to the |  
manners of France.” I was surprised at this,  
because I thought it an indiscretion, and a descent |  
from his dignity. I was a little embarrassed, but  
determined not to deny the truth on one hand,  
nor leave him to infer from it any attachment to!  
England on the other, I threw off&#x27;as much gravi. |  
ty as Ecould, and assumed an arr of gayety, and |  
a tone of decision, as fur as was decent, and said, |  
—* That opinion, Sir, is not mistaken; [ must  
avow to your majesty I have no attachment but |  
to my own country.” Phe king replied as quick |  
as lightning; ‘* an honest man will never have any |  
other.”  
  
The king then said a word or two to the Secre-  
tary of State, which being between them I did  
not hear, and then turned .round and bowed to!

Bath Hotel, Westminster, June 2, 1785.  
  
Dear Sir, |  
During my interview with the marquis  
of Carmarthen, he told me that it was  
customary for every foreign minister at  
his first presentation to the king, to make  
his majesty some compliments conform-  
able to the spirit of his credentials; and  
when Sir Clement Cottrel Dormer, the  
master of the ceremonies, came to inform  
me that he should accompany me to the  
secretary of state, and to court, he said  
that every foreign minister whom he had  
attended to the queen, had always made  
an harangue to her majesty, and he un-  
derstood, though he had not been pre-  
sent, that they always harangued the  
king. On Tuesday evening the baron  
de Lynden (Dutch ambassador) called  
upon me, and said he came from the ba-  
ron de Nolkin (Swedish envoy) and had  
been conversing upon the singular situa-  
tion [ was in, and they agreed in opinion  
that it was indispensable that I should  
make a speech, and that it should be as  
complimentary as possible. All this was  
parallel to the advice lately given by the  
count de Vergennes to Mr. Jefferson.  
So that finding that it was a custom esta-  
blished at both these great courts,and that  
this court and the foreign ministers ex-  
pected it, I thought I could not avoid it,  
although my first thought and inclination  
had been to deliver my credentials si-  
lently and retire. At one on Wednes-  
day, the first of June, the master of cere-  
monies called at my house, and went  
with me to the secretary of state’s office,  
in Cleveland Row, where the marquis of  
Carmarthen received me, and introduced  
me to Mr. Frazier, his under secretary,  
who had been, as his lordship said, unin-  
terruptedly in that office, through all the  
changes in administration, for thirty  
years, having first been appointed by  
the earl of Holderness. fer a short  
conversation upon the subject of import-  
ing my effects from Holland and France  
free of duty, which Mr. Frazier himself  
introduced, lord Carmarthen invited me  
to go with him in his coach to court.  
When we arrived in the antichamber,  
the CEil de Beuf of St. James, the mas-  
ter of the ceremonies met me, and at-  
tended me, while the secretary of state  
went to take the commands of the king.

sions, always attended by the master of  
ceremonies, the room very full of minis-  
ters of state, bishops, and all other sorts  
of courtiers, as well as the next room,  
which is the king’s bed chamber, you may  
well suppose that I was the focus of all  
eyes.  
  
I was relieved however from the em-  
barrassment of it, by the Swedish and  
Dutch ministers, who came to me and  
entertained me in a very agreeable con-  
versation during the whole time. Some  
other gentlemen whom I had seen before,  
came to make their compliments too—  
until the marquis of Carmarthen return-  
ed, and desired me to go with him to his  
majesty! I went with his lordship through  
the levee room into the king’s closet; the  
door was shut, and I was left with his  
majesty and the secretary of state alone.  
{ made the three reverences; one at the  
door, another about half way, and the  
third before the presence, accerding to  
the usage established at this and all the  
northern courts of Europe, and then ad-  
dressed myself to his majesty in the fol-  
lowing words:  
  
“Sir—The United States of America  
have appointed me their minister pleni-  
potentiary to your majesty, and have di-  
rected me to deliver to your majesty  
this letter, which contains the evidence  
of it. It is in obedience to their express  
commands, that I have the honour to as-  
sure your majesty of their unanimous  
disposition and desire to cultivate the  
most friendly and liberal intercourse be-  
tween your majesty’s subjects and their  
citizens, and of their best wishes for  
your majesty’s health and happiness, and  
for that of your royal family.  
  
“The appointment of a minister from  
the United States to your majesty’s  
court, will form an epocha in the history  
of England and America. I think my-  
self more fortunate than all my fellow  
citizens, in having the distinguished ho-  
nour to be the first to stand in your  
majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic  
character; and I shall esteem myself the  
happiest of men if I can be instrumental  
in recommending my country more and  
more to your majesty’s royal benevolence,  
and of restoriug an entire esteem, confi-  
dence, and affection, or in better words,  
“the old good nature, and the old good  
humour,” between people, who though  
separated by.an ocean, and under differ-  
  
  
  
  
  
ent governments, have the same lan-  
guage, a similar religion, and kindred  
blood. I beg your majesty’s permission  
to add, that although I have sometimes  
before been entrusted by my country, it  
was never in my whole life in a manner  
so agreeable to myself.”  
  
The king listened to every word I  
said, with dignity it is true, but with an  
apparent emotion. Whether it was the  
nature of the interview, or whether it  
was my visible agitation, for I felt more  
than I did or could express, that touch-  
ed him, I cannot say, but he was much  
affected, and answered me with more  
tremor than I had spoken with, and said,  
  
“Sir—The circumstances of this au-  
dience are so extraordinary, the language  
you have now held is so extremely pro-  
per, and the feelings you have discover-  
ed so justly adapted to the occasion, that  
I must say, that I not only receive with  
pleasure the assurances of the friendly  
disposition of the United States, but that  
I am very glad the choice has fallen upon  
you to be their minister. I wish you,  
sir, to believe, and that it may be under-  
stood in America, that I have done no-  
thing in the late contest but what I  
thought myself indispensably bound to  
do, by the duty which I owed to my peo-  
ple. I will be very frank with you. I  
was the last to conform to the separa-  
tion: but the separation having been  
made, and having become inevitable, I  
have always said as I say now, that I  
would be the first to meet the friendship  
of the United States as an independent  
power.—The moment I see such senti-  
ments and language as yours prevail,  
and a disposition to give this country  
the preference, that moment I shall say,  
let the circumstances of language, reli-  
  
ion, and blood, have their natural’and  
full effect.”  
  
I dare not say that these were the  
king’s precise words, and it is even pos-  
sible that I may have in some particular  
mistaken his meaning; for although his  
  
ronunciation isas distinctas I ever heard,  
  
e hesitated sometimes between his pe-  
riods, and between the members of the  
same period. He was indeed much af-  
fected, and I was not less so, and there-  
fore I cannot be certain that I was so  
attentive, heard so clearly, and under-  
stood so perfectly, as to be confident of  
all his words or sense; and I think that

all which he said to me should at present  
be kept secret in America, unless his  
majesty or his secretary of state should  
judge proper to report it. This I do  
say, that the foregoing is his majesty’s  
meaning, as I then understood it, and  
his own words as nearly as I can re-  
collect them.  
  
The king then asked me, whether I  
came last from France? and upon my  
answering in the affirmative, he put on  
an air of familiarity, and smiling, or  
rather laughing, oe | “there is an opi-  
nion among some people that you are  
not the most attached of all your coun-  
trymen to the manners of France.” I  
was surprised at this, because I thought  
it an indiscretion, and a descent from  
his dignity. I was a little embarrassed,  
but determined not to deny the truth  
on one hand, nor leave him to infer from  
it any attachment to England on the  
  
other, I threw off as much gravity as |  
  
T could, and assumed an air of gaiety,  
  
and a tone of decision, as far as was de- |  
  
cent, and said,—‘ that opinion, sir, is  
not mistaken; I must avow to your  
majesty I have no attachment but to my  
own country.” The king replied as quick  
as lightning, “an honest man will never  
have any other.”  
  
The king then said a word or two to  
the secretary of state, which being be-  
tween them, I did not hear, and then  
turned round and bowed to me as is  
customary with all kings and princes,  
when they give the signal to retire. I  
retreated, stepping backwards, as is the  
etiquette, and making my last reverence  
at the door of the chamber, I went my  
way; the master of the ceremonies join-  
ed me the moment of my coming out of  
the king’s closet, and accompanied me  
through all the apartments, down to my  
carriage, several stages of servants, gen-  
tleman porters, and under porters, roar-  
ing out like thunder, as I went along,

riage,” &amp;c.

tails, because they may be useful to  
others hereafter to know. The conver-  
sation with the king I should not dare  
to withhold from congress, who will form  
their own judgment of it. I may possibly  
experience from it a residence here less  
‘painful than I once expected, because so  
  
marked an attention from the king will

‘« At one, on Wednesday, the first of June (says Mr. Adams),  
the master of the ceremonies called at my house, and went with  
me to the Secretary of State’s office, in Cleveland-row, where the  
Marquis of Carmarthen received me, and introduced me to Mr.  
Frazier, his under-secretary, who had been, as his Lordship said,  
uninterruptedly in that office, through all the changes in admin-  
istration, for thirty years, having first been appointed by the  
Earl of Holderness. After a short conversation upon the subject  
of importing my effects from Holland and France, free of duty,  
which Mr. Frazier himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen invited  
me to go with him in his coach to court. When we arrived in the  
ante-chamber, the master of the ceremonies met me, and attended  
me, while the Secretary of State went to take the commands of  
the King. While I stood in this place, where it seems all ministers  
stand upon such occasions, always attended by the master of the  
ceremonies, the room very full of ministers of state, bishops, and  
all other sorts of courtiers, as well as the next room, which is the  
King’s bed-chamber, you may well suppose that I was the focus of  
all eyes. I was relieved, however, from the embarrassment of it,

‘¢ The appointment of a minister from the United States to  
your Majesty’s court will form an epoch in the history of England  
and America. I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow-  
citizens, in having the distinguished honour to be the first to stand  
in your Majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic character ; and I  
shall esteem myself the happiest of men if I can be instrumental in  
recommending my country more and more to your Majesty’s royal  
benevolence, and of restoring an entire esteem, confidence, and  
affection; or, in better words, ‘ the old good nature, and the good  
old humour,’ between people, who, though separated by an ocean,  
and under different governments, have the same language, a similar  
religion, a kindred blood. I beg your Majesty’s permission to  
add, that although I have sometimes before been intrusted by my  
omy it was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to  
myself.  
  
‘ee The King listened to every word I said, with dignity it is  
true, but with an apparent emotion. Whether it was the nature  
of the interview, or whether it was my visible agitation, for I felt  
more than I did or could express, that touched him, I cannot  
say; but he was much affected, and answered me with more  
tremour than I had spoken with, and said—  
  
¢ « Sir, — The circumstances of this audience are so extraordi-  
nary, the language you have now held is so extremely proper, and  
the feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion,  
that I must say, that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance  
of the friendly disposition of the United States, but that I am glad  
the choice has fallen upon you to be their minister. I wish you,  
Sir, to believe, and that it may be understood in America, that I  
have done nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself  
indispensably bound to do, by the duty which I owed to my people.  
I will be very frank with you. ‘I was the last to conform to the separ-  
ation ; but the separation having been made, and having become  
inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the  
first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent  
power. ThemomentIsee such sentiments and language as yours  
prevail, and a disposition to give this country the preference, that  
moment I shall say, let the circumstances of language, religion,  
and blood, have their natural and full effect.”  
  
‘ « T dare not say that these were the King’s precise words: and  
it is even possible that I may have in some particular mistaken his  
meaning ; for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I ever  
heard, he hesitated sometimes between his periods, and between  
members of the same period. He was, indeed, much affected, and  
I was not less so, and therefore I cannot be certain that I was so  
attentive, heard so clearly, and understood so perfectly, as to be  
confident of all his words or sense; and I think that all which he  
said to me should at present be kept secret in America, unless his  
Majesty, or his Secretary of State, should judge proper to report it.

then understood it, and his own words, as nearly as I can recollect

levee-room into the king’s closet—the door was shut, and I was  
left with his majesty a the secretary of state alone. I made the  
three reverences; one at the door, another about half way, and the  
third before the presence, according to the usage established at  
this and all the northern courts of Europe, and then addressed my-  
self to his majesty in the following words:  
  
“Srr,—The United States of America have appointed me Mi-  
nister-plenipotentiary to your majesty, and have directed me to  
deliver to your majesty this letter, which contains the evidence of  
it. Itis in obedience to their express commands, that I have the  
honour to assure your majesty of their unanimous disposition and  
desire to cultivate the most friendly and liberal intercourse be-  
tween your majesty’s subjects and their citizens, and of their best  
wishes for your majesty’s health and happiness, and for that of your  
roval family.  
  
« The appointment of a minister from the United States to your  
majesty’s court will form an epoch in the history of England and  
America. I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citi-  
zens, in having the distinguished honour to be the first te stand in  
your majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic character; and I shall  
esteem myself the happiest of men if I can be instrumental in re-  
commending my country more and more to your majesty’s royal  
benevolence, and of restoring an entire esteem, confidence, and  
affection; or, in better words, ‘the old good nature, and the good  
old humour,’ between people, who, though separated by an ocean,  
and under different governments, have the same language, a similar  
religion, a kindred blood. I beg your majesty’s permission to  
add, that although I have sometimes before been entrusted by my  
country, it was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable  
to myself.”  
  
‘The king listened to every word I said, with dignity it is true,  
but with an apparent emotion. Whether it was the nature of the  
interview, or whether it was my visible agitation, for I felt more  
than I did or could express, that touched him, I cannot say; but  
he was much affected, and answered me with more tremour than  
[ had spoken with and said—  
  
“Srr.—The circumstances of this audience are so extraordi-  
aary, the language you have now held is so extremely proper, and  
the feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion,  
that I must say that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance  
of the friendly disposition of the United States, but that I am glad  
the choice has fallen upon you to be their minister. I wish you,  
Sir, to believe, and that it may be understood in America, that I  
have done nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself  
indispensably bound to do, by the duty which I owed to my people.  
I will be very frank with you. I was the last to conform to the se-  
paration; but the separation having been made, and having become  
inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that [ would be the

first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent  
power. The moment I see such sentiments and language as yours  
prevail, and a disposition to give this country the preference, that  
moment I shall say, let the circumstances of language, religion,  
and blood, have their natural and full effect.”  
  
I dare not say that these were the king’s precise words: and it  
is even possible that I may have in some particular mistaken his  
meaning; for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I ever  
heard, he hesitated sometimes between his periods, and between  
members of the same period. He was, indeed, much affected, and  
{ was not less so, and therefore I cannot be certain that I was so  
attentive, heard so clearly, and understood so perfectly, as to be  
confident of all his words or sense; and I think that all which he  
said to me should at present be kept secret in America, unless his  
majesty, or his secretary of state, should judge proper to report it.  
This I do say, that the foregoing is his majesty’s meaning, as I  
then understood it,and his own words, as nearly as I can recollect  
them. Iam, &amp;c.

my elf the happiest of men if I can he in­

more and more to your majesty’s loyal  
benevolence, mid of restoring an entire es­  
ti m, eonlidiuiee, and alleetimi ; or ill other  
words, ‘ the old good nature, and the good

m ijesty’s permission to add that although  
I have sometimes before hc.cn entrUstiul iiv  
iny country, il was never in my whole  
life in a manner so agreeable to my self.”  
The king listened to every wind I said,  
With dignity it is true, hut with an apparent  
emotion. Whether it was the nature of  
the in ten iexv, or w Ini her it was in y x isil h:  
agitation, for I If It more than I did or could  
express, that touched hint, I cannot say ;  
hut he was much afliu led, and answered  
me with more tremor than I had spoken  
w ith, and s id,  
“Sir—The circumstances of this audi­  
ence are o i xtraordinury, the language you  
luue now held is so extremely proper, and  
the fi l ling you liar e discovered so justly  
adapted to the occasion, that I must say  
that 1 not only receive witli pleasure the  
assurance of the friendly disposition of the  
United States, hot that I am glad the  
choice has fallen upon you to lie tlo ir mi­  
nister. I wish you, sir, to hellere and that  
il may he understood in America, that I j  
hare done nolhing is the lat. contest h t  
what i thought my . If indispensably hound  
to do |»y tin duty wInch I owed to my peo­  
ple.—1 w ill he r cry I&#x27;r.nik with you. I was j  
tile last to conform to the separation ; Ini!  
the separation Inn iug; la en made, and ha­  
ving become inevitable, I have always  
said, as Isay now, that I would he the first  
to iiii i t the friendship of the United State  
as an independent power. Tin- moment I

pn v i , mid u dis; motion to give this coun­  
try the preference, that moment I shall sax,

1 dare not say that these w ere the king&#x27;s  
precise words ; and it is &lt; ten possible that  
I may have in sonn particular mistaken Ins  
meaning ; lor although Ins pronunciation  
is as distinct as I ever In id, he heiitutisl

At one, on Wednesday the first June, (says Mr. Adams) the  
master of ceremonies called at my house, went with me to the  
Secretary of State’s office, in Cleaveland-row, where the Marquis  
of Carmarthen received me, and introduced me to Mr. Frazier, his  
under secretary, who had been, as his lordship said, uninterrupted-  
ly in that office through all the changes in administration for thirty  
years, having first been appointed by the Earl of Holderness.  
  
After a short conversation upon the subject of importing my  
effects from Holland and France, free of duty, which Mr. Fra-  
zier himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen invited me to go with  
him in his coach to court. When we arrived in the antechambers,  
the master of the ceremonies introduced me, and attended me,  
while the Secretary of State went to take the commands of the  
King. While | stood in this place, where it seems all ministers  
stand upon such occasions, always attended by the master of the  
ceremonies, the room very full of ministers of state, bishops and  
all other sorts of courtiers, as well as the next room, which is the  
King’s bed-chamber, you may well suppose that I was the focus of  
alleyes. I was relieved, however, from the embarrassment of it, by  
the Swedish and Dutch ministers; who came to me, and entertain-

their compliments too, until the Marquis of Carmarthen returned  
and desired me to go with him to his Majesty. I went with his  
lordship, through the levee-room to the King’s closet—the door  
was shut, and I was left with his Majesty and the secretary of state  
alone. I made the three reverences; one at the door, another  
about half way, and the third before the presence, according to the  
usage established at this and all the northern courts of Europe, and  
then addressed myself to His Majesty in the following werds :—  
  
** Sire— The United States have appointed me Minister plenipo-.  
tentiary to your Majesty, and have directed me to deliver to your  
Majesty this letter, which contains the evidence of it. It is in obe-  
dience to their express commands, that I have the honor to assure  
your Majesty of their unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate  
the most friendly and liberal intercourse between your Majesty’s  
subjects and their citizens, and of their best wishes for your Majes-  
ty’s health and happiness, and for that of your family.”  
  
‘* The appointment of a minister from the United States to your  
Majesty’s court will form an epoch in the history of England and  
America. I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens,  
in having the distinguished honor to be the first to stand in your  
Majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic character; and | shall es-  
teem myself the happiest of men if 1 can be instrumental in recom-  
mending my country more and more to your Majesty’s royal beney-  
olence, and of restoring an entire esteem, conlidence, and affection ;  
or in better words ‘the good old nature, and tie good old humor,’  
between people, who, though separated by an ocean, and under dif-  
ferent governments, have the same language, a similar religion, a  
kindred blood. { beg your Majesty’s permission to add, that al-  
though I have sometimes before been intrusted by my country, it  
was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to myself.”  
  
The King listened to every word I said, with dignity it is true,  
but with an apparent emotion; whether it was the nature of the in-  
terview, or whether it was my visible agitation, for I felt more than  
I could express, that touched him, | cannot say; but he became much  
affected, and answered me with more tremour than I had spoken  
with, and said :—  
  
“ Sir—The circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary,  
the language you have now held is so extremely proper, and the  
feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that  
I must say, that I nofiify receive with pleasure the assurance of

choice has fallen upon you to be their minister. I wish your sir,  
to beleive, and that it may be understood in America, that I have  
done nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself indis-  
pensably bound to do, by the duty which I owed to my people. I  
will be very frank with you. I was the last to conform to the sep-  
aration; but the separation having been made and having become  
inevitable, 1 have always said, as | now say, that 1 would be the  
first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent  
power. ‘I&#x27;he moment I See such sentiments and language as your’s  
prevail and a disposition to give this country the preference, that  
moment I shall say, let the circumstances of language, religion, and  
blood have their natural and full effect.”  
  
I dare not say that these were the king’s precise words: and  
it is even possible that I may have in some particulars mistaken his  
meaning, for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I ever  
heard, he hesitated sometimes betweep members of the same peri-  
od. He was, indeed, much affected, and 1 was not less so, and  
therefore I cannot be certain that I was so attentive, heard so  
clearly, and understood so perfectly, as to be confident of all his  
words or sense ; and I think that all he said to me should at pres-  
ent be kept secret in America, except his majesty or his secretary of  
state, should judge proper to repeatit. This 1 dosay, that the fore-  
going is his majesty’s meaning, as I then understood it, and his own  
words, as nearly as I can recollect them.  
  
The king then asked me whether I came last from France ;  
and upon my answering in the affirmative, he put on an air of fa-  
miliarity, and smiling said, * there is an opinion among some people  
that you are not the most attached of all your countrymen to the  
manners of France.’ I was surprised at this, because I thought it  
an indiscretion, and a descent from his dignity. I was a little em-  
barrassed, but determined not to deny the truth on the one hand,  
nor lead him to infer from it any attachment to England on the  
other. I threw off as much gravity as I could, and assumed an air  
of gayety, and a tone of decision, as far as was decent, and said,  
‘That opinion, sir, is not mistaken. I must avow to your majesty,  
[have no attachment but to my own country.’ The king replied  
as quick as lightning: * An honest man will never have any other.’  
  
The king then said a word or two to the secretary of state,  
which, being between them, I did not hear ; and then turned round,  
and bowed to me, as is customary with all kings and princes when  
they give the signal to retire. I retreated, stepping backwards, as

the moment of my coming out of the king’s closet, and accompani-

importing my effects from Holland and France, tree  
of duty, which Mr Frazier himself introduced,  
Lord Carmarthen invited me to go with him in iris  
coach to court. When we arrived in the anti­  
chambers, the master of the ceremonies introduced  
me. and attended me, while the Secretary of State  
went to take the commands of the King. While  
I stood in this place, where it seems all ministers  
stand upon such occasions, always attended by the  
master of the ceremonies, the room very full of  
ministers of stale, bishops, and all ether sorts of  
courtiers, as well at the next room, which is the  
King&#x27;s bed chamber, you may well suppose that I  
was the focus of all eyes. I was relieved, however,  
from the embarrassment of it, by the Swedish and  
Dutch ministers; who came to me and entertained  
me with a very agreeable conversation during the  
whole time. Some other gentlemen, whom I had  
seen before, came to make their compliment» too  
until the Marquis of Carmarthen returned, and de  
sired me to go with him to his Majesty. I  
with his Lordship, through the levee room into the  
King&#x27;s closet—the door was shut, and I was left  
with His Majesty and the Secretary of State alone  
I made the three reverences ; one at the door, ano­  
ther »bout half way. and the third before the pre  
sence, according to the usage established at this and  
all the northern courts ot Europe, and then addres­  
sed myself to His Majesty in the following words :  
&quot;Sire—The United States have appointed  
Minister Plenipotentiary to your majesty, and have  
directed me to deliver to your majesty this letter,  
which contains the evidence of it.  
ence to their express commands, that I have the  
honor to assure your majesty of their unanimous  
disposition and desire to cultivate the most friendly  
and liberal intercourse between your majesty&#x27;s sub  
jects and their citizens, and of their best wishes for  
your Majesty&#x27;s health and happiness, and for that  
of your family.  
&quot; The appointment of a minister from the United  
Slates to your majesty&#x27;s court will form an epoch  
in the history of England and America. I think  
mysell more fortunate than all my fellow citizens,  
in having the distinguished honor to be the first to  
stand in your majesty&#x27;s royal presence in a diplo­  
matic character ; and I shall esteem myself the  
happiest of men if I can be instrumental in recom­  
mending my country more and more to your ma­  
jesty&#x27;s royal benevolence, and of restoring an entire  
esteem, confidence and affection : or in better words,  
&#x27; the °ld good nature, and the good old humor,&#x27;  
between people, who,though separated by  
and under different governments, have the  
language, a similar religion, a kindred blood,  
your majesty&#x27;s permission to add, that although Î  
have some times before been instructed by my  
country, it was never in my whole life in a tnanner  
so agreeable to myself.&quot;  
&quot;The king listened to every word I said, with  
dignity, it is true, but with apparent emotion ;  
whether it was the nature of the interview,  
whether it was my visible agitation, for I felt  
than I could expre*9, that touched him, I  
aay ; but he was much affected, and answered me  
with more tremor than I had spoken with, and  
said :—

&quot; I dare not say that these were the king&#x27;s p re ,  
cise words ; and if is even possible that I may harj  
in tome particulars mistaken his meaning, f or  
although his pronunciation is as distinct as I  
heard, he hesitated some times between members  
of the same period. He was, ihdeed, much affect­  
ed, and I was not less so, and therefore I cannot be  
certain that I was so attentive, heard so clearly, and  
understood so perfectly, as to be confident of all  
his words or sense ; and I think that all which be  
said to me should at present be kept secret in \.  
merica, except his majesty or his secretary of state  
should judge proper to report it—This I do say  
that the foregoing is his majesty&#x27;s meaning, is j  
then understood it, and his own words,

&quot;The king then asked me whether I  
f . ca me last  
from Prance ; and upon my answering in the affirm,,

rather lau  
ghing, said, &#x27; there is an opinion anion?  
some people that you are not the most attacbed of  
all your countrymen, to the manners ol Frame &#x27; I  
was surprised at this, because 1 thought it an indis­  
cretion, and a descent from his dignity. I wss ,  
little embarrassed, but determined not to deny the  
truth on the one hand, nor lead him to infer irom it  
any attachment to England on the other.—I threw  
off as much gravity as I could, and assumed an air  
of gaycty, and a tone cii decision, as far as was decent,  
and aaid, • That opinion, sir, is not mistaken, j  
must avow to your majesty, 1 have no attachment  
but to my owncountry.&#x27; The king replied a» quick  
as lightning : • An honest man will never have  
other &#x27;  
&quot; The king then said a word or two to the  
tary of state, which, being between them, I did  
hear ; and then turned round, and bowed to me, as  
is customary with ail kings and princes, when they  
give « he signal to retire. I retreated, stepping  
backwards, as is the etiquette ; and making my last  
reverence at the door of the chamber, 1 went my  
way. The master of the ceremonies joined n.c the  
moment of my coming out of the king&#x27;s closet, and  
accompanied me through all the apartments down  
to my carnage ; several stages ol servants, gentle­

of which he was accused.” |  
  
“At one on Wednesday the 1st of i  
June, (says Mr Adams) the master I  
of ceremonies called at my house, |  
and went with me to the secretary of |  
State’s office, in Cleveland-row,  
where the Marquis of Carmarthen I  
received me, and introduced me to |  
Mr F razier, his under secretary,  
who had been, as his lordship said, i  
uninterruptedly in that office through  
all the changes in administration for  
thirty years, having first been ap¬  
pointed by the Earl of llolderness.  
  
“After a short conversation upon  
the subject of importing my effects |  
from Holland and France, free of&#x27;  
duty, which Mr Frazier himself in- |  
troduced, Lord Carmarthen invited I  
me to go with him in his coach to  
court. When we arrived in the anti¬

while the secretary of state went to

through the levee room into the  
King’s closet—the door was shut,  
and 1 was left with His 31ajesty and  
the Secretary of State alone. 1 made  
the three reverences; one at the  
door, another about half w ay, and  
the third before the presence, accord¬

my country, it wiis never in iny .  
whole life in a manner so agreeable  
to myself.” {  
  
“The king listened to every word j  
1 said, with dignity it is true, but j  
with an apparent emotion; whether l|  
it was the nature of the interview’, or  
whether it was my visible agitation, ;

he w as much atfected, and answered i

the assurance of the friendly dispo- ji  
sition of the preference, that moment jj  
I shall say, let the circumstances of ;

“I dare not say these were the  
king’s precise words; and it is even  
possible that I may have in some  
particulars mistaken his meainng, |  
for although his pronunciation is as  
distinct as I ever heard, he hesi- I

fectly,&#x27; as to be conlident of ail his ■  
words orsen.se; and I think that all i  
w hich he said to me should at pre¬  
sent be kept secret in America, ex¬  
cept his majesty or his secretary of  
state should judge proper to report it.  
This I do say, that the foregoing is  
his majesty’s meaning, as I then un¬  
derstood it, and his own words, as  
nearly as I can recollect them.  
  
“The king then asked me wheth¬  
er I came last from France; and up¬  
on my answ ering in the affirmative,  
he put on an air of familiarity, and j  
smiling, or rather laughing, said, j  
‘there is an opinion among some &#x27;  
  
people that you are not the most at¬  
tached of all your countrymen, to  
the manners of France.’ 1 w as sur¬  
prised at this, because I thought it  
an indiscretion, and a descent from  
his dignity. I was a little embar¬  
rassed, but determined not to deny  
the truth on the one hand, nor lead  
him to infer from it any attachment  
to England on the other.—I threw

replied as cpiick as lightning : ‘ An

** Bath Hotel, Westminster, June 2, 1785.  
  
Dear Sir:  
  
‘During my interview with the Marquis of Carmarthen, he told me  
that it was customary for every foreign Minister, at his first presentation  
to the King, to make his Majesty some compliments conformable to the  
spirit of his credentials, and when Sir Clement Cottre] Dormer, the mas-  
ter of the ceremonies came to inform me that he should accompany me to  
the Secretary of State, and to Court, he said that every foreign Minister  
whom he had attended to the Queen, had always made a harangue to her  
Majesty, and he understood, though he had not heen present, that they  
always harangued the King.

he came from the Baron de Nolken, and had been conversing upon the  
singular situation I was sent in, and agreed in opinion that it was indis-  
pensable that I should make a speech, and that it should be as compli-  
mentary as possible; all this was parallel to the advice lately given by the  
Count de Vergennes to Mr. Jefferson, so that finding it was a custom  
established at both these great courts, and that this court and the foreign  
Ministers expected it, I thought I could not avoid it, although my first  
thought and inclination had been to deliver my credentials silently and  
retire.  
  
** At one, on Wednesday, the first of June, the Master of Ceremonies  
called at my house, and went with me to the Secretary of State’s office, in  
Cleveland Row, where the Marquis of Carmarthen received me and intro-  
duced me to his under secretary, Mr. Frazier, who has been, as his  
lordship said, uninterrupted in that office through all the changes in ad-  
ministration for thirty years, having first been appointed by the Earl of  
Holderness. After a short conversation upon the subject of importing  
my effects from Holland and France free of duty, which Mr. Frazier  
himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen invited me to go with him in his  
coach to court. When we arrived in the antichamber, the Oeil de Boeuf,  
of St. James’s, the Master of the Ceremonies met me and attended me,  
‘while the Secretary of State went to take the commands of the King.  
While I stood in this place, where it seems all Ministers stand upon such  
occasions, always attended by the Master of Ceremonies, the room very  
full of Ministers of State, Bishops and all other sorts of courtiers, as  
well as the next room, whichis the King’s bed-chamber, you may well  
suppose 1 was the focus of all eyes. I was relieved, however, from the  
embarrassment of it by the Swedish and Dutch Ministers, who came to  
me, and entertained me in a very agreeable conversation during the whole  
time. Some other gentlemen whom I had seen before, came to make their  
compliments to me, until the Marquis of Carmarthen returned and de-  
sired me to go withhim to his Majesty. I went with his lordship through  
the levee room into the King’s closet. The door was shut, and I was  
left with his Majesty and the Secretary of State, alone; I made the three  
reverences, one at the door, another about half way, and the third before  
the presence, according to the usage established at this and all the northern  
courts of Europe, and then addressed myself to his Majesty in the fol-  
lowing words:  
  
‘© *Sin—: The United States of America have appointed me their Minis-  
ter Plenipotentiary to your Majesty, and have directed me to deliver to  
your Majesty this letter, which contains the evidence of it. It is in obe-  
dience to their express commands, that I have the honour to assure your  
Majesty of their unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the most  
friendly and liberal intercourse between your Majesty’s subjects and their  
citizens, and of their best wishes for your Majesty’s health and happiness,  
and that of your royal family. The appointment of a Minister from the  
United States to your Majesty’s court, will form an epoch in the history  
of England and America. 1 think myself more fortunate than all my fel-  
low-citizens in having the distinguished honour to be the first to stand in  
your Majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic character, and shall esteem  
myself the happiest of men if 1 can be instrumental in recommending my  
country more and more to your Majesty’s royal benevolence, and of restor-  
ing an entire esteem, confidence and affection, or in better words, the old  
good nature and the old good humour, between people, who, though sepa-  
rated by an ocean, and under different governments, have the same lan-  
guage, a similar religion, and kindred blood.  
  
*¢¢+] beg your Majesty’s permission to add, that although I have some  
  
  
  
  
  
188 Diplomatic Correspondence of [September,  
  
time before been intrusted by my country, it was never in my whole life  
in a manner so agreeable to myself.’  
  
«The King listened to every word I said with dignity, but with an ap-  
  
arent emotion. Whether it was the nature of the interview, or whether  
it was my visible agitation, for I felt more than I did or could express,  
that touched him, I cannot say; but he was much affected, and answered  
me with more tremor than I had spoken with, and said:  
  
‘¢¢Sin:—The circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary, the  
language you have now held is so extremely proper, and the feelings you  
have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that I must say, that I  
not only receive with pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispositions of  
the United States, but that I am very glad the choice has fallen upon you  
to be their Minister. I wish you, Sir, to believe, and that it may be under-  
stood in America, that I have done nothing in the late contest, but what I  
thought myself indispensably bound to do, by the duty which I owed to  
my people. I will be very frank with you. I was the last to consent to  
the separation; but the separation having been made, and having become  
inevitable, I have always said as I say now, that I would be the first to  
meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power. The  
moment I see such sentiments and language as yours prevail, and a dis-  
  
osition to give to this country the preference, that moment I shall say,  
et the circumstances of language, religion, and blood, have their natural  
and full effect.’  
  
‘*] dare not say that these were the King’s precise words, and it is even  
possible that I may have in some particular mistaken his meaning, for  
although his pronunciation is as distinct as I ever heard, he hesitated some  
time between his periods, and between the members of the same period.  
He was much affected, and I was not less so, and therefore I cannot be  
certain that I was so attentive, heard so clearly, and understood so per-  
fectly, as to be confident of all his words or sense, and I think that all  
which he said to me should at present be kept a secret in America, unless  
his Majesty or his Secretary of State should judge proper to report it.  
This I do say, that the foregoing is his Majesty’s meaning as I then under-  
stood it, and his own words as nearly as I can recollect them. The King  
then asked me whether I came last from France, and upon answering in  
the affirmative, he put on an air of familiarity, and smiling, or rather laugh-  
ing, said, there is an opinion among some people, that you are not the  
most attached of all your countrymen to the manners of France. I was  
surprised at this, because I thonght it an indiscretion and a departure from  
the dignity. I was a little embarrassed, but determined not to deny the  
truth on the one hand, nor Jeave him to infer from it any attachment to  
England on the other. I threw off as much gravity as I could, and as-  
sumed an air of gaiety and a tone of decision, as far as was decent, and  
said, that opinion, Sir, is not mistaken: I must avow to your Majesty, I  
have no attachment but to my own country. The King replied, as quick  
as lightning, an honest (man) will never have any other. ‘The King then  
said a word or two to the Secretary of State, which, being between them,  
I did not hear, and then turned and bowed to me, as is customary with all  
= and Princes when they give the signal to retire.  
  
‘“‘T retreated, stepping backward, as is the etiquette; ard, making my  
Jast reverence at the door of the chamber, I went my way.  
  
«The Master of the Ceremonies joined me the moment of my coming  
out of the yf closet, and accompanied me through the apartments to  
my carriage. Ihave been thus minute as it may be useful to others here-  
after.

ment of. I may expect from it a residence less painful than I once  
expected, as so marked an attention from the King will silence many  
grumblers; but we can infer nothing from all this concerning the success  
of my mission. There are a train of other ceremonies to go through. The  
Queen, and visits to and from Ministers and Ambassadors, which will take  
up much time, and interrupt me in my endeavours to obtain what I have  
at heart, the object of my instructions. It is thus the essence of things  
is lost in ceremony in every country in Europe. We must submit to  
what we cannot alter. Patience is the only remedy.

‘Baru Horet, Westminster, JuNE 2, 1785.  
  
‘ Dear Sir,—During my interview with the Marquis of Carmar-  
then, he told mt: it was ¢ ustomary for every foreign minister, at  
his first presentation to the King, to make his Majesty some com-  
pliments, conformably to the spirit of his credentials, and when  
Sir Clement Cottre) Dormer, the master of the ceremonies,  
came to inform me, that he should accompany me to the Secre-  
tary of State and to Court, he said that every foreign minister,  
whom he had attended to the Queen, had always made an ha-  
rangue to her Majesty, and he understood, though he had not  
been present, that the y always harangued the King.  
  
‘On Tuesday evening, the Baron de Lynden called upon me,  
and said he came from the Baron de Nolken, and had been con-  
versing upon the singular situation [ was in, and agreed in opin-  
ion, that it was indispensable I should make a speech, and that  
it should be as complimentary as possible. All this was parallel  
to the advice lately given by the Count de Vergennes to Mr.  
Jefferson ; so that, finding it was a custom established at both  
these great courts, and that this Court and the foreign ministers  
expected it, I thought [ could not avoid it, although my first  
thought and inclination had been, to deliver my credentials si-  
lently, and retire.  
  
‘At.one, on Wednesday, the first of June, the master of cere-  
monies called at my house, and went with me to the Secretary  
of State’s office, in Cleveland Row, where the Marquis of Car-  
marthen received me, and introduced me to his under Secretary,  
Mr. Frazier, who has been, as his Lordship said, uninterrupted  
in that office, through all the changes in administration, for thir-  
ty years, having first been appointed by the Earl of Holderness.  
After a short conversation upon the subject of importing my

effects from Holland and France free of duty, which Mr. Frazier  
himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen invited me to go with him  
in his coach to Court. When we arrived in the anti-chamber,  
the Ocil-de-Boeuf, of St. James’s, the master of the ceremonies  
met me and attended me, while the Secretary went to take the  
commands of the King. While I stood in this place, where it  
seems all ministers stand upon such occasions, always attended  
by the master of ceremonies, the room very full of ministers of  
State, Bishops, and all other sorts of courtiers, as well as the  
next room, which is the King’s bed-chamber, you may well sup-  
pose, I was the focus of all eyes. I was relieved, however, from  
the embarrassment of it, by the Swedish and Dutch ministers,  
who came to me, and entertained me in a very agreeable con-  
versation, during the whole time. Some other gentlemen whom  
I had seen before, came to make their compliments to me, until  
the Marquis of Carmarthen returned, and desired me to go with  
him to his Majesty. 1 went with his Lordship through the levée  
room into the King’s closet. The door was shut, and I was left  
with his Majesty and the Secret: ary of State alone. I made the  
three reverences, one at the door, another about half way, and  
the third before the presence, according to the usage established  
at this and all the northern courts of Europe, and then addressed  
myself to his Majesty, in the following words:  
  
‘*¢ Sir—The United States of America have appointed me their  
Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty, and have directed me  
to deliver to your Majesty this letter, which contains the evidence  
of it. It is in obedience to their express command, that I have  
the honor to assure your Majesty of their unanimous disposition  
and desire to cultivate the most friendly and liberal intercourse  
between your Majesty’s subjects and their citizens, and of their  
best wishes for your Majesty’s health and happiness, and that of  
your royal family. ‘The appointment of a minister from the  
United States to your Majesty’s Court will form an epoch in the  
history of England and America. I think myself more fortunate  
than all my fel llow-citizens, in having the distinguished honor to  
be the first, to stand in your Majesty’s royal presence in a diplo-  
matic character , and shall esteem myself the happiest of men, if  
{ can be instrumental in recommending my country more and  
more to your Majesty’s royal benevolence, and in restoring an  
entire esteem, confidence, and affection, or, in better words, the  
old good nature and the old good humor, between people, who,  
though separated by an ocean, and under different governments,  
have the same language, a similar religion, and kindred blood.  
  
‘« | beg your Majesty? s permission to add, that although I have  
some time before been intrusted by my country, it was never,  
in mywhole life, in a manner so agreeable to myself.”

‘The King listened to every word I said, with dignity, but  
with an apparent emotion. Whether it was the nature of the in-  
terview, or whether it was my visible agitation, (for I felt more  
than I did or could express,) that touched him, I cannot say ;  
but he was much affected, and answered me with more tremor  
than I had spoken with, and said ;—  
  
‘ « Sir,—The circumstances of this audience are so extraordi-  
ary, the language you have now held is so extremely proper, and  
the feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occa-  
sion, that [ must say, that [ not only receive with pleasure the  
assurance of the friendly dispositions of the United States, but I  
am very glad the choice has fallen upon you to be their minister.  
I wish you, Sir, to believe, that it may be understood in America,  
that I have done nothing in the late contest, but what I thought  
myself indispensably bound to do, by the duty 1 owed to  
my people. I will be very frank with you. I was the last to  
consent to the separation ; but the separation having been made  
and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now,  
that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United  
States, as an independent power. ‘The moment I see such sen-  
timents and language as yours prevail, and a disposition to give  
to this country the preference, that moment I shall say, let the  
circumstances of language, religion, and blood bave their natu-  
ral and full effect.”  
  
‘1 dare not say that these were the King’s precise words, and  
it Is even possible that | may have in some particular mistaken  
his meaning; for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I  
ever heard, he hesitated some time between his periods and be-  
tween the members of the same period. He was much affected,  
and I was not less so, and therefore I cannot be certain that I  
was so attentive, heard so clearly, and understood so perfectly,  
as to be confident of all his words or sense ; and I think that all  
that he said to me should at present be kept a secret in America,  
unless his Majesty or his Secretary of State should judge proper  
to report it. ‘This I do say, that the foregoing is his Majesty’s  
meaning as I then understood it, and his own words, as nearly as  
I can recollect them.  
  
‘The King then asked me whether I came last from Trance ;  
and upon my answering in the affirmative, he put on an air of  
familiarity, and smiling, or rather laughing, said, there is an  
opinion among some people, that you are not the most attached  
of all your countrymen to the manners of France. J was sur-  
prised at this, because [ thought it an indiscretion and a depart-  
ure from the dignity. I was a little embarrassed; but deter-  
mined not to deny the truth, on one hand, nor leave him to infer

I threw off as  
  
much gravity as I could, and assumed an air of gaiety anda  
tone of decision, as far as was decent, and said, ‘‘ that opinion,  
Sir, is not mistaken ; I must avow to your Majesty I have no at-  
  
tachment but to my own country.”

the Secretary of State, which being between them, I did not

all kings and princes when they g  
treated, stepping backward as is ‘the etiquette,  
  
give the signal to retire.  
and making my  
  
last reverence at the door of the chamber, I went my way.  
‘ The master of the ceremonies joined me, the moment of my  
coming out of the King’s closet, and accompanied me through  
  
the apartments to my carriage.  
  
may be useful to others hereafter.  
  
‘ The conversation with the King, Congress will form their own  
judgment of. I may expect from it a residence ‘ess painful than  
I once expected, as so marked an attention from the King will  
  
silence many grumblers.

4 At one oc!ek on Wednesday, 1st of June, the  
master nf ceremonies cailed at my house, and went  
with me to the Secretary of Slate&#x27;s Oshce. in Cleve­

uninterrupted in that office, through all the chan­

been appointed by 4ie Earl of Holderness.

importing my effects from Holland, which Mr. Fra­  
zier himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen invited  
me to go with hi in in bis coach to Court. When  
we arrived in the ante-chamber, the master of the

I beg your majesty&#x27;s jiermission to add, that al­

vail, and a disposition to give this Country the pre­  
ference, that moment I shall say Let the circum­  
stances of language, religion, and blood have their  
natural and lull effect.&quot;  
44 1 dare not say that these were the king&#x27;s pre­  
cise words; ami it is even possible that I mav have,  
in some particulars, mistaken his meaning,&quot; for al­  
though his pronunciation is as distinct as I ever

rainer laugning, said. 4 there is an opinion among  
some people that you are not the most attached of  
all your countrymen to the manners of France.&#x27;  
I was surprised at all this, because I thou ght it an  
indiscretion, and a descent from his dignity&#x27;. I was  
a little embarrassed, but determined not to deny  
truth on the one hand, nor lead him to infer from  
it any attachment to England on the other. I threw  
off as much grav ity as I could, and assun:ed an air  
of gaiety, and a tone of decision, as far as was de­  
cent, and said, 4 That opinion. Sir, is not mistaken ;  
I must avow to your .Majesty,! have no attach­  
ment but to my own country.7 The King replied,  
as quick as lightning, 4An&quot;hoaest man will never

“At one o’clock on Wednesday, the 1st of  
June, 17S5, the Master of Ceremonies called  
at my house, and went with me to the Score­  
tarv of State’s office, in Cleveland row,where  
the Marquis of Caermarlhen received and in­  
troduced lie to Mr l&#x27;razier, his under Secre­  
tary, who had been, as his lordship said, unin­  
terruptedly in that otlice through all the chang­  
es in administration for thirty years. After  
a short conversation, Lord Caermarlhen in­  
vited me logo with him in his coach to Co&#x27;.rt.  
When we arrived in the antechamber, the  
Master ofCeremonies introduced him,and at­  
tended me while the Secretary of State went  
to take the commands of the King. While  
I stood in this place, where it seems all Min­  
isters stand upon such occasions, always at­  
tended by the Master of Ceremonies, the  
room was very full of Ministers of State,Bish­  
ops, and all other sorts of courtigr^. as well as  
the next room, which is the King’s bedcham­  
ber. You may well suppose I was the focus  
ofall eyes. 1 was relieved, however, from the  
embarrassment ol it by the Swedish and Dutch  
Ministers, who came to me and entertained  
me with a very agreeable conversation dur­  
ing the whole time. Some other gentlemen  
whom lhad seen before,came to make their  
compliments to me, until the Marquis of C&#x27;acr­  
marthen returned, and desired me to go with  
him to his Majesty. 1 went with his. lordship  
through the levee-room into the King’s clos­  
et. The door was .shut, and I was left with  
his Majesty and the Secretary ofStalealune. i  
made three reverences: one at the door, ano­  
ther about half way, and another before the  
presence, according to the usage established  
at this and all the Northern Courts ol&#x27;Europe,  
and then l addressed myself to his Mil^sty in  
the following words:  
  
“ ‘Sire; The United States have appointed  
me Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty,  
and have diiected me to deliver to your Ma­  
jesty this letter which contains the evidence  
of it. it is in obedience to their express com­  
mands that I have the honor to assure your  
Majesty of their unanimous disposition and  
desire to cultivate the most friendly and liber­  
al intercourse between your Majesty’s sub­  
fecis and their citizens,and of their best wish­  
es lor your Majesty&#x27;s health and happiness,  
and for that of your family.  
“ ‘The appointment of a Minister from the  
United States to your Majesty’s Court will  
form an epoch in the history of England and  
America. 1 think myself more fortunate than  
all my fellow-citizens, in having the distin­  
guished honor to be the first to stand in your  
Majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic char­  
acter; and i shall esteem myself the happiest  
ol men if I can be instrumental in recom­  
mending my country more and more to your  
Majesty’s royal benevolence, and of restoring  
an entire esteem, confidence, and affection;  
or, in better words, ‘the old good nature and  
the good old humor,” between people who,  
though separated by an ocean and under dif­  
ferent Governments, have the same language,  
a similar religion, a kindred blood. I beg your  
Majesty’s permission to add, that although i  
have sometimes before been instructed by my  
! country, it was never in my whole life in a  
manner so agreeable to mvself.’  
*/  
“The King listened to every word I said,  
i ....  
: with dignity, it is true, but withapparent emo­  
tion. &#x27;Whether it was my visible agitation,  
for I felt more than I could express, that touch­  
ed him, 1 cannot sav: but he was much affect­  
| * *  
ed, and answered me with more tremor than  
I had spoken with; and said:  
“‘Sir, the circumstances of this audience  
are so extraordinary, the language you have  
now held is so extremely proper, and the feel­  
ings you have discovered so justly adapted to  
the occasion, that I not only receive with  
pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispo­  
sition of the United States, bur. i am glad the  
choice has fallen upon you to be their minis­  
ter. I wish you sir, to believe, that it may  
be understood in America, that I have done  
nothing in the late contest but what. I thought  
myself indispensably bound to do, by the duty  
which l owed my people. I will be frank with  
you. 1 was the last to conform to the sepa­  
ration: but the separation having become in­  
evitable, 1 have always said, as 1 now say,  
that I would be the first to meet the friend­  
ship of the United States as an independent  
power. The moment i see such sentiments  
and language as yours prevail, and a disposi­  
tion to give this country the preference, that  
  
moment I shall say, let the circumstances oi  
language, religion, and blood have their natu­  
ral, full efleet.&#x27;*  
“I dare not say that these were the K ing’s  
j precise words; and it is even possible tnat I  
may have, in some particulars, mistaken Ins  
| meaning; for, although his pronunciation is as  
distinct as I ever heard, he hesitated some­  
times between members of the same period.  
He was, indeed, much affected, and f was not  
less so; and therefore I cannot be certain that  
lwas so attentive, heard so clearly, and un­  
derstood so perfectly, as to be confident of all  
his words or sense. This 1 do say, that, the  
foregoing is his Majesty’s meaning, as I then  
understood it, and his own words, as nearly  
as 1 can recollect them.  
  
“The King then asked me whether I came  
last from Frar.cc, and, upon my answering in  
the affirmative, he put on an air of familiarity,  
and, smiling or rather laughing, said,‘There  
is an opinion among some people that you are  
not the most attached of all your countrymen  
to the mariners of France.’ I was surprised  
at this, because I thought it an indiscretion,  
and a descent from his dignity. I was a little  
embarrassed; but, determined not to deny  
truth on the one hand, nor lead him to infer  
Iromitany attachment to England on the  
other, I threw off as much gravity as I could,  
and assumed an air of gaiety and atone ol  
decision as far as was decent, and said,  
‘That opinion, sir, is not mistaken; I must a­  
vow to your Majesty I have no attachment  
but to my own country.’ The King replied as  
quick as lightning, ‘An honest man will have  
no other.’  
“The King then said a word or two to the  
Secretary of State, which being between  
them, l did not hear, and then turned round  
and bowed to me, as is customary with all  
kings and princes when they give the signal  
to retire. I retreated, stepping backward&quot;,

ring the whole time, Some other gentlemen whom  
I had seen before, came to make their compliments  
to me, until the Marquis of Carmarthen returned  
and desired me to go with him to his Majesty. I  
went with his lordship through the levee room into  
the King’s closet. ‘ihe door was shut, and 1 was  
left with his Majesty and the Secretsry of State  
alone. I made three reverences: one at the door,  
another about lalf way, and another before the  
presence, according to the usage established at this  
and all the Northern Courts of Europe, acd then I  
addressed myself to his Majesty in the following  
words :  
  
“Sire: The United States have appointed me  
Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty and have  
directed me to deliver to your Majesty this letter,  
which contains the evidence of it. It is in obedi-  
euce to their express commands that I have the  
honorto assure your Majesty of their unanimous  
disposition and ‘desire to cu tivace the most friendly  
and liberal intercourse between your Majesty’s sub-  
jects and their citizens, and their best wishes for  
  
=~  
  
your Majesty’s health and happiness, and for that of  
  
your family.  
  
“The appointment of a Minister from the United  
States to your Majesty’s Court will form an epoch  
in the history of England and America. I think  
myself more fortunate than all my fellow citizens in  
having the distinguished honor to be the first to  
stand in your Majesty’s royal presence in a ciplo-  
matic character; and I shall esteem myself the  
happiest of men if | can be instrumental in recom-  
mending my country more and more to your royal  
benevolence, and of restoring an entire esteem,  
confidence, and affection; or, in other words, “the  
old good nature and the good old humor,” between  
the people who, though separated by an ocean, and  
under different governmen&#x27;s, have the same lan-  
gvage, a similar religionand a kindred blood. I  
beg your Majesty’s permission to add, that although  
I have sometimes been instructed by my country,  
it was never in my whole life ina manner so agree-  
able to myself.”  
  
  
  
“The King listened to every word I said with |  
dignity it is true, but with apparent emotion. Wheth- |  
er it was my visible agitation, for I felt more than |  
[ could express, that touched him, 1 cannot say ;!  
but he was much affected, and answered me with |  
more tremor than I had spoken with, and said—  
  
“Sir: The circumstances of this audience are  
so extraordinary, the language you have now held |  
is soextremely proper and the feelings you have  
discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that I  
not only receive with pleasure the assurance of the  
friendly disposition of the United States, but I am  
glad the choice has fallen upon you to be their min-  
ister. I wish you, sir, to believe that it may be  
understood in America, that I have done nothing in  
the late contest but what [ thought myself indis-  
pensably bound to do, by the duty which I owed  
my people. I will be frank with you. IT was the  
last to confurm to the separation; but the separa-  
tion having become inevitable, I have always said,  
as I now say, that I would be the first to meet the  
friendship of the United States as an independent  
power. The moment! see such sentiments and  
language as yours prevail, and a disposition &lt;o give  
this country the preference, that moment I shall say,  
let the circumstances of language, religion, and  
blood have their natural, full effect.”  
  
“T dare not say that these were the King’s pre-  
cise words ; and it is even possible that in some  
particulars I may have misteken his meaning; for  
although his pronunciation is as distinct as 1 ever  
heard, he hesitated sometimes between members of  
the same period. He was indeed much affected,  
and T was not less so, and therefore I cannot be so  
certain that I was so attentive, heard so clearly, and  
understood so perfectly, as to’ be confident of ail  
his words or sense. This I do say, that the forego-  
ing is his Majesty’s meaning, as nearly as I can re-  
collect it.  
  
“ The King then asked me whether I came last  
from France, and upon my answering in the affir-  
mative, he put on an air of familiarity, and, simling,  
or rather laughing, said, ¢&#x27;! here is an opinion among  
some people that you are not the most attached of  
all your countrymen tothe manners of France.’ |  
was surprised at this, because I thought it an indis-  
cretion, and a descent from his dignity. I was a  
little embarrassed; but, determined not to deny the  
truth on the one hand, nor lead him to infer from it  
my attachment to England on the other, I threw off  
as much gravity as I could, and assumed an air of  
gaiety and a tone of decision, as ar as was decent.  
and said, ‘That opinion, sire, 1s not mistaken: I  
avow to your majesty [ have no attachment but to  
iny own country.’ The King replied as quick as  
lightning, ‘ An honest man will have no other,’  
  
‘The King then said a word or two to the Sec-  
retary of State, which, being between them I could  
not hear, and then turned round and bowed to me,  
as is customary with al] kings and princes when  
they give the signal to retire. I[retreated, stepping  
backwards, as is the etiquette; and making my last  
reverence at the door of the chamber, I went to my  
carriage.” — Huyward’s N. E. Gazeleer

ister from the rebel colonies, is very interest­  
ing.  
j ??&#x27;  
&quot;At one o&#x27;clock on Wednesday, the 1st of  
June, 1785, the master of ceremonies called at  
my house, and went with me to the secretary  
ol state&#x27;s office, in CleavelandroW, where the  
Marquis of Caermarthen received and intro­  
duced me to Mr. F-razier,&#x27;his ufider secretary,  
who had been, as his lordship said&#x27;, uninter­  
ruptedly in that office through all the changes  
of administratioUf*for 30 years&#x27;. After ashort  
conversation Lord&#x27; Oaermarthen invited me  
to go with him in his coach to court. When  
we arrived in the antechamber, the master of  
ceremonies introduced&#x27;him, and attended me  
while the secretary ot state went tO&#x27; take the  
commands of the king. VW-rilfe&#x27;Istdod in this  
place, where it seems .ill the ministers stand  
011 such occasions, always attended- by the  
master of ceremonies, the room was very full  
ol ministers of state, bishops, and all other  
sorts of courtiers, as well as the next room,  
which was the king&#x27;s bedchamber. You may  
well suppose I wasthe foens of all1 eyes. I  
was relieved, however, from the embarrass­  
ment of it by the Swedish and Dutch minis­  
ters, who came to me and entertained me with  
a very agreeable conversation dnring the  
whole time. Some other gentlemen, whom I  
had seen before, came to make their&#x27;&#x27;compli­  
ments to me, until the Marquis of Oaermar­  
then returned, and desired me to go with him  
to his majesty. I went with his lordship  
through the levee room into the king&#x27;s closet*.  
The door was shut, and I was- left with his  
majesty and secretary of state alone. I made  
the three reverences: one at the door, another  
about half way, and&#x27;another before the pres­  
ence, according to the usage established at  
this and all the northern courts of Europe,  
and then I addressed myself to his majesty in  
the following words :  
?&lt; Sire?The United States haw appointed  
me minister plenipotentiary to your majesty,  
and have directed mo to deliver to your m?^  
jesty this letter, which contains the evidence  
of it. It is in obedience to1 their express com­  
mands that I have the- honor to assure your­

for your majesty&#x27;s health and happiness, and  
for thai of your family.  
u&lt;The appointment of a minister from the  
United States to your ninety&#x27;s court, will&#x27;  
form ati epoch in the history of England and  
America. 1 think myself more fortunate than  
all my fellow citizens, in having the distin­  
guished honor to t?e the first to stand in your

the last time he appeared in public was on the  
completion of the fiftieth year of his reign.  
He was then blind, but as he rode through the  
assembled thousands he was made to feel that  
he was loved and honored by his subjects. Af­  
ter he lost his reason entirely, the soverignty  
was represented by his son afterwards George  
IV, as Prince Regent. The reign of George  
III, is interesting to Americans, for while he  
was on the throne, the Revolutionary war took  
place, and the independence of the United States  
was acknowledged. This monarch was heard  
to say soon after the war was over, that he was  
the last to consent to the separation of the A­  
merican colonies from the mother country, but  
the separation having become inevitable, he  
would be the first to meet the friendship of the  
United States as an independent power.

At one o&#x27;clock on Wednesday, 1st of June,  
  
the master of ceremonies tailed at my bouse,  
and went with me to tho Secretary , of State&#x27;s  
  
office, in Cleveland row, where the Marquis of  
  
Carmarthen received me, and introduced me to  
  
Mr. Frazier, bis wider secretary, who had been,  
  
as hia lordihio said, tninterrumedlv in that of-  
  
(ice, through all tho changes in administration  
  
for thirty years, having brat been appointed by  
  
the Earl of iloldemese.  
  
After a abort conversation upon the subject of  
  
Importing my effects from Holland, which Mr.  
Frazier himself introduced, Lord Carmarthen in­  
vited me te go with him in bis coach to court.  
When we arrived in the anto-chanibrrr, the mas­  
terof the ceremonies introduced him, nd at­  
tended me while the Secretary of State went to  
take the commands of the king. YVhile I stood  
io thie place, where it seems II mihistsrs stand  
on such occasions, always attended by the mas­  
ter of ceremonies, the room was very fall of  
ministers of state, bishops, and all otherjorts of  
courtiers, as well as the next room, which is the  
king&#x27;s bed chamber. You may well suppose I  
was the focus of all eyee. I was relieved, how­  
ever, from the embarrassment of it, by the Svre­  
dish and Dutch ministers, who came to me and  
  
entertained me with a very rgre8ab&#x27; conyersa  
tion durin the whole time. Some other gentle  
  
men whom I had seen before, came to make their  
  
compliments too, until the Marquis of Carmar  
  
then returned, and desired me to go with htm to  
his maicety. I went with his lordship through  
  
the levee room into the king&#x27;s closet. Tho door  
  
was shut, and I was left with his majesty and the  
  
Secretary of State alone. I made the three rev­  
erences : one at the door, anotliur about half  
  
way, aud another before the presence accord  
  
imr to the u;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;c established at this, and all ilie  
  
northern courts of Europe and then I eddrees  
  
ed myself to his majesty in the following words  
  
&quot;&#x27;Sue: The United States .have .appointed  
me Minister Plenipotentiary to your majesty, end  
  
have directed me to deliver to your mijci&#x27;y tins  
  
latter, which contains the evidence of it. It ie  
  
ia obedience to their express commands, that I  
  
have the honor to assure your majesty of thai  
  
unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the  
most friendly and liberal intercourse between  
  
your Hfajesfy&#x27;s4 subjects and their citizens, and of  
  
their best wishes for your majesty&#x27;s health and  
  
happiness, and for that of your family.  
  
&quot; The appointment of a minister of the U.  
  
States to your majesty&#x27;s court, will foraa an epoch  
  
in the history of England and America. I think  
  
myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens,  
in having the distinguished honor to be the first  
to stand in your majesty&#x27;s royal presence in a di  
  
plomatic character; and I shall esteem myself  
  
the happiest of meo, t I can be instrumental in  
recommending my country more and more to  
  
your majesty a royal benevolence, and or re.  
  
storing; sn entire esteem, confidence, and affec  
  
tion ; or, in better words, 1 the good nature and  
the good old humor, between people, who, though  
separated by ao ocean, and under different gov­  
ernments, have the earns language, a similar re­  
ligion, at kindred blood.&#x27; J beg your majesty&#x27;s  
permission to add, that although I have sometimes  
before been instructed by myrountry.it was never  
in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to me.&quot;  
&quot;The king listened to every word I said, with  
dignity it is true, but with apparent emotion.  
Whether it was my visible agitation, fur I felt  
more than I could express, that touched him, I  
cannot say, bat he -&#x27;was much affected, and an­  
swered me with more tremor than I had spoken  
with, and said :  
&quot;Sir: The circumstances of this audience are  
so extraordinary, the language you have now held  
is so extremely proper, and the feelinge you have  
discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that  
I moat say, that I not only receive with pleasure  
the assurance of the friendly disposition of the  
United States, W that I am glad tho choice has  
fallen upon you to be their minister. I wish yon,  
sir, to believe, and that it may be underwood ui  
America, that I have done nothing in the late  
contest but what I thought myself indispensably  
bound to do, by the duty which I owed to my peo­  
ple. I will be fraftk with you. I was the 4ast  
to conform to the separation; but the separation

Mr, Adams says, “ At one o&#x27;clock on Wednes-  
day, the first of June, 1785, the master of cere-  
monies called at my house, and went with me to  
the Secretary of State’s office, in Cleveland Rew;  
where the marquis of Carmarthen received and  
introduced me to Mr. Frazier, his under Secretary,  
who had been, asshis lordship said, uninterrupted-  
  
‘ly in that offiee through all the changes ii admia-  
  
him in-his coach to court.  
  
the ante-chamber, the master of the cerémonies in-  
troducéd him, and attended me, while the Secreta-  
ry of State went to take the commands of the  
king. While [ stood in this place, where it seems-  
all ministers stand upon such occasions, always  
attended by the master of cercimonies, the room  
  
_ was very full of ministers of State, bishops, and  
  
all other sorts of courtiers, as well as the next  
room, which is the king’s bed chaiver. You may  
well suppose I was the focus of all eyes. | was  
relieved, however, from the ernarrassment of it,  
by the Swedish and Dutch miusters, who cane  
to me and entertained ine with a very agreeable  
conversation duri gthe whole time. Some other  
gentlemen whom I had seen before, came to make  
their compliments to me, until the marqu&#x27;s of Car-  
marthen returned, and desired ine to go with him  
to his majesty. I went with his lordship through  
the levee room into the king’s closet. ‘The door  
was shut, and I was lefi with his majesty and the  
Secretary of State alone. 1 made the three rev-  
erences :—one at the door, another about half  
way, and another before the presence, according  
to the usage established at this, and all the north-  
ern courts of Europe, and then | addressed my-  
self to his majesty in the following words :—* Sire :  
The United States have appoin‘ed me minisier  
plenipotentiary to your majesty, and have directed  
me to deliver to your majesty this letter, which  
contains the evidence of it. It is in obedience to  
their express commands, that I lave the honor to  
assure your majesty of their unanimous disposition  
and desire to cultivate the most frendiy and liber-  
al intercourse between your majesty’s subjects and  
their citizens, and of their best wishes for your  
majesty’s health and happiness, and for that of  
your family.  
  
** The appointment ofa minister from the United  
States to your majesty’s court, will form an epoch  
in the history of England and America. I think  
myself more fortunate than a!! my fellow citizens,  
in having the distinguished honor to be the first to  
stand in your majesty’s royal presence, in a cipio-  
matic character; and | shall cstcem myself the  
happiest of men, if I can be instrumental in recom:  
mending my country more and more to your majes-  
ty’s royal benevolence, and of restoring an entire  
esteem, confidence and affection: or, in better words  
the old good nature and the good o!d humor between  
people, who, though separated by an ocean, and  
under different governments, have the same lan-  
guage, a similar religion, a kindred blood. I beg  
your majesty’s permission, to add, that although I  
have sometimes before been intrusted by my  
  
| country, it was never in my whole life in a man-  
  
ner so agreeable to myself.”  
  
The king listened to every word I said, with  
dignity, it is true, but with apparent emotion.—  
Whether it was iny visible agitation, for I felt more  
than I could express, that touched him, | cannot  
say ; but he was much affected, and answered me  
with more tremor than I had spoken with, and  
said :—* Sir: The circumstances of this audience  
are so extraordinary, the language you have now  
held is so extremely proper, and the feelings you  
have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion,  
that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance  
of the friendly disposition of the United States, but  
that [am glad the choice has tallen upon you to  
be their minister. I wish you, sir, to believe, and  
that it may be understood in America, that I have  
done nothing in the late contest but what I felt  
myself indispensably bound to do by the duty which  
lowed my people. I will be frank with you; I  
was the last to conform to the separation ; but the  
separation having become inevitable, 1 have al-  
ways said, as I now say, that | would be the first  
to meet the friendship of the United States as an  
independent power. ‘The moment! see such sen-  
timents and language as yours prevail, and a dis-  
position to give this country the preference, that  
moment I shall say—!et the circums‘ances of lan-  
guage, religion and blood, have their natural full  
I dare not say that these were the king’s  
precise words; and it is even possible that | may  
have, in some particulars, mistaken his meaning ;  
for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I  
ever heard, he hesitated sometimes between mem-  
bers of the same period. He was, indeed, much  
affected, and I was not lcss so, and therefore I  
cannot be certain that I was so attentive, heard so  
clearly, and understood so perfectly, as to be con-  
fident of all his words, or sense. This 1 do say,  
that the foregoing is his majes&#x27;y’s meaning, as I  
  
»then understood it, and his own words, as nearly as  
  
I can recollect them. The king then asked me  
whether I came last from France ; and upon my  
answering in the affirmative, he put on an air of  
familiarity, and smiling, or rather laughing, said,  
  
_There is an opinion among some people, that  
  
you are not the most attached of all your country-  
men to the manners of France.”’ I was surprised  
  
| at this, because I thought it an indiscretion, anda  
| descent from his dignity.  
  
I was a little embar-  
rassed ; but determined not to deny the truth on the  
  
| one hand, nor lead him to infer from it any attach-  
  
ment to England on the other, | threw off as  
much gravity as I could, and assumed an air of  
gaiety, and a tone of decision, as far as was des  
  
| cent, and said, ** That opinion, sir, is not mista--  
  
Dear BE pianapae=W bile on a visit a short}  
| thime si a ghboring town, I attended the.  
  
ken: I must avow to your majesiy, | have no ats  
tachment but to my own country.” The king-re-  
plied as quick as lightning, ** An honest man will  
never have any other.” The king then said a  
word or two to the Secretary of State, which being  
between them I did not hear, and then turned  
round and bowed to me, as is customary with all  
kings and princes when they give the signal to re-  
tire. I retreated, stepping backward, as is the  
etiquette ; and reg my last reverence at the  
door of the chamber, I went to my carriage.”

the master of ceremonies called at my house,  
and went with me to the Secretary of State’s  
office, in Cleveland row, where the Marquis  
of Carmarthen received me, and introduced me  
to Mr. Frazier, his under secretary, who had  
been, as his lordship said, uninterruptedly in  
that office, through all the changes in admini-  
stration for thirty years, having first been ap-  
  
pointed by the Earl of Holderness.  
  
After a short conversation upon the subject

As, the first Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States to the court of Lon-  
don, had his introductory audience with King Grorer the Third. An event 80 ex-  
traordinary, with circumstances so novel to us in America, led Mr. Apams to narrate  
  
the particulars, in a letter to an intimate friend, which was kept private till after his  
death. It ran thus:  
  
‘ Ar one o’clock on Wednesday, the first of June, the master of ceremonies called at my house,  
and went with me to the Secretary of State’s office, in Cleaveland row, where the Marquis or Car-  
MARTHEN received me, and introduced me to Mr. Frazier, his under-secretary, who had been, as  
his lordship said, uninterruptedly in that office, through all the changes in administrations for  
thirty years, having first been appointed by the Eart or HOLDERNESS. :  
  
‘ After a short conversation upon the subject of importing my effects from Holland, which Mr.  
Frazier himself introduced, Lorp CaRMARTHEN invited me to go with him in his coach to  
court. When we arrived in the ante-chamber, the master of the ceremonies introduced him and  
attended me while the Secretary of State went to take the commands of the Kine. While I stood  
in this place, where it seems all ministers stand upon such occasions, always attended by the  
master of ceremonies, the room was very full of ministers of state, bishops, and all other sorts  
of courtiers, as well as the next room, which is the Krne’s bed-chamber. You may well suppose  
I was the focus of all eyes. 1 was relieved, however, from the embarrassment of it, by the Swe-  
dish and Dutch ministers, who came to me and entertained me with a very agreeable conversa-

tion during the whole time. Some other gentlemen, whom I had seen before, came to make  
their compliments too, until the Marquis or CARMARTHEN returned, and desired me to go with  
him to his Majesty. I went with his lordship through the levee room into the king’s closet. The  
dvor was shut, and I was left with his Majesty and the Secretary of State alone. I made the  
three reverences ; one at the door, another about half way, and another before the presence, ac-  
cording to the usage established at this, and all the northern courts of Europe, and then addresed  
myself to his Majesty in the following words:  
  
‘* Sire: The United States have appointed me Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty, and  
have directed me to deliver to your Majesty this letter, which contains the evidence of it. It is  
in obedience to their express commands, that I have the honor to assure your Majesty of their  
unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the most friendly and liberal intercourse between  
your Majesty’s subjects and their citizens, and of their best wishes for your Majesty’s health and  
happiness, and for that of your family.  
  
‘The oe een of a Minister from the United States to your Majesty’s court will form an  
epoch in the history of England and America. I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow  
citizens, in having the distinguished honor to be the first to stand in your Majesty’s royal pres-  
ence in a diplomatic character; and I shall esteem myself the happiest of men if [ can be instru-  
mental in recommending my country more and more to your Majesty’s royal benevoli nce, and  
of restoring an entire esteem, confidence, and affection; or, in better words, ‘the good nature  
and the good old humor, between people, who, though separated by an ocean, and under differ-  
ent government, have the same language, a similar religion, a kindred blood. I beg your Ma-  
jesty’s permission to add, that although I have semetimes before been instructed by my coun-  
try, it was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to myself.’  
  
The King listened to every word I said, with dignity it is true, but with apparent emotion.  
Whether it was my visible agitation, for I felt more than I could express, that touched him, I  
cannot say; but he was much affected, and answered me with more tremor than I had spoken  
with, and said:  
  
‘ ‘Sin: The circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary, the language you have now  
held is so extremely proper, and the feelings you have discovered are so justly adapted to the oc-  
casion, that I must say, that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispo-  
sition of the United States, but that | am glad the choice has fallen upon you to be their minis-  
ter. I wish you, Sir, to believe, and that it may be understood in America, that I have done  
nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself indispensably beund to do, by the duty  
which | owe to my people. I will be frank with you. I was the last to conform to the separa-  
tion; but the separation having been made, and having become inevitable, I have always said,  
as I now say, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independ-  
ent power. The moment I see’such sentiments and language as yours prevail, that moment I  
shall say, Let the circumstances of language, religion, and blood have their natural and fuil ef-  
fect.’  
  
‘I dare not say that these were the K1na’s precise words ; and it is even possible that t may  
have, in some ee mistaken his meaning; for although his pronunciation is as distinct  
as I ever heard , he hesitated sometimes between members of the same period. He was, indeed,  
much affected, and I was not less so, and therefore [ cannot be certain that I was so attentive,  
heard so clearly, and understood so perfectly, as to be confident of all his words, or sense ; and  
think that all which he said to me should. at present, be kept secret in America, except his Ma-  
justy or his Secretary of State should judge proper to report it. This I do say, that the foregoing  
is his Majesty’s meaning, as I then understood it, and his own words, as nearly as | can recollect  
them.  
  
‘The Kine then asked me whether I came last from France, and upon my answering in the af-  
firmative, he put on an air of familiarity, and smiling, or rather laughing, said: ‘There is an  
opinion among some —— that you are not the most attached of all your countrymen to the  
manners of France.’ 1 was surprised at this, because | thought it an indiscretion, and a descent  
from his dignity. I was a little embarrassed. but determined not to deny the truth on the one  
hand, nor lead him to infer from it any attachment to England on the other. I threw off as much  
gravity as | could, and assumed an air of gaiety, and a tone of decision, as far as was decorous,  
and said ; *‘ That opinion, Sir, is not mistaken: I must avow to your Majesty, I have no attachment  
but to my own country.’ The Kine replied as quick as lightning, ‘An honest man will never  
have any other.’  
  
‘The Kine then said a word or two to the Secretary of State, which being between them I did  
not hear, and then turned round and bowed to me, as is customary with all kings and princes  
when they give the signal to retire. I retreated, stepping backward, as is the etiquette ; and  
making my last reverence at the door of the chamber, | went away. The master of the cere-  
  
monies joined me at the moment of coming out of the Kine’s closet, and accompanied me  
through all the apartments down to my carriage.’

Mr. Adams says; ”At one o’clock, on  
Wednesday, the first of June, 1785, the  
master of ceremonies called at my house,  
and went with me to the secretair of staters  
olllce, in Cleveland Row, where toe Marquis  
of Carmarthen received and introduced me  
to Mr. Frasier, his under secretary, who  
had been, as his lordship said, uninterrupt¬  
edly in that offlee throniHt oil the changes  
In administration for thirty years. After  
a short conversation, Lora Carmarthen  
invited me to go with him in his coach to  
court. When we arrived in the ante-cham¬

him and attended hm while the aecretary  
of state went tavtaks the oommands of the

of courtiers, as well as the next room,  
which is the king’s bed-chamber. Toumay  
well suppose I was the focus of all eves.  
  
I was relieved, however, from the embar¬  
rassment of it, by the Swedish and Dutch I  
ministers, who came to me and entertained  
me with a very agreeable conversation  
during the whole time. Some other gen¬  
tlemen whom I had seen before, came to  
make their compliments to me. until the  
Marquis of Carmarthen returned, and de¬  
sired me to go with him to his maies^. I  
went with his lordship through the levee  
room, into the king^s closet. The door  
was shut, and I was loft with his majesty

cannot say; but he was  
much affected, and an¬

tremor than I had spok¬

the circumstances of this  
audience are so extraor¬

have now held is so ex¬  
tremely proper, and the  
feelings you have discov¬

of the friendly disposi¬

have done nothing in the

even possible that I may

pronunciation is as dis¬

therefore 1 cannot be certain Aat I was so atten¬  
tive, heaid so clearly, aud un d erstood so per¬  
fectly, as to be confident of all his wonls, or sense.  
This I do say, that Ae foregoing is his majesty’s  
meaning, as I then understood it, and his own  
words, as nearly as I can recollect them. The  
king then asked me whether I came last from  
France; and upon my answering in Ae affirma¬  
tive, he put on an air of familiarity, and, smil¬  
ing, or rather, laughing, said, ‘ There is an opin¬  
ion among some people that yon are not the  
most attached 01 all your countrymen to the  
manners of France.’ 1 was surprised at Ais,  
Itecanse I thought it an indiscretion, and a de¬

On the 1st day of June, he was presented to King  
George III by the Marquis, and was received by his  
Majesty in his private closet, where, after the usal  
salutations, and in conformity to etiqiette on such  
occasions, he made a brief speech to the King, in  
which, among other remarks, he said-&quot;The ap-­  
pointment of a minister from the United States to  
your Hajesty&#x27;s court, will form an epoch in the his­  
tory of England and of America, I think myself  
more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens in having  
the cistingnished honor to be the first to stand in  
your Majesty&#x27;s royal presence in a diplomatic  
character, and shall esteom myself the happiest  
of men if I can be instrumental in recom­  
mending my country more and more to  
your Majesty&#x27;s royal benevolence, and of restoring  
an entire esteem, confidence, and affection, or, in  
better words, the old good nature, and the old good  
humor, between people, who though separated by  
an ocean and under different governments, have  
the same language, a similar religion, and kindred  
blood.&quot; To this the king replied with much emo­  
tion:-&quot;Sir, the circumstances of this audience are  
so extraordinary, the langeage you have now held is  
so extremely proper, and the feelings you have dis­  
covered so justly adapted to the occasion, that I  
must say, that I not only receive with pleasure the  
assurance of the friendly dispositions of the United  
States, but that I am very glad the choice has fallen  
upon you to be their minister. I wish you, sir, to  
believe, and that it may be understood in America,  
that I have done nothing in the late contest but  
what I thought myself indispensably bound to do,  
by the duty which I owed to my people. I will  
be very frank with you. I was the last to con­  
sent to the separation; but the separation having  
been made and having become inevitable, I  
have always said, as I say now, that I would  
be the first to meet the friendship of the Uaited  
States as an independent power. The moe­  
ment I see such sentiments and language as  
yours prevail, and a disposition to give this country  
the preference, that moment I shall say, let the  
circumstances of language, religion and blood have  
their natural and full effect.&quot; After this answer

“At one o’clock on Wednesday, the 10th of  
June, 1785, the master of ceremonies called at

JOHN ADAMS A GEORGE HIR.  
John Adams, in a letter to Secret&#x27;y  
Jay, states that king G. II behaved  
not only handsomely, but even nobly,  
when, in June, 1735, he received  
Adams, as the first ambassador from  
the United States to England. In a  
few well-selected words Adams ad­  
dressed Georgey, and received the fol­  
lowing reply: &quot;Sir, I wish you to  
  
believe, and that it may be understood  
  
in America, that I have done nothing  
  
in the late contest but what I thought  
  
myself indispensblay bound to do by  
  
the duty which I owed to my people.  
I will be very frank with you. I was  
  
the last to consent to the separation;  
but the separation having been made,  
and having become inevitable, I have  
  
always said, as I now say, that I  
would be the first to to meet the friend­  
ship of the United States as an inde­  
pendent power.&quot; These are words  
  
of proper dignity as well as of decor­  
ous wisdom. Mr. Adams, who re­  
cords them, impressively adds, &quot;The  
  
king was indeed much affected, and I  
  
confess I was not less so.&quot;

In June, 1785, John Adams, the first Minister  
Plenipotentiary from the United States to the  
Court of London, had his introductory audience  
with King George the Third. An event so  
extraordinary with circumstances so novel to us  
in America, led Mr. Adams to narrate the  
particulars in a letter to an intimate friend,  
which was kept private until after his death. It  
was thus :—  
  
“At one o’clock on Wednesday, Ist of June,  
the Master of Ceremonies called at my house,  
and went with me to the Secretary of State’s  
office in Cleaveland Row, where the Marquis of  
  
ern received me, and introduced me  
  
to Mr. Frazier, his under-secretary, who had  
  
been uninterruptedly in that office through all  
the changes in administration for thirty years,  
having first been appointed by the Earl of  
Holderness.  
  
- After a short conversation upon the subject of  
importing my effects from Holland, which Mr.  
Frazier himself introduced, Lord Carmarthern  
invited me to go with him in his coach to court.  
When we arrived in the ante-chamber, the  
Master of Ceremonies introduced him, and at-  
tended me while the Secretary of State went to  
take the commands of the King. While I stood  
in this place, where it seems all Ministers stand  
a such occasions, always attended by the  
  
ter of Ceremonies, the room was very full of  
ministers-of-state, bishops, and all other sorts of  
courtiers, as well as the next recom, which is the  
king’s bed-chamber. You may well suppose I  
‘was the focus of all eyes. I was relieved, how-  
ever, from the embarrassment of it by the  
Swedish and Dutch Ministers, who came to me  
and entertained me with a very agreeable con-  
versation during the whole time. Some other  
gentlemen whom I had seen before, came to make  
their compliments, too, until the Marquis of  
Carmarthern returned and desired me to go with

through the levee-room into the king’s closet.  
The door was shut, and I was left alone with his  
Majesty and the Secretary of State. I made the  
three reverences; one at the door, another about  
half way, and another before the presence—ac-  
cording to the usage established at this and all  
the northern courts of Europe—and then I ad-  
dressed myself in his Majesty to the following  
words :—  
  
Sire: The United States have appointed me  
Minister Plenipotentiary to your Majesty and  
have directed me to deliver to your Majesty this  
letter, which contains the evidence of it. Itis in  
obedience to their express commands that I have  
the honor to assure your Majesty of their  
unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the  
most friendly and liberal intercourse between  
your Majesty’s subjects and their citizens, and of  
their best wishes for your Majesty’s health and  
happiness, and for that of your family.  
  
The appointment of a Minister from the United  
States to your Majesty’s Court will form an epoch  
in the history of England and America. I think  
myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens  
in having the distinguished honor to be the first  
to stand in your Majesty’s royal presence ina  
diplomatic character; and I shall esteem myself

good humor between people who, though separat-  
ed by an ocean, and under different governments,  
have the same language, a similar religion, a  
kindred blood. I beg your Majesty’s permission  
to add that although I have sometimes before  
been instructed by my country, it was never  
in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to  
myself.  
  
The King listened to every word I said, with  
dignity, it is true, but with apparent emotion.  
Whether it was my visible agitation, for I felt  
more than I could express, that touched him, I  
cannot say; but he was much affected and  
answered me with more tremor than I had spoken  
with, and said :—  
  
‘Sir: The circumstances of this audience are so  
extraordinary, the language you have now held is  
so extremely proper, and the feelings you have  
discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that  
I must say that I not only receive with pleasure  
the assurance of the friendly disposition of the  
United States, but I am glad the choice has fall-  
en upon you to be their Minister. I wish you,  
sir, to believe, and that it may be understood in  
America, that I have done nothing in the late  
contest but what I thought myself indispensably  
bound to do by the duty which I owed to my  
people. I will be frank with you. I was the  
last to conform to the separation; but the separa-  
tion having been made, and having become  
inevitable, I have always said, as I now say, that  
I would be the first to meet the friendship of the  
United States as an independent power. The  
moment I see such sentiments and language as  
your’s prevail, and a disposition to give this  
country the preference, that moment I shall say—

blood have their natural and full effect.’  
  
I dare not say that these were the king&#x27;s pre-  
cise words; and it is even possible that 1 may  
have in some particulars mistaken his meaning,  
for although his pronunciation is as distinct as I  
ever heard, he hesitated sometimes between  
members of the same period. He was indeed  
much affected, and I was not less so; and there-  
fore I cannot be certain that I was so attentive,  
heard so clearly, and understood so pertectly, as  
to be confident of all his words or sense; and  
think that all which he said to me should, at  
present, be kept secret in America, except his  
Majesty or his Secretary of State should judge  
proper to report it. This I do say, that the  
foregoing is his Majesty’s meaning, as I then  
understood it, and his own words as nearly as I  
can recollect them.  
  
The king then asked me whether I came last  
from France, and, upon my answering in the  
affirmative, he put on an air of familiarity, and  
smiling, or, rather, laughing, said—There is an  
opinion among some people that you are not the  
most attached of all your countrymen to the man-  
ners ot France.’ I was surprised at this because  
I thought it an indiscretion, and a descent from  
his dignity. I was a little embarrassed but  
determined not to deny the truth on the one hand,  
nor lead him to infer from it any attachment to  
England on the other. I threw off as much  
gravity as I could and assumed an air of gaicty  
and a tone of decision, as tar as was decent, and  
  
. said—That opinion, sir, is not mistaken; | must  
avow to your Majesty I have no attachment but  
to my own country.” The king replied as quick  
as lightning,—&#x27;An honest man will never have  
any other!’  
  
The king then said a word or two to the  
  
did not hear, and then turned round and bowed  
to me, as is customary with all kings and princes  
when they give the signal to retire. 1 retreated,  
stepping backward as is the etiquette; and mak-  
ing my last reverence at the door of the chamber,  
I went away. he Master of the Ceremonies

tion, Lord Caermarthen invited me to go in  
his coach to court. I went with his lordship  
through the levee-room into the king’s closet.  
The door was shut, and I was left with his  
majesty and the secretary of state alone. I  
made the three reverences (one at the door,  
another about half way, and another before  
the presence), according to the usage estab-  
lished at this and all northern courts of Eu-  
rope, and then I addressed myself to his  
majesty in the following words : —  
  
“*¢ Sire: The United States have appoint-  
ed me minister plenipotentiary to your majes-  
ty, and have directed me to deliver to your  
majesty this letter, which contains the evi-  
dence of it. It is in obedience to their ex-  
press commands that I have the honor to as-  
sure your majesty of their unanimous dispo-  
sition and desire to cultivate the most friendly  
and liberal intercourse between your majes-  
ty’s subjects and their citizens, and of their  
best wishes for your majesty’s health and  
happiness, and for those of your family.  
  
“«¢The appointment of a minister from the  
United States to your majesty’s court will  
form an epoch in the history of England and  
America. I think myseif more fortunate than  
all my fellow-citizens in having the distin-  
guished honor to be the first to stand in your  
majesty’s presence in a diplomatic character ;  
and I shall esteem myself the happiest of  
men if I can be instrumental in recommend-  
ing my country more and more to your majes-  
ty’s royal benevolence, and of restoring an  
entire esteem, confidence, and affection; or,  
in better words, ‘‘ the good old nature and the  
  
  
  
224  
  
good old humor” between people who, though  
separated by an ocean, and under different  
governments, have the same language, a sim-  
ilar religion, a kindred blood. I beg your  
majesty’s permission to add, that, although I  
have sometimes before been instructed by my  
country, it was never in my whole life in a  
manner so agreeable to myself.’  
  
‘The king listened to every word I said,  
with dignity, it is true, but with apparent  
emotion. Whether it was my visible agita-  
tion — for I felt more than I could express —  
that touched him, I cannot say; but he was  
much affected, and answered me with more  
tremor than I had spoken with, and said, —  
  
‘¢¢Sir: The circumstances of this audience  
are so extraordinary, the language you have  
now held is so extremely proper, and the feel-  
ings you have discovered so justly adapted to  
the occasion, that I not only receive with  
pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispo-  
sition of the United States, but I am glad  
the choice has fallen upon you to be their  
minister. I wish you, sir, to believe, and that  
it may be understood in America, that I have  
done nothing in the late contest but what I  
thought myself indispensably bound to do by  
the duty which I owed my people. I will be  
frank with you. I was the last to conform to  
  
the separation; but the separation having be-  
come inevitable, I have always said, as I now  
say, that I would be the first to meet the friend-  
ship of the United States as an independent  
  
power. The moment I see such sentiments  
and language as yours prevail, and a disposi-  
tion to give this country the preference, that  
moment I shall say, let the circumstances of  
language, religion, and blood have their nat-  
ural, full effect.’

permission to add that, although I have some¬

One is struck with the sentiments of the American Minister in the  
presence of the British sovereign. His appointment formed indeed a  
new epoch in the history of England and of America. “I think my-  
self,” said he, “ more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens in having the

fi&gt; ni the United States to your Ma­  
jesty s court will form an epoch in  
the history ol England and America.  
I think mysell more fortunate than  
ad my fellow citizens, in having the  
dis&#x27;inguished honor to he the first  
to stand in your Majesty’s royal  
presence in a diplomatic character;  
and I shall esteem myself the happi­  
est of men if I can be instrumental  
in recommending more and more to  
your majesty’s royal benevolence,  
and of restoring an entire esteem,  
confidence and aflcction, or, in bet­  
ter words, ‘the good old nature  
and the good old humor,’ between  
people who, though separated by an  
ocean, and tinder different govern­  
ments, Lave the same language, a  
similar religion, of a kindred blood.  
I beg your Majesty’s permission to  
add, that although I have some­  
times before been instructed by my  
^k country, it was never, in my whole  
life in a manner so agreeable to my­  
Velf.”  
VTbe king listened to every word I  
8aj\ with dignity, it is true, but  
wjtj\apparent emotion. Whether it  
was visible agitation, (for I felt  
more ftian * could express,) that  
touched*-1&#x27;&quot;1* 1 canil0t 6ai’ i but he  
was roucu\a^cctt^’ aDt^ answered me  
with more Venlor tha“ 1 haJ sPok&quot;  
cn with,  
d fence arc so extraordinary, the lan­  
guage you have now held is so ex­  
tremely proper, and the.feelings you  
have d iscovcied so justly adapted to  
the occasion, that I not only receive  
with pleasure the assurance of the  
friendly disposition ol the United  
States, but I am glad that the choice  
has fallen upon you to be their min­  
ister. I wish you, Sir, to believe,  
that it may b3 understood iu Amer­  
ica, that I have done nothing in the  
late contest but what I t no light my­  
self indispensably bound to do, by  
the duty which I owed my people.  
I will be frank with you. I was the  
last to conform to a separation ; but  
the separation having become ine­  
vitable, I Lave always said, as I  
now say, that I would be the first to  
meet the friendship of the United  
States, as an independent power.  
The moment I see such sentiments  
and language as yours prevail, and a  
disposition to give this country the  
preference, that moment I shall say,  
let the circumstances of language,  
religion, and blood have their nat­  
ural, full eflect.”  
  
I dare not say that these were the  
king’s precise words ; and it is even  
possiblo, that I may have in some  
particulars, mistaken his meaning;  
for, although his pronunciation is as  
distinct as I ever heard, he hesitates  
sometimes between members of the  
same period. He was, indeed, much  
affected, and I was not less 60 ; and  
therefore I cannot be certain that  
I was so attentive, heard so clearly,  
and understood so perfectly, as to  
be confident of his words or sense.  
This I do say ; that the foregoing is  
the Majesty’s meaning as I then  
understood it.  
The king then asked me whether  
I came last from France, and upon  
my answering him in the affirma­  
tive, he put on an air of familiarity,  
and smiling, or rather laughing,  
said, “there is an opinion amoDg  
some people that you are not the  
most attached of all your country­  
men to the manners of France.” I  
was surprised at this, because I  
thought it an indiscretion, and a  
descent from his dignity. I was a  
little embarrassed ; but determined  
not to deny Jthe truth on the one  
hand, nor lead him to infer from it  
any attachment to England on the  
other. Ijtbrew off as much gravity  
as I could, and assumed an air of  
gayety and a tone of decision, as far  
as was decent, and said, ‘that opin­  
ion, sir, is not mistaken ; I must  
avow to your Majesty that I have  
no attachment, but to uiy own coun­  
try.’ The king replied as quick as  
lightning,‘anMionest man will Lave  
no other.’  
The king then said a few words to  
the secretary, and then turned  
round and bowed to me, as is custo­  
mary with kings and princesses,  
when they give the signal to retire?  
1 retreated, stepping backwards as  
is the customary etiquette, and  
making my last reverence at the  
door of the chamber, I went to my  
cairiage.”

‘The appointment of a Minister from the United States to your  
Majesty’s Court will form an epoch in the history of England and  
America. I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens  
in having the distinguished honour to be the first to stand in your  
Majesty’s royal presence in a diplomatic character, and I shall  
esteem myself the happiest of men if I can be instrumental in  
recommending my country more and more to your Majesty’s royal  
benevolence and of restoring an entire esteem, contidence, and  
affection, or in better words, the old good nature and old good

religion, and kindred blood. I beg your Majesty’s permission to add  
that, although I have some time before been entrusted by my country,  
it was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to myself.’  
  
The King’s reply to this very dignified and touching address  
was not less touching and dignified. He said :—  
  
‘Sir, the circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary, the  
language you have now held is so extremely proper, and the feelings  
you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that I must  
say that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance of .the  
friendly disposition of the United States, but that Iam very glad  
the choice has fallen upon you to be their Minister. I wish you,  
sir, to believe, and that it may be understood in America, that I  
have done nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself  
indispensably bound to do by the duty which I owed to my people.  
Iwill be very frank with you. I was the last to consent to the  
separation, but the separation having been made, and having become  
inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the  
first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent  
Power. The moment I see such sentiments and language as yours  
prevail and a disposition to give this country the preference, that  
moment I shall say, let the circumstances of language, religion, and  
blood have their natural and full effect.’
