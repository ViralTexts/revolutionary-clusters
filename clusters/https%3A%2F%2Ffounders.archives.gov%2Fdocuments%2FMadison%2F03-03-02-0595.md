ter importing approbation of this my humble proposal, and, as far as depends upon you yourself—Acceptance I will forthwith set about drawing up, for the use of the United States, or such of them, if any, as may see reason to give their acceptance to it, a complete body of proposed law, in the form of Statute law, say in one word a Pannomion—a body of Statute law, including a succedaneum to that mass of foreign law, the yoke of which in the wordless, as well as boundless, and shapeless shape of common, alias Unwritten law, remains still about your necks—a complete body or such parts of it as the life and health of a man, whose age wants little of four and sixty, may allow of.

1. Division of the whole Pannomion into two separate parts, the General Code, and the System of particular Codes.  
In the General Code are comprised all such matters, of which it concerns persons in general to be apprised: in the System of particular Codes, each particular Code contains such matters only, with which some one Class or denomination of persons only have concern: some one class or denomination, or in case of correlative classes of persons, running together in pairs, such as husband and wife, Master and Servant, and so forth, some two or other such small number of classes or denominations, whose legal concerns are thus inseparably intermingled.  
Merely for illustration sake, number of particular Codes, as above, say 200: average length of each 5 pages. Consequent advantage, burthen of legal matter to be borne in mind by each person reduced from 1000 pages to 5 pages

2. In each Code, as well particular as General, an ulterior distinction noted and acted upon, is the distinction between matter of constant concernment, and matter of occasional concernment. To produce the effect aimed at in the making of a law, to produce the effect of guidance, that which is matter of constant concernment must in all its magnitude, in all its detail, be borne in mind at all times: while, in the case of that which is but matter of occasional concernment, the bare knowledge or suspicion of its existence will in general be sufficient, matters being so circumstanced, that before the time for action comes, sufficient time for reference to the text of the law, and for perusal of its con

nation is thus given, notice of the existence of such explanation is in every place presented to the eye: care being taken all along to apply the explanation to every such passage, to the end that it may be found conformable to the sense, intended in each such passage to be conveyed.  
So moderate will the number of these essential terms, these expounded words be found, that the labour necessary to the giving correctness and consistency, to the part of the language, the import of which is thus fixed, fixed by authority of law, needs the less be grudged.  
4. To the Penal Code belongs an ulterior distinction peculiar to itself: matter descriptive of the offence in its ordinary state, and matter indicative of the several causes of justification,(1) aggravation(2) and extenuation(3) with the grounds of exemption(4) from punishment, which apply to it.  
From beginning to end, one object kept in view and aimed at is—that, the whole field of legislation being surveyed, surveyed and travelled through over and over again in all directions, no case that can present itself shall find itself unnoticed or unprovided for. Of this object the compleat attainment may be too much for human weakness: but by every approach made towards it, the science is advanced, and, in all shapes, the security of the people against suffering, sudden and unlooked for suffering, is encreased.  
  
Note. Examples (1) Consent. Self-defence. Lawful exercise of Public power. Lawful exercise of domestic power &amp;c. (2) Premeditation. Confederacy &amp;c. (3) Unintentionality Provocation (contemporaneous or recent) &amp;c (4) Insanity. Infancy &amp;c.  
  
5. Promulgation-paper: for formularies of all sorts, Conveyances and Agreements, as well as instruments of judicial procedure, paper, of a particular size and form and appearance in other respects, provided, with a margin of Letter-press, in and by which, in the instance of each such species of instrument, intimation is given of the whole text of the law relative to the species of transaction therein in question: intimation, Vizt. according to the quantity of room occupied by it, given, either in terminis, or in the way of abstract with indication of, and with reference to, any such portion, as is found to occupy too much room to be given in terminis.

All this while, incapable as it is of serving in any tolerable degree, in its present state, in the character of a rule of action and guide to human conduct, nothing could be much further from the truth, than if, in speaking of the matter of which English Common law is composed, a man were to represent it as being of no use. Confused, indeterminate, inadequate, illadapted, and inconsistent as, to a vast extent, the provision or the non provision would be found to be, that has been made for the various cases that have happened to present themselves for decision, yet in the character of a repository for such cases it affords, for the manufactory of law, a stock of materials which is beyond all price. Traverse the whole continent of Europe, ransack all the libraries belonging to the jurisprudential systems of the several political states, add the contents all together, you would not be able to compose a collection of cases equal in variety, in amplitude, in clearness of statement—in a word, all points taken together, in instructiveness—to that which may be seen to be afforded by the collection of English Reports of adjudged cases, on adding to them the abridgements and treatises, by which a sort of order, such as it is, has been given to their contents.  
Of these necessary materials, the stock already in hand is not only rich, but on

m of some one man, or society of men, in any  
one age, but of the wisdom, counsel, experience, and obser-  
vation of many ages of wise and observing men.” For this  
Mr. Bentham proposed to substitute the lueubrations of his  
single brain. Like Don Quixote, in his plan for the reseue  
of the Algerine captive, he undertook to do singly what had  
before been effected only by the accumulated power of  
thousands,  
  
In support of his proposition, he argues in effect as fol-  
lows: The law,” he says, “ instead of being the production  
of an intelligent le sgislator, acting with consistency and  
method, has been blundered out by a set of men, who,  
their course of action not being at their own command, but  
at the command of the plaintifis in the several causes, were  
all along as completely destitute of power as under the influ-  
ence of sinister interest; they could not but be of inclination  
to operate upon any clear and enlarged views of utility, or  
upon any comprehensive and consistent plan, good or bad.
