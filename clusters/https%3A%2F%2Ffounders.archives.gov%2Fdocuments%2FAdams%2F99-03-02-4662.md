he tolling of all the bells in the city, and other tokens of respect.—He was born Oct. 19. 1735.The Executive of the Commonwealth being in session on Wednesday, His Excellency the Governor announced that he had just received the melancholy intelligence of the decease of the venerable JOHN ADAMS, former President of the United States, and one of the three last surviving signers of the Declaration of Independence, who departed this life the preceding afternoon, at five o’clock, at his residence in Quincy. Whereupon the following resolve was passed:—Resolved, That the Supreme Executive of the Commonwealth, in testimony of the deep sense entertained by them of the eminent public usefulness and private worth of the deceased, one of the most distinguished patriots of the revolution and founders of American liberty, will, in their official capacity, attend the funeral obsequies of the late Hon. JOHN ADAMS, on Friday next, at 3 o’clock, P.M.Head Quarters, Boston, July 5th, 1826.GENERAL ORDERS.—His Excellency the Commander in Chief, having been informed that JOHN ADAMS, one of the signers of the declaration of American Independence, and a former President of the United States, departed this life, yesterday afternoon, while his fellow citizens were commemorating the Jubilee of that glorious event; and deeply impressed with the obligations which the long and distinguished services of the deceased have imposed on all posterity to honor his memory, emulate his patriotism and imitate his virtues,—orders that minute guns be fired in front of the State House, in Boston, from twelve to one o’clock this day; and, at Quincy, on Friday afternoon, during the performance of the funeral obsequies.Major General Crane is charged with the execution of this orderBy His Excellency’s Command.WM. H. SUMNER, Adj. General.On the receipt of the above tidings at Salem the bells of the town were tolled; and the Essex Register of yesterday, gave the following obituary notice of the life of the deceased:—DEATH OF JOHN ADAMS.On Tuesday last closed the half century since the patriots and sages of this country proclaimed its independence, and with its parting rays the spirit of the elder ADAMS ascended to Heaven. That bold and energetic spirit which inspired the councils of America with the determination to become independent has ascended on high, and that eloquent tongue which urged its declaration on the fourth of July, 1776, on the fourth of July, 1826, was palsied in death. Thus has terminated, and gloriously terminated, the virtuous and patriotic life of JOHN ADAMS—blessed by his country, honored by the world, and immortal as history. Amidst the bosom of  revolution has closed his mortal career, viewing as the patriarch of old, before his closing eyes, the expanding glories of his country the fruits of his exertions, and the blessings purchased by him for posterity. The ideas which occupy our minds in contemplating his  character and the period allotted by heaven for gathering him to his fathers, fill our hearts with such feelings as disable us from searching in books for the record of the many memorable incidents of his life, and we can only present such facts as are present to our memory.—His virtues and services will employ the most eloquent tongues in the nation, and his history be written by its ablest historian. His life and history are the history of liberty and the rights of man, triumphing over oppression, and founding a lasting empire on the broad foundation of the people’s will, and the happiness of the governed.President Adams was educated at Cambridge and to the profession of the law. So eminent was his standing in that profession, that at an early age he was appointed Chief Justice of the State, but he declined this office. Amid the force of excitement produced by the Boston massacre, he dared to undertake the defence of the British troops. His success in this trial was complete. It evinced his talents and his strong sense of justice and official duty. A less intrepid spirit would not have dared to stem the current of popular indignation by engaging in such a cause. But it is not in his professional life, but his political, that we are to trace his glorious career. He soon sacrificed his profession and every thing to the liberties of his fellow citizens and the independence of his country. In 1770 he was elected a representative from Boston, and in 1774 a member of the Council, but was negatived by Gov. Gage, from the part he took in politics. From 1770, and previous, and until 1776, he was constantly engaged, and took a leading part in all the measures which were adopted to defend the colonies from the unjust attacks of the British Parliament. He was one of the earliest that contemplated the independence of the country, and her separation from her mother country. No man in the Congress of 1776 did so much as he did to procure the declaration of independence. It is believed that the motion was made by a member from Virginia at his suggestion, that he seconded his motion and sustained it by most powerful and resistless argument. By his influence also Mr. Jefferson was placed at the head of the Committee who framed the declaration. His reason for procuring the motion to come from Virginia, and of placing one of her delegation at the head of the Committee, was to engage the hearty cooperation of that great State in the work of independence.By the committee who were appointed on the subject of a separation from the mother country, Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams were appointed a sub–committee to frame a Declaration of Independence. The draft reported was that of Mr. Jefferson, and he has deservedly received great credit for it. But those who consider how much easier it is to draft a report than to procure its passage and adoption, and who reflect that Mr. Jefferson never spoke in public, and that John Adams was the bold and daring spirit of the Congress of 1776, and the eloquent advocate of its boldest measures cannot fail to award him the highest honor which the adoption of that declaration could confer. From the declaration of Independence until the peace Mr. Adams was employed in the same glorious cause. Whilst Washington, at the head of our armies was fighting the battles of Liberty, and defending our country from the ravages of the enemy, Adams was employed in a service less brilliant, but scarcely less important. Through the whole war he was exerting his talents at the various Courts of Europe, to obtain loans and alliances and every succor to sustain our armies and the cause of Liberty and our Independence. Nor did  his labors cease until he had accomplished every object for which he was sent abroad not until he had sealed our Independence by a Treaty of Peace, which he signed, with Great Britain.Immediately after the Treaty of Peace, he was appointed Ambassador to Great–Britain;—on the adoption of the Constitution, he was elected first Vice President of the United States. During the whole period of the Presidency of Washington, Mr. Adams was Vice President. He was as uniformly consulted by Washington as though he had been a member of his cabinet, on all important questions. On the death of Washington, Mr. Adams was elected his successor.During the administration of Mr. Adams, party spirit raged without restraint. Too independent himself to wear the trammels of either party, he was warmly supported by neither. Too open for concealment, and perfectly void of guile and intrigue, he practised no arts to secure himself in power. At the expiration of his first term, Mr. Jefferson, the candidate of the Republican party, and his successful competitor, received four votes more that Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams then retired to private life at his seat in Quincy.When the foreign aspect of our country became clouded, and difficulties over shadowed it, he came forth the warmest advocate of the rights of the country, and of those measures of the administration calculated to sustain them. His letter in defence of our seamen against foreign impressment, is one of the ablest and most irresistable arguments in the English language. So satisfied were those who had been politically opposed to him, of his merits and services, that he was selected by Republicans of Massachusetts, as their candidate for Governor, on the death of Gov. Sullivan—but he declined again entering into public life. He was one of the Electors, and President of the Electoral College, when Mr. Monroe was elected President of the U. States. Having been the principal draftsman of the Constitution of this State, when the Convention was called to amend it in 1820, he was unanimously elected their President. On his declining this honor, unanimous resolutions were passed by this great assembly of five hundred selected from all parties, expressive of their exalted sense of his merits and public services.The private character of President Adams was perfectly pure, unsullied and unstained. There was no Christian or moral duty which he did not fulfil; the kindest of husbands and the best of fathers. To the excellent precepts and education which he gave his children, the nation are undoubtedly indebted for having at this time at their head his eldest son.President Adams was serene and tranquil to the last. Conscious of having performed his duty, and of a life well spent and devoted to his country, the blasts of calumny which assailed his declining years never ruffled the serenity of his mind. He regarded them as little as the troubled elements, for he knew that like them they would soon subside, and that then, every thing would be like his own bosom, peace and sunshine. To say that he had weak points and foibles is but to say that he was a man. But his defects were those of a bold and daring spirit, an open, generous and confiding heart. He knew no guile and he feared none. Having no selfish purposes to answer, he practiced no arts to effect them. At the age of ninety, at the completion of a half century from the commencement of that revolution he had been so instrumental in effecting, he sunk by gradual decay into the arms of death. He lived to see his country’s liberties placed on a firm and immovable basis, and the light of liberty which she diffused enlightening the whole earth. On the Jubilee of Independence, his declining faculties were roused by the rejoicings in the metropolis. He inquired the cause of the salutes, and was told it was the fourth of July. He answered, “it is a great and glorious day.” He never spake more. Thus his last thoughts and his latest words were like those of his whole life, thoughts and words which evinced a soul replete with love of country and interest in her welfare.Interment of Mr. Adams.Agreeably to arrangements made the remains of the Hon. JOHN ADAMS, were entombed yesterday afternoon, at Quincy, with every token of veneration, respect, and affection.An immense body of citizens assembled from various parts of the State. Several carriages were from Salem and more remote townsA corps of artillery, stationed on Mount Wallaston, fired minute guns, during the whole time of the funeral services, and several similar tokens of respect were heard in the adjoining towns; the bells of which were tolled and the flag on various gun-houses, &amp;c. were hoisted half–staff.The Relatives of the deceased, the Societies and others, assembled at the late President’s mansion.The citizens of Quincy met in the town–hall, organized, and moved in a body to the vicinity of the mansion–house, when, about 4 o’clock the Funeral Procession was formed, under the direction of several Marshals, composed of Gentlemen of Quincy.ORDER OF PROCESSIONMarshall.Citizens of Quincy.Undertaker.Pall Bearers,Pall Bearers,Judge DAVIS.(drawing) Hon.

The House was thronged.The services commenced and closed with anthems. The Rev. Mr. Whitney, Pastor of the Society, addressed the Throne of Grace in prayer, and delivered an impressive Sermon, in which he gave a summary of the eminent services, distinguished talents, amiable life, and Christian virtues of his venerated parishionour.The body was them borne to the burial ground, and deposited in the family tomb.For the CentinelON THE DEATH OF JOHN ADAMS.WHAT mean these bells that thus incessant toll?Why doth that cannon’s roar each moment roll?The flags at half–mast hang? But yesterdayThey crown’d each top–mast with a proud display.The echoes of the song yet fill our Halls;Ensigns of Triumph decorate their walls:Our last night’s bonfires still are burning low.What means this medley strange of joy and wo?Grief hath no limits, sorrow seems to rage.But once before such gloom has wrapp’d our age.But look above! what spirit hov’ring there,E’en now waits midway in those realms of air?His wings are upward, yet he looks below;He’s summon’d heavenward, yet seems loth to go.Angels attendant on his passage wait,And heaven unfolds to him its golden gate,And, lo, our WASHINGTON brings forth a crown,Yet still his looks on us are bended down,And ev’n while heaven receives his saluted part,His look proclaims his Country hath his heart.The silent tears of every rank and ageAnnounce the loss of QUINCY’S PATRIOT SAGE.In days of danger, peril was his pride.In hours of darkness, prudence was his guide.In times of tempest, at the helm of state,His grasp was nervous; but his look sedate;His eye was watchful; and his arm was strong;His care incessant, and his vigils long;His mind decisive; and the deed design’dBeam’d twin–born with the thought that fill’d his mind;Or else, so instantly the deed was wrought,Volition seem’d the secundine of thought;Yet no untimely birth brought plan obscure,Weak, or not vigorous, or immature.His youth’s first queries manhood’s mind engage.His youthful doubts were oft unsolv’d by age.Where e’er he question’d, doubt was sure to rise;But where he doubted, wisdom slowly replies.We saw his look the mirror of his mind,Contemplative, determin’d, well defin’d.In council ready; lucid in debate;In mind decisive; purpose, sure as fate;In action prompt; and fertile in design,With rich  still exhaustless mine;With genius bright, and yet, endowment rare,The skill of prudence, the reserve of care.His courage seconded, with dauntless hand,The boldest measures which his daring plann’d.His foresight seem’d to men prophetic gaze.Undaunted he beheld war’s lightning blaze,He mark’d its progress, told its coming path,And seiz’d the rod to shield us from its wrath:Wrapp’d in a cloud we saw him fearless rock,Unscath’d by lightning and the thunder’s shock;Fast round his form the fiery flashes fall,He eyes, sustains, averts, directs them all.He trod a pathway unexplor’d before;An unknown ocean, midst a tempest’s roar.Men’s hearts misgave them as they rode its waves;He fires their courage, every danger braves;With vigorous arm the barque of State he steers,Till Freedom’s land in view, all green, appears.Past are the dangers of that troubled deepCall’d Revolution; where whole nations sleep.Pass’d are those bars which passion’s currents raise,Ambition, envy, pride, in counter ways.The shoals and quicksands of the shore are past,Where wrecks of proud Republics have been cast.There lie the vestiges of Grecian power;Of Macedonia’s interregnum hour.There are the ruins of each later age,Since Macedonia’s storm of civil rage;When hate and envy all the East invest,While Rome’s ambitious pride convuls’d the West;When factions, urg’d o’er factions fallen, swell,From Perdiccas till old Beleucus fell:Last of that far–famed band who made their ageA bloody portraiture of civil rage.There is the wreck of Carthagenian fame;And there the remnant of the Roman name.Let France, let England’s Commonwealth’s men teachOur Sage’s prudence, forecast, mental reach.Nay, look at States and laws more near our own,The same preeminence is clearly shown.And though no Delphian oracle foretoldHis plans more perfect than all codes of old,The wisdom of our Fathers early sawThe voice Lycurgus needed for his fame,To them in wisdom’s surer accents came.Useless and vain the aid of pomp or art,To gain their voices, or secure their heart.Spartans were bold, Atheneans were refin’d,Our nation’s master–trait is strength of mind.And he whose loss his country now deplores,Might boast of wisdom’s choicest, richest stores.He scann’d the faults of every nation’s laws:He knew the every need of Freedom’s cause.He liv’d to witness what his youth had plann’dWas wisely counsel’d, and was justly scann’d.His wisdom our anelle, he was madeTo claim our trust without Egeria’s aid.And Quincy’s record, on the page of fame,Shall stand with Cyprus, and with Ardea’s name.Grave in the Senate, such his noble mienAs in that ancient Forum once was seen,When the wild Gaulish army paus’d in awe,And haughty Brennus bow’d at what he saw,When first those Senators of Rome he view’d,Sitting in silence, dauntless, unsubdued,And thought those white–robed men, so small the odds,No captive Senate, but assembled Gods.So sat that Congress which declar’d, that We,The people of these States, were thenceforth Free.And British soldiers, fir’d with noble flame,Wept that to fratricide most base they came.With sword and musket, they oppugn our laws;With heart and soul, they cry, God speed the cause.But still for King and Duty bold they fight;And yet we conquer in the name of Right.‘Twas then, so Adams, and his compeers, turn’d,The eyes of all the path of Freedom learn’d.‘Twas then, attentive to their deep debates,We learn’d the destinies of Sovereign States.‘Twas then, as mov’d by accents from the skies,While all our gathering glory he descries,Our Adams spoke: “I see through all the gloom,The rays of light and glory which illumeOur risen country; I can see the endIs more than worth the means that we expend.Posterity shall triumph in the causeOf Liberty, Religion, Equal Laws.Then solemnise this day by praise to Heaven,With pomp, shows, games, guns, bells, from morn till even,Throughout this Continent one chorus send,From this time forth, till time itself shall end.”One half a century hath roll’d away,And pomp, shows, games, guns, bells, proclaim the day.Yes, we have stood at dawn on Bunker’s height,And seen the sun roll forth his Fiftieth Light,And heard the welcomings which Freemen raiseOn this the proudest of their festal days.O ‘twas a thrilling, an ennobling hour!Nor Greek, nor Roman breast e’er felt its power.And then to pass our streets, each walk, each square,And see fair forms, gay hearts, bright faces there,Who as he saw this sight, and felt that glow,Wish’d not a pilgrimage of pride to go,To kneel beside the bed of Quincy’s sage,To hail him Father of this happy age.

rily lid to exclaim, can it be the work of  
chante, or is it not rather the direction of a  
supelintending Providence ?  
DJATH OF JOHN ADAMS.  
O&gt; Tuesday la«t closed the haif cen­  
tury since the patriots and sages of ibis  
country proclaimed its independence,  
and with iis parting rays the spirit of  
ibe elder ADAMS ascended to heaven.  
That bold and energetic spirit which  
inspired the councils of America with  
the determination to become indepen­  
dent, has ascended on high ; md (bat el  
oquent tongue which uiged i s declara­  
tion on the fourth of July, 1776, on the  
fourth of July, 1826, is palsied in  
death. Thus has terminated, and glo­  
riously terminated the virtuous and pa­  
triotic life of JOHN ADAMS—blessed  
by his country, honored by the world,  
and immortal as history. Amidst the  
bosom of his family, the patriarch of the  
revolution has closed his mortal career,  
viewing, as a patriarch of old, before  
, his closing eyes, the expanding glories  
।of his country, the fruits of his exer­  
-1 tions, and the blessings purchased by  
him for posterity. The ideas whicli oc­  
cupy our minds in contemplating his  
character, and the period allotted by  
Heaven for gathering him to his fathers,  
fill our hearts with such feelings as dis­  
able us from searching in books for the  
record of the many memorable incidents  
of his life ; and we can only present  
such facts as are present to our memo­  
ry. His virtues and services will em­  
ploy the most eloquent tongues in the  
  
nalitm, and his history be written by its  
ablest historian. His life and history  
are the history of liberty and rights of  
man, triumphing over oppression, and  
founding a lasting empire on the broad  
foundation of (he people’s will, and the  
happiness of the governed.  
President Adams was educated at  
Cambridge, and to the profession of (he  
law. So eminent was his standing in  
that profession, that at an early age he  
was appointed Chief Justice of the State,  
but he declined this office. Amid the  
force of excitement produced by the  
Boston massacre, he dared to unde.*  
take the defence of the British troops.  
His success in this trial was&#x27;complete.—  
It evinced his talents, and his strong  
sense of justice and official duty. A  
less intrepid spirit would not have dar­  
ed Io stein the current of popular indig-  
  
nation by engaging in such a cause.—  
But, it is not in his professional life, but  
his political, (bat we are to trace his  
glorious career. He scon sacrificed  
his profession and every thing to the  
liberties of his fellow-citizens, and the  
independence of his country. In 1770  
he was elected a Representative from  
Boston ; and, in 1774, a member of the  
Council, but was negatived by Gov.  
Gage, from the part he took in politics.  
From 1770 and previous, and until  
1770, he was constantly&#x27; engaged, and  
took a leading part in all the measures  
which were adopted to defend the colo­  
nies from the unjust attacks of the Brit­  
ish Parliament. He was one of (he  
earliest that contemplated the indepen­  
dence of the country, and her separa­  
tion from the mother country. No man  
  
in the Congress of 1776 did so much as  
he did to procure the declaration of In­  
dependence. It is believed that the  
motion was made by a member from  
Virginia at his suggestion—that he sec­  
onded the motion and sustained it by  
most powerful and resistless argument.  
Bv his influence also, Mr. Jefferson was  
placed at the head of the Committee  
who framed the declaration. His rea­  
son for procuring the motion to come  
from Virginia, and of placing one of her  
delegation at the head of ibe Commit­  
tee, was to engage the hearty co-ope­  
ration of that great State in the work  
of independence. By the Committee  
who were appointed on the subject of a  
separation from the mother country,  
  
Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams were ap­  
pointed a sub-committee to frame a De­  
claration of Independence. The draft  
reported, was that of Mr. Jefferson, and  
he has deservedly received great credit  
for it. But those who consider how  
much easier it is to draft a report than  
to procure its passage and adoption,  
and who reflect, that Mr. Jefferson nev­  
er spoke in public, and that John Adams  
was the bold and daring sph it of the |  
Congress of 1776, and the eloquent ad-  
  
vocate of its boldest measures, cannot  
fail to award him the highest honor  
which the adoption of that declaration  
could confer. From the declaration of  
Independence until the peace. Mr. Ad­  
ams was employed in the same glorious  
cause. Whilst Washington, at the head  
of our armies, was fighting the battles  
of liberty, and defending our country  
from the ravages of the enemy, Adams  
was employed in a service less brilliant,  
but scarcely less important. Through  
iho whole war, he was exerting his tal­  
ents ai (he various Courts of Europe, to  
obtain loans and alliances, and every |  
succor to sustain our armies, and the  
cause of Liberty and our Independence. •  
Nor did his labors cease until he had;  
sealed our Independence by a treaty of  
peace, which he signed with Great-Brit­  
ain.  
  
Immediately after the treaty of peace,  
he was appointed Ambassador to Great-  
Britain. On the adoption of the Con­  
stitution, he was elected first Vice-Pres­  
ident oi the United Slates. During the  
whole period of the Presidency of  
Washington, Mr. Adams was Vice. Pre­  
sident. He was as uniformly consulted  
by Washington as though he had been a  
member of his cabinet, on all important  
questions. Oa the death of Washing­  
ton, Mr. Adams was elected his succes­  
sor.  
During (he administration of Mr. Ad­  
ams, party spirit raged without restraint.  
&#x27;l’oo independent himself to wear the  
trammels of either party, he was warm­  
ly supported by neither. Too open  
for concealment, and perfectly void of  
guile and inttigue, he practised no aits  
to secure himself in power. At the ex­  
piration of the first term, Mr. Jeff-rson,  
the candidate of the Republican parly,  
and his successful competitor, received  
four votes more than Mr. Adams. Mr.  
Adams then retired to private life at his  
seat in Quincy.  
  
He was one of the Electors, and  
President of the Electoral College,  
when Mr. Monroe was elected President  
of the United States. Having been the  
principal draftsman of the Constitution  
of this Slate, when the Convention was  
called to amend it in 1820, he was unan­  
imously elected their President. On  
hi? declining this honor, unanimous res­  
olutions were passed by this great as­  
sembly of five hundred, selected from  
all parties, expressive of their exalted  
sense of his merits and public services.  
The private character of President  
Adams was perfectly pure, unsullied,  
and unstained. There was no Chris­  
tian or moral duty which he did not ful­  
fil ; the kindest of husbands and the best  
of fathers. To the excelled precepts  
and education which he gave his chil­  
dren, the nation are undoubtedly indebt­  
ed for having at this time at their head  
his eldest son.  
  
President Adams was serene and (ran­  
quil to the last. Conscious of having  
pet formed his duly, and of a life well  
spent and devoted to his country, the  
blasts of calumny whjch assailed his de­  
clining years, never ruffled the serenity  
of bis mind. He regarded them ns lit­  
tle as the troubled elements; for he  
knew that like -them they would soon  
subside, and that then every thing  
would be like his own bosom, peace and  
sunshine. To say that he had weak  
points and foibles, is but to say that be  
was a man. But his defects .were those  
of a bold and daring spirit, an open, gen-,  
erous and confiding heart. Ue knew  
no guile and he feared none. Having  
no selfish purposes to answer, he prac­  
tised no arts to effect them. At the age  
of ninety, at the completion of half a  
century from the commencement of  
that revolution he had been so instru-  
  
mental in effecting, he sunk by gradual  
decay into the arms of death. lie lived  
to see his country&#x27;s liberties placed on  
a firm and immovable basis, and (he  
light of liberty which she diffused en­  
lightening the whole earth. On the  
Jubilee of Independence, his declining  
faculties were roused by the rejoicings  
in the metropolis. He inquired the  
cause of the salutes, and was (old it was  
the fourth of July. He answered, “it  
is a great and glorious day.” He never  
spake more. Thus his last thoughts  
and hi* latest words were like those of)  
his whole life, thoughts and words  
which evinced a soul replete with love  
of countiy, and interest in her welfare.

FENELON.  
From the Essex Register.  
DEATH OF JOHN ADAMS.  
On Tuesday last closed the half century since  
the patriots and sages of this country proclaim­  
ed its independence, and with its parting rays  
the spirit of the elder ADAMS ascended to  
heaven That bold and energetic spirit which  
inspired the council of America with the deter­  
mination to become independent has ascended  
on high, and that eloquent tongtie which urged  
its declaration on the 4th of July, 1776, on the  
4th of July, 1826, was palsied in death. Thus  
has terminated, and gloriously terminated the  
virtuous and patriotic life of JOHN ADAMS  
—blessed by his country, honored by the world,  
and immortal as history. Amidst the bosom of  
  
his family, the patriarch of the revolution has j  
closed his mortal caieer, viewing, as a patriarch ,  
of old, before his closing eyes, the expanding I  
glories of his country, the fruits of his exer­  
tions, and the blessings purchased by him for  
posterity. The ideas which, occupy our minds  
in contemplating his character and the period  
allotted by heaven for gathering him to his la­  
thers, fill our hearts with such feelings as dis­  
able us from searching in books for the record  
of the many memorable incidents of his life,  
and we can only present such facts as are pre­  
sent to our memory. His virtues and services  
will employ the most eloquent longues in the  
nation, and his history be written by its ablest  
historian. His life and history are the history  
of liberty and the rights of man, triumphing o­  
ver oppression, and founding a lasting empiie  
on the broad foundation oi the peoples will,  
and the happiness of the governed.  
President Adams was educated at Cambridge,  
and to the profession of the law. So eminent  
was his standing in that profession, that at an  
early age he &quot;as appointed Chi I Justiceot the  
State, but he declined this office. Amid the  
force of excitement produced by the Boston  
massacre, he eland to undertake the defence of  
  
the British troops. His success m this trial was  
complete: It evinced his talents and his strong  
sense e-.f justice and Official duty. A less intre­  
pid spirit would not have dared to stem the cur­  
rent of popular indignation by engaging in such  
a cause. Hut it is not in his professional life  
but his political, that we are to trace his g&lt;ori­  
ous career. He soon sacrified bis profession and  
every thing to the liberties of his follow citizens  
and the independence of his country. In &#x27;770  
he was elected a representative lrum Boston,  
and in 1774 a member of the Council, hut was  
negatived by Gov. Gage from the part he took  
in politics. From 1770 and previous, and until  
1776, he was constantly engaged, &amp; took a lead­  
ing part in all the measures which were adopted  
to defend the colonies from the unjust attacks of  
the British Parliament. He was one of the ear­  
liest that contemplated the independence ot the  
country, £c her seperation from the mother coun­  
try. No man in the Congress of 1776 did so  
much as he did to procure the declaration cl  
Independence. It is believed that the motion  
was made by a member from \ irginia at his  
suggestion, that he seconded the motion anil  
sustained it by most powerful and resistless ar­  
gument. By bis influence also, Mr. Jefferson  
was placed at the head ot the committee who  
f:anted the declaration. His reason for procur­  
ing the motion to come from Virginia, and of  
placing one of her.delegation at the head of the  
Committee, was to engage the hearty co-opera­  
tion of that great “State in the work of indepen­  
dence. By tht committee who were appointed  
on the subject of a separation from the mother  
country, Air. Jefferson and Mr. Adams were  
appointed u sub-committee to frame a declara­  
tion of Independence. 1 he draft reported, was  
that of Mr. Jirfferson, and he has deservedly re­  
ceived great credit for it. But those who con­  
sider how much easier it is to draft a report  
than to procure its passage and adoption, and  
who reflect, that Mr. Jefferson never spoke in  
public, and that John Adams was the bold and  
daring spirit of the Congress of 1776, and the  
eloquent ad&#x27;ocate of its boldest measures, can­  
not fail to award him the highest honor which  
ih*1 adop- ion of that declaration could confer.  
From the declaration of independence until the  
peace, Mr. Adams was employed in the same  
glorious cause. V hilst A ashington, at the  
head of our armies w^s fi-hling the battles of  
Liberty, and defending our country from the  
ravages of the enemy, Adams was employed  
in a service less brilliant, hut scarcely less im­  
portant. Through the whole war, he was ex­  
erting his talents at the various courts of Eu­  
rope, to obtain loans and alliances, and every  
succor to sustain our armies and the cause ol  
Liberty and our Independence. Nor did his  
labors cease until he. had accomplished every  
object for which he was sent abroad, nor until  
he had sealed our Independence by a Treaty of  
Peace, which he signed, with Great Britain.  
Immediately after the Treaty of Feace, lie  
was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain;  
on the adoption of the Constitution he was c­  
lected first Vice President of the United States.  
During the whole period ot the Presidency ot  
Washington, Mr. Adams was Vice President,  
tie was as uniformly consulted by Washington  
as though he had been a member of his cabi­  
net, on all important questions. On the death  
of Washington, Mr. Adams was elected his  
successor.  
During the administration of Mr. Adams,  
party spirit raged without restraint. loo in­  
dependent himself to wear the trammels of ei­  
ther party, he was warmly supported by neither.  
Too open for concealment, and perfectly void  
of guile and intrigue, he practised no arts to  
secure himself in power. At the expiration ol  
the first term, Mr. Jefferson, the candidate of  
the Republican party, and his successful com­  
petitor, received four votes more than Mr  
Adams. Mr. Adams then retired to private  
life at his seat in Quincy.  
  
Whentlje foreign uspcct-ot our country oc­  
eanic clouded, and difficulties overshadowed it,  
he came forth the warmest advocate of the  
rights ot the country, and of those measures  
of the adrn inislration calculated to sustain them.  
11 is letter in defence of our seamen against fo­  
reign impressment, is one of the ablest and  
most irresistible arguments in the English lan­  
guage. So satisfied were those who had been  
politically opposed to him, of his merits and  
services, that he was selected by the republi­  
cans of Massachusetts, as their candidate for  
Governor, on the death of Gov. Sullivan—but  
he declined again entering into public life.  
He was one of the Electors, and President of  
the Electoral College, when Mr. Monroe was  
elected President of the United States. Hav­  
ing been the principal draftsman of the Con­  
stitution of this state, when the Convention was  
called to amend it in 1820, he was unanimous-(  
ly elected their President. On his declining  
this honor, unanimous resolutions were passed  
by this great assembly of five hundred, select­  
ed from all parties, expressive of their exalted  
sense of his merits and public services.  
The private character of President Adams  
was perfectly pure, unsullied and unstained.—  
There was no Christian or moral duty which  
he did not fulfil; the kindest of husbands and  
the best of fathers. To the excellent precepts  
and education which he gave liis children, the  
  
ration arc undoubtedly indebted for having at  
this time at their head his eldest son.  
President Adams was serene and tranquil to  
the last. Conscious of having performed his  
duty, and of a life well spent and devoted to  
1 is country, the blasts of calumny which as­  
sailed his declining years never ruffled the se­  
renity of his mind Ht regarded them as lit­  
tle as the troubled elements, lor he knew that  
like them they would soon subside, and that  
then, every thing would be like his own bosom,  
peace and sunshine, Io say that he had weak  
points and fdibles, is but to say that lie was a i  
man. But his defects were those of a bold and

From the Boston Centincl.  
ON THE DEATH OF JOHN ADAMS.  
WHAT mean these bells that thus incessant toll5  
Why doth that cannon’s roar each moment roll5  
The flags at half-mast hang5 But yesterday  
They crown’d each top mast with a proud display.  
The echoes of the song yet fill our Halls;  
Ensigns of Triumph decorate their walls:  
Our last night&#x27;s bonfires still are burning low.  
What means this medley strange of joy and wo5  
tirief hath no limits, sorrow seems to rage.  
Rut once before such gloom has wrapp’d our age.  
But look above! what spirit hov’ring there,  
E’en now waits midway in those realms of air?  
Ills wings are upward, yet he looks beh&gt;w;  
lie’s summon’d heavenward, yet seems loth to go.  
Angels attendant on his passage wait,  
Ami heaven unfolds to him its golden gate,  
And, lo, our WASHINGTON brings forth a crown,  
Vet still his looks on us are bended down,  
And ev’n while heaven receives his sainted part,  
His look proclaims his Country hath his heart.  
The silent tears of every rank and age  
Announce the loss of QUINCY’S PATRIOT SAGE.  
In day9 of danger, peril was his pride.  
In hours of darkness, prudence was his guide.  
In times of tempest, at the helm of state,  
His grasp, was nervous; but his look sedate;  
His eye was w atchful; and his arm w as strong;  
His care incessant, and his vigils long;  
His mind decisive; and the deed design’d  
Seem’d tw in born with the thought that fill’d his mind;  
Or else, so instantly the deed was wrought,  
Volition seem’d the secundine of thought;  
Y&#x27;et no untimely birth brought plan obscure,  
Weak, or not vigorous, or immature.  
II.s youth’s first queries manhood’s mind engage.  
Jib youthful doubts were oft unsolv’d by age.  
Where e’re he question’d, doubt was sure to rise;  
But where he doubted, w isdum slow replies.  
We saw his look the mirror of his mind.  
Contemplative, determin’d, well defin’d.  
In council ready; lucid in debate;  
In mind decisive; purpose, sure as fate;  
In action prompt; and fertile in design,  
With rich invention’s still exhaustless mine;  
With genius bright, and yet, endowment rare,  
The skill of prudence, the reserve of care.  
His courage seconded, with dauntless hand,  
The boldest measures&#x27;* hich his daring plann’d.  
His foresight seem’d to men prophetic gaze.  
Undaunted he beheld war’s lightning blaze,  
ile mark’d its progress, told its coming path,  
And seiz’d the rod to shield us from its wrath:  
Wrapp’d in a cloud we saw him tearless rock,  
Unscath’d by lightning ami the thunder’s shock;  
Fast round his form the fierv flashes fall,  
He eyes, sustains, averts, directs them all.  
  
He trod a pathway uncxplor’d before;  
An unknown ocean, midst a tempest’s roar.  
Men’s hearts misgave them as they rode its waves;  
He fires their courage, every danger braves;  
With vigorous arm the barque ofSta»e he steers,  
Till Freedom’s land in view, all green, appears.  
Past are the dangers-of that troubled deep  
Call’d Revolution; where whole nations sleep.  
Pass’ll are those bars which passion’s currents raise,  
Ambition, envy, pride, in counter ways.  
The shoals and quicksands of the shore arc past,  
Where wrecks of proud Republics have been cast.  
There lie the vestiges of Grecian power;  
. ‘of Macedonia’s interregnum hour.  
There are the ruins of each later age,  
Since Macedonia’s storm of civil rage;  
When hate and envy all the “East invest,  
While Rome’s ambitious pride convuls’d the West;  
When factions urg’d o’er factions fallen, swell,  
From Perdiccas till old Seleucus fell:  
Last ot that far-famed band who made their age  
A bloody portraiture of civil rage.  
There is the wreck ot&#x27; Carthagenian fame;  
And there the remnant of the Roman name.  
Let France, let England’s Commonwealth’s-men teach  
Our Sage’s prudence, forecast, mental reach.  
Nav, look at States and laws more near our own,  
The same preeminence is clearly shown.  
And though no Delphian oracle foretold  
His plans more perfect than all codes of old,  
The wisdom of our Father’s early sa

The all but faultlessness of every law.  
The voice Lycurgus needed for his fame,  
To then* in wisdom’s surer accents came.  
Useless and vain the aid ot pomp or art,  
To gain their voices, or secure their heart.  
Spartans were bold, Athenians were refined,  
Our nation’s master-trait »s strength ot mind.  
And he whose loss his country now deplores.  
Might boast of wisdom’s choicest, richest stores. .  
He scann’d the faults of every nation’s laws:  
He knew the every need of Freedom’s cause.  
He liv’d to witness what his youth had plann’d  
Was wisely counael’d, and was justly scann’d.  
His wisdom our ancilc, he w as made  
  
To claim our trust witnout Egeria&#x27;s aid.  
And Quincy’s record, on the page of fame,  
Shall stand with Cjprus, and with Ardea’s name­  
Grave in the Senate, such his noble mien  
As in that ancient Forum once was seen,  
When the wild Gaulish army paus’d in awe,  
And haughty Brennus bow’d at what he saw,  
When first those Senators of Rome he viewed,  
Sitting in Silence, dauntless, unsubdued,  
And thought those white-robed men, so small the odds,  
No captive Senate, but assembled Gods.  
So sat that Congress which declar’d, that We,  
The people of these States, were thenceforth Free.  
And British soldiers, fir’d with noble flame,  
Wept that to fratricide most base they came.  
With sword aud musket, they oppugn our laws;  
With heart and soul, they cry, God speed the cause..  
But still tor king and Duty bold they fight;  
And yet we conquer in the name of Right.  
’Twas then, to Adams, and his compeers, turn’d,  
The eyes of all the path of Freedom learn’d.  
’Twas then, attentive to their deep debates,  
We learn’d the destinies of Sovereign States.  
•Twas then, as moved by accents from the skies,  
While all our gathering glory he descries,  
Our Adams spoke: &quot;1 see through all the gloom,  
“The rays of light and glory which illume  
“Our risen country; I can see the end  
“Is more than worth the means that we expend.  
“Posterity shall triumph in the cause  
“Of Liberty, Religion, Equal Laws.  
“Then solemnize this day by praise to Heaven, [even,  
“With pomp, shows, games, guns, hells, from morn till  
“Throughout this Continent, one chorus send,  
“From this time forth, till time itself shall end.”  
One haif a century hath roll’d away,  
And pomp, shows, games,guns, bells, proclaim the day.  
Yes, we have stood at dawn on Bunker’s height,  
And seen the sun *)U forth his Fiftieth Light,  
And heard the wclcomings which freemen raise  
On this the proudest of their festal days.  
O ’twas a thrilling an ennobling hour!  
Nor Greek, nor Roman breast e’er felt its power.  
And then to pass our streets, each walk, each square,  
And see fair forms, gay hearts, bright faces there,  
Who, as he saw this sight, and felt that glow,  
Wish’d not a pilgrimage of pride to go,  
To kneel beside the bed of Quincy’s sage,  
To hail him Father of this happy age. OROLIO.

ington, at the head of our armies, was fighting the  
patties of liberty, and defending our country from the  
ravages of the enemy, Adams was employed in a ser-  
vice less brilliant, but scarcely less important.  
Through the whole war, he was exerting his talents  
ut the various courts of Europe, to obtain loans and  
ulliances, and every succour to sustain our armies  
and the cause of liberty and our independence. Nor  
did his labors cease until he had accomplished every  
object for which he was sent abroad, nor until he  
had sealed our independence by a treaty of peace,  
which he signed with Great Britain.  
  
Immediately after the treaty of peace, he was ap-  
pointed ambassador to Great Britain—on the adop-  
tion of the constitution, he was elected first vice pre-  
sident of the United States. During the whole pe-  
riod of the presidency of Washington, Mr. Adams  
Was vice president. He was as uniformly consulted  
by Washington as though he had been a member of  
lis cabinet, on all important questions. On the  
death of Washington, Mre Adams was elected his  
successor.  
  
During the administration of Mr. Adams, party  
spirit raged without restraint. Too independent  
himself to wear the trammels of either party, he was  
warmly supported by neither. Too open for conceal-  
ment, and perfectly void of guile and intrigue, he  
practised no arts to secure himselfin power. Atthe  
¢xpiration of his first term, Mr. Jetlerson, the candi-  
date of the republican pasty, and his successful com-  
petitor, received four votes more than Mr. Adams.  
Mr. Adams then retired to private life at his seatin  
Quincy.  
  
When the foreign aspect of our country became  
clouded, and difficulties overshadowed it, he came  
forth the warmest advocate of the rights of the coun-  
ury, and of those measures of the administration cal-  
culated to sustain them. Wis letter in defence of our  
seamen against foreign impressment, is one of the  
ablest and most irresistiblé arguments in the En-  
glish language. So satisfied were those who had  
been politically opposed to him, of his merits and  
services, that he was selected by the republicans of  
Slassachusetts, as their candidate for governor, on  
the death of gov. Sullivan—but he declined again en-  
tering into public life. He was one of the electors,  
and president of the electoral college, when Mr.  
Monroe was elected president of the U. States. Hav-  
ing been the principal draftsman of the constitution  
of this state, when the convention was called to  
amend itin 1820, he was unanimously elected their  
president. On his declining this honor, unanimous  
resolutions were passed by this great assembly of five  
hundred, selected from all parties, expressive of  
their exalted sense of his merits and public services,  
  
The private character of president Adams was per-  
jeetly pure, unsuilied and unstained. ‘There was no  
Christian or moral duty which he did net fulfil—  
the kindest of husbands and the best of fathers. To  
the excellent precepts and education which he gave  
his children, the nation are, undoubtedly, indebted  
for having, at this time, at their head his eldest son.  
  
President Adams was serene and tranquil to the  
last. Conscious of having performed his duty, and  
of a life well spent and devoted to his country, the  
blasts of calumny which assailed his declining years  
never rufiled the serenity of his mind. He regarded  
them as little as the troubied elemients, tor he knew  
thatiike them they Would soon subside, and that thei  
every thing would be hike his own bosom, peace and  
sunshine. To say that he had weak posnts and for-  
bles, is but to say tnat he was aman. Buthis defects  
were those of a bold and daring spirit, an open, ge-  
nerous and confiding heart. He knew no guile and  
he feared none. Llaving no selfish purposes to an-  
swer, he practised no arts toeffect them. Atthe age  
of ninety, at the completion of a half century from  
  
the commencement of that revolution he had bv ea so  
instrumental in effecting, he sunk by gradual decay  
into the arms of death. He lived to see his country’s  
liberties placed on a firm and immoveable ‘basis, and  
the light of liberty which she diffused enlightening  
the whole earth.

as a token of respect for the public servi­  
ces and memory of Mr. Adams. The  
Mayor called another meeting of the citi­  
zens to be held on the 11th inst.  
  
DBA7H OF »)BV A25AIVES.  
On Tuesday last closed the half century  
since*the patriots and sages of this country  
proclaimed its independence, and with its  
parting rays the spirit of the elder ADAMS  
ascended to heaven. That bold and ener­  
getic spirit which inspired the councils of  
America with the determination to become  
independent has ascended on high, and that  
eloquent tongue which urged its declara­  
tion on the fourth of July, 1776, on the  
fourth of July, 1826, was palsied in death.  
Thus has, t.ermiuated, and gloriously ter­  
minated, the virtuous and patriotic life ol  
JOHN ADAMS—blessed by his country,  
honored by the world, and immortal as his­  
tory. Amidst the bosom of his family,  
the patriarch of the revolution has closed  
his morBfr career, viewing, as a patriarch  
of old, before his closing eyes, the expan­  
ding glories of his country, the fruits of his  
exertions, and the blessings purchased by  
him for posterity. Tire ideas which occu­  
py our minds in contemplating his charac­  
ter and the period allotted by heavon for  
gathering him to his fathers, fill our hearts  
with such feelings as disable ns from search­  
ing in books for the record of the many  
memorable incidents of his life, and we  
can only present such facts as &#x27;ire present  
to our memory. His virtues and services  
will employ the most eloquent tongues in  
the nation, and his history be written by  
its ablest historian. His life and history  
are the history of liberty and the rights of  
man, triumphing over oppression, and foun­  
ding a lasting empire on the broad founda­  
tion of the people’s will, and the happiness  
of the governed.  
President Adams was educated at Cam­  
bridge, and to the profession of the law.  
So eminent was his standing in that pro­  
fession, that at an eai-ly age he was appoint­  
ed Chief Justice of the State, but he de­  
clined this office. Amid the force of ox­  
citement produced by the Boston massacre,  
he dared to undertake the defence of the  
British troops, His success in this trial  
was complete. It evinced his talents and  
his strong sense of justice and official duty,  
A less intrepid spirit would not have dared  
to stem the current of popular indignation  
by engaging in such a cause. But it is not  
in his professional life, but in his political,  
that wo are to traco his glorious career.  
He soon sacrificed his profession and every  
thing to the liberties of his fellow-citizens  
and the independence of his country. In  
1770 he was elected a representative from  
Boston, and in 1774 a member of the  
Council, but was negatived by Gov. Gage,  
  
&#x27;from tho part he took in politics. From  
1770 and previous, and until 1776, ho was  
constancy engaged, and took a leading part  
in all the measures which were adopted to  
defend tho colonies from the unjust attacks  
of the British Parliament. He was one of  
the earliost that contemplated tho indepen­  
dence of the country, and her separation  
from the mother country. No man in the  
Congress of 1776 did so much as he did  
to procure the declaration of Indepen­  
dence. It is believed that the motion was  
made by a membor from Virginia at his  
suggestion, that he seconded the motion  
and sustained it by the most powerful and  
resistless argument. Bv his influence also,  
Mr Jefferson was placed at the head of the  
committee who framed the declaration.  
His reason for procuring tho motion to  
come from Virginia, and of placing one of  
her delegation at the head of the Commit­  
tee, was to engage the hearty co-operation  
of that great state in the work of indepen­  
dence. By the committee who were ap­  
pointed on the subject of a separation from  
tho mother country, Mr Jcflerson and Mr  
r Adams were appointed a sub-committee to  
frame a Declaration of Independence.  
The draft reported was that of Mr Jeffer­  
son, and he has deservedly received great  
credit for it. But those who consider how  
much easier it is to draft a report than to  
procure its passage ami adoption, and who  
reflect, that Mr JcMun never spoke in  
public, and that John Adams was the bold  
and daring spirit of the Congress of 1776,  
and the eloquent advocate of its boldest  
measures, cannot tail to award him the  
highest honor which the adoption of iiiat  
decimation could confer. From the dec­  
laration ^of independence until the peace,, ,  
Mr Adams was employed in the same glo­  
rious cause.  
Whilst Washington, at the head of our ,  
armies was fighting the battles of Liberty, ■  
and d . fending our country from the rava- PI  
ges of the enemy, Adams was employed ]  
m  
  
In «ttmce less brilliant, bat scarcely less  
important. Through the whole war he  
waa —awing hie talents at the various courts  
of Europe, to obtaip loans and alliances,  
nod every succour to sustain our armies  
and the cause of Liberty and our Indepen­  
dence. Nor did his labors cease until he  
had accomplished every object for which  
ho was sent abroad, nor until he had scal­  
ed oar Independence by a treaty of Peace,  
which he signed, with Great Britain.  
Immediately after the Treaty of Peace,  
he was appointed Ambassador to Great  
Britain on the adoption of the Consti­  
tution he was elected first Vice President  
of the United States, puring the whole  
p&gt;rfbd of••the Presidency of Washington,  
Mr Adams was Vige President. He was.­  
as uniformly consulted by Washington as  
though he had been a member of his cabi­  
net; on all important questions. On the  
death of Washington, Mr Adams was elec­  
ted his successor.  
During the administration of Mr Adams,  
party spirit raged without restraint. Too  
independent himself to wear the trammels  
of either party, he was &#x27;warmly supported  
by neither. Too open for concealment,  
and perfectly v.eid of guile and intrigue, ho  
practiced no arts to secure himself in pow­  
er. At the expiration of the first term,  
Mr. Jefferson, the candidate of the Repub­  
lican party, and his successful competitor,  
receivedt.^r votes more than Mr Adams. «  
Mr Adihis then retired to private life at his  
seat in Quincy.  
  
When the foreign aspect of our country  
became cloudedpaud difficulties overshad­  
owed it, he came forth the warmest advo­  
cate of the rights of the country, and of  
those measures of the administration cal­  
culated to sustain them. His letter in de­  
fence of our seamen against foreign im­  
pressment, is one of the ablest and most  
irresistible arguments in the English lan­  
guage. So satisfied were those who had  
been politically opposed to him, of his mer­  
its and services, that he was selected by  
tho republicans of Massachusetts, as their  
candidate for Governor, on tho death of  
Gov. Sullivan—but he declined again en­  
tering into public life. Ho was one of the  
Electors, and President of the Electoral  
| College, when Mr. Monroe was elected  
President of the United States. Having  
been tho principal draftsman of the &#x27;Con­  
stitution of jh is state, when the Conven­  
tion was called to amend it in 1820, he was  
unanimously elected their President. On  
his declining this honor, unanimous reso­  
lutions were passed bv this great assembly  
of five hundred, selected from all parties,  
expressive of their exalted sense of his  
merits and public services.  
The private character of President Ad- ,,  
ams was perfectly pure, and unsullied and  
unstained. There was no Christian or  
moral duty which he did not fulfil; tho  
kindest of husbands and the bcqtfmf fath­  
ers. To tho excellent precepts and edu­  
cation which he gave his children, the na­  
tion are undoubtedly indebted for having  
at thjg time at their head his eldest son.  
President Adams was serene and tran­  
quil to the last. Conscious of having per­  
formed his duty, and of a life well spent  
and devoted to his country, the blasts of  
calumny which assailed his declining years .  
never ruffled the serenity of his mind. He  
regarded them as little as the troubled ele­  
ments, for* he knew that like them they  
would soon subside, and that then, every  
thing would be like his own bosom, Peace  
and sunshine. To say that he had weak  
points and foibles, is but to say that he was  
a man. But his defects were those of a  
bold and daring spirit, an open, generous  
and confiding heart. Ho knew no guile  
and fipred none. Having no selfish pur­  
poses to answer, he practiced no arts to of- _  
feet them. At the ago of ninety, gt the  
completion of half a century from the com­  
mencement of that revolution he had been  
so instrumental in effecting, he sunk by  
gradual decay into the arms of death/ Ho  
lived to see his country’s liBfrtics placed  
on a firm and immoveable basis, and the  
light of liberty which she diffused enlight­  
ening the whole earth. On the Jubilee of  
Independence, his declining faculties were  
roused by the rejoicings in the metropolis.  
He inquired the cause of the.salutes, and  
was told it was tho fourth of July. He  
answered ** it was a great and glorious day.”  
II© never spake more. Thus his last words  
and his latest words were like those of his  
whole life, thoughts anIFwords which evin­  
ced a soul replete with love of country and  
interest in her welfare.—Essex Register

his standing in that profession, that at an early age

dence of the country, and her separation from the  
mother country. No man in the Cungtess of 1776  
did so much as he did to procure the declaration of  
Independence. It is believed that the motion was  
made by a member ft om Virginia at his suggestion  
that he seconded the motion and sustained it by most  
poweifuland resistless argument. By his influence  
also, Mr. Jefferson was placed at the head of the  
committee who framed the declaration. His rea­  
a  
son for procuring .he motion to come from Vir  
ginia, and of placing one of her delegation at the  
head of theCommit.ee, was to engage the hearty  
co-operation of that great State in the work of in­  
dependence By the committee who were appoin  
ted on the subject of a separation from the mother  
country, Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams were ap­  
pointed a sub committee to frame a Declaration of  
independence. The draft reported, was that of Mr.  
Jefferson, and he has deservedly received great 1  
credit for it. But those who consider how much !  
easier it is to draft a report than to procure its pas­  
sage and adoption, and who reflect, that Mr. Jeffer  
son never spoke in public, and that John Adams was  
the bold and dating spirit of the Congress of 1776  
and the eloquent advocate of its boldest measures,  
cannot iail to award him the highest honor which  
the adoption of that declaration could confer. Front  
the declaration of Independence until *the peace,  
Mr. Adams was employed in the same glorious j  
cause Whilst Washington, at the head of our ;  
armies was fighting the battles of Liberty, and de­  
fending our country from the ravages of the enemy,  
Adams was employed in a service less brilliant, but  
scarcely less impôt tant. Through the whole war,  
he was exerting his talents at the various courts ol |  
Europe, to obtain loans and alliances, and every!  
succor to sustain our armies and the cause of Liber ;  
ty and our Independence. Nor did his labors cease j  
until he had accomplished every object for which he j  
was sent abroad, nor until lie bad sealed our Inde- 1  
pendence by a 1 reaty ot Peace, which he signed, I  
with Great Britain. i  
Immediately after the Treaty of Peace, he was  
appointed Ambassador to Great Britain;—on the  
adoption of the Constitution he was elected first  
Vice President of the United Slates. During the  
hole period of the Presidency of Washington, Mr.  
Adums was Vice President. He was as uniformly  
consulted by Washington as though he had been a  
member of his cabinet, on all important questions.  
On the death of Washington, Mr. Adams was elec­  
ted his successor.  
During the administration of Mr. Adams, party  
spirit raged without restraint. Too independent  
himself to wear the trammehof either patty, he  
&#x27;  
was  
  
warmly supported by neither. Tou unir. i t ,  
cealment, slid perfectly *oi,t of nuil^ anu iniri ( . u 7  
he practised no arts to secure himself in power «  
I lie expiration of the first term, Mr. Jefferson  
candidate of the Republican party, and hit suciuj  
ful competitor, received four voles more than M r  
Adams. Mr. Adams then retired to private lilt  
his seal in Quincy.  
When the foreign aspect of our country became  
clouded, and difficulties overshadowed it, be  
forth the warmest advocate of the rights ot the  
It  
came  
coun­  
try, and of those measures of the administration  
calculated to sustain them. Ills letter in deft nee ot  
our teamen against foreign impressment, is cneof  
the ablest and most it resistible argumenta in  
English language. So satisfied were those who had  
been politically opposed to him, ol his merits and  
services, that he was selected by the republicans oi  
Massachusetts, as their candidate for Governor, c . n  
the death of Gov. .Sullivan—but he declined ag a i,,  
entering into public life. He was one of the El et ,  
tors, and President of the Electoral College, when  
Mr Monroe was elected President of the U. Slates.  
Having been the principal draftsman ot the Consti­  
tution of this state, when the Convention was tailed  
to amend it in 1820, he was unanimously elected  
their President. On his declining this honor, unam.  
mous resolutions wete passed by this gieat assembly  
of five hundred, selected from all patties, expressive  
of their exalted sense of his tnetit9 and putlit

President Adams was serene and tranquil to the  
last. Conscious of having performed his duty, aid

DEATH OF JOHN ADA MS.  
Du Fuesday last closed tlic halt&quot; century since the  
patriots and sages of this country proclaimed its inde­  
pendence, and with if3 parting rays the spirit of the el  
dor ADA MS ascended to heaveii. That bold and en­  
ergetic spirit which inspired the councils of America  
With &#x27;he dctcimiu.ition to become independent lias as­  
cended on high, and that eloquent longue which urged  
its declaration on the Itli of July, 1776, on the 4th of  
J&#x27;d&#x27; . 1H.6, was palsied in death. Tims has terminated,  
soul gloriously tm minuted, the virtuous and patriotic life  
of JOHN A DA.MS—blessed hv his country, honored  
by the woi Id. and immortal as history. Amidst the bo­  
s.iai nt hi* family, the patriarch ot the revolution has  
closed his mortal caiccr, viewing, as a patriarch of old,  
before his closing eyes, the expanding glories of his  
country, the fruits of his exeitions, arid the blessings  
purchased by him for posterity. The ideas which oc­  
cupy our uiinds in coiucmplatiug his character and the  
period allotted by heaven for gathering him to his fa­  
thers, fill our lie-arts with such feelings as disable us  
from searching in ho »ks for the record of the many ine  
durable incidents of his life, and we can only present  
such facts as arc present to our memory. His virtues  
and services will employ the most eloquent tongues in  
i.ie nation, and his history be written by its ablest histo­  
rian. Ills 11to and history are the history of liberty  
and die rights of man, triumphing over oppitission, and  
t ninding a lasting empire on the broad foundation of  
tiie people’s will, and tim happiness of the governed.  
President Adams was educated at (.’ambridge, and to  
the profession of the law. .So eminent was his stand­  
ing m that profession, that at an early age he was ap­  
pointed Chief Justice of the Slate, hut lie declined tins  
cilice. Amid the force of excitement produced by the  
Huston massacre, he dared to midettalce the defence of  
il.c Hritish troops. His success m this trial was com­  
I loti;: It evinced his talents and his strong .sense of jus­  
tice ate! oiheial du’ v. A less intiej id -q nit would not  
i .ive dared to stem the current of popular indignation  
by engaging m such a cause. lint it is ur t in his pro­  
tessioual 11 to. hut hi- political, that we are to trace his  
t&#x27;lorious career. lie soon sacrificed his profession and  
every thing t&lt;&gt; 1 be liberties ot hist dlow citizens an.] the

great credit tor it. But those who consider how much  
easier it is to (halt a report than to procure its passage  
and adoption an 1 who retied, that Air. Jefferson never  
moke III public, and that John Adams was the bold and  
du mg spin! of the Congress of 1770, and the eloquent  
a Ivor* ite rd its boldest minis.ues, cannot fail to award  
lorn the highest honor which the adoption of that decla­  
l item could confer. I’rom the declaration of indepen­  
dence until the peace, Mr Adams was ctnploved in the  
Mine glorious cause. Whilst Washington, at the head  
of our armies was fighting the battles of Liberty, and  
defending nur country from the ravages nf the eneinv,  
A lams was employed in a ser vice less brilliant, but  
scarcely less important. Through the whole war, he

, On l&#x27;nes&lt;iay la«t closed the hail&#x27;cen­  
tury since the patriots and sages of tilts  
country proclaimed its independence,  
and with its parting rays the spirit of the  
elder ADAMS ascended to Heaven.  
That hold and energetic spirit which in­  
spired the councils of America with the  
determination to become independent  
basg^.&#x27;Cended &#x27;on high, and that elo­  
quent tongue which urged its declaration  
on the fourth of July, 1776, on the  
fourth of July, hd-26, was palsied in  
death. Thus has terminated, and glo­  
riously terminated, the virtuous and pa­  
triotic life of JOHN ADAMS—blessed  
by his country, honored by the world,  
and immortal as history. Amidst the  
bosom of his family, the patriarch of the  
revolution has closed his immortal ca­  
reer, viewing as the patriarch of old,  
before his closing eyes, the expanding  
glories of his country, the fruits of His  
exertions, and the blessings purchased  
by him for posterity. The ideas which  
occupy our minds in contemplating his  
character and the peiiod allotted by  
heaven for gathering him to his fathers,  
fill our hearts with such teelings as dis­  
ables us from searching in books for the  
recoid of the many memorable incidents  
  
■»f his life, sail we can only present such  
facts as tfre present to our memory.  
His virtues and services will employ the  
most eloquent tongues in the nation, and  
iis history be written bv its ablest histo­  
rian. 11 is life and history are the. histo­  
ry of liberty and the rights of man, tri­  
umphing over oppression, and founding  
a lasting empire on the broad foundation  
of the people’s will, and the happiness  
of the governed.  
President Adams was educated at  
Cambridge, and to the profession of the  
law. So eminent was his standing in  
that profession, that at an early age he  
was appointed Chief Justice of the State,  
hut he declined this office. Amid the  
force &lt;*f excitement produced by the  
Boston massacre, he dared to under­  
take the defence of the British troops.  
His success in this trial was complete.  
It evinced his talents and his strong  
sense of justice and official duty. A less  
  
intripid spirit would not have dared to  
stem the current of popular indignation  
by engaging in such a cause. But it is  
not in his professional life, byt his poli­  
tical, that%qa. are to tried his glorious  
carter. H&lt;Wp&gt; n sacrificed his profes­  
sion andeverv thing to the liberties of  
his fellow citizens and .he independence  
of his country. In 1770, he was elec­  
ted a representative from Boston, and  
in 1774, a member of the Council, but  
was negatived by Cor. Cage, from the  
part he took in politics. From 1770  
and previous, and until I77ti, he was  
constantly engaged, and took a leading  
part in ail the. measures which were a­  
lopted to defend the colonies from  
he unjust attacks of the British Par­  
liament. He was one of the earliest  
[hat contemplated the independence of  
[lie country, and her separation from  
he rnothe.r country. No man in the  
Congress of 177*&#x27;. did so much as he did  
o procure the Declaration of Indepen­  
fence.  
It is believed that the motion was  
nade by a member from Virginia at his  
luggestion, that he secouiled the motion  
uid sustained it by most powerful and  
esistless argument. By his influence  
ilso, Mr. Jefferson was placed at the  
read of the Committee who framer! tin  
ieclaratron. His reason for procuring  
he motion fo come from Virginia, and  
&gt;f placing one of her delegation at the  
read of the Committee, w as to engage  
he hearty co-operation of that great  
itate in the work of independence. By  
he Committee who were appointed on  
lie subject of a separation from the mo­  
lrer country, Mr. Jefferson and Mr.  
Vdams were appointed a sub-committee  
o frame a Declaration of Independence.  
Hie dealt reported, was that of Mr.&#x27;  
Fetfersou, and he ha« deservedly recei- ,  
red great credit- for it. But those who!  
  
:onsidei how much easier it is to draft  
i report than to procure its passage and  
idoption, and who reflect, that Mi Jef­  
eison never spoke in public, and that  
John Adams was the hold and daring  
‘pirit of the Congress of 1776, and the  
Moquent advocate of its boldest mea­  
sures, cannot fail to award him the high­  
est honour which the adoption of that  
Declaration could confer. From the  
Declaration of Independence until the  
ieace, Mr Adams was employed in the  
arne glorious cause. Whilst VVa?hing­  
on, ai the head of our armies, w as fight­  
ng the battles of Liberty, and defending  
&gt;ur country from the ravages of the en  
uny, Adams was employed in a service  
ess brilliant, but scarcely less impor­  
aDt. Through the whole war, he was  
ixerting his talents at the various courts  
&gt;f Europe, to obtain loans and alliances,  
md every succour to sustain our ar­  
nies and the cause of Liberty and our  
Independence- Nor did his labours  
mtil he had accomplished every object  
or which he was sent abroad, nor until  
ie had sealed our Independence by a  
I&#x27;reaty ol Peace, which be signed, with  
Great Britain.  
Immediately after theTreaty of Peace  
he was appointed Ambassador to Great  
Britain;—on 1 lye adoption of the Con­  
stitution, he was elected first Vice-Pre­  
sident of the United States. During the  
whole period ol the Presidency of Wash­  
ington, Mr. Adams was Vice-President.  
He was uniformly consulted by Wash­  
ington as though he had been a member  
of hi* cabinet,on all important questions.  
— On the death of Washington, Mr.  
Adams was elected his successor.  
During the administration of Mr.  
Adams, party spirit raged without res­

wear the trammels of either party, lie  
was warmly supported by neither. Too  
open lor concealment, and perfectly  
void of guile and intrigue, lie prac­  
tised no arts to secure himself in pow­  
er. At the expiration of his first term,  
Mr. Jefferson, the candidate of the Re­  
publican party, and his successful com­  
petitor, received four votes more than  
Mr. Adams. Mr. Adains then retired  
to private life at his seat in Quincy.  
u hen the foreign aspect of our coun­  
try became clouded, and difficulties  
overshadowed it, he came forth the  
warmest advocate of the rights of the  
country, and of those measures of the  
administration calculated to sustain  
them, ilii letter in defence of our sea­  
men again t foreign impressment, is o«e  
of the ablest and most irresistible argu­  
ments in tbe English language. So sa­  
tisfied were those who had been politi­  
cally opposed to him, of his merits and  
.eivices, that he was selected by the  
Republicans ut Massachusetts, as their  
  
candidate for Governor, oq the death of  
Governor Sullivan—but be declined  
again entering into public life. He was  
oue of the Electors, and President of  
the Electoral College, when Mr. Monroe  
was eleet»d President of the United  
States. Haring been the principal  
draftsman of tlie Constitution of this  
State, when the Convention was called  
to amend it in 1820, be was unani­  
mously elected their President. On his  
declining this honor, unanimous reso­  
lutions were passed by this great assem­  
bly of five hundred, selected from all  
parties, expressive of their exalted  
sense of his merits and public service.  
The private‘character of President  
Adams was perfectly pure, unsullied  
and unstained. There was no Christian  
or moral duty which he did not fulfil;  
the kindest of husbands and the best of  
fathers. To the excellent precepts and  
education which he gave his children,  
the nation are undoubtedly indebted for  
having at this time at their head his eld­  
  
est son.  
President Adams was serene and!  
tranquil to the last. Conscious of having j  
performed his duty, and a life well -pent  
and devoted t&lt;» his country, the blasts of  
calumny which assailed his declining  
years never ruffled ihl serenity of his  
mind, lie regarded them as little as  
the troubled elements, tor he knew that  
dike (hem they would soon subside, ami  
that then, every thing would be, like his  
own bosom, peace and sunsnine. To  
»av that he had weak points and toihles,  
is but to say that he was a man. lfut  
his defects were those of a bold and da  
ring spirit, an open, generous and con­  
fiding heart. lie knew no guile, and  
he leared none. Having no selfish pur­

effect them. At the r«ge of ninety, at  
the completion of half a century from

had beeh so instrumental in effecting

of death. He lived to see his country’s  
liberties placed on a firm and immnva­

she diffused enlightening the whole earth.  
On the Jubilee of Independence, his  
declining faculties were roused by the  
rejoicing jn (ho metropolis. He inquired  
♦ he cause of the salutes; and was told it  
vvasthe the fourth of July. He answer­  
ed, “It is a great and glorious iiat.”  
He never spake more. Thus his last  
thoughts and his latest words were like  
those of his whole life, thoughts and

that at an early age he wa- appointed € hiet

During the administration of Mr. Adams,  
party spirit raged without restraint. Too in-  
dependent himself to wear the trammels of ei-  
ther party, he was warmly supported by nei-  
ther. Too open for concealment. and perfect  
ly void of guilt and intrigue, he practiced no  
arts to secure himself in power. At the ex-  
piration of the first term, Mr. Jefferson, the  
candidate of the Republican party, and his suc  
cessful competitor, received four votes more  
than Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams then retired to  
private life, at his seat in Quincy.  
  
When the foreign aspect of our country be-  
came clouded, and difficulties overshadowed  
it, he came forward the warmest advocate for  
the rights of the country, and of those meas-  
ure of the administration calculated to sustain  
them. His letter in defence of our seamen  
against foreign impressment, is one of the  
ablest and most irresistible arguments in the  
English language. So satisfied were those  
who had been politically opposed to him, of  
his merits and services, that he was selected  
by the Republicans of Massachusetts, ss their  
candidate for Governor, on the death of Gov.  
Sullivan—bnt he decli ed again entering into  
  
ublic life. He was one of the Electors, and  
President of the Electoral College, when Mr.  
Monroe was elected President of the United  
States. Having been the principal draftsman  
of the Constitution of this State, when the Con-  
vention was called to amend it in 1820, he was  
unanimously elected their President. On his  
declining this honor, unanimous resolations  
were passed by this great assembiy of five  
hundred, selected from all parties, expressive  
of their exalted sense of his merits and public

From the Essex (Mass?) Register. !  
i-. DEATH OF JOHN ADAMS.  
On Tuesday last, closed the half century  
since the patriots and sages of this country  
proclaimed its independence, and with its  
parting rays the spirit of the elder Adams  
ascended to heaven. That bold and ener­  
getic spirit Avhich inspired the councils of  
America with the determination to become  
independenthas ascended on high, and that  
eloquent tongue which urged its declaration  
on the fourth of July, 1776, on the fourth of  
July, 18204 was palsied in death. &#x27;Thus has  
terminated, and gloriously terminated, the  
virtuous and patriotic life of John Adams ;  
blessed by his country, honoured by the  
world, and&#x27; immortal as history. Amidst  
the bosom of his family, the patriarch of the  
revolution has closed his mortal career,  
viewing, &quot; as a patriarch of old, before his  
closing eyes, the expanding glories of his  
country, the fruita of hrs exertions, and the  
blessings I purchased by him for posterity.  
The ideas; which occupy our minds in con­  
templating his character, -and the period al­  
lotted by heaven for gathering him to his  
fathers j fill our hearts with such feelings as  
disable us from searching in books for the  
  
record ot many memorable incidents of his  
life, and we can only present such facts as  
are present to our memory. His virtues and  
services Will employ the most eloquent  
tongues in the nation, and his history be  
written by its ablest historian.. His life and  
history are the history of liberty aud the  
rights of man, triumphing ever oppression,  
andfeundinga lasting empire on the broad  
foundation of the people&#x27;s will, and the hap­  
piness of the governed.  
  
President Adams was educated at Cam  
  
bridge, arid to the profession of the law.  
  
So eminent was his standing in that profes-J

negatived by CjiOV4 (jage, trom the part  
  
he took in politics. From 1770 and previous,  
and until 1776, he was constantly engaged,  
and took a leading part in all the measures  
which were adopted ro defend the colonies  
  
from the unjust attacks ol the British Par  
  
lament. 1 He was one ot the earliest that  
  
contemplated the independence ofthecoun-  
  
ry, and; her separation irom tne motner  
  
country. IN o man in tne congress oi i7o  
did so much as he did to procure the decla  
  
ration ofjlndependence. It is believed that  
  
the motion was made hy a member lrom  
  
Virginia1 at his suggestion, that he seconded  
  
the motion ana sustainca it oy mostpower--ful  
and resistless argument. By his influ-j  
  
ence aKo, Mr. JefTerSon was placed at the  
  
head of the committee who iramed the &#x27;de-i  
  
claration. His reason for procuring the mo  
  
tion to come from&#x27; v lrginia, and ot placing  
  
one of her cklegation at the head ot the Com  
mittee, was to engage the hearty co-opera  
tion of that great State in the work of inde  
  
nendence. By the committee who were an  
  
r ... - . . r. : i f J  
  
pointed on the subject ot a separation irom  
the mother country, Mr. Jefferson and MrJ  
  
Adams were appointed a sub-committee to  
  
frame a Declaration of Independence. The  
  
draft reported, was that of Mr. Jefferson j  
  
and he has deservedly received great credit  
  
for it. But those who consider how, much  
  
easier it ! is to draft a report than to procure  
  
its nassaare and adoption, and who reitect,  
  
that Mr. Jefferson never spoke in public,  
  
and that John Adams was the bold and dar  
  
ing spirit of the Congress of 1776, and the  
eloquent advocate of its boldest measures,  
  
cannot fail to award him the highest honor  
  
which the adoption of that declaration could  
  
confer, j From the declaration ot lndepen  
dence until the peace, Mr. Adams was em  
  
nlnwp A in thp nmp o-lnrious cause.  
Whilst  
  
Washington, at the head of our armies, was  
fio-htino- the battles of Liberty,; and defend  
  
ing our country from the ravages of the en­  
emy, Adams was employed in a service less  
  
brilliant, but scarcely less important.-  
  
Through the whole war, he was exerting nis  
toiontc oi- fhp various courts of Europe, to  
  
nhtain loans 1 and alliances, and every sucf-  
  
cor to sustain our armies nd the cause of  
  
Libertv and our Independence. M or did  
  
hU lahors cease until he had accomplished  
  
every object for which he was sent abroad,  
nor until he had sealed our Independence  
by a Treaty of Peace, which he signed, with  
  
Great liritain. ,  
. Tmmediatelv! after the Treaty of Peace,  
  
he was appointed Ambassador to Great  
Rntain: on the adoption of the Consiitu-  
  
tion hej was elected first Vice President of  
  
the United States. During the whole pe­  
riod, of the Presidency of Washington, Mr.  
  
Am was Vice President. He was as  
  
uniformly consulted by Washington as  
  
though he had been a member of his cabi­  
net, on all important questions. On the  
retirement of Washington, Mr. Adams wis  
  
elected his. successor.  
  
During the administration of Mr. Adam&#x27;s,  
  
party spirit raged without restraint. Too  
independent himself to wear the trammels i  
of either-party, he was warmly supnofted bV !  
  
neither. Too open for concealment &quot;and :  
  
perfectly void of guile and intrigue, he  
practised no arts to secure himself in power.  
At the expiration of the first term, Mri Jef-  
  
erson, the candidate of the Republican ,  
  
party, and his successful competitor, receiv-  
  
ed four votes more than Mr. Adams. Mr.  
  
Adams then retired to &quot;private life at his  
  
seat in Quincy.  
  
When the foreign aspect of our country  
  
became clouded, and difficulties overshad­  
owed it, he came forth, the warmest advo  
  
cate of the rights of the country, and ot  
hose measures of the administration calcu- :  
fated to sustain them. His letter in defence  
of our seamen against foreign imDressrhent.  
  
one of the ablest and most irresistible ar  
  
guments in the English language. So sa  
  
tisfied were those who had been politically  
opposed to him, of his merits and services.  
  
hat he was selected by the republicans of  
  
Massachusetts, as their candidate for Gov  
  
ernor, on the death of Gov. Sullivan but  
  
he declined again entering into-public life.  
He was one of the electors, and President  
  
of the Electoral College, when Mr. Monroe,  
  
was elected President of the United States. V  
Having been the principal draftsman of the  
Constitution of this State, when the Con­  
vention was called to amend it in 1820 her  
was unanimously elected their President.  
On his declining this honor, unanimous re­  
solutions were passed&#x27; by this great assem-  
bly of five hundred, selected from all par­  
ties, expressive of their exalted sense of his .  
merits and public&quot; services.  
The private character of President Ad-:  
ams was perfectly pure, unsullied, and un­  
stained. . There was no Christian or moral .  
duty which he did not fulfil; the kindest of  
husbands and the best of fathers. To the  
excellent precepts and education which he M  
gave his children, the nation are undoubt-V  
edly indebted for having at this time at  
their head his eldest son.  
President Adams&#x27; was serene and tranquil  
  
.to the last. Conscious of having perform-  
  
ed nis auty, and oi a uie well spent and de­  
voted to his country, the blasts, of calumny  
which -&#x27;. assailed his . declining years never  
ruffled the serenity of his mind. He re­  
garded them as little as the troubledle-J  
ments, for he knew that like them they  
would sooti subside, and that then, every  
thing would be like his own bosom, peace  
and .sunshine. To say that &quot;he had weak  
points and foibles, is but to say that he was  
u fnaniBiit-his delects fwere thce &#x27;&#x27;cf ,  
bold&#x27; and daring&#x27;spirlt an dpen generous;  
and confidjng heart. He knew no guile and  
he feared none. Having no selfish purposes  
to answer he practised no arts to effect  
them. At the age of ninety, at the comple­  
tion of a half century from the commence-  
  
ment oi tnai revolution ne nao Deen so in­  
strumental in effecting, he sunk by gradual  
  
decay into the arms of death. He lived to  
  
see his country s liberties placed on a firm  
and immovable basis, and the light of liber-  
  
ty which she dillused enlightening the whole  
  
earth. 0n the Jubilee of Independence, his  
declining faculties were roused by the re-  
  
oicings in the metropolis. He inquired  
  
the cause of the salutes, and was. told it was  
the fourth of July. He answered,&#x27; it is a  
great and. glorious day.&quot; He never) spake  
  
more, i-nus nis last tnougnts and his lat  
  
est words Were like those of his whble&#x27;-Jifev&#x27;  
  
noughts and words which evinced &#x27;a souL-  
  
replete with love of country and interest in,  
  
ler

and they lived long enough to behold the practical results of  
the political labours of their earlier days.  
  
Mr. Adams was educated at Cambridge, and to the pro-  
fession of the law. So eminent was his standing in that pro-  
fession, that at an early age he was appointed chief justice of  
the state, but he declined this office. Amid the force of ex-  
citement produced by the Boston massacre, he dared to un-  
dertake the defence of the British troops. His success in this  
trial was complete. It evinced his talents and his strong sense  
of justice and official duty. A less intrepid spirit would not  
have ventured to stem the current of popular indignation, by  
engaging in such acause. He soon sacrificed his profession  
and every thing to the liberties of his fellow citizens and the  
independence of his native country. In 1770 he was elected  
a representative from Boston, and in 1774 a member of the  
council, but was negatived by governor Gage, from the pare  
he took i in politics. From 1770, and previous, and until 1776  
he was constantly engaged, and took a leading part in all the  
measures which were adopted to defend the colonies from the  
unjust attacks of the British parliament. He was one of the

earliest that contemplated the independence of the country,  
and her separation from the mother country. No man in the  
congress of 1776 did more to procure the declaration of inde-  
pendence. By the committee, who were appointed on the  
subject of a separation from the mother country, Mr. Jefferson  
and Mr. Adams were appointed a sub-committee to frame a  
declaration of independence. The draft reported was that of  
Mr. Jefferson, and he has deservedly received great credit for  
it. But Mr. Jefferson never spoke in public, and John Adams  
was the bold and daring spirit of the congress of 1776, arid  
the eloquent advocate of its boldest measures.  
  
From the declaration of independence until the peace,  
Mr. Adams was employed in the same glorious cause. While  
Washington, at the head of our armies, was fighting the bat-  
tles of liberty, and defending our country from the ravages  
of the enemy, Adams was employed ina service less brilliant,  
but scarcely less important. Through the whole war he was  
exerting his talents at the various courts of Europe, to obtain  
loans and alliances, and every succour to sustain our armies  
and the cause of liberty and our independence. Nor did his  
labours cease until he had accomplished every object for  
which he was sent abroad, and he had sealed our indepen-  
dence by a treaty of peace, which he signed, with Great  
Britain.  
  
Immediately after the treaty of peace, he was appointed  
ambassador to Great Britain, On the adoption of the con-  
stitution he was elected first vice president of the United  
States. During the whole period of the presidency of Wash-  
ington Mr. Adams was vice president. He was as uniformly  
consulted by Washington as though he had been a member  
of his cabinet, on all important questions. On the death of  
Washington Mr. Adams was elected his successor.  
  
At the expiration of the first term, Mr. Jefferson, the can-  
didate of the republican party and his successful competitor,  
received four votes more than Mr. Adams, who then retired  
to private life, at his seat in Quincy.  
  
He was subsequently selected by the republicans of Mas-  
sachusetts, as their candidate for governor, on the death of  
governcr Sullivan, but he declined entering again into public  
lifee He was one of the electors and president of the elec-  
toral college, when Mr. Monroe was elected president of the  
United States. Having been the principal draftsman of the  
constitution of Massachusetts, when the convention was  
called to amend it, in 1820, he was unanimously elected  
their president. On his declining this honour, unanimous

till 1776 he was constantly engaged in  
all the measures which were adopted in  
defiance of the English Parliament. In  
1774, when the colonies determined to  
hold a congress at Philadelphia, he was  
elected, with Mr. Samuel Adams, Mr.  
Cushing, and Mr. Treat Paine, to re-  
present the province of Massachusetts  
Bay. He was also one of the represen-  
tatives of this province in the second  
congress. In the memorable discussions  
of 1776, Mr. Adams and Mr. Dickeason  
took distinguished parts; the former for,  
the latter against, the declaration of in-  
dependence. The original motion, bya  
member from Virginia, is said to have  
been made at his suggestion: he se-  
conded it, and supported it by such  
powerful arguments, as greatly coutri-  
buted to its success. By the committee  
who were appointed on the subject of a  
separatiun from the Mother Country, Mr.  
Jefferson and Mr. Adams, the former it is

latter, were appointed a sub-committee

Justice of the State, but he declined  
this office. Amid the force of excite-  
ment produced by the Boston mas-  
sacre, he dared to undertake the de-  
fence of the British troops. His suc-  
cess in this trial was coinplete. It  
evinced his talents and his strong  
sense of justice and official duty. A  
less intrepid spirit would not have dared  
to stem the current of popular indig-  
nation by engaging in such a cause.  
But it is not in his professional life,  
but his political, that we are to trace  
his glorious career. He soon sacri-  
ficed his profession and every thing to  
the liberties of his fellow-citizens and  
the independence of his country. In  
1770, he was elected a representative  
from Boston, and in 1774, a member  
of the Councii, but was negatived by  
Governor Gage from the part he took  
in politics. From 1770, and previous,  
and until 1776, he was constantly  
engaged, and took a leading part in  
ull the measures which were adopted  
to defend the colonies from the unjust  
attacks of the British Parliament.  
He was one of the earliest that con-  
templated the independence of the  
country, and her separation from the  
mother country. No man in the  
Congress of 1776 did so much as he  
did to procure the declaration of inde-  
pendence. By the committee who  
were appointed on the subject of a  
separation from the mother country,  
Mr. Jetierson and Mr. Adams were  
appointed a sub-committee to frame  
a declaration of independence. ‘The  
draught reported was that of Mr.  
Jefferson, and he has deservedly re-  
ceived great credit for it. But Mr.  
Jefferson never spoke in public, and  
John Adams was the bold and daring  
spirit of Congress of 1776, and the  
eloquent advocate of its boldest mea-  
sures,  
  
From the declaration of indepen-  
dence until the peace, Mr. Adams was  
employed in the same glorious cause.  
Whilst Washington, at the head of  
Our armies, was fighting the battles  
of liberty, and defending our country  
from the ravages of the enemy, Adams  
was employed in a service less bril-  
liant, but scarcely less important.  
Through the whole war he was ex-  
erting his talents at the various courts  
of Europe, to obtain loans and alli-  
ances, and every succour to sustain  
Our armies, and the cause of liberty  
  
  
  
and our independence. Nor did his  
labours cease until he had accom-  
plished every object for which he was  
sent abroad, nor until he had sealed  
our independence by a treaty of peace,  
which he signed with Great Britain.  
  
Immediately after the treaty of  
peace, he was appointed Ambassador  
to Great Britain ; on the adoption of  
the Constitution, he was elected first  
Vice-President of the United States.  
During the whole period of the presi-  
dency of Washingtoa, Mr. Adams was  
Vice-President. He was as uniformly  
consulted by Washington as though  
he had been a member of his cabinet,  
on all important questions. On the  
death of Washington, Mr. Adams was  
elected his successor.  
  
During the adininistration of Mr.  
Adams, party spirit raged without re-  
straint. ‘Too independent himself to  
wear the traumels of either party, he  
was warmly supported by neither.  
Too opeu for concealment, and per-  
fectly void of guile and intrigue, he  
practised no arts to secure himself in  
power. At the expiration of the first  
term, Mr. Jefferson, the candidate of  
the Republican party, and his success-  
ful competitor, received four votes  
more than Mr, Adams. Mr. Adams  
then retired to private life at his seat  
in Quincy.  
  
When the foreign aspect of our  
country became clouded, and difficul-  
ties overshadowed it, he came forth  
the warmest advocate of the rights of  
the country, and of those measures of  
the administration calculated to sus-  
tuin them. Lis letter in defence of  
our seamen against foreign impress-  
ment, is one of the ablest and most  
irresistible arguinents in the English  
language. So satisfied were those  
who had been politically opposed to  
him, of his merits and services, that  
he was selected by the Republicans of  
Massachusetts as their candidate for  
Governor, on the death of Governor  
Sullivan ; but he declined again en-  
tering into public life. He was one  
of the electors, and President of the  
Electoral College, when Mr. Monroe  
was elected President of the United  
States. Having been the principal  
draughtsman of the constitution of  
this state, when the Convention was  
called to amend it in 1820, he was  
unanimously elected their President.  
On his declining this honour, unani-

mous resoluftons were passed by this  
great assembly of 500, selected from  
all parties, expressive of their exalted  
sense of his merits and public ser-  
vices.  
  
The private character of President  
Adams was perfectly pure, unsullied  
and unstained. There was no Chris-  
tian or moral duty which he did not  
fulfil—the kindest of husbands, and  
the best of fathers.
