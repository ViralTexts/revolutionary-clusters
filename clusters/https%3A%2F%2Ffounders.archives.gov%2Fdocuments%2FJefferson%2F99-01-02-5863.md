July 2, 1807   
  
By Thomas Jefferson President of the U.S of America.  
A Proclamation.  
During the wars which, for some time, have unhappily prevailed among the powers of Europe, the United States  
of America, firm in their principles of peace have endeavored by justice, by a regular discharge of all their National  
&amp; Social duties, &amp; by every friendly office their situation has admitted, to maintain with all the  
belligerents: their Accustomed relations of friendship, hospitality, &amp; commercial intercourse, taking no part in  
the questions which animate these powers against each other, nor permitting themselves to entertain a wish but for the  
restoration of general peace, they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed, &amp; they believe that  
no instance of a departure from it’s duties can be justly imputed to them by any Nation. A free use of their Harbours  
&amp; waters, the means of refitting &amp; of refreshment, of succour to their sick &amp; suffering, have, at  
all times, and on equal principles, been extended to all, &amp; this too, amidst a Constant recurrence of Acts of  
insubordination to the laws, of violence to the persons, &amp; of trespasses on the property of our Citizens,  
committed by Officers of one of the belligerent parties recieved among us. in truth these abuses of the laws of  
hospitality have with few exceptions, become habitual to the commanders of the British armed Vessels hovering on our  
Coasts, &amp; frequenting our harbours. they have been the subject of repeated representations to their governments  
assurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them, within the limit of the rights and of the respect due  
to a friendly nation: but, those orders &amp; assurances have been without effect; no instance of punishment for past  
wrongs has taken place. at length a deed transcending all we have hitherto seen or suffered, brings the public  
sensibility to a serious Crisis &amp; our forbearance to a necessary pause. A Frigate of the U.S. trusting to a state  
of peace and leaving her Harbour on a distant service, has been surprised and attacked by a British Vessel of superior  
force, one of a squadron then lying in our waters &amp; covering the transaction, &amp; has been disabled from  
service, with the loss of a number of men Killed &amp; wounded. This enormity was not only without provocation or  
justifiable cause, but was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force, from a ship of war of the United States a  
part of her crew. and that no circumstance might be wanting to mark it’s character, it had been previously ascertained  
that the seamen demanded were native Citizens of the U.S. having effected her purpose she returned to anchor with her  
squadron within our jurisdiction Hospitality under such circumstances ceases to be a duty: and a continuance of it, with  
such uncontroled abuses, would tend only, by multiplying injuries &amp; irritations, to bring on a rupture between the  
two Nations: this extreme resort is equally opposed to the interests of both, as it is to Assurances of the most friendly  
dispositions on the part of the British Government, in the midst of which this outrage has been committed. in this light  
the subject cannot but present itself to that Government, &amp; strengthen the Motives to an honorable reparation of  
the wrong which has been done, &amp; to that effectual Controul of it’s Naval Commanders, which alone can justify the  
Government of the U.S. in the exercise of those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.  
In consideration of these circumstances and of the right of every Nation to regulate it’s own police, to  
provide for it’s peace &amp; for the safety of it’s Citizens, &amp; consequently to refuse the admission of Armed  
Vessels into it’s Harbors or waters, either in such numbers or of such descriptions, as are inconsistent with these, or  
with the maintenance of the Authority of the laws, I have thought proper in pursuance of the authorities specially given  
by law to issue this My Proclamation hereby requiring all armed Vessels bearing commissions under the government of Great  
Britain, now within the Harbours or waters of the U.S. immediately &amp; without any delay to depart from the same,  
&amp; interdicting the entrance of all the said Harbours &amp; waters to the said Armed Vessels, and to all others  
bearing commissions under the Authority of the British Government.  
And if the said Vessels, or any of them shall fail to depart as aforesaid, or if they or any others, so  
interdicted shall hereafter enter the Harbors or waters aforesaid, I do in that Case forbid all intercourse with them or  
any of them, their Officers or crews, and do prohibit all supplies &amp; aid from being furnished to them or any of  
them.  
And I do declare &amp; make Known that if any person from, or within the jurisdictional limits of the  
U.S. shall Afford any Aid to any Such Vessels Contrary to the prohibition contained in this Proclamation, either in  
repairing any such Vessel, or in furnishing her, her Officers or crew, with supplies of Any Kind, or in any manner  
whatsoever, or if any Pilot shall Assist in navigating any of the said Armed Vessels, unless it be for the purpose of  
carrying them in the first instance, beyond the limits &amp; jurisdiction of the U.S. or unless it be in the case of a  
Vessel forced by distress, or charged with public dispatches as hereinafter provided for, such person or persons shall, on  
conviction suffer all the pains &amp; penalties by the laws provided for such Offences.  
And do I hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing Office Civil or Military within or under the Authority  
of the U.S. And all others, Citizens or Inhabitants thereof, or being within the same, with vigilance &amp;  
promptitude to exert their respective Authorities, &amp; to be Aiding &amp; Assisting to the carrying this  
Proclamation &amp; every part thereof into full effect.  
Provided nevertheless that if any Such Vessel shall be forced into the Harbors or waters of the U.S. by  
distress, by the dangers of the Sea, or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them charged with dispatches or  
business from their Government, or shall be a public Packet for the Conveyance of letters &amp; dispatches, the  
Commanding Officer, immediately reporting his Vessel to the Collector of the District, stating the object or causes of  
entering the Said Harbors or waters, and conforming himself to the regulations in that case prescribed under the Authority  
of the laws, shall be allowed the benefit of Such regulations respecting repairs, supplies, Stay intercourse &amp;  
departure as shall be permitted under the same Authority.  
In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents &amp;  
Signed the Same.  
Given at the City of Washington the 2d. day of July in the Year of our Lord 1807. &amp; of the  
Sovereignty &amp; independance of the United States the 31st.

diate remedy to these evils. The conduct he prescribes he is  
careful to represent not as an effort of resentment for past, but  
merely a preventive of future injuries. In consideration, he  
says, of these circumstances, and of the right of every nation  
to regulate its own police, to provide for its peace and for the  
safety of its citizens, and consequently to refuse the admission  
of armed vessels into its harbours or waters, either in such  
numbers or of such kinds as are inconsistent with these, or  
with the maintenance of the authority of the laws, he requires  
all armed vessels bearing British commissions, now within  
the harbours or waters of the United States, to depart imme-  
diately, and interdicts the entrance of the same in future to all  
British armed vessels. If they shall fail to depart, or here-  
after enter in defiance of this interdict, he proceeds to forbid  
all intercourse with them, and prohibits all supplies and aid  
from being furnished to them. He threatens with the legal  
penalties all who should afford any aid to any such vessel,  
either in repairing her, or in furnishing her with supplies of  
any kind, or in any manner whatsoever ; all pilots particularly  
are forbidden to assist in navigating any of these armed ves-  
sels, unless for the purpose of carrying them beyond the limits  
of the United States, or unless it be in the case of a vessel  
forced by distress, or charged with public dispatches.  
  
‘The proclamation concludes with making the necessary ex-  
ceptions as to vessels that shall be forced into the harbours or  
waters of the United States by distress, by the dangers of the  
sea, or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them charged  
with dispatches or business from their government, or shall be  
a public packet for the conveyance of letters and dispatches.  
In these cases the commanding officer, immediately reporting  
his vessel to the collector of the district, stating the object or  
causes of entering the said harbours or waters, and conforming  
himself to the regulations in that case prescribed under the  
authority of the laws, shali be allowed the benefit of such regu-  
lations, respecting repairs, supplies, stay, intercourse and  
Cope as shall be permitted under the same authority.

dictated to the people, but imposes the conduct upon ail i
