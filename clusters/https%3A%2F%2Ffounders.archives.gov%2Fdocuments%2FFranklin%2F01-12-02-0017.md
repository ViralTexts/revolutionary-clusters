. Preamble. Albeit the Dominion and Principality of Wales is and ever hath been united to and under the Imperial Crown of this Realm, whereof his Majesty is very Head, nevertheless because in the Principality divers rights, usages and laws are far discrepant from the Laws and Customs of this Realm, and also because the] People of that Dominion [have a speech not consonant to the natural Mother Tongue] used in this Realm.  
  
[And] some ignorant People made a Dis[tinction between the King’s] Subjects of the Realm and his Subjects of [Wales]  
[His] Highness therefore  
[Of his] Love to his Subjects of the Principality,  
[And to] bring the Subjects of his Realm and those of his [Dominion] to Concord and Unity.  
[By the] Advice of Lords and Commons, and Authority of the same hath enacted, that henceforth  
[The] said Country or Dominion of Wales shall be incorporated with his Realm of England.  
[It] seems clear, that before this Act, Wales was not under[stood as] within the Realm, tho’ subject to the same Prince. [And was] Subject to the Crown, tho’ not to the Parliament.  
[To sub]ject it to Laws made by the Latter it was thought [right?] to give it all the “Freedoms, Liberties, RIGHTS [and Laws], that the King’s Subjects naturally born within this [Realm had] and enjoy’d.”
