Gentlemen,  
United States. 28th July 1795.  
  
In every act of my administration, I have sought the happiness of my fellow-citizens. My system for the attainment of this object has uniformly been, to overlook all personal, local and partial considerations: to contemplate the United States as one great whole: to confide, that sudden impressions, when erroneous, would yield to candid reflection: and to consult only the substantial and permanent interests of our country.  
Nor have I departed from this line of conduct on the occasion which has produced the resolutions contained in your letter of the 13th instant.  
Without a predilection for my own judgment, I have weighed with attention every argument which has at any time been brought into view. But the Constitution is the guide which I never can abandon. It has assigned to the President the power  
  
of making treaties, with the advice and consent of the Senate: It was doubtless supposed that these two branches of government would combine, without passion, and with the best means of information, those facts &amp; principles, upon which the success of our foreign relations will always depend: that they ought not to substitute for their own conviction the opinions of others; or to seek truth thro’ any channel but that of a temperate and well informed investigation.  
Under this persuasion, I have resolved on the manner of executing the duty now before me. To the high responsibility, attached to it, I freely submit; and you, gentlemen, are at liberty to make these sentiments known, as the grounds of my procedure. While I feel the most lively gratitude for the many instances of approbation from my country; I can no otherwise deserve it than by obeying the dictates of my conscience. With due respect I am—Gentlemen Your Obedient

Nor have I departed from this line of conduct on the oc  
caslon which has produced the resolutions contained in your  
letter of the 18th instant. Without a predilection for my  
owa judgment, I have weighed with attention every argus

dent:  
United States, 28th July, 1795.  
Gentlemen—In every act of my adminis­  
tration, I have sought the happiness of my  
fellow-citizens. My system, for the attain­  
ment of this object, has been, to overlook all  
personal, local, and partial considerations;  
to contemplate the United States as one great  
whole; to confide, that sudden impressions,  
when erroneous, would yield to candid reflec­  
tion : and to consult only the permanent and  
substantial interests ot our country. Nor  
have I departed from this line of conduct, on  
the occasion which has produced the resolu­  
tions contained in your letter of the 13th  
inst.  
Without a predilection for my own judg­  
ment, I have weighed, with attention, every  
argument which has at any time been brought  
into view. But the constitution is the guide  
which I never can abandon. It has assigned  
to the President the power of making treaties,  
with the advice and consent of the Senate.  
It was doubtless supposed, that these two  
branches would combine, without passion,  
and with the best means of information, those  
facts and principles on which the success of  
our foreign relations will always depend;  
that they ought not to substitute, for their  
own convictions, the opinions of others; or to  
seek truth through any channel but that of a  
temperate and well-informed investigation.  
Under this persuasion I have resolved on  
  
the manner of executing the duty before me.  
To the high responsibility attached to it, I  
freely submit; and you, gentlemen, are at  
liberty to make these sentiments known, as  
the grounds of my procedure. While I feel  
the most lively gratitude for the many instan­  
ces of approbation from my country, I can no #  
otherwise deserve it than by obeying the dic­  
tates of my conscience.  
With due respect, I am, gentlemen,  
Your ob’t Gko. Washington
