[1 September 1814]  
  
Whereas the enemy by a sudden incursion have succeeded in invading the capital of the nation, defended at the moment by troops less numerous than their own, and almost entirely of the militia: during their possession of which, though for a single day only, they wantonly destroyed the public edifices having no relation in their structure to operations of war, nor used at the time for military annoyance; some of these edifices being also costly monuments of taste and of the arts, and others depositories of the public archives, not only precious to the nation as the memorials of its origin and its early transactions, but interesting to all nations, as  
  
contributions to the general stock of historical instruction and political science:  
And whereas, advantage has been taken of the loss of a fort, more immediately guarding the neighboring town of Alexandria, to place the town within the range of a naval force, too long and too much in the habit of abusing its superiority wherever it can be applied, to require, as the alternative of a general conflagration, an undisturbed plunder of private property, which has been executed in a manner peculiarly distressing to the inhabitants⟨,⟩ who had, inconsiderately, cast themselves upon the justice and generosity of the victor:  
And whereas, it now appears, by a direct communication from the British commander on the American station, to be his avowed purpose to employ the force under his direction “in destroying and laying waste such towns and districts upon the coast as may be found assailable;” adding to this declaration the insulting pretext that it is in retaliation for a wanton destruction committed by the army of the United States in Upper Canada, when it is notorious, that no destruction has been committed, which, notwithstanding the multiplied outrages previously committed by the enemy, was not unauthorized, and promptly shown to be so; and that the United States have been as constant in their endeavors to reclaim the enemy from such outrages, by the contrast of their own example, as they have been ready to terminate, on reasonable conditions, the war itself:  
And whereas, these proceedings and declared purposes, which exhibit a deliberate disregard of the principles of humanity, and the rules of civilized warfare, and which must give to the existing war a character of extended devastation and barbarism, at the very moment of negociations for peace, invited by the enemy himself, leave no prospect of safety to any thing within the reach of his predatory and incendiary operations, but in a manly and universal determination to chastise and expel the invader:  
Now, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the U. States, do issue this my Proclamation, exhorting all the good people thereof, to unite their hearts and hands in giving effect to the ample means possessed for that purpose. I enjoin it on all officers, civil and military, to exert themselves in executing the duties with which they are respectively charged. And more especially, I require the officers commanding the respective military districts, to be vigilant and alert in providing for the defence thereof; for the more effectual accomplishment of which, they are authorised to call to the defence of exposed and threatened places portions of the militia most convenient thereto, whether they be or be not parts of the quotas detached for the service of the United States under requisitions of the general government.  
On an occasion which appeals so forcibly to the proud feelings and patriotic devotion of the American people, none will forget what they owe to themselves; what they owe to their country and the high destinies which  
  
await it; what to the glory acquired by their fathers, in establishing the independence which is now to be maintained by their sons, with the augmented strength and resources with which time and Heaven have blessed them.  
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents.  
Done at the City of Washington, the first day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, and of the independence of the United States the thirty-ninth.  
  
James Madison.

AVureas the enemy hy a sudden incur­  
sion have succeeded in invading the capitol  
of the nation, defended at the moment by  
troops less numerous than their own, and  
almost entirely of the militia: during their  
possession of which, though for a single day  
only, they wantonly destroyed the public  
edifices having no relation in their structure  
to operations of war, nor used at the time for  
military annoyance ; some of these edifices  
being also costly monuments of taste and  
the arts, and others depositories of the pub­  
lic archives, not only precious to the na­  
tion as the memorials of its origin and  
| its early transactions, but interesting to all i  
I nations, as contributions to the general  
stock of historical instruction and political  
science:  
And whereas, advantage has been taken  
of the loss of a fort, more immediately  
guarding the neighboring town of Alexan­  
dria, to place the town within the range of  
a naval force, too long and too much in the  
habit of abusing its superiority wherever it  
can be applied, to require, as the alterna­  
tive of a general conflagration, an undisturb  
ed plunder of private property, which has  
‘ been executed in a manner peculiarly dis­  
J tressing to the inhabitants, who had, incon­  
■ siderately, cast themselves upon the justice  
1 and generosity of the victor :  
And whereas, it now appears, by a di­  
rct communication from the British com­  
mander on the American station, to he his  
avowed purpose to employ the force under  
his direction “ in destroying and laying  
waste such towns and districts upon the  
i coast as may be found assailable adding  
! to this declaratiou the insulting pretext that  
I it is in retaliation for a wanton destruction  
; committed by the army of the U. States  
in Upper Canada, when it is notorious, that  
no destruction has been committed, which,  
notwithstanding the multiplied outrages  
i previously committed by the enemy, was  
j not unauthorised, and promptly shown to  
I be 60 ; and that the United States have  
been as constant in their endeavors to re­  
claim the enemy for such outrages, by the  
contrast of their own example, as they  
have been ready to terminate, on reasona­  
ble conditions, the war itself:  
And whereas, these proceedings and de­  
clared purposes, which exhibit a deliberate  
disregard of the principles of humanity, and  
the rules of civilized warfare, and which  
must give to the existing war a char­  
acter of extended devastation and barba­  
rism, at the very moment* negociations for  
peace, invited by the enemy himself, leave  
  
no praspect .of safety to toy thing within  
the reach of his predatory and incendiary  
operations, but in manful and universal  
determination to chastise and expel the in­  
vader :  
Now, therefore, I, James Madison, Presi­  
dent of the United States, do issue this my  
Proclamation, exhorting all the good peo­  
ple thereof, to unite their hearts and hands  
: in giving effect to the ample means posses­  
sed for that purpose 1 enjoin it on all offi­  
cers, civil and military, to exert themselves  
in executing the duties with which they  
are respectively charged. And more espe­  
cially, 1 require the officers commanding  
| the respective military districts, to be vigi­  
lant and alert in providing for the defence  
| thereof; for the more effectual accomplish­  
i ment of which, they are authorised to call to  
the defence of exposed and threatened pla­  
ces portions of the militia most convenient  
thereto, whether they be or be not parts of  
I the quotas detached for the service of the  
United States under requisitions of the  
general government.  
On an occasion which appeals so forcibly  
to the proud feelings and patriotic devotion  
of the American people, none will forget  
what they owe to themselves -t what they  
owe to their country and the high destinies  
which await it j what to the glory acquir­  
ed by their fathers, in establishing the in­  
dependence which is now to be maintained  
by their sons, with the augmented strength  
and resources with which time and Heaven  
has blessed them.  
In testimony whereof, 1 have hereunto  
set my hand and caused the seal of the  
United States to bo fixed to these pre­  
sents.  
Done at the City of Washington, the first  
day of Sept, in the year of our Lord,

And whereas, advantages have been  
taken of the loss of a fort more immedi.  
ately guarding the neigsboring town of  
Alexandria, to place tha® town within the  
range of a naval force, too long and too  
much in the habit of abusing its superior­  
ity, wherever it can be applied, to require  
as the alternative of a gederal confla­  
gration, an undisturbed plunder of pri­  
vate property, which has been executed  
In a manner peculiarly distressing to  
the inhabitants, who had inconsiderate­  
ly cast themselves on the generosity  
of the victor:  
  
And whereas, it now appears by a di.‘i  
rect communication from the British |  
naval commander on the American sta­  
tion, to be his avowed purpose to em- ?  
ploy the force under his direction * in  
destroying and laying waste such towns |  
and districts upon the coast as may bc‘  
found assailable ;&quot; adding to this de­  
claration, the insulting pretext that it is  
in retaliation for the wanton destruction  
committed by the army of the U. S. in !  
Upper Canada, when it 13 notorious 1  
that no destruction has been committed,  
which, notwithstanding the multiplied  
outrages previously committed by thei  
enemy, was not authorised, and prompt­  
ly shewn to be so ; and that the United |  
States, have been as constant in theirl  
endeavors to reclaim the enemy from  
such: outrages, hy the contrast of theirl  
own example, as they have Been ready  
to terminate, on reasonable conditions  
the war itself. &quot;  
And whereas these proceedings and de­  
clared purposes, which exhibit a disrea,  
gard of the principles of hymanity,and the ’  
rules of civilized warfare, and which must |  
give to the existing war, a character of  
extended devastation and barbarism, ati  
the very moment of negociations for  
peace, invited by. the encmy. himself, i  
leave no prospect of safcty to any thing |  
within the reach of his predatory and in- |

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE  
- STATES OF AMERICA.  
A PROCLAMATION.  
Whereas the enemy by a  
sudden incursion have succeeded  
in iiivading the capital of the na­  
tion, defended at the moment by  
troops iess numerous than their  
own, and almost entirely of the  
militia : during their possession  
of which, though for a single day  
only, they Wantonly destroyed the  
public edifices haying no relation  
in their structure to operations ol  
war, nor used at the time for  
military annoyance j some of  
these edifices being also costly  
monuments of taste and of the  
arts, and others depositories of  
the public archives, not only pre­  
cious to the nation as the memo­  
rials of its orifcih and its earlv  
transactions, but interesting to all  
nations, as contributions to the ge­  
neral stock of historical instruc­  
tion aid political science :  
1 And whereas advantage has  
been taken of the loss of a fort,  
more immediately guarding the  
neighboring towu of Alexandria,  
to place the town within the range  
of a naval, force, too long &amp; too  
much in the habit of abusing its  
supeority wherever it can be ap­  
plied, to require, as the alterna­  
tive of a general conflagration,  
an undisturbed plunder of private  
properity, which has been execu­  
ted in a manner peculiarly dis  
tressing to the. inhabitants who  
had, inconsiderately, cast them  
selves upon the justice and gene­  
rosity of the victor :  
And whereas, it now appears,  
bv a direct communication from  
the British commander on the A  
merican station to be his avowed  
purpose to employ the force un­  
der his direction &quot;in destroying  
and laying waste such towns and  
districts upon the coast as may  
be found assailable ? adding to this  
declaration the insulting pretext  
that it is in retaliation for a  
wanton destruction committed by  
the armv ofthe U. States in Up  
per Canada, when it is notorious,  
that no destruction has been com­  
mitted, which, notwithstanding  
the multiplied outrages previous­  
ly committed by the enemy, was  
not unauthorised, and promptly  
shown to be so ; and that tpe  
United States have been as con­  
stant in their endeavors- to re­  
claim the enemy from such out­  
rages, bv the contrast of their  
own example, as they have been

Now, therefore, I, James Ma­

mation, exorting all the good  
people thereof; to unite their

oflicers, civil and military, to ex­  
ert themselves in executing the  
duties with which they are re  
spectfully charged. A nd more  
espicially, I require the officers  
commanding the respective mi­  
litary districts, to be vigilent and  
alert in providing for the defence  
thereof for the more ! effectual  
accomplishment of which they  
are authorised to call to the de

Supplement to the Java Government Gazette.  
SATURDAY, JUNE 10, 1815.  
AMERICAN PAPERS.  
WASHINGTON, SEPT. 8.  
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  
STATES OF AMERICA.  
A PROCLAMATION.  
Whereas the enemy by a sudden incursion  
have succeeded in invading the capital of the  
nation, defended at the moment by troops  
Jess numerous than their own, and almost  
entirely of the militia; during their possession  
of which, though for a single day only, they  
wantonly destroyed the public edifices, having  
no relation in their structure to operations of  
war, imr used at the time for military an.  
noyance; some of these edifices I)eing also  
cosily monuments of taste and of the arts,  
and others repositories of the public archives,  
not only precious to the nation, as the me­  
morials of Us origin and its early transactions,  
but interesting to all nations, as contribu­  
tions to the general stock of historical  
Instruction and political science.  
And whereas, advantage has been taken  
of the loss of a fort, more immediately guard­  
ing the neighbouring town of A lexandria, to  
pi,ice the lown within the range of a naval  
force, too long and too much in the habit  
of abusing its superiority wherever it can be  
applied, to require, as the alternative of a  
general conflagration, an undisturbed plunder  
of private property, which has been executed  
in a maimer peculiarly distressing to the  
inhabitants, w lio had inconsiderately cast  
themselves upon the justice and generosity  
of the victor.  
And whereas, it now appears, by a direct  
communication from the British Commander  
on the American station, to be his avowed  
purpose to employ the force under his direc­  
tion, &quot; in destroying and laying waste such  
towns and districts upon the coast as may be  
lound assailable adding to this declaration  
the insulting pretext that it is in retaliation  
lor a wanton destruction committed by  
the army of the United States in Upper  
t anada, when it is notorious, that no des­  
truction has been committed, which, notwith.  
standing the multiplied outrages previously  
committed by the enemy, was not unauthorised  
and promptly shown to be so ; and that the  
United States have been as constant in their  
endeavors to reclaim tlie enemy from such  
outrages, by the contrast of their own exam­  
ple, as the) have been ready to terminate,  
011 reasonable conditions, the war itself.  
And whereas, these proceedings and declared  
purposes, which exhibit a deliberate disregard  
of the principles of humanity, and the rules  
of civilized warfare, and which must give to  
the existing war a character of extended  
devastation and barbarism, at the very moment  
of negotiations for peace, invited by the enemy  
himself, leave no prospect of safety to any thing  
within the reach of his predatory and incen­  
diary operations, but in manful and universal  
determination to chastise and expel the invader.  
Now, therefore, I, James Madison, Presi­  
dent of the United States, do issue this my  
proclamation, exhorting all the good people  
thereof, to unite their hearts and hands in  
giving effect to the ample means possessed  
for that purpose. 1 enjoin it on all oflicers,  
civil and military, to exert themselves in exe­  
cuting the duties with which they are respec­  
tively charged. And more especially, 1 require  
tbeotficcrs commanding the respective military  
districts, to be vigilant and alert m providing  
for the defence thereof; for the more effectual  
accomplishment of which, they are authorised  
to call to the defence ol exposed and threaten,  
fd places portions of the militia most con-  
Venient thereto, whether they be or be not  
parts of the quotas detached for the service  
of tlie United States under requisitions of  
the general government.  
On an occasion which appeals so forcibly  
to the proud feelings and patriotic devotion  
of the American people, none will forget  
•what they owe to themselves, what they owe  
to their country and the high destinies which  
• wait it; «hat to the glory acquired by  
th ir fathers, in establishing the independence  
which is now to be maintained by their sons,  
with the augmented strength and resources  
with which time and lieaven had blessed  
them.  
In testimony whereof I have hereunto  
set my hand, and caused the seal of the  
United Stutis to be fixed to these presents.  
Done at the city of Washington, the first  
day of September, in the year of our Lord  
1814, and of the Independence of the United  
&#x27;States the 39ih.  
JAS. MADISON.  
By the President, JAS. M ON itOE, Sec. of S ate.

paper on the P;esideul&#x27;s proclamation : —

WASHINGTON IN DANG Hit.  
President Madison&#x27;s Proclamation  
When tho llrltlsh Wero Hero.  
The original of the proclamation by  
President Madison announcing the  
burning of Washington In 181-1. It is  
printed on a sheet of letter paper of  
that day, a full sheet, not a letter head.  
This is yellow with nso and

11 i THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  
STATES OF AMERICA,  
A riiOCLAMATIOX.  
WHEREAS, the enemy by a sudden In­  
cursion havo succeeded In Invading tho  
capital of tho nation, defended ut the mo­  
ment by troops less numcious than their  
own, nnd almost entirely of tho militia,  
during their possession of which, though  
for n single day onlv, they wantonly do­  
ftrojed tho public edlflees, having no rela­  
tion In their structuro to operations of war,  
nor used at tho time for military annoy­  
ance; eomo of these edifices belnc also  
costly monuments of taste and of the arts,  
and others depositories of tho public  
archives, not on!)&#x27; precious to the nation as  
tho memorials of its origin nnd Its eirly  
transactions, but Interesting to all nations,  
ns contributions to tbo general stock or  
historical instruction and political science:  
And vthciens, advantage has been taken  
of tho loss of a fort, moro immediately  
guarding tho neighboring tonu of Alex­  
andria, to placo tlio town within tho lango  
of a naval force, too long and too much In  
tho habit of abusing Its superiority, where­  
ever it can bo applied, to require as the  
alternative of n gencrul conllagiatlon, an  
undisturbed plunder of privnto properly,  
which has been executed In a manner pecu­  
liarly distressing to tho Inhabitants who  
bad, Inconsiderately, cast themselves ou tho  
justice and genoroBity of tho victor:  
Anu wucreas, it now appears oy a direct  
communication from tho British naval  
commander on tbo American station, to ho  
bis avowed purposo to employ tho forco  
under bis direction &quot;In destroying and lay­  
iDg waste such towns and districts upon the  
coast as may be found assailable;&quot; adding  
to this declaration, tho insultlDg pretext  
that It Is In retaliation for a wanton de­  
struction committed by tho army of tho  
United States In Upper Canada, when It Is  
notorious, that no destruction lias been  
committed, which, notwithstanding tho  
multiplied outrages previously committed  
by tho enemy, was not unauthorised, and  
promptly shown to bo so; and that tbo  
United States have been as constant in their  
endeavors to reclaim tho enemy from such  
outrages, by tho contrast of their own ex­  
ample&quot;, as thoy havo been ready to termi­  
nate, on reasonable conditions, the war  
Itself:  
And whereas, theso proceedings and de­  
clared purposes, which exhibit n deliberate  
disregard of tho principles of humanity,  
and tho rules of civilised warfare, and  
which must givo to tho oxlsting war a char­  
acter of extended devastation and barbar­  
ism, at tho very moment of negotiations  
for peace, Invited by tho enemy himself,  
leave no prospect of safety to any thlug  
within tho reach of his predatory and in­  
cendiary operations, but in n manly and  
universal determination to chastise and ex­  
pel tho Invader:  
Now, therefore, I, James Madison, presi­  
dent of the United States, do Issuo this  
my proclamation, exhorting all the good  
people thereof, to unito their hearts and  
hands In giving effect to tho ample means  
possessed for that purpose. I enjoin it on all  
ofllccrs, civil and military, to exert them­  
selves In executing tho duties with which  
thoy aro respectively charged. And moro  
especially, I require tbo ofllccrs command­  
ing tho respcctlvo military districts, to bo  
Vigilant and alert in providing for tho de­  
fenco thereof; for tho moro effectual ac­  
complishment of which, they aro author­  
ised to call to tho defence of exposed and  
threatened places, portions of tho militia  
most convenient thereto, whether thgy bo  
or bo not parts of tho quotas detached for  
tho servlco of tho United States under  
requisitions of tho general government.  
On nn occasion which appeals so forcibly  
to tbo proud feelings and patriotic devo­  
tion of tho American people, nono will  
forget what thoy owo to themselves; what  
they owo to their country and tho high des­  
tlults which await it; what to thu glory ac­  
quired by their fathers, In establishing tbo  
Independenco which Is now to ho main­  
tained by their sous, with the augumentcd  
strength and resources w Ith w hlch tlmo and  
Ilcavvn havo blessed them.  
In testimony wheteof, I havo  
hereunto caused the seal of tho  
United States to bo affixed by  
theso presents.

tho first day of Septcmbor, iu
