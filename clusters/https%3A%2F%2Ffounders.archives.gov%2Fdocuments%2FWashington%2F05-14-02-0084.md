 scrupulous truth I can assure you, that your free &amp; unreserved  
opinion upon any public measure of importance will always be acceptable to me, whether  
it respects men, or measures—and on no man do I wish it to be expressed more fully than  
on myself; for as I can conscientiously declare that I have no object in view  
incompatible with the Constitution, and the obvious interests of this Country—nor no  
earthly desire half as strong as that of returning to the walks  
of private life, so, of consequence I only wish whilst I am a Servant of the public, to  
know the will of my masters, that I may govern myself accordingly.  
You do me no more than justice when you suppose that from motives of respect to the  
Legislature (and I might add from my interpretation of the Constitution) I give my  
Signature to many Bills with which my judgment is at varience. In declaring this,  
however, I allude to no particular Act. From the nature of the Constitution, I must  
approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto. To do the latter can only be  
justified upon the clear and obvious ground of propriety; and I never had such  
confidence in my own faculty of judging as to be over tenacious of the opinions I may  
have embibed in doubtful cases.  
Mrs Washington who enjoys tolerable good health joins me most cordially in best wishes  
for you and Mrs Pendleton. I wish you may l

To the Editor of The Sun :  
Sit -George Washington wrote to  
Edmund Pendleton in 1793 : &quot;I only  
wish whilst 1 am a servant of the  
public to know ihe will of my mas?  
ters, that I may govern myself ac?  
cordingly. You do me no more than  
justice when you suppose that from  
motives of respect to the legislature  
(and I ought to add from my inter?  
pretation of the Constitution) I give  
ray signature to many bills with  
which my judgment is at variance  
* * * I never had such conti  
dence in my own faculty of judging  
as to be ever tenacious of the opin?  
ions I have imbibed in doubtful  
cases.7
