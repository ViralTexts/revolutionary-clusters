I sometimes, in my sprightly moments, consider my self, in my great Chair at School, as some Dictator at the head of a commonwealth. In this little State I can discover all the great Genius’s, all the surprizing actions and revolutions of the great World in miniature. I have severall renowned Generalls but 3 feet high, and several deep-projecting Politicians in peticoats. I have others catching and dissecting Flies, accumulating remarkable pebbles, cockle shells &amp;c., with as ardent Curiosity as any Virtuoso in the royal society. Some rattle and Thunder out A, B, C, with as much Fire and impetuosity, as Alexander fought, and very often sit down and cry as heartily, upon being out spelt, as Cesar did, when at Alexanders sepulchre he recollected that the Macedonian Hero had conquered the World before his Age. At one Table sits Mr. Insipid foppling and fluttering, spinning his whirligig, or playing with his fingers as gaily and wittily as any frenchified coxcomb brandishes his Cane or rattles his snuff box. At another sitts the polemical Divine, plodding and wrangling in his mind about Adam’s fall in which we sinned all as his primmer has it. In short my little school like the great World, is made up of Kings, Politicians, Divines, L.D. LL.D.’s, Fops, Buffoons, Fidlers, Sycho­phants, Fools, Coxcombs, chimney sweepers, and every other Character drawn in History or seen in the World. Is it not then the highest Pleasure my Friend to preside in this little World, to bestow the proper applause upon virtuous and generous Actions, to blame and punish every vicious and contracted Trick, to wear out of the tender mind every thing that is mean and little, and fire the new born soul with a noble ardor and Emulation. The World affords no greater Pleasure. Let others waste the bloom of Life, at the Card or biliard Table, among rakes and

‘‘I sometimes, in my sprightly mo-  
ments, consider myself in my great chair  
at school as some dictator at the head of  
a commonwealth. In this little state, I  
can discover all the great geniuses, all the  
surprising actions and revolutions of the  
great world in miniature.  
  
‘‘T have several renowned generals,  
but three feet high, and several deep,  
projecting politicians in petticoats. I  
have others catching flies, accumulating  
remarkable pebbles, cockle shells, etc.,  
with as ardent curiosity as any virtuoso  
in the Royal Society.  
  
‘*Some rattle and thunder out a, 3, «¢,  
with as much impetuosity as Alexander  
fought, and very often sit down and cry  
as heartily upon being outspelled as  
Ceesar did, when at Alexander’s sepul-  
chre he recollected that the Macedonian  
hero conquered the world before his age.  
  
‘“At one table sits Mr. Insipid, fop-  
pling and fluttering—spinning his whir-  
  
  
  
THE STAGNANT PERIOD. 5  
  
ligig or playing with his fingers as gayly  
and wittily as any Frenchified coxcomb  
brandishes his cane or rattles his snuff-  
box. At another sits the polemical di-  
vine, plodding and wrangling in his  
mind about Adam&#x27;s fall in which we  
sinned all, as his primer has it.  
  
‘‘In short, my little school is made up  
of kings, politicians, divines, LL. D.’s,  
fops, buffoons, fiddlers, sycophants, cox-  
combs, and every other character drawn  
in history or seen in the world. Is it not  
then the highest pleasure to preside in  
this little world, to bestow the proper ap-  
plause upon virtuous nnd generous ac-  
tions, to blame and punish the vicious  
trick, to tear out of the tender mind  
everything that is mean and little, and  
fire the new-born soul with a noble ardor  
and emulation? The world affords no  
greater delight.”’
