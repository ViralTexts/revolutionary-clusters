s his own, the intervening time was too short to be an object. My real wish was to avail the public of every occasion during the residue of the President’s period, to place things on a safe footing.—He was now called on to attend his company and he desired me to come and breakfast with him the next morning.  
Feb. 29. I did so, and after breakfast we retired to his room, and I unfolded my plan for the post-office, and after such an approbation of it as he usually permitted himself on the first presentment of any idea, and desiring me to commit it to writing, he, during that pause of conversation which follows a business closed, said in an affectionate tone, that he had felt much concern at an expression which dropt from me yesterday, and which marked my intention of retiring when he should. That as to himself, many motives obliged him to it. He had through the whole course of the war, and most particularly at the close of it uniformly declared his resolution to retire from public  affairs, and never to act in any public office; that he had retired under that firm resolution, that the government however which had been formed being found evidently too inefficacious, and it being supposed that his aid was of some consequence towards bringing the people to consent to one of sufficient efficacy for their own good, he consented to come into the convention, and on the same motive, after much pressing, to take a part in the new government and get it under way. That were he to continue longer, it might give room to say, that having tasted the sweets of office he could not do without them: that he really felt himself growing old, his bodily health less firm, his memory, always bad, becoming &lt;sensibly&gt; worse, and perhaps the other faculties of his mind shewing a decay to others of which he was insensible himself, that this apprehension particularly oppressed him, that he found moreover his activity lessened, business therefore more irksome, and tranquillity and retirement become an irresistable passion. That however he felt himself obliged for these reasons to retire from the government, yet he should consider it as unfortunate if that should bring on the retirement of the great officers of the government, and that this might produce a shock in the public mind of dangerous consequence

perceived at a late meeting of the trustees of the sinking fund that the Secretary of the Treasury had developed the plan he intended to pursue, and that it embraced years in it’s view.—He said that he considered the Treasury department as &lt;only a specie&gt; a much more limited one going only to the single object of revenue, while that of the Secretary of state embracing nearly all the objects of administration was much more important, and the retirement of the officer therefore would be more noticed: that tho’ the government had set out with a pretty general good will of the public, yet that symptoms of dissatisfaction had lately shewn themselves far beyond what he could have expected, and to what height these might arise in case of too great a change in the administration, could not be foreseen.—I told him that in my opinion there was only a single source of these discontents. Tho’ they had indeed appeared to spread themselves over the war department also, yet I considered that as an overflowing only from their real channel which would never have taken place if they had not first been generated in another department—to wit that of the treasury. That a system had there been contrived, for deluging the states with paper-money instead of gold and silver, for withdrawing our citizens from the pursuits of commerce, manufactures, buildings, and other branches of useful industry, to occupy themselves and their capitals in a species of gambling, destructive of morality, and which had introduced it’s poison into the government itself. That it was a fact, as certainly known as that he and I were then conversing, that particular members of the legislature, while those laws were on the carpet, had feathered their nests with paper, had then voted for the laws, and constantly since lent all the energy of their talents, and instrumentality of their offices to the establishment and enlargement of this system: that they had chained it about our necks for a great length of time; and in order to keep the game in their hands had from time to time aided in making such legislative constructions of the constitution as made it a very different thing from what the people  thought they had submitted to: that they had now brought forward a proposition, far beyond every one ever yet advanced, and to which the eyes of many were turned, as the decision which was to let us know whether we live under a limited or an unlimited government.—He asked me to what proposition I alluded?—I answered to that in the Report on manufactures which, under colour of giving bounties for the encouragement of particular manufactures, meant to establish the doctrine that the power given by the Constitution to collect taxes to provide for the general welfare of the U.S. permitted Congress to take every thing under their management which they should deem for the public welfare, and which is susceptible of the application of money: consequently that the subsequent enumeration of their powers was not the description to which resort must be had, and did not at all constitute the limits of their authority: that this was a very different question from that of the bank, which was thought an incident to an enumerated power: that therefore this decision was expected with great anxiety: that indeed I hoped the proposition would be rejected, believing there was a majority in both houses against it, and that if it should be, it would be considered as a proof that things were returning into their true channel; and that

honorable offices, or for bringing any sort  
of illegitimate influence into the halls of  
legislation, the first President, no less pure  
in mind than firm in authority, set none of  
them. Never was Mr. Jefferson farther  
from the truth, than when, in 1792, he  
declared that the Executive “had swal-  
lowed up the legislative branch.” Perhaps  
the error, however, ought to be set down  
to the fondness of the then Secretary of  
State for this particular figure of speech.  
For he also said, a short time before, that  
the Department of the Treasury had so  
increased in influence as to “swallow up

“ My real wish,” said he, “is to avail  
the public of every occasion, during  
the rest of the President’s period, to  
place things on a safe footing.”  
  
The conversation was interrupted  
here .at its most interesting moment.  
The President asked him to breakfast  
with him the next morning, in order  
that the subject might be resumed.  
They met accordingly, and when the  
post-office question had been duly  
considered, the President revived the  
topic of Jefferson’s intention to retire.  
“In an affectionate tone,” he told Jef-  
ferson that he had felt much concern

the contrary, at the last meeting of the

not  
  
did  
  
the Sec-  
retary of the Treasury had developed  
a plan of  
  
trustees of the sinking fund,  
  
operations which contem-  
plated years of his own personal ser-  
vice.  
  
General Washington was not reas-  
sured by this statement. He clung to  
Jefferson. He remarked that he con-  
sidered the Department of the Treas-  
ury less important and less conspicu-  
ous than the Department of State,  
which “ embraced nearly all the ob-  
  
jects of administration,” and that the  
  
retirement of a Secretary of State  
would be more noticed. Symptoms of  
dissatisfaction, he added, far beyond  
what could have been expectéd, had  
lately shown themselves, and to what  
height these might arise, in case of too  
great a change in the administration,  
could not be foreseen.  
  
Upon this, Jefferson’s tongue was  
loosed, and he expressed himself with-  
  
out reserve in words like these: “In  
  
  
  
1873.]  
  
my opinion there  
  
source of  
  
is only a single  
these discontents,— the  
treasury. A system has there been  
contrived for deluging the States with  
paper-money instead of gold and silver,  
for withdrawing our citizens from the  
pursuits of commerce, manufactures,  
buildings, and other branches of useful  
industry, to occupy themselves and  
their capitals in a species of gambling  
destructive of morality, which has in-  
troduced its poison into the govern-  
ment itself. It is a fact, as well known  
as that you and I are now conversing,  
that particular members of the legis-  
lature, while those laws were on the car-  
pet, feathered their nests with paper,  
then voted for the laws, and constant-  
ly since have lent all the energy of their  
talents and the instrumentality of  
offices to the establishment and  
enlargement of their system. They  
have chained the system round our  
necks for a great length of time, and,  
in order to keep the game in their own  
hands, they have from time to time  
aided in making such legislative con-  
structions of the Constitution as make  
it a very different thing from what the  
people thought they had submitted to.  
And now, they have brought forward a  
proposition far  
  
their  
  
beyond any one ad-  
vanced before; to which the eyes of  
many are now turned as the decision  
which is to let us know whether we  
under a limited or an unlimited  
  
government  
  
live  
  
“To what proposition do you al-  
lude ?” asked the President.  
  
“ To that,” replied Jefferson, “in the  
Report on Manufactures (by Hamilton)  
which, under color of giving bounties  
for the encouragement of particular  
manufactures, meant to establish the  
doctrine, that the Constitution, in giv-  
ing power to Congress to provide for  
the general welfare, permitted Congress  
to take everything under their charge  
which ¢hey should deem for the public  
welfare. If this was maintained, then  
the enumeration of powers in the Con-  
stitution does not at all constitute the  
limits of their authority.”  
  
With this topic the conversation end-  
  
The Quarrel of Fefferson and Hamilton.

retirement from tho Cabinet. When  
(juestioned as to his reasons for de  
siring to withdraw from Washington&#x27;s  
Cabinet, Jefferson plainly informed  
the President thnt the sole  
cause of dissatisfaction was in  
the policy of tho Treasury under  
Hamilton. After telling the President  
how, from timo to time gradual  
encroachments had been made  
on the constitutional powers ho said:

Reference is made to Hamilton&#x27;s  
report on manufactures, from which  
to this blessed day the leaders of the  
Republican party draw high tariff  
nnd protection inspiration. Jefferson,  
concering tho same report, further
