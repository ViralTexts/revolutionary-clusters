dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon May 20th 1792.  
  
As there is a possibility if not a probability, that I shall not see you on your return home; or, if I should see you, that it may be on the Road and under circumstances which will prevent my speaking to you on the subject we last conversed upon; I take  
  
the liberty of committing to paper the following thoughts, &amp; requests.  
I have not been unmindful of the sentiments expressed by you in the conversations just alluded to: on the contrary I have again, and again revolved them, with thoughtful anxiety; but without being able to dispose my mind to a longer continuation in the Office I have now the honor to hold. I therefore still look forward to the fulfilment of my fondest and most ardent wishes to spend the remainder of my days (which I can not expect will be many) in ease &amp; tranquility.  
Nothing short of conviction that my deriliction of the Chair of Government (if it should be the desire of the people to continue me in it) would involve the Country in serious disputes respecting the chief Magestrate, &amp; the disagreeable consequences which might result therefrom in the floating, &amp; divided opinions which seem to prevail at present, could, in any wise, induce me to relinquish the determination I have formed: and of this I do not see how any evidence can be obtained previous to the Election. My vanity, I am sure, is not of that cast as to allow me to view the subject in this light.  
Under these impressions then, permit me to reiterate the request I made to you at our last meeting—namely—to think of the proper time, and the best mode of anouncing the intention; and that you would prepare the latter. In revolving this subject myself, my judgment has always been embarrassed. On the one hand, a previous declaration to retire, not only carries with it the appearance of vanity &amp; self importance, but it may be construed into a Manœuvre to be invited to remain. And on the other hand, to say nothing, implys consent; or, at any rate, would leave the matter in doubt; and to decline afterwards might be deemed as bad, &amp; uncandid.  
I would fain carry my request to you farther than is asked above, although I am sensible that your compliance with it must add to your trouble; but as the recess may afford you leizure, and I flatter myself you have dispositions to oblige me, I will, without apology desire (if the measure in itself should strike you as proper, &amp; likely to produce public good, or private honor) that you would turn your thoughts to a Valadictory address from me to the public; expressing in plain &amp; modest terms—that having been honored with the Presidential Chair, and to the best of my  
  
abilities contributed to the Organization &amp; Administration of the government—that having arrived at a period of life when the private Walks of it, in the shade of retirement, becomes necessary, and will be most pleasing to me; and the spirit of the government may render a rotation in the Elective Officers of it more congenial with their ideas of liberty &amp; safety, that I take my leave of them as a public man; and in bidding them adieu (retaining no other concern than such as will arise from fervent wishes for the prosperity of my Country) I take the liberty at my departure from civil, as I formerly did at my military exit, to invoke a continuation of the blessings of Providence upon it—and upon all those who are the supporters of its interests, and the promoters of harmony, order &amp; good government.  
That to impress these things it might, among other things be observed, that we are all the Children of the same country—A Country great &amp; rich in itself—capable, &amp; promising to be, as prosperous &amp; as happy as any the Annals of history have ever brought to our view—That our interest, however deversified in local &amp; smaller matters, is the same in all the great &amp; essential concerns of the Nation. That the extent of our Country—the diversity of our climate &amp; soil—and the various productions of the States consequent of both, are such as to make one part not only convenient, but perhaps indispensably necessary to the other part; and may render the whole (at no distant period) one of the most independant in the world. That the established government being the work of our own hands, with the seeds of amendment engrafted in the Constitution, may by wisdom, good dispositions, and mutual allowances; aided by experience, bring it as near to perfection as any human institution ever aproximated; and therefore, the only strife among us ought to be, who should be foremost in facilitating &amp; finally accomplishing such great &amp; desirable objects; by giving every possible support, &amp; cement to the Union. That however necessary it may be to keep a watchful eye over public servants, &amp; public measures, yet there ought to be limits to it; for suspicions unfounded, and jealousies too lively, are irritating to honest feelings; and oftentimes are productive of more evil than good.  
To enumerate the various subjects which might be introduced into such an Address would require thought; and to mention them to you would be unnecessary, as your own judgment will  
  
comprehend all that will be proper; whether to touch, specifically, any of the exceptionable parts of the Constitu[t]ion may be doubted. All I shall add therefore at present, is, to beg the favor of you to consider—1st the propriety of such an Address. 2d if approved, the several matters which ought to be contained in it—and 3d the time it should appear: that is, whether at the declaration of my intention to withdraw from the service of the public—or to let it be the closing Act of my Administration—which, will end with the next Session of Congress (the probability being that that body will continue sitting until March,) when the House of Representatives will also dissolve.  
’Though I do not wish to hurry you (the cases not pressing) in the execution of either of the publications beforementioned, yet I should be glad to hear from you generally on both—and to receive them in time, if you should not come to Philadelphia until the Session commences, in the form they are finally to take. I beg leave to draw your attention also to such things as you shall conceive fit subjects for Communication on that occasion; and, noting them as they occur, that you would be so good as to furnish me with them in time to be prepared, and engrafted with others for the opening of the Session. With very sincere and Affectionate regard I am—ever Yours

MOUNT VBENON, May 2 &#x27;, 1792.  
Jfij Dear Sir :-Ai there is a possibility if not a  
probability, that I Khali r.ot i:ce you on your re?  
turn homo-or if I should see you that it may be  
on thc road, and under such circumstances as will  
prevent my spoaking to yon on tho subject we last  
conversed upon ? take tiio liberty cf committing to  
paper thc following thoughts and requests :  
I havenotbeen imminui&#x27;ul of thc sentiments ex?  
pressed by you in tho con-, crsation just alluded to;  
on tho contrary, I havo again and again revolved  
them with thoughtful anxiety, but without being  
able to dispose my mind to a longer continuation  
in thc office I have had tho honor to hold. Ithoro­  
foro still look forward to tho fulfillment of my  
fondost and most ardent wishes, to spend the ro­  
maindor of my days (which T cannot export .will bo  
many), in easo and tranquility.  
Nothing short of conviction that my dereliction  
of the ch .ir of government (if it should bo thc  
desire of thc people to continue mo in it) would  
involve tho country in serious disputes respecting  
the Chief Magistrate, and thc disagreeable conse?  
quences which might result therofrom in the float?  
ing and divided opinions which seem to prevail at  
present, could, in any wiso, induce me to relin?  
quish tho determination I have formed; and of this  
Ido cot see how any evidence can be obtained  
previous to thc olection. My vanity. I am sure, is  
not of that cast as to allow mc to view the subject  
in this light.  
Under these impressions then, permit mo to re?  
iterate the reques t made to you at our laet meet?  
ing, namely : To think of the propor time, and the  
best mode of announcing tho intention, and that  
you would preparo tho latter. In rovolving this  
subject myself, my judgmont has always boon em?  
barrassed. On the one hand, a previous declara?  
tion to rotiro, not only carries with it the appear?  
ance of vanity and self-importance, but it may be  
construed into a manouvre to be invited to remain.  
And on the other hand, to say nothing implies  
consent, or at any rate would leave the matter in  
doubt; and to declino afterwards might bc deemed  
as bad as uncandid.  
I would fain carry my request to you farther than  
fe asked abovo, although I am sensible that your  
compliance with it must add to your trouble; but as  
the recess may afford you leisure, and I flatter my?  
self you have a disposition to oblige mo, I will,  
without apology, desire (if the measure in itself  
ghould strike you as proper, and likely to produce  
good or private honor) that you would turn your  
thoughts to aveledictory address frpninie to the  
pubhe. expressing, in plain and modest tonns.  
fiiai Jiving been honored with the Presidential  
chair, and, to the oC^ TJ abilities, con?l?mit;e(i  
to tho organization and administration of the Gov?  
ernment; that having arrived at a period of fife  
When the private walks of it in the shade of retire?  
ment becomes necessary and will be most plciLSing ?  
to me, and the spirit of the Government may ren?  
ner a rotation in the election of officers of it more  
congenial with their ideas of liberty and. safety,  
that I take my leave of them as a public man; and  
. in bidding them .adieu, retaining no other concern  
csu.&#x27;&quot;: suca as mil arise irom icrmer wishes roi u&gt;u  
prosperity of my country. I take the liberty at my  
departure from civil, as I formerly did at my mili?  
tary exit, to invoke a continuation of the blessings  
of Providence upon it, and upon all those who are  
the supporters of its interests and the promoters  
of bart^?ay^ order an? good government.  
That to impress these things it might, among  
other things, be observed, that we are all the chil?  
dren of the same country-a country gfroat ar? ricn  
in itself, cnnable. and riromisin&quot; ^ oej ^ pVoper­  
OUs and&#x27;as happy as any the annals of history have  
ever brought to our view. That our interest, how?  
ever diversified in local and smaller matters, is the  
same in all the great essential concerns of tho na?  
tion. That the extent of our country, the diver?  
sity of our climate and soil, and the various pro?  
ductions of the States consequent of both, are such  
as to make one part not only convenient, but per?  
haps indipen8aby necessary to the other part, and  
may render the whole (at no distant period) one  
of the most independent in the world. Ih&amp;i  
the established government being the work of our  
own hands, with tho seeds of amendment im graft?  
ed in tho Constitution, may by wisdom, good dis?  
positions and mutual utterances, aided by experi?  
ence, bring it as near to perfection as any human  
institution ever approximated; and, therefore, the  
only strife among us ought to be who should be  
foremost in faourtating and finally accomplishing  
such great and desirable objects, by giving every  
possible support and cement to tho Union. That  
however necessary it may be to keep a watchful  
?ye over public servants and public measures, yet  
there ought to be limits to it, for suspicions un?  
founded, and lealouBics too lively, are irritating to  
honest feelings, and oftentimes are productive of  
more evil than good.  
To enumerate various subjects which might bo  
introduced into such an address would require  
thought, and to mention them to yon would be ne?  
cessary as your own judgment will comprehend all  
that will be proper; whether to touch specifically  
?ny of the exceptional parts of the Constitution  
may be doubted. All I shall add, therefore, at  
present is to beg the favor of you to consider-1st,  
the propriety of such an address; 2d, if approved,  
the several matters which ought to bo contained  
in it, and 3d, the time it should appear; that is,  
whether at tho declaration of my intention to  
withdraw from the service of the public, or to let  
it be the closing act of my administration, which  
will end with tue next session of Congress (the  
probability being that that body will continue sit?  
ting until March), when the House of Representa?  
tives will also dissolve.  
Though I do not wish to hurrv you (the case not  
pressing) in the execution of either of the publi?  
cations before mentioned, yet I shall be glad to  
hear from you generally on both; and to receive  
them in time, if you should not come to Philadel?  
phia until the session commences, in the form  
tiley are fin ally to take. I beg leave to draw your  
attention also to such things as you shall conceive  
fit tmbjects for communication on {hat occasion,  
and noting them as they occur, that you would be  
so good as to furnish me with them m time to be  
prepared and engrafted with others for the open­  
mg of the session. ._  
With very sincere and affectionate regard, I am,  
ever yours, GEO. WASHINGTON

MOUNT VERNON, May 20th, 1792.  
My Dear Sir: As there is a possibility,  
if not a probability, that I shall not see  
you on your return home, or if I should  
see you it may be on the road, and upon  
circumstances that will prevent my speak­  
ing to you on the subject we last conversed  
upon, 1 take the liberty of committing to  
paper the following thoughts and requests:  
1 have njt been unmindful of the senti­  
ments expressed by you in the conversa­  
tions just alluded to on the contrary, I  
have again and again revolved them with  
thoughtful anxiety, but without being able  
to dispose my mind to a longer continua­  
tion in the office I have had the honor to  
hold. 1 therefore shall look forward to the  
fulfillment of my fondest and most ardent  
Wishes, to spend the remainder of my days  
(which 1 cannot expect to be many) in ease  
and tranquility.  
  
Nothing short of the conviction that my  
dereliction  
of the chair of government, (if  
it should bc the desire of the people to  
continue me in it) would involve the coun­  
try in serious disputes respecting the Chief  
Magistrate, and the disagreeable conse­  
quences which might result therefrom in  
the fleeting and divided opinions which  
seem to prevail at present, could, in any  
wise, induce me to relax the determination I  
have formed and of this, I do not see how  
any evidence can be obtained previous to  
the election. My vanity, 1 am sure is, not  
of that cast as to allow me to view the sub­  
ject in this light.  
  
Under these impressions then permit me  
to reiterate the request I made to you at  
our last meeting numely To think of the  
propejr time, and the best mode of announc­  
ing the intentiob, and that you would pre­  
pare the letter. In revolving this subject  
myself, my judgment has always been em­  
barrassed.  
  
On the other hand, a previovs declara­  
tion to retire not only carries with it the  
appearance of vanity and self importance,  
but it may be constructed into a manouver  
to be invited to remain. And on the other  
hand, to say nothing implies consent, or, at  
any rate, would leave the matter in doubt  
ana to decline afterward might be deemed  
as bad and uncandid.  
  
I would carry my request to you farther  
than is aaked above, although I am sensi­  
ble that your compliance with it must add  
to your trouble, but as the recess may af­  
ford you leisure, and I flatter myself you  
have a disposition to oblige me I will,  
without apology, desire (if the measure in  
itself should strike you as proper, and like­  
ly to produce public good or private honor,)  
that you would turn your thoughts to a  
valadictory address from me, to the public,  
expressing, in plain and modest terms, that  
having been honored with the Presidential  
oh air and to the best of my abilities eontri*  
buted to the organisation and administra­  
tion of the Government—that having ar­  
rived at a period of life when the private  
walks of life and the shade of retirement  
become necossary, and will be most pleas­  
ing to me and the spirit of the Govern­  
ment may render a rotation in the election  
of officers of it more congenial with their  
ideas of liberty and safety, that 1 take my  
leave of them as a public man and to  
bidding them adieu (retaining no other  
oonoern than suoh as will arise fVom former  
wishes of the prosperity of my country,) 1  
take the liberty at my departure from civil,  
as 1 formerly did at my military exit, to  
invoke a continuation of the blessings&#x27; of  
Providenoe upon it, and upon all those who  
are the supporters of its interests, and tbe  
promoters of harmony, order and good  
government.  
  
That to impress those things it might  
among other things, be observed that we  
are all the children of the same country—  
a country great and rich in itself, capable,  
and promising to be as prosperous and as  
happv as any the annals of history have  
ever brought to our view. That our inter­  
est however diversified in local and smaller

MOUNT VERNON, May 20, 1792.  
My DeAr SiR: As there is a possibility, if not a probas  
bility, that I shall not see you on my return home, or, if I  
should see you, it may be on the road and under circum­  
stances which may prevent my speaking to you on the  
sublect we last conversed upon. I take the liberty of  
committing to paper the following thoughts and re­  
quests.  
I have not been unmindful of the sentwnents expressed  
by you in the conversations just alluded to. On the cone­  
trary, I have again and again revolved them with  
thoughiful anxiery, but without being able to dispos­  
my mind to a longer continuation in the office I have  
now the honor to hold. I therefore still look forward  
with the fondest and most ardent wishes to spend the  
remainder of my days, which I cannot expect to be long.  
in ease and tranquillity.  
Nothing but a conviction that my declining the chair  
of Government, if it should be the wish of the people to  
continue me in it, would invoive the country in serious  
disputes respecting the Chief Magistrate, and the disa­  
greeable consequences which might result theretrom in  
the floating and divided opinions, which seem to prevail  
at present, sould in any wise induce me to relinquish  
the determination I have formed; and of this I do not  
see how any evidence can be obtained previous to the  
election. My vanity, I am sure, is not of the cast to  
allow me to view the subject in this light.  
Under these impressions, then, permit me to relterate  
the request I made to you at our last meeting, namely,  
to think of the proper time and the best mode of al  
nouncing the intention, and that you would prepare the  
latter. In revolving this subject myself, my judgment  
has always been embarrassed. On the one hand, a pres  
vious deciaration to retire not only carries with it the  
appearance of vanity and self-importance, but it may be  
construed into a maneuver to be invited to remain; and,  
on the other hand, to say nothing implies consent, or at  
any rate would leave the mattef in doubt; and to dor  
oline afterwards might be decmed as bad and uncandid.  
I would fain carry my request to you furtreer than is  
ashed above, although I am seusible that your complte­  
ance with it must add to your trouble. Sut se the recese
