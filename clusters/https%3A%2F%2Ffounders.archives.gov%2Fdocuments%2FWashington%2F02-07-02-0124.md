lmvo you keep the measuro of tho

measure of a gentleman who wears well-made cloaths of the following size, to wit :  
Six feet high and proportionably made ; if anything, rather slender than thick for  
a person of that heighth, with pretty long arms and thighs. You will take care to  
make the breeches longer than those you sent me last, and I would have you keep  
the measure of the cloaths you now make by you, and if any alteration is required  
in my next, it shall be pointed out. Mr. Cary will pay your bill. I am, sir, , our  
very obedient humble servant. GEORGE WASHINGTON.
