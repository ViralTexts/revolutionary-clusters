Treasury DepartmentMarch 16, 1792.[Communicated on March 17, 1792]  
[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
The Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to a Resolution of the House of Representatives of the 8th instant directing the said Secretary to report to the House his opinion of the best mode of raising the Additional Supplies requisite for the ensuing year, respectfully submits the following report.  
The sum which is estimated to be necessary for carrying into effect the purposes of the Act for making further and more effectual provision for the protection of the Frontiers of the United States beyond the provision made by the Act making appropriations for the support of Government for the year 1792 is Dollars 675.950.8  
The returns which have been received at the Treasury subsequent to the Secretarys Report of the 23rd. of January last, among which are those of some principal ports afford satisfactory ground of assurance, that the quarter ending the last of December was considerably more productive than it was supposed likely to prove; authorizing a reliance that the revenues to the end of the year 1791 will yield a surplus of 150.000 dollars which may be applied in part of the sum of 675.950 dollars and eight Cents above stated to be necessary.  
Provision remains to be made for the residue of this sum namely 525.950 Dollars &amp; 8 Cents.  
Three expedients occur to the option of the government for providing this sum.  
One, to dispose of the Interest, to which the United States are intitled in the Bank of the United States. This, at the present market price of Bank Stock, would yield a clear gain to the Government much more than adequate to the sum required.  
Another, to borrow the money; upon an establishment of funds, either merely commensurate with the interest to be paid, or affording a surplus which will discharge the principal by installments within a short term.  
The third is to raise the amount by taxes.  
The first of these three expedients appears to the Secretary altogether unadviseable.  
First. It is his present opinion, that it will be found, in various respects, permanently the interest of the United States to retain the Interest to which they are intitled in the Bank. But  
Secondly—If this opinion should not be well founded, it would be improvident to dispose of it at the present juncture—since upon a comprehensive view of the subject, it can hardly admit of a doubt, that its future value, at a period not very distant, will be considerably greater than its present—While the Government will enjoy the benefit of whatever dividends shall be declared in the Interval. And  
Thirdly—Whether it shall be deemed proper to retain or dispose of this Interest, the most useful application of the proceeds will be as a fund for extinguishing the public debt. A necessity of applying it to any different object, if it should be found to exist, would be matter of serious regret.  
The second expedient would in the judgment of the Secretary be preferable to the first.  
For this the following Reason, if there were no other, is presumed to be conclusive—namely, That the probable increase of the value of the Stock may itself be estimated as a considerable, if not a sufficient fund, for the repayment of the sum which might be borrowed.  
If the measure of a Loan should be thought eligible, it is submitted as most adviseable to accompany it with a provision, sufficient not only to pay the interest, but to discharge the principal within a short period. This will, at least, mitigate the inconvenience of making an addition to the public debt.  
But the result of mature reflection is, in the mind of the Secretary, a strong conviction, that the last of the three expedients, which have been mentioned, is to be preferred to either of the other two.  
Nothing can more interest the National Credit and prosperity, than a constant and systematic attention to husband all the means previously possessed for extinguishing the present debt, and to avoid, as much as possible, the incurring of any new debt.  
Necessity alone therefore can justify the application of any of the public property, other than the annual Revenues, to the current service, or to the temporary and casual exigencies of the Country—or the contracting of an additional debt, by loans, to provide for these exigencies.  
Great emergencies indeed might exist in which loans would be indispensible. But the occasions which will justify them must be truly of that description.  
The present is not of such a nature. The sum to be provided is not of magnitude enough to furnish the plea of necessity.  
Taxes are never welcome to a community. They seldom fail to excite uneasy sensations more or less extensive. Hence a too strong propensity, in the Governments of Nations, to anticipate and mortgage the resources of posterity, rather than encounter the inconveniences of a present increase of taxes.  
But this policy, when not dictated by very peculiar circumstances, is of the worst kind. Its obvious tendency is, by enhancing the permanent burdens of the people, to produce lasting distress, and its natural issue is in National Bankruptcy.  
It will be happy, if the Councils of this country, sanctioned by the voice of an enlightened community, shall be able to pursue a different course.  
Yielding to this impression, The Secretary proceeds to state for the consideration of the House the objects, which have occurred to him as most proper to be resorted to, for raising the requisite sum by taxes.  
From the most careful view, which he is able to take of all the circumstances, that at the present juncture naturally enter into consideration, he is led to conclude, that the most eligible mode, in which the necessary provision can at this time be made, is by some additional duties on imported articles.  
This conclusion is made with reluctance, for reasons which were noticed upon a former occasion, and from the reflection, that frequent and unexpected alterations in the rates of duties, on the objects of Trade, by inducing uncertainty in mercantile speculations and calculations, are really injurious to Commerce and hurtful to the interests of those who carry it on.  
The stability of the duties to be paid by the merchants is in fact of more consequence to them than their quantum; if within reasonable bounds.  
It were therefore much to have been wished that so early a resort to new demands on that class of Citizens could have been avoided—and especially that they could have been deferred, until a general Tariff could have been maturely digested, upon principles, which might with propriety render it essentially stationary.  
But while there are these motives to regret, there are others of a consoling tendency; some of which indicate, that an augmentation of duties, at the present juncture, may have the effect of lessening some public evils, and producing some public benefits.  
It is a pleasing fact, if the information of the Secretary be not very erroneous—that the improved state of the credit of this country enables our Merchants to procure the supplies, which they import from abroad, upon much more cheap, and advantageous terms than heretofore; a circumstance which must alleviate to them the pressure of somewhat higher rates of duty; and must contribute at the same time to reconcile them to burthens, which being connected with an efficacious discharge of the duty of the government, are of a nature to give solidity and permanency to the advantages they enjoy under it.  
It is certain, also, that a spirit of manufacturing prevails at this time, in a greater degree, than it has done at any antecedent period; and as far as an increase of duties shall tend to second and aid this spirit, they will serve to promote essentially the industry, the wealth, the strength, the independence and the substantial prosperity of the country.  
The returns for a year, ending with the 30th of September last, an abstract of which is in preparation to be communicated to the Legislature, evince a much increased importation, during that year, greater far than can be referred to a naturally increasing demand, from the progress of population, and announce a probability of a more than proportional increase of consumption; there being no appearance of an extraordinary abundance of goods in the Market. If happily an extension of the duties shall operate as a restraint upon excessive consumption, it will be a salutary mean of preserving the community from future embarrassment, public and private. But if this should not be the case, it is at least prudent in the government, to extract from it the resources necessary for current exigencies, rather than postpone the burthen to a period, when that very circumstance may cause it to be more grievously felt.  
These different considerations unite with others, which will suggest themselves to induce, in the present state of things, a preference of taxes on imported articles to any other mode of raising the sum required.  
It is therefore respectfully submitted.  
That the existing duties on the Articles hereafter enumerated be repealed and that in place of them the following be laid—Vizt.

The foregoing duties to be permanently established and to be appropriated in the first place to the payment of the interest of the public debt, in the second to such other grants and appropriations as have been heretofore made, and in the third to the purposes of the Act for making further and more effectual provision for the protection of the frontiers of the United States.  
  
An addition of two &amp; half ⅌ Cent advalorem to be made to the duty on all goods heretofore rated at five ⅌ Centum ad valorem.  
This addition to be temporary, and accordingly to be so established as that it shall not continue longer, than till the present Indian War shall terminate, and the expences of carrying it on shall have been defrayed, which will of course include the reimbursement of any sums, that may have been borrowed by way of anticipation of the product of the duties.  
It is represented that the present duty on Salt operates unequally from the considerable difference in weight in proportion to quantity of different kinds of Salt, a bushel weighing from about 56 to upwards of 80 Wt. It would have an equalizing effect if the bushel were defined by weight; and if 56 pounds were taken as the standard, a valuable accession to the revenue would result.  
This regulation is therefore submitted as a resource upon the present occasion. The rate of duty to remain as it is.  
It will be a reasonable accomodation to Trade, if it is made a part of this arrangement, to extend the credit for the duty on salt to a longer term. It is an article which from the circumstances of its importation frequently lies on hand for a considerable time; and in relation to the Fisheries is usually sold upon a credit of several Months.  
Some remarks may be proper in regard to the proposed duties.  
Those on Spirits and Wines may appear high. They are doubtless considerable. But there are precedents elsewhere of much higher duties on the same Articles. And it is certainly in every view justifiable to make a free use of them for the purposes of Revenue.  
Wines generally speaking are the luxury of classes of the community who can afford to pay a considerable duty upon them.  
It has appeared adviseable to adhere to the idea of a specific duty ⅌ Quantity on all the species of wines in most common consumption in the Country, and those most susceptible of precise designation; as affording greatest certainty to the Revenue. And to adopt a general ad valorem rate for other kinds, proportioned to the specific duties. This rate is 40 ⅌ Cent.  
The distinction has proceeded from the difficulty of a precise enumeration of all the other kinds of Wine, which are and may be imported, and of such an adjustment of specific rates, as will bear some reasonable proportion to the value of the Article. The present lowest rate of duty on Wines amounts to 200 and 300 ⅌ Cent on the value of certain kinds; which may be considered as equivalent to a prohibition.  
While therefore ideas of proportion will be better consulted than heretofore, by the proposed arrangement, it is probable, that the revenue will be benefitted, rather than injured, by a reduction of the duties on low priced Wines.  
The considerations which render Ardent Spirits a proper object of high duties, have been repeatedly dwelt upon. It may be added that it is a familiar and a just remark that the peculiarly low price of Ardent spirits in this Country is a great source of Intemperance.  
To bring the price of the Article more nearly to a level with the price of it in other markets by an increase of duty, while it will contribute to the advancement of the revenue, cannot but prove in other respects a public benefit. The rates proposed will be still moderate compared with examples in other Countries; and the Article is of a nature to enable the Importer, without difficulty, to transfer the duty to the consumer.  
A discrimination is suggested in respect to duties on spirits distilled from Grain. To this, there have been two inducements—One, that the difference in the duty is conformable to the difference [between] the cost of the grain Spirits usually imported and [that] of West India Rum. Another, that it is in a particular manner the interest of the United States to favor the distillation of its own grain, in competition with foreign spirits from the same material. In the second division of Spirits, the first class of proof is dropped; because none of it comes from the West Indies; and because any other Spirits usually imported which may be of so low a proof are higher priced, even than some of the higher proofs of West India Spirits. The dropping of that class of proof therefore in this case is favorable to the Revenue and favorable to equality.  
Several of the other specific duties which are proposed, besides the inducements to them as items of revenue are strongly recommended by considerations which have been stated in the Report of the Secretary on the subject of manufactures. The same Report states inducements to a 15 ⅌ Cent duty on some of the Articles, which are mentioned, as proper to be comprized under that rate.  
  
With regard to China and Glass there are two weighty reasons for a comparitively high duty upon them. The use of them is very limited except by the wealthier classes. And both their bulk and liability to damage in transportation are great securities against evasions of the Revenue. It will however merit consideration whether for the accommodation of Importers a longer term of credit ought not to be allowed on these Articles.  
A duty of two Cents ⅌ lb on Cocoa is less in proportion to value than the present duty on Coffee. As an extensive article of consumption it is a productive one of Revenue.  
The Duty on playing cards can give rise to no question except as to the practicability of a safe Collection. In order to this it will be proper to supperadd certain precautions, which will readily occur in regulating the details of a bill for the purpose. A similar attention will be requisite in regard to the duties on Wines. The employment of marks and certificates may advantageously be extended to this Article.  
The rate of 10 ⅌ Centum ad valorem it is hoped will not be deemed immoderate in relation to the Articles to which it is proposed to apply it. It is difficult to assign rules for what ought to be considered as a just standard. But after the best consideration, which the Secretary has been able to bestow upon it, he cannot discover, that any real inconvenience is likely permanently to result from the extension of that rate to the cases proposed.  
The addition of 2½ ⅌ Cent to the duty on the mass of articles now rated at 5 will constitude an important, though not an excessive augmentation. Nevertheless, it is proposed, that it shall be only temporary—and there is reasonable ground of expectation, that the cause for having recourse to it will not be of very long continuance.  
It will not have escaped the observation of the House that the duties which were suggested in the Secretary’s report, on that subject, as encouragements to Manufactures, are for the most part included among the objects of this report.  
It may tend to avoid future embarrassment, if such abolitions and drawbacks, as shall be deemed expedient, with a view to promoting manufactures, shall accompany the establishment and appropriation of whatever further duties may be laid, for the object in contemplation.  
And it may be found convenient to qualify the appropriation of the surplus which is to be applied to that object, so as to let in such other appropriations during the session as occurrences may suggest.  
An estimate of the additional revenue which may be expected from the proposed duties is subjoined.  
It will occur to the house, that the Credit allowed for the duties will require an anticipation of their product by a temporary loan for which provision in the law will be requisite.

THE Secretary of the Treasury, purfuam  
to a Resolution of the House of Represen­  
tatives of the Bth infant, directing thi  
said Secretary to report to the House hi.  
opinion of the bejl mode of raising the ad­  
ditional&#x27;/applies requifitefor the enfuhv  
year, refpeEtfully submits the following  
report.  
THE sum which is estimated to be  
necessary for carrying into effeel  
the purposes of the act for making fui­  
ther and more effectual provision foi  
the protection of the frontiers of the  
United States beyond the provifior  
made by the act making appropriation:  
for the support of government for the  
year 1792 is,  
Dollars 675,950.8  
The returns which have been receiv­  
ed at the Treasury subsequent to the  
&#x27; Secretary&#x27;s report of the 23d of Janua­  
ry lad, among which are thole of fomc  
principal ports, afford iatisfactory  
ground of assurance, that the quartet  
ending the last of December was confi­  
derabiy more productive than it was  
supposed likely to prove; authoiizing  
a reliance that the revenues to the end  
of the year &gt;791 will yield a surplus of  
150.000 dollars—which may be applied  
in part of the sum of 675,950 dollars  
and eight cents above Rated to be ne­  
cessary.  
Provision remains to be made for the  
residue of this sum, namely, 525&gt;95c  
Dollars and 8 cents.  
Three expedients occur to the optior  
of the government for providing thi:  
sum.  
One, to dispose of the intercfl, tc  
which the United Mates are cmnled ir  
the Bank of the United States. This  
at the present market price of Bank  
stock, would yield a clear gain to the  
government much more than adequate  
to the sum required.  
Another, to borrow the money upor  
an eftabiifhment of funds, either mercl)  
commensurate with the interest to be  
paid, or affording a surplus which wil  
difchargc the principal by inftallmcnt:  
within a short term.  
The third is to raise the amount b)  
taxes.  
The fir ft of these three expedient!  
appears to the Secretary altogethei  
unadvifeable.  
Firfl.—It is his present opinion, thai  
it will be found, in various respects.  
permanently the interest of the Unitec  
States to retain the interest to which  
they are entitled in the Bank. But  
Secondly—If this opinion should not  
be well founded, it would be improvi­  
dent to dispose of it at the present junc­  
ture since upon a comprehensive view  
of the subject, it can hardly admit of a  
doubt, that its future value, at a period  
net very distant, will be confielerably  
greater than its prefent—while the go­  
vernment will enjoy the benefit 01  
whatever dividends shall be declared  
in the interval. And  
Thirdly—Whether it shall be deemed  
proper to retain or dispose of this inte­  
reft| the mofl ufeful application of the  
proceeds will be as a fund for extin­  
guishing the public debt. A neccihty  
of applying it to any different object, if  
it should be found to exist, would be  
matter of fcrious regret.  
The second expedient would, in the  
judgment of the Secretary, be prefera­  
ble to the firft.  
For this the following reason, if there  
were no other, is presumed to be con­  
clusive :—namely, that the probable in­  
crease of the value of the flock may it­  
felf be estimated as a considerable, if  
not a fufficient fund, for the repayment  
of the sum which might be borrowed.  
If the measure of a loan should be  
thought eligible, it is submitted as most  
adviieable to accompany it with a pro­  
vision, fufficient not only to pay the in­  
terest, but to discharge the principal

within a short period. This will, a:  
least, mitigate the inconvenience of ma­  
king an addition to the public debt.  
But the result of&quot; mature reflefition is,  
in the mind of the Secretary, a strong  
&quot;onviftion, that the lad of the three ex­  
pedients, which have been mentioned,  
is to be preferred to either of the other  
two.  
Nothing can more interest the nati­  
onal credit and prosperity, than a con­  
stant and systematic attention to hus­  
band all the means previously potTeffed  
for cxtinguifhing the present debt, and  
to avoid, as much as pofiible, the in­  
curring of any new debt.  
Necessity alone therefore can juftify  
the application of anv of the public  
property, other than the annual reve­  
nues, to the current service, or the  
xmporary and casual exigences or the  
:ountry—or the contra&amp;ing of an ad­  
ditional debt, by loans, to provide for  
hose exigences.  
Great emergencies indeed might exist  
n which loans would be indifpenfible.  
3ut the occasions which will juftify  
hem mull be truly of that description.  
The present is not of luch a nature.  
The sum to be provided is not of mag­  
nitude enough to furnifli the plea of  
necessity.  
Taxes are never welcome to a com­  
munity. They feldoin fail to excite  
uneasy sensations more or less extensive;  
hence a too strong propensity, in the  
governments of nations, to anticipate  
and mortgage the resources of posterity,  
rather than encounter the inconvcni­  
ences of a present increase of taxes.  
But this polity, when not di&amp;ated  
by very peculiar circumstances, is of  
rtrtr worst kxnd. Its obvious tendency  
is, by enhancing the permanent bur­  
dens of the people, to produce lasting  
distress, and its natural issue is in nati­  
onal bankruptcy.  
It will be happy, if the councils of  
this country, fanitioned by the voice of  
an enlightened community, shall be a­  
ble to pursue a different course.  
Yielding to this impression, the Se­  
cretary proceeds to state for the consid­  
eration of the House the objects, which  
have occurred to him as moll proper to  
be refortcd to, for railing the requi&#x27;ite  
sum by taxes.  
From the mod careful view, which  
he is able to take of all the circum­  
stances, that at the present juncture na­  
turally enter into confederation, he is  
led to conclude, that the most eligible  
mode, in which the ncceffary provision  
can at this time be made, is by some ad­  
ditional duties on imported articles.  
This conclusion is made with reluc­  
tance, for reasons which were noticed  
upon a former occalion, and from the  
reflection, that frequent and unexpected  
alterations in the rates of duties, on the  
objects of trade, by inducing uncertain­  
ty in mercantile speculations and calcu­  
lations, are really injurious to com­  
merce and hurtful to the interests of  
those who carry it on.  
The stability of the duties to be paid  
by the merchants, is in faftof more con­  
sequence to them than their quantum ;  
if within reasonable bounds.  
It were therefore much to have been  
wished, that so early a resort to new de­  
mands on that class of citizens could  
have been avoided, and especially that  
they could have been deferred, until a  
general tariff could have been mature­  
ly digested, upon principles which  
might, with propriety render it ellenti­  
ally stationary.  
But while there arc these motives to  
regret, there are others of a consoling  
tendency ; some of which indicate, that  
an augmentation of duties, at the pre­  
sent jun&amp;ure, may have the effect of  
lessening some public evils, arid produc­  
ing some public benefits.  
It is a pleasing fact, if the informa­  
tion of the Secretary be not very erro­  
neous—that the improved state of the  
  
credit oT this country enables our mer­  
chants to procure the supplies, which  
thty import from abroad, upon much  
mere cheap, and advantageous terms  
thrn heretofore ; a eircumftance which  
mwl alleviate to them the pressure of  
so ewhat higher rates i f duty ; and  
mi. contribute at the -fame time to re­  
cc ;i!e them to burthens, which being  
coi.rie&amp;ed with an efficacious difr&#x27;i; i   
of&#x27;she duty-os the government, are ci  
a nature to give solidity and permanen­  
cy to the advantages they enjoy undei  
it.  
It is certain, also, that a spirit of ma­  
nrfaEluring prevails at this time, in e  
greater degree, than it has done at an)  
antecedent period: and as far as an in  
crejfc of duties {hall tend to second aric  
aid this spirit, they will serve to pro  
mi :e elfentially the induftr-y, the  
Wu .ith, the strength, the independence  
and the fubflantial prosperity of the  
country.  
The returns for a year, ending with  
tht. 30th of September last, an abftra£l  
of which is in preparation to be com­  
municated to the Legillature, evince :  
incrqafed importation, during thai  
year, greater far than can be rcterrec  
to &gt; naturally increafmg demand, frorr  
Lhl? progress of population, and an  
nouncc a probability of a more thar  
proportional increase of consumption  
tl&#x27;ere being 110 appearance of an extra  
ordinary abundance of goods in th&lt;  
m rket. If happily an extension of th(  
di ties shall operate as a restraint upon  
exccffive consumption, it will be a la  
In ai-y mean of preserving the commu  
n; y from future embarraffinent, publi&lt;  
ai 1 private.&quot; Bits if this fhoulel not be  
ifc, Caic, 1 l is at prudcr.t in go  
vernment, to extract from it the refour  
ces necelfary for current exigences, ra  
ther than poftponc the burthen to a pe  
tiod, when that very circumflance ma)  
cause it to be more grievously felt.  
These different considerations unite  
with others, which will fuggefl them  
selves, to induce, in the prelcnt state o  
things, a preference of taxes on import  
ed articles to any other mode of raisins  
the sum required.  
It is therefore refpcftfully submitted  
That the exifling duties on the arti

proportion to quantity f&gt;f different kinds of fait,  
a bushel weighing from about 56 to upwa: ds of 80  
wt. It would have an equalizing effeCt if the  
bufliel were defined by weight ; and if 56 pounds  
were taken as the danaard, a valuable acceflion  
to the revenue would refulr.  
This regulation is therefore submitted as a re­  
fourcc upon the present occasion. The rate ol  
duty to remain as it is.  
It will be a reasonable accommodation to trade,  
if it is made-a p.irt of this arrangement, to ex­  
tend the credit for the duty on fait to a longej  
term. It is an article which from the circum­  
itances of its importation, frequently lies on hand  
for a confider&#x27;able time j and in relation to the  
fisheries, is usually lold upon a credit of fevcra  
months.  
Some remarks may be proper in regard to tht  
proposed duties.  
Those on spirits and wines may appear high,  
They are doubtless considerable. But there ait  
precedents ellewhereof much higher duties on th«  
fame articles. And it is ceitainly in every view  
judifiable to make a free use of them for the pur­  
poles of revenue.  
Wines, generally speaking, are the luxury 0!  
clafles of the community who can aft&#x27;ord to pay 1  
conliderable duty upon them.  
It has appeared advifeable to adhere to the ides  
of a fpecific duty per quantity on all the specie:  
of wines in most common conlumption in th&lt;  
country, and those mod susceptible of precift  
designation, as affording greated certainty to the  
revenue.-—And to adopc a general ad valorem rate  
for other kinds, proportioned to the fpecific dutie;  
—This rate is 40 per cent.  
The didinCtion has proceeded from the difficul­  
ty of a precise enumeration of all rhe other kind:  
of wine, which are and may be imported, and 0  
such an adjustment of fpecific rates, as will bca;  
some reasonable proportion to the value of the ar  
tide.— The present lowed rate of duty on wine  
amounts to 200 and 300 per cent, on the valu&lt;  
of certain kinds ; which may be considered a  
equivalent to a prohibition.  
While therefore ideas of proportion will be bet  
ter consulted than heretofore, by the proposed ar  
rangement, it is probable, that the revenue wil  
be benefited, rather than injured, by a reduCtioi  
of the duties on low priced wines.  
The coniiderations which render ardent spirit  
a proper object of high duties, have been repeat  
ediy dwelt upon.—lt may be added, that it is ;  
familiar and a jud remark, that the peculiarly lov  
price of ardent spirits in this country is a grea  
source of intemperance.  
To bring the price of the article more nearl  
to a level with the price of it in other market  
by an increase of duty, while it will contribute t&lt;  
the advancement of the revenue, cannot but prov&lt;  
in other respeCts a public benefit. The rates pro  
posed will be dill moderate compared with exam­  
ples in other countries j and the article is of 2  
nature to enable the importer, without difficulty  
to transfer the duty to the consumer.  
A discrimination is fuggeded in respeCt to dutie:  
on/pints didilled from grain. To this, there have  
been two inducements—One, that the   
3n the duty is conformable to the difference be­  
tween the cod c*f the grain spirits usually impor  
ted, and that of Wed-lndia rum.—Another, tha  
it is in a particular manner the intered of thi  
United States to favor the didillation of its owi  
grain, in competition with foreign spirits fron  
the fame material.—ln the second division of spi­  
rits, the fird class of proof is dropped, because none  
of it comes from the Wed-lndies 5 and because  
any other spirits usually imported, which may be  
of so low a proof are higher priced, even than fomc  
of the higher proofs of Wed-lndia spirits.—The  
dropping of that class of proof therefore in thi:  
cafe is favorable to the revenue, and favorable tc  
equality.  
Several of the other fpecific duties which an  
proposed, befidcs the inducements to them as item;  
of revenue, are drongly recommended by confeder­  
ations which have been dated in the report of the  
Secretary on the subject of manufactures. The  
fame report dates inducements to a 15 per cent,  
duty on some of the articles, which are mentioned}  
as proper to be comprized under that rate.  
With regard to China and Glals, there are two  
weighty reasons for a comparatively high duty up -  
on them. The use of them is very limited, ex­  
cept by the wealthier classes. And both their buik  
and liability to damage in Cranfpoication are great  
securities againd evasions of the revenue. It will  
however merit confederation, whether, for the ac­  
commodation of importers, a longer term of cre­  
dit ought not to be allowed on these articles.  
A duty of two cents per pound on cocoa is less  
In proportion to value, than the present duty on  
coffee.—As an extensive article of consumption,  
it is a productive one of revenue.  
The duty on playing cards can give rife to no  
cjuedion except as to the practicability of a fate  
colledion. In order to this it will be proper to  
iuperadd certain precautions, which will readily  
occur in regulating the details of a &quot;bill for the pur­  
pose.—A similar attention will be requisite in re­  
gard to the duties on wines. The employment of  
marks and certificates may advantageously be ex­  
tended to this article.  
The rate of ten per centum ad valorem it is ho­  
ped will not be deemed immoderate in relatioa to  
the articles to which it is proposed to apply it.—  
It is difficult to assign rules for what ought to be  
considered as a jud dandard.—-But after the bed  
consideration, which the Secretary has been able  
to bedow upon it, he cannot discover, that any  
real inconvenience is likely permanently to result  
from the extension of that rate to the cases propo­  
- fed.  
The addition of 2 1-2 per cent to the duty on  
the mass of articles now rated at 5, will conditute  
2n important, though not an excelfive augmenta­  
tion.— Nevertheless, it is proposed, that it shall be  
only temporary—and there is reasonable ground of  
expectation, that the cause for having recouife to  
it will not be of very long continuance.  
It will not have escaped the observation of the  
House, that the duties which were fuggefled in  
the Secretary&#x27;s report, on that subjeCt, as encou­  
ragements to manufactures, are for the mod part  
included among the ©bjeCts of this report.  
  
It may tend to avoid future embarraflment, if  
such abolitions and drawbacks, as /hall be deem  
:d expedient, with a view to promoting manufac­  
tures, (hall accompany the establishment and ap­  
!*ropriation of whatever further duties may be laid,  
for the object in contemplation.  
And it may be found convenient to qualify the  
Impropriation of the surplus which is to be appli­  
id to thac obje&amp;, so as to let in such other appro­  
bations during the feflion as occurrences may  
uggeft.  
An estimate of the additional revenue which  
nay be expe&amp;ed from the proposed duties is fub­  
oincd.  
It will occur to the House, that the credit sl­  
owed for the dutits will require an anticipation of  
heir product by a temporary loan, for which pro­  
/ilion in the law will be requj/ite.  
All lohlch is humbly submitted*

A NATIONAL PAPER, PUhLISHt D WEDNESDAYS AND SATURDAYS BY JOHN FENNO, No. 69, HIGH-STREET, PHILADELPHI A  
  
[No. 96, of Vol. lII.]  
  
XEAD IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE 17th INST  
  
Treasury Department, March 16, 1792.  
THE Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to a Resolution of the House  
0/ Reprefevtativcs 0/the Sth injlaut, directing the fiid Secretary to  
report to the Houft his opinion of the bejl mode oj raising the additi­  
onal Supplier requijittfor the ensuing year, rejpetfjully submits the  
following  
REPORT  
THE sum which is estimated to be nectflarv for carrying into  
/•ffeft the purposes of the ast for making further and more ef­  
fectual provision for the prote&amp;ion of the frontiers of the United  
States, beyond the provision made by the ast making appropriati­  
ons lor the support of government for the year 179 a, is  
Dols. 675.950 8  
  
The returns which have been received at the treasury subsequent  
to the Secretary&#x27;s report of the 23d of Januaty last, among which  
are those of some principal ports, afford faiisfa£lory ground of as­  
surance, that the quarter ending the last. of December wa* consider­  
ably more preduftive than it was supposed likely to prove ; au­  
thorizing a reliance that the revenues to the end of the year 179:,  
will yield a furplusof 150,000 dollar*—which may be applied in  
part of the film of 675,95° dollars and 8 cents, above Hated to be  
weceffary.  
Provision remains to be made for the residue. of this sum,  
525»95° dollars and 8 cents.  
  
Thiec expedients occur to the option of the government for  
providing this sum.  
One, to dispose of the interest, to which the United States are  
entitled in the bank of the United States. This, at the preient  
market price of bank stock, would yield a clear gain to the govern­  
ment much more than adequate to the sum required.  
Another, to borrow the money, upon an eitabiiflimcnt of fund?,  
fither merely commensurate ith the intcrtft to be paid, or af­  
fording a surplus which will discharge the principal by iDllalnqcQU  
vi hin a short term.  
  
The third is, to laife the amount by taxes.  
Thefirltof these three expedients appears to the Secretary alto­  
gether unadvifeable.  
  
fiift—lt is his pi efent opinion, that it will be found, in various  
refpefls, permanently the intereil of the United States to retain  
tfhe interest to which ihey are entiiled in the bank. But,  
Secondly—lf this opinion should not be well founded, it will  
~hc improvident to dispose of it at the present jimflure, since upon  
a comprchcnfive View ofthe fubjeft, it can hardly admit of a doubt,  
that its future value, at a period not very distant, will be consider­  
ably greater than its present—While the government will enjoy  
the benefit of whatever dividends (hall bedeclaied in the interval.  
  
And, Thirdly—Whether it shall be deemed proper lo retain  
w difpole of this interest, the moO ufeful application of the pro­  
teedswill he as a fund for extinguishing the public debt. A ne­  
ceflity of applying it to any different objed, if it Ihuuki be lound  
to exist. would be matter of fertous regret.  
The second expedient would, in the judgment of the Secretary,  
&quot;be preferable to thefirft.  
  
For this the following reason, if there were no other, is pre­  
sumed to be concJufive—namely, That the probable incieafe of  
the value of the flock may itfelf be cftimated as a considerable, if  
not a fufficient fund, for the repayment of the sum which might  
be borrowed.  
  
If the measure of a loan should be thought eligible, it is fubmiu  
ted as mod advifeable to accompany it with a provision, fufficient  
i\ot only to pay the interest, but todifcharge the principal with­  
in a short period. This will, at lcaif, mitigate the inconvenience  
of thaking an addition to the public debt.  
But the result of mature reflation is, in the mind of the Secre­  
tary, a strong convi&amp;ioo, that the last of the three expedients,  
which hn*e been mentioned, is to be preferred to either of the  
«ther two.  
  
Nothing can more interest the national credit and prosperity,  
than a constant and systematic attention lo husband ail the means  
previously poffefled for extinguilhing the present debt, and to a­  
void. as much as pofUble, the incurring of any new debt.  
Ncccflity alone therefore can juftify the application of any of  
the public property, other than the annual revenues, to the cur­  
*ent service, or the temporary and casual exigencies of the coun-  
the contraftmg of an additional debt, by loans, to provide  
for those exigencies.  
  
Great emergencies indeed might exist, in which loans would  
indifpenfible. But the occasions which will juftify them mud  
be truly of that description.  
The present is not of such a nature. The sum to be provided  
is not of magnitude enough to furnifh the plea of nectflhy,  
Taxes are never welcome to a community. The/ seldom fail  
to excite uneasy sensations more or left extensive. Hence a too  
strong propensity, in the governments of nations, to anticipate and  
mortgage the resources of posterity. rather than encounter the in­  
conveniences of a present increase of taxes.  
But this policy, when not di&amp;ated by very peculiar circum-  
Aances, is of the worst kind. Its obvious tendency is, by enhanc­  
ing the permanent burthens of the people, to produce lading dif­  
trels, and its aatural iflue is in national bankruptcy.  
It will he happy, if the councils of this country, fan£lioned by  
the voice of an enlightened community, (hall be able to putfue a  
different course.  
  
Yielding to this impreflion, th« Secretary proceeds to state for  
the consideration of the House, the obje&amp;s which have occurred  
to biro as most proper to be retorted to, lor raising the requisite  
sum by taxes.  
  
From the most careful view which he is able to take of all the  
c&#x27;rcumftancc*, that at the present juncture naturally enter into con­  
sideration, he is led to conclude, that the moil eligible mode, in  
&quot;which the neceflary proVision can at this time be made, is by some  
add:tional duties on impoited articics.  
This conclusion is made with relu&amp;ance, for reasons which  
noticed upon a former occasion, and from the refle&amp;ton, that  
frequent and unexpc&amp;cd alterations in the rates of duties, on the  
objects of trade, by inducing uncertainty in mercantile speculati­  
ons and calculations, are really injurious lo commerce and hurtful  
to the interrftsof those who carry it on.  
The (lability of the duties to be paid by the merchants is in  
of more confequencc to them than their quantum ; if within rea­  
sonable bounds.  
  
It were therefore much to have been wished, that so early a re­  
sort to new demands on that class of citizens could have been a­  
•voided, and cfpeciallv that they could have been dcicrred until a  
  
Wednesday, March 28, 1792.  
  
genera] tariff could have been maturely digtfted, upon principles,  
which might with propriety render it cflVntially stationary.  
But while there are these m©tivts to rcgiet, there aie others of  
a consoling tendency, some of which indicate, ihat ?n augmenta­  
tion of duties, at the present juncture, may have theeffift of lef­  
fcning some public evil*, and producing fone public benefits.  
Ii is a pleafinp; fitft, if the information of the Secretary be not  
veiy erroneous, that the improved state of the credit of this coun­  
try enables our merchants to procure the supplies which they im­  
port from abroad upon much more cheap and advantageous terms  
than heretofore, a circumstance which rauft alleviate to them the  
prefTure of somewhat higher rates of duty, and mud contribute, at  
the fametimc, to reconcile them to burthens, which being con­  
n&lt;ftcd with an efficacious discharge of the duty of government,  
are of a nature to give solidity and permanency to the advantage  
they enjoy under it.  
  
It is certain also, that a spirit of manufa&amp;uring prevails at this  
time in a greater degree, than it has done at any antecedent period,  
and as far as an encreafe of duties (hall tend to Second and aid this  
Spirit, they will Serve to promote essentially the indullry, the  
wealth, theftrtngth, the independence and the Substantial prospe­  
rity of the country.  
  
The returns for one year, ending the thirtieth of September  
last, an abftraft of which is in preparation to be communicated to  
the legislature, evince a much incrcafcd importation, during lhat  
year, greater far than can be referred to a naturally increaSing de­  
mand from the progtels of population, and announce a probabi­  
lity of a more than a proportional increase of consumption ; there  
being no appearance of an txtiaordinaiy abundance of goods in  
the maiktt. If happily an extenSion of the duties Shall operate a&amp;  
a reilraint upon efcccflive consumption, it will be a falutarv mean  
of preServmg the community from fntore cmbariafTment, public  
and private. But if this fbould not be the caSe, it is at leafi pru­  
dtnt in the government, to extract Siom it the reSources neceflary  
Sor current exigencies, rttherthan postpone the burthen to a peri­  
od, when that very circumilance may cause it to be more grievouS­  
ly felt.  
  
Tbefe different considerations unite with others which will Sug­  
gest themfj&#x27;lves to induce, in the preSent state of things, a prefer­  
ence of taxes oq imported articles, to any other mode ol railing  
the Sum required.  
It istherefone reSpe&amp;Sully Submitted—  
  
That the existing duties on the aiticles hereafter enumerated, be  
repealed, and that in place oS them the following be laid, viz.

An addition of two and half per cent, ad valorem, to be made  
to the duty on all goods heretofore rated at 5 ptr centum ad va­  
lorem.  
  
This addition 10 be temporary, and accordingly to be so efta­  
bliflied as that i: (hall not continue longei, than till the present  
Indian war shall terminally and the expences of carrying it on  
shall have been defiayed, which will of course include the reim­  
bursement of any (unu, that may have been borrowed by way of  
anticipation of the product of the duties.  
  
It is represented that the present duty on fait operates unequally  
from the considerable difference in weight in proportion co quan­  
tity of difte ent kinds of fait ; a bushel veig.ing from about $$  
to upwards of 80 weight. It would have an equalizing effect if  
the bulhel \*ere dt fined by weight; and ii 56 pounds were taken  
the flaudard, a valuable acccflion to the icvenue would tefult.  
  
1 his regulation is therefoic Submitted as a resource upon the  
present occasion. The rate of duty to remain as it is.  
It will be a reafojnabie accommodation to trade, if it is made a  
part of this arrangement, to extend the credit lor the duty on fait,  
to a longer term. It is an article, which from the circumflances  
of its importation, frequently lies on hand for a confid. raoie  
lime ; and in relation to the fineries is usually fold upon a cre­  
dit of several months.  
  
Some remarks may be proper in regard to the proposed duties;  
Those on spirits and wines may appear high. They artdpubt­  
lefs confidcrablt—-But there are precedents cltcwhere of much  
higiicr duties on the fame articles. And it isceitainly in every  
view juftifiable to make a free use of them for the purposes of re-  
  
venue.  
  
\Vtnes, generally Speaking, are the luxury of claffcs of the com­  
munity who can afford to pay a ccnfidciable duty upon them.  
It has appeared adviSeable to adhere to the idea of a Specific du~  
ty. per quantity on 411 the fpeciea of wines in mott common coi -  
lumption in the country, and those molt susceptible of prccife de­  
signation ; as affording the greatcft certaintx to the revenue. And to  
adopt a general ad valorem rate for other kinds, proportioned to  
the Specific duties. This rate is 40 per cent.  
This diftin&amp;ion has proceeded from the difficulty of a piecifc  
enumeration of ail the other k.nds of wine, which are and may  
be imported, and of fuchan adjustment of fpecific rates, as wiil  
bear some reasonable proportion to the value of the article. The  
present lowest iaie of duty on wines amounts to 200 and 300 per  
cent, on the value of certain kinds ; which may be confidercd as  
equivalent to a prohibition.  
While therefore ideas of proportion will be better consulted  
than heretofore, by the proposed arrangement, it is probable, that  
theievcnue will be benefited, rather than injured, by a redutlioa  
of the duties on low priced wines.  
Theconfideranons which render ardent spirits a proper obj 51  
of hifch duties, have been repeatedly dwelt upon. It may be ad­  
ded, that it is a familiar and a just remark, that the peculiarly  
low price of ardent spirits in this country is a great source of in­  
temperance.  
To bring the price of tbe article more nearly to a level with the  
price of it in other markets by an increase of duty, while it will  
contribute to the advancement of the revenue, cannot but prove  
in other refpe&amp;s a public benefit.

The tates proposed will be still moderate compared with ex.  
ampUs ill other countries; and the article is of a nature to enable  
the importer,without difficulty,to transfertheduty to the conlumer.  
A difcriminatton is suggested in refpeCi to duties on fpi: us dil­  
tilled from grain. To this there have been two inducements —  
one, that the difference in the duty is conformable to the differ­  
ence between the cost of the grain spirits usually imported, and  
that of Wtit-India rum—another, that it is in a particular manner  
the intcreft ot the United Stales to favor the distillation of its own  
grain, in competition wiih foreign spirits from the fame material.  
In the second division of spirits, the firfl class of proof is drop­  
ped, because none of it comes from the Weft-Indies ; and beca-ufe  
any other spirits usually imported which may be of so low a proof  
are higher priced, even than some of the higher proofs of Weft-  
India spirits. The dropping of that class of pioof therefore   
this cafe is favorable to the revenu: and favorable to equality.  
  
Several of the other fpecific duties which arc proposed, beftdef  
the inducements to them as items of revenue are strongly rccam*  
mended by confederations which have been stated in the report oi  
the Secretary on ihe fubjiCt of manufactures. The fame repoiC  
stares inducements to als per cent, duty on some of the articles*  
which are mentioned, as propei to be comprized under that rate.  
With regard to china and glass, there are two weighty rcafonf  
for a comparat.vely high duty upon them. The use of them is  
very iimitcd except by the wealthier claflfes. And both theif  
bulk and liability to damage in tranfportatiun are great securities  
•gainst evasions of the revenue. It will however merit coufidcr*  
ation, whether for the accommodation of im orters, a longer  
term of credit ought not to be allowed on thele articles.  
A duty of two cents per pound on cocoa is less in proportion  
o Vdlue than the present duty on coffee. As an extensive article  
of consumption, it is a productive one of revenue.  
The duty on playing cards can give rife to no question except  
as to practicability of a fafe collc&amp;ion. In order to this it will be  
proper to super-add certain precautions, which will readily occur  
n regulating the details of a bill for the purpose. A fitnilar at­  
tention will be requisite in regard to the duties on wines. The  
employment of marks and certificates may advantagtoufly b« ex­  
tended to this article.  
  
The rate of 10 per centum ad valorem it is hoped will not be  
deemed immoderate in relation to the articles to which it is pro»  
posed to apply it. It is difficult to rules for what ought 10  
be considered as a just standard. But alter the belt confederation  
which the Secretary has been able to bestow upon it, he caru.oC  
discover, that any real inconvenience is likely peimanently to  
result from the cxtenfion of that rate to the cases proposed.  
  
The addition of per ccnt. to the duiy on the mals ot articles  
now rated at 5, will conflitu e an important, though not au ex­  
seifive augmentation. Nevertheless, it is propofeo, that it (hall  
be only temporaly—and there is reasonable ground of expedi­  
tion, tiiat the cause lor having recourse to it will not be of very  
long continuance.  
  
It will not have efcapcd the observation of the House, that the  
dunes which were fuggelted in the Secretary&#x27;sreport, on that fub­  
jeft, as encouragements to manufactures, are for the moll part in­  
cluded amoug the objecis of this report.

In purfuance of this refolution of the houfe, the fecretary, on the 17th of March,  
reperted his opinion of the beft method of raifing the additional fupplics. ‘The defici.  
ency to be provided for was cftimated at 525,950 dollars; which he propofed to raife  
by additional duties on fundry imported articles. Before he proceeded to an enumer-  
ation of the articles, he ftated the reafons which induced him to prefer this mode of  
raifing the required fum.  
  
“ Three expedients occur to the option of the government for providing this fum,  
——One, to difpofe of the intereft, to which the united ftates are entitled in the hank  
of the united ftates. ‘This, at the prefent market price of bank flock, would yield a  
clear gain to the government, much more than adequate to the fum required. Ane  
ther, to borrow the morey, upon an eftablifhment of funds either merely commenfu-  
rate with the intereft to be paid, or affording a furplus which will difcharge the prin-  
cipal by inftalments within a fhort term. The third is, to raife the amount by taxes.  
  
“ The frfof thefe three expedients appears to the fecretary altogether unadvifeable.  
Frit—It is his prefent opinion, that it will be found, in various refpects, permanently  
the intereft of the united fates to retain the intereft to which they a@e entitled in the  
bank. But, fecondly—lIf this opinion fhould not be well founded, it will! be improvi-  
dent to difpofe of it at the prefent jan@ure, fince upon a comprehenfive view of the  
fubject, it can hardly admit of a doube, that its future value, at a period not very dif-  
tant, will be confiderably greater than its prefent—While the government will enjoy  
the benefit of whatever dividends fhall be declared in the interval, And, thirdly—  
Whether it thall be deemed proper to retain or difpofe of this interch, the moft ufeful  
application of the proceeds will be as a fund for extinguifhing the public debt. A ne-  
ceflity of applying it to any different object, if it fhould be found to exift, would be  
matter of ferious regret.  
  
“ The fecond expedient would, inthe judgment of the fecretary, be preferable  
tothe firft. For this the following reafons, if there were no other, is prefumed tobe  
conclufive—namely, That the probable increafe of the value of the lock may itfelf be  
eflimated as a conbderable, ‘fnot a fufficient fund, for the repayment of the fum which  
might be borrowed, [f the meafure of a loan fhould be thought eligible, it is fubmit-  
ted as moft advifeable to accompany it with a provifion, fufficient not only to pay  
the intereft, but to difcharge the principal within a fhort period. This will, at leaf,  
mitigate the inconvenience of making an cddition to the public debt.  
  
© Brutthe refule of mature reflection is, in the mind of the fecretary, a ftrong convic-  
tien, that the of of the three expedients, which have been mentioned, is to be prefer-  
red to the other two.  
  
“ Nothing can more intcreft the national credit and profperity, thana conflast  
and fyitematic attenticn to kufband all the means we poffefs for extinguihing  
the prefent debt, and to aveid, as much as poflible, the incurring of any new debt.  
Neceffity alone therefore can juftify the application of any of the public property,  
other than the annual revenues, to the currence fervice, or the temporary and cafual

_rencies of the country—or the contracting of an additional debt, by loans, to provide  
jor thofe exigencies. Great emergencies indeed might exift, in which loans would  
be indifpenfidle. But the occafious which will juftify them muft be truly of that de-  
{cription. The prefent is not of fuch a nature. The fum to bé provided is nox of  
magnitude enough to furnith the plea of neceflity.  
  
“Taxes ate never welcome to a community. They feldom fail to excite uneafy fen-  
fations, more or lefs extenfive Hence a too {trong propentity, in the governments of  
nations, to anticipate and mortgage the refources of pofterity, rather than encounter  
the inconveniencies of a prefent increafe of taxes. But this policy, when not di@tated  
by very peculiar circumftances, is of che worft kind. {ts obvious tendency is, by en-  
hancing the permanent burthens of the people, to produce lafting diftrefs, and its na-  
tural ilue isin national bankruptcy. It will be happy, if the councils of this country,  
faaGioned by the voice of an enlightened community, fhall be able to purfue a dil-  
ferent courle.  
  
“ Yielding to this impreflion, the fecretary proceeds to ftate for the confideration of  
the houfe, the objeGls which have occurred to him as molt proper to be reforted to,  
{ur raifing the requifite fum by taxes.  
  
“ From the moitt careful view which he is able t@ take of all the circumftances, that  
at the prefent juncture naturally enter into confideration, he is led to conclude, that  
the molt eligible mode, in which the neceflary provifion can at this time be made, is  
by fome additional duties on imported articles. ‘This conclufion is made with reluc-  
tance, for reafons which were noticed upon a former occafion, and from the refle@ion,  
that frequent and unexpected alterations in the rates of duties, on the objects of trade,  
by inducing uncertainty in mercantile {pecu&#x27;ations and calculations, are really injuri-  
ousto commerce, and hurtful to the interefts of thofe who carry iton. The itability  
of the duties to be paid by the merchants is in fact of more confequence to them than  
their quantum, if within reafonable bounds. It were therefore much to have been  
wihhed, that fo carly a refort to new demands on that clafs of citizens could have been  
avoided, and efpecially that they could have been deferred until a general tariff could  
have been maturely digefted, upon principles, which might, with propriety, render it  
cffential&#x27;y ftationary.  
  
“ But while there are thefe motives to regret, there are others of a confeling ten-  
dency, fome of which indicate, that an augmentation of duties, at the prefent junc-  
ture, may have the effect of leffening fome public evils, and producing fome public  
benefits. a  
  
“ It isa pleafing fac, if the information of the fecretary be not very erroneous, that  
the improved ftate of the credit of thiscountry enables our merchants to procure the  
{upplies which they import from abroad upon much more cheap and advantageous  
terms than heretofore, a circumftance which mutt alleviate to them the preflure of  
fomewhat higher rates of duty, and muft contribute, at the fame time, to reconcile  
them to berthens, which, being conneted with an efficacious difcharge of the duty of  
government, are of a nature to give folidity and permanency tothe advantages they  
enjoy under it. It is certain alfo, that a fpirit of manufacturing prevails at this time  
in a greater degree, than it has done at any antecedent period, and as far as an encreafe  
of duties fhall tend to fecond and aid this fpirit, they wil! ferve to promote effentially  
the induitry, the wealth, the ftrength, the independence, and the fub{tantial profperi-  
ty of the country.  
  
“ The returns for one yéar, ending the thirticth of September laft, evince a much  
increafed importation,during that year, greater far than can be referred te a naturally  
increafing demand from the progrefs of population; and announce a probability of  
4 more than a proportional increafe of confumption; there being no appearance of an  
extraordinary abundance of goods in the market. If, happily, an extenfion of the du-  
tics fhall operate as a reftraint upon exceflive confumption, it will bea falutary mean  
of preferving the community from future embarraffment, public and private. But if  
  
this thould not be the cafe, it is at leaft prudent in the governmert, to extra from it  
  
herefources neceflary for current exigencies, rather than poftpone the burthen to a  
period, when that very circumftance may caufe it to be more grievoufly felt.  
  
_“ The different confiderations unite with others, which will fuggeft themfelves, to  
indace, in the prefent ftate of things, a preference of taxes on imported articles, to any  
other mode of raifing the fam required.”
