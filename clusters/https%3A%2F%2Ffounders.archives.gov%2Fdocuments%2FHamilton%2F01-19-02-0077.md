A very virulent attack has recently been made upon the President of the U States, the present Secretary of the Treasury, and myself as his predecessor in office, on the ground of extra payments to The President on account of his salary. The charges against all the three are no less heinous than those of intentional violation of the constitution, of the laws, and of their oaths of office. I annex the epithet intentional, because though not expressly used in the terms of the attack, it is implied in every line of it; since an involuntary error of construction, if that could even be made out, would not warrant the imputations “of contemning and despising every principle which the people have established for the security of their rights, of setting at defiance all law and authority, and of servile submission and compliance with the lawless will and pleasure of a President.”  
Were considerations personal to myself alone to be consulted the present attempt would be treated with no greater attention than has been shewn to all the anonymous slanders by which I have been so long and so implacably persecuted. But convinced by a course of observation for more than four years that there exists in this country an unprincipled and daring combination, to obstruct by any means, which shall be necessary and can be commanded, not short even of force, the due and efficient administration of the present government, to make our most important national interests subservient to those of a foreign power—and as means to these ends to destroy by calumny and misrepresentation the confidence of the people in the truly virtuous men of our country and to transfer it with the power of the State to ambitious hypochrites, and intriguing demagogues perhaps corrupted partisans perceiving likewise that this infatuated combination in the belief that the well earned esteem and attachment of his fellow Citizens towards the actual chief Magistrate of the UStates is the principal remaining obstacle to the execution of their plan are making the most systematic efforts to extinguish those sentiments in the breasts of the people—I think it a duty to depart from my general rule of Conduct and to submit to the public with my name an explanation of the principles which have governed the Treasury Department on the point in question.  
I shall state in the first place, that the rule with regard to expenditures and appropriations, which has uniformly regulated the practice of the Department is this (viz) to issue no money from the Treasury but for an object, for which there was a law previously passed, making an appropriation and designating the fund from which the money was to arise. But there being such a law and an adequate fund to support the expenditure, it was deemed justifiable as well before as after the service was performed or the supply obtained, for which the appropriation was designed, to make disbursements from the Treasury for the object, if it appeared safe and expedient so to do. If made before, it was an advance or anticipation for which the party was charged and held accountable till exonerated by the performance of the service or the furnishing of the supply. If afterwards, it was a payment and went to some general head of Account as such.  
Thus, if a sum was appropriated for provisions for the army for a particular year it was common to make advances on account to the contractors long before the supplies were furnished. If the law was passed in one year for the next, there would be no hesitation to make the advance immediately after the passing of the law and before the year to which the appropriation was applicable had commenced. So also sums would be furnished to the Department of War in anticipation of the monthly pay of the officers and soldiers, and advances on account of pay in particular circumstances and for good reasons would be actually made by that Department to the officers and soldiers. And so likewise advances have been made for the use of the President and of the members [of] both houses of Congress in anticipation of their respective compensations.  
  
It will without difficulty be comprehended that the practice of the Treasury has in some cases been essential to the due course of the public service.  
Every good judge will be sensible that from the insufficiency of individual capitals to such large advances as the supplies of an army require, it was indispensable to the obtaining of them that anticipations from the Treasury should enable the contractors to do what otherwise they would have been unable to do—and that these anticipations must also have had the effect of procuring the supplies on cheaper terms to the U States.  
When it is considered too that the army has operated for several years past at [five or six] hundred miles distance from the seat of Government and a considerable part of the year from the rudeness of the country &amp; obstructions of the Waters, it is impracticable to transmit monies to the scenes of payment—it will be perceived that without advances from the Treasury in anticipation of their pay, not only a compliance with the engagements of the Government would have been impossible—but the troops must have been always left most unreasonably in arrear. In June 1794 Congress passed a law declaring that the army should in future be paid in such manner as that the arrears should not exceed two months. Compliance with this regulation renders anticipations at certain seasons a matter of physical necessity; yet that law gave no special authority for the purpose.  
A particular case, by way of example in which, distinct from general rules, advances or anticipations in the war department are necessary respects the recruiting service. The officers who are for a long time distant from their corps require the accommodation of an advance of pay to be able to discharge their duty. Towards the possibility of enlisting men, it is indispensable they should carry with them the bounty money and this upon conjecture of what may be done and with the possibility that from not being able to obtain the men the ultimate expenditure may not take place. This instance will suggest to reflection an infinite number of cases in the course of the public service in which a disbursement from the Treasury must precede the execution of the object and may exceed the sum finally requisite for it.  
These cases indicate the expediency, and even necessity of the construction which has regulated the practice of the Treasury. And it might be shewn if necessary that it is analogous to the practice under the former Government of the UStates and under other governments; and this too where the theory of expenditure equally is, as expressed in our Constitution, that no money shall be expended but in consequence of an appropriation by law.  
It remains to see whether this rule of conduct so indispensable in the practice of the department be permitted by a fair interpretation of the constitution and the laws.  
The general injunction of the Constitution (Article I § IX) is that “no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.”  
That clause appears to me to be exactly equivalent to this other clause—“No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but for which there is an appropriation made by law.” In other words before money can legally issue from the Treasury for any purpose, there must be a law authorising an expenditure and designating the object and the fund. This being done the disbursement may be made consistently with the constitution either by way of advance or anticipation or by way of payment. It may precede or follow the service supply or other object of expenditure. Either will equally satisfy the words “in consequence of” which are not words of strict import, but may be taken in several senses—In one sense, that is “in consequence of” a thing, which, being bottomed upon it, follows it in order of time. A disbu[r]sement must be either an advance or anticipation or a payment. Tis not presumeable that the constitution meant to distinguish between these two modes of disbursement. It must have intended to leave this matter wholly to convenience.  
The design of the constitution in this provision was as I conceive to secure these important ends—that the purpose the limit and the fund of every expenditure should be ascertained by a previous law. The public security is complete in this particular if no money can be expended but for an object, to an extent, and out of a fund, which the laws have prescribed.  
Even in cases which affect only individual interests, if the terms of a law will bear several meanings that is to be preferred which will best accord with convenience. In cases that concern the public this rule is applicable with still greater latitude. Public convenience is to be promoted, public inconvenience to be avoided. The business of administration requires accommodation to so great a variety of circumstances, that a rigid construction would in countless instances arrest the wheels of Government. It has been shewn that the construction which has been adopted at the Treasury is in many cases essential in practice. This inclines the scale in favour of it—the words “in consequence of” admitting of various significations.  
The practice of the legislature as to appropriation laws favours this construction.  
These laws are generally distinct from those which create the cause of expenditure. Thus the act which declares that the President shall be allowed twenty five thousand dollars ⅌ annum, that which declares that each senator and representative shall be intitled to so much per day, that which determines that each officer and soldier shall have so much per Month &amp;c. neither of these acts is an act of appropriation. The Treasury has not conceived itself authorised to expend a single cent upon the basis of any such act; regarding it merely as constituting a claim upon the Government for a certain compensation, but requiring prior to an actual disbu[r]sement for such claim, that a law be passed authorising the disbursement out of a specified fund. This is what is considered as the law by which the appropriation is made; from which results to the Public a double security.  
Hence every year a particular act (sometimes more than one) is passed appropriating certain sums for the various branches of the public service, and indicating the funds from which the monies are to be drawn. The object, the sum and the fund are all that are to be found in these acts. They are commonly, if not universally, silent as to any thing further.  
This I regard as constructive of the clause in the constitution. The appropriation laws are in execution of that provision and fulfil all its purposes. And they are silent as to the distinction between anticipation &amp; payment, in other words, as to the manner of disbursement.  
Hence I conclude that if there exist a law appropriating a certain sum for the salary of the President, an advance upon that sum in anticipation of the service, is as constitutional as a payment after the service has been performed; in other words, that the advance of a quarters salary at the beginning of a quarter is as much warranted by the constitution as the payment of it at the end of a quarter.  
It is in the sense, that the present Secretary of the Treasury has affirmed that “not one Dollar has at any time been advanced for the use of The President for which there was not an existing appropriation.” He did not mean to say, that no money had been advanced in anticipation of the service; for the fact is otherwise, but nothing is more true than that the sums disbursed were within the limits of the sums appropriated. If there was an excess at the end of one year, there had been a previous appropriation for a succeeding year, upon which that excess was an advance.  
It is objected to this practice, that the death of the party between the advance to him and the expiration of an equivalent term of service, by superseding the object of the advance, would render it a misexpenditure of so much money and therefore a violation of the constitution.  
I answer that the same casualty might have the same effect in other cases, in which it would be against common sense to suppose that an advance might not be made with legality and propriety.  
Suppose for example a law was to be passed directing a given quantity of powder to be purchased for public use, and appropriating a definite sum for the purchase, and suppose intelligence brought to the secretary of the Treasury that the quantity required could be procured for prompt payment at Boston. It cannot in such case be doubted that the sum appropriated might legally be advanced to an Agent to proceed to Boston to make the purchase. Yet that Agent might die, and the money never be applied according to its destination, or the desired quantity might be procured for a less sum, and a ballance remain in his hands. In either case, there would be money disbursed which was not actually applied to the object of the law—in the last case there is no final object for the disbursement because the ballance is a surplus. This proves that the possibility of a failure or falling short of the object for which an advance is made is not an objection to its legality. Indeed the consequence is a possible one in every case of an anticipation, whether to contractors or to other public agents, for a determinate or an indeterminate purpose.  
The only consequence is that the sum unapplied must be accounted for and refunded. The distinction here again is between an advance and a payment. More cannot certainly be finally paid than is equal to the object of an appropriation, though the sum appropriated exceed the sum necessary. But more may be advanced, to the full extent of the appropriation, than may be ultimately exhausted by the object of the expenditure, on the condition which always attends an advance of accounting for the application &amp; refunding an excess. This is a direct answer to the question whether more can be paid than is necessary to satisfy the object of an appropriation. More cannot be paid, but more may be advanced, on the accountability of the person to whom it is advanced.  
But risk of loss to the public may attend this principle? This is true, but it [is] as true in all the cases of advances to Contractors &amp;c. as in those of advances upon salaries and compensations—nor does this point of risk affect the question of legality—it to touches merely that of a prudent exercise of discretion. When large sums are advanced it is usual to obtain security for their due application or for indemnification. This security is greater or less according to the circumstances of the parties to whom the advances are made. When small sums are advanced, especially if for purposes quickly fulfilled, and to persons who are themselves adequate sureties, no collateral security is demanded. The head of the department is responsible to the Government for observing proper measure and taking proper precautions. If he acts so as to incur justly the charge of improvidence or profusion he may be dismissed or punished according to the nature of his misconduct.  
But the principle which is set up would, it is said, be productive of confusion distress and bankruptcy at the Treasury, since the appropriation for the support of Government is made payable out of the accruing duties of each year, and an established right in the officers of Government to claim their compensations, which amount to several hundred thousand dollars per annum, either on the first day of the year, or on the first day of a quarter before the services were rendered, would create a demand at a time when there might not and possibly would not be a single shilling in the Treasury arising out of that appropriation to satisfy it.  
  
These ideas with regard to the administration of the fund appropriated are very crude &amp; incorrect—but it would complicate the subject to go into the developpemts.  
  
  
It is not pretended, that there is an established right in the Officers to claim their salaries, by anticipation, at the beginning of a year or at the beginning of a quarter—no such right exists. The performance of the service must precede the right to demand payment. But it does not follow that because there is no right in the officer to demand payment, it may not be allowable for the Treasury to advance upon account for good reasons. A discretion of this sort in the head of the department can at least involve no embarrassment to the Treasury, of the formidable evils indicated; for the officer who makes the advance being himself the judge whether there is a competent fund and whether it can be made with convenience to the Treasury he will only make it when he perceives that no evil will ensue.  
Let me recur to the example of advances to contractors for supplying the army. Suppose that in the terms of contract certain advances were stipulated and made; but it turned out nevertheless that the contractor disappointed in the funds on which he had relied could not execute his contract without further advances. Here there would be no right on his part to demand such further advances; but there would be a discretion in the Treasury to make them. This is an example of a discretion to do what there is not a right to demand. The existence of this discretion can do no harm, because the head of the Treasury will judge whether the state of it permits the required advances. But It is essential that the discretion should exist, because otherwise there might be a failure of supplies which no plan that could be substituted might be able to avert.  
Yet the discretion is in neither case an arbitrary one. It is one which the head of the department is responsible to exercise with a careful eye to the public interest and safety. The abuse of it, in other words, the careless or wanton exercise of it, would be a cause of dismission for incapacity or of punishment for malconduct.  
Thus advances on account of salaries or to Contractors for procuring public supplies might be carried so far and so improvidently managed as to be highly culpable and justly punishable; but this is a distinct question from the violation of constitution or law.  
In all the cases, it is a complete answer to the objection of embarrassment to the Treasury, that not the will of the parties but the judgment of the head of the department is the rule and measure of the advances which he may make within the bounds of the sums appropriated by law.  
I consider the law which has been cited with regard to the pay of the army as a legislative recognition of the rule of practice at the Treasury. The legislature could not have been ignorant that it was impracticable at certain seasons of the year to convey the money to the army to fulfil their injunction, without an advance from the Treasury before the pay became due. They presuppose a right to make this advance and enjoin that the Troops shall not be left more than two months in the year. The origin of this law enforces the observation. It is known that it passed in consequence of representations that the pay of the army was left too long in arrear, and it was intended to quicken the measures of payment. No person in either house of the legislature, I believe, doubted that there was power to precede the service by advances so as to render the payment even more punctual than was enjoined.  
Indeed such advances when the army operated at a distance were necessary to fulfil the contract with the army. Its pay became due monthly, and in strictness of contract was to be made at the end of each month; a thing impossible unless advanced from the Treasury before it became due. No special authority was ever given for this purpose to the Treasury, but it appears to have been left to take its course on the principle, that the disbursement might take place as soon as there was an appropriation, though in anticipation of the term of service.  
The foregoing observations vindicate, I trust, the construction of the Treasury as to the power of making disbursements in anticipation of services and supplies, if there has been a previous appropriation by law for the object, and if the advances never exceed the amount appropriated; and at the same time evince that this practice involves no violation of the constit[ut]ional provision with respect to appropriations.  
I proceed to examine that clause which respects the pay of the President. It is in these words—“The President shall at stated times receive for his services a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished, during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the UStates or any of them.”  
I understand this clause as equivalent to the following—“There shall be established by law for the services of the President a periodical compensation, which shall not be increased nor dim[in]ished during the term for which he shall have been elected, and neither the U States nor any state shall allow him any emolument in addition to his periodical compensation.”  
This will I think, at first sight, appear foreign to the question of a provisional advance by the Treasury on account of the compensation periodically established by Law for his services.  
The manifest object of the provision is to guard the independence of the President from the legislative controul of the UStates or of any state, by the ability to withold lessen or increase his compensation.  
It requires that the law shall assign him a definite compensation for a definite time. It prohibits the legislature from increasing or dim[in]ishing this compensation during any term of his election, and it prohibits every state from granting him an additional emolument. This is all that the clause imports.  
It is therefore satisfied, as to the U States, when the legislature has provided that the President shall be allowed a certain sum for a certain term of time and so long as it refrains from making an alteration in the provision. All beyond this is foreign to the subject.  
  
The Legislature having done this, an advance by the Treasury in anticipation of the service cannot be a breach of the provision. Tis in no sense an additional allowance by the UStates. Tis a mere advance or loan upon account of the established periodical compensation. Will legal ideas or common parlance warrant the giving the denomination of additional compensation to the mere anticipation of the term of an established allowance? If they will not, tis plain such an advance is no breach of this part of the constitution.  
If the clause is to be understood literally it leads to an absurdity. The terms are “The President shall at stated times receive &amp;c” and again “he shall not receive within that period &amp;c.”  
His allowance is at the rate of 25000 Dollars per annum, 6250 Dollars quarter yearly. Suppose at the end of a year, an arrear of 5000 Dollars was due to him, which he omits to receive till some time in the succeeding year, and in the succeeding year actually receives that ballance with his full salary for the last year. Tis plain that he would not have received in the whole more than he was allowed by law, and yet in the stated period of one year he would have received 30,000 Dollars, five thousand more than his salary for the year. In a literal sense then constitutional provision as to actual payment would not have been complied with; for within the first of the stated periods he would not have received the compensation allotted and within the second of them, he would have received more. In a literal sense, it would be necessary to make the payment at the precise day, to the precise amount, neither more nor less; which as a general rule the indispensable forms of the Treasury render impossible. It follows that actual receipt or payment are not the criterion but the absolute definitive allowance by law. An advance beforehand or a payment afterwards are equally consistent with the true spirit &amp; meaning of this part of the constitution.  
Let us now see, if the construction of the Treasury violates the law which establishes the Presidents compensation.  
The act of the 24th Septr. 1789 allows to the President at the rate of 25000 dollars per annum, to commence from the time of his entering on the duties of his office, and to be paid quarterly out of the Treasury of the U States.”  
The question is what is to be understood by these words, to be paid quarterly out of the Treasury of the UStates?  
The conception of the Treasury has been that these words, as used in this and in the analogous cases, were meant to define the time, when the right of an individual to the compensation earned became absolute; not as a command to the Treasury to issue the money at the precise day and no other.  
As mentioned above, the indispensable forms of the Treasury, in compliance with the law establishing the department and to secure a due accountability, make it impracticable to pay at the day; and if expressions of the kind in question are to be construed literally and as a positive injection to the Treasury to issue the money at the period defined, it will be as much a breach of the law to pay afterwards as to advance beforehand.  
The position that an after payment would be a breach of the law will hardly be contended for, and if not—the alternative seems to be the construction adopted by the Treasury. Such expressions denote simply that at certain periods individuals acquire a perfect right to particular sums of money for their services which it becomes a matter of course to pay; but they are not obliged to receive it at the day, nor is the Treasury restrained from paying it afterwards or from anticipating by way of loan, if there are adequate reasons for such anticipation.  
It is not true as alleged that the invariable practice of the Treasury, as to compensations for services differs in principle from what was done in the case of the President.  
Instances to the contrary have been stated. As to what regards the army, there has been sufficient explanation.  
But it will be useful to be more particular as to the course which has been pursued with reference to the two houses of Congress.  
The law that regulates their compensation (passed the 22d of Sep. 1789) allows to each member a compensation of six dollars for every day he shall attend the House, to which he belongs, together with six Dollars for every 20 Miles of distance to &amp; from his place of residence, and directs that the compensation which shall be due shall be certified by the President of the Senate or Speaker of the House of Representatives and shall be passed as public accounts and paid out of the Treasury.  
By an arrangement between each house and the Treasury Department the course actually pursued has been as follows.  
Certain gross sums usually of   at the commencement of each session &amp; from time to time afterwards have been advanced from the Treasury, at request to the President of the Senate for the members of the Senate, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, for the members of that house; on account and frequently in anticipation of their accruing compensations. The President of the Senate in the Senate &amp; the Speaker of the House of Representatives in that house disbursed the monies to the individuals, &amp; afterwards upon the close of each session settled an account at the Treasury, accompanied with the certificates required by the law and the receipts of the members which were examined adjusted &amp; passed as other public accounts.  
Whether there were any advances actually made to the members, in anticipation of their compensations, was a point never discussed between the Treasury &amp; the presiding officers of the two houses, with whom the money was deposited, but I understand that examples of such advances did exist in relation to the House of Representatives. The fact is however immaterial to the point in issue. That must be tested by the times of the advances from the Treasury, and it is certain that these were usually made in anticipation of compensations to grow due; and it is also certain that the course was well understood by both houses of Congress, &amp; is exhibited by the Accounts of the Treasurer laid before them in each session.  
  
If therefore the advances for the President were unconstitutional and illegal; those for both houses of Congress were equally so; and if the President be chargeable with a violation of the constitution of the laws and of his oath of office on account of extra-advances to his secretaries, whether with or without his privity, the members of both houses of Congress, without exception, have been guilty of the same crimes, in consequence of the extra advances with their privity to the presiding officers of their respective houses.  
A distinction may possibly be attempted to be taken in the two cases from this circumstance—that the law which allots the compensation of the members of the two houses does not use the words “to be paid every day out of the Treasury” while that which establishes the Presidents compensation does use the terms “to be paid quarterly out of the Treasury.” But this distinction would be evidently a cavil. When a law fixes the term of a compensation; whether per day ⅌ month per quarter or per annum, if it says nothing more, it is implied that it is payable at each epoch out of the Treasury, in the same sense as if this was expressly said. This observation applies as well to the monthly pay of the Army as to the dayly pay of Congress. The motive to the arrangement which was made for the payment of the members of Congress was two fold. It was to obviate embarrassment to them by facilitating and accelerating the receipt of their compensations and to avoid an inconvenient multiplication of adjustments entries warrants &amp; payments. The theory of the provision admitted of as many Treasury settlements entries warrants &amp; payments each day as there were members in both houses.  
Having examined the question as it stands upon the constitution &amp; the laws, I proceed to examine the course of the fact.  
But previous to this, I shall take notice of one point, about which there has been doubt and which it is not within my present recollection whether definitively settled or not by the accounting officers of the Department. It respects the time of the commencement of the Presidents compensation. The law establishing it refers to the time of his entering upon the duties of his office, but without defining that time.  
  
When in a constitutional &amp; legal sense did the President enter upon the duties of his Office?  
The constitution enjoins that before he enters upon the execution of his office, he shall take a certain oath, which is prescribed. This oath was not taken till the 30th. of April 1789. If we date the entrance upon the duties of his office at the time of taking this oath, it determines the epoch to be the 30th. of April 1789.  
But there is room for another construction. The 3 of March 1789 is the day, when the term, for which the President Vice President &amp; the members of Congress were first elected, was deemed to commence. The constitution declares that the President shall hold his office for four years; and it is presumeable that the clause respecting his compensation contemplates its being for the whole term for which he is to hold his office. Its object may otherwise be evaded.  
It is also (I believe) certain that the President may execute his office and do valid acts as President without previously taking the oath prescribed; though in so doing if voluntary he would be guilty of a breach of the constitution &amp; would be liable to punishment. The taking of the oath is not therefore necessarily the criterion of entering upon the duties of office.  
It is a fact too if I remember right that at New York the place assigned for the first meeting of the Government on the 3d. of March 1789—which might be considered as an entrance upon the duties of his office; though from the delays which attended the meeting of Congress the oath was deferred till the 30th of April following.  
On the strength of these facts, it may be argued that by force of the constitution, dating the commencement of the Presidents term of service on the 3d. of March 1789, the law respecting his compensation ought to be considered as referring to that period for a virtual entrance upon the duties of his Office.  
In stating this construction, I must not be understood to adopt it. I acknowlege that the other as most agreeable to the more familiar sense of the terms of the law has appeared to me preferable; though I had reason to believe that an important officer of the Government (I do not mean the President) once thought otherwise. The result in point of fact will vary as the one or the other is deemed the true construction.  
I return to an examination of the course of the transaction.  
Authentic statements which have been published with some supplementary ones received from the Treasury upon the occasion exhibit the following results.  
I  Result. The sums advanced for the use of the President from the Treasury have never exceeded the sums previously appropriated by law; though they have sometimes exceeded sometimes fallen short of the sums actually due for services. This is thus explained—

The residue of the proposition is illustrated by the quarterly statement of salary and advances at foot.  
  
II   Result   The Treasury never has been in advance for the President beyond the sums actually accrued and due to him for services to the amount of one quarter’s salary. The largest advance at any one time is 6154 dollars. A quarter’s salary is 6250 Dollars. Deducting the sums at certain times in arrear from those at other times in advance, the average of the advances for the whole term of his service is about . The particulars of this result appear in the statement at foot. This statement is digested by quarters of the Calendar year which is the established course of the Treasury &amp; a course essential to the order of its affairs; that is to say it is essential there should be certain fixed periods to which the ordinary stated disbursements are referred &amp; in conforming with which the Accounts of the Treasury are kept.  
III   Result   On the first of October 1795, there were actually due to the President for his compensation over and above all advances for his use the sum of 846 Dollars. This likewise appears from the statement at foot and intirely refutes the malevolent suggestion which has appeared of an accumulation of advances to twelve or fifteen [thousand] Dollars.  
IV   Result   The sums advanced for the President prior to the commencement of the term of his second election the 3d. of March 1793 fall short of the sums appropriated for his compensation 2850 Dollars: thus  
  
  
  
  
The aggregate of the sums appropriated for four years from the 29 of September 1789 to the 23 of December 1791 inclusively is Ds.  
100 000  
  
  
The amount of all the sums advanced prior to the 3d. of March 1793 is  
97 150  
  
  
Excess of appropriations beyond advances. =  
 2 850  
  
It is nevertheless true that not only there have been frequent anticipations of the Presidents salary (as appears more particularly in the statement at foot) but counting from the 30th of April 1789 as the commencement of his compensation the sums advanced for his use prior to the 3d. of March 1793 the expiration of his first term of election exceed those actually due to that period by 1108 Dollars &amp; 34 Cents.  
If on the contrary, the construction were adopted which dates his compensation on the 4th of March 1789 there would have been a ballance due to him on the 4 of March 1795 of 2850 Dollars.  
But proceeding on the first supposition the whole question still turns upon the legality of advances. If it was legal to make him an advance in anticipation of his salary within any period of his election—within one quarter on account of a succeeding quarter, it was equally legal to do it within one year on account [of] a succeeding year and within one term of an election on account of a succeeding term. The only inquiry would be in either case—will the sum advanced be within the bounds of the sums before that time appropriated? It has been seen, that the sums appropriated for the first four years of service exceeded those advanced prior to the commencement of the second period of election by 2850 Dollars. Besides this on the 28 of February 1793 there was a further appropriation of 25000 Dollars so that at the beginning of the second term, the total appropriation exceeded the total disbursements by 27850 Dollars.  
Thus has it been shewn, that the advances for the use of the President have been governed by a rule of construction, which has obtained in analogous cases, or more truly which has regulated the general course of disbursements from the Treasury—a rule which I trust has been demonstrated to be consonant with the Constitution and the laws.  
It is requisite to inquire a little further whether there has been any improper use or rather abuse of the discretion which is contended for, for here there is likewise an unquestionable responsibility. It is seen that the advances have at no time equalled one quarters salary.  
I ask was it unreasonable or unfit, if constitutional and legal, to afford the President of the U States an accommodation of this extent?  
  
I pledge my veracity, that I have always understood and to this moment I have good reason to be satisfied, that the expences of the President, those of his household and others incident to his official situation, have fully equalled if not on some occasions exceeded the allowance made to him by the U States. Under this conviction, especially, how could the head of a department hesitate by so small an accommodation as the advance of less than a quarters salary to enable the President of the U States to meet his expences as they accrued, without being obliged to intrench upon his own private resources, or to resort to the expedient of borrowing to defray expences imposed upon him by public situation? I knew that no possible risk could attend the advance, little considerable as it was. The estate of the President was answerable in case of death or other premature vacancy, and abundant for the indemnification of the Government.  
Reasons of a peculiar kind forbade hesitation. The scale of expence was unavoidably such as to render the income even of what is deemed a large landed property in this country a slender auxiliary. Without an advance from the Treasury it was not improbable borrowing might be necessary. Was it just to compel the President to resort to that expedient for a purpose in fact public, at his private expence? Was it for the dignity of the Nation that he should have been exposed to a necessity, an embarrassment of this sort?  
My judgment and feelings answered both these questions in the negative. I entertained no doubt of the constitutionality or legality of the advance, and I thought the making of it due to the situation—due to propriety—due to every public consideration connected with the subject. I can never regret it.  
How far the President was privy to the course of advances, I cannot say. But it is certain they have been all made to his private secretaries upon a general arrangement and not by special directions from him. And I think it proper to add that very early in the day, and probably before any was made, on an application by Mr. Lear, for a sum which would constitute an advance he qualified it by this observation—“if in your opinion it can be done with legality &amp; perfect propriety.” I answered that I had no doubt of either.  
I shall not attempt to assume any greater responsibility in this transaction than belongs to me but I have been accustomed to think that the responsibility for the due and regular disbursement of monies from the Treasury lies exclusively with the Officers of the Department. And that except in a very palpable and glaring case, the charge of blameable participation could not fall on any other person.  
As between the officers of the Treasy, I take the responsibility to stand thus. The Secretary and Comptroller in granting warrants upon the Treasurer are both answerable for their legality. In this respect the Comptroller is a check upon the Secretary. With regard to the expediency of an advance, in my opinion the right of judging is exclusively with the head of the Department. The Comptroller has no voice in this matter. So far therefore as concerns legality, in the issues of money, while I was in the Department, the Comptroller must answer with me. So far as a question of expediency, or the due exercise of discretion may be involved, I am solely answerable. And so uniformly was the matter understood between successive Comptrollers &amp; myself—So also it is essential to the due administration of the department, that it should be understood.  
I have stated my reasons for considering the advances made for the use of the President as constitutional legal and proper. But I pretend not to infallibi[li]ty. ’Tis possible I may have erred. But to convert error into guilt it must be supposed to have been wilful. To suppose it wilful it is necessary to trace it to some interested or sinister motive. If any appears let it be pointed out. It is not common for men to commit crimes of a deep die without some adequate inducement.  
What criminal inducement could have probably influenced the rule of construction as to advances which has been stated to have been adopted &amp; acted upon at the Treasury? What criminal inducement particularly could have led to the application of this rule to the Presidents compensation in so restricted a form as never once to equal one quarter’s salary? Who in his senses will believe that the President would consciously have hazarded the imputation of violating the constitution the laws and his oath of office, by imposing on the officers of the Treasury the necessity of making him so paltry an advance? falsely and ridiculously called a donation? Who will believe that those officers would have consented to expose themselves to the same imputation by a compliance, when they knew that the evidence of their guilt must regularly be communicated in each succeeding session to both houses of Congress and to the public at large? To believe either is to believe all the parties concerned foolish in the extreme, as well as profligate in the extreme, destitute equally of intellect as of principle.  
To an observation made by Mr. Wolcott on the communications from the Treasury, it has been answered that there was no merit in the disclosure, because the number of Agents and the forms of the Treasury rendered it unavoidable. The fact is so. But the force of the observation turns upon the egregious folly of intentionally committing the crimes imputed, when it was certain beforehand that the means of detection must be furnished and without delay by the Treasury itself.  
It is certain that there never has been the least attempt at mystery or concealment. The documents reported by the Treasury to both houses of Congress carried in their face the prominent evidence of what was done. Frequent and indiscriminate personal suggestions revealed the principle of action. It is evident, that it must have been understood and acquiesced in by all the members of the two houses of congress.  
Hard would be the condition of public officers, if even a misconstruction of constitutional &amp; legal provisions, attended with no symptom of criminal motive, carrying the proof of innocence in the openness and publicity of conduct, could justly expose them to the odious charges which on this occasion are preferred. Harder still would be their condition if in the management of the great and complicated business of a Nation the fact of misconstruction which is to constitute their guilt is to be decided by the narrow and rigid rules of a criticism—no less pedantic than malevolent! Preeiminently Hard in such circumstances, was the lot of the man who called to the head of the most arduous department in the public administration, in a new Government, without the guides of antecedent practice &amp; precedent, had to trace out his own path and to adjust for himself the import and bearings of delicate and important provisions in the constitution &amp; in the laws!  
Reposing myself on a consciousness which in no possible situation can fail to prove an invulnerable shield to my tranquillity I leave to a candid Public to pronounce the sentence which is due to an attempt, on such a foundation, to erect against The President of the U States, my successor in Office and myself, the heinous charges of violation of the constitution, violation of the laws, exertion of arbitrary will on the one side, abject submission on the other misapplication of the public money and to complete the newspaper groupe—intentional Perjury!

from the Treasury but for an otjed for which there was a law previ­  
ously pajjed, making an appropriation andd:/igruting the fund front  
which the twney was to arlje. But there being fuck a law and an  
adequate fund to fnpport the expenditure, it was deemed jujlipablet  
as zvell befoit as aher the service was performed or the fupp&#x27;y ob»  
tained for which. the appropriation wat defined, to mat! djbujfo­  
ments from the Treasury for the abject, if it appearedJiife aniex-  
pcdient so to do. If made before, it was aa advance ar tnticipa­  
&#x27; tin tor which the party was charged and heid aceeuntabJe,  
&#x27;till exonerated by the performanceof the service or by the  
furnifhing of thefupply—lt afterwards it was a payment, and  
went to (ome general head or accouut as such.  
Thus if a sum was appropriated for provifionsfor the army  
~~ for a particular \ ear, it was common to make advances on ac-  
T connt 10 the Contractors long before tile supplies were furni(b»  
ad. If the law was passed in oue year for the next, there  
would be no hesitation to make the advance, iinmediarely  
after the passing of the law, and before the year to which the  
appropriation was applicable, had commenced. 60 alfofums  
won dbe furnilhed to the Department oi War in anticipa&#x27;ion  
&gt;n of the monthly pay as the officers and soldiers and other items  
of expenditure. so likewil&#x27;e advances have been nsadfi  
fortheufeof the President and of the members of bothhou­  
f« of Coagrefs in anticipation of their refpeitive compenfa—  
— Ir 1 without difficulty be comprehended that this  
practice of the Trevlury gn In iimwlu been tffential to  
the uue course of the public service.  
tm Every good judge will be lenfiblc, thar from the infufnei*  
ency of individual Capitals to such largeadvances as the fup­  
piies of an army require, it was indif|&gt;enfable to the obtain*  
tngthcln, that auticipatioas from the Treasury (hould enable  
the Contractor, to do what otherwise they would have been  
unable to do j and that these anticipations mull also have had  
theeffefl of procuring the supplies on cheaper terms to the  
United -tates.  
When it is eonitlered too that the army has operat­  
t. Ed for several yearn past at the diftanse of five or fix  
— hundred mile* from the feat of Government, and a  
, • considerable part of the year, from the rudeness of the  
D. country and obftru&amp;ions of wxters, it is iwpradicabls  
to trsnfmit monies to the fienes of payment—it will  
be perceived that without advances from the Treasury  
in anticipation »f their pay, not only a compliance,  
l&quot; with the engagements of. he Oavernment would have  
be«n impossible, but the troops must have been always  
&#x27; left unreasonably in arrear. Injuns 1794, Congress  
paflied a law declaring that the army ftould in future  
be paid in such tnanner as that the arrears fhauld not  
exceed two months—Compliance with this regulation  
fenders anticipations at certain seasons, matter of Phy­  
fual necessity j yet that law gave no special authority  
tr&#x27; for the purpose.  
A particular cafe, by way of example, in whichj  
diftmit from general rules, advances or anticipations  
r.u in the War Department are neceflary, refpetfls the re­  
cruiting service, the Officers detached on this service,  
who are for a long time diliant from thtir c rps require  
§ the accommodation of an advance o pay to be able ta  
difeharge their duty. Towards the possibility of en­  
lilting men. it is iiidifpenfable they ihonld carry with  
them the bounty money, and this upon conjecture of  
what may be done, and with the possibility that from  
not being able to obtain the men, the ultimate expen­  
diture may not take place. This initance will suggest  
to reflexion an infinite number of cases, in the course  
of the public service, in which a diiburfement from the  
Treasury rrtujl precede the execution of the abjetl and  
may exceed the sum finally requiCt* for it.  
ual These cases indicate the expediency, and even nt­  
&gt; ceffity of the conitruiftian which has regulated the  
prance of the Treasury—And it might be (hewn, if  
neceQary, that it is analogous to the practice under  
the former government of the United States and under  
other governments; and this too where the theory of  
expenditure is, as expressed in our Constitution, that no  
money (ball be expended, bnt in eonfequence of an ap»  
&gt;dk propriation by law.  
;iu It remains to fee whether this rule of conduct, fa  
indispensable in the praitice of the Department, be  
tj,e permitted by a fair interpretation of the conftituitioa  
lt;J and the laws.  
er, The general lnjuntflion of the Ccnftitution (Article  
-ut I. § IX.) is that •&#x27; no money (kail be drawn from the  
ds. Treasury but in eonfequence of appropriations made by  
law.

or by way of payment. It may precede  
T follow the service, supply or other object of expen­  
diture—Either will equally fatisfy the words, &quot; in con­  
sequence of,&quot; which are not words of ftriit import,  
but may be taken in several fenfes—ln one sense, that is  
&quot; in consequence of&quot; a thing, which, being bottomed  
tipon it, follows it in order of time.  
A difcurfement mull be either as advance or antici­  
pation of a payment—&#x27;Tis not presumable, that the  
Con dilution meant to diflinguifh between these two  
v V modes of difbarfement—lt mult have iiiiendecTtcjleave  
this matter wholly to convenience  
The design of the Constitution in this provision was,  
as I conceive, to secure these important ends, that the  
purpose, the limit and the fund of every expenditure  
fliauld be ascertained by a previous law. The public  
security is complete in this particular if no money can  
be expended but for an object to an extent and out of  
a fund, which the laws have prescribed.  
&quot;Even in eaies, which efFeil only individual interests,  
if the terms-os a law will bear several meanings, that  
&#x27;s to be preferred which will belt accord with conve­  
nience. In cases which concern the public, this rule \
is applicable ftifl greater latitude—-Publie con- ,  
venieac* is to be promoted, public inconvenience to  
be avoided. The bufmefs of administration requires |  
accommodation to so great a variety of clrcumitances,  
that a narrow eonftruition would in countlefi instances j  
arrest the wheels of Government.  
Ithas been fliewn, that the conftruitioo wljicfy has &#x27;  
been adopted at the Treasury is in many cases eflen- (  
tial in praitice—This inclines the scale in favour of it (  
—the words &quot;in confeiutnce of&quot; admitting of various r  
fignificalions.  
The prailice of the Legislature, as to appropria- j  
tion-laws, favours this conftruition.  
These laws are generally diflinit from those which  
create the caui&#x27;i»of expenditure. Thus the ail which  
declares that the President shall be allowed at the rate a  
of twenty five thou find Dollars pr. annum, that which a  
declares that each Senator and Representative shall be j  
entitled to so much pr. day, that which determines .  
that each Officer and soldier shall have so much pr. Jl  
mouth, &amp;c.—neither of these aits is an aA of appro- V  
priation. The Treasury-has not conceived itfelf au- £  
thorifed to expend a single cent upon the basis of any  
such ail ; regarding it merely as conflituting a claim J  
upon the government for a certain compensation,  
but requiring prior to an aaual dilburfement for such  
claim, that a law be palled authorising the dilburfement P  
out of a special fund. This is what is considered as the &#x27;!  
law, by which the appropriation is made ; from which  
rel&#x27;utts to the public a double security. &quot;  
Hence every year a particular aft (sometimes more  
than one) ispafl&quot;;d appropriating certain sums for the  
various branches of the public service, and indicating  
the funds from whjch the monies are to be drawn— ri  
The obj eft, the sum and the fund are all that are to be I 1&gt;  
fount! in these ails—They are commonly, if not ufti- j3  
rerfally silent as to any thing further. *  
Tliis I regard as eonftrudtive of the clause in the &#x27;  
constitution. The appropriation laws are in execution  
of that provision, and fulfil all its purposes. And they  
are silent as to the diftinition between anticipation and Bl  
payment in other words as to the manner of disburse- tl  
, ment&#x27; . &#x27; fu  
Hence I conclude that if there exist a law appropri- t|  
ating a certain sum for the salary of the President, an  
advance upon that sum in anticipation of the service, is  
as constitutional as a payment after the service has been re  
performed: in other words that the advance of a quar- cr  
ter&#x27;s salary at the beginning of a quarter is as much T  
warranted by the Constitution as the payment &#x27;of it at it  
the end of a quarter. t0  
It is in this sense that the present Secretary of the •  
Treasury has affirmed, that not one dollar has at any j&quot;  
time been advanced for the us« of the President for .  
which there was not an existing appropriation. Iledid &quot;&lt;  
not fay that no money had been advanced in 3**  
tioit of the service ; for the fail i» &quot;6ut~no- ari  
thing Is muic 11 uc than that the sums disbursed were  
within the limits of the sums appropriated. If there  
was an excels at the end of one year, there had been r  
a previous appropriation for a succeeding year, upon ,et  
which that excels was an advance.  
It is objeitcd to this praitise, that the deatti of the m&lt;  
party between the advance to him and the expiration of  
®f an equivalent term of service, by fuperceding the w?  
objeil of the advance, would render it a mifexpendi- [0  
ture of so much money, and therefore a yiolation of the  
Constitution. &#x27; J  
I answer, thiit the fame cafuality might hava the  
ftmeeffeit in other cases, in which it would be against a&#x27;_  
common sense to suppose that an advance might not be wl  
made with legality and propriety. oel  
Suppose for example a law was to be pasTed direct- mc  
ing a given quantity of powder to be pui-chafed for *j&#x27;r  
public use, and appropriating a definite&#x27;fum for the •  
purchase and suppose intelligence brought to the Secre­  
tary of the, Treasury, that the quantity required could .  
be procured for prompt payment at Bolton. It can- lts  
not in such a calit ne doubted, that the full sum ap- mij  
propriated might be legally advanced to an agent to ati&lt;  
proceed to Boston to make the purchafe-r-yet that vic  
Agent might die, and the money never be applied ac  
cording to its deftinaticfti, or the defirci quantity might i  
be procured for ale sfum and a balance remain in his &lt;&#x27; &#x27;.a  
hands. tot  
In either cafe, there would be money drawn from a&quot;t  
the Treasury, which not applied to the objeil of tioi  
the law—in the latt cafe there is pu final object for the ver  
dilburfement, because tKe balance is a ftrplus. This f ,n­  
---proves rhat the pollibility of a failure or falling ffiort v, 1  
of the object, for whi. h an advance is made, is not an  
ohjeftion to its legality. Indeed the confeq&#x27;ience t0 &#x27;  
is a possible one in of an anticipation, wheth- &#x27;  
er to contradlors or to other public Agents, for a de- the  
terminate or an indrtenViinate purpose. &quot; &#x27;  
The consequence is, that the sum unapplied niuft „;3  
he accounted for and refunded—This d&#x27;.ftinCli&amp;n here |n  
again is between an advance and a pnym&#x27;-tt- More J  
cannot certainly be finally pa:tl than iS_ equal to the &#x27;e.  
nbjeift of an appropriation, though the sum appropri- w,t  
ated exceed the sum recefiary. But more may be ad- Utl  
vanced to the full extent of the appropriation,, than ]  
may be ultimatefy exhausted by the ohjeil of the ex- low  
penditure, on the condition, which always attends an th,.  
advance, of accounting for the application and refund- .•  
inganexcef*. This is a direst anfwer&#x27;to tin queflion,  
whether more can be paid than is neceflnry to fatisfy &#x27;  
theobjeil of an appreciation. More cannot be paid, c  
hut more may be advanced, on the accountability of  
to whom it is advanced. d|-;a  
The cSl&#x27;e Rated by way of example is also conclusive r\
tothc point that money maybe drav.nfrom the Trea- to t  
fury in apticipation-of the Of expenditure.  
But risk of lofi to the public may attend the prin­  
ciple J this is true, but it is as true in all the cales of  
advanees&#x27;to contradlors &amp;c. as in those of advances upon J  
salaries andcompmfations—nor dOesthis point ot risk the  
affect the question of legality—it touches merely that tive  
of the prudent e.vrcife of diliretion. When lai ge. by  
sums.are advanced, it is ufnil to obtain feorritv for  
their due application or for indemnification. This j  
security is greater or lefj, according to the circumflan­  
ces of the parties to who&#x27;/n the advances are made.— &quot;lte  
when small sums are advanced, efpecialjy if for pur- &#x27;he  
• poles quickly fulfilled, and to pcrfons, who are them- com  
fdves adecpiate sureties, no collateral ftcuritv it de-   
mandtd—The head of the department is refpoufiblc *  
so to the government for observing proper mcafure the ~  
and taking proper precautions. If he iAs so as to in- but &quot;i  
car justly the charge of improvidence or profyfiou, he veloj  
  
:ede miybedifmiffedor punished according to the nature  
»en- of his milconiudl.  
:on- But the principle which is set up would, it is said,  
ort, he productive of confulion difirefs and brankruptcya!  
it is the Treasury ; since the appropriation for the fup­  
oed port 0/ government is made payable out or the accruing  
duties of each year, and a« established right in the of­  
tici- ficcrs of government to claim their compensations,  
the either on the firfi day of the jrear, or on the firfi day  
two of a quarter before the fervjees w ere rendered, would  
ave create a demand at a time when there might and pos­  
sibly there would not be a fingie shilling in the Treasury  
ras&gt; arifmg out of that appropriatioa to fatisfy it. *  
t,ie It unot pretended, that theA; is an ejtablifhed right  
ure in the officers to claim their salaries by anticipation, at ;  
ollc the beginning of 1 yejr, or at the beg nnisg of a quar- j  
can ter: No futli right exists.- The performance of the I  
f °f service must precede the right to demand payment.;  
But it dees not follow that because there is no right j  
&#x27;^s&gt; in the officer to dwnanJ payment, it may not be allow- !  
at abl» for the Treasury to advance upon account for j  
,c&quot; good reasons. A discretion »f th&gt;« fort in the Ht ad of !  
u&#x27;e the Department can at leajt iuvolve rto embarriffment  
3n&quot; to the treasury, none of the forinid Ale evils indicated,  
to for the officer who makes the advance being himfelf |  
res the judge whethet there is a competent land, and &#x27; j  
;s&#x27; whether it can be.made with convcnirnee to tlic Trea- j  
ces fury—he will only make it, when he perceives that 110  
evil will ensue.  
la® Let me recur to the example of advances to con- I  
:n&quot; traitors for supplying the army. Suppose that in the &#x27;  
11 terms of contra it certain advances were stipulated and &#x27; c  
&gt;us made; but it turned out nevertheleis, that the con-,- 1  
traitor, disappointed in the funds on which he had re-1 y  
la&quot; lied, could not execute his without furthers j  
advances. Here there would be us right 011 his part  
c. to demand fucn further advances, but there would be j  
C 1 a. discretion in the Treasury to make them. This is e  
Ij&#x27; an example of a discretion to do what there is not a h  
ije right to demand. Theexillence of this |jicretion can f  
do n&gt; harm, because the head ot the 1 reafury will f,  
* judge whether the state of it permits the required ad- p  
,o&#x27; vances. -&quot;But it is eflential, that the discretion should v  
u extft, because otherwise there might be a failure of ,  
fuppiies, which 110 plan tkat could be substituted might  
J be able to avert.  
Yet the discretion is in neither cafe an arbitrary one I  
—It is one which the head ef the Department is res-, p  
nt ponifibie to exercise with a careful eye to the public n  
interest and fafety. The abuse of it, in other words, jr  
the ess and wanton exercise of it would be j­  
a caule of dismission for incapacity or of punifliment  
re for mal-conduil.  
le Thus advances on account of f?Hries, or to con- a  
,j tractors for procuring public fuppliet, might be car- Pried  
—ried so far, and so improvidtntly managed, as to &#x27;&#x27;  
t&gt;e be highly culpable and iullly punifliable ; but this   
&quot;&quot; is a diftintl quetyioa ftom the violation of constitu­  
tion or law. &#x27;li  
In all the safes, it is a complete anfwtr to the ct  
,v abjeftioM of embarraflment to the Tieafury, that  
1 j not the will of the parties, but the judgment of  
e- the head of the department, is tj»e rule and mea &#x27;a  
ftire of the advances, which he may make, within er  
7~ the bounds of the funis appropiiated by law. ¥&#x27;  
■s I consider the law, which has been cited with  
n reg»rd to the pay of the army, as a legislative re­  
cognition of the rule of practice at the Tieafury.  
h The Legiilature could not have been ignorarit that  
it it was impracticable at certain seasons of the year  
to convey the money to the army, to fulfil their in- 03  
: juniflian, without an advance from the Treasury °f  
before the pay became due. Thjj. pr*fuppofe a fo&gt;  
j n&#x27;glit to mnke this advance, «t»d enjoin that the  
. ttaops ft..!! n9T Uc left m»r« ltian two monllu 77i  
- arrear. -I&#x27;  
e The origin of this law enforces the observation.   
c It is known that it passed in confeqncnce of irepre-  
J fentations, that the pay of the aimy was left too m&lt;  
long rn arrear, a.id it was intcuded to quicken the Wa  
e measures of payment. No perfoa in cither hjufe rCC  
1 of the Legislature, I believe, doubted that there mt  
t was power to preeede the service by advances, so as  
■ to render the payment eveu more puniStual than was on  
c enjoined. &#x27; en  
Indeed such advances, when the army operated &quot;a 1  
[ at a diftanct, w:re neceiTary to fulfil the »ontradl &#x27;eB  
■ with it. Its pay became due monthly, and in drift- am  
ness of contract was te be made at the end of each  
■ month, a thing impofiible unlcfs advanced from the t&#x27;&quot;!  
Treasury before it became due. No fpeeial autho­  
rity ever gives for this purpose to the ?&quot;  
Treasury, but it appea Ito have betn left to take eC*  
its course on the principle, that the disbursement tlle  
; might take jjace as fuoii as there was an ap&quot;j&gt;ropri- UC  
ation, though in anticipation of the terra of ser­  
vice. Pni  
The foregoing obferv3tions vindicate, I trull &#x27;  
the conftruftion of the Treafuty as to the power 1° .  
of in iking diftiurfements in anticipation of fcrviccs ™t!  
and fuppiies, if there has been a .previous appropria. &#x27;  
tion by lav. for the object, and if the advanecs ne­  
rer exoecd the amount appropriated ; and at the  
fame time evince, that this practice involves no &#x27;  
vfoUtion of the ranftitutional proviiiou with respect f%C  
to appropriations. &quot;e  
I proceed to examine that claufe,which refpefts  
the pay of the President. It is in these words : tUni  
&quot; The Prudent shall at stated times receive&#x27;f.&gt;r  
nis services a compensation, which ilia 11 neither be  
increased nor diminiiliedduring the petiod for which T&quot;  
he shall have been eledcd, and he shall not receive ,  
within that period any other emolument from the  
United States or any of them.&quot; UnC  
1 understand this clause as equivalent to the sol- f&#x27; (  
lowing : &quot; There .lull be t.tablifhed by law for r  
the services of the President a periodical com ten fa- 1  
tnn, which shall not be increased &gt;ior diminished  
during the term for which be shall have Ween elcd- T  
ed, and neither the United States nor any (late (hall C  
allow him any emolument i 0 addition to his pcrio­  
di:al tompenfation.&quot; va&quot;&#x27;  
This will, I think, at firfi fight appear foreign pL*d  
to the qucftion of a prouifional advance by the ,**  
Treasury, onaccount of tire compensation periodi- &#x27;  
cally ellablidied by law for his fervites. &#x27; •  
The manifeft objea of the provision is to «uars / 8  
the independence o£ the President from the kgifla-T t&lt;:  
ttve controul of the United States or of ar.y itate r&quot;  
by the ability to withhold, lcffcn, or incrcafe hii r &#x27;  
compensation. lury  
It requires that the law shall aftijrn him a deft- T&#x27;&#x27;  
nite compensation for a definite time&#x27;; It prohibits  
the Legislature from increasing or dimimfliing this  
compensation, during any term of his deftion U&quot;r  
&#x27; pr?Il

quarter&#x27;s falnry. The largest advance at any one time  
is 6,154 dolUrs—a quarter&#x27;s filary is 62-50 doliare. ,  
The particulars of this result appear in the annexed J  
statement. This ftateraent is riigefted t&gt;y quarters of  
thi calender year, which is tic established course of &#x27;  
the treasury, and a course eflential to the order of Its  
affairs ; that is to fay, it is eflential there (hould be  
certain fixed periods to which the ordinary stated dif- i  
burfements are referred, and in conformity with which  
the accounts of the treafisry arc kept. 1  
3d result. On the fir [I ofOSober, 179J, th»re was &lt;  
ntlually due to the President for his compensation over ,  
and above all advances for hisufe, the sim a/846 dtl- ,  
lars. This likewise appears from the fhtement at ,  
foot, and entirely refutes the malevolent suggestion .  
of an accumulation of advances to twelve or fifteen 1  
thousand dollars.  
4th. RESULT. The sums ndvaricedfai the President 1  
prier t* the commencement of the term tf his second I  
eh&amp;ion, the 4th of March, 1793, fall short »f the sums 1  
appropriated for bis compensation, 1% so dollars, thus: ,  
The aggregate of the sums appropriated  
for four years from the 39th Sept. 1789, to  
the 23d Dec. 1791 inclusively, is Dollars 100,000 1  
The amount of all the sums advanced prior  
to the 4th March, 1793, is 97,i.f0 f  
1  
Excess of appropriations beyond advances, 1,850 t  
It is nevertheless true that not only there have \
been frequent anticipations of the President&#x27;s salary t  
(ai appears more particularly in the statement at i  
foot) but counting from the 30th of April 1789 t  
as ihe commencement of his compensation, the 1  
sums advanced for his use t» the 3d of March 1793, f  
the expiration of his &#x27;firft term of ele&amp;ion, exceed J  
those a finally due up to that period by 104 a dot- c  
lars and 69 cents. v  
If on the contrary the conflru&amp;ion were adop­  
ted which dates his compensation on the 4th of ii  
March 1789, there would have been a balanee due v  
to him on the fourth of March 1793, 2Sjo dvl, e  
lars. n  
But proceeding on the firft fuppojition, the t  
whole queltion still turns upon the legality of ad- f&lt;  
vanccs- J fit was legal t® make hinj an advance in  
anticipation of his salary within any period of his f  
ele&amp;ion—within ane quarter on account of a fuc- t;  
ceeding quarter,— it was equally legal to do it with- h  
in one year on account of a fuccecding year, and tl  
within one term of an election on account of a fuc- 31  
ceeding term.—The only enquiry would be in ei- ti  
ther cafe-—Will the fata advanced be within the i h  
bounds of the sums before that time appropriated I p  
II has beea fees that the sums appropriated for the &#x27; ei  
firft four years of service exceeded those advanced ! e;  
prior to the commencement of the second period C  
of election by 2850 dollars. Belides this, 011 the ei  
28th of February 1793 there was a further appro- in  
priation of zjoo dollars—so that at.the beginning d(  
of the second term the total appropriation exeeded  
the total disbursements by 27,850 dollars. c&lt;  
Thus- has it been (hewn, that the advances for fv  
the use of the President have been governed by a b&lt;  
rule of conftru&amp;ion which has obtained in analo- T  
gous cases, 01 more truly which has regulated the B&#x27;  
genera! course of disbursements from the Treafu- eg  
&gt;y *a rule, which, I trust, has been demonstrated cr  
to be consonant with the couftitution and with the th  
laws. .  
It is ftfcVfß??, whether there  
has been any improper use or rather abuse of the at  
discretion whi.h is contended for; for here thtr« m  
is likewise ail unqyeftionable responsibility It i? Ci  
seen that the advances have at uo time equalled one dc  
quarter&#x27;s salary. jn  
I aflc, was it ynreafonable or .unfit, if conllituti- a£  
onal and legal, to afford the President of the Uni- de  
ted States an accommodation to this extent ? th  
I pledge my veracity, that I have always under­  
flood, and t% this moment I have good reason to if  
be fatisfied, that the expences of the President, pr  
those of his houfhoid, and others incident to his m:  
official situation, have fully equalled if not on some pe  
occasions exceeded the allowance made to him by P&quot;  
t&lt;ie United States. Under this conviction, efpeci- ,&#x27;fio  
ally, how could the &quot;head of a department hesitate, dit  
by Jo small an accommodation as the advance of less pll  
than a quarter&#x27;s salary, to enable the Prcfideut of ftr  
the United States to meet his expences as they de  
accrued, without f-cing obliged to intrench upon pel  
his own private refou&lt;ce*,&#x27;or to resort to the ex- fut  
pedient of borrowing, to defray expences imposed cal  
upon him by public situation ! f knew that no i&quot;

a-.fvverable in cafe of death or other premature va- f&#x27;»  
cancy, and abundant for the indemnification of the &#x27;■»  
Government. jav  
Reasons of a peculiar kind forbade hesitation   
namely, Ihe scale of expence was unavoidably P°  
such as to render the income even of what is deem- (hi  
ed 3 large landed property in this country a slender lie  
auxiliary—Without an advaijce from the Treaftiry ten  
it was not imprpbable borrowing might be nc*&#x27; Pr&lt;  
neffary—Was it jnft the President to &#x27;ic&lt;  
resort to that expedient for a purpose in fad pub- of  
lie, at his private expence? Was it for the dignity tio  
of the Nation, that he (hould have been exposed to mil  
a neceflitv to an embarraflm.ent of this fort ? lie  
My judgment and feelings answered both thefc int&lt;  
queftioHS in the negative. I entertained no doubt  
of the conllitutionality or legality of the advance 3  
and I thought thp making of it, due the situation ; ]  
,due to property ; due torveiy public coniideration „cc

a general arrangement, gnd not by special diredi­

was made, on an application by Mr. J.eak., for a Cf&quot;  
sum which would conftitnte an advance, he qualifi­

s? words : &quot;to be paid quarterly out of the Trcafur yof

is, The conception of the Treaftiry has, been, that  
&quot;g these words, as used in this and in the analagous  
to cases, were meant to define the time ivhcn the right

As mentioned above, the indifpetffable forms of  
tlis Treasury, 1 n compliance with the law ellablifh- Cc  
j(r_r the department, and to secure a due accounta­  
bility, make it impraflicabU to pay at the day ; 8;  
and if exprefiions of the kind in queitiou are to be mc  
conflrjied literally and as a poiitive injunction to ne:

afterwards as to advance beforehand. tai  
The pofitipn th;:t an after payment would be a th&lt;

#### 1795-12-08 &middot; [Portsmouth [N.H.]](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portsmouth%2C_New_Hampshire)

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
Q VERY virulent attack has recently been  
made upon the ?refident of the United  
States, the present Secretary of the Trealury, |  
and myfelf a: hic predeceflor in office, on the  
‘ground of exira payments to ks President on  
~account of his salary.  
The charges againit all the three are no less  
heineous than those of intentional violation of |  
the Conflitution, of the laws and of their re-|  
{peftive oaths of office. I annex the epithet |  
intentional, becaule, though not expressly used |  
in the terms of the attack, it 15 implied in every  
line of it : since an involuntasy error of con­  
ftrution, lif that could even be made out, would  
not warrant the imputatons ¢‘of contemning and  
de/pifing every principle which the people have  
ciiablifhed for the fecunity of their rights, of  
Jfetting at defiance all law and authority and of  
Jervile fubmi/fion and compliance with the Zaw­  
lefs will and pleasure of a President.”  
Were considerations personal to myfelf alone  
to be consulted, the present attempt would be  
treated with no greater attention than has been  
shewn to all the anonymous {landers by which  
I have been {o long and so implacably pursued.  
But convinced, by a course of obflervation for  
more than four years, that there exists in this  
country an unprincipled and daring combination,  
under the influence of sinister aims, to obftiuét  
by any means whick_fhall be necessary and can  
be commanded, not short even of force, the due  
and efficient adwminiftration of the present gov­  
ernment, to make out most important national  
interefls subservient to the views of a foreign  
gowcr, and, as means to these ends, to destroy  
- by calumny and misrepresentation the conh­  
dence of the people in the truly virtuous men  
of our country, and to transfer it, with the  
power of the slate, to ambitious, intriguing,  
and hypocritical pretenders to extraordinary  
merit and patrionfm. Perceiving likewise,  
that this infatuated combinatian, in the belief  
that the well earned esteem and attachment of  
his fellow-citizens towards the preflent chief  
magistrate of the United States is the principal  
remaining obstacle to the execution, of their  
plan, are making the most firenuous and fyfle- |  
-matic efforts to extinguish those sentiments in the  
breaits of the people—l think it a duty to &quot;de­  
part from ‘my general rule of conduét, and to  
submit to the public, with my name, an ex­  
planation of the principals which have governed  
the Treasury Department on the point in  
question.  
I shall slate in the firft place, that the rule  
with regard to expenditures and appropriations  
which has uniformly regulated the prattice of  
the department, is this* viz. to ijfuc no moncy  
JSrom the Treasury but for an objelt for which  
there was a law r(c_)’v?zoz.l/l] pa_[id, making .an  
appropriation. g&amp;i} yc&#x27;f%ﬁgp‘i_zté’ngﬂ‘t/ze Sund from  
which the money wals to drife. But there being  
such a law and an adequate fund to [upport the  
expenditure, it was deemed juflifiable as well  
before as after the service was performed or the  
Jupply obtained for which the appropriation was  
designed, to make disbursements from the Treasury  
for the objed, if it appeared Jase and expedient  
Jo to do. If made de¢fore, it was an advance or  
anticipation for which the party was charged  
and held accountable, till exonerated by the  
pcrformance of the service or I?y the furmifhing  
of the lupp\y-——-lf afterwards, it was a payment,  
and went to some general head of account as  
such.  
Thus if a sum was appropriated for provisions  
for the army for a particular year, it was com­  
mon to make advances on account of the con­  
traftors long before the supplies were furnithed.  
1f the law was palfed in one year for the next,  
there would be.no hesitation to make the ad­  
vance immediately after the pafling thc‘ law,  
and before the year to which the appropriation  
was applicable, had commenced. So also sums  
would ge furnifhed to the department of War  
in anticipation of the monthly pay of the officers  
and foldiess and other items of expenditure.  
‘And so likewise advances have been made for  
the use of the Frefidegt and ofuhe Blombers of  
both Houlfes o écﬁf’ %ﬁ“i&amp;“&amp;zxuezpa}zon of their  
refpe@ive . compensations. It will without  
difficulty be comprchcndcd that this praaige of  
the Treasury has in {ome c_aICS been essential to  
the due course of the public service.  
Every good judge will be sensible that from  
the infufficiency of individual Capitals to such  
large advances as the {upplies of an army re­  
quire, it was indifpenfible to the obtaining them,  
that anticipations from the Trealury -should  
enable the Contraltors to do what oysh.cyrwxfe  
they would-have been unable to do ; and that  
these anticipations must-also have had the effett  
of pmg:ghg {fupplies on cheaper terms to  
the United States. ¢  
  
When it is considered too that the army has  
operated for several vears palt, at the distance of  
five or fix hundred miles from the feat of gov­  
ernment, and a considerable part of the year  
from the rudencfs of the country and obstruc­  
tions of waters, it i impraticable to tran(mit  
monies to the scenes of payment—it will be  
perceived that without advances from the Trea­  
sury in anticipation of their pay, not onlyacom­  
pliance with the engagements of the government  
would have been impossible, but the troops  
must have been always left unrealonably in ar­  
rear. In June 1794, Congress, pafled a law  
declaring that the army thould 1n future be  
paid in such ﬂ&quot; -aer as that the arrears thould  
not exceed two months—Compliance with this  
regulation renders anticipations at certain sea­  
sons matters of physical necessity : yet that law  
gave no {pecial authority for that purpole.  
A particular case, by way of example, in  
which, diftinét from general rules, advances or  
anticipations in the War Department are neces­  
sary, refpeéts the recruiting services of the offi­  
cers detached on this service, who are for a long  
time distant from their corps, require the ac­  
commodation of an advance of pay to be able  
to discharge their duty. Towards the possibili­  
ty of ‘enlifting men, it is indispensable they  
should carry with them the beunty money, and  
this upon conje&amp;ture of what may be done, and  
with the possibility that from not being able to  
obtain the men, the ultimate expenditure may  
not take place. This instance will suggest to  
refleftion an infinite number of cases, in the  
course of the public feivice, in which a dis­  
bursement from the Treasury mus precede the  
execution of the objeét, and may excced the {um  
finally requisite for it.  
These cales indicate the expediency and even  
neceflity of the confirution which has regulated  
the prattice of the Treasury. And it might be  
{hewn, if neceflary, that it is analogous to the  
praftice under the former government of the  
United States, and under other governments ;  
and this too where the theory of expenditures  
1, as exprc_’/éd in our Constitution, that no  
money shall be expended, but in consequence of  
an appropriation by law.  
It remains to fee whether this rule of condut,  
{o indispensable in the praflice of the Depart­  
ment, be permitted by a fair interpretation of  
the constitution and the laws.  
The general injunttion of the Conflitution  
(Article I. IX.)ls, that ¢no money shall be  
drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of  
appropriations made by law.” ]  
The qucltion upon the clause is, whether,  
when an appropriation has been made for a  
particular {ervice or {upply, the aétual disburse­  
ment from the Treasury mulft follow the service  
or supply, in the nature of payment, or may  
precede it in the nature of an advance ¢ 1 hold  
the last conftruftion which Is, that adopted by  
the T&#x27;reafury to be the true one.  
The claafe just cited appears to me to be  
exaltly equivalent to this other claufe—*¢ No  
money shall be drawn from the Trealury but  
for which there ils an appropriation made by  
law,” in other words, before meney can legally  
issue from the Treasury for any purpose, there  
must be a law authorifing an expenditure, and  
designating the objet and the fund. This be­  
ing done, the disbursement may be made con­  
fitently with the Constitution, either by way  
of advance or anticipation, or by «&#x27;ay of pay­  
ment. It may precede or fellow the service,  
supply, or other objeét of expenditure. Either  
will equally fatisfy the words, ¢ in consequence  
of,”” which are not words of ftrift import, but  
may be taken in {everal fenfes—ln one sense,  
that is ‘¢ in consequence of’’ a thing, which |  
being bottomed upon it, follows 1t iz order of  
teme.  
A difbur{ement must be eitheran advance or 1  
anticipation of a payment—&quot; Tis not presumable,  
that the Constitution meant to diftinguith be­  
tween these two modes of difburfement—lt’  
must have intended to leave this matter wholly  
to convenignce. ,  
The design of the Conflitution in this provi­  
sion, was, as 1 conecive, to secure thofle im­  
portant ends, that the purpose, the lLimit, and.  
the_fund of every expenditure should be alcer-.  
tained by a previous law. The public {ecurity  
is complete in this particular, if no money can  
be expended but for an obje(t to an extent and  
out of a fund, which the laws have prescribed.  
Even in cases, which effe@ only individual  
interefls, if the terms of a law will bear several  
meanings, that 1s to be preferred, which will’  
best accord with convenience. In cases: which  
concern the public, this rule 1s applicable with  
still greater lautude.—Public gonvt:x_liencc 15 to  
be promoted, public inconvenicnce 1s to be a­  
voided. The business of adminiltration requires  
accommodation to so great a variety of circum­  
stances that a narrow conftruftion would 1n  
countless instances arrest the wheels of govern­  
ment. » i i  
1t has been shewn, that the conftruftion  
which has been adopted at the Trealury, is in  
many cafcs essential in praélice.—This mclines  
the {cale in favour of it—the words ‘77 conse­  
quence of admitting of various &#x27;ﬁgn:ﬁtatxgns, g

TUESDAY, Dectmber 8, 1795.  
  
. The pralice ot the Legislature, as to appro­  
priation laws, favo vrs this conftruion,  
These laws are § jenerally diftin&amp; from those  
which create the ca use of expenditure. Thus  
the att which decla: &quot;es that the President shall  
be allowed at the rat ¢ of twenty-five thousand  
doliars per annum, t! lat which declares that each  
Senator and Reprefer wtative shall be entitled to  
{o much per day, that which determines that  
each Officer and Soldi. ¢r shall have so much per  
month, &amp;c.—neither 0.! these afts is an a&amp;t of  
appropriation. The T ‘eafury has not conceiv­  
ed itlelf auihorifed to - apend a firgle zent upon  
ti. sufis of any such att ;&#x27; wegarding it merciyas  
conilituting a claim upon .the government for  
a certain compensation, but’ requiring prior to  
an aftual disbursement for {uch claim, that a  
law be passed authorifing the disbursement out  
of a special fund. This is what 1s considered  
as the law, by which the approjination is made ;  
from which results to the public a double se­  
curity. :  
  
Hence every year a particular a&amp;t (sometimes  
more than one) 1s pafled appropriating certain  
{fums for the various branches of the public  
service, and indicating the funds from which  
the monies are to be drawn. The objefd, the  
Jum and the fund are all that are to be found in  
the alls., They are commonly, if not univer­  
sally silent as to any thing further.  
This I regard as conftruftive of the clause in  
the Constitution. The appropriation laws are  
in execution of that provision, and fulfil all its  
purpofles.— And they are silent as to the dif­  
tinétion between anticipation and payment in  
other words as to the manner of disbursement.  
Hence 1 conclude if there exists a law appro­  
priating a certain sum for the salary of the  
President, an advance upon that sum in antici­  
pation of the service, ils as conflitutional as a  
payment after the {ervice has been performed ;  
i other words, the advance of a quarter’s  
salary-at the beginning of a quarter is as much  
warranted by the Conlflitution as the payment of  
it at the end of the quarter.  
It is in this sense that the present Secretary  
of the Treasury has affirmed, that not one dollar  
has at any time been advanced for the use of  
the President for which there was not an exist­  
ing appropriation. He did not fay that no  
money had been advanced in anticipation of  
the service ; for the fa€t is otherwise ; but  
nothing is more true than that the sums difbur{-  
ed were within the limit of the {ums appropna­  
ted. If there was an excess at the end of one  
year, there had been a previous appropration  
for a succeeding year, upon which that excels  
was an advance.  
  
Itis objefted to this praflice, that the death  
of the party between the advance to him and  
the expiration of an equivalent term of service,  
by fuperceding the objett of the advance, would  
render it a mifexpenditure of so much money,  
and therefore a violation of the Confiitution.  
I answer, that the {ame cafluality might have  
the fame affeét in other cases, in which 1t would  
be against common {enfe to suppose that an ad­  
vance might not be made with legality and pro­  
pricty,  
Suppose for example, a law was to be passed  
direfting a given quantity of powder to be pur­  
chased for public use, and appropriating a defi­  
nite sum for the purchase, and I}:lppofc intelh­  
gence to the Secretary. of the Trealury, that the  
quantity required could be procured for prompt  
-payment at Bofton—lt cannot in {fuch a case be  
doubted, that the full sum approprated might  
be legally advanced to an agent to proceed to  
Boften to make the purchase—yet the agent  
might die, and the money never be applied ac­  
cording to its destination, or the desired quanti­  
ty might be procured for a /e/s sum and a balance  
remain in his hands,  
In either case there would be money drawn  
Sfrom the Treasury, which was not applied to  
the objeét of the law ; in the lait cale there is  
no final objeét for the disbursement because the  
balance is a surplus. This proves that the pol­  
fibility of a failure or falling short of the ob­  
je&amp;t, for which an advanceif made, 15 not an  
objefion to its legality. Indeed the conle­  
quence is a possible one in every cale of an.an­  
ticipation, whether to contraftors or to otb,  
public agents, for a determined or indetermyned  
purpose, g  
The consequence is, that the {un; unapplied  
&#x27;muft be amccounted for and refanded. This  
diftintion here&#x27;again 1 thWCP_n an advance and  
apayment —More caunot certainly be finally  
paid than is equal to this obje@ of an appropria­  
tion, though the {ium appropriated exceed the  
sum necessary. Z#ut ‘more may be advanced to  
the full exteye of the appropriation, than may  
be ultimaiely exhausted by the objett of the ex­  
penditite, on the condition which always attends  
an zZdvamce, of accounting for the application  
apd refunding an excess. This 1s a direét an­  
{wer to the question, whether more can be &#x27;paid  
than 1s necellary to fatisfy the objeét of an ap­  
propriation. More cunnot be pa:d, but more  
may be advanced, on the accountability of the‘  
person to whom it is advanced.

But nifk of loss to the public may attend the  
*principle : this is true, but 1t is as true in all the  
cafles of advances to contraftors &amp;c. as in those  
of advances upon salaries and compensations—-  
nor does this point of lifk affeft the queflion of  
legality ; it rouches merely that of the prudent  
exercise of discretion. When large sums are  
advanced, i3¥ usual to obtain security for their  
due applicauon or for indemnification. This  
fecuritv 1s greater or less, according to the cir­  
ﬁqu‘i ‘=&lt;s of the parties 1o whom e advances  
ar¢ mude ; when Imall sums are advanced espe­  
cially if for purpoles qaickly fulfilled, and to  
persons who are themlclves adequate f{ureties,  
| uo collated security is demanded—the head of  
the department is responsible to the govern­  
ment for observing proper measures and taking  
proper precautions. If he alts so as 10 incur  
Jultly the charge of imprudence or profufion,  
he may be dismissed or punifled according to  
the nature of his milcondu&amp;. &#x27;  
Bat the principle which is set up would, it  
1s {aid, be produttive of confufion, distress, and  
bankruptcy at the Treasury ; since the appio­  
priation for the support of government is made  
payable out of the accruing duties of each  
year, and an effablilked right, 1n the officers of  
government to claim their compensations, cither  
on the firft day of the year, or on the firft day  
of a quarter before the feivices was rendered,  
would create a demand at a time when there  
might and poflibly there would not be a single  
{hilling in the Treasury arising out of the ap­  
propriations to fatisfy it.*  
It is not pretended, that there is an effablified  
r2g/ht in the officers to claim their salaries by  
anticpation, at the beginning of a {\cur, or at  
the beginning of a quarter. vo such  
nght exifls.~—The performance of the ser­  
vice must precede the right to demand pay­  
ment. But it does not follow that because  
there is no right in the officer to demand pay­  
ment, it may not be allowable for the Treasury  
to advance upon account for good realons. A  
discretion of this fost in the head of the depart­  
ment can at least involve no embarrassment to  
the Trealury, none of the formidable evils indi­  
cated, for the oficer who makes the advance be­  
ing him(elf the judge whether there is a com­  
petent fund, and whether it can be made with  
convenience to the Treasury he will only make  
it, when he perccives that no evil will ensue.  
Let me recur to the example of advances to  
contrattors for supplying the army. Suppose  
that 1n the terms ofp contralt certain advances  
were stipulated and made ;—but it turned out  
nevertheless, that the contraftor, disappointed  
in the funds on which he bad relied, could not  
execute his contra&amp;t without further advances.  
Here there would be no right on his part to de­  
niand such further advances, but there would be  
a discretion in the Treasury to make them.  
This is an example of a discretion to do what  
there is not a right to demand. The exiflence  
of this discretion can do no harm, because the  
head of the Treasury will judge whether the  
state of 1t permits the rc?uircd advances. But  
it is eflfential, that the discretion should exist,  
becaule otherwise there might be a failure of  
supplies, which no plan that could be substituted  
might be able to avert. _  
Yet the discretion 1s in neither case an arbi­  
tary one—lt is one which the head of the  
Department is relponfible to exercise with a  
careful eye to the public interest and fafety.  
The abuse of it, in other words the careleflnefs  
and wanton_exercile of it would be a cause of  
difmiffion for incapacity or of punishment for  
mal-conduét.  
  
Thus advances on account of salaries, or to  
contraftors for procuring public fupp’xics might  
be carried so far,and so improvidcm‘ly managed  
as to be highly culpable and faftly puniﬁ}aéle‘:  
but this is a diftin&amp; queftin from the violation  
of Constitution or la*, in all the cases, it is a  
compleat an&amp;ver. ¢o the objetlion of embarrafl­  
ment to the “reafyry, that not the will of the  
l parties put the judgment of the head of the de-  
P.atitment, is the rule and mealure of the advan­  
ces, which he may make, within the bounds of  
the sums appropriated by law.  
I confider the law which has been cited with  
regard to the pay of the army, as a legislative  
recognition of the rulc of praftice at the Trea­  
sury. The Legislature could not have been ig­  
norant that it was impratticable at certain sea­  
sons of the year, to convey the money to the ar­  
my ; to fulfil their direftion, without an ad­  
vance from the Treasury beforé the pay be­  
come due. They preluppole a rnight to make  
this advance, and enjoin that the troops shall  
not be left more than two months in arrcar.  
The origin of this law enforces the observa­  
tion. It is known that it passed in consequence  
of reprelentanons, that the pay of the army was  
left too long in arrear, and 1t &#x27;was intended to

quicken the measures of payment. No person  
ineither house of the Legislature, I believe,  
doubted that there was power to precede the  
service by advances, so as to render the pay­  
ment even more punétually than was enjoined.  
Indeed such advances, when the army opera­  
ted at a distance, were neceflary to fulfil the  
contraét with it. Its pay became due monthly,  
and in ftriftriefs of contralt was to be made at  
the end of each month, a thing impoflible un­  
less advanced from the Treasury before it be­  
came due. No special authority was however,  
ever given for this purpose to the Trealury, but  
Itappears to have been left to take its course  
-on the principle, that the disbursement might  
take place as I:)on as there was an appropriation,  
though in anticipation of the term of service.  
The foregoing obfervatiovs vindicate, 1 trust,  
the conftruttion of the Treasury as to the power  
of making disbursements in anticipation of servi­  
ces and {upplies, if there has been a previous  
appropriation by law for the objedl, and if the  
advances never exceed the amount appropria­  
ted; and at the fame time evince, that this  
praflice involved no violation of the constitu­  
tional provision with refpett to appropriations.  
I proceed to examine that clau{fe which ref­  
pelts the pay of the President. It isin these  
words :—*¢ The President shall at stated times  
receive for his services a compenf{ation, which  
shall neither be increased nor diminithed during  
the period for which he shall have been eleéted,  
and he shall not receive within that period any  
other emolument from the United States or a­  
ny of them.”  
I underitand this clause as equivalent to the  
following : ¢ There shall be established by law  
for the services of the President, a periodical  
compenjation, which shall not be increased nor  
diminished during the rorm for which he shall  
have been elefted, and necither the United  
States nor any slate shall allow him any emola­  
ment in addition to his periodical compensa­  
tion.”  
  
This will, T think, at firlt fight appear fo­  
reign tothe question of a provzfional advance by  
the Treasury, on account of the com(penfation  
periodically eftablifbed by law for his {ervices.  
The manifelt obje@ of the provision is to  
guard the independence of the President from  
the legislative controul of the United States or  
of any state, by the ability to withhold, lessen,  
or increase his compensation.  
It requires that the law shall assign him a de­  
finite compensation for a definite time : It pro­  
hibits the Legislature from increasing or dimin­  
tthing this compensation, during any term of  
his eleftion, and it prohibits every slate from  
granting him an additional emolument. This  
1s all that the clause imports.  
It is therefore {atisficd as to the United States,  
when the Legislature has provided that the  
President shall be allowed a certain sum for a  
certain term of time,—and so long as it refrains  
from making an alteration in the provision.  
All beyond this is extraneous to the fubje@s.  
The Legislature having done this, an advance  
by the Treasury in anticipation of the service  
cannot be a breach of the provifion.—&#x27;Tis in  
no {enfe&#x27;an additional allowance by the United  
States.—’T&#x27;is 2 mere advance upon account of  
the established periodical compensation. Will  
legal ideas or common parlance warrant the giv­  
ing the denominations of additional compenfa­  
ticn to the mere anticipation of the term of an  
established allowance ? If they will not, tis  
plain such an advance is no breach of this part  
of the conflitution. &quot;  
If the claofe is to be underfiood literally, it  
ieads to an absurdity. The terms are : ¢ The  
President shall at slated times receive, &amp;c. And  
again: *‘“He shall 7ot receive within that pe­  
rod,” &amp;c.  
His allowance is at the rate of 25,000 dollars  
per annum, 6250 dollars quarter yearly, Sup­  
pose at the end of a year an arrear of 5000 dol­  
lars was due to him, which he omits to receive  
till some time in the {ucceeding year, and in the  
succeeding year aftually receives that balance  
with his full salary for the last year, ‘’tis plain  
that he would not /eve received in the whole  
more than he was allowed by law, and yetin  
the fated period of one year he would 4ave re­  
cerved go,ooo dollars, five thousand more than  
his salary for the year. Ina literal sense then  
the con(l’i;utional provision as to aftual payment  
would not have been complied with ; for with­  
in the firlk of the fated periods he would not  
#ave recetved the compensation allotted and  
within the second of them he would have re­  
cezved more. Inaliteral sense, it would be ne­  
ceflary to make the payment at the precise day,  
to the precise amount, neither more nor less ;  
which as a genera! rule the indifpenfible forms  
of the Treasury rendcr impossible. It follows,  
that aftual receipt and payment are not the cri­  
terion, but the absolute definitive allowance by  
law. An advance before hand or a payment  
afterwards, are equally consistent with the true  
spirit and meaning o{ this part of the conftiti­  
tion.  
Let us now fee if the conftruftion of the  
Trealury violates the law which establishes the  
President’s compensation : &#x27; :  
The att of the 24th of September, 1789, al­  
lows to the President at the rate of ‘23,000  
dollars per annum, to commence from the time  
of his-entering on the duties of his office, and  
to be paid quarterly out of the Treasury of the  
United States.” Soh  
  
The question is, what is to be underflood by  
these words, ¢ 20 be paid quarterly out of the  
Ireafury of the United States #”  
The&#x27; conception of the Treasury has been  
that these words, as used in this and in the ana­  
logous cases; were meant to define the time  
tuhen the right of an individual to the compen-  
Jation earned became due ; not as a command of  
the Trealury to #/fuc the money at the precise day  
ard no other. (Rt  
- As mentioned ‘above, the indefpenfible so rm  
  
of the Treasury, in compliance with the ‘law  
establishing the department, and to secure a. due  
accountability, make it impratlicable to p2y at  
the day ; and if expreflions of the kind 1n ques­  
tion are to be construed literally and as a posi­  
tive injuntion to the Treasury. to issue. the mo­  
ney at the period defined, 1t will be 2is much a  
breach of the law to pay afterwards as to ad.  
vance before hand.  
The position that an after payroent would be  
a breach of the law, will hardly be contended  
for ; and if not, the alternative: {eems to be,  
the confiru@ion adopted by the Trealury.  
Such expreflions denote fim ply that at certan  
periods individuals acquire a. perfe@ right to  
particular sums of money for their services,  
which it becomes a matter of course to pay ;  
but they are not obliged to receiveit at the day ;  
nor is the Trealury reftransed from paying it  
afterwards ; or from anticispating by way of ad­  
vance, if there are adequiste reasons for such  
anticipation.  
It is not true, as allege:d, that the invariable  
prattice of the Treasury as to compensations for  
Jervices, differs in principle from what was done  
in the case of the President, Instances to the  
contrary have been slated. As to what regards  
the army, there has been {ufficient explanation.  
But it will be ufeful to be more particular as  
to the course which &#x27;aas been pursued with re­  
ference to the two Ipufles of Congress., &#x27;  
The law that regalates their compensations,  
(pafled the 29th of Sept.-1789) allows to each  
member a com penlation of fix dollars for every  
day he shall attend the Houle to which he be­  
longs, together with fix dollars for every 20  
miles of distance to and from his place of resi­  
dence, and direfls that the compenfztion which  
shall be due shall be certified by the President,  
of the Senate, or Speaker of the House of Re­  
presentatives, and shall be passed as public ac­  
counts and paid out of the Treasury. -  
  
By an arrangement between each House and  
the Treasury Department, the course a&amp;ually  
pursued has been as follows :  
Certain gross sums, usually at the commence­  
ment of each feflion, and from time to time af­  
terwards, have been advanced from the Trea­  
sury at request, to the Secretary of the Senate  
for the members of the Senate, to the Speaker  
of the House of Representatives for the mem­  
bers of that House, on account and frequently  
in anticipation of their accruing compepfations.  
The Secretary of the Senate, and the Speak­  
ers of the House of Representatives, disbursed  
the monies to the individuals, and afterwards  
upon the close of each {eflion fettled an account  
at the Treasury, accompanied with the certifi­  
cates required by law, and the receipts of the  
members, which were examined, adjusted, and  
pafled as other public accounts. They also re­  
funded to the Treasury, the monies which re­  
mained in their hands, refpeélively beyond the  
compensations due to the members ot the Sen­  
ate and House of Representatives, as will ap­  
pear by referring to the printed statements an­  
nually laid before Congrels.  
¢¢ Whether there were any advances aftually  
made to the members, in anticipation of their  
compensations, was a point never discussed be­  
tween the Treasury and the Officers of the two  
Houses, with whom the money was deposited ;  
but I understand that examples of {fuch advances  
did exist in relation to the House of Represen­  
tatives. The faft Is, however, immatenial to  
the point in iflue. That must be tested by the  
times of the advances from the Treasury ; and  
it is also certain that these were atually made  
in anticipation of compensations to grow due ;  
-and it 1s also certain, that the course was well  
understood by both Houses of Congrels, and is  
exhibited by the accounts of the Treasurer laid  
before them in each session.  
If therefore the advances for the President  
were unconstitutional and illegal, those for both  
Houses of Congress, were equally so ; and if  
the President be chargeable with a violation of  
the Conflitution, of the laws, and of his oath of  
office, on account of extra advances to his Se­  
cretaries, whether with or without his privity,  
the members of both Houses of Congress with.  
out exception have been guilty of the fame  
crimes, in consequence of the extra advances  
with their privity to the officers of their respec­  
tive Houses.  
A diftin&amp;tion may possibly be attempted to be  
taken in the two cases, from this circumflance  
i—that the law which allots the compensation  
~of the members of the two Houses does not use  
the words ¢ to be paid every day out of the  
Treasury”” while that which establishes the Pre­  
sident’s compensation does use the terms ¢to be  
paid quarterly out of the Treasury.” But this  
‘diﬁin%kion would be evidently a cavil-——when a  
law fixes the term of a compensation, whether  
per day, per month, per quarter, or perannum,  
if it fays nothing more, it is implied that it is  
payable, in the fame sense as if this was ex­  
pressly said.—This observation applies as well  
to the monthly pay of the army as to the daily  
pay of Congress. The motive to the arrange­  
meat which was made for the payment of Con­  
gress was two fold. It was to obviate embar­  
rassment to them by facilitating and accelerating  
the receipt of their compensations, and to avoid  
an inconvenient multiplication of adjustments,  
entries, warrants, and payments. The :Ixeory  
of the provision admitted of as many Treasury  
settlements, entries, warrants, and paymeants,  
each day, as there were members in both Hou- l  
fes.  
  
Having examined the question as it flands  
upon the constitution and the laws, I progeed to  
examine the course of the faft. = =~ &amp; .  
But previous to this I shall take notice of one  
point about which there has been doubt, and  
which was not definitively fettled by the ac­  
counting officer of the department until after  
the President’s firft term of four years was  
completed. It refpe@s the time of the com­  
mencement of the President’s compensation—  
  
the law eftablithing it, refers to the time of Lis |  
entering upon the duties of his office, but with­  
out defining that time.  
When in a constitutional and legal sense, did  
the President entér upon the duties of his office ?  
The conflitution enjoins that before he enters  
upon the execution of his office, he {hall take  
a certarn oath, which 1s prescribed. This oath  
was not taken till the goth of Apnl, 178¢. If  
we date the entrance upon the duties of his of­  
fice at the time of taking this oath, it determines  
the epoch to be goth Apnl, 178 g.  
But there is room for another conftruion.  
The 4th of March, 1789, 1s the day when the  
term for which the Prelident, Vice-President,  
and the members of Congress, were firft eletted,  
was deemed to commence. The Conflitution de­  
clares that the President shall hold his office for  
four years ; and it is presumable that the clause  
refpefting his compensation contemplates its be­  
ing for the whole term for which he is to hold  
his office. Its objet may otherwise be evaded.  
  
It s also, 1 believe, certain that the President  
may execute his office and do valid afts as Pre­  
sident, without previously taking the oath pre­  
{cribed ; though in of doing, if voluntary, he  
would be guilty of a breach of the constitution  
and would be lhable to punishment. The ta­  
king of the oath is not therefore necessarily, the  
criterion of entering upon the duties of office.  
On the strength ot these fatis, 1t may be ar­  
gued that by force of the Conflitution, during  
the commencement of the Prefdent’s term of  
service on the gth of March, 1789, the law  
re{pefting his compensation ought to be consi­  
dered as referring to that period for a virtual  
entrance upon the duties of his office.  
In stating this construction, howeverequitable  
it may be deemed I must not be underiiood to  
adoptit. I acknowledge that the other as most  
agreeable to the more familiar sense of the terms  
of the law has appeared to me preferable, and  
it was accordingly established, though not tll  
after all the advances, for the firft four years  
had been made. The result in point of fa&amp;t  
would however have varied as the one or the  
other had been deemed the true conftrution.  
I return to an examination of the course of  
the tranfaftion. &#x27;  
Authentic statements which have been publish­  
ed with some f{upplementary cnes received  
from the Treasury upon the occasion, exhibit  
the following results :  
FIRST RESULT.—The sums advanced for  
the use of the President, from the Treasury, have  
never exceeded the sums previously appropriated  
by law ; though they have some times exceed­  
ed, some time fallen thort of, the sums aftually  
due for services. This is thus explained :

rate attention to dates shews particularly that  
there was always a pre-exifting appropriation  
which was never exceeded by the disbursements,  
having regarded to order of time.  
The rel?due of the proposition is illustrated  
by the quarterly flatement of salary and advan­  
ces as foot. -  
ed. RESULT. The Treasury never has been  
in advance for the President beyond the sums  
altually accrued, and duc to him jfor services to  
  
the amount of ene quarters salary. The large#t  
advance at any one time is 6, 134 dollars, a  
quarter’s salary is 6,250 dolars.  
The particulars of this result appear in the  
aonexed flatement. Tlais statement is digelted  
by quarters of the calender year, which is the  
eftablithed course of the Trealury, and a course  
essential to the order c/F its affairs ; thatis to fay,  
it is cflential there thould be certain fixed pen.  
ods to which the ord&#x27;inary slated difbuifements  
are referred, and in conformity with which the  
accounts of the Trealury are kept.  
3d. RESULT. C% the firft of O&amp;oker, 1795  
there was allually clue to the President for his  
compensation over&#x27;and above all advances for his  
use, the sum of 846 dollars. This likewise ap­  
pears from the flatzmentsar, foot,, and entirely  
I refutes the malevo/lent fuggeflionof an-accumy­  
lation of advances to twelve or fifteen thouland  
} dollars. .  
4th. RESULT. The sums advanced for the  
President prior to the commencement of the term  
‘ of kis second cleclion the gth of March, 1793 fali  
short of the sums appropriated for his compenfu~  
tion 2,850 dollars, thus :  
The aggregate of the sums appro­  
priated for four years from the 2gth  
Sept. 1789, to the 23d Dec. 1791 in­  
clusive, is Dollars 100,000  
The amount of all the sums advan­  
ced prior to the 4th March, 1793 is 97,150  
Excess of appropriations beyond ad­  
vances, 2,850  
  
It 1s nevertheless true that not only there  
have been frequent anticipations of the Prcfi­  
dent’s salary (as appears more particularly 1  
the statement at foot) but counting from the  
goth of April 1789, at the commencement of  
his compensation, the {fums advanced for his use  
te the gd of Maich 1793, the expiration of his  
hirft term of eletion, exceed those attually due  
up to that period by 1042 dollars and 69 cents,  
If on the contrary the confiru@ion were  
adopted which dates his compensation on the  
4th of March 1789, there would have been a  
t balance due to bjm,gp;glggﬁoggh of Marchl79y  
of 2,850 dallig’ &quot;&gt; ¢ o S  
{ But proceeding on the firft &#x27;fuppofition, the  
whole question fill turns upon the legality of  
advance—ls it was legal to make him advance  
in anticipation of his salary within any period of  
his elettion—within one quarter on account of  
a succeeding quarter—it was equally legal to do  
it within one year on account of a succeeding  
year, and within one term of ap elettion on ac­  
count of a succeeding term. The only enquiry  
would be in either case—Will the sum advan­  
ced be within the bounds of the sums before  
that time appropriated ? It has been seen that  
the {ums appropriated for the firft four years of  
{ervice exceed those advanced priorto the com­  
mencement of the second period of elettion by  
2,850 dollars. Besides this, on the 28th of  
February 1793 there was a further approgria­  
tion oi 2,500 dollars so that at the beginning og‘  
the {econd term the total appropriation exceed­  
ed the total disbursements by 27,850 dollars.  
Thus has 1t been shewn, that the advances for  
the use of the President have been governed by  
a rule of conftrufiion which has obtained in  
analogous cases, or more truly which has regu­  
lated the general course of difbur{fements from  
the Trealury, a rule which, I trust, has been  
demonfirated to be ¢onfonant with the conflitu­  
tion and with the laws.  
It 1s requisite to inquire further whether there  
has been any improper use or rather abuse of  
the discretion which is contended for ; for here  
there is likewise an unquestionable refponcibil­  
ity. It ils seen that the advances have at ng  
time equalled one quarter’s salary.  
I alk, was it unreasonable or unfit, if consti­  
tutional and legal, to afford the President of the  
United States an accommodation to this extent ?  
I pledge my veracity, that I have always un­  
derstood, and to this moment I have good rea­  
lons to be fatisfied, th ‘&amp;e“c&#x27; ices of the  
President, those 6’f3{r‘f§¥l‘{ féb‘&amp;xﬁl;cﬁgnd others  
incident to his official situation, have fully equal­  
led if not on some occasions exceeded the allow­  
ance made to him by the United States. Under  
this convition, especially, how could the head  
of a department hesitate, by /o /mall an accom­  
modation as the advance of less than a quarter’s  
salary, to enable the President of the United  
States to meet his expences as they occurred,  
without being obliged to intrench upon his own  
private resources, or to resort to the expedient  
of borrowing to defray the expences imposed  
upon him by public frtuation ? I knew that no  
possible risk could attend the advance, little  
considerable as it was. The estate of the Presi­  
dent wasan{werable incafe of death orother pre­  
mature vacancy, and abundant for the indemni­  
fication of the Government. ‘  
Reasons of a peculiar kind forbade hesitation  
—namely, the scale of expence was unavoida­  
bly such as to render the income even of what  
1s deemed a large landed property in this  
country a slender auxiliary—Woithout an ad­  
~vance from the Treaflury, it was not improbable  
borrowing might be neceflary—Was it just to  
compel the President to resort to that expedient  
for a purpose in fa&amp; public, at his Krivatc ex­  
pence ? Was it for the dignity of the Nation  
that he should have b‘eénﬂl:)}{pgﬁmkan neceflity  
to an embarralfméit 6f this fore?  
My judgment and feelings answered both  
these questions in the negative. I entertained  
no doubt of the constitutionality or legality of  
the advance—and I thought the making of ir, -  
due the situation ; due to property ;.due to ev­  
ery public consideration connefted with the sub.  
je€t ; Ican never regret it. :  
How far the President was privy to the course  
of advancing, I cannot fay—But it is certain  
they have been all made to his private Secreta

ries upon a gencral arrangement, and not by spe­  
cial dire@ions from him, I think it proper to  
add that very early in the day, and probably be­  
fore any advance was made, on an application  
by Mr. LeAR, for a sum which would confi­  
tute an advance, he qualified it by this oblerva­  
tion, **if in your opinion it can be done with le­  
gality and perfelt propriety ; 1 anlwered, that I  
“had no doubt of either.  
I have been accustomed to think that the re­  
sponsibility, for the due and regular disburse­  
ment of monies from the Trealury, lies exclu­  
sively with the officer of that department, and  
that except in a very falpablé and glaring case,  
the charge of blameable participation could not  
fall on any other person.  
As between the officers of the Trealury, 1  
take the responsibility to stand thus—The Sec­  
retary and Comptroller in granting warrants up­  
on the Trealurer, are both anlwerable for their  
legality. In this refpe&amp;, the Comptroller is a  
check upon the Secretary, with regard to the  
expediency of an advance, in my opinion the  
right of judging is exclusively with the head of  
the department., The Comptroller has no  
voice in this matter. So far therefore 2s con­  
cerns legality, in the issues of money, while 1  
was in the department, the Comptroller must  
answer with me, so farasa qucﬂion of expe­  
diency, or the due exercise of discretion may be  
involved, I am solely answerable. And so uni­  
formly, was the matter understood between  
successive Comptrollers and myfelf. So also  
it is eflential to the due administration of the  
department, that it {hould be underflood.  
I have stated my reasons for considering the  
advances made for the ule of the President, as  
conftitationa!,’ legal, and proper. But I pre­  
tend not to infallibility—&#x27;Tis poflible, I may  
have erred. But to convert error into guilt, it  
must be supposed to have been wilful. To  
fuppole it wilful, it is neceflary to trace it to  
some interested or sinister motive, Ilf any ap­  
pears, let it be pointed out. It is not common  
for men to commit crimes of a deep die, with­  
out some adequate inducement,  
- What criminal inducement could have pro­  
bably influenced the rule of conftruttion as to  
advances which has been stated to have been a­  
dopted and aftedupon at the Trealury ? What  
criminal inducement, particularly, could have  
led to the application of this rule to the Presi­  
dent’s compensation in so restricted a form as  
never once to equal one quarter’s salary—Who  
in his senses will believe that the President  
would consciously have hazarded the imputation  
of violating the Conflitution, the laws, and his  
oath of oifice, by imnpofing on the officers of the  
Treaflury, the necessity of making him so paltry  
an advance ; fafely and ridiculously called a  
donation ? Who will believe that those officers  
would have conflented to expose themselves to  
the fame imputation by compliance when they  
knew that the evidence of their guilt mult re­  
§ularly be communicated in each {ucceeding fel­  
ion to both houses of Congress and to the pub­  
licat large ; to believe either, is to believe all  
the partics concerned, foolifh in the sutreme, 3§  
well as profligate in the extreme, deflitute e­  
qually of intellett as of principle.  
To an observation made by Mr. Wolcott on  
the communications from the Treasury, it has  
been answered, that there was no ment in the  
disclosure, because the number of Agents and  
the forms of the Treasury rendered it unavoid­  
able. Thgfalt is so. But the force of the  
observation turns upon the egregious folly of  
intentionally committing the crimes imputed,  
when it was certain beforehand that the means  
of dete@tion must be furnifhed and without de­  
lay by the Treasury itlelf. \
  
It is certain that there never has been  
the least attempt at mystery or concealment,  
The documents reported by the Treasury to  
both Houses of Congrels carried in their face  
the prominent evidence of what was done.  
Frequent and indiscriminate personal suggestions  
revealed the principle of altion. It is cvident,  
that it must have been understood and acquiesced  
in, by all the members of the two Houses of  
Congress.  
Hard would be the condition of public offi­  
cers, if even a miconftrution of constitutional  
- and legal provisions, attended with no {fymptom  
of criminal motive, carrying the proof of inno­  
cence in the openness and publicity of condutt,  
could justly expose them to the odious charges  
avhich on this occasion are preferred ! Harder  
still would be their condition if, in the manage­  
ment of the great and complicated business of a  
pation, the fa&amp; of mifconftruétion which isto  
constitute their guilt is to be decided by the nar­  
row rules of a criticifie, no less pedantic than  
malevolent ! preeminently hard, im such cir­  
eumftances, was the lot of man, who called to  
the head of the most arduous department in the  
public administration, in a new goveroment,  
without the guides of antecedent praftice and  
precedent, had to trace out his own path and to  
adjust for himfelf the import and bearings of

ary, upon a scale which no friend to the reason­  
able respectability of the Chief Magistrate, and  
to national dignitv would wish to see diminish­

In 1795 it will be seen that Mr. Hamilton  
was speaking in the past tense, of the expendi­  
tures of the President exceeding his salary.  
“I pledge my veracity,” says Mr. Hamilton,  
in the paper to which we allude, “that 1 have  
good reason to be satified that the expen?es of  
the President, those of his household, and o­  
thers incident to his official station, have fully
