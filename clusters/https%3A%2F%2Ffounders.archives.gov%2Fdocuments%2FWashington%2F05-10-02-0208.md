My Lord,  
Philadelphia May 1st 1792.  
  
I should have had the honor of acknowledging sooner the receipt of your letter of the 28th of June last, had I not concluded to defer doing it ’till I could announce to you the transmission of my portrait, which has been just finished by Mr Robinson (of New York) who has also undertaken to forward it. The manner of the execution does no discredit, I am told, to the Artist; of whose skill favorable mention had been made to me. I was further induced to entrust the execution to Mr Robinson from his having informed me that he had drawn others for your Lordship and knew the size which would best suit your collection.  
I accept with sensibility and with satisfaction, the significant present of the Box which accompanied your Lordships letter.  
  
In yielding the tribute due from every lover of mankind to the patriotic and heroic virtues, of which it is commemorative, I estimate, as I ought, the additional value, which it derives from the hand that sent it; and my obligation for the sentiments that induced the transfer.  
I will, however ask, that you will exempt me from a compliance with the request relating to its eventual destination. In an attempt to execute your wish in this particular, I should feel embarrassment from a just comparison of relative pretensions, and should fear to risk injustice by so marked a preferenc⟨e⟩. With sentiments of the truest esteem &amp; consideration I remain, Your Lordships Most Obedient Servan⟨t⟩

announce to you the transmission of my portrait,  
which has just been finished by Mr. Robertson (of  
New York), who has also undertaken to forward it.  
The manner of the execution of it does no discredit,  
1 am told, to the artist, of whose skill favorable  
mention has been made to me. I was further in-  
duced to intrust the execution to Mr. Robertson,  
from his having informed me that he had drawn  
others for your Lordship and knew the size which  
best suited your collection. I accept with sensibil-  
ity and satisfaction the significant present of the  
box which accompanied your Lordship’s letter.  
  
In yielding the tribute due from every lover of  
mankind to the patriotic and heroic virtues of which  
it is commemorative, I estimate as I ought the ad-  
ditional value which it derives from the hand that  
sent it, and my obligation for the sentiments that  
induced the transfer. I will, however, ask that you  
will exempt me from compliance with the request  
relating to its eventual destination. In an attempt  
to execute your wish in this particular I should feel  
embarrassment from a just comparison of relative  
pretensions, and fear to risk injustice by so marked  
a preference.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
PORTRAITS OF THE WASHINGTONS. 9  
  
With sentiments of the truest esteem and consid-  
eration, | remain your Lordship’s  
Most obedient servant,  
G. WASHINGTON

## In George Washington's Will there is the following: " Whether easy or not to select the man who might comport with his lordship's opinion in this respect it is not for me to say, but conceiving that no disposition of the valuable curiosity can be more eligible than recommitment of it to his cabinet, agreeable to the original design of the goldsmith's company of Edinburgh, who presented it to him and at his request consented that it should be transported to me, I do give and be queath the same to his lordshop, and in case of his decease to his heir, with my grateful thanks for the distinguished honour of presenting it to me, and more especially for the favorable sentiments which accompanied it"
