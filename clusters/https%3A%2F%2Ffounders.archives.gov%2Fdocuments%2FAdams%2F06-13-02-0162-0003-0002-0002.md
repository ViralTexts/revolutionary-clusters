IX  
Merchants, masters of ships, owners, mariners, men of all kinds, ships and vessels, and all merchandise and goods in general and effects of one of the confederates or of the subjects thereof shall not be seized or detained in any of the countries, lands, islands, cities, towns, ports, havens, shores, or dominions whatsoever of the other confederate for (1)public use, warlike expeditions, or the private use of anyone by arrests, violence, or any color thereof. Moreover it shall be unlawful for the subjects of either party to take anything or to extort it by force from the subjects of the other party without the consent of the person to whom it belongs, which however is not to be understood of that seizure and detention (2) which (3)shall be made by the command and authority of justice and by the ordinary methods on account of debt or crimes in respect whereof the proceedings must be by way of law according to the forms of justice.  
X  
It is further agreed and concluded that it shall be wholly free for all merchants, commanders of ships, and other subjects of their High Mightinesses the States (1)of the seven United Provinces of the Netherlands in all places subject to the dominion and jurisdiction of the said United States of America to manage their own business themselves or to employ whomsoever they please to manage it for them nor shall they be obliged to make use of any interpreter or bro­ker norto pay any salary or fees unless they choose to make use of them. Moreover masters of ships shall not be obliged in loading or unloading their ships to make use of those workmen that may be appointed by public authority for that purpose, but it shall be entirely free for them to load or unload their ships by themselves or to make use of such persons in loading or unloading (2)the same as they shall think fit without paying any fees or salary to any other whomsoever. Neither shall they be forced to unload any sort of merchandises (3) either into other ships or to receive them into their own or to wait for their being loaded longer than they please. And all and every one of the (4) citizens, people, and residents of the said United States of America shall reciprocally have and enjoy the same privileges and liberties in all places whatsoever subject to the dominion and jurisdiction of their High Mightinesses the States (5) of the seven United Provinces of the Netherlands.  
XI  
The merchant ships of either of the parties (1)which shall be making into a port belonging to the enemy of the other ally and (2) concerning whose voyage and the species of goods on board her there shall be just grounds of suspicion shall be obliged to exhibit as well upon the high seas as in the ports and havens not only her passports but likewise certificates expressly showing that her goods are not of the number of those which have been prohibited as contraband. (3)  
XII  
If by (1)exhibiting the above said certificates the other party discover there are any of those sort of goods which are prohibited and declared contraband and consigned for a port under the obedience of his enemy, it shall not be lawful to break up the hatches of such ship or to open any chest, coffers, packs, casks, or any other vessels found therein or to remove the smallest parcel of her goods whether such ship belongs to the subjects of their High Mightinesses the States (2)of the seven United Netherlands provinces (3)orthe citizens or inhabitants of the said United States of America unless the lading be brought on shore in the presence of the officers of the court of admiralty and an inventory thereof made, but there shall be no allowance to sell, exchange, or alienate the same in any manner (4)until after that due and lawful process shall have been had against such prohibited (5) goods, and the court of admiralty shall by a sentence pronounced have confiscated the same, saving always as well the ship itself as any other goods found therein which are to be esteemed free; neither may they be detained on pretence of their being as it were infected by the prohibited goods, much less shall they be confiscated as lawful prize. (6)But if not the whole cargo but only part thereof shall consist of prohibited or contraband goods and the commander of the ship shall be ready and willing to deliver them to the captor who has discovered them, in such case the captor having received those goods shall forthwith discharge the ship and not hinder her by any means freely to prosecute the voyage on which she was bound. But in case the contraband merchandises cannot be all received on board the vessel of the captor, then the captor may, notwithstanding the offer of delivering him the contraband goods, carry the vessel into the nearest port agreeably to what is above directed.  
XIII  
On the contrary, it is agreed that whatever shall be found to be laden by the subjects and inhabitants of either party on any ship belonging to the enemies of the other or to their subjects, the whole, although it be not of the sort of pro­hibited goods, may be confiscated in the same manner as if it belonged to the enemy, except such goods and merchandises as were put on board such ship before the declaration of war (1)or even after such declaration, if so be it were done without knowledge of such declaration so that the goods of the subjects and people of either party, whether they be of the nature of such as are prohibited or otherwise, which as is aforesaid were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war or after the declaration of the same without the knowledge of it, shall no wise be liable to confiscation but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietors (2)demanding the same but (3) so as that if the said merchandises be contraband, it shall not be any ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy.  
The two contracting parties agree that the term of two months being elapsed after the declaration of war, their respective subjects from whatever part of the world they come shall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.  
XIV  
And that more effectual care may be taken for the security of the subjects and people of either party that they do not suffer any injury by the men of war or privateers of the other party, all the commanders of the ships of war and the armed vessels of the said States (1)of the seven United Provinces of the Netherlands and of the said United States of (2) America and all their (3) subjects and peo­ple shall be forbid doing any injury or damage to the other side, and if they act to the contrary they shall be (4)punished and shall moreover be bound to (5) make satisfaction for all matter of damage and the interest thereof by reparation under the pain and obligation of their persons and goods.  
  
  
  
  
XV  
All ships and merchandise of what nature soever which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or robbers (1)on the high seas shall be brought into some port of either state and shall be delivered to the custody of the officers of that port in order to be restored entire to the true proprietor as soon as due and sufficient proofs shall be made concerning the property thereof. (2)  
  
XVI  
If any ships or vessels belonging to either of the parties, their subjects, or people shall within the coasts or dominions of the other stick upon the sands or be wrecked or suffer any other (1) damage, all friendly assistance and relief shall be given to the persons shipwrecked or such as shall be in danger thereof, (2) and letters of safe conduct shall likewise be given to them for their free and quiet passage

For the better promoting of commerce on both sides, it is agreed that if a war should break out between (1) the said two nations, six months after the proclamation of war shall be allowed to the merchants in the cities and towns where they live for selling and transporting their goods and merchandizes; and if anything be taken from them or any injury be done to them within that term by either party or the people or subjects of either, full satisfaction shall be made for the same.  
  
XIX

Contraband  
  
XXV  
This liberty of navigation and commerce shall extend to all kinds of merchandises excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband or prohibited goods; and under this name of contraband or prohibited goods (1) shall be comprehended (2) arms, (3)great guns, (4) bombs with their fuzees and other things belonging to them, fire balls, gunpowder, match, cannon balls, pikes, (5) swords and broadswords, lances, spears, halberds, (6) mortars, pe­tards, grenades, saltpeter, muskets, musket ball, helmets, head pieces, breast-plates, coats of mail, and the like kinds of arms proper for arming soldiers, musket-rests, belts, horses with their furniture, and all other warlike instruments whatever.  
(7)These merchandises which follow (8) shall not be reckoned among contraband or prohibited goods, that is to say, all sorts of cloths and all other manufactures made of wool, flax, hemp, silk, cotton, or any other materials whatever; all kinds of wearing apparel together with the species whereof they are used to be made; gold and silver as well coined as uncoined, tin, iron, lead, copper, brass; as also wheat and barley, and every other kind of corn and pulse, tobacco and likewise all manner of spices, salted and smoked flesh, salted fish, cheese, butter, beer, oils, wines, cider, sugars, syrups, and all sorts of salt; and in general all provisions which serve to the nourishment of mankind and the sustenance of life; furthermore all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, turpentine, ropes, cables, sails, sailcloths, anchors, and any parts of anchors; also ship masts, planks, boards and beams of what trees soever, and all other things proper either for building or repairing ships, and all other goods whatsoever which have not been worked into the form of any instrument or thing prepared for war by land or by sea shall not be reputed contraband, much less such as have already been wrought and made up for any other use; all which shall (9) be wholly reckoned among free goods, as likewise all other merchandises and things which are not comprehended and particularly mentioned in the foregoing enumeration of contraband goods; so that they may be transported and carried in the freest manner by the subjects and citizens of both confederates (10)even to places belonging to an enemy, such towns or places being only excepted as are at that time besieged, blocked up, or invested (11).  
XXVI  
To the end that all manner of dissention and quarrels may be avoided and prevented on both sides, it is agreed that in case either of the parties hereto should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging to the subjects or (1)citizens of the other ally must be furnished with sea letters or passports expressing the name, property or bulk of the ship or vessel as also the name, place or habitation of the master or commander of the said ship or vessel that it may appear thereby that the ship really and truly belongs to the subjects or citizens of one of the parties; which passport shall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this treaty. (2)They shall likewise be recalled every year, that is, if the ship or vessel happens to return home within the space of a year. It is likewise agreed that such ships or vessels being laden (3)are to be provided not only with passports (4)as abovementioned, but also with certificates containing the several particulars of the cargo, the place from whencethe ship sailed and whither she is bound, that so it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship or vessel set sail in the accustomed form, and if any shall think it fit or advisable to express in the said (5)certificates the persons to whom the goods on board belong, he may freely do so. (6)  
XXVII  
The ships or vessels of the subjects or citizens of either of the parties coming upon coasts belonging to either of the said confederates but not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port and not willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, shall not be obliged to give an account of their lading unless they should be suspected or some manifest tokens of carrying to the enemy of the other ally any prohibited goods called contraband:and in case of such manifest suspicion the said subjects and citizens of either of the parties shall be obliged to exhibit in the ports their passports and certificates in the manner before specified.  
XXVIII  
If the ships or vessels of the said subjects or people of either of the parties shall be met with sailing along the coasts or on the high seas by any ships of war, privateers, or armed vessels of the other party, for the avoiding of any disorder, shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send their boats aboard the merchant ship which they shall so meet with and may enter her to the number of two or three men only, to whom the master or commander of such ship or vessel shall exhibit his passport concerning the property of the ship or vessel made out according to the form annexed to this present treaty, and the ship or vessel after such passport (1) has been shown shall be free and at liberty to pursue her voyage, so as it shall not be lawful to molest or search her in any manner, to give her chase, or force her to quit her intended course
