y you then find (“the Task of Glory done”)  
“Thy busy Life at length may be thy own;  
That to thy lov’d Philosophy resigned,  
no Care may ruffle thy unbended Mind.  
Just is the Wish: For sure the happiest Meed,  
To favour’d Man by smiling Heaven decreed,  
Is to reflect at Ease on glorious Pains,  
And calmly to enjoy what Virtue gains.  
For blest is he, who exercis’d in Cares  
To private Leisure public Virtue bears.  
Who tranquil ends the Race he nobly run,  
And decks Repose with trophies Labour won.  
So when thy Country shall no more demand  
The needful Aid of thy sustaining Hand;  
When Peace restored shall on her downy Wing  
Secure Repose and careless Leisure bring;  
Then to the Shades of learned Ease retired  
The World forgetting, by the World admir’d,  
Among thy Books and Friends thou shalt possess  
Contemplative and quiet Happiness;  
Pleased to review a Life in Honour spent  
And painful Merit paid with sweet Content
