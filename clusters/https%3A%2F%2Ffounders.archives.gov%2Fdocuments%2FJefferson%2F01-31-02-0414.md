Allegeney County ss. State Pensa.  
  
Before me the Subscriber a justice of the Peace in and for said County, personally appeared John Gibson Esqr. an associate Judge of same County, who Being duly sworn deposeth and Saith that he traded with the Shawanese and other tribes of Indians then setled on the Siota in the year 1773, and in the Beginning of the year 1774, and that in the Month of April of the same year, he left the same Indian towns, and came to this place, in order to procure some goods, and provisions, that he remained here only a few days, and then set out in Company with a Certain Alexd. Blaine and Mat. Elliot by water to return to the towns on Siota, and that one Evening as they were drifting in their Cannoes near to the Long Reach on the Ohio, they were hailed by a number of White Men on the South West Shore, who requested them to put a Shore as they had disagreeable News to Inform  them of, that we then Landed on Shore and found amongst the party, a Major Angus Mac. Donald from Winchester, a Doctor Woods from same Place, and a party as they said of 150 Men, we then asked the News, they informed us that some of the Party who had Been taken up, and Improving Lands near the Big Konhawa river, had seen another party of white Men, who informed them that they and some others had fell in with a party of Shawnese who had Been hunting on the South west side of the Ohio, that they had Killed the whole of the Indian party and that the others had gone across the Country to Cheat River with the horses and plunder, the Consequence of which they Apprehended would be an Indian War, and that they were flying away. On Making Enquiry of them when this murder shoud have happened, we found that it must have Been some considerable time Before we left the Indian towns, and that there was not the Smallest foundation for the Report, as there was not a Single Man of the Shawnese, But what returned from Hunting long Before this shoud have happened.  
We then informed them that if they woud agree to remain at the place we then were, one of us woud goe to Hock Hockung river with some of their party, where we shoud find some of our People making Cannoes, and that if we did not find them there, we might Conclude that every thing was not right, Doctor Wood and another person then proposed going with me, the rest of the party seemed to agree, But said they woud send and Consult Capt. Cressap who was about two Miles from that Place, they sent of for him, and during the grea[…] part of the Night they Behaved in the Most disorderly Manner threatning to Kill us, and Saying the damned traders were worse than the Indians and ought to be Killed. In the Morning Capt. Michael Cressap came to the Camp, I then gave him the Informat[ion] as above related, they then met in Council, and after an hour or more Capt. Cressap, returned to me and informed that he coud [not] prevail on them to adopt the proposal I had made to them, that as he had a great regard for Capt. R. Callender a Brother in Law of Mine with whom I was connected in trade, he advised me by no means to think of Proceeding any further, as he was convinced the present party woud fall on and Kill every Indian they met [on the] River; that for his part he shoud not Continue with them, But go right across the Country to Red Stone to avoid the Consequences—that we the proceeded to Hockung and went up the same to the Cannoe Place where we found our people at Work and after some days we proceeded to the towns on Siota by Land on our arrival there, we heard of the dift Murders committed by the Party on their way up the Ohio.  
  
This Deponent further saith that in the Year 1774, he accompanied Lord Dunmore on the Expedition against the Shawnese and other Indians on the Siota, that on their Arrival within 15 Miles of the towns, they were met by a Flag, and a White Man of the name of Elliot, who informed Lord Dunmore, that they Chiefs of the Shawnese had sent to Request his Lordship to halt his army and send in some person, who understood their Language, that this Deponent at the Request of Lord Dunmore and the whole of the Officers with him went in, that on his arrival at the towns, Logan the Indian came to where this deponent was Sitting with the Corn Stalk and the other Chiefs of the Shawnese, and asked him to walk out with him, that they went into a Copse of Woods, where they Sat down, when Logan after shedding abundance of tears, delivered to him the Speech, nearly as related by Mr. Jefferson in his notes on the State of Virga., that he this Deponent told him then that it was not Col. Cressap who had Murdered his Relations, and that altho his Son Capt. Michl. Cressap was with the party who killed a Shawnese Chief and other Indians, yet he was not present when his Relations were killed at Bakers near the Mouth of Yellow Creek on the Ohio. that this Deponent on his Return to Camp delivered the Speech to Lord Dunmore; and that the Murders perpetrated as above was considered as Ultimately the Cause of the War of 1774, commonly Called Cressaps war—

“* Allegheny County, .  
“ State of Pe vasyluania. :”  
  
“ Before me the subscriber, a  
justice of the peace in and for said  
county, personally appeared Join  
Gibson, Esq. an associate Judge  
of same county, who, being duly  
sworn, deposeth and saith, that he  
traded with the Shawnese and other  
tribes of [indians then settled on the  
Siota, inthe year 1773, - in the  
beginning ot the year 1774, and  
that in the month of Aprit of the  
same year, he left the same Indian  
towns, and came to this place, in  
order to procure some goods and  
provisions; that he remained here  
only a few days, and then set out,  
in company witha certain Alexan-  
der Blaine and Mr. Elliot, by water,  
to return to the towns on Siota; and  
that one evening as they were drift-  
ing in their canoes near the Long  
Reach on the Ohio, they were hail-  
ed by a number of white men on  
the south-west shore, who request-  
ed them to put ashore, as they had  
disagreeable news to inform them  
of; that we then landed ow shore,  
and found amongst the party a  
Major Angus M‘Donald, from  
West Chester, a Doctor Woods,  
from same place, and a party, as  
they said, of one hundred and fifty  
men. We then asked the news.  
They informed us that some ot the  
party who had been taking up, and  
improving lands near the “Big Kan-  
hawa river, had seen another party  
of white men, who informed them  
that they and some others had fell  
in with a party of Shawnese, who  
had been hunting on the south-  
west side of the Ohio; that they  
had killed the whole of the Indian  
party, and that the others had  
gone across the country to Cheat  
river with the horses and plunder,  
the consequence of which they ap-  
prehended .woyld be an Indian  
  
  
  
war, and that they were flying away.  
On making inguiry of them when  
this murder should have happened,  
we found that it must have eae  
some considerable time betore we  
lett the Indian towns, and that  
there was not the smallest founda-  
tion for the report, as there was  
not a single man of the Shawnese,  
but what returned from hunting  
long belore this suauld have hap-  
pened,  
  
*“ Wethen informed them that  
if they would agree to remain at  
the place we then were, one of us  
would go to Hock Hocking river  
with some of their party, where  
we should find some of our  
  
people making canoes, and that if  
  
we did not fad them there, we  
might conclude that every thing  
was not right. Doctor Woods and  
another person then proposed go;  
ing with me; the rest of the party  
seemed to agree, but said they  
would send and consult Captain  
Cresap, who was about two miles  
from that place. They sent off for  
him, ard during the greatest part  
of the night they behaved in the  
most disorderly manner, threatening  
to kill us, and saying, the damned  
traders were worse than the Indians,  
and ought to be killed. In the  
morning Captain Michael Cresap  
came tothecamp. I then gave him  
the information as above related.  
They then met in Council, and,  
afteran hour or more, Captain Cre;  
sayy returned to me, and informed  
that he could not prevail on them  
to adopt the proposal I had made  
to them; that as he had a great re-  
gard for Captain R. Callender,  
  
brother-in-law of mine, with whom  
I was conneéted in trade, he ad-  
vised me by no means to think of  
proceeding avy further, as he was  
convinced the present party would  
fall on and kill every Indian they  
met on the river; that for his part  
he should not continue with them,  
but go right across the country tq

As the intention is to advance the truth and justice of history, we should  
not omit stating that no doubt exists but that Logan, in his speech to lord  
Dunmore, either confounded the titles of colonel with that of captain, or he  
was mistaken in the person who commenced the series of outrages in which  
his relatives were killed. In the testimony of general Gibson, page 18, it is  
distinctly stated, that, at the time Logan delivered the speech to Gibson, he  
(Gibson) told Logan * that it was not colonel Cresap who had murdered his  
relations, and that although his son, captain Michael Cresap, was with the  
party who killed a Shawanese chief and other Indians, yet he was not pres-  
ent when his relations were killed at Baker’s bottom.”’ ‘Turn to the testimo-  
ny of Ebenezer Zane, page 12, and there it will be seen that it was ‘‘ captain  
Michael Cresap who made the proposition to waylay and kill the Indians on  
the river.” Unless there were relatives of Logan killed above or belo

There are few intelligent persons in  
the civilized world who have not road  
the speeoh of Logan, the Cayuga­  
usually called the Mingo-ohief. and ad­  
mired its simple, pathetio eloquence.  
It will live as long&#x27; as oration on the  
Crown, yet not one in a thousand who  
know it by heart know when and how it  
was made. It may not b( uninterest­  
ing to tell the story as it was told in the  
deposition of John Gibson, the first  
secretary and second Governor of in -  
diana Territory. In 1774, says the de­  
position, Mr. Gibson accompanied Lord  
Dunmore on the expedition against the  
Shawneos and other Indiatis on the  
Scioto; that on their arrival within fif  
teen miles of-the towns they were met  
by a flag and a request thal. some one  
should be sent in who unde ood their  
language, and he went at the request of  
Lord Dunmore and all the officers; that  
on his prrival at the towns, 14ogau, the  
Indian, came to where this deponent

chiefs of the Shawnees, an4 asked him

Here is the Gibson affidavit, made at Pittsburg,  
April 4, 1800. “This deponent further saith that  
in the year 1774 [the year after General Harrison  
was born] he aocompanied Lord Dnnmore on the  
expedition against the Shawanees and other Indi­  
ana on the Scioto; that on their arrival within  
fifteen miles of the towns they were met by a flag.  
  
and a white man by the name of Elliott,  
who informed Lord Dnnmore that the chiefs of  
the Shawanees had sent to request his lordship  
to halt his army and send in some person who  
understood their language; that this deponent,  
at the request of Lord Dnnmore and the whole  
of the officers with him, went in; that, on his ar­  
rival at the towns, Logan, the Indian, came to  
where this deponent was sitting with Cornstalk  
and otherchiefs of the Shawanees, and asked him  
to walk out with him; that they went into a  
copse of wood, where they sat down, when  
Logan, after shedding abundance of tears,  
delivered to him (Gibson) the speech nearly as  
related by Mr. Jefferson in his ‘Notes on the
