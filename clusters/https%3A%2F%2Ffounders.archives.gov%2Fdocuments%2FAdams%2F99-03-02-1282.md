l be done away—All this I know only by hearsay, and the newspapers; for I have not been near Boston since the General Court met.  
My brother has been gone nearly a week upon a tour to Haverhill—I presume he passes his time there as agreeably as here—Miss H. Adams has been here some days; deeply engaged in the compilation of her new work  
In the course of my recent reading I met for the first time some verses by Dr: Donne to his wife, on his being obliged to go to France, and leave her behind in England. They struck me the more forcibly as they are so peculiarly applicable to this painful separation, which we endure  
Our two souls therefore, which are one  
Though I must go, indure not yet  
A breach, but an expansion,  
Like gold to airy thinness beat.  
If they be two, they are two so  
As stiff twin compasses are two;  
Thy soul, the fixt foot, makes no show  
To move, but doth, if t’other do:  
And though it in the center sit,  
Yet when the other far doth rome,  
It leans and hearkens after it,  
And grows erect, as that comes home.  
Such wilt thou be to me, who must  
Like t’other foot, obliquely run:  
Thy firmness makes my circle just,  
And makes me end where I begun—  
The versification is not quite so perfect as it would have been, if written 200 years later, but if I could have sent you any thing half so pretty as the thought, of my own growth, I would not have turn’d copyist even of Donne’s poetry to show you, how

ems of John Donne, D D, about A D 1625.  
As virtuous men pass mildly nwav,  
And whisper to their soula 10 go ;  
Whilst s mte of t ieir sad friends do say  
The breath goes now, and some say no ;  
Fo let us m -1 r and make no nui«e,  
iSo tear-doods, nor sigh tempests move ;  
’Twere profanation of our joys  
To tell the grosser world i ur love.  
Dull sublunary lover’s love  
(Whose soul is sense ) cannot admit  
Absence, because it doth remove  
The tilings which alimented it.  
But we’re by love so much refined,  
That ourselves know not what it is  
(Inter-assured ol the mind )  
Careless eyes, lips and hands :o miss.  
Our two souls therefore, (which are one,)  
Though 1 must go, endure not yet  
A broach, but an expansion,  
Like gtdd to airy thinness beat.  
If they be two, they are tiro so  
As these twin compasses are two i  
Thv soul, the fixed loot, makes no show  
To move, yet doth, if the other do.  
And though it in the center sit,  
Yet, when the other lar doth roam,  
It leans, and hearkens niter it,  
And grows erect as that conics homes  
And such thou srt to me. who must  
Like ih’ other loot, obliquely run;  
Thy firmness makes mv circles just.  
And makes me end where 1 begun.
