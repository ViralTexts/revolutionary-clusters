Camp at Middlebrook March 27th 1779.  
By some interruption of the last Weeks Mail your favor of the 8th did not reach my hands till last Night—Under cover of this Mr Mason (if he should not have Sailed, &amp;) to whom I heartily wish a perfect restoration of health, will receive two letters; one of them to the Marqs de la Fayette &amp; the other to Doctr Franklin; in furnishing which I am happy, as I wish for instances in which I can testify the sincerity of my regard for you.  
Our Commissary of Prisoners hath been invariably, &amp; pointedly instructed to exchange those Officers first who were first captivated, as far as rank will apply; and I have every reason to believe he has obeyed the order; as I have refused a great many applications for irregular exchanges in consequence—and I did it because I would not depart from my principle, &amp; thereby incur the charge of partiality—It sometimes happens, that Officers later in captivity than others, have been exchanged before them; but it is in cases where the rank of the Enemys Officers in our possession, do not apply to the latter—There is a prospect now I think of a general exchange taking place, which will be very pleasing to the parties and their connexions, and will be a mean of relieving much distress to individuals—though it may not, circumstanced as we are at this time, be advantageous to us, considered in a national &amp; political point of view. partial exchanges have, for sometime past, been discontinued by the Enemy.  
Though it is not in my power to devote much time to private correspondences, owing to the multiplicity of public letters (and other business) I have to read, write, &amp; transact; yet I can with great truth assure you, that it would afford me very singular pleasure to be favoured at all times with your sentiments in a leizure hour, upon public matters of general concernment as well as those which more immediately respect yr own State (if proper conveyances wd render prudent a free communication)—I am particularly desirous of it at this time, because I view things very differently, I fear, from what people in general do who seem to think the contest is at an end; and to make money, and get places, the only things now remaining to do—I have seen without dispondency (even for a moment) the hours which America have stiled her gloomy ones, but I have beheld no day since the commencement of hostilities that I have thought her liberties in such emiment danger as at present—Friends and foes seem now to combine to pull down the goodly fabric we have hitherto been raising at the expence of so much time, blood, and treasure—and unless the bodies politick will exert themselves to bring things back to first principles—correct abuses—&amp; punish our internal foes, inevitable ruin must follow. Indeed we seem to be verging so fast to destruction, that I am filled with sensations to which I have been a stranger till within these three Months—Our Enemys behold with exultation &amp; joy how effectually we labour for their benefit; &amp; from being in a state of absolute dispair, &amp; on the point of evacuating America, are now on tiptoe—nothing therefore in my Judgment can save us but a total reformation in our own conduct, or some decisive turn to affairs in Europe—The former alas!—to our shame be it spoken! is less likely to happen than the latter, as it is now consistent with the views of the Speculators—variant tribes of money makers—&amp; stock jobbers of all denominations to continue the War for their own private emolument, without considering that their avarice, &amp; thirst for gain must plunge every thing (including themselves) in one common ruin.  
Were I to indulge my present feelings, &amp; give a loose to that freedom of expression which my unreserved friendship for you would prompt me to, I should say a great deal on this subject—but letters are liable to so many accidents, and the sentiments of men in Office sought after by the enemy with so much avidity, and besides conveying useful knowledge (if they get into their hands) for the superstructure of their plans, is often perverted to the worst of purposes, that I shall be somewhat reserved, notwithstanding this Letter goes by a private hand to Mount Vernon—I cannot refrain lamenting however in the most poignant terms, the fatal policy too prevalent in most of the states, of imploying their ablest men at home in posts of honor or profit; till the great national Interests are fixed upon a solid basis—To me it appears no unjust Simile to compare the affairs of this great continent to the Mechanism of a Clock, each State representing some one or other of the smaller parts of it, which they are endeavouring to put in fine order without considering how useless &amp; unavailing the labour, unless the great wheel, or spring which is to set the whole in motion, is also well attended to &amp; kept in good order—I allude to no particular state nor do I mean to cast reflections upon any one of them—Nor ought I, it may be said, to do so upon their representatives, but as it is a fact too notorious to be concealed, that C—— is rent by party—that much business of a trifling nature &amp; personal concernment withdraws their attention from matters of great national moment at this critical period—When it is also known that idleness and dissipation takes place of close attention and application, no man who wishes well to the liberties of his Country &amp; desires to see its rights established, can avoid crying out where are our Men of abilities? why do they not come forth to save their Country? let this voice my dear Sir call upon you—Jefferson &amp; others—do not from a mistaken opinion that we are about to set down under our own Vine and our own fig tree. let our hitherto noble struggle end in ignominy—believe me when I tell you there is danger of it—I have pretty good reasons for thinking, that Administration a little while ago had resolved to give the matter up, and negotiate a peace with us upon almost any terms, but I shall be much mistaken if they do not Now from the present state of our Currency—dissentions—&amp; other Circumstances, push matters to the utmost extremity—nothing I am sure will prevent it but the interposition of Spain &amp; their disappointed hopes from Russia.  
I thank you most cordially for your kind offer of rendering me Services—I shall without reserve as heretofore, call upon you whenever instances occur that may require it, being with the sincerest regard Dr Sir Yr Most Obedt &amp; Affecte H: Servt  
Go: Washingto

Camp at Middlebrook, &gt;  
March 27th, 1779. &gt;  
Dear Sir : By some interruption of the last  
week&#x27;s mail, your favor of the S:h did not  
reach mv hand* till last night. lTnder cover  
of this,&#x27;Mr. xMason, (if he should not have  
sailed,) to whom I heartily wish a perfect  
restoration of health, will receive two letters:  
one of them to the Marquis de la Fayette. and  
the other to Doct. Franklin, in furnishing  
which 1 am happy, as I wish for instances in  
which 1 can testify the sincerity of my regard  
for you. -  
Our Commissary of Prisoners hath been in­  
variably and pointedly instructed to exchange  
those officers first, who were first captivated, as  
far as rank will apply, and 1 have every rea­  
son to believe he has obeyed the order, as l  
have relused a great many applications for ir­  
regular exchanges in consequence, and 1 did it  
because I would not depart from my principle,  
and thereby incur the charge of partiality. It  
sometimes happens, that officers later in cap­  
tivity than others, have been exchanged before  
them, hut it is in cases where the rank of the  
enemy’s officers in our possession do not apply  
to the* latter. There is a prospect now, I think,  
of a general exchange taking place, which will  
be very pleasing to the parties and iheir con­  
nexions, anti will be a means of leiieving much  
distress to individuals, though it may not, cir­  
cumstanced as we are at this time, be advanta­  
geous to us, considered in a national and politi­  
cal point of view. Partial exchanges have,  
for some time past, been discontinued by the  
  
enemy.  
Though it is not in my power to devote much  
time to private correspondences, owing to the  
multiplicity of public letters (and other busi­  
ness) I have to read, write, and transact, vet I  
can with great truth assure you. that it would  
attord me very singular pleasure to be favored,  
at all times, with your sentiments in a leisure  
hour, upon public matters of general concern­  
ment, as well as those which more immediately  
respect your own state, (if proper conveyances  
would render prudent a free communication.)  
1 am particularly desirous of it, at this time,  
because 1 view things very differently, 1 tear,  
from what people in general do, who seem to  
think that tht contest is at an end. and to make  
money, and to get places, the only thing now  
remaining to do. I have seen without depen­  
dency, (even for a moment.) the hours which  
America has stiled her gloomy ones—but 1  
have beheld no day since the commencement  
of hostilities, that I have thought her liberties  
in such imminent danger as at the present —;  
Friends and toes seem now to combine to puli  
down the goodly fabric we have hitherto been  
raising at the expense of so much time, blood,  
and treasure—and unless the bodies politic will  
exert themselves to bring things back to fiist  
principles, correct abuses, and punish our in­  
ternal foes, inevitable ruin must follow. In­  
deed we seem to he verging so fast to destruc­  
tion, that I am filled with sensations to which  
I have been a stranger, till within these three  
months. Our enemy behold with exultation  
and joy, how effectually we labor for their  
benefit^ and from being in a state of absolute  
despair, and on the point of evacuating Ameri  
ca, are now on tiptoe. Nothing, therefore, in  
my judgment can save us. but a total reforma­  
tion in our own conduct, or some decisive turn  
to affairs in Europe. The former, alas! to our  
shame be it spoken! is less likely to happen  
than the latter, as it is now consistent \iih the  
views of the speculators—various tribes of  
money makers—and stock-jobbers of all de­  
nominations, to continue the war for their ova u  
private emolument, without considering that  
their avarice and thirst for gain, must plunge  
every thing, (including themselves) in one com­  
  
mon rum.  
Were 1 to indulge my present feelings, and  
give a loose to that freedom of expression  
which mv unreserved friendship lor you would  
prompt me to, 1 should say a great deal on tins  
subject. But letters are liable to so many ac­  
cidents, and the sentiments ot men in office  
sought after by the enemy with so much avidi­  
tv, and besides conveying useful knowledge  
(if they get into their hands) for the superstruc­  
ture ot their plans are often perverted to the  
worst of purposes, that I shall be somewhat  
leserved, notwithstanding this letter goes by a  
private hand 10 Mount Vernon. 1 cannot re­  
frain lamenting, however, in the most poignant  
terms, the fatal policy too prevalent in most ot  
the Stales, of employing their ablest men at  
home in posts of honor or profit, till the great  
national interests are fix^d upon a .-olid basis  
To me it appears no unjust r-imiie to compare  
the affairs of this great continent, to the me­  
chanism of a clock, each Sta&#x27;e representing  
some one or the other of the smaller part-ot  
it, which they are endeavoring to put in fine  
order, without considering how useless and  
unavailing their labor, unless the great wheel  
or spring which is to set the wlioie in motion, ;  
is also well attended to and kept in good order.  
I allude to no particular State, nof do 1 mean  
to cast reflections upon any one o§ them—nor  
ought I, it may he said, to do so upon their  
representatives; but as it is a fact too notorious  
to he concealed, that C-i- rent by party—  
that much business of a trifling nature and  
personal concernment withdraws their atten­  
tion from matters of great national moment at  
this critical period—when it is also known that  
idleness and dissipation takes place of c.ose  
attention and application, no man who wishes  
well to the liberties of his country, and desires  
to see its lights established, can avoid cryjng  
out: Where are our men of abilities? Why  
do they not come forth to save *he;r counliv ?  
Let this voice, my dear sir, call upon you, Jeffer­  
son, and others—Do not. from a mistaken opin­  
ion, that we are about to s*t down under our  
own vine and our own fig-tree —let our hither­  
to noble struggle end in ignominy. Believe  
me when l tell you there is danger of it. \\
have pretty good reasons lor thinking, that ad­  
ministration a little while ago. had resolved to i  
give the matter up, and negotiate a peace wi:h  
us upon almost any terms: but 1 shall he much  
mistaken if they do not now, from the present  
state of our currency, distentions, and other  
circumstances, push matters to the utmost ex­  
tremity. Nothing 1 am sure, will prevent it,  
hut the interposition of Spain and their disap­  
pointed hope* from Russia.  
1 thank you, most cordially, for your kind  
offer of rendering me service. I shall, without  
reserve, as heretofore, call upon you whenever  
ins’ances occur that may require it, being w ith  
the sincerest regard, dear sir, your most obedi­  
ent and affectionate humble servant,

without considering how useless and unavailing their labor,  
unless the great wheel or spring which is to set the whole

I allude to no particular State, nordo I mean to cast re-  
flections upon any one of them—nor ought I, it may be  
said, to do so upon their representatives ; but as it is a fact  
too notorious to be concealed, that C—— is rent by party—  
that much business of a trifling nature and personal con-  
cernment withdraws their attention from matters of great  
national moment at this critical period—when it is also  
known that idleness and dissipation takes place of close  
attention and application, no man who wishes well to the  
liberties of his country, and desires to see its rights estab-  
lished, can avoid crying out: Where are our men of abil-  
ities? Why do they not come forth to save their country?  
Let this voice, my dear sir, call upon you, Jefferson, and  
others. Do not, from a mistaken opinion, that we are  
about to sit down under our own vine and our own fig  
tree—let our hitherto noble struggle end in ignominy. Be-  
lieve me when I tell you there is danger of it. I have  
pretty good reasons for thinking, that administration a lit-  
tle while ago, had resolved to give the matter up, and ne-  
gotiate a peace with us upon almost any terms; but I shall  
be much mistaken if they do not now, from the present  
state of our currency, dissentions, and other circumstan-  
ces, push matters to the utmost extremity. Nothing, Iam  
sure, will prevent it, but the interposition of Spain and  
their disappointed hopes from Russia.  
  
I thank you most cordially, for your kind offer of ren-

Camp at Middlebbo( k, ?  
March 27th, 1770. &gt;  
Dear sir—By some interruption of the last  
week&#x27;s mail, your favor of tbe Bth did not reach  
my hands till las. night. Under cover ot this,  
Mr. Mason, (if he should not have sailed) to  
whom I heartily wish a perfect restoration of  
health, will receive two letters—one of them to  
the Marquis de Lafayette, and the other to Dr.  
Franklin, in furnishing which I am happy, as I  
wish tor instances in whioh I can testify the  
sincerity of my regard for you.  
Our Commissary of Prisoners hath been inva­  
riably, and pointedly instructed to exchange  
those officers first, who were first captured, as  
far as rank wili spply, and I have every reason  
to believe he has obeyed the order, as I have  
refused a great many applications for irregular  
exchanges&#x27;in consequence, and* I did it because  
I would not depart from my principle* and  
thereby incur the charge of partiality. It  
sometlm.3 happ.no, that officers later in cap­  
tivity than others have been exchanged before  
them, but it is in cases where the rauks of the  
enemy&#x27;s officers in our possession do not apply  
to the latter. Thereis a prospect now, I think,  
of a general exchange taking place, which will  
be very pleasing to the parties and their con­  
nexions, and will be a means of relieving much  
distress to individual., though it may not, cir­  
cumstanced as we are at this time, be advanta­  
geous to n~, considered in a national and politL  
cal point of view. Partial exchanges have, for  
some time past, been discontinued by the ene­  
my.  
  
Though it is not in my power to devote much  
time to private correspondences, owing to the |  
multiplicity of public letters (and other busi- |  
ness) I have to road, write and transact, yet I ,  
can with great truth assure you, that it would ]  
afford me very singular pleasure to be favored, (  
at all times, with your sentiments in a leisure j  
hour, upon pnblio matters of general concern- j  
ment, as well as these which more immediately ,  
respect your own State, (if proper conveyances j  
would render prudent a free communication,)— ,  
I am particularly desirous of it, at tbis time, be- j  
cause I view things very differently, I fear,from |  
what people in general do. who seem to think &lt;  
that tbe contest is at an end,and to make mon- j  
ey, and to get places, tbe only thiDg now re- &lt;  
mainiog to do. I have seen without despon- 1  
dency, (even for a moment,) tbe hours which j  
America bas styled her gloomy ones—but I have y  
beheld no day since the commencement of hos- ]  
tilities, that I have tboughtber liberties in such  
imminent danger as at the present. Friends  
and foes seem now to combine to pull down tbe  
goodly fabric we have hitherto been rai.iug at  
the expense of so much tin;..blood and treasure  
—and unless tbe bodies politic will exert tbem  
selves to briug things back to first principles,  
correct abuses, and punish our internal loes.in­  
evitable rain mast follow. Indeed, we seem to  
be verging so fast to detraction, that I am fillu  
ed with sensations to wbichl have been a stran- J  
ger, till within these three months. Oar ene­  
my behold with exaltation an&lt;i joy, how effect­  
ually we labor for their benefit, and from being  
in a state of absolute despair, acd on the point  
of evacuating America, are now on tiptoe.— 1  
Nothing, therefore, in ray judgment, can save  
us, hut a total reformation in our conduct, or  
some decisive turn of affairs in Europe. The  
former, alas! to our shame be it spoken !is  
less likely to happen than tbe latter,ae it is now  
consistent with the views of speculators—vari­  
ous tribes of money-makers—and stockjobbers  
of all denominations, to continue the war for  
their own private emolument, without consider,  
ing that their avarice aud thirst for gain must  
plunge everything (including themselves) in one  
coin in &gt;n ruin.  
Were Ito indulge my present feelings, and  
give a loose to that freedom of expression whioh  
my unreserved friendship tor you would prompt •  
me to, I should say a great deal on this subject.  
Bat letters are liable to so rnauy accidents, and  
tbe sentiments of men in office, sought after by  
the enemy with sd muoh avidity, and besides  
convey:Eg useful knowledge, [if they get into  
their hands,] for the superstructure of their  
plans, are often perverted to the worst of pur­  
poses, that I shall be somewhat reserved, not­  
withstanding this letter goes by a private h_nd  
to Mount Vernon. I oannot retrain lamenting,  
however, in the most poignant terms, the fatal  
folicy too prevalent in most of the States, of  
employing tbeir ablest men at home in posts of  
honor or profit, till the great national interests  
are fixed upon a solid basis. To me it appears  
no unjast simile to oompare the affairs of this  
great continent to the mechanism of a clock,  
each State representing some one or other of the  
smaller parts of it, which tbey are endeavoring  
to pnt in fine order, without considering 4pt»w  
useless and unavailing their labor, unless the  
great wheel or ep.iog which is to set the whole  
in motion, is also well attended to and kept in

mean to cast reflections npon any one of them  
—nor ought I, it may be said, to do so upon

that idlenees and dissipation take the place of

Why do they not come forth to save their conn-,

opinion, that we are about to sit down under

me when I tell you there is danger of it. I  
have pretty good reasons for thinknig, that ads

the inte&#x27;po.itico of Spain a__d their disappoint­

I thank you most cordially for your kind of­

Camp at Middlebrook,  
March 27, 1779.  
  
Dear Sir,  
  
By some interruption of the last week’s mail, your favor of the 8 did not  
reach my hands till last night. Under cover of this Mr. Mason (if he should not  
have sailed &amp;c) to whom I heartily wish a perfect restoration of health, will  
receive two letters ; one of these to the Marquis de la Fayette and the other to  
Doctor Franklin ; in furnishing which I am happy, as I wish for instances in which  
I can testify the sincerity of my regard for you.  
  
Our Commissary of Prisoners hath been invariably and pointedly instructed  
to exchange those officers who were first captivated as far as rank will apply ; and  
I have every reason to believe he has obeyed the order; as I have refused a  
great many applications for irregular exchanges in consequence—and I did it be-  
cause I would not depart from my principles and thereby incur the charge of par-  
tiality. It sometimes happens that officers later in captivity than others, have been  
exchanged before them ; but it is in case where the rank of the enemy’s officers  
in our possession, do not apply to the latter. There is a prospect now I think of  
a general exchange taking place, which will be very pleasing to the parties and  
their connexions ; and will be a means of relieving much distress to individuals,

though it may not, circumstanced as we are at this time, be advantageous to us,  
considered in a national and political point of view. Partial exchanges have for  
some time past being discontinued by the enemy.  
  
Though it is not in my power to devote much time to devote much time to  
private correspondence, owing to the multiplicity of public letters (and other busi-  
ness) I have to read, write, and transact ; yet I can with great truth assure you  
that it would afford me very singular pleasure to be favored at all times with your  
sentiments in a leisure hour, upon public matters of general concernment as well  
as those which more immediately respect your own state (if proper conveyances ren-  
der prudent a free communication). I am particularly desirous of it at this time,  
because I view things very differently, I fear, from what people in general do,  
who seem to think the contest is at an end; and to make money and get place, the  
only things now remaining to do. I have seen without despondency (even for a  
moment) the hours which America has stiled her gloomy ones, but I have beheld  
no day since the commencement of hostilities that I have thought her liberties in  
such danger as at present. Friends and foes seem now to combine to pull down  
the goodly fabric we have hitherto been raising at the expense of so much time,  
blood, and treasure—and unless the bodies political will exert themselves to bring  
things back to first principles, correct abuses, and punish our internal foes, inevi-  
table ruin must follow. Indeed: we seem to be verging so fast to destruction, that  
I am filled with sensations to which I have been a stranger till within these three  
months. One beholds with exultation and joy, how effectually we labor for their  
benefit ; and from being in a state of absolute despair, and on the point of  
evacuating America, are now on tiptoe. Nothing therefore in my judgement can  
save us but a total reformation in our own conduct, or some decisive turn to affairs  
in Europe. The former Alas! to our shame be it spoken ! is less likely to happen  
than the latter, as it is more consistent with the views of the speculators—various

mechanism of a clock, each state representing some one or other of the smaller  
parts of it, which they are endeavoring to put in fine order without considering how  
useless and unavailing their labor, unless the great wheel, or spring which is to set  
the whole in motion is also well attended to and kept in good order. I allude to  
no particular state, nor doI mean to cast reflections upon any one of thém—nor  
ought I, it may be said, to do so upon their representations, but as it is a fact too  
notorious that C is rent by party, that much business of a trifling nature and  
personal concernment withdraws their attention from matters of, great national  
moment at this critical period—when it is also known that idleness and dissipation  
takes place of close attention and application, no man who wishes well to the liber-  
ties of his country and desires to see its rights established, can avoid crying out,  
where are our men of abilities? Why do they not come forth to save their coun-  
try? Let this voice, my dear sir, call upon you—Jefferson, and others; do not  
form a mistaken opinion that we are about to set down under our own vine and  
our own fig tree, let our hitherto noble struggle end in ignominy—believe me when  
I tell you there is danger of it. I have pretty good reason for thinking that admin-  
istration a little while ago had resolved to give the matter up, and negotiate peace  
with us upon almost any terms, but I shall be much mistaken if they do not have  
from the present state of our currency, dissentions, and other circumstances, a  
disposition to push matters to the utmost extremity. Nothing I am sure will pre-  
vent it but the interposition of Spain and their disappointed hopes from Russia.  
  
I thank you most cordially for your kind offer of rendering me services. I  
shall without reserve call upon you whenever instances occur that may require it,  
being with the sincerest regard

&quot;I view things very differently, I  
fear,&quot; says Washington, &quot;from what  
people in general do, who seem to  
think the contest is at an end; and to  
make money and to get place, the only  
things now remaining to do. I have  
seen without despondency (even for a  
moment) the hours which America has  
stiled her gloomy ones, but I have be­  
held no day since the commencement  
of hostilities that I have thought her  
liberties in such danger as at present.  
Friends and foes seem now to combine  
to pull down the goodly fabric we have  
hitherto been raising at the expense of  
so much time, blood and treasure--and  
unless the bodies political will exert  
themselves to bring things back to  
first principles, correct abuses, and  
punish internal foes, inevitable ruin  
must follow. Indeed we seem to be  
verging so fast to destruction, that I  
am filled with sensations to which  
have been a stranger till within these  
three months. Nothing in my judg­  
ment can save us but a total reforma­  
tion in our own conduct, or some de  
cisive turn to affairs in Europe. The  
former, alas, to our shame be it spok  
en, is less likely to happen than the  
latter, as it is more consistent with the  
views of the speculators--various tribes  
of money makers--and stock jobbers  
of all denominations, to continue the  
war for their own private emolument,  
without considering that their aver­  
ice and thirst for gain must plunge  
everything (including themselves) in  
one common ruin.&quot; We are sorry t

 I have seen without

cy leven for a moment) the hours which America  
has stiled her gloomy ones, but I have beheld  
no day since the commencement of hostilities  
that I have thought her liberties in such dan

to combine to pull down the goodly fabric we

with sensations to which I have been a  
stranger till within these three months. One  
beholda with exultation and joy how effectually  
we labor for their benefit; and from being in a  
state of absolute despair, and on the noint of  
evacuating America, are now on tiptoe. Noth­  
ing therefore in my judgement can save us from  
a total reformation in our own conduct or  
some decisive turn to affairs in Europe. The  
former, Alas! to our shame be it spoken! is  
less likely to happen than the latter, as it is more  
consistent with the views of the speculators  
various tribes of money makers,and stock­  
jobbers of all denominations, to continue the  
war for their own private emolument, without  
considering that their avarice and thirst for  
gain must plunge everything tincluding them­  
selves! in one common ruin  
Were I to indulge my present feelings and  
give loose to that freedom of expression which  
my unreserved friendship for you would lead  
me to, I should say a great deal on this sub­  
ject; but letters are liable to so many accl  
dents, and the sentiments of men in office  
sought after by the enemy with so much avid­  
ity, and besides conveying useful knowledge  
(if they get into their hands) for the super­  
structure of their plans is often perverted to  
the worst of purposes, that I shall be some­  
what reserved, notwithstanding this letter  
goes by a private hand to Mount Vernon. I  
cannot refrain lamenting, however, in the most  
poignant terms, the fatal policy too prevalent  
in most of the States, of employing their  
ablest men at home in posts of honor or profit  
all the great national interests are fixed upon  
a solid basis. To me it appears no unjust simile  
to compare the affairs of this great continent to  
the mechanism of a clock, each State represent­  
ing some one or other of the smaller parts of it.  
which ther are endeavoring to put in fine order  
without considering how useless and unavail  
ing their labor, unless the great wheel, or  
spring which is to set the whole in motion is
