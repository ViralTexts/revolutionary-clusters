ndollars; and there may be an appeal in all cases of revenue, as well in matter of fact as law, and Congress may give the state Courts jurisdiction of revenue cases, for such sums and in such manner, as they may think proper.  
5. That in all cases of trespasses done within the body of a county, and within the inferior fœderal jurisdiction, the party injur’d shall be entitled to trial by jury in the state where the injury shall be committed; and that it be expressly declared that the state courts, in such cases, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the fœderal courts; and there shall be no appeal from either, except on matter of law; and that no person be exempt from such jurisdiction and trial but ambassadors and ministers privileged by the law of Nations.  
6. That the fœderal courts shall not be entitled to jurisdiction by fictions or collusion.  
7. That the fœderal judges do not hold any other office of profit, or receive the profits of any other office under Congress, during the time they hold their commissions.  
8. That all warrants without oath or affirmation of a person conscienciously scrupulous of taking an oath, to search suspected places or to seize any person or his property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend any person suspected, without naming or describing  the place or person in special, are dangerous and ought not to be granted.  
9. That no soldier be enlisted for a longer time than four years, except in time of war, and then only during the war.  
10. That soldiers be not quartered in time of peace upon private houses without the consent of the owners.  
11. That no mutiny bill continue in force longer than two years.  
12. That the freedom of the press be inviolably preserved.  
13. That the militia shall not be subject to martial law, except in time of war, invasion or rebellion.”  
  
Thus far there was a concurrence in opinion either unanimously or by a considerable majority of the Committee. But when the following amendments were laid before the committee, a majority negatived the same.  
  
1. That the militia unless selected by lot or voluntarily enlisted shall not be marched beyond the limits of an adjoining State, without the consent of their legislature or executive.  
2. That Congress shall have no power to alter or change the time place or manner of holding elections for senators or representatives, unless a state shall neglect to make regulations, or to execute its regulations, or shall be prevented by invasion or rebellion; in which cases only Congress may interfere, until the cause be removed.  
3. That in every law of Congress imposing direct taxes, the collection thereof shall be suspended for a certain reasonable time therein limited, and on payment of the sum by any state, by the time appointed, such taxes shall not be collected.  
4. That no standing army shall be kept up in time of peace unless with the consent of two thirds of the members present of each branch of Congress.  
5. That the president shall not command the army in person, without the consent of Congress.  
6. That no treaty shall be effectual to repeal or abrogate the constitutions or bills of rights of the states or any part of them.  
7. That no regulation of commerce or navigation act, shall be made, unless with the consent of two thirds of the members of each branch of Congress.  
8. That no member of Congress shall be eligible to any office of profit under Congress during the time for which he shall be appointed.  
9. That Congress shall have no power to lay a poll tax.  
  
10. That no person conscienciously scrupulous of bearing arms in any case, shall be compelled personally to serve as a soldier.  
11. That there be a responsible council to the president.  
12. That there be no national religion establish’d by law, but that all persons be equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty.  
13. That all imposts and duties laid by Congress shall be placed to the credit of the state in which the same be collected, and shall be deducted out of such states quota of the common or general expences of government.  
14. That every man hath a right to petition the legislature for redress of grievances in a peaceable and orderly manner.  
15. That it be declared, that all persons entrusted with the legislative or executive powers of government are the trustees and servants of the public; and as such accountable for their conduct. Wherefore whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old, or establish a new government; the doctrine of non resistance to arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.”  
  
The introduction of these articles, especially the 7th and 13th, alarmed and gave offence to many of those among the majority who suspected the motives of Mr. Chase and his particular associates to be sinister and altogether hostile to any effectual plan of national government. And on Monday the 29th while the Committee were sitting the Convention upon motion resolved, “That this Convention will consider of no propositions for the amendment of the fœderal government, except such as shall be submitted to them by the Committee of thirteen.” Upon which the Committee being sent for by the Convention, a majority of them determined, that they wou’d make no report of any amendments whatsoever. The Convention then immediately adjourned sine die.  
Since which William Paca, Messrs. S. and J. T. Chase and John F. Mercer, members of the Committee, and M

same purpose of amusing the manly proceeding of a Virginia Court of appeals. Without knowing the particular merits of the cause, I may venture to applaud the integrity of Judges who thus fulfil their oaths and their duties. I am proud of such characters. They exalt themselves and their country, while they maintain the principles of the constitution of Virginia and manifest the unspotted probity of its judiciary department. I hope you will not think me too local or statically envious when I mention that a similar instance has occur’d in Massachusetts. Where when the legislature unintentionally trespassd upon a barrier of the Constitution the Judges of the supreme Court solemnly determin’d that the particular statute was unconstitutional. In the very next session there was a formal and unanimous repeal of the law which perhaps was unnecessary.  
I have just heard from New York that Mr. Jay who was reported to be mortally hurt in the late anatomical riots there is in tolerable health. Mrs. and Col. Smith arrived at Halifax on the 7th of May. They were in New York on the 20th. Mr. Adams had not arrived in Boston on the 1st o

The same effect was sought by other amendments urged by  
the Virginia and North Carolina conventions. They would  
have prohibited the enlistment of soldiers for any longer term  
than four years, except in time of war, and then for no longer  
term than the continuance of the war.&#x27; Two attempts in the  
First Congress to secure similar amendments were defeated.  
  
164. THE MILITIA  
  
Even the paragraph as to the militia’ did not escape cen  
sure. The Virginia and North Carolina conventions proposed  
still another amendment on the war power, which conferred  
upon each State the power of organizing, arming, and disciplin  
ing its own militia, whenever Congress should omit to provide  
for the same, and in addition that the militia should not be  
subject to martial law except when in actual service.” This  
amendment, also, the Senate in 1789 declined to recommend to  
the States.  
  
The New York ratifying convention proposed an amend  
ment providing that the militia of a State should not be com  
pelled to serve without its limits for a longer term than six  
weeks without the consent of the legislature of its State.’  
  
No further amendments in regard to the militia were pro  
posed until after the war of 1812. In that war the militia,
