But what can be exacted from our Government, after repeated trials, before various jurisdictions, none of which can be charged with any symptom of impropriety, and upon a subject, which to say no more, is at least equipoised? Nothing—And I appeal to the British reasoning on the Silesia loan as supporting this sentiment in the following passages. “The law of nations, founded upon justice, equity, convenience and the reason of the thing, and confirmed by long usage, do not allow of reprisals, except in case of violent injuries, directed and supported by the State and justice absolutely denied, in re minime dubiâ, by all the tribunals and afterwards by the prince.” “Where the Judges are left free, and give sentence according to their conscience, tho’ it should be erroneous, that would be no ground for reprisals. Upon doubtful questions different men think and judge differently; and all a friend can desire is, that justice should be as impartially administered to him, as it is to the subjects of that prince, in whose Courts the matter is tried.” Under such
