After considering all that I have seen and heard on the subject, it is my opinion that the common and popular (not official) Language and conduct of america relative to great Britain, manifested such a Disposition, as to create serious apprehensions in this Country, that we should join with the French in the war—that these apprehensions gave Occasion to secret Designs, calculated on such an Event—that in Proportion as your Views and Counsels became developed, these apprehensions gradually subsided—That my mission was regarded as a strong Proof of  
  
your Desire to preserve peace, and that the perfect and universal Confidence reposed in your personal character, excluded every Doubt of your being sincere—That this Government are not yet entirely convinced, that a pacific and conciliatory System will be supported by the Inclination and correspondent Conduct of the great Body of the People. various circumstances however induce me to believe, that the cabinet ultimately determined to give conciliation a fair Experiment, by doing us substantial Justice, and by consenting to such arrangemts favorable to us, as the national Interests, and habitual Prejudices would admit. To relax the navigation act, was to alarm these Prejudices; and therefore was a measure which required caution and circumspection, especially in the first Instance—To break the Ice was the Difficulty—to enlarge the aperture afterwards would be more easy; and it will probably be done, if we should be reasonably temperate and prudent—to admit us into their East and West India Dominions, and into all their continental american Territories, under any modifications, were decided Deviations from their former Policy, and tended to shock ancient Prejudices—Yet these things have been done—none but a strong administration would have ventured it—These are offerings to conciliation; and include, ’tho’ not confessedly, Satisfaction to our claims of Justice.  
What passed at Paris on Mr Munroe’s arrival, I am persuaded made a strong and disagreable Impression; and had not your private character prevented those Transactions from being imputable in any Degree to your orders I do believe that the system of conciliation would have been instantly abandoned—what would have succeeded it, cannot be easily conjectured—certainly no Treaty so favorable to us as the present, would then have been attainable—whatever the american opinion of it may prove to be; the administration here think it very friendly to us; and that it could not, in the present moment have been made more so, without exciting great Discontents &amp; uneasiness in this country.  
The present situation of Great Britain may to us and others appear to be perillous, but the ministry seem to have no such Fears. They have been uniformly bent on prosecuting the war with Vigour, and since my arrival I have observed no change in that Resolution—Even a destinguished Leader in the opposition lately told me, that the French could not possibly injure the Vitals of this Country—Let it be Infatuation, or what it will, the  
  
Governmt and the great Majority of this nation meant and mean to continue the war. I will mention a striking anecdote.  
You have doubtless heard, that the merchants concerned in the american Trade gave me a Dinner—the principal cabinet ministers were present, and about 200 merchants—many Toa[s]ts were given—when “the President of the united States” was given, it was proposed to be with three cheers, but they were prolonged (as if by Pre-concert, but evidently not so) to six—Several other Toasts passed with great acclamation—particularly “the wooden walls of old England”—almost every Toast referable to america, and manifesting a Desire of Concilition and Cordiality, met with general and strong marks of approbation—Towards the conclusion of the Feast, I was asked for a Toast—I gave a neutral one—vizt “a safe &amp; honorable Peace to all the belligerent powers”—You cannot concieve how coldly it was recieved, and ’tho’ civility induced them to give it three cheers, yet they were so faint and single, as most decidedly to shew that Peace was not the thing they wished—these were merchants—Mr Pinckney was struck as forceably by it as I was; and we both drew the same Conclusions from it.

I have great Reason to believe that the King, the Cabinet and nation, were never more unanimous in any System than in that of Conciliation with us—even Lord Hawksbury does not oppose it—If it should not succeed, they will naturally pass like a Pendulum to the other Extreme. This system rests principally on their Confidence in the uprightness Independence and wisdom of your Conduct—no other man whatever enjoys so completely the Esteem and confidence of this nation as you do; nor except the King, is any one so popular—the Idea which every where prevails is, that the Quarrel between Britain and America, was a family quarrel, and that it is Time it should be made up—for my part, I am for making it up, and for cherishing this Disposition on their part; by Justice Benevolence and good manners on our’s. To cast ourselves into the arms of this, or of any other nation, would be degrading injurious and puerile—nor in my opinion ought we to have any political connection with any foreign power.  
Before I came here, I had no Idea that the King was so popular as he is, his Reign having been marked by national Calamities produced by reprehensible measures. But his Popularity is owing to his private, rather than his official character. as a man, there is much in him to command; and I have not heard any vice imputed to him—as a domestic man, affectionate and  
  
attentive to his Queen and children, and affable to all about him, he is universally esteemed—few men are so punctual in all things—He patronizes the Arts and Sciences—He pays uncommon attention to agriculture and delights in his Farms—He lays out about ten thousand pounds a Year in improving and embellishing the royal Estates—He is industrious, sober and temperate; and has acquired much various Knowlege and Information. He converses with Ease, and often with adroitness; and has an uncommon memory—they who ought to know him, concur in these accounts. That he is a great &amp; a wise King, I have not heard asserted—That he does (to use a vulgar Expression) as well as he knows how, seems not to be doubted; but yet some say, that he occasionally is cunning, instead of being wise—I have heard him described as being a great man in little Things; and as being generally well intentioned, pertinacious &amp; persevering.

The Tranquility of the present Session of Congress is a pleasing circumstance; but I suspect it has proceeded more from their having had nothing to differ about, than from a spirit of Forbearance or a Desire of unanimity—The Result of my negociations will doubtless produce fresh Disputes, and give occasion to much Declamation; for I have no Idea that the Treaty will meet with antifœderal approbation. Besides, men are more apt to think of what they wish to have, than of what is in their power to obtain—How far a Rejection of such a Treaty would put the United States in the wrong! whether it is consistant with our Honor, Engagements and important Interests? whether it is preferable upon the whole to a war? are Questions which require much cool and deliberate consideration; as well as more Information than many who will decide upon them possess—I

tive to Great Britain, manifested such a disposition as to create serious ap-  
prehensions in this country that we should join with the French in the war;  
that these apprehensions gave occasion to secret designs, calculated on such  
an event; that in proportion as your views and counsels developed, these  
apprehensions gradually subsided ; that my mission was regarded as a strong  
proof of your desire to preserve peace, and that the perfect and universal con-  
fidence reposed in your personal character, excluded every doubt of your be-  
ing sincere; and that this government is not yet entirely convinced that a  
pacific and conciliatory system will be supported by the inclination and cor-  
respondent conduct of the great body of the people. Various circumstances,  
however, induce me to believe, that the cabinet ultimately determined to give  
conciliation a fair experiment, by doing us substantial justice, and by con-  
senting to such arrangements favourable to us, as the national interests and  
habitual prejudices would admit. ‘To relax the navigation act was to alarm  
these prejudices, and therefore was a measure which required caution and  
circumspection, especially in the first instance. To break the ice was the  
difficulty. To enlarge the aperture afterward would be more easy; and it  
will probably be done, if we should be reasonably temperate and prudent.  
To amit us into their East and West India dominions, and into all their  
continental American territories, under any modifications, were decided de-  
viations from their former policy, and tended to shock ancient prejudices.  
Yet these things have been done. None but a strong administration would  
have ventured it. These are offerings to conciliation, and include, though  
not confessedly, satisfaction to our claims of justice.  
  
‘‘ What passed at Paris on Mr. Monroe’s arrival, I am persuaded made a  
strong and disagreeable impression; and had not your private character pre-  
vented those transactions from being imputable in any degree to your orders,  
; do believe that the system of conciliation would have been instantly aban-  
  
oned.  
  
‘*‘ What would have succeeded it cannot be easily conjectured; certainly no  
treaty so favourable to us as the present would then have been attainable.  
Whatever the American opinion of it may prove to be, the administration  
here think it very friendly to us; and that it could not in the present moment  
have been made more so, without exciting great discontents and uneasiness  
in this country.  
  
“The present situation of Great Britain may to us and others appear to  
be perilous, but the ministry seem to have no such fears. They have been  
uniformly bent on prosecuting the war with vigour, and since my arrival I  
have observed no change in that resolution. Even a distinguished leader in  
the opposition lately told me, that the French could not possibly injure the  
vitals of this country. Let it be infatuation, or what it will, the government  
and the great majority of this nation meant and mean to continue the war. I  
will mention a striking anecdote.  
  
** You have doubtless heard that the merchants concerned in the American  
trade gave me adinner. The principal cabinet ministers were present, and  
about two hundred merchants. Many toasts were given. When the ‘ Presi-  
dent of the United States’ was given, it was proposed to be with three cheers,  
but they were prolonged (as if by preconcert, but evidently not so) to six.  
Several other toasts passed with great acclamation, particularly, ‘The  
wooden walls of Old England ;’ almost every toast referable to America,  
and manifesting a desire of conciliation and cordiality, met with general and  
strong marks of approbation. ‘Towards the conclusion of the | neg I was  
asked for a toast; I gave a neutral one, viz., ‘A safe and honourable peace  
to all the belligerent powers ;’ you cannot conceive how coldly it was re-  
ceived, and though civilty induced them to give it three cheers, yet they  
were so faint and single, as most decidedly to show that peace was not the  
—e they wished,—these were merchants. Mr. Pinckney was struck as forci-  
bly by it as 1 was; and we both drew the same conclusions frozh it.”’
