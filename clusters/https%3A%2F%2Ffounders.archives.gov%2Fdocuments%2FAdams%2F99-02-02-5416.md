nds. And I confess that I have no such fondness for my bantling, that I am unwilling to have it thrown, naked as it is, into the bullrushes, never to find a Faustulus for a friend, nor an Acca Laurentia to give it suck.  
The motives for your writing, as you unfold them in a couplet, are deserving of all regard—To abash the guilty—to humble the insolence of riches—to expose the nakedness of titled folly, and to strip the mask from the visage of knavery, are subjects rising in importance above every other in a pure Republick. Virture Virtue, Mediocrity of condition, Wisdom, and Honesty, are its adamantine pillars:—  
“Let none presume  
To wear an undeserved dignity  
O that estates, degrees, and offices,  
Were not deriv’d corruptly! and that clear honour  
Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer;  
How many then should cover, that stand bare?  
How many be commanded that command?  
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned  
From the true seed of honour? and how much honour  
Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times,  
To be new varnished?”  
After I had noticed in some of your public Letters, some reflections upon the Senate, I reviewed the reasons for its inst

integrity, virtue and wisdom, are against them a shield impenetrable as the ægis of Jove. “The very stream of your life, and the business you have helmed, must, upon a warranted need, give you a better proclamation.”  
In answering your Letter, I have reserved to the last the concupiscence of Hamilton. “All sects, all ages smack of this vice.” Men speak of it as Lucio spake of Claudio’s embrace of her:—“If myself might be his judge, he should receive his punishment in thanks.” Angelo was resolved on the condemnation of Claudio, when Escalus, the associate of Angelo on the judgment seat, thus addressed him:—  
. . . . Let but your honour know,  
That in the workings of your affections,  
Had time coher’d with place, or place with wishing,  
Or that the resolute acting of your blood  
Could have attain’d the effect of your own purpose,  
Whether you had not some time in your life,  
Err’d in this point which you now censure him.”  
To the same effect, Isabella addresses him:—  
. . . . “Go to your bosom,  
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know  
That’s like my brother’s fault; if it confess  
A natural guiltiness such as his is,  
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue    
Against my brother’s life.”  
These arguments are without the pith to mitigate your judgment of Hamilton, which made them prevail to soften Angelo—you never had a design against

romise to a Mariana. But they are all-powerful to abate the rigour of rebuke in most, and not wholly impotent even on those  
. . . . “Whose blood  
Is very snow-broth; of those who never felt  
The wanton stings and motions of the sense.”  
These are the reasons, and the author from whom I have taken them is good authority that they are natural reasons, why men look leniently on lasciviousness. But because I recapitulate them to you with a view to moderate your public reproaches of Hamilton, I pray the justice of you not to think that I am blindly bent on his vindication—by no means;—most truly can I say with Isabella:—  
There is a vice that most I do abhor,  
And most desire should meet the blow of justice.

uld have been safer to have followed Plato, and to have said, “Speusippus, do you beat that fellow for I am angry.” But, Sir, you set him before me in new and horrid odiousness. Of his “debaucheries in New York and Philadelphia”—of “his audacious and unblushing attempts upon ladies of the highest rank and purest virtue”—of “the indignation with which he has been spurned”—and of “the inquietude he has given to the first families.” I never before heard a word. By this he was as infamous as Caligula, when he told Asiaticus, in public, what kind of a bedfellow was his wife. If he was all this, he was abandoned beyond reclamation. Neither Candour, nor and charity can be must be dumb in his excuse. Avouch, Sir, all this to be true, and I shall consider myself bound by all my duties to my family, to virtue, to my country, and to heaven, to dress him in a suit from the Devil’s wardrobe, and hold him up to the execration of mankind.

“his debaucheries in New York and  
Phi adelphia,” and to “his audacious  
and unblushing attempt upon ladies of  
the highest rank and purest virtue”--to  
“ the indignation with which he has been  
  
spurned,” and to “ the inquietude he has  
given to the first families.”  
  
In reply to these terrible charges in  
President Adams’s letters, Mr. Cun-  
ningham wrote: “ Avouch, sir, all this  
to be true, and I shall consider myself  
bound by all my duties to my family,  
to virtue, to my country, and to hea-  
ven, to dress him in a suit from the  
devil’s own wardrobe, and hold him up  
to the execration of mankind.”  
  
Such a horrible idea had President  
Adams of the character of Hamilton,  
that he wrote a letter to Cunningham:  
“the panegyrical orations of Ames and  
Otis, and the funeral made by the bankers  
in Boston for Hamilton, exceeded in  
atrocity and impiety the king’s brothel
