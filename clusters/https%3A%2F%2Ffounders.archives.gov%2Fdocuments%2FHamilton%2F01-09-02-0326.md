 Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
  
The Secretary of the Treasury respectfully reports to the House of Representatives the Estimates herewith transmitted, No. I, II, III, IV.  
  
  
  
Dollars.   Cents.  
  
  
The first, relating to the Civil List, or the expenditure for the support of Government during the year 1792, (including incidental and contingent expenses of the several departments and offices) amount to  
328.653.56.  
  
  
The second, relating to certain liquidated claims upon the treasury; to certain deficiencies in former estimates for the current service, and to a provision in aid of the fund heretofore appropriated for the payment of certain officers of the Courts, Jurors, witnesses &amp;c  
197.119.49.  
  
  
The third, relating to the department of War, shewing the stated expenditure of that department, for the year 1792  
357.731.61.  
  
  
The amount of a year’s pensions to invalids  
87.463.60⅔  
  
  
Pay and subsistence to sundry officers, for which no appropriation has yet been made,  
10.490.36.  
  
  
Arrearages due upon Indian affairs for the year 1791, and the sum supposed to be necessary for the year 1792  
39.424.71  
  
  
Expenses incurred for the defensive protection of the frontiers for the years 1790 and 1791, and for which no appropriation has yet been made  
37.339.48.  
  
  
     Amounting together to, Dollars,  
1.058.222.81⅔  
  
  
As appears by Number 4, which contains a summary of the three preceding ones, exhibiting in one view the total sum, as above stated, for which an appropriation is requisite.  
The funds, out of which the said appropriation may be made, are, first, the sum of six hundred thousand dollars reserved annually out of the duties on imports and tonnage, by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States, for the support of the government thereof: And secondly, such surplus as shall have accrued to the end of the present year, upon the revenues heretofore established, over and above the sums necessary for the payment of interest on the public debt during the same year, and for the satisfying of other prior appropriations.  
Judging from the returns heretofore received at the Treasury, there is good ground to conclude, that that surplus, together with the above-mentioned sum of six hundred thousand dollars, will be adequate to the object.  
All which is humbly submitted  
Alexr. HamiltonSecretary of the Treasury.

As appears by No. 4, which containsa fumrnaryof

an appropriation is requisite.  
The funds out of which the said appropriation  
may be made, are, firft, the sum of fix hundred  
thousand dollars reserved annually out of the du­  
ties on imports and tonnage, by the ast making  
provision for the debt of the United States, for  
the support of the government thereof: And se­  
condly, such furplusasfhall have accrued to the

Judging from the returns heretofore received
