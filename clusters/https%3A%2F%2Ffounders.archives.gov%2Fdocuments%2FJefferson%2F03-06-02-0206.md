and I too, my dear Sir, like the wood-cutter of Ida, should doubt where to begin, were I to enter the forest of opinions, discussions, &amp; contentions which have occurred in our day. I should exclaim with Theocritus Τί πρᾶτον καταλεξῶ; ἐπεὶ πάρα μυρία ειπῆν. but I shall not do it.  
			 the summum bonum with me is now truly Epicurean, ease of body and tranquility of mind; and to these I wish to consign my remaining days. men have  
			 differed in opinion, and been divided into parties by these  
			 opinions, from the first origin of societies; and in all governments where they have been permitted freely to think and to speak. the same political parties which now agitate the US. have existed thro’ all time. whether the power of the people, or that of the ἄριςτοι should prevail, were questions which kept the states of Greece and Rome in eternal convulsions; as they now schismatize every people whose minds and mouths are not shut up by the gag of a despot. and in fact the terms of whig and tory belong to natural, as well  
			 as to civil history. they denote the temper and constitution of mind of different individuals. to come to our own country, and to the times when you and I became first acquainted. we well  
			 remember  
			 the violent parties which agitated the old Congress, and their bitter contests. there you &amp; I were together, and the  
			 Jays, and the  
			 Dickinsons, and other anti-independants were arrayed against us. they cherished the monarchy of England; and we the rights of our countrymen. when our present government was in the mew, passing from Confederation to Union, how bitter was the schism between the Feds and Antis. here you and I were together again. for altho’ for a moment, separated by the Atlantic from the scene of action, I favored the opinion  
			 that nine states should confirm the constitution, in order to secure it, and the others hold off, until certain amendments, deemed favorable  
			 to freedom, should be made, I rallied in the first instant to the wiser proposition of Massachusets, that all should confirm, and then all instruct their delegates to urge those amendments. the amendments were made, and all were reconciled to the government. but as soon as it was put into  
			 motion, the line of division was again drawn; we broke into two parties, each wishing to give a different direction to the government; the one to strengthen the most popular branch, the other the  
			 more permanent branches, and to extend their permanence. here you &amp; I separated for the first time: and as we had been longer than most others on the public theatre, and our names therefore  
			 were  
			 more familiar to our countrymen, the party which considered you as thinking with them, placed your name at their head; the other, for the same reason, selected mine. but neither decency nor  
			 inclination permitted us to become the advocates of ourselves, or to take part personally in the violent contests which followed. we suffered ourselves, as you so well expressed it, to be the passive subjects of public discussion. and these discussions, whether relating to men, measures, or opinions, were conducted by the parties with an animosity, a bitterness, and an indecency, which had never been exceeded. all the resources of reason, and of wrath, were exhausted by each party in support of it’s own, and to prostrate the adversary opinions. one was upbraided with  
			 recieving the Antifederalists, the other the old tories &amp; refugees into their bosom. of this acrimony the public papers of the day exhibit ample testimony in the debates of Congress, of state legislatures; of stump-orators, in addresses, answers, and newspaper essays. and to these without question may be added, the private correspondences of individuals; and the less guarded in these, because not meant for the public eye, not restrained by the respect due to that; but poured forth from the overflowings of the heart into the bosom of a friend, as a momentary easement to of our feelings. in this way, and in answers to addresses, you &amp; I could indulge ourselves. we have probably done it, sometimes with warmth, often with prejudice, but always, as we believed, adhering to truth. I have not examined my letters of that day. I have no stomach to revive the memory of it’s feelings.

d many of the facts. and shall you &amp; I, my dear Sir, like Priam of old, gird on the ‘arma, diu desueta, trementibus aevo humeris’? shall we, at our age, become the Athletae of party, and exhibit ourselves, as gladiators, in the Arena of the newspapers? nothing in the universe could induce me to it. my mind has been long fixed to bow to the judgment of the world, who will judge me by my acts, and will never take counsel from me as to what  
			 that judgment shall be. if your objects and opinions have been  
			 misunderstood, if the measures and principles of others have been wrongfully imputed to you, as I believe they have been, that you  
			 should leave an explanation of them, would be an act of justice to yourself. I will add that it has been hoped you would leave such explanations as would place every saddle on it’s right horse,  
			 and  
			 replace on the shoulders of others the burthens they shifted on yours.  
But all this, my friend, is offered, merely for your consideration and and judgment; without presuming to anticipate what you alone are qualified to decide for yourself. I mean to express my own purpose only, and the reflections which have led to it.to me then it appears that there have been differences of opinion, and party differences, from the first establishment of governments, to the present day; and on the same question which now divides our own country: that these will continue thro’ all future time: that every one takes his side in favor of the many, or of the few, according to his constitution, and the circumstances in which he is placed: that opinions, which are equally honest on both sides, should not affect personal esteem, or social intercourse: that as we judge between the Claudii and the Gracchi, the Wentworths and the Hampdens of past ages, so, of those among us whose names may happen to be remembered for some time awhile, the next generations will judge, favorably or unfavorably, according to the complexion of individual minds, and the side they shall themselves have taken: that nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others, &amp; will be said in every age, in  
			 support of the conflicting opinions on government: and that wisdom &amp; duty dictate an humble resignation to the verdict of our future peers. in doing this myself, I shall certainly not  
			 suffer moot questions to affect the sentiments of sincere friendship &amp; respect, consecrated to you by so long a course of time, and of which I now repeat sincere assurances.

AND THOMAS JEFFERSON.

scene of action, I favored the opinion that  
nine states should confirm the Constitu-  
tion in order to secure it, and the others  
hold off until certain amendments deemed  
favorable to freedom should be made. I  
rallied in the first instance to the wiser  
proposition of Massachusetts, that all  
should confirm and then all instruct their  
delegates to urge those amendments. The  
amendments were made, and all were rec-  
onciled to the government. But as soon as  
it was put into motion, the line of divi  
sion was again drawn. We broke into  
two parties, each wishing to give the gov-  
ernment a different direction, the one to  
strengthen the most popular branch, the  
other the more permanent branches, and  
to extend their permanence. Here you  
and I separated for the first time; and as  
we had been longer than most others on  
the public theatre, and our names there-  
fore were more familiar to our countrymen,  
the party that considered you as thinking  
with them placed your name at their head;  
the other for the same reason selected  
mine. But neither decency nor inclina-  
tion permitted us to become the advocates  
of ourselves, or to take personally part in  
the violent contests which followed. We  
suffered ourselves, as you so well ex-  
pressed it, to be passive subjects of pub-  
lic discussion. And these discussions,  
whether relating to men, measures or  
opinions, were conducted by the parties  
with an animosity, a bitterness and an in-  
decency which had never been exceeded.  
All the resources of reason and of wrath  
were exhausted by each party in support  
of its own_and to prostrate the adversary  
opinion. One was upbraided with receiv-  
ing the Anti-federalist, the other the old  
Tories and refugees into their bosom. Of  
this acrimony the public papers of the day  
exhibit ample testimony, in the debates of  
Congress, of State legislatures, of stump  
orators, in addresses, answers and news-  
paper essays; and to these without ques-  
  
‘tion may be added the private correspond-  
  
ences of individuals. ... I have no stom-  
ach to revive the memories of those feel-  
ings. Shall you and I, my dear sir, at our  
age, like Priam of old, gird on the arma,  
diu desueta, trementibus aevo humeris?  
Shall we at our age become the atheletz of  
party, and exhibit ourselves as gladiators  
in the arena of the newspapers? Nothing  
in the universe could induce me to do it.  
My mind has been long fixed to bow to  
the judgment of the world, who will judge  
by my acts, and will never take counsel  
from me as to what that judgment shall  
be.”

“If your objects and opinions have been  
misunderstood, if the measures and princi-  
ples of others have been imputed wrong-  
fully to you, as I believe they have been,  
that you should leave an explanation of  
them would be an act of justice to your  
self. I will add that it had been hoped  
that you would leave such explanations as  
  
would leave every saddle on the right  
horse. But all this, my friend, is offered  
merely for your consideration and judg-  
ment, without presuming to anticipate  
  
what you alone are qualified to describe  
for yourself. To me it appears that there  
have been differences of opinion and party  
differences from the first establishment of  
zovernment to the present day, and on the  
same questions which now divide our own  
country; that these will continue through  
all future time; that every one takes his  
side in favor of the one or the other, ac  
cording to his constitution; that opinions  
which are equally honest on both sides  
should not affect personal esteem or social  
intercourse: that as we judge between the  
Claudii and the Grachii, the Wentworths  
and the Hampdens of past ages, so of  
those among us, whose names may hap-  
pen to be remembered for a while, the  
next generations will judge favorably or un-  
favorably according to the complexion of  
individual mind; that nothing new can be  
added by you or me to what has been said  
by others, and will be said in every age, in  
support of the conflicting opinions on gov-  
ernment; and that wisdom and duty “dic-  
tate an humble resignation to the verdict  
of our future peers. In doing this my-  
self, I shall certainly not suffer moot ques-  
tions to affect the sentiments of sincere  
friendship and respect consecrated to you  
by so long a course of time, and of which  
[ now repeat sincere assurances.”
