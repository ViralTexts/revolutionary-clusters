 lives a great divine, and Lock has been President of Harvard Colledge a Station for which no Man was better qualified. With these I ever lived in friendship, without Jealousy or Envy. I soon became intimate with them, and began to feel a desire to equal them in Science and Literature. In the Sciences especially Mathematicks, I soon surpassed them, mainly because, intending to go into the Pulpit, they thought Divinity and the Classicks of more Importance to them. In Litterature I never overtook them.  
  
Here it may be proper to recollect something which makes an Article of great importance in the Life of every Man. I was of an amorous disposition and very early from ten or eleven Years of Age, was very fond of the Society of females. I had my favorites among the young Women and spent many of my Evenings in their Company and this disposition although controlled for seven Years after my Entrance into College returned and engaged me too much till I was married. I shall draw no Characters nor give any enumeration of my youthfull flames. It would be considered as no compliment to the dead or the living: This I will say—they were all modest and virtuous Girls and always maintained this Character through Life. No Virgin or Matron ever had cause to blush at the sight of me, or to regret her Acquaintance with me. No Father, Brother, Son or Friend ever had cause of Grief or Resentment for any Intercourse between me and any Daughter, Sister, Mother, or any other Relation of the female Sex. My Children may be assured that no illegitimate Brother or Sister exists or ever existed. These Reflections, to me consolatory beyond all expression, I am able to make with truth and sincerity and I presume I am indebted for this blessing to my Education. My Parents held every Species of Libertinage in such Contempt and horror, and held up constantly to view such pictures of disgrace, of baseness and of Ruin, that my natural temperament was always overawed by my Principles and Sense of decorum. This Blessing has been rendered the more prescious to me, as I have seen enough of the Effects of a different practice. Corroding Reflections through Life are the never failing consequence of illicit amours, in old as well as in new Countries. The Happiness of Life depends more upon Innocence in this respect, than upon all the Philosophy of Epicurus, or of Zeno without it. I could write Romances, or Histories as won

they to imitate his example. lie admits that  
&#x27; lie was of an amorous disposition from an  
. early age, and of course was fond of the so­  
ciety of females. This is an honorable trait,  
in the character of man, aud if indulged  
with propriety is ever calculated to correct  
the errors and dissipate the vices of man.—  
The society of modest and virtuous women is  
ever beneficial to man. A man who has a.  
disposition to court such society is pretty  
sure to be benefited by it.  
The following is what he says in relation  
to his female associates :  
•• A&#x27;o virgin or matron ever had cause to blush at the  
of me., or to regret her aciptaintance li&#x27;ilh me. No father,  
, brother, son. or friend, ever had cause of grief or resentment  
for an ij intercourse between me. and any daughter, sister,  
mother, or any other relation of the female sea . These re­  
tlectious. to m&lt;? consolatory &#x27;beyond all expression, 1  
am able to make with truth and sincerity ; and 1 pre­  
sume 1 am indebted lor this blessing to my education.  
This has been rendered the more precious to me, as 1  
have seen enough of the effects of a different practice.  
Corroding reflections through life, are the never-failing  
consequence of illicit amours iu old as well as in new  
countries. The happiness of life depends more upon  
innocence in this respect, than upon all the philosophy  
of Epicurus or of Zeno, without it.
