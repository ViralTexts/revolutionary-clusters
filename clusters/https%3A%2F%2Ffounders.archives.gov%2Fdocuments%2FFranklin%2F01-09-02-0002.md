I had daily Expectations of procuring some of them from a Friend to whom I formerly sent them when I was in America, and postpon’d Writing till I should obtain them; but at length he tells me he cannot find them. Very mortifying, this, to an Author, that his Works should so soon be lost!

Mr. Blake, who we hop’d would have handed us along from Friend to Friend, was not at home, and so we knew nobody and convers’d with nobody on all that long Road, till we came thither. The being a Means of contributing in the least Degree to the restoring that good Lady’s Health, would have contributed greatly to our Pleasures, and we could have beguil’d the Way by Discoursing 1000 Things that now we may never have an Opportunity of considering together; for Conversation warms the Mind, enlivens the Imagination, and is continually starting fresh Game that is immediately pursu’d and taken and which would never have occur’d in the duller Intercourse of Epistolary Correspondence.

ature Parting.  
No one can rejoice more sincerely than I do on the Reduction of Canada; and this, not merely as I am a Colonist, but as I am a  Briton. I have long been of Opinion, that the Foundations of the future Grandeur and Stability of the British Empire, lie in America; and tho’, like other Foundations, they are low and little seen, they are nevertheless, broad and Strong enough to support the greatest Political Structure Human Wisdom ever yet erected. I am therefore by no means for restoring Canada. If we keep it, all the Country from St. Laurence to Missisipi, will in another Century be fill’d with British People; Britain itself will become vastly more populous by the immense Increase of its Commerce; the Atlantic Sea will be cover’d with your Trading Ships; and your naval Power thence continually increasing, will extend your Influence round the whole Globe, and awe the World! If the French remain in Canada, they will continually harass our Colonies by the Indians, impede if not prevent their Growth; your Progress to Greatness will at best be slow, and give room for many Accidents that may for ever prevent it. But I refrain, for I see you begin to think my Notions extravagant, and look upon them as the Ravings of a mad Prophet.  
Your Lordship’s kind Offer of Penn’s Picture is extreamly obliging. But were it certainly his Picture, it would be too valuable a Curiosity for me to think of accepting it. I should only desire the Favour of Leave to take a Copy of it. I could wish to know the History of the Picture before it came into your Hands, and the Grounds for supposing it his. I have at present some Doubts about it; first, because the primitive Quakers us’d to declare against Pictures as a vain Expence; a Man’s suffering his Portrait to be taken was condemn’d as Pride; and I think to this day it is very little practis’d among them. Then it is on a Board, and I imagine the Practice of painting Portraits on Boards did not come down so low as Penn’s Time; but of this I am not certain. My other Reason is an Anecdote I have heard, viz. That when old Lord Cobham was adorning his Gardens at Stowe with the Busts of famous Men, he made Enquiry of the Family for a Picture of Wm. Penn, in order to get a Bust form’d from it, but could find none. That Sylvanus Bevan, an old Quaker Apothecary, remarkable for the Notice he takes of Countenances, and a Knack he has of cutting in Ivory strong Likenesses of Persons he has once seen, hearing of Lord Cobham’s Desire, set himself to recollect Penn’s Face, with which he had been well acquainted; and cut a little Bust of him in Ivory which he sent to Lord Cobham, without any Letter of Notice that it was Penn’s. But my Lord who had personally known Penn, on seeing it, immediately cry’d out, Whence came this? It is William Penn himself! And from this little Bust, they say, the large one in the Gardens was formed. I doubt, too, whether the Whisker was not quite out of Use at the time when Penn must have been of the Age appearing in the Face of that Picture. And yet notwithstanding these Reasons, I am not without some Hope that it may be his; because I know some eminent Quakers have had their Pictures privately drawn, and deposited with trusty Friends; and I know also that there is extant at Philadelphia a very good Picture of Mrs. Penn, his last Wife. After all, I own I have a strong Desire to be satisfy’d concerning this Picture; and as Bevan is yet living here, and some other old Quakers that remember William Penn, who died but in 1718, I could wish to have it sent me carefully pack’d in a Box by the Waggon (for I would not trust it by Sea) that I may obtain their Opinion, The Charges I shall very chearfully pay; and if it proves to be Penn’s Picture, I shall be greatly oblig’d to your Lordship for Leave to take a Copy of it, and will carefully return the Original.  
My Son joins with me in the most respectful Compliments to you, to Lady Kaims,

When Lord Cobham was adorning his  
gardens at Stowe with the busts of fa-  
mous men, he made inquiry of the family,  
for a picture of William Penn, in order to  
get a bust formed from it; but could find  
none. Sylvanus Urban, an old Quaker  
apothecary, remarkable for the notice he  
took of countenances, and a talent he  
possessed of cutting in ivory strong like-  
nesses of persons he had once seen,hearing  
of Lord Cobham’s desire, set himself to  
recollect Penn’s face; with which he had  
been well acquainted; and cut a liitle  
bust of him in ivory, which he sent to  
Lord Cobham, without any letter or no-  
tice that it was Penn’s. But Lord Cob-  
ham, who had personally known Penn, on  
seeing it, immediately cried out, “* Whence  
comes this? It is William Penn himself,”  
and from this little bust the large one in  
the gardens was formed.

ever erected.&quot; &quot;All the country from the St. Law-­

“Your Lordship’s kind offer of Penn’s picture is  
exceedingly obliging. But, were it certainly his  
picture, it would be too valuable a curiosity for me  
to think of accepting it; I should only desire the  
favor of leave to take a copy of it. I could wish to  
know the history of the picture before it came into  
yd hands, and the grounds for supposing it his.  
  
have at present some doubt of it: first, because  
the primitive Quakers used to declare against pict-  
ures as a vain expense; a man suffering his por-  
trait to be taken, was condemned as pride; and I  
think to this day it is very little practiced among  
them. Then, it is on a board; and I imagine the  
practice of painting —— on boards did not  
come down so lowas Penn’s time; but of this I am  
not certain.’ His ‘other reason’ is stated in the  
text: ‘I doubt, too,’ Franklin goes on to say,  
‘whether the whisker was not quite out of use, at  
the time when Penn must have been of the age ap-  
pearing in the face of that picture. And yet, not-  
withstanding these reasons, I am not without some  
hope that it may be his, because I know some emi-  
nent Quakers have had their pictures privatel  
drawn, and deposited with trusty friends; and }  
know also that there is extant at Philadelphia, a  
very good picture of Mrs. Penn, his last wife. After  
all, I own T howd a strong desire to be satisfied con-  
cerning this picture, and, as Bevan is yet living here,  
and some other old Quakers that remember William  
Penn, who died but in 1718, I would wish to have it  
sent me, carefully packed in a box, by the wagon

Kames in one of his letters asked Franklin to send him  
all his publications. Franklin tried to get them, but finally  
had to write that he could not find them. “ Very mortifying  
this, to an author, that his works should so soon be lost.

“No one can more sincerely rejoice than I do on the reduction of  
Canada ; and this not merely as I am a Colonist, but as I ama Briton. I  
have long been of opinion that the foundations of the future grandeur and  
stability of the British Empire lie in America; and though, like other  
foundations, they are low and little now, they are nevertheless broad  
and strong enough to support the greatest political structure that human  
wisdom ever yet erected. I am, therefore, by no means for restoring  
Canada to France. If we keep it, all the country from the St. Lawrence  
to the Mississippi will, in another century, be filled with British people.  
Britain itself will become vastly more populous by the immense increase of  
its commerce ; the Atlantic sea will be covered with your trading ships ;  
and your naval power, thence continually increasing, will extend your  
influence round the globe, and awe the world.” *
