Dear Sir  
  
  
  
Montpellier  
  
May 8, 1830  
  
  
  
Your letter of April 29 with the copy of your speech was duly recd.; but not without a little delay  
occasioned by a misdirection of it to Charlottesville instead of Orange Court House.  
You have succeeded better in your interpretation of the Virginia proceedings in 98-99 than those who have  
seen in them, a co-incidence with the Nullifying doctrine so called. This doctrine as new to me as it was to you, derives  
no support from the best co-temporary elucidations of those proceedings.– the debates on the Resolutions, the address of  
the Legislature to its Constituents, and the scope of the objections made by the Legislatures of other States, whose  
concurrence in the Resolutions was invited &amp; refused.  
The error in the late Comments on the Virga. proceedings has arisen from a failure to distinguish between  
what is declaratory of opinion, and what is ipso facto executory; between the right of the parties, and of a single party; and between resorts within the purview of the Constitution, and the ultima ratio  
which appeals from a Constitution cancelled by its abuses, to original rights paramount to all Constitutions.  
I thank you, Sir, for a communication which I owe to your politeness, and your friendly recollections. It  
presents very able views of several very interesting subjects, and merits the atte

&quot;You have succeeded betterin your interpreta­  
tions of the Virginia proceedings in &#x27;93, 99, than  
those who have seen in them a &#x27;coincidence with  
the nullifying doctrine so called. The er­  
ror in the late comments on the Virginia proceed­  
ings, lias arisen from the failure to distinguish be­  
tween what is declaratory of opinion and what is  
i.so facto executory, between the rights of the par­  
ties and of a single party ; and between resorts  
wi hin the purview of the Constitution, and the  
final right which appeals from a Constitution, can­  
celled by its abuses to original rights, paramount  
lo all Constitutions.

partnership or league of States is not claimed as a  
 Constitutional right, or a recognized right within  
the Union, but as a right necessarily resusting from  
the nature of all cop artnerships, and a fortiort as  
essentially belonging to sovereign copartners, so  
that eace partner may have the same optton to withe­  
draw as each had to enter into the alliance, union,  
league or con pact. And the let er of Mr. Madison,  
in 1830, in relation to the celeorated Virginia reso-­  
lutions of 4798, perfectly and entirely coincides  
with these views; for he therein declares (as  
quoted in your article) that &quot;the error in the late  
comments on the Virginia proceedings has arisen  
from a tailure to distinguish bet ween resorts within  
the purview of the constitu lon and the ultims  
o o a i ae tom a onition ca ee  
by its abuses, to original right paramount to all  
constitutions.
