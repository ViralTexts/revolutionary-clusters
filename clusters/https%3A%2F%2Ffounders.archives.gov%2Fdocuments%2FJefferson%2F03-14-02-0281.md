I accordingly committed them to paper, and Virginia being the theatre of his action, was the only subject within my contemplation. while speaking of him, of the resolutions and measures here, in which he had the acknoleged lead I used the expression that ‘mr Henry certainly gave the first impulse to the ball of revolution.’

.  
I will now proceed to your quotation from mr Galloway’s statements of what passed in Congress on their declaration of independance in which statement there is not one word of truth, and where bearing some resemblance to truth, it is an entire perversion of it. I do not charge this on mr Galloway himself; his desertion having taken place long before these measures, he doubtless recieved his information from some of the loyal friends whom he left behind him. but as yourself as well as others appear embarrassed by inconsistent accounts of the proceedings on that memorable occasion, and as those who have endeavored to restore the truth have themselves committed some errors, I will give you some extracts from a written document on  that subject; for the truth of which I pledge myself to heaven and earth; having, while the question of Independance was under consideration before Congress, taken written notes, in my seat, of what was passing, and reduced them to form on the final conclusion. I have now before me that paper, from which the following are extracts. ‘On Friday the 7th of June 1776. the delegates from Virginia moved, in obedience to instructions from their constituents, that the Congress should declare that these United colonies are, and of right ought to be, free &amp; independant states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, &amp; that all political connection between them and the state of Gr. Britain is, &amp; ought to be totally dissolved; that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together. the house being obliged to attend at that time to some other business, the proposition was referred to the next day, when the members were ordered to attend punctually at ten aclock.   Saturday June 8. they proceeded to take it into consideration, and referred it to a committee of the whole, into which they immediately resolved themselves, &amp; passed that day and Monday the 10th in debating on the subject.  
It appearing, in the course of these debates that the colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pensylva, Delaware, Maryland, &amp; South Carolina were not yet matured for falling from the parent stem, but that they were fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prudent to wait awhile for them, and to postpone the final decision to July 1. but, that this might occasion as little delay as possible, a committee was appointed ‘to prepare a Declaration of Independance.’ the committee were J. Adams, Dr Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston and myself. this was reported to the house on Friday the 28th of June when it was read and ordered to lie on the table. on Monday the 1st of July the house resolved itself into a committee of the whole, and resumed the consideration of the original motion made by the delegates of Virginia, which being again debated thro’ the day, was carried in the affirmative by the votes of N. Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusets, Rhode-island, N. Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, N. Carolina and Georgia. South Carolina and Pensylvania voted against it. Delaware having but two members, present, they were divided. the delegates for N. York declared they were for it themselves, and were assured their constituents were for it; but that their instructions having been drawn near a twelvemonth before, when reconciliation was still the general object, they were enjoined by them to do nothing which should impede that object. they therefore thought themselves not justifiable in voting on either side, &amp; asked leave to withdraw from the question, which was given them. the Committee rose, and reported their resolution to the house. mr Rutledge of S. Carolina then requested the determination might be put off to the next day, as he believed his colleagues, tho’ they disapproved of the resolution, would then join in it for the sake of unanimity. the ultimate question whether the House would agree to the resolution of the Committee was accordingly postponed to the next day, when it was again moved &amp; South Carolina concurred in voting for it. in the mean time a 3d member had come post from the Delaware counties, and turned the vote of that colony in favor of the resolution. members of a different sentiment attending that morning from Pensylvania also, their vote was changed; so that the whole 12. colonies, who were authorised to vote at all, gave their votes for it, and within a few days [July 9.] the convention of N. York approved of it, and thus supplied the void occasioned by the withdrawing of their delegates from the vote.’ [be careful that to observe that this vacillation and vote was on the original motion of the 7th of June by the Virginia delegates that Congress should declare the colonies independant.] ‘Congress proceeded the same day to consider the Declaration of Independance which had been reported and laid on the table the Friday  preceding, and on Monday referred to a Committee of the whole. the pusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth keeping terms with, still haunted the minds of many. for this reason those passages which conveyed censures on the people of England were struck out. lest they should give them offence.—the debates having taken up the greater parts of the 2d 3d and 4th days of July, were, in the evening of the last, closed: the Declaration was reported by the Committee, agreed to by the House, and signed by every member present except mr Dickinson.’ so far my notes.  
Governor Mckean, in his letter to McCorkle of July 16. 1817. has thrown some lights on the transactions of that day: but trusting to his memory chiefly at an age when our memories are not to be trusted, he has confounded two questions, and ascribed proceedings to one which belonged to the other. these two questions were 1. the Virginia motion which was voted on that day of June 7. to declare independance, and 2. the  actual Declaration, it’s matter and form. thus he states the question on  the declaration itself as decided on the 1st of July. but it was the Virginia motion which was voted on that day in committee of the whole;  South Carolina, as well as Pensylvania then voting against it. but the ultimate decision in the House on the report of the committee, being by request postponed to the next morning, all the states voted for it, except New-York, whose vote was delayed for the reason before stated.    it was not till the 2d of July that the Declaration itself was taken up; nor till the 4th that it was decided; and it was signed by every member present, except mr Dickinson.  
The subsequent signatures of members who were not then present, and some of them not yet in office, is easily explained, if we observe who they were;: to wit that they were of N. York and Pensylvania. N. York did not sign till the 15th because it was not till the 9th (5. days after the general signature) that their Convention authorised them to do so.    the Convention of Pensylvania, learning that it had been signed by a minority only of their delegates, named a new delegation on the 20th leaving out mr Dickinson who had refused to sign, Willing &amp; Humphreys who had withdrawn, reappointing the 3. members who had signed, Morris who had not been present, &amp; 5 new ones, to wit, Rush, Clymer, Smith, Taylor &amp; Ross: and Morris and the 5 new members were permitted to sign, because it manifested the assent of their full delegation, and the express will of their convention, which might have been doubted on the former signature of a minority only. why the signature of Thornton of New Hampshire was permitted so late as the 4th of November, I cannot now say; but undoubtedly for some particular reason, which we should find to have been good, had it been expressed. these were the only post-signers, and you see, Sir, that there were solid reasons for recieving those of N. York and Pensylvania, and that this circumstance, in no wise affects the faith of this Declaratory charter of our rights, and of the rights of man.

s enable me to give any information. I can say that he was truly a great man, wise in council, fertile in resources; immoveable in his purposes, and had, I think, a greater share than any other member, in advising and directing our measures, in the Northern war especially. as a speaker he could not be compared with his living colleague and namesake, whose deep conceptions, nervous style, and undaunted firmness made him truly our bulwark in debate. but mr Samuel Adams, altho’ not of fluent elocution, was so rigorously logical, so clear in his views, abundant in good sense, and master always of his subject that he commanded the most profound attention whenever he rose in an assembly by which the froth of declamation was heard with the most sovereign contempt. I sincerely rejoice that the record of his worth is to be undertaken by one so much disposed as you will be to hand him down fairly to that posterity for whose liberty and happiness he was so zealous a laborer.  
  
With sentiments of sincere veneration for him his memory, accept yourself this tribute to it with the assurances of my great respect.

P.S. Aug. 7 6. 1822 since the date of this letter, to wit this day Aug. 6. 22 I recieve the new publication of the Secret Journals of Congress, wherein it is stated a Resoln of July 19. 1776 that the Declaration passed on the 4th be fairly engrossed on parchment, and when engrossed, be signed by every member, and another of Aug. 2. that being engrossed and compared at the table was signed by the members. that is to say the copy engrossed on parchment (for durability) was signed by the members after being compared at the table with the original one signed on paper as before stated. I add this P.S. to the copy of my letter to mr Wells to prevent confounding the signature of the original with that of the copy engrossed on parchment

present except Mr. Dickinson; on the 2d of August, another  
copy, engrossed on parchment for durability, was signed by the

a letter to Mr. Wells.

**The subsequent signatures of members who were not then present, and  
some of them not yet in office, is easily explained, if we observe who they were;  
to wit, that they were of New-York and Pennsylvania. New-York did not sign  
till the 15th, because it was not till the 9th, (five days after the general signa-  
ture) that their Convention authorized them to do so. The Convention of Penn-  
sylvania, learning that it had been signed by a minority only of their delegates,  
named a new delegation on the 20th, leaving out Mr. Dickinson, who had refus-  
ed to sign, Willing and Humphreys, who had withdrawn, re-appointing the  
three members who had signed, Morris, who had not been present, and five new  
ones, to wit, Rush, Clymer, Smith, Taylor, and Ross: and Morris, and the five  
new members were permitted to sign, because it manifested the assent of their  
full delegation, and the express will of their Convention, which might have been  
doubted on the former signature of a minority only. Why the signature of  
Thornton, of New-Hampshire, was permitted so late as the 4th of November, I  
cannot now say ; but undoubtedly for some particular reason, which we should  
find to have been good, had it been expressed.”

** Of Samuel Adams, i can say that he was truly a great man, wise in council,  
fertile in resources, immoveable in his purposes, and had, I think, a greater  
share than any other member, in advising and directing our measures in the  
Northern war. Asa speaker, he could not be compared with his living col-  
league and namesake, whose deep conceptions, nervous style, and undaunted  
firmness, made him truly our bulwark in debate. But Mr. Samuel Adams, al-  
though not of fluent elocution, was so rigorously logical, so clear in his views,  
abundant in good sense, and master always of his subject, that he commanded  
the most profound attention whenever he rose in an assembly, by which the  
froth of declamation was heard with the most sovereign contempt.”

question of Independeuce was under consideration before Congress,  
laken written notes, in my seat, of what was passing, and reduced  
them to form onthe final conclusion. Lhave now before me that paper,  
from which the following are extracts :  
  
* Friday, June 7th. 1776. The Delegates from Virginia moved, in obe-  
dience to structions from their constituents, that the Congres: should  
declare that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free  
and independent States; that they are absolved trom ail allegiance to  
the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and  
the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved ; that  
measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of  
fureign Powers, and a Coniederation be formed to bind the Colonies  
more closely together. The House being obliged to attend at that time  
to some other business. the proposition was referrea to the next day,  
wheu the members were ordered to attend punctually at 10 o&#x27;clock.  
Saturday, Junetth. ‘They proceeded to take it into consideration, and  
referred it to a Committee of the W hole, into which they immediately  
resolved themselves, and passed that day and Monday, the 1Uth, in de-  
bating on the salyect.  
  
“Jt appearing. in the course of these debates, that the Colonies of  
New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and  
South Carolina, were not yet matured for falling from the parent stem,  
but that they were fast advancing to that state, it was thought most prn-  
deut to wait awhile for thein, and to postpone the final decision to July  
Ist. But, that this might occasion as little delay as possible, a Com-  
mittee was appointed to prepare a Declaration of Independence. ‘The  
Committee were John Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert  
R. Livingston, and myself. This was reported to the House on Friday,  
the 28th of June, when it was read, and ordered to lie on the table. On  
Monday, the Istof July, the House resolved itself into a Committee of  
the Whole, and resumed the consideration of the original motion made  
by the Delegates of Virginia, which, being again debated through the  
day, was carried in the atlirmative by the votes of New Hampshire,  
  
Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. South Carolina and Penn-  
svivania voted against it. Delaware had but two menibers present,  
and they were divided. ‘The Delegates from New York declared they

votes for it; and, within a few days, [July 9th,] the Convention of  
  
New York approved of it, and thus supplied the void occasioned by  
[ Be careful to  
  
the 7th of June, bytthe Virginia Delegates, that Congress should de  
clare the Colonies independent.] ‘“ Congress proceeded, the sume  
day, to consider the Declaration of Independence, which had been  
reported, and laid ou-the table the Friday preceding, and, on Mon-  
day, referred to a Committee of the Whole. ‘The pusillanimous idea  
that we had friends in England worth keeping terms with, still haunt-  
ed the minds of many. For this reason, those passages which con-  
veyed censures on the people of Lugland, were struck out, lest they  
should give them offence. The debates having taken up the greater  
parts of the second, third, and fourth days of July, were, in the even-  
ing of the last, closed: the Declaration was reported by the Committee,  
agreed to by the Honse, and signed by every member present ex-  
cept Mr. Dickinson.” So far my notes.  
  
Governor M‘Kean, in his Jeuer to MeCorkle, of July 16th, 1817,  
has thrown some lights on the transactions of that day; but, vusting to  
his memory chiefly, at an age when our memories are not to be trusted,  
he bas coufounded two questions, and ascribed proceedings to one  
which belonged to the other. ‘These two questions were, Ist, the Vir-  
ginia motion of June the 7th. to declare Independence ; and, 2d, the  
actual Declaration, its matter and furm. Thus, he states the question  
on the Declaration itself, as decided on the Istof July ; but 1 was the  
Virginia motion which was voted on that day, in Commuttee of the  
Whole, South Carolina, as well as Pennsylvania, then voting against  
it. But the ultimate decision in the House, on the Report of the Com-  
mittee, being, by request, postpuned tu the next morning, all tLe States  
voted for it, except New York, whose vote was delayed for the reason  
before stated. It was not till the 2d of July, that the Declaration itself  
was taken up, nor till the 4th, that it was decided; and it was signed  
by every meinber present, except Mr. Lickineon.  
  
The subsequent signatures of members who were not then present,  
and some of them not yet in office, is easily explained, if we observe  
who they were, to wit: that they were ot New York aud Pennsylvania.  
New York did not sign till the Ldth, beeanse it was not ull the 9th,  
(five days after the general signuature,) U.at their Convention anthonzed  
them to do so. The Convention of Pennsylvania, learning that it had  
been signed by a minority only of their Delegates, named a new delega-  
tion on the 20th, leaving out Mr. Dickmson, who had refused to sign,  
Willing and Humphreys, who had withdrawn, re-appointing the three  
members who had signed, Morris who had not been present, and five  
new ones, to wit: Rush, Clymer, Smith, Tayler, and Ross; and  
Morris, and the five new members were permitted to sign, becanse it  
manifested the assent of their full delegation, and the express will of  
their Convention, which might have been doubted on the bormer signa-  
ture of a minority only. Why the signature of Thornton, of New  
Hampshire, was permitted so late as the 4th of November, I cannot  
now say; but undoubtedly for some particular resson whieh we should  
find to have been good, had it been expressed) These were the only  
post-signers and you see, sir, that there weve solid reasons for receiv-  
ing those of New York and Pennsylvania, and that this circumstance  
in no wise effects the faith of this Declaravry Charter of owr Rights,

ular effect. Accordingly, on Friday, the 7th  
June, 1776, Richard Ilcnry Lec, the oldest of  
the delegation, in accordance with the inatruc­  
tions of the Virginia Convention, moved &quot;that  
the Congress should declare that these United  
Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and  
independent States that they are absolved  
from all allegiance to the British Crown, and  
that all the political connexion between them  
and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to  
be, totally dissolved that measures should be  
immediately taken to procure the assistance of  
foreign Powers, and a confederation be formed  
to bind the colonies more closely together.&quot;  
  
This motion was seconded by John Ad-,  
ams, of Massachusetts, and the next day,  
Saturday, the 8th, at 10 o&#x27;clock, A- M.,  
was appointed for considering it. On that

copies ofthe Declaration, as revised by the  
committee one for Richard Henry Lee, who  
did not return to Congress till August, and  
the other to be presented as the report of  
the committee. This last was presented tQ  
the House on Friday, the 28th June, hy  
Benjamin Harrison, (father of tljelate Pre­  
sident,) and, after being read, was ordered  
to lie on tho table. Fer the subsequent pro-,  
ceedings we again recur to the authentic  
notes of Jefferson:  
&quot;On Monday, the 1st July, tbe House ret  
solved itself into a committee of the whole,  
and resumed the consideration of the origin  
nal motion made by ihe delegates of Virgin­  
ia, which being again debated through the  
day, was carried in the affirmative by the  
votes ofNew Hampshire, Connecticut, Mas­  
sachusetts, Rhode Islund, New Jersey,  
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and  
Georgia. South Carolina, and Pennsylva­  
nia, voted against it. Delaware had but  
two members present, and the^y were divi­  
ded. The delegates from New York de­  
clared they were for it themselves, and  
were absured their constituents were for it  
but that their instructions having been  
drawn near a twelvemonth before, when re­  
conciliation was still the general object,  
they were enjoined by them to do nothing  
which should impede that object. They,  
therefore thought themselves not justifiable  
in voting on either side, and asked leave tQ  
withdraw from the question, which wa9 giv­  
en them. The committee rose, and report­  
ed their resolution to the House Mr. Rut­  
ledge, of South Carolina, then requested the  
determination might be put off to the next  
day, as he believed his colleagues, though,  
they disapproved of the resolution, would  
then join in it for the sake of unanimity.  
The ultimate question, whether the House  
would agree to the resolution of the com­  
mittee, was accordingly postponed to th^  
next day, when it was again moved, and  
South Carolina concurred in voting for it,  
In tho mean time a third member had oome  
post from the Delaware countics, and turn­  
ed the vote of that colony in favor ofthe re­  
solution. Members ofa different sentiment  
attending that morning from Pennsylvania  
also, her vote was changed so that the  
whole twelve colonies, who VVPTO authoriz­  
ed to vote at all, gave their votes for it and  
vyithin a few days (July 9th,) the convene  
tion ofNew York approved of it, and thus  
supplied tho void occasioned by the with­  
drawing of their delegates from the vote.&quot;  
[Be carefnl to observe that this vacillation  
and vote were on *he original motion ofthe  
7th of June, by the Virginia delegates,  
that Congress should declare the coloniea  
independent. &#x27;&#x27;Congress proceeded, the  
6ame day, to consider the Declaration of In­  
dependence, which had been reported and  
laid on the table the Friday preceding, and  
on Monday referred to a committee of the  
whole. The pusillanimous idea that we  
bad friends in England worth keeping terms  
with, still haunted the minds of many. For  
this reason, those passages which conveyed  
censures on the people of England were  
struck out, lest they should givo them of­  
fence, The debates having taken up the  
greater parts of the second, third ond fourth  
days of July, were, in the evening ofthe  
last, closed: tho Declaration was reported  
by the committee, ngreed to by the House,  
and Bignsd by every member present except  
Mr. Dickinson.&quot;

&quot;The subsequent signatures of members  
who were not then present, and some ofthetn  
not yet in office, is easily explained, if w0  
observe who they were to wit, that thejr  
were of New York and Pennsylvania. New  
York did not 6ign until the 15th, because  
it was not until the 0th (five days after the  
general signature) that their convention au­  
thorized them to do so. The convention of  
Pennsylvania, learning that it had beeit  
signed by a majority &quot;only of their delegates*  
named a new delegation on the 20th, leav­  
ing out Mr. Dickinson, who had refused to  
sign, Willing and Humphreys, who had  
withdrawn, re-appointed the three memt  
bers who had signed, Morris, who had oo|  
been present, and five new ones, to witj  
Rysh, Clymer. Smith, Taylor and HOFS and  
Morris, and the five new members were per#  
mitted to sign, because it manifested the  
aesent of their full delegation, and the e^  
press will of their convention, which  
have been doubted on the former signature  
of the majority only. Why the signatur#  
of Thornton, of New Hampshire, was per|.  
mitted so late as the 4th of November,  
cannot now say but undoubtedly for eom»  
particular reason, which we would find ty

After the close of Mr. Jefferson’s letter, I find  
the following :  
  
«“P. S. August 6th, 1822. Since the date of  
this letter, to wit, this day, August 6, ’22, I have  
received the new publication of the Secret Journals  
of Congress, wherein is stated a resolution of July  
1gth, 1776, that the Declaration passed on the  
4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, and when  
engrossed, be signed by every member; and an-  
other of August 2nd, that being engrossed and  
compared at the table, it was signed by the mem-  
bers; that is to say, the copy engrossed on  
parchment (for durability) was signed by the  
members, after being compared at the table, with  
the original one signed on paper as before stated.  
I add this P. S. to the copy of my letter to Mr.  
Wells, to prevent confounding the signature of  
the original with that of the copy engrossed on  
parchment.

‘¢¢ Friday, June 7th, 1776. The delegates from  
Virginia moved, in obedience to instructions from  
their constituents, that the Congress should de-  
clare that these United Colonies age, and of right  
ought to be, free and independent States; that  
they are absolved from all allegiance to the British  
crown, and that all p litical connection between  
them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought  
to be totally dissolved ; that measures should be  
immediately taken for procuring the assistance of  
foreign powers, and a Confederation be formed to  
bind the colonies more closely together. The  
House being obliged to attend at that time to some  
other business, the proposition was referred to the  
next day, when the members were ordered to at-  
tend punctually at ten o’clock. Saturday, June  
8th. They proceeded to take it into considera-  
tion, and referred it to a Committee of the  
Whole, into which they immediately resolved  
themselves, and passed that day and Monday, the  
roth, in debating on the subject.  
  
‘** Tt appearing, in the course of these debates,  
that the colonieso New York, New Jersey, Penn-  
sylvania; Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina,  
were not yet matured for falling from the parent  
  
stem, but that they were fast advancing to that  
state, it was thought most prudent to wait a while  
for them, and to postpone the final decision to  
  
July 1st. But, that this might occasion as little  
delay as possible, a Committee was appointed to  
prepare a Declaration of Independence. The Com-  
mittee were John Adams, Dr. Franklin, Roger  
Sherman, Robert R. Livingston, and myself.  
This was reported to the House on Friday, the  
28th of June, when it was read and ordered to lie  
on the table. On Monday, the 1st of July, the  
House resolved itself into a Committee of the  
Whole, and resumed the consideration of the  
original motion made by the delegates of Virginia,  
which, being again debated through the day, was  
carried in the affirmative by the votes of New  
Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode  
Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North  
Carolina, and Georgia. South Carolina and Penn-  
sylvania voted against it. Delaware had but two  
members present, and they were divided. The  
delegates from New York declared they were for  
it themselves, and were assured their constituents  
were for it; but that their instructions having been  
drawn near a twelvemonth before, when reconcile  
iation was still the general object, they were  
enjoined by them to do nothing which should im-  
pede that object. They, therefore thought them-  
selves not justifiable in voting on either side, and  
asked leave to withdraw from the question, which  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
was giventhem, The Committee rose, and report-  
ted their resolution to the House. Mr. Rutledge of  
South Carolina, then requested the determination  
might be put off to the next day, as he believed  
his colleagues, though they disapproved of the  
resolution, would then join in it for the sake of  
unanimity. ‘The ultimate question, whether the  
House would agree to the resolution of the Com-  
mittee, was accordingly postponed to the next  
day, when it was again moved, and South Caro-  
lina concurred in voting for it. In the meantime,  
a third member had come post from the Delaware  
counties, and turned the vote of that colony in  
favor of the resolution. Members of a different  
sentiment attending that morning from Pennsyl-  
vania also, her vote was changed; so that the  
whole twelve colonies, who were authorized to  
vote at all, gave their votes for it; and within a  
few days [July 9th] the convention of New York  
approved of it, and thus supplied the void occa-  
sioned by the withdrawing of their delegates  
from the vote.’ [Be careful to observe that this  
vacillation and vote were on the original motion  
of the 7th of June, by the Virginia delegates,  
that Congress should declare the colonies inle-  
pendent.] ‘Congress proceeded, the same day,  
to consider the Declaration of Independence,  
which had been reported and laid on the table  
the Friday preceding, and on Monday, referred  
to a Committee o the Whole. The _pusillani-  
mous idea that we had friends in England worth  
keeping terms with, still haunted the minds of  
many. For this reason, those passages which  
conveyed censures on the people of England were  
struck out, lest they should give them offence.  
The debates having taken up the greater parts of  
the second, third, and fourth days of July, were, in  
the evening of the last, closed ; the Declaration  
was reported by the Committee, agreed to by the  
House, and signed by every member present ex-  
cept Mr. Dickinson.’ So far my notes.’’

iton that day. When the Convention of Penn-  
sylvania learned that it had been signed by a  
minority, only, of their delegates, they proceeded,  
on the 20th of July, to appoint a new delegation,  
leaving out Mr. Dickinson, who had refused to  
sign, and Willing and Humphreys, who had with-  
drawn. They reappointed the three members who  
had signed, Morris, who had not been present,  
and five new ones, to wit: Rush, Clymer, Smith,  
Taylor, and Ross, making nine inall. Morris and  
the five new delegates were permitted to sign.

The delegate* from New York

were for it, but by inatructiona giren  
them nearly a jfloar&quot; before, when reconciliation  
was the general,, object,  
they were enjoined to do nothing to

their vote was-changed; so that the whole  
twelve polonies who wero authorized to  
vote at all,gave their voices for it; and  
within a few days (July 9{h) the Convention  
of New York approved It.&quot;  
&quot;On the same day (July 2d) Congress
