equence of Some conversations with Dr Rush in the years 1798–99, I had promised Some day to write him a Letter giving him my View of the Christian System. I have  
			 reflected often on it Since, and even Sketched the outlines in my own mind. I Should first take a general View of the moral doctrines of the most remarkable of the ancient Philosophers, of whose Ethicks We have  
			 Sufficient information to make an estimate; Say of Pythagoras, Epicurus, Epictetus Socrates, Cicero, Seneca, Antoninus. I Should do justice to the branches  of Morality they have treated well, but point out the importance of those in which they are deficient. I Should then take a view of the Deism and Ethicks of the Jews, and Shew in what a degraded  
			 State they were, and the necessity they presented of a reformation. I Should proceed to a view of the Life, Character, and doctrines of Jesus, who, Sensible of the incorrectness of their Ideas of the Deity, and of morality, endeavoured to bring them to the Principles of a pure Deism, and juster Notions of the  
			 Attributes of God; to reform their moral doctrines to the Standard of reason, justice and Philanthropy and to inculcate the belief of a future State. This View would purposely omit the question  
			 of  
			 his Divinity, and even of his Inspiration. To do him Justice, it would be  
			 necessary to remark the disadvantages his doctrines have to encounter, not having been committed to Writing by himself,  
			 but  
			 by the most unlettered of Men, by memory, long after they had heard them from him, when much was forgotten, much misunderstood, and presented in very paradoxical Shapes.  
			 yet Such are the  
			 fragments  
			 remaining, as to Show a master workman, and that his System of Morality was the most benevolent and Sublime, probably that has been ever taught, and more perfect than those of any of the ancient  
			 Philosophers. His Character and Doctrines, have received Still greater  
			 injury from those who pretend to be his Special Disciples, and who have disfigured and Sophisticated his Actions and  
			 precepts  
			 from views of personal interest, So as to induce the unthinking part of Mankind, to throw off the whole System in disgust, and to pass Sentence, as an Impostor, on  
			 the most innocent, the most  
			 benevolent, the most eloquent and Sublime Character, that ever has been exhibited to Man. This is the outline.”!  
“Sancte Socrate! ora pro nobis.”! Erasmus.  
  
Priestley in his Letter to Lindssey inclosing a Copy of your letter to him Says “He is generally considered as an Unbeliever: if So, however, he cannot be far from us, and I hope in the way to be not  only almost, but altogether what We are. He now attends publick worship very regularly, and his moral Conduct was  
			 never impeached.”  
Now, I See not, but you are as good a Christian as Priestley and Lindsey. Piety and Morality were the End and Object of the Christian System

doing that which others are commended for leaving undone.  
  
With respect to Mr. Lindsey himself, we must say, that  
his actions were their own highest eulogy. To panegyrize  
  
  
  
trines of the ancient philosophers ; and shewing the necessity of a reforma-  
tion among the Jews, he says, that he should have proceeded to take ‘a  
view of the life, character, and doctrines of Jesus, who, sensible of the  
incortectness of their ideas of the Deity and of morality, endeavoured to  
bring them to the principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the at-  
tributes of God, to reform their moral doctrines to the standard of reason,  
justice, and philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future state.  
This view would purposely omit the question of his divinity, and even of  
his inspiration. To do him justice, it would be necessary to remark the  
cisadvantages his doctrines have to encounter, not having been committed  
to writing by himself, but by the most unlettered of men, by memory,  
long after they had heard them from him, when much was forgotten,  
much misunderstood, and presented in very paradoxical shapes. Yet such  
are the fragments remaining as to show a master-workman, and that his  
system of morality was the most benevolent and sublime, probably, that  
has been ever taught, and more perfect than that of any of the ancient  
philosophers. His character and doctrines have received still greater  
injury from those who pretend to be his special disciples, and who have  
disfigured and sophisticated his actions and precepts from views of per-  
sonal interest, so as to induce the unthinking part of mankind to throw  
off the whole system in disgust, and to pass sentence as an impostor on  
the most innocent, the most benevolent, the. most cloquent and sublime  
character that has ever been exhibited to man.’—R.

equence of  
some conversations with Dr, Rush, in the years 1798-99, I  
had promised some day to write him a letter, giving him  
my view of the Christian System. I have reflected cften  
on it since, and even sketched the outiines in my own mind.  
|] should first take a general view of the moral doctrines of  
&#x27;the most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose  
ethics we have sufficient information to make an estimate ;  
say, of Pythagoras, Epicurus, Epictetus, Socrates, Cicero,  
Seneca, Antonims. 1 should do justice to the branches of  
morality they have treated well, but to point out the im-  
portance of these in which they are deficient. I should  
| then take a view of the deism and ethies of the Jews, and  
show in what a degraded state they were, and the necessi-  
| ty they presented ofa reformation. I should proceed to #  
view of the life, character and doctrines of Jesus, who,  
sensible of the incorrectness of their ideas of the Deity and  
of morality, endeavored to bring them to the principles of a  
| purer deism and juster notions of the attributes of God ; to  
| reform their moral doctrines to the standard of reason, jus-  
|| tiee and philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future  
state. This view would purposely omit the question of biz  
| divinity and even of his inspiration, ‘To do him justice, it  
_ would be necessary to remark the disadvantages his doc-  
trines have to encounter, not having been committed to  
| writing by himself, but by the most unlettered ef men, by  
memory, long after they had Jearned them from him, when  
much was forgotton, much misunderstood and presented  
in very paradoxical shapes. Yet such are the fragments  
| remaining, as to show a master-workman, and that his sys-  
‘tem of morality was the most benevolent and sublime pro-  
bably that has ever been taught and more perfect than  
His eharacter  
and doctrines have received still greater injury from those  
who pretend to be his special disciples, and who have dis-  
figured and sophisticated his actions and precepts from  
views of personal interest, so as to induce the unthinking
