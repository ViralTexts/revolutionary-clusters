3 January 1788]  
The fourth class comprises the following miscellaneous powers:  
1. A power to “promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for a limited time, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”  
The utility of this power will scarcely be questioned. The copy right of authors has been solemnly adjudged in Great Britain, to be a right at common law. The right to useful inventions, seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases, with the claims of individuals. The states cannot separately make effectual provision for either of the cases, and most of them have anticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the instance of congress.

ict (not exceeding ten miles square) as may by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of the government of the United States; and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the states, in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock yards, and other needful buildings.”  
The indispensable necessity of compleat authority at the seat of government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a power exercised by every legislature of the union, I might say of the world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings be interrupted, with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the state, comprehending the seat of the government for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government, and dissatisfactory to the other members of the confederacy. This consideration has the more weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government, would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single state; and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as still further to abridge its necessary independence. The extent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the state ceding it; as the state will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights, and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the legislature of the state, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people of the state, in their adoption of the constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be obviated.  
The necessity of a like authority over forts, magazines, &amp;c. established by the general government is not less evident. The public money expended on such places, and the public property deposited in them, require that they should be exempt from the authority of the particular state. Nor would it be proper for the places on which the security of the entire union may depend, to be in any degree dependent on a particular member of it. All objections and scruples are here also obviated by requiring the concurrence of the states concerned, in every such establishment.  
3. “To declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.”  
As treason may be committed against the United States, the authority of the United States ought to be enabled to punish it; but as new fangled and artificial treasons, have been the great engines, by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free governments, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have with great judgment opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the congress, even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author.  
4. “To admit new states into the union; but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned, as well as of the congress.”  
In the articles of confederation no provision is found on this important subject. Canada was to be admitted of right on her joining in the measures of the United States; and the other colonies, by which were evidently meant, the other British colonies, at the discretion of nine states. The eventual establishment of new states, seems to have been overlooked by the compilers of that instrument. We have seen the inconvenience of this omission, and the assumption of power into which congress have been led by it. With great propriety therefore has the new system supplied the defect. The general precaution that no new states shall be formed without the concurrence of the federal authority and that of the states concerned, is consonant to the principles which ought to govern such transactions. The particular precaution against the erection of new states, by the partition of a state without its consent, quiets the jealousy of the larger states; as that of the smaller is quieted by a like precaution against a junction of states without their consent.  
5. “To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, with a proviso that nothing in the constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state.”  
This is a power of very great importance, and required by considerations similar to those which shew the propriety of the former. The proviso annexed is proper in itself, and was probably rendered absolutely necessary, by jealousies and questions concerning the western territory, sufficiently known to the public.  
6. “To guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government; to protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.”  
In a confederacy founded on republican principles, and composed of republican members, the superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchical innovations. The more intimate the nature of such a union may be, the greater interest have the members in the political institutions of each other; and the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into, should be substantially maintained. But a right implies a remedy; and where else could the remedy be deposited, than where it is deposited by the constitution? Governments of dissimilar principles and forms, have been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort, than those of a kindred nature. “As the confederate republic of Germany,” says Montesquieu, “consists of free cities and petty states, subject to different princes, experience shews us that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland.” “Greece was undone,” he adds, “as soon as the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the Amphyctions.” In the latter case, no doubt, the disproportionate force, as well as the monarchical form of the new confederate, had its share of influence on the events. It may possibly be asked what need there could be of such a precaution, and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the state governments, without the concurrence of the states themselves. These questions admit of ready answers. If the interposition of the general government should not be needed, the provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in the constitution. But who can say what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular states, by the ambition of enterprizing leaders, or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers? To the second question it may be answered, that if the general government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority, it will be of course bound to pursue the authority. But the authority extends no farther than to a guaranty of a republican form of government, which supposes a pre-existing government of the form which is to be guaranteed. As long therefore as the existing republican forms are continued by the states, they are guaranteed by the federal constitution. Whenever the states may chuse to substitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so, and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only restriction imposed on them is, that they shall not exchange republican for anti-republican constitutions; a restriction which it is presumed will hardly be considered as a grievance.  
A protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts composing it. The latitude of the expression here used, seems to secure each state not only against foreign hostility, but against ambitious or vindictive enterprizes of its more powerful neighbours. The history both of antient and modern confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this article.  
Protection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety. It has been remarked that even among the Swiss cantons, which properly speaking are not under one government, provision is made for this object; and the history of that league informs us, that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and as well by the most democratic, as the other cantons. A recent and well known event among ourselves, has warned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like nature.  
At first view it might seem not to square with the republican theory, to suppose either that a majority have not the right, or that a minority will have the force to subvert a government; and consequently that the federal interposition can never be required but when it would be improper. But theoretic reasoning in this, as in most other cases, must be qualified by the lessons of practice. Why may not illicit combinations for purposes of violence be formed as well by a majority of a state, especially a small state, as by a majority of a county or a district of the same state; and if the authority of the state ought in the latter case to protect the local magistracy, ought not the federal authority in the former to support the state authority? Besides, there are certain parts of the state constitutions which are so interwoven with the federal constitution, that a violent blow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other. Insurrections in a state will rarely induce a federal interposition, unless the number concerned in them, bear some proportion to the friends of government. It will be much better that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the superintending power, than that the majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest. The existence of a right to interpose will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it.  
Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments? May not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of military talents and experience, or of secret succours from foreign powers, as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword? May not a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same side against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength? Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an election! May it not happen in fine that the minority of citizens may become a majority of persons, by the accession of alien residents, of a casual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom the constitution of the state has not admitted to the rights of suffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy species of population abounding in some of the states, who during the calm of regular government are sunk below the level of men; but who in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence may emerge into the human character, and give a superiority of strength to any party with which they may associate themselves.  
  
In cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies, what better umpires could be desired by two violent factions, flying to arms and tearing a state to pieces, than the representatives of confederate states not heated by the local flame? To the impartiality of judges they would unite the affection of friends. Happy would it be if such a remedy for its infirmities, could be enjoyed by all free governments; if a project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of mankind.  
Should it be asked what is to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the states, and comprizing a superiority of the entire force, though not a constitutional right; the answer must be, that such a case, as it would be without the compass of human remedies, so it is fortunately not within the compass of human probability; and that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal constitution, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity, for which no possible constitution can provide a cure.  
Among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by Montesquieu, an important one is, “that should a popular insurrection happen in one of the states, the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that remain sound.”  
7. “To consider all debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this constitution, as being no less valid against the United States under this constitution, than under the confederation.”  
This can only be considered as a declaratory proposition; and may have been inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of the foreign creditors of the United States, who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine that a change in the political form of civil society, has the magical effect of dissolving its moral obligations.  
Among the lesser criticisms which have been exercised on the constitution, it has b

That useful alterations will be suggested by experience, could not but be foreseen. It was requisite therefore that a mode for introducing them should be provided. The mode preferred by the convention seems to be stamped with every mark of propriety. It guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults. It moreover equally enables the general and the state governments to originate the amendment of errors as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side or on the other.

. “The ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states ratifying the same.”  
This article speaks for itself. The express authority of the people alone could give due validity to the constitution. To have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen states, would have subjected the essential interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single member. It would have marked a want of foresight in the convention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcuseable.  
Two questions of a very delicate nature present themselves on this occasion. 1. On what principle the confederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the states, can be superceded without the unanimous consent of the parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist between the nine or more states ratifying the constitution, and the remaining few who do not become parties to it.  
The first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of self preservation; to the transcendent law of nature and of nature’s God, which declares that the safety and happiness of society, are the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed. Perhaps also an answer may be found without searching beyond the principles of the compact itself. It has been heretofore noted among the defects of the confederation, that in many of the states, it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification. The principle of reciprocality seems to require, that its obligation on the other states should be reduced to the same standard. A compact between independent sovereigns, founded on acts of legislative authority, can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach committed by either of the parties absolves the others; and authorises them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular states to a dissolution of the federal pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be confronted? The time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits.

t to provide for itself. In general it may be observed, that although no political relation can subsist between the assenting and dissenting states, yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one side and on the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected; whilst considerations of a common interest, and above all the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are past, and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to re-union, will, it is hoped, not urge in vain moderation on one side, and prudence on the other.

third number of the federalist, attributed to the late president of  
the United States, Mr. Madison, after treating of the cession for  
the seat of government, for forts, &amp;c. shows the propriety of con-  
gress having exclusive jurisdiction: and then proceeds to justify the  
same provision as to forts, &amp;c. as no less evidently necessary. The  
public money expended on such places, and the public property  
deposited in them requires that they should be exempt from the  
authority of the particular states. Nor would it be proper for the  
places on which the entire security of the Union may depend, to be,  
in any degree, dependent on a_particular member of it. All ob-  
jection and scruples are here obviated by requiring the concurrence  
of the states concerned in any such establishment.

.* The indispensable necessity of complete au­  
thority at the seat of government, carries its own  
evidence with it. W ithout it, not only the pub­  
lic authority might be insulted, but a dependence  
of the members of the general government on the  
state comprehending the seat of the government,  
for protection in the exercise of their duty mighl  
bring on the national councils an imputation ol  
awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the go  
vernment and dissatisfactory to the other mem  
bers of the confederacy.  
This consideration has the more weight, as  
ihe gradual accumulation of public improve  
mmts at the stationary residence of the govern  
mini, would be both too great a public pledgi  
to be left in the hands of a single State, am  
would create so many obstacles to a removal o

the inhabitant* will find sufficient inducements o  
interest to become parties to the cession; as thej  
will have had their voice in the election of tin  
government which is to exercise authority ovei  
them: as a municipal legislature for local nurpos  
es derived from their own suffrages, will of coursi  
be allowed them: and as the authority of tin

h exist- i  
ed at the adoption of the constitution. With re- |  
gard to the second branch of the section, relating  
to invasion, we barely observe, that when lhe!  
writer shows that a peaceable attempt to form a  
constitution by sixteen thousand non-freeholMers,  
with an unascertained number of frecholders, who  
in all amount 1o but eight thousand, isan nvasion, |  
or an insurrection, or a combination for pm&#x27;p«mell,  
of violence, it will be time enough to call for s  
suppression. But the Federalist itsell will afford l  
more light on this sulject, than we ean al present |  
by our comments. A FREEHOLDER. |  
6. ““ To guarantee to every state in the union a &#x27;  
republican form of government ; to protect each |  
of themn against invasion; and on application of  
the legislatorve, or of the executive, (when the le- |  
gislature cannot be convened), against domestic vi- |  
olence.”’ &#x27;  
  
In &amp; confederacy founded on republican princi­  
ples, and composed of repubilican members, the  
superintending government ought clearly to possess  
anthority to defend the system against aristocratic  
or monarchical innovations. The more intimate  
the nature of such a union may he, the greater -  
tevest, have the members in the politieal instito­  
tions of each other; and e greater right to insist  
that the forms of government under which the com­  
pact was entered into, should be substantially  
maintained,  
  
But a right implies a remedy; and where else  
conld the remedy be deposited, than where it is de­  
posited by the constitution? Governments of dis­  
similar principles and forms, have been found less  
adapted to a federal coalition of any sert, than  
those of a kindred nature. ** As the confederate  
republic of Germany,”” says [Montesquien, ** eon­  
sists of free cities, and petty states, subject 10 dif­  
ferent princes, experience shows us, that it is more  
imperfect than that of Holland and Switzerland.”’  
** Greece was undone,’” he adds, ** as aoon as the  
king of Macedon obtained &amp; seat among the Am­  
phyetions.”” In the latter case, no doubt, the dis­  
proportionate force, as well as the monarehical  
form of the new confederate, had its share of in­  
fluence an the events.  
  
It may possibly be asked, what need there conld |  
be of such a precaution, and whether it way not.  
become a pretext for alteration in the state govern- ‘  
ments, without the concurrence of the states thein- |  
selves. ‘T&#x27;hese questions admit of ready answers,  
I the interposition of the general government  
should be needed, the provision for such an event  
will be a karmless superfluity only in the constita- |  
tion. Bat who can say what experiments may lve&#x27;  
produced &#x27;?&#x27; the caprice of particular states, by the |  
ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the intrigoe  
and intluence of foreign powers? T&#x27;o the second  
question, it may be answered, that il ihe gmwrall  
government should interpose by virtue of this con­  
stitutional authority, it will be of course bound 1o  
pursue the anthority. Butthe authority extends no  
further than to a guaranty of a republican form ol  
government, which supposes a pre-existing govern­  
ment of the form which is to be goarantced. As  
long therefore as the existing republican forms are  
continued by the states, they are guaranteed by the  
federal comstitution. Whenever the states may  
choose to substitute other republican forms, they  
have a right to do so, and to claim the federal  
guaranty for the latter. The only restriction im­  
posed on them is, that they thall not exchange re­  
publican tor anti-republican consiitutions : a restric­  
tion which, it is presumed, will bardly be consid­  
ered as a grievance.  
A protection against invasion, is due from every  
society, to the parts composing it. The latitude of  
the expression here used, scems to gecure each state  
not only against foreign hostilities, but against am­  
hitious or vindictive enterprises of its more power­  
ful neighbors. The history both of ancient and  
modern confederacies, proves that the weaker mem­  
bers of the union onght not to be insensible to the  
policy of this article.  
Protection against domestic violence, is added  
with equal propriety. It has been remarked, that  
even among the Swiss cantons, which, properly  
speaking, are not under one government, provision  
is made for this object; and the history of that  
league informs us, that mutual aid is l!cquemly  
claimed and afforded ; and as well by the most de­  
mocratic, as the other cantons. A recentand well­  
known event among ourselvea, has warned us to be  
prepared for emergencies of a like nature.  
At first view, it might seem not to square with  
the republican theory, to suppose, either that a  
majority have not the right, or thata minority will  
have the force to subvert the government; and con­  
sequently that the federal interposition ean never  
be required but when it would be improper, But  
theoretic reasoning in this, as in most other cnses,  
must be qualified by the lessons of praetice. Why  
may not illicit combinations for purposes of violence  
be formed ns well by a majority of a state, espe­  
cially a small state, as by a majarity of a country,  
or a distriet of the same state; and if the authority  
of the state ought in the latter case to protect the  
local magistracy, ought not the federal authority in  
the tormer to support the state avthority? Besides,  
there are certain parts of the state constitutions,  
which are so interwoven with the federal constitu­  
‘tion, that a violent blow cannot be given to one  
‘wi hout communicating the wound to the other.—  
Insurrections in a state will rarely produce a fede­  
ral interposition, unlese the number concerned in  
them bear some proportion to the friends of go­  
vernment. It will be much better, that the vio­  
lence in such cases should be repressed by the su­  
perintending power than that the majority should  
be left to maintain their cause, by a bloody and ob­  
stinate contest. The existence of a right to inter­  
pose, will generally prevent the necessity of extrt­  
ing it.  
Is it true, that force and right are necessarily on  
the same side in revublican governments? May  
not the minor party pessess such a superiority of  
pecuniary resources, of wilitary talents and expe­  
rience, or of secret succors from loreign powers, as  
will render it superior also in an appeal 10 the  
sword? May not a more compact and advatageous  
posiiion, torn the scale on the same side, against a  
superior number so situate, as (o be less capahle of  
a prompt and collected exertion of its strength?—  
Nothing ean be more chimerical than to imagine,  
that in a trial of actual foree, victory may be cal­  
culated by the rules which prevail in a census of  
the inhabitants, or which determine the event ofan  
election! May it not happen, in fine, that the mi.  
nority of citizens may become a majority of per­  
sons, by the accession of alien residents, of a cas­  
ual concourse of adventurers, or of those whom the  
constitution of the state has not admitted to lhe{  
rights of seffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy  
species of population abounding in some of the f  
states, who, during the calm of regular goverement,  
are sunk below the level of men; but who, in the  
tempesinous scenes ol civil violence, may emerge  
into the human character, and give a supcriorily of  
strength to any party with which they may associ­  
ate themselves.  
  
In cases where it may be doubtful on which side  
justice lies, what better umpires could be desired by  
twe vielent factions, flying to arms and tearing the  
state to pieces, than the representatives of confed­  
arate states, not heated by the local lame? To the  
impartiality of judges they weuld unite the ufiee­  
tion of friends. Happy would it be, if such a re­  
medy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free  
governments; if a peoject equally effectual conld be  
established for the universal peace of mankind,  
Should it he asked, what is to be the address for  
an insurrection pervading all the states, and com­  
prising a superiority of the entire force, though not  
a constitutional right. The answer must be that  
such a case, as it would be without the compass of  
human remedies, so itis not fortunately within the  
compass of human probability ; and that it s a  
suflicient recommendation of the federnl constitu­  
tion, that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for  
which no possible constitution can provide a cuie.  
‘Among the advantages of a confe&#x27;erate republic,  
ennmerated by Montesquien, an important one is,  
*Cthat should a popular insurrection happen in one  
ol the states, the others are able to quell it. Should  
abuse creep into one part, they are reformed by

sons, by the accession of alien residents, of a casual  
concourse of adventurers, or of those whom the  
constitution of the State has not admitted to the  
rights of suffrage? I take no notice of an unhappy  
species of population abounding in some of the  
States, who, during the calm of regular government,  
are sunk below the level of men; but who, in the  
tempestuous scenes of civil violence, may emerge  
into the human character, and give a superiority of  
strength to any party with which they may associ­  
ate themselves.&quot;

umpires could be desired by two vVio-

the state to pieces, than the represent-

** At first view, it might not seem to square with the republi-  
can theory, to suppose either that a majority have not the right,  
or that a minority will have the force, to subvert a government ;  
and, consequently, that the federal interposition can never be re-  
quired, but when it would be improper. But theoretic reasoning  
in this, as in most cases, must be qualified by the lessons of  
practice. Why may not illicit combinations for purposes of vi-  
olence be formed as well by a majority of a State, especially of  
a small State, as by a majority of a county, or a district of the  
same State ; and if the authority of the State ought, in the latter  
case, to protect the local magistracy, ought not the federal au-  
thority, in the former, to support the State authority ?”’

nay, the constutional possession of which  
 thoya latter davs denied. We leave  
at issue between him and the makers of  
Constitution as well as he can. But, not,  
however, until we have noticed what Mr.  
Madison further said in the 43d number of  
the Federalist, in commenting upon this 3d  
section of the 4th Article more fully.  
Quoting the first part of it, which confers  
power &quot;to admit new States into the Union.&quot;  
ee, he says:  
&quot;In the Article of Confederation no provi  
sion is found on this important subject. The  
eventual establishment of new States seems  
to have been overlooked by the compilers of  
that instrument. We have seen the incon  
venience of this omission, and the assumption  
of power into which Congress has been led  
by it. With great propriety, therefore, has  
the new system supplied the defect.  
He then proceeds to quote the other clause  
&quot;To dispose of and make all needful rules  
and regulations respecting the territory, or  
other property, aee., and then adds:  
&quot;This is a power of very great importance,  
and reguired by consideration similar to  
those which show the propriety of the for  
one?.  
So much for Mr. Madison.

beyond question. Any disposition of them  
whereby one State should obtain an undue

the letter and spirit of their relinquishment

ceded without the unanimous consent of the  
States which are parties to it, upon the tran-  
at law of nature, and of nature&#x27;s god,  
whish declares that the safety and happiness  
of society are the objects to which all politi-  
cal institutions must be sacrificed.  
founded on acts of legislative authority,  
can pretend to no higaer validity than a league  
or treaty between the parties. It is an esth-  
lished doctrine on the subject of treaties, thas  
all the articles are tually conditions of each  
  
other that a breach of any one article is  
  
breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach  
committed by either of the parties absolves  
the others, and authories them, if they please,  
to pronounce the compact violated and void.

treason can be duly administered, so also the same  
may be predicated in regard to the duration of its  
penalties, as &quot;declared by Congress and adminis­  
tered by the courts.  
The Constitution has enjoined that the conse­  
quences of guilt in the case of those actually con­  
victed of treason shall not be visited beyond the  
persons of its authors.  
Mr. Madison, in the 43d number of the Fed­  
eralist, discussing this provisions, says:  
&quot;As treason may be committed against the  
United States, the authority of the United States  
ought to be able to punish it. But as new fangl­  
ed and artificial treasons have been the great  
engines by which violent factions, the natural of­  
fispring of free governments, have usually wreaked  
their alternate malignity on each other, the Con  
vention have, with great judgment, opposed a  
barrier to this pecullar danger, by inserting a cons­  
titutional definition of the crime, fixing the proof  
necessary for the conviction of it, and restraining  
the Congress even in punishing it, from extending  
the consequences of guilt beyond the person of  
its author.  
Judge Story, in commenting upon the severity  
of the punishment of treason by the English Com­  
mon Law, says:  
&quot;The reason commonly assigned for these severe  
punishments, beyond the mere forfeiture of the  
life of the party attainted, are these: By com­  
mitting treason the party has broken his original  
bond of allegiance, and forfeited his social rights.  
Among these social rights, that of transmitting  
property to others is deemed one of the chief an

the question in 1788; on what principle could  
the people of nine States, by ratifying the Con  
stitution, break up the compact under the  
articles of confederation solemnly entered into  
by thirteen States?  
Said Madison:  
&quot;The question is answered at once by re­

to the great principle of self-preservation; to  
the transcendent law of nature and of nature&#x27;s

political institutions alm, and to which all such  
nstitutions must be sacrificed.&quot;

the prescience of the seer, this patriot-statesman  
spoke of the slaves as &quot;an unhappy species of  
population abounding in some of The STateS,

In the same paper also he discusses a question quite akin  
to that of the power of congress to interfere with slavery and  
decree its abolition. In answer to the inquiry, “On what prin-  
ciple the confederation, which stands in the form of a solemn  
compact between the states, can be superseded without the  
unanimous consent of the parties to it?’ he says, “ The ques-

vent a sentence of death for treason under a statute of Congress  
from working, ipso jure, the consequence of an attainder at the  
English law. ‘This theory is ingenious, but it is at variance with  
the contemporancous exposition of the clause, and with the comments  
to more recent writers upon constitutional law. The Federalist, for  
instance, No. 43, discusses it as follows: ‘* As treason may be  
committed against the United States, the authority of the United  
States ought to be enabled to punish it; but as new-fangled and  
artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent  
factions, the natural offspring of free governments, have usually  
wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention  
have with great judgment opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger  
by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime, fixing the  
proof necessary for conviction of it, and restraining the Congress,  
even in punishing it, from extending the consequences of guilt beyond  
the person of its author.” Such seems to have been the construction  
put upon it by Congress in the St. 1790, c. 35, and Rawle,  
Sargent and Story concur in the same opinion.  
  
V. We have hitherto considered the sovereign powers of the gov-

it by the organic law, to deal with the persons and the property of

n anD CONIisCatIOs.  
The Constitution of the United States  
framed and adopted shortly after the close of the  
Revolutionary war. Its framers, most of whom  
had been engaged in that struggle, had witnessed  
the violent passions which had been engendered  
during the contest, and the tendency of men,  
ben excited, to transcend the bounds of justice  
and to act hastily and unadvisedly from the in­  
fluence of prejudice and suspicion. In a very  
brief commentary on that clause of the Consti­  
tution relating to treason, by Mr. Madison, (see  
Federalist papers, xLIII) the reason of the  
provision is explained. &quot;As treason may be com­  
mitted against the United States, the authority  
of the United States ought to be enabled to  
punish it; but as new fangled and artificial  
treasons have been the great engines by which  
violent factions, the natural offspring of free  
gGovernments, have usually wreaked their al  
ternate malignity on each other, the convention  
have with great judgment, opposed a barrier to  
this peculiar danger, oy inserting a constitutional  
definition of the crime, and fixing the proof neces-  
sary for the conviction of it, and restraining  
Congress even in punishing it, from extending the  
consequences of gullt beyond the person of its  
author. Thus it is plain that the Constitution  
meant to limit the punishment of treason to  
the guilty person alone.&quot;  
This provision is also consistent with the  
whole spirit of the Constitution, and consonant  
to the spirit of modern civiliz ttion and the genius  
of christianity.  
The spirit of this provision was announced in  
the laws of Moses, as will be seen from the  
following quotations:  
&quot;Deut, c. 24,y. 16: The father shall not  
be put to death for the children; neither

even more, if necessary, but I say the au­  
thority is not in point for his side of the  
argument, after all. On page 271 of the  
Federalist I read: I viot  
&quot;Congress has power to declare the pun­  
ishment of treason, but no attainder of  
treason shall work corruption of blood or  
forfeiture except during the life of the per­  
son attainted.&quot;

Here let us pause for a moment and in  
quire what is the meaning of this lan­  
guage, &quot;beyond the person of its author.&quot;  
We all know--all who have read the his­

oftimes these attaints were made use of to  
corrupt the blood of a person who had

Gentlemen do not assert, but they do assume,  
and this is the basis of their whole argument,  
that because the Federal Government must guar-  
anty a republican form of government, it may  
therefore prescribe what particular form of repub-  
lican government a State mustadopt. This is ob-  
viously wrong. Mr. Madison in the Federalist  
refutes it:  
  
* As long, therefore, as the existing republican forms are  
continnnd by the States, they are guarantied by the Fede-  
ral Constitution. Whenever the States may choose to sub-  
stitute other republican forms, they have a right to do so,  
and to claim the Federal guarantee for the latter. The only  
restriction im on them is that they shall not exchange

ance.”

the language of James Madison in the Fed­

therefore, that a mode for introducing them  
should be providd. The mode p eferred by the  
Convention seems to be stamped with every mark  
of propriety. It guards equally against that ex­  
treme facility which would render the Constitution  
too mutable, and that extreme difficulty which  
night perpe uate its dis overed farlts. It more­  
over equally enables the General and the State Goy­  
ernments to originate the amendment of errors  
they may b pointed out by the experience on one  
side or on the other.t

If the States are “ not united on the  
principles of unlimited submission,” their  
right under certain circumstances to  
withdraw from the Union, follows as a  
thing of course. On this declaration  
of federative principles, Mr. Jefferson  
was twice elected President. And that  
such were the doctrines of the framers  
of the Constitution, and of the States  
which adopted it, was, we. think, clear-  
ly proved in our leading article of Tus  
Op Guarp for last month.  
  
On this subject the “Father of the  
Constitution” says ;  
  
“*A compact. between independent sove-  
Teigns, founded on acts .of legislative autho-  
rity, can pretend to no higher validity than  
a league or treaty between the parties. It is  
an established doctrine on the subject of  
treaties, that all the articles are mutually con-  
ditions of each other ; that a breach of any  
one article isa breach of the whole treaty ;  
and that a breach committed by either of the  
parties absolves the others, and authorizes  
them, if they please, to pronounce the com-  
pact violated and void.” a

Mr. Madison, in the forty-third number of the  
Federalist, when asking the people of the old  
thirteen States to adopt the Constitution, speak-  
1ng of this power, used these words:  
sock nan posatbly be asked what need there could be of  
  
aution, and whether it may not become a pre-  
  
— for alterations in the State governments, without the  
‘currence of the States themselves.”  
  
Omitting the answer to the first, he says:  
“To the second question it may be answered that if the  
  
| admission into the Union,  
¥ || this subject says further:  
the whole territory, is under the Constitu- ||  
  
  
  
General Government should interfere by virtue of this con-  
stitutional authority, it will be of course bound to pursue  
  
the authority. But the authority extends no farther than  
to a guarantee of a republican form of government, which  
supposes a preéxisting government of the furm which is to  
be guarantied.”’  
  
It is rather late now to present objections to the  
  
mere forms of constitution of the eleven seceding |  
  
States as they stood even before the rebellion.  
Four of the eleven were of the original thirteen.

But our fathers had learned the lesson,  
that, &quot;if the crime of treason be undeter­  
minate, that alone is sufficient to make  
any government degenerate into arbitrary  
power.&quot;  
Madison, the father of our constitution  
in urging its adoption by the people, says,  
&quot;As new fangled and artificial treasons  
have been the great engines by which vio­  
tent factions, the natural offspring of free  
government, have usually wreaked their  
alternate malignity on each other, the con­  
vention have, with great judgment, op­  
posed a barrier to this peculiar danger by  
inserting a constitutional definition of the  
crime, fixing the proof necessary for con­  
viction of it;&quot; which the convention did  
in the following terms:  
&quot;Treason against the United States shall  
consist only in levying war against them or in  
adhering to their enemies, giving them aid  
and comfort. No person shall be convicted  
of treason unless on the testimony of two wit­  
neses to the same overt act.&quot;  
Judge Story, in his commentaries, says,  
that, &quot;by the ancient common law, it was  
left very much to discretion to determine  
what acts were and were not treason, and

tends no farther than to guaranty of a Re

poses a pre-existing Government of the  
form which is to to be guaranteed. As long,  
therefore, as the existing Republican forms  
are continued by the States, they are guar­  
anteed by the Federal Constitution. When  
ever the States may choose to substitute  
other Republican forms, they have a right

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
To guaranty to every State in the  
Union a Republican form of Government,  
to protect each of them against invasion,  
and on application of the Legislature or  
of the Executive (when the Legislature  
cannot be convened) against domestic  
violence.&quot; o  
&quot;In a confederacy founded on repub  
lican principles, and composed of repub  
lican members, the superintending gov­  
ernment ought clearly to possess au­  
thority to defend the system against  
aristocratic or monarchial innovations.  
The more intimate the nature of such  
an union may be, the greater interest  
have the members in the political insti  
tutions of each other, and the greater  
right to insist that the forms of govern­  
ment under which the compact was en  
tered into should be szostantially main  
tained.&quot;  
Again he says, in the Federalist, in  
1788:  
It may possibly be asked, what  
need there could be of such a precau  
tion, and whether it may not become a  
pretext for alterations in the State gov­  
ernments without the concurrence of the  
States themselves. These questions ad  
mit of ready answers. If the interposi  
tion of the General Government should  
not be needed, the provision for such an  
event will be a harmless superfluity only  
in the Constitution. But who can say  
what experiments may be produced by  
the caprice of particular States, by the  
ambition of enterprising leaders, or by  
the intrigues and influence of foreign  
powers.To the second question it  
may be answered that if the General  
Government should interfere by virtue of  
this constitutional authority, it will be, of  
course, bound to pursue the authority,  
But the authority extends no further  
than to a guaranty of a republican form  
of Government, which supposes a pre  
existing Government of the form which  
is to be guaranteed. As long, therefore  
as the existing republican forms are  
continued by the States, they are guar­  
anteed by the Federal Constitution.  
Whenever the States may choose to sub  
stitute other republican forms, they have  
a right to do so, and to claim the Fed  
eral guaranty for the latter. The only  
restriction imposed on them is, that they  
shall not exchange republican for anti  
republican constitutions; a restriction  
which, it is presumed, will hardly be  
considered as a grievance.  
These are two identical questions now  
under discussion by this House. Bu

to exeroise exolusive jurisdiction. It would  
rely on the intrinsio propriety of the autho­  
rity, and treat State remonstrances with oou­  
tempt. The argument of the Federalist for  
the necessity of suoh authority oould easily  
be pressed into the service of the oonsolida­  
tlonists. We insert the oomments of the  
Fedtralist on the passage of the Constitution  
which we have copied:  
&quot;The iiuIlDpensable necessity of complete autho­  
rity at tho seat of government carries Its own evi­  
dence with It. It is a power exercised by every  
legislature in the Union I mlKht say of tho world  
by virtue of Its general Bupremiicy. Without It, not  
only the public authority might bo Insulted and its  
proceeding interrupted with imnunitr: hut a de  
pendence of the members of the General Govern­  
ment on the State comprehending the seat of govern­  
ment for protection in tho exercise of their duty,  
might bring on tho national councils an imputation  
of awe or influence equally dishonorable to the Gov­  
ernment and dlHsatisfuctory to other members  
of the confederacy. This consideration has  
the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of  
public improvements at the stationary residence of  
tho Government would both be too great a pledge to  
be left in the hands of a single State, and would  
create so ninny obstacles to a removal of tie Gov  
ernment,

The necessity of a like authority over

expended ou such places, and the public property

and that, too, under the pretense of guar  
antying a republican foria of government.  
i or a bnei moment, let me invite your  
attention to the opinion of James Madison  
who is justly regarded as the author of the  
Constitution, as to the meaning - of the  
clause referred to. In the forty-third  
number of the Federalist Mr. . .Madison  
says: &#x27;. ; . ... ...&quot; &quot;t &quot; &quot;  
&quot;In a confederacy founded on reouhVican prin  
ciples and composed of republican members the  
scfperiBtending Government ought clearly to pos­  
sess authority to defend the system against aris­  
tocratic or mpnorchical innovations. The more  
intimate the nature of such an ueiou may -be the  
greater interest have tlie members in the political  
institutions of each other, and the greater right  
to insist that the forms &#x27; of government under  
which the compact was entered into, anoula be  
substantially mamtainea.  
-it may possiuty ne aakea wnat  
oi s  
could bee  
need there  
such a precaution, and whether it may  
not become a pretext for alterations ia the btate  
overnments without the concurrence ei the  
tales themselves. These questions admit of  
ready answers. - If the interpoeiUon of the Gener­  
al Government should not beneeded the provi­  
sion for such an event will be a harmless superflu  
ity only in tne uonsutuuon,. Hut wno eea. say  
what experiments may be produced by -the cap  
rice of particular States, by the ambition of enter  
prising leaders, or by the intrigues and influence  
of foreign Powers! To the second queetion it  
may be answered that if the General Government  
should tutcipose-uy vtituer-er-enis constitutional  
authority it will be of course bound tojiursue the  
authority; out tne autnority extenas no lunner  
than to a guaranty of a republican form -of gov­

said in the fortv-third number of the  
Federalist:  
&quot;It mar nossiblv be asked, what need  
there could be of Buch a precaution, and  
whqther it may not become a pretext for  
alterations in the State Rovcrnments, with  
out the concurrence of the States them  
selves. If the interposition of the gen  
eral government should not be needed tne  
provision for sncn an event win oe a nann­  
ies superfluity only in the constitution.  
To the second inquiry, it  
may be answered, that if the general  
government should interpose by virtue of  
the constitutional authority, it win be  
of course bound to pursue the  
authority. But the authority of  
the general government extends no  
further than to&quot;a guarantee of a republi­  
can form of government, which supposes  
rtrc-cxistinc covemment of the form  
which is guaranteed? As long, therefore,  
as the existing republican forms are con­  
tinued by the States, they are guaranteed  
by the Federal Constitution. &quot;Whenever  
the States may choose to substitute other  
republican forms tuey nave a ngnt to ao  
so, and to claim the Federal guarantee for  
the latter. The only restriction imposed  
upon them is. that they shall not exchange  
republican for anti-republican constitu  
tions; a restriction which, it is presumed,  
will hardly be considered as a grievance.&quot;  
How far the Radicals in Congress have

to be seen in the legislation of the las

District: &quot;The indispensable necessity of  
complete authority at the seat of Government  
carries its own evidence with it. It is a  
power exercised by every legislature of the  
Union- I might say of the world--by vir  
tue of its general supremacy. Without it,  
not only the public authority might be  
insulted, and its proceedings be interrupted  
with impunity, but a dependence of the  
members of the general Government  
on the State comprehending the seat of the  
Government, for protection in the exercise  
of their duty, might bring on the national  
councils an imputation of awe or influence  
equally dishonorable to the Government  
and dissatisfactory to the other members of  
the confederacy. This consideration has the  
more weight, as the gradual accumulation  
of public improvements at the stationary  
residence of the Government would be both  
too great a public pledge to be left in the  
hands of a single State, and would create  
so many obstacles to a removal of the Gov­  
ernment as still further to abridge its  
necessary independence. The extent of this  
Federal District is sufficiently circumscribed  
to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite na­  
ture; and as it is to be appropriated to this

ment? May not the minor party possess such a  
superiority of pecuniary resources, of the mill­

Nothing can be more chimerical than to  
imagine that in a trial of actual force victory may  
be calculated by the rules which prevail in a  
census of the inhabitants, or which determine  
the report of an election.7 In cases where  
it may be doubted on which side justice lies, what

factions, flying to arms and tearing a state to  
pieces, than the representatives of confederato  
States not heated by the local flame

may justify the action of the Convention, and may serve to explain  
why it has never been necessary to execute any one in the United  
States for treason, and why Congress, in the very heat of the civil  
war (1862),* voluntarily reduced the punishment of treason from  
death alone to death or fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of  
the court. (3) The “guaranty clause” (Section 4 of Article IV.) is |  
quite new; and yet its interpretation, in the process of reconstruc-  
tion, is quite a contrast to that which the Federalist} puts on it:  
  
“The authority extends no further than to a guaranty of a republican form of  
government, which supposes a preéxisting government of the form which is to be  
guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the existing republican forms are‘continued by  
the States, they are guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. . . . The only  
restriction imposed on them (the States) is that they shall not exchange republican  
for anti-republican constitutions.”

Mr. Madison, in The Federalist, to the question, ‘‘On what  
principle the confederation, which stands in the solemn form of  
a compact among the States, can be superseded without the unan-  
imous consent of the parties to it?” answers: ‘‘ By recurring to the  
absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of self-  
preservation ; to the transcendent law of nature and of nature’s  
God, which declares that the safety and happiness of society are  
the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which  
ali such institutions must be sacrificed.”

“It isan established doctrine on the subject of treaties that all articles are  
mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any one article is a breach of  
the whole treaty; and that a breach committed by either of the parties absolves the  
others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and

justification for dispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of

to this action by the same motives advanced by Mr. Madison in a paper  
in the Federalist in adverting to this power. He wrote as follows: ‘“ The  
utility of this power will scarcely be questioned. The copyright of au-  
thors has been solemnly adjudged in Great Britain to be a right at com-  
mon law. The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to  
belong to the inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases

is remarked that two delicate questions presented them-  
selves on this occasion : chief of them, What is the principle  
whereon the Confederation, which stands in the form of a  
solemn compact among the States, can be superseded with-  
out the unanimous consent of the parties to it? This ‘ is  
answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of  
the case ; to the great principle of self-preservation ; to  
the transcendent law of nature and nature’s God, which  
declares that the safety and happiness of society are the  
objects at which all political institutions aim, and to  
which all such institutions must be sacrificed.’ Thus, to  
examine ‘the anatomy and the functions’ of the Consti-  
tution of the United States is to perceive that, even  
after a solemn and perpetual union had been declared,  
after settled articles long debated had proved unwork-  
able, and after another laborious session on a new Con-  
stitution to supersede these Articles for the common  
good, it was with the utmost difficulty, and only by the  
submission and consideration of amendments (Congress  
immediately granted ten) that the adhesion of seven out  
of the thirteen States was obtained.

&quot; &#x27;The indispensable necessity of complete  
authority at the seat of government car­  
riei its own evidence with it. It is a power  
exercised by every legislature of the Union,  
I might say of the world, by virtue of its  
general supremacy. Without it, not only  
the public authority might be insulted and  
its proceedings interrupted with impunity;  
but a dependence of the members of the  
general government on the state compre­  
hending the seat of government, for pro­  
tection in the exercise of their duty, might  
bring on the national councils an -imputa­  
tion of awe or influence, equally dishonor­  
able to the government and dissatisfactory  
to the other members of the confederacy.  
This consideration has the.more weight, as  
the gradual accumulation of public Im­  
provements at the stationary residence of  
the government would be both too great a  
public pledge to be left in the hands of a  
single state, and would create so many ob­  
stacles to a removal of the government, as  
still further to abridge its necessary inde­  
pendence. The extent of this federal dis­  
trict is sufficiently circumscribed to satis­  
fy every jealousy of an opposite nature.&#x27;  
&quot;&quot;The necessity of a like authority over  
forts, magazines, etc., established by the  
general government, is not less evident.  
The public monej expended on such places,  
and the public property deposited in them,  
require that they should be exempt from  
the authority of the particular state. -Nor  
would It be proper for the places on which  
the security of the entire Union may de­  
pend to be in any degree dependent on a  
particular member of it.

OF GOVERNMENT.  
  
THE Constitution of the United States, Article  
IV., Section 4, provides that ‘‘ the United States  
shall guarantee to every State in this Union a re-  
publican form of government.” On this subject  
the Federalist, No, XLIII., says: ‘‘In a confed-  
eracy founded on republican principles, and. com-  
posed of republican members, the. superintending  
government. ought clearly to possess authority to  
defend the system against aristocratic or monar-.  
chical innovations. The more intimate the nature  
of such an union may be, the greater interest have  
the members in the political institutions of each  
other; and. the greater right. to insist that the  
forms of the government under which the com-  
pact was entered into should. be substantially  
maintained.”. GroRGE TICKNOR .CuRTIS, the his

which may be required there, all demand that they  
should be exempted from State authority. In  
truth, it would be wholly improper that places on  
which the security of the entire Union may de-

member of it. The power, indeed, is wholly un-
