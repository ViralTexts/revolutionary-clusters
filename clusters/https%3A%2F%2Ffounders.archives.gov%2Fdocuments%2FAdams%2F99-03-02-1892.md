r having recited with great Skill the wars between the Borderes and the Southerns, he is asked, “why he, who touched the harp so well  
“Should thus, with ill-rewarded toil,  
wander a poor and thankless Soil?  
when the more generous Southern land  
would well requite his skilful hand.”  
To which with great feeling and warmth he replies,  
“Breathes there the Man with Soul so dead,  
Who never to himself hath Said,  
This is my own, my native land!  
Whose heart hath never within him burned,  
As home his footsteps he hath turned  
From wandering on a foreign Strand!  
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;  
For him no Minstrel raptures swell;  
High though his titles, proud his Name,  
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim  
Despite those titles power and pelf;  
The wretch, concentered all in self,  
Living shall forfeit fair renown,  
And doubly dying, shall go down  
To the vile dust, from whence he sprang,  
Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.”  
The sentiments are so just &amp; so happily exprest, that I could not refrain from transcribing the whole of it.  
The Country and climate where you now reside will still more endear to you, even your adopted Country, and you must reflect with pleasure upon the benifit mr Adams is obtaining for it, in a commercial and I have no doubt, in a political view, als
