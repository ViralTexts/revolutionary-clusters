regulated upon an equal and uniform principle, or the confusions and discontents are endless. Little less than the dissolution of the Army would have been long since the consequence of a different plan, had it not been for a spirit of patriotic virtue both in officers and men of which there are few examples; seconded by the unremitting pains that have been taken to compose and reconcile them to their situation. But these will not be able to hold out much longer against the influence of causes constantly operating and every day with some new aggravation.  
Some States from their internal ability and local advantages furnish  
  
their Troops pretty amply not only with Cloathing; but with many little comforts and conveniences—others supply them with some necessaries, but on a more contracted scale—while others have it in their power to do little or nothing at all. The Officers &amp; Men in the routine of duty mix dayly and compare circumstances—Those who fare worse than others of course are dissatisfied and have their resentment excited, not only against their own States, but against the confederacy. They become disgusted with a service that makes such injurious distinctions. No arguments can persuade an Officer it is justice he should be obliged to pay £[ ] a yard for Cloth and other things in proportion while another is furnished at a [ ] part of the price. The Officers resign, and we have now scarcely a sufficient number left to take care even of the fragments of Corps which remain. The men have not this resource—they murmur—brood over their discontents, and have l

Two years afterwards, on the 3d of April,

never,’ he says, ‘ has been a stage in the  
war in which the dissatisfaction has been
