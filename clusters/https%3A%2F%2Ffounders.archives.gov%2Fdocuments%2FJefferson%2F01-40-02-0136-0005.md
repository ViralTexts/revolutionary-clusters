To Meriwether Lewis esquire, Captain of the 1st Regiment of infantry of the United States of America.  
Your situation as Secretary of the President of the United States has made you acquainted with the objects of my confidential message of Jan. 18. 1803. to the legislature: you have seen the act they passed, which, tho’ expressed in general terms, was meant to sanction those objects, and you are appointed to carry them into execution.  
Instruments for ascertaining by celestial observations the geography of the country thro’ which you will pass, have been already provided. light articles for barter, &amp; presents among the Indians, arms for your attendants, say for from 10. to 12. men, boats, tents, &amp; other travelling apparatus, with ammunition, medecine, surgical instruments &amp; provisions you will have prepared with such aids as the Secretary at War can yield in his department; &amp; from him also you will recieve authority to engage among our troops, by voluntary agreement, the number of attendants abovementioned, over whom you, as their commanding officer, are invested with all the powers the laws give in such a case.  
As your movements while within the limits of the US. will be better directed by occasional communications, adapted to circumstances as they arise, they will not be noticed here. what follows will respect your proceedings after your departure from the US.  
Your mission has been communicated to the Ministers here from France, Spain, &amp; Great Britain, and through them to their governments: and such assurances given them as to it’s objects, as we trust will satisfy them. the country of Louisiana having been ceded by Spain to France, the passport you have from the Minister of France, the representative of the present sovereign of the country, will be a protection with all it’s subjects: and that from the Minister of England will entitle you to the friendly aid of any traders of that allegiance with whom you may happen to meet.  
The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, &amp; such principal stream of it, as, by it’s course &amp; communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean, may offer the most direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce.  
Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take observations of latitude &amp; longitude, at all remarkeable points on the river, &amp; especially at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands &amp; other places &amp; objects distinguished by such natural marks &amp; characters of a durable kind, as that they may with certainty be recognised hereafter. the courses of the river between these points of observation may be supplied by the compass, the log-line &amp; by time, corrected by the observations themselves. the variations of the compass too, in different places, should be noticed.  
The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri &amp; the water offering the best communication with the Pacific ocean, should also be fixed by observation, &amp; the course of that water to the ocean, in the same manner as that of the Missouri.  
Your observations are to be taken with great pains &amp; accuracy, to be entered distinctly, &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself, to comprehend all the elements necessary, with the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude and longitude of the places at which they were taken, &amp; are to be rendered to the war office, for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently by proper persons within the US. several copies of these, as well as of your other notes, should be made at leisure times, &amp; put into the care of the most trustworthy of your attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed. a further guard would be that one of these copies be written on the paper of the birch, as less liable to injury from damp than common paper.  
The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will pursue, renders a knolege of those people important. you will therefore endeavor to make yourself acquainted, as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit,  
with the names of the nations &amp; their numbers;  
the extent &amp; limits of their possessions;  
their relations with other tribes or nations;  
their language, traditions, monuments;  
their ordinary occupations in agriculture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, &amp; the implements for these;  
their food, clothing, &amp; domestic accomodations;  
the diseases prevalent among them, &amp; the remedies they use;  
moral &amp; physical circumstances which distinguish them from the tribes we know;  
peculiarities in their laws, customs &amp; dispositions;  
and articles of commerce they may need, or furnish, &amp; to what extent.  
And, considering the interest which every nation has in extending &amp; strengthening the authority of reason &amp; justice among the people around them, it will be useful to acquire what knolege you can of the state of morality, religion &amp; information among them; as it may better enable those who endeavor to civilize &amp; instruct them, to adapt their measures to the existing notions &amp; practices of those on whom they are to operate.  
Other objects worthy of notice will be  
the soil &amp; face of the country, it’s growth &amp; vegetable productions, especially those not of the US.  
the animals of the country generally, &amp; especially those not known in the US.  
the remains &amp; accounts of any which may be deemed rare or extinct;  
the mineral productions of every kind: but more particularly metals, limestone, pit-coal, &amp; saltpetre; salines &amp; mineral waters, noting the temperature of the last, &amp; such circumstances as may indicate their character.  
Volcanic appearances;  
climate as characterized by the thermometer, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy, &amp; clear days, by lightening, hail, snow, ice, by the access &amp; recess of frost, by the winds prevailing at different seasons, the dates at which particular plants put forth their flower, or leaf, time of appearance of particular birds, reptiles or insects.  
Altho’ your route will be along the channel of the Missouri, yet you will endeavor to inform yourself, by enquiry, of the character &amp; extent of the country watered by it’s branches; &amp; especially on it’s Southern side. the North river or Rio Bravo which runs into the gulph of Mexico, and the North river, or Rio colorado which runs into the gulph of California are understood to be the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of the Missouri, and running Southwardly. whether the dividing grounds between the Missouri &amp; them are mountains or flat lands, what are their distance from the Missouri, the character of the intermediate country, and the people inhabiting it, are worthy of particular enquiry. the Northern waters of the Missouri are less to be enquired after, because they have been ascertained to a considerable degree, and are still in a course of ascertainment by English traders &amp; travellers. but if you can learn any thing certain of the most Northern source of the Missisipi, &amp; of it’s position relative to the lake of the woods, it will be interesting to us. some account too of the path of the Canadian traders, from the Missisipi, at the mouth of the Ouisconsin river, to where it strikes the Missouri, and of the soil &amp; rivers in it’s course, is desireable.  
In all your intercourse with the natives treat them in the most friendly &amp; conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit; allay all jealousies as to the object of your journey, satisfy them of it’s innocence, make them acquainted with the position, extent, character, peaceable &amp; commercial dispositions of the US. of our wish to be neighborly, friendly &amp; useful to them, &amp; of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them; confer with them on the points most convenient as mutual emporiums, &amp; the articles of most desireable interchange for them &amp; us. if a few of their influential chiefs, within practicable distance, wish to visit us, arrange such a visit with them, &amp; furnish them with authority to call on our officers, on their entering the US. to have them conveyed to this place at the public expence. if any of them should wish to have some of their young people brought up with us, &amp; taught such arts as may be useful to them, we will recieve, instruct &amp; take care of them. such a mission, whether of influential chiefs, or of young people, would give some security to your own party. carry with you some matter of the kine-pox; inform those of them with whom you may be, of it’s efficacy as a preservative from the small pox; and instruct &amp; encourage them in the use of it. this may be especially done wherever you winter.  
  
As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will be recieved by those people, whether with hospitality or hostility, so is it impossible to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance with which you are to pursue your journey. we value too much the lives of citizens to offer them to probable destruction. your numbers will be sufficient to secure you against the unauthorised opposition of individuals, or of small parties: but if a superior force, authorised or not authorised, by a nation, should be arrayed against your further passage, &amp; inflexibly determined to arrest it, you must decline it’s further pursuit, and return. in the loss of yourselves, we should lose also the information you will have acquired. by returning safely with that, you may enable us to renew the essay with better calculated means. to your own discretion therefore must be left the degree of danger you may risk, &amp; the point at which you should decline, only saying we wish you to err on the side of your safety, &amp; to bring back your party safe, even if it be with less information.  
As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend, an intercourse will probably be found to exist between them and the Spanish posts at St. Louis, opposite Cahokia, or St. Genevieve opposite Kaskaskia. from still further up the river, the traders may furnish a conveyance for letters. beyond that you may perhaps be able to engage Indians to bring letters for the government to Cahokia or Kaskaskia, on promising that they shall there recieve such special compensation as you shall have stipulated with them. avail yourself of these means to communicate to us, at seasonable intervals, a copy of your journal, notes &amp; observations of every kind, putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed.  
Should you reach the Pacific ocean, inform yourself of the circumstances which may decide whether the furs of those parts may not be collected as advantageously at the head of the Missouri (convenient as is supposed to the waters of the Colorado, &amp; Oregan or Columbia) as at Nootka sound or any other point of that coast; &amp; that trade be consequently conducted through the Missouri &amp; U.S. more beneficially than by the circumnavigation now practised.  
On your arrival on that coast, endeavor to learn if there be any port within your reach frequented by the sea-vessels of any nation, and to send two of your trusty people back by sea, in such way as shall appear practicable, with a copy of your notes. and should you be of opinion that the return of your party by the way they went will be eminently dangerous, then ship the whole, &amp; return by sea, by the way of Cape Horn, or the Cape of good Hope, as you shall be able. as you will be without money, clothes or provisions, you must endeavor to use the credit of the US. to obtain them; for which purpose open letters of credit shall be furnished you, authorising you to draw on the Executive of the US. or any of it’s officers, in any part of the world, on which draughts can be disposed of, and to apply with our recommendations to the Consuls, agents, merchants or citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse, assuring them in our name that any aids they may furnish you, shall be honorably repaid, and on demand. Our consuls Thomas Hewes at Batavia in Java, William Buchanan at the isles of France and Bourbon, &amp; John Elmslie at the Cape of good hope will be able to supply your necessities by draughts on us.  
Should you find it safe to return by the way you go, after sending two of your party round by sea, or with your whole party, if no conveyance by sea can be found, do so; making such observations on your return, as may serve to supply, correct or confirm those made on your outward journey.  
On re-entering the US. and reaching a place of safety, discharge any of your attendants who may desire &amp; deserve it, procuring for them immediate paiment of all arrears of pay &amp; cloathing which may have incurred since their departure; and assure them that they shall be recommended to the liberality of the legislature for the grant of a souldier’s portion of land each, as proposed in my message to Congress: &amp; repair yourself with your papers to the seat of government.  
To provide, on the accident of your death, against anarchy, dispersion &amp; the consequent danger to your party, and total failure of the enterprise, you are hereby authorised, by any instrument signed &amp; written in your own hand, to name the person among them who shall succeed to the command on your decease, &amp; by like instruments to change the nomination from time to time, as further experience of the characters accompanying you shall point out superior fitness: and all the powers &amp; authorities given to yourself are, in the event of your death, transferred to &amp; vested in the successor so named, with further power to him, &amp; his successors in like manner to name each his successor, who, on the death of his predecessor, shall be invested with all the powers &amp; authorities given to yourself.  
Given under my hand at the city of Washington this 20th. day of June 1803

“ To Meriwether Lewis, esquire, captain  
of the first regiment of iufautry of the U. S.  
of America :  
“ Your situation as secretary of the pres­  
ident of the United States, has made you  
acquainted with the objects of my Confiden­  
tial message of January 18, 1803, to the le­  
gislature ; you have seen the act they pas­  
sed, which, though expressed in general  
terms, was meant to sanction those objects,  
and you are appointed to carry them into  
execution.  
  
instruments tor acsertainmg, by celestial  
observations, the geography of the country  
through which you will pass, have been al­  
ready provided. Light articles for barter  
and presents among the Indians, arms for  
your attendants, say for fn.m ten to twelve  
men, boats, tents, and other travelling ap­  
paratus, with ammunition, medicine,surgical  
if struments, and provisions, you will have  
prepared, with such aids as the Becrctarj of  
war can yield in his department ; and from  
him also you will receive antliority toengage  
among our troops, by voluntary agreement,  
t’ number of attendants abovememioned ;  
o&gt; *.■ whom von, as their commanding officer,  
are invested with all the powers the laws  
give in such cate.  
•* As your movement*, while within the li­  
mits of the United States, will he better di­  
rected by occasional communications, adapt  
ed to circumstances as they arise, they will  
not be noticed here What follows will re­  
spect your proceedings after your depart­  
ment Iroin the United States.  
&#x27;• Your mission lias been communicated to  
the ministers here from France, Spain, and  
Great Britain, and through them to their go  
vernments ; and such assut ancen given them  
a* to its objects, as wetrust will satisfy them  
The country of Lnuisana having been ce­  
ded by Spain to France, the pasport you  
have from the minister of France, the repre  
sentativc of the present sovereign of the^  
country, will Ik a protection with all it-• sub&#x27;  
jer.ts ; and that from the minister of Eng­  
land will entitle you to the friendly aid of a­  
ny traders of that allegiance with whom you  
may happen to meet.  
“The object of your mission is to explore  
the Missouri river, and such principal  
  
streams of it, as, by its course and commu­  
nication with the waters of the Pacific o­  
cean, whether the Columbia, Oregan, Colo­  
rado, or any other river, may offer the most  
direct and practicable water-coinmunicatto!!  
across the continent, for the purposes of  
commerce.  
*• Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri,  
you will take observations of latitude and lon­  
gitude, at all remarkable points on the river,  
&amp; especially at the mouths of i ivers, at rapids*  
mt islands, and other places and objects distin­  
guish d by such natural marks and characters*  
of a durable kind, as that they may with cer­  
tainty be recognized hereafter. The courses of  
the river between these points of observation  
may be supplied by the compass, the log-line,  
and by time corrected by the observations  
themselves. The variations of ihe needle, too,  
in different* places, should be noticed.  
I fafcinteresting poir.&#x27;9 of the portage be­  
tween the heads of the Missouri, and of the  
water offering the best communicat on with the  
Pacific ocean, should also be fix**d by observa­  
tion *, and the course of that Water to the ocean  
in die same manner as that of the Missouri.  
\our observations are to be taken with great  
pains and accuracy ; to be entered distinctly  
and intelligibly for others as we.l as yourself;  
to comprehend all the elements necessary, with  
the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude  
and longitude of the places at which they were  
taken ; and are to be rendered to the war of­  
fice, for the purpose of having the calculations  
made concurrently by proper peTsons within*  
the United States. Several copies of these, as  
well as other notes, should be made at leisure  
limes, and put into the care of the most trust  
worthy of our attendants to guard, by multi*  
plying them, against the accidental losses to  
which they will be exposed—A furthtr guard  
would he, that one of these copies be on the  
cuticular membranccs of the paper-birch, as  
le3s liable to injury from damp than common  
paper.  
&#x27;* Hie commerce which may be carried on  
with the peopie inhabiting the line you will  
pursue, renders a knowledge of these people  
important. ¥ou will therefore endeavour to  
make yourself acquainted,

ng notions and practices of  
those on whom they are to operate.  
“ Other objects worthy of notice will be—.  
“ The soil and face of the country, its growth  
and vegetable productions, especially those not  
of the United States ;  
“ I lie remains and accounts of any which  
may be dveuud rare &lt; r extinct t

more particularly metals, time stone, pit coal,  
and saltpetre ; salines ahd miner-u ya,ers, no­

circumstances as may indicate their character ;  
“ Volcanic appearances ;  
“Climate, as characterized by the themoirie­  
ter, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy, {(clear  
days; by lightning, hail, snow, ice ; by tbc ac.  
cess and recess of frost 5 by the winds pr- Vail*  
ing at different seasons ; the dates at which  
particular plants put forth, or lose their flower  
or leaf; times of appearance of particular blrd&amp;,  
reptiles or insects  
  
Aitnougn your route will be along the  
channel of the Missouri, yet you wil endeavor  
to inform yourself, by inquiry, of the character  
and extent of the country watered by its bran­  
ches, and especially on its southern side. The  
North river, or Kin Hravo, which runs into the  
gulph of .Mexico, and the North river, or Ilia  
Colaradn, which runs into the gulph of Cali­  
fornia, are understood to be the principal  
streams heading opposite the waters 01 the Mis­  
souri, and running southwardly. Whether the  
dividing grounds between the Missouri and  
them are mountains or Gut lands, what are their  
distance from the Missouri, the character of  
the intermediate country, and the people inha­  
biting it, ar« worthy of particular inquiry. Thu  
sort hern waters of the Missouri are less to be  
inquired alter, because they have been asevr­  
ta-.ned to a considerable degree, and are still  
in a course of ascertainment by l&#x27;.nglit»h traders  
and travellers ; but if you can learn any thing  
certain of the most northern source ol the ML­  
sis-ippt, and of its position relatively to the  
Lake of the Woods, it will be interesting to us.  
Some account too « the path of the Canadian  
traders from th* Mississippi, at the mouth of  
the Ouisconsing to where it strikes the Mis­  
souri, and of the soil and rivets in its course,  
is desirable.  
j la all your intercourse with the natives, treat  
them in the most friendly and conciliatory nu.na  
ner which their own conduct will admit i allay  
j all jealousies as to the object of jour journey i  
satisfy them of its innocence j make them ac­  
quainted with the position, extent, character,  
peaceable and commercial dispositions of the  
United States i of our wish to be neighborly,  
friendly, and useful to them, and of our disposi­  
tion to a commercial intercourse with them;  
confer w ith litem on the points most conveni­  
ent ns mutual emporiums, and the articles of  
most desirable inti rchauge for them and us If  
a feW of their influential chiefs, within practi­  
cable distance, wish to visit us. arrange such a  
visit with them, and furnish them with authori­  
ty to call on our officers on entering the United  
States, to have them conveyed to this place at  
the public expence. If any of them should wish  
to have soine of their people brougnl up with  
us, and taught such arts as may be useful to  
them, w« will receive, instruct, and take rare  
of them. Such a mission, whether of influen­  
tial chiefs, or of young people, wou!d give some  
security to your own party. Carry with you

manner you will be ret l ived by those people,  
whether with hospitality or hostility, so is it  
impossible to prescribe the exact digrce of  
perseverance will* which you are to pursue  
yi nr journey. We value too much the lives of  
• itizens to offer them to prob ibtc destruction.  
Your^numbcrs will be sufficient to secure you  
against the unauthorized opposition.of u divi­  
duals, or of small parties; but if a superior  
force, authorized or not authorized, by a nation  
should be nnayed against your further passage,

To your own discretion, therefore, must be left

point at which you should decline, only saying,  
wre wish you to err on the side of your safety,  
and to bring back your party safe, even if ii

Spanish posts of St. L,ouis-oppi&gt;ri:e Kashas-,

ders may.famish a conveyance for letters —  
Beyond that you may perhaps be able to  
engage Indian* to bring you letter** for the  
government to Ct&amp;okia, of Kn-kuskia, on  
premising that they shall there receive bucIi  
special compensation ns you shall have stip­  
ulated with their. &#x27; Avail yourself of these  
means to communicate to us, nt seasonable  
intervals, a copy of your journal, notes and  
observations of every kind, putting in cypher  
■whatever might do injury if betrayed.

form yourself&#x27; of the circumstances which  
may decide whether the furs of those parts  
may not be collected as advantageously at  
the head.of the Missouri (convenient as is  
suppostd to the waters ol the Colorado and  
Oregan or Columbia) as at No tka Sound, or  
any o»her point of that coast; and that  
trade be consequently conducted through  
the Missouri and Untied States more bene­  
ficially than by the ciicumnavigation now  
practised. V  
  
“ On your arrival on that coast, endea  
vour to lcurn if tlu re he any point within  
your reach frequented by the sea vessels of  
any nation, ai.d to send two of your trusty  
people back by sea, in such way as shall ap­  
pear practicable, with a copy of your notes ;  
and should you be of o iinion that the return  
of your putty by the way they went will be  
imminently dangerous, then ship the whole,  
and return by sea, by the way either of  
Cape Horn, or the Cape of Good Hope, as  
you shall he able. As you will be without  
money, cloathes, or provisiunk, you must en­  
deavour to use the credit of the United  
Slates to obtain them ; for which purpose  
open letters of credit shall be furnished you,  
authorizing you todraw on the executive of  
the United States, or any of its officers, It.  
any part of the world, on which draughts  
can be disposed of, and to apply with our re­  
commendations to the consuls, agents, mer­  
chants, cr citizens of any nation with which  
we have intercourse, assuring them, in our  
name, that any aids they may furnish you  
shall be honorably repaid, and on demand.  
Our consuls, Thomas Howes, at Batavia, in  
Java, William Huchunan, in the Isles ot  
Trance and Bourbon, and John lalmslie, at  
the Cape of Good Hope, will be able to sup­  
ply your necessities, bv draughts on tis.  
“Should you find it sa-e to return by the  
Way you go, after sending two of your pai ty  
round by sea, or with your whole party, if  
no conveyance by sea can t&gt;e found, do so ;  
making such observath ns, on your return as  
may serve to supply, correct, or confirm  
those made on your outward ji urney.  
“ On re entering the United States and  
reaching a place of safety, discharge any of  
?rour attendants who may dtsiiv and deserve  
t, procuring for them immediate payment  
of all arrears of pay and clothing which  
may have incurred since their departure,  
and assure them that they shall be recom­  
mended to the liberality of the legislature  
for the gr&amp;4t of a soldier’s portion of land  
each, asproposed in my message to congress,  
and repair yourself, with your papers, to  
the seat of government.  
&quot; To provide, on the accident of your  
d&lt; nth against anarchy, dispersion, and the  
consequent dang* r to your party, and total  
failure of the emei prise, yi u are hert«-author­  
ized, by any inatomeat signed and wiitlen  
in your own hand, to name the person a  
niorig them who shall succeed to the com-,

“ To Meriwether Lewis, esquire, cap-  
tain of the first regiment of infantry of  
the United States of America:  
  
“ Your situation as secretary of the  
president of the United States, has made  
you acquainted with the objects of my con-  
fidential message of January 18, 1803, tu  
the legislature; you have seen tne act  
they pussed, which, though expressed in  
general terms, was meant to sanction those  
objects, and you are appointed to carry  
them into execution.  
  
“ Insuruments for ascertaining, by celes-  
‘tial observations, the geography of the  
county through which you will pass, have  
been already provided. Light articles for  
barter and presents among the Indians,  
arms for your attendants, sav for from ten  
to twelve men, boats, tents, and other  
traveling apparatus, without ammunition,  
medicine, surgical instruments, aod pro-  
visions, you will have prepared, with such  
aids as the secretary wt war ean yield jn  
his deparement; and from him also you  
will receive. authority (o engage among  
/our troops, by voluntary agreement, the  
number of attendants above mentioned ;  
over whom you, as their commanding of-  
&#x27; ficer, are invested with all the powers the  
laws give in such a case.  
  
“ As your movements, while within  
the limits of the United States, will be  
better directed by occasional communica-  
tions, adapted to circumstances as they  
arise, they will mot be noticed here.  
What follows will respect your procecd-  
ings after your depariare from the United  
Suates,  
  
“ Your mission has been communicated  
to the ministers bere from France, Spain,  
and Great. Britain, and through them to  
their governments; and sach assurances  
given them as to its objects, as we trnst  
will satisfy them. The country of Louis-  
iana having been ceded by. Spain to  
Fronce, the passport you bave inom the  
minister of France, the representative of  
the present sovereign of the country, will  
be a protection with ail its subjects 5, and  
ihat from the minister of England will en-  
tle you to the friendly aid of any \raders  
of that alegiance with whom you may hap-  
pen to meet. :  
  
“ The object of your mission is to ex-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
‘plore the Missouri river, and such prin-  
  
proved, and, with that view, received a  
  
  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
cipal ‘OF it, as- by its “course and  
communication with the waters of the Pa-  
cific ocean, whether the Columbia, Ove-  
gan, Colorado, or any other river, may of-  
fer the most direct and practicable water-  
communication across the centinent; for  
the purposes of commerce. a  
  
“ Beginning at the mouth of the Mis-  
souri, you will take observations of fati-  
tude 2°41 longitude, at all remarkable  
points on-the river, and especially at the  
mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands,  
and other places and objects distinguished  
by such natural marks and characters, of  
a durable kind, as that they may with cer-  
tainty be recognizedhereafier. The cour-  
ses of the river between these points of  
observation may be supplied by the com-  
pass, the logline, and by time correct«d  
by the observations themselves) The va-  
riations of the needle, too, in different  
places, should be noticed,  
  
“ The interesting points of the portage  
between the heads of the Missouri, and  
of the water offering the best communi-  
cation with the Pacific ocean, s!ould also  
be fixed by observation ; and the course  
of tiiat water to the ocean, in the same  
manner as that of the Missouri.  
  
Your observations are to be taken with  
great pains and accuracy; to be entered  
-distinctly and intelligibly for others as  
well as yourself; to comprehend all the  
elements necessary, with the aid of the  
usual tables, to fix the latitude and jongi-  
tude of the places at which they were-ta-  
ken; and are ‘to be rendered to the war  
office, for the purpose of having (he cal-  
culations made concurrently by proper  
persons within the United States. Seve-  
ral copies of these, as well as other notes,  
should be made at leisure times, and put  
into the care of the most trust-worthy of  
our attendants to guard, by multiplying  
them, against the accidental losses to  
which they will be exposed—A further  
guard would be, that one of these copies  
be on the cuticular membranes of the pa-  
per-birch, as less liableto injury fromdamp  
than common paper.  
  
“ The commerce which may be carried  
on with the people inhabiting the live you  
will pursue, renders a knowledge of those  
people important. You will therefore en-  
deavor to make yourself acquainted, as  
fur as a diligent pursuit of your journey  
shali admit, with the names of the nations  
and their numbers ;  
  
“ The extent and limits of their posses-  
sions ;  
  
“ Their relations with other tribes or  
nations ;  
  
“ Their language, traditions, monu-  
ments ;  
  
“-Their ordinary occupations in agri-  
culture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, and  
impiemeuts for these ;  
  
“ Their food, clothing, and domestic

&lt;  
  
  
  
  
» ©The diseases prevatent among them,  
and the remedies they use ;  
  
* Moral and physical circumstances  
which distinguish them from the tribes  
payne  
  
and dispositions ;  
  
“And articles of commerce they may  
need or furnish, and to what extent.  
  
« And, considering the interest which  
every nation has in extendingand strength-  
ening the authority of reason and justice  
among the people around them, it will be  
useful to acquire what knowledge you can  
of the state of morality, religion, and in-  
formation among them ; as it may better  
enable those who may endeavor to civilize  
and instruet them, to adapt nieasures. to  
the existing notions and practices of those  
on whom they are to operate.  
  
“ Other objects worthy of notice will  
be—  
  
“ The soil and face of the cvuntry, its  
growth and vegetable productions, espe-  
cially those not of the United States ;  
  
“ The animals of the country general-  
iy, and especially those not known in the  
United States ;  
  
“ The remains and accounts of any  
which may be deemed rare or extinct ;  
  
“ The mineral productions of every  
kind, but more particularly metals, lime-  
stone, pit-coal, and saitpetre ; salines and  
mineral waters, noting the temperature  
of the last, and such circumstances as  
may indicate their character ;  
  
“ Volcanic appearances;  
  
* Climate. as ‘characterized by the ther-  
mometer, by the proportion of rainy, clou-  
  
  
  
‘in their laws, customs  
  
dy, and clear days; by lightning, hail,  
  
snow, ice; by the access and recess of  
frost; by the winds prevailing at different  
seasons; the dates at which particular  
plants put forth, or lose their flower or  
leaf; times of appearance of particular  
birds, reptiles or insects.  
  
“ Ahhowgh your route will be along the  
channel of the Missouri, yet you will en-  
deavor to inform yourseif, by inquiry, of  
the character and extent of the country  
watered by its branches, and especially on  
its southern side. The North river, or  
Rio Brayo, which runs into the guiph of  
Mexico, and the North river, or Rio Co-  
iorado, which runs into the gulph of Cali-  
fornia, are understood to be the principal  
streams heading opposite the waters of  
the Missouri, and running southwardly.  
Whether the dividing grounds between  
the Missouri and them are mountains or  
flot lands, what are their distance from  
the Missouri, the character of the inter-  
mediate country, snd the people inhabit-  
ing it, are worthy of particular inquiry.  
The northern waters of the Missourn are  
less to be inquired after, because they  
have been ascertained to a considerabic  
degeec, and are still in acourse of wscer-  
‘unment by English traders and travel-  
iers ; but if you can learn any thing certain  
  
  
  
bY  
  
of the most northern source of the Mis-  
sissippi, and of its position relatively to  
the Lake of the Woods, it will be inter-  
esting to us. Some account too of the  
path of the Canadian traders from the  
Mississippi, at the mouth of the Ouiscon-  
sing to where it strikes the Missouri, and  
of the soil and rivers in its course, is de-  
sirable.  
  
In-all your intercourse with the natives,  
treat them in the most fricndly and con-  
ciliatory manner which their own conduct  
will admit; allay ali jealotisies as to the  
object of your journey ; satisfy them of  
itsinnocence ; make them acquainted with  
the position, extent, character, peaceable  
and commercial dispositions ofihe United  
States; of our wish be neighborly,  
friendly, and useful to them, and of aw  
disposition to a commercial intercourse  
with them ; confer with them on the points  
most convenient as mutual emporiums,  
and the articles of most desirable inter-  
change for them and us. If a few of their  
influential chiefs, within practicable dis-  
tanee, wishto visit us, arrange such a vi-  
sit with theme and furnish them with au-  
thority to callOn our officers on entering  
the United States, to have them conveyed  
to this place at the public expense. If  
any of them should wish to have some of  
their people brought up with us, and  
taught such arts as may be useful to them,  
we will receive, instruct, and take care  
of them. Such a mission, whether of in-  
fiuential chiefs, or of young people, would  
give some security to. your own party.  
Carry with you some matter of the kine-  
pox ; inform those of them with whom you  
may be of iis efficacy as a preservative  
from: the small-pox, and instruct and en-  
courage them in the use of it. This may  
be especially done wherever you winter.

* Aithough your route will be along the channel of the Mis-  
souri, yet you will endeavour to inform yourself, by inquiry, of the  
character and extent of the country watered by its branches, and  
especially on its southern side. The North river, or Rio Bravo,  
which runs into the gulf of Mexico, and the North river, or Rio  
Colorado, which runs into the gulf of California, are understood  
to be the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of the  
Missouri, and running southwardly. Whether the dividing grounds  
between the Missouri and them are mountains or flat lands, what  
are their distance from the Missouri, the character of the inter-  
mediate country, and the people inhabiting it, are worthy of parti-  
cular inquiry. The northern waters of the Missouri are less te  
be inquired after, because they have been ascertained to a con-  
siderable degree, and are still ina course of ascertainment by En-  
glish traders and travellers; but if you can learn any thing cer-  
  
tain of the most northern source of the Missisippi, and of its po-  
sition relatively to the Lake of the Woods, it will be interest-  
ing to us. Some account too of the path of the Canadian traders  
from the Missisippi, at the mouth of the Ouisconsing to where it  
strikes the Missouri, and of the soil and rivers in its course is  
desirable.  
  
“ Jn all your intercourse with the natives, treat them in the  
most friendly and conciliatory manner which their own conduct  
will admit; allay all jealousies as to the object of your journey;  
satisfy them of its innocence; make them acquainted with the po-  
sition, extent, character, peaceable and commercial dispositions of  
the United States: of our wish to be neighbourly, friendly, and use-

and furnish them with authority to call on our officers on their en-  
tering the United States, to have them conveyed to this place at  
the public expense. If any of them should wish to have some  
of their young people brought up with us, and taught such arts  
as may be useful to them, we will receive, instruct, and take care  
of them. Such a mission, whether of influential chiefs, or of  
young people, would give some security to your own party. Car-  
ry with you some matter of the kine-pox; inform those of them  
with whom you may be of its efficacy as a preservative from the  
small pox, and instruct and encourage them in the use of it. This  
may be especially done wherever you winter.  
  
“ As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will  
be received by those people, whether with hospitality or hostility,  
so it is impossibe to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance  
with which you are to pursue your journey. We value too much  
the lives of citizens to offer them to probable destruction. Your  
numbers will be sufficient to secure you against the unauthorized  
opposition of individuals, or of small parties; but if a superior  
force, authorized, or not authorized, by a nation, should be arrayed  
against your further passage, and inflexibly determined to arrest  
it, you must decline its further pursuit and return. In the loss of  
yourselves we should lose also the information you will have ac-  
quired. By returning safely with that, you may enable us to re-  
new the essay with better calculated means. To your own dis-  
cretion, therefore, must be left the degree of danger you may risk,  
and the point at which you should decline, only saying we wish  
you to err on the side of your safety, and to bring back your party  
safe, even if it be with less information.  
  
“ As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend, an  
intercourse will probably be found to exist between them and the  
Spanish posts of St. Lewis opposite Cahokia, or St. Genevieve op-  
posite Kaskaskia. From still further up the river the traders may  
furnish a conveyance fer letters. Beyond that you may perhaps  
be able to engage Indians to bring letters for the government to  
Cahokia, or Kaskaskia, on promising that they shall there receive  
such special compensation as you shall have stipulated with them.  
Avail yourself of these means to communicate to us, at seasonable  
intervals, a copy of your journal, notes and observations of every  
kind, putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed.

_*To Meriwether Lewis, esquire, captain of the first regiment  
of infantry of the United Statesof America.  
  
“Your situation as secretary of the President of the United  
States. has made you acquainted with the objeets of my confiden-  
tial message of January 18, 1803, t the legislature; you have  
seen the act they passed. which though expressed in general  
terms, Was ineant to sanction those objects, and you are appoint-  
ed to carry them into execution.  
  
*Instrumepts for mena ome by celestial observation, the geo-  
graphy of the country through which you will pass, have been  
  
already provided. Light arucles for barter and presents among  
  
men, buats, tents, and other travelling apparatus, with ammuni-  
tion, medicine, surgical instruments, and provisions, you will have  
prepared with such aids as the secretary at war can yield in his  
department; and from him also you will receive authority to en.  
  
gage among our woups, by voluutary agreement the number of  
  
attendants above mentioned; over whom you, as their command.  
ing officer, are invested with all the powers the laws give in such  
a case.  
  
“As your movements, while within the limits of the United  
States, will be better directed by occasional communieations adapt-  
ed to circumstances, as they arise, they will not be noticed here.  
What fillows will respect your proceedings after your departure  
from the United States.  
  
“Your mission has been communicated to the ministers here  
from France, Spain, and Great Britain, and through them to their  
governments: and such assurances given them as to its objects, as  
we trust will satisfy them. ‘The country of Louisiana having  
been ceded by Spain to France, the passport you have from the  
minister of France, the representative of the present sovereign of  
the country, will be a protection with all its subjects; and that  
from the minister of England will entitle you to the friendly aid  
of any traders of that allegiance with whom you may happen te  
meet.  
  
“fhe object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river,  
and such panes streams of it, as. by its course and commmu-e  
cation with the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the Colum-  
bia, Orevan, Colorado, or any other river, may offer the most direct  
and praticable water communication across the continent, for the  
purposes of commerce.  
  
“Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri; you will take obser-  
vations of latitude and longitude, at ail remarkable points on the  
‘aver, and especially at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands,  
and other places and objects distinguished by such natural marks  
wad characters of a durable kind, as that they may with certainty  
be recognized hereafter. The courses of the river between these  
points of observation may be supplied by the compass, the Jog-  
line, aud by time corrected by the observations theinselves. The  
variations of the needle, tov, in different places should be noticed.  
  
“fhe interesting points of the portage between the heads of  
the Missouri, and ot the water offering the best communication  
with the Paeitie ocean, should also be fixed by observation, and  
the course of that water to the ocean, im the same manner as that  
of the Missouri.  
  
Your observations are to be taken with great pains avid accu-  
racy; to be entered distinctly and intellicibly for others as  
well as yourself, to comprehend all the elements necessary, with  
the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude and longitude of the  
places at which they were taken; and are to be rendered to the  
war Office, for the purpose of having the calculations made cov-  
currently by proper persons within the United States. Several  
copies of these, as weil as other notes, shuuld be made at leisure  
times, and put into the care of the most trusteworthy of your at  
tendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental  
losses to which they will be exposed.—A further guard would be,  
that one of these copies be on the citicula membranes of the  
paperwbirch, as less liable to injury from damp than commen pa-  
per.  
  
“The commerce which may be carried on with the people in.  
habiting the line you will pursue, renders a knowledge vf those  
people important. You will therefore endeavor to make yourself  
acquainted,

United States; of our wish to be neighborly, friendly, and useful  
to them, and of our disposition toa commercial intercourse with  
them; confer with thein on the points most convenient as mutual,  
emporiums, and the articles of most desirable interchange for  
them and us. If a few of their influential chiefs, within prac-  
ticable distamee, wish to visit us, arrange such a visit with them,  
and furnish them with authority to call on our officers on enter-  
ing the United States, to have them conveyed to this place at the  
public expense. If any of unem should wish to have some of  
their people brought up with us and taught such arts as may be  
useful to them we will] receive, instruct, and take care of them.  
Such 9 mission, whether of influential chiefs, or of young people  
would give some security to yourown party. Carry with you,  
Ssuine matter of the kine-pox;istorm those of them with whom  
you may be of its efficacy as a preservative from the small-pox,  
and instruct and encourage them in the use of it. This may be-  
especially done wherever you winter.  
  
**As itis impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will  
be received by those people, whether with hospitality or hostility,  
80 is it impossible to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance  
with which you are to pursue your journey. We value too much  
the lives of citizens to offer them to probable destruction. Your  
numbers wil) be sufficient to secure you against the unauthoriz-  
ed opposition of individuals or of small parties; but if a superior  
foree, authorized or not authorized, by a nation, should be array-  
ed against your further passage, and inflexibly determined to ar-  
rest it, you must decline its further pursuit and return. In the  
loss of yourselves we should Jose also the infurmation you will  
bave required. By returning safely with that, you may enable  
us to renew the essay with better calculated means. To your  
own discretion, therefore, must be left the degree of danger you  
may risk, and the pojnt at which you should decline, only saying,  
we wish you to err on the side of your safety, and to bring back  
your party safe, even if it be with less infurmation.  
  
“As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend, an  
intercourse will probably be found to exist between them and the  
Spanish posts of St. Louis opposite Cahokia, or St. Genevieve  
opposite Kaskaskia. From stil) further up the river, the traders  
may furnish a conveyanee for letters. Beyond that you may per-  
haps be able to eugage Indians to bring your letters for the  
government to Cahokia, or Kaskaskia, on promising that they  
shall there receive such special compensation as you shall have  
stipulated with them. Avail yourself of these means to commu.  
nicate to us, at seasonable tervals, a copy of your journal, notes  
and observations of every Kind, putting into cypher whatever  
might doinjury if betrayed.  
  
“Should you reach the Pacific ocean, inform yourself of the  
Circuinstances which may deeide whether the furs of tose parts  
may not be colleeted as advantageously at the head of the Mis-  
sourl (convenient as is supposed to the waters of the Colorado  
aud Oregan or Columbia) as at Nootka Sound, or any other point  
of that coast; and t..at trade be cousequenily can‘ucted through  
the Missouri and United States more beneficially than by the  
eircum-navigation now practised.  
  
“On your arrival ov that coast, endeavour to learn if their be  
any port within your reach frequented by the sea vessels of any  
nation, and to send two of your trusty peaple back by sea. in such  
way as shall appear practicable, with a copy of your notes; and  
should you be of opinion that the return of your party by the  
way they went will be imminently dangerous, then ship the  
whole, and return by sea, by the way either of Cape Horn, or the  
\Cape of Good Hope, as you shall he able. As you will oe with-

that the object of the mission had been communicated to the ministers in  
Washington of France, Spain, Great Britain, and that the country of  
Louisiana having been ceded by Spain to France, a passport from the  
minister of France had been obtained. It further stated that the object  
of the mission was to explore the Missouri river and such _ principal  
streams of it as, by its course and communication with the waters of the  
Pacific ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado, or any other  
river, might. offer the most direct and practicable water communication  
across the continent for the purpose of commerce. It was directed that  
operations should be begun at the mouth of the Missouri river; that  
observations of latitude and longitude should be taken at all remarkable  
points on the river ; that the course of the river between points of obser-  
vation should be supplied by points of the compass, the log-line, and by  
time corrected by the observations themselves. The interesting points  
of the portage between the heads of the Missouri and the water offering  
the best communication with the Pacific ocean were directed to be fixed  
by observation, and the course of that water to the ocean in the same  
manner as that of the Missouri.  
  
Special instructions were given to the director of the expedition to  
make himself acquainted with the names of the nations of Indians he  
should encounter and their numbers. He was also to inquire and ascer-  
tain the extent of their possessions; their relations with other tribes or  
nations; their language, traditions, monuments; their ordinary occupa-  
tions in agriculture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, and the implements for  
these ; their food, clothing, and domestic accommodations ; the diseases  
prevalent among them, and the remedies they use; the moral and  
physical circumstances which distinguish them from known tribes; pecu-

also suggested that as far up the Missouri as the white settlements ex-
