“Honour rewards the Brave and bold alone  
She spurns the Timirous, Indolent and base  
Danger and Toil stand stern before her Throne  
And guard, so Jove commands the sacred place  
Who seeks her must the mighty cost sustain  
And pay the price of Fame, Labour, care and pain.”  
  
We are very anxious for the French Fleet, which saild after How, the day before the severest North East Storm ever known at this season of the year. Nothing has been heard of them since and to day is 9 days since they went out.  
The commissioners of Britain make not only a small but an ignominious figure. I cannot help considering them in the Light of the Fallen Angles in Milton who meditating upon their own miserable State and lost Liberties are desirous of involving this New world, this paridice of Freedom in the same chains and thraldom with their own and thus consulting,  
  
“Here perhaps some advantageous act may be achievd  
By sudden onset, or with tempting Bribe  
To waste this whole creation or possess all as our own  
and drive, as we are driven the puny habitants  
or if not drive, seduce them to our party,  
that their God may prove their foe  
And with repenting hand, abolish his own work.”  
  
  
They too like the Grand Deceiver must be making use of the same instruments to effect their diabolical plans by tempting a Modern Eve to taste the forbidden Fruit. But tis with pleasure I find in the General and Statesman a more rigid virtue and incorruptable Heart than our primitive parent discoverd, tho perhaps it may be happy for the Gentleman that
