state of South CarolinaIn the House of Representatives December 6th  
1793  
  
The Committee to whom was referred the business of examining unto and ascertaining  
the truth of a Report—That an Armed force is now levying within this State by Persons  
under a foreign Authority without the pemission and Contrary to the express  
prohibition of the Government of the United States and of this State.  
Report—  
That they have made diligent Enquiry respecting the truth of this report and have  
collected such Evidence relating thereto as was immediately within their reach—That  
your Committee are perfectly satisfied from the information on the Oaths of divers  
credible Persons which they have received—That William Tate, Jacob R. Brown William  
Urby Robert Tate, Richard Speake Citizens of this State and other Persons unknown to  
your Committee also Citizens of this State have received &amp; accepted military  
Commissions, from M. Genet Minister Plenipotentiary from the Republic of France to the United States of America Authorising them and instructions  
requiring them, to raise, organise, train and Conduct Troops within the United States  
of America—That the avowed purpose for which these  
Troops are now raising is to rendezvous in the State of Georgia and from thence to  
proceed into the Spanish Dominions with a view to Conquest or plunder as their  
Strength might enable or opportunity might tempt them That in the Event of a French  
Fleet approaching the Coa[s]ts of the Southen States a junction and co:operation with  
it is contemplated by the Persons abovementioned But that tho this was the avowed  
Object of these Troops and their Leaders among themselves from the injunction to  
conceal the whole System from persons not initiated and the Subordination established  
to Mr Genet, the author of the plan and the Source of Authority to the Officers—It is  
probable that the Corps when raised must yeild to any change of destination which the  
Judgment or inclination of M. Genet may point out to them: That several of the Persons  
above named received together with their Commissions instructions by which they were  
to regulate their enrollments of Men Stating the pay, rations, Cloathing, plunder and  
division of conquered Land, to be allotted to the officers and Men who should enter  
into this Service and marking the proportions of the Acquisitions to be reserved to  
the republic of France. That the persons abovenamed in pursuance of the powers vested  
in them by the said Commissions and in obedience to the instructions of M. Genet and  
his Agents particularly  
M. Mangourit who signed some of the papers have  
proceeded by themselves and by their Agents without any Authority from the United  
States, or from this State to enroll numbers of the Citizens of this State whom they  
deluded with the hopes of plunder and the Acquisition of riches in the Service of the  
Republic of France to be subject to the orders of M. Genet the Minister  
plenipotentiary of France.  
That Stephen Drayton and John Hamilton also Citizens of this State have made  
application to the Good Citizens thereof to engage in this scheme of raising Men in  
this State for the Service of France to Act under the orders of M. Genet, and to  
commit Acts of hostility against nations at peace with the United States of America,  
and have avowed that they acted by the Authority of M. Genet the Minister  
plenipotentiary of the Republic of France: That upon  
the whole of the information which your Committee have been able to  
obtain This is a daring and dangerous attempt by a Foreign Minister to intermeddle in  
the Affairs of the United States, to usurp the powers of Government and to levy Troops  
in the bosom of the Union without the Authority and contrary to the express Sense of  
the Government of the United States and in Violation of the Laws of Nations.  
That the direct tendency of these measures of the foreign Minister is to disturb the  
internal tranquility of the United States and to involve them in hostilities with  
Nations with whom they are now at peace, which sound policy requires should be  
preserved.  
That in the Opinion of your Committe this attempt is the more dangerous, and alarming  
as many Citizens of the United States, have been thereby Seduced from their duty by  
insiduous Arts practised on their kindred Affection to the french Republic and have  
been drawn into a Scheme in the execution of which they have usurped the functions of  
Government and exercised the power of the sword which the wisdom of the Constitution  
hath vested exlusively in the Congress and President of the United States—That this  
Committee therefore recommend that the Governor of this State be requested to issue  
his proclamation forbidding all persons from enrolling any of the Citizens of this  
State and prohibiting the Citizens from enlisting under any Officers or for any  
purposes not previously Sanctioned by the Government of the United States or of this  
State And also forbidding all unlawful Assemblages of Troops unauthorized by  
Government, And that the Governor be requested to  
exert the whole public force to the utmost extent if necessary to insure obedience to  
his proclamation.  
That in the oppinion of this Committee the said William Tate Jacob R. Brown Robert  
Tate, Stephen Drayton John Hamilton and Richard Speke have been guilty of Hight Crimes  
and Misdemeanours and they recommend that the Attorney General and Solicitors be  
directed forthwith to institute or cause to be instituted and conducted prosecutions  
in the proper Courts of Law against the said William Tate Jacob R. Brown Robert Tate,  
Stephen Drayton John Hamilton and Richard Speke for accepting or engaging to accept  
Commissions from a foreign power to raise Troops within the United States and for  
going about within the State levying or Attempting to levy Troops and for seducing and  
endeavouring to seduce the Citizens of this State to enroll themselves for foreign Service to commit Acts of hostility against Nations with whom  
the United States are at peace without the permission of the Government and contrary  
to the proclamation of the President of the United States declaring these States to be  
in a State of Nutrality and Peace—That Copies of the Evidence collected by this  
Committee together with the proceedings of this House thereon be forwarded immediately  
to the President of the United States and to the Executives of the State of North  
Carolina and Georgia for their information.  
Resolved Unanimously that this House do concur in the said Report.

1 hat upon the whole of the informa­

to levy troops in the bosom of the Union,
