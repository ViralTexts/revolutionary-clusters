About ten days ago the severe freezing Weather formed some pretty strong Ice from Dorchester to Boston Neck, and from Roxbury to the Common—this I thought (knowing the Ice could not last) a favourable oppertunity to make an Assault upon the Troops in Town—I proposed it in Council; but behold! though we had been waiting all the year for this favourable Event, the enterprize was thought too dangerous! perhaps it was—perhaps the irksomeness of my Situation led me to undertake more than could be warranted by prudence—I did not think so, and am sure, yet, that the Enterprize, if it had been undertaken with resolution must have succeeded; without it, any would fail; but it is now at an end, and I am preparing to take Post on Dorchester to try if the Enemy will be so kind as to come out to us.

March 9th. Colo. Bull still waiting to see a little further into the Event of things; gives me an oppertunity of adding, that from a Gentleman out of Boston, confirmd by a Paper from the Select Men there we have undoubted Information of Genl Howes preparing with ⟨g⟩reat precipitancy to Imbark his Troops—for what place we know not—Hallifax it is said. The Select men being under dreadful apprehensions for the Town applied to Genl Robinson, to apply to Genl Howe; who through Genl Robinson has inform’d them that it is not his Intentions to destroy the Town unless his Majesty’s Troops should be Molested during their Imbarkation or at their Departure. this Paper seems so much under Covert—unauthenticated—and address’d to [no] body—that I sent word to them (that is the Selectmen) that I could take [no] notice of it—but shall go on with my preparations as intended. The Gentlemen abovementioned out of Boston says they seem to be in gr⟨e⟩at consternation there. that one of our shot from Lambs Dam disabled Six men in their Beds, &amp; that the Admiral upon discovering of our Works next Morning informd the Genl that unless we were dispossessed of them he could not keep the Kings ships in the Harbour; &amp; that 3000 men, Commanded by Lord Percy were actually Imbarkd for that purpose—the Issue of it you have been informed of before.

* About ten days ago the severe freezing  
weather formed some pretty strong ice  
from Dorchester to Boston Neck, and  
from Roxburg to the Common. This I  
thought, knowi ing the ice could not last,  
a favourable opportunity to make an as-  
sault upon the troops in town. I pro-  
posed it in council; but behold, though  
we had been waiting all the year for this  
favourable event, the enterprise was  
thought too dangerous. Perhaps it was;  
pe rhaps the irksomeness of my situation  
led me to undertake more than could be  
warranted by prudence. I did not think  
so, and I am sure yet, that the enter-  
prise, if it had been undertaken with  
resolution, must have succeeded; with-  
out it, any would fail.”—pp. 71, 72.  
  
We may easily believe that one so  
formed to gain his soldiers’ hearts was  
deeply beloved by them. He fought  
their battles in the field and with the  
senate; for it was his menacing re-  
monstrances that wrung from Con-  
gress and the States even the meagr
