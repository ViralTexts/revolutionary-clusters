Sir  
Head Quarters Cambridge 19 March 1776  
  
It is with the greatest pleasure I inform you that on Sunday last, the 17th Instant, about 9 O’Clock in the forenoon, The Ministerial Army evacuated the Town of Boston, and that the Forces of the United Colonies are now in actual possession thereof. I beg leave to congratulate you Sir, &amp; the honorable  
  
Congress—on this happy Event, and particularly as it was effected without endangering the lives &amp; property of the remaining unhappy Inhabitants.  
I have great reason to imagine their flight was precipitated by the appearance of a Work which I had Order’d to be thrown up last Saturday Night, on an Eminence at Dorchester which lay nearest to Boston Neck, call’d Newks Hill. The Town, although it has suffer’d greatly is not in so bad a state as I expected to find it, and I have a particular pleasure in being able to inform you Sir, that your house has receiv’d no damage worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable Order and the family pictures are all left entire and untouch’d. Capt. Cazneau takes Charge of the whole until he shall receive further Orders from you.  
As soon as the Ministerial Troops had quitted the Town, I order’d a thousand Men (who had had the Small Pox) under Command of General Putnam to take possession of the Heighths, which I shall endeavour to fortify in such a manner as to prevent their return should they attempt it, but as they are still in the Harbour I thought it not prudent to march off with the Main Body of the Army until I should be fully satisfied they had quitted the Coast—I have therefore only detach’d five Regiments, beside the Rifle Battalion, to New York, and shall keep the remainder here till all Suspicion of their return ceases.  
The Situation in which I found their Works evidently discovered that their retreat was made with the greatest precipitation—They have left their Barracks &amp; other Works of Wood at Bunkers Hill &amp;c. all standing, &amp; have destroy’d but a small part of their Lines. They have also left a number of fine pieces of Cannon, which they first spik’d up, also a very large Iron Mortar, and (as I am inform’d) they have thrown another over the end of your Wharf—I have employ’d proper Persons to drill the Cannon &amp; doubt not shall save the most of them. I am not yet able to procure an exact list of all the Stores they have left, as soon as it can be done I shall take care to transmit it to you. From an Estimate of what the Quarter Master Gen’ral has already discover’d the Amount will be 25 or 30,000£.  
Part of the Powder mention’d in yours of the 6th Instt, has already arriv’d—The remainder I have order’d to be stop’d on the Road as we shall have no occasion for it here. The Letter to  
  
General Thomas I immediately sent to him, he desir’d leave for three or four days to settle some of his private Affairs after which he will set out for his Command in Canada—I am happy that my Conduct in intercepting Lord Drummond’s Letter is approv’d of by Congress. I have the honor to be, w

Sik, Head-Quarters, Cambridge, March 19, 1776  
  
‘ It is with the greateft pleafure I inform you, that, on funday  
Inft, thé feventeenth inftant, about nine o‘clock in the forenoon,  
the minifterial army evacuated the town of Botton, and that the  
forces of the United Colonies ‘are now in aétual pofleflion  
thereof. I beg leave to congratulate you, fir, and the honorable  
Congres, on this happy event, and particularly as-it was effected  
without endangering the lives and property of the remaining unhap-  
py inhabitants.  
  
‘ I have great reafon to imagine their flight was precipitated by  
the appearance of a work which [had ordered to be thrown up latt  
fat tirday night on an eminence at Dorchefter which lay neareft to  
Bofton neck, called Nuke-hill.  
  
‘ The town, although it has fuffered greatly, is not in fo bad a  
ftate as I expected to find it; and I have a particular pleafure in  
being able to inform you, fir, that your houfe has received no  
damage worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and  
the family pictures are all left entire and untouched. Captain Caz-  
neau takes charge uf the whole, until he fhall receive further orders  
from you.  
  
¢ Astoon as the minifterial troops had quitted the wate: T order-  
ed a thoufand men (who had had the fmall- pox), under command  
of general Putnam, to take poffeflion ef the heights, which I thall  
endeavor to fortify in fuch a manner’ as to prevent their return,  
fhould they attempt it. But, as they are {till in the harbor, I thought  
it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I  
thould be fully fatisfied they. had quitted the coaft.~ I have there-  
fore ‘only detached five regiments, befides the rifle batallion, to  
New-York, and fhall keep the remainder here till all tufpicion of  
their return ceales.  
  
‘ The  
  
  
  
  
  
UU  
  
General Wafbington’s Official Letters, 433  
  
© The fituation in which I found their works evidently difcovered  
that their retreat was made with the greateft precipitation. They have  
left their barracks and other works ‘of wood at Bunker&#x27;s hill, &amp;c, all  
ftanding, and have deftroyed but a fmall part of the® lines. They have  
alfo left a number of fine pieces-of cannon which they firft {piked up,  
alfo a very large iron mortar; and, as I am informed, they have  
thrown another ever the end of your wharf. I have employed proper  
perfons to drill the cannon, and doubt not I fhall fave the moft of  
them.—I am not yet able to procure an exact lift of all the ftores  
they have left. As foon as it can be done, I fhall take care to tranf-  
mit it to you.— From an eftimate of what the quarter-mafter-general  
has already difcovered, the amount will be twenty-five or “thirty -  
thoufand pounds.  
  
‘ Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the fixth inftant has  
already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be {topped on  
the road, as we fhall have no occafion for it here. —The letter to general  
Thomas, I immediately fent to him. He defired leave for three or  
four days, to fettle fome of his private affairs; after which, he will  
fet out for his command in Canada.—I am ha ippy that my conduc  
in intercepting lord Drummond’sletter is approved of by Congrefs.—  
I have the honor tobe, &amp;c. G. W.
