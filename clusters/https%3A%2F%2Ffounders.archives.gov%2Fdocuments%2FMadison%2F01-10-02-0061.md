[17 July 1787]  
  
McClurg moved to strike out seven years and insert “‘during good behavior’” (Farrand, RecordsMax Farrand, ed., The Records of the  
Federal Convention of 1787 (4 vols.; New Haven, 1911–37)., II, 33). He believed that since the executive had been made reeligible he would be dependent on the legislature and that the independence of the executive was essential.  
  
Mr. Madison. If it be essential to the preservation of liberty that the Legisl: Execut: &amp; Judiciary powers be separate, it is essential to a maintenance of the separation, that they should be independent of each other. The Executive could not be independent of the Legislure., if dependent on the pleasure of that branch for a re-appointment. Why was it determined that the Judges should not hold their places by such a tenure? Because they might be tempted to cultivate the Legislature, by an undue complaisance, and thus render the Legislature the virtual expositor, as well the maker of the laws. In like manner a dependence of the Executive on the Legislature, would render it the Executor as well as the maker of laws; &amp; then according to the observation of Montesquieu, tyrannical laws may be made that they may be executed in a tyrannical manner. There was an analogy between the Executive &amp; Judiciary departments in several respects. The latter executed the laws in certain cases as the former did in others. The former expounded &amp; applied them for certain purposes, as the latter did for others. The difference between them seemed to consist chiefly in two circumstances—1. the collective interests &amp; security were much more in the power belonging to the Executive than to the Judiciary department. 2. in the administration of the former much greater latitude is left to opinion and discretion than in the administration of the latter. But if the 2d. consideration proves that it will be more difficult to establish a rule sufficiently precise for trying the Execut: than the Judges, &amp; forms an objection to the same tenure of office, both considerations prove that it might be more dangerous to suffer a Union between the Executive &amp; Legisl: powers, than between the Judiciary &amp; Legislative powers. He conceived it to be absolutely necessary to a well constituted Republic that the two first shd. be kept distinct &amp; independent of each other. Whether the plan proposed by the motion was a proper one was another question, as it depended on the practicability of instituting a tribunal for impeachmts. as certain &amp; as adequate in the one case as in the other. On the other hand, respect for the mover entitled his proposition to a fair hearing &amp; discussion, until a less objectionable expedient should be applied for guarding agst. a dangerous union of the Legislative &amp; Executive departments.

re during good behavior, insisting that it would be the first step towards monarchy.  
  
Mr. Madison was not apprehensive of being thought to favor any step towards monarchy. The real object with him was to prevent its introduction. Experience had proved a tendency in our governments to throw all power into the Legislative vortex. The Executives of the States are in general little more than Cyphers; the legislatures omnipotent. If no effectual check be devised for restraining the instability &amp; encroachments of the latter, a revolution of some kind or other would be inevitable. The preservation of Republican Govt. therefore required some expedient for the purpose, but required evidently at the same time that in devising it, the genuine principles of that form should be kept in view.

Two days thereafter, he used the following

with the Executive in the revisionary  
power.&quot; From these debates we  
make the following extracts. Mr  
MA dison said:  
&quot;If it be essential to the preservation  
of liberty that the legislative, executive  
and judicial powers be separate, it is es  
sential to the maintainance of the separa  
tion that they should be independent of  
each other. The executive could not be  
independent of the legislature, if depend  
ent on the pleasure of that branch for  
reappointment. Why was it determined  
that the judges should not hold their  
laces by such a tenure? Because they  
might be tempted to cultivate the legisla­  
ture by an undue complaisance, and thus  
render the legislature the virtual exposi-  
 as well as the maker, of the laws. In  
like manner, a dependence of the execu  
tive on the legislature would render it  
the executor as well as the maker of the  
laws; and then, according to the observa­  
tion of Montesquien, tyrannical laws may  
be made that may be executed in a tyran­  
nical maniter.&quot;  
Mr. Madison again said: &quot;Experience  
had proved a tendency in our Govern­  
ment to throw all power into the legisla­  
tive vortex.&quot; &quot;If no effectual check be  
devised for restraing the instability and  
encrouchments of the latter (the Congress)  
a revolution of some kind or another  
would be inevitable.
