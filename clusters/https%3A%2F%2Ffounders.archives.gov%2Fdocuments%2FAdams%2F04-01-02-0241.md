 we might sit under our own vine and eat the good of the land.  
I feel a gaieti de Coar to which before I was a stranger. I think the Sun looks brighter, the Birds sing more melodiously, and Nature puts on a more chearfull countanance. We feel a temporary peace, and the poor fugitives are returning to their deserted habitations.  
Tho we felicitate ourselves, we sympathize with those who are trembling least the Lot of Boston should be theirs. But they cannot be in similar circumstances unless pusilanimity and cowardise should take possession of them. They have time and warning given them to see the Evil and shun it.—I long to hear that you have declared an independancy—and by the way in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If perticuliar care and attention is not paid to the Laidies we are determined to foment a Rebelion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.  
That your Sex are Naturally Tyrannical is a Truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute, but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of Master for the more tender and endearing one of Friend. Why then, not put it out of the power of the vicious and the Lawless to use us with cruelty and indignity with impunity. Men of Sense in all Ages abhor those customs which treat us only as the vassals of your Sex. Regard us then as Beings placed by providence under your protection and in immitation of the Supreem Being make use of that power only for our happiness.

could. If particular care and attention is not  
paid to the ladies we are determined to foment  
a rebellion, and will not bold ourselves bound

truth so thoroughly established as to admit of

all ages abhor those customs which treat uh  
only as the vassals of your sex; regard us then  
as being placed by Providence under your pro­  
tection, and in imitation of the Supreme Being,  
make use of that power only for our happiness.*

r inferiority appears.  
  
Mr. Ingalls says:  
  
Perhaps the strangest feature of this  
movement is the fact that, from the time  
Eve left Paradise till the advent of Miss  
Anthony, woman was apparently content  
with her subordination.  
  
He says women did not think of the  
Declaration of Independence as applying  
tothem. Mr. Ingalls is as ill informed in  
regard to the history of the movement as  
in regard to its philosophy. In March,  
1776, Abigail Adams, who was destined  
to be the wife of one President of the  
United States and the mother of another,  
wrote to her husband, then in the Con-  
tinental Congress:  
  
i long to hear that you have declared  
an independency; and, by the way, in the  
new code of laws which I suppose it will  
be necessary for you to make, I desire  
you would remember the ladies, and be  
more generous and favorable to them  
than your ancestors... . Lf particular  
care and attention are not paid to the  
ladies, we are determined to foment a re-  
bellion, and will not hold ourselves bound  
by any laws in which we have no voice or  
representation.
