 following allegations.  
“ Said Emery was on the 22d day of  
November, 18C3, lawfully possessed of  
certain goods and chattels to the value  
of $10,000, and being so possessed thereof  
the said Frank H.Emery, afterwards on  
the 22d day of November, 18E3, at Gor­  
ham, casually lost the said goods, and  
chattels out of his possession, and the  
same afterwards came into the possession  
of Cullen C.Chapman, Charles J. Chap­  
man and Robert Chapman by finding  
the same. Yet the said Chapman’s well  
knowing the said goods and chattels to  
be the property of Frank H.Emery and  
of right to belong and pertain to him  
but contriving&#x27;and fraudulently intending  
craftily and subtilly to deceive and de­  
fraud the said Frank H. Emery in this  
behalf, have not as yet delivered the said  
goods and chattels or any part thereof to  
said Emery, though often requested to  
do so and had wholly refused to do so and  
afterwards, on the 22nd day of Novem­  
ber, converted and disposed of the said  
goods and chattels to their own use.
