The undersigned Merchants residing at the Port and within the district of New Haven, respectfully remonstrate against the late removal of Elizur Goodrich Esqr. from the Office of Collector for the district of New Haven, and the appointment of Samuel Bishop Esqr. to fill the Vacancy.—As the ground of our remonstrance we represent that the office while filled by Mr Goodrich was conducted with a promptness integrity and ability satisfactory to the mercantile Interest of the district—a promptness and ability not to be found in his successor.—  
Believing the Character of E Goodrich Esqr. as an officer to be unexceptionable, we lament that it should be conceived necessary, that a change in the administration must produce a change in the subordinate officers, and in this instance we have especially to lament that certain measures have succeeded in deceiving the President so far as to induce him to appoint a man to an important office, who does not possess those qualifications necessary for the discharge of its duties.—We hesitate not to say that had the President known the circumstances and situation of the Candidate, he would have rejected the application.—To prove this let facts be submitted to the consideration of the President.—  
Samuel Bishop Esqr. will be seventy eight years old in November next.  
He is labouring under the full portion of those infirmities which are incident to that advanced period of life.  
With these infirmities and an alarming loss of eyesight, though he was once a decent penman, it is now with difficulty he can even write his name.—  
He was never bred an accountant—nor has the course of his business, ever led him to an acquaintance with the most simple forms of accounting—  
He is totally unacquainted with the system of Revenue Laws and the forms of doing mercantile business, and is now too far advanced in life, and too much enfeebled both in body and mind, ever to learn either.—  
A man whose age, whose infirmities and want of the requisite knowledge is such, is unfit to be the Collector for the district of New Haven.—  
We are aware that it may be said, he has sustained with reputation, and now holds, several offices in the City Town and County,—but it will be remembered that none of them are by recent promotion—his office of Mayor he holds by Charter during the pleasure of the legislature.—and he is continued as Judge of the County Court and Town Clerk, because the people of this State are not in the habit of neglecting those who once enjoyed their confidence, by a long course of usefulness.  
Knowing the man as we do, we do not hesitate to say that he cannot, without aid, perform a single official act.—  
It may be said that the appointment was with a view to the aid of his son Abraham Bishop Esqr. and that he is to be the real Collector.—We presume that the business must be done by him if done at all—Yet we cannot be led to believe that the President would knowingly appoint a person to the discharge of duties to which he was incompetent with a design that they should be performed by his son.—If however this was the case we explicitly state that Abraham Bishop Esqr. is so entirely destitute of public confidence.—so conspicuous for his enmity to Commerce and opposition to order, and so odious to his fellow citizens that we presume, his warmest partizans would not have hazarded a recommendation of him.  
Knowing these facts, of which we must believe the President ignorant, and relying on assurances, “that he will promote the general welfare without regarding distinction of parties,” we cherish the idea that our grief, at the rejection of Mr Goodrich, will not be augmented by the continuance of a father utterly unqualified for the office, or of a son so universally contemned.  
We assure the President that the sentiments thus expressed are the sentiments of the Merchants and Importers of the district.—That such a class of citizens should be heard patiently, and their well founded complaints redressed, if practicable, we are fully persuaded.—If it be an object of importance, “to restore harmony to social intercourse” and if a decision “at the bar of public reason,” be worthy of attention, surely such a portion of the Community, will not plead in vain, for a reconsideration of this appointment, and that such an important office may be filled, by a person competent to the performance of its duties, and in some degree acceptable to the public

A&gt; thi irrotlud of &gt;ur remonltrance we r ■

Believing the character of E. Goodrich,  
El q. as an officer to be Unexceptionable  
we ;• &#x27;i e ;t that it ihoula be conceived ne­  
ceu .iy, that a change in theadmittiftration  
mult product a change in tlu* fubordinate  
officers, and in this inftance we have el&#x27;pe­  
cially to b&#x27;.ment that certain meafures have

as to induce him to appoint a man to an  
important office, who does not poffefs thole j  
qualification? neceffary for the difchargeof  
its duties. .Ve helitate not to fay that  
had the Prtiident known the circuinftances j

He is Itb juring under a full portion of &#x27;

can even write his name.— i  
He was neve bred an accountant—nor 1

tem of revenue laws,aod the forms ot doing i  
mercantile huftnefs, and is now too far ad- I  
Vunced in life,and too muclyenfeebled both  
in body and mind, ever to learn either.— &lt;  
A man whofe age, whofe infirmities, i  
and want of the requifite knowledge is fuch, j  
is unfit to be the collector of the diftriCt of  
New- Haven.  
We are aware that it may be faid be has  
fuft tined with -p -.tatioa, and now hold .. 1

town-clerk, bet aufe the people of this ltate  
are not in the habit of neglecting thofe  
who once enjoyed their confidence by 51  
long courfe of ulVfulnefs.  
Knowing the man as we dr&gt;, we do not  
hefitate to fay that he cannot, without  
aid, perform a fingle official aft.  
It i&#x27;. iy he laid that the appointment was  
wthav wto the aid of his fort Abraham

wnuld knowingly appoint a perfon to tin i  
difchargeof duties to which he was incorci  
pef-nt, vith a defign that they fhotild b.

A man whofe age, whofe infir-

We are aware that it may be  
faid, he has fultained with repura-  
tien, and now holds fevera] offices

but it will be remembered thag  
none of them are bs recent pro-  
motion ; his office of Mayor he  
huids by Charter, during the plea-  
fare of the Legiflature ; and he is  
continued as Judge of the County  
Court, and Town Clerk, becaufe  
the people of this State are not in

that the Prefident would knowing-  
ly appoint a perfon to the difcharge

for his enmity to commerce, and  
oppofirion to order, and fo adious.  
tu his teow citizens, that we pre-  
fame his warmeft partizans would

The underpinned merchants reliJing at  
the port and within the diltrict of New-  
Haven, reflectively remonftrate aga&#x27;.nft  
the late removal of Elizur Goodrich, efq.  
from the oifice of Collector for the dilt-  
rict of New-Haven, and the appointment  
of Samuel Bilhop, efp. to fill his vacancy.  
As the ground of our remonftrance, we  
re pre ft nt tliat the office, while filled by  
Mr. Goodrich was conducted with a  
promptnefs, integrity and ability, falif  
factory to the mercantile intereft of this  
Diltrict — a promptnefs and ability not to  
be found in his fucceflor — Believing the  
character of Elizur Goodrich, efq. as a  
public officer to be unexceptionable, we  
lament that it fliouldbe conceived necef-  
fary, that a change in the adminiftration  
mud produce a ch inge iii the fubordinate  
officers, and in that inttante, we have ef-  
pecially to lament, that certain meafures  
have fucceeded in deceiving the prefident  
fo far as to induce him to appoint a man  
to an important office, who does not pof-  
fefs thofe qualifications necefTary for the  
difcharge of its duties. We htlitate not  
to fay, that had the prelider.t known the  
tircumftances and iituation of the candi-  
date, he would have rejected the applica-  
tion. — T6 prove this let facts be fubmit-  
tecl to the confideration of the prefident.  
—Samuel Bilhop, efq. will be 78 years  
old in November next. —  
  
He is labouring under a full portion of  
thofe infirmities which are incident to  
that advanced period of life.—  
  
With thefe infirmities and an alarming  
lofs of eyeiight, though he was once a de-  
cent penman, it is now with difficulty he  
can even writs his name. —  
  
He was never bred an accountant — nor  
has the courfe of his hufinefs,ever led him  
10 an acquaintance with the moft Ample  
forms of accounting. —  
  
He is totally unacquainted with the  
fyftcm of Revenue Laws, and the forms  
of doing mercantile bufinefs, and is now  
too far advanced in life, and too much  
enfeebled both in body and mind, ever to  
learn either. —  
  
A man whofe age, whofe infirmites,  
and want of the requifite knowledge is  
fuch, is unfit to be the collector for the  
DiitriSt of New-Haven.  
  
We are aw 1 e that it may (&quot;aid,be he has  
fultained wi h reputation, and now holds,  
feveral offices in the City, Town, and  
County,— but it will be remembered that  
none of thsm are by recent promotion :  
his office of Mayor he holds by Charter  
during the pleafure of the Legiflature,  
and he is cont inued as Judge of the Coun-  
ty Court, and Town-Clerk, becaufe the  
people in this State are not in the habit  
of neglecting thofe who once enjoyed  
their confidence by a long courfe of ufe-  
fulnels.  
  
Knowing the man as we do, we do not  
hefuate to fay that he cannot, without aid  
perform a fingle official act.  
  
It may be faidthat the appointment  
was with aviewto theaidof hisfon Abrm.  
Bifhop, Efq. and that he is to be the real  
collector. We prefume the bufinefs muft  
be done bv him if done at all — Yet we  
cannot bo led to believe that the PrefidenY  
would knowingly appoint a perfon to the  
difcharge of duties to which he was in-  
competent, with a defign that they fhould  
  
be performed by his Ion. If however , at a much more advanced age our Franklin  
  
this was the cafe we explicitly Mate that  
Abraham Bifhop efq. is fo entirely defti-  
tute of public confidence, fo confpicuous  
for his enmity to commerce, and oppofiti-  
on to order, and fo odious to bis fellow  
citizens, that we prefume his warmed  
partizans would not have hazarded a re-  
commendation of him.  
  
Knowing thefe facts, of which we muft  
believe the Prefident ignorant, and rely-  
ing on affurances, &quot; that he will promote  
the general welfare, without regarding  
the diftinction of parties ; &quot; we cherifh  
the idea that o^r grief at the rejection of  
Mr. Goodrich, will not be augmented by  
the continuance of a fatherutterly unqua-  
ed for the office, or of a fon fo univerfal-  
1/ condemned.  
  
We affure the prefident that the fenti-  
ments thus expreffed, are the fentiments  
of tbe merchants and importers of the  
diftriet ; that fuch a clafs of citizens  
fliouldbe heard patiently, and their well  
founded complaints redreffed, if practible,  
we are fully perfuaded. If it be an ob-  
ject, &quot;to re ft ore harmony to focial inter.  
  
courfe,&quot; ar.d if a decifion, &quot; at the bar of  
public reafon,&#x27;&#x27; be woi.thy of attention,  
lately fuch a portion of the communi-
