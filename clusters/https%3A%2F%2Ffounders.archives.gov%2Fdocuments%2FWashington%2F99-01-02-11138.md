supplied from thence: those few instances excepted where it would be just to promote a very meritorious serjeant. For this end the number which shall be judged requisite to supply vacancies in the standing regiment must be fixed; and the students who are admitted with an  
expectation of filling them limited accordingly. They might be allowed subsistance at the public expense. If any other youth desired to pursue the same studies, at the military academy, they might be admitted; only subsisting themselves. These students should be instructed in  
what is usually called military discipline, tactics, and the theory &amp; practice of fortification and gunnery. The commandant and one or two other officers of the standing regiment, and the engineers, making West Point their general residence, would be the masters of the  
academy; and the inspector general superintend the whole.

Col. Timothy Pickering, Quarter-  
master-General of the army, after  
combating the idea of instituting  
academies for military purposes at  
the different arsenals in the United  
States, a scheme that had found fa-  
vor with some of the officers, said :  
‘‘Tf anything like a military acad-  
emy in America be practicable at  
this time, it must be founded on the  
permanent military establishment  
for our frontier arsenals and forts,  
and the wants of the States, sep-  
arately, of officers to command the  
defences on their sea-coasts.’’  
  
  
  
THE NECESSITY FOR ARMORIES  
  
‘‘On that principle it might be  
expedient to establish a military  
school or academy at West Point.  
And in order that a competent  
number of young gentlemen might  
be induced to become students  
thereat, it might be made a rule  
that vacancies in the standing regi-  
ments should be supplied thence ;  
those few instances excepted, where  
it would be just to promote a very  
meritorious sergeant.  
  
‘* For this end, the number which  
should be judged requisite to sup-  
ply vacancies in the standing regi-  
ments might be fixed, and that of  
the students admitted with a view  
to filling them be accordingly lim-  
ited.  
  
‘*They might be allowed subsist-  
ence at the public expense. If any  
other youth desired to pursue the  
same studies at the military acad-  
emy they might be admitted, but  
subsist themselves.  
  
‘“’Those students should be in-  
structed in what is usually called  
  
military discipline, tactics, and the  
theory and practice of gunnery and  
  
fortification. The Commandant,  
and one or two other officers of the  
standing regiments, and the En-  
gineers, making West Point their  
general residence, would be the  
Masters of the Academy; and the  
Inspector-General superintend the  
whole.”’
