It was probably during this week at Mount Vernon that Benjamin Dulany, George Digges, Jacky Custis, and Charles Willson Peale participated in an event which Peale later related: “One afternoon several young gentlemen, visiters at Mount Vernon, and myself were engaged in pitching the bar, one of the athletic sports common in those days, when suddenly the colonel appeared among us. He requested to be shown the pegs that marked the bounds of our efforts; then, smiling, and without putting off his coat, held out his hand for the missile. No sooner . . . did the heavy iron bar feel the grasp of his mighty hand than it lost the power of gravitation, and whizzed through the air, striking the ground far, very far, beyond our utmost limits. We were indeed amazed, as we stood around, all stripped to the buff, with shirt sleeves rolled up, and having thought ourselves very clever fellows, while the colonel, on retiring, pleasantly observed, ‘When you beat my pitch, young gentlemen, I’ll try again’” (CUSTISGeorge Washington Parke Custis.

He expired in that city on the 1st of January,

considered themselves pretty good at  
this sport, so popular in those days.  
These young men, of whom Peale was  
one, were stripped down for exercise,  
and had made some very good casts,  
when the Colonel (as Washington was  
then called) appeared among them. He  
was Invited to participate, and tho pegs  
which marked tho best records were  
shown him. With a smile that was  
doubtless childlike and bland Washlng-  
ton stepped to the line, took the bar, and  
proceeded to smash a large hole in the  
record.  
&quot;No sooner did the heavy Iron bar feel  
the grasp of his mighty hand than it had  
lost the power of gravitation,&quot; says  
Peale, &quot;and whizzed through the air,  
striking the ground far, far beyond our
