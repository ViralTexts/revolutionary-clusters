om the Citizens of the First Congressional District of Pennsylvania to the People of the United States  
20 May 1812, Philadelphia. “The friends of the United States and of their Constituted authorities, … deeply impressed with the solemnity of the impending Crisis and trusting that their voice will not be without some effect among the American people, have met together for the purpose of comparing and collecting the general sentiment in this quarter of the Republic, and submit the following as the deliberate, unbiased and unanimous result.  
“The story of American wrongs has been so often told, that the patriotic heart sickens at their disgusting recapitulation: Yet as prefacing this last appeal, and for this, as we most anxiously hope the last time, it may not be improper breifly to sketch an Outline of that unparalled, unmitigated, intolerable series of National outrages against which after too long an endurance the only Republic extant is now at length about to Exhibit the Magnificent Spectacle of an Empire of Freemen in the armour and attitude of defensive war—War for their Sovereignty, their rights, their blessings—War for the reclamation of their property, their persons—War for their homes and domestic altars—a War staved off till every possible effort at reconciliation has been put to beggary and shame—A War, to which not one distillation from the subtle and anti-republican essences of ambition … has contributed but which will flow pure from the rock of self-defence—A War without which … our Sovereignty is servility, our Commerce a Colonial trade, our persons exposed to pillage, our property to piracy, our boasted institutions piles of theoretical ruins, and peace itself, that most desireable of all political enjoyments, a contumely and a Curse.”  
The U.S. maintained neutrality during the European conflict not, as is alleged, to fatten “our soil with the disasters of the belligerents—for European wars and the British treaty restricted instead of expanding the immense commercial resources of the North American Continent”—but to pursue “the broad highways of emolument” and to acquire “in tranquility … whatever was not withheld or wrested from us by the great maritime powers.” While “havoc, famine, and delapidation” desolated Europe, “peace, plenty and prosperity” fled across the Atlantic and “set up the Ark of their Covenant in the delightful wildernesses of this modern Land of promise.”  
Excepting “some commercial vexations in 1794 and 1797,” the fortunes of the Republic seemed enhanced by a special Providence, in contrast with the “fallen fortunes of all those monarchies” from which the original settlers of America came. Advances in population, affluence, science, the arts, agriculture, and commerce distinguished the destinies of the American federation, and “without foreign or domestic wars, without taxation, without any more of the pressure of government than was absolutely necessary to keep the bands of society together, the perfection of polity was accomplished, and the visions of philanthropists realized in the … astonishing success of our free republican institutions.”  
While Americans prospered, the conflict in Europe continued, and with a short interlude in 1802, it has raged for nineteen years. “It was always evident that commerce was one main object of the contest; and that it is now the only object appears to be conceded on All sides.” Great Britain, after the failure of the successive coalitions she subsidized, was by 1806 finally “left alone to maintain the unequal conflict.” “At this conjuncture foiled, oppressed and cast down, with a devouring navy to employ a vast mass of manufactures to dispose of, jealous and apprehensive of our already well-grown greatness, and commercial competition,” the British ministry resorted to one of those desperate expedients that “always recoil with their worst re-action on their authors,” and “set the execrable example of openly violating the laws of nations, and of trampling upon the immunities of neutrality, in order … to level with surer effect the blows she was aiming at Victorious France.” “The voice of America … was instantaneously and unanimously raised against this infamous inroad on the comity and usages of Sovereign and neutral States.”  
France was “nowise slow to imitate” Great Britain’s injustice. “The conqueror of Continental Europe wrote his fiat in answer to the fiat of English defiance—and in an instant … the East and the west, the north and South were locked up in their respective precincts, and forbidden on pain of confiscation, conflagration, annihilation; to appear on the accustomed domains of all nations.” We, “the happiest people on the earth,” lived in peace, and not knowing “that negociation avails nothing with the gigantic wrong-doers … our policy was neutral.” “Our system was pacific and precautionary—We shut our own gates … to avoid the embarrassments of foreign traffic. We have negociated. When sent away without satisfaction, our ministers returned, again, and again to the inexorable audiences of domination—Sullen silence or insulting menaces were the only answers we could obtain.  
“Soon after the murder of our Countrymen in the Chesapeake was superadded to aggravate these injuries. The people rushed to arms—But a pacific administration … stayed the noble ardor of the Country.… The right of search as it is called, another of the catalogue of our wrongs, interpolations of various other indefensible claims in the code of nations, together with the rigorous enforcement of certain absurd and antiquated but revived pretensions, were also brought to bear upon our almost exhausted patience.” By way of retaliation, the other belligerent also burned and destroyed our ships and cargoes on the seas. “During these aggressions … that foul and indelible stain on the bearings of our independence, the right of impressment as it is also miscalled, has been systematically exercised … and not less than Seven thousand American citizens, have been dragged from their occupations … scourged like malefactors chained like galley slaves to the sides of British ships … and … compelled to become Denizens of that monarchy, which prohibits expatriation, and assumes to itself jurisdiction to reclaim, wherever found, the fugitives from its impressments, its taxation and its ignominious hardships of existence.  
“It would be easy … to magnify this retrospect with many other indignities and with … hedious details … But the volume is already overcharged.… We might else carry your attention from the Sea to the Land … arresting it first on the frontier, where the tomahawk of the savages is prompted to the butchery of our unconscious settlers by the infernal Stratagems of ruthless England.” In the “more civilized department of the Union” and in our cities and homes, the “mode of attack again appears adapted to the scene of its operation; and a gloting, civilised British spy is found like the Serpent in Eden, tempting our weakness with untried changes and with all the wileness of his nature beguiling us to our perdition.”  
“We have borne more than any people ever did without an appeal to arms. We have left unattempted no striving for adjustment. We … do not brandish the Sword with the right hand ’till the olive branch has withered in the left. We have deprecated long enough our unappeasable insiduous assailants.… The season for action has arrived.… And placing our highest trust in that Being, who sometimes in his inscrutable providence afflicts the just, but oftener requites their constancy, we are likewise full of confidence in the People of the United States, in the righteousness of their cause.… We call to mind … the former struggle with Great Britain,” when we persevered under much more difficult conditions, “gradually advancing to discipline organization and victory—Atcheiving at the end of seven years of toil and alternate fortune that independence we are now in our turn challenged to sustain.” We also recall “the yet more distant annals the discovery of our beloved country, when Columbus the type of the American character, in a frail bark, with a disaffected and Coward crew, bouyant on the trackless and unknown deserts of the western Ocean, braving all dangers and doubts, more terrible than dangers, still kept due onward his undaunted course, ’till these shores appeared the reward of resolution and just confidence—these shores now covered with a populous, powerful and martial Republic, whose citizens need nothing but to be resolved and justly confident in themselves, to conquer, like Columbus, and the heroes of their own revolution, the seemingly stupendous obstacles which infatuated injustice opposes to the accomplishment of their final and permanent emancipation.”  
Resolved, therefore, that the only remedy for the protracted evils afflicting the country is “a prompt vigorous and open war; with that power whose edicts blockade the entire continent of Europe; save only such parts as require our instrumentality to circulate her products, and supply her naval and military expeditions—whose fleets not only plunder our lawful commerce … but blockade our own harbors, and violate the liberty of our Citizens by the flagitious crime of impressment—whose Councils have the audacity to avow these crimes as their permanent system of maritime rights; and stimulate our Citizens to acts of fraud and violence, in order to sustain her monstrous scheme of universal monopoly, piracy, and Smuggling.” “A prompt and vigorous war! not for the limited and impoverished commerce of the moment, but for our imprescriptable rights of sovereignty, the liberty of our Citizens, and the future free circulation of the immensely accumulating surplus products, of this Free, fertile and extensive continent. These are legitimate and inevitable causes of war.  
“Resolved That the liberal and impartial conduct of the Executive of the United States, more especially in the Military and Naval appointments instead of producing a candid and generous sacrifice of prejudice and party passions, on the altar of Union, at the shrine of our country; has from a virulent faction, the fungus of party opposition, been returned with a malevolent and traitorous conspiracy to withhold and impede the national resources—discourage and obstruct the recruiting service—traduce the character and motives of the Goverment—and organize discontent, disaffection and criminal resistance.  
“Resolved That without distinction of party we respect and esteem all who are devoted to the true interest, honor and independence of our common country—who recognize the only principle upon which free government can exist; the will of the Majority constitutionally pronounced, and who are ready to obey that will with zeal and fidelity.  
“Resolved, That judging from the firm, decisive tone of the Executive message to Congress followed by Cooperative measures of preparation for the ‘armour and attitude demanded by the crisis’ … and our convictions of the immediate necessity of that awful appeal: we pledge to the constituted authorities … in the most solemn and deliberate manner … all the resources and means with which it has pleased the Almighty to endow us; to sustain to the last extremity the War … to be waged against Great Britain the most atrocious and obdurate aggressor.  
“Resolved That the thanks of this meeting be presented to those members of Congress, who have supported … the rights honor and independence of the nation and in particular to that noble phalanx the democratic delegation of Pennsylvania the key-stone of the splendid arch, whose base is the solid, and we trust immutable rock of the Union.”  
Resolved that attested copies of these proceedings be forwarded to the president of the United States, the president of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of the Pennsylvania delegation.  
Resolved that these proceedings “be published in the Democratic papers of this City” and “that 5,000 hand bills of the same be struck off, for circulation under the direction of the following committee, viz. Robert Patterson, John Binns, Charles J. Ingersoll, James Carson, John L. Leib, William Duncan, William West, Frederick Hackly, A. Hargesheimer, Robert Mc.Mullen, Jacob Holgate, T. D. Anderson, Jacob Richards and G. G. Leiper

Resolved, As the opinion of this meeting, that  
the only efficient remedy for the protracted and ag-  
gravated evils which afflict our country, will be  
found in a prompt, vigorous, open war; with that  
power whose edicts blockade the entire continent  
of Europe; save only such parts as require our in-  
strumentality to circulate her products, and supply  
her navy and military expeditions~whose fleets  
not only plunder our lawful commerce upon the  
seas, but blockade our own harbors, and violate the  
liberty of our citizens by the flagitious crime of  
impressment—whose eouncils have the audacity to  
avow these crimes as their permanent system of ma-  
ritime rights, and stimulate our citizens to acts of  
fraud and violence, in order to sustain her mon-  
strous scheme of universal monopoly, piracy, and  
smuggling.  
  
A prompt and vigorous war! not for the afflict-  
ed and impoverished commerce of the moment, but  
for our imperscriptible rights of sovereignty, the  
liberty of our citizens, and the future free circula-  
tion of our immensely accumulating surplus pro-  
ducts, of this free, fertile, and extensive continent.  
These are legitimate and inevitable cases of war.”

To their Frllam Citizen*, the Techie of the

CELLO • &#x27;CITIZENS,  
The friends of the Uni­  
ted States and of their constituted authori­  
ties, residing within the First Congressional  
District of Pennsylvania, deeply impressed  
with the solemnity of the impeuding crisis,  
trusting that their voice will not he with­  
out some effect among the American people,  
have met together for the purpose of com­  
paring and collecting the general sentiment  
in this quarter of the Republic, and submit  
the following as the deliberate, unbiassed  
and unanimous result.  
The story of American wrongs has been  
so often told, that the patriotic heart sick­  
ens at their disgusting recapitulation: Yet,  
as prefacing this last appeal and for this,  
as we most anxiously hope, the lust time, it  
may not be improper briefly to sketch an  
outline of that unparalleled, unmitigated, in­  
tolerable series of national outrages, against  
which, after too long an endurance, thennjv  
Republic extant is now at length about to  
exhibit the magnificent spectacle of an Em­  
pire of Freemen in# the nrmoor and atti­  
tude of defensive war—war for their sover­

pean wars and the British ii&#x27;euty restrict­  
ed instead of expanding the immense com­  
mercial res urces of the North American  
contirent—but with characteristic enter-&#x27;  
prize, integrity and advantage pursuing the  
br**ad high ways of emolument, and ac  
Tilling, in tranquility and forbearance,

With the exception of some commercial  
vexations in 1794 cod 1797, the form es of  
the only republic seemed to be enhanced as  
it were bv an especial Providence, to give

vering, indefatigable, invincible—gradually  
advancing to discipline, organization anil  
victory—achieving at the end of seven years  
of toil and alternate fortune, that indepen­  
dence we are now in ourturh challenged to  
  
sustain.  
We call to mind, fellow-citizens, the yc»  
more distant, annals, the discovery of our  
beloved country, when Columbus, the type  
of the American character, in a frail bark,  
with a disaffected and coward crew, buoy­  
ant on the trackless and unknown deserts of  
the western ocean, braving all dangers and  
doubts, more terrible than dangers, still  
kept due onward his undaunted course,  
till these shores appeared—the reward of  
resolution and a just confidence—these  
shores now covered with a populous, power­  
ful and martial republic, -whose cM tens  
need nothing but to be resolved and jostly  
confident in themselves, to conquer, Hke  
Columbus, and the heroes of their own re­  
volution, the Rcemingly stupendous obstacles  
which infatuated injustice opposes to the ac  
complishment of their final and permanent  
emancipation.  
Kcsotvcd, As the opinion of this meeting,  
that the only efficient remedy for the pro­  
tracted and aggravated evils which afflict  
iur country, will be found in a prompt, vigo­  
rous, open war; with that power who-** V­  
licts blockade the entire continent of Ku­  
rnpc; save only such part* as require our  
nstrumentslity to circulate her products,  
ind supply her navy and military expediti­  
ons—whose fleets not only plunder our law­  
’ul commerce upon the high seas, but block­  
ide our own harbor*, and violate the liberty  
&#x27;f our citizens by the flagitious crime of im­  
jressmcni—Whose councils have the auda­  
nty to avow these crimes as their ftrrrnu­  
irnt system of maritime rights; and .stimu­  
ate our citizens to acta of fraud and vio

These are ligitimute and inevitable causctf  
of war.  
Resolved, That the liberal and imparti­  
al conduct of the executive of the United  
States, more especially in the military and  
naval appointments ; instead of producing a  
candid and generous sacrifice i f prejudice,  
and party passions, on the altar of union, at  
tl^e shrine of our country ; has from a viru­  
lent faction, the fungus of party opposition,­  
been returned with a malevolent and traito­  
rous conspiracy to withhold and impede the:  
national resources—discourage and obstruct,  
the recruiting service—traduce the charac­  
ter and motives of the government—and or­  
ganize discontent, disaffection and criminal  
resistance.  
Resolved, That without distinction of par­  
ty, we respect and esteem all who are de­  
voted to the true interest, honor and hide­  
pendence of our common country—who re­  
cognize the only principle upon which free  
government can exist; the will of the ma­  
jority constitutionally pronounced, and who  
are ready to obey that will with zeal and fi­  
delity.

THE CITIZENS  
OF THE  
FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF  
PENNSYLVANIA.  
To their Fellow- Citizens, the People of the  
United States.  
FELLOIV CITIZENS—  
The friends of the United States and of  
‘heir constituted authorities, residing within  
the first Congressional District of Pennsyl­  
vania, deeply impressed with the solemnity  
ot the impending crisis, and trusting that  
their voice will not be without some effect  
among the American People, have met to­  
gether for the purpose of comparing and col­  
lecting the general sentiment in this quarter  
of the Republic, and submit the following as  
the deliberate, unbiassed and unanimous re­  
sult. &gt;  
The story of American wrongs has been  
so olten told, that the patriotic heart sick­  
ens at their disgusting recapitulation : Yet,  
as prefacing this last appeal, and for this,  
as wc most anxiously hope, the last time, it  
may not be improper briefly to sketch an out­  
line of that unparalleled, unmitigated, into­  
lerable series of national outrages, against j  
wh’ch, after too long an endurance, the on­  
ly republic extant is now at length about to !  
exhibit the magnificent spectacle of an em­  
pire of Freemen in the armour and attitude  
of defensive war—war for their sovereignty,  
their right&#x27;s, their blessings—war for the  
reclamation of their property, their persons  
—war for their homes and domestic altars  
—a war staved off till every possible efTort  
at reconciliation has been put to beggary &amp;  
shame—a war, to which not one distillation  
from the subtle, dnd anti-republican essen­  
ces of ambition or aggrandizement has con­  
tributed, but which will flow pure from the  
rock of self defence—a war,, without which,  
or the rights it is to be_ waged for, our sove­  
reignty is servility, our commerce a colonial  
trade, our persons exposed to pillage, our  
property to piracy, our boasted institutions  
piles of theoretical ruins, and peace itself,  
that most desirable of all political enjoy­  
ments, a contumely and a curse.  
From the tremendous concussions which  
have agitated Europe, since the eruption of  
the French Revolution, the United States  
of America wiselykept aloof in an avowed,  
impartial, unexceptionable neutrality: not,  
as those who envy us alledge, fattening our  
soil with the disasters of the belligerents_  
for European wars and British treaty res­  
tricted instead of expanding the immense  
commercial resources of the North Ameri­  
can continent—but with characteristic en­  
terprise, integrity and advantage pursuing  
the broad highways of emolument, ahd ac­  
quiring, in tranquility and forbearance,  
whatever was not withheld or wrested from  
us, by the great maritime powers. While  
kayoc, famine and dilapidation were deso­  
lating the kingdoms of Europe, peace, plen­  
ty and prosperity, driven from their abodes  
in that region, fled over the troubled Atlan­  
tic, and set up the ark of their covenant in  
the delightful wilderness of this modem  
land of promise:  
  
With the exception of some commercifl  
vexations in 1794 and 1797, the fortunes of  
the only republic seemed to be enhanced,  
as it were by an especial Providence to give  
irresistible splendor and attraction to their  
contrast with the fallen fortunes of all those  
monarchies from which the original settlers  
of this country sprang. An advancement  
in population and affluence, an improvement  
in science and the arts, in agriculture and  
commerce, an exuberance of the products  
of the earth, and an accumulation of the  
profits of the sea, transcending all example,  
all calculation, all hope, distinguished the  
destinies of the American federation ; and  
with certainly the highest allotment of the  
evils inseparable from humanity that ever  
tell to any people, without foreign or domes­  
tic wars, without taxation, without any  
more of the pressure of government than  
was absolutely necessary to keep the bands  
of society together, the perfection of polity  
was accomplished, and the visions of phi­

administration and astonishing success of our  
free, republican institutions.  
While thus situated, fellow-citizens, thus  
prospering among ourselves, the conflict in  
Europe persisted to rage with unabated vi­  
olence ; and, with a short,delusive interlude  
ef cessation in 1802, its fury for nineteen  
years has never intermitted. It was al­  
ways evident that commerce was origimlly  
one main object of the contest ; and that ft  
is now the only object, appears to be conce­  
ded on all sides.  
England, the first maritime power in the  
world!, who opened the batteries of her at  
tack with all the kingdoms of Europe for  
her allies, being uniformly defeated in the  
successive coalitions sjne subsidized, finally,  
in 180G, was left aline to maintain tlve one­

predominant Oheray. At this conjuncture,  
foiled, oppressed and cast down, with a de­  
vouring navy to employ, avast mass of ma­  
nufactures to depose of, jealous and appre­  
hensive of our already well-grown greatness  
and commercial competition, the ministry  
of Great Britain resorted to one of those  
expedients of national desperation, which  
like the dishonest contrivances rif a delin­  
quent individual, however they may serve  
the moment, and however they may injure &#x27;  
others, always recoil with their worst re­  
action on their authors. The ministry of  
Great Britain, behind the rampart of a na­  
vy deemed impregnable, set the execrable  
example of openly violating the laws of na­  
tions, and of trampling upon the immunities  
of neutrality, in order from its fragments to  
level with surer effect the blows she was  
aitniug at victorious Frauce. The voice of  
America, fellow-citizens, was instantane­  
ously and unanimously raised against this  
infamous inroad on the comity and usages of  
sovereign and neutral states. Not r. tow

THE CITIZENS

citizens, the people of the United S.atese  
  
Fellow-citizens,  
  
The friends of the United States and of thtir constituted  
authorities, residing within the first congressional district of Penn-  
sylvauia, deeply impressed with the solemnity of the impending  
crisis, and trusting that their voice will not be without some  
effect among the American people, have met together for the  
purpose of comparing and collecting the genearl sentiment in this  
quarter of the republic, and submit the following as the deliberate,  
unbdassed and unanimous result.  
  
The story of American wrongs has been so often told, that the  
patriotic heart sickens at their disgusting re-capitulation; yet, as  
prelacing this last appeal, and for this, as we most anxiously hope,  
the last time, it may not be improper bricfly to sketch an outline  
of that unparalleled, unmitigated, intolerable series of natioval  
outrages, against which, after tov long an endurance, the only re-  
public extant is now at length about to exhibit the magnificent spee  
tacle of an empire of freemen in the armor and attitude of defensive  
war—war for their sovereignty. their rights, their blessin s—war for  
the reclaination of their propért y; their persons—war for their hones  
and dumestic altars—~a war, stayed off ’tll every possible effort  
at reconciliation has heen put to beggary and shame——a war, to  
which net ove distillation from the subti’, anti-republican essences  
of ambition or aggrandizem: nt has contributed, but which will  
flow from the rock of self defence—-a war, without which o

desolating the kingdoms of Europe, peace, plenty and prosperity,  
driven from their abodes in that region, fled over the troubled At  
Jantic, and set up the ark of thir covenantin the delightful wilder-  
ness of this modern land of proinise.  
  
With the exception of some commercial vexations in 1794 and  
1797, the fortunes of the only republic seemed to be enhanced, as  
it were by an especial providence, to give irresistible splendor and  
atiraction to their contrast with the fallen fortunes of all those  
monarchies from which the original settlers of this country sprang.  
An advancement in population and affluence, an improvement i  
science and the arts, in agriculture and commerce, and an exuhe-  
rance of the products of the earth, and an accumulation of the  
profits of the sea, transcending all ex smple, all calculation, all hope,  
distinguished the destinies of the American federation ; and with  
certainly the lightest allotment of the evils inseparable from hu-  
manity that ever fell to any people. without foreign or domestic  
wars, without taxation, without any more of the pressure of go-  
Vernment than was absolutely necessary to keep the bands of socic-  
ty together, the pert+ction of polity was accomplished, and the vi-  
sions of philanthropists r-alized, in the establishment, administra-  
tion and astonishing success of our free, republican institutions.  
  
While thus situated, f-low-citizens, thus prospering among our  
selves, the conflict in Europe persisted to rage with unabated vio-  
lence ; and, with a short, ichnive piterlude of cessation in 1802,  
its fury fur nineteen years has never interiitted. It was always  
evident that commerce was originally one main objcet of the con-

THF CITIZENS  
Of tk: First Congressional District of  
PENNSYLVANIA,  
I- TO THEIK rELLOW.CITUC.V3  
THE PEOPLE Or THE U. SMTES.  
Fellow Citizens The friends of the  
U. Slates and of their constituted au-1  
thorites, residing within the First Con­  
gressional of Pennsylvania, deeply im­  
pressed wih the solemnity of the impen­  
ding crisis, and trus&#x27;ing that thtir voice  
will not be without some, effect among  
the American People, have met together  
for the purpose of comparing and col­  
lecting the general sentiment in this  
quarter of the Republic, and submit the  
following, as the deliberate, unbiassed &#x27;.  
and unanimous result.  
The story of American wrongs has  
been so often told, that the patriotic heart  
sickens at their disgusting recapitulation  
Ytt, as prefacing this last appeal, and  
for &#x27;his, as we most anxiously hope, the  
Inst time, it may not be improper briefly  
to sketch an ou line of that unparalleled,  
unmitigated, intolerable seiies of na&#x27;ion  
al outrages, against which, after too long  
an endurance, the only Repub ic extant  
is nc-w. at length, about to exhibit the  
magnificent spectacle of an Empire of  
Frtemen in the armour and attitude of  
deftnsivc war war for their sovereign­  
ty, their rights, their blessing war for  
th reclamation of their property, their  
persons w. r for their homes and do­  
mestic allr a w;r staved off till every  
possible effort at reconciliation has been  
put to beggary and shame a war, to  
which not one distillation from the sub­  
tic and anti-republican essstnees of am­  
bition or aggrjr d zemcnt has contributed  
but which will tltw pure from the rock  
of self-defence a war, without which,  
or the rights it is to be waged for, our  
sovctrignty is servility, our commerce al  
colonial trade, our persons exposed to  
pillage, our property to piracy, Our  
boasted institutions piles of theoretical  
ruins, and peace itself, that most desi­  
rable of all political enjoyments, a con­  
tumely and a curse.  
From the tremendous concussions  
which have agisted Europe, since the  
eruption of the French revolution, the  
U. States of America wisely kept aloof  
in an avowed, impartial, unexceptiona­  
ble ntu&#x27;rality not, as those who envy  
ua allcdge, fattening our soil withthe dis­  
asters of the belligerents for Euro  
pean wars, and the BritishTreaty, re  
stricted, instead of expanding, the im­  
nicnse commercial resources of the  
North-American Continent, but with  
characteristic enterprise, integrity and  
dvanlJ pursuing the broad h gh­  
y of emolument, and acquiring, in  
tranquility and forbeannce.whatcver was  
not wunhdd or wrested from u by the  
great mariti ne powers. While havoci  
famine and dilapidation, were desolating  
the Kingdoms of Europe, peace, plenty  
and prosperity, driven from their abodes  
in that legion, Bed over the troubled At­  
lanuc and set up the ark of their enre  
nam m the delightful wilderness of ibis  
modem land of promise.  
  
With the exception of some comtlter­  
cial vrxations in 1794 and im.theforj  
tunes of the only Republic seemed to be  
enhanced, as i were, by an especial Pro­  
vidence, to give irresistible splendor and  
attraction to their contrast with the fal­  
len fortunes of all those monarchies from  
which the original -settlers of this coun­  
try 6prang. An advancement in popu­  
lation and afilu&#x27; ncc, an improvement in  
science and the arts, in agriculture and  
commerce, an exuberance of the pro­  
ducts of the earth, an accumulation of  
  
the profits of the sea, transcending all  
-x mp!e all calculation, all hope oistin­  
gubhed the destinies of the American  
federa&#x27;.ion, and with certainly the lightest  
allotment of the evils inseparable from  
humsnity that ever fell to any people­  
without foreign or domestic wars, with­  
out taxation, wi hout any more of the  
pressure of government than w is abso­  
lutely necessary to keep the bands of  
society together, the perfection of policy

It would be easy, Fellow Citizens, to

more strikingly unfolded, that its images  
must be engraven on the memory of e­  
very lover of his country. We -mikjht

frontier, where the tomahawk of the sa­  
vage is prompted to the butchery of our  
unconscious settlers by the. infernal  
stratagems of ruthless England direct  
it afterwards to the more civilized depar-ment  
of the union, to our Cities, to ow

Bui it is unnecessary, we repeat, to  
dwell on the host of excitement, which  
march before and beckon us to combat.  
We have borne more than ever any

We have left unattempted no striving  
for adjustment. We have expended all  
the stores of pacifications ; and do not  
brandish the sword&#x27; with the right hand,  
till the olive branch has withered in the

more dreadful, more pernicious in their

THE CITIZENS  
  
OF THE  
First Congressional District of  
  
v PENNSYLTANIA  
To their Fellow-Citizens, the People of the U. States.  
  
FELLOW-CITIZENY,  
  
THE friends of the United States and  
of their constituted authorities, residing within  
the first Congressional District of Pennsylva­  
nia, deeply impressed with the solemnity of  
the impending crisis, and trusting that their  
voice will not be without some etfcct among  
the American people, have met together for  
the purpose of comparing and collecting the  
general sentiment in this quarter of the Re­  
public, and submit the [ollowing as the delib­  
crate, unbiassed and unanimous result.  
  
The story of American wrongs has been  
$o often told, that the patriotic heart sickens  
at their disgusting recapitulation : Yet, as  
prefacing this last appealy, and for this, as we  
most anxiously hope, the last time, it may  
not be improper briefly to sketch an outline  
ol that unparralieled, unmitigated, intolera­  
ble series of patlonal outrages, against which,  
after tou long an endurance, the only Repub­  
il extant is new at length about to exhibi  
the magmiicent spectacle ol defensive war­

hlessings—-war for the reclamation of fheis  
property, their persons——war for their b mes  
nd their domestic altarsea war stoyed off

which not one distillation from the subtile and

grandiscment has contributed, but which will

curee.,  
  
&#x27;rom the tremendous concussions which  
have agitated Euvope, since the eruption of  
the I&#x27;rench revolution, the United States of  
America will wisely heep alool in an avowed,  
impartial, unexceptionable neutrality ; not,as  
those who envy us allege, fattening our soil  
with the disasters of the belligerenis—for  
European wars and the British treaty restricts  
ed instead of expanding the immence coms­  
metcial resources of the North American  
continént-=hut with characteristic enterprise,  
integrity and advantage, pursuing the broad  
highways of ewolument, and acquiring, in  
tranguility and lorbearance, whatever was not  
withheld or wrested trom us, by the great  
muritinde powers. While havoe, famine and  
dilapidation were desolating the Kingdoms of  
Furope, peace, plenty and prosperity, driven  
from their übodes in that région, fled over  
troubled Atlantic, and set up the ark of their  
covenant in the delightful wilderness of this  
modern tand ol promise.  
\With the exception of some commercial  
vexations in 1794 and 1797, the fortunes of  
the only Republic seemed to be enbanced, as  
it were by an &amp;special Providence, to give ir­  
resistible splendor and attraction, to their con­  
trast with the fallen fortunes of all these mo­  
rarchies from which the original settlers of  
this conntry sprang. An advancement in  
population and aflluence, an improvement in  
the sciences and the arts, in agriculture and  
commerce, an exyberance of the products of  
the earth, and an accumulation of the pro­  
fits of the sea, transcending all example, all  
caleulation, all hope, distinguished the desti­  
nies of the American federation ; and with  
certainly the lightest allotment of the €vils  
inseparable from humanity that ever fell on  
any people, without foreign or domestic wars,  
without taxationy; without any more of the  
pressure of government than was absolutely  
necessary to keep the bands of society togeth­  
ery the perfection of polity was accomplished,  
and the visions of philanthiropists realised, in  
the establishment, administratien and aston­  
ishing success of our free Republican institu­  
tiops.  
  
While thas situated, fellow-citlzensﬁ thus  
prospering among ourselves, the con ict in  
Europe persisted to rage with unabated vio­  
  
lence ; and, with 2 short delusive interlude of  
cessation in 1812, its fury for nineteen years  
has neverintermitted. 1t was always evident,  
that commerce was originally ene msin object  
of the contest ; and that it is now the only cb­  
ject appears to be conceded on all sides.  
England, the first maritime power in the  
world, who opened the batteries of her attack  
with all the kingdoms of Europe for her al­  
lies, being uniformally defeated in the suc­  
cessive coalitions she subsidised, finally, in  
1806, was left alone to maintain the unequal  
conflict against all her former auxiliaries

{y this retrospect with many other indignities,

the narative, which has been so often so much  
more strikingly unfolded, that its images must  
be engraven on the memory of every lover of  
his country. We might else carry vour atten­  
tion {rom the sea to the land 3 and arresting  
it first on the frontier, where the tomabawk  
of the savage is prompted to the butchery of  
  
our uncor.scious setilers by the infernal slrat­

on the host of excitement which march be­

pended all the stores of pacifications ; and do  
not brandish the sword with the right hand,  
till the olive bronch has withered in the left.  
We have deprecated long encugh our unap­  
peasable insidious assailants, more dreadfu), &#x27;  
more pernicious in their ambush, than they  
could be in flagrant war. We have been  
more piundered of our treasure, while suing

our boalted inflituiions piles of theo  
retical ruins, and peace itfeif, that  
moit defjrable of all political erjoy  
ments; a contumely and a curse  
From the tremendous concuflions  
which have agitated Europe, since  
the eruption of the French revolution,  
the United States of America wifely  
kept aloofin an avowed impartial,  
usexceptionzable necutrality : ont, as

suing the broad highways ot emolu­  
ment, and acquiring, in tranquility &#x27;  
and forbearance, whatever was not  
withheld or wreft=d from u. by the

voc, famine and dilapidaticn were  
desolating the kingdoms of Europe,  
peace, plenty and proiperity, driven  
from their abodes in that region,  
fled over the troubled Atluntic,  
and set up the ark of their coven  
ant in the delightful wildernefles of  
this modern land of promifz. =  
With the exceptron of some com.

the fortunes of the only repunlic
