Sir  
  
  
before 24 Nov. 1806  
  
  
In the want of insult or aggression made on our Government and country from any quarter, I am so well  
convinced that the publick sentiment and feeling of the citizens within this State, and particularly within my Division,  
are such, of such a nature and of such a kind, that I take the liberty of tendering their services, that is, under my  
command,—and at one moments warning after your signification that this tender is acceptable, my orders shall be given  
conformably—  
I beg leave to offer to your view the enclosed order some short time ago Issued by me; since which time I  
have not been furnished with complete returns of the Volunteer companies; but from the information I possess, I have no  
doubt that three regiments of volunteers (to be commanded by their own officers and such as may be recommended by their  
Genl) can be brought into the field and ready to march in twenty days from the receipt of orders.  
Accept assurances of my high consideration and respect—  
  
Andrew Jackson— M. G. 2 Division

it is asserted in the National Journal of the 17th ol  
July, that he left Nashville on the 6th of October.  
The time between these two dates, was no doubr  
occupied in making all the necessary arrangements  
between Burr and Jackson. Within this time some  
things were transacted, which wear the appearance  
of singular coincidences, to say the least.
