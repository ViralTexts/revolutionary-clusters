The denunciation of the democratic societies is one of the extraordinary acts of boldness of which we have seen so many from the faction of Monocrats. It is wonderful indeed that the President should have permitted himself to be the organ of such an attack on the freedom of discussion, the freedom of writing, printing and publishing. It must be a matter of rare curiosity to get at the modifications of these rights proposed by them, and to see what line their ingenuity would draw between democratical societies, whose avowed object is the nourishment of the r

n inexcusable aggression.—And with respect to the transactions against the excise-law, it appears to me that you are all swept away in the torrent of governmental opinions, or that we do not know what these transactions have been. We know of none which according to the definitions of the law, have been any thing more than riotous. There was indeed a meeting to consult about a separation. But to consult on a question does not amount to a determination of that question in the affirmative, still less to the acting on such a determination: but we shall see I suppose what the court lawyers, and courtly judges and would-be Ambassadors will make of it.—The excise-law is an infernal one. The first error was to admit it by the constitution. The 2d. to act on that admission. The 3d. and last will be to make it the instrument of dismembering the Union, and setting us all afloat to chuse which part of it we will adhere to. The information of our militia returned from the Westward is uniform, that tho the people there let them pass quietly, they were objects of their laughter, not of their fear, that 100 men could have cut off their whole force in a thousand places of the Alleganey, that their detestation of the excise law is universal, and has now associated to it a detestation of the government, and that separation which perhaps was a very distant and problematical event, is now near, and certain and determined in the mind of every man. I expected to have seen some justification of arming one part of the society against another, of declaring a civil war the moment before the meeting of that body which has the sole right of declaring war, of being so patient of the kicks and scoffs of our enemies, and rising at a feather against our friends, of adding a million to the public debt and deriding us with recommendations to pay it if we can, &amp;c &amp;c. But the part of the speech which was to be taken as a justification of the armament reminded me of parson Saunders’s demonstration why minus into minus makes plus. After a parcel of shreds of stuff from Aesop’s fables and Tom Thumb, he jumps all at once into his Ergo, minus multiplied into minus makes plus.

of the new national government. Other measures, particularly  
the funding scheme, the bank and, later, the policy of protection,  
made large classes and powerful interests the permanent allies  
of the national government, and therefore depressed correspond-  
ingly the importance of the states. In all this the government  
gained, but Hamilton lost. The people were benefited by the  
discipline, but they did not like the man who administered it.  
The feeling of the masses may be gathered from the wrathful  
words of Jefferson, their truest representative. December 28,  
1794, he wrote Madison :  
  
The excise law is an infernal one. The first error was to admit it  
by the constitution ; the second, to act on the admission ; the third and  
last will be to make it the instrument of dismembering the Union and  
setting us all afloat to choose what part of it we will adhere to. The  
information of the militia, returned from the Westward, is uniform, that  
though the people there let them pass quietly, they were objects of their  
laughter, not of their fear; that a thousand men could have cut off  
their whole force in a thousand places in the Alleghany ; that the detes-  
tation of the excise law is universal, and has now associated with it

theory, as appears when he says: “I
