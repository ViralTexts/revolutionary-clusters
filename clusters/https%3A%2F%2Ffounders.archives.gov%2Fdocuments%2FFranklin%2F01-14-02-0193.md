There are many people that would be thought, and even think themselves honest men, who fail nevertheless in particular points of honesty, deviating from that character sometimes by the prevalence of mode or custom, and sometimes through mere inattention; so that their honesty is partial only, and not general or universal. Thus one who would scorn to over-reach you in a bargain, shall make no scruple of tricking you a little now and then at cards. Another, that plays with the utmost fairness, shall with great freedom cheat you in the sale of a horse. But there is no kind of dishonesty into which otherwise good people more easily and frequently fall, than that of defrauding government of its revenues, by smuggling when they have an opportunity, or encouraging smugglers by buying their goods.  
I fell into these reflections the other day, on hearing two gentlemen of reputation discoursing about a small estate, which one of them was inclined to sell, and the other to buy; when the seller, in recommending the place, remarked, that its situation was very advantageous on this account, that being on the seacoast, in a smuggling country, one had frequent opportunities of buying many of the expensive articles used in a family, such as tea, coffee, chocolate, brandy, wines, cambricks, Brussels laces, French silks, and all kinds of India goods, 20, 30, and in some articles 50 per cent cheaper than they could be had in the more interior parts, of traders that paid duty. The other honest Gentleman allowed this to be an advantage, but insisted that the seller, in the advanced price he demanded on that account, rated the advantage much above its value. And neither of them seemed to think dealing with Smugglers a practice that an honest man (provided he got his goods cheaper) had the least reason to be ashamed of.  
At a time when the load of our public debt and the heavy expence of maintaining our fleets and armies to be ready for our defence on occasion, makes it necessary not only to continue old taxes but often to look out for new ones perhaps it may not be unuseful to state this matter in a light that few seem to have considered it in.  
The people of Great Britain under the happy constitution of this country, have a privilege few other Countries enjoy, that of chusing the third branch of the legislature, which branch has alone the power of regulating their taxes. Now whenever the government finds it necessary for the common benefit, advantage and safety of the nation, for the security of our liberties, property, religion, and every thing that is dear to us, that certain sums shall be yearly raised by taxes, duties, &amp;c. and paid into the publick treasury, thence to be dispensed by government for those purposes, ought not every honest man freely and willingly to pay his just proportion of this necessary expence? Can he possibly preserve a right to that character, if by any fraud, stratagem, or contrivance, he avoids that payment in whole or in part.  
What should we think of a companion, who having sup’d with his friends at a tavern, and partaken equally of the joys of the evening with the rest of us, would nevertheless contrive by some artifice to shift his share of the reckoning upon others, in order to go off scot-free? If a man who practis’d this would when detected, be deem’d and called a scoundrel; what ought he to be called, who can enjoy all the inestimable benefits of publick society, and yet by smuggling or dealing with smugglers, contrive to evade paying his just share of the expence, as settled by his own Representatives in Parliament, and wrongfully throw it upon his honester and perhaps much poorer neighbours? He will perhaps be ready to tell me, that he does not wrong his neighbours, he scorns the imputation; he only cheats the King a little, who is very able to bear it. This however is a mistake. The publick treasure is the treasure of the nation, to be apply’d for national purposes. And when a duty is laid for a particular publick and necessary purpose, if through smuggling that duty falls short of raising the sum required, and other duties must therefore be laid to make up the deficiency, all the additional sum laid by the new duties, and paid by other people, though it should amount to no more than a halfpenny or a farthing per head, is so much actually picked out of the pockets of those other people by the smugglers and their abettors and encourages. Are they then any better or other than pickpockets? And what mean, low, rascally pickpockets must those be that can pick pockets for half pence and for farthings?  
I would not however be suppos’d to allow in what I have just said, that cheating the King is a less offence against honesty, than cheating the Publick. The King and the Publick in this case are different names for the same thing. But if we consider the King distinctly, it will not lessen the crime. It is no justification of a robbery that the person robbed was rich and able to bear it. The King has as much right to justice as the meanest of his subjects. And as He is truly the common father of his people, those that rob him fall under the scripture woe, pronounced against the son, that robbeth his father, and saith it is no sin.  
Mean as this practice is, do we not daily see people of character and fortune engaged in it for trifling advantages to themselves? Is any Lady ashamed to request of a Gentleman of her acquaintance, that when he returns from abroad, he would smuggle her home a piece of silk or lace from France or Flanders? Is any Gentleman ashamed to undertake and execute the commission? Not in the least. They will talk of it freely, even before others whose pockets they are thus contriving to pick by this piece of knavery!  
  
Among other branches of the revenue, that of the Post-Office is by a late law, appropriated to the discharge of our publick debt, and to defray the expences of the State. None but members of parliament and a few publick officers have now a right to avoid by a frank, the payment of postage. Whenever any letter not written by them or on their business, is franked by any of them, ’tis a hurt to the revenue; an injury which they must now take the pains to conceal by writing the whole superscription themselves. And yet such is our insensibility to justice in this particular, that nothing is more common than to see, even in reputable company, a very honest Gentleman or Lady declare his or her Intention to cheat the nation of threepence by a frank, and without blushing apply to one of the very Legislators themselves, with a modest request that he would please to become an accomplice in the crime, and assist in the perpetration of it.  
There are those who by these practices take a great deal in a year out of the publick purse, and put the money into their own private pockets. If passing through a room where publick treasure is deposited, a man takes the opportunity of clandestinely pocketing and carrying off a guinea, is he not truly and properly a thief? And if another evades paying into the Treasury a guinea that he ought to pay in, and applies it to his own use, when he knows it belongs to the publick as much as that which has been paid in, what difference is there in the nature of the crime, or the baseness of committing it?  
Some laws make the receiving of stolen goods equally penal with stealing, and upon this principle, that if there were no receivers there would be few thieves. Our proverb too says truly, that the receiver is as bad as the thief. By the same reasoning, as there would be few smugglers, if there were none who knowingly encouraged them by buying their goods, we may say that the encouragers of smuggling are as bad as the smugglers; and that as smugglers are a kind of thieves, both equally deserve the punishments of thievery.  
In this view of wronging the revenue, what must we think of those who can evade paying for their wheels and their plate, in defiance of law and justice, and yet declaim against corruption and peculation, as if their own hands and hearts were pure and unsullied? The Americans offend us grievously, when, contrary to our laws, they smuggle goods into their own country: and yet they had no hand in making those laws. I do not however pretend from thence to justify them. But I think the offence much greater in those who either directly or indirectly have been concerned in making the very laws they break. And when I hear them exclaiming against the Americans, and for every little infringement of the arts of trade, or obstruction given by a petty mob to an officer of our customs in that country, calling for vengeance against the whole people as Rebels and Traitors, I cannot help thinking there are still those in the world who can see a mote in their brother’s eye, while they do not discern a beam in their own; and that the old saying is as true now as ever it was, one man may better steal a horse, than another look over the hedge.

HERE are many people that  
  
would be thought, and even

But there is no kind of dithonelty,  
into which good people more eafily  
and frequently fall, than that of de-  
frauding government of its revenues  
by fmuggling, when they have an op-  
yortunity, or encouraging tinugyglers  
by buying their goods.  
  
i fell into thefe reflex ons the other  
éay, on hearing two gentlemen of re-  
puiation difcourfing about a {mall  
ellate, which one of them was in-  
clined to fell, and the other to buy ;  
when the feiler, in recommending  
the place, remarked, that us fitya-  
tion was very advantageous on this  
account, that being on the fea-coalt  
ina finuggling country, one had fre-  
quent opportuniues of buying many  
of the expenfive articles ufed in a fa-  
mily, (fuch as tea, coilee, chocolare,  
brandy, wines, cambrieks, Brullels  
laces, French filks, and all kinds of  
India goods,) twenty, thirty, and in  
fome articles fifiy per cent. cheaper  
than they could be had, in the more  
interior parts, of traders that paid  
duiy. The other honelt gentleman  
allowed this to be an advantage,  
but infiited that the feller, in the ad-  
vanced price he demanded on that  
account, rated the advantage much  
above us value, And neither of  
them feemed to think dealing with  
fmugglers, a pratitce that an honelt

the government finds it neceflary for

of our liberties, property, religron,

that certain fums fhall be yearly raifed

will perhaps be ready to tell me, that  
Re does not wrong his neighbours ; he  
{corns the imputation ; he only cheats  
the kinga littl, who is véry well  
able to bear it. This, however, tsa  
miftake, The public treafure is the  
treafure of the nation, to be applied  
to national purpofes. And when a du-  
ty is laid for a particular public and ne-  
ceffary purpofe, if through {muggling,  
that duty falls fhort of railing the fum  
required, and other duties mutt there-  
fore be laid to make up the deficien-  
cy ; all the additional {um laid by the  
new duties and paid by other people,  
though it fhould amount to no more  
than a halfpenny or a farthing per  
head, is fo much attually picked out  
of the pockets of thofe other people,

it is no juftification of a robbery, tha

tration ?  
  
There are thofe, who, by thefe  
practices, take a great dealin a year  
out of the public purfe, and put the mo-  
ney into their own private pockets. If  
  
alfing through a room where pub-  
fe treafure is depofited, a man takes  
the opportunity of clandeitinely pock-  
eting and carrying off a guinea, 1s he  
not truly and properly a thief? And  
if another evades paying into the trea-  
{ury a guinea he ought to pay in, and  
applies 1t to his own ufe, when he  
kuows it belongs tothe public as much  
as that which has been paid in 3 what  
dilterence is there in the nature of the  
crime, or the bafenet{s of committing it ?  
  
Some laws make the receiving of  
ftolen goods equally penal with fteal-  
ing, and, upon this principle, if there  
were no receivers there would be few  
theves, Our proverb, too, fays truly,  
‘that the receiveris as bad as the  
thief.’ By the fame reafoning, as  
there would be few {mugglers, if there  
were none who knowingly encouraged  
them by buying their goods, we may  
fay that the encouragers of {mugghng  
are as bad as the finugglers ; and that  
as {mugglers are a kind of thieves, both  
equally deferve the punifhment of  
thievery.  
  
In this view of wronging the re-  
yenuc, what mult we think of thofe  
who can evade paying for their wheels  
and their plate, in defiance of law and  
jullice, and yet declaim againit cor-  
rupuon and peculation, as if sheir  
own hands and hearts were pure and  
unfullied ? Fhe Americans offend us  
grievoufly, when, contrary to our  
laws, they {muggle goods into their  
own country: and yet they had no  
hand in making thofe laws. I do not,  
however, pretend from thence to juf-  
tify them. But I think the offence  
much greater in thofe who either di-  
rectly or indireéily have been concern-  
ed in making the very laws they breals.  
And when I hear them exclaiming  
againit the Americans, and for every  
lutle infringement of the atts of trade,  
or obftruttion given by a petiy mob  
to an officer of our cufloms in that  
country, calling for vengeance againtt

&#x27;The_people of Great Britain, under the  
happy constitution of this country, have a  
privilege few other countries enjoy, that of  
chusing the third branch of the legislature,  
which branch has alone the power of regulat­  
ing their taxes. Now whenever the govern­  
ment finds it necessary for the convnon ben­  
efit, advantage, and safety of the nation, for  
the seeviity g? otr Tisérties;property;retigion:  
and every thing that is dear to us, that certain  
sums shall be yearly raised by taxes, duties,  
&amp;e. and paid into the public treasury, thence  
to be dispensed by government for _those  
purposes ; ought not every honest man freely  
and willingly to-pay his just proportion of this  
necessary expence ! Can he possibly pre­  
serve a right to that character, if, by fraud,  
stratagem, or contrivance, he avoids that pay- 1  
ment i whole or in part.  
What should we think of a companion, |  
who, having supped with his friends at a tav­  
ern, and partaken equally of the joys of the  
evening with the rest of us, would neverthe­  
less contrive by some artifice to shift his share  
iof the reckoning upon others, in order to go  
off scot-free ? le aman who practised this,  
}would when detected, be deemed and called  
a scoundrel, what ought he to be called, who  
‘can enjoy all the inestimable benefits of pub­  
lic society, and yet by smuggling, or dealing  
‘with smugglers, contrive to evade paying his  
just share of the expence, as settled by his  
own representatives in parliament ; and  
‘wrongfully throw it upon his honester and  
perhaps much poorer neighbors ? He will  
perhaps be ready to téll me, that he does not  
wrong his neighbors ; he scorns the imputa­  
tion ; he only cheats the king a_little, who is  
very üble to bear it. This however is a mis­  
take. The public treasure is the treasure of  
the nation, to be applied to national purposes.  
And when a duty 1s laid for a-particular pub­  
lic and necessary purpose, if, through smug­  
gling, that duty falls short of raising the sum  
required, and other duties must therefore  
be lail to make up the deficency, all the ad­  
dition.! sum laid by the new duties and paid  
by other people, though it should amount to  
no nyore than a half a penny ora fm‘thmg per  
head, is so much actually picked out of the  
pockets of those other peo({ﬂe by the smug­  
glers and their abettors and encouragers. Are  
t&quot;hbg&#x27; then any better or other than pick-pock­  
ets? and what mean, low, raseally pick-pock­  
ets must those be, that cnn?wk . pockets. for  
halfpence and for farthings 7. SR  
I would not however be suppesed to allow  
in what I have just said, that cheating the  
king is a «~ks§qli)meg,&quot;a§alnat, ‘honesty, than  
cheating the public.” The king and the pub-

msensib rticular, that  
nothing is’ #Common than to see, even in  
‘areputable compauny, a very honest gentle­  
man or lady declare his or ilner intention to  
cheat the nation&#x27; of three-pence by a frank,  
and without blushing apply to one of the very  
legislators thernselves, with a modest request,  
that he would be pleased to become an ac­  
complice in the crime, and assist in the per­  
petration.  
There are those who by these practices  
take a great deal in a year out of the public  
purse, and put the money into their own pri­  
vate pockets, If, passing through a room  
where public treasure is deposited, a man  
takes the opportunity of clandestinely pocket­  
ing and carrying off a guinea, is he not truly  
and properly a thief ? ~ And if another évades  
paying into the treasury a guinea he ought  
to pay in, and applies it to his own use, when  
he knows it belongs to the public as much as  
that which has been paid in, what difference  
is there in the nature of the crime, or the base  
ness of committing it ?  
  
THE WEDDED LIFE.  
Imay perhaps startle you Essa, by saying  
that the {ll)rst year of a young woman’s wedded  
life is generally the most unhappy, and the  
‘most trying one she experiences. However  
intently we may have studied the character of  
our affianced, however well we may imagine  
we know it in all its narrow winding, still we  
shall find when we become wives that we  
have yet something to learn. By actions is  
the affection: on either side shown, and al­  
though it is in the power and nature of a wo­  
man to manifest her devotedness and tender-‘  
ness by a thousand little attentions, she m
