ecision or determination in the notice—It was given in the first Conference on the 8th of August, immediately after their statement of the points upon which they were authorised to negotiate, and the demands of their Government. It was recorded in the Protocol of Conference of that day, which was published in the United States, and which Mr Lloyd had certainly seen—It was in these words—&quot;that the British Government did not intend to grant to the United States gratuitously the privileges formerly granted by Treaty to them, of fishing within the limits of the British Sovereignty and of using the Shores of the British Territories for purposes connected with the Fisheries.&quot;

Great Britain and the United States, the British  
plenipotentiaries reaffirmed the foregoing principle  
as to the dissolving of treaties. In volume 9, page  
321, of the American State Papers, it will be seen  
that our ministers, in acommunication to the then  
Secretary of State, say that the British minister  
stated to them “that before they desired any answer  
‘from us, they felt it incumbent upon them to de-  
* clare that the British Government did not deny

‘ of fishing within the limits of the British juris-

seen that, by their own rule, the war between Great  
Britain and Spain, in 1796, totally annulled this
