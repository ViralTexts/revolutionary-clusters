I wrote you last on the 12th. of Octob. since which I have received yours of Aug. 29. with the papers and pamphlets accompanying it. I inclose you now the copy of a letter from Mr. Pintard our Consul at Madeira, exhibiting another attempt at the practice on which I wrote to you in my last, made by Capt.

I hope you will be able to make the British ministry sensible of the necessity of punishing the past and preventing the future.
