r Benjamin Franklin” makes clear, the poet-turned-medical student was an eager audience for any personal anecdotes or moral tales that his mentor might relate. We suspect that he felt inspired in the same way as Georgiana Shipley, who reminisced about her relationship with Franklin when she received her copy of this bagatelle. Reading “La Belle et la Mauvaise Jambe,” she told him, reminded her of “those happy hours we once past in your society when we were never amused without learning some usefull truth, &amp; where I first acquired a taste pour la conversation badinante et reflechie.”  
  
I.  
[before November 23, 1780]  
There are two Sorts of People in the World, who with equal Degrees of Health &amp; Wealth and the other Comforts of Life, become, the one happy, the other unhappy. This arises very much from the different Views in which they consider Things, Persons and Events; and the Effect of those different Views upon their own Minds.  
In whatever Situation Men can be plac’d, they may find Conveniencies and Inconveniencies: In whatever Company, they may find Persons &amp; Conversations more or less pleasing: At whatever Table they may meet with Meats and Drinks of better and worse Taste, Dishes better and worse dress’d: In whatever Climate they will find good and bad Weather: Under whatever Government, they may find good and bad Laws, and good and bad Administration of those Laws: In every Poem or Work of Genius, they may see Faults and Beauties: In almost every Face &amp; every Person, they may discover fine Features and Defects, good &amp; bad Qualities. Under these Circumstances, the two Sorts of People above-mention’d fix their Attention, those who are to be happy, on the Conveniencies of Things the pleasant Parts of Conversation, the well-dress’d &amp; well-tasted Dishes, the Goodness of the Wines, the Fine Weather, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and enjoy all with Chearfulness. Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the contraries. Hence they are continually discontented themselves, and by their Remarks sour the Pleasures of Society, offend personally many People, and make themselves every where disagreeable.  
If this Turn of Mind was founded in Nature, such unhappy Persons would be the more to be pitied. But as the Disposition to criticise and be disgusted is perhaps taken up originally by Imitation, and unawares grown into a Habit, which tho’ at present strong, may nevertheless be cured, when those who have it are convinc’d of its bad Effects on their Felicity, I hope this little Admonition may be of Service to them, and put them on changing a Habit, which tho’ in the Exercise is chiefly an Act of Imagination, yet it has serious Consequences in Life, as it brings on real Griefs and Misfortunes. For, as many are offended by, and nobody well loves this sort of People, no one shows them more than the most common Civility &amp; Respect, and scarcely that; and this frequently puts them out of humour, and draws them into Disputes and Contentions. If they aim at obtaining some Advantage in Rank or Fortune, nobody wishes them Success, or will stir a Step, or speak a Word to favour their Pretensions. If they incur public Censure or Disgrace, no one will defend or excuse, and many join to aggravate their Misconduct, and render them compleatly odious.  
If these People will not change this bad Habit, and condescend to be pleas’d with what is pleasing, without fretting themselves and others about the Contraries, it is good for others to avoid an Acquaintance with them, which is always disagreeable, and sometimes very inconvenient, particularly when one finds one’s self entangled in their Quarrels. An old philosophical Friend of mine was grown from Experience very cautious in this particular and carefully shun’d any Intimacy with such People. He had, like other Philosophers, a Thermometer to show the Heat of the Weather, &amp; a Barometer to mark when it was likely to prove good or bad; but there being no Instrument yet invented to discover at first Sight this unpleasing Disposition in a Person, he for that purpose made use of his Legs; one of which was remarkably handsome, the other by some Accident crooked and deform’d. If a Stranger at the first Interview, regarded his ugly Leg more than his handsome one, he doubted him. If he spoke of it, and took no Notice of the handsome Leg, that was sufficient to determine my Philosopher to have no farther Acquaintance with him.  
Everybody has not this two-legged Instrument, but everyone with a little Attention may observe Signs of that carping fault-finding Disposition, and take the same Resolution of avoiding the Acquaintance of those infected with it.  
I therefore advise these critical, querulous, discontented unhappy People, that if they wish to be loved &amp; respected by others and happy in themselves, they should leave off looking at the ugly Leg.

T ple in the world, who, with

from the different views in which  
they confider things, perfons, and

In whatever fituation men can

ever company, they may find per-  
fons and converfations more or lefs  
pleafing : at whatfoever table; they  
may meet with meats and drinks of

and worfe dreffled. In whatever cli-  
  
mate, they will find good ‘and bad  
weather: under whatever govern-  
ment, they may find good and bad  
  
laws, and good and bad adminiftra-  
tion of thofe laws. In every poem,  
(or work of genius) they may fee  
faults and beauties. In almoft every  
face, and every perfon, they may  
difcover fine features and defeéts,  
good and bad qualities.  
  
Under thefe circumftances, the  
two forts of people above-mentioned  
fix their “attention, thofe who are  
difpofed to be happy, on the conve-  
hiencies of things, the pleafant parts  
of converfation, the well-dreffed  
dihes, the goodnefs of the wines,

J? all with chearfulnefs. Thofe

are continually difcontented  
themfelves ; and, by their remarks,  
four the pleafures of fociety, offend  
onall y. many people, and make  
  
elves every where cifacrceable.  
  
If this turn of mind was founded  
in nature, fuch unhappy perfons  
would be the more to be pitied.  
But as the difpofition to criticife  
and be difguiled, is perhaps taken  
up originally by imitation, and is  
unawares grown into a habit, which,  
though at prefent ftrong, may ne-  
verthelefs be cured, when thofe who  
have it, are convinced of its bad  
effects on their felicity, I hope this  
little admonition may be of fervice  
to them,—and put them on chang-  
ing a habit, which, though in the  
exercife it 1s chiefly an a¢t of ima-  
gination, -yet has ferious confequen-  
ces in life, as it brings on real griefs  
and misfortunes. For as many are  
offended by, and nobody loves, this  
fort of people, no one fhews them  
more than the moft common civility  
and refpe&amp;t, and fearcely that; and  
this frequently puts them out of  
humour, and draws them into dif-  
putes and contentions. If they aim  
at obtaining fome advantage in rank  
or fortune, nobody wifhes them  
fuccefs, or will ftir a ftep, or fpeak  
a word to favour their pretenficns.  
If they incur public cenfure or dif-  
grace, no one will defend or excufe,  
and many join to aggravate their  
mifcondu&amp;t, and render them com-  
pletely odious. If thefe people will  
not change this bad habit, and con-  
defeend to be pleafed with what is  
pleafing, without fretting themfelves  
and others about the contraries, it  
is good for others to avoid an ac-  
quaintance with them, which is al-  
ways difagreeable, and fometimes  
very inconvenient, efpecially when  
one finds himfelf entanzled in their

There are two soils of people in the  
world, who, with equal degrees of health  
and wealth, and the other comforts of life,  
become the one happy and the other mis­  
erable. This arises very much from the  
different views in which they consider  
things, persons aud events, and the effect  
of those different views upon their own  
minds.  
In whatcvei situation men eau be placed,  
they may find conveniences and inconven­  
iences ; in whatever company they mav  
find persons aud conversation more or less  
pleasing; at whatever table, they may  
meet with meats and drinks of better and  
of worse taste, dishes better and worse  
dressed; in whatever climate they Will  
find good and bad weather; under what­  
ever government, they will find good and  
bad laws and bad administration of  
these laws; in whatever poem, or work of  
genius, they may seo faults and beauties  
in almost every face and in every person,  
they may discover tine features aud de­  
fects, good and bad qualities.  
Under these circumstances, the too sorts  
of people above mentioned, fix their at­  
tention, those who are disposed to be hap­  
py, on the convenience of things, the  
pleasant parts of conversation, the will  
dressed dishes, the goodness of the wine*,  
the fine weather, Jite., and enjoy all with  
cheertulness. Those who are to be un­  
happy, think and speak only of the Con­  
traries. Hence they are continually din- v  
contented themselves, and by their re­  
marks, sour the pleasures of society; ol­  
fend personally many people and make  
themselves everywhere disagreeable. If  
this turn of mind was founded on nature,  
such unhappy persons would bo the more  
to be pitied&quot;. l!ut as the disposition to  
criticise, and to be disgusted is perhaps,  
taken up originally by invitation, and is,  
unawares grown into a habit, which,  
though at present strong, may neverthe­  
less, bo cured, when those who have it,  
are convinced of its bad effects on their  
felicity. I hope this little admonition  
may be ol service to them and put  
them on ehauging a habit, which, though  
in tho .exercise&quot;it is chiefly an act of  
imagination, yet lias serious conse­  
quences in life, as it brings on real griefs  
and misfortunes. For as many are offend­  
ed by, and nobody loves this sort of peo­  
ple ; no one shows them more than the  
most common civility and respect, and  
hardly that; and this frequently puts them  
out ot humor and draws them Into dis­  
putes ami contentions. If they aim at ob­  
taining some advantage in rank or fortnne,  
nobody wishes them success, or will stir a  
step, or speak a word to favor their pre­  
tentious.  
11 they incur public censure or disgrace  
no one will defend or excuse, and many  
join to aggravate their misconduct, and  
render them completely odious. If these  
people will not change this bad habit, and  
condescend to be pleased with what is  
pleasing, without fretting themselves and  
others about their contraries, it is good  
lor others to avoid an acquaintance with  
them; which is alwavs disagreeable, and  
sometimes vety&quot; inconvenient, especially  
when one finds one&#x27;s self entangled ill  
their quarrels. An old philosopical friend  
! was grown from experiences, very cautious  
I in this respect or particular, and careful­  
ly avoided any intimacy with such people  
He had like other philosophers, a ther­  
mometer to show him the heat of weather,  
and a barometer, to mark when it was  
good or bad: but there being no instru­  
ment invented to discover at first sight,  
this unpleasing disposition in a person, he.  
for that purpose, made use ot his legs; one  
ot which was rt nmrknbly handsome, the  
other by some accident ctooked.and de­  
formed. If a stranger, at the first inter­  
view regarded his ugly leg. more titan his  
handsome one. he doubted hint. If he  
-poke of it rind took no notice of the bard­  
.iiiiiu leg, that was sufficient to determine  
my philosopher to have no further acquain­  
tance with him.  
Everybody has not this two legged in­  
strument ; iiut eve ry one with a little at­  
tention, may observe signs of that .carping,  
fault-finding disposition, aud take the  
same resolution ol avoiding any acquain­  
tance of those infected with it. I there­  
fore advise those critical, querlous, dis­  
contented, unhappy people, that if they  
wish to be respected and beloved by others  
and happy in themselves, they should  
leave oft looking at the ugly leg.&#x27;’

Franklin’s amusing tale of the “ Hand¬
