In a General Convention.  
Begun and holden at the Capitol, in the City of Williamsburg, on Monday the sixth day of May, one thousand seven hundred and seventy six, and continued, by adjournments to theday of June following:  
a constitution, or form of government,  
agreed to and resolved upon by the Delegates and Representatives of the several Counties and Corporations of Virginia.  
Whereas George the Third, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Elector of Hanover, heretofore intrusted with the exercise of the Kingly Office in this Government, hath endeavoured to pervert the same into a detestable and insupportable Tyranny; by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome and necessary for the publick good;  
by denying his Governours permission to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation for his assent, and, when so suspended, neglecting to attend to them for many Years; by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons to be benefited by them would relinquish the inestimable right of representation in the legislature;  by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly and continually, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions of the rights of the people;  
when dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system without any legislative head;  
by endeavouring to prevent the population of our Country, and, for that purpose, obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners;  
by keeping among us, in times of peace, standing Armies and Ships of War;  
by affecting to render the Military independent of, and superiour to, the civil power;  
by combining with others to subject us to a foreign Jurisdiction, giving his assent to their pretended Acts of Legislation;  
for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;  
for cutting off our Trade with all parts of the World;  
for imposing Taxes on us without our Consent;  
for depriving us of the Benefits of Trial by Jury;  
for transporting us beyond Seas, to be tried for pretended Offences;for suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever;  
by plundering our Seas, ravaging our Coasts, burning our Towns, and destroying the lives of our People;  
by inciting insurrections of our fellow Subjects, with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation;  
by prompting our Negroes to rise in Arms among us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he hath refused us permission to exclude by Law;  
by endeavouring to bring on the inhabitants of our Frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of Warfare is an undistinguished Destruction of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions of Existance;  
by transporting, at this time, a large Army of foreign Mercenaries, to compleat the Works of Death, desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized Nation;  
by answering our repeated Petitions for Redress with a Repetition of Injuries;  
and finally, by abandoning the Helm of Government, and declaring us out of his Allegiance and Protection;  
  
vii. text as adopted  
By which several Acts of Misrule, the Government of this Country, as formerly exercised under the Crown of Great Britain, is totally dissolved; We therefore, the Delegates and Representatives of the good People of Virginia, having maturely considered the Premises, and viewing with great concern the deplorable condition to which this once happy Country must be reduced, unless some regular adequate Mode of civil Polity is speedily adopted, and in Compliance with a Recommendation of the General Congress, do ordain and declare the future Form of Government of Virginia to be as followeth:  
The legislative, executive, and judiciary departments, shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the Powers properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time, except that the Justices of the County Courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly.  
The legislative shall be formed of two distinct branches, who, together, shall be a complete Legislature. They shall meet once, or oftener, every Year, and shall be called the General Assembly of Virginia.  
One of these shall be called the House of Delegates, and consist of two Representatives to be chosen for each County, and for the District of West Augusta, annually, of such Men as actually reside in and are freeholders of the same, or duly qualified according to Law, and also of one Delegate or Representative to be chosen annually for the city of Williamsburg, and one for the Borough of Norfolk, and a Representative for each of such other Cities and Boroughs, as many hereafter be allowed particular Representation by the legislature; but when any City or Borough shall so decrease as that the number of persons having right of Suffrage therein shall have been for the space of seven Years successively less than half the number of Voters in some one County in Virginia, such City or Borough thenceforward shall cease to send a Delegate or Representative to the Assembly.  
The other shall be called the Senate, and consist of twenty four Members, of whom thirteen shall constitute a House to proceed on Business for whose election the different Counties shall be divided into twenty four districts, and each County of the respective District, at the time of the election of its Delegates, shall vote for one Senator, who is actually a resident and freeholder within the District, or duly qualified according to Law, and is upwards of twenty five Years of Age; And the sheriff of each County, within five days at farthest after the last County election in the District, shall meet  at some convenient place, and from the Poll so taken in their respective Counties return as a Senator to the House of Senators the Man who shall have the greatest number of Votes in the whole District. To keep up this Assembly by rotation, the Districts shall be equally divided into four Classes, and numbered by Lot. At the end of one Year after the General Election, the six Members elected by the first division shall be displaced, and the vacancies thereby occasioned supplied from such Class or division, by new Election, in the manner aforesaid. This Rotation shall be applied to each division, according to its number, and continued in due order annually.  
The right of Suffrage in the Election of Members for both Houses shall remain as exercised at present, and each House shall choose its own Speaker, appoint its own Officers, settle its own rules of proceding, and direct Writs of Election for supplying intermediate vacancies.  
All Laws shall originate in the House of Delegates, to be approved or rejected by the Senate or to be amended with the Consent of the House of Delegates; except Money Bills, which in no instance shall be altered by the Senate but wholly approved or rejected  
A Governour, or chief Magistrate, shall be chosen annually, by joint Ballot of both Houses, (to be taken in each House respectively, deposited in the Conference room, the Boxes examined jointly by a Committee of each House, and the numbers severally reported to them, that the appointments may be entered, which shall be the mode of taking the joint Ballot of both Houses in all Cases) who shall not continue in that office longer than three Years successively, nor be eligible until the expiration of four Years after he shall have been out of that office: An adequate, but moderate Salary, shall be settled on him during his Continuance in Office; and he shall, with the advice of a Council of State, exercise the Executive powers of Government according to the laws of this Commonwealth; and shall not, under any pretence, exercise any power or prerogative by virtue of any Law, statute, or Custom, of England; But he shall, with the advice of the Council of State, have the power of granting reprieves or pardons, except where the prosecution shall have been carried on by the House of Delegates, or the Law shall otherwise particularly direct; in which Cases, no reprieve or Pardon shall be granted but by resolve of the House of Delegates.  
Either House of the General Assembly may adjourn themselves respectively: The Governour shall not prorogue or adjourn the Assembly during their setting, nor dissolve them at any Time; but he  shall, if necessary, either by advice of the Council of State, or on application of a Majority of the House of Delegates, call them before the time to which they shall stand prorogued or adjourned.  
A Privy Council, or Council of State, consisting of eight Members, shall be chosen by joint Ballot of both Houses of Assembly, either from their own Members or the People at large, to assist in the Administration of Government. They shall annually choose out of their own Members, a President, who, in case of the death, inability, or necessary absence of the Governour from the Government, shall act as lieutenant Governour. Four Members shall be sufficient to act, and their Advice and proceedings shall be entered of Record, and signed by the Members present (to any part whereof any Member may enter his dissent) to be laid before the General Assembly, when called for by them. This Council may appoint their own Clerk, who shall have a Salary settled by Law, and take an Oath of Secrecy in such matters as he shall be directed by the Board to conceal. A sum of Money appropriated to that purpose shall be divided annually among the Members, in proportion to their attendance; and they shall be incapable, during their continuance in Office, of sitting in either House of Assembly. Two Members shall be removed, by joint Ballot of both houses of Assembly at the end of every three Years, and be ineligible for the three next years. These Vacancies, as well as those occasioned by death or incapacity, shall be supplied by new Elections, in the same manner.  
The Delegates for Virginia to the Continental Congress shall be chosen annually, or superseded in the mean time by joint Ballot of both Houses of Assembly.  
The present Militia Officers shall be continued, and Vacancies supplied by appointment of the Governour, with the advice of the privy Council, or recommendations from the respective County Courts; but the Governour and Council shall have a power of suspending any Officer, and ordering a Court-Martial on Complaint for misbehaviour or inability, or to supply Vacancies of Officers happening when in actual Service. The Governour may embody the Militia, with the advice of the privy Council; and, when embodied, shall alone have the direction of the Militia under the laws of the Country.  
The two Houses of Assembly shall, by joint Ballot, appoint judges of the supreme Court of Appeals, and General Court, Judges in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, Secretary, and the Attorney-General, to be commissioned by the Governour, and continue in Office during good behaviour. In case of death, incapacity, or resignation,  the Governour, with the advice of the privy Council, shall appoint Persons to succeed in Office, to be approved or displaced by both Houses. These Officers shall have fixed and adequate Salaries, and, together with all others holding lucrative Offices, and all Ministers of the Gospel of every Denomination, be incapable of being elected Members of either House of Assembly, or the privy Council.  
The Governour, with the Advice of the privy Council, shall appoint Justices of the Peace for the Counties; and in case of Vacancies, or a necessity of increasing the number hereafter, such appointments to be made upon the recommendation of the respective County Courts. The present acting Secretary in Virginia, and Clerks of all the County Courts, shall continue in Office. In case of Vacancies, either by death, incapacity, or resignation, a Secretary shall be appointed as before directed, and the Clerks by the respective Courts. The present and future Clerks shall hold their Offices during good behaviour, to be judged of and determined in the General Court. The Sheriffs and Coroners shall be nominated by the respective Courts, approved by the Governour with the advice of the privy Council, and commissioned by the Governour. The Justices shall appoint Constables, and all fees of the aforesaid Officers be regulated by law.  
The Governour, when he is out of Office, and others offending against the State, either by Mai-administration, Corruption, or other Means, by which the safety of the State may be endangered, shall be impeachable by the House of Delegates. Such impeachment to be prosecuted by the Attorney General, or such other Person or Persons as the House may appoint in the General Court, according to the laws of the Land. If found guilty, he or they shall be either for ever disabled to hold any Office under Government, or removed from such Office Pro tempore, or subjected to such Pains or Penalties as the laws shall direct.  
If all, or any of the Judges of the General Court, should, on good grounds (to be judged of by the House of Delegates) be accused of any of the Crimes or Offences before-mentioned, such House of Delegates may, in like manner, impeach the Judge or Judges so accused, to be prosecuted in the Court of Appeals; and he or they, if found guilty, shall be punished in the same manner as is prescribed in the preceding Clause.  
Commissions and Grants shall run, In the Name of the Common Wealth of Virginia, and bear teste by the Governour, with the Seal of the Common wealth annexed. Writs shall run in the same manner, and bear teste by the Clerks of the several Courts. Indictments  shall conclude, Against the Peace and Dignity of the Common-Wealth.  
A Treasurer shall be appointed annually, by joint Ballot of both Houses.  
All escheats, penalties, and forfeitures, heretofore going to the King, shall go to the Common Wealth, save only such, as the Legislature may abolish, or otherwise provide for.  
The territories contained within the Charters erecting the Colonies of Maryland, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, are hereby ceded, released, and forever confirmed to the People of those Colonies respectively, with all the rights of property, jurisdiction, and Government, and all other rights whatsoever which might at any time heretofore have been claimed by Virginia, except the free Navigation and use of the Rivers Potowmack and Pohomoke, with the property of the Virginia Shores or strands bordering on either of the said Rivers, and all improvements which have been or shall be made thereon. The western and northern extent of Virginia shall in all other respects stand as fixed by the Charter of King James the first, in the Year one thousand six hundred and nine, and by the publick Treaty of Peace between the Courts of Great Britain and France in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty three; Unless by act of this legislature, one or more Territories shall hereafter be laid off, and Governments established Westward of the Allegheny Mountains. And no purchases of Land shall be made of the Indian Natives but on behalf of the Publick, by authority of the General Assembly.  
In order to introduce this Government, the Representatives of the People met in Convention shall choose a Governour and privy Council, also such other Officers directed to be chosen by both Houses as may be judged necessary to be immediately appointed.

HEREAS George the Third,  
  
King of Great-Britain and Ire-  
land, and Eleétor of Hanover, hereto-

by putting his negative on laws the moft  
wholefome and necefiary for the public  
good :  
  
By denying his governors permiffion  
to pals laws of immediate and prefling  
importance, unlefs fufpended in their  
operation for his aflent, and, when fo  
fufpended, negledting to attend tothem  
for many years:  
  
By refuling to pafs certain other laws,  
unleis the perfons to be benefited by  
them would relinguifh the ineftimable  
right of reprcfentation in the legiflature :  
  
By diflolving legiflative aflemblies re-  
peatedly and continually, for oppofing  
with manly firmnefs his invafiens of the  
rights of the people :  
  
When diffolved, by refufing to call  
others for a long fpace of time, thereby  
jeaving the political fyftem without any  
legiflative head :  
  
By endeavouring to prevent the popu-  
  
ELLIGENCE. 333  
  
lation of our country, and, for that pur-  
pofe, obitructing the laws for the natu-  
ralization of foreigners :  
  
By keeping among us, in times of  
peace, ftanding armies and ships of war:  
  
By afteéting to render the military in-  
dependent of, and fuperior to, thé civil  
power :  
  
By combining with others to fubject us  
to a foreiga jurifdidtion, giving his aflent

jocver :  
  
‘By plundering our feas, ravaging our  
coafts, burning our towns, and deftroy-  
ing the lives of our people:  
  
By inciting infurreétions of our fellow-  
fubjeéts, with the allurements of for-  
feiture and confifcation :  
  
By prompting our negroes to rife ia  
arms among us, thofe very negroes  
whom, by an inhuman ufe of bis nega-  
tive, he hath refufed us permiflion to  
exclude by law:  
  
-By endeavouring to bring on the in-  
habitants of our frontiers the mercilefs  
Indian favages, whofe known rule of  
warfare is an undiftinguifhed deftru€tion  
of all ages, fexcs and conditions of ex-  
iitence :  
  
By tranfporting, at this time, a large  
army of foreign mercenaries, to com-  
plete the works of death, defolation and  
tyranny, already begun with circum-  
{tances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy  
the head of a civilized nation:

this once happy countiy muft be re-  
duced, unlefs fome regular adequate  
mode of civil polity is fpeedily adopted,  
and in compliance with a recommenda-  
tion of the genera! Congrefs, do ordain  
and declare the future form of govern-  
ment of Virginia to be as followeth:  
  
The legiflative, executive, and judi-  
ciary departments, thal] be feparate and  
difting, fo that neither exercife the  
powers properly belonging to the other ;  
nor fhall any perfon exercife the powers  
of more than one of them at the fame  
time, except that the juftices of the  
county courts thall be eligible to either  
houfe of aflembly.  
  
The legiflative thall be formed of two  
diftinét branches, who, together, thall  
be a complete legiflature. They fhall  
meet once, or oftener, every year, and  
fhall be called the General Aflembly of  
Virginia.  
  
One of thefe fhall be called the Houfe  
of Delegates, and confift of two repre-  
fentatives to be chofen for each county,  
and for the diftrict of Weft-Augufta, an-  
nually, of fuch men as aétually refide in

Worfohk, anda reprefentative for each  
of&#x27;fuch other cities and boroughs as may  
hereafter be allowed particular reprefen-  
tation by the legiflature ; but when any  
city or borongh fhall fo decreafe, as that  
the number of perfons having right of  
fuffrage therein fhall have been for the  
fpace of feven years fucceffively lefs than  
half the number of voters in fome one  
county in Virginia, fuch city or borough

The other fhall be called the Senate,  
and confift of twenty four members, of  
whom thirteen fhall conftitute a houfe to  
proceed on bufinefs, for whofe eleétion  
the different counties fhali be divided

of the election of its delegates, thall yote  
for one fenator, who is actually a refi-  
dent and frechoider within the diftria,  
or duly qualified according to law, and  
is upwards of twenty-five years of age;  
and the theriffs of each county, within

whole diftri&amp;. To keep up this aflembly  
by rotation, the diftriéts thall be equally  
divided into four claffes, and numbered  
by lot. At the end of one year after  
the general eleétion, the fix members  
ele€&amp;ted by the firft divifion thall be dif-

The right of faffrage in the election of  
members for both houfes fhall remain as  
exercifed at prefent, and each houfe hhall  
choofe its own fpeaker, appoint its own  
officers, fettle its own rules of proceed-  
img, and direét writs of eleétion for fup-  
plying intermediate vacancies. i  
  
All laws thall originate in the houfe  
of delegates, to be approved or rejected  
by the fenate, or to be amended with the  
confent of the houfe of delegates; ex-  
cept money-bills, which “in no inftance  
fhall be altered by the fenate, but  
wholly approved or rejected.  
  
A governor, or chief magiftrate, fhall  
be chofen annually, by joint ballot of  
both houfes, to be taken in each houfe  
refpectively, depofited in the conference  
room, the boxes examined jointly bya

vice of the council of ftate, have the  
  
power of granting reprieves or pardons,  
  
except where the profecution fhall have  
  
been carried on by the houfe of dele-  
  
gates, or the law hall otherwife parti-  
  
cularly dire€&amp;t; in which cafes, no re-  
  
prieve or pardon fhall be granted but by  
  
refolve of the houfe of delegates.  
  
Rither houfe of the general aflembly

The delegates for Virginia to the con-

together, fha!l be a complete le-  
giflature. ‘Mhey hall meet once,  
or oftener, every year, and {thall

kingly office in the Government of Virginia, had on­  
ijhavoured to pervert the same into a detestable and  
Insupportable tyranny, by putting his negative on

the inestimable tight of representation in the Legisla­

and continually, for opposing with manly firmness  
his invasions of the rights qr the people; when dis­  
solved, by refusing to oaU others fur a long space of

legislative head; by endeavouring to prevent the pop­

ing tho laws for the naturalization of foreigners; by

sent, for depriving us of the benefits of the trial by ju­  
ry, for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for  
pretended offences, for suspending our own Legisla­

to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever; by plunder­  
ing our seas, Ravaging our coasts, buruing our tovvns.

ments of forfeiture and coufiscation; by prompting  
our negroes to rise in arras among us, those very ne

he had refused ju permission to exclude by law;  
by endeavouring to bring on the inhabitants of  
our frontiers, the merciless indian savages, whose

fore that time entrusted with the oxerciso of the  
kingly office in the government of Virginia,  
had endeavoured to prevert the haiiio into a

his governors permission to pass laws of imme­

suspended neglecting to attend to them for ma­  
ny years ; by refusing to pass certain other laws,

would relinquish the inestimable right of repre­

gislative assemblies repeatedly and continually,  
for opposing with inauly firmness his invasions

refusing to call others for a long space of time,

AN AMENDED CONSTITUTION  
OR  
Form of Government for Virginia.  
[Adopted January l4th, 1830 ]  
Whereas the Delegates and Representatives of the  
good people of Virginia, in Convention assembled, on  
the twenty-ninth day of June in the year of our Lord  
one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six: recking  
and declaring, tlmt whereas, George tho third, King  
of Groa- llritainand Ireland,«nd Llcctor of Hanover,  
before that time entrusted with the exercise of the  
kingly office in tho Government of Virginia, had en­  
deavoured to pervert the same into a detestable and  
insupportable tyranny, by putting lus negative on  
laws the most wholesome and necessary fur the pub­  
lic good; by denying his Governors permission to pass  
laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless  
suspended in their operation for his ussent, and when  
so suspended neglecting to attend to them for many  
years; by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless  
the persons to be benefited by them would relinquish  
the inestimable right of representation in the Legisla­  
ture; by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly  
and continually, for opposing with manly firmness  
Jt*s invasions of the rights of the people; when dis­  
solved, by refusing to call o’hers for a long space of  
time, thereby leaving the political system without any  
legislative head; by cndeavonring to prevent the pop­  
ulation of our country, and for thut purpose obstruct­  
ing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners; by  
keeping among us, in time of peace, standing armies  
and ships of war; by affecting to render the military  
independent of and superiour to the civil power; by  
combining with others to subject us to a foreign juris­  
diction, giving Lis assent to their pictcndcd act9 of  
legislation, for quartering large bodies of armed troops  
among ns, for cutting off our trade with all parts of  
the v/oild, for imposing taxes on us without our con­  
sent, for depriving us of the benefits of the trial byju­  
ry, for transporting us beyond seas to bo tried&quot; for  
pretended offences, for suspending our own Legisla­  
tures and declaring themselves invested with power  
to legislate for its in all cases whatsoever; by plunder­  
ing our sc as, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns,  
and destroying tho lives of our people; by inciting in  
surrections of our fellow subjects with the allure­  
ments of forfeiture und confiscation; by prompting  
our negroes to rise in arms among us, those very ne­  
groes, whom by an inhuman use of hi» negative  
ho had refused ns permission to exclude by law;  
by endeavouring to bring oil the inhabitants of  
our frontiers, tho merciless imJian savages, whose

truction of all Hgcs, sexes nnd conditions of exist­  
ence; by transporting hither n large army of for­

laws the most wholesome and necessary for the pub­

laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless  
suspended in their operation for his assent, and when  
so suspended neglecting to attend to them for many  
years; by refusing to pass certain other laws, unless  
the persous to be benefited by them would relinquish  
the inestimable right of representation in the Legisla­  
ture; by dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly  
and continually, for opposing with tnanly firmness  
Ins invasions of the rights of the people; when dis­  
solved, by refusing to call others fur a long spuce of  
time, thereby leaving the political system without any  
legislative head; by endeavouring to prevent the pop­  
ulation of our country, and for that purpose obstruct­  
ing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners; by  
keeping umongu3, in time of peace, standing armies  
andshipsof war; by affecting to render the military  
independent of and superiour to the civil power; by  
combining with others to subject us to a foreign juris­  
diction, giving his absent to their pictcndeu acts of  
legislation, for quartering large bodies ofarmed troops  
among us, fur cutting off our trade with all parts of  
the woild, for imposing taxes on us without our con­  
sent, for depriving us of the benefits of the trial by ju­  
ry, for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for  
pretended offences, for suspending our own Legisla­  
tures and declaring thnmseives invested with power  
to legislate for up in all esses whatsoever; by plunder­  
ing our seas, ravaging our coasts.burning our towns,  
anti destroying the lives of our people; by inciting in  
surrcctions of our fellow subjects with the allure­  
ments of forfeiture and confiscation; by prompting  
our negroes to rise in arms among us, those very nc  
groes, whom by an inhuman use of hi» negative  
  
iic nau rciuseu us permission to exclude by law;  
| by endeavouring to bring on the inhabitants o»  
our frontiers, the merciless indiau savages, whose  
j known rule of warfare is an undistinguished des­  
truction of ull ages, sexes nnd conditions of exist­  
ence; by transporting hither a largo army of for­  
I cign mercenaries, to complete the work of death, des­  
olation and tyranny, then already begun with circum­

t a civilized nation; by answering our repeated peti­

finally, by abandoning the helm of government, and  
declaring us outot his allegiance and protection: by

in which she fixes her boundaries, she says, what  
they are and shall be, “unless by act of Legisla-

Gieat Britain and Ireland, and Elector of Hanover,  
beio&#x27;e that time entrusted with the exercise of the king­  
ly oflice in the Government of Virginia, had endeavor­  
ed to pervert the same into a detestable and insupport­  
able tyranny, by putting hi* negative on laws the most  
wholesome and necessary fur the public good; by de­  
nying his governors permission to pass laws of immedi­

our negroes to rise in arms among us, those very  
negroes, whom by on inhuman use of his negative he  
had refused us permission to exclude by law; by en­  
deavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our bonders  
the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of  
warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages,

a large army of foreign mercenaries, to complete the  
i work ot death, desolation and tyranny, then already  
begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy un­  
worthy the head of a civilized nation; by answering  
our repeated petitions for redress with a repetition ol

ting his negative on laws the most wholesome and  
necessary for the public good; by denying his gov­  
ernors permission to pass laws of immediate and  
pressing importance, unless suspended in their ope­  
ration for his assent, and when so suspended neg­  
lecting to attend to them for many years; by refu­  
sing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons

ing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners; by­  
keeping among us, in time of peace, standing ar­

military independent of and superior to the civil  
power; by comhining with others to subject us to a  
foreign jurisdiction, giving his assent to their pre­  
tended acts of legislation, for quartering large bo­

trade with all parts of the world, for imposing taxes  
on us without our consent, for depriving us of the

bly right that it so -resulted.  
The difficulty to remove a Judge was this :—  
the offence charged to have been committed, as  
well as the evidence to establish it, had to be  
submitted to the House of Delegates for its de­  
cision, whether the charge was proper, and the  
evidence sufficient to sustain it. If these ques­  
tions were decided in the affirmative, the House  
might impeach the Judge so accused, to be pros­  
ecuted in the Court of Appeals; and &quot;if found  
guilty, he was to be forever disabled to hold of­  
fice under Government, or removed from such  
office pro tempore, or subjected to such pains or  
penalties as the law should direct&quot; according to  
the judgment of that Court. Here it will be  
perceived that there were three penalties pre­  
scribed to the conviction of a Judge, whatever  
may have been his offence. By the first he was  
removed from office forever; by the secaud, only  
removed pro tempore, or suspended from his of­  
fice for a time; aud by the third, no removal at  
all, but merely &quot;subjected to pains or penalties,&quot;

CONSTITUTION.  
1. Whereas the delegates and representatives  
of the good people of Virginia, in Convention as­  
sembled, on the twenty-ninth day of June, in the  
year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred  
sud seventy-six—reciting and declaring, that  
whereas, George the Third, King of Great Brit­  
ain and Ireland, and Elector of Hanover, before  
that fims entrusted with the exercise of tho king­  
ly office in the Government of Virginia, had en­  
deavored to pervert tho same into a detestable  
and insupportable tyranny, by putting his nega­  
tive on laws tho most wholesome and necessary  
for the public good; by denying his Governors  
permission to pass laws of immediate and press­  
ing importance, unless suspended in their opera­  
tion for his assent, and when so suspended, neg­  
lecting to attend to them for many years; by  
refusing to pass certain other law 3, unless the  
persons to be benefitted by them would relinquish  
the inestimable right of representation Id the  
Legislature ; by dissolving legislative assemblies  
repeatedly and continually ; for opposing, with  
manly firmness his invasion cf the rights of the  
people ; when dissolved, by refusing to call oth­  
ers for a long space of time, thereby leaving the  
political system without any legislative head ; by  
endeavoring to prevent the population of our  
country, and for that purpose obstructing the  
law.; for the naturalization of foreigners; by  
keeping among us, in time of peace, standing ar­  
mies and ships of war ; by affecting to render the  
military independent of, and superior to. the  
civil power, by combining with others to subject  
us to a foreign jurisdiction, giving his assent to  
their pretended acts of legislation; for quarter­  
ing large bodies of armed troops among us, for  
cutting off our trade with ali parts of the world,  
for imposing taxes on us without our consent,  
for depriving us of the benefits of the trial by ju­  
ry, for transporting us beyond the seas to be  
tried for pretended offence*, for suspending our  
own Legislatures, aad declaring themselves in­  
vested with power to legislate for us in all ca­  
tws whatsoever; by plundering our seas, rava­  
ging our coasts, burning our towns ao4 destroy­  
ing the lives of our people ; by inciting insurrec­  
tions of our fellow-subjects with the allurements  
of forfeiture and confiscation; by prompting  
our negroes, to rise in arms among us, those  
very negroes whom, by&quot; an inhuman use of his  
negative, he had refused us permission to ex­  
clude by law ; by endeavoring to bring on the  
inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless In­  
dian savages, whose ki.own rules of warfare is  
an undistinguished destruction of ail ages, sexes  
and conditions of existence; by transporting  
hither a large army of foreign mercenaries to  
complete the work of death, desolation, andtyr  
army, then already begun, with oiroumstancos ol  
cruelty and perfidy unworthy tke be*d at a $ii4l­  
  
ized nation; by answering our repeated petitions  
for redress with a repetition of injuries; and,  
finally, by abandoning the helm of Government  
and declaring us out of his allegiance and protec­  
tion ; by which several acts of misrule, the Gov­  
ernment of this country, as before exercised  
under the crown of Great Britain, was totally  
dissolved—did, therefore, having maturely con­  
sidered the premises, and viewing with great  
concern the doplorable condition to which this  
once happy country would be reduced, unless  
some rogular adequate mode of civil policy should  
4)e speedily adopted and ia compliance with the  
recommendation of the general Congress, ordain  
and declare a form of government of Virginia.

CoNSTITUTION oF VIRGINIA.  
Whereas the delegates and representatives  
of the good people of Virginia, in Convention  
assembled on the 29th day of June in the year  
of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and  
seventy-six, reciting and declaring that where­  
as George the Third, King of Great Britain  
and Ireland, and elector of Hanover, before  
that time entrusted with the exercise of the  
kingly office in the Government of Virginia,  
had eadeavored to perwvert the same into a de  
testable and insupportable tyranny by putting  
his negative on laws the most wholesome and  
necessary for the public good; by denying his  
governors permission to pass laws of  
ate and pressing importance unless suspended  
in their operation for his assent; and when so  
suspended, neglecting to attend to them for  
many years; by refusing to pass certain other  
laves uinlear the persons to be benefited by  
them would relinquish the inestimable right  
of representation in the Legislature; by  
dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly  
and continually for opposing with manly  
firmness his invasions of the rights of the peoe­  
ple; when dissolved, by refusing to call others  
for a long space of time, thereby leaving the  
political system without any legislative head;  
by endeavoring to prevent the population of  
our country, and for that purpose obstructing  
the laws for the naturalization of foreigners;  
by keeping among us, in time of peace, stand-­  
ing armies and ships of war; by affecting to  
render the military independent of and sue­  
perior to the civil power; by combining with  
others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction,  
giving his assent to their pretended acts of  
egislation, for quartering large bodies of arme­  
I troops among us, for cutting off our trade  
ith all parts of the world, for imposing taxes  
n us without our consent, for depriving us of  
he beneflts of the trial by jury, for transport-­  
ng us beyond seas to be tried for pretended  
ffences, for suspending our own legislatures,  
and declaring themselves invested with power  
o legistlate for us in all cases whatever; by  
plundering our seas, ravaging our coasts,  
ourning our towns, and destroying the lives  
of our people; by inciting insurrections of our  
ellow-subjects with the allurements of forfeit-.  
are and confiscation; by prompting our negroes  
to rise in arms among us- those very negroes  
whom, by an inhuman use of his negatlve, he  
ad refused us permission to exclude by law;  
y endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of  
our frontiers the merciless Idian savages,  
whose known rule of warfare is an undistin-­  
lished destruction of all savages, sexes, and  
onditions of existence; by transporting  
ither a large army of foreign mercenarles to  
omplete the work of death, desolation, and  
ranny, then already begun with circum-­

ead of a clvilised nation; by answering our  
peated petitions for redress with a repeti­

he helin of Government and declaring us out
