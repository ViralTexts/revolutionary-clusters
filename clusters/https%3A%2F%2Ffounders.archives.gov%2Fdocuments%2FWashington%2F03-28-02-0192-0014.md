Sir  
New York Octr 1st 1780  
  
The Polite attention shown by Your Excellency and the Gentlemen of Your Family to Mrs Arnold when in distress, demand my grateful acknowledgement and thanks which I beg leave to present.  
From Your Excellencys Letter to Sr Henery Clinton, I find a Board of General Officers have given it as their Opinion that Major André comes under the description of a Spy: my good Opinion of the Candor, and Justice of these Gentlemen leads me to believe that If they had been more fully acquainted with every Curcumstance respecting Major André, that they would by no means have considered Him in the light of a Spy, or even of a Prisoner: In Justice to him I think it my Duty to declare that He came From on board the Vulture at my Particular request, by a Flag sent on purpose for him, by Joshua Smith Esqr. Who had permission to go to Dobbs’s Ferry to Carry Letters, and For other purposes not mentioned and to return; This was Done as a blind to the Spy Boats: Mr Smith at the Same time had my possitive directions to go on board the Vulture, and bring on Shore, Colonel Robinson or Mr John Anderson, which was the Name I had requested Major André to Assume: At the Same time I desired Mr Smith to Inform him, That He should have my Protection, and a safe Passport to return in the same Boat as soon as our business was compleated; as several accidents intervened to prevent his being sent on Board, I gave him my Passport to return by land, Major André came on Shore in his Uniform (without Disguise) which with much Reluctance at my particular and pressing Instance He Exchanged for another Coat, I furnished Him with a Horse and Saddle and pointed out the Route by which He was to return, And as Commanding Officer in the Department I had an undoubted right  to transact all these Matters, which If wrong Major André ought by no Means to suffer for them.  
But if after this Just and Candid Representation of Major Andre’s Case The Board of General Officers Adhere to their former Opinion, I shall suppose it Dictated by Passion and Resentment, and If that Gentleman Should Suffer the Severity of their Sentence, I shall think myself bound by every tie of Duty and honor to retaliate on such unhappy Persons of Your Army as may fall within my power, that the Respect due to Flags and to the Law of Nations may be better understood, and Observed.  
I have further to observe that Forty of the Principle Inhabitants of South Carolina, have Justly forfeited their Lives, which have hitherto been Spared by the Clemency of His Excellency Sir Henery Clinton, Who Cannot in Justice extend his Mercy to them any longer, if Major André Suffers, which in all probibility will open a Scene of blood at which Humanity will Revolt.  
Suffer me to Intreat Your Excellency For Your Own and the honor of Humanity, and the Love You have of Justice, that You suffer not an Unjust Sentence to touch the Life of Major André.  
But If this warning should be disreguarded and He should suffer, I call Heaven and Earth to Witness that Your Excellency will be Justly answerable for the torrent of blood that may be spilt in Consequence. I have the honor to be with due Respect Your Excellencys most Obedient and Very Humble Servt  
  
B. Arnold

Sir, New-York, Oct. 15° 17806  
  
THE polite attention thewn by your Ex-  
cellency and the Gentlemen of your family  
to Mrs. Arnold, when in dittrefs, demand  
iy grateful acknowledgement and thanks,  
which I beg leave to pretent.  
  
From your Excellency’s letter to Sir Heme  
Clinton, I tind a Board of General Officers  
have given it as their opinion, that Major  
Andre comes under the defeription of a fpy 5  
my good opinion of the candour and juftice  
of thofe Gentlemen leads me to be!.cve, that,  
if they had-been made fully acquainted with  
every circumflance refpeéting Major Andre,  
they would by no means have confider-  
ed him in the light of a fpy, or even of a  
prifoner. In juftice to him, I think -t my  
duty to declare, that he came from on board  
the Vulture at my particular requeft, by a  
flag fent on purpofe for him by Jothua  
Sm th, Efq; who had permiffion to go to  
Dobb’s Ferry to carry letters, and for other  
purpofes not mentioned, and to return, This  
was done as a blind to the fpy-buais. Mr.  
  
ia Smith,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
616 Proceedings on the Trial of Major Andre,  
  
Smith, at the fame time, had my private diree-  
tions to goon board the Vulture, and bring  
.on fhore Col. Robinfon, or Mr. John Ander-  
fon, which was the name I had requefted  
Majer Andre to affume ; at the fame time I  
defired Mr. Smith to inform him, that he  
thould have my protection, and a fafe paff-  
.port to return in the fame boat, as foon as  
_our bufinefs was compleated. As feveral ac-  
cidents intervened to prevent his keing fent  
,on board, I gave him my paffport to return  
by land. Major Andre came on fhore in his  
uniform (without difguife), which, with  
much reluétance, at my particular and pref-  
fing inftance, he exchanged for another coat.  
I furnifhed him with a horfe and faddle,  
.and pointed out the reute by which he was  
o return. And as Commanding Officer in  
the department, I had an undoubted right ta  
tranfaét all thefe matters, which, if wrong,  
Major Andre ought by no means to fuffer  
for them.  
  
But if, after this juft and candid reprefen-  
tation of Major Andre’s cafe, the Board of  
General Officers adhere to their former opi-  
nion, FE fhall fuppofe it diftated by pafiion  
and refentment; and if that Gentleman  
fhould fuffer the feverity of their fentence, I  
fhall think myfelf bound, by every tie of  
duty and henour, to retaliate on fuch un-  
happy perfons of your army as may fall  
within my power, that the refpeét due to  
flags, and to the law of nations, may be  
better underfiood and obferved.  
  
I have farther to obferve, that forty of  
the principal inhabitants »f South Caro)ina  
have juftly forfeited their lives, which have  
hitherto been fpared by the clemency of his  
Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, who eannot  
3n juftice extend his mercy to them any lon-  
ger, if Major Andre fuffers; which, in all  
probability, will open a fcene of blood at  
which humanity will revolt.  
  
Suffer me to intreat your Excellency, for  
your own, andthe honour of humanity, and  
the love you have of juitice, that you fuffer  
not an unjuft fentence to touch the life of  
Major Andre.  
  
But if this warning fhould be difregarded,  
and he fuffer, I call Heaven and Earth to  
witnefs, that your Excellency will be juftly  
anfwerable for the torrent of blood that may  
be fpilt in confequence.

THE polite attention fthewn by your

From your Excelleney’s letter to Sir

In juftice to him, I think it my duty to  
declare, that he came from on board the

Mr. Smith at the fame time had my pri-  
vate dire&amp;tions to go on board the Vul-

fon, or Mr. John Anderfon, which was  
the name I had requefted Major Andié

T H E polite argeation shewn by yopr Excellency  
uhd the Gentiemes of your family, to Mrs. Arxold,  
when in distress, demsad my grateful sckwowledg­  
ment and shasks, whick I beg leave to present:  
From your Excellcacy’s letter to SirHenryClinton,  
I find 2 Board of General Officers have given it as  
their opinion, thas Major Andre comes under the des­  
cription of a spy : My good opinion of the candor  
and juttice of those Geatlemen leads me (o believe,  
thst if they had bead made fully acquainten with every  
&quot;eircamftance respecting Major Andre, that they wolld  
by nc means have considered him in the light of 2  
spy. or even of a prifonsr. In justice to him, I think  
&quot;§t my duty to deciare, that he came f.om on board the  
Valiure at my particular requeft,by a flag sent on par­  
pofs for bim by JofhuaSmith, Esq; whe had permilfion  
o go to Dobbs’s ferry to carry letters, and for other  
purposes not mentioned, and to roturn. This was  
doae as 2 blind to the spy boats : Mr. Smith st the  
some time had my private direClicns to go om board  
the Veliture, and bring on fhora Col Robinfoa, orMr.  
John Anderfor, which was the name [ had requeited  
Major Andre to assume : At the fame time Idefired  
M:. Smith to inform him, that he thould have my  
roteftion, and a fafe paflport to return in the fame  
gon, 8s soon 2s our bufinels was compleated. Asfe­  
yerai accidenis i .terveeed to prevent his being sent o 8  
boa:d, I gave hizn my paflport te returs by land.—  
Major Aodre came on shore in his uniform (without  
difguifc) which, with much relu®ance, at my particu­  
lar and prefling inflance, he exchanged for amother  
eoat. I furnithed him with a horse and saddle, and  
pointed out the routs by which he wasto retura. And  
.as commanndiag-officer in tne department, I had an  
undoubled right 1o tranfadt all these matters ; which,  
if wrong, Msjar Arndre ought by no means to fufier  
for them. :  
Bat if, afier this jult and candid representation of  
Mzjor Andre’s cale, the Board of General Offiders ad­  
he:e to their former cpinion, I thall suppose it ditated  
by paflion and refentmant ; and if that Gentleman  
should fuffer thd severity of their {entence, I shall think  
m) felf bound by every tie of duty and honor, to reta­  
lizte on such anhappy perfoas of your army, a 8 may  
fall withia my power, that the refpett due to flags,  
and to the law of nations, may bs better uaderflood  
and observed.  
1 havs further to oblerve, that foity of the principal  
inhabitarts of South-Carcline have jaßtly forfeited  
their lives, which bave hitherto been spared by the  
elemency of his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, who  
canrotin justice ex-end his mercy to them any longer,  
if Major Andre fuffers 5 which in all probability will  
open 2 {cene of blood at which humanity will revolt.  
Suftcr me to intreat your Excellency, for your owh  
and the honor of humanity, and the love you have of  
jofice; that you fuffer not an unjult sentence to touch  
the life of Msjor Andre. : ;  
Bat if this warniag theuld be difragarded, and he  
fuffer, I cail beaven aud earth to witnefls, that your  
Excelleacy wiil bz justly answerable for the torrent of  
blnod that may be {oilt in confequeuce.

Sir, Nem York, Oct. 1, 1780.  
Tue polite attention shewn by  
your Excellency and the gentlemen  
of your family to Mrs. Arnold,  
when in distress, demands my  
grateful acknowledgement and  
  
I related, that a captain Robin-| thanks, which I beg leave to pre-  
  
  
  
  
  
Lowe See OE eee ST  
  
$87 Aypri&#x27;’  
  
sent. From your Excellency’s let-  
ter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a  
Board of General Officers have gi-  
ven it as their opinion, that Major  
André comes under the description  
of a spy: my good opinion of the  
candour and justice of those gen-  
  
tlenien leads me to believe, that if  
  
they had been made fully acquaint-  
ed with every circumstance respect-  
ing Major André, they would by  
no means have considered him in  
the light of a spy, or even of a pri-  
soner. In justice to him, I think  
it my duty to declare, that he came  
from on board the Vulture at my  
particular request, by a flag sent  
on purpose for him by Joshua  
Smith, Esq. who had permission to  
go to Dobb’s-ferry to carry letters,  
and for other purposes not men-  
tioned, and to return. This was  
done as a blind to the spy-boats.  
Mr. Smith at the same time had  
my private directions to go on  
board the Vulture, and bring on  
shore Colonel Robinson, or Mr.  
John Anderson, which was the  
name I had requested Major An-  
dré to assume: at the same time I  
desired Mr. Smith to inform him,  
that he should have my protection,  
and a safe passport to return in  
the same boat, as soon as our  
business was completed. As se-  
veral accidents intervened to pre-  
vent his being sent on board, |  
gave him my passpori to return by  
land. Major André came on shore  
in his uniform (without disguise)  
which, with much reluctance, at  
my particular and pressing in-  
stance, he exchanged for another  
eoat. I furnished him witha horse  
and saddle, and pointed out the  
route by which he was to return:  
and as commanding officer in the  
department, I had an undoubted  
right to transact all these matters,  
which, if wrong, Major André  
ought by no means io sufler for  
them.  
  
But if, after this just and candid  
representation of Major André’s  
case, the Board of General Officers  
  
s Bones. 888  
  
adhere to their former opinion, I  
shall suppose it dictated by pas-  
sion and resentment; and if that  
gentleman should suffer the seve-  
rity of their sentence, I should  
think myself bound by every tie of  
duty and honour to retaliate on  
such unhappy persons of your  
army as may fall within my power,  
that the respect due to flags, and  
to the law of nations, may be bet-  
ter understood and observed.  
  
I have farther to observe, that  
forty of the principal inhabitants  
of South Carolina have justly for-  
feited their lives, which have hi-  
therto been spared by the clemency  
of his Excellency Sir Henry Clin-  
ton, who cannot in justice extend  
his mercy to them any longer, if  
Major André suffers ; which, in all  
probability, will opea a scene of  
blood at which humanity will re-  
voit.  
  
Suffer me to intreat your Excel-  
lency, for your own, and the honour  
of humanity, and the love you have  
of justice, that you suffer not an  
unjust senteuce to touch the life of  
Major André.  
  
But if this warning should be  
disregarded, and he suffer, 1 call  
heaven and earth to witness, that  
your Excellency will be justly an-  
swerable for the torrent of blood  
that may be spilt in consequence.  
  
I have the honour to be, with due  
respect, your Excellency’s most  
obedient and very humble ser-  
vant, B. ARNOLD
