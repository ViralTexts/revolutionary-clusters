treaties we have made. With Great-BriÂ­

Amity and Commerce. None of these

of them, from any prince or Å¿tate with which the {aid United Statgs  
Å¿hall be at war: nor Å¿hall any citizen, Å¿ubject, or inhabitant of the Å¿aid  
United States, cr any of them, apply for, or take any commiÅ¿hon or  
letters of marque, for arming any Å¿hip or Å¿hips, to act as privateers  
againÅ¿t the Å¿ubjects of the Molt ChriÅ¿tian King, or any of them, or the  
property of any of them, from any prince or tate with which the Å¿aid  
king Å¿hall be at war : and if any perÅ¿on of either nation Å¿hall take Å¿uch  
commiÅ¿Å¿ions or letters of marque, he Å¿hall be puniÅ¿hed as a pirate.  
  
XXII. It Å¿hall not be lawful for any foreign privateers, not be-  
longing to Å¿ubjects of the MoÅ¿t ChriÅ¿tian King, nor citizens of the  
Å¿aid United States, who have commiÅ¿Å¿ions from any other prince or  
  
  
Å¿tate in enmity with either nation, to fit their Å¿hips in the ports of  
either the one or the other of the aforeÅ¿aid parties, to fell what they  
have taken, or in any other manner whatÅ¿oever, to exchange their  
Å¿hips, merchandiÅ¿es, or any other lading: neither Å¿hall they be al-  
lowed even to purchaÅ¿e victuals, except Å¿uch as Å¿hall be neceÅ¿Å¿ary for  
their going to the next port of that prince or Å¿tate from which they  
have commiÅ¿Å¿ions.  
  
XXIII. It Å¿hall be lawful for all and Å¿ingular the Å¿ubjects of the  
MoÅ¿t ChriÅ¿tian King, and the citizens, people, and inhabitants of  
the Å¿aid United States, to fail with their Å¿hips with all manner of  
liberty and Å¿ecurity, no diÅ¿tinction being made who are the proprie-  
tors of the merchandiÅ¿es laden thereon, from any port, to the places  
of thoÅ¿e who now are or hereafter Å¿hall be at enmity with the MoÅ¿t  
ChriÅ¿tian King or the United States. It Å¿hall likewiÅ¿e be lawful for  
the Å¿ubjects and inhabitants aforeÅ¿aid, to fail with the Å¿hips and mer-  
chandifes aforementioned, and to trade with the fame liberty and  
Å¿ecurity from the places, ports and havens of thoÅ¿e who are enemies  
of both or either party, without any oppoÅ¿ition or diÅ¿turbance what-  
Å¿oever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforemen-  
tioned, to neutral places; but alÅ¿o from one place belonging to an  
enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be  
under the juriÅ¿diction of the Å¿ame prince, or under Å¿everal. And it  
is hereby flipulated, that free Å¿hips Å¿hall alÅ¿o give a freedom to goods;  
and that every thing Å¿hall be deemed to be free and exempt, which  
Å¿hall be found on board the Å¿hips belonging to the Å¿ubjects of either of  
the confederates, although the whole lading or any part thereof  
Å¿hould appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being  
always excepted. It is alÅ¿o agreed in like manner, that the Å¿ame  
liberty be extended to perÅ¿ons who are on board a free Å¿hip, with  
this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either party,  
they are not to be taken out of that free Å¿hip, unleÅ¿s they are Å¿oldiers  
and in actual Å¿ervice of the enemy.  
  
XXIV. This libertyof navigation and commerce Å¿hall extendtoall kinds  
of merchandiÅ¿es, excepting thoÅ¿e only which are diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed by the  
name of contraband, and under this name of contraband or prohibit-  
ed goodsÅ¿hall be comprehended arms, great guns, bombs, with the fuÅ¿ecs  
and other things belonging to them, cannon- ball, gun-powder, match,  
pikes, Å¿words, lances, Å¿pears, halberds, mortars, petards, grenades,  
Å¿altpetre, muÅ¿kets, muÅ¿ket ball, bucklers, helmets, brealt-plates, coats  
of mail, and the like kinds of arms, proper for arming Å¿oldiers, muÅ¿-  
ket-reÅ¿ts, belts, horÅ¿es with their furniture, and all other warlike inÅ¿tru-  
ments whatever. TheÅ¿e merchandiÅ¿es that follow, Å¿hall not be rec-  
koned among contraband or prohibited goods; that is to fay, all  
Å¿orts of cloths, and all other manufactures woven of any wool, flax,  
Å¿ilk, cotton, or any other materials whatever; all kitds of wearing  
apparel, together with the Å¿pecies whereof they are uÅ¿ed to be made;  
gold and Å¿ilver, as well coined as uncoined, tin, iron, latten, copper,  
braÅ¿s, coals ; as alÅ¿o wheat and barley, and any other kind of corn,  
and pulÅ¿e, tobacco, and hkewife all manner of Å¿pices, falted and  
  
  
Å¿moaked fleÅ¿h, Å¿alted fiÅ¿h, cheeÅ¿e and butter, beer, oils, wines, Å¿ugars,  
and all forts of Å¿alts, and in general all proviÅ¿ions which Å¿erve for  
the nouriÅ¿hment of mankind and the Å¿uÅ¿tenance of life ; furthermore,  
all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, Å¿ails, Å¿ail-  
cloths, anchors, and any parts of anchor, alÅ¿o Å¿hips, maÅ¿ts, planks,  
boards, and beams of what trees Å¿oever : and all other things proper  
either for building or repairing Å¿hips, and all other goods whatever  
which have not been worked into the form of any inÅ¿trument or thing  
prepared for war by land or by Å¿ea, Å¿hall not be reputed contraband,  
much leÅ¿s Å¿uch as have been already wrought and made up for any  
other uÅ¿e ; all which Å¿hall be wholly reckoned among free goods; as  
likewiÅ¿e all other merchandiÅ¿es and things which are not compre-  
bended and particularly mentioned in the foregoing enumeration of  
con d goods, Å¿o that they may be tranÅ¿ported and carried in the  
freeÅ¿t manner by the Å¿ubjects of both â even to places  
belonging to an enemy âÅ¿uch towns or places being only excepted,  
as are at that time beÅ¿ieged blocked up, or inveÅ¿ted.  
  
XXV. To the end that all manner of diÅ¿Å¿entions and quarrels ma  
be avoided and prevented, on one fide and the other, it is â  
that in caÅ¿e either of the parties hereto Å¿hould be engaged in war,  
the Å¿hips and veÅ¿Å¿els belonging to the Å¿ubjects or people of the other  
ally, muÅ¿t be furniÅ¿hed with Å¿ea letters or paÅ¿Å¿ports, expreÅ¿Å¿ing the  
name, property, and bulk of the Å¿hip, as allo the name and place of  
habitation of the commander of the faid Å¿hip, that it may appear  
thereby that the Å¿hip really and truly belongs to the Å¿ubjects of one  
- of the parties, which paÅ¿Å¿port Å¿hall be made out and granted accord-  
ing to the form annexed to this treaty. They Å¿hall likewiÅ¿e be re-  
called every year, that is, if the Å¿hip happens to return home within  
the Å¿pace of a year; it is likewiÅ¿e agreed, that Å¿uch Å¿hips, being  
laden, are to be provided not only with paÅ¿Å¿ports as above mentioned,  
but alÅ¿o with certificates, containing the â particulars of the  
cargo, the place whence the Å¿hip Å¿ailed, and whither Å¿he is bound;  
that Å¿o it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods  
be on board the Å¿ame ; which certificates Å¿hall be made out by the  
officers of the place whence the Å¿hip Å¿et fail, in the accuÅ¿tomed form:  
and if any one Å¿hall think it fit or adviÅ¿eable to expreÅ¿s in the Å¿aid cer-  
tificates the perÅ¿on to whom the goods on board belong, he may freely  
do Å¿o.  
  
XXVI. The Å¿hips of the Å¿ubjects and inhabitants of either of the  
â coming upon any coaÅ¿ts belonging to either of the Å¿aid allies,  
  
t not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port, and not  
willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, they Å¿hall be treated  
according to the general rules preÅ¿cribed or to be preÅ¿cribed relative  
to the object in queÅ¿tion. |  
  
XXVII. If the Å¿hips of the Å¿aid Å¿ubjects, people, or inhabitants of  
either of the parties, Å¿hall be met with, either failing along the coaÅ¿ts,  
or on the high Å¿eas, by any Å¿hips of war of the other, or by any priva-  
.vateers, the Å¿aid Å¿hips of war or privateers for the avoiding of any diÅ¿-

isting treaty with France grant a privilege  
to the French to fell their prizes in the  
United States PâTo answer this, we mult  
refer to the treaty itfelf.âln the Â¢ treaty  
of Amity and Commerce between the  
United States of America, and France,â  
made at Pans, the 6th February, 1778,  
and now in force, in Article 16th, it 13  
provided, That Â¢it {hall, be lawful for the  
Jhips of war of either party, and privateers,  
freely to carry witherfocver they please,  
the Jlips and goods taken from therr enee  
mies, without being obliged to Â£ay any dua  
2y to the officers of the admiralty, or any  
other judges ; nor shall such prizes be arÂ­  
refled or {eized when they come to and  
enter the ports of either party ; nor shall  
the searchers or other officers of those pla~  
ces search the fame, or make examination

fartand carry thesr prizes to the places exÂ­  
pressed in their commissions, which the come  
manders of such ships of war shall be  
obliged to show.â  
  
From the above premises it must apÂ­  
pear, that though permiffionâ is given the  
French to bring their prizes for Jafety ins  
to the ports of the United States, and teo  
depart the fame without molestation, or  
the payment of tonnage or other duties,

âThe 9th article of the treaty between Spain and the United States,  
dated 27th October, 1795, ( which has been continued in force by a sub-  
sequent treaty,) is as follows: â Allshipsand merchandise of what nature  
soever, Which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or rob-  
bers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either state, and  
shall be delivered to the custody of the officers of that port, in order to  
be taken care of, and restored entire to the true proprietor, as soon as due  
and sufficient proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.â  
  
This makes the case much stronger in favor of the Spanish claimants.  
There can be no difference, in reason, whether the vessel be captured on  
the high seas, or within our own waters or ports; because, if captured  
on the high seas, they are to be brought into port and delivered into the  
custody of the appropriate public officers ; and if captured after having  
already come into a port, they should be treated in like manner. It there-  
fore seems to me that this case is clearly within the spirit and meaning  
of the 9th article, and that the vessel and cargo should be

MEXICAN PRIVATEERS AGAINST THE UNITED

of the Secretary of State, to tli6 chairman of  
the Board of Underwriters of New York, that  
wo have little to fear from Mexican privateers

WASHINGTON, April 11, 1846.  
My Dear Sir: In consequence of our conÂ­  
versation a few minutes since, I think it proper  
to inform you , without delay, that our Treaty  
with Spain ofthe 20th October, 1795, contains  
the following article, still in force:  
&quot;Art. 14. No subject of his Catholic Majesty  
shall apply for or take any commission or letÂ­  
ters of marque, for arming any ship or ships to  
act us privateers against the said U. States, or  
against tho citizens, people or inhabitants of  
the said U. States, or against the property ot  
any ofthe inhabitants of any ofthein, from any  
prince or State with which tho said U. States  
shall be at war.  
  
&quot;Nor shall any citizen, subject, or inhabitant,  
ofthe said United States,apply for, or take, any  
commission, or letter of marque, for arming any  
ship or ships to act as privateers against the  
subjects of his Catholic Majesty, or tho proÂ­  
perty of any of them, from any prince or State  
with which the said King shall be at war. And  
if any person of either nation shall take such

lows:  
No subject of his Catholic Majesty shall

As many of our people, and particularly some navy  
officers, hold the doctrine that a vessel of war has this  
right, I will here give an extract from the treaty, which  
is before me, vis: &quot;Article 18th, Treaty of 1798,  
If the ships of the said subjests, people, or inhabitants,  
of either of the parties, shall be met with, elther sailing  
along the coasts or on the high seas, by any ship of war  
of the ether, or by any privateer, the said ship of war  
or privateer for the avoiding of any disorder, sha ll reÂ­  
main out of cannon shot, and may send their boats  
aboard the merchant ship which they shall so meet  
with, and may enter her the number of two or thres  
men only, to whom the master or commander of such  
ship or vessel shall exhibit his passports, concerning  
the property of the ship, made out according to the form  
inserted in this present treaty; and the ship, when she  
shall have shown such passports, shall be free, and at  
liberty to pursue her voyage, so as it shall net be  
lawful to molest or give her chase in any manner, or  
force her to quit her intended courss.on  
From this extract you perceive the authority of Cubs,  
by making this proclamation and giving orders to the  
naval commanders to coincide with such proclamsaties,  
has in the two instances mentioned positively viclatedd  
treaty. I have no doubt it would have continued had  
not the United States government made the little hostile  
demonstration it has, in sending out the San Jacinte,  
Princeton, Fulton, and Jamestown, with such orders as  
were given to their commanders. This little fleet has  
been often laughed at in consequence of its meagreness

Presgent himself is ro anxious to malutain in its constitne  
power in all cases arising under the Constitution  
and the laws of the United States and treaties made under  
their authority.  
The ianguage of the treaty cited by the Court is, (article  
):  
That all ships and merchandise, of what nature soever,  
which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or rob.  
bers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either  
State and shail be delivered into the custody of the officers of  
that port, in order to be taken care of and restored entire to the  
true proprietor as soon as due and sufficient proof shall be  
made concerning the property thereof.  
The Court says:  
To bring the case within the article, it is essential to establish,  
first, that these negroes, under all the circumstances, fall within  
the description of merchandise in the sense of the treaty;  
secondly, that there has been a reacue of them on the high seas  
out of the hands of pirates and robbers, which, in the present  
case can only be by showing that they themselves are pirates  
and robbers; and thirdly, that Kulz and Montez, the asserted  
proprietors, are the true proprietors, and have established their
