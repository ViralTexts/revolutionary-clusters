treaties we have made. With Great-Bri­

Amity and Commerce. None of these

nation may be the means of involving us in  
war with that nation.

merchants, in the cities and towns where they live, for ſelling and

taken from them, or any injury be done them within that term, by  
either party, or the people or Tubjects of either, full ſatisfaction {h  
be made for the ſame.  
  
XXI. No ſubjects of the Moſt Chriſtian King ſhall apply for, or  
take any — or letters of marque, for arming any ſhip or ſhips

longing to ſubjects of the Moſt Chriſtian King, nor citizens of the  
ſaid United States, who have commiſſions from any other prince or  
  
  
ſtate in enmity with either nation, to fit their ſhips in the ports of  
either the one or the other of the aforeſaid parties, to fell what they  
have taken, or in any other manner whatſoever, to exchange their

lowed even to purchaſe victuals, except ſuch as ſhall be neceſſary for  
their going to the next port of that prince or ſtate from which they  
have commiſſions.  
  
XXIII. It ſhall be lawful for all and ſingular the ſubjects of the  
Moſt Chriſtian King, and the citizens, people, and inhabitants of  
the ſaid United States, to fail with their ſhips with all manner of  
liberty and ſecurity, no diſtinction being made who are the proprie-  
tors of the merchandiſes laden thereon, from any port, to the places  
of thoſe who now are or hereafter ſhall be at enmity with the Moſt  
Chriſtian King or the United States. It ſhall likewiſe be lawful for  
the ſubjects and inhabitants aforeſaid, to fail with the ſhips and mer-  
chandifes aforementioned, and to trade with the fame liberty and  
ſecurity from the places, ports and havens of thoſe who are enemies  
of both or either party, without any oppoſition or diſturbance what-  
ſoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforemen-  
tioned, to neutral places; but alſo from one place belonging to an  
enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be  
under the juriſdiction of the ſame prince, or under ſeveral. And it  
is hereby flipulated, that free ſhips ſhall alſo give a freedom to goods;  
and that every thing ſhall be deemed to be free and exempt, which  
ſhall be found on board the ſhips belonging to the ſubjects of either of  
the confederates, although the whole lading or any part thereof  
ſhould appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being  
always excepted. It is alſo agreed in like manner, that the ſame  
liberty be extended to perſons who are on board a free ſhip, with  
this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either party,  
they are not to be taken out of that free ſhip, unleſs they are ſoldiers  
and in actual ſervice of the enemy.  
  
XXIV. This libertyof navigation and commerce ſhall extendtoall kinds  
of merchandiſes, excepting thoſe only which are diſtinguiſhed by the  
name of contraband, and under this name of contraband or prohibit-  
ed goodsſhall be comprehended arms, great guns, bombs, with the fuſecs  
and other things belonging to them, cannon- ball, gun-powder, match,  
pikes, ſwords, lances, ſpears, halberds, mortars, petards, grenades,  
ſaltpetre, muſkets, muſket ball, bucklers, helmets, brealt-plates, coats  
of mail, and the like kinds of arms, proper for arming ſoldiers, muſ-  
ket-reſts, belts, horſes with their furniture, and all other warlike inſtru-  
ments whatever. Theſe merchandiſes that follow, ſhall not be rec-  
koned among contraband or prohibited goods; that is to fay, all  
ſorts of cloths, and all other manufactures woven of any wool, flax,  
ſilk, cotton, or any other materials whatever; all kitds of wearing  
apparel, together with the ſpecies whereof they are uſed to be made;  
gold and ſilver, as well coined as uncoined, tin, iron, latten, copper,  
braſs, coals ; as alſo wheat and barley, and any other kind of corn,  
and pulſe, tobacco, and hkewife all manner of ſpices, falted and  
  
  
ſmoaked fleſh, ſalted fiſh, cheeſe and butter, beer, oils, wines, ſugars,  
and all forts of ſalts, and in general all proviſions which ſerve for  
the nouriſhment of mankind and the ſuſtenance of life ; furthermore,  
all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, ſails, ſail-  
cloths, anchors, and any parts of anchor, alſo ſhips, maſts, planks,  
boards, and beams of what trees ſoever : and all other things proper  
either for building or repairing ſhips, and all other goods whatever  
which have not been worked into the form of any inſtrument or thing  
prepared for war by land or by ſea, ſhall not be reputed contraband,  
much leſs ſuch as have been already wrought and made up for any  
other uſe ; all which ſhall be wholly reckoned among free goods; as  
likewiſe all other merchandiſes and things which are not compre-  
bended and particularly mentioned in the foregoing enumeration of  
con d goods, ſo that they may be tranſported and carried in the  
freeſt manner by the ſubjects of both — even to places  
belonging to an enemy —ſuch towns or places being only excepted,  
as are at that time beſieged blocked up, or inveſted.  
  
XXV. To the end that all manner of diſſentions and quarrels ma  
be avoided and prevented, on one fide and the other, it is —  
that in caſe either of the parties hereto ſhould be engaged in war,  
the ſhips and veſſels belonging to the ſubjects or people of the other  
ally, muſt be furniſhed with ſea letters or paſſports, expreſſing the  
name, property, and bulk of the ſhip, as allo the name and place of  
habitation of the commander of the faid ſhip, that it may appear  
thereby that the ſhip really and truly belongs to the ſubjects of one  
- of the parties, which paſſport ſhall be made out and granted accord-  
ing to the form annexed to this treaty. They ſhall likewiſe be re-  
called every year, that is, if the ſhip happens to return home within  
the ſpace of a year; it is likewiſe agreed, that ſuch ſhips, being  
laden, are to be provided not only with paſſports as above mentioned,  
but alſo with certificates, containing the — particulars of the  
cargo, the place whence the ſhip ſailed, and whither ſhe is bound;  
that ſo it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods  
be on board the ſame ; which certificates ſhall be made out by the  
officers of the place whence the ſhip ſet fail, in the accuſtomed form:  
and if any one ſhall think it fit or adviſeable to expreſs in the ſaid cer-  
tificates the perſon to whom the goods on board belong, he may freely  
do ſo.  
  
XXVI. The ſhips of the ſubjects and inhabitants of either of the  
— coming upon any coaſts belonging to either of the ſaid allies,  
  
t not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port, and not  
willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, they ſhall be treated  
according to the general rules preſcribed or to be preſcribed relative  
to the object in queſtion. |  
  
XXVII. If the ſhips of the ſaid ſubjects, people, or inhabitants of  
either of the parties, ſhall be met with, either failing along the coaſts,  
or on the high ſeas, by any ſhips of war of the other, or by any priva-  
.vateers, the ſaid ſhips of war or privateers for the avoiding of any diſ-

‘The 9th article of the treaty between Spain and the United States,  
dated 27th October, 1795, ( which has been continued in force by a sub-  
sequent treaty,) is as follows: ‘ Allshipsand merchandise of what nature  
soever, Which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or rob-  
bers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either state, and  
shall be delivered to the custody of the officers of that port, in order to  
be taken care of, and restored entire to the true proprietor, as soon as due  
and sufficient proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.”  
  
This makes the case much stronger in favor of the Spanish claimants.  
There can be no difference, in reason, whether the vessel be captured on  
the high seas, or within our own waters or ports; because, if captured  
on the high seas, they are to be brought into port and delivered into the  
custody of the appropriate public officers ; and if captured after having  
already come into a port, they should be treated in like manner. It there-  
fore seems to me that this case is clearly within the spirit and meaning

d for this nefarious purpose. Indeed, it  
has been suggested that the two Mexican steamers,  
which have been recently transferred to the Havanna,  
have been sent there with this object. We know  
that the government of Spain would not sanction  
such a proceeding; but it is not generally known that  
a Spanish subject could not accept a commission  
for this purpose from the Mexican government with-  
out being guilty of piracy. For public information,  
we copy the 14th article of our treaty with Spaia of

As it is rumored that Mexico has issuied  
blank letters of marane and tent theu  
  
it may become important to know what  
are the treaty stipulations between the Uni­

fourteenth article of the treaty  
Lorenzo el Real, October 20, 1205, is as fol.  
lows:  
No subject of his Catholic Majesty shall  
apply for or take any commission or letters  
&quot;of marque, for arming any ship or ships to act  
&quot;as privateers against the said United States,

of the said United States, or against the  
property of any of the inhabitants of any

&quot;which the said United States shall be at war.

As many of our people, and particularly some navy  
officers, hold the doctrine that a vessel of war has this  
right, I will here give an extract from the treaty, which  
is before me, vis: &quot;Article 18th, Treaty of 1798,  
If the ships of the said subjests, people, or inhabitants,  
of either of the parties, shall be met with, elther sailing  
along the coasts or on the high seas, by any ship of war  
of the ether, or by any privateer, the said ship of war  
or privateer for the avoiding of any disorder, sha ll re­  
main out of cannon shot, and may send their boats  
aboard the merchant ship which they shall so meet  
with, and may enter her the number of two or thres  
men only, to whom the master or commander of such  
ship or vessel shall exhibit his passports, concerning  
the property of the ship, made out according to the form  
inserted in this present treaty; and the ship, when she  
shall have shown such passports, shall be free, and at  
liberty to pursue her voyage, so as it shall net be  
lawful to molest or give her chase in any manner, or  
force her to quit her intended courss.on  
From this extract you perceive the authority of Cubs,  
by making this proclamation and giving orders to the  
naval commanders to coincide with such proclamsaties,  
has in the two instances mentioned positively viclatedd  
treaty. I have no doubt it would have continued had  
not the United States government made the little hostile  
demonstration it has, in sending out the San Jacinte,  
Princeton, Fulton, and Jamestown, with such orders as  
were given to their commanders. This little fleet has  
been often laughed at in consequence of its meagreness

Presgent himself is ro anxious to malutain in its constitne  
power in all cases arising under the Constitution  
and the laws of the United States and treaties made under  
their authority.  
The ianguage of the treaty cited by the Court is, (article  
):  
That all ships and merchandise, of what nature soever,  
which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or rob.  
bers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either  
State and shail be delivered into the custody of the officers of  
that port, in order to be taken care of and restored entire to the  
true proprietor as soon as due and sufficient proof shall be  
made concerning the property thereof.  
The Court says:  
To bring the case within the article, it is essential to establish,  
first, that these negroes, under all the circumstances, fall within  
the description of merchandise in the sense of the treaty;  
secondly, that there has been a reacue of them on the high seas  
out of the hands of pirates and robbers, which, in the present  
case can only be by showing that they themselves are pirates  
and robbers; and thirdly, that Kulz and Montez, the asserted  
proprietors, are the true proprietors, and have established their  
title by competent proof.
