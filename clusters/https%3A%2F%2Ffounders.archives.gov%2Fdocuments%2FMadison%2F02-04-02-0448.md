 The sensibility and unanimity in our nation which have appeared on this occasion, must convince France, that friendship and peace with us must be precarious until the Mississipi shall be made the boundary between the United States and Louisiana; and consequently render the present moment favorable to the object with which you are charged.  
The time chosen for this experiment is pointed out also by other important considerations: The instability of the peace of Europe, the attitude taken by Great Britain, the languishing state of the French finances, and the absolute necessity of either abandoning the West India Islands or of sending thither large armaments at great expence all contribute at the present crisis to prepare in the French Government a disposition to listen to an arrangement which will at once dry up one source of foreign controversy, and furnish some aid in struggling with internal embarrassments. It is to be added that the overtures committed to you coincide in great measure with the ideas of the person thro’ whom the letter from the President of April 30th. 1802 was conveyed to Mr. Livingston, and who is presumed to have gained some insight into the present sentiments of the French cabinet.

ntioned payments shall be made at the Treasury of the United States, and at the rate of one dollar and ten cents for every six livres tournois.  
VII.  
To incorporate the inhabitants of the hereby ceded territory with the citizens of the United States on an equal footing, being a provision, which cannot now be made, it is to be expected, from the character and policy of the United States, that such incorporation will take place without unnecessary delay. In the mean time, they shall be secure in their persons and property, and in the free enjoyment of their religion.  
Observations on the plan.  
1st. As the Cession to be made by France in this case must rest on the Cession made to her by Spain, it might be proper that Spain should be a party to the transaction. The objections however to delay require that nothing more be asked on our part, than either an exhibition and recital of the Treaty between France and Spain; or an

It is hoped that the idea of a guarantee of the country reserved to France, may not be brought into the negotiation. Should France propose such a stipulation it will be expedient to evade it if possible, as more likely to be a source of disagreeable questions, between the parties concerning the actual casus fœderis, than of real advantage to France. It is not in the least probable that Louisiana, in the hands of that nation, will be attacked by any other, whilst it is in the relations to the United States, on which the guarantee would be founded; whereas nothing is more probable than some difference of opinion as to the circumstances and the degree of danger necessary to put the stipulation in force. There will be the less reason in the demand of such an article, as the United States would set little value on a guarantee of any part of their territory, and consequently there would be no just reciprocity in it. Should France notwithstanding these considerations, make a guarantee an essential point, it will be better to accede to it, than to abandon the object of the negotiation; mitigating the evil as much as possible, by requiring for the casus fœderis a great and manifest danger threatened to the territory guaranteed, and by substituting for an indefinite succour, or even a definite succour in military force, a fixed sum of money, payable at the Treasury of the United States.

Here, sir, our negociators were unequivocally  
warned not only to make no agreement for the ad-  
mission of the inhabitants of the ceded territory into  
the union, but to declare that such a stipulation could  
not then be made. By what was it prohibited except  
the limits of the constitution? And what was the  
necessary delay, but to obtain the requisite authority
