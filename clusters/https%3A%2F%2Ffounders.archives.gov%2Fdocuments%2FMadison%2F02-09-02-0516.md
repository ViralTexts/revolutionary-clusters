Charleston South-Carolina 12th. June 1805.  
The Memorial of the President and Directors of the South-Carolina Insurance Company, and of the Merchants, and others interested in the Commerce of the City of Charleston,  
Respectfully sheweth,  
That your Memorialists are deeply affected by the recent Capture, at the very entrance of this port, of the American Ship, Two Friends, by a french privateer. This event has excited, among all classes of Citizens, the strongest sensations, not only because the said Ship was captured without any color of pretence, within sight of Land, but because she is our only regular London trader, and had on board a full supply of spring and summer Goods. The distress and anxiety occasioned by these circumstances are greatly enhanced from our having been hitherto deprived of our spring supplies, and from an anticipation of the consequences justly to be apprehended from a continuance of similar outrages; should not the most prompt and effectual measures be adopted for the protection and security of our commercial interests. Your Memorialists are authorized to add, (altho’ the fact be not detailed in the protest) that it appears from undoubted authority, that the magnitude of the prize was the sole inducement to the abovementioned capture, the Captors having said that they would release the Two Friends, in the event of their falling in with any other valuable prize, which might be more worthy their notice.  
This most extraordinary capture, in direct violation of our Treaty with France, (as appears by the accompanying Documents,) has already been followed, by events no less alarming; our harbour being at this moment completely blockaded by three french privateers, (and more are daily expected) which examine all Vessels coming in, and going out, of this port, and either detain or release them, according as their value excites the cupidity of the Cruizers.  
This degrading State of our Harbour has necessarily raised the premiums of Insurance, thus forcing additional Sums from the pockets of our citizens, has advanced the price of every commodity, and created a distressing stagnation of our Exports; for the Merchants, not receiving their goods from abroad, are incapacitated from purchasing the produce of the Country. Among these deplorable effects of the defenceless and humiliating condition of our commerce, may be moreover enumerated the immense Loss of Duties, those on the Ship Two Friends alone, being estimated by the Collector, at 45,000 Dollars.  
Your Memorialists have the best reasons for believing that this early success, experienced by these french privateers, will immediately allure others in swarms to our Coast and Bar, to the total ruin of private mercantile concerns and the most fatal defalcation of the public revenue: your Memorialists have no less ground for apprehending, that British Cruisers, availing themselves of the Absence of domestic protection, will, under the Color of expelling the French, assume and occupy their ground, and either retain us in the same degraded State, harrassing our Vessels by searches and detentions, or subject us to the disgraceful and mortifying obligations, of gratitude for alien succour and relief.  
Your Memorialists are the more alarmed at these depredations, because much valuable property is still expected this Summer from other quarter’s than London, and considerable importations will be looked for in the Fall for our Winter supplies; and should there not be an early and effectual check to these aggressions, should our Fall importations be also interrupted, the calamities of the last year produced by the Hurricane and other causes, in which this City has largely participated, would be aggravated to such an extent, as to eventuate in general ruin. And these just alarms and apprehensions of your Memorialists are heighthened by the wellknown circumstance of many of the Cruisers, which infest our Shores belonging to St. Iago de Cuba and Barracoa, in which receptacles our vessels and their cargoes, with the Knowledge of the Government of Cuba, are instantly sold without any condemnation whatever, or even the formality of a trial, thereby precluding every future possibility of redress.  
Your Memorialists avail themselves of this occasion to notice a late decision of the district Court within this State, grounded on an Act of Congress, whereby the territorial Jurisdiction of the United States is limited to the Short distance of three miles, or a marine league, from the Coasts or Shores, which by the said Court is construed to mean three miles from the Land; consequently the middle channel of our Bar, being more than three miles distant from the nearest Land, is pronounced by judicial authority to be without the Jurisdiction of the United States, the very entrance of our Harbour, in full sight of the City, where Vessels are frequently obliged to anchor, while waiting for a tide, and with a pilot on board, is, by our own Tribunals, acknowledged to be without the protection of our government!!  
Your Memorialists refrain from commenting on the pernicious effects of a system of policy, so pregnant with dishonor and ruin to the trade and Navigation of the Union at large, but more particularly to those of Charleston, from the Geography of whose shores and peculiar local situation of whose Bar and Harbour, every Vessel, in her ingress and egress, is thus subjected to search, detention or seizure, and content ourselves with a bare statement of the above grievances, superadded to so many others, not doubting that the President will take the same into consideration, and being duly impressed with the necessity of some early remedial arrangement, either of a legislative or diplomatic nature, will recur to such as may appear most conducive to the desired end.  
Your Memorialists, having thus exhibited but an imperfect view of their ruinous, unprotected and degraded Situation, rely with confidence on the prompt interposition of the President, to obtain, by representations to the Minister of France, and of Spain (in the event of the Two Friends being carried to a spanish port) restitution of the said Ship and her Cargo, and to cause a stop to be put to similar spoliations; and Your Memorialists further most earnestly solicit some immediate and effectual Naval protection for our Harbour and Shores, together with such other measures as the National Councils, in their wisdom, may deem expedient, as well for prevention of the renewal of the Outrages we have sustained, as for the permanent safety and protection of our Commercial and navigating Rights and Interests.  
Tho. Corbett, President of the South Carolina

The MEMORIAL of the President anti Directors of  
the South-Carolina Insurance Company, and cf  
the merchants, and others interested in the Com­  
merce of the city of Churlc.stcn,  
RjspertfuUy Shcxcdh.  
That year memorialists are deeply affected by  
the recent capture, at the very entrance of this port,  
of the American ship Txro Friends, by a french pri­  
vateer. Tins e\ ent lias excited among all classes of  
citizens the strongest sensations, not only because the  
said ship evas captured without any colour of pre­  
tence, within signt of land hut because she is our only  
regular London trader, and had onboard a full sup­  
ply of spring and summer goads. The distress and  
anxiety occasioned by these circumstances, are great­  
ly enhanced from our Inn ing b.veu hitherto deprived  
of our spring supplies, s.nU from an anticipation of  
the consequence justly to be apprehended from a  
continuance cf similar outrages should not the most  
prompt and cfLct :al measures be adopted for the  
protection and security cf cur commercial interests.  
Your Memorialists are authorised to add (although  
the fact he not d&lt; tailed in the protest) that it appears  
from undoubted authority, that the magnitude of the  
prize was the sole inducement to the above-mention­  
ed capture, the c; pters having said that they would  
release the Two Friends, in the event of their falling  
in with any other valuable prize, which might be  
t more worthy their notice.  
This most extraordinary capture, in direct viola­  
tion of our treaty with France, (as appears by the ac­  
companying documents) has already been followed  
l)V events no less alarming—our harbour being at tiiis  
moment completely blockaded by three French pri­  
vateers, (and more are daily expected) which ex­  
  
aVine all vess-ls Fomins in ?.ni going out of this port  
and eitheirdetiin or release them, according as their  
value excites the cupidity of the cruizers.  
This degrading state of our harbour has necessa­  
rily raised the premium of insurance, thus forcing ad­  
ditional sums from tne pockets of our citizens—has  
advanced the price of every commodity, and created  
a distressing stagnation of our exports; for the mer­  
chants, not receiving their goods from abroad, are  
incapacitated from purchasing the produce of the  
country. Among these deplorable effects of the de­  
fenceless and humiliating condition of our commerce,  
may be moreover enumerated the immense loss of  
duties—those cr. the ship Tvjo Frinuis alone, being  
estimated by the Collector, at &#x27;io,0G0 dollars. °  
Your memorialists have the best reasons for believ­  
ing that the early success, experienced by these  
French privateers, will immediately allure others in  
swarms to our coasts and bar, to the total ruin of pri­  
vate mercantile concerns, and the most fatal defal­  
cation of the piib’ick revenue : Your memorialists  
have no less ground for apprehending that Britiih  
cruizers, availing themselves of the absence of uo­  
mestick protection, will,under thejudour of expelling  
t.ie French, assume and occupy tiRr ground,and ei­  
tuer retain us in the same degraded state, h.trrassing  
ou*’i&#x27; cs&#x27;t&#x27;hs by searches and detentions, or subject us  
to the disgraceful and mortifj ir.g obligations of grati­  
tude, lor alien succour and relief.  
\our memorialists are the more alarmed at these  
depredations, because much valuable property is still  
expected this summer, from other quarters than  
London, and considerable importations will be looked  
for in the fall, for our winter supplies; amtoehould  
there not he an early and oflectua! r.ho.-.fc t.. it,,.,-..  
  
gressions; should our f ill importations be also inter­  
rupted, the calamities of the last year, produced lu­  
the hurricane and other causes, in winch this city  
has so largely participate;!, would he aggravated to  
sucti an extent, as to enventuate in general ruin_and  
these great al&#x27;it ms and apprehensions of vntir Memo- \
ri.dists, ai c heightened by the well known ctrcuni- j  
stance of many ot the cruizers which infest our i  
shares, belonging to St. Jag.a de Cuba and llurr.icou, i  
in which receptacles our vessels and their cargoes, &#x27;  
wail the knowledge rfthe Government of Cub;p are |  
instantly sold, without even 11 ic- formality of a trial, I  
or ant condemnation w hate t er, dicrcby precluding &#x27;  
every probability of redress. &quot; &#x27; J j  
\&#x27; ur Memorialists avail them; elves of this occa- ‘  
Sion, to iy t:ce a late decision of the district court j  
wtthin this state, grounded on an a. t of congress, !  
whereby tin- territorial jurisdiction of the lhdtc.1 I  
states is limited to the abort distance of three miles, !  
or a marine league, from the comas c.r shores, which, !  
g/ the said Court, is construed to moan three miles 1  
ti om the lane! ; consequently, the middle channel of I  
our bar, being mure th .11 three miles distant from  
ti.e 11 s.n e;si mud, is pronounced ov judicial;;u1 ’-erit\ ,  
to be without the jurisdictic 11 of the L&#x27;mltd States 1  
Th.e very entrance of our harbuur, in fell sight cf the  
cyty, where teasels are frequent!- obliged to anchor  
tvhiie waiting for a tide, and with a pilot on hoard,  
is, by cur o.vn tribunals, acknowledged to he without  
tue pr: tcctir.u oi our government! 1 1  
\ our r.tcmc.i i.ui.-Us refrain from commenting on the  
pernicious c.Tects of a system ot policy so pregnant  
with dishonour and ruin to the trade and n iv igation  
oi inc union at large, but more particularly to those  
cf Charleston,, from the geography of whose shores,  
aad peculiar situation 01 whose bar and harbour, eve­  
ry vessel, in her ingress nod egress, is thus subject­  
eu to search, detention, or seizure. We content  
ourselves with a bare statement of the above griev­  
ance, supertulded to so many others, not doubting  
that the 1 resident will take the seme into considera­  
tion, and being duly impressed with the necessity of  
seme early remedial arrangement, cither of a legis­  
lative or diplomatic.}; nature, will recur to such as  
may appear most conducive to the desired end.  
Your memorialists having thus exhibited but an  
impelled view cf their ruinous, unprotected, and  
t.egrudcd situation, rely with confidence on the prompt  
interposition of the President, to obtain, by repre­  
sentations to the minister of France, and of Sp un,  
(in the event of the Two Friends being carried into a  
Spanish port) restitution of the said ship and her car­  
go, and to cause a stop to be put to similar spulia­  
tiom-. And jour memorialists further most earnest­  
ly solicit some immediate and effectual naval protec­  
tion tor our harbour and shores, together with such  
other measures as the national counsels, in them wis­  
dom, may deem expedient, as well fur prevention  
ot the renewal of the outrages we have sustained, as  
bar the pel manent safety and protection of our com­  
mercial.,ml navigating rights and interests

THfc MKMORUL  
Of the President and Director, Vc  
Respectfully sheweth,  
THAT your Memorialists are  
deeply affected by the recent cap­  
cure, at the very entrance ol this  
port, ot the American ship Tw o  
Friends, bv a French privateer.  
This event has excited among at  
rinses of citizens, the stronger  
nrvt onlv --because the  
.a&#x27;.A hm was captured without an  
colbur-&#x27;Ofiibretence, within sight  
of landbut because she is our &#x27; n-  
ly regular London trader, and bad  
oh board a full sup;dfv ot spring and  
summer goods. The distress and  
.nv!.. ..rrltoned bv these cir  
cumstances, are greatly eub.ncec  
from our having been hitherto De­  
prived of our spring supplies, and  
from, an anticipation pf the tense­  
qu.ncts justly to beapprehended  
frm a continuance of similar out­  
rages, should not the most prompt  
and effectual measures be adopted  
for the protection and security ol  
our commercial interests.  
Your M ?mnrialits -,re authori­  
sed tp add, (Vth. the tact be not  
detaTeditithv Protest) that it ap­  
pears trom uncounted authority,  
that the m uuxic f the prize wa  
the sole indu env nt to the above  
mentioned capturr, the captor  
having s id that theV would rel ase  
the Two Friend, in the event o  
th ir falling in with am othc r valu­  
able prize, which might be more  
worthy their notice. s,  
J m most extraordinary capture,  
in direct vi l.itior 001 r mat v wi h  
France, (as appears by the accom-  
j panunt; oocumnts; nas a.rc.iu;

three Fren h p iv.iteers, (mil more  
are daily expected ) which examine  
all vessels common &#x27;and going out  
of this port, and enhr detain of  
release them, according as theii  
value excites the cupidity ot the  
cruize rs.  
This degrading state of our bar-&#x27;  
bor, has lu ccssaritv raised the pre­  
mium of Insurance, thus forcing  
additional sums from the pok ;ts  
of our citizens, has advanced the  
price of tveri- corom:ditv, .and  
created a distressing stagnation ot  
our exports ; for ihe merchants,  
not receiving thejir g ods irom a­  
broad, are incapacitat; d from pur­  
chasing the produce of the country.  
Among these deplorable effects ol  
the cicicnceless unci hunii.iating j  
condition ot our commerce, muy  
be moreover enumerate 1, ilk im­  
mense loss of duties ; those on the  
sdYip Two liends a one, b;ing es­  
timated by the Collector at 45,O00  
dollars, &#x27; -  
Your Memorialists have the best  
reasons for believing that this ear y  
success, experienced bv these  
French privateers, wiUimmectiate­  
ly al ure others iu sw.irms to our  
coasts and bar, to the total ruin ol  
private mercantile concerns, and  
the most fatal &quot;defalcation of ihe&#x27;i  
public revenue: . Your memorial-j  
ists have no leas ground for appre­

\MORtAL of the President if  
tors of the South Carolina  
re Company, and of thr M,v­  
--&#x27;, and other:; interested i  
tree f the city of ChairU r  
TFIH.I.Y SHF.WFTH :  
HAT your memorialists  
fleeted by tire recent capture, at  
the very entrance of this port,  
mericanship Jh&#x27;iends, by a French  
privateer. This event has excited ;,­  
mong all classes of citizens the strong­  
est sensations, not only because  
ship was captured without anjr colour of  
pretence, within sight of lane!,  
cause she is our only regular London  
Kle.r, and had on board a full supply  
pring and summer goods. The  
sand anxiety occasioned be th &#x27;*c  
umstane.es, are greatly enhanced  
1 our having been hitherto deprived  
ur spring supplies, anel from &#x27;no  
&gt;ationof the consequences justly  
be apprehended from a Continuance of  
similar outrages, should neit the most  
prompt anel effectual measures be- adopt­  
ed for the protection and security of  
our commercial interests.  
Your memorialists are authorised to  
add (although the fact be not detailed  
in the Protest) that it appears from un­  
doubted authority, that the magnitude  
of the prize was the sole inducement to  
the above-mentioned capture, the ■  
tors having said that they would re  
the Two Friends, in the event of their  
falling in with&#x27; any other valuable prize,  
which might be more worthy their no­  
tice.  
This most extraordinary capture, in  
direct violation eif evur treaty with  
France, (as appears by the accemapani -  
ing documents) has already b  
lowed by events no les&lt;- alarming—our  
harbor, being at this moment complete­  
ly blockaded by three French priva­  
teers (and more are daily expected)  
which examine all vessels coming in  
and going out of tins port, and either  
detain or release them, according  
their value excites the cupidity of tiie  
■uizers.  
This degrading state of our barber  
s necessarily raised the premium of  
insurance, thus forcing additn rial sums  
I the pockets of our citfcai&#x27;.s—has

duce of the country. Among these, de­  
plorable effects ot the defenceless and  
humiliating cone&quot;&#x27;.&#x27;.ion ot our commerce,  
may be moreover enumerated the im­  
mense loss of duties—those on the ship  
Two Friends alone, being estimated by  
the Collector at 45,000 deillars.  
Your memorialists have the best rea­  
sons for believing that this early success,  
experienced by these French private ers  
will immediately allure others in swarms  
to our coasts anel bar, to the total ruin  
cf private mercantile concerns, and the  
most fatal defalcation of the public re­  
venue : Your memorialists have no less  
ground for apprehending that British  
cruizers, availinng themselves of the  
absence of domestic protection, will,  
under the colour of expelling the j  
French, assume and occupy their;  
ground, and either retain us in the same ■  
degraded state, barrassing e&gt;ur vessels &gt;  
by searches and detentions, or subject &lt;  
us to the disgraceful anel mortifying e&gt;b- j  
fig itionsof gratitude for alien succour ■  
and relief.  
Your memorialists are the more a- &#x27;  
farmed at these depredations, because j  
much valuable property is still expected |  
this summer, from other quarters than j  
London} and considerable importations &#x27;  
will be looked for in the fall ; end  
should there not be an early and effec- j  
toil check to these should  
our fall importations be also interrupted,  
the calamities of the last year, produc- :  
ed by the hurricane and other causes,  
in which this city has so largely partici­  
f :t .;, would be aggravated to such an j  
extent as to eventuate in general ruin, ,  
and these great alarms and apprehen- ;  
sions of your memorialists, are height- ;  
coed by the well known circumstance,&#x27;  
of many of the cruizers which infest j  
our shores, belonging to St. J ago de j  
Cuba and Barracoa, in which recepta­  
cles our vessels and their cargoes, with I  
»he knowledge ofthe government of.  
Cuba, arc instantly sold, without even -  
the formality ed a trial, or any condem­  
nation whatever, thereby precluding c- ■  
very future probability of redress.  
Your memorialists avail themselves  
of this occasion to notice a late decision  
of the district court within this state,  
grounded on an act of Congress, where- j  
by the territorial jurisdiction of the  
United States is limited to the short dis­  
tance of three miles, or a marine  
league from the coasts or shores, which,  
by the said court, is construed to mean  
three miles from the land, consequently  
the middle channel of our bar, being  
more than three miles distant from the.  
nearest land, is pronounced, by judicial  
authority, to be without the jurisdiction  
of the United States ! The very en­  
trance of our harbour, in full sight of the  
city where vessels are frequently obligetl  
to anchor while waiting for a tide, and  
-with a pilot on board, is, by our own  
tribunals, acknowledged to be without  
the protection of our government 1 ! 1  
Your memorialists refrain from  
commenting on the pernicious effects of  
a system of policy so pregnant with dis­  
honor and ruin to the trade anel naviga­  
tion of the Union at. large, but more  
particularly to those of Charleston,  
from the geography of whose shores and  
lieculiar local situation eif whose bar  
and harbour,, every vessel, in her in­  
gress and egress, is thus subjected to  
search, detention or seizure. We con­  
tent ourselves with a bare statement of  
the above grievance, superadded to so  
many others; not doubting that tiie Pre­  
sident will take the same into consider­  
ation, and being duly impressed with  
tiie necessity eif some early remedial  
arrangement, either of a legislative or  
bplomatic nature, will recur to such as  
may appear conducive to the desired  
en;l&quot;.  
Your memorialists having thus exhi­  
bited but an imperfect view of the ru­  
inous, unprotected anel degraded situa­  
tion, rely with confidence on the prompt  
interposition of the President to obtain  
by representations to the minister of  
France anel Spain, (in the event of the  
I Friends being carried into a Spa­  
nish port) restitution of the saiel ship  
mid her cargo, and to cause a stop to  
be put to further spoliations. And your  
memorialists further most earnestly so­  
licit some immediate anel effectual na- &#x27;  
val protection for our harbour anel  
chores, together with such either mea­  
sures as the national councils, in their  
wisdom, may deem expedient, as well  
for prevention of the renewal of ,  
outrages we have sustained, as for the  
the permanent safety and protec­  
tion of our commercial and navigating  
rights and interests. ,

State of the United States.  
  
| The MEMORIAL of the President and Directors  
of the South-Carolina Insurance Company, and of  
the merchants, and others interested in the Com-  
merce of the city of Charleston,  
  
Respectfully Sheweth,  
  
That yowr memorialists are deeply affected by  
the recent capture, at the very entrance of this port,  
of the American ship 7wo Friends, by a French pri-  
vateer. This event has excited among all classes of  
citizens the strongest sensations, not only because  
_ the said ship was captured without any color of pre-  
tence, within sight of land but because she is our on-  
| ly regular London trader, and had on board a full  
supply ot spring and summer goods. The distress  
and anxiety occasioned by these circumstances, are  
greatly enhanced from our haying been hitherto de-  
prived of our spring supplies, and from an antici-  
pation of the consequence justly to be apprehended  
from a continuance of similar outrages should net  
the mest prompt and effectual measures be adopted  
for the protection and security of our commercial  
interests.  
  
Your Memorialists are authorised to add (altho’  
the fact be not detailed im the protest) thgt it ap-  
  
ears from undoubted authority, that the magnitude  
Ae the prize was the sole inducement to the above-  
mentioned capture, the captors having said that  
ety would release the Two Friends, in the event  
of their failing in with any other valuable prize,  
which might he more worthy their notice.  
  
This most extraordinary capture, in direct viola-  
tion of our treaty with France, (as appears by the  
accompanying documents)has already been followed  
by events no less alarming—our harbor being at this  
moment completely blockaded by three French pri-  
  
  
  
  
  
vateers, (and more are daily expected) which ex-  
amine all vessels coming in and going out of this  
port and either detain or release them, according as  
their value excites the cupidity of the crwizers.  
  
This degrading state of our harbor has necessari-  
ly raised the premium of insurance, thus forcing ad-  
ditional sums from the pockets of our citizens—has  
advanced the prices of every commodity, and crea-  
ted a distressing stagnation of our exports; for the  
merchants, not receiving their goods from abroad,  
are incapacitated from purchasing ne of  
the country. Ameng these deplorable effects of the  
,defenceless and humiliating condition of our com-  
merce, may be moreover enumerated the immense  
| loss of duties—those of the ship 2a Friends alone,  
| being estimated by the Collector, at 45,000 dollars.  
  
Your meimorialists have the best reasons for be-  
lieving that the early success. experienced by these  
French privateers, will immediately allure others in  
  
swarms to our coasts and bar, to the total ruin of  
private mercantile concerns, and the most fatal de-  
falcation of the public revenue: Your memorialists  
have no less ground for appreheoding that British  
cruizers, availing themselves of the absence of do-  
i; mestic protection, will, under the color of expelling  
  
the French, assume and occupy their ground, and  
either retain us in the same degraded state, harras-  
sing onr vessels by searches and detentions, or swb-  
ject us to the disgraceful and mortifying ebligations  
of gratitude, for alien succor and relief.  
  
Your memorialists are the more alarmed at these  
depredations, because much valuable property is still  
expected this summer, from other quarters than  
London, and considerable importations will be look-  
ed for in the fall, for our winter supplies; and should  
  
  
  
  
  
there not be an early and effectual check to these  
  
terested inthe commerce of the city of Charleston ;  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
has so largely pert west be aggravated to  
such an extent as to eyentuare in rain—and  
  
  
  
these great alarms and of your me-  
morialists, are hes known civcum  
stance ef  
  
Gurshores,  
belongs 008 nee a oa whieh,  
receptacles our vessels t cargoes, with rhe  
knowledge of the government of Cuba, are ins aur-  
ly sold, without even the formality of a trial, or any  
condemnation whatever, thereby preciuding every  
probability of redress.  
  
Your memorialgts avail themselves of this occa-  
sion, to notice a late decision of the district court  
within this State, grounded on an act of Congress,  
whereby the territorial j of the United  
States is limited to the distance of three mil: s,  
or a marine league, gpealen + poy shores, which,  
by the said court, is to three miles  
from the land ; consequently } channel of  
our bar, being more than three miles: distant from  
the nearestland, is pronounced by judicial aut  
to be without the jurisdiction of the United S  
The very entrance of our harbor, in full sigh  
city, where vessels are frequently obliged te anchor,  
while waiting for a tide, and with a se on board,  
is, by our tribunals, acknowledged to be without the  
protection of our government ! ! !  
  
Your memorialssts refrain from commenting on  
the pernicious effects of a system of policy so prez-  
nant with dishonor and ruin of the trade and navi-  
gation of the union at large, but more particularly to  
these of Charleston, from the geography of whose  
shores, and peculiar situation of whose bar 2nd har-  
bor, every vessel, in her ingress and egress, is thus  
subjected to search, detention orseizure. We con-  
tent ourselves with a bare statement of the above  
grievance, superadded to so many others, not doubt-  
ing that the President will take the same into con-  
sideration, and being duly impressed with the ne-  
cessity of some early remedial arran t, either  
of a legislative or diplomatic nature,will recur to such  
as may appear most conducive to the desired end.  
  
Your memorialists having thus exhibited but an  
imperfect view of their ruinous, unprotected and d--  
graded situation, rely with confidence on the prom:  
interposition of thé President, to obtain, by repre-  
sentations to the minister of France, and of Spair,  
(in the event of the Two Friends being carried into a  
Spanish port) restitucion of the ship and her  
cargo, and to cause a stop to be put to similar spe!i-  
ations. And your memorialists further most earn-  
estly solicit some inimediate and effectual naval pro-  
tection for our harbour and shores, togerher with  
such other measures as the national counseis, ia their  
wisdom may deem expedient, as well for prevention  
of the renewal of the outrages we have sustained,  
as for the permanent safety and protection of our  
commercial and navigating rights and imterests.

alarmed at these depredations, because  
much valuable property is sul] expected this  
summer from other quarters than Lendon,  
and considerabie importations will be looked.  
for in the fall for-our winter supplies ; and  
should there not be an early. and effectual  
check ‘to these aggressions ; should our fall  
jmportations be alsa interrupted, the cala-  
mities of the last year, produced by the hur-  
ricane and otber causes, in, which this city  
has+so largely participated, would be aggra-  
vated to such an extent as to eventuate in  
general rtin—and these great alarms and ap-  
prehensions of your Memoriaiists are height-  
ened by the weif known circumstance of the  
cruizers which infest our shores belonging  
to St. Jago de Cuba and Barracea, in which  
receptacles our vessels and their cargoes,  
with the knowledge, of the government ot  
Cuba, are instantly sold, without even the  
formality of a trial, or any condemmnation  
whatever, thereby precluding every future  
probability of redress,—Your Memorialists  
avail themselyes of this occasion to notice a  
late decision of the District Court within  
this State, grounded on an Act of Congress,  
whereby the territorial’ jurisdiction of the  
United States is limited to the short distance  
of three miles, or a maritime league, from  
the coasts or shoras, which by the said Coutt-  
is construed to mean three miles from the  
Jand, consequently the middle channel of our  
bar being more than three miles distant from  
the nearest land is pronounced, by judicial au-  
thority, to be without the jurisdiction of the  
United States! ‘The very entrance of our har-  
bour, in full sight of the city ,;where vessels are  
frequently obliged to anchor, while waiting  
for a tide, and with a Pilot on board, is, by  
our own Tribunals, acknowledged to be  
without the protection of our government.  
—Your Memorialists refrain, from gom-  
menting on the pernicious etfeets of a sys-  
tem of so. pregnant with dishonour  
and ruin to the trade and navigation of the  
Union at s, but amore. particalarly to  
those of Charleston, from the geography of  
whose shores, and peculiar local situation of  
. bar and r, every vessel. in her  
egress, is thus. subjected to  
tion or seizure. We conten  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Se eR He

ourselves with a bare statement of the above  
grievance, superadded to so many others,  
not doubting that the President will take the  
same. into consideration, and being duly im-  
pressed with the nécessity of some early re-  
media arrangement, either. of a legislative  
or diplomatic nature, will recur to such as  
may appear most, conducive to the desired  
end —Your Memrialists having thus exhi-  
bited but sn impertect view of their ruinous,  
unprotected, and degraded situation, rely  
with conidence.on the prompt interposition  
ot the President, to obtain, by representa-  
tions to the Minister of France, and of Spain  
(in the event of the ‘T&#x27;wo Friends being car-  
ried into a Spanish port), restitution of the  
said ship and her eargo, and to cause a stop  
to be put to similiar spoliations, And your  
Memorialists further most earnestly solicit  
some immediate and effectual naval protec-  
tion for our harbour and shores, together  
with such other measures as the National  
Counciis, in iheir wisdom, may deem expe-  
dient, as well for prevention of. the re-  
newal of the outrages we have sustained, as  
for the permanent. safety and protection of  
our cominercial and navigating nglts and  
interests.-—Charleston, South-Carolina,June,  
22, 1805.
