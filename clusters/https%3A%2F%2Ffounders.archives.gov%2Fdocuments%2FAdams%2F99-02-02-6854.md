Mr Niles,  
Quincy February 13th. 1818  
  
grand Adams  
The American Revolution was not a trifling nor a common Event. It’s Effects and Consequences have already been Awful over a great Part of the whole Globe. And when and Where are they to cease?  
But what do We mean by the American Revolution? Do We mean the American War? The Revolution was effected before the War commenced. The Revolution was in the Minds and Hearts of the People. A Change in their Religious Sentiments of their Duties and Obligations. While the King, and all in Authority under him, were believed to govern, in Justice and Mercy according to the Laws and Constitutions derived to them from the God of Nature, and transmitted to them by their Ancestors— they thought themselves bound to pray for the King and Queen and all the Royal Family, and all the Authority under them, as Ministers ordained of God for their good. But when they Saw those Powers renouncing all the Principles of Authority, and bent up on the destruction of all the Securities of their Lives, Liberties and Properties, they thought it their Duty to pray for the Continental Congress and all the thirteen State Congresses, &amp;c.  
There might be, and there were others, who thought less about Religion and Conscience, but had certain habitual Sentiments of Allegiance And Loyalty derived from their Education; but believing Allegiance and Protection to be reciprocal, when Protection was withdrawn, they thought Allegiance was dissolved  
Another Alteration was common to all. The People of America had been educated in an habitual Affection for England as their Mother-Country; and while they Thought her a kind and tender Mother Parent, (erroneously enough, however, for She never was Such a Mother,) no Affection could be more Sincere. But when they found her a cruel Beldam willing, like Lady Macbeth, to “dash their Brains out,” it is no Wonder if their fillial Affections ceased and were changed into Indignation and horror.  
This radical Change in the Principles, Opinions Sentiments and Affection of the People, was the real American Revolution.  
By what means, this great and important Alteration in the religious, Moral, political and Social Character of the People of thirteen Colonies, all distinct, unconnected and independent of each other, was begun, pursued and accomplished, it is surely interesting to Humanity to investigate, and perpetuate to Posterity.  
To this End it is greatly to be desired that Young Gentlemen of Letters in all the States, especially in the thirteen Original States, would undertake the laborious, but certainly interesting and amusing Task, of Searching and collecting all the Records, Pamphlets, Newspapers and even hand Bills, which in any Way contributed to change the Temper and Views of The People and compose them into an independent Nation.  
The Colonies had grown up under Constitutions of Government, So different, there was so great a Variety of Religions, they were composed of So many different Nations, their Customs, Manners and Habits had So little resemblance, and their Intercourse had been so rare and their Knowledge of each other So imperfect, that to unite them in the Same Principles in Theory and the Same System of Action was certainly a very difficult Enterprize. The compleat Accomplishment of it, in So Short a time and by Such Simple means, was perhaps a Singular Example in the History of Mankind. Thirteen Clocks were made to Strike together; a perfection of Mechanism which no Artist had ever before effected.  
In this Research, the Glorioroles of Individual Gentlemen and of Separate States is of little Consequence. The Means and the Measures are the proper Objects of Investigation. These may be of Use to Posterity, not only in this Nation, but in South America, and all other Countries. They may teach Mankind that Revolutions are no Trifles; that they ought never to be undertaken rashly; nor without deliberate Consideration and Sober Reflection; nor without a Solid, immutable, eternal foundation of Justice and Humanity; nor without a People possesed of Intelligenc, Fortitude and Integrity Sufficient to carry them with Steadiness, Patience, and Perseverance, through all the Vicissitudes of fortune, the fiery Tryals and Melancholly Disasters they may have to encounter.  
The Town of Boston early instituted an annual Oration on the fourth of July, in commemoration of the Principles and Feelings which contributed to produce the Revolution. Many of those Orations I have heard, and all that I could obtain I have read. Much Ingenuity and Eloquence appears upon every Subject, except those Principles and Felings. That of my honest and amiable Neighbour, Josiah Quincy, appeared to me, the most directly to the purpose of the Institution. Those Principles and Feelings ought to be traced back for Two hundred Years, and Sought in the history of the Country from the first Plantations in America. Nor Should the Principles and Feelings of the English and Scotch towards the Colonies, through that whole Period ever be forgotten. The Perpetual discordance between British Principles and Feelings and those of America, the next year after the Suppression of the French Power in America, came to a crisis, and produced an Explosion.  
It was not till After the Annihilation of the French Dominion in America, that any British Ministry had dared to gratify their own Wishes, and the desire of the Nation, by projecting a formal Plan for raising a national Revenue from America by Parliamentary Taxation. The first great manifestation of this design, was by the Order to carry into Strict Executions those Acts of Parliament which were well known by the Appelation of the Acts of Trade, which had lain a dead Letter, unexecuted for half a Century, and Some of them I believe for nearly a whole one.  
This produced, in 1760 and 1761, An Awakening and a Revival of American Principles and Feelings, with an Enthusiasm which went on increasing till in 1775 it burst out in open Violence, Hostility and Fury.  
The Characters, the most conspicuous, the most ardent and influential, in this Revival, from 1760 to 1766, were;—First and Foremost, before all, and above all, James Otis; Nex to him was Oxenbridge Thatcher; next to him Samuel Adams; next to him John Hancock; then Dr Mayhew, then Dr Cooper and his Brother. Of Mr Hancock’s Life, Character, generous Nature, great and disinterested Sacrifices, and important Services if I had forces, I Should be glad to write a Volume. But this I hope will be done by Some younger and abler hand. Mr Thatcher, because his Name and Merits are less known, must not be wholly omitted. This Gentleman was an eminent Barrister at Law, in as large practice as anyone in Boston. There was not a Citizen of that Town more universally beloved for his Learning, Ingenuity, every domestic &amp; Social Virtue, and Conscientious Conduct in every Relation of Life. His Patriotism was as ardent as his Progenitors had been, ancient and illustrious in this Country. Hutchinson often Said “Thatcher was not born a Plebeian, but he was determined to die one.” In May 1763, I believe, he was chosen by the Town of Boston One of their Representatives in the Legislature, a Colleague with Mr Otis, who had been a Member from May 1761, and he continued to be reelected annually till his Death in 1765, when Mr Samuel Adams was elected to fill his place, on the Absence of Mr Otis, then attending the Congress at New York. Thatcher had long been jealous of the unbounded Ambition of Mr Hutchinson, but when he found him not content with the Office of Lieutenant Governor, the Command of the Castle and its Emoluments, of Judge of Probate for the County of Suffolk, a Seat in his Majesty’s Council in the Legislature, his Brother-in-Law Secretary of State by the Kings Commission, a Brother of that Secretary of State a Judge of the Superiour Court and a Member of Council, now in 1760 and 1761, Soliciting and accepting the Office of Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature, he concluded as Mr. Otis did, and as every other enlightened Friend of his Country did, that he Sought that Office with the determined Purpose of determining all Causes in favour of the Ministry at Saint James’s and their Servile Parliament.  
His Indignation against him henceforward, to 1765, when he died, knew no bounds but Truth. I Speak from personal Knowledge and will  For, from 1758 to 1765, I attended every Superiour and  Court in Boston, and recollect not one in which he did not invite me home to Spend several Evenings with him, when he made me converse with him as well as I could on all Subjects of Religion, Morals, Law, Politicks, History, Phylosophy, Belle letters Theology, Mythology, Cosmogeny, Metaphysicks, Lock, Clark, Leibnits, Bolinbroke, Berckley, the Preestablished Harmony of the Universe, the Nature of Matter and Spirit, and the eternal Establishment of Coincidences between their Operations; Fate, foreknowledge, absolute—and we reasoned on Such unfathomable Subjects as high as Milton’s Gentry in Pandemonium; and We undestood them as well as they did, and no better. To such mighty Mysteries he added the News of the day, as the Little Tattle of the Town. But his favourite Subject was Politicks, and the impending threatening System of Parliamentary Taxation and Universal Government over the Colonies. On the Subject he was So anxious and agitated that I have not doubt it occasioned his premature death. From the time when he argued the question of Writts of Assistance to his death, he considered the King, Ministry, Parliament and Nation of Great Britain as determined to now model the Colonies from the Foundation; to annul all their Charters, to constitute them all Royal Governments; to raise a Revenue in America by Parliamentary Taxation; to apply that Revenue to pay the Salaries of Governors, Judges and all other Crown Officers; and after all this, to raise as large a Revenue as they pleased to be applied to National Purposes at the Exchequer in England; and farther to establish Bishops and the whole System of the Church of England, Tythes and all, throughout all British America. This System, he Said, if it was Suffered to prevail would extinguish the Flame of Liberty all over the World; that America would be employed as an Engine to batter down all the miserable remains of Liberty in Great Britain and Ireland, when only any Semblance of it was left in the World. To this System he considered Hutchinson, the Olivers and all their Connections dependants, adherents, Shoelickers—and another Epithet with which I shall not pollute my , to be and entirely devoted. He asserted that they were all engaged, with all the Crown Officers in America and the Understrapors of the Ministry in England, in a deep and treasonable Conspiracy to betray the Liberties of their Country, for their own private personal and family Aggrandisement. His Philippecks against the unprinipled Ambition and Avarice of all of them, but especially of Hutchinson, were unbridled; not only in private, confidential Conversations, but in all Companies and on all Occasions. He gave Hutchinson the Sobriquet of “Summa Polestatis,” and rarely mentioned him but by the Name of “Summa.” His Liberties of Speech were no Secrets to his Enemies. I have Sometimes wondered that they did not throw him over the Barr, as they did Soon afterwards Major Hawley. For they hated him worse than they did James Otis or Samuel Adams, and they feared him more,—because they had no Revenge for a Father’s disappointment of a Seat on the Superiour Bench to impute to him as they did to Otis; and Thatcher’s Character through Life had been So modest, decent, unassuming—his Morals So pure, and his Religion so venerated, that they dared not  attack him. In his Office were educated to the Barr two eminent Characters, the late Judge Lowell and Josiah Quincy, aptly called the Boston Cicero. Mr Thatcher’s frame was Slender, his Constitution delicate. Whether his Physicians overstrained his Vessels with Mercury, when he had the Small Pox by Inoculation at the castle, or whether he was Overplyed by publick Anxieties &amp; Exertions, the Small Pox left him in a Decline from which he never recovered. Not long before his death he Sent for me to commit to my care Some of his Business at the Barr. I asked him Whether he had Seen the Virginia Resolves. “Oh yes.—They are Men! They are noble Spirits! It kills me to think of the Leathargy and Stupidity that prevails here. I long to be out. I will go out. I will go out. I will go into Court, and make a Speech which Shall be read after my death as my dying Testimony against this infernal Tyrany they are bringing upon us.” Seeing the violent Agitation into with it threw him, I changed the subject as Soon as possible, and retired. He had been confined for Some time. Had he been abroad among the People he would have complained So pathetically of the “Lethary and Stupidity that prevailed,” for Town and Country were all Alive; and in August became active enough and Some of the People proceeded to unwarantable Excesses, which were nted by the Patriots than by their Enemies. Mr Thatcher Soon died, deeply lamented by all the Friends of their Country.  
Another Gentleman who had great influence in the Commencement of the Revolution, was Doctor Jonathan Mayhew, a descendant of the ancient Governor of Martha’s Vineyard. This Divine had raised a great Reputation, both in Europe and America by the publication of a Volume of Seven Sermons in the Reign of King George the Second, 1748, and by many other Writings, particularly a Sermon in 1750, on the thirtieth of January, On the Subject of Passive Obedience and Non Resistance, in which the Saintship and Martyrdom of King Charles the first are considered, Seasoned with Witt and Satyre, Superior to any in Swift or Franklin. It was read by every Body, celebrated by Friends, and abused by Enemies. During the Reigns of King George the first and King George the Second, the Reigns of the Stewarts, the Two Jameses, and the two Charleses were in general disgrace in England. In America they had always been held in Abhorrence. The Persecutions and Cruelties Suffered by their Ancestors under those Reigns, had been transmitted by History and Tradition, and Mayhew Seemed to be raised up to revive all their Animosity against Tyranny, in Church and State, and at the Same time to destroy their Bigotry, Fanaticism and Inconsistency or David Hume’s plausible, elegant, facinating and fallacious Apology in which he varnished over the Crimes of the Stewarts had not then appeared. To draw the Character of Mayhew would be to transcribe a dozen Volumes. This transcendant by choices threw all the Weight of his great Fame into the Scale of his Country in 1761, and maintained it there with Zeal and Ardour till his death in 1766. In 1763 Appeared the Controversy between him and Mr Apthorp, Mr Caner, Dr. Johnson and Archbishop Secker on the Charter and Conduct of the Society for propagating the Gospels in foreign Parts. To form a Judgment of the debate I beg leave to refer to a Review of the whole, printed at the time, and written by Samuel Adams, though by Some, very absurdly and erroneously ascribed to Mr Apthorp. If I am not mistaken, it will be found a Model of Candour, Sagacity, Impartiality and close correct Reasoning.  
If any Gentleman Supposes this Controversy to be nothing to the present purpose, he is grossly mistaken. It Spread an Universal Alarm against the Authority of Parliament. It excited a general and just Apprehension that Bishops and Diocesses and Churches, and Priests and Tythes, were to be imposed upon Us by Parliament. It was known that neither King nor Ministry nor Archbishops could appoint Bishops in America without an Act of Parliament; and if Parliament could Tax Us they could establish the Church of England with all its Creeds, Articles, Tests, Ceremonies and Tythes, and prohibit all other Churches as Conventicles and Sepism Shops.  
Nor must Mr Cushing be forgotten. His good sence and Sound Judgment, the Urbanity of his Manners, his universal good Character, his numerous Friends and Connections and his continual intercourse with all Sorts of People, added to his Constant Attachment to the Liberties of his Country, gave him a great and Salutary influence from the beginning in 1760.  
Let me recommend these hints to the Consideration of Mr Wirt, whose Life of Mr Henry I have read with great delight. I think, that after mature investigation, he will be convinced that Mr Henry did not “give the first impulse to the Ball of Independence,” And that Otis, Thatcher, Samuel Adams Mayhew, Hancock, Cushing and thousands of others were labouring for Several Years at the Wheel before the Name of Mr Henry was heard beyond the limits of Virginia.  
If you print this, I will endeavour to Send You Something concerning Samuel Adams, who was destined to a longer Career, and to Add a more conspicuous and, perhaps, a more important Part than any other Man. But his Life would require a Volume. If you decline printing this Letter I pray to return it as Soon as possible to / Sir, your humble Servant  
John Adams

Quinoy, February 13, 1818.  
  
Mr. Nitrs-—The American Revolution was  
not a common event. Its effects and conse-  
quences have already been awful over a yreat  
part of the globe. And when and where are  
they to cease?  
  
But what do we mean by the American Re.-  
volution? Do we mean the American War?  
The Revolution was effected before the War  
commenced. ‘The Revolution was in the  
minds and hearts of the people. A change in  
their religious sentiments, of their duties and  
obligations. While the king, and all in autho-  
rity under him, were believed te govern in jus-  
tice and mercy according to the laws and con-  
stitution derived to them from the God of na-  
ture, and transmitted to them by their ances-  
tors—they thought themselves bound to pray  
for the king and queen and all the royal fami-  
ly, and all in authority under them; as minis-  
ters ordained of God for their good. But when  
they saw those powers renouncing all the prin-  
ciples of authority, and bent upon the destruc-  
tion of all the secu: ities of their lives, liberties  
and properties, they thought it their duty to  
pray for the Continental Congress and all the  
thirteen state congresses, &amp;c.  
  
There might be, and there were others, who  
thought less about religion and conscience, but  
had certain habitual sentiinents of allegiance  
and loyalty derived froin their educations but  
believing allegiance and protection to be reci-  
procal, when protection was withdrawn, they  
thought allegiance was dissolved.  
  
Another alteration was common to all. The  
  
ople of America had been educated in an  
  
iabitual affection for England as their mother-  
country; and while they thought her a kind  
and tender parent, (erroneously enough, How

ever, for she never was such a mother) no af-  
fection could be more sincere. But when they  
found her a cruel Beldam, willing, like lady  
Macbeth, to “dash their brains out,’ it is no  
wonder if their filial affections ceased and  
were changed into indignation and horror.  
  
This redical change in the principles, opi-  
nions, sentiments an , bint of the people,  
wis the real American Revolution.  
  
By what means, this great and important al-  
teration in the religious, moral, political and  
social chavacter of the people of thirteen co-  
lonies, all distinct, uncennected and indepen-  
dent of each other, was begun, pursued and  
accomplished, it is surely interesting to hu-  
inanity to investigate, and perpetuate to pos-  
terity.  
  
&#x27;Fo this end it is greatly to be desired that  
young gentlemen of letters in all the states,  
especially in the thirteen original states, would  
undertake the laborious, but certainly interest-  
ing and amusing task, of searching and col-  
lecting all the records, pamphlets, newspapers,  
and even hand-bills, which in arly way contri-  
buted to change the temper and views of the  
people and compose them into an independent  
nation.  
  
The colonies had grvwn up under constitu-  
tions of government so different, there was so  
great a variety of religions, they were com-  
posed of so many different nations, their cus-  
toms, manners and habits had so little resem-  
blance, and their intercourse had been so rare  
and their knowledge of each other so imper-  
fect, that to unite them in the same principles  
in theory and the same system of action, was  
certainly a very difficult enterprize. ‘The  
complete accomplishment of it, in so short a  
tiine and by such simple means, was perhaps a  
singular example in the history of mankind.—  
Thirteen clocks were made to strike together;  
a perfection of mechanism which no artist had  
ever before effected.  
  
In this research, the glorioroles of individual  
gentlemen and of separate states is of little  
consequence. ‘The MEANS AND THE MEASURES  
are the proper objects of investigation. ‘These  
may be of use to poste:ity, not only in this na-  
ition, but in South \imerica, and all other  
countries. ‘They may teach mankind that re-  
volutions are no trifles; that they ought never  
to he unde taken rashly; nor without delibe-  
rate consideration it sober reflection; nor  
without a solid, immutable, ecernal foundation  
of justice and humanity; nor without a people  
possessed of intelligence, fortitude and inte-  
erity sufficient to carry them with steadiness,  
pitience, and perseverance, through all the  
vicissitudes of fortune, the fiery trials and  
melancholy disasters they may have to encoun-  
ter.  
  
The town of Boston early instituted an an-  
nual oration on the fourth of July, in comme-|  
moration of the principles and feelings which:  
  
contributed to produce the revolution. Man  
of those orations | have heard, and all that  
could obtain [ have read. Much ingenuity and  
eloquence appears upon every subject, except  
those principles and feelings. That of m  
honest and amiable neighbor, Josiah Quincy,  
appeared to me, the most directly to the pur-  
pose of the institution. Those principles  
and feelings ought to be traced back for two  
hundred years, and sought in the history of the  
country trom the first plantations in America.  
Nor should the principles and feelings of the  
English and Scotch towards the colonies,  
through that whole period, ever be forgotten.—  
Lhe perpetual discordance between lWritish  
principles and feelings and those of America,  
the next year after the suppression of the  
French power in America, came toa crisis, and  
produced an explosion.  
  
It was not until after the annibilation of the  
French dominion in America, that any British  
ministry had dared to gratify their own wishes,  
|and the desire of the nation, by projecting a  
formal plan for raising a national revenue  
from America, by parliamentary taxation.—  
The first great manifestation of this design was  
by the ai a to carry into strict executions  
ithose acts of parliament which were well  
|known by the appellation of the acts of trade,  
;which had lain a dead letter, unexecuted for  
half a century, and some of them I believe for  
‘nearly a whole one.  
  
_ ‘This produced, in 1760 and 1761, an awax-  
  
ENING and a REVIVAL of American principles  
and feelings, with an enthusiasin ae te went  
on increasing, till in 1775 it burst out in open  
violence, hostility and fury.  
  
The characters, the most conspicuous, the  
‘most ardentand influential in this revival, from  
1760 to 1766, were—first and foremost, before  
all and above all, James Ovis; next to him was  
‘OxENBRIDGE THaTcHeER; next to him Samvet  
|Apamss; next to him Jonn Hancock; then Dr.  
Mayhew, then Dr. Cooper and his brother.—  
Of Mr. Hancock’s life, character, generous na-  
‘ture, great and disinterested sacrifices, and  
‘important services, if | had forces, { should be  
glad to write a volume. But this Lhope will  
be done by some younger and abler hand. Mr.  
‘Lhatcher, because his name and merits are less  
known, must not be wholly omitted. ‘This  
gentlemen was an eminent barrister at law, in  
as large practice as any onein Boston. There  
was not a citizen of that town more universal-  
  
  
  
  
  
ly beloved for his learning, ingenuity, every  
  
domestic and social virtue, and conscientious  
conduct in every relation of life. His patri-  
  
otism was as ardent as his progenitors had  
‘been ancient and illustrious in this country.—  
Hutchinson often said, “Thatcher was not born  
a Plebeian, but he was determined to die one.”’  
In May 1763, I believe he was chosen by the  
town of Boston one of their representatives in

His indignation against him henceforward,

truth. I speak from personal knowledge.—  
For, from 1758 to 1765, I attended every su-

fect not one in which he did not invite me home  
to spend evenings with him, when he made me  
converse with him as well as I could on all  
subjects of religion, morals, law, politics, his-  
tory, philosophy, belle-letters, theology, my-  
thology, cosmogeny, metaphysicks,—Lock,  
Clark, Leibnits, Bolinbroke, Berckley,—the

of his manners, his universal good character,  
his numerous friends and connections and his  
continual intercourse with all sorts of people,

persecutions and cruelties suffered by their an-  
cestors under those reigns, had been transmit-  
ted by history and tradition, and Mayhew  
seemed to be raised up to revive all their ani-

added the news of the day, and tKe.title tattler &#x27;of  
the town: But his favorite subject, was politics,  
and the impending threatening system of parlia  
mentary taxation and universal government ver  
the colonies. Ori this .&#x27; subject he was so anxious  
and agitated, that I have no. doubt it occasioned his  
premature death. From the time when he urged  
the question :d w rits of assistance, to his death, be  
considered the kino-rministry, parliament and na­  
tion of Great Britaii,s determined, to new model  
the colonies from the foundation ; to annul all their  
charters, to subsitute them all royal governments j  
to raise a revenue in America by parliamentary tax­  
ations ; to apply that revenue wto pay the salaries  
ot governors, judges, and all other crown&#x27; officers ;  
and after all this, to raise as large a revenue as they  
pleased, to be applied to&#x27; national Durooses 4t the  
exchequer in England - and further, ;to establish!  
msnops ana tne whole system ot the Church-of  
England, tythes and all, tin bugiiout all British A­  
mefjc3. This system, he said; if it was suffered to  
prevail, would extinguish the flame of liberty all  
over the world ; that America would, be employed  
as an engine to batter down all the miserable re  
mains ; of liberty in Creat Britain and Ireland,!  
where bnl y any 1 semblance&quot; of it was left in trip  
world. To this-system he considered Hutchinson,  
the - Olivers and all their connections,&quot; dependents,  
adherents, shoeiickers, &amp;c. entirely devoted. He  
asseited,- that thwere all engaged with all the  
crow n officers in-Wn&#x27;e.ica, and the uridei straphers  
of the mi histry in&#x27; England in a deep and trea­  
sonable conspiracy, to betray the libdrties of their  
country, for v their; twn- private, personal, and  
family aggrandisement:- His philippics&quot; against  
the unprincipled ambition and . av.-rrir of all JT  
them, but especially of Hutchinson, .-were un­  
bridled, &#x27; not . only in private Confidcntiar con  
yersations, but in all companies,-and on alK be-.

extract the following character. The  
reader must bear in mind, that the stand-  
ard of intellectual excellence is not yet  
so high in the United States as in Great  
Britain. Ep.]  
  
= NOTHER gentleman, who  
had great influence in the  
commencement of the Revolution,  
was Dr. Jonatnan Maynew, 8  
scendant of the ancient governor  
Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. This divine had  
raised a great reputation both in Eu-  
rope and America, by the publice  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ume of seven sermons, In  
seni oa Rig George the Second,  
1749, and by many other writings ;  
rficularly a sermon in 1750, on the  
30th of January, on the subject of  
ive obedience and non-resistance ;  
io which the saintship and marty rdom  
of King Charles the First, are consi-  
dered, seasoned with wit and satire  
superior to any in Swift or Franklin.  
it was read by every body ; celebrated  
by friends, and abused by enemics.  
During the reigns of King George the  
First and King George the Second,  
the reigns of the Stuarts, the two  
Jameses, and the two Charleses, were  
iu general disgrace in England. In  
America they had always been held  
inabhorrence. ‘The persecutions and  
cruelties suffered by their aucestors  
under those reigns, had been trans-  
mitted by history and tradition, and  
Mayhew seemed to be raised up to  
revive all their animosity against ty-  
ranny, in Church and State, and at  
the same time to destroy their bigotry,  
fanaticism and inconsistency. David  
Hume&#x27;s plausible, elegant, fascinating  
and fallacious apology, in which he  
varnished over the crimes of the  
Stuarts, had not then appeared. To  
draw the character of Mayhew would  
be to transcribe a dozen volumes.  
This transcendant geuius threw all  
the weight of his great fame into the  
seale of his country in 1761, and main-  
tained it there with zeal and ardour  
till his death, in 1766. In 1763 ap-  
peared the controversy between him  
and Mr, Arpthorp, Mr. Caner, Dr.  
Johnson and Archbishop Secker, on  
the character and conduct of the society  
for propagating the gospel in foreign  
parts. ‘To form a judgment of this  
debate, I beg leave to refer to a Review  
of the whole, printed at the time, and  
written by Samuel Adams, though  
by some, ver, absurdly and errone-  
ously, ascribed to Mr. Arpthorp. If  
am not mistaken, it, will be found a  
hodel of candour, sagacity, impar-  
tality and close correct reasoning.  
  
If any gentleman supposes this  
controversy to be nothing to the pre-  
i Purpose, he ts grossly mistaken.  
—, an universal alarm against  
: pen f parliament. It ex-  
general and just apprehen-  
0p that bishops = anaes and  
tobe ie and priests and tithes, were  
  
posed upon us by parliament.  
  
v  
  
Mr. Moore on the Wesleian Penny-a-Week Societies, &amp;c.  
  
207  
  
It was known that neither king, nor  
ministry, nor archbishops, could ap-  
point bishops in America without an  
Act of Parliament; and if Parliament  
could tax us, they could establish the  
Church of England, with all its creeds,  
articles, tests, ceremonies and tithes,  
and prohibit all other churches as  
conventicles and schism shops.”

‘From 1758 to 1765,1 attended every superior and inferior  
court in Boston, and recollect not one in which he did not invite  
me home to spend evenings with him, when he made me con-  
verse with him as well as I could, on all subjects of religion,  
morals, law, politics, history, philosophy, belles lettres, theology,  
mythology, cosmogony, metaphysics ; Locke, Clark, Leibnitz,  
Bolingbroke, Berkley ; the preestablished harmony of the universe,  
the nature of matter and of spirit, and the eternal establishment of  
coincidences between them; fate, foreknowledge absolute; and  
we reasoned on such unfathomable subjects as high as Milton’s  
gentry in pandemonium, and we understood them as well as they  
did and no better. To such mighty mysteries he added the news  
of the day, and the tittle-tattle of the town. But his favorite sub-  
ject was politics, and the impending threatening system of parlia-  
mentary taxation and universal government over the colonies. On  
this subject he was so anxious and agitated, that I have no doubt  
it occasioned his premature death. From the time when he argued  
the question of writs of assistance to his death, he considered the  
king, ministry, parliament, and nation of Great Britain, as deter-  
mined to new model the colonies from the foundation, to annul all  
their charters, to constitute them all royal governments, to raise a  
revenue in America by parliamentary taxation, to apply that reve-  
nue to pay the salaries of governors, judges, and all other crown  
officers, and, after this, to raise as large a revenue as they pleased,  
to be applied to national purposes at the exchequer in England ;  
and, further, to establish bishops, and the whole system of the  
Church of England, tithes and all, throughout all British America.  
This system, he said, if it was suffered to prevail, would extinguish  
the flame of liberty all over the world; that America would be  
employed as an engine to batter down all the miserable remains of  
liberty in Great Britain and Ireland, where only any semblance of  
it was left in the world.’”*

Quincy, February 13, 1818.  
  
Mr. Nites: The American revolution was not a  
common event. Its effects and consequences have  
already been awful over a great part of the globe.  
And when and where are they to cease?  
  
But what do we mean by the American revolu-  
tion? Do we mean the American war? The revo-  
lution was effected before the war commenced. The  
revolution was in the minds and hearts of the peo-  
A change in their religious sentiments of their  
  
duties and obligations. While the king, and all in  
  
‘authority under him, were believed to govern, in  
  
tutions derived to them from the God of nature, and  
transmitted to them by their ancestors—they thought  
themselves bound to pray for the king and queen and  
all the royal family, and all in authority under them,  
as ministers ordained of God for their good. But  
when they saw those powers renouncing all the prin-  
ciples of authority, and bent upon destruction of all  
the securities of their lives, liberties and properties,  
they thought it their duty to pray for the continental  
congress and all the thirteen state congresses, &amp;e.  
  
There might be, and there were others, who  
thought less about religion and conscience, but had  
certain habitual seitiments of allegiance and loyalty  
derived from their education; but believing allegi-  
ance and protection to be reciprocal, when protec-  
tion was withdrawn, they thought allegiance was  
dissolved.  
  
Another alteration was common to all. The peo-  
ple of America had been educated in an habitual  
affection for England as their mother-country; and  
while they thought her a kind and tender parent,  
(erroneously enough, however, for she never was  
such a mother,) no affection could be more sincere.  
But when they found her a cruel Beldam, willing,  
like lady Macbeth, to ‘dash their brains out,” it is  
no wonder if their filial affections ceased and were  
changed into indignation and horror.  
  
This radical change in the principles, opinions, senti-  
ments and affections of the people, was the real American  
revolution.  
  
By what means this great and important altera-  
tion in the religious, moral, political and social cha-  
racter of the people of thirteen colonies, all distinct,  
unconnected and independent of each other, was be-  
gun, pursued and accomplished, it is surely interest-  
ing to humanity to investigate and perpetuate to  
posterity.  
  
To this end it is greatly to be desired that young  
gentlemen of letters in all the states, especially in  
the thirteen uriginal states, would undertake the la-  
borious, but certainly interesting and amusing task,  
of searching and collecting all the records, pam-  
phlets, newspapera, and even handbills, which in  
any way contributed to change the temper and views  
of the people, and compose them into an independent  
nation.  
  
The colonies had grown up under constitutions of  
government, so different, there was so great a varie-  
ty of religions, they were composed of so many dif-  
ferent nations, their customs, manners and habits  
had so little resemblance, and their intercourse had  
been so rare, and their knowledge of each other so  
imperfect, that to unite them in the same principles  
in theory, and the same system of aciion was cer-  
tainly a very difficult enterprize. ‘The complete ac-  
complishment of it in so short atime and by such  
simple means, was perhaps a singular example in  
the history of mankind. Thirteen clocks were made  
to strike together; a perfection of mechanism which  
no artist had ever before effected.  
  
In this research. the glorioroles of individual gen-  
tlemen and of separate states is of little consequence.  
The MEANS AND THE MEASURES are the proper ob-  
jects of investigation. These may be of use to pos-  
terity, not only in this nation, but in South America,  
and all other countries. They may teach mankind  
that revolutions are no trifles; that they ought never  
to be undertaken rashly; nor without deliberate con-  
sideration and sober reflection; nor without a solid,  
immutable, eternal foundation of justice and huma-  
nity; nor without a people possessed of intelligenee,  
fortitude and integrity sufficient to carry them with  
| steadiness, patience, and perseverance, through all  
‘the vicissitudes of fortune, the fiery trials and me-  
lancholy disasters they may have to encount@r.  
  
The town of Boston early instituted an annual  
oration on the fourth of July, in commemoration of  
the principles and feelings which contributed to pro-  
duce the revolution. Many of those orations I have  
heard, and ali that [ could obtain I have read. Much  
ingenuity and eloquence appears upon every subject,  
except those principles and feelings. That of my  
honest and amiable neighbor, Josiah Quincy, appear-  
ed to me, the most directly to the purpose of the in-  
stitution. ‘Those principles and feelings ought to be  
traced back for two hundred years, and sought in the  
history of the country from the first plantations in  
America. Nor should the principles and feelings of  
the English and Scotch towards the colonies, through  
that whole period ever be forgotten. The perpetual  
discordance between British principles and feelings  
and those of America, the next year after the suppres-  
sion of the French power in America, came to a  
crisis, and produced an explosion.  
  
It was not till after the annihilation of the French  
dominion in America, that any British ministry had  
dared to gratify their own wishes, and the desire of  
the nation, by projecting a formal plan for raising a  
national revenue from America by parliamentary

sign, was by the the order to carry into strict execu-  
tions those acts of parliament which were well known  
by the appellation of the acés of trade, which had lain  
a dead ietter, unexecuted for half a century, and  
some of them I believe for nearly a whole one.

in lT2i.  
Qiincev, Febuary 13, 1;1Q­  
Ma. N&#x27;iLF.4 The American Revolution was  
not a common event. Its effects and conse­  
quences have already been awful over a great  
part of tho globe. And when and wh-re are  
they to cease ?  
But what do we mean by the American Rev­  
olution? Do we mean the American war? The  
Revolution was effected before the War com­  
menced. The Revolution was in the min:!s anj  
hearts of the people. A change in their relig­  
ious sentiments, of their duties and uiiiig;sti ons.  
  
While the king and ail iu authority un.;er him  
were believed to govern in justice and mercy  
according to the laws and constitution derived to  
theni from the God of nature, and transmitted  
to them by thrir ancestors they thought them­  
selves bound to pray for the king and qm-en and  
all the royal family, ani all iu authority under  
them; as ministers ordained of God f..r their  
good. Lilt when they saw thos powers renoun­  
cing all tha principles of authority, and bent  
upon the destruction of all the securities of their  
lives, liberties, and prooerties, they thought it  
their duty to pray for the continental congress,  
an I all the thirteen state congresses.  
There might be, and there were others, who  
thought less about rel gion and conseienee. but  
had certain habitual sentiments of allegiance  
and loyaltv derived from their edueation; but  
believing allegiance and protection to be recipro­  
cal, when protection was withdrawn, th-.-y  
thought allegiance was dissolved.  
Another alternative was common to all. The  
people of America had been educated in en ha­  
bitual affection for England a thir moth-r  
country; and while they thought her a kin I and  
tender parent, (erroneously enough however,  
for she never was such a rnothr.) iso affeetio&#x27;i  
could be more sincere. But when thv fun 1  
hera cruel bedlam, willing, like lady Meabeth,  
to &quot;dash their brains out.&quot; it is no wonder if their  
filial affections censed, and were changed into  
indignation and horror.  
This radical chance in the principles, opinions  
sentiments and affections of the people, was the  
real American Revolution.  
Yty what means, this great nn I imnortaut al­  
teration in the religious, moral, political, and so­  
cial character of the people of thirteen colonies,  
all distiect, unconnected, and independent of  
each other, was t.&quot;;jan, pursuer!, nn 1acco.!i?i-h-ed.  
it is surely interesting to humanity to inves  
tigate, and perpetuate to posterity.  
To this end it is greatly to be desired that  
youiiff gentlemen of letters, in all the states es­  
pecially in the tliirtefn original states, would  
undertake, the laborious, but certainly interesting  
and amusing task, of san hing and collecting  
a!l the records, pamphlets, newspapers, nn:! even  
hand-bills, which in any way contributed to  
change the temper and views of the people, at&#x27;d  
compose them into ati indepen lent nation.  
The colonies ha I crown up under constitutions  
of government so different, th-re was . great a  
variety of religion, thev were co&#x27;opos-d of so  
mativ cliff-rent nations, thrir customs, man &#x27;p-ts  
and habits hi! so little tcseniblulieo, n.l tli-ir  
intercourse had beep so rare, and their knowl­  
edge of each other so imperfect, that to unite  
them in the ame principles in theory, an I th  
same system of action , was certainly a ve ry c itti­  
cnlt enterprise. Tho complete accomplishment  
of it, in so short a time, and by such simr.le  
means, was prhaps, a singular example in tho  
history of mankind. Thirteen clocks were made  
to strike together: a perfection of mechanism  
which no artist had ever before ..ffecte i.  
Iu litis research, the gioriondes of individual  
gentlemen and of separate state- of Title conse­  
quence. The r),&#x27;.j;;i and the vfuxu ;v.s are the  
proper objects of investigation. These may be  
of use to posterity, not onlv in this nation, but  
in South America, and all other count ries. Th-&quot;  
may teach mankind, that revolutions are. no tri­  
fles; they ought never be undertaken rashly;  
nor without ie!:herate consideration and sober  
reflect ion; nor without a solid .Immutable, eter­  
nal foundation of justice and humanity; nor with­  
out a peoplu po&#x27;esoed of intelligence, fortitu ie,  
and integrity sufficient to carry them with tead­  
iness. patience, rii.I perseverance, through .a!!  
the viscissitu les of fortune, the fie&#x27;v tri ils an i  
melancholy disasters they may have to encoun­  
ter.The town of Roton carlv intitut&quot;d nn an­  
nual oration on the fourth of July, in commem­  
oration of the principles and feelings. That of  
my honest and amiable neighbor Josiah Quinev;  
appear&quot;.&#x27; to me the most di recti v to the pu&#x27;nose  
of the institution. These principles mid f-e&#x27;ings  
ought to be traced hick for two hno ired year;,  
nnd sought in the hitorv of the rnm-try from  
the first plantations in America. Nor sh-vi&#x27;d the  
principle and feelings of the English and Se-.f. b  
towards the colonies, through that whole period  
ever be forcotten. The penietiid ! iseor ! iar  
between Itritish principles and feelings an 1 &#x27;hnsi  
of America, the next year after the sanpression  
of the Trench power America, came to a  
crisis, and produced an explosion.  
It was not until after the annihilation of tb  
French dominion in America, that any R&#x27;is&#x27;i  
ministry had dared to gratify- their own wishes,  
and the desire of tho nation, bv projecting a for­  
mal plan of raising a national revenue from  
America, bv parliamentary taxation. The first  
manifestation of this design was by the order to  
carrv into strict execution those act of parlia­  
ment which were well known bv the appellation  
of 111? arts of trade, which had lain a ca.i letter,  
unexecuted for half a century, and some of  
them 1 believe for nearly a whole one.  
This produced, in 176D and 17P1,an ntri&#x27;;rvin?  
and a rrrirof of American principles and feeling,  
with an enthusiasm which went on increasing,  
till in 177.J, it burst out iu open violence, hostili­  
ty and fury.  
The characters, the most conspicuous, the  
most ardent and influential, in this revival from  
1760 to I 766, were first and foremost, before all  
and above all, James Otis; next to him was Ox­  
enbridge Thatcher: next to him Samuel Adam;  
next to him John Hancock; then Pr. Mahew,  
then Pr. Cooper and his brother. Of Mr. Han­  
cock&#x27;s life, character, generous nature, greet and  
disinterested sacrifices, and important services, I  
should be gla i to write a volume. Tut this I  
hope will be done by some younger and abler  
baud. Mr. Thatcher, because his name nd  
merits are loss known, must not be whoiiy omit­  
ted. This gentleman was an eminent barrister  
at law, in as large practice as any one ia Eotnn.  
There was not a citizen cf that town more uni­  
versally beloved for his learning, ingenuity, ev­  
ery domestic and social virtue, and conscientious  
conduct iu every relation of life. His patriotism  
was as ardent as bis progenitors had been an­  
cient and illustrious in this country. Hutchin­  
son often said, &quot;Thitcher was not bom a ple­  
hiin.bttt he was determined to die ore&quot; In  
Mav, 176.1. I believe, he was chosen by the town  
of Boston one of their representatives in the leg­  
islature, a colleague of Mr. Otis, who b ti been a  
member from May, 1761, and he continued to be  
re-elected annually till his death in 176.&quot;,  
when Mr. Samuel Adams was elected to fill h.s  
place, in the absence of Mr. Otis, then attending  
the congress at New York. That, her had. long  
been jealous of the unbounded anb:t:o:t cf Mr.  
Hutchinson, but when he found hi.n not content

Mr. Niles The American Revolu&#x27;.ioti was not a  
common event. Its effects and consequences have al­  
ready been awful over a great part of the globe. And  
when and where are they to cease ?  
But what do we mean by the American Revolution ?  
Do we mean the American war? The Revolution was  
fleeted before the War commenced. The Revolution  
was in the minds and hearts of the people. A change  
in their religious sentiments, of their duties and obliga­  
tions. While the king and all in authority under him  
were believed to govern in justice and mercy according  
to the laws and constitution derived to them from the  
God of nature, and transmitted to them by their ances­  
tors they thought themselves bound to pray fur the king  
and queen and all the royal family, and all in authority  
under them ; as ministers ordained of God for their good.  
But when tbey saw those powers renouncing all the  
principles of authority, and bent upon the destruction of  
all I ha securities of their lives, liberties, and properties,  
they thought it their duty to pray for the continental  
Congress, and all the thirteen State Congresses.  
There might be, and there were others, who thought  
lets about religion and conscience, but had certain habit­  
ual sentiments of allegiance and loyalty derived from  
their education ; but believing allegiance and protection  
lo be reciprocal, when protection was withdrawn, they  
thought allegiance was dissolved.  
Another alternative was common to all. The people  
of America had been educated in an habitual Qection  
for EnglanJ as their mother country; and while they  
thought her a kind and tender parent, (erroneously  
enough however, for she never was such a mother,) no  
affection could be more sincere. But when they found  
her a cruel beldam, willing, like lady Mackbeth, to  
&quot;dash their brains out,&quot; it is no wonder if their Glial af­  
fections ceased, and were changed into indignation and  
horror.  
This radical change in the principles, opinions, senti­  
ments and affections of the people, was the real Ameri­  
can Revolution.  
By what means, this great and important alteration in  
the religio, moral, political, and social character of the  
people of thirteen colonies, all distinct, unconnected, and  
independent of each other, was begun, pursued, and ac­  
complished, it is surety interesting to humanity to inves­  
tigate, and perpetuate to posterity.  
To this end it i greatly to be desired that young gen-  
lernet) of letters in all the States, especially in the thir­  
teen nriciial Slates, would undertake the laborious, but  
cert tin ly interesting and amusing task, of searching and  
collecting all the records, pamphlets, newspapers, and  
ren hand-bills, which in any way contributed to change  
the temper and vi ms of the people, and compose them  
into an independent nation.  
The colonies had grown up under constitutions of go­  
vernment so different, there was so great a variety of re­  
ligion, they were eornposed of so many different nations,  
their customs, manners sod habits had so little resem  
blanre, and their intercourse had been so rare, and their  
knowledge of each other so imperfect, that to unite them  
in the same principles in theory, and the same system of  
action, was certainly a very difficult enterprise. The  
complete accomplishment of it, in so short a time, and  
by such simple means, was perhaps, a singular example  
in the history of mankind. Thirteen clocks were made  
to strike together; a perfection in mechanism which no  
artist had ever before effected. , . . &#x27;  
In this research, the gloriorules of individual gentle,  
men and of separate Elates were of little consequents.

The means and the measures are the proper objects of  
investigation. These may be of use to posterity, nt  
only in this nation, but in South America, and all other  
Cohntiie. They may teach mankind, that revolutions  
are no trifles; they ought never to be undertaken rashly;  
nor without deliberate consideration and sober reflection;  
nor without a solid, immutnblc, eternal foundation of  
justice and humanity ; nor without a people possessed of  
intelligence, fortitude, and integrity euliirit-nl to carry  
them with steadiness, patience, and per; vera nee,  
through all the vicissitudes of fortune, the fiery trints and  
melancholy disasters they may have to encounter.  
The town of Coston early instituted nn annual oration  
on4the fourth of July, in com-nemorition of the princi­  
ples and feelings. That of my honest and amiable  
neighbor Josiah Cloinry, appeared tn me I lie rno! &quot;direct­  
ly to the purpose ol the institution. These piiuciples  
and feeling ought to b traced back for two hundred  
years, and sought in the history of the country from the  
first plantation in America. Nr ehoul.l the principles  
and feelings of the English and Scotch toward the colo­  
nies, through that whole period ever be forgotten. The  
perpetual discordance between British principles end  
feelings and those of America, the next year alter the  
suppression of the French power in America, ciune to a  
crisis, and produced an explosion  
It was not until after the annihilation of the Fiench  
dominion in America, that any British ministry had dared  
to gratify their own wishes, and the desire of the nation,  
by projecting a formal plan of raising a national revenue  
from America, by parliamentary tixution. The first  
manifestation of this design was by the order to carry in­  
to strict execution those acts of purlinment which were  
well known by the appellation cf the acts of trade,  
which had lain a dead letter, unexecuted for half a cen­  
tury, and some of them 1 believe für nearly a whole  
one.  
This produced, in 17 GO and 17C1. an awakening and  
rivival of American principles and feelings, with an en­  
thusiasm which went on increasing, till in 1775, it bunt  
out in open violence, hostility and fury.  
The characteis, the most conspicuous, the most ardent  
and influential, in this revival from 1&quot;&quot;60 to J7tKi, were  
first and foremost, before nil and above all, James Otis ;  
next to him was Oxenbridge Thatcher; next to him  
Samuel Adams; next to him John Hancock; then Dr.  
Mayhew, then Dr. Cooper and his brother. Of Mr.  
Hancock&#x27;s life, character, generous nature, great and dis­  
interested nacriSces, and important services, I should be  
glad to write a volume. But this I hope will be done by  
some younger and abler hand. Mr. Thatcher, because  
his name and merits are less known, must not be wholly  
omitted. This gentleman was an eminent barrister at  
law, in as large practice as any one in Boston. There  
was not a citizen of that town more universally beloved  
for his learning, ingenuity, every domestic and social vir­  
tue, and conscientious conduct in evety relation of life.  
His patriotism was as ardent as his progenitors had been  
ancient and illustrious in this country. Hutchinson often  
said, Thatcher was not born a plnhhn. but he was de­  
termined to die one.&quot; In May, 1763, 1 believe, he was  
chosen by the town of Boston one of her representatives  
in the legislature, a cotleage of Mr. Otis, who had been a  
member from May, 1761, and he continued to bere-elected  
annually till his death in 1765, when Mr. Samuel  
Adams was elected to fill his place, in the absence of  
Mr. Otis, then atlendin; the Congress at New York.  
Thatcher hid long been jealous of the unbounded ambi­  
tion of Mr. Hutchinson, bit; when he found him not con­  
tent with the office of lieutenant governor, the command  
of the castle, and its emoluments, of judge of probate for  
the county of Suffolk, seat in his majesty&#x27;s council in  
the legislature, Iiis brother-in-law secretary of state by  
the king&#x27;s commission, a brother of that secretary of stale  
a judge of the supreme court and a member of council,  
now in 1760 and 17(31, soliciting and accepting the ofiice  
of chief justice of the superior court of judicature, he  
concluded, as Mr. Otis did, and as every enlightened  
friend of his country did, that he sought that office with  
the determined purposes of determining all causes in fa­  
vor of the ministry at St. James and their aervile parlia­  
ment.His indignation- agninst him henceforward, to 17G5,  
when he died, knew no bounds but truth. I speak from  
personal knowledge. For, from 175-4 to 1765, 1 attended  
every superior and inferior court in Boston, and recollect  
not one in which he did not iutite me home to spend the  
evenings with him, when hjinade me converse with him  
as well as I could, on all subjects of religion, morals, law,  
politics, history, philosophy, belle-lettres, theology, my­  
thology, cosmogony, metaphysics, Locke, Clark, Leib­  
nitz, liolingbroke, Berkley, the pre-established harmony  
of the universe, the nature of matter and spirit, and the  
eternal establishment of coincidences between their ope­  
ration : fate, fore-knowledge, absolute and we reasoned  
on such unfathomable subjects as high as Milton&#x27;s gentry  
in pandemonium ; and we understood them as well as  
they did, and no better. To such mighty mysteries he  
added the news of the day, and the tittle tattle of the  
town. But his lavorite subject was politics, and the im­  
pending, threatening system of parliamentary taxation,  
and universal government over the colonies. On this  
subject he was so anxious and agitated that I have no  
doubt it occasioned his premature death. From the  
time when he argued the question of writs of assistance,  
to his death, he considered the king, ministry, parliament  
and nation of Great Britain as determined to new model  
the colonies from the foundation; to annul all their char­  
ters, to constitute them all royal governments; to raise a  
revenue in America by parliamentary taxation; to apply  
that revenue to pay the salaries of governors, judges, and  
after all this, to raise as large a revenue as they pleased  
to be applied to national purposes, at the exchequer in  
England: and further, to establish bishops, and the whole  
system of the church of England, tythes ind all, through­  
out all British America. This system, he said, if it was  
suffered to prevail, would extinguish the flame of liberty  
all over the world; that America would be employed  
as an engine lo batter down all the miserable remains  
of liberty in Great Britain and Ireland, where only  
any semblance of it was left in the world. To this  
system he considered Hutchinson, the Olivers, and all  
connexions, dependents, adherents, shoelickera all entire­  
ly devoted. He asserted that they ware all engaged with  
all the crown officers in America, and the understrappers  
of the ministry in England, in a deep and treasonable  
Conspiracy to betray the liberties of their country, for  
their own private, personal, and family aggrandizment.  
His philipics against the unprincipled ambition and ava  
rice of all of them, but especially of Hutchinson, were  
unbridled; not only in private, confidential conversations,  
but in all companies, and on all occasions, he gave Hutch­  
inson the sobriquet of &quot;Summa Potestatis,&quot; and rarely  
mentioned him but by the name of &quot;Summa.&quot; His liber­  
ties of speech were no secrets to his enemies. I have  
sometimes wondered that they did not throw him from  
the bar, as they did soon afterwards major Hawly, for  
they hated him worso than they did James Otis or Sam­  
uel Adams, and tiny feared him more, because they  
had no revenge for a father&#x27;s disappointment of a seat on  
the superior bench, to impute to him, as they did to Otis;  
and Thatcher&#x27;s character through life had been so modest,  
decent, unassuming, his morals so pure, and his religion  
so venerated that they dared not attack him. In his ofiice  
were educated to the bar, two eminent characters, the  
late Judse Lowell, and Joriah Quincy, aptly called the  
Boston Cicero. Air. Thatcher&#x27;s frame was slender, his  
constitution delicate, whether his physicians overstrained  
his vessels with mercury, when he had tha small pox, by  
inoculation at the castle, or whether he was over plyed  
by public anxieties and exertions, the small pox left him  
in a decline from which he never recovered. Not long  
before his death, he sent for me to commit to my care  
some of his business at the bar. I asked him whether  
he had seen the Virginia resolves : &quot;Oh yes they are  
men! They are noble spirits ! It kills meto think of  
the lethargy and stupidity that prevail here. 1 long to be  
out. I will go out. I will go out. I will go into court,  
and make a speech which shall be read after my death,  
as my dying testimony against the infernal tyranny they  
are bringing upon us.&#x27; Seeing the violent agitation into  
which it threw him, I changed the subject as soon as pos­  
sible, and retired. He had been confined for sometime.  
Had he been abroad among the people, he would not have  
complained so pathetically of. the &quot;lethargy and stupidity  
that prevailed,&quot; for town and country were all alive; and  
in August become active enough, and some of the people  
Firoceeded to unwarrantable excesses, which were more  
amented by the patriots, than by their enemies. Mr.  
Thatcher soon died deeply lamented by all the friends  
cf their country.  
Another gentleman who had great influence in the  
commencement of the revolution, was Dr. Jonathan May­  
hew, a descendant of the ancient governor of Martha&#x27;s  
Vineyard. This divine had raised a great reputation,  
both in Europe and America, by the publication of a vol­  
ume of seven sermons in the reign of King George the  
jecond, 174I, and by many other writings; particularly a  
sermon in 1750, on the thirtieth of January, on the sub­  
ject of pasiv obedience and non-resistance, in which  
the saintship and martyrdom of King Charles the first are  
considered, reasoned with wit and satire superior to any  
in Swift or Franklin. It was read by everybody; celebra­  
ted by fiiertds, and abused by enemie&#x27;s. During the reigns  
of King George the first, and King George the second,  
the reigns of I he ätuarts, llio two Jameses and the two  
Charleses were in general disgrace in England. In  
America, tbey had always been held in abhorrence. The  
persecutions and cruelties suffered by their ancestors un­  
der these reigns, had been transmitted by history and tra­  
dition; and Mijrliew teemed tu be raised up to revive all  
their animosity against tyranny, in church and state, and  
at the same time to destroy their bigotry, fanaticism and  
inconsistency. David Hume&#x27;s plausible, elegant, fascina­  
ting, and fallacious apology, in which he varnished over  
the crimes of the Stuarts, had not then appeared. To  
draw the character of Mayhew, would be to transcribe a  
dozen volumes. This tmnscendant funiiis thiew all the  
weight of his great fame into the scale of his country in  
1701, and maintained it there with zeal and ardor till his  
death in 17GG. In 1763 appeared the rontrovesry between  
him and Mr. Apthorp, Mr. Caner, Dr. Johnson and Arch­  
bishop Seeker, on the charter and conduct of the society  
fr propagating the gospel in foreign parts, To form a  
judgment of this debate, I beg leave to refer to a review  
f the whole, printed at the time, and written by Samuel  
Adams, though by some, very absurdly and erroneously,  
ascribed lo Mr. Anthorp. If I am not mistaken, it will  
be found a model of candor, sagacity, impartiality, and  
  
close, correct reasoning.  
  
If any gentleman supposes this controversy to be tioth-,  
ing to the present purpose, he is grossly mistaken, ftj  
spread an universal alarm against the authority .of pallia-  
menu It exerted a general and just apprehension that  
bishops and dioceses, and churches, and priests, and  
tythra, were to be imposed upon us by parliament. It  
was known that neither king nor ministry, nor arrhbish-  
  
ops, coiiiu appoint bishop in America wunoui an act ci  
parliament; and if parliament could lX us, they could  
establish the church of England with all its creeds, arti-  
cles, tests, ceremonies and tythes, and prohibit all other  
churches as conventicles and schism shop.  
JN&#x27;or must Mr. Cushing la forgotten. His good sense  
and sound judgment, the urbanity of his manners, his  
universal good diameter, his numerous friends and con-  
nexions, and his continual intercourse with all sorts of  
people, added to his constant attachment t the liberties  
of his country, gave him a great aud salutary influence

Mr. Wirt, whose life of Mr. Henry I have read with  
great delight. I think that after mature iuvestig; linn he  
will be convinced that Mr. Henry did not &quot;give the first  
impulse to the ball of Independence,&#x27; and that Oils,  
Thatcher, Samuel Adams, Mayhew, Hancock, Cushing,  
and thousands of others were laboring tor several yenrs  
at the wheel, before the name of Mr. Henry was heard  
beyond the limits of Virginia
