Dear Sir,  
New Windsor Mar. 26th 1781  
  
Your favor of the 8th from Carlisle came to me safe, as did the letter alluded to in it; which I should have thanked you for long ’ere this if the public business in which, I am engaged wd yield obedience to my inclination, &amp; indulge me more frequently  
in the gratification of an epistolary &amp; pleasing intercourse with my friends—I received with much pleasure the acct of your recovered health, and sincerely wish it may be of long continuance &amp; much usefulness to yourself &amp; Country.  
We ought not to look back, unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors—&amp; for the purpose of profiting by dear bought experience—To enveigh against things that are past &amp; irremediable, is unpleasing—but to steer clear of the shelves &amp;  
rocks we have struck upon, is the part of wisdom—equally incumbent on political, as other men, who have their own little bark; or that of others to navigate through the intricate paths of life, or the trackless ocean to the haven of secury &amp; rest.  
Our affairs are brought to an awful crisis, that the hand of Providence, I trust, may be more conspicuous in our deliverance. The many remarkable interpositions of the divine governmt in the hours of our deepest distress and darkness, have been too luminous  
to suffer me to doubt the happy Issue of the present contest—but the period for its accomplishmt may be too far distant for a person of my years, whose Morning &amp; Evening hours—and every moment (unoccupied by business)—pants for retirement; &amp; for those domestic &amp;  
rural enjoyments which in my estimation far surpasses the highest pageantry of this world.  
We wait with anxious sollicitude, advices

I am sorry to hear that the Recruiting business in your State is clogged with so many embarrassments—It is perhaps, the greatest of the great evils attending this contest, that States as well as individuals had rather wish well, than act well—had rather see  
a thing done, than do it; or contribute their just proportion to the doing it. This conduct is not only injurious to the common cause but in the end most expensive to themselves—besides the distrusts &amp; jealousies which are sown by such conduct—To expect brick without  
straw, is idle—&amp; yet I am called upon with as much facility to furnish Men &amp; means for every service &amp; every want as if every Iota required of the States had been furnished, &amp; the whole was at my disposal; when the fact is, I am scarcily able to provide a  
garrison for West point, or to feed the Men that are there. This, &amp; ten thousd reasons which I could assign, prove the necessity of something more than recommendatory powers in Congress. if that body is not vested with a controuling power in matters of common concern,  
&amp; for the great purposes of War, I do not scruple to give it, decidedly, is my opinion, that it will be impossible to prosecute it to any good effect—Some States are capitally injured, if not ruin’d by their own exertions and the neglects
