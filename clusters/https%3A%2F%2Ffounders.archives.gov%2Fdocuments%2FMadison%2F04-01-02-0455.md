tance is the high sanction given to a latitude in expounding the Constitution, which seems to break down the landmarks intended by a specification of the powers of Congress; and to substitute for a definite connection between means and ends, a legislative discretion as to the former, to which no practical limit can be assigned. In the great system of political economy, having for its general object, the national welfare, every thing is related immediately or remotely to every other thing; and consequently, a power over any one thing, if not limited by some obvious &amp; precise affinity, may amount to a power over every other. Ends &amp; means may shift their character at the will, and according to the ingenuity of the Legislative body. What is an end in one case may be a means in another; nay, in the same case, may be either an end or a means, at the legislative option. The British Parliament in collecting a revenue from the commerce of America, found no difficulty in calling it either a tax for the regulation of trade, or a regulation of trade with a view to the tax, as it suited the argument or the policy of the moment.  
Is there a Legislative power, in fact, not expressly prohibited by the Constitution, which might not, according to the doctrine of the Court,

specified power.  
Does not the Court also relinquish, by their doctrine, all controul on the Legislative exercise of unconstitutional powers? According to that doctrine, the expediency &amp; constitutionality of means for carrying into effect a specified power, are convertible terms; and Congress are admitted to be judges of the expediency. The Court certainly can not be so; a question, the moment it assumes the character of mere expediency or policy, being evidently beyond the reach of Judicial cognizance.  
It is true the Court are disposed to retain a guardianship of the Constitution agst. legislative encroachments. “Should Congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to the Gover[n]ment, it would be the painful duty of this tribunal to say, that such an act was not the law of the land.” But suppose Congress should, as would doubtless happen, pass unconstitutional laws, not to accomplish objects not entrusted to them, that is, objects not specified in the Constitution but the same laws, as means expedient convenient or conducive to the accomplishment of objects entrusted to the Government; by what handle could the Court take hold of the case? We are told that it was the policy of the old Gover[n]ment of France to grant monopolies, such as that of Tobacco, in order to create funds in particular hands, from which loans could be made to the public; adequate capitalists not being formed in that Country, in the ordinary course of commerce. Were Congress to grant a like monopoly, merely to aggrandize those enjoying it, the Court might consistently say that, this not being an object entrusted to the Gover[n]ment, the grant was unconstitutional. Should Congress however grant the monopoly, according to the French policy, as a means judged by them, to be expedient or conducive to the borrowing of money, which is an object entrusted to them by the Constitution, it seems clear, that the Court adhering to its doctrine, could not interfere without stepping on Legislative ground, to do

rigin in the use made of the species of sovereignty implied in the nature of Government. The specified powers vested in Congress, it is said, are sovereign powers, and that as such they carry with them an unlimited discretion as to the means of executing them. It may surely be remarked that a limited Government may be limited in its sovereignty, as well with respect to the means as to the objects of its powers; and that to give an extent to the former superseding the limits to the latter, is, in effect, to convert a limited into an unlimited Government.
