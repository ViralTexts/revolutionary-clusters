Isaac Coles (formerly a member of Congress for this district &amp;) who pressing me to it, I went to his house about one mile off to dine and to halt a day, for the refreshment of myself and horses; leaving my Servants and them at one of the usually indifferent Taverns at the Ferry that they might give no trouble, or be inconvenient to a private family.

Friday 10th. Left Mrs. Jordans early, &amp; breakfasting at one Johnstons 7 Miles off reached Fredericksburgh after another (short) halt about 3 Oclock &amp; dined and lodged at my Sister Lewis’s.  
The Lands from Mrs. Jordans to Johnsons, and from thence for several miles further are good but not rich afterwards (as you approach nearer to Rappahannock River) they appear to be of a thinner quality &amp; more inclined to black Jacks.  
  
  
  
GW reported to Tobias Lear that he arrived at Fredericksburg “in good health, but with horses much worn down” (GW to Lear, 12 June 1791, CSmH). black jacks: Quercus marilandica, blackjack oak, is adapted to barren and sterile soils.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Saturday 11th. After a dinner with several Gentlemen whom my Sister had envited to dine with me I crossed the Rappahannock &amp; proceeded to Stafford Ct. House where I lodged.  
  
  
  
Sunday 12th. About Sun rise we were off—breakfasted at Dumfries and arrived at Mt. Vn. to D.  
  
From  Monday 13th. until Monday the 27th. (being the day I had appointed to meet the Commissioners under the residence Act, at George town) I remained at home; and spent my time in daily rides to my severl. farms and in receiving  many visits.  
  
  
  
“From” inserted at the beginning of the line.  
  
  
  
  
“in receiving” substituted for “during it had.”  
  
  
  
  
  
Monday 27th. Left Mount Vernon for George town before Six Oclock; and according to appointment met the Commissioners at that place by 9—then  calling together  the Proprietors of the Lands on which the federal City was proposed  to be built who had agreed to cede them on certain conditions at the last meeting I had  with them at this place but from some misconception with respect to the extension of their grants had refused to make conveyances and recapitulating the principles upon which my comns. to them at the former meeting were made and giving some explanations of the present State of matters &amp; the consequences of delay in this business they readily waved their objections &amp; agd. to convey to the utmost ex[t]ent of what was required.  
  
  
  
After their meetings with GW in late March 1791 five of the landholders protested the large size of the proposed Federal City. GW called this meeting today to warn the owners, some of whom were speculators, that there might not be a capital there at all if they did not abide by their agreement (see entry for 30 Mar. 1791).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
“at that place by 9—then” substituted for “and.”  
  
  
  
  
“together” inserted above line.  
  
  
  
  
“proposed” substituted for “intended.”  
  
  
  
  
“I had” added above line.  
  
  
  
  
  
Tuesday 28th. Whilst the Commissioners were engaged in preparing the Deeds to be signed by the subscribers  this afternoon, I went out with Majrs. L’Enfant and Ellicot to take a more perfect view of the ground, in order to decide finally on the spots on which to place the public buildings and to direct how  a line which was to leave out a Spring (commonly known by the name of the Cool Spring) belonging to Majr. Stoddart should be run.  
  
	  
  
the spots: GW accepted L’Enfant’s suggestions for placing the Capitol “on the west end of Jenkins heights which Stand as a pedestal waiting for a monument,” while the president’s house, “situated on that ridge which attracted your attention . . . will see 10 or 12 Miles down the potowmak,” thus “adding to the sumptousness of a palace the convenience of a house and the agreableness of a country seat” (L’Enfant to GW, 22 June 1791, DLC: L’Enfant Papers).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
“to be signed by the subscribers” added in place of “for signing.”  
  
  
  
  
“how” inserted above line.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Wednesday 29th. The Deeds which remained unexecuted yesterday were signed to day and the Dowers of their respective wives  acknowledged according to Law.  
This being  accomplished, I called the Several subscribers together and made known to them the Spots on which I meant to place the buildings for the P. &amp; Executive departments of the Government and for the Legislature of Do. A Plan  was also laid before them of the City in order to convey to them general ideas of the City—but they were told that some deviations from it  would take place—particularly in the diagonal Streets or avenues, which would not be so numerous; and in the removal of the Presidents house more westerly for the advantage of higher ground. They were also told that a Town house, or exchange wd. be placed on some convenient ground between the spots designed for the public buildgs. before mentioned. And it was with much pleasure that a general approbation of the measure seemed to pervade the whole.  
  
  
	  
  
On 22 June 1791 L’Enfant sent GW “the plan here anexed, for the Intended federal city,” regretting that “due to the shortness of time . . . together with the hurry with which I had it drawn” it was neither complete nor entirely accurate (DLC: L’Enfant Papers).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
“of their respective wives” substituted for “of the several different.”  
  
  
  
  
“done” deleted.  
  
  
  
  
“Plan” inserted for “Map.”  
  
  
  
  
“from it” inserted above line.  
  
  
  
  
  
Thursday 30th. The business which brot. me to George town being finished &amp; the Comrs. instructed with respect to the mode of carrying the plan into effect—I set off this morning a little after 4 oclock in the prosecution of my journey towards Philadelphia; and being desirous of seeing the nature of the Country North of Georgetown, and along the upper road, I resolved to pass through Frederick town  in Maryland &amp; York &amp; Lancaster in Pennsylvania &amp; accordingly.

&quot;June 28. Whilst the Commissioners were  
engaged in preparing the deeds to be signed  
by the subscribers this afternoon, I went out  
with Majors L&#x27;Enfant and Ellicott to take a  
more perfect view of the ground, in order to  
decide finally on the spots on which to place  
the public buildings.&quot;  
Washington never lost time. Riding over  
from Georgetown to Capitol Hill, with L&#x27;En­  
fant and Ellicott, he inspected and approved  
the site that I&#x27;Enfant had selected for the  
Capitol. It was on &quot;the west end of Jenkins&#x27;s  
Hill, which.&quot; L Enfant declared, &quot;stands as a  
pedestal waiting for a monument.&quot; And  
on their way back to Georgetown they chose  
as the location for &quot;the President&#x27;s palace,&quot; a  
spot &quot;near Mr. Burns&#x27;s gate.&quot; This was the  
gentleman whose contumacy caused Washing­  
ton to designate him as &quot;the obstinate Mr.  
Burns.&quot;  
The deeds were drawn, but not all executed  
that day, and Washington, true to his re­  
solve, remained at Suter&#x27;s Tavern, though anx­  
ious to go on to t hiladelphia. June 20 the  
diary has this entry;  
The deeds which remained unexecuted yes­  
terday were signed to-day, and the dowers of  
their respective wives acknowledged accord­  
ing to law. This being accomplished, I called  
the several subscribers together and made  
known to them the spots on which I meant to  
place the builaings for the P. and Executive  
departments of the Government, and for the  
Legislature of D- A plan was aiso laid  
before them of the city, in order to convey to  
them general ideas of the city, but they were  
told that some deviations from it would take  
place, particularly in the Giagonal streets or  
avenues, which would not be so numerous, and  
in the removal of the President&#x27;s house more  
westerly for the advantage of higher ground.  
They were also told that a town house, or  
exchange, would be placed on some convenient  
ground between the spots designed for the pub­  
lic buildings before mentioned. And it was  
with much pleasure that a general approba­  
tion of the measure seemed to pervade the  
whole.
