I thank you for your favour of the 29 January, and your Translation of Botta, I have not yet read it—for I received it but yesterday, And reading to me so laborious, and painful an occupation, that it requires a long time—But I cannot refrain from expressing the pleasure I have received from the reasoning of Mr Jay; upon the passage in Botta—“That anteriour to the Revolution there existed in the Colonies a desire of Independence”—There is great ambiguity in the expression,—There existed in the Colonies a desire of Independence—it is time there always existed in the Colonies a desire of Independence of Parliament, in the articles of internal Taxation, and Internal policy; and a very general, if not a universal opinion, that they were Constitutionaly entitled to it, and as general a determination if possible, to maintain, and defend it—but their never existed a desire of Independence of the Crown, or of general regulations of Commerce, for the equal and impartial benefit of all parts of the Empire,—It is true there might be times and circumstances in which an Individual, or few Individuals, might entertain and express a wish, that America was Independent—in all respects, but these were—“rari mantes in gurgite vasto”—For example in one thousand seven hundred and fifty Six, Seven, and eight—The conduct of the British Generals Shirley Braddock, Loudon, Webb, and Abercromby—was so absurd, disastrous, and distructive, that a very general opinion prevailed, that the War was conducted by a mixture of Ignorance—Treachery, and Cowardice,—And some persons wished we had nothing to do with great Britain forever—Of this number I distinctly remember, I was myself one, fully believing that we were able to defend ourselves against the French, and Indians, without any assistance or embarressments from great Britain—In fifty eight, and fifty nine,—when Amherst and Wolf changed the fortune of the War, by a more able and faithfull conduct of it—I again rejoiced in the name of Britain, and should have rejoiced in it, to this day, had not the King and Parliament committed high Treason and Rebellion against America—As soon as they had conquered Canada, and made Peace with France—That there existed a general desire  of Independence of the Crown, in any part of America before the Revolution, is as far from the truth, as the zenith, is from the nadir—That the encroaching disposition, of great Britain was early foreseen by many wise Men, in all the States, would one day attempt to enslave them, by an unlimited submission to Parliament, and rule them with a rod of Iron—  
That this attempt would produce resistance on the part of America, and an awful struggle was also foreseen—but dreaded and deprecated as the greatest Calamity that could befall them—For my own part, their was not a moment during the Revolution, when I would not have given every thing I possessed for a restoration to the State of things before the Contest began, provided we could have had any sufficient security for its continuance—I always dreaded the Revolution as fraught with ruin, to me and my family, and indeed it has been but little better—  
I could entertain you with many little trifling anecdotes, which though familiar, and Vulgar, would indicate the temper, feelings, and forebodings among the people, that I cannot write—  
I see at the end of the Biography, of the Author, that Botta, has written the Biography of John Adams—I never saw, or heard of it before—but if he means me, it must be a curious mass, for he can certainly have no Authentic information on the insignificant subject—  
I am Sir your obliged Friend / and humble Servant

“‘T cannot refrain from expressing the pleasure I have received from the  
reasoning of Mr. Jay upon the passage in Botta, ‘ that anterior to the revolu-  
tion there existed in the colonies a desire of independence.’ ‘There is great  
ambiguity in this expression, ‘ there existed in the colonies a desire of inde-  
  
pendence.’ It is true, there always existed in the colonies a desire of inde-  
  
pendence of parliament in the articles of internal taxation and internal policy,  
and a very general, if not an universal opinion, that they were constitution-  
all entities t to it, and as general a determination, if possible, to maintain and  
defend it; but there never existed a desire of independence of the crown, or  
of general regulations of commerce, for the equal and impartial benefit of all  
parts of the empire. It is true, there might be times and circumstances in  
which an individual or a few individuals might entertain and express a wish,  
that America was independent in all respects ; but these were ‘rari nantes  
in gurgite vasto.’ For example, in one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six,  
seven, and eight, the conduct of the British generals Shirley, Braddock, Lou-  
don, Webb, and Abercrombie, was so absurd, disastrous, and destructive,  
that a very general opinion prevailed that the war was conducted by a mix-  
ture of ignorance, treachery, and cowardice ; and some persons wished we had  
nothing to do with Great Britain for ever. Of this number, I distinctly re-  
member, I was myself one; fully believing that we were able to defend our-  
selves against the French and Indians, without any assistance or embarrass-  
ments from Great Britain. In fifty-eight and fifty-nine, when Amherst and  
Wolfe had changed the fortune of the war, by a more able and faithful con-  
duct of it, I again rejoiced in the name of Briten, and should have rejoiced  
in it to this day, had not the king and parliament committed high treason and  
rebellion against America, as soon as they had conquered Canada and made

Montezillo, February 9 1821.  
  
Dear Sir  
I thank you for your favour of the 29 January, and your Translation  
of Botta. Ihave not yet read it for I received it but yesterday, and reading  
is to me so laborious, and painful an occupation, that it requires a long time.  
But I cannot refrain from expressing the pleasure I have received from the  
reasoning of Mr. Jay, upon the passage from Botta—* That anteriour to the  
Revolution there existed in the Colonies a desire of Independence.” There  
is great ambiguity in the expression, there existed in the Colonies a desire  
of Independence —it is true there always existed in the Colonies a desire of  
Independence of Parliament, in the articles of internal Taxation, and  
Internal policy; and a very general if not a universal opinion, that they  
were Constitutionally entitled to it, and as general a determination if possible,  
to maintain, and defend it—but there never existed a desire of Independence  
of the Crown, or of general regulations of Commerce, for the equal and  
impartial benefit of all parts of the Empire——It is true there might be  
times and circumstances in which an Individual, or few Individuals, might  
entertain and express a wish that America was Independent in all respects,  
but these were “rari nantes in gurgite vasto.” For example in one thousand  
seven hundred and fifty six, seven, and eight, the conduct of the British  
Generals Shirley, Braddock, Loudon, Webb and Abercromby was so absurd,  
disastrous, and distructive, that a very general opinion prevailed that the  
War was conducted by a mixture of Ignorance, Treachery and Cowardice,  
and some persons wished we had nothing to do with Great Britain for ever.  
Of this number I distinctly remember, I was myself one, fully believing  
that we were able to defend ourselves against the French and Indians,  
without any assistance or embarrassment from Great Britain. In fifty eight  
and fifty nine, when Amherst and Wolfe changed the fortune of the War,  
by a more able and faithful conduct of it, I again rejoiced inthe name of  
Britain, and should have rejoiced in it, to this day, had not the King and  
Parliament committed high Treason and Rebellion against America as soon  
as they had conquered Canada, and made Peace with France. ‘That there  
existed a general desire of Independence of the Crown in any part of  
  
  
  
  
  
330 Sketch of Joseph P. Martin. [July,  
  
America before the Revolution, is as far from the truth, as the Zenith is  
from the Nadir. That the encroaching disposition of Great Britain was  
early foreseen by many wise men, in all the States, would one day attempt  
to enslave them, by an unlimited submission to Parliament, and rule them  
with a rod of Iron; that this attempt would produce resistance on the part of  
America, and an awful struggle was also foreseen but dreaded and deprecated  
as the greatest Calamity that could befal them. For my own part, there  
was not a moment during the Revolution, when I would not have given  
every thing I possessed for a restoration to the State of things before the  
Contest began, provided we could have had any sufficient security for its  
continuance. I always dreaded the Revolution as fraught with ruin, to me  
and my family, and indeed it has been but little better. I could entertain  
you with many little trifling anecdotes which though familiar and vulgar,  
would indicate the temper, feelings, and forebodings among the people, that  
I cannot write.  
  
I see at the end of the Biography, of the Author, that Botta has written  
the Biography of John Adams.—I never saw, or heard of it before, but if  
he means me, it must be a curious mess, for he can certainly have no  
authentic information on the very insignificant subject.  
  
I am Sir, Your obliged friend  
  
George Alexander Otis, Esq’ and humble servant,  
  
JOHN ADAMS
