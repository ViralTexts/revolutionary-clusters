 General Warren knew that at th in those times I had much more of the Confidence of Congress and of all the most intelligent and disinterested People in America who had any Access to the Secret of affairs, than Franklin. Congress had Seen Franklin and me together before them above a year i.e. from May 1775 to the Autumn of 1776. They had Seen me active and alert in every branch of Business, both in the House and on Committees, constantly proposing Measures, Supporting those I approved when moved by others, opposing Such as I disapproved, discussing and arguing on every question: on the contrary they had seen Franklin from day to day Sitting in Silence, a great part of his time fast asleep in his Chair. He was employed on Committees more in compliance with the Prejudices of the People in Europe and America, than for any Use he was of or any Service he performed.
