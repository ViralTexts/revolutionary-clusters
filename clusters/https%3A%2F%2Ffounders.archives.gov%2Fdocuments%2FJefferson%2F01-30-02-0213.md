Logan was the seccond Son of Shikéllemus, a celebrated Chieff of the Cajuga Nation. This Chieff, on account of his attachment to the English Government was of great service to the Country. Having the confidence of all the 6 Nations, as well as that of the English, he was very useful in settling disputes &amp;c &amp;c. He was highly esteemed by Conrad Weisser Esqr. (an Officer for Government in the Indian Department) with whoom he acted conjunctly; &amp; was faithful unto his Death. His residence was at Shamokin, where he took great delight in acts of hospitality to such of the White People, whose Business led them that Way—His Name &amp; fame was so high on record: that Count Zinzendorf, when in this Country in 1742, became desirous of seeing him, &amp; actually visited him at his House in Shamokin.  
About the Year 1772 Logan was introduced to me by an Indian friend, as Son to the late reputable Chieff Shikellemus—&amp; as a friend to the White People. In the course of conversation, I thought him a Man of superior talents, than Indians generally were. The subject turning on vice &amp; immorality, he confessed his too great share of this, especially his fondness of Liquor—He exclaimed against the White People, for imposing Liquors upon the Indians—He otherwise admired their ingenuity—spoke of Gentlemen; but observed, the Indians unfortunably had but seldom these as their Neighbours &amp;c. He spoke of his friendship to the White People—wished always to be a Neighbour to them—intended to settle somewhere on Ohio below big Beaver—was, (to the best of my recollection) then encamped at the Mouth of this River, (Beaver)—urged me to pay him a Visit &amp;c. Note. I was then, living at the Moravian-Town on this River, in the Neighbourhood of Cuskuskee.  In Apr. 1773, while on my passage down the Ohio for Muskingum: I called at Logan’s Settlement, where I recieved evry civility I could expect from such of the family as were at home.  
Indian reports concerning Logan, after the Death of his family ran to this: that he exerted himself during the Shawnee War, (then so called) to take all the revenge he could, declaring he had lost all confidence to the White People—At the time of Negociation, he declared his reluctance in laying down the Hatchet, not having (in his Opinion) yet taken ample Sattisfaction—Yet, for the sake of the Nation, he would do it. His expressions from time to time, denoted a deep Melancholy. Life, (said he) had become a Torment to him—He knew no more what pleasure was—He thought it had been better, if he had never existed. &amp;c &amp;c. Report further stated: that he became in some measure delirious—declared he would kill himself—went to Detroit—drank very freely &amp; did not seem to care what he did; &amp; what became of himself. In this condition he left Detroit, &amp; on his way between that place and Miami, was murdered. In Oct. 1781, (while as Prisoner on my way to Detroit,) I was shown the spot where this shall have happened.

“ Logan was the second son of SH1kELLEMvs, a celebrated chief  
of the Cayuga nation. This chief, on account of his attachment to  
the English government, was of great service to the country ; having  
the confidence of all the Six Nations, as well as that of the English,  
he was very useful in settling disputes, &amp;c. &amp;c. He was highly  
esteemed by Conrad Weisser, Esq. (an officer for government in the  
Indian department,) with whom he acted conjunctly, and was faith-  
ful unto his death. His residence was at Shamokin, where he took  
great delight in acts of hospitality to such of the white people whose  
business led them that way. His name and fame were so high on  
record, that count Zinzendorf, when in this country, in 1742, became  
desirous of seeing him, and actually visited him at his house in Sha-  
mokin. About the year 1772, Logan was introduced to me, by an  
Indian friend, as son to the late reputable chief Shikellemus, and as a  
friend to the white people. In the course of conversation, I thought  
him a man of superior talents than Indians generally were. The  
subject turning on vice and immorality, he confessed his too great  
share of this, especially his fondness for liquor. He exclaimed  
against the white people for imposing liquors upon the Indians; he  
otherwise admired their ingenuity ; spoke of gentlemen, but observed  
the Indians unfortunately had but few of these as their neighbors, &amp;c.  
He spoke of his friendship to the white people, wished always to be  
a neighbor to them, intended to settle on the Ohio, below Big Bea-  
ver; was (to the best of my recollection) then encamped at the  
mouth of this river, (Beaver,) urged me to pay him a visit, &amp;c.  
Note.—I was then living at the Moravian town on this river, in the  
neighborhood of Cuskuskee. In April, 1773, while on my passage  
down the Ohio for Muskinghum, I called at Logan’s settlement,  
where I received every civility I could expect from such of the fam-  
ily as were at home.  
  
“Indian reports concerning Logan, after the death of his family, ran  
to this; that he exerted himself during the Shawanese war, (then so  
  
  
  
Character of Logan. 23  
  
called) to take all the revenge he could, declaring he had lost all con-  
fidence in the white people. At the time of negotiation, he declared  
his reluctance’in laying down the hatchet, not having (in his opinion)  
yet taken ample satisfaction; yet, for the sake of the nation, he would  
do it. His expressions, from time to tinte, denoted a deep melan-  
choly. Life (said he) had become a torment to him: he knew no  
more what pleasure was: he thought it had been better if he had  
never existed, &amp;c. &amp;c. Report further states, that he became in some  
measure delirious, declared he would kill himself, went to Detroit,  
drank very freely, and did not seem to care what he did, and what  
became of himself. In this condition he left Detroit, and on his way  
between that place and Miami was murdered. In October, 1781,
