Age makes men often over cautious; I am willing to attribute my fears to that cause, but from whatever source they spring, I can not divest my self of an opinion, that the seeds of civil discord are plentifully sown, in very many of the powers given both to the president and congress, and that if the constitution is carried into effect, the States south of potowmac, will be little more than appendages to those to the northward of it. You will say that general charges, are things without force, they are so, but in the present instance, I do not withhold particular observations, because I want them, but that I would not tire your patience, by entering deeply into a subject, before I had heard the reasons which operated in favor of the measures taken. After the meeting of the assembly and hearing from those who had a hand in the work, the reasons that operated with them, in favor of their measures, I will then more at large give you my sentiments, in
