ity both of the people and of their representatives, to a constitutional augmentation of the latter. The peculiarity lies in this, that one branch of the legislature is a representation of citizens; the other of the states: In the former, consequently the larger states will have most weight; in the latter, the advantage will be in favor of the smaller states. From this circumstance it may with certainty be inferred, that the larger states will be strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature in which their influence predominates.

inciples of the constitution.  
It may be alledged, perhaps, that the senate would be prompted by like motives to an adverse coalition; and as their concurrence would be indispensable, the just and constitutional views of the other branch might be defeated. This is the difficulty which has probably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous friends of a numerous representation. Fortunately it is among the difficulties which, existing only in appearance, vanish on a close and accurate inspection. The following reflections will, if I mistake not, be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory on this point.  
Notwithstanding the equal authority which will subsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects, except the originating of money bills, it cannot be doubted that the house composed of the greater number of members, when supported by the more powerful states, and speaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people, will have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of the two houses.  
This advantage must be increased by the consciousness felt by the same side, of being supported in its demands, by right, by reason, and by the constitution; and the consciousness on the opposite side, of contending against the force of all these solemn considerations.  
It is farther to be considered that in the gradation between the smallest and largest states, there are several which, though most likely in general to arrange themselves among the former, are too little removed in extent and population from the latter, to second an opposition to th

mentations mutually conditions of each other; and the senators from all the most growing states will be bound to contend for the latter, by the interest which their states will feel in the former.  
These considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject; and ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been indulged with regard to it. Admitting however, that they should all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller states, or their predominant influence in the councils of the senate; a constitutional and infallible resource still remains with the larger states, by which they will be able at all times to accomplish their just purposes. The house of representatives can not only refuse, but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of government. They in a word hold the purse; that powerful instrument by which we behold in the history of the British constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people, gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government. This power over the purse, may in fact be regarded as the most compleat and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.  
But will not the house of representatives be as much interested as the senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions, and will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or its reputation on the pliancy of the senate? Or if such a trial of firmness between the two branches were hazarded, would not the one be as likely first to yield as the other? These questions will cr

lness of the number proposed. I omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might be found, under present circumstances, in engaging in the federal service, a large number of such characters as the people will probably elect. One observation however, I must be permitted to add on this subject, as claiming in my judgment a very serious attention. It is, that in all legislative assemblies, the greater the number composing them may be, the fewer will be the men who will in fact direct their proceedings. In the first place, the more numerous any assembly may be, of whatever characters composed, the greater is known to be the ascendancy of passion over reason. In the next place, the larger the number, the greater will be the proportion of members of limited information and of weak capacities. Now it is precisely on characters of this description that the eloquence and address of the few are known to act with all their force. In the antient republics, where the whole body of the people assembled in person, a single orator, or an artful statesman, was generally seen to rule with as compleat a sway, as if a sceptre had been placed in his single hands. On the same principle the more multitudinous a representative assembly may be rendered, the more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people. Ignorance will be the dupe of cunning; and passion the slave of sophistry and declamation. The people can never err more than in supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a certain limit, they strengthen the barrier against the government of a few. Experience will forever admonish them that on the contrary, after securing a sufficient number for the purposes of safety, of local information, and of diffusive sympathy with the whole society, they will counteract their own views by every addition to their representatives. The countenance of the government may become more democratic; but the soul that animates it will be more oligarchic. The machine will be enlarged, but the fewer, and often the more secret, will be the springs by which its motions are directed.

the several departments of government could scarcely have

was confined to the single case when the Senate  
should refuse its consent toan apportionment bill  
for raising the number of Representatives of the  
people with the advance of population. Now,a  
sumple reading of the text will convict him of  
error:  
  
** These considerations seem to afford ample security on  
this subject, (namely, a conflict in case of augmentation of  
the number of members of the House of Representatives,)  
and ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and views which  
have been indulged in regard to it. Admitting, however,  
that they should all be insufficient to subdue the unjust  
policy of the smaller State, or their predominant influence  
in the councils of the Senate, a constitutional and infallible  
resource still remains with the larger States, by which they  
will be able at all times to accomplish [what?] their just  
purposes.”’  
  
At what time to accomplish? At all times to  
accomplish their just purposes. Not atane time,  
one particular purpose only, but at all times, all  
their just purposes. Then the House of Repre-  
sentatives may have more than one just purpose.  
If more than one just purpose can be indulged,  
then the provision is a general one, and applies  
to all such just purposes; and of the justice of  
any purpose, as well as of the necessity of resort-  
ing to the extreme remedy to accomplish it, the  
House of Representatives, as a coérdinate branch  
of the Legislature, has equal

following passages :&quot; In all legislative

tho men bo AVIIO Avili, in fact, direct  
thoir j&gt;rocecdings. In the first place,

the larger the uumber, the greater will

Now, it is precisely on characters of  
this description that tho ¡eloquence and  
address of tho few are known to act with  
all their force. In the ancient  
republics where tho whole body of tho  
people assembled in person, a single  
orator, or an artful statesman, was

can never orr more than in supposing  
that in multiplying their

they strengthen tho barrier against the  
government of a few. Experience will for  
ever admonish them, that on the  
contrary, after securing a sufficient  
number for the purposes of safety, of  
local information, or of diffusivo  
sympathy, they will counteract their own  
viows by every addition to their  
representatives. The countenance of the

eason.  
Hamilton returned to this point in a sub­  
sequent article, showing that he deemed it  
of special importance. He again expressed  
a matured opinion, which can hardly be  
contradicted now, in spite of a century of  
&quot;progress.&quot; Read:  
One observation I must be permitted to add  
as claiming, in my judgment, a very serious at­  
tention. It is, that in all legislative assemblies,  
the greater the number composing them may  
be, the fewer will be the men who will in fact  
direct their proceedings. In the first place the  
more numerous any assembly may be, of what­  
ever characters composed, the greater is known  
to be under the ascendency of passion over rea­  
son. In the next place, the larger the number  
the greater will be the proportion of members of  
limited information and of weak capacities.  
Now it is precisely on characters of this de­  
scription that the eloquence and address of the  
few are known to act with all their force.  
The more multitudinous a representative as­  
sembly may be rendered, the more it will par­  
take of the infirmities incident to collective  
meetings of the people. Ignorance will be the  
dupe of cunning, and passion the slave of soph­  
istry and declamation. The people can never  
err more than in supposing that by multiplying  
their representatives beyond a certain limit  
they strengthen the barrier against the govern­  
ment of a few. Experience will forever ad­  
monish them that, on the contrary, after secur­  
ing a sufficient number for the purpoees of  
safety, of local information, and of defnsive  
sympathy with the whole society, they will  
counteract their own views by every addition  
to their representatives. The countenance of  
the Government may become more democratic,  
but the soul that animates it will be more  
oligarchic. The machine will be enlarged,  
but the fewer, and often the more secret,  
will be the springs by which its motions are  
directed
