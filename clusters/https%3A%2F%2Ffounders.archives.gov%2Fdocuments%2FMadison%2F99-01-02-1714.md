Sir   
						Department of State May 22d. 1807  
					  
					The two last letters received from you were of Decr. 24. and Jany 16.  
					The decree of Novr. 21st. communicated in the first had previously reached us, and had excited apprehensions which were repressed only by the inarticulate import of its articles, and the presumption, that it would be executed in a sense not inconsistent  
						with the respect due the Treaty between France and the United States. The explanations given you by the Minister of Marine, were seen by the President with much pleasure, and it only remains to learn that they have been confirmed by the express authority of the Emperor. We  
						are the more anxious for this information as it will fortify the remonstrances which have been presented at London against the British decree of Jany 7th. Should it, contrary to expectation, turn out that the French decree was meant, and is to operate according to the  
						latitude of its terms, you will of course have made the proper representations, grounded as well on the principles of public law, as on the express stipulations of the Convention of 1800. Nothing, besides, could be more preposterous than to blend with an appeal to neutral  
						rights and neutral nations, a gross infraction of the former, and outrage on the sentiments of the latter; unless it be to invite a species of contests on the high seas, in which the adversary has every possible advantage. But on the more probable supposition that the decree  
						will not be unfavorably expounded, it will be still necessary to press on the Frencil Government a dispatch of such orders to their Cruizers in every quarter, as will prevent a construction of the decree favorable to their licencious cupidity. The moment your letter was  
						received the answer of the French Minister of Marine to your note, was communicated to Genl. Turreau, with a call on him to transmit it immediately to the French Governors in the West Indies. This he readily engaged to do. But notwithstanding this precaution, there are proofs  
						that the West India Privateers have, under colour of the Edict, committed depredations which will constitute just claims of redress from their Government.

communicated in the first, had  
previously reached us, and had  
excited apprehensions which  
&#x27; were repressed only by the inar-  
ticulate import of its articles, and  
the presumption that it would be  
executed in a sense not inconsist-  
ent with the respect due the trea-  
ty between France and the Unit-  
ed States. The explanations  
given you by the minister of ma-  
rine were seen by the president  
with much pleasure, and it only  
remains to learn that they have  
been confirmed by the express  
authority of the emperor. We  
are the more anxious for this in-  
formation, as it will fortify the  
remonstrances which have been  
presented at Loncon against the  
British order of January 7th.  
Should it, contrary to expecta-  
tion, turn out that the French de-  
cree was meant, and is to operate  
according to the latitude of its  
terms, you will of course have  
made the proper representations,  
grounded as well on the princi-  
ples of public law, as on the ex-  
press stipulations of the conven-  
tion of 1800. Nothing, besides,  
could be more preposterous than  
to blend with an appeal to neutral  
rights and neutral nations, a gross  
infraction of the former, and out-  
rage on the sentiments of the lat-  
ter; unless it be to invite a spe-  
cies of contest on the high seas,  
in which the adversary has every  
possible advantage. But on the  
more probable supposition that  
the decree will not be unfavora-  
bly expounded, it will be still ne-  
cessary to press on the French  
government a dispatch of such  
orders to their cruisers, in every  
quarter, as will prevent a con-  
struction of the decree favorable  
to their licentious cupidity. The  
  
moment your letter was received,  
the answer of the French minis-  
ter of marine to your note was  
communicated to general Tur-  
reau, with a call on him to trans-  
mit it immediately to the French  
governors in the West Indies.  
This he readily engaged to do.  
But notwithstanding this precau-  
tion, there are proofs that the  
West India privateers have, un-  
der color of the edict, commit-  
ted depredations which will con-  
stitute just claims of redress  
from their government.  
  
Mr. Erving has forwarded a  
Spanish decree also, avowedly  
pursuing the example and the  
views of the French emperor.  
The terms of this decree are  
even more vague, or rather more  
broad, than those of the proto-  
type; and if not speedily recalled  
or corrected, will doubtless ex-  
tend the scene of spoliations al-  
ready begun in that quarter, and  
of course thicken the cloud that  
hangs over the amity of the twe  
nations.

rine to your note was communicated  
to Gen. Turreau, with a call oa him  
to transmit it immediately to tlv  
French governors in the West Indies.  
This he readily engaged to do. But  
notwithstanding this precaution, there  
are proofs that the West India priva­

committed depredations, which will  
constitute just claims of redress from

French emperor. The terms of this  
decree are even more vague, or ra
