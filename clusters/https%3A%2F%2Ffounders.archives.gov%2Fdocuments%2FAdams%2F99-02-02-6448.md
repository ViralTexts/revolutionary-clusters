of the ‘* Mathematical Society, Crispin-street, Spital-fields,” which  
purports to be original, we find it stated to be begun more than ‘ balf  
a century” ago; but it is in fact a whole century, and it is written  
over the door, ‘* instituted in 1719.” Upon the whole, this volume,  
being devoid of the interested calumnies and malignity which dis-  
grace the “ Picture of London,” must be an acceptable present  
to the passing inquirer, or occasional visitor of this yast collection of  
buildings and monuments of human art.
