with a tine or two in acknowledgment of your favor  
of the 18th inst, from New-York instead of a long

I thank you sincerely for the part you acted at  
York respecting C.--y&#x27;s, and befleve with you that  
matters have and will turn out very different to  
what that party expected. G--s&#x27;s has involved  
himself in this letters to me in the most absurd  
contradictions. M.---has brought himself into a  
scrape that he does not know how to get out of  
with a gentleman of this State, and C.a, as you  
know, is sent upon an expedition which all the  
world knew, and the event has proved, was not  
practicable. In a word, I have a good deal of rea­  
son to believe that the machination of this junta  
will recoll upon their own heads, and be a means of  
bringing some matters to light which, by getting  
me out of the way, some of them thought to con-­
