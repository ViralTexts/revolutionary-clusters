To descend to articles of smaller value than these would lead into a minuteness of detail neither necessary nor useful to the present object.  
Our Navigation depending on the same commerce will appear by the following statement of the tonnage of our own vessels, entering in our ports, in one year, from those several nations, and their possessions. This was from Oct. 1789. to Sep. 1790 inclusive, as follows.  
  
  
Spain  
 19,695 tons  
  
  
Portugal  
 23,576  
  
  
France  
116,410  
  
  
Gr. Britain  
 43,580  
  
  
United Netherlds.  
 58,858  
  
  
Denmark  
 14,655  
  
  
Sweden  
    750.  
  
  
Of our Commercial objects, Spain recieves favorably our Salted fish, Wood, Ships, Tar, pitch and turpentine.  
They do not discourage our Rice, Pot and Pearl ash, Salted provisions or Whale oil. But these articles being in small demand at their markets, are carried thither but in a small degree.  
  
Tobacco, Indigo, and Bread grains are not recieved there. Nor are Meals, for their own consumption: but, for the use of their Colonies, Meals were heretofore admitted favourably. Lately, however, we are told that duties of from half a dollar to 2. dollars the barrel are imposed on all foreign flour re-exported to their colonies; the duties being so proportioned to the current price of their own flour, as that both together are to make the constant sum of 9. dollars per barrel.  
Themselves and their colonies are the actual consumers of what they recieve from us.  
Our Navigation is free with the kingdom of Spain; foreign goods being recieved there in our ships on the same conditions as if carried in their own, or in the vessels of the country of

The United Netherlands prohibit our pickled beef and pork, meals and bread of all sorts, and lay a prohibitory duty on spirits distilled from grain.  
All other of our productions are recieved on varied duties, which may be reckoned, on a medium, at about 3. per cent.  
They consume but a small part of what they recieve, and consequently, as to the great mass, they intercept, between us and the consumer, a portion of the value equal to the charges attending an intermediate deposit.  
Foreign goods, except some West India articles are recieved in the vessels of any nation.  
Our Ships may be sold and naturalized there with exceptions of one or two privileges which scarcely lessen their value.

s to Commerce, two methods occur, 1. by friendly arrangements with the several nations with whom these restrictions exist; or 2. by the separate act of our own legislatures for countervailing their effects.  
There can be no doubt but that friendly arrangement is the most eligible. Instead of embarrassing Commerce under piles of regulating laws, duties and prohibitions, could it be relieved from all it’s shackles  
in all parts of the world, could every country be employed in producing that which nature has best fitted it to produce, and each be free to exchange with others mutual surplusses for mutual wants, the greatest mass possible would then be produced of those things which contribute to human life and human happiness; the numbers of mankind would be increased, and their condition bettered. In such a state of things Agriculture would be doubly eligible to us, as to the profits of our labour, it would add the profits of a greater portion of our lands, which must lie idle and unprofitable in proportion as we betake ourselves to arts and manufactures.  
Would even a single nation begin with the U.S. this system of free commerce, it would be adviseable to begin it with that nation; since it is only one by one that it can be extended to all. If the circumstances of either party should render it expedient to levy a revenue by way of impost on commerce, it’s freedom might be modified in that particular by mutual and equivalent measures, preserving it entire in all others.  
Some nations not yet ripe for free commerce in all it’s extent, might still be willing to mollify it’s restrictions and regulations for us, in proportion to the advantages which an intercourse with us might offer. Particularly they may concur with us in reciprocating the duties to be levied on each side, or in compensating any excess of duty by equivalent advantages of another nature. Our commerce is certainly of a character to entitle it to favor in most countries. The commodities we offer are either Necessaries of life; or Materials for manufacture; or convenient subjects of Revenue: and we take in exchange either Manufactures when they have recieved the last finish of art and industry; or mere Luxuries, which we might do without, or furnish to ourselves. Such a Customer may reasonably expect welcome, and friendly treatment every where: a Customer too whose demands, increasing with their wealth and population, must very shortly give full employment to the whole industry of any nation whatever, in any line of supply it may get into the habit of calling for from them.  
But should any nation, contrary to our wishes, suppose it may better find it’s advantage by continuing it’s system of prohibitions, duties and regulations, it behoves us to protect our citizens and their commerce by counter-prohibitions, duties and regulations also. A free commerce is not to be given in exchange for restrictions and vexations: nor is it likely to produce a relaxation of them.  
Our Navigation involves still higher considerations. As a branch of Industry it is valuable; but, as a means of Defence, indispensable.  
It’s value as a branch of Industry is enhanced by the dependance of so many other branches on it. For tho’, in times of peace, other nations may  
carry our produce to market for us (if it be desireable that other nations should carry for us) yet when those nations are at war with each other, if we have not within ourselves the means of transportation, our produce must be exported in belligerent vessels at the increased expence of war freight and insurance, and the articles which will not bear that must perish on our hands.  
But it is as a Means of Defence that our Navigation will admit neither neglect nor forbearance. The position and circumstances of the U.S. leave them nothing to fear on their land-board, and nothing to desire beyond their present rights. But on their Sea-board they are open to injury, and they have there too a Commerce which must be protected. This can only be done by possessing a respectable body of citizen-seamen.   
Were the Ocean, which is the common property of all, open to the industry of all, so that every person and vessel should be free to take employment wherever it could be found, the U.S. would certainly not set the example of appropriating to themselves exclusively any portion of the common stock of occupation. They would rely on the enterprize and activity of their citizens for a due participation of the benefits of the seafaring business, and for keeping the marine class

e who thus put us on the defensive, or others equivalent and better adapted to our circumstances.  
The following principles appear perfectly just; and being founded in reciprocity, can give no cause of complaint.  
  
1. Where a nation imposes high duties on our productions, or prohibits them altogether, it will be proper for us to do the same by theirs; selecting at first those articles of manufacture which we take from them  
in greatest quantity, and which at the same time we could the soonest furnish to ourselves, or obtain from other countries; imposing on them duties, lighter at first, but heavier and heavier afterwards as other channels of supply should open; the proceeds of the duties on such manufactures to be applied to the importation of the manufacturer himself, and in aid of those employed in the same line at home. The oppressions on our agriculture in foreign ports would thus be made the occasion of promoting arts and manufactures at home and of relieving ourselves from a dependance on the councils and conduct of others.  
2. Where a nation refuses to recieve in our vessels any productions but our own, we should refuse to recieve in theirs any but their productions. The bill reported by the committee is well framed to effect this.  
3. Where a nation refuses to consider any vessel as ours which has not been built within the U.S. we should refuse to consider as theirs any vessel not built within their territory.  
4. Where a nation refuses us the carriage of our own productions to certain countries under their subjection, we should refuse to them the carriage of the same productions to the same countrie
