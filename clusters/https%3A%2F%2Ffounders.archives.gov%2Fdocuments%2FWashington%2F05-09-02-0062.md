United States [Philadelphia] October 25th 1791.  
Fellow Citizens of the Senate,and of the House of Representatives.  
  
I meet you, upon the present occasion, with the feelings which are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situation of our common Country, and by a persuasion equally strong, that the labours of the Session, which has just commenced, will, under the guidance of a spirit no less prudent than patriotic, issue in measures, conducive to the stability and increase of national prosperity.  
Numerous as are the Providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments—the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the Husbandman, is too important to escape recollection.  
  
Your own observations, in your respective situations, will have satisfied you of the progressive state of Agriculture—Manufactures—Commerce and Navigation: In tracing their causes, you will have remarked, with particular pleasure, the happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which the constitution and laws of the United States have so eminently contributed: And you will have observed, with no less interest, new and decisive proofs of the increasing reputation and credit of the Nation. But you, nevertheless, cannot fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation, of these circumstances, which will be disclosed, in the several official communications that will be made to you in the course of your deliberations.  
The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed the sum allowed to be subscribed, in a single day, is among the striking and pleasing evidences which present themselves, not only of confidence in the government, but of resource in the community.  
In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and resolutions of the last Session.  
Among the most important of these is the defence and security of the Western Frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles, was a primary wish.  
Accordingly, at the same time that treaties have been provisionally concluded, and other proper means used to attach the wav[er]ing, and to confirm in their friendship, the well-disposed tribes of Indians—effectual measures have been adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible, that a pacification was desired upon terms of moderation and justice.  
These measures having proved unsuccessful, it became necessary to convince the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations. Offensive operations have therefore been directed; to be conducted, however, as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have been crowned with full success, and others are yet depending. The expeditions which have been completed were carried on under the authority, and at the expense of the United States, by the Militia of Kentucky; whose enterprize, intripidity and good conduct, are entitled to peculiar commendation.  
Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes, and considerable numbers of individuals belonging to them  
  
have lately renounced all further opposition, removed from their former situations, and placed themselves under the immediate protection of the United States.  
It is sincerely to be desired, that all need of coertion, in future, may cease; and that an intimate intercourse may succeed; calculated to advance the happiness of the Indians, and to attach them firmly to the United States.  
In order to this, it seems necessary—  
That they should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensation of Justice.  
That the mode of alienating their lands, the main source of discontent and war, should be so defined and regulated, as to obviate imposition, and, as far as may be practicable, controversy concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are made.  
That commerce with them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment towards them, and that such rational experiments should be made, for imparting to them the blessings of civilization, as may, from time to time suit their condition.  
That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate interests with the preservation of peace.  
And—that efficatious provision should be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who, by violating their rights, shall infringe the treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.  
A System corrisponding with the mild principles of religion and philanthropy towards an unenlightened race of men, whose happiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States, would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of sound policy.  
The powers specially vested in me by the Act laying certain duties on distilled spirits, which respect the subdivisions of the Districts into Surveys, the appointment of Officers, and the assignment of compensations, have likewise been carried into effect. In a matter in which both materials and experience were wanting to guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived that there must have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed by the law. It  
  
is hoped that the circumspection which has been used will be found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects; but it is probable, that with a view to the first, in some instances a revision of the provision will be found advisable.  
The impressions with which this law has been received by the community, have been, upon the whole, such as were to be expected among enlightened and well disposed Citizens, from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The novelty, however, of the tax in a considerable part of the United States, and a misconception of some of its provisions, have given occasion in particular places to some degree of discontent. But it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the law. And I entertain a full confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives which arise out of a just sense of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public welfare.  
If there are any circumstances, in the law, which, consistently with its main design, may be so varied as to remove any well intentioned objections, that may happen to exist, it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper variations. It is desirable, on all occasions, to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional and necessary Acts of Government, the fullest evidence of a disposition, as far as may be practicable, to consult the wishes of every part of the community, and to lay the foundations of the public Administration in the affection of the people.  
Pursuant to the authority contained in the several Acts on that subject—a district of ten miles square for the permanent Seat of the Government of the United States, has been fixed, and announced by proclamation, which district will comprehend lands on both sides of the River Potomac, and the towns of Alexandria and George-town. A City has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congress: And as there is a prospect, favored by the rate of sales which have already taken place, of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public buildings, there is every expectation of their due progress.  
The completion of the Census of the Inhabitants, for which provision was made by law, has been duly notified, (excepting one instance, in which the return has been informal; and another, in which it has been omitted or miscarried) and the returns of the officers who were charged with this duty, which will  
  
be laid before you, will give you the pleasing assurance, that the present population of the United States borders on four millions of persons.  
It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of two millions and an half of florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are similar to those of the one last announced, except as to a small reduction of charges. Another on like terms for six millions of florins had been set on foot under circumstances that assured an immediate completion.  
Gentlemen of the Senate.  
Two treaties, which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees, and six nations of Indians, will be laid before you for your consideration and ratification.  
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.  
In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust, you must anticipate with pleasure, that many of the difficulties, necessarily incident to the first arrangements of a new Government, for an extensive Country, have been happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your predecessors in co-operation with the other branch of the legislature. The important objects, which remain to be accomplished, will, I am persuaded, be conducted upon principles equally comprehensive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the general weal.  
The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States, having expired, statements, from the proper department, will, as soon as possible apprize you of the exact result. Enough, however, is already known to afford an assurance that the views of that Act have been substantially fulfilled. The subscription in the domestic debt of the United States has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that debt; affording, at the same time, proof of the general satisfaction of the public creditors with the system which has been proposed to their acceptance, and of the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which they are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States, as far as the provisions of the law have permitted, may be said to be yet more general. The part of the debt of the United States, which remains unsubscribed, will naturally engage your further deliberations.  
It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you,  
  
that the revenues which have been established, promise to be adequate to their objects, and may be permitted, if no unforeseen exigency occurs, to supersede, for the present, the necessity of any new burthens upon our Constituents.  
An object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the current service of the ensuing year, together with such ascertained demands upon the Treasury as require to be immediately discharged, and such casualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public business, for which no specific appropriation may have yet been made; of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you.  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives:  
I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for several objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed any definitive resolution. Their importance will recall them to your attention; and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements of the government will afford you leisure to resume them with advantage.  
There are, however, some of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular mention. These are the Militia—the Post Office and Post Roads—the Mint—Weights and measures—aprovision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States.  
The first is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed in reference to the national security, to the satisfaction of the community, or to the preservation of Order. In connection with this, the establishment of competent Magazines &amp; Arsenals, and the fortification of such places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable, naturally present themselves to consideration. The safety of the United States, under Divine protection, ought to rest on the basis of systematic and solid arrangements; exposed as little as possible to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances.  
The importance of the Post Office and Post Roads, on a plan sufficiently liberal and comprehensive, as they respect the expedition, safety and facility of communication, is increased by the instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government; which, while it contributes to the security of the people, serves also to guard them against the effects of mis-representation and misconception. The establishment  
  
of additional cross-Posts, especially to some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union, cannot fail to be of material utility.  
The disorders in the existing currency, and especially the scarcity of small change, a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes, strongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered into concerning the establishment of a Mint. Measures have been taken pursuant to that resolution for procuring some of the most necessary artists, together with the requisite Apparatus.  
An uniformity in the weights and measures of the Country is among the important objects submitted to you by the Constitution, and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the public Councils than conducive to the public convenience.  
A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of burthening our Citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the principal but in a limited proportion, no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the public of its right.  
  
Go: Washington

Prefident’s Speech. 611  
  
Your own obfervations, in your refpeétive fituations, will have fatisfied  
you of the progrefiive ftate of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, and  
navigation : In tracing their cautes, you will have remarked, with particular  
pleafure, the happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as  
private, to which the conftitution and laws of the United States have fo  
eminently contributed : And you will nave obferved, with no lefs intereft,  
new and decifive proofs of the increaling reputation and credit of the na-  
tion. But you neverthelefs cannot fail to derive fatisfa€tion from the con-  
fymation of thefe circumflances, which will be difclofed, in the feveral  
oficial communications, that will be made to you in the courfe of your des  
|iberations.  
  
The rapid fub{criptions to the Bank of the United States, which com-  
pleted the fum allowed to be iubfcribed, in a fingle day, is among the  
itriking and pleafing evidences which prefent themfelves, not only of con-  
fidence in the government, but of refource in the community,  
  
In the interval of your recefs, due attention has been paid to the execu-  
tion of the different objects which were {pecially provided for by the laws  
and refolutions of the lait feflion.  
  
Among the moft important of thefe, is the defence and fecurity of the  
Weftern Frontiers. ‘To accomplifh it on the moft humane principles, was  
a primary with.  
  
Accordingly, at the fame time, that treaties have been provifionally con-  
cluded, and other proper means ufed to attach the wavering, and to con-  
firm in their friendfhip, the well-difpofed tribes of Indians—effefiual mea-  
fures have been adopied to make thofe of a hoftile defcription fenfible, that a  
pacification was defired upon terms of moderation and juftice.  
  
Thefe meafurcs having proved unfuccefsful, it became neceflary to con-  
vince the refraétory of the power of the United States to punifh their de-  
predations. Offenfive op¢rations have therefore been directed ; to be con-  
duéted, however, as confiftently as poflible with the dittates of humanity.  
Some of thefe have been crowned with full fuccefs, and others are yet de-  
pending. The expeditions which have been completed, were carried on  
under the authority, and at the expence of the United States, by the Militia  
of Kentucky ; whofe enterprife, intrepidity and good conduct, are entitled  
to peculiar commendation.  
  
Overtures of peace are ftill continued to the deluded tribes, and confider-  
able numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all  
further oppofition, removed from their former fituations, and placed them-  
felves under the immediate protection of the United States.  
  
It is fincerely to be defired, that all need of coertion in future may ceale,  
and that an iatimate intercourfe may fucceed, calculated to advance the  
happinefs of the Indians, and to attach them firmly to the United States.  
  
In order to this it feems neceflary, ‘That they fhould experience the be-  
nefits of an impartial difpenfation of juttice :— That the mode of alienet-  
ing their lands (the main fource of difcontent and war) fhould be fodehned  
and regulated as to obviate impofition, and as far as may be pratticable,  
controverfy concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are  
made:—That commerce with them fhould be promoted, under regulations  
tending to fecure an equitable deportment towards them ; and that {uch ra-  
tonal experiments fhould be made for impart

which the Indians have been long accuftomed, for uniting their immediate  
interefts with the prefervation of peace :—And, that efficacious provifion  
fhould be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all thofe who, by vio-  
Jating their rights, fhall infringe the treaties and endanger the peace of the  
Union.  
  
A fyitem correfponding with the mild principles of religion and philan.  
thropy towards an unenlightened race of men, whofe happinefs materially  
depends on the conduét of the United States, would be as honourable to  
the national chara¢ter, as conformable to the di€tates of found policy.  
  
The power fpecially vefted in me by the aét laying certain duties on dif.  
tilled {pirits, which refpects the fub-divifions of the diftri&amp;ts into furveys,  
the appointment of officers, and the aflignment of compenfations, have  
likewife been carried into effeét. In a matter in which both materials and  
experience were wanting to guide the calculation, it will be ready conceiy-  
ed, that there muft have been difficulty in fuch an adjaftment of the rates  
of compenfation as would conciliate a reafonable competency with a proper  
regard to the limits prefcribed by the law. It is hoped that the circum.  
fpection which has béen ufed will be found, in the refult, to have fecured  
the lait of the two objects; but it is probable that, with a view to the fir,  
in fome inftances, a revifion of the provifion will be found advifable.  
  
The impreffions with which this law has been received by the commu-  
nity have been, upon the whole, fuch as were to be expected among en-  
lightened and well difpofed citizens, from the propriety and neceflity of  
the meafure.—The novelty however of the tax in a confiderable part of the  
United States, and a mifconception of one of its provifions, have given  
occafion in particular places to fome degree of difcontent.—But it is fatis-  
factory to know that this difpofition yields to proper explanations and ee  
jult apprehenfions of the true nature of the law. And I entertain a full  
confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives which arife out of a  
jult fenfe of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public welfare. ae  
  
If there are any circumftances in the law, which, confiftently with its  
main defign, may be fo varied as to remove any well intentioned —  
that may happen to exift, it will confitt with a wife moderation to make  
the proper variations. It is defirable, on all occafions, to unite with a fteady  
and firm adherence to conititutional and neceflary aéts of government, se  
fulleft evidence of a difpofition, as far as may be pratticable, to onsae  
the wifhes of every part of the community, and to lay the foundations 0  
the public adminiftration in the affeétions of the people. nh  
  
Purfuant to the authority contained in the feveral aéts, on that re  
a diftriét of ten miles {quare for the permanent feat of the government 0  
the United States has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which  
diftri€ will comprehend lands on both fides of the River Patowmac and

pr wifcarried) and the returns of the officers who were charged with this  
duty, which will be laid before you, will give you the pleafing aflurance  
that the prefent population of the United States borders on four millions of  
perions. ORGe  
  
It is proper alfo to inform you that a further loan of two millionsand a half  
of Florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are fimilar  
to thofe of the on¢ Jaftannounced, except as to a {mall reduction of charges.  
Another on like terms for fix millions of Florins had been fet on foot under  
circumftances that aflured an immediate conpletion.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
  
Two Treaties which have been provifionally concluded with the Chero-  
kees, and fix nations of Indians, will be laid before you for your confidera-  
tion, and ratification.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
In entering upon the difcharge of your legiflative truft, you muft antici-  
pate with pleafure, that many of the difficulties neceflarily incident to the  
frit arrangements of a new government, for an extenfive country, have  
been happily {urmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your  
predeceflors, in co-operation with the other branch of the legiflature. ‘The  
important objeéts which remain to be accomplifhed, will, 1 am perfuaded,  
be conduéted upon principles equally comprehenfive, and equally well cat-  
culated for the advancement of the genera! weal.  
  
The time limited for receiving fub{criptions to the loans propofed by the  
att making provifion for the debt of the United States, having expired,  
fatements from the proper department, will, as foon as poflible, apprife  
you of the exact refult; enough, however, is already known, to afford an  
alurance that the views of that aét have been fubflantially fulfilled. The  
fub{cription in the domettic debt of the United States has embraced by far  
the greateft proportion of that debt—affording, at the fame time, proot of  
the general fatisfaétion of the public creditors with the fyftem which has  
been propofed to their acceptance, and of the fpirit of accommodation to  
the convenience of the government with which they are aétuated. The  
fublcriptions in the debts of the refpeétive ftates, as far as the provifions of  
the Jaw have permitted, may be faid to be yet more general. ‘The part of  
thedebt of the United States, which remains unfub{cribed, will naturally  
engage your further deliberations. ’  
  
Itis particularly pleafing to me to he able to announce to you, tat the  
revenues which have been eftablifhed, promife to be adequate to their ob-  
jets, and may be permitted, if no unforefeen exigency occurs to fupercede  
for the prefent, the neceflity of any new burdens upon our conftituents.  
  
An objet which will claim your early attention is a provifion for the  
carrent fervice of the entuing year, together with fuch a(certained demands  
Upon the treafury as require to be immediately diicharged, and {uch cafu-  
alties as may have arifen in the execution of the public bufinefs, for which  
no {pecific appropriation may have yet been made; of all which a proper  
‘mate will be laid before you.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and Hou/e of Reprefentatives, ied:  
I thall content myfelf with a general reference to foruhes sommmntee see  
ior feveral objeéts, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hither

There are, however, fome of them, of which I cannot forbear a more  
particular mention.  
  
Thee are the militia—the pofl-office and poft-roads—the mint-—weights  
and meafures—a provifion for the fale of the vacant lands of the U. States,  
  
The firft is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed  
in referegce to the national fecurity, to the fatistaction of the community,  
or to the prefervation of order.  
  
In connection with this, the eftablifhment of competent magazines and  
arfenals, and the fortification of fuch places as are peculiarly important and  
vulnerable, naturally prefent themfelves toconfideration. The fafety of the  
United States under divine protection, ought to reft on the balis of {yftematic  
and folid arrangements, expoted as little as poflible to the hazards of for-  
tuitous circumiftances.  
  
The importance of the pofl-office and poft-roads, on a plan fufficiently  
liberal and comprehenfive, as they refpe&amp; the expedition, fafety and facility  
of communication, is increafed by the initrumentality in diffufing a know-  
ledge of the laws and proceedings of the government which, while it con-  
tributes to the fecurity of the people, ferves alfo to guard them againft the  
effects of mifreprefentation and miiconception.  
  
The eftablifhment.of additional crofs pofts, efpecially to fome of the im-  
portant points in the weflern and northern parts of the union, cannot fail to  
be cf material utility.  
  
The diforders in the exifling currency, and efpecially in the fearcity of  
{mall change—a {carcity fo peculiarly diftreffing to the poorer clafles,—  
ftrongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the eftablifhment of  
a mint. Meafures have been taken, purfuant to that refolution, for procur-  
ing fome of the moft necefary artifts, together with the requifit apparatus.  
  
An uniformity in the weights and meafures of the country, is among the  
important objeéts fubmitted to you by the conflitution, and if it can be  
derived from a flandard at once invariable and univerfal, muft be no leis  
honourable to the public councils, than conducive to the public convenience.  
  
A provifion for the fale of the vacant lands of the United States, is par-  
ticularly urged, among other reafons, by the important coaficerations,  
  
That they are pledged as a fund for reimburfing the public debt ;—That  
if timely and judicioufly applied, they may fave the neceflity of burdening  
  
our citizens with new taxes for the extinguifhment of the principal ; and  
that being free to difcharge the principal, but in a limited proportion, no  
Opportunity ought to be loft for availing the public of its rights.

Fellew-Citizens of the Senate, and of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
7  
  
MEET you, upon the prefent occafion, with the feelings which are naturally i  
  
infpired by a itreng impreflion of the profperous fituation of our common country,  
  
and by a perfuafion equally ftrong that the labours of the feflion, which has juft com-  
  
meticed, will, under the guidance of a fpirit no lefs prudent than patriotic, iflue in  
1eafures, conducive to the ftability and increafe of national profperity.  
  
Numerous as are the providential bleflings which demand our grateful acknow-  
  
ledgements—the abundance with which another yearhas again rewarded the induftry : e  
  
of the hufbandman is too important to efcape recollection. ry  
Your own objervations, in your refpective fituations, will have fatisfied you of the 24  
  
progreflive ftate of agriculture, manufactures, commerce and navigation : In tracing  
  
their caufes, you will have remarked, with particular pleafure, the happy efie@s of ¢  
  
that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which the conititution and  
laws of the united flates have fo eminently contributed : And you will have obferved, I  
with no lefs intereit, new and decifive proofs of the encreafing reputation and credit ce  
of the nation. But you neverthelefs cannot fail to derive fatisfaction from the cons  
firmation of thefe circumftances, which will be difclofed in the feveral official come  
munications that will be made to you, in the courfe of your deliberations.  
  
The rapid fubfcriptions to the Bank of the united ftates, which completed the fum  
allowed to be fubfcribed in a fingle day, is among the ftriking and pleafing evidences  
which prefent themfelves, not only of confidence in the government, but of refource &#x27; :  
in the community.  
  
In the interval of your recefs, due attention has been paid to the execution of the  
different obje&amp;s which were ipecially provided for by the laws and refolutions of the ‘a  
laft feflion. :  
  
Among the moft important of thefe, 1s the defence and fecurity of the weftern fron- \ :  
tiers. ‘To accomplifh it on the moit humane principles, was a primary wilh.  
  
Accordingly, at the fame time that treaties have been provifionally concluded, and 5  
other proper means ufed to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their friendthip &#x27;  
the well-difpofed tribes of Indians—effetual meafures have been adopted to make  
thofe of a hoftile defcription fenlible, that a pacification was defired upon terms of  
moderation and juttice.  
  
Thefe meafures having proved unfuccefsful, it became necefflary to convince the re-  
fraQory of the power of the united fates to punifh their depredations. Offentiive  
operations have therefore been direfed ; to be condudéied, however, as confifiently as  
polble with the dictates ef humanity. Some of thel¢ have been crowned wath full

fuccefs, and others are yet depending. The expeditions which have heen completed  
  
were carried on under the authority, and at the expence of the united fates, by the  
  
militia of Keutucky ; whofe enterprife, intrepidity, and good conduct, are entitled  
to peculiar commendation.  
  
Overtures of peace are ftill continued to the deluded tribes, and confiderable num.  
bers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all further oppolition,  
removed from their former fituatious, and placed themfelves under the immediate  
protection of the united itates.  
  
It is fincerely to be defired, that all need of coercion, in future, may ceafe ; and that  
an intimate intercourfe may fucceed; calculated to advance the happinels of the In.  
dians, and to attach them firmly to the united fates.  
  
in order to this, it feems neceflary,  
  
That they thould experience the benefits of an impartial difpenfation of juftice.  
  
That the mode of alicnating their lands, the main fource of difcuntemt and war, fhould  
be fo defined and regulated, asto obviate impofition, and, as far as may be prac.  
ticable, controverfy, concerning the reality and extent of the alienations which are  
made.  
  
That commerce with them fhould be promoted under regulations tending to fecure  
an equitable deportment towards them, and that fuch rational experiments fhould  
be made, for imparting to them the bleflings of civilization, as may, from time te  
time, fuit their condition.  
  
That the executive of the united ftates fhould be enabled to employ the means to  
which the Indians have been long accuitomed for uniting their immediate interes  
with the prefervation of peace.  
  
And, that efhcacious provifion fhould be made for infliding adequate penalties upon  
all thofe, who, by violating their rights, thall infringe the treaties, and endanger  
the peace of the union.  
  
A fyftem correfponding with the mild principles of religion and philanthropy to-  
wards an unenlightened race of men, whole happinefs materially depends on the con-  
duct of the united ftates, would be as honourable to the national character as con-  
formable to the dictates of found policy.  
  
‘The powers fpecially vefted in me by the act laying certain duties on diftilled  
fpirits, which refpe&amp; the fubdivitions of the diltricts into furveys, the appointment of  
officers, and the aflignment of compenfations, have likewiie been carried into effect.  
In a matter in which both oiaterials and experience were wanting to guide the cal-  
culation, it will be readily conceived that there mult have been difficulry in fuch an  
adjuftment of the rates of compenfation as would conciliate a reafonable competency  
with a proper regard to the limits preferibed by the law. It is heped that the cir-  
cumfpection which has been ufed will be found in the refult to have fecured the lat  
of the two objeéts; but it is probable, that with a view to the firlt, in fome inttances,  
arevifion of the provifion will be found advifeabie.  
  
The impreflions with which this law has been received by the community have  
been, upon the whole, fuch as were to be expected among enlightened and well dif-  
pofed citizens, from the propriety and neceflity of the meafure. ‘The novelty how-  
ever of the tax, in a confiderable part of the united fates, and a mifeonception of  
fome of its provifions, have given occafion, in particular places, to fome degree of dil-  
content. But it 1s fatisfaGtory to know, that this difpofition yields to proper explana-  
tions, and more juit apprehenfions of the true nature of the Jaw. And I entertains  
  
full confidetee, that it will, in all, give way to motives which arife out of a juit fenie  
of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public welfare.  
  
If there are any circumitances in the law, which, confiftently with its main defign,  
may ,be fo varied as to remove any well-intentioned objeQions that may happen to  
exift, it will confit with a wife moderation to make the proper variations. It is de-  
firable, on all occafions, to unite With a fteady and firm adherence to conftitutional  
and neceflary acts of government, the fulleft evidence of a difpofition, as far as may  
be pratticable, to confult the withes of every part of the community, and to lay the  
foundations of the public adminiitration in the affections of the people.  
  
Purfuant to the authority contained in the feveral acts on that fubje&amp;t—a diftrié  
of ren miles fquare, for the permanent feat of the government of the united ftates, has  
been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which difri&amp; will comprehend lands

A city has alfo been laid out, agreeably to a plan which will be placed before congrefs :  
And as there is a profpect, favoured by the rate of fales which have already taken  
place, of ample funds for carrying on the neceflary public buildings, there is every  
expectation of their due progrefs. ; ;  
  
rhe completion of the cenfus of the inhabitants, for which provifion was made by  
law, has been duly notified (excepting one initance in which the return has been in-  
formal, and another in which it has been omitted, or mifcarried) and the returns of  
the officers who were charged with this duty, which will be laid before you, wiil give  
you the pleafing affurance, that the prefent population of the united ftates borders on  
four millions of perfons  
  
Itis proper alfo to inform you, that a further loan of two millions and an half of  
florins has been completed in Holland ; the terms of which are fimilar to thefe of  
the one laft announced, except as to a {mall reduction of charges. Another, on like  
terms, for fix millions of florins, had been fet on foot, under circunrftances that aflured  
an immediate completion.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
  
Two treaties which have been provifionally concluded with the Cherokees, and Sz  
  
mations of Indians, will be laid before you, for your confideration and ratification.  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
In entering upon the difcharge ol your legiflative truft, you muft anticipate with  
pleafure, that many of the difficulties, neceflarily incident to the firft arrangements  
of anew goverment, for an extenfive country, have been happily furmounted by the  
zealous and judicious exertions of your predeceflors, in co-operation with the other  
branch of the legiflature. ‘The important objects which remain to be accomplithed,  
will, | am perfuaded, be conducted upon principles equally comprehenfive, and equally  
well calculated for the advancement of the general weal  
  
The time limited for receiving {ubfcriptions to the loans propofed by the a&amp; making  
provifion for the debt of the united fates having expired, itatements from the proper  
department will, as foon as pollible, apprite yeu of the exact refult. Enough, however,  
is already known, to afford an aflurance that the views of that act have been fubitan-  
tially fulfilled. ‘The fubfcription in the dogettic debt of the united flates has em-  
braced by far the greatelt proportion of that debt ; aflording, at the fame time, proof  
of the general fatistaction of the public creditors with the fyttem which has been pro-  
pe fed to their acc ‘prance, and of the ipirit of accomn odation to the convenience of  
the government with which they are actuated. ‘The fubicriptions in the debts of the  
refpective ftates, as far asthe provifions of the law have permitted, may be faid to be  
yct more general. The part of the debt of the united ftates which remains. unfub-  
icribed, will naturally engage your further deliberations,  
  
It is particularly pleafing to me to be able to announce to you, that the revenues  
which have been citablifhed promife to be adequate to their objects ; and may be per-  
mitted, if no unforefeen exigency occurs, to fuperiede, for the present, the neceflity of  
any new burthens upon our conttituents.  
  
Au obje&amp; which will claim your early attention is,a provifion for the current fer-  
vice of the enluing year, together with fuch aicertained demands upon the treaiury  
as require to be ammediatcly difcharged, and fuch cafualties as may have arifes  
in the execution of the public butineds, for which no tpecific appropriation may have  
yet been made; of all which a proper eftimate will be laid before you.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and LHouje of Repre/entatives,  
  
I fhall conteat myfelf with a general reference to former communications for feveral  
objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto poltponed any definitive  
refolution. ‘Their importance will recall them to your attention ; and I truft that the  
progrets already made in the molt arduous arrangements of the government, will af-  
ford you leifure to refume them with advantage. ,  
  
here are, however, fome of them of which lecannot forbear a more particular  
mention.—Thefe are the militia, the poft-office and poft-roads—the mint, weights  
aud meafures, and a provifion for the fale of the vacant lands of the united ftates.  
  
The firft is certainly an obje&amp; of primary importance, whether viewed in refer-  
ence to the national fecurity, to tl  
  
e fatislaclion of the community, or to the preferwa-  
tion of order. Ju connection with  
  
this, the eftablithment of competent magazines  
andarfenals, and the fortification of fuch places as are peculiarly important and vul-  
nerable, naturally present themicives to confideration. Ihe tafety of the united Rates,

Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the  
House q*f Representatives,  
I MEET you, upon the present occasion, with the feelings which  
arc naturally inspired by a strong imprefiion ps the prosperous  
Jituation of our common country, and by a persuasion equally  
itrong that the labors of the session, which has just commenced,  
will, under the guidance of a spirit no less prudent than pat * iotic,  
i/Tue in measures, conducive to the liability and increase of national  
prosperity.  
Numerous as are the providential bleflings which demand our  
grateful acknowledgments—the abundance with which another  
year has again rewarded thV industry of the husbandman is too im­  
portant to escape recollc6lion.  
  
Your own observations, in your refpe&amp;ive situations, will have  
fatisfied you of the progreflive state of agriculture, manufa&amp;ures,  
commerce and navigation: In tracing their causes, you will have  
remarked, with particular pleasure, the happy effects of that re­  
vival of confidence, public as well as private, to which the consti­  
tution and laws of the United States have so eminently contribut­  
ed : And you will have observed, with no less iutereft, new and  
decisive proofs of the encreafing reputation and credit of the na­  
tion. But you nevertheless cannot fail to derive fatisfa&amp;ion from  
the confirmation of these circumstances, which will be disclosed,  
in the federal official communications, that will be made to you in  
the course of your deliberations.  
  
The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which  
completed the sum allowed to be fubferibed, in a Angle day, is  
among the Unking and pleasing evidences which present them­  
selves, not only of confidence in the government, but of resource  
in the community.  
  
In the interval of your recess, due attention has been paid to the  
execution of the different obje&amp;s which were specially provided  
for by the laws and resolutions of the last fefiion.  
  
Among the most important ot these, is the defence and security  
of the Weftem Frontiers. To accomplilh it on the most humane  
principles, was a primary with.  
  
Accordingly, at the fame time, that treaties have been provi­  
sionally concluded, and other proper means used to attach the wa­  
vering and to confirm in their fricndihip, the well.disposed tribes  
of Indians—effe&amp;ual meaCures have been adopted to make those  
of a hostile deCcription sensible, that a pacification was deli red  
upon terms of moderation and justice.  
  
These mea Cures having proved unfuccefstul, it became neceflary  
to convince the refra&amp;ory of the power of the United States to  
puniih their depredations. Offenfive operations have therefore  
been dire&amp;ed ; to be conduced, however, as consistently as pofli­  
ble with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have been  
crowned with full success, and others are yet depending. The ex­  
peditions which have been completed, were carried on under the  
authority, and at the expence of the United States, by the Militia  
of Kentucky ; whose entcrprife, intrepidity and good conduit,are  
entitled to peculiar commendation.  
  
Overtures of peace are Hill continued to the deluded tribes, and  
confideiable numbers of individuals belonging to them have latel)  
renounced all further opposition, removed from theii former (itu­  
aiiom, and placed themfclves under the immediate prote&amp;ion of  
the United States,  
  
It is sincerely to be desired, that all need of coercion, in future,  
may cease; and that an intimate intercom fe may succeed ; calcu­  
lated to advance the happiness of the Indians, and to attach them  
firmly to the United States.  
  
In order io this, it seems neccflary,  
1 hat ihey should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensa­  
tion of justice.  
That the mode of alienating their lands, the main source of dis­  
content and war, should be so defined and regulated, as to ob­  
viate imposition, and, as far as may be pra£ticable, controversy  
concerning the reality, and extent of the alienations which are  
made.  
That commerce with them (hould be promoted under regulations  
tending to secure an equitable deportment towards them, and  
that such rational experiments should be made, for imparting  
to them the bleflings of civilization, as may, from time to time,  
suit their condition.  
That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to em­  
ploy the means to which the Indians have been long accustom­  
ed for uniting their immediate interests with the preservation  
of peace.  
And, that efficacious provision should be made for infli&amp;mg ade­  
quate penalties upon all those who, by violating their rights,  
ihall infringe the treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.  
  
A lyftem correiponding with the mild principles of religion  
and philanthropy towaids an unenlightened race of men, whose  
happiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States,  
would be as honorable to the national character as conformable to  
the dictates of found policy. a  
The powers specially veiled in me by the a£l laying certain du­  
ties on diftilied Ipirits, which refpeft the subdivisions of the dif­  
tri&amp;s into surveys, the appointment of officers, and the aflignment  
of compensations, have likewise been carried into effefi:.—ln a  
matter in which both mateiials and experience were wanting to  
guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived that there must  
have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compeu­  
lation as would conciliate a rcafonable competency with a proper  
regard to the limits prefcribcd by the law. It is hoped that the  
circuinfpeftion which has been used will be found in the result to  
have secured the l?ft of the two objects; but it is probable, that  
with a view to the fir ft, in fomc inltances, a revision of the provi­  
sion will be found advifeable.  
  
The impreflions with which ihis law has been received by the  
community have been, upon the whole, such as were to be exped­  
c &#x27; among; enlightened and well disposed citizens, from the pro­  
priety and neceflity of the mcafure.—The novelty however of the  
tax m a considerable part of the United States, and a misconcepti­  
on of some of its provisions, have given occ&gt;r6pn in particular plac­  
es to some degree of difcontcnt.—But it is fatisfaclory to know  
tnat this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just  
2ppreht*nfions of the true nature of the law. And I entertain a  
u &#x27; co,lfidence, that it will, in ill, give way to motives which a­  
r&gt; eont of a just fenfc of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public  
welfare.  
  
If there are any circumftanccs in the law, which, confidently  
*uh its main design, may be so varipd as to remove any well in-  
objcftions, that may happen to exist, it will consist with  
•u 1 e moderation ro make the proper variations. It is desirable,  
&#x27;II oceafions, to unite wth a ftcady and firm adherence to con­  
■tiit jonnl and neccffaiy efts of government, the tulleft evidence of  
a &#x27; po.nion, as far as may be practicable, to confulr the wishes of  
3rt °&#x27; l^C communty&gt; to lav the* foundations of the  
Pu icadminiftration in the affe&amp;ions of the people.

Gentlemen of t.hi Senate.  
wo Treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the  
lerokees and fix nations of Indians, wiil be laid before you for  
your conuderation, and ratification.  
  
Gentlemen of thf. House of Representatives.  
in entering upon the dtfchatge of your legislative trust, youmuft  
anticipate with pleasure, that many of the difficulties, necessarily  
incident 10 the firll arrangements of a new government, lor an  
exten.ive country, have been happily surmounted by the zealous  
and judicious exertions of your predecefTors in co-operation with  
»ie ocuer ranch of the legislature. The important objc&amp;s,  
v.h&#x27;ch remain to be accompli.&#x27;hed, will, I am perluaded, *be con­  
ducted upon principles equally co.nprehenlWe, and equally well  
calculated tor the advancement of the general weal.  
Fne time-limited for receiving fußferiptions to the loans pro­  
piled by the adt making pvovifion for the debt of the United  
Sates having expired,flatements from the proper department will,  
as loon as possible, a:&gt;prifc you of the exa£l result. Enough how­  
ei er is already known, to afford an allurance that the views of  
that afi have been fubftant&#x27;tally fulfilled. The fubfenption in the  
d&#x27; »nv iiic debt of the United Stares has embraced by far the great­  
elt proportion of that debt ; affording at the fame time^proof  
0 the general fatisfaClion of the public creditors with the  
ft stem which has been proposed to their acceptance, and of the  
ipirit o( accommodation to the convenience of the government  
with which they are actuated. The fubferiptions in the debts of  
tit .* relpcfliye States, as far as the provilious of the law have per­  
muted, may be said to be universal. The part of the debt  
01 the United Staie&gt;, whicii remains unfubferibed, will naturally  
engage your further deliberations.  
  
It is particularly pleating to me to be able to announce to you,  
that the i even lies which have been ellabliOicd promifeto be ade­  
quate to their obje&amp;s ; and may be permitted, if no unforefeen ex-  
  
igency occurs, to fupei fede for the prcfent the neceflity of any new  
b irthens upon our constituents.  
  
An objrft which will claim your early attention is a provision  
for the current service »f the ensuing year, together with such af­  
ccrtained demands upon the Trcafuiyas require to beimmediatc­  
lv discharged, and such casualties as may have arisen in the execu­  
tion of the public business, for which no fpecific appropriation  
may have yet been made ; ol ail which a proper estimate will be  
laid before you.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and  
House of Representatives,  
  
I shall content mvfelf with a general reference to former com­  
munications for several obje£ls, upon which the urgency of other  
affairs has hitherto poftponcd any definitive resolution. Their im­  
portance will recal them to your attention ; and 1 trust that the  
p-ogrefs already made in the most arduous arrangements of the  
government, will afford you leifureto resume them with advan-  
  
There are, however, fame of them of wtrich I cannot forbear a  
more particular mention.—Thele aie the Militia, the Poft-Olfice,  
and Port Roads—tl)e Mint, Weights and Measures—a provision  
for the sale ot the vacant Lands o* the United States.  
  
The firft is certainly an object of primary importance, whether  
viewed in reference to the national lecurity, to the faiisfaftion of  
the community, or to the preservation of order.—ln connexion  
v. ith this, theeftablifhmcnt of competent magazines and arsenals,  
and the fortification of luch places as are peculiarly important and  
vulnerable, naturally ptefent themselves to confederation. The  
fafely of the United States under divine protection ought to reft on  
the basis of systematic and solid arrangements ; exposed as little  
as to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances.  
The importance of the Poft-Office and Poll Roads on a plan  
fufficiently liberal and comprehensive, as they refpe&amp; the expedi­  
tion, l&#x27;afety, and facility of communication, is increased by the  
instrumentality in diffufing a knowledge of the laws and pro­  
ceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the  
fecuritv of the people, serves also to guard them against the effctts  
of misrepresentation and misconception. The establishment of  
additional cro&#x27;.s Posts, efpeciaMy to some of the important points  
in the Weitern and Northern parts of the Union cannot fail to be  
of material utility.  
  
The disorders in the existing currency, and especially the fcar­  
cityoffmall change, a scarcity so peculiarly diftrefling to the  
poorer classes, strongly recommend the carrying into immediate  
etfett the rcfolution already entered into concerning the establish­  
ment of a Mint. Measures have been taken pursuant to that reso­  
lution for procuring some of the raoft neceflaiy artists together  
with the requisite apparatus.  
An uniformity in the Weights and Measures of the country is  
among the important objetts submitted to you by the conftitu-tion,  
and if it can be derived from a standard at once invariable and  
universal, must be no less honorable to the public councils, than  
conducive to the public convenience.  
  
A provision for the sale of the vacant Landsof the United States  
is particularly urged, among other reasons, by the important con­  
siderations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the pub­  
lic debt; that if timely and judiciously applied, they may save  
the neceflity of burtheoing our citizens with new taxes for the ex­  
tinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge  
the principal but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought  
to be loft for availing the public of its right.

“ Gentlemen of she Senate and Hiu/e  
of Reprefentatives.  
  
I thail content myfelf with a gencral ecference  
to former communications for feveral objects, up-  
on which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto  
pottpoaed any difinitive refolution ; their impor-  
tance will recall them to your attention; aad [  
tru that the progreis already made in the moft  
arduous arrangements of the yovernment will af.  
ford you leisure to relume them with advantage,  
  
There are, however, fome cf them of whichJ  
cannat forbear amore particular mention. Thefe  
  
“are the militia, the poit-office, and pott-roads,  
  
the mint,weights and meafures, a provifion for the  
fale of the vacant lands of the United States.  
  
The firft is certainly an object of primary im-  
portance, whether viewed in reference to the na-  
tional fecarity, tothe fatisfaclion of the commu-  
nity, or to the prefervation of order. In connec-  
tion with this, the eftabl; hmert of competent ma-  
g2zines and arfenals, ani che fortification of fach  
places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable,  
naturally prefent them{elves to conSderation. The  
fafety of the Unized States, under civine protec-  
tion, ought to reit on the bafis of i) lematic and  
folid arrangements ; expofed as little as poffible  
to the hazards of fortuitous circomftances.  
  
The importance of the polt-office and poi-  
roads, ona plan fefficiently liberal and compre-  
  
henfive, as they refpe&amp;t the expedition, fafety and  
  
*  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
facility of communication, is increafed by the in-  
Rtrumentality itt ditfaling a Knowledge ot the laws  
and proceedings of the goverameat; which, while  
it contributes to the fecurity of the people, ferves  
alfo to guard them againit the effe&amp;s of imfrepre-  
featation and mifconception. The eltablithment  
of additional crofs poits, efpecially to foie of the  
important points in the weitern and northern parts  
of the Union, cannot fail to be of material utility.  
  
The diforders in the exifting currency, and ef-  
pecially the fearcity of {mal! change, a {carcity fo  
peculiarly diftreffiag tu the poorer claffes, ilrongly  
recommended the carrying into imatediate eff cts  
the refolution already entered into concerning the  
eltablidiment. of a mint. Meafures have been  
taken parfuant to that refolution, for procuring  
fome of the moft neceffary artifts together with  
the requifite apparatus. .  
  
An uniformity in the weights and me:fures of  
the country, is among the important Dbjects fub-  
mitted to you by the conftitution; and if it can be  
derived from a ttandard at once invariable and uni-  
verfal, muft be no lefs hanorable to the public  
councils than conducive to the public convenience.  
  
A provifion for the fale of the vavcanc lands of  
the United States, is particularly urged, among  
other reafons, by the important confiderations  
thar they are pledged as a fund for reimburting the  
public debts that if tiny and judiciovily appli-  
ed, they may fave che neeeffity of basthening our  
citizens with new taxes for the extinguilhment of  
the principal ; and that being free to difcharge the  
principal but in a limited proportion no opportu-

FeUow-citizens of the Senate, and of (hi  
House of Reprefcntatives.  
I MEET you, upon the preterit oc­  
ofton, with the feelings, which arc na­  
turally inspired by a strong tmpreflior  
Df the prolperous lituation of our com­  
mon country, and by a persuasion equal  
ly strong, that the labours of the fcftion.  
which has just commenced, will, under  
the guidance of a spirit, no less pru­  
dent than patriotic, ifTue in mcalures  
conducive to the stability and increase  
of national prolperity.  
Numerous as arc the providentia  
bleflings which demand our gratefu,  
acknowledgments; the abundance wit&gt;  
which another year has again rcwardec  
the industry of the husbandman, is toe  
■mportant to escape recolleaion.  
Your own observations, in your re  
fpeftive situations. will have fatishcc  
vou oftheprogrefltve state of agncul  
ture, manufactures, commerce and na  
vieation : In tracing their cause., yor  
will have remarked, with particulai  
pleasure, the happy effects of that re  
vtv al ol confidence, public as well a:  
  
privtte, to which the constitution ant  
laws of the United States have so emi  
nently contributed: And you will have  
observed, with no lets interest, new anc  
deci&amp;ve proofs of the encrealing rcJPu&#x27;  
tatior and credit of the nation. But  
you,neverthelefs, cannot fail to derive  
[&quot;atisfaftion from the confirmation ol  
theft circumstances, which will b« dis­  
closed in the several official communi­  
cations that will be made to you in th(  
course of your ,  
T«ie rapid fubferiptions to the Bank  
of the United Stawa, which completed  
the I&#x27;um allowed to be fubftnbed in a  
single day, is imosi the striking and  
pleasing evidences which preftnt them­  
lelves, not only of confidence in the  
government, but of reiource in the com­  
nuj  
% interval of your recess, due  
ittention has been paid to the execu­  
tionof the different obje£U which were  
Tpeyally provided for by the laws and  
refalutions of the last feilion. .  
Among the mod important of these  
is the defence and security of the Well­  
:m frontiers. Tp accpmpliih it on  
:hemoft humane principles, was apri­  
nam wish. ■ ,  
Accordingly at the fame tune, that  
treaties have been provisionally con­  
cluded, and other proper means used  
o attach the wavering, and to confirm  
n their friendfhip, the well disposed  
ribes of Indians—effectual measures  
iav« been adopted to make these of a  
noftiie defejiption sensible, that a paci­  
fication was desired upon terms of mo­  
de tat ion and justice.  
&lt;Th«fe mealures having proved ut»-  
fuccefsful, it became necessary to con­  
v |&gt;ce the refraaory of the power of  
thl United States to puhifll their de­  
pmdatioiis ; offenfive operations have  
dStfor*; bccadirc&amp;jd » to be conduc­  
ed, however, as confidently as poillDltf  
with the dictates of humanity. Some  
of theft have been crowned with full  
success, and others are yet depending.  
The expeditions which have been com­  
pleted, were carried on under the au­  
thority, and at the expence of the Unit­  
ed States, by the militia of Kentucky ;  
whole enterprise, intrepidjty, and good  
conduct, are entitled to peculiar com­  
mendation. ,  
Overtures of pcace are lull cont tnuca  
:o the deluded tribes, and considerable  
lumbers of ihdividuals belonging to  
:liem have lately renounced all further  
jppofition, removed from their former  
Titrations, and placed themselves under  
he immediate p rot eft ion of the United  
It is sincerely to be desired, that all  
ieed of coertion, in future, may ctafc ;  
ind that an intimate intercourse may  
Tucceed ; calculated to advance the  
liappincfs of the Indians, and to attach  
:hem firmly to the United States.  
In order to this, it feeir.j necefTiiiy,  
That they (hould experience the bene­  
fits of an impartial dispensation of  
Tllat the mode of alienating their knds,  
the main source of discontent and  
war, (hould be so defined, and regu­  
lated, as to obviate imposition, and,  
as far as may be pra&amp;icable, contro­  
versy concerning the reality and ex­  
tent of the alienations which are  
made. _ , ,  
That commerce with them (hould be  
promoted under regulations tending  
to secure an equitable deportment  
towards them, and that such rational  
experiments (hould be made, for im­  
parting to them the blellings of civil­  
ization, as may, from time to time,  
suit their condition.  
That the Executive of the United State:  
(hould be enabled to employ th&lt;  
means to which the Indians have  
been long accustomed, for uniting  
their immediate intercfts with th&lt;  
preservation of peace;  
And—that efficacious provision (houlc  
be made for infli&amp;ing adequate pe  
nalties upon all those, who, by vio-  
  
Numb. i.  
  
lating their rights, shall infringe the  
treaties, and endanger the peace of  
the Union. i _  
A system corresponding with the  
mild principles of religion and philan­  
thropy towards an unenlightened race  
of men, whose happiness materially  
depends on the conduct of the United  
States, would be as honorable to the  
National character, as conformable to  
the dictates of found policy. , ,  
. . The powers specially vested in mm  
by the act, laying certain duties on •  
tilled spirits, which respects the £ab­  
divisions of the districts into surveys,  
the Appointment of officers, and the  
assignment of compensations, have liko­  
wilc been carried into effect. In a  
natter, in which both material* and  
Experience were wanting to guide the  
calculation, it will be readily conceiv­  
ed that there must have been difficulty  
in such an adjustment of the rates of  
compensation as would conciliate a rem­  
fonable competency, with a proper re­  
gard to the limits prescribed by th*  
law. It is hoped that the circumspec­  
tion which has been used will be found  
in the result to have secured the last of  
the two objects; but it is probable, that  
with a view to the fir ft, in fomeisftan­  
:es a revision of the provision will be  
Found adviseable.  
The impressions with, which this law  
has been received by the community,  
have been, upon the whole, fuels as  
were to be expected among enlightened  
tad well-disposed citizens, from the  
propriety ana necessity of the measure.  
she novelty, however, of the tax, in  
a considerable part of the United States,  
and a misconception of some of its pro­  
visions, have given occasion in parti­  
cular places to some degree of   
tent. But it is satisfactory to knew,  
i,m Am Mfmtown yirlrii &gt;Mi {■jirill  
Sanations and more just apprehensions  
&gt;f the true nature of the law. And I  
entertain a full confidence, that it will*  
n all, give way to motives which arise  
jut of a just sense of duty, and a virtu­  
jus regard to the public welfare,  
If there are any circumstances, in  
he law, which consistently with it»  
main design, may be so varied as to w  
move any well-intentioned objections  
hat may happen to exist, it will con­  
sift with a wife moderation to make the  
proper variations. It is desirable, on  
ill occasions, to unite with a steady  
and firm adherence to constitutional  
and necessary acts of government, the  
fullest evidence of a disposition, as far  
as may be practicable, to consult the  
wishes of every part of the community,  
md to lay the foundations of the pub­  
ic administration in the affections of  
he people,  
Pursuant to the authority contained  
in the several acts on that subject—a  
disrict of ten miles square, for the per­  
manent feat of the government Of the  
United States, has been fixed, and an­  
nounced by proclamation ; which dis­  
trict will comprehend lands en both  
ides of the river Potowmac, and the  
owns of Alexandria and George­  
town. A city has also been laid out  
agreeably to a plan which will be plac­  
id before Congress: And as there is a  
prospect favored by the rate of sales  
which have already taken place, of am­  
ple funds for carrying on the necessary  
public buildings, there is every expec­  
ation of their due progress.  
The completion of the census of the  
inhabitants, for which provision was  
made by law, has been duly notified  
excepting in one instance, in which  
the return has been informal; and an­  
other, in which it has been omitted or  
miscarried) and the returns of the offi­  
cers who were charged with this duty,  
which will be laid before you, will give  
you the pleasing assurance, that the pre­  
sent population of the United States  
borders on four millions of persons.

xiplifhed, will, I am persuaded, be  
conducted upon principles equally  
comprehensive, ana equally well cal­  
xulated tor the advancement of the gc­  
-acral weal.  
The time limited for receiving sub­  
scriptions to the loans proposed the  
making provision for the debt of the  
•United States, having expired, state­  
ments from the proper department,  
will, as soon as possible apprise you of  
-the exact result. Enough, however,  
-is already known to afford an assurance  
*hat the views of that act have been  
substantially fulfilled. The subscrip­  
t ion in the domestic debt of the United  
States, has embraced by far the great­  
ex! .-proportion of that debt ; affording  
&lt;at&#x27;tnc&lt;mmc time, proof of the general  
satisfaction of the public creditors with  
the system which has been proposed to  
their acceptance, and of the spirit of  
Accommodation to the convenience of  
the government with which they are  
actuated. The subscriptions in the  
debts of the respective states, as far as  
the provisions of the law have permit­  
ted, may be said to be yet more gene­  
ral. The part of the debt of the Unit­  
ed States which remains unsubscribed,  
-will naturally engage your further de­  
liberations.  
, It is particularly pleasing to me to  
be able to announce to you, that the  
revenues which have been establish­  
ed, promise to be adequate to their  
objects, and may be permitted, if no  
unforeseen exigency occurs, to super­  
sede, for the present , the necessity of  
any new burthens upon our constitu­  
ents.  
An object which will claim your  
early attention, is a provision for the  
current service of the ensuing year, to­  
gether with such ascertained demands  
upon the Treasury, as require to be  
immediately discharged, and such ca­  
sualties as may have arilen in the ex­  
ecution of the public buiinefs, for  
which no specific appropriation may  
have yet been made ; of all which, a  
proper estimate will be laid before you.  
Gentlemen of the Senate and  
■■■of the House of Representatives,  
I (hall content myself with a gene­  
ral reference to former communica­  
tions for feveral objects,upon which the  
urgency of other affairs has hitherto  
postponed any definitive resolution:—  
Their importance will recall them to  
your attention ; and I trust that the  
progress already made in the most ar­  
duous arrangements of the government  
will, afford you leisure to resume them  
with advantage.  
There are, however, some of them  
of which I cannot forbear a more par­  
ticular mention—These are, the Mili-  
Ha—the Post-Office and Poft Roads—  
the Mint—Weights and Measures—  
a Provision for the sale of the vacant  
Lands of the United States.  
The first is certainly an object of pri­  
mary importance, whether viewed in  
reference to the national security, to  
the satisfaction of the community, or  
to the preservation of order. In con­  
nection with this, the establishment of  
-competent magazines and arsenals, and  
the fortification of such places as are  
peculiarly important and vulnerable  
naturally present themselves to con­  
sideration. The safety of the United  
States, under divine protection, ought  
to reft on the basis of systematic and lb­  
-lid arrangements ; exposed as little as  
  
po (libit to the hazards of fortuitous  
circumstances.  
The importance of the post office,  
ana post roads, on a plan inssciently  
liberal and comprehensive, as they res­  
.pest the expedition, safety and facility  
of is encreased by the  
instrumentality in tiiffcfTing a know- &#x27;  
ledge of the laws and procèdings of the  
government; which, while It contri­  
butes to the security of the people,  
serves also to guard them against the  
effects of misrepresentstion and mifcon-.&#x27;  
ccjjtion. Ihe eftablifhinent of addi­  
tional cross-posts, especially to some of  
the important points in the western and  
northern parts of the Union, cannot  
fail to be of material utility.  
The disorders in the existing currrti- 1  
cy, and especially the scarcity of small!.  
change, a scarcity so peculiarly distress­  
ing to the poorer classes, strongly re­  
commend the carrying into immediate  
effeftthe resolution already entered in­  
to conccrning the eftabliftiment of a  
mint. Meafurcs ha\&#x27;e been taken pur­  
luant to that resolution for procuring  
some of the most necessary artists, to­  
gether with the necessary apparatus.  
An uniformity in the weights and  
meafurcs of the country is among the  
important objects submitted to you by  
the eonftitution, and if it can be deri­  
ved from a standard at once invariable  
and univcrfal. must be no less honora­  
ble to the public councils than condu­  
cive to the public convenience.  
A provision for the sale of the vacant  
lands of the United States, is particu­  
larly urged, amongother reasons, by the  
important contidcrations, that they are  
pledged as a fund for reimbursing the  
public debtthat if timely and judi­  
cioufiy applied they may save the ne­  
ccfTity of burthening our citizens with  
new taxes for the extinguifhmcnt of the  
principal ; and that being free to dif­  
chargc the principal, but in a limited  
proportion, no opportunity ought to  
be loft for availine the public of its  
right.

33) APPENDIX I—PUBLIC PAPERS, (Amer, Muf,  
  
In the interval of your recefs, due attention has been paid to the execution of  
the different objects, which were {pecially provided for by the laws and re(oluti-  
ons of the latt feffion,  
  
Among the moft important of thefe, is the defence and fecurity of the weft.  
ern frontiers. To accomplith it on the moft humane principles, was a primary  
with.  
  
Accordingly, at the fame time that treaties have been provifionally conclud-  
ed, and other proper means uled to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their  
friendfhip, the well-difpofed tribes of Indians—effeCiual meafures have been a-  
dopted, to make thofe of a hoitile defcription fentibie, that a pacification was de-  
fired upon terms of moderation and juftice.  
  
Thefe meaiurcs having proved unfuccefsful, it became neceflary to convince  
the refroGtory, of the power of the united ftates to punifh their depredations, Of-  
fenfive operations have therefore been dircéted ; to be conducted, however, as  
coniifiently as poffibie, with the dictates of humanity, Some of theie have been  
crowned with full fuccefs ; and others are yet depending, The expeditions  
which have been completed, were carried on under the authority, and at the ex-  
penfe of the united ftates, by the mulitia of Kentucky, whofe enterprile, intres  
pidity, and good conduct, are entitled to peculiar commendation.  
  
Overtures of peace are {till continued to the deluded tribes : and confiderable  
numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced all iurther op-  
pofition, removed from their former fituations, and placed themieclves under the  
mnmediate protection of the united ftates.  
  
It is fincerely to be defied, that all need of coercion, in future, may ceafe ;  
and that an intimate intercourfe may tucceed, calculated to advance the happt-  
nets of the Indians, and to attach then firmly tothe united fates.  
  
In order to this, it feems neceflary,  
  
That they fhould experience the benefits of an impartial cifpenfation of jufs  
tice,  
  
‘Thet the mode of alienating their lands, the main fource of difcontent and war,  
flould be fodefined and regulated, as to obviate impofition, and, as far aS  
may be practicable, controverly conce ning the reality and extent of the aliena-  
tions which are made,  
  
That commerce with them fhould be promoted uncer regulations tending to fe-  
cure an equitable deportment towards them, and that iuch rational experiunents  
fhould be made, fo: mmparting to them the bicflings of civilization, as may,  
from time to time, fuit their condition.  
hat the executive of the united flates fhould be enabled to employ the means  
to which the Indians have been long accufomed, for uniung thew immicaiate  
interefts with the prefervation of peice.  
  
And, thatefficacious provifion fhould be made for inflicting adequate penalties  
upon all thoie, who, by violating thei rights, fhali infringe the treaties, and  
endanger the peace of the union.  
  
A fyflem correfponcing with the mild principles of religion and philanthropy  
towards an unenlightened race of men, whole happincfs materially depends on  
the conduct of the united fates, would be as honourable to the national charace  
ter, as conformable to the dictates of found policy.  
  
The powers tpecialiy veited in me by the act laying certain duties on diftilled  
{piris, which respect the fubdivitions of the caiftricts ito durveys, the appoint-  
ment of officers, and the aflignment of compenfaucns, have likewile been carricd  
into effect. —In a matterin which both materials and experience were wanting to  
guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived, that there mui have been dif-  
ficulty in duch an adiuflment of the rates of compeniation, as would conciliate a  
  
  
  
you, x] Plan for the arrangement of the miditia of the U.S. (39  
  
reafonable competency wit! a proper regard to the limits prefcribed by the law.  
It is hoped, that the cieun! ipection which has been vied, will be found, in cr  
refult, to have fecured the latt of the two objets ; but it is probal ve, that witha  
view to the firft, in fome initances, a revibon of the provilion will be found &quot;  
vileable.  
  
The impreffions, with which this law has been received by the community,  
have been, upon the whole, {uch as were tu be expected among enlightened and  
well-difpofed citizens, from the propriety and neceflity of the meafure.—The no-  
velty, however, of the tax, in 4 coifiderable part of the united itates, and a mif-  
conception of fome of its provilions, have given occafion, im particular places,  
to fome degree of difcontent.—But it is fatisfactory to know, that this cilpofiti-  
on yields to proper explanations and more juit apprehenfions of the true nature  
of thelaw. And I entertain a full confidence, that it will, in ail, give way to  
motives which arife out of a jult fenfe of duty, anda virtuous regard to the pubs  
lic welfare.  
  
If there are any circumftancesin the law, which, confiftently with its main des  
fizn, may be fovaried, asto remove any well-intentioned objeCtions, that may  
happen to exilt, it will confift with a wile moderation to makethe proper variati-  
ons. It is defirable, on all occafions, tounite with a fteady and firm adherence  
to conftitutional and neceffary acts of government, ‘the fulleit evidence of a difpe-  
fition, as far as may be pratticable, to confult the wishes of every part of the  
community, and to lay the foundations of the public adminiitration in the affecu-  
ons of the people.  
  
Purfuant to the authority contained in the feveral acts on that tubject—a dii-  
trict of ten miles fquare, for the pernanent feat of the government of the united  
ftates, has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which difterét will  
comprehend lands on both fides of the river Potowmac and the towns of Alex.  
andria and George-towa. Acity has alfo been laid out, agreeably to a plan  
which will be placed before congrefss and as there isa proi{peét, favoured by  
the rates of fales which have already taken place, ot ample funds tor carrying  
on the neceflary public buildings, there is every expectation of their due pros  
greis,  
  
The completion of the cenfus of the inhabitants, for which provifon was  
made by law, has been duly notified (excepting one inftauce, in which the retuen  
has been informal, and another, in which it bas been omitied, or mitcarried)  
and the returns of the officers who were charged with this duty, which will be  
laid before you, will give you the pleafing affurance, that the pieient population  
of the united ftates borders on four millions of perfons.  
  
It is proper alfo to inform you, that a furtver loan of two millions and ahalf  
of florins has been comp!eted in Holland; the terms of which are imilar to tho  
of the one laft announced, except as tua imal] reduction of  
on like terms, for fix millions of florius had been te

40) APPENDIX I.—PUBLIC PAPERS, [Amer, Muf,  
  
remain to be accomplifhed, will, I am perfuaded, be conduéted upon principles  
equally comprehenfive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the  
general weal.  
  
The time limited for receiving fub{criptions to the loans propofed by the a&amp;  
making provifion for the debt of the united ftates having expired, ttatements  
from the proper department will, as foon as poffible, apprife you of the exag&amp;  
refult, Enough, however, is already known, to afford an aflurance, that the  
views of that act have been fubftantially fulfilled. The iub{cription in the do.  
meftic debt of the united flates has embraced by far the greateft proportion of  
that debt; affording, at the fame time, proof ot the general fatisfaction of the  
public creditors with the fyftem which has been propoied to their acceptance, and  
of the {pirit of accommodation to the convenience of the government, with  
which they are actuated. ‘The fub{criptions in the debts of the refpective ftates,  
as far as the provifions of the law have permitted, may be {uid ta be yet more  
general. The part of the debt of the umited ftates, which remains unfub-  
icribed, wiil naturally engage your further deliberations.  
  
It is particularly pleafing tomes to be able to announce to you, that the re.  
venues, which have been eitablifhed, promife to be adcquate to their objects ;  
and may be permitted, if no unforefeen exigency occurs, to fuperiede, tor the  
prefent, thencceffity of any new burdeiis upon our conitituents.  
  
An obje&amp;t, which will claim your early attention, is a provition for the current  
fervice of the enfuing year, together with fuch aicertained demands upon the  
treafury, a8 require to be immediately difcharged, and fuch cafualties as may  
have arifen in the execution of the public bufinefs, for which no {pecific appro-  
priation may have yet been made; of all which a proper eftimate will be laid be-  
fore you.  
  
Gentlemen of the fenate and boufe of reprefentatives,  
  
I fhall content myfelf witha general reference to former communications, for  
feveral objeéts, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto poftponed  
any definitive refolution. Their importance will recai them te your attention ;  
and I truft, that the progrefs already made in the moft arduous arrangements  
of the government, will afford you leiiure to refume them with advantage,  
  
There are, however, fome of them, of which I cannot forbear a more par-  
ticular mention. Thefe are the militia, the pott office, and poft roads—the  
mint, weights and meafures—and a provifion for the fale of the vacant lands of  
the united ftates.  
  
The firft is certainly an obje&amp;t of primary importance, whether viewed in re.  
ference to the national fecurity, to the fatisfaction of the community, orto  
the prefervation of order. In connexion with this, the eflablifiment of com.  
petent magazines and arfenals, and the fortification of fuch places as are pecu.  
liarly important and vulnerable, naturally prefent themfelves to confideration.  
‘The fafety of the united ftates, under divine protection, ought to reit on the  
bafis of fyflematic and folid arrangements ; expofed, as little as poffible, to  
the hazards of fortuitous circumitances.  
  
The importance of the poft office and poft roads, ona plan fufficiently  
jiveral and comprehenfive, as they refpect the expedition, fatety, and facility  
ef communication, is increafed by their inftrumentality in diffufing a knowledge  
ot the jaws and proceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to  
the fecwrity of the people, ferves allo to guard them againft the effects of mifre-  
prefentation and mifconceptien. The eftablifhment of additional crofs pofts,  
efpecially to fome of the important points in the weftern and northern parts of  
he union, cannot fail to be of material utility.

Fellow citimens of the Senate, and of the  
Houle of Representatives,  
  
MEET you upon the prefent occafion,  
  
wich the feelings which are naturally in-  
tpired by a itrong impreflion of the prof-  
perous fituation of our common country,  
and by a perfuafion equally trong, that the  
babors of the feffion which has juit com-  
menced, will, under the guidance of a  
fpirit no lefs prudent than patriotick, iffue  
im meatures conducive tothe ftability and  
increafe of national profperity.  
  
Numerous as are the providential blefi-  
ings which demand our grateful acknow-  
tedgments—&lt;-the abundance with which an-  
other year has again rewarded the induttry  
of the hulbandman, is too important to  
efcape recolieétion.  
  
Your own obfervations, in your refpec-  
tive fituations, will have fatisfied you of  
the progreilive itate of agriculture, manu-  
factures, commerce, and navigation ; in  
tracing their caufes, you will have remark-  
ed, with particular pieafure,the happy efiects  
of that revival of confidence, publick as well  
as private, to which the conftitution and  
jaws of the United States have fo eminent-  
by contributed ; and you will have obferved  
with no lefs intere(t, new and decifive proofs  
of the increafing reputation and credit of  
the nation.—But you, neverthele!s, cannot  
fail to derive fatisfaétion from the confir-  
mation of thefe circumftances, which will  
  
be difclofed in the feveral official commu-  
nications that will be made to you jn the  
courfe of your deliberations.  
  
The rapid fubfcriptions to the bank of  
the United States, which completed the fum  
ailowed to be fubicribed in a tingle day, 1s  
among the ftriking and pleafing evidences  
which prefent themfelves, not only of cof-  
fidence in the government, but of refources  
in the community.  
  
In the interval of your recefs, due attene  
tion’ has been paid to the execution of  
the different objeéts which were fpecially  
provided for by the laws and refolutions of  
the lat feffion. .  
  
Among the moft important of thefe is the  
defence and fecurity of the weftern frontiers.  
To accomplith it on the moft humane  
principles, was a primary with.  
  
Accordingly at the fame time that treat-  
ies have been provifionally concluded, and  
other proper means ufed to attach the wav-

the well difpofed tribes of Indians—efte&amp;-  
ual meafures have been adopted to make  
thofe of a hoftile defcription fenfible that a  
pacification was defired upon terms of mo  
deration and juttice,  
  
Thefe meafures having proved unfuce  
cefsful, it became neceffary to convince the  
refractory of the power of the United

oo ae of thefe have been crowned with full  
fuccefs, and others are yetdepending, The  
txpeditions which have been completed,  
were carried on under the authority, and  
at the expenfe of the United States, by  
the militia of Kentucky 5 whofe enterprize,  
jntrepidity and good conduct are entitied  
to peculiar commendation.  
vertures of peace are ftill continued to  
the deluded tribes, and confiderable num-  
bers of individuals belonging to them have  
lately renounced all further oppofition, re-  
moved from their former fituations, and  
placed themfelves under the immediate pro-  
tetion of the United States,  
  
It is fincerely to be defired, that all need  
of coercion, in future, may ceafe ; and that  
an intimate intercourfe may fucceed ; cal-  
culated to advance the happinefs of the In-  
diads, and to attach them firmly to the U-  
nited States,  
  
In order to this, it feems neceflary--  
  
That they thould experience the benefits  
of an impartial difpenfation of juftice !  
  
That the mode of alienating their lands,  
  
the main fource of difcontent and war,  
thould be fo defined and regulated, as to ob-  
viate impofition, and, as far as may be prac-  
ticabley controverfy concerning the reality  
and extent of the alienations which are  
made ;  
_ That commerce with them fhould be pro.  
moted, under regulations tending to fecure  
an equitable deportment towards them, and  
that fuch rational experiments fhould be  
made, for imparting to them the bieflings  
of civilization, as may from time to time,  
{uit their condition 5  
  
That the executive of the United States  
thould be enabled to employ the means to  
which the Indians have been long accuftom-  
ed for uniting their immediate interefts with  
the resermation of peace 3 and  
  
That efficacious provifion fhould be made  
for infli€ting adequate penalties upon all  
thole, who, 4 violating their rights, fhall  
infringe the treaties, and endanger the  
peace of the union,  
  
A fyftem correfponding with the mild  
principles of religion and philanthropy to-  
wards an unenlightened race of men, whofe  
  
appinefs materially depends on the con-  
duct of the United States, would be as ho=  
nourable to the national charaéter, as con-  
tormable to the diétates of found policy.  
  
The power {pecially vetted in me by the  
  
jaying certain duties on diftilled fpirits,  
which refpeéts the fub-divifions of the dif-  
tri€ts into furveys, the appointment of of-  
  
cers, and the alignment of compenfations,  
ve likewife been carried intoeffet. Ina  
matter in which both materials and experi-  
ence were wanting to guide the calculation,  
it will be readily conceived, that there mutt  
have been difficulty in fuch an adjuftment  
of the rates of compenfation, as would con-  
siliate a reafonable competency with a pros  
  
a! regard to the lintits preferibed by the  
aw. Itis hoped that the circum{peétion  
which has been ufed will be found, in the  
refult, to have fecured the laf of the two  
objeéts ; but it is probable that, with a  
view to the firft, in fome inftances, a revi-  
fion of the provifion willbe found advifa-  
ble,  
  
The impreffions with which this law has  
been received by the community, have  
been, upon the whole; fuch as were to be  
expected ney enlightened and weil dii.  
pofed citizens, from the propriety and ne-  
ceflity of the meafure. ‘Lhe novelty, how.  
ever, of the tax, in a coniiderable part of  
the United States, and a mifconception of  
fome of its provifions, have given occa-  
fion, in particular places, to forme degree of  
difcontent. But it is fatisfatory to know,  
that this Np ray Me peo to proper explas  
nations and more juft apprehenfions of the  
true nature of the law; and 1 entertain a  
full contiaence, that it will, in all, give way  
to motives which arife out of a jut fenfe of  
duty, and a virtuous regard to the public  
welfare.  
  
If there are any circumftances in the law,  
which, confiftently with its main defign,  
may be fo varied as to remove any well in-  
tentioned objections that may happen w  
exift, it will confit with a wife moaeration  
to make the proper variations. It is defir-  
able on all occafions, to unite with a fteady  
and firm adherence to conititutional and  
neceilary ats of government, the fulleft ev-  
idence of a difpofition, as far as may be  
practicable, to confult the withes of every  
part of the community, and to lay the foun-  
dations of publick adminiitration in the af.  
feétions of the people.  
  
Purfuant to the authority contained in  
the feveral aéts on that fubjeét, a difdrid of  
ten miles fquare, for the permanent feat-of  
the government of the United States, has  
been fixed and annouaced by proclamation 5  
which diftrict will comprehend lands on  
both fides of the river Potowmac, ana the  
towns of Alexandria and George-Town,  
A city has alfo been laid out, agreeably to a  
plan which will be placed before Congrefs »  
And as there is a profpedct, favoured = the  
ratefof fales which have already taken place,  
of ample funds for carrying on the necefiary  
publick buildings, there is every expectation  
of their due progrefs.

terms of which are fimilar to thofe of the  
one laft announced, except as to a fmall re-  
duétion of charges. Another on like terms  
for fix millions of Florins had been fet on  
foot, under circumftances that aflared an  
immediate completion.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
  
Two treaties which have been provifionally  
concluded with the Cherokees, and fix na-  
tions of indians, will be laid before you for  
your confideraiion and ratification.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of  
  
Reprefentatives,  
  
In entering upon the difcharge of your  
Jegifiative truft, you muft anticipate with  
pleature, that many of the difficulties ne-  
cetlarily incident to the firft arrangements of  
a new goverament, foran extenfive coun-  
try, have been happily furmounted by the  
zealous and judicious exertions of our pre-  
decefiors, in cooperation with the other  
branch of the legifiature. The important  
objets which remain to be accomplithed,  
will, 1 am perfuaded, be conduéted upon  
principles equally comprehenfive, and equal-  
ly well calculated for the advancement of  
the publick weal, !  
  
The time limited for receiving fubfcrip-  
tions to the loans propofed by the aft muk-  
ing provifion for the debt of the United  
States having expired, ftatements from the  
proper department will, as foon as poffible,  
apprife you of the exact refult. Enough  
however is already known, to afford an af-  
furance that the views of that a&amp; have  
Been fubftantially fulfilled. The fub-  
fcription In the domeftick debt of the Unir-  
ed States has embraced by far the greateft  
proportion of that debt; affording at the  
fame time proof of the general fatisfaction  
of the publick creditors with the fyftem  
which has been propofed to their accept-  
ance, and of the {pirit of accommodation to  
the convenience of the government with  
which they were actuated. The fubfcrip-  
tions in the debts of the refpeétive ftates, as  
far as the provifions of the law have per-  
mitted, may be faidto be univerfal. The  
part of the debt of the United States, which  
remains unfub{feribed, will naturally engage  
  
your further deliberations,  
  
It is particularly pleafing to me to be able  
to announce to you that the revenues which  
have been eftablifhed, promife to be ade-  
quate to their object 5 and may be permite  
ted, if no unforefeen exigency occurs, to fu-  
perfede for the prefent the neceflity of  
any new burthens upon our conftituents,  
  
An objeet which will claim our early at-  
tention is 2 provifion for the current fervice  
of the enfuing year, together with fuch af-  
Certained demands upon the treafury as re-  
oe to be immediately difcharged, and  
  
uch cafualties as may have arifen in the  
execution of the publick bufinefs for which  
ho {pecifick appropriation may have yet  
beep made ; of aliwhich a proper eflimate  
will be laid before you.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the Hea  
  
of Reprejentatives,  
  
I fhall content myfelf witha general re.  
ference to former communications for fey.  
eral objeéts upon which the urgency of  
other affairs has hitherto poftponed any de.  
finitive refolution :—Their importance will  
recall them to your attention ; and I tre@  
that the progrets already made in the mo@  
arduous arrangements of the governmeng  
will afford you leifure to refume them with  
advantage.  
  
There are however, fome of them of  
which I eannot forbear a more particulag  
mention—T hele are, the MilitiamThe Pot  
Office and Pott Roads--The Mint  
Weights and Meafures—a_ Provifion for  
the fale of the vacant Lands of the United  
States.  
  
The firft is certainly an obje&amp; of primary  
importance, whether viewed in reference  
to the national fecurity, to the fatisfa@ion  
of the community, or the prefervation of  
order. In conne€tion with this, the eftab-  
lifhment of competent magazines and arfe-  
nals, and the fortification of fuch places as  
are peculiarly important and vulnerable,  
naturally prefent themfelves to contfidera-  
tion. ‘The fafety of the United States,  
under divine prote€tion, ought to reft on  
the bafis of fyftematick and Tolid arrange-  
ment ; expofed as little as poffible to the  
hazards of fortuitous circumftances.  
  
The importance of the Poft Office and  
Poft Roads, on a plan fufficiently liberal  
and comprehenfive, as they refpeét the ex-  
pedition, fafety and facility of communi-  
cation, is increafed by the inftrumentality in  
diffuling a know!edge of the laws and pro-  
ceedings of the government; which, while  
it contributes to the fecurity of the people,  
ferves alfo to guard them againft the effects  
of mifreprefentation and mifeonception  
The eftablifhment of additional crofs pofts,  
efpecially to tome of the important pointy  
in the weftern and northern parts of the  
Union, cannot fail to be of material util-  
ity.  
  
The diforders in the exifting currency,  
and efpecially the {carcity of fmall change,  
afcarcity fo peculiarly diftrefling to the  
poorer claffes, ftrongly recommend the car-  
rying into immediate effeét the refolution  
already entered into concerning the eftab-  
lithment of a Mint. Meafures have been  
taken purfuant to that refolution for pro-  
curing fome of the moft neceffary artifts,  
together with the requifite ogee  
  
An uniformity in the weights and mea-  
fures of the country is among the impor-  
tant objeéts fubmitted to you by the Cone  
ftitution, and if itcan be derived from 4  
ftandard at once invariable and univerfal,  
muft be no lefs honorable to the pu  
councils than conducive to the publick con-  
venience.  
  
A provifion for the fale of the vacant  
lands of the United States, is particularly

Felloaw-Citizens of the Senate and  
o of the House of Representatives,  
MERT you, upon the present occa-  
I fion, -with the feelings, which are  
naturally inspired by a strong imprefhi­  
on of the prosperous situation of our  
common country, and by a persuasion  
equally strong, that thelabors of ‘the  
{effion, which has just commenced, will,  
under the guidance of the spirit, no&#x27;lefs  
prudent than patriotic, issue in mea­  
sures conducive to the stability and in­  
crease of national prosperity.  
Numerous as’ are the providential  
bleflings which demand our grateful  
acknowledgments ; the abundance with  
which another year has again reward­  
ed the industry of the hutbandman, is  
too important to efeape recoliection.  
Your own observations, in your re­  
fpedtive situations, will have fatisfied  
you of the progreflive state of agricul­  
ture, manufatures, commerce and nal  
vigation : In tracing their causes,- you  
will have remarked, with part)cuvla.xr  
pleasure, the happy effelts of that revi­  
val of confidence, publicas well as pri­  
yate, 1o which the constitution and  
Jaws of the United States have so emi­  
nently contributed : And yon will have  
observed, with no less interest, new  
and decisive proofs of the encreafling  
reputation and éredltx_)f the nation.—  
Bat you, nevertheless cannot fail to de­  
rive fatisfalion from the confirmation  
  
of these circumstances, ‘which will be  
disclosed in the several official commu­  
nications that will be made to you in.  
the course of your deliberations. _  
The rapid subscriptions to the bank  
of the United States, which completed  
the fum&#x27; allowed to be {ubfcribéd in a  
single day, is among the striking and  
pleasing evidenges which present them-’  
selves, not only of confidence in the  
government, but of resource in the  
community, i g g  
‘ln the interval of your reeefs, due  
attention has been paid to .the execu­  
tion of the different objeds which were |  
specially provided for Dy the laws and’  
resolutions of the last session. o  
Among the most important of these  
is the defence and fecurjty of the West­  
ern Frontiers. To accomplifh_ it an  
the most humane punciples, , was. a  
IRy Wil s e et T  
Accordingly, at the fame time, that |  
treaties have been provisionally, conclu­  
~ded, and other proper means used to  
attach the wavering, and to confirm in  
} their friendthip, the well disposed tribes  
of Indians—effe@ual measures have  
been adopted to make thole of a hos:  
tile defcnption sensible, that a pacifica­  
tion was desired upon terms of .modera­  
tion and justice. &quot;  
These measures having proved un­  
fuccefsful, it became neceflary to con­  
‘vince the refratory of the power of  
; the United States to -punish their de­  
predations ;—offghfive operations have  
therefore been . dirgfled ; —to be con­  
dufted, however, as consistently as  
poflible with the diftates of humanity.  
—Some of these have been ¢rowned  
with full success,- and others are yet  
depending. . &#x27;The expeditions which  
have been completed, were, earried on  
under the authority, and at the expence  
of the United States, by the militia of  
’Kentucky; whose enterprise, intrepi­  
dity, and good condud, are entitled to  
peculiar commendation.  
Overtures of peace are still continu­  
ed to the deluded tribes, and conside­  
rable numbers of individuals b&#x27;elong&#x27;i­  
ing to them have lately renonnced all  
further opposition, removed from their  
former situations, and placed them­  
selves under the immediate proteétion  
of the United States. _ :  
  
. It is sincerely to he desired, that all|  
need of coertion, infutre, may cease ;  
and that an intimate intercourse may:  
succeed ; calculated to advance the&#x27;  
happiness of the Indians, and to at­  
tach them firmly to the United States.  
In order to this, it seems neceflary—  
That they fhonld éxperience thet  
benefits of an impartial dispensation of’  
justice. -1, el !  
That the mode of zlienating their,  
lands, the main source of difcontent]  
and war, should be so defined, and&#x27;  
regulated, as to obviate imoofition,  
and; as far as may be pradticable, con- |  
troverfy concerning the neality- and  
extent of the alienaticosc which are  
made. APy hug 4 l  
That commerce with them should  
be prommoted under regulations tending  
to secure an equitable deportment to- !  
wards them, and that such rational  
experiment should be roade, for im.  
parting to them the&#x27;bleffings ofi civili­  
zation, as may, from time to time, suit |  
their condition~ &quot;o i il  
That the Executive of the United !  
States should be enabled to employ the |  
means, to whicli.the Indians have been |  
long accustomed, for voiting their im­  
mediate interests with the prelervation  
of peacei~~ 13 1 . b b |  
And-+—that efficacions provision thould  
be made for mfli®ing adequate penal­  
ties upon sll those, who, by violating  
their rights, shall infringe the treaties,  
and epdanger the peace of the Union.  
  
A system corresponding ‘with the  
‘mild priaciples of religion and phi­  
lanthropy towards an unenlightened  
-race of men, whose happiness mate­  
rially depends on the condu&amp; of the  
United States, would be ‘as henorable  
to the National charater, as conform.  
able to the ditates of found policy,  
- The powers (pecially. vested in me  
by the adt laying certain dutics on  
duftilled spirits, which refpe&amp; the fub­  
(divifizns of the diftfi@s into farveys,  
‘tke appointment of Officers, and the  
aflignment of. compeafations; . have  
likewise been carried into effet.—ln a  
matter, in.which both materials and  
-experience were wanting to guide the  
‘calculation, it will be readily comceized  
‘ that there must have been ;difliculty in  
| such an adjuftiment of; the . rates of  
.compensation as would cenciliate a  
reasonable competency, with a pro­  
per regard to the limits prescribed by  
the law. It is hoped that the ¢circum­  
ifpeé‘tion which has been used . will be  
i found in the result to have secured the  
last of the two objets ; but it is;pro­  
bable, that with a view to the Mcft, in  
some instances a evifion of the provifi­  
&#x27; onwill be&#x27;found, advifeable. . |  
  
The impreflions with which this law  
has been : received by the community,  
bave been, upon the whole, such as  
were to be expected among enlightened  
aud well&quot; disposed: citizens, from. .the  
propriety: and neceflity of:the measure.  
‘The novelty, however; of the tax, in  
a considerable part of the United States,  
and a mis-conception of some of its  
provisions, have&#x27; given occasion in pai­  
ticular places to some degree of dis­  
content.—But it is fatisfa®ory toknew,  
that this disposition: yields to: fgdp&quot;  
explanations and’ more juit apprehewdi­  
ons.of the true: nature .of- the law.—  
And I entertain a full confidence, that  
it will, in all, give way to imotives which  
arise out of a just sense of duty, and  
a virtuous regard to the public welfare.  
If there are any circemftances; in  
the law, which consistently with its  
main design, may be so varied as to  
remove any well intentioned.objeétions  
that may happen to exist, it will con­  
filt with a. wile moderation tp make  
the proper variations—lt is desirable,  
on all occasions, to.unite with a .steady  
and&#x27; firm* adlerence “to’ canftitutional  
and nreceflury alts of government, the  
fulleft evidence of a diipofition, as far  
as may be pradticable, to consult the&#x27;  
withes as every part of the community,  
and to lay the foundations.of the pub-.  
lic administration in the affetisns of  
the pcople.: = ]  
Purfyant to the authority contained  
in the several a&amp;s on that fubjeét—a  
diftri&amp;t of ten miles square, for the  
permanent {eat of the government of  
the United States, has been fixed, and  
announced by proclamation ; which  
diftri&amp; will comprehend lands on both  
sides of the river Potowmac, and the  
towns of Alexandria and Georgetown.  
A city bas alio been Jaid out agre€ably  
to,a plan which will be placed before  
Congress : _And as there is a profpet  
favoured by the rate of sales which  
have already taken place, of simple  
funds for carrying on the neceflary  
buildings, there is every expettation of  
their due progress, e ; :  
The completion of the census of the  
inhabitants, for which provision: was |  
made by a law, has been duly notified |  
(excepting in- one . instance, in which’  
the return has been informal ; and  
another, in which it has been omitted  
or miscarried) and the returns of the  
officers who were charged with this  
duty, which will be laid before you,  
will give you the pleasing aflurance,  
that the present population of the Uni-  
  
ted States borders on four millions of  
persons. ;  
It is proper also to inform vou, that  
a further loan of two milliorss and an  
half of florins has ‘been completed in  
Halland ; the terms of which are simi­  
lar to thof¢ of the one last announced,  
except as to a small redu&amp;ion of char­  
ges. Another, on like terms for fix  
millions of florins, had been set on  
foot, under circumstances that assured  
immediate completion, :  
_ Gentlemen of the Senatey - i ¢ ;  
f * &#x27;TWO treaties which&#x27; have been pro­  
wvifionally concluded with the Chero­

and fatification,” ¢ 7 cniA  
Gem/é}#eﬁ of the. Hoyfe of Reprefentativves,  
IN’entering &quot;upon “the ‘difcharge of  
your Legislative trust;: you must antici­  
pate with pleasure, that many of the  
difficulties, neceffzrily ‘incident to the  
firft arrangement of a new government,  
for &#x27;an extensive icountry, have been  
h&#x27;a(fpil&#x27;y furtnounted by ‘the zealous and

‘upon principles equally comprehensive,

‘however, ‘is already known td afford an  
assurance that the views of that ad  
have been substantially fulfilled. The  
Aubfcription in the domestic debt of the  
United States, has embraced by far the

ford you leisure to resume them with  
advantage. !  
There are, however, fomeé of them  
of which I cannot forbear a more par-,&#x27;  
ticular mention—These are, the Mili­  
tia—The Poft-Office and Post-Roads—  
The Mint—Weights and measures—a  
Provision for the Sale of the Vacant  
Lands of the United States.  
The firft is certainly an obje&amp; of  
primary importance, whether viewed  
in reference to the national security,  
to the fatisfaion of the community, or  
the preservation of order. In connec­  
tion with this, the eftablithment of  
competent magazines and arsenals, and  
the fortification of such (})laces as are  
peculiarly important and vulnerable,  
naturally present themselves to consi­  
deration. The fafety of the United  
States, under divine protetion, ought  
to rest on the basis of systematic and  
solid arrangement ; exposed as little as  
possible to the hazards of fortuitous  
circumstances.  
The importance of the Poft-Office  
and Post-Roads, on, a plan fufficiently  
liberal and comprehensive, as they re­  
fpec the expedition, fafety and facility  
of communication, is encreafed by the  
instrumentality in diffufing a know­  
ledge of the laws and proceedings of  
the government ; which, while it con­  
tribdtes to the security of the people,  
serves also to guard them against the  
effets of misrepresentation and miscon­  
ception. The establishment of addi­  
tional cross-posts, especially to some of  
the important points in the western and  
northern parts of the Union, cannot fail  
to be of material utility.,  
The disorders in the existing curren­  
cy, and especially the scarcity of f{mall  
change, a fearcity so peculiarly distres­  
sing to the t!‘)oore:r clafles, {trongly re­  
commend the carrying into immediate  
effet the resolution already entered into  
concerning the eftablithment of a Mint,  
Measures have been taken pursuant to  
that resolution for procuring some of  
the most neceflary articles, together  
with the requisite aparatus.  
An uniformity in the weights and  
measures of the country is among the  
important obje&amp;ts submitted to you by  
the Constitution, and if it can be de­  
rived from a standard at once invariable  
and universal, must be no less honorable  
to the public councils than conducive  
to the pußlic convenience.  
A provision for the sale of the vacant  
lands of the United States, is particu­  
larly urged, amonF other reasons, by  
the important considerations —that they  
are pledged as a fund for “reimbursing  
the public debt ;—that if timely and  
judiciously applied they may save the  
neceflity of burtheningour citizens with  
new taxes for the extinguifhment of the  
principal ; and that being free to dis­  
charge the principal, but in a limiited  
proportion, no opportunity ought to be  
loft for availing the public of its rights.

Oétober 25, 1791.  
  
Fellow-citizens of the Senate, and of the  
Houte of Reprefentatives.  
MEET you, upon the prefent occa-  
fion, with the feelings which are na-  
turally infpired by a ftrong impyeflion of  
the profperous fituation of our common  
country, and by a perfuafion equally ftrong,  
that the labours of the feffion, which has  
jut commenced, will, under the guidance  
of a fpirit no lefs prudent than patriotic,  
iffue in meafures conducive to the ttability  
and increafe of national property.  
  
Numerous as are the providential blef-  
fings which demand our grateful acknow-  
ledgments, the abundarce with which  
another year has again rewarded the in-  
duitry of the hufbandman is too important  
to efcapz recolleéticn.  
  
Your own obfératians in your refpeStive  
fituations will have fatisfied you of the  
progreflive ftate of agriculture, manufac-  
tures, commerce, and nav gation. In  
tracing their caules, you” will have re-  
murked with particular ples sre the happy  
  
  
  
eileéts of that revival of confidence, pul  
hic as well as private, to which the con-  
  
ftitution and laws of the united {tates  
have fo eminently contibuted; ard you  
will obferve, with no lefS intereft, new and  
decifive proofs of the increafing reputation  
and credit of the nation. But ycu, ne-  
verthelefs, cannot fail to derive fatisfaSt&#x27;on  
from the confirmation of thefe circum-  
ftances, which will be difclofed in the  
feveral official communications that will be  
made to you in the courle of your deli-  
berations.  
  
The rapid fubferipticns to the bank of  
the united itates, which completed the fum  
allowed to be fubfcribed in a fingle day, is  
among the ftrking and pleafing evidences  
which prefent themfeives, not only of con-  
fidence in the government, but of refource

450 THE UNIVERSAL M/.GAZINE  
  
Accordingly, at the fame time that  
treaties have been provifionally concluded,  
and other proper means ufed to attach the  
wavering, and to confirm in their friend-  
fhip the well-difpofed tribes of Indians—  
effeCtual meafures have been adopted to  
make thofe of a hoftile deftription fenfible,  
that a pacification was defired upon terms  
of moderation and jultice.  
  
Thefe meafwes having proved unfuccels-  
ful, it became neceffary to convince the  
refractory of the power of he united ftates  
to punifh thew depredations: offenfive  
operations have therefore been directed—to  
be conduéted, however, as confiftently as  
pofiibie with the diciates of humanity.  
some oi thefe have been crowned with  
full fuccefs, and others are yet depending.  
The expeditions which have -been com-  
pleted were carried on under the authority,  
and at the expence of the united ttates, by  
the militia of Kentucky, whofe enterprife,  
intrepidity, and good conduét, are enutled  
to peculias commendation.  
  
Oveitu es of peace are ftill continued to  
the de.uded tribes, and confiderable num-  
bers of individuals belonging to them have  
Jately renounced all further oppotition, re-  
moved from their former fituations, ard  
pieced themfelves under the immediate pro-  
tection of the united fates.  
  
It is fincerely to be defired, that all need  
of coerc:on in fusure may ceale, and that  
an int&#x27;mate intercourfe may fuccced, cal-  
culated to advance the happinefS of the  
Indians, and to attach them firmly to the  
united ttates.  
  
In order to this, it feems neceffary—  
That they fhould experience the benefits of  
  
an impartial difpenfation of juftice.  
  
That the mode of alienating their lands,  
the main fource of d {content and war,  
fhould be fo defined and regulated as to  
obviaie impofition, and, as far as may  
be practicable, controverly concerning  
the reality and extent of the alienat‘ons  
which are made.  
  
That commerce with them fhould be pro-  
hibited uncer reguiations tending to fe-  
cure an equiable deportment toward  
them, and chat fuch raticnal experi-  
ments iould be made for imparting to  
them the b’efling: of civilization as may  
from time to time fuit their condition.  
  
That the executive of the united ftates  
fhould be enzb&#x27;ed to employ the means  
to which the Indians have becn long ac-  
cuftomed, for uniting their immediate  
interefis with the prefervation of pe.ce.  
And  
  
That efiicacicrs prov:fion fhould be made  
  
for infli&amp;ting adequate penalties upon aff  
  
thofe who, by violating their rights,,  
  
fhall infringe the treaties, and endanger  
the peace of the union.  
  
A {fyitem correfponding with the mild  
principles of religion and philanthropy  
toward an unenlightened race of men,  
whofe happinefs materially depends on the  
conduét of the united ftates, would be as  
honourable to the national charaéter, as  
conformable to the dictates of found policy.  
  
The powers {pecially vefted in me by the  
act laying certain duties on diftilled {pirits,  
which reipeét the fub-divifions of the dif-  
tris into furveys, the appointment of of-  
ficers, and the affignment of compenia-  
tions, have likewile been carried into effect.  
In a matter, in which both materials and  
experience were wanting to guide the cal-  
culation, it will be readily conceived that  
there muft have been difficulty in fuch an  
adjuftment of the rates of compenfation,  
as would conciliate a reafonable compe-  
tency, with a proper regard to the limits  
prelcribed by the law. It is hoped, that  
the circumfpeétion which has been ued,  
will be found in the refult to have fecured  
the lait of the two objects ; but it is pro-  
bable, that with a view to the firft, in fome  
inftances, a revilion of the provifion will  
be found advifable.  
  
The impreffions with which this law has  
been received by the community have been,  
upon the whole, fuch as were to be ex-  
pected among enlightened and well-dif-  
pofed citizens, from the propriety and ne-  
ceffity of the meafure. The novelty,  
however, of the tax, in a confiderable part  
of the united flates, and a mifconception of  
fome of its provifions, have given occafion,  
in particular places, to fome degree of dif-  
content. But it is fatisfactory to know,  
that this difpofiticn yields to proper exp&#x27;a-  
nations and more ju!t apprehenfions of the  
true nature of the law. And [ entertain  
a full confidence that it will, in all, give  
way to motives which arile out of a juit  
fenfe of duty, and a virtuous regard to the  
public welfare.  
  
It there are any circumftances in the  
law, which, confittently with its main de-  
fign, may be fo var&#x27;ed as to remove ary  
well. intentioned objeftions that may happen  
to exift, it will confift with a wife mode-  
ration to make the proper variations. It  
is defirable, on all occafions, to unite, with  
a ftedy and firm adterence to conttirutional  
and necefla&#x27;y ‘Séts cf government, the  
fulleft evidence ef a difpofition, as far as  
may be practicable, to confult the withes

FOR DECEMBER, 1791: 4gt  
  
lay the foundation of the public adminif-  
tration in the affe&amp;tions of the people.  
  
Purfuant to the authority contained in  
the feveral aéts on that fubject, a diftri€t of  
ten miles {quare, for the permanent feat of  
the government of the united (tates, has been  
fixed and announced by proclamation ; which  
diftri&amp; will comprenend lands on both  
fides of the river Potowmac, and the towns  
of Alexandria and George-town. A city  
has alfo been laid out, agreeable to a plan  
which will be placed befere Congrefs: and  
as there is a profpect, favoured by the rate  
of fales which have already taken place, of  
ample funds for carrying on the neceffary  
buildings, there is every expettation of  
their due progrefs.  
  
The completion of the cenfus of the in-  
habitants, for which provifion was made by  
law, has been duly notified (excepting in  
one inftance, in which the return has been  
informal; and another, in which it has  
been omitted or mifcarried); and the re-  
turns of the officers who were charged  
with this duty, which will be laid betore  
you, will give you the pleafing aflurance,  
that the prefent population of the united  
ftates borders on four millions of perfons.  
  
It is proper alfo to inform you, that a  
further loan of two millions and a half of  
florins has been completed in Holland, the  
terms of which are fimilar to thofe of the  
one laft announced, except as to a fmall  
reduétion of charges. Another, on like  
terms,. for fix millions-of florins, had been  
fet on foot, under circumftances that affured  
immediate completion.  
  
Gentlemen-of the Senate,  
  
Two treaties which have been provifion-  
ally concluded.with the Cherokees, and fix  
nations of Indians, will be laid before you  
for your confideration and ratification.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houle of Repreftn-  
tatives,  
  
In entering upon the difeharge of your  
legiflative tru&amp;, you miuft anticipate with  
pleafure, that many of the difficulties, ne-  
ceflarily incident to the&#x27;firtt arrangement of  
a new government for an extenfive coun-  
try, have been happily furmounted by the  
zealous and judicious exertions of your  
predeceffors in co-operation with the other  
branch of the légitlature. “The important  
obje&amp;ts which remain to be accomplithed,  
will, I am perfuaded, be conducted upon  
principles: equally comprehenfive, and  
equally well calculated for the advancement  
of the general’ weal.  
  
The time limited for receiving fubfcrip-  
tions to the loans propofed by the a&amp;  
making provifion for the debt of the united  
  
ftates having expired, ftatements from the  
proper department will, as foon as pofli-  
ble, apprife you of the exaét refult.  
Enough, however, is already known, to  
afford an aflurance that the views of that  
aét have been fubftantially fulfilled. The  
fubfcription in the domeftjc debt of the  
united ftates has embraced by far the  
greatelt proportion of that debt ; affording,  
at the fame time, proof of the general fa-  
tisfaétion of the public creditors with the  
fyitem which has been propofed to their  
acceptance, and of the fpirit of accommo-  
dation to the convenience of the govern  
ment with which they are aétuated. The  
fub{criptions in the debts of the refpe&amp;tive  
ftates, as far as the provifions of the law  
have permitted, may be faid to be yet more  
general. The part of the debt of the  
united {tates which remains unfubfcribed  
will naturally engage your further delibe»  
rations,  
  
It is particularly pleafing to me to be  
able to announce to you, that the revenues  
which have been eftablifhed promife to be  
adequate to their objects, and may be per-  
mitted, if no unforeféen exigency occurs,  
to fuperfede, for the prefent, the neceffity  
of any new burthens upon our conftituents.  
  
An obje€&amp;t which will claim your early  
attention, is a provifion for the turrent  
fervice of the enfuing year, together with  
fuch afcertained demands upon the treafury  
as require to be immediately di‘charged,  
and. fuch cafualties as may have arifen in  
the execution of the public bufinefs, for  
which no {pecific appropriation may have  
yet been made ; all of which a proper efti-  
mate will be laid before you.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the  
  
Houle of Reprefentatives,  
  
T fhall content myfelf with a general re-  
ference to former communcations for fe-  
veral objects, upon which the urgency of  
other affairs has hitherto poftponed any de-  
finitive refolution :—their importance will  
recal them to your attention ; and I trutt  
that the progrefs already made in the moft  
arduous arrangements of the government  
will afford you leifure to refume them with  
advantage.  
  
There are, however, fome of them, of  
which I cannot forbear a more particular  
mention—thefe are, the militia~-the poft-  
office and poft-roads—the mint—werghts  
and meafures—a provilion for the fale of  
the vacant lands of the united ftates.  
  
The firft is certainly an objeét of primary  
importance, whether viewed in reference to  
the national fecurity, to the fatisfaétion of  
the community, ox to the preferyation of:  
  
3L2 order,

452 THE UNIVERSAL MAGAZINE  
  
order. In connexion with this, the efta-  
blifhment of competent magazines and ar-  
fenals, and the foriification of fuch places  
as are peculiarly important and vulnerable,  
natually prefent themfelves to confidera-  
tion. The fafety of the united fates,  
under divine protection, ought to reit on the  
baiis of tyftematic and folid arrangement,  
expoled as litle as poihible to&#x27;the hazards  
of fortuitous circumttances.  
  
The importance of the poft-office and  
polt-roads, on a plan fufficiently liberal  
and comprchenfive, as they refpeét the ex-  
pedition, fafety, and tacility of commu-  
nication, 1s mereafed by the initrumentality  
in diffuling a knowledge of the laws and  
proceedings of the government, which,  
while it contributes to the fecurity of the  
people, ferves alfa to guaid them againtt  
the effects of milreprefentation and mifcon-  
ception. The ettabluhiment of additional  
cro.:-potis, efpecially to fome of the im-  
portant poir&#x27;s in the Weltern and North-  
ern parts of the union, cannot fail to be of  
materi¢] utility.  
  
The diforders in the exifting currency,  
and efpecially the {careity of {mall change,  
a {fcacity fo peculjarly diftrefling to the  
  
poorer claffes, ftrongly recommend the  
cairying into immediate effect the refolu-  
ticn already entered into concerning the  
eftablifhment of a mint. Meafures have  
been taken purfuant to that refolution for  
procuring fome of the moft neceflary arti-  
cles, together with the requifite apparatus.  
  
An uniformity in the weights and mea-  
fures of the country is among the impor-  
tant objects fubmitted to you by the con-  
ftitution ; and if it can be derived from a  
ftandard at once invariable and univerfal,  
mutt be no lefs honourable to the public  
councils than conducive to the public con-  
venience.  
  
A provifion for the fale of the vacant  
lands of the united ftates is particularly  
urged, among other reafons, by the impor-  
tant confiderations—that they are pledged  
as a fund for reimburfing the public debt —  
that, if timely and judicioufly applied,  
they may fave the neceflity of burdening  
our citizens with new taxes for the extin-  
guifhment of the principal—and that, bemg  
free to difcharge the principal but in a |i-  
mited proportion, no opportunity ought to  
be loit for availing the public of its rights.

That the Executive Powerof the United States  
fhould be enabled to employ the means to  
which the Indians have been long accufe  
tomed, for uniting their immediate ine  
terefts with the prefervation of peaces  
And  
  
That efficacious provifion fhould be made for  
inflicting adequate penalties upon all thofe  
who, by violating their rights, fhall ine  
fringe the treaties, and endanger the peace  
of the Union.  
  
A fyftem correfponding with the mild  
principles of religion and philanthropy to  
wards an unenlightened race of men, whofe  
happinefs materially depends on the conduét  
of the United States, would be as. honour-  
able to the national character as conformable  
to the di¢tates of found policy.  
  
The powers {pecially vefted in me by the  
aét laying certain duties on diftilled {pirits,  
which retpeét the fub-divifions of the dif+  
triéts into furveys, the appointment of of  
ficers, and the ailigument of compenfations,  
have likewife been carried into effet. Ina  
matter in which both materials and expe-  
rience were wanting to guide the calcula-  
tion, it will be readily conceived that there  
muft have been difficulty in fuch an adjuft-  
ment of the rates of compenfation, as would  
conciliate a reafonable competency, with @  
proper regard to the limits prefcribed by the  
law. It is hoped, that the circumfpedction  
which has been ufed willbe found in the re«  
fult to have fecured the laft of the two ob-  
jets ; but it is probable, that with a view to  
the firft, in fome inftances, a revifion of the  
provifion will be found advifable.  
  
The impreffions with which this law has  
been received-by the community have beens  
upon the whole, fucl as were to be expect~  
ed among enlightened and well-difpofed citi-  
zens, from t..e propriety and neceffity of the  
meafure. The novelty, however, of the tax,  
in a confiderable part of the United States,  
and a mifconception of fome of its provi-  
fions, have given oceafion, in particular  
places, to fome degree of difcontent. But it  
is fatisfaGtory to know, that this difpofition  
yields to proper explanations and more jult  
apprehenfions of the true nature of the law ;  
and 1 entertain a full confidence that it will,  
in all, give way to motives which arife out  
of a jutt fenfe of duty, and a virtuous regard  
to the public welfare,

be fo varied as to remove any well-inten-  
tioned obje€tions that may—happen to exift,  
it will confift witha wife moderation to make  
  
the proper variations. It is defirable, on all  
occafions, to unite, with a fteady and firm  
adherence to conftitutional and neceffary acts  
of government, the fulleft evidence of a dif-  
pofition, as far as may be praticable, to con-  
fult the wifhes of every part of the commu.  
. ity, and to lay the foundations of the pubtic  
adminiftration in the affections of the people.  
  
Purfoant to the authority contained in the  
feveral aéts on that fubjeét, a diftriGt of ten  
miles fquare; for the permanent feat of the  
government of the United States, has been  
fixed, and announced by proclamation ; which  
aittri&amp;t will compreherid lands on both fides  
of the river Potowmac, arid the towns of  
Alexandria and George-town. A ‘city has  
alfo been laid out; agreeably toa plan which  
will be placed before Congrefs : and as there  
is a ted 4 favoured by the rate of fales  
which have already taken place, of ample  
funds for carrying on the neceffary buildings,  
there is every expectation of their due  
  
The completion of the cenfus of the inha-  
bitants, for which provifion was made by  
law, has been duly notified (excepting in one  
inftance, in which the return had been in-  
formal ; and another, in which it has been  
omitted or mifcarried); and the returns of  
the officers who were charged with this duty,  
which will be laid before you, will give you  
the pleafing affurance, that the prefent popu-  
lation,of the United States borders on four  
millions of perfons.  
  
it is properalfo to inform you, that a fur+  
ther loan of two millions and a half of florins  
has been completed in Holland, the terms of  
which are fimilar to thofe of the one laft an-  
nounced, except as to a fmall reduction of  
charges. Another, on like terms, for fix  
millions! of florins, had been fet on foot, un-  
der circumftances that affured immediate  
completion.  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate,  
  
Two treaties which have heen provifio-  
nally concluded with the Cherokees, and fix  
nations of Indians, will be laid before you for  
your confideration and ratification.  
  
Gantlemen of the Houfe of Reprefentatives,  
  
In entering upon the ditcharge of your le-  
giflative truft, you muft anticipate with plea-  
fure, that many of the difficulties, neceflarily  
’ jncident to the firft arrangement of anew go-  
vernment for an extenfive country, have been  
happily furmounted by the zealous and judi-  
cious exertions of your predeceffors in co-  
operation with the other branch of the le-  
giflature. The important objects which re-  
main to be accomplifhed will, 1 am per-  
fuaded, be conducted upon principles equally  
comprehenfive, and equally well calculated  
for the advanc ment of the general weal,  
  
The time limited for receiving fub{crip-  
  
  
  
[Jans  
tions to the loans propofed by the aét making  
provifion for the debt of the United States  
having expired, ftatements from the proper  
department will, as foon as poffible, apprife  
you of the exact refult. Enough, however,  
is already known, to afford an affurance that  
the views of that act have been fubftantially  
fulfilled. The fubfcription ia the domettic  
debt of the United States has embraced by far  
the greateft proportion of that debt ; afford.  
ing, at the fame time, proof of the general  
fatisfa&amp;tion of the public creditors with the  
fyflem which has been propofed to their ace  
ceptance, and of the fpirit of accommodation  
to the convenience of government with which  
they are actuated. The fubfcriptions in the  
debts of the refpeétive States, as far as the  
provifions of the law have permitted, may  
be faid to be yet more general. The part of  
the debt of the United States which remaing  
unfub{cribed will naturally engage your fur.  
ther deliberations.  
  
It is particularly pleafing to me to be able  
to announce to you, that the revenues which  
have been eftablifhed promife to be adequate  
to their objeéts, and may be permitted, if no  
unforefeen exigency occurs, to fuperfede, for  
the prefent, the neceflity of any new bur-  
thens upon our conftituents.  
  
An object which willclaim your early at-  
tention, is a provifion for the eurrent fervice  
of the enfuing year, together with fuch af  
certained demands upon the Treafury as re«  
quire to be immediately difcharged, and fuch  
cafualties as may have arifen in the execution  
of the public bafinefs, for which no fpecific  
appropriation may have yet been made; of  
all which a proper eftimate will be laid be-  
fore you. :  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the Houft  
  
. of Reprefentatives,  
  
1 thall content myfelf with a general refe-  
rence to former communications for feveral  
objeéts, upon which the urgency of other af&gt;  
fairs has hitherto poftponed any definitive ree  
folution :—their importance will recall them  
to your attention; and [ truft that the pro-  
grefs already made in the moft arduous ar-  
rangements of the Government will afford  
you leifure to refume them with advantage.  
  
There are, however, fome of them, of  
which 1 cannot forbear a more particular  
mention—thefe are, the militia—the poft-  
office and poft-roads—the mint—weights  
and meafures—a provifion for the fale of the  
vacant lands of the United States.  
  
The firft is certainly an object of primary  
importance, whether viewed in reference to  
the national fecurity, to the fatisfaétion of the  
community, or to the prefervation of order,  
In connexion with this, the eftablifhment of  
competent magazines and arfenals, and the  
fortification of fuch places as are peculiarly  
important and vulnerable, naturally prefeat  
themfelves to confideration. The fafety of  
the United States, under Divine protection,

folid arrangement, expofed as little as poffible  
to the hazards of fortuitous circumftances.  
  
The importance of the poft-office and  
poft-roads, on a plan fufficiently liberal and  
comprehenfive, as they refpect the expedi-  
tion, fafety, and facility of communication, is  
increafed by the inftrumentality in diffufing a  
knowledge of the laws and proceedings of  
the Government, which, while it contributes  
to the fecurity of the people, ferves aifo to  
guard them againft the effeéts of mifrepre-  
fentation and mifconception. The eftablifh-  
meiit of additional crofs-pofts, efpecially to  
fome of the important points in the Weftern  
and Northern parts of the Union, cannot fail  
tobe of material utility.  
  
The diforders in the exifting currency, and  
efpecially the fcarcity of fmall change, a fcar-  
city fo peculiarly diflreffing to the poorer  
daffes, ftrongly recommend the carrying in-  
to immediate effeét the refulution already ene  
tered into concerning the eftablifhment of a  
mint. Meafures have been taken purfuant to  
that refolution for procuring fome of the mott  
neceffary articles, together with the requi-  
fite apparatus. f  
  
An uniformity in the weights and mea-  
fures of the country is among the importaut  
objeéts fubmitted to you by the Conftitution ;  
and, if it can be derived from a ftandard at  
once invariable and univerfal, muft be no  
lefs honourable to the public councils than  
conducive to the public convenience.  
  
A provifion for the fale of the vacant lands  
of the United States is particularly urged,  
among other reafons, by the important con-  
fiderations—that they are pledged as a fund  
for reimburfing the public debt—that, if  
timely and judicioufly applied, they may fave  
the neceffity of burdening our citizens with  
new taxes for the extinguifhment of the prin-  
cipal-—and that, being free to difcharge the  
principal but in a limited proportion, no op-  
portunity ought to be loft for availing the  
public of its rights. G. WASHINGTON

Your own obfervations in your refpedctive  
fituations will have fatishied you of the pro-  
greflive ſtate of agriculture, manpfactures,  
commerce, and navigation. In tracing  
their caufes, you will have remarked with  
particular pleafure the happy effects of that  
revival of confidence, public, as weil ap  
private, to which the conftitution and laws  
of the united ftates have fo eminently con-  
tributed ; and you will obferve, with no  
leſs intereft, new and decifive proofs of  
the increafing reputaticn and credit of the  
nation. But you, neverthelefs, cannot fail  
to derive fatisiaction from the confirmation  
of thefe circumftances, which will be dif-  
clofed in the feveral official communications  
that will be made to you in. the courfe of  
your deliberations.  
  
The rapid fubfcriptions to the bank of ©  
  
the united ftates, which completed the fum  
alowed to be fub{cribed in a fingle day, .is  
among the firiking and pleafing evidences  
which prefent themfelves, not only.of con-  
fidence in the government, but of refource  
in the community.  
  
In the interval of your recefs, due atten-  
tion has been paid to the execution of the  
different objects which were {pecially pro-  
vided for by the laws and refolutions of the  
laft feffion.  
  
Among the moft important of thefe is  
the defence and fecurity of the _Weftern  
frontiers. To accomplifh it on the moft  
humane principjes, was a primary wih.  
  
Accordingly, at the fame time that trea-  
ties have been provifionally concluded, and  
other proper means ufed to attach the  
Wayering, and to confirm in their friendhhip  
the well-difpofed tribes of Indians—effec-  
tual meafures bave been adopted to make  
thofe of a hoflile defoription fenfible, that a  
pacification was defired upon terms of mo-  
Geration and juftice.  
  
Thefe meatures having proved unfuccels-  
fel, it became neceflary to convince the  
refraory of the power of the united tates  
to punifh thew depredations: offenfive ope-  
rations have therefore been diredtyd—to be  
conducted, however, as confiltently as pof-

im the refult to have fecured the laft of the  
two objects; but it is probable, that with a  
view to the firft, in fome inftances, a  
revifion of the provifion will be found ad-  
vifeable.  
  
The impreffions with which this law has  
been received by the community have been,  
upon the whole, fuch as were to be expected  
among eelightened and well-difpofed citi-  
zens, from the propriety anu neceflity of  
the meafure. The novelty, however, of  
the tax, in a confiderable part of the united  
fiates, and a mifconception of fome of its  
  
vifions, have given occafion, in particu-  
  
places, to fome degree of difcontent.  
But it is fatisfatlory to know, that this  
difpofition yields to proper explanations and  
mor: juft apprehenfions of the true nature  
of the law. And I entertain a full- confi-  
dence that it will, in all, give way to mo-  
tives which arife out of ajuft fenfe of duty,  
—* a virtuous regard to the public wel-

If there are any circumftances in the  
law, which, confiftently with its main de-  
fign may be fo varied as to remoye any  
well intentioned objections that may happen  
to exift, it will confilt with a wife moderati-  
on to make the proper variations. It is  
defireable, on all occafions, to unite, with  
a ſteady and firm adherence to conftitutional  
aml neceflary adis of government, the  
fulleft evidence of a difpofition, as far as  
may. be practicable, to confult the withes  
of every part of the community, and to  
lay the foundation of the public adminiitra-  
tion in the affections of the people.  
  
Purfuant to the authority contained in the  
feveral adits on that ſubject, a diftrict of ten  
roiles fquare, for the permanent feat of the  
government of the united ftates, has been  
fixed and announced by proclamation ;  
which diflri&amp;t will comprehend lands on  
  
  
  
sbhoth fides of the river Poteowmac, and the  
  
towns of Alexandria and George-town.

Gentlemen of the Senate,  
  
Two treaties which have been provifion:  
aly concluded with the Cherokees, and fix:  
nations of Indians, will be laid before you  
for your confid: ration and ratification.  
  
Gentlemen of the Houfe of Reprefen-,  
tatives.  
  
In entering upon the difcharge of yout  
legiflative truft, you muft anticipate with  
pleafure, that: many of the difficulties, ne-  
ceflarily incident to the firft arrangement of  
anew government for an extenfive country,  
have been happily furntounted by the zea-  
lous and judicious exertions of your prede  
ceflors in co operation with the other branch  
of the legiflature. The important objects  
which remain to be accomplifhed, will, [  
am perfuaded, be conducted upon principles  
equally comprehenfive, and equally well.  
calculated for the advancement of the gene-  
ral weal. |  
  
The time limited for receiving fubfcrips  
  
tions to the loins propofed by the act make  
  
ing provifion for the debt of the united fates  
having expired; flatements from the proper  
departments will, as foon as pollible, ap-  
prila you of the exa&amp; relult. Enough,  
however, is already known, to afford an  
affurance that the views of that act have  
  
been fubftantially fulfilled. The fubfcription |  
  
in the domeftic debt of the united fates has  
embraced by far the greateft proportion ef  
that debt, aflording, at the fame time,  
proof of the gencral fatisfaction of the  
public creditors with the fyftem which  
has been propoled to their acceptance, and  
  
of the [piritof accommodation to the con+ |  
  
venicnce of the government with which they,  
are actuated. ‘The fubfcriptions in the

to their objedis, and may be permitted, if  
no unforefeen exigency occurs, to fuperfede,  
for the prefent, the neceflity of any new  
burthens upon our conftituents  
  
An object which will claim your early  
attention, is a provifion for the current fer-  
vice of the enfuing year, together with  
fych afcertained demands upon the treafury  
38 require immediately to be difchatged,  
and fuch cafualties as may have arifen in the  
execution of the public bufinels, for which  
no {pecific appropriation may have yet been  
made; all of which a proper eftimate will  
be laid before you. :  
  
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the Houle  
  
af Reprefentatives,  
  
1 tall content myfelf with a general re-  
ference to former communications for feveral  
objeéts, upons which the urgency of other  
athire has hitherto poftponed any definitive  
refolution : their importance will recal  
them to your attention ; and I truft that the  
progrefs already made in the molt arduous  
arrangements of the government will afford  
you leifure to refume them with advan-  
tage. &quot;  
  
There are, however, fome of them, of  
which I cannot forbear a more particular  
mention—thefe are, the militia—the poft-  
office and poft roads—the mint—weights  
and: meafures — a provifion for the fale of the  
vacant lands of the united fates.  
  
The firft is certainly an object of primary  
importance, whether viewed in reference to  
the national fecurity, to the fatisfaction of  
the community, or to the prefervation of  
In connexion with this, the ‘efta-  
blifhment of competent magazines and arfe-  
nals, and the fortification of fuch- places as  
are peculiarly important and vulnerable,  
naturally prefent themfelves to confideration.  
The fatety of the united ftates, under di.  
vine protection, ought to reft on the bafis of  
fyftematic and folid arrangement, expofed  
as little as poflitile to the hazards of fortuitous  
curcumftances. ;  
  
The importance of the poft-office and  
poit-roads, ona plan fufficiently liberal and  
comprehenfive, as they reſpect the expediti-  
on, ſafety, and facility of communicati-  
on, is increafed by the inftrumentality in  
diffufing a knowledge of the laws and pro.  
ceedings of the government, which, while  
it contributes to the fecurity of the people,  
ferves alf&gt; to guard them againft the effects  
of mifreprefentation and mifconception.  
The eftablithment of additional crofs-pofts,  
eſpecially to fome of the important points in  
the Weftern and. Northern parts of -the

The diforders in, the .exifting c  
and efpecially the fcarcity of {mall changes  
a f{carcity fo peculiarly diftrefling to th  
poorer clafles, ftrongly recommend the car-_  
rying into immediate effect the refolution  
already entered into concerning the eftablifh-  
ment of amint. Meafures have been taken  
  
urfuant to that refolution for procuring .  
fome of the moft neceflary articles, together  
with the requifite apparatus.  
  
An uniformity in the weights and mea-  
fures of the country is among the important  
objects fubmitted to you by the conftitution ;  
and if it can be derived from a ftandard at  
once invariable and univerial, muft be no  
lefs honourable to the public councils than  
conducive to the public convenience.  
  
A provifion for the fale of the vacant‘  
lands of the united flates is particularly  
urged, among other reafons, by the imper-  
tant confiderations—that they are pledged as.  
a fund for reimburfing the public debt-—that,  
if timely and judicioufly applied, they may  
fave the neceflity of burdening our citizens  
with new taxes for the extinguifhimient  
of the principal——and that, being free to  
difcharge the principal but in a limited pro-  
portion, nd epportunity’ ought to be lo®  
for availing the public of its rights.

were supplanted by men to whom faith and charity were  
unmeaning words, and in whose presence whole nations have  
melted away. It was in vain that, in his third Annual Address  
to the Republic, Washington proposed “ that efficacious pro-

all those who, by violating the rights of the Indians, shall  
infringe the treaties and endanger the peace of the Union.”

that “the spirit of party is itself a frightful despotism,” are  
not now popular in the United States; and the Sioux chiefs  
who lately appeared at the city of Washington, could tell his  
successor, General Grant, with truth, that his government only  
made treaties with the Indians to deceive, and only gave pro-  
mises to betray them. Yet among these Indians, who are
