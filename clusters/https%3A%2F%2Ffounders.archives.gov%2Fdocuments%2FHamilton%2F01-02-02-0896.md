[Preakness, New Jersey, October 11, 1780]   
  
[1]   Since my return from Hartford, my Dear Laurens, my mind has been too little at ease to permit me to write to you sooner. It has been wholly occupied by the affecting and tragic consequences of Arnold’s treason. My feelings were never put to so severe a trial. You will no doubt have heard the principal facts before this reaches you; but there are particulars, to which my situation gave me access, that cannot have come to your knowlege from public report, which I am persuaded you will find interesting.  
[2]   From several circumstances, the project seems to have originated with Arnold himself and to have been long premeditated. The first overture is traced back to some time in June last. It was conveyed in a letter to Col. Robinson; the substance of which was, that the ingratitude he had experienced from his country, concurring, with other causes, had intirely changed his principles, that he now only sought to restore himself to the favour of his king, by some signal proof of his repentance, and would be happy to open a correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton for that purpose. About this period he made a journey to Connecticut, on his return from which to Philadelphia, he solicited the command of West Point; alleging that the effects of his wound had disqualified him for the active duties of the field. The sacrifice of this important post was the atonement he intended to make. General Washington hesitated the less to gratify an officer who had rendered such eminent services, as he was convinced the post might be safely trusted to one, who had given so many distinguished specimens of his bravery. In the beginning of August, he joined the army, and renewed his application. The enemy, at this juncture, had embarked the greatest part of their force on an expedition to Rhode Island; and our army was in motion to compel them to relinquish the enterprise or to attack New York in its weakened state. The General offered Arnold the left wing of the army; which he declined on the pretext already mentioned, but not without visible embarrassment. He certainly might have executed the duties of such a temporary command, and it was expected from his enterprising temper, that he would gladly have embraced so splendid an opportunity. But he did not choose to be diverted a moment from his favourite object, probably from an apprehension, that some different disposition might have taken place, which would have excluded him. The extreme solicitude he discovered to get possession of the post, would have led to a suspicion of the treachery, had it been possible from his past conduct to have supposed him capable of it.  
[3]   The correspondence thus begun was carried on between Arnold and Major André Adjutant General to the British army, in behalf of Sir Henry Clinton, under feigned signatures and in a mercantile disguise. In an intercepted letter of Arnold which lately fell into our hands he proposes an interview, “to settle the risks and profits of the copartnership”; and in the same stile of metaphor, intimates an expected augmentation of the garrison, and speaks of it as the means of extending their traffic. It appears by another letter that André was to have met him on the lines, under the sanction of a flag in the character of Mr. John Anderson. But some cause, or other, not known, prevented this interview.  
[4]   The 20th. of last month Robinson and André went up the River in the Vulture Sloop of War. Robinson sent a flag to Arnold with two letters; one to General Putnam inclosed in another to himself; proposing an interview with Putnam, or in his absence, with Arnold, to adjust some private concerns. The one to General Putnam was evidently meant as a cover to the other, in case by accident, the letters should have fallen under the inspection of a third person.  
[5]   General Washington crossed the river, in his way to Hartford, the day these dispatches arrived. Arnold conceiving he must have  heard of the flag, thought it necessary for the sake of appearances, to submit the letters to him and ask his opinion of the propriety of ⟨comply⟩ing with the request. The General with his usual caution, though without the least surmise of the design, dissuaded him from it, and advised him to reply to Robinson, that whatever related to his private affairs, must be of a civil nature, and could only properly be addressed to the civil authority. This reference fortunately deranged the plan and was the first link in the chain of events that led to the detection. The interview could no longer take place, in the form of a flag, but was obliged to be managed in a secret manner.   
[6]   Arnold employed one Smith to go on Board the Vulture the night of the 22d to bring André on shore with a pass for Mr. John Anderson. André came ashore accordingly, and was conducted within a picket of ours to the house of Smith, where Arnold and he remained together in close conference all that night and the day following. At day light in the morning, the commanding officer at Kings ferry, without the privity of Arnold moved a couple of pieces of cannon to a point opposite to where the vulture lay and obliged her to take a more remote station. This event, or some lurking distrust, made the boatmen refuse to convey the two passengers back, and disconcerted Arnold so much, that by one of those strokes of infatuation, which often confound the schemes of men conscious of guilt, he insisted on André’s exchanging his uniform for a disguise, and returning in a mode different from that in which he came. André who had been undesignedly brought within our posts in the first instance remonstrated warmly against this new and dangerous expedient. But Arnold persisting in declaring it impossible for him to return as he came, he at length reluctantly yielded to his direction. Smith furnished the disguise, and in the evening passed Kings ferry with him and proceeded to Crompond where they stopped the remainder of the night (at the instance of a militia officer) to avoid being suspected by him. The next morning they resumed their journey Smith accompanying André a little beyond Pine’s bridge, where he left him. He had reached Tarry town, when he was taken up by three militia men, who rushed out of the woods and seized his horse.  
  
[7]   At this critical moment his presence of mind forsook him. Instead of producing his pass which would have extricated him from our parties and could have done him no harm with his own, he asked the militia men, if they were of the upper or lower party, distinctive appellations known among the enemy’s refugee corps. The Militia men replied they were of the lower party; upon which he told them he was a British officer and pressed them not to detain him, as he was upon urgent business. This confession removed all doubt; and it was in vain he afterwards produced his pass. He was instantly forced off to a place of greater security; where after a careful search there were founded concealed in the feet of his stockings several papers of importance delivered to him by Arnold; among these were a plan of the fortifications of West Point, a memorial from the Engineer on the attack and defence of the place, returns of the garrison, cannon and stores, copy of the minutes of a council of war held by General Washington a few Weeks before. The prisoner at first was inadvertently ordered to Arnold; but on recollection, while still on the way, he was countermanded, and sent to old Salem. The papers were inclosed in a letter to General Washington, which having taken a route different from the one he returned by, made a circuit, that afforded leisure for another letter, through an illjudged delicacy written to Arnold with information of Anderson’s capture, to get to him an hour before General Washington’s arrival at his quarters, time enough to elude the fate that awaited him. He went down the river in his barge to the vulture, with such precipitate confusion, that he did not take with him a single paper useful to the enemy. On the first notice of the affair he was persued, but much too late to be overtaken.  
[9]   Arnold a moment before his setting out, went into Mrs. Arnold’s apartment and informed her that some transactions had just come to light which must for ever banish him from his country. She fell into a swoon, at this declaration; and he left her in it to consult his own safety, ’till the servants alarmed by her cries came to her relief. She remained frantic all day, accusing every one who approached her with an intention to murder her child (an infant in her arms) and exhibiting every other mark of the most genuine and agonising distress. Exhausted by the fatigue and tumult of her spirits, her phrenzy subsided towards evening and she sunk into all the sadness of affliction. It was impossible not to have been touched with her situation; every thing affected in female tears, or in the misfortunes of beauty, every thing pathetic in the wounded tenderness of a wife, or in the apprehensive fondness of a mother, and, ’till I have reason to change the opinion, I will add, every thing amiable in suffering innocence conspired to make her an object of sympathy to all who were present. She experienced the most delicate attentions and every friendly office ’till her departure for Philadelphia.

  André was without loss of time conducted to the Head Quarters of the army, where he was immediately brought before a board of General Officers, to prevent all possibility of misrepresentation or cavil on the part of the enemy. The Board reported, that he ought to be considered as a spy and according to the laws and usages of nations to suffer death; which was executed two days after.  
[11]   Never perhaps did any man suffer death with more justice, or deserve it less. The first step he took after his capture was to write a letter to General Washington conceived in terms of dignity without insolence and apology without meanness. The scope of it was to vindicate himself from the imputation of having assumed a mean character for treacherous or interested purposes; asserting that he had been involuntarily an impostor, that contrary to his intentions, which was to meet a person for intelligence on neutral ground, he had been betrayed within our posts and forced into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise, soliciting only that to whatever rigor policy might devote him a decency of treatment might be observed, due to a person who though unfortunate had been guilty of nothing dishonorable. His request was granted in its full extent, for in the whole progress of the affair, he was treated with the most scrupulous delicacy. When brought before the Board of Officers, he met with every mark of indulgence and was required to answer no interrogatory, which could even embarrass his feelings. On his part, while he carefully concealed everything that might involve others, he frankly confessed all the facts relating to himself; and upon his confession without the trouble of examining a witness, the Board made their report. The members of it were not more impressed with the candor and firmness mixed with a becoming sensibility, which he displayed than he was penetrated with their liberality and politeness. He acknowleged the generosity of the behaviour towards him, in every respect, but particularly in this, in the strongest terms of manly gratitude. In a conversation with a Gentleman who visited him after his trial, he said he flattered himself he had never been illiberal; but if there were any remains of prejudice, in his mind, his present experience must obliterate them.  
[12]   In one of the visits I made to him (and I saw him several times during his confinement) he begged me to be the bearer of a request to the General for permission, to send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton. “I foresee my fate (said he) and though I pretend not to play the hero, or to be indifferent about life; yet I am reconciled to whatever may happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon me. There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity—Sir Henry Clinton has been too good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness. I am bound to him by too many obligations and love him too well to bear the thought, that he should reproach himself, or that others should reproach him, on the supposition of my having conceived myself obliged by his instructions to run the risk I did. I would not for the world leave a sting in his mind, that should embitter his future days.” He could scarce finish the sentence, bursting into tears, in spite of his efforts to suppress them; and with difficulty collected himself enough afterwards to add, “I wish to be permitted to assure him, I did not act under this impression, but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me as contrary to my own inclination as to his orders.” His request was readily complied with, and he wrote the letter annexed, and with which I dare say, you will ⟨be as⟩ much pleased as I am both for the dic⟨tion⟩ and sentiment.  
[15]   There was something singularly interesting in the character and fortunes of André. To an excellent understanding well improved by education and travel, he united a peculiar elegance of mind and manners, and the advantage of a pleasing person. ’Tis said he possessed a pretty taste for the fine arts, and had himself attained some proficiency in poe⟨try,⟩ music and painting. His knowlege appeared without ostentation, and embellished by a diffidence, that rarely accompanies so many talents and accomplishments, which left you to suppose more than appeared. His sentiments were elevated and inspired esteem. they had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocution was handsome; his address easy, polite and insinuating. By his merit he had acquired the unlimited confidence of his general and was making a rapid progress in military rank and reputation. But in the height of his career, flushed with new hope from the execution of a project the most beneficial to his party, that could be devised, he was at once precipitated from the summit of prosperity and saw all the expectations of his ambition blasted and himself ruined.  
[16]   The character I have given of him is drawn partly from what I saw of him myself and partly from information. I am aware that a man of real merit is never seen in so favourable a light, as through the medium of adversity. The clouds that surround him are shades that set off his good qualities. Misfortune cuts down the little vanities, that in prosperous times served as so many spots in his virtues; and gives a tone of humility that makes his worth more amiable. His spectators who enjoy a happier lot are less prone to detract from it, through envy, and are more disposed by compassion to give him the credit he deserves and perhaps even to magnify it.  
[17]   I speak not of André’s conduct in this affair as a Philosophe, but as a man of the world. The authorised maxims and practices of war are the satire of human nature. They countenance almost every species of seduction as well as violence; and the General that can make most traitors in the army of his adversary is frequently most applauded. On this scale we acquit André, while we could not but condemn him, if we were to examine his conduct by the sober rules of philosophy and moral rectitude. It is however a blemish in his fame, that he once intended to prostitute a flag; about this a man of nice honor ought to have had a scruple, but the temptation was great; let his misfortunes cast a veil over his error.  
[13]   When his sentence was announced to him, he remarked, that since it was his lot to die there was still a choice in the mode which would make a material difference to his feelings, and he would be happy, if possible, to be indulged with a professional death. He made a second application by letter in concise, but persuasive terms. It was thought this indulgence being incompatible with the customs of war could not be granted and it was therefore determined in both cases to evade an answer to spare him the sensations, which a certain knowlege of the intended mode would inflict.  
[14]   In going to the place of execution, he bowed familiarly as he went along to all those with whom he had been acquainted in his confinement. A smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude of his mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, he asked with some emotion, must I then die in this manner? He was told it had been unavoidable. “I am reconciled to my fate (said he) but not to the mode.” Soon however recollecting himself, he added, “it will be but a momentary pang,” and springing upon the cart performed the last offices to himself with a composure that excited the admiration and melted the hearts of the beholders. Upon being told the final moment was at hand, and asked if he had any thing to say, he answered: “nothing, but to request you will witness to the world, that I die like a brave man.” Among the extra ordinary circumstances that attended him, in the midst of his enemies, he died universally esteemed and universally regretted.  
[18]   Several letters from Sir Henry Clinton and others were received in the course of the affair, feebly attempting to prove, that André came out under the protection of a flag, with a passport from a general officer in actual service, and consequently could not be justly detained. Clinton sent a deputation composed of Lt General Robinson, Mr. Elliot and Mr. William Smith to represent as he said the true state of Major André’s case. General Greene met Robinson &amp; had a conversation with him, in which he reiterated the pretence of a flag, urged André’s release as a personal favour to Sir Henry Clinton, and offered any friend of ours in their power in exchange. Nothing could have been more frivolous than the plea which was used. The fact was that besides the time, manner, object of the interview, change of dress, and other circumstances, there was not a single formality customary with flaggs and the passport was not to Major André, but to Mr. Anderson. But had there been, on the contrary, all the formalities, it would be an abuse of language to say, that the sanction of a flag for corrupting an officer to betray his trust ought to be respected. So unjustifiable a purpose would not only destroy its validity but make it an aggravation.  
[19]   André himself has answered the argument by ridiculing and exploding the idea in his examination before the board of officers. It was a weakness to urge it.  
[20]   There was in truth no way of saving him. Arnold or he must have been the victim; the former was out of our power.  
[21]   It was by some suspected, Arnold had taken his measures in such a manner, that if the interview had been discovered in the act it might have been in his power to sacrifice André to his own security. This surmise of double treachery made them imagine Clinton might be induced to give up Arnold for André, and a Gentleman took occasion to suggest this expedient to the latter, as a thing that might be proposed by him. He declined it. The moment he had been capable of so much frailty, I should have ceased to esteem him.  
[22]   The infamy of Arnold’s conduct previous to his desertion ⟨is⟩ only equalled by his baseness since. Besides the folly of writing to Sir Henry Clinton; assuring him that André had acted under a passport from him and according to his directions, while commanding officer at a post, and that therefore he did not doubt he would be immediately sent in; he had the effrontery to write to General Washington, in the same spirit, with the addition of a menace of retaliation, if the sentence should be carried into execution. He has since acted the farce of sending in his resignation. This man is in every sense despicable. Added to ⟨the sc⟩ene of knavery and prostitution during his command in Philadelphia, which the late seizure of his papers has unfolded; the history of his command at West Point is a history of little, as well as great, villainies. He practiced every dirty art of peculation; and even stooped to connections with the suttlers of the garrison to defraud the public.  
To his conduct, that of the captors of André forms a striking contrast. He tempted them with the offer of his watch, his horse and any sum of money they should name. They rejected his offers with indignation; and the gold, that could seduce a man high in the esteem and confidence of his country, who had the remembrance of past exploits; the motives of present reputation and future glory to ⟨cloak⟩ his integrity, ⟨had no charm for three simple peasants, leaning⟩ only on their virtue and an honest sense of their duty. While Arnold is handed down with execration to future times, posterity will repeat with reverence the names of Van Wert, Paulding and Williams!

When his ſentence was announced to him, he remarked,  
that ſince it was his lot to die, as there was a choice in the  
mode, which would make material difference to his feelings,  
he would be happy, if it were poſſible to be indulged with  
a profeſſional death. He made a ſecond application by let-  
ter, in conciſe but perſuaſive terms. It was thought this  
indulgence, being incompatible with the cuſtoms of war,

There was ſomething ſingularly intereſting in the cha-  
racter and fortunes of Andre. To an excellent underſtand-  
ing, well improved by education and travel, he united a pe-  
culiar elegance of mind and manners, and the adyantage of  
a pleaſing perſon. It is ſaid he poſſeſſed a pretty taſte for  
the fine arts, and had himſelf attained ſome proficiency in  
poetry, muſic and painting. His knowledge appeared with-  
out oſtentation, and embelliſhed by a diffidence that rarely  
accompanies ſo many talents and accompliſhments, which  
left you to ſuppoſe more than appeared. His ſentiments  
were elevated, and inſpired eſteem; they had a ſoftneſs that  
conciliated affection. His elocution was handſome ; his ad-  
dreſs eaſy, polite, and inſinuating. By his merit he had ac-  
quired the confidence of his General, and was making a  
rapid progreſs in military rank and reputation. But in the  
height of his career, fluſhed with new hopes from the execu-  
tion of a project, the moſt beneficial to his party that could  
be deviſed, he is at once precipitated from the ſummit of  
proſperity, ſees all the expectations of his ambition blaſted,  
and himſelf ruined. | |  
  
HAMILTON&#x27;s LETTER. 109  
  
The character I have given of him is drawn partly from  
what I ſaw of him myſelf, and partly from information. I  
am aware that a man of real merit is never ſeen in ſo favor-  
able a light, as through the medium of adverſity. The  
clouds that ſurround him are ſo many ſhadows that ſet off  
his good qualities. Misfortune cuts down little vanities, that,  
in proſperous times, ſerve as ſo many ſpots in his virtues,  
and gives a tone of humility that makes his worth more  
amiable. His ſpectators, who enjoyed a happier lot, are  
leſs prone to detract from its true envy; and are more diſ-  
poſed by compaſſion to give him the credit he deſerves, and  
perhaps even to magnify it.  
  
I ſpeak not of Andre&#x27;s conduct in this affair as a philo-  
ſopher, but as a man of the world. The authorized max-  
ims and practices of war are the ſators of human nature.  
They countenance almoſt every ſpecies of ſeduction as well  
as violence; and the general who can make moſt traitors in  
the army of his adverſary, is frequently moſt applauded,  
On this ſcale we acquit Andre, while we could not but  
condemn him if we were to exemine his conduct by the ſo-  
ber rules of philoſophy and moral reCtitude.

.SINCE my return from Hartford,  
my dear friend, my mind has been  
too lit.le at eafe-to permit meto write  
to you loom r. It has been wholly oc­  
cupied by ihe. incidents, &#x27;and the tra­  
pse cunlequeiicesT - of Arnold&#x27;s trea­  
ion. My feelings were never pur to  
io i&#x27;evere a trial. You will have  
h ard the principal facts before this  
reach -s you ; but there are particu­  
lars, to which my fituation gave me  
accefs, that cannot have come to  
your knowledge from public report,  
yhich 1 am perfuaded you will find  
intrefling. . . &#x27;  
From ie&#x27;veral circumftances, the  
project feems to have&#x27; originated with  
Arnold himfelf, and to have been  
long premeditated. , The firft over­  
ture is traced back to fome time in  
lunelaft. It was conveyed in a let­  
rcr to Col. Robinfon,, the fubject of  
vhichwas that the ingratitude he  
ad experienced from Jiis-country,  
concurring with ether caufes, had  
entirely changed his principles ; that  
he now only lought to reftore him­  
lelf to the tavor of his prince by fome  
lignal proof ot his repentance : and  
that he wifhed to open a corr&#x27;efpon­  
cence with Sir Henry Clinton, for;  
this purpofe About that period he  
made a journey to Connecticut, on  
H- return from which to Philadel­  
phia he Solicited the command of  
Welt point ; alledging that the ef­  
fects, of his wound difqualified him  
f 1 r iht- adtivc duties or the field.  
&#x27;J he faciifice of 1 his important poll  
was the attonunent he intended to  
make. Guieral Wafhingtoh hefi­  
tattd the lels to gratify an officer  
who had frequently rendered emi­  
nent lervices, as he was convinced  
the poll might be fafely .trufted to  
one, who had given fo rnany diftin­  
guilhed proofs of his patriotifm. The  
beginning of A ugufthe joined the  
army, and renewed his application.  
Ihe enemy, at this juncture, had em­  
baiked the greatest part of tfaeir  
force on an expedition to Rhode­  
Wand, and qur army was in motion,  
to compel them to1 felinquifh&#x27; the en­  
terprile, or to attack New-York in&#x27;  
its weakened (late, the general  
offered Arnold the left wing of the  
army, which he declined, on the  
pretext altready mentioned y but  
not without vifib&#x27;Ie embarraflment.  
He certainly miht have executed  
the duties of fuch a temporary com­  
mand, and it was expeftcd from his  
enterprizing temper that he would  
gladly have embraced fo IpUndidly  
inviting an oppormnity butt he  
did not choofe to be diverted a mo­  
ment from his favorite objecV pro­  
bably lrom-an-apprehenfion . that  
lorne different aifpofition might take  
pUce, which would exclude&#x27; him.  
ihe extreme fnlidtude he clifcover­  
ed to get polTeffion of the poll would  
have led to a lulrncior. ol treachery,  
Jiad iLbeen .poflible-ffom his paft  
conduft to haye luppofed lmn capa

Au.y K.muon, under reined fiKna­  
tures, and a mercantile difonin. i

propofes an interview, &quot; to fettle the  
rifks and profits of the copartner­  
fhip and in the fame ftile of me­  
taphor, intimates an expected aug­  
mentation of the garrilon, and fpeaks  
of it as the means of extending their  
traffic. It appears by another letter,  
that Andre was to have met him on  
the lines, under the fanction of a  
flag, in the. character of Mr. . John.  
Anderfon. But fome p aufe or other,­  
not known, . prevented this inter­  
view,General Wafhington crofted the  
river in his way to Hartford the day  
thefe difpatches arrived. . Arnold,  
conceiving he mult have heard of  
the flag, thought it neceffary, for the  
fake of appearahces,&#x27; to fubmit the  
letters to him, and afk&#x27; his opinion of  
the propriety of complying withhis  
requeft. The general, without his  
ulual caution, though without the  
leaft furmife&#x27;of thedefign, diffuaded  
him from it, and advifed him to re­  
ply to Robertion, that whatever re­  
lated to his private affairs muft be of  
a civil nature, and coul.J only pro­  
perly be addrefled to the civil autho  
rity. J h&#x27;s reference fortunately  
deranged the whole&#x27; plan, and was  
the firft link in the chain of events  
that led to the detection. &#x27;Ihe inter­  
view could no loncer take place in  
the form of a flag, but was obliged  
to be managed in a fccret manner.  
Arnold employed one bmith to go  
cn board the Vulture, and bring  
Andre afhore, with a pais tor IV r  
John Anderfon Andre came afhore  
accordingly, and was conducted  
within a picket of purs, to the houfe  
of Mr. Smith, where Arnold and he  
remained together in clofe confer  
ence all that night and the day tol-  
lowing. At day-light in the morn-  
1 I T  
ing,-y tne cornmanding-oiacer ai  
King&#x27;s ferry, without .&#x27;the privity of  
Arnold, moved a couple or cannon  
to a point oppofite where the Vul  
ture lay, and ob&#x27;iged her&#x27; to take a  
more remote ftation. 1 his event,  
or fome lurking diftruft, made the  
boatman rcfufe to convey the two  
padengers back, and difconcerted  
Arnold fo much, that by one of  
thofe ftrokes of infatuation, which  
often confound the fcheines of men  
confcioMsof guilt, he infifted on An­  
dre VchandnR his uniform for a.  
dilKdife, and retUrmng&quot;&#x27;in a - mode  
different &quot;from that in, which he  
came. Andre, whoJiad been ;urt­  
defignedly brought within our pofls  
m the firft inuance, remonlfrated  
warmly againft thi-new and dnnge­  
rous expedient. But Arnold perfdt­  
ing in declaring It impoftible for him  
to return as. he came, he at length  
reluctantly yielded to&#x27; hfc per fiiaficn,&quot;  
and confented to change his dref,  
and rake the rcute he recommended,  
mi.h furniflied the difguife, and in  
the evening&#x27;anived at King&#x27;s fen y  
together, they proceeded to Crown­  
Point, where they flopped tle re­  
mainder of the night, at the in!tanc.e  
of a militia officer, to avoid being  
fufpeitsd by him. . The next morn-,  
ing they returned their journey,  
Smith accompanying Andre a little  
beyond Pine&#x27;s bridge, wjiere he Iett,  
himrHe had reached. I arryjown  
where he was taken by threejfilitia--men.  
who ruffied out of the vvocds  
and furrounded him.  
At this critical period, his ptRience  
of mind forfuk him - inftead of pro  
ducing hi3 pais, which would have  
extricated huvi from our parties,  
and could have done him no harm  
with his own, he afked the militia, :

clofedin a letter to eeneral Wafh  
infeton, which having taken a route  
diifeFcnj from that by which he re­  
turned, made a circuit, that afforded

derfon&#x27;i capture, to . get to him an

rived at his quarters ; time rnough  
to e&#x27;ud? the fate, that awaited him.

Since, my return from Hartford, my dear  
friend, my mind has been too little at ease to per-  
mit meé tu write to you sooner. It has been  
wholly occupied by the incidents, and the tragic  
consequences, of Arnold’s treason. My feclings  
  
  
  
were never put to so severe a trial, You will  
have heard the principal facts before this reaches  
  
you; but there are paruculars, to which iny si-  
tuation gave me access, that cannot have come  
to your knowledge from public report, which I  
  
am persuaded you will find interesting.  
  
  
  
  
  
283  
  
From several circumstances, the project seems  
to have originated with Arnold himself, and to  
have been long premeditated. The first over-  
ture is traced back to some time in June lasté  
It was conveyed in a letter to Col. Robinson, the  
subject of which was, that the ingratitude he  
had experienced from his country, concurring  
with other causes, had entirely changed hie  
principles: that he now only sought to restore  
himself to the favour of his prince by signa! proof  
ef his repentance: and that he wished to open  
a correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton for this  
purpose. About that period, he made a journey  
to Connecticut, on his return from which to Phi-  
ladelphia he solicited the command of West-  
Point; alledging that the effects of his wound  
disqualified him for the active duties of the field.  
The sacrifice of this important post was the  
atonement he intended to make. General  
WaAsuincTon hesitated the less to gratify an  
officer, who had frequently rendered eminent  
services, as he was convinced the post might be  
safely trusted to one, who had given so many dis-  
tinguished preofs of his patriotism. The begin-  
ning of August, he joined the army, and renew-  
ed his application. The enemy, at this juncture,  
had embarked the greatest part of their ferce on  
an expedition to Rhode-Island, and our army  
was in motion, to compell them to relinquish the  
enterprise, or to attack New York in its weaken-  
ed state. The general offered Arnold the left  
wing of the army, which he declined, on the  
pretext already mentioned; but not without vi-  
sible embarrassment. He certainly migit have  
executed the duties of such a temporary com-  
mand, and it was expected from his enterprizing  
temper that he would gladly have embraced so  
splendidly inviting an opportunity; but he did  
not choose to be diverted a moment from his  
favourite object, probably from an apprehension  
that some different disposition might take place,  
which would exclude him. The extreme solici-  
tude he discovered to get possession of the post  
would have led to a suspicion. of treachery, had  
it been possible from his past conduct to have  
  
  
  
supposed him capable of it.  
  
The correspondence, thus begun, was carried  
on between Arnold, and major Andre, adjutant-  
general to the British army, in behalf of Sir  
Henry Clinton, under feigned signatures, and a  
mercantile disguise. In an intercepted letter of  
Arnold&#x27;s, which lately fell into our hands, he  
proposes an interview ‘to settle the risks and  
profits of the co-partnership ;’ and in the same  
  
  
  
  
  
style of metaphor, intimates an expected augmen-  
tation of the garrison, and speaks of it as the  
means of extending their traffic. It appears by.  
another letter, that Andre was to have met him  
on the lines, under the sanction of a flag, in  
character of Mr. John Anderson, Bunt some  
cause or Other, not known, prevented this inter-  
views  
  
General Wasutncton, crossed the river in  
his way to Hartford the day these dispatches ar-  
rived. Arnold, conceiving he must have heard  
of the flag, thought it necessary, for the sake of  
appearances, to submit the letters to him, and  
ask his opinion of the propriety of complying  
with his request. The general, without his usual  
caution, though without the least surmise of the  
design, dissuaded him from it, and advised him  
to reply to Roberison, that whatever related to  
is private affairs must be of a civil nature, and  
could only properly be addressed ta the civil au-  
thority. This reference fortunately deranged  
the whole plan, and was the first link in the chain  
of events that led to the detection, ‘The inter-  
view could no longer take place in the form of  
a flag, but was obliged to be managed i a secret  
manner.

Arnold employed one Smith to go on board  
the Vulture, and bring Andre ashore, with a pass  
for Mr. John Anderson: Andre came ashore ac-  
cordingly, and was conducted with a picket of  
ours, to the house of Mr. Smith, where Arnold  
and he remained together in close conference all  
that night and the day following. At day-light  
in the morning, the commanding officer at King’s  
ferry, without the privity of Arnold, moved a  
couple of cannon to a point opposite where the  
Vulture lay, and obliged her to take a more re-  
mote station. This event, or some lurking dis-  
trust, made the boatmen refuse to convey the  
two passengers back, and disconcerted Arnold  
so much, that by one of those strokes of infatua-  
tion, which often confound the schemes of men  
conscious of guilt, he insisted on Andre’s chang-  
ing his uniform for a disguise, and returning in  
a mode different from that in which he came.  
Andre, who had been undesignedly brought with-  
in our posts in the first instance, remonstrated  
warmly against this new and dangerous expedi-  
ent. But Arnold persisting in declaring it im-  
possible for him to return as he came, he at  
length reluctantly yielded to his persuasion and  
consented to change his dress, and take the route  
he recommended. Smith furnished the disguise,  
and in the evening they arrived at King’s ferry  
together, they proceed to Crewn-Point, where  
they stopped the remainder of the night, at the  
instance of a militia officer, to avoid being sus-  
pected by him. The next morning they resum-  
ed their journey, Smith accompanying Andre a  
little beyond Pine’s-bridge, where he left him.  
He had reached Tarrytown where he was taken  
by three militia men, who rushed out of the woods  
and surrounded him.  
  
At this critical period, his presence of mind  
forsook him—instead of producing his pass,  
which would have extricated him from our  
parties, and could have done him no harm with  
his own, he asked the militia men if they were  
of the upper or lower party—distinctive appella-  
tions known among the enemy&#x27;s refugee corps*.  
The militia men replied, they were of the lower  
party ; upon which he assured them he was a  
British officer, and pressed them not to detain  
him, as he was upon urgent business. This con-  
ession removed all doubt, and it was in vain he  
afterwards produced his pass.—He was instantly  
  
forced of to a place of greater security, where he |  
  
was carefully searched, and in his stocking feet  
were found several papers of importance, deli-  
vered to him by Arnold. Among these were a  
plan of the fortifications of West-Point,a memo-  
rial from the engineer on the attack and defence  
ef the place, returns of the garrison, cannon and  
stores, copy of a council of war, held by General  
Wasuincron a few weeks before.  
  
The prisoner was at first inadvertently ordered  
to Arnold, but upon recollection, while he was  
still on the way, he was countermanded, and sent  
to Old Salem. ‘The papers were enclosed ina  
letter to General WaAsuincron, which having  
taken a route different from that by which he re-  
turned, made a circuit, that afforded leisure for  
another letter, through an ill-judged delicacy  
written to Arnold, with an information of Ander-  
son’s capture, to get to him an hour before Ge-  
neral WaASEING TON arrived at his quarters; time  
enough to elude the fate that awaited him. He  
went down the river in-his barge to the Vul-  
ture, with such precipitate confusion, that he did  
not take with him a single paper, useful to the  
enemy. On the first notice of the affair, he was  
pursued, but much too late to overtake him.

A moment before his setting out he went into  
Mrs. Arnold’s apartments, and informed her,  
that certain transactions had just come to light,  
which must forever banish him from his country.  
She fell into a swoon at this declaration, and he  
left her in it to consult his own safety, till the  
servants, alarmed by her cries, came to her re-  
lief. She remained frantic all day, accusing every  
one who approached her, with an intention of  
murdering her child, (an infant in her arms) and  
  
exhibiting every other mark of the most genuine |  
  
and agonising affection. Exhausted by the fa-  
tigue and tumult of her spirits, her phrenzy sub-  
sided towards evening, and she sunk into all the  
sadness of distress. It was impossible not to have  
been touched with her situation; every thing  
affecting in female tears, or in the misfortunes of  
beauty ; every thing pathetic in the wounded ten-  
derness of a wife, or in the apprehensive fondness  
of a mother; and every appearance of suffering  
innocence, conspired to make her an object of  
sympathy to all who were present. She experi-  
enced the most delicate attentions, and every  
friendly office, till her departure for Philadelphia.

Andre, without loss of time, was conducted  
to the head-quarters of the army, where he was  
immediately brought before a board of general  
officers, to prevent all possibility or misrepresen-  
tation, or cavil on the part of the enemy. The  
board reported, that he ought to be considered  
as a spy, and according to the laws and usages  
of nations, to suffer death: which was executed  
two days after.  
  
Never, perhaps, did a man suffer death with  
more justice, or deserve it less. The first step  
he took after his capture was to write a letter to  
  
General WaSHINGTON, conceived in terms of  
  
dignity without insolence, and apology without  
meanness. The scope of it was to vindicate  
himself from the imputation of having assumed  
a mean character for treacherous or interested  
purposes, asserting that he had been involuntarily  
an impostor; that contrary to his intention he  
was to meeta person for intelligence, on neutral  
ground, he had been betrayed within our posts,  
and forced into the vile condition of an enemy  
in disguise; soliciting only, that to whatever  
rigour policy might devote him, a decency of  
treatment might be observed, due to a person,  
who, though unfortunate, bad been guilty of no-  
thing dishonorable. His request was granted in  
its full extent; for, in the whole progress of the  
affair, he was treated with most scrupulous de-  
licacy. When brought before the board of  
officers, he met with every mark of indulgence,  
and was required to answer no interrogatory  
which could even embarrass his feelings. On  
his part, while he carefully concealed every thing  
that involved others, he frankly confessed all the  
facts that related to himself; and upon his con-  
fession, without the trouble of examining a wit-  
ness, the board made their report. The mem-  
bers of it were not more impressed with the  
candor and modest firmness, mixed with a be-  
coming sensibility which he displayed, than he  
was penetrated with their liberality and politeness.  
He acknowledged the generosity of the behaviour  
towards him in every respect, but paticularly in  
this, in the strongest terms of manly gratitude.  
In a conversation with a gentleman, who visited  
him after his trial, he said—he flattered himself  
he had never been illiberal, but if there were any  
remains of prejudice in his mind, his present ex-  
perience must obliterate them.  
  
In one of the visits | made to him (and I saw  
him several times during the confinement) he  
begged me to be the bearer of a request to the  
general, for permission to send an open letter te  
Sir Henry Clinton. ‘I foresee my fate, (said  
  
he) and though I pretend not to play the hero,  
or to be indifferent about life; yet I am recon-  
  
  
  
  
  
ciled to whatever may happen, conscious thag’  
misfortune, not guilt, will have brought ft upon  
me. There is only one thing that disturbs my  
tranquillity. Sir Henry Clinton has been too  
good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness,  
Iam bound to him by too many obligations, and  
leve him too well, to bear the thought that he  
should reproach himself, or that others should  
reproach him, on a supposition that I had con-  
ceived myself obliged by his instructions to run  
the risk I did, I would not for the world leave a  
sting in his mind that should embitter his future  
days.’ He could scarce finish the sentence,  
bursting into tears in spite ofhis efforts to suppress  
them, and with difficulty, collected himself  
enough atterwards to add. ‘ I wish to be per.  
mitted to assure him I did not act under his im-  
pression, but submitted to a necessity imposed  
upon me, as contrary to my own inclination as  
to his orders.’ His request was readily compli-  
ed with and he wrote the letter annexed, with  
which, I dare say, you will be as much pleased,  
as [ am, both for the diction and sentiment.

When his sentence was announced to him, he  
remarked, that since it was his lot to die, as there  
was a choice in the mode, which would make a  
material difference to his feelings, he would be  
happy, if it were possible, to be indulged with a  
professional death. He made a second application  
by letter, in concise but persuasive terms. It  
was thought this indulgence, being incompatible  
with the custom of war, could not be granted;  
and it was therefore determined in both cases  
to evade an answer, to spare him the sensations,  
which a certain knowledge of the intended mode  
would inflict.  
  
When he was led out tothe place of execution,  
as he went along he bowed familiarly to all those  
with whom he had been acquainted in his con-  
finement. A smile of complacency expressed  
the serene fortitude of his mind. Arrivedatthe  
fatal spot, he asked with some emotion, ‘ must  
I then die in this manner?’ He was told it had  
been unavoidable. ‘ 1 am reconciled to my fate  
(said he) but not to the mode.’ Soon, however,  
recollecting himself, he added ‘it will be but a  
momentary pang ;’ and springing upon the cart  
performed the last offices to himself, with a com-  
posure, that excited the admiration, and melted  
the hearts of the beholders. Upon being told the  
final moment was at hand, and asked if he had  
any thing to say, he answered, * Noihing, but to  
request you will witness to the world that I die  
like a brave man.’ Among the extraordinary  
circumstances that attended him, in the midst of  
his enemies, he died universally esteemed and  
universally regretted.

There was something singularly interesting  
in the character and fortunes of Andre. To an  
excellent understanding, well improved by edu-  
cation and travel, he united a peculiar elegance  
of mind and manners, and the advantage of a  
pleasing person. It is said he possessed a pretty  
taste for the fine arts, and had himself attained  
some proficiency in poetry, music and painting.  
His knowledge appeared without ostentation, and  
embellished by a diffidence, that rarely accom-  
panied so many talents and accomplishments,  
which left you to suppose more than appeared.  
His sentiments were elevated, and inspired es-  
‘teem, they had a softness that conciliated affec-  
tion. His elocution was handsome, his address  
easy, polite and insinuating....By his merit he  
had acquired the unlimited confidence of his  
general, and was making a rapid progress in  
military rank and reputation. But in the height  
of his career, flushed with new hopes from the  
execution of a project the most beneficial to his  
party that could be devised, &quot;he is ai once preci-

the expectations of his ambition blasted, and  
himself ruined.  
  
The character I have given of him is drawn  
partly from what I saw of him myself, and partly  
from information. I am aware that a man of  
real-‘merit is never seen in so favourable light,  
as through the medium of adversity. The clouds  
that surround him are so many shades that set  
off his good qualities. Misfortune cuts down  
little vanities, that in prosperous times, serve as  
so many spots in his virtues, and gives a tone of  
humanity that makes his worth more amiable.  
His spectators, who enjoy a happier lot, are less  
prone to detract from it through envy; and are  
much disposed by compassion, to give the credit  
he deserves, and perhaps even to magnify it.  
  
I speak not of Andre’s conduct in this affair  
as a philosopher, but as a man of the world.  
The authorized maxims and practices of war  
are the satire of human nature. ‘They counte-  
nance almost every species of seduction as well as  
violence; and the general who can make most  
traitorsin the army of his adversary, is frequently  
most applauded. On this scale we acquit An-  
dre; while we could not but condemn him if  
we were to examine his conduct by the sober  
rules of philosophy and moral rectitude. It is how-  
ever a blemish in his fame, that he once intend-  
ed to prostitute a flag; about this a man of nice  
honor ought to have had a scruple; but the  
temptation was great: let his misfortunes cast  
a veil over his error.

Several letters from Sir Henry Clinton and  
others, were received, that Andre came out  
under the protection of flag, with a passport  
from a general officer in actual service, and con-  
sequently could not be justly detained. Clinton  
sent a deputation composed of lieutenant general  
Robertson, Mr. Elliot, and Mr. William Smith,  
to represent, as he said, the state of Major An-  
dre’s case. General Green met Robinson, and  
had a conversation with him, in which he reite-  
rated the pretence of a flag, urged Andre’s re-  
lease as a persowial favor to Sir Henry Clinton,  
and offered any friend of ours in their power in  
exchange. Nothing could have been more fri-  
volous than the plea which was used. The fact  
was, that, besides the time, manner and object  
of the interview, change of dress, and other  
circumstances, there was not a single formality  
customary with flags; and the passport was not  
to Major Andre, but to Mr. Anderson. But  
had there, on the contrary, been all the forma-  
lities, it would be an abuse of language to say,  
the sanction of a flag for corrupting an officer to  
betray his trust ought to be obligatory. So un-  
justifiable a purpose would not destroy its validi-  
ty, but make it an aggravation.  
  
Andre himself has answered the argument,  
by ridiculing and exploding the idea in his exa-  
mination before the board of officers. It was a  
Weakness to urge it. There was in truth, no  
way of saving him: Arnold or he must have  
been the victim, the former was out of our  
power.  
  
It was by some suspected Arnold had taken  
his measures in such a manner, that, if the in-  
terview had been discovered, in the act, it might  
have been in his power to sacrifice Andre to  
his own security. This surmise of double trea-  
sou made them imagine Clinton might be induced  
to give up Arnold for Andre; and a gentle-  
man took occasion to suggest this expedient to  
the latter, as a thing that might be proposed  
by him. He declined it: the Tmesieaites he had  
been guilty of so much frailty, I should have  
Ceased to esteem him,  
  
The infamy of Arnold’s conduct, previous to  
  
is desertion, is only equalled by his meanness  
since. Besides the folly of writing to Sir Henry

under a passport from him, and according to his  
directions, while commanding officer at a post,  
and that, therefore, he did not doubt. he would  
be immediately sent in; he had the effrontery  
to write to general Washington, to the same  
purpose, with the addition of a menace of retali-  
ation, if the sentence should be carried into ex-  
ecution. He has since acted the farce of sending  
in his resignation. This man is in every sense  
despicable. In addition to the scene of navery  
and prostitution, during his command in Phila-  
delphia, which the late seizure of his papers  
has unfolded; the history of his command at  
West Puint is a history of little, as well as great  
villanies. He practised every dirty art of pecu-  
lation, and even stooped to connections with the  
suttlers of the garrison to defraud the public. *  
  
To his conduct, that of the captors of Andre  
forms a striking contrast: he tempted their in-  
tegrity with the offer of his watch, his horse,  
and any sum of money they should name. They  
rejected his offers with indignation: and the  
gold that could seduce a man high in the esteem  
and confidence of his country, who had the re-  
membrance of his past exploits, the motives of  
present reputation and future glory to prop his  
integrity, had no charms for three simple pea-  
sants, leaning only on their virtue and a sense  
of duty. While Arnold is handed down with  
execration to future times, posterity will repeat  
with reverence, the names of VANWERT, Pau t-

he had never been illiberal, but if there were  
aby remains of prejudice io his mind bis present  
experience must obliterate them.  
  
In one of the visits | made to him (and I saw  
him several times during bis confinement) he  
_ begged me to be the bearer of a request to the  
general, for permission to send an open letter to  
Sir Henry Clinton. * | foresee my tate, said be,  
and though I preiend not to play the hero, or be  
indifferent about fife, yet I am reconciled to  
whatever ;oay happen, conscious that misfortune,  
not guilt, will have brought it upon me. There  
  
is only one thing that disturbs my tranquility.  
Sir Henry Clinton has been too . 00d to me, he  
has been favish of his kindness. I am bouod to  
_bim by too many obligations, and love him too  
well to bear the thought that he should repr ach  
himself, or that others should reproach bim, on  
a supposition that [ had conceived myself oblig-  
ed, hy his instruect.ons to :un the risk I did. I  
would not or the world leave a sting iv his mind  
that shoutd embitter his future days.’’ He could  
searce fin +h the sentence, bursting into teers in  
spite of his efforts to them, and with  
| difficulty collected tiniself enough afterwards to  
&#x27;add, ** I wish to be permitted to assure him I  
did not aet unver this mpression, but submitted  
| toa necessity imposed avon me, as contra-y to  
‘iny own inclination to his orders.’ His re-  
quest was readily cen, with and he wrote  
the letter annexed, wit): i f dare say you will  
be as much pleased as I am, bot for the diction  
and sentiment.  
  
When his sentence was anuounced to bim, be  
remarked, that since it was bis let to die as there  
was a choice in the mode which would make ma-  
terial difference to bis feelings, he would be hap-  
py, if it were possible to be indulged with a pro-  
fessional death. He made a second ap) lication  
by letter. in concise, but persuasive terms. It  
  
was thought this indulgence, being incompatible  
with the customs of war, could no! be granted;  
and it was therefore determined in both cases to  
evade an answer, to spare him the sensations  
_whicha certain kaowledge of the intended mode  
would inflict.  
  
When he was led out to the place «f execution,  
as he wentalong be Sowed familiarly to all those  
with whom he had been acquainted ip kis eontine-  
ment. A smile of complacency expressed the  
  
serene fortitute of his mind. Arrived at the fa-  
tal spot he asked with this emotion, ** Must I  
| then die in-this manner?’ He was told it had  
been unavoidible. ‘ [am reconciled to my fate,  
| (said he) but not to the mode.” Soon, however,  
| recollecting himself he added, ‘It will be but a  
momentary pang ;’’ and springing upon the cart,  
| performed the last offices to bimselt, with a com-  
| posure that excited the adimiration, and melted  
the hearts of the beholders. Upon heing told  
| the final moment was at hand, and asked if he  
had any thing to say, he answered, ** Nothing,  
&#x27; but to request you will withe ss to the world that  
| [ die like a brave man. Among the extraordi-  
nary circumstances that attended him, in the  
midst of his enemies, he died universally esteem.  
ed and universally respected.

There was something singularly interesting in  
the character aud fortunes of Ardre. To anexcel- |  
  
lent understanding well improved by education  
and travel, he united a peculiar elegance of mind  
and manners, and the advantages ‘of a pleasing  
person. It is said he possessed a pretty taste  
for the fine arts, and bad himself attained some  
proficiency in poetry, music and painting. His  
kuowledge appeared without ostentation, and em-  
bellished by a diffidence that rarely accompanies  
so inany talents and accomplishments, which left  
you to suppose more than appeared. His senti-  
ments were elevated, and inspired e-teem; they  
had a softness that conciliated affection. His  
elocution was handsome, his address easy, polite  
and insiunatiog. By bis merit he had acquired  
the confideace of his general, and was making a  
rapid progress in military rank and reputation.  
But in the height of bis career, flushed with new  
hopes from the execution of a project, the most  
beneticial to his party that could be devised, be  
is at once precipitated from the summit of pros-  
perity, sees all the expectations of his ambition  
blasted, an’ himself ruined.  
  
The character I have given him is drawn part-  
ly from what I saw of bim myself, and partly from  
information. [am aware that a man of real merit  
is never seen in so favorable a light, as throngh  
the medium of adversity. The clouds that sur-  
round him are so many shades that set off his  
good qualities. Misfortune cuts down little va-  
nities, that in prosperous times serve as so many  
spots in his virtues, and gives atone of humility  
that makes his worth more amiable. His specta-  
tors who enjoyed a happier lot, are less prone to  
detract from its true envy; and are more dispo-  
sed by compassion to give him the credit be de-  
served, and perhaps even to magaify it.  
  
I spe.k not of Andre&#x27;s conduct in this affair  
as a philosopher, but as a man of the world.  
The authorised maxims and practices of war are  
the satyrs of human nature. They countenance  
almost every species of secuction as well as io  
lence; and the general who can make most trat-  
tors in the army of his adversary, is frequently  
most applanded. On this scale we acquit Andre,  
  
while we cou d pot but condemn bim. i! we were |  
  
to examine his condoct by the sober rules of phi  
me aud moral rectitude.

General Washington’s personal suite, un-

the case. It docs not differ essentially  
from the commen histories of the events  
but it fills up the meagre outlines, and  
presents us with a striking picture,  
STAR,  
FROM BRADFORD&#x27;S PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL.  
The following letter froma gentleman at  
camp, to his friend at Philadelphia ( giv-  
ing a frarticular and satisfactory account  
of a late important transaction ) we doubt  
not will be accefitable to our readers.  
Since my return from Hartford, my dear  
friend, my mind has been too little at ease  
to permit me to write to you sooner. » It has  
been wholly occupied by the incidents, and  
by the tragic consequences, of Arnold’s trea-  
son. My feelings were never put to so se-  
vere a trial. You will have heard the prin-  
cipal facts before this reaches you; but  
there are particulars, to which my situation  
gave me access, that cannet have come to  
your knowledge trom public report, which  
I am persuaded you will find interesting.  
From several eircumstances, the project  
scems to have originated with Arnold him-  
self, and to have been long premeditated.  
The first overture is traced back to some  
time in June last. It was conveyed in a let-  
ter to Col. Robinson, the substance of which  
was, that the ingratitude he had experienc-  
ed from his country, concurring with other  
causes, had entirely changed his principles ;  
that he now only sought to restore himself  
to the favour of his Prince by some signal  
proof of his repentance ; and that he wish-  
ed to open acorrespondence with Sir Henry  
Clinton for this purpose. About that period  
he made a journey to Connecticut, on his  
return from which to,Philadelphia he solicit-  
ed the command of West-Point, alleging  
that the effects of his wound disqualified  
him for the active duties of the field. The  
sacrifice of this important post was the atone-  
ment he intended tomake. General Wash-  
ington hesitated the less to gratify an officer  
who had frequently rendered eminent ser-  
vices, as he was convinced the post might  
be safely trusted to one who had given so  
many distinguished specimens of his brave-  
ry. The beginning of August he joined the  
army and fenewed his application. The  
enemy, at this juncture, had embarked the  
greatest part of their force on an expedition  
to Rhode-Island, and our army was in mo-  
tion to compel them to relinquish the enter-  
prise, or toattack New-York in its weaken  
ed state. The General offered Arnold thc  
‘eft wing of the any, which he decsined, on  
the pretext already mentioned, but not witii-  
out visible embarrassment. He certainly  
might have executed the duties of such a  
temporary command, and it was expected,  
from his enterprising temper, that he would  
gladly have embraced so splendidly inviting  
an opportunity. But he did not choose to  
be diverted a moment from his favourite ob-  
ject, probably from an apprehension that  
some different disposition might take place,  
which would exclude him. The extreme  
solicitude he discovered to get possession of  
the post would have led to a suspicion of  
treachery, had it been possible, from his  
past conduct, to have supposed him capable  
of it. :  
The correspondence, thus began, was car-  
ried on between Arnold and Major Andre,  
Adjutant General to the British army, in be-  
half of Sir Henry Clinton, under feigned  
signatures, and in a mercantile disguise. In  
an intercepted letter of Arnold’s, which late-  
ly feli into our hands, he proposes an inter-  
view “to settle the risk and profits of the  
copartnership ;” and in the same style of  
metaphor, intimates an expected augmenta-  
tion of the garrison, and speaks of it as the  
means of extending their traffic. It appears  
by another letter that-Andre was to have  
met him on the lines, under the sanction of  
a flag, in character of Mr. John Anderson ;  
but some cause or other, not known, prevent-  
ed this interview.  
The 20th of last month, Robinson and An-  
dre went up the river in the Vulture sloop  
of war. Robinson sent a flag to Arnold with  
two letters, one toGen. Putnam, enclosed in  
another to him ; proposing an interview with  
Putnam, or in his absence with Arnold, to  
adjust some private concerns. ‘The one was  
evidently meant as a cover to the other, in  
case by accident the letters should have fall-  
en under the inspection of a third person.  
General Washington crossed the river in  
his way to Hartford the day these despatch-  
es arrived. Arnold, conceiving he must-have  
heard of the flag, thought it necessary, for  
the sake of appearances, to submit the let-  
ters to him, and ask his opinion of the pro-  
priety of complying with the request. The  
General, with his usual caution, though  
without the least surmise of the design, dis-  
suaded him from it, and advised him to re-  
ply to Robinson, that whatever related to  
his private affairs must be of a civil nature,  
and could only properly be addressed to the  
civil authority. This reference fortunately  
deranged the whole plan, and was the first  
link in the chain of events thatled to the  
detection. The interview could no longer  
take place in the form ofa flag, but was  
obliged to be managed in a secret manner.  
Arnold employed one Smith to go on board  
the Vulture, and bring Andre ashore, with  
a pass for Mr. John Anderson, Andre came  
ashore accordingly, and was conducted with-  
in a picket of ours, to the house of Mr.  
Smith, where Arnold and he remained to-  
gether in close conference all that night and  
the day follgwing. At day-light in the  
morning, the commanding er at King’s-  
Ferry, without the privity of Arncid, moved  
acouple of pieces of cannen toa point  
site to where the Vulture lay, and obli  
her to take amore remote station. This  
event, or some lurking distrust, made the  
  
  
  
‘the repast before him.

gers back, and disconcerted Arnold so much, |  
that, by one of those strokes of infatuation,  
  
4 Which often confound the schemes of men  
  
conscious of guilt, he insisted on Ancre’s  
changing his uniform for a disguise, and re-  
turning in a mode different from that in  
which he came. Andre, who had been un-  
designedly brought within our posts in the  
fi:‘st instance, remonstrated warmly against  
  
thisnew and dangerous expedient. But Ar- |  
  
nold persisting in declaring it impossible for  
him to return as he came, he at length re-  
luctantly yielded fo his persuasion, and con-  
sented to change his dress and take the  
route he recommended. Smith furnished  
the disgnise, and in the evening, passing  
King’s Ferry together, they proceeded to  
Crompond, where they stopped the remain-  
der of the night, at the instance of a militia  
Officer, to avoid being suspected by him.—  
The next morning they resmed their jour-  
ney, Smith accompanying Andre. a little be-  
yond Pine’s Bridge, where he left him. He  
had reached Tarry ‘Town, when he was ta-  
ken by three militia men, who rushed out of  
the woods and surrounded him.  
  
At this critical period his presence of mind  
forsook him.—Instead of producing his pass,  
which would have extricated him from our  
parties, and could have done him no harm  
with his, he asked the militia men if they  
were of the upper or lower party—distinct-  
ive’ appellations known among the enemy’s  
refuge corps.* The militia men replied,  
they were of the lower party ; upon which  
he assured them he was a British officer, and  
pressed them not to detain him, as he was  
upon urgent business. ‘This confession re-  
moved all doubt, and it was im vain he af-  
terwards produced his pass. He was in-  
stantly forced off to a place of greater secu-  
rity, where he was carefully searched, and  
in his stocking feet were found several pa-  
pers of importance delivered to him by Ar-  
nold.— Among these were a plan of the for-  
tifications of West-Point, a memorial from  
the engineer on the attack and defence of  
the place, returns of the garrison, cannon and  
stores, and a copy of the minutes of a council of  
war, held by General Washington a few  
weeks before. The prisoner was inadver-  
tently ordered to Arnold; but upon recollec-  
tion, while still on the way, he was coun-  
termanded and senttoOldSalem. ‘The pa-  
vers were enclosed in a letter to General  
  
Vashington, which having taken a route  
different from that by which he returned,  
made acircuit, that afforded leisure for  
another letter, through an ill-judged deli-  
cacy written to Arnold with information of  
Anderson’s capture, to get to him an hour  
before General Washington arrived at his  
quarters, time enough to elude the fate that  
awaited him. He went down the river nm  
his barge tothe Vulture, with such precipi-  
tate confusion, that he did not take with him  
a single paper usefultothe enemy. On the  
first netice of the affair, he was pursued,  
but much too late to overtake him.

A moment before his setting out, he went  
into Mrs. Arnold’s apartment, and informed  
her, that certain transactions had just come  
to light, which must for ever banish him  
from his country. She fell into a swoon at  
this declaration, and he left her in it to con-  
suit his own safety, till the servants, alarmed  
her cries, came to her relief. She re-  
mained frantic all day, accusing every one  
who approached her, with an mtention of  
murdering her child (an infant in her arms)  
and exhiditing every other mark of the most  
genuine and agonizing affliction. Exhausted  
by the fatigue and tumult of her spirits, her  
frenzy subsided towards evening, and she  
suitk into all the sadness of distress. It was  
impossible not to nave been touched with

every thing pathetic im the wounded tender-

an object of »ympathy to ail who were pre-

Andre, without loss of time, was conduct-  
ed to the head-quarters of the army, where  
he was immediately brought before a board  
of general olucers, to prevent all possibility

the enemy. Ihe Board reported, that he  
ought to be considered asa spy, aud, accord-  
ing to the laws and usages of nations, to suf-  
ter death; which was executed two days  
after’. j  
Never, perhaps, did a man suffer death  
with mere justice, or deserve itless. The  
first step he took after his capture, was to  
write a letter to General Washington, con-  
ceived in terms of dignity without insolence,  
and apology without meanness. The scope  
of it was to vindicate himself from the im-  
putation of having assumed a mean charac-  
ter for treacherous or interested purposes ;  
asserting, that he had been invojuntanly an  
impostor: that, contrary to his intention,  
which was to meet a person, for intelligence,  
on neutral ground, he had been betrayed  
within our posts, and forced into the vile con-  
dition of an enemy in disguise; soliciting  
only, that to whatever rigour policy might  
devote him, a decency of treatment might  
be observed, due to a person, who, though  
unfortunate, had been guilt, of nothing dis-  
honourable. riis request was granted in its  
full extent; for, im the whole progress of  
the affair, he was treated with the most  
a delicacy. When brought before  
the Board of ,officers, he met with every  
mark of mdulgence, and was required to an-  
swer no interrogatory which could even em-  
barrass his feelings. On his part, while he  
carefully concealed every thing that might  
‘involve others, he frankly confessed ali the  
facts relating to himself; and upon his con-  
fession, without the trouble of examining a  
witness, the Board made theirreport. The  
members of it were not more impressed  
with the candour and modest firmness, mix-  
ed with a becoming sensibility, which he dis-  
played, than he was penetrated with their  
liberaiity and’politeness. He acknowledged  
the generosity ofthe behaviour towards him  
in every respect, but particularly in this, in  
the strongest terms of manly gratitude. In  
a conversation with a gentleman, ‘who visit-  
ed him after his trial, he said,—he flattered  
uimself he had never been illiberal, but if  
there were any remains of prejudice in his  
mind, his present experience must obliterate  
them.  
In one of the visits I made to him, (and I  
saw him several times during his confine-  
ment) he begged me to be the bearer of a  
  
uest to the General, for i to  
oma an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton,  
“] foresee my fate (said he) and though I]  
a, not to play the hero, or to be indif-  
erent about life; yet I am reconciled to  
whatever may happen, conscious that mis-  
fortune, not guilt, will have brought it upon  
me. There is only one thing that disturbs  
my tranquillity. Sir Henry Clinton has.been  
too good to me; he has been lavish of his  
kindness. 1 am beund to him by too many  
ebligations, and love him too well, to bear  
the thought that he should reproach him-  
self, or that others should reproach him, on  
a supposition that I had conceived m  
obliged, by his instructions, to run the risk I  
did. I would not for the world leave a sting  
in his mind that should embitter his future  
days.” He could scarce finish the sentence,  
bursting into tears, in spite of his efforts to  
suppress them, and with difficulty collected  
himself enough afterwards to add, “I wish  
to be permitted to assure him I did not act  
under his impression, but submitted to a ne-  
cessity imposed upon me, as cont tomy  
own Vaclination &lt;a his orders”. ‘ia re-  
quest was readily complied with, and he  
wrote the letter annexed, with which, I dare  
say, fag will be as much pleased as I am,  
both for the diction and sentiment.  
When his sentence was announced tohim,  
he remarked, that since it was his lot to die,  
as there was a choice in the mode, which  
would pence mate rid ber ae Sesame  
ings, he w py, if it were  
tobe indulged sth of haleational death. He

asked, with some emotion, “ Must I then  
die in this manner”’ He was told it had  
been unavoidable. “I am reconciled to my  
fate (said he) but not to the mode.” Soon,  
however, recollecting himself, he added,  
“It will be but a momentary pang;” and  
springing upon the car, performed the last  
offices to himself, with a composure that ex-  
cited. the admiration, and meited the hearts  
of the behoiders. Upon being told the final

There was something singularly interest-  
ing in the character and fortunes of Aadre.  
To an excellent understanding, well im-  
proved by education and travel, he united  
a peculiar elegance of mind and manners,  
and the advantage of a pleasing person. It  
is said he possessed a pretty taste for the  
fine arts, and had himself attained some  
hres 4 in poetry, music, and painting.  
is knowledge appeared without ostenta-  
tion, and embellished by a diffidence that  
rarely accompanies so many talents and  
accomplishments, which left you to suppose  
more than appeared. His sentiments were  
elevated, and inspired esteem ; they had a  
softness that conciliated affection. His elo-  
cution was handsome, his address easy, po-  
lite, and insinuating. By his merit he had  
acquired the unlimited confidence of his  
general, and was. making a rapid progress  
in military rank and reputation. But in the  
height of his career, flushed with new hepes  
from the execution of a project the most  
beneficial to his party that could be devised,  
he is at once precipitated from the summit  
of prosperity ; sees al] the expectations of  
his ambition blasted, and himself ruined &#x27;  
The character I have given of him is  
drawn partly from what 1 saw of him my-  
self and partly from information. I am  
aware that a man of real merit is never seen  
in so favourable a light, as through the me-  
dium of adversity. The clouds that  
round him are so many shades that set  
his good qualities. Misfortune cuts down  
little vanities that, in prosperous times,  
serve as sO Many spots in his virtues, and  
gives a tone of humility that makes his worth  
more amiable. His spectators who enjoy a  
happier lot, are less prone to detract from it  
through envy; and are more disposed by  
compassion to give him the credit he de-  
serves, and perhaps even to magnify it.  
I speak not of Andre’s conduct in this af-  
‘fair as a philosopher, but as a man of the  
world. The authorized maxims and prac-  
tices of war are the satire of human nature.  
They countenance almost every species of  
seduction as well as violence ; andthe gene-  
ral that can make most traitors in the army  
of his adversary, is frequently most applaud-  
red. Onthis scale we acquit Andre ; while  
we could not but condemn him if we were  
to examine his conduct by the sober rules  
of philosophy and moral rectitude. It is  
however a blemish in his fame, that he once  
intended to prostitute a flag; about this a  
man of nice honour ought to have had a scru-  
ple ; but the temptation was great: let his  
misfortunes cast a veil over his errour.  
Several letters from Sir Henry Clinton  
and others were received, feebly attempting  
to prove, that Andre came out under the  
protection of a flag, with a passport from a  
general officer in actual service, and conse-  
quently could not be justly detained. Clin-  
ton sent a deputation composed of Lieutenant  
General Robinson, Mr. Elliot, and Mr. Wil-  
liam Smith, to represent, as he said, the true  
state of Major Andre’s case. General  
Greene met Robinson, and had a conversa-  
tion with him, in which he reiterated the  
pretence of a fiag, urged Andre’s release as  
a personal favour to Sir Henry Clinton, and  
offered any friend of ours in their power in  
exchange.  
&#x27; Nothing could have been more frivolous  
than the plea which was used. The fact  
was, that, besides the time, manner and ob-  
ject of the interview, change of dress, and  
other circumst«»s, there was not a single  
formality customary with flags; and the  
oma was not to Major Andre, but to  
Mr. Anderson. sut had there, on the con-  
trary, been all the formalities, it would be  
an abuse of language, to say, the sanction of  
a flag for corrupting an officer to betray his  
trust, ought to be obligatory. So unjustifia-  
ble y peaene would not only destroy its va-  
lidity but make it an aggravation.  
Andre himself has answered the argu-  
ment, by ridiculing and exploding the idea  
in his examination before the board of offi-  
cers. It was a weakness tourge it. There  
was, in truth, no way of saving him: Arnold  
or he must have been the victim ; the former  
was out of our power.  
It was by some suspected; Arnold had  
taken his measures in such a manner, that,  
if the interview had been discovered, in the  
act, it might have been in his power to sac-  
rifice Andre to his own security. This sur-  
mise of double treachery made them ima

gine, Clinton might be induced to give up  
Arnold for Andre, and a gentleman took  
occasion to suggest this expedient to the  
latter, as a thing that might be proposed by  
him. He declined it: the moment he had  
been capable of so much frailty, I should  
have ceased to esteem him.  
  
The infamy of Arnold’s conduct, previous  
to his desertion, is only equalled by his  
meanness since. Besides the folly of writ-  
ing to Sir Henry Clinton, assuring him that  
Andre had acted under a passport from him,  
and according to his directions, while com-  
manding officer of a post, and that, there-  
fore, he did not doubt, he would be im-  
mediately sent in; he had the effrontery to  
write toGeneral Washington to the same  
  
to pen the addition of a menace of  
jation, if the sentence should be carried  
into execution. He has since acted the  
farce of sending in his resignation. This

In addition to the sentiments of General Wash-

“This man, Arnold, is in every sense despicable.  
In addition to the scene of Knavery-and prosti-

which the late seizure ofhis papers has unfolded,  
the history of his command at West Point is a  
history of Jittle, as well as great villanies. He

the field. The sacrifice of this important post was  
the atonement he intended to make. Gen, Washing-  
ton hesitated the less to gratify an officer who had  
frequently rendered eminent services, as he was con-  
vinced the post might be safely trusted to one, who  
had given So many distinguished proofs of his patri-  
ousm. The beginning of August he joined the army,  
and renewed his application. The enemy at this  
juncture, had embarked the greatest part of their force  
on an expedition to Rhode Island, and our army was  
in motion, to compel them to relinqnish the enterprise,  
or to attack New York in its weakened state. The  
general offered Arnold the left wing of the army,  
which he declined, on the pretext already mentioned ;  
but not without visible embarrassment. He certainly  
night have executed the duties of such a temporary  
command, and it was expected from his enterprising  
temper that he would gladly have embraced so splen-  
didly inviting an opportunity ; but he did not choose  
tobe diverted a moment from his favorite object, prob-  
ably from an apprehension that some different dispo-  
sition might take place, which would exclude him.  
The extreme solicitude he discovered to get prsses-  
sion of the post would have led to a suspicion of  
treachery, had it been possible from his past conduct  
to have supposed him capable of it.  
  
The correspondence, taus begun, was carried on  
btween Arnold and major Andre, adjutant general to  
the British army, in behalf of Sir Henry Clinton, un-  
der feigned signatures, and a mercantile disguise. In  
on intercepted jetter of Arnold’s, which Sately fell in-  
toour hands, he proposes an interview “to aettle the  
risks and profits of the copartnership ;” and in the same  
stile of metaphor, intimates an expected augmentation  
ofthe garrison, and speaks of it as the means of ex-  
tending their traffle.

and pressed them not to detain him, as he was on ur-  
gent business. ‘I&#x27;his coufession removed all doubt,  
and it was in vain he afterwards produced his pass.  
He was instantly forced off to a place of greater secu-  
rity, where he was carefully searched, and in his  
stocking feet were found several papers of importance  
delivered tohim by Arnold. Awong these were a  
plar of the fortifications at West-Point, a memorial

on the way, he was countermanded, and sent to Old

eral Washington, which having taken a route differ-  
lent from that by which he returned, made a circuit,  
that afforded leisure for another letter, through an ill-  
judged delicacy written to Arnold, with an informa-  
uion of Anderson’s capture, to get to him an hour be-  
fore general Washington arrived at bis quarters; time  
enough to elude the fate that awaited him. He went  
down the river in his barge to the Vulture, with such  
precipitate confusion, thathe did not take with him a  
single paper useful tothe enemy. On the first no-  
tice of the affair, he wag pursued, but much too late  
to overtake him. A moment before his setting out he  
went into Mrs. Arvold’s apartments and informed her  
that certain transactions had just come to light, which  
must forever banish him from his country. She fell  
into a swoon at this declaration, and he left her in it

eda mean character for treacherous or interested  
purposes, asserting that he had been involuntarily an  
impostor; that contrary to his intention he was to  
meet a person for intelligence, on neutral gronnd, he  
had been betrayed within our posta, and foreed into  
the vile condition of an enemy in disgnise ; soliictine  
only, that to whatever rigor policy might devote him,  
a decency of treatment might be observed, due toa  
person who though unfortunate, had been guilty of  
nothing dishonorable. His request was granted in  
its full extent ; for in the whole progress of the affair,  
he was treated with the most scrupulous delicacy.  
When brought before the board of officers, he met  
with every mark of indulgence, and was required to  
answer no interrogatory which could even embarrase  
his feeling. On his part he, while he carefully con-  
cesled every thing that involved others, he frankly  
confessed ali the faets that related to himself; and  
upon his confession, without the trouble of examining  
a witness, the board made their report. The members

|  
  
  
  
of it were not more impressed with the candor and  
modest fimrness, mixed with a becoming sensibility  
which he displayed, than he was penetrated with  
their liberality and politeness, He acknowledged the  
generosity of the behaviour towards him in every res-  
pect, but particularly in this, in the strongest terms of  
manly gratitude. Ina conversation with a gentie-  
man, who visited him after his trial, he said—he flat-  
tered himself he had never been illiberal, but if there  
were any remarks of prejudice in his mind, his pres-  
ent experience must oblitetate them.  
  
In one of the visits | made to him, (and I saw bim  
several times during his confinement) he begged me  
to be the bearer of a request to the general, for per-  
m_ssion to send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton.  
“I foresaw my fate, (said he) and though I pretend not  
to play the hero, orto be indifferent about life ; yet I  
am reconciled to whatever may happen, conscious that  
misforiune, not guilt, will have brought it upon me.  
There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquility.  
Sir Henry Clinton has been too good to me, he has  
been lavish of his kindness. I am bound to him by  
too many obligations, and love him too well to bear  
the thought that he should reproach himself, on a sup-  
position that I had conceived myself obliged by his  
instructions to run the risk I did, ] would not for the  
world leave a sting in his mind that should embitter  
his future days.” He could scarce finish the sen-  
tence, bursting into tears in spite of his efforts to  
suppress them, and with difficulty collected himself  
enough afterwards to add, “I wish to be permitted to  
agsure him I did not act under his impression, but sub-  
mitted to a necessity imposed upon me, as contrary to  
my own inclination as to his orders.” His request  
was readily complied with, and he wrote the letter an-  
nexed, with which | dare say, you will be as much  
pleased, as [ ain, both for the diction and sentiment.

W hen his sentence was announced to him, he re-  
marked, that since it was his lot to die, ag there was  
a choice in the mode, which would make a material  
difference to his feelings, he would be happy if it  
were possible, to be induiged with a professional death.  
He made a second application by letter, in concise but  
persuasive terms. It was thought this indulgence,  
being incompatible with the custom of war, could not  
be granted; and it was therefore determined in both  
cases to evade an answer, to spare him the sensations  
which a certain knowledge of the intended mode  
would inflict,  
  
When he was led out to the place of execution, ss  
he went along he bowed familiarly to all those with  
whom he had been acquainted in his confinement. A  
smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude  
of the mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, he asked with  
some emotion, “must I then die in this manner? He  
was told ithad been unavoidable. “I am reconciled  
to my face (said he) but not to the mode.” Soon how-  
ever, recullecting himself, he added “it will be bata  
momentary pang;” and springing upon the cart per-  
formed the last offices to himself, with a composure  
thatexcited the admiration, and melted the hearts of  
the beholders. Upon being told the final moment was  
at hand, and asked if he had any thing to say, he an-  
swered, “Nothing, but to request you will witness to  
the world that I die like a brave man.” Among the  
extraordinary circumstances that attended him in the  
micst Of enemies, he died universally esteemed and  
universally regretted.

There was somcthing singularly interesting in the  
character and fortunes of Andre. To an excellent  
  
understanding, well improved by education and travel,  
  
he united a peculiar elegance of mind and manners,  
and the acvantage of a pleasing person. ‘Tis said  
he possessed a pretty taste for the fine arts, and had  
himself attained some proficiency in poetry, music  
and painting. His knowledge appeared without os-  
tentation, and embellished by a diffidene, that accom-  
plishment, which left yon to suppose more than ap-  
peared. His centiments were elevated and inspired  
esteem, they had a softness that conciliated affection.  
His elocution was handsome, his address easy, polite  
and insinuating.—Bv his merit he had acquired the  
unlimited confidence of his general,and was making  
a rapid progress in military rank and reputation. But  
in the height of his career, flushed with new hopes  
from the execution of a project the most beneficial to  
his party that could be devised, he is at once precipi-  
ated from the summit of prosperity; sees all the expec-  
tations of his ambition blasted, and himself ruined,  
The character I have given of him is drawn partly  
from what T saw of him myself, and partly from ipfor-  
mation. [Tam aware that a man of real merit is ney-  
er seen in so favorable light as thongh the medium of  
adversity ;—the clonds that surround him are eo many  
shades, that set off his good qualities. Misfortunes

justly detained. Clinton sent a deputation composed | for the construction of a sluiceway, to take logs from a  
  
of vieotenant general Robertson, Mr, Elliot, and Mr. |  
William Sinith, to represent, as he said, the state of.  
Major Andre’s case. General Greene met Robinson, |  
aud had a conversation with him, in which he reiter- |  
ated the pretence of a flag, urged Andre’s reieas as |  
u personal favor to Sir Henry Clinton, and offered any |  
friend of ours in their power in exchange. Nothing  
could have been more frivolous than the plea which |  
was used. The fact was, that, besides the time, |  
manner and object of the interview, change of dress, |  
and other circumstances, there was not a single for- |  
inality customary with flags; and the passport was  
not to Major Andre, but to Mr. Anderson. But had  
there, on the contrary, been all the formalities, it  
would be an abuse of language to say, the sanction  
of a flag fur corrupting an officer to betray his trust  
ought to be obligatory, So unjustifiable a purpose  
would not destroy its validity, but make it an aggrava-  
tion.  
  
Andre himself has answered the argument, by rid-  
icvling and exploding the idea in his examination be-  
fore the board of officers, It vas a weakness to urge  
it. There was in truth, no way of saving him: Ar-  
nold or he must have been the victim, the former was  
out of our power.  
  
It was by some suspected Arnold had taken his  
measures in such a menner, that, if the interview had  
been discovered, in the act, it might have been in his  
power to sacrifice Andre to bis own security. This  
surwnise of double, treason made them imagine Clinton  
might be induced to give up Arnold for Andre; and  
a gentleman took occasion to sugges} this expediend  
to the latter, as a thing that might be proposed by  
him. He declined it: the moment he had been guilty  
of so much frailty, | should have ceased to esteem  
him. ;  
  
The infamy of Arnold’s conduct, previons to his  
desertion, is only equalled by his meaness since, Be-  
  
  
  
sides the folly of writing to Sir Henry Clinton, assu-  
ring him that Andre had acted under a passport from  
him, and according to his directions, white command-  
ing-officer at a post, and that, therefore, he did not  
  
effrontery to write to general Washington, to the  
same purpose, with the addition of a menace of retali-  
ation, if the sentence should be carried into execu-  
tion. Be has since acted the farce of sending in his  
resignation. This man isin every sense despicable.  
in adpition to the scene of knavery and prostitution,  
during his command in Philidelphia, which the late  
seizure of his papers has unfolded ; the history of bis  
command at West-Point is a history of little as well  
  
  
  
as great vilainies. He practised every dirty art of  
speculation, and even stooped to connections with the  
settlers of the garrison to defraud the pubdliec*  
  
T’&#x27;o his conduet, that of the captors of Andre forms  
a striking contrast; he tempted their integrity with  
the offer of his watch, his horse, and any sum of mon-  
ey they should name. They rejected his offers with  
indignation: and tie gold that could seduce a man  
high in the esteem and confidence of his country, who  
had the reputation and future glory to prop his integ-  
rity, had no charms for three simpie peasants, leaning  
anly’on their virtue and a sense of duty. While Ar-  
nold is handed down with execration to future times

His knowledge appeared without ostentation, and embellished  
by a diffidence that rarely accompanies so many talents and  
accomplishments ; which left you to suppose more than ap-

they had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocution

suppostion of my having conceived myself chliged by

Alexander Hamilton on MaJ, Andre.  
  
As there is a good deal said just now about  
Mai, Andre, there may he some interest in read­  
ing what Alexander Hamilton wrote of him at  
the time of his tragical death. The following  
extract is from Vol. 1. of til* works, page 170;  
“ Among the extraordinary circumstances that  
attended him In the midst of ins enemies, he  
died universally esteemed and universally re­  
gretted. &#x27;there was something singularly In­  
teresting lu the character and fortunes of An­  
dre. To an excellent understanding, well im­  
proved oy education und travel, ho united a pe­  
culiar elegeiue at mind and manners, und Dm  
odvsotago of a pleasing (wrsuu. ’ TUsaldho  
possessed a pretty taste for Die flue arts, and  
had himself attained some proficiency lu poetry,  
music, ami painting. His knowledge appeared  
without ostentation, and embellished by a dim­  
deuce that rarely accompanies so many talents  
and accomplishments, which left youlosuppo»e  
more than appeared. Ills sentiments were ele­  
vated and Inspired esteem; Diet had a softness  
that conciliated affection. His elocution was  
handsome; hts address easy; polite, and Insinu­  
ating. Hy his merit he had acquired the unlim­  
ited confidence of bis General, and was making  
a rapid progress In military rank and reputation,  
tlul iu the hie hi of tds career, flushed with new  
hopes, from the execution oi a project the most  
beneficial to his party Dial could bo devised, ho  
was at once precipitated from the summit of  
prosperity, And saw all tho expectations of his  
ambition blasted aud himself ruined.”

Hamilton&#x27;s description of Andre is  
worth quoting: &quot;There was some­  
thing singularly interesting in the  
character and fortunes of Andre. To  
  
an excellent understanding, well im  
  
proved by education and travel, he  
united a peculiar elegance of mind  
  
and manners, and the advantage of a  
  
pleasing person. &#x27;Tis said he  
poesessed a pretty taste for the fine aits,  
  
and had himself attained some pro­  
ficiency in poetry, music and painting.  
His knowledge sppeared without os­  
tentation, and embellished by a diffi­  
dence that rarely accom anies so  
many talents and accomplishments,  
which left you to suppose more than  
appeared. His sentiments wers ele­  
vated and inspired esteem; they had a  
softness that conciliated affection.  
His elocution was handsome; his ad­  
oress easy, polite and insinuating. By  
his merit he had acquired the un­  
limited confidence of his general, and  
was making a rapid progress in mili­  
tary rank and reputation. But, in  
the hight of his career, flushed with  
new hopes, from the execution of a  
project- the most beneficial to his  
party that could be devised--he was  
at once precipitated from the summit  
of prosperity and saw all the expecta­  
tions of his ambition blasted and him­  
self ruined.
