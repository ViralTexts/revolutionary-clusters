You ask me what are those operations of the British nation which are likely to befriend us, and how they will produce this effect? The British government, as you may naturally suppose, have it much at heart to reconcile their nation to the loss of America. This is essential to the repose, perhaps even to the safety of the king and his ministers. The most effectual engines for this purpose are the public papers. You know well that that government always kept a kind of standing army of newswriters who without any regard to truth, or to what should be like truth, invented and put into the papers whatever might serve the minister. This suffices with the mass of the people who have no means of distinguishing the false from the true paragraphs of a newspaper. When forced to acknolege our independance they were forced to redouble their efforts to keep the nation quiet. Instead of a few of the papers formerly engaged, they now engaged every one. No paper therefore comes out without a dose of paragraphs against America. These are calculated for a secondary purpose also, that of preventing the emigrations of their people to America. They dwell very much on American bankruptcies. To explain these would require a long detail, but would shew you that nine tenths of these bankruptcies are truly English bankruptcies in no wise chargeable on America. However they have produced effects the most desireable  of all others for us. They have destroyed our credit, and thus checked our disposition to luxury; and forcing our merchants to buy no more than they have ready money to pay for, they force them to go to those markets where that ready money will buy most. Thus you see they check our luxury, they force us to connect ourselves with all the world, and they prevent foreign emigrations to our country all of which I consider as advantageous to us. They are doing us another good turn. They attempt without disguise to possess themselves of the carriage of our produce, and to prohibit our own vessels from participating of it. This has raised a general indignation in America. The states see however that their constitutions have provided no means of counteracting it. They are therefore beginning to vest Congress with the absolute power of regulating their commerce, only reserving all revenue arising from it to the state in which it is levied. This will consolidate our federal building very much, and for this we shall be indebted to the British.  
You ask what I think on the expediency of encouraging our states to be commercial? Were I to indulge my own theory, I should wish them to practice neither commerce nor navigation, but to stand with respect to Europe precisely on the footing of China. We should thus avoid wars, and all our citizens would be husbandmen. Whenever indeed our numbers should so increase as that our produce would overstock the markets of those nations who should come to seek it, the farmers must either employ the surplus of their time in manufactures, or the surplus of our hands must be employed in manufactures, or in navigation. But that day would, I think be distant, and we should long keep our workmen in Europe, while Europe should be drawing rough materials and even subsistence from America. But this is theory only, and a theory which the servants of America are not at liberty to follow. Our people have a decided taste for navigation and commerce. They take this from their mother country: and their servants are in duty bound to calculate all their measures on this datum: we wish to do it by throwing open all the doors of commerce and knocking off it’s shackles. But as this cannot be done for others, unless they will do it to us, and there is no great probability that Europe will do this, I suppose we shall be obliged to adopt a system which may shackle them in our ports as they do us in theirs.

the political notions that succeed are a remark-  
able proof of the shrewdness and soundness of  
views of the writer :—  
  
You ask me what are those operations of the  
British nation, which are likely to befriend us, and  
how they will produce this effect? The British go-  
vernment, as you may naturally suppose, have it  
much at heart to reconcile their nation to the loss of  
America. This is essential to the repose, perhaps  
even to the safety, ofthe king and his ministers. The  
most effectual engines for this purpose are the public  
papers. You know well, that that government  
always kept a kind of standing army ofnews-writers,  
who, without any regard to truth, or to what should  
be like truth, invented, and put into the papers  
whatever might serve the ministers. This suffices  
with the mass of the people, who have no means of  
distinguishing the false, from the true paragraphs  
of a newspaper. When forced to acknowledge our  
independence, they were forced to redouble their  
efforts to keep the nation quiet. Instead ofa few of  
the papers formerly engaged, they now engaged  
every one. No paper, therefore, comes out without  
a dose of paragraphs against America. These are  
calculated for a secondary purpose also, that of pre-  
venting the emigrations of their people to America.  
They dwell very much on American bankruptcies.  
To explain these, would require a long detail ; but  
would show you that nine-tenths of these bankrupt-  
cies are truly English bankruptcies, in nowise  
chargeable on America. However, they have pro-  
duced effects the most desirable of all others for us :  
they have destroyed our credit, and thus checked  
our disposition to luxury; and, forcing our mer-  
chants to buy no more than they have ready money  
to pay for, they force them to go to those markets  
where that ready money will buy most. Thus, you  
see, they check our luxury, they force us to con-  
nect ourselves with all the world, and they prevent  
foreign emigrations to our country, all of which I  
consider as advantageous to us. They are doing us  
another good turn. They attempt, without disguise,  
to possess themselves of the carriage of our produce,  
and to pened our own vessels from participating  
in it. This has raised a general indignation in Ame-  
rica. The states see, however, that their constitu-  
tions have provided no means of counteracting it.  
They are therefore beginning to vest Congress with  
the absolute power of regulating their commerce,  
only reserving all revenue arising from it, tothe state  
in which it is levied. This will consolidate our fe-  
deral building very much, and for this we shall be  
indebted to the British.  
  
“ You ask what I think on the expediency of en-  
couraging our states to be commercial. Were I to  
indulge my own theory, I should wish them to prac-  
tise neither commerce nor navigation, but to stand,  
with —— to Europe, precisely on the footing of  
China. We should thus avoid wars, and all our citi-  
zens would be husbandmen. Whenever, indeed,  
our numbers should so increase, as that our produce  
would overstock the markets of those nations who  
should come to seek it, the farmers must either  
employ the surplus of their time in manufactures,  
or the surplus of our hands must be employed in ma-  
nufactures or in navigation. But that day would, I  
think, be distant, and we should long keep our work-  
men in saan while Europe should be drawing  
rough materials,and even subsistence,from America.  
But this is theory only, and a theory which the ser-  
vants of America are not at liberty to follow. Our  
people have a decided taste for navigation and com-  
merce. They take this from their mother country ;  
and their servants are in duty bound to calculate all  
their measures on this datum : we wish to do it by  
throwing open all the doors of commerce,and knock-  
ing off its shackles. But as this cannot be done for  
others, unless they will do it for us, and there is no  
great probability that Europe will do this, I sup-  
  
  
  
pose we shall be obliged to adopt a system which  
may shackle them jin our ports, as they do us in  
theirs.” 343-44.

&quot;You ask what I think on the expediency  
of encouraging our States to be commer­  
cial? Were I to Indulge my own theory  
I should wish them to practice neither  
commerce nor navigation; to stand, with  
respect to Europe, on the footing of  
China. We should thus avoid wars and  
. our citizens would be husbandmen.  
Whenever, indeed, our numbers should so  
increase as that our produce would over­  
stock the markets of those nations who  
should come to seek It the farmers must  
either employ the surplus of their times  
In manufactures or the surplus of our  
hands must be employed In manufactures  
or navigation. But that day would. I think,  
be distant and we should long keep our  
workmen In Europe, while Kurope should  
be drawing rough materials, and even  
subsistence, from America. But this 13  
theory only, and a theory which the  
servants of America are not at liberty to  
follow. Our people have a decided taste  
for navigation and commerce. They take  
this from their mothsr country, ind their  
servants are in duty bound to calculate  
all these measures on this datum. We  
wish to do it by throwing open all the  
doors of commerce and knocking off its  
shackles. But this cannot be done for  
othera unless they will do it for us, and  
there Is no great probability that Europe  
will do this. I suppose we shall be  
obliged to adopt a system which may  
shaeklo them in our ports, as they do us  
in theirs.
