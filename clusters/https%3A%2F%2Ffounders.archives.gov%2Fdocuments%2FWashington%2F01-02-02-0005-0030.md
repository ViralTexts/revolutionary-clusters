e River to discover what kind of Lands lay upon the Kanhawa. The Land on both sides this River just at the Mouth is very fine; but on the East side when you get towards the Hills (which I judge to be about 6 or 700 yards from the River) it appears to be wet, &amp; better adapted for Meadow than tillage. This bottom continues up the East side for about 2 Miles, &amp; by going up the Ohio a good Tract might be got of bottom Land Including the old Shawna Town, which is about 3 Miles up the Ohio just above the Mouth of a C[ree]k—where the aforementiond bottom ends on the East side the Kanhawa. An[othe]r begins on the W. which extends up it at least 50 Miles by the Indns. Acct. and of great width (to be ascertaind, as we come down) in many places very rich, in others somewhat wet &amp; pondy; fit for Meadow; but upon the whole exceeding valuable, as the Land after you get out of the Rich bottom is very good for Grain tho not rich. We judgd we went up this River about 10 Miles today. On the East side appear to be some good bottoms but small—neither long nor wide, &amp; the Hills back of them rather steep &amp; poor.  
  
  
  
The Great Kanawha.  
  
  
  
  
  
Novr. 2d. We proceeded up the River with the Canoe about 4 Miles more, &amp; then incampd &amp; went a Hunting; killd 5 Buffaloes &amp;  
  
wounded some others—three deer &amp;ca. This Country abounds in Buffalo &amp; wild game of all kinds; as also in all kinds of wild fowl, the⟨re⟩ being in the Bottoms a great many small grassy Ponds or Lakes which are full of Swans, Geese, &amp; Ducks of different kinds.  
Some of our People went up the River 4 or 5 Miles higher &amp; found the same kind of bottom on the West side, &amp; we were told by the Indians that it continued to the Falls which they judgd to be 50 or 60 Miles higher up. This Bottom next the Water (in most places) is very rich. As you approach to the Hills you come (in many) to a thin white Oak Land, &amp; poor. The Hills as far as we coud judge were from half a Mile to a Mile from the River; poor &amp; steep in the parts we see, with Pine growing on them. Whether they are generally so, or not, we cannot tell but I fear they are.  
  
  
  
Saturday 3d. We set of down the River on our return homewards, and Incampd at the Mouth; at the Beginning of the Bottom above the Junction of the Rivers, and at the Mouth of a branch on the Eastside, I markd two Maples, an Elm, &amp; Hoopwood Tree as A Cornr. of the Soldiers L[an]d (if we can get it) intending to take all the bottom from hence to the Rapids in the Great Bent into one Survey. I also markd at the Mouth of another Gut lower down on the West side (at the lower end of the long bottom) an Ash and hoopwood for the Beginning of another of the Soldiers Survey to extend up so as to Include all the Bottom (in a body) on the West side.  
In coming from our last Incampment up the Kanhawa I endeavourd to take the courses &amp; distances of the River by a Pocket Compass, &amp; guessing;

. After passing these Hills (which may run on the River near a Mile) there appears to be another pretty good Bottom on the East side. At this place we met a Canoe going to the Illinoies with Sheep and at this place also, that is at the end of the Bottom from the Kanhawa, just as we came to the Hills, we met with a Sycamore abt. 60 yards from the River of a most extraordinary size it measuring (3 feet from the Gd.) 45 feet round, lacking two Inches &amp; not 50 yards from it was another 31.4 round (3 feet from the Gd. also).  
The 2d. Bottom hinted at the other side (that is the one lying above the Bottom that reaches from the Kanhawa) is that taken notice of the 30th. Ulto. to lye in the shape of a Horse Shoe, &amp; must from its situation, &amp; quantity of level Ground be very valuable, if the Land is but tolerably good.  
After passing this bottom &amp; abt. a Mile of Hills we enterd into the 3d. Bottom and Incampd. This bottom reaches within about half a Mile of the Rapid at the point of the Great Bent.

Roy Bird Cook suggests this camp was “about the mouth of Broad Creek, above New Haven, West Virginia” (cookRoy Bird Cook. Washington’s Western Lands. Strasburg, Va., 1930., 27).  
  
  
  
  
  
Monday 5th. I set of the Canoe with our Baggage &amp; walkd across the Neck on foot with Captn. Crawford distant according to our Walking about 8 Miles as we kept a strait course under the Foot of the Hills which run about So. Et. &amp; was two hours &amp; an half walking of it.  
This is a good Neck of Land the Soil being generally good; &amp; in places very rich. Their is a large proportion of Meadow Ground, and the Land as high, dry, &amp; Level as one coud wish. The growth in most places is beach intermixd with walnut &amp;ca. but more especially with Poplar (of which there are numbers very large). The Land towards the upper end is black Oak, &amp; very good. Upon the whole a valuable Tract might be had here, &amp; I judge the quantity to be about 4000 Acres.  
After passing this Bottom &amp; the Rapid, as also some Hills wch. just pretty close to the River, we came to that Bottom before remarkd the 29th. Ulto.; which b

n able to judge, either from my own observations or from information, is nearly the same, that is exceeding une⟨ven⟩ &amp; Hilly; &amp; I do presume that there is no body’s of Flat rich Land to be found till one gets far enough from the River to head the little runs &amp; drains that comes through the Hills; &amp; to the Sources (or near it) of the Creeks &amp; there Branches. This it seems is the case of the Lands upon Monogahela and yaughe. &amp; I fancy holds good upon this River till you get into the Flat Lands (or near them) below the Falls.  
The Bottom Land differs a good deal in quality. That highest up the River in general is richest; tho the Bottoms are neither so wide or long, as those below. Walnut, H. Loc⟨ust⟩ Cherry, &amp; some other Woods, that grow Snarly, &amp; neither Tall nor large, but coverd with Grape Vines (with the Fruit of which this Country at this Instant abounds) are the growth of the Richest Bottoms, but on the other hand these Bottoms appear to me to be the lowest &amp; most subject to Floods. Sugar Tree and Ash, mixd with Walnut &amp;ca. compose the growth of the next richest low grounds and Beach Poplar Oaks &amp;ca. the last. The Soil of this is also good but inferior to either of the other kinds &amp; beach Bottoms are excepted against on Acct. of the difficulty of clearing them there Roots spreading over a large Surface of Ground &amp; being hard to kill.

‘The Indians,” he wrote, “ who re-  
side upon the Ohio, the upper part of  
it at least, are composed of Shawanese,  
Delawares, and somé of the Mingoes,  
who, getting but little part of the con-  
sideration that was given for the lands  
eastward of the Ohio [at the treaty of  
Fort Stanwix, before mentioned], view  
the settlements of the people upon this  
[the branches of the Ohio] river with  
  
  
  
HISTORY OF OHIO,  
  
an uneasy and jealous eye, and do not  
scruple to say that they must be com-  
pensated for their right if the people  
settle thereon, notwithstanding the ces-  
sion of the Six Nations. On the other  
hand, the people of Virginia and else-  
where are exploring and marking all  
the lands that are valuable, not only on  
the Redstone [in what is now Fayette  
county, Pennsylvania] and other waters  
on the Monongahela, but along the  
Ohio as low as the Little Kanawha ;  
and by the next summer I suppose they  
will get to the Great Kanawha, at  
least.”
