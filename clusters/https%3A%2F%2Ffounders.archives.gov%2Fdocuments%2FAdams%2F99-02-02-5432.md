ar’s entertainment, the following  
MANIFESTO.George R.Through the whole course of our reign, our conduct  
towards the States General of the United Provinces, has  
been that of a sincere friend and faithful ally. Had they  
adhered to those wise principles which used to govern the  
republic, they must have shewn themselves equally solicitous to maintain the friendship which has so long subsisted  
between the two nations; and which is essential to the interests of both.—But from the prevalence of a faction devoted to France, and following the dictates of that court,  
a very different policy has prevailed. The return made  
to our friendship for some time past, has been an open  
contempt of the most solemn engagements, and a repeated  
violation of public faith.On the commencement of the defensive war, in which  
we found ourselves engaged, by the aggression of France,  
we shewed a tender regard to the interests of the States  
General, and a desire of securing to their subjects every  
advantage of trade consistent with the great and just principles of our own defence. Our ambassador was instructed  
to offer a friendly negociation, to obviate every thing that  
might lead to disagreeable discussions; and to this offer,  
solemnly made by him to the States General, the 2d of  
November, 1778, no attention was paid.After the number of our enemies increased, by the aggression of Spain, equally unprovoked with that of France,  
we found it necessary to call upon the States General for  
the performance of their engagements. The fifth article  
of the perpetual defensive alliance between our crown and  
the States General, concluded at Westminster, the 3d of  
March, 1678, besides the general engagement for succors,  
expressly stipulates, ‘That that party of the two allies  
that is not attacked, shall be obliged to break with the aggressor, in two months after the party attacked shall require it’—yet two years have passed without the least  
assistance given to us, without a single syllable in answer  
to our repeated demands.So totally regardless have the states been of their treaties with us, that they readily promised to observe a neutrality, in direct contradiction to those engagements; and  
whilst they have withheld from us the succors they were  
bound to furnish, every secret assistance has been given to  
the enemy, and inland duties have been taken off for the  
sole purpose of facilitating the carriage of naval stores to  
France.In direct and open violation of treaty, they suffered an  
American pirate to remain several weeks in one of their  
ports, and even permitted a part of his crew to mount  
guard in a fort in the Texel.In the East Indies, the subjects of the States General, in  
concert with France, have endeavored to raise up enemies  
against us.In the West Indies, particularly at St. Eustatia, every  
protection and assistance has been given to our rebellious  
subjects.—Their privateers are openly received in the  
Dutch harbors; allowed to refit there; supplied with  
arms and ammunition; their crews recruited; their prizes  
brought in and sold; and all this in direct violation of as  
clear and solemn stipulations as can be made.This conduct, so inconsistent with all good faith, so  
repugnant to the sense of the wisest part of the Dutch  
nation, is chiefly to be ascribed to the prevalence of the  
leading magistrates of Amsterdam, whose secret correspondence with our rebellious subjects was suspected long  
before it was made known by the fortunate discovery of a  
treaty, the first article of which is, that‘There shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace,  
and sincere friendship, between their High Mightinesses  
the states of the Seven United Provinces of Holland, and  
the United States of North America, and the subjects  
and people of the said parties; and between the countries, islands, cities and towns, situated under the jurisdiction of the said United States of Holland, and the  
said United States of America, and the people and inhabitants thereof, of every degree, without exception of persons or places.’This treaty was signed in September, 1778, by the express order of the pensionary of Amsterdam, (Mr. Van  
Berckell to Mr. De Neufville) and other principal magistrates of that city (viz. the Burgomasters Temmink,  
Hoofdt, &amp;c.) They now not only avow the whole transaction, but glory in it, and expressly say, even to the States  
General, that what they did, was what their indispensable  
duty required.In the mean time, the States General declined to give any  
answer to the memorial presented by our ambassador; and  
this refusal was aggravated by their proceeding upon other  
business, nay, upon the consideration of this very subject,  
to internal purposes; and while they found it impossible  
to approve the conduct of their subjects, they still industriously avoided to give us the satisfaction so manifestly  
due.We had every right to expect, that such a discovery  
would have roused them to a just indignation at the insult  
offered to us, and to themselves; and that they would  
have been eager to give us full and ample satisfaction for  
the offence, and to inflict the severest punishment upon  
the offenders.—The urgency of the business made an instant answer essential to the honor and safety of this country.  
The demand was accordingly pressed by our ambassador,  
in repeated conferences with the ministers, and in a second  
memorial: it was pressed with all the earnestness which  
could proceed from our ancient friendship, and the sense  
of recent injuries: and the answer now given to a memorial on such a subject, presented more than five weeks ago,  
is, that the states have taken it ad referendum.—Such an  
answer, upon such an occasion, could only be dictated by  
the fixed purpose of hostility, meditated and already resolved by the States, induced by the offensive counsels of  
Amsterdam, thus to countenance the hostile aggression,  
which the magistrates of that city have made in the name  
of the republic.There is an end of the faith of all treaties with them, if  
Amsterdam may usurp the sovereign power; may violate  
those treaties with impunity, by pledging the states to engagements directly contrary, and leaguing the republic  
with the rebels of a sovereign, to whom she is bound by  
the closest ties.—An infraction of the law of nations, by  
the meanest member of any country, gives the injured state  
a right to demand satisfaction and punishment: How much  
more so, when the injury complained of, is a flagrant  
violation of public faith, committed by leading and predominant members of the State? Since then the satisfaction we have demanded, is not given, we must, though  
most reluctantly, do ourselves that justice which we cannot otherwise obtain: We must consider the States General as parties in the injury which they will not repair;  
as sharers in the aggression which they refuse to punish;  
and must act accordingly. We have therefore ordered  
our ambassador to withdraw from the Hague, and shall  
immediately pursue such vigorous measures as the occasion  
fully justifies, and our dignity and the essential interest of  
our people require.From a regard to the Dutch nation at large, we wish  
it were possible, to direct those measures wholly against  
Amsterdam; but this cannot be, unless the States General  
will immediately declare, that Amsterdam shall, upon this  
occasion, receive no assistance from them, but be left to  
abide the consequences of its aggression. Whilst Amsterdam is suffered to prevail in the general counsels, and is  
backed by the strength of the State, it is impossible to resist the aggression of so considerable a part, without contending with the whole.—But we are too sensible of the  
common interests of both countries, not to remember in the  
midst of such a contest, that the only point to be aimed at by  
us, is, to raise a disposition in the counsels of the republic, to  
return to our ancient union, by giving us that satisfaction  
for the past, and security for the future, which we shall be  
as ready to receive as they can be to offer, and to the attainment of which, we shall direct all our operations. We  
mean only to provide for our own security, by defeating  
the dangerous designs that have been formed against us.  
We shall ever be disposed to return to friendship with the  
States General, when they sincerely revert to that system  
which the wisdom of their ancestors formed, and which  
has now been subverted by a powerful faction, conspiring  
with France against the true interests of the republic, no  
less than against those of Great Britain.G. R.St. James’s, Dec. 20, 1780.At the Court of St. James’s, the 20th of December, 1780.Present,“The King’s most excellent Majesty in Council.His Majesty having taken into consideration the many  
injurious proceedings of the States General of the United  
Provinces, and their subjects, as set forth in his Royal  
Manifesto of this date; and being determined to take  
such measures as are necessary for vindicating the honor of  
his crown, and for procuring reparation and satisfaction,  
is pleased, by and with the advice of his Privy Council, to  
order, and it is hereby ordered, that general reprisals be  
granted against the ships, goods and subjects of the States  
General of the United Provinces, so that, as well his Majesty’s fleets and ships, as also all other ships and vessels  
that shall be commissionated by letters of marque or general reprisals or otherwise, by his Majesty’s commissioners,  
for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of G.  
Britain, shall and may lawfully seize all ships, vessels and  
goods belonging to the States General of the United Provinces or their subjects, or others inhabiting within any of the  
territories of the aforesaid States General, and bring the same  
to judgment in any of the courts of Admiralty within his Majesty’s dominions. And to that end his Majesty’s Advocate  
General, with the Advocate of the Admiralty are forthwith  
to prepare the draught of a commission, and present the  
same to his Majesty at this board, authorising the commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, or  
any person or persons by them empowered and appointed,  
to issue forth and grant letters of Marque and Reprisal to  
any of his Majesty’s subjects, or others whom the said  
commissioners shall deem fitly qualified in that behalf, for  
the apprehending, seizing and taking the ships, vassals and  
goods belonging to the States General of the United Provinces, and their vessels and subjects, or any inhabiting  
within the countries, territories or dominions of the aforesaid States General; and that such powers and clauses be  
inserted in the said commission as have been usual and  
are according to former precedents; and his Majesty’s  
said Advocate General, with the Advocate of the Admiralty,  
are also forthwith to prepare the draught of a commission,  
and present the same to his Majesty at this board, authorising the said commissioners for executing the office of  
Lord High Admiral to will and require the High Court of  
Admiralty of Great Britain and the lieutenant and judge  
of said court, his surrogate or surrogates, as also the several courts of Admiralty within his Majesty’s dominions to  
take cognizance of, and judicially proceed upon all and  
all manner of captures, seizures, prizes and reprisals of  
all ships and goods that are or shall be taken, and to hear  
and determine the same; and accordingly to adjudge  
and condemn all such ships, vessels and goods as shall  
belong to the States General of the United Provinces, or  
their vassals and subjects, or to any others inhabiting  
within any of the countries, territories and dominions of  
the aforesaid States General; and that such powers and  
clauses be inserted in said commission as have been usual  
and are according to former precedents; and they are  
likewise to prepare and lay before his Majesty at this  
board, a draught of such instructions as may be proper  
to be sent to the courts of Admiralty in his Majesty’s foreign governments and plantations, for their guidance  
herein; as also, another draught of instructions for such  
ships as shall be commissionated for the purposes aforementioned.”The Dutch nation had still flattered itself with a hope  
that the British government would not proceed to the la

was yt “long before it was “mide  
known by the ortunate diftovéry of u&#x27;trér ty,  
  
the firk article of which is :—  
  
“ There fhall be a fitm, inviolable, and  
univerfal peace, aud fincere friendihip,  
between their high mightineffes the Bftates  
of the Seven United Provinces of Mollanda,  
and the United States of North Armrerics,  
and the fubjeéts and people of the faid par-  
ties; and between the countries, ifands,  
cities, and towns, fituated urider the jurif-  
dition of the faid United States of Holland,  
and the faid united flates of America, ~ and  
the people and inhabitunts theréof, of  
a i without exeeption of perfons  
or places.”  
  
his treaty was figned in September&#x27;t773,  
by the exprefé order of the Penfionary of  
mfterdam, and other principal magiftrates  
of that ticy. ‘They now not only avow the  
whole tranfaGtion, but gloty in tt, and ¢k-  
prefsly fay, even to the States General, that  
what they did “ was what their irdifpenh-  
ble duty required.”  
  
In the meaf time, the States General de-  
Clined to give any anfwer to the mémofial  
prefentéed by our amibaffador; and the refu-  
fal was aggravated by their proceeding upon  
other bufinefs, nay, upon thé cinfideration  
of this very fobje€t to internal purpofed ;  
and while they found it impoffible to ap-  
prove the conduct of their fubjeéti, they  
ftill induftrioufly avoided to give us the fa-  
tisfa€tion fo manifeffly due.  
  
We had every right to expe, that fuch a  
difcovery would have ronfed them to a juft  
indignation at the infult offered to us, and  
to themfelves; and that they would have  
been eager to give us full and ample fatis~-  
fa&amp;tion for the offence, and to infti@ the  
  
“feveref® “punithmert upon the ‘offenders.  
  
The urgency of the bufinefs made an infant  
an{wer effentia!l to the henour and fafety of  
this country. The demand was accordingly  
prefied by our ambaffador in repeated con-  
ferences with the minifters, and in a fecond  
memorial: It was prefléd with all the ear-  
neftnefs which could proceed from our an-  
cient friendfhip, aad the fenfe of recene in-  
  
juries; and the anfwer now given toa me-.  
  
morial on fuch a fubject, delivered above  
five weeks ago, is, that the States have  
taken it ad referendum. Such an anfwer,  
upon fuch an o¢cafion, could only be di@tar-  
ed by the fixed purpofe of hoftility medj-  
tated, and already refolved, ty the States,  
induced by the offenfive councils of Amfler-  
dam thusfo countenance the hoftile agref-  
  
fion, which the magiftrates of that city have  
  
made in the name of the republick,  
There is an end of the. faith of all trea-  
ties with them, if Amfterdam may ufurp  
the fovereign power, may violate thofe trea-  
ties with impunity, by p&#x27;edging the Srates to  
engagemonts direétly contrary, and Seaguing

to whom the is bound by the clofeft ties.  
An infra€tion of the law of nations by the  
  
‘ meaneft member of any country, gives the  
injured ftate a right to demand fatisfaétion  
and punifhment:—How much more fo,  
when the injury complained of is a violation  
of publick faith, committed by leading and  
predominant members in the ftate? Since  
then the fatisfaction we have demanded is  
not given, we muft, though moft reluétant-  
ly, do ourfelves that juftice which we can-  
not otherwife obtain: We muft confider the  
States General as parties in the injury which  
they will not repair, as tharers in the aggref-  
  
. fion which they refufe to punifh, and muft  
act accordingly. We have therefore order-  
dered our ambaflador to withdraw from the  
Hague, and thall immediately purfue fuch  
vigorous meafures as the occafion fully jufti-  
fies, and our dignity and the effential inter-  
efts of our people require.  
  
Whilft Amfterdam is foffered to prevail  
in the general councils, and is backed by the  
ftrength of the ftate, it is impoffible to refift  
the agerefifon of fo confiderable a part, with-  
out contending with the whole, But we are  
too fenfible of the common interefts of both  
  
‘countries not to remember, in the midi of  
fuch a cqnteft, that the —y point to be  
airaed at by us, is to raife a difpofition in the  
councils of the republick to return to our  
ancient union, by giving us that fatisfaction  
for the pat, and fecurity for the future, which  
we fhall be as ready to receive as they can be  
to offer, and to the attainment of which we  
fall direét all our operations, We mean  
only to provide for our own lecurity, by de-  
fraying the dangerous defigns that have been  
formed againft us. We thall ever be difpofed  
to return to friendhip with the States  
General, -when they fiacerely revert to that  
fyftem which the wifdom of their anceftors  
formed, and which hes now been _fubverted

GEORGE R.  
  
¢L. S.) Hrough the whole courfe of  
  
our reign, our conduét to-  
wards the States-general of the United  
Provinces has been that of a fincere friend  
and faithful ally. Had they adhered to  
thofe wife principles which ufed to govern  
the Republic, they muft have fhewn them-  
felves equally folicitous to maintain the  
friendthip which has fo long fubfitted be-  
tween the two pations, and which is eflen-  
tial to the interefts of both: but from the  
prevalence of a faétion devoted to France,  
and following the di&amp;tates of that Court,  
avery different policy has prevailed. The  
seturn made to our friendthip, for fome  
time paft, has been an open contempt of  
the mot folemn engagements, and a re-  
peated violation of public faith. _  
  
On the commencement of the defenfive  
war, in which we found ourfelves engaged  
by the aggreffion of France, we fhewed a  
tender regard for the interefts of the States-  
general, and a defire of fecuring to their  
fubjefis every advantage of trade, confiftent  
with the great and juft principie of our  
own defence. Our Ambaflador was in-  
ftruéted to offer a friendly negociation, to  
obviate every thing that might lead to dif-  
agreeable difcuflion; and to this offer fo-  
lemnly made by him to the States-general,  
the 2d of November, 1773, no attention  
was paid.  
  
After the number of our enemies in-  
creafed by the aggreflion of Spain, equally  
unprovoked with that of France, we found  
it neceffary to call upon the States-general  
for the performance of their engag-ments.  
  
  
  
The fifth article of the perpetual defenfive  
alliance between our Crown and the  
States-general, concluded at Wefiminiter  
the 3d of March, 1678, befides the gene-  
ral engagements for fuccours, exprefsly {ti-  
pulates, ¢ That that party of the two al-  
lies that is not attacked, fhall be obliged  
to break with the aggreffor in two months  
after the party attacked thal] require it :*—  
Yet two years have pafled, without the leaft  
affittance given to us, without a fingle {yl-  
lable in anfwer to our repeated demands.  
  
So totally regardlefs have the States  
been of their treaties with us, that they  
readily promifed our enemies to obferve a  
newtrality, in direct contradi&amp;tion to thofe  
engagements ; and whilft they have with-  
held from us the fuccours they were bound  
to furnifh, every fecret affiftance has been  
given the enemy; and inland duties have  
been taken off, for the fole purpofe of fa-  
cilitating the carriage of naval itores to  
France.  
  
In direé&amp;t and.epen violation of treaty,  
they fuffered an American pirate to remain  
fevera] weeks in one of their ports, and  
even peamitted a part of his crew to mount  
guard in a fort in the ‘Texel.  
  
In the Eaft-Indies, the fubjeéts of the  
States. general, in concert with France,  
have endeavoured to raife up enemies a-  
gaint us.  
  
In the Weft Indies, particularly at St.  
Euftatia, every p:oteétion and affiftance  
has been given to our rebellious fubjedis.  
Their privateers are cpenly received in the  
Dotch harbours; alluwed to refit there 5

crews ‘recruited ; their prizes bee rght in  
and fold ; and all this in dire&amp;t violation of  
as Gear and folemn ftipulations as can be  
made.  
  
This conduct, fo inconfiftent with all  
good faith, fo repugnant to the fenle of ihe  
wifeft part of the Dutch nation, is clyefly  
to be afcribed to the prevalence of the  
leading Magiftrates of Amfterdam, whofe  
fecret cotrefpondence with our rebellious  
fubjects was fulpeSted, long before it was  
made known by the fortunate difcovery  
of a treaty, the fult article of which is:—  
  
€ There thail be a firm, inviolable, and  
univerfal peace, and fincere friendhip,  
between their High Mightineflzs the Et-  
tates of the Seven United Provinces of  
Holland, andthe United States of North-  
America, and the fubje&amp;ts and people of  
the faid patties: and between the coun-  
tries, iflands, cities, and towns, firuated  
under the jurifdiGtion of the faid United  
States of Holland, and the faid United  
States of America, and the people and in-  
habitants thereof, of every degree, without  
excéption of peifons or places.”  
  
This treaty was fizned in September,  
1773, by the exprefs order of the Penfi-  
onary of Amfterdam, and other principal  
Magiltrates of that city.—They now not  
ouly avow the whole tranfa&amp;tion, but glory  
init, and exprefsly fay, even to the States-  
general, that what they did ¢ was what  
their indifpenfable duty required.”  
  
In the mean time, the States-general de-  
clined to give any anfwer to the Memorial  
prefented by our Ambaflador; and this re-  
fufal was aggravated by they proceeding  
upon other bufinels, nay vpon the cond-  
deration of this very fubjeét 10 internal pur-  
poles ; and, while they found it impoffible to  
approve the conduét of their (ubjects, they  
Rill induftrioufly avoided to give us* the  
fatisfaction fo manifetlly due.  
  
We had every right to expect, that fuch  
a difcovery would have rouféd them toa jut  
indignation at the infalt offered to us, and  
to themfelves ; and that they would have  
been eager to give us full and ample farif-  
faction tor the offence, and to inflict the  
feveret pumfhment upon the offenders.  
The urgency of the bufinefs made an in-  
flant anfwer eflential to the honour and  
fafety of this country. The demand was  
accordingly preff&lt;d by our Ambaffador in  
tepeated conferences with the Minifters,  
and in a fecond Memorial ; it was prefled  
with all the earneftne{s which could pro-  
ceed from cur ancicnt friendihip and the  
feale of recentinjuries; and the anfwer now  
given toa Memozial on fuch a fubjedt, de-  
  
livered above five wecks ‘ago, is, ‘ That  
the States have taken it ad referendum.’—  
Such an anfwer, upon fuch an occafion,  
could only be diStated by the fixt purpofe  
of hoitility meditated, and already refolved,  
by the States, induced by the offenfive  
Councils of Amflerdam thus to counte-  
nance the hoftile aggreffion, which the  
Migiftrates of that city have made in the  
name of the Republic.  
  
There is an end cf the faith of all treaties  
with them, if &#x27;Amfterdam may ufurp the  
fovereign power, may violate thofe treaties  
with impunity, by pledging the States to  
engagements direétly contrary, and leaguing  
the Republic with the Rebels of a Sove-  
reign to whom fhe is bound by the clofelt  
ties. An infra€tion of the law of nations,  
by the meaneft Member of any country,  
gives the injured Srate a right to demand  
fatisfation and puntfhment :—how mucha  
more fo, when the injury complained of is  
a flagrant violation of public faith, com-  
mitted by leading and predominant Mem-  
bers in the State? Since then the [atisfa&amp;tioa  
we have demanded is not given, we muft,  
though moft reluGantly, co ourfelves that  
jultice which we cannot otherwife obtain :  
we mult confider the States-general as  
ptrties in the injury which they will not  
repair, as fharers in the aggreflion which  
they refute to punifh, and muft act accord-  
ingly. We have therefore ordered our  
Ambnfiader to withdraw from the Hague,  
and thall immediately purfue fach vigo-  
rous meafures as the occation fully juftifies,  
and our dignity and the efential interefts of  
our people require.  
  
From a regard to the Dutch nation at  
large, we wilh it were pofiible to direét  
thoie meafures wholly againft Amfterdam ;  
but this cannot be, unlefs the States-gene-  
ral will immediately declare, that Amiter-  
dam ‘hall, upon this occafion, reccive no  
aflitance from them, but be left to abide  
the confequences of its aggreffion.  
  
Whilit Amtterdam is luffered to prevail  
in the general Councils, and is badked by  
the fyength of the State, it is impoflible to  
relift tle apgrefijion of fo confiderable a  
part, without contendiwg with the whole.  
But we dre too fenfible of the common  
interefts of both countries not to remember,  
in the midft of fuch a conteft, that the  
only point to be aimed at by us is to raile  
a difpofition in the Councils of the Re-  
public to return to our ancient union, by  
giving us that fatisfaction for the paft, and  
fecusity for the future, which we thall be

return made to our friendfhip, for: fome  
time paft,has been an open contempt of the  
mot folemn engagements, and repeated  
violation of public faith.  
  
On the commencement of the defen-  
five war, tn which we found ourfelves  
engaged by the aggreflion of France, we  
fhewed a tender regard for the interefts  
of the ftates general, and a defire of fe-  
curing to their fubje@ts every advantage  
of trade, confiftent with the great and  
juft principle of our own defence. Our  
ambaflador was iniftructed to offer a friend-  
ly negociation, to obviite every thing  
that might lead to difagreeable difcuflion ;  
and to this offer, folemnly made by him  
to the ftates general, the iecond of No-  
vember, 1778, no attention was paid.  
  
After the number of our enemies in-  
creafed, by the aggrefiion of Spain, equ: -  
ly 1 unprovok ed with that of France, we  
found it neceffiry to call upon the ftates  
general for the performance of their en-  
gagements. ‘The fitth article of the per-  
petual defentive alliance between  
crown and the ftates general, concluded  
at Weltmintter the 3d of Miarch, 1678  
befides the general engagement for fice  
cours, expretsly ftipulates, ‘* That that  
party of the two allies that 1s not at-  
tacked, fhall be obliged to break with  
the agereffor in two months after the  
party attacked fhall require it:”—Yet  
two years have paffed, without the heaft  
ajittance given to us, without a fingle  
  
Owur  
  
fyllable in anfwer to our repeated de-  
mands.  
So totally regardlefs have the ftates  
  
been of their treaties  
readily promifed  
a neutralii V; in  
thofe enga  
withheld f  
  
with us, that they  
our enemies to obferve  
direft contradiction to  
cements ; and whilft they have  
from us the fuccours they were  
bound to furnith, every fecret afliftance  
  
has been given the enemy; and inland  
duties have been taken off, for the fole  
  
purpofe of the  
naval ftores to France.  
  
In direct and open violation of treaty,  
they faffered an American pirate to re-  
main feveral weeks in one of their ports ;  
and even permitt | a part of his crew  
to mount guard in a fort&#x27;in the Texel.  
  
In the Eaft-Indies, the fubjecis of the  
flates general, in concert with Irance,  
have endeavoured to raife up enemics  
againft u-  
  
In the Wett. Indies, particularly at St.  
Fuitatius, every protection and afliftance  
has been given to our rebellious fubjects.  
Their privateers are openly received in  
the Dutch-harbours; allowed to refit  
there ; fupplied with arms and ammunie

ret violation of as clear and folemn fti-  
pulations as can be made.  
  
This eondudl, to inconfittent with ali  
  
good faith, fo repugnant to the fenfe of  
  
the wifeit part of the Dutch nation, is  
chiefly to be aicribed to the prevalence  
of the leading magtitrates of Amitterdam,  
whole fecret correfpondence with our re-  
  
bellious tubjects was fnipectcd, long before .  
  
it was made known by the fortunate dif-  
covery of a treatyy the firit article of  
ace is i—  
  
There thall be a firm, inviolable  
sd univerial peace, and lincere friend-  
ihip, between their High Mightinefles  
the Eitates of the Seven United Provine  
Ces of Ho lian! &quot; and th &gt; United States of  
North America, .and ‘the fubjeéts and  
people of the faid parties; and between  
the countries, tlands, cities, and towns,  
fituated under the jurifdiction of the iaid  
United States of Holland, and the faid  
United States of America, and the peo-  
ple and inhabitants thereof, of every de-  
gree, without exception of perfons or  
places.”  
  
This treaty was figned in Septem! bers  
1778, by tbe exprefs order of the pentios  
nary - Amiterdam, and other principal  
magiltrates of that city.—They now not  
only avow the whole tranfadion, but  
glory init, and expreisly fay, even to the  
ftates-general, that what they did ‘* wag  
what their indtfpenfable duty required.”  
  
In the mean time the States General”  
  
declined to give any anfwer to the mem6-  
rial prefented by eur Ambafflador; and  
this refutal was aggravated by their pro«  
ceeding upon other bulinefs, nay upon  
the confideration of this very fubje@ to  
internal pwrpofes 5 and while they found  
it impofhble to approve the condudt of  
their fubjects, they fill induftrioufly avoid-  
ed to give us the fatisfaction fo manifeitly  
due.  
We had every right to expect, that fuch  
a difcgvery would have roufed them to a  
juft indignation at the infult offered to us,  
and to themfelves ; and that they would  
have been eager to give us full.and am-  
ple fatisfadtion for the offence, and to in-  
flict the fevereft punifhment upon the of-  
fenders. The urgency of the bufinefs  
made an initant anfwer effential to the  
honour and fafety of this country. The  
demand was accordingly prefled by our  
ambaffador in repeated conferences with  
the minifters, and in a fecond memorial:  
it was prefied with all the earnettnefs  
which could proceed from our antient  
friendfhip, and the fenfe of recent injuries ;

718 Order for Reprifals.  
  
weeks ago, 18, That the States have taken  
tt ad referendum.—Such an anfwer, upon  
fuch an occafion, could only be dictated  
by the fixt purpofe of holtility meditated,  
and already refolved, by the ftates, in-  
duced by the offenfive councils of Amifter-  
dam thus to countenance the hofltile ag-  
greflion, which the magiftrates of that city  
have made inthe name of the Republic.  
There is an end of the faith of all trea-  
tics with them, if Amfterdam may uiurp  
the foveretyn power, may violate thofe  
treatics with impunity, by pledging the  
States to engagements directly contrary,  
and leaguing the Republic wi ith the Rebels  
of a fovereign to whom the is bound by  
the clofce# ties. An infra@tion of the law  
of nations, by the meanef member of any  
country, give: s the injured tate a right to  
demand tatisfaction and pumihment :—  
How much more fo, when the injury  
  
complained of is 2 fligrant violation of  
  
a faith, committed by leiding and  
  
edominant members in the ftate? Since  
eee the fatistaction we have demanded  
is not given, we mult, though moit re-  
lnctantly, do ourlelves that juftice which  
we cannot otherwife obtain: we mutt  
eonfider the States General as parties in  
the injury which they will not repair, as  
fharers in the aggreflion which they re-  
frie to punith, and mult act accordingly.  
We have therefore ordered our ambafia-  
dor to withdraw from the Hague, and  
fha!l immediately purfue fuch vigorous  
meafures as the occation fully jultifes,  
and our dignity and the effential intereits  
of our people require.  
  
From a regard to the Dutch nation at  
large, we wilh it were poflible to direct  
thofe meaiures wholly againft Ainfterdam ;  
but this cannot be, unlefs the States Ge-  
neral will immedi itely declare, that Am-  
fterdam tha!!l, upon this occafion, receive  
ne afiitiance trom them, but lett to a-  
bide the «¢ foniequences ot its 3 eereflion.  
  
Vhilft Amfterdam ig faffered to: prevail  
inthe general councils, and is bicked by  
the tlrength of the (tate, . is impotitble to  
refift the agegreffion of fo contiderable a  
part, without contending with the whole.  
But we are too fenfible of the common in-  
terefts of bot countries not to remember,  
in the midit of fuch a contef, that the  
only point to be aimed at by us, isto raile  
a difpofition inthe councils of  
lic to return to our ancient union,  
ing us that fatisfaction forthe patt, and i@-  
curity for the future, which we fhall be as  
ready to receive as they can be to offer,  
and to the attainment of which we thall  
direct ali our operations. We mean only  
to provide for our own tecur ity, by -_  
  
feating the dangerous deligne that aa

Manifefto againf? the Dutch.  
  
made to our friendthip, for fome time pat,  
has been an open contempt of the mof  
folemn engagements, and a repeated viola-  
tion of public faith,  
  
On the commencement of the defenfive  
war, in which we feund ourfelves engag-d by  
the eggreflion of France, we thewed a tender  
regard for the interefts of the States General,  
and a defire of fecuring to their {ubje&amp;ts every  
advantage of trade, confiftent with the great  
and juft principle of our own de‘ence. Our  
Ambaffador was inftruéted to offer a friendly  
negotiation, to obviate every thing that might  
lead to cifagreeable dilcuffion; and to this  
ofter, folemnly made by him to the States-  
General, the 2d of November, 1778, no at-  
tention was paid.  
  
After the number of our enemies increaf-  
ed by the aggreffion of Spain, equally unpro-  
voked with that of France, we found it ne-  
ceffary to call upon the States-General for the  
performance of their engagements. ‘The fifth  
article of the perpetual defenfive alliance be-  
tween our Crown and the Srates General, con-  
cluded at Weftminfter the 3d of March, 1678,  
befides the general engagement for fuccours,  
exprefsly ftipulates, ** ‘That the patty of the  
two allies that is not attacked, fhali be objig-  
ed to break with the agereffor in two months  
efter the party attacked thall require it:  
Yet two years have paffed, without the leaft  
aflifance given to us, without a fingie fy!la-  
ble in anfwer to our repeated demaads.  
  
So totally regardiefs have the States been of  
their treaties with us, that they readily pro-  
mifed our enemies to obferve a neutrality, in  
direct contradiction to thofe engagements ;  
and whiltt they have with-held from us the  
fuccours they were bound to furnith, every  
fecret affiftance has been given the enemy ;  
and inland duties have been taken off, for the  
fole purpofe of facilitating the carriage of  
naval fiores to France,  
  
  
  
In direct and open violation of treaty, they .  
  
futt-red an American pirate to remain feveral  
weeks in one of their ports: ‘and even per-  
mitved a part of his crew to mount guard in a  
fort in che Texel.  
  
In the Eaft-Indies, the fubje@s of the  
States General, in concert with France, have  
endeavoured to raife up enemies againft us.  
  
In the Weft-Indies, particularly at St. Eu-  
fa ius, every proteGion and affiftance bas been  
g ven to cur rebellious fubjeéts. Their pri-  
va&#x27;eers are openly received in the Dutch hare  
bours; allowed to refit there; fupplied with  
arms and ammunition ; their crews recruited ;  
their prizes brought in and fold; and all thie  
in direct violation of as clear and folemn fti-  
pulations as can be made,  
  
This conduct, fo inconfiftent with all good  
faith, fo repugnant to the fenfe of the wifett  
part of the Dutch nation, is chiefly to be af-  
criged to the prevalence of the leading Magi-  
itrates of Amfterdam, whofe fecret corref-  
poaseace with eur rebellious fubjects was fuf-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
pected, long before it was made known by  
the fortunate difcovery of a treaty, the firt  
article of which is :  
  
** There thall be a firm, invioleble and uni-  
verfal peace, and fincere friendthip, between  
their High Mightineiles the Eftates of the  
Seven United Provinces of Ho!land, and the  
United States of North America, and the fub-  
jeéts and people of the {aid parties; and between  
the Countries, Iflands, Cities, and Towns,  
fitusted under the juriféiétion of the faid  
United States of Holland, and the faid United  
States of America, and the people and inhabi-  
tants thereof, of every degiee, without excep-  
tion of perfons or places *”  
  
This Treaty was figned in September,  
17978, by the exprefs order of the Penfionary  
of Amfterdam, and other ptinctpal Magif-  
trates of that City. —They now not only avow  
the whole tranfaction, but glory in it, and  
exprefsly fay, even to the States General,  
that what they did ‘‘ was what their indif-  
penfable duty required.”  
  
In the mean time, the States General de-  
clined to give any anfwer to the Memorial  
prefented by our Ambaffudor; and this refutal  
was aggravated by their proceeding ypon other  
bufinefs, may upon the confideration of thie  
very fubdjeét to internal purpoies: and while  
they found it impoflible to approve the con-  
duct of their fubjects, they ftill indufirioufly  
avoided to give us the fatis ation fo mani-  
feftly due,  
  
We had every right to expedt, that fuch a  
difcovery would have roufed them to a juft  
indignation at the infult eficred to us, and  
to themfelves; and that they would have  
been eager to give us full and ample fatisfac-  
tion for the offence, and to infli&amp; the feve-  
ret punifhment upon the offenders, The  
urgency of the bufinefs made an inftant an-  
{wer effential to the honour and fafety of this  
country, The demand was accordingly prefied  
by eur Ambafiader in repeated conferences  
with the Miniflers, and in a fecond Memo-  
rial : it was prefled with all the earncftne(s  
which could proceed from our ancient friend-  
fhip, and the fenfe of recent injuries; and  
the anfwer now given to a Memorial on fucha  
fubjet, delivered above five weeks ego, is,  
That the States bave taken it ad referendum.—  
Such an anfwer, upon fuch an occafion, could  
only be diétated, by the fixt purpofe of hofti-  
lity meditated, and already refoived, by the  
States, induced by the offenfive Councils of

to demand fatisfaétion anc punifhment; how  
much more fo, when the injury complained  
of is a flaprant vivlation of public faith, com-  
mitted by lesding and predominant Members  
in the State! Since then the fasistaétion  
we have demanded is not given, we mutt,  
though moft reluctantly, do ourfelves that juf-  
tice which we canaot otherwife obtain: We  
mutt conlider the States General as porties in  
the injury which they will not repair, as  
fharers in:the agereffion which they retufe to  
punith, and mult act accordingly, We have  
therefore ordered our Ambailaaor to withdraw  
from the Hague, and fhalt immediately pur-  
due fuch vigerous meafures as. the occafion  
fuily juitifies, and our dignity and the effen  
tial iaicieiis of our people require. .  
From a regard to the Dutch nation at large,  
we with it were pr flible to dire thofe mea-  
fures wholly againft Amfterdam ; but this  
cannot be, unleis the Siates General will im-  
mediately declare, that Amferdam fhall, upon  
this occafion, receive no affiftaace from them,  
but be lett to: abide the confequences of its

Rtrength of the State i: is impoffible to refit

too fentible of tne common interetts of bota  
countries mot to remember, in the midit af

we ihail be as ready to receive ay they can be
