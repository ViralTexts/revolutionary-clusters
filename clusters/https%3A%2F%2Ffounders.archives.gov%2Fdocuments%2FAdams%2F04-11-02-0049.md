ed to beleive them I would recommend the reading of the History of the Revolution in Geneva. The federal cause will triumph. It would not be matter of surprize to me if Mr Jay should become more popular than he ever has been. You observe “that the passions of the people are not the most steady part of them” You recollect Sir that the same people who one day cried Hosanna to the son of David the next cried Crucify Crucify him. The President of the United States was for sometime an object too high for the shafts of calumny to be aimed at but faction has made such Giant strides that nothing is any longer sacred.  
  
An habitation giddy and unsure  
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart  
O thou fond many! with what loud applause  
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke  
Before he was what Thou would’st have him be!  
And now being trimm’d up in thy own desires  
Thou beastly feeder art so full of him  
That thou provoke’st thyself to cast him up.
