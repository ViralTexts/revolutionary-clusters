We, the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Pursuance of the Letter which you did us the Honor to write on the 3rd of April last, take the Liberty of submitting to your Consideration the following Remarks on the “Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States.”  
It would doubtless have been singular, if a System so new and untried, and which was necessarily formed more on Principles of Theory and probable Expediency, than former Experience had, in Practice, been found entirely free from Defects.  
The particular and continued Attention which our official Duties called upon us to pay to this Act, has produced Reflections, which, at the Time it was made and passed, did not, probably, occur, in their full Extent either to us or others.  
On comparing this Act with the Constitution, we perceive Deviations, which, in our Opinions, are important.  
The 1st Sect: of the 3rd Article of the Constitution declares that “the judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts, as the Congress may from Time to Time ordain and establish.”  
The 2d Sect: enumerates the Cases to which the Judicial Power shall extend. It gives to the Supreme Court original Jurisdiction in only two Cases, but, in all the others vests it with appellate Jurisdiction, and that with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.  
It has long and very universally been deemed essential to the due Administration of Justice, that some national Court or Council, should be instituted or authorized to examine the Acts of the Ordinary Tribunals, and, ultimately, to affirm or reverse their Judgments and Decrees: it being important that these Tribunals should be confined to the Limits of their respective Jurisdictions, and that they should uniformly interpret and apply the Law in the same Sense and Manner.  
The appellate Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court enables it to confine Inferior Courts to their proper Limits, to correct their involuntary Errors, and, in general, to provide that Justice be administered accurately, impartially, and uniformly.  
  
These controling Powers were unavoidably great and extensive; and of such a Nature as to render their being combined with other Judicial Powers, in the same Persons, unadvisable.  
To the natural as well as legal Incompatibility of ultimate appellate Jurisdiction, with original Jurisdiction, we ascribe the Exclusion of the Supreme Court from the latter, except in two Cases.  
Had it not been for this Exclusion, the unalterable ever binding Decisions of this important Court, would not have been secured against the Influences of those Predilections for individual Opinions, and of those Reluctances to relinquish Sentiments publicly, though, perhaps, too hastily given, which insensibly and not unfrequently infuse into the minds of the most upright Men, some Degree of Partiality for their Official and public Acts.  
Without such Exclusion no Court, possessing the last Resort of Justice, would have acquired and preserved that public Confidence which is really necessary to render the wisest Institutions useful. A celebrated Writer justly observes that “next to doing right, the great Object in the Administration of public Justice, should be to give public Satisfaction.”  
Had the Constitution permitted the Supreme Court to sit in Judgment, and finally to decide on the Acts and Errors, done and committed by it’s own Members, as Judges of inferior and subordinate Courts, much Room would have been left for men, on certain Occasions, to suspect, that an Unwillingness to be thought and found in the Wrong had produced an improper Adherence to it; or that mutual Interest had generated mutual Civilities and Tendernesses injurious to right.  
If Room had been left for such Suspicions, there would have been Reason to apprehend, that the public Confidence would diminish almost in Proportion to the Number of Cases in which the Supreme Court might affirm the Acts of any of it’s Members.  
Appeals are seldom made but in doubtful Cases, and in which there is, at least, much Appearance of Reason on both Sides: in such Cases, therefore, not only the losing Party, but others, not immediately interested, would, sometimes, be led to doubt whether the Affirmance was entirely owing to the mere Preponderance of Right.  
These, we presume, were among the Reasons which induced the Convention to confine the Supreme Court, and, consequently  
  
it’s Judges, to appellate Jurisdiction—We say, “consequently it’s Judges,” because the Reasons for the one, apply also to the other.  
We are aware of the Distinction between a Court and it’s Judges, and are far from thinking it illegal or unconstitutional, however it may be inexpedient to employ them for other Purposes, provided the latter Purposes be consistent and compatible with the former—But from this Distinction it cannot, in our Opinions, be inferred, that the Judges of the Supreme Court, may also be Judges of inferior and subordinate Courts, and be at the same Time both the Controllers and the controled.  
The Application of these Remarks is obvious. The Circuit Courts established by the Act, are Courts inferior and subordinate to the Supreme Court. They are vested with original Jurisdiction in the Cases from which the Supreme Court is excluded; and, to us, it would appear very singular, if the Constitution was capable of being so construed, as to exclude the Court, but yet admit the Judges of the Court. We, for our Parts, consider the Constitution as plainly opposed to the Appointment of the same Persons to both Offices, nor have we any Doubts of their legal Incompatibility.  
Bacon in his Abridgment says, that “Offices are said to be incompatible and inconsistent, so as to be executed by one Person, when from the multiplicity of Business in them, they cannot be executed with Care and Ability, Or when, their being Subordinate and interfering with each other, it induces a Presumption they cannot be executed with Impartiality and Honesty—and this my Lord Coke says is of that Importance, that if all Offices, civil, ecclesiastical &amp;c. were only executed each by a different Person, it would be for the Good of the Commonwealth, and Advancement of Justice, and Preferment of deserving Men—If a Forester by Patent for his Life, is made Justice in Eyre of the same Forest hac vice, the Forestership is become void; for these Offices are incompatible, because the Forester is under the Correction of the Justice in Eyre, and he cannot Judge himself. Upon a mandamus to restore one to the Place of Town Clerk; it was returned, that he was elected Mayor and sworn, and therefore, they chose another Town Clerk; and the Court were strong of Opinion that the Offices were incompatible, because of the Subordination—A  
  
Coroner made a Sheriff, ceases to be a Coroner—so a Parson made a Bishop, and a Judge of the common Pleas made a Judge of the King’s Bench, &amp;c.”  
Other Authorities on this Point might be added, but the Reasons on which they rest, seem to us to require little Elucidation or Support.  
There is in the Act another Deviation from the Constitution, which we think it incumbent on us to mention.  
The 2d Sect: of the 2d Art: of the Constitution, declares that the President “shall nominate and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States whose Appointments are not therein otherwise provided for.”  
The Constitution not having otherwise provided for the Appointment of the Judges of the Inferior Courts, we conceive that the Appointment of some of them, vizt of the Circuit Courts, by an Act of the Legislature, is a Departure from the Constitution, and an Exercise of Powers, which, constitutionally and exclusively belong to the President and Senate.  
We should proceed, Sir, to take Notice of certain Defects in the Act relative to Expediency, which we think merit the Consideration of the Congress, but, as these are doubtless among the Objects of the late Reference made by the House of Representatives to the Attorney General, we think it most proper to forbear making any Remarks on the Subject at present. We have the Honor to be, most respectfully, Sir, Your most obedient, and Most humble servants

‘Sir. We the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the  
Supreme Court of the United States, in pursuance of the  
letter which you did us the honor to write on the third of  
April last, take the liberty of subrnitting to your consideration  
the following remarks on the ‘ Act to establish the Judicial  
Courts of the United States.’ ,  
  
It would doubtless have been singular, if a system so new  
and untried, and which was necessarily formed more on prin-  
ciples of theory and probable expediency, than former ex-  
perience, had, in practice, been found entirely free from defects.  
  
The particular and continued attention which our official  
duties called upon us to pay to this act, has produced reflections,  
which at the time it was made and passed, did not, probably,  
occur in their full extent either to us or others.  
  
On comparing this act with the constitution, we perceive  
deviations which, in our opinions, are important.  
  
The first section of the third article of the constitution  
declares that ‘the judicial power of the United States shall  
be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts,  
as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.’  
  
The second section enumerates the cases to which the  
judicial power shall extend. It gives to the Supreme Court  
original jurisdiction in only two cases, but in all the others,  
vests it with appellate jurisdiction; and that with such ex-  
ceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make.  
  
It has long and very universally been deemed essential to  
the due administration of justice, that some national court or  
council should be instituted or authorized to examine the acts  
of the ordinary tribunals, and, ultimately, to affirm or reverse  
their judgments and decrees; it being important that these  
tribunals should be confined to the limits of their respective  
jurisdiction, and that they should uniformly interpret and apply  
the law in the same sense and manner.

to confine inferior courts to their proper limits, to correct their  
involuntary errors, and, in general, to provide that justice be

controlling powers were unavoidably great and extensive ; and  
of such a nature as to render their being combined with other  
judicial powers, in the same persons, unadvisable.  
  
To the natural as well as legal incompatibility of ultimate  
appellate jurisdiction, with original jurisdiction, we ascribe the  
exclusion of the Supreme Court from the latter, except in  
two cases. Had it not been for this exclusion, the unalterable,  
ever-binding decisions of this important court, would not have  
been secured against the influences of those predilections for  
individual opinions, and of those reluctances to relinquish  
sentiments publicly, though, perhaps, too hastily given, which  
insensibly and not unfrequently infuse into the minds of the  
most upright men, some degree of partiality for their official  
and public acts.  
  
Without such exclusion no court, possessing the last resort  
of justice, would have acquired and preserved that public  
confidence which is really necessary to render the wisest in-  
stitutions useful. A celebrated writer justly observes that ‘next  
to doing right, the great object in the administration of public  
justice, “should be to give public satisfaction.’  
  
Had the constitution permitted the Supreme Court to sit in  
judgment, and finally to decide on the acts and errors, done  
and committed by its own members as judges of inferior and  
subordinate courts, much room would have been left for men,  
on certain occasions, to suspect that an unwillingness to be  
thought and found in the wrong, had produced an improper  
adherence to it; or that mutual interest had generated mutual  
civilities and tendernesses injurious to right.  
  
If room had been left for such suspicions, there would have  
been reason to apprehend that the public confidence would  
diminish almost in proportion to the number of cases in which  
the Supreme Court might affirm the acts of any of its members.  
  
Appeals are seldom made but in doubtful cases, and in  
which there is, at least, much appearance of reason on both  
sides; in such cases, therefore, not only the losing party, but  
others, not immediately interested, would sometimes be led to  
doubt whether the affirmance was entirely owing to the mere  
preponderance of right.  
  
These, we presume, were among the reasons which induced  
the convention to confine the Supreme Court, and consequently  
its judges, to appellate jurisdiction. We say, ‘ consequently  
its judges,’ because the reasons for the one apply also to the  
other.

We are aware of the distinction between a court and its  
judges; and are far from thinking it illegal or unconstitutional,  
however it may be inexpedient, to employ them for other  
purposes, provided the latter purposes be consistent and com-  
patible with the former. But from this distinction it cannot,  
in our opinions, be inferred that the judges of the Supreme  
Court may also be judges of inferior and subordinate courts,  
and be at the same time both the controllers and the controlled.  
  
The application of these remarks is obvious. The Circuit  
Courts established by the act, are courts inferior and subordinate  
to the Supreme Court. They are vested with original juris-  
diction in the cases from which the Supreme Court is excluded ;  
and to us it would appear very singular, if the constitution was  
capable of being so construed as to exclude the court, but yet  
admit the judges of the court. We, for our parts, consider  
the constitution as plainly opposed to the appointment of the  
same persons to both offices, nor have we any doubts of their  
legal incompatibility.  
  
Bacon, in his Abridgment, says, that ‘offices are said to be  
incompatible and inconsistent, so as to be executed by one  
person, when from the multiplicity of business in them, they  
cannot be executed with care and ability ; or when their being  
subordinate, and interfering with each other, it induces a  
presumption they cannot be executed with impartiality and  
honesty ; and this, my Lord Coke says, is of that importance,  
that if all offices, civil and ecclesiastical, &amp;c. were only ex-  
ecuted, each by different persons, it would be for the good of  
the commonwealth and advancement of justice, and prefer-  
ment of deserving men. If a forester, by patent for his life,  
is made justice in Eyre of the same forest, hac vice, the for-  
estership is become void ; for these offices are incompatible,  
because the forester is under the correction of the justice in  
Eyre, and he cannot judge himself. Upon a mandamus to  
restore one to the place of town clerk, it was returned, that  
he was elected mayor and sworn, and therefore, they chose  
another town clerk; and the court were strong of opinion, that  
the oflices were incompatible, because of the subordination.  
A coroner made a sheriff, ceases to:be a coroner; so a parson  
made a bishop, and a judge of the Common Pleas, made a  
judge of the King’s Bench,’ &amp;c.

pointment of the judges of the inferior courts, we conceive  
that the appointment of some of them, viz. of the Circuit  
Courts, by an act of the legislature, is a departure from the  
constitution, and an exercise of powers, which, constitutionally  
and exclusively belong to the President and Senate.  
  
We should proceed, sir, to take notice of certain defects

count, and sustained the demurrer as to the second count ;  
and this presents the question, whether or not the office of  
judge of probate of a county, and the office of enrolling clerk  
of the legislature, are so incompatible and inconsistent with  
each other, as that they can not be legally and properly ex-  
ercised by the same person ?  
  
What is incompatibility, in legal contemplation ?  
  
“Offices are said to be incompatible and inconsistent so  
as not to be executed by the same person, when, from the  
multiplicity of business in them, they can not be exercised  
with care and ability.”—Bacon’s Abr., title “ Offices and  
Officers,” letter K.  
  
“And this, my Lord Coke says, is of that importance,  
that if all offices, civil, ecclesiastical, &amp;c., were only execu-  
ted, each by a different person, it would be for the good of  
the commonwealth, advancement of justice, and preferment  
of deserving men.”’—Bacon’s Abr., same title and letter.  
  
This court judicially knows the duties of a probate judge,  
and of an enrolling clerk of the legislature; and that they,  
during the session of the legislature, can not be performed  
by one and the same person. “Judges of probate must  
keep their offices at the court-house, and open for the trans-  
action of business at least on Mondays, Tuesdays and Sat-  
urdays of each week, except the 4th day of July an

appeal to a superior. The reasons which under-  
lie this almost universal rule are various, but  
aside from those which are so obvious as to re-  
quire no mention, I will refer to but one. Chief  
Justice Jay, in his letter to President Washing-  
ton, in relation to the powers and duties of the  
supreme court, then just inaugurated, used this  
language: “A celebrated writer has said that  
‘next to doi:g right, the great object in the ad-  
ministration of justice should be to give public  
satisfaction.’’’ The right of appeal secures, or  
helps to secure that end. .

private litigation, the federal courts are, o
