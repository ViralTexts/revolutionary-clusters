uence of this Country; for there cannot be a doubt of the wishes of the former (if we may judge from the conduct of its Officers) to impede any eclaircissment of ours with the Western Indians, and to embarrass our negotiations with them, any more than there is of their Traders and some others who are subject to their government, aiding and abetting them in acts of hostilities.  
How unfortunate, and how much is it to be regretted then, that whilst we are encompassed on all sides with avowed enemies and insidious friends, that internal dissentions should be harrowing and tearing our vitals. The last, to me, is the most serious—the most alarming—and the most afflicting of the two. And without more charity for the opinions and acts of one another in Governmental matters, or some more infalible criterion by which the truth of speculative opinions, before they have undergone the test of experience, are to be forejudged than has yet fallen to the lot of fallibility, I believe it will be difficult, if not impracticable, to manage the Reins of Government or to keep the parts of it together: for if, instead of laying our shoulders to the machine after measures are decided on, one pulls this way and another that, before the utility of the thing is fairly tried, it must inevitably be torn asunder—And, in my opinion the fairest prospect of happiness and prosperity that ever was presented to man, will be lost—perhaps for ever!  
My earnest wish, and my fondest hope therefore is, that instead of wounding suspicions, and irritable charges, there may be liberal allowances—mutual forbearances-and temporising yieldings on all sides. Under the exercise of these, matters will go on smoothly, and, if possible, more prosperously. Without them every thing must rub, the wheels of Government will clog—our enemies will triumph—and by throwing their weight into the disaffected Scale, may accomplish the Ruin of the goodly fabric we have been erecting

people of this country, we have seen, and his friends  
no doubt saw to, who from that day to this having  
had the control of Washington’s papers, would not  
else have suppressed the important docament which  
the President elicited in reply to Jefferson,s objec­  
tious.  
A few days before the above was written to  
Hawmilton, the following of similar import was ad­  
dressed 10 Jetferson. The omitted portion of this  
letter is on othersubjacts.  
Extracl from a letter of President Washinglon {o  
Thomus Jefferson, dated  
  
“Mt. VERNON, August 23, 1792,  
“How unfortunate, and how wmuch to be regret­

sides with avowed enemies and insidious friends, in­  
ternal dissensions should be harrowing and tearing  
our vitals, the latter, to me, is the most serious,  
the most alarming, and the most afflicting of the two;  
and, without more chaiity for the opinions and acts  
of one another in governineutal matters, or some  
more infallible criterion by which the uuath of spec­
