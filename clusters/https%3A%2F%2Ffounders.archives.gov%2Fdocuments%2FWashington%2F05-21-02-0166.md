]  
  
The House of Representatives have attended to your communication respecting the state of our Country, with all the sensibility that the contemplation of the subject, and a sense of duty can inspire.  
We are gratified by the information, that measures calculated  
  
to ensure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians, and to maintain the tranquility of the Western frontier, have been adopted; and we indulge the hope that these, by impressing the Indian Tribes with more correct conceptions of the justice, as well as power of the United States, will be attended with success.  
While we notice, with satisfaction, the steps that you have taken in pursuance of the late Treaties with several foreign Nations, the liberation of our Citizens, who were prisoners at Algiers, is a subject of peculiar felicitation. We shall cheerfully cooperate in any further measures that shall appear, on consideration, to be requisite.  
We have ever concurred with you in the most sincere and uniform disposition to preserve our neutral relations inviolate; and it is, of course, with anxiety and deep regret we hear, that any interruption of our harmony with the French Republic has occurred, for we feel with you and with our Constituents, the cordial and unabated wish to maintain a perfectly friendly understanding with that Nation. Your endeavours to fulfil that wish, and by all honorable means to preserve peace, and to restore that harmony and affection which have heretofore so happily subsisted between the French Republic and the United States, cannot fail, therefore, to interest our attention. And while we participate in the full reliance you have expressed on the patriotism, self-respect and fortitude of our Countrymen, we cherish the pleasing hope, that a mutual spirit of justice and moderation will ensure the success of your perseverance.  
The various subjects of your communication will, respectively, meet with the attention that is due to their importance.  
When we advert to the internal situation of the United States, we deem it equally natural and becoming to compare the present period with that immediately antecedent to the operation of the Government, and to contrast it with the calamities in which the state of War still involves several of the European Nations, as the reflections deduced from both tend to justify, as well as to excite, a warmer admiration of our free constitution, and to exalt our minds to a more fervent and grateful sense of piety towards Almighty God for the beneficence of his providence, by which its administration has been hitherto so remarkably distinguished.  
And while we entertain a grateful conviction that Your wise, firm and patriotic Administration has been signally conducive  
  
to the success of the present form of Government, we cannot forbear to express the deep sensations of regret with which we contemplate your intended retirement from Office.  
As no other suitable occasion may occur, we cannot suffer the present to pass without attempting to disclose some of the emotions which it cannot fail to awaken.  
The gratitude and Admiration of Your Countrymen are still drawn to the recollection of those resplendent virtues and talents which were so eminently instrumental to the atchievement of the revolution, and of which that glorious event will ever be the memorial. Your obedience to the voice of duty and Your Country, when you quitted reluctantly, a second time, the retreat you had chosen, and first accepted the Presidency, afforded a new proof of the devotedness of Your zeal in its service, and an earnest of the patriotism and success which have characterized Your administration. As the grateful confidence of the Citizens in the virtues of their chief Magistrate, has essentially contributed to that success, we persuade ourselves that the millions whom we represent, participate with us in the anxious solicitude of the present occasion.  
Yet we cannot be unmindful that your moderation and magnanimity, twice displayed by retiring from your exalted stations, afford examples no less rare and instructive to mankind, than valuable to a Republic.  
Although we are sensible that this event, of itself, completes the lustre of a character already conspicuously unrivalled by the coincidence of virtue, talents, success and public estimation; Yet we conceive we owe it to You, Sir, and still more emphatically to ourselves and to our nation, (of the language of whose hearts we presume to think ourselves, at this moment, the faithful interpreters) to express the sentiments with which it is contemplated.  
The spectacle of a free and enlightened nation offering by its Representatives the tribute of unfeigned approbation to its first Citizen, however novel and interesting it may be, derives all its lustre (a lustre which accident or enthusiasm could not bestow, and which adulation would tarnish) from the transcendant merit of which it is the voluntary testimony.  
May you long enjoy that liberty which is so dear to You, and to which Your name will ever be so dear: May Your own Virtues and a Nation’s prayers [o]btain the happiest Sunshine for the  
  
decline of Your days, and the choicest of future blessings. For our Country’s sake; for the sake of republican liberty, it is our earnest wish that Your example may be the guide of Your successors; and thus, after being the ornament and safe-guard of the present age, become the patrimony of our descendants.  
  
Signed by order, and behalf of the House,Jonathan Dayton Speaker.Attes

THE Houfe of Reprefentatives have attended to your  
communication refpecting the ftate of our country, with  
all the fenfibility that the contemplation of the fubjea,  
and a fenfe of duty can infpire.  
  
We are gratified by the information, that meafures cal-  
culated to enfure a continuance of the friendfhip of the  
Indians, and to maintain the tranquillity of the wefern  
frontier, have been adopted; and we indulge the hope  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
( 18 )  
  
that thefe, by imprefling the Indian tribes with more cor-  
rect conceptions of the juftice, as well as power of the U-  
nited States, will be attended with fuccefs.  
  
While we notice, with fatisfaction, the fteps that you  
have taken in purfuance of the late treaties with feveral  
foreign nations, the liberation of our citizens, who were  
prifoners at Algiers, is a fubject of peculiar felicitation-  
We thall cheertully co-operate in any further meafures  
that fhall appear, on confideration, to be requifite.  
  
We have ever concurred with you in the moft fincere  
and uniform difpofition to preferve our neutral relations  
inviolate, and it is, of courfe, with anxiety and deep re-  
gret we hear that any interruption of our harmony with  
the French Republic has occurred: for we feel with you  
and with our conftituents, the cordial and unabated with  
to maintain a perfectly friendly underftanding with that  
nation. Your endeavours to fulfil that with, and by all  
honourable means to preferve peace and to reftore that  
harmony anid affection which have heretofore fo happily  
fubfifted between the French Republic and the United  
States, cannot fail, therefore, to intereft our attention.  
And while we participate in the full reliance you have  
exprefled on the patriotifin, felf-refpec&amp; and fortitude of  
our countrymen, we cherith the pleafing hope, that a mu-  
tual fpirit of juftice and moderation wii! enfure the fuc-  
cefs of your perfeverance.  
  
The various fubjecis of your communication will, ref-  
pectively, meet with the attention that is due to their im-  
portance.  
  
When we advert to the internal fituation of the United  
Srates, we deem it equally natural and becoming to com-  
pare the prefent period with that immediately antecedent  
to the operation of the government, and to contraftit with  
the calamities in which the ftate of war {till involves feve-  
ral of the European nations, as the reflections deduced  
from both tend to jultify as well as to excite, a warmer  
admiration of our free conftitution, and to exalt our minds

which its adminiftration has been hitherto fo remarkably

And while we entertain a grateful conviction that your  
wife, firm and patriotic adminiftration has been fignally  
conducive to the faccefs of the prefent form of govern-  
ment, we cannot forbear to exprefs the deep fenfations of  
regret with which we contemplate your intended retire-  
ment from office.  
  
As no other fuitable occafion may occur, we cannot fuf-  
fer the prefent to pafs without attempting to difclofe fome  
of the emotions which it cannot fail to awaken.  
  
The gratitude and admiration of your countrymen are  
ftill drawn to the recollection of thofe refplendent virtues  
and talents which were fo eminently inftrumental to the  
atchievement of the revolution, and of which that glori-  
ous eveut will ever be the memorial. Your obedience to  
the voice of duty and your country, when you quitted re-  
luctantly, a fecond time, the retreat you had chofen, and  
firft accepted the prefidency, afforded a new proof of the  
devotednefs of your zeal inits fervice, and an earneft of  
the patriotifm and fuccefs which have characterized your  
adminiftration. As the grateful confidence of the citizens  
in the virtues of their chief magiftrate, has eflentially con-  
tributed to that fuccefs, we perfuade ourfelves that the  
millions whom we reprefent, participate with us in the  
anxious folicitudes of the prefent occafion.  
  
Yet we cannot be unmindful that your moderation and  
magnanimity, twice difplayed by retiring from your ex-  
alted ftations, afford examples no lefs rare and inftruétive  
to mankind, than valuable te a republic.  
  
Although we are fenfible that thisevent, of itfelf, com-  
pletes the luftre of a character already confpicuoufly unri-  
valted by the coincidence of virtue, talents, fuccefs and  
public eftimation ; yet we conceive we owe it to you, Sir,  
  
and {till more emphatically to ourfelves and to our nation,

with you and with our conſtituents, the cordial and unabated wiſh to  
maintain a 3 friendly underſtanding with that nation. Vour  
endeavours to fulfil that wiſh, and by all honourable means to pre-  
ſerve peace and to reſtore that harmony and affection which have  
  
  
United States, cannot fail, therefore, to intereſt our attention. And  
while we participate in the full reliance you have expreſſed on the  
patriotiſm, ſelf-reſpe&amp;t, and fortitude of our countrymen, we cheriſh  
the pleaſing hope, that a mutual ſpirit of juſtice and moderation will  
enſure the ſucceſs of your perſeverance.  
  
The various ſubjects of your communication will, reſpectively,  
meet with the attention that is due to their importance.  
  
When we advert to the internal ſituation of the United States, we  
deem it equally natural and becoming to compare the preſent period  
with that immediately antecedent to the operation « # the government,  
and to contraſt it with the calamities in which the ſtate of war ſtill  
involves ſeveral of the Europcan nations, as the reflections deduced  
from both tend to juſtify, as well as to excite, a warmer admira-  
tion of our free conſtitution, and to exalt our minds to a more  
fervent and grateful ſenſe of piety towards Almighty God for the  
beneficence of his providence, by which its adminiſtration has been  
hitherto ſo remarkably diſtinguiſhed,  
  
And while we entertain a 33 conviction that your wiſe, firm,  
and patriotic adminiſtration has been ſignally conducive to the ſuc-  
ceſs of the preſent form of government, we cannot forbear to expreſs  
the deep ſenſations of regret with which we contemplate your in-  
tended retirement from office,  
  
As no other ſuitable occaſion may occur, we cannot ſuffer the  
preſent to paſs without attempting to difcluſe ſ\me of the emotions  
which it cannot fail to awaken, ;  
  
The gratitude and admiration of your countrymen are ſtill drawn  
to the recollection of thoſe reſplendent virtues and talents which wert  
fo eminently inſtrumental to the atchievement of the revolution, and  
of which thar glorious event will ever be the memorial. Your obe-  
Yience to the voice of duty and your country, when you quitted re-  
luctantly, a ſecond time, the retreat you had choſen, and firft ac-  
  
cepted the Preſidency, afforded a new proof of the devotedneſs of  
  
_ 8  
  
zeal in irs ſervice, and an earneſt of the patriotiſm and ſucceſs  
which have characterized your ad 1iniſtration. As the. grateful con-  
fidence of the citizens in the virtues of their chief magiſtrate, has efſer®  
tially contributed to that ſucceſs, we perſuade ourſelves that the  
millions whom we repreſent, participate with us in the anxious ſoli-  
citudes of tbe preſent occaſion,  
  
Let we cannot be unmindful that your moderation and 2  
nimity, twice diſplayed by retiring from your exalted tations, afford  
examples no leſs rare and inſtructive to mankind, than valuable to a  
republic, |  
  
Although we are ſenſible that this event, of itſelf, completes the  
luſtre of a character already conſpicuouſly unrivalled by the coinci-  
dence of virtue, talents, ſucceſs, and public eſtimation, yet we con»  
ceive we owe it to you, Sir, and ſtill more emphatically to ourſelves  
and to our nation (of the language of whoſe hearts we preſume to  
think ourſelves at this moent the faithful interpreters) to expreſs  
the ſentiments with which jt is contemplated.  
  
The ſpectacle of a free and enlightened nation offering by its re-  
ſentatives the tribute of unfeigned approbation to its firſt citizen,  
owever novel and intereſting it may be derives all its luſtre (a luſtre  
which accident or enthuſiaſm could not beſtow, and which adulation  
would tarniſh) from the tranſcendent merit of which it is the volun-  
tary teſtimony.  
  
  
which your name will ever be ſo dear! May your own virtues ane  
a nation&#x27;s prayers obtain the happieſt ſunſhine for the decline of  
your days and the choiceſt of futufe blefſings! For our country&#x27;s  
fake, for the ſake f republican liberty, it is our earneſt with that  
your example may be the guide of your ſucceſſors; and thus, after  
being the ornament and ſafeguard of the preſent age, become the pa»  
trimony of our deſcendants.

“ pare the present periodwith that imme-  
“ diately antecedent to the operation of

“ of his Providence, by which its adminis-

“ distinguished.  
  
* And while we entertain a grateful  
“ conviction that your wise, firm, and pat-  
“ riotic administration has been signally  
“ conducive to the success of the present  
“* form of government, we cannot forbear  
“ to express the deep sensations of regret  
“ with which we contemplate your intend-  
“ ed retirement from office.  
  
“As no other suitable occasion may  
“occur, we cannot suffer the present to

“of the emotions which it cannot fail to

“ countrymen ére still drawn to the recol-  
“ lection of those resplendent virtues and  
“ talents which Were so eminently instru-  
“‘ mental to the achievement of the revo-  
“ Jution, and of which that glorious event

“‘ dience to the voice of duty and your

“‘ a second time, the retreat you had cho-  
“ sen, and first accepted the presidency,  
“ afforded a new proof of the devotedness  
‘“‘ of your zeal in its service, and an ear-  
“ nest of the patriotism and success which  
“ have characterized your administration.  
“ As the grateful confidence of the citi-  
“ zens in the virtues of their chief magis-  
* trate has essentially contributed to that  
** success, We persuade ourselves that the  
“ millions whom we represent, partici-  
* pate with as in the anxious solicitude of  
* the present occasion.”  
  
* Yet we cannot be unmindful that your  
‘* moderation and magnanimity, twice  
“ displayed by retiring from your exalted  
* stations, afford examples no less rare  
* and instructive to mankind than valua-  
“ ble to a republic.  
  
“ Although we are sensible that this  
“ event, of itself, completes the lustre of  
“ a characteralready conspicuously unri-  
“ valled by the coincidence of virtue, tal-  
** ents, success, and public estimation ;  
‘“* yet we conceive we owe it to you, sir,  
“ and still more emphatically to ourselves

“ selves, at this moment, the faithful in-  
* terpreters) to express the sentiments  
“* with which it is centemplated.  
  
“ The spectacle of a free and enlight-

“ tives the tribute of unfeigned approba-

“ thusiasm could not bestow, and which

of the President, as it was adopted:  
When wc advert to the internal situation ol  
the United States, we deem it equally natural  
and becoming to compare the present period  
with that immediately antecedent to the oper­  
ation of the government, and to contrast &#x27;it  
with the calamities in which the state of war  
involves several of the European nations, as the  
reflections deduced from both, lend to justify,  
as well as to excite, a warmer admiration  
fervent and grateful setose ui  
towards Almighty God, for the beneficence of  
his providence, by which its administration has  
been hitherto so remarkably distinguished  
And while we enter tain a grateful conv:ction,  
that your wise, firm and patriotic administra­  
tion lias been signally conducive to the success  
of the present form of government, we cannot  
forbear to express the deep sensations of regret  
with which we contemplate your intended reti­  
rement from office.  
As no other suitable occasion may occur, wc  
cannot suffer the present to pass, without at­  
tempting to disclose some of the emotions  
which it cannot fail to awaken.  
The gratitude and admiration of your coun­  
trymen are stili diawn to the recollection of  
those resplendent virtues and talents which  
were so eminently instrumental to the achieve­  
ment of the ievolution, and of which that glo­  
rious event will everbe the memorial. Your o­  
bedience to the voice and duty of your country,  
when you quitted reluctantly, a second time,  
the letreat you bad chosen, and first accepted  
the Presidency, afforded a new proof of the de­  
votedness of your zeal in its service, and an  
earnest of the patriotism and success which  
  
| na* u i/iiai di-ici la* u jwui uuiiirun&#x27; auwu, ao  
the grateful confidence of the citizens in the  
virtue, of their chi« f magistrate has essential­  
ly contributed to that success, we petsuade our­  
selves that the millions whom we represent  
I participate with us in the anxious solicitude  
j of the present occasion.  
Yet we cannot be unmindful, that your mod­  
I etation and magnanimity, twice displayed, by  
j retir« ing form your exalted stations, afford ex­  
amples no less rare and instructive to mankind,  
than valuable to a Republic.  
Although we are sensible that this event, of  
t tself completes the lustre of a character alrea­  
dy conspicuously unrivalled by the coincidence  
of virtue, talents, success and public estima­  
tion; yet we conceive we owe it to you, sir, and  
stil! more emphatically to ourselves and to our  
nation, (of the language of whose hearts we  
presume to think ourselves at this moment the  
faithful interpreters) to express the sentiments  
with which it is contemplated.  
The spectacle of a free and enlightened na­  
tion offering, by its representatives, the tribute  
of unfeigned approbation to its first citizen,  
howev er novel and interesting it may be, derives  
all its lustre (a lustre which accident or enthu­  
siasm could not bestow, and which adulation  
i would tarnish) from the transcendent merit ol  
which it is the voluntary testimony.  
May you long enjoy that liberty which is so  
dear 10 you, and to which your name will ever  
be so dear. May your own virtues and a na­  
I tion s prayers obtain the happiest sunshine for  
the decline of your days, and the choicest of fu­  
ture blessings. For our country’s sake; for the  
sake of republican liberty, it is our earnest wish  
j that your example may be the guide of your suc­  
, cessors; and thus, after being the ornament and

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
Sir: The house of representatives have attended to your com.  
muuication respecting the state of our country, with all the  
sensibility that the contemplation of the subject and a sense of  
duty can inspire.  
  
We are gratified by the information that measures calculated  
to ensure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians, and  
to maintain the tranquillity of the western frontier have been  
adopted; and we indulge the hope that these, by impressing the  
Indian tribes with more correct conceptions of the justice ag  
well as the power of the United States, will be attended with  
success.  
  
While we notice with satisfaction, the steps that you have  
taken, in pursuance of the late treaties with several foreign na-  
tions, the liberation of our citizens Who were prisoners at A}-  
giers, is a subject of peculiar felicitation, We shall cheerfully  
co-operate in any further measures that shall appear, on consi.  
deration, to be requisite.  
  
We have ever concurred with you in the most sincere and  
uniform disposition to preserve our neutral relations inviolate,  
and it is, of course, with anixiety and deep regret we hear that  
any interruption of our harmony with the French republic has  
occurred. For we feel with you and with our constituents, the  
cordial and unabated wish to maintain a perfectly friendly un-  
derstanding with that nation. Your endeavors to fulfil that  
wish, and by all honorable means to preserve peace, and to  
restore that harmony and affection which have heretofore so  
happily subsisted between the French repubiie and the United  
States, cannot fail, therefore, to interest our attention. And  
while we participate in the full reliance you have expressed on  
the patriotism, self respect, and fortitude, of our countrymen,  
we cherish the pleasing hope that a mutual spirit of justice and  
moderation will ensure the suceess of your perseverance.  
  
The various subjects of your communication will respectively  
mect with the attention that is due to their importance.  
  
When we advert to the internal situation of the United States,  
we deemed it equally natural and becoming to compare the  
present period with that immediately antecedent to the opera-  
tion of the government, and to contrast it with the calamities  
in which the state of war still involves several of the European  
nations, as the reflections deduced from both tend to justify as  
wellas to excite a warm admiration of our free constitution,  
and to exalt our minds to a more fervent and grateful sense of  
piety towards Almighty God, for the beneficence of his Provi-  
dence by which its administration has been hitherto so remark-  
ably distinguished.  
  
And while we entertaina grateful conviction, that your wise,  
firm and patriotic administration has been signally conducive  
to the success of the present form of government, we cannot  
forbear to express the deep sensation of regret, with which we  
contemplate your intended retirement from office.  
  
As no other suitable occasion may occur, we cannot suffer  
the present to pass, without attempting to disclose some of the  
emotions which it cannot fail to awaken.  
  
The gratitude and admiration of your conntrymen are still  
drawn to the recollection of those resplendent virtues and talents  
which were so eminently instrumental to the achievement of  
the revolution, and of which that glorious event will ever be  
the memorial. Your obedience to the voice of duty and your  
country, When you quitted, reluctantly, a second time, the re-  
treat you had chosen, and firataccepted the presidency, afforded  
a new proof of the devotedness of your zeal in its service, and  
an earnest of the patriotism and success which have charac-  
terised your administration. As the grateful confidence of the  
citizens in the virtues of their chief magistrate, has essentially  
contributed to that success, we persuade ourselves that the  
millions whom we represent, participate with us in the anxious  
solicitude of the present occasion.  
  
Yet, we cannot be unimindful, that yonr moderation and mag-  
nanimity, twice displayed, by retiring from your exalted sta-  
tions, afford examples no less rare and instructive to mankipd,  
than valuable to a republic.  
  
Although we are sensible that this event, of itself, completes  
the lustre of a character already conspicuously unrivalled by

its lustre, (a lustre which accident or enthusiasm could not  
bestow, and which adulation would tarni-h), from the trans-  
cendant merit of Which itis the voluntary Lesimony.  
  
May you long enjoy that liberty which is so dear to yon, and  
to which your name will ever be so dear. May your own  
virtues and a nation’s prayers obtain the happiest sunshine for  
the decline of your days, and the choicest of future blessings.  
For our country’s sake; for the sake of republican liberty, it is

successors; and thus alter being the ornament aud safeguard of

The reply of the House of Representatives ran as  
follows:  
And while we entertain a gratefal conviction that  
your wise, firm, and patriotic administration has been  
signally conducive to the success of the present form of

sensations of regret with which we contemplate your

As no other sultable occasion may occur, we cannot  
suffer the present to pass without attempting to discover  
some of the emotions which it cannot fail to awaken.  
The gratitude and admiration of your countrymen are  
still drawn to the recollection of those resplendeat vir  
tues and talents which were so eminently instrumental  
to the achievement of the revolution, and of which that  
glorious event will ever be the memorial. Your obedie­  
ence to the voice of duty and your country; when you  
quitted reluctantly a second timg the retreat you had

new proof of the devotedness of your zeal in its service,  
and an earnest of the patriotism and success which have  
characterized your administration. As the grateful

magistrate has essentiaily contributed to that success,

and magnanimity, twice displayed by retiring from  
your exalted stations, afford examples no less rare and  
instructive to mankind than valuable to a republic.  
Although we are sensible that this event, of itself,  
completes the luster of a character already conspien­  
ously unrivaled by the coincidence of virtue, talents,  
success, and public estimation; yet we conceive we owe  
it to you, Sir, and still more emphaticalty to ourselves  
and to our hation tof the language of whose hearts we  
presume to think ourselves, af this moment, the faithful  
interpreters), to express the sentiments with which it  
is contemplated.  
The spectacle of a free and enlightened nation offering  
by its representatives the tribute of unfeigned approbae­  
tion to its first citizen, however novel and interesting it  
must be, derives all its luster (a luster which accident  
or enthuslasm could not bestow, and which adulation  
would tarnish), from the transcendent merit, of which  
it is the voluntary testimony.  
May you long enjoy that liberty which is so dear to  
you, and to which your name will ever be so dear; may  
your own virtue and a nation&#x27;s prayers obtain the hap­  
blest sunshine for the decline of your days, and the  
choicest of future blessings. For our country&#x27;s sake,  
for the sake of republican liberty, it is our earnest wish  
that your example may be the gaide of your successors;  
and thus, after being the ornament and sateguard of  
the present age, become the patrimony of our descend­  
ants
