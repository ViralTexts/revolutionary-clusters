Dear Sir,  
  
I love to receive letters very well; much bet-  
ter than I love to write them. I make but a poor |  
figure at composition. My head is much to fickle.  
My thoughts are running after birds’ eggs, play and  
  
thinking and study.  
  
THE LITERARY UNION,  
  
trifles, till I get vexed with myself. Mamma has a  
troublesome task to keep me a studying. I own I  
am ashamed of myself. I have but just entered  
the third volume of Rollin’s History, but designed  
to have got half through it by this time. Iam de-  
termined this week to be more dilligent. Mr.  
Thaxter is absent at Court. I have set myself a  
stint this week, to read the third volume half out.  
If [can but keep my resolution, I may again at the  
end of the week give a better account of myself.—  
[ wish, sir, you would give me in writing, some  
instructions with regard to the use of my time, and  
advise me how to proportion my studies and play,  
and | will keep them by me, and endeavor to follow  
them.  
  
With the present determination of growing bet-  
ter, lam, dear sir, your son,  
  
Joun Quincy A’DAms.  
  
P.S. Sir—If you will be so good as to favor me  
with a blank book, I will transeribe the most re-  
markable passages I meet with in my reading,  
which will serve to fix them upon my mind
