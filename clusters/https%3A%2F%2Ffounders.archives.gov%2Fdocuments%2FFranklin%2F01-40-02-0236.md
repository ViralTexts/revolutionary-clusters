demonstration, Franklin would witness the spectacular ascension of a 12-foot-wide  
hydrogen balloon.  
  
  
Dear Sir,  
Passy, July 27. 1783.  
  
I received your very kind Letter by Dr Blagden, and esteem myself much honour’d by your  
Friendly Remembrance. I have been too much and too closely engag’d in public Affairs  
since his being here, to enjoy all the Benefit of his Conversation you were so good as  
to intend me. I hope soon to have more  
Leisure, and to spend a Part of it in those Studies that are much more agreable to me  
than political Operations.—  
I join with you most cordially in rejoicing at the Return of Peace. I hope it will be  
lasting, &amp; that Mankind will at length, as they call themselves reasonable  
Creatures, have Reason and Sense enough to settle their Differences without cutting  
Throats: For in my Opinion there never was a good War, or a bad  
Peace.— What vast Additions to  
the Conveniences and Comforts of Living might Mankind have acquired, if the Money spent  
in Wars had been employ’d in Works of public Utility. What an Extention of Agriculture  
even to the Tops of our Mountains; What Rivers render’d navigable, or join’d by Canals;  
what Bridges, Acqueducts, new Roads &amp; other public Works, Edifices &amp;  
Improvements, rendering England a compleat Paradise, might not  
have been obtain’d by spending those Millions in doing Good which in the last War have  
been spent in doing Mischief! in bringing Misery into thousands of Families, and  
destroying the Lives of so many Thousands of working People who might have perform’d the  
useful Labour.—  
I am pleas’d with the late astronomical Discoveries made by our Society. Furnish’d as  
all Europe now is with Academies of Science, with nice Instruments and the Spirit of  
Experiment, the Progress of human Knowledge will be rapid, and Discoveries made of which  
we have at present no Conception. I begin to be almost sorry I was born so soon, since I  
cannot have the Happiness of knowing what will be known 100 Years hence.—  
I wish continu’d Success to the Labours of the Royal Society, and that you may long  
adorn their Chai

ever a Good war. Never a 1id  
  
Peace  
  
The following is the letter written by the  
illustrious Dr. Franklin, alluded to by Mr.  
Long in his late speech in Congress. It was  
written to Sir Joseph Banks 1783, after the  
termination of the war of the Revolution:  
&quot;DeAr SIR:--I join with you most cordially  
in rejoicing at the return of peace. I hope it I  
will be lasting and that mankind will at  
length, as they call themselvas reasonable  
creatures, have reason and sense enough to  
settle their differences without cutting throats,  
for in my opinion there never was a good war  
or a bad peace. What vast additions to the  
conveniences and comforts of the living might  
mankind have acquired, if the money spent  
in wars had been employed on works of pub­  
lic untility! What an extension of agricul­  
ture, even to the tops of our mountains, what  
rivers rendered navigable or joined by canals;  
what bridges, acqueducts, new roads, and  
other public works, edifices, and improvements  
rendering England a complete paradise might  
have been obtained by spending those millions  
in doing good, which in the last war have been  
spent in doing mischiet, in bringings misery  
nto thousands of families, and destroying the  
lives of so many thousands of working people  
who might have performed this useful labor
