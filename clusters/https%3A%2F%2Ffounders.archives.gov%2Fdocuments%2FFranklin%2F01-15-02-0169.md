This letter was subsequently reprinted many times as a treatise on swimming. Nothing is known about the recipient, except that in 1762 Franklin acknowledged a paper from him on the transmission of sound. The present letter was either written at about the same time, or appeared out of chronological order in Experiments and Observations; for it is there sandwiched between letters from Franklin to Polly Stevenson in 1760–62. All that can be said for certain, however, is that it was written well before January, 1769, when the edition of Franklin’s work that first included it went on sale.  
  
Dear Sir,  
[Before 1769]  
I Cannot be of opinion with you that ’tis too late in life for you to learn to swim. The river near the bottom of your garden affords you a most convenient place for the purpose. And as your new employment requires your being often on the water, of which you have such a dread, I think you would do well to make the trial; nothing being so likely to remove those apprehensions as the consciousness of an ability to swim to the shore, in case of an accident, or of supporting yourself in the water till a boat could come to take you up.  
I do not know how far corks or bladders may be useful in learning to swim, having never seen much trial of them. Possibly they may be of service in supporting the body while you are learning what is called the stroke, or that manner of drawing in and striking out the hands and feet that is necessary to produce progressive motion. But you will be no swimmer till you can place some confidence in the power of the water to support you; I would therefore advise the acquiring that confidence in the first place; especially as I have known several who by a little of the practice necessary for that purpose, have insensibly acquired the stroke, taught as it were by nature.  
The practice I mean is this. Chusing a place where the water deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is up to your breast, then turn round, your face to the shore, and throw an egg into the water between you and the shore. It will sink to the bottom, and be easily seen there, as your water is clear. It must lie in water so deep as that you cannot reach it to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage yourself in undertaking to do this, reflect that your progress will be from deeper to shallower water, and that at any time you may by bringing your legs under you and standing on the bottom, raise your head far above the water. Then plunge under it with your eyes open, throwing yourself towards the egg, and endeavouring by the action of your hands and feet against the water to get forward till within reach of it. In this attempt you will find, that the water buoys you up against your inclination; that it is not so easy a thing to sink as you imagined; that you cannot, but by active force, get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water to support you, and learn to confide in that power; while your endeavours to overcome it and to reach the egg, teach you the manner of acting on the water with your feet and hands, which action is afterwards used in swimming to support your head higher above water, or to go forward through it.  
I would the more earnestly press you to the trial of this method, because, though I think I satisfyed you that your body is lighter than water, and that you might float in it a long time with your mouth free for breathing, if you would put yourself in a proper posture, and would be still and forbear struggling; yet till you have obtained this experimental confidence in the water, I cannot depend on your having the necessary presence of mind to recollect that posture and the directions I gave you relating to it. The surprize may put all out of your mind. For though we value ourselves on being reasonable knowing creatures, reason and knowledge seem on such occasions to be of little use to us; and the brutes to whom we allow scarce a glimmering of either, appear to have the advantage of us.  
I will, however, take this opportunity of repeating those particulars to you, which I mentioned in our last conversation, as by perusing them at your leisure, you may possibly imprint them so in your memory as on occasion to be of some use to you.  
1. That though the legs, arms and head, of a human body, being solid parts, are specifically something heavier than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly the upper part from its hollowness, is so much lighter than water, as that the whole of the body taken together is too light to sink wholly under water, but some part will remain above, untill the lungs become filled with water, which happens from drawing water into them instead of air, when a person in the fright attempts breathing while the mouth and nostrils are under water.  
2. That the legs and arms are specifically lighter than salt-water, and will be supported by it, so that a human body would not sink in salt-water, though the lungs were filled as above, but from the greater specific gravity of the head.  
3. That therefore a person throwing himself on his back in saltwater, and extending his arms, may easily lie so as to keep his mouth and nostrils free for breathing; and by a small motion of his hands may prevent turning, if he should perceive any tendency to it.  
4. That in fresh water, if a man throws himself on his back, near the surface, he cannot long continue in that situation but by proper action of his hands on the water. If he uses no such action, the legs and lower part of the body will gradually sink till he comes into an upright position, in which he will continue suspended, the hollow of the breast keeping the head uppermost.  
5. But if in this erect position, the head is kept upright above the shoulders, as when we stand on the ground, the immersion will, by the weight of that part of the head that is out of water, reach above the mouth and nostrils, perhaps a little above the eyes, so that a man cannot long remain suspended in water with his head in that position.  
6. The body continuing suspended as before, and upright, if the head be leaned quite back, so that the face looks upwards, all the back part of the head being then under water, and its weight consequently in a great measure supported by it, the face will remain above water quite free for breathing, will rise an inch higher every inspiration, and sink as much every expiration, but never so low as that the water may come over the mouth.  
7. If therefore a person unacquainted with swimming, and falling accidentally into the water, could have presence of mind sufficient to avoid struggling and plunging, and to let the body take this natural position, he might continue long safe from drowning till perhaps help would come. For as to the cloathes, their additional weight while immersed is very inconsiderable, the water supporting it; though when he comes out of the water, he would find them very heavy indeed.  
But, as I said before, I would not advise you or any one to depend on having this presence of mind on such an occasion, but learn fairly to swim; as I wish all men were taught to do in their youth; they would, on many occurrences, be the safer for having that skill, and on many more the happier, as freer from painful apprehensions of danger, to say nothing of the enjoyment in so delightful and wholesome an exercise. Soldiers particularly should, methinks, all be taught to swim; it might be of frequent use either in surprising an enemy, or saving themselves. And if I had now boys to educate, I should prefer those schools (other things being equal) where an opportunity was afforded for acquiring so advantageous an art, which once learnt is never forgotten. I am, Sir, &amp;c.

Cannot be of opinion with you, that  
  
it is too late in life for you to learn to  
fwim: the river, near the bottom of your  
garden, affords a moft convenient place  
tor the purpofe. And, as your new em-  
ployment requires your being often on the  
water, of which you have fuch a dread, I  
think you would do well to make the  
trial ; nothing being fo likely to remove  
thofe apprehentions, as the confcioufnefs  
of an ability to {wim to the fhore in café of  
an accident, or of fupporting yourte!lf in  
the water, till a boat could come to take  
you up.  
  
I do not know how far cerks or blad-  
ders may be ufeful in learning to fwim,  
having never feen much trial of them.  
Poflibly they may be of fervice in fupport-  
ing the body while you are learning what  
is called the ftroke, or that manner of  
drawing in and ftriking out the hands and  
feet, that is neceffary to produce progreflive  
  
motion. But you will be no fwimmer till  
  
you can place fome confidence in the power  
of the water to (upport you ; I would there-  
fore advile the acquiring that confidence in  
the firtt place, efpecially as I have known  
feyeral who, by a little of the practice ne-  
  
ceffary for that purpof, have infenfibly  
acquired the ftroke, taught as it were by  
nature.  
  
The practice I mean is this: chufing  
a place where the water deepens gradually,  
walk coolly into it till it is up to your  
breaft, then turn round, your face to the  
fhore, and throw an egg into the water  
between you and the fhore. It will fink  
to the bottom, and be eafily feen there, as  
your water is clear, Jt muft lie in water  
fo deep as that you cannot reach it to take  
it up by diving for it. To encourage  
yourlelf in order to do this, reflect that  
your progrefs will be from deeper to  
thallower water, and that at any time you  
may, by bringing your legs under you,  
and ftanding on the bottom, raife your  
head far above the water. Then plunge  
under it with your eyes open, throwing  
yourtelf towards the egg, and endeavour-  
ing, by the a¢tion of your hands and fect  
againit the water, to get forward till within  
reach of it. In this attempt you will find,  
that the water buoys you up againft your  
inclination ; that it is not fo eafy a thing  
to fink as you imagined ; that you cannot,  
but by active force, get down to the egg.  
Thus you feel the power of the water to  
  
lup-

fupport you, and learn to confide in that  
power; while your endeavours to over-  
come it, and to reach the egg, teach you  
the manner of aéting on the water with  
your feet and hands, which aétion is after-  
wards ufed in f{wimming to fupport your  
head higher above water, or to go forward  
through it.  
  
I would the more earneftly prefs you to  
the trial of this method, becaufe, thouch  
J think I fatisfied you that your body is  
lighter than water, and that you might  
float in it a long time with your mouth  
free for breathing, if you would put your-  
felf in a proper pofture, and would be itil!  
and forbear itruggling, yet, till you have  
obtained this experimental confidence in  
the water, I cannot depend on your ha-  
ving the neceflary prefence of mind to re-  
colleé&amp; that pofture and the dire&amp;tions I  
gave you relating toit. The iurprife may  
put all out of your mind. For, though  
we value ourfelves on being reafonable  
knowing creatures, reafon and knowledge  
feem, on fuch occafions, to be of little ule  
to us ; and the brutes, to whom we allow  
{carce a glimmering of either, appear to  
have the advantage of us.  
  
I will, however, take this opportunity  
of repeating thofe particulars to you, which  
I mentioned in our lait converfation, as, by  
perufing them at your leifure, you may  
poflibly imprint them fo in your memory  
as on occafion to be of fome ufé to you.  
  
Firtt, That, though the legs, arms, and  
head, ofa human body, being folid parts,  
are {pecifically fomething heavier than fre/h  
water, yet the trunk, particularly the up-  
  
er part, from its hollownels, is fo much  
Fichter than water, as that the whole of  
the body, taken together, is too light to  
fink wholly under water, but fome part  
will remain above, until the lungs become  
filled with water; which happens from  
drawing water into them inftead of air,  
when a perfon in the fright attempts  
breathing, while the mouth and noftrils  
are under water.  
  
2dly, ‘That the legs and arms are fpe-  
cifically lighter than falt-water, and will  
be fupported by it ; fo that a human body  
would not fink in falt-water, though the  
lungs were filled as above, but from the  
greater fpecific gravity of the head.  
  
3dly, That therefore a perfon throwing  
himfelf on his back in falt-water, and ex-  
tending his arms, may eafily lie fo as to  
keep his mouth and noftrils free for breath-  
ing ; and, by a fmall motion of his hands,  
may prevent turning, if he should perceive  
any tendency to it.  
  
qthly, That, in freth water, if a man  
  
throws himflf on his back, near the fiw-  
face, he cannot long continue in that fitua-  
tion, but by a proper a¢tion of his hands  
on the water. If he ufes no {uch action,  
the legs and lower part of the body will  
gradually fink till he comes into an upright  
pofition, in which he will continue fui-  
pended, the hollow of the breatt keeping  
the head upperimoft.  
  
gthly, But, if in this ere&amp;t pofition the  
head is kept upright above the fhoulders,  
as when we ftand on the ground, the im-  
merfion will, by the weight of that part  
of the head that is out of water, reach  
above the mouth and noftrils, perhaps a lit~  
tle above the eyes, fo that a man cannot  
long rem2in fufpended in water with his  
head in that poiition.  
  
6thly, The body continuing fulbended  
as before, and upright, if the head be  
leaned quite back, fo that the face iooks  
upwards, all the back part of the head  
being then under water, and its weight  
conicquently in a great meaiure fupported  
by it, the face will remain above water  
quite free for breathing, will rife an inch  
higher every infpiration, and fink as much  
every expiration, but never fo low as that  
the water may come over the mouth.  
  
7thly, If therefore a perfon unacquainted  
with {wimming, and falling accidentally  
into the water, could have prefence of  
mind fufficient to. avoid ftrugcling and  
plunging, and to let the body take this  
natural poiition, he might continue long  
fafe from drowning, till perhaps help  
would come. For, as to the cloaths, their  
additional weight while immerfed is very  
  
inconixierable, the water fupporting it ;  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
thouch, when he comes out of the water,  
he would find them very heavy indeed.  
But, as I faid before, T would not ad-  
vifé you or any one to depend on hawing  
this prefence of mind on fuch an occafi  
but learn fairly to fwim, as 1 wifl  
men were taught to do in their youth  
they would, on many occurrences, be the  
fafer for haying that fkill, and on many  
more the happier, as freer from paintul  
apprehentions of danger, to fy nothing of  
the enjoyment in fo delightful and whole-  
fome an exercife. Soldiers particularly  
fhould, methinks, all be taught to iwim

prifing an enemy, or faving themfclves.

Ufeful Hints for learning to fwim. By  
Benjamin Franklin, BL. D. F. RS.  
_ dna Letter 10 a Friend.  
Dear Sir, *  
I Cannot be of opinion with you, that  
it is too late in life for you to learn  
te {wim ;. the river near the bottonr of  
  
  
  
Ufeful Hinis for learaitig to fim.  
  
your garden, affords a moft convenicné  
place for the purpofe. And, as yout  
new employment requires or being  
often on the water, of which you have  
fuch a dread, I think you would do  
well to make the trial ; nothing being:  
fo likely to remove thofe apprehen-  
fions, as the confcioufnefs of an abili-  
ty to fwim to the fhore in cafe of an  
accident, or of fupporting yourfelf in  
the water till a boat could come to  
take you up.  
  
I do not know how far corks or  
bladders may be ufeful in learning to  
fwim, having never feen much trial of  
them. Poffibly they may be of fer-  
vice in fupporting the body while you’  
are learning what is called the ftroke,  
or that manner of drawing in and  
ftriking out the hands and feet that  
is neceflary to produce progreflive  
motion. But you will be no fwim~  
mer till you can place fome confidence  
in the power of the water to fupport  
you ; I would therefore advice the ac-  
quiring that confidence in the firft  
place, efpecially as I have known fe-  
veral who, by a little of the praétice  
neceflary for that purpofe, have infen-  
fibly acquired the ftroke, taught as it  
were by nature. -  
  
The practice I mean is this : chufing  
a place where the water deepens gra-  
dually, walk coolly into it till it is up’  
to your-breaft, then turn round your  
face to the fhore, and throw an egg in-  
to the water, between you and the  
fhore ; it will fink to the bottom, and  
be eafily feen there, as your water is  
clear. It muft lie in the water fo deep  
as that yeu cannot reach it to fake it  
up but by diving for it To encourage  
yourfelf in order to do this, reflect that  
your progrefs will be from deeper té  
fhallower water, and that at any time  
you may, by bringing your legs under  
you, and ftanding on the bottom, raife  
your head far above the water. Then  
plunge under it with your eyes oper,  
throwing yourfelf towards the egg,  
and endeavouring, by the aétion of  
your hands and feet againft the water,  
to get forward till within reach of it.:  
In this attempt you will find that the  
water buoys you up againft your incli-  
nation ; that it is not fo eafy a thing  
to fink as you imagined ; that you can-  
not, but by aétive force, get down ‘to  
the egg. Thus you feel the power of  
  
the water to fupport you, and learn to  
confide in that power ;- while your en-  
deavours to overcome it, and to reach  
the egg, teach you-the-manner of

I would the more earneftly prefs you  
to the trial of this ated, becaufe,  
though I think I fatisfied you that  
your body is lighter than water, and  
that you might float in it along time  
with your mouth free for breathing,  
if you would put yourfelf in a proper  
  
ofture, and would be ftill, and for-  
Seer ftruggling, yet, till you have ob-  
tained this experimental confidence in  
the water, I cannot depend on your  
having the neceffary prefence of mind  
to recolle&amp; that poftuy‘e, and the direc-  
tions I gave you relating to it. The  
furprife,may put-all out of your mind.  
For, though we value ourfelves on be-  
ing reafonable knowing creatures, rea-  
fon and knowledge feem, on fuch oc-  
cafions, to be of little ufe to us: and  
the brutes, to whom we allow f{carce  
a glimmering of either, appear to have  
the advantage of us.  
  
I will, however, take this opportu-  
nity of repeating thofe particulars to  
you, which I mentioned in our laft  
converfation, as, by perufing them at  
your leifure, you may poffibly imprint  
them fo in your memory, as on occa-  
fion to be of fome ufe to you.  
  
Firft, that, though the legs, arms,  
and head of a human body, being fo-  
lid parts, are {pecifically fomewhat hea-  
vier than frefh water, yet the trunk,  
enone the upper part, from its  
  
ollownefs, is fo much lighter than  
water, as that the whole of the body,  
taken together, is too light to fink  
wholly under water, but fome part  
will remain above, until the lungs be-  
come filled with water; which hap-  
pens from drawing water into them  
inftead of air, when a perfon, in the  
fright, attempts breathing, while the  
mouth and nottrils are under’ water.  
  
adly, That the legs and arms are  
  
fpecifically lighter than falt-water, and  
will be fupported by it; fo that a hu-  
man body would not fink in falt-wa-  
ter, though the lungs were filled as  
above, but from the greater fpecific  
gravity of the head. ©  
  
3diy, That therefore a perfon throw-  
ing himfelf on his back in falt water,  
  
and extending his arms, may eafily lie «  
  
fo as to keep his mouth and noftrils  
free for breathing; and, by a {mall  
motion of his hands, may prevent turn-  
ing, if he fhould perceive any tenden-  
cy to it,  
  
, *  
  
475  
  
4thly, That, in frefh water, if a  
man throws himfelf on his back, near  
the furface, he cannot long. continue  
in that fituation, but by a proper ac-  
tion of his hands on the water. If he  
ufes no fuch aétion, the legs and lower  
part of the body will gradually fink  
till he comes into an upright pofition,  
in which he will continue fufpended,  
the hollow of the breaft keeping the  
head uppermoft.  
  
sthiy, But. if in this ere&amp; pofition  
the head is kept upright above the  
fhoulders, as when we ftand on the  
ground, the immerfion will, by the  
weight of that part of the head that  
is out of water, reach above the mouth  
and-noftrils, perhaps a little above the  
eyes, fo that a man cannot long re-  
main fufpended in water with his head  
in that pofition.  
  
6thly, The body continued fufpend-  
ed as before, and upright, if the head  
be leaned quite back, fo that the face  
looks upwards, all the back part of  
the head, being then under water, and  
its weight confequently in a great mea-  
fure fupported by it, the face will re-  
main above water quite free for breath-  
ing, will rife an inch higher every in-  
fpiration, and fink as much every ex-  
piration, but never fo low as that the  
water may come over the mouth.  
  
gthly, If therefore a perfon, unac-  
quainted with {wimming, and falling  
accidentally into the water, could have  
prefence of mind fufficient to avoid  
ftruggling and plunging, and to let  
the body take this natural pofition, he  
might continu? long fafe from drown-  
ing, till perhaps help would come.  
For, as to the cloaths, their additional  
weight, while immerfed, is very in-  
confiderable, the water fupporting it;  
ans when he comes out of the wa-  
ter, he would find them very heavy  
indeed.  
  
But, as I faid before, I would not  
advife you or any one to depend on

learn to fwim : the river, near the bot¬  
tom of your garden, afibrds a moll con¬  
venient place for the purpofe. And, as  
your new employment requires your  
being often on tlie water, of which you  
have fuch a dreail, I think you would do  
well to make the trial; nothing being fo  
likely to remove thofe apprehenfions, as  
tlie eonfcioufiiefs of an aliility to fwim to  
the Ihore in cafe of an accident, or of  
fupp(*riing yourfcif in the water till a  
boat could come to take you up.  
  
1 do not know how far corks or blad¬  
ders may be ufeful in learning to fwim,  
having never feen much trial of them.  
Poflibiy they may i*e of fervice in fnp-  
portlng the body wliile you are learning  
wliat is called tbey?/Y^^r, or that manner  
of drawing in and ftriking out the hands

progrefiive motion. But you will he no

denee in the power of the water to fiq^-

acqr.iring that confidence in the firft  
place, efpeciully as 1 have known feveral  
who, by a litth.* of the praii^liee neeeftary  
for that purpofe, have infenfibiy acquired  
the i&#x27;lroke, taught as it were by nature.  
  
The practice I mean is this : ehiifing  
a place wiiere the water deepens gradual¬  
ly, w .dk coolly into it till it is up to  
yonr bi eaft ; then turn round your face  
to the fiioie, and throw an egg into the  
water between you and the Ihore. It  
v&#x27;ill fink to the bottom, and be ealily feen  
there, as your water is clear. It muft  
lie in the water fo deep as that you can¬  
not reach it to take it up by diving for it.  
To encourage yourfelf in order to this,  
relleil that yonr progixfs will lie from  
deeper to (hallowc r water, and that at  
any time you may, by bringing your legs  
uiiiii r you, and Handing on the bottom^  
raife yonr bead far above the water.  
&#x27;J&#x27;hen plunge under it with your eyes  
ojK*n, throwing yonrfelftowards the egg,  
and endeavouring, by the actions of your  
hands aiiil feet againft the water, to get  
forward till within reach of it. In this  
attempt you will find, that the water  
bn&lt;»ys np againft your inciinatioji ; that  
it is not fo eafy a thing to link as you  
imagiiKil ; that you cann«)l, but by ac¬  
tive force; get down to the egg. Thuf  
you feel the power of tlic water to f&#x27;lp-  
port you, and learn to confiilc in that  
power; wliilc your endeavours to over¬  
come it, and to reach the egg, teach you the

*¢ IT CANNOT be of opinion with  
you, that it as too late in life for you  
to learn to fwim,; the river near the  
bottom of your garden affords a mof  
convenient place for the purpofe, and  
as your new employment requires your  
being often on.the water, of which you  
have fuch a dread, I think you would

as the confcioufnefs of an ability to  
fwim ~to the fhore in cafe of an acci-  
dent, or of fupporting yourfelf in the  
water till:a boat could come to take  
you up.  
  
I do not know how far corks or  
bladders may be ufeful in learning to  
fwim, having never feen much trial of  
them; poflibly they may be of fervice  
in fupporting the body while you are  
learning what is called the ftroke, or  
that manner of drawing in and ftrik-  
ing out the hands and feet that is ne-  
ceflary to produce progreflive motion 3  
but you will be no f{wimmer till you can  
place fome confidence in the power of  
the water to fupport -you: I would,  
therefore, advife the acquiring that con-  
fidence in the firft .place, efpecially as  
I have known feveral who, by a little  
ef the ife-neceffary for that pur-  
pote, ‘fave infenfibly «acquired the  
  
ke; taught as.it were by nature.  
The praétice I mean is this; choofing  
a place where the water deepens yra-  
dually, walk coolly into it till it is up  
to your breaft, then turn round your  
face to the fhore, and throw an egg  
into the water between you and the  
fhore; it will fink to the bottom, and  
be eafily feen there, as your water is  
clear.’ Itmuft lie in the water fo deep,  
that you cannot reach it to take it up  
without diving for it. In order to en-  
courage yourtelf to do this, reflect that  
  
| your progrefs will be from deeper to  
  
thallower water, and that at any time  
you may, by bringing your legs under  
you, and ftanding on the bottom, raife  
your head far above water ; then plunge  
under it with your eyes open, throwing  
yourfelf towards the egg, und endea-  
vouring, «by the ation. of your hands  
and feet-againt the water, to get for-  
ward till within reach of it: im this  
attempt you will find® that the water:  
buoys you up againft your inclination ;  
that it is not fo eafy a thing to fink as  
you imagined, and that you cannot;  
without aétive force, get down to the  
egg. Thus you feel the power of the  
water to fupport you, and learn to  
confide in that power, while your en-  
  
vours to Overcome ‘it, and reach  
  
me the ege, teach you the manner of acting  
  
on the water with your feet and hands,  
which agtion is afterwards ufedin fwim-  
ming to {upport your head above wa-  
ter, or to go forward through it. I  
  
  
  
would ‘the more earneftly preis you to  
  
  
  
LEARNING TO SWIM. 19  
  
the trial of this method, becaufe,  
though I think I fatisfied you that your  
body is lighter than water, and that  
you might float in it a long time with  
your mouth free for breathing, if you  
would put yourfelf in a proper pefture,  
and would be ftill and forbear ftrug-  
gling, yet, till you have obtained this  
experimental confidence in the water, .I  
cannot depend on your having the ne-~  
ceflary prefence of mind to recolicé  
that scthuns) and the direétions I gave  
you relating to it. The furprife ma  
put all out of your mind; for, thoug  
we value curfelves as being reafonable,  
knowing creatures, reafon and know-  
ledge feem, on fuch occafions, to be of  
little ufe.to us; and the brutes, to  
whom we allow fcarce a glimmering of  
either, appear to have the advantage  
of us.  
  
I, therefore, take this opportunity  
of repeating thofe particulars to’ you,  
which I mentioned in-our laft converfa+  
tion, as by perufing them at your lei  
fure you may poffibly imprint them fo  
on your memory, as on occafion to be  
of ufe to you.  
  
Firft, that though the legs, arms,  
and head of a human body, being folid  
parts, are {pecifically fomewhat. hea-  
vier than frefh water, yet the trunk,  
particularly the upper part, from its—  
hollownefs, is fo much lighter than  
water, as that the whole of the body  
taken together is too light to fink  
wholly under water, but fomeé part will”  
remain above, until the lungs become  
filed with water, which happens from  
drawing water into them inftead of airy ©  
when a perfon in the fright attempts  
breathing while the mouth and noftrils  
are under water.  
  
Secondly, that the legs and ‘arms  
are {pecifically lighter than falt- water,  
and will be fupported by it, fo that a  
human bedy would not fink in fale  
water, though the lungs were filled as  
above, but, from the greater fpecifick  
gravity of the head.  
  
Thirdly, that, therefore, a perfon  
throwing himfelf on his back im fale  
water, and extending his arms, may  
eafily lie fo as to keep his mouth and  
noftrils free for breathing, and, by a  
fmall motion of his hands, may pre-  
vent finking, if ‘he thould perceive any  
tendency to it. | nat  
  
Fourthly, that ‘in frefh water, if  
a man throws himfelf on his back, near.

20 ON COCK-FIGATING.  
  
the furfaces he cannet long continue in  
that fituation, but by a proper aétion  
of his hands on the water. If he ufes  
no fuch ation, the legs and lower part  
of the body will gradually fink, til! he  
comes into an upright pofition, m which  
he will continue fufpended, the hollow  
of the breait keeping the head upper-  
molt.  
  
Fifthly, but if in this ereét pofition  
the head is kept upright above the  
fhoulders, as when we ftand on the  
ground, the immertion will, by the  
weight of that part of the head that is  
out of water, reach above the mouth  
and noftrils, perhaps a little above the  
eyes, fo that a man cannot long re-  
main fufpended in water with his, head  
in that pofition.  
  
Sixthly, the body continued fuf-  
oat as before, and upright, if the  
  
ead be leaned quite back, fo that the  
face look oc all the back part of  
the head being then under water, and its  
weight confequently in a great meafure  
fupported by it, the face will remain  
above water quite free for breathing,  
will rife an inch higher every infpira-  
  
sion, and fink as much every expira- -  
  
tion, but ‘never fo low as that the water  
can come over the mouth.  
  
Seventhly, if, therefore, a perfon  
wnacquainted with {wimming, and  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Jan.  
  
falling accidentally into the water,  
could ee ee — fufficient  
to avoi ing and plunging, and  
to let the os shis natin “ae -  
tion, he might continue long fafe trom  
drowning, perhaps till help could come;  
for as to the clothes, their additional  
weight, while immerfed, is very incon-  
fiderable, the water fupporting it;  
though when he comes out of the wa-  
ter he would find them very heavy  
indeed,  
  
But, as I faid beforé, I would not  
advife you, or any one, to depend on  
having this prefence of mind on fuch  
an occafion, but learn fairly to fwim,  
as I with all men were taught to do in  
their youth; they would on many oc:  
currences be the fafer for having that  
kill, and on many more the happier,  
as being freer from painful apprehen-  
fions of danger, to fay nothing of the  
enjoyment in fo delightful and whole-  
fome an exercife. Soldiers particularly  
fhouild all be taught to fwim, it might  
be of frequent ule either in furpriling  
an enemy, or faving themfelves ; and if  
I had boys to educate I fhould prefer  
thofe {chools, other things being equal,  
where an opportnnity is afforded for ac-  
quiring fuch an advantageous art, which  
once learnt is never forgotten.”

Ujelul Ents for learning to Swim. By Ben-  
jamin Franklin, LL.D. FLR.S. In  
a Letter to a Friend.  
  
Dear Sir,  
Cannot be of opinion with you, that it  
1s too late in life for you to learn to  
  
{wim ; the river near the bottom of your  
  
garden, affords a moft convenient place  
  
for the purpofe. And, as your new em-  
ployment requires your being often on the  
  
water, of which you have fuch a dread, I  
  
think you would do well to make the  
  
trial; nothing being fo likely to remcve  
  
an inflamma ion was begun, | thofe apprehenfions, as the con{ciouf-  
tis wound was{ nels of an ability to fwim to the thore  
in cafe of an accident, or of fupporting  
  
your-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
felf in the water till a boat could  
to take you up.  
OTe serkiow sa far corks or blad-  
ders may be ufeful in learning to fwim,  
having never feen much trial of them.  
Poflibly they may be of fervice in fup-  
rting the body while you are learn-  
jng what js called the ttroke, or that  
manner of drawing in and ftrrking out  
the hands and feet that is neceffary to  
produce progreflive motion. But you  
will be no {wimmer tli you can place  
fome confidence in the power of the  
water to fupport you; I would there-  
fore advife the acquiring that confidence  
in the firit place, efpecialty as 1 have  
known feveral who, by a little of the  
raftice neceffary for that purpofe, have  
infenfibly acquired the ttroke, taught as  
it were by nature.  
The practice I mean is this: chufing  
a place where the water deepens gra-  
dually, walk coolly into it till it is up  
to your breaft, then turn round your  
face to the fhore, and throw an egg in-  
to the water, between you and the fhore ;  
it will fink to the bottom, and be ealily  
feen there, as your water is clear. It  
mult lie in the water fo deep as that you  
cannot reach it to take it up but by diving  
for it. To encourage yourlelf in order  
to do this, reflect that your progrefs  
will be from deeper to fhallower wa-  
ter, and that at any time you may, by  
bringing your legs-under you, and ttand  
ing on the bottom, raife your head far  
above the water.  
jt with your eyes open, throwing your-  
felf towards the egg, and endeavourmng,  
by the action of your hands and feet  
again the water, to get forward till  
withio reach of it. In this attempt you  
will find that the water buoys you up  
againit your inclination ; that it is not  
fo caly a thing to fink as you imagin-  
ed; that you canuot, but by aétive  
force, get down tothe ege. Thus you  
feel the power of the water to fupport  
you, and learn to confide in that power ;  
while your endeavours to overcome it,  
and to reach theegg, teacl) you the manner  
of aéting on the water with your feet and  
hands, which aétion is afierwards uled in  
{wunming to fupport your head higher  
above water, or to go forward through it.  
I would the more earneftly prefs you  
to the trial of this method, becaufe,  
though I think I fatisfied you that your  
body-is lighter than water, and that you  
might float ia it a long time with your  
mouth free for breathing, if you would

put yourfelf in a proper pofture, and  
would be fill, and forbear ftruggling,  
yet, ull you have obtained this exper.  
mental confidence in the water, IT cannot  
depend on your having the neceflary pre-  
fence of mind to recotle&amp; that pofture,  
and the direétions I gave you relating to  
it. The furprife may put al! our of your  
mind. For, though we value ourfelves  
on being reafonable knowing creatures,  
reafon and Knowledge feem, on fach oc-  
cations, to be of littie ufe to us: and the  
brutes, to whom we allow fcarce a glim-  
mering of either, appear to have the ad-  
vantage oF us.  
  
I will, however, take this opportunity  
of repeating thofe particulars to you,  
which I mentioned in our Jalt converfa-  
tion, as, by peruiing tem at your ler-  
  
) fuse, you may pollibly imprint them fo  
  
im your memory, as on occafion to be of  
fome ufe to you.  
  
Firlt, thar, though the legs, arms, and  
head of a human body, being folid parts,  
are ipecifically fomewhat heavier than  
trefla water, yet the trunk, particularly  
the upper part, frou its hollownels, is fo  
much fighter than water, as that the  
whote of the body, taken together, is too  
light to fink wholly under water, but  
fome part will remain above, until the  
lungs become filled with water; which  
happens from drawing water into them  
initead of air, when a perfon in the fright,  
attempts breathing, while the mouth and  
  
| noftrils are under water.  
  
Then plunge under |  
  
  
  
adly, That the legs and arms are fpe-  
cifically lichter than falt-water, and will  
be fupported by it ; fo thar a human bo-  
dy would not fink in falt-water, though  
the lungs were filled as above, but from  
the greater fpecific gravity of the head.  
3dly, That therefore a perfon throw-  
ing himfelf on his back in fale water,  
and extending his arms, may eafily lic  
fo as to keep his mouth and nottrils free  
for breathing; and, by a [mall motion  
of his hands, may prevent turning, if he  
fhoutd perceive any tendency to it.  
4&#x27;hly, That, in frefh water, if a man  
throws him‘elf on his back, near the fur-  
face, he cannot long continue in that fi-  
tuation, hut by a proper aétion of his  
hands on the water. If he yfes no fuch  
aétiop, the legs and lower part of the  
body will gradually fink til he comes  
into an upright pofition, in which he will  
continue fulpended, the hollow of the  
brealt keeping the head uppermott,  
~ sthly, But if in this ereét pofition the  
head 1s kept vpright above the fhoulders,

as when we fland on the ground, the im-  
merfion will, by the we ght of that part  
of the head that is out of water, reach  
above the mouth and noffrils, perhaps a  
litle above the eyes, fo that a man can-  
not Jong remain fulpended in water with  
his head in that polition.  
  
éthly, The body continued fufpended  
as before, and upright, if the head be  
lemned quite back, fo that the face looks  
upwards, all the back part of the head  
being then wnder water, and its weight  
confequently in a great meafure fupport-  
ed by it, the face will remain above wa-  
ter quite free for breathing, will rife an  
inch higher every igipivation, and fink as  
much every expiration, but never fo low  
  
as that the waters may come over the,

Cannot be of opinion with yon, that  
it is too late in life for you to learn  
to fwim. The river near the bottom of  
your i:arilen afibials a molt convenient  
j.laee fi)r tlie piirpofe. Ami as your  
new employment requires vourbein,.^ of¬  
ten on tlie water, of which you have  
fiich a ilread, I think you wciilil do well  
to make the trial ; nothin^; bcin;^&#x27; fo  
likely to remove thofe apprehenhons, as  
theconleiouihefs of an ability U) fwim to  
the Ihore in cafe of an accident, or of  
fupportin;.^ yoiirfelf in the water till a  
could come to take you up.  
  
I do not know how far corks or blad-  
_ ders may be nil fill In learning to I wim,  
  
1 having never feen much trial of tiiern.  
ikiPfihly they may be of fervice in fup-

wi&#x27;.at is called the itroke, or that man¬  
ner of tliawing in .ami llriking out the  
iiaiulo and feet that is neccllary to pro-  
&lt;lnee progrclilvc motion, ilnt you will  
le no fwimmer till you can ()lace fomc  
cunfi lciice in the power of the water to  
flipport you ; I would therefore advife  
tlie aetj iii ing that confidence in the firlt  
place; efiHcially as I have known feve-  
i.ii, Nvlio, by a little of the pradfice ne-  
cclfary for that purpofe, have infcnlibly  
.ac.inired the Itroke, taught as it were by  
nature.  
  
&#x27;File practice I mean is this : Chufing  
^ a place where the water deepens gradii-  
I ully, ‘valk coolly into it til! itisiiji to your  
I h’ead ; then turn round yonr face* to the  
I Ihure, ami throw .an egg into the water,  
betwfcii you and the fliorc : it will link  
to the bottom, and be cafily fecn there,  
yoiir water is clear. It mult lie in the  
water fo deep as that yon cannot reach  
it to take it up but by diving for it. To  
encourage yourfelf in order todothis, rc-  
Jlect that your progrefs will be from  
deeper to fiiallower water; and that at  
3ny time you may, by bringing your legs  
unde*; y ju, and. iHnding on the bottom,  
ra.fe your licad /ar above the water,  
i hen plunge under it W’ith your eyes o-  
ptn, throwing yourfcU* towards the egg,  
•and endeavouring, by the adfiun of your  
hands ami feet agair.ft the water, to get  
f^rw tnl till within reach of it. In this  
j^ticngit you will find, th.it the waiter  
a yuu up againft your inclination ;  
F’.al it ij fy  
  
you imagined; that you cannot, but by  
aiflivc force, get dow n to the egg. Thua  
you feel tfie power of the water to fup-  
port you, and leani to confide in that  
power; while your endeavours tii over¬  
come it, and to reach the egg, teach you  
t!.c manner of acting on the water with  
yoiir feet ami liand.;, wliich action is af¬  
terwards nfeil in fwimming to fupport  
your lie-ul higher above water, or to go  
forwarii throu gh it.  
  
1 w&#x27;ould the more carneflly prcl&#x27;s you  
to the trial of this method, becaufe, tho’  
  
1 think 1 fatlsliril you tliat your body is  
lighter than water, ami that you iniglit  
llo.it ill it a long lime with yn&#x27;ur mouth  
free for breatliing, if you would put  
yourfelf iu a jntiper polture, ami would  
be Hill, ami fnrtiear rtruggling; yet, till  
you h ive obtained tliis experimental con¬  
fidence in tlie water, i cannot depeml on  
your liaving the m celfary prefence of

&lt;lirc*&#x27;tions I g ive you relating to it. &#x27;Fho  
fiirprifo may put all out of your miml.  
For though w&#x27;e value ourfelves on be¬

For the WESTMINSTER MAGAZINE.  
USEFUL HINTS FOR LEARNING TO SWIM.  
By Benjamin Frawnku1n, LL.D.  
  
Dear Frienp,  
] CANNOT be of opifiion with you, that it  
1s too late in life for you te learn to fwim;  
the river near the bottom of your garden, af-  
fords a moft convenient place for the purpofe.  
And, as your new employment requ:res your  
being of en on the water, of which you have  
fuch a dread, I think you would do well to  
male the trial; nothing being fo likely to re-  
Move thofe apprehenfions, as the confcioufness  
of an ability te fwim to the fhore in cafe of  
an accident, or of fupporting yourfelf in the  
water ‘ill a boat could come to take you up.  
1 donot know how far corks or bladders  
mey be ufciul in learning wo fwim, having  
  
  
  
F.R.S. InaLettertoa Frixnp,  
  
never feen much trial of them. Poffibly  
they may be of fervice in fupporting the body  
while you are learning what is called the  
ftroke, or that manner of drawing in and ftrik-  
ing out the hands and feet that is nece@ary  
to produce progreflive motion, But you will  
be no fwimmer till you can place fome confi-  
dence in the power of the water to fupport  
you; 1 would therefore advife the acquiring  
that confidence in the firft place, efpecially as  
{ have ksown feveral who, by a little of the  
practice neceflary for that purpofe, have infen-  
frbly acquired the fireke, taught as it were by,  
Nature,

place where the water deepens gradually, walk  
coolly into it till it is up to your breaft, then  
turn round your face to the fhore, and throw  
an egg into the water, between you and the  
thore ; it will fink to the bottom, and be eafily  
feen there, as your water is clear. It muft lie  
in the water fo deep as that you cannot reach it  
to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage  
yourfelf in order to do this, refiect that your  
progrefs will be from deeper to fhallower water,  
and that at any time you may by bringing your  
legs under you, and fianding on the bottom,  
raife your head far above the water, Then  
plunge under it with your eyes open, throwing  
yourfelf towards the egg, and endeavouring, by  
the aétion of your hands and feet againft the  
water, to get forward till within the reach of  
it. In this attempt you will find that the wa-  
ter buoys you up again your inclination ;  
that it is not fo eafy athing to fink as you  
imagined ; that you cannot, but by active force,  
get down totheegg. Thus you feel the power  
of the water to fupport you, and learn to con-  
fide in that power 3 while your endeavours to  
overcome it, and to reach the egg, teach you  
the manner of acting on the waier with your  
feet and hands, which action is afterwards ufed  
in {wimming to furport your head higher above  
the water, or to go forward through it.  
  
I would the more earneftly prefs you to the  
trial of this method, becaufe, though I think I  
fatisfied you that your body is lighter than wae  
ter, and that you might float in it a long time  
with your mouth free for breathing, if you would  
put yourfelf in a proper pofture, and would be  
ftill, and forbear ftruggling, yet. till you have  
obtained this experimental confidence in the  
water, I cannotdepend on your having the necef-  
fary prefence of mind to recollect that pofture,  
and the diretions I gave you relating to it. The  
furprife may put all out of your mind. For, tho’  
we value ourfelves on being reafunable know-  
ing creatures, reafon and knowledge feem, on  
fuch occafions, to be of little ufe to us: and the  
brutes, to whom we allow fcarce a glimmering  
of either, appear to have the advantage of us,  
  
I will, however, take this opportunity of re-  
peating thofe particulars to you, which I men-  
tioned in our laft converfation, as, by purfuing  
them at your leifure, you may poflibly imprint  
them fo in your memory, as on occafioa to be  
of fome ufe to you.  
  
Firft, that, though the legs, arms, and head  
of a human body, being folid parts, are {pecifi-  
cally fomewhat heavier than fre(h water, yet the  
trunk, particularly the upper part, from its  
hollownefs, is fo much lighter than water, as  
that the whole of the body, taken together, is  
too light to fink wholly under water, but fome  
part will remain above, until the lungs become  
filled with water ; which happens from draw-  
ing water into them inftead of air, when a per-  
fon in the fright attempts breathing, while the  
mouth and noftrils are under water,  
  
adly, That the legs and arms are fpecifically  
lighter than falt-water, and will be fupported  
by it; fo thata human body would not fink in  
  
falt-water, though the lungs were filled ay  
above, but from the greater fpecific Bravity of  
  
the head.  
  
3d!y, That therefore a perfon throwing him.  
felf on his back in falt-water, and extendig  
his arms, may eafily lie fo as to keep hie  
Mouth and noftrils free for breathing ; ang  
by a fmall motion of his hands, may prevent  
turning, if he fhould perceive any tendency to ir,  
  
4thly, That, in freth water, if a man throws  
himfelf on his back, near the furface, hecan.  
not long continue in that fituation, but bya  
proper action of his hands on the water. If he  
ufes no fuch action, the legs and the lower part  
of the body will gradually fink till he comes  
into an upright pofition,in which he will coq.  
tinue fufpended, the hollow of the breaft keep.  
ing the head upermoft,  
  
sthly, But if in this erect pofition the head  
is kept upright above the fhoulders, as when we  
ftand on the ground, the immerfion will, by the  
weight of that part of the head that is out of  
water, reach above the mouth and noftrils, per.  
haps, a little above the eyes, fo that a msn  
cannot long remain fufpended in water with his  
head in that pofition.  
  
6thly, The body continued fufpended as be.  
fore and upright, if the head be leaned quite  
back, fo that the face looks upwards, all the  
back part of the head being then under watei,  
and its weight confequently in a great meafure  
fupported by it, the face will remain above wa-  
ter quite free for breathing, will rife an inck  
higher every infpiration, and fink as much  
every expiration, but never fo low as that the  
water may come over the mouth,  
  
7thly, If therefore a perfon, unacquainted  
with {wimming, and falling accidentally into  
the water, could have prefence of mind fufi-  
cient to avoid ftruggling and plunging, and to  
let the body take this natural pofition, he  
might continue long fafe from drowning, till  
perhaps help would come. For, as to the  
cloaths, their additional weight, while im-  
merfed, is very inconfiderable, the water fup-  
porting it ; though, when he comes out of the  
water, he would find them very heavy indeed.  
  
But, as I faid before, I would not advife you  
or any one to depend on having this prefence  
of mind on fuch an occafion, but learn fairly to  
fwim, as I wifh all men were taught to doin  
their youth ; they would, on many occurrence’,  
be the fafer for having that fkill, and on many  
more the happier, as freer from painful appre-  
henfions of danger, to fay nothing of the enjoy-  
ment in fo delightful and wholefome an exer-  
cife. Soldiers particularly thould, methinks, all  
be taught to {wim ; it might be of frequent  
ufe either in furprifing an enemy, or faving  
themfelves, And, if 1 had now boys to edu-  
cate, I fhould prefer thofe {chools (other things  
being equal) where an opportunity was afforded  
for acquiring fo advantageous an art, which,  
once learnt, is never forgotten,

aftice neceffary for that purpofe,  
ave infenfibly acquired the itroke,  
taught as it were by nature.  
  
‘The practice 1 mean is this ; choof-  
ing a place where the water deepens  
gradually, walk coolly into 1, till it is  
up to your breaft, then turn round  
vour face to the fliore, and throw art  
egg into the water, between you and

and be ealily feen there, as your wa-  
terisclear, Itmut lie in the water  
{fo deep; that you carnot reach it to  
take it up, but by diving, To encou-  
rage yourfelf, in order to do this, re+  
flect that your progrefs will be from  
deeper to fhallower water, and that,  
at any time, you may, by bringing  
your legs under you, and ftanding on  
the bottom, raife your head far above  
the water, Then plunge under i  
with your eyes open, throwing yotir-  
felf towards the egg, and endiiorad-  
ing, by the action of your hands and  
feet againtt the water, to get forward,  
till within reach of it, In this  
attempt, you will find that the water  
  
uoys you up againft your inclination 3  
that it &amp; not fo eafy a thing to fink, as  
you imagined ; that you cannot, but  
by attive force, getdown to the egg.  
‘Thus you feel the power of the water  
to fupport you, and learn to confide  
in that power ; while your endeavours  
to overcome it, and to reach the egg,  
teach you the manner of a¢ting on the  
water with your feet and hands ;  
which attion is afterwards ufed, in  
{wimsning, to fupport your head higher  
above water, or to go forward through  
il.  
  
I would the more earneftly prefs  
you to the trial of this method, be-  
caufe, though I think I fatished you,  
that your body is lighter than water,  
and that you might float in it a long  
time, with your mouth free for  
breathing, if you would put yourfeif  
In a proper polture, and would be tlill,  
and forbear ftruggling ; yet, ull you

fidence in the water, | conndh depend  
on your having the neceflary prefence  
of mind, to recollect that poflure,  
and the direttions I gave you relating

we allow fcarce a glimmering of e1-  
ther, appear to have the advamtage of  
US.  
  
I will, however, take this oppors  
tiintity of repeating thofe particulars  
to you, which I menuoned in our lait  
tonverfation j as, by perufingthem at  
your leifure, you may potiibly imprint  
them fo in your memory, as, on ucca-  
fion, to be of fome ufe to you.  
  
Firtt, that, though the legs, arms,  
  
‘and head of a human body, being fo-  
  
lid parts, are fpecitically fomewhat  
heavier than frefh waier, vet the  
trunk, particularly the upper part,  
from its hollownefs, 1s fo much light=  
erthan water, thatthe whole of the  
body, taken together, is too light to  
fink wholly under water; but fome  
art will remain above, until the  
ungs become flied with water ; which  
happens from drawing water into  
them, inflead of air, when a perfon,  
inthe fright, attempts breathing, while  
the mouth and noftrils are under wa-  
ter.  
  
edly, Thar the legs and arms are  
fpecifically lighter than falt-water,  
aud will be fupported by it: fo that a  
human body weuld not fink in fali-  
water, though the lungs were tilled os  
above, but from the greater ipecifie  
gravity of the head.  
  
gdly, That, therefore, a perfon  
  
throwing Inmfelf on his back in {ali  
water, and extending his arms, mayv  
eafily lie fo as to keep his mouth and  
nolirils free for breathing; and, by a  
{mall motion of his hands, way pre-  
vent turning, if he fhould perceive  
any tendency to it.  
  
athly, That, in frefh water, if a  
rhan throws himfeif on his back, near  
the furface, he cantiot long continuc  
in that fituation, but by a proper ac-  
tion of his hands on the water, If  
he ufes no fuch action, the legs and  
lower part of the body will gradually  
fink, ull he comes inie an upright po-  
fition, in which he will continue {:f-  
pended, tHe hollow of the breaft keep-  
utg the head uppéermoft.  
  
sthly, But if in thisere@ pofition  
the head is kept upright above the  
fhoulders, as when we fland on the  
ground, the iminerfion will, by the  
weight of that part of the head thar is  
out of water, reach above the mouth  
and noftrils, perhaps a hie above me  
  
506 Method of preferving plants  
  
eyes, fo that a man cannot long re-  
main fufpended in water, with his head  
in that pofition.  
  
Gihly, The body continuing fuf-  
caked as before, and upright, if the  
Pead be leaned quite ick. fo that the  
face looks upwards, all the back part  
of the head being then under water,  
and its weight confequently in a great  
meafure fupported by it, the face will  
remain above water quite free for  
breathing, will rife an inch higher,  
every infpiration, and fink as much  
every expiration, but never fo low  
that the water may come over the  
mouth,  
  
sthly, If therefore a perfon, unac-  
quainted with {wimming, and falling  
accidentally into the water, could have  
prefence of mind fufficient to avoid  
Rruggling and plunging, and to let the  
body take this natural pofition, he  
might continue long fafe from drown-  
ing, ull perhaps help would come.  
For, as to the cloaths, their additional  
weizht, while immerfed, is very in-  
conhiderable, the water fupporting it ;  
though, when he comes out of the wa-  
ter, he would find them very heavy in-  
deed.  
  
But, as I faid before, I would not  
advife you, or any one,f{to depend on

an occafion ; but learn fairly to fwim,  
as I with all men were taught to do

fome an exercife. Soldiers particular-  
ly thould, methinks, all’ be taught to

ahove, but from the greater fpecific  
gravity of the head. ‘Thirdly, ‘That  
therefore a perfon throwing himilelf  
on his back in falt water, and extend-  
ing his arms, may eafily lie fo as to  
keep his mouth and noitrils free from  
breathing ; and by a {mall motion of  
his hands may prevent turning, if he  
{hould perceive any tendency to it.  
Fourthly, That in frefh water, if a  
man throws himfelf on his back near  
the furface, he cannot long continue  
in that fituation, but by a proper ac-  
tion of his hands onthe water. Ifhe  
ules no fuch action, the legs and  
lower part of the body will gradually  
fink till he comes into an upright po-  
fition ; in which he wiil continue fuf-  
pended, the hollow of the breait keep-  
ing the head uppermolt. Fifthly, But  
if in this erect pofition the head is  
kept upright above the fhoulders, as  
we fland on the ground, the immerfion  
will, by the weight of that part of the  
head that is out of the water, reach  
above the mouth and noitri’s, perhaps  
a little above the eyes; fo that a man  
cannot long remain falpended in wa-  
ter with his head in that pofition.  
Sixthly, The body continued fufpend-  
ed as before, and upright, if the head  
be leaned quite back, fo that the face  
looks upwards, all the back part of  
the head being then under water, and  
its weight confequently in a great  
meafure {upported by it, the face will  
remain above water quite free for  
breathing, will rife an inch higher  
cvery in{piration, and fink as much  
every expiration, but never {fo low as  
that the water may come over the  
mouth. Seventhly, If therefore a  
perfon unacquainted with {wimming,  
and falling accidentally into the water,  
could have preicnce of mind fufficient  
to avoid ftruggling and plunging, and  
to let the body take this natural pofi-  
tion, he might continue long fafe trom  
drowning, till perhaps help would  
come; for asto the clothes, their ad-  
ditional weight while immerfed is very  
inconfiderable, the water fupporting  
it; though when he comes out of the  
water, he would find them very heavy  
  
indeed. Thus far, Dr. Franklin,  
whofe remarks on this curious fubject  
are highly deferving of confideration.

the body above water. Some have  
utterly condemned the ufe of thete ;  
however, Dr. Franklin allows that  
they may be of fervice for fupporting  
the body, while one is learning what  
is called the fcfe, or that manner of  
drawing in and firiking out the hands  
and feet, that is neceflary to produce  
progreffive motion. ‘But,’ fays he,  
¢ you will be no fwimmer till you can  
place confidence in the power of the  
water to fupport you: I would there-  
fore advife the acquiring that confi-  
dence in the firlt place, efpecially as  
I have known feveral who, by a lit-  
tle of the practice neceffary for that  
purpofe, have infenfibly acquired the  
tiroke, taught as it were by nature.  
The praétice I mean is this: choof-  
ing a place where the water deepers

gradually, walk coolly into it till it is  
up to your breatt: then turn round  
your face to the fhore, and throw an  
egg nto the water, between you and  
the fhore; it will fink to the bottom,  
and be eafily feen there, if the water  
is clear; it muft lie in the water fo  
deep that you cannot reach it but by  
diving for it. To encourage yourfelf  
in order to do this, refleé&amp; that your  
progrefs will be from deeper to fhal-  
lower water ; and that at any time you  
may, by bringing your legs under  
you, and ftanding on the bottom, raife  
your head far above the water: then  
plunge under it with your eyes open,  
throwing yourfelf toward the egg,  
and endeavouring, by the action of  
your hands and feet againft the water,  
to get forward till within reach of it.  
In this attempt you will find that the  
water buoys you up againtt your in-  
clination ; that it is not fo eafy a thing  
as you imagined ; that you cannot but  
by active force get down to the egg.  
Thus you feel the power of the water  
to fupport you, and learn to confide in  
that power; while your endeavours to  
overcome it, and to reach the egg,  
teach you the manner of acting on the  
water, with your feet and hands;  
which aétion is afterward ufed in  
fwimming to fupport your head higher  
above water, or to go forward through  
it.”

coolly into it, till it ii up to your brcn^t;  
then turn round your fart* lo the »hore,  
and Ihrow an into the water be¬  
tween you and the shore; it will sink to  
the bottom, and be easily iceo, as the  
water is clear ; it must lie in the water  
so deep, as that you cannot reach it to  
take it up, but by diving for it. To en¬  
courage yourself in order to do this, re¬  
flect that your proj;ress will he from  
deeper to shallower water, and that at  
any time you may, by brinj;in«; your  
lei&#x27;s under you, and standing on the bot¬  
tom* raiise your head far above the  
water. Then plung^e under it with your  
eyes open, throwinji&#x27; yonrself towards  
the egg;, and endeavouring, by (he ac¬  
tion of your hands and feel against the  
water, to get forward till within reach  
of it. In this attempt you will find  
that the water buoys yon up against  
your inclination ; that it is not so easy  
a tiling to sink as you imagine; that  
you cannot but by active force get  
down to the egg; thus you feel the  
power of the water to support you,  
and learn to confide in that power,  
while your endeavours to overcome it,  
and to reach the egg, teach you the  
manner of acting with your hands and  
feet oil the water; which action is after¬  
wards* used&#x27;in swimming to sdpport  
your head higher above water, or to  
go forward through it. I would the-  
more earuestly press you to the trial of  
this method, because*, though I tiiink 1  
satisfied you that your body is lighter  
than water, and that }ou might float in  
it a long time, with your mouth free for  
breathing, if you would put yourselfia  
a proper posture, would be still, and  
forbear struggling, yet till you have  
obtained this experimental confidence  
in the water, i cannot depend upon  
your having (he necessary presence of  
tnind to recollect that posture, and the  
difrections I gave }ou relating to it.  
The surprise may put all out of your  
mind; for though we value ourselves  
on being reasonable knowing creatures,  
reason and knowledge seem, on such  
occasions, to be of little use lo us, and  
the brutes, to whom we allow scarce a  
gliraniering of either, appear to have  
the advantage of us. 1 will, however,  
take this opportunity of repeating those  
particulars to you, which 1 meutioned  
incur last coiiversathon; as, by perusing  
them at vour leisure, you may possibly  
imprint them so in your memory, as,  
pn occasion, to be of some use lo you.  
r-fint, that though the legs, armf,  
  
  
Tind head of a hunian body, bc^ng tolii  
pHiis, are specifically somewhat heavier  
than fresh water, yet the trunk, parti*  
&#x27;cuiarly the iipfior (lart, from its hollow¬  
ness, is so much lighter than water, as  
that.the whole of the body taken toge¬  
ther is too light to sink wholly under  
water, but some part will remain above,  
until the lungs become fiilcil with wa¬  
ter, which happens from drawing water  
into them instead of air, when a person  
in the fright attempts breathing, while  
the moiitli and nostrils are under water.  
Secondly, that the legs and arms are  
speciHcafiy lighter than salt water, and  
will be supported by it.* S&gt; that a hu¬  
man b(Mly would not sink in aaJt water,  
though the lungs were tilled as above,  
but from the great specific gravity of  
•the head. Thirdly, that therefore a  
person throwing himself upon his back,  
in salt water, and extending his arms,  
may easily lie so ns to keep his mouth  
and nostrils free for breathing, and by  
a smnjl motion of his hands may pre¬  
vent turning, if he should perceive any  
tendency to it. Fourthly, that in fresh  
water, if a man throws himself on hit  
back near the surface, lie cannot long  
continue in that sitiiatioii, but by a  
proper action of bis bauds on the wa¬  
ter : if he uses no such action, the legs  
and lower part of the body will gradu¬  
ally sink, till be comes into an upright.  
position, in which be will continue sus- &#x27;  
pended, the hollow of (he breast keep¬  
ing the head iippcnnost. Fifthly, but  
if, in this erect position, the head is  
kept upright aboie the shoulders, ns  
when wc stand on the ground, the im¬  
mersion will, by the weight of (hat part  
of the liead that is out of Ihe water,  
reach above (he mouth and nostrils,  
perhaps a little above the eyes | so  
liiaL a roan cannot long remain sus¬  
pended in water, with bis head in that  
position. Sixthly, the body continued  
suspended as before, and upright, if the  
liead be leaned quite back, so that the  
face looks upwards, ail the back part of  
the head being then under water, and  
its weight, consequently, in a great mea¬  
sure supported hy it, the fare will re-  
iniiu above water quite free fur breath-  
iug, will rise au inch higher every inspi¬  
ration, and sink every expiration; but  
never to low, as that the water maj  
coine over the mouth. Se\enthly, if,  
therefore, a person uoarquainled with  
•wimmiug, and falling accidentally iuta  
the water, could have prrsenee ot mind

had imagined; that you cannot but by active force get  
down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of the water  
to support you, and learn to confide in that power;  
while your endeavours to overcome it, and reach the  
egg, teach you the manner of acting on the water with  
your feet and hands, which action is afterwards used it  
swimming to support your head higher above water  
or to go forward through it. I would the more ear-  
nestly press you to the trial of this method, because  
though I think I satisfied you that your body is lighter  
than water, and that you might float in it a long time  
with your mouth free for breathing, if you put yourself  
in a proper posture and would be still and forbear  
struggling ; yet till you have obtained this experimental  
contidence in the water, I cannot depend on your hav-  
ing the necessary presence of mind to recollect that pos-  
ture and the directions I gave you relating to it. The  
surprise may put all out of your mind. For though we  
value ourselves on being reasonable creatures, reason and  
knowledge seem on such occasions to be of little use to  
us ; and the brutes, to whom we allow scarce a glim-  
mering of either, appear to have the advantage of us.  
I will, however, take this opportunity of repeating those  
particulars to you, which I mentioned in our last con-  
versation, as, by perusing them at your leisure, you may  
possibly imprint them so in your memory as on occa-  
sions to be of some use to you, Ist. That though the  
legs, being solid parts, are specifically something heavier  
than fresh-water, yet the trunk, particularly the upper  
part, from its hollowness, is so much lighter than water,  
as that the whole of the body taken together is too light  
to sink wholly under water, but some part will remain  
above, until the lungs become filled with water, which  
happens from drawing water into them instead of air,  
when a person in the fright attempts breathing while  
the mouth and nostrils are under water. 2ndly. That  
the legs and arms are specifically lighter than salt- water,  
and will be supported by it, so that a human body  
would not sink in salt-water, though the lungs were  
filled as above, but from the greater specific gravity of  
the head. 3rdly. That therefore a person throwing  
himself on his back in salt-water, and extending his  
arms, may easily lie so as to keep his mouth and nos-  
trils free for breathing; and by a small motion of his  
hands may prevent turning, if he should perceive any

himself on his back near the surface, he cannot long  
continue in that situation, but by proper action of his  
hands on the water. If he uses no such action, the  
legs and lower part of the body will gradually sink till  
he comes into an upright position, in which he will con-  
tinue suspended, the hollow of the breast keeping the  
head uppermost. 5thly. But if, in this erect position,  
the head is kept upright above the shoulders, as when  
we stand on the ground, the immersion will, by the  
weight of that part of the head that is out of water,  
reach above the mouth and nostrils, perhaps a little  
above the eyes, so that a man cannot long remain sus-  
pended in water with his head in that position. 6thly.  
The body continuing suspended as before, and upright,  
if the head be leaned quite back, so that the face looks  
upwards, all the back part of the head being then under  
water, and its weight consequently in a great measure  
supported by it, the face will remain above water quite  
free for breathing, will rise an inch higher every inspira-  
tion, and sink as much every expiration, but never so  
low as that the water may come over the mouth, 7thly.  
If therefore a person unacquainted with swimming, and  
falling accidentally into the water, could have-presence  
of mind sufficient to avoid struggling and plunging, and  
to let the body take this natural position, he might con-  
tinue long safe from drowning till perhaps help would

use of corks or bladders to assist in keeping the body  
above water; some have utterly condemned the use  
of them ; however, they may be of service for support-  
ing the body, while one is learning what is called the  
stroke, or that manner of drawing in and striking out  
the hands and feet that is necessary to produce pro-  
gressive motion. But you will be no swimmer till  
you can place confidence in the power of the water  
to —— you. I would therefore advise the acquir-  
ing that confidence in the first place, especially as I  
have known several, who, by a little practice neces-  
sary for that purpose, have insensibly acquired the  
ng herp as if it were bynature. The practice I  
mean is this: choosing a place where the water deepens  
gradually, walk y into it till it is up to your  
breast; then turn round your face to the dese, and  
throw an into the water between you and the  
shore ; it sink to the bottom, and be easily seen  
there if the water be clean. It must lie in the water  
80 deep that you cannot reach to take it up but by  
diving for it. To encourage yourself, in order to do  
reflect that your progress will be from deep to

bringing your legs under you, and standing on the

eyelids for the weight of water above you, throwing  
yourself towards the egg, and endeavouring, by the  
action of your hands and feet against the water, to  
get forward, till within reach of it. In this attempt  
you will find that the water buoys you up against  
your inclination; that it is not so easy to sink as you  
imagine, and that you cannot but by active force get  
down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of water  
to support you, and learn to confide in that power,  
while your endeavours to overcome it, and reach the  
egg, teach you the manner of acting on the water  
with your feet and hands, which action is afterwards  
used in swimming to support your head higher above  
the water, or to go forward through it.  
  
I would the more earnestly press you to the trial of  
this method, because, though I think I shall satisfy  
you that your body is lighter than water, and that  
you might float in it a long time with your mouth  
free for breathing, if you would put yourself into a  
proper posture, and would be still, and forbear strug-  
gling ; yet, till you have obtained this experimental  
confidence in the water, I cannot depend upon your  
having the necessary presence of mind to recollect the  
posture, and the directions I gave you relating to it.  
The surprise may put all out of your mind.  
  
Though the legs, arms, and head of a human body,  
being solid parts, are, specifically, somewhat heavier  
than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly the up-  
per part, from its hollowness, is so much lighter than  
water, as that the whole of the body, taken altogether,  
is too light to sink wholly under water; but some  
part will remain above, until the lungs become filled  
with water, which happens from drawing water to  
them instead of air, when a person, in the fright, at-  
tempts breathing while the mouth and nostrils are  
under water. If, therefore, a person unacquainted  
with swimming, and falling accidentally into the wa-  
ter, could have presence of mind sufficient to avoid  
struggling and plunging, and to let the body take this  
natural position, he might continue long safe from  
drowning, till perhaps help should come.  
  
But as I said before, I would not advise you or any  
one to depend on having this presence of mind on such  
an occasion, but learn fairly to swim, as I wish all men  
were taught to doin their youth; they would on many

the whole of the body, taken together, is too light to  
sink wholly under the water, but some part will remain  
above until the lungs become filled with water. This  
happens from drawing water into them instead of air,  
when a person in his fright attempts breathing while  
the mouth and nostrils are submerged. The legs and  
arms are specifically lighter than salt water, and will  
be supported by it; so that a human body would not  
sink in salt water, even though the lungs were filled  
with water, if it were not for the greater specific gravity  
of the head; consequently a person throwing himselt  
upon his back and extending his arms may easily lie so  
as to keep his mouth and nostrils free for breathing,  
and, by a slight motion of his hands, may prevent his  
body turning, if he should perceive any tendency to-  
wards it. But in fresh water, if a man throws him-  
self upon his back near the surface, he cannot long  
continue in that situation but by a proper action of  
his hands on the water; if he uses no such action,  
the legs and the lower part of the body will gradually  
sink till he comes into an upright position, in which he  
will continue suspended, the hollow of the chest keep-  
ing the head uppermost. But if, in this erect position,  
the head is kept upright above the shoulders, as when  
we stand on the ground, the immersion will, by the  
weight of that part of the head that is out of the water,  
reach above the mouth and nostrils, perhaps a little  
above the eyes,so that no one can long remain sus-  
pended in water with his head in that position. But  
with the body suspended in this manner and upright,  
if the head be thrown quite back, so that the fase looks  
upwards, all the back part of the head will then be  
under water, and its weight being in a great measure  
supported by it, the face will remain above water quite  
free for breathing. It will rise an inch higher at every  
inspiration and sink as much at every expiration, but  
never so low as that the water may come over the  
mouth, When a person who is unacquainted with  
swimming accidentally falls into the water, if he could  
summou up sufficient presence of mind to avoid  
struggling and plunging, and to let the body take this  
natural position, he might thus remain for a long time  
safe from drowning,—till, perhaps, assistance might  
arrive. For, as regards the clothes, their additional  
weight, while immersed, is very inconsiderable, the  
water supporting it, although they are very heavy  
indeed when taken out of the water. But it is not  
advisable for any one to depend on having this presence  
of mind on such an occasion, and he should fairly learn  
to swim. He would then, on many occasions, be the

the passengers possessed  
a knowledge of the art of ewimming,  
for the reason that those who hare that  
knowledge are, in the hour of danger,  
more likely to retain their coolneea and  
presence of mind, and be of service to  
their fellows in misfortune, while they  
are better able to support themselves  
and keep afloat until assistance reaches  
them, without the exertion of struggling  
and consequent loss of strength which  
is the natural result to any person find­  
ing himself suddenly plunged into deep  
water and without knowing how to  
awim. The following facts in this con­  
nection are worth remembering:  
Though the legs, arms and head of a  
human body, being solid parts, are,  
specifically, somewhat heavier than  
fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly  
the upper part, for its hollowness, is so  
much fighter than water, as Jthat the  
whole of the body, taken altogether, is  
too light to sink wholly under water,  
but some part will remain above, until  
the lunge become filled with it, which  
happens from drawing water into them  
instead of air, when a person in a fright  
attempts breathing while the mouth  
and nostrils are under water.  
The legs and arms are, specifically,  
lighter than salt water, and will be sup­  
ported by it, so that a human body  
cannot sink in salt water, though the  
lungs were filled, but from the greater  
specific gravity of the bead. Therefore,  
a person throwing himself on his back  
in salt water, and extending his arms,  
may easily lie so at to keep his mouth  
and nostrils free for breatLing and by a  
small motion of his hands may prevent  
turning, if any tendency towards such  
a result should be experienced.  
In fresh water if a man throw him­  
self on his back, near the surface, he  
cannot continue in that situation but  
by proper action of his hands on the  
water ; if he uses no such action, the  
legs and lower part of the body will  
gradually sink till he comes into an up­  
right position, in which he will continue  
suspended, the hollow of his breast  
keeping the head uppermost. But, if in  
this erect position the head be kept up­  
right above the ehoulders, as when  
standing on the ground, the emersion  
will, by the weight of that portion of  
the head that is out of the water, reach  
above the mouth and nostrils, perhaps  
a little above the eyes, so that a man  
cannot long remain thus suspended in  
water.  
If, however the head be leaned quite  
back, so that the face looks upward, all  
the back part of the head being under  
water, ana its weight, consequently, in  
a great measure supported by it, the  
face will remain above the water quite  
free for breathing, will rise an inch  
higher at every inspiration, and sink as  
much each respiration, but never so  
low that the water will come over the  
mouth. Therefore, if a person unac­  
quainted with ewimming, and, falling  
accidentally into the water, could have  
presence of mind sufficient to avoid  
struggling and plunging, and to let the  
body take this natural position, be  
might continue long free from drowning  
till, perhaps, help should oome ; for, as  
to the cloths, their additional weight  
when immersed is very inconsiderable,  
the water supporting tbem ; though on  
coming out of the water tbey would feel  
very heavy indeed. No one, however,  
should depend upon having this pres­  
ence of mind on such an occasion, but  
learn fairly to swim.

, followed by others in quick  
succession. Men&#x27;s hearts throbbed, and  
women shrieked. Many fled from the  
house. Father Dumouriez was the first to  
recover his self-possession.  
&quot;Open that door!&quot; he cried.  
Some one threw open the door leading  
into Jacques Turgot&#x27;s room. The priest  
stepped forward and looked in, but recoiled  
with horror at what he saw.  
In the corner, grovelling amid a mass  
of upturned bricks and earth, with both  
hands full of gold coin, crouched what  
had once been a man--ragged and blood­  
smeared, with the fire of madness in his  
eyes.  
Jean Turgot was a maniac.  
Facts About Swimming.  
Though the legs, arms, and head of a  
human body, being solid parts, are, spe­
