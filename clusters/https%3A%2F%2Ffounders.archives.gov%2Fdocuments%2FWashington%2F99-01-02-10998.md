At Head-quarters, Newburgh: “‘ We stand now an Inde-  
pendent People, and have yet to learn political Tactics. We  
are placed among the nations of the Earth, and have a char-  
acter to establish; but how we shall acquit ourselves, time  
must discover. The probability is (at least I fear it) that  
local or State politics will interfere too much with the more  
liberal and extensive plan of government, which wisdom  
and foresight, freed from the mist of prejudice, would dic-  
tate; and that we shall be guilty of many blunders in tread-  
ing this boundless theatre, before we shall have arrived at  
any perfection in this art; in a word, that the experience,  
which is purchased at the price of difficulties and distress,  
will alone convince us, that the honor, power, and true In-  
terest of this Country must be measured by a Continental  
scale, and that every departure therefrom weakens the  
Union, and may ultimately break the band which holds us  
together.” — Washington to the Marquis de Lafayette.
