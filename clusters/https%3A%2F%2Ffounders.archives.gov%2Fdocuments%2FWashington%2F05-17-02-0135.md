,  
Philadelphia Novr 23d 1794  
  
Your letter of the 16th with the reports—except the Carpenters, which I have been without for several weeks—came to my hands yesterday.  
As I expected, so it happened, my letters to Colo. Willm Washington of Westmoreland, did not reach him until a few days ago. As you seem to be of the same opinion wch I entertained at first,  
  
namely, that from the easy and simple manners of Donaldson, he wd not be a fit overlooker of Negros, I have again written to my Nephew concerning the Carpenter in his neighbourhood; and put the letter under cover to you, open, that if you have engaged a person for this business, or have one in contemplation for it that you think will answer well, you may accompany it by a line from yourself to stop his application—otherwise let it go, &amp; wait the result of Colo. Washington’s answer, which agreeably to my request, I expect you will receive; before you engage any other. In case you should get any one in the place of Donaldson as an overlooker of the Carpenters, let him, Isaac &amp; the boy Jem, be kept to the making &amp; repairing of Carts of different sorts, Wheels, Plows, Harrows Rakes Wheelbarrows, and all kinds of farming impliments; and tell him, as from me, that I hope, &amp; expect, that he will take pains to instruct both Isaac and the Boy in the principles of the work; that I may derive benifit hereafter from his instruction of them.  
If you should succeed in getting an Overlooker for the outdoors Carpenters, you will direct the execution of such work as appears to be most wanting. but whether he be a married, or a single man, he must not occupy the rooms in the store house; these, while you remain in what is called the Servants Hall, must be kept for Gentlemens servants, and my own, while I am on a visit to Mount Vernon. When you remove to the Ferry (if you mean to do so) and the house you are now in, is restored to its former use—a single man might, in that case, occupy the rooms in the store house, in the manner Mr Whitting did; but it would not be very convenient for a married man (especially one with children) to be there.  
Speaking of Gentlemens Servts it calls to my mind, that in a letter from Mrs Fanny Washington to Mrs Washington (her Aunt) she mentions, that since I left Mount Vernon she has given out four dozn and eight bottles of wine. Whether they are used, or not, she does not say; but I am led by it to observe, that it is not my intention that it should be given to every one who may incline to make a convenience of the house, in travelling; or who may be induced to visit it from motives of curiosity. There are but three descriptions of people to whom I think it ought to be given: first my particular and intimate acquaintance, in case business should call them there, such for instance as Doctr  
  
Craik. 2dly some of the most respectable foreigners who may, perchance, be in Alexandria or the federal city; and be either brought down, or introduced by letter, from some of my particular acquaintance as before mentioned; or thirdly, to persons of some distinction (such as members of Congress &amp;ca) who may be travelling through the Country from North to South, or from south to North; in the first of which, I should not fail to give letters, where I conceive them entitled. Unless some caution of this sort governs, I should be run to an expence as improper, as it would be considerable; for the duty upon Madeira wine makes it one of the most expensive liquors that is now used; while my stock of it is small—and old wine (of which that is) is not to be had upon any terms: for which reason—and for the limited purposes already mentioned, I had rather you would provide claret, or other wine on which the duty is not so high, than to use my Madeira, unless it be on very extraordinary occasions.  
I have no objection to any sober, &amp; orderly person’s gratifying their curiosity in viewing the buildings, Gardens &amp;ca about Mount Vernon; but it is only to such persons as I have described, that I ought to be run to any expence on account of these visits of curiosity, beyond common civility &amp; hospitality. No gentleman who has a proper respect for his own character (except relations &amp; intimates) would use the house in my absence for the sake of conveniency (as it is far removed from the public roads) unless invited to do so by me or some friend; nor do I suppose any of this description would go there without a personal, or written introduction.  
I have been thus particular, that you may have a full view of my ideas on this subject, &amp; conform to them; and because the knowledge I have of my servants is such, as to believe, that if opportunities are given them, they will take off two glasses of wine for every one that is drank by such visitors, and tell you they were used by them; without such a watch over them as the other business you are employed in, would not allow you to bestow.  
I observe what you say respecting the Hogs for Porke, and have to add that so many as are necessary to furnish all those who, by your agreements, are entitled to be served with Porke, with a moderate allowance for Bacon for the use of the Mansion house, should be put up; whether they be old or young: and I wish pains may be taken to cure the latter, as the most of that  
  
which was sent to this place was spoiled. The principal reason why I requested that none but full grown Hogs might be put up this fall, was, that my stock of them another year might be the better for it: but as I do not mean to buy porke, the necessity of breaking in upon the young hogs is unavoidable.  
It was an omission of McKoy not to measure his Potatoes when, and as they were taken from the fields; and it is the more to be regretted, as I wanted to know the quantity which grew in each lot, and in a particular manner, the quantity that grew among the Corn at that place; that I might see &amp; compare the Crop of Corn &amp; the Crop of Potatoes together. But it would seem as if my blundering Overseers would forever put it out of my power to ascertain facts from the accuracy of experiments. Make your estimate (as I observed in my last) of the quantity of Potatoes required for seed next year, allowing for waste and spoilage, before you use, or sell many. It being my wish that many shd be planted.  
In making the calculation whether it is better to sell Wheat in grain, or in flour, it will be necessary to learn previously whether the first is sold by measure or by the weight at Alexandria—for if 60 lbs. is called a bushel, and the wheat weighs not more than 55 lbs. the difference will be very great when a 100 bushls by measure is reduced to the bushels it will yield by weight at 60 lbs.  
You have never informed me what precise measures have been taken with respect to the tresspasses on my land on four mile run—either of what has passed, or for prevention. I wish you would see Mr Minor &amp; converse with him on this subject; and act according to circumstances. If it be necessary to Survey the land in order to ascertain the tresspasses, &amp; the boundaries, let it be done by some skilful person. The Papers I left with you. The wood is the most valuable part of the tract.  
You did very right in putting the amount of Colo. Lyles bond into the bank of Alexandria. Let me know the precise amount thereof. as also of what you deposited there before, that I may debit the Bank for it. With this letter, you will receive another, enclosing money to discharge my bond to Mr Lund Washington; my donation to the charity school in Alexandria; &amp; subscription towards the Salary of Mr Davis; which I desire may be done without delay. I wish you well &amp; remain Your friend

Philadelphia Nov&quot; 234 1794.  
Mr. Pearce,  
  
Your letter of the 16 with the reports—except the Car-  
penters, which I have been without for several weeks—came  
to my hands yesterday.—  
  
As I expected, so it happened, my letters to Col? Will™  
Washington of Westmoreland, did not reach him until a few  
days ago.—As you seem to be of the same opinion w™ I en-  
tertained at first, namely, that from the easy and simple man-  
ners of Donaldson, he w* not be a fit overlooker of Negros, I  
have again written to my Nephew concerning the Carpenter  
in his neighbourhood ; and put the letter under cover to you,  
open, that if you have engaged a person for this business, or  
have one in contemplation for it that you think will answer  
well, you may accompany it by a line from yourself to stop  
his application—otherwise let it go, and wait the result of  
Col? Washington’s answer, which agreeably to my request, |  
expect you will receive; before you engage any other.—In  
case you should get any one in the place of Donaldson as an  
overlooker of the Carpenters, let him, Isaac and the boy Jem,  
be kept to the making and repairing of Carts of different sorts,  
Wheels, Plows, Harrows, Rakes, Wheelbarrows, and all kinds  
of farming impliments ;—and tell him, as from me, that I  
hope, and expect, that he will take pains to instruct both Isaac  
and the Boy in the principles of the work ; that I may derive  
benifit hereafter from his instruction of them.—  
  
If you should succeed in getting an Overlooker for the out-  
doors Carpenters, you will direct the execution of such work  
as appears to be most wanting.—but whether he be a married,  
or a single man, he must not occupy the rooms in the store

vants Hall, must be kept for Gentlemens servants, and my  
own, while I am on a visit to Mount Vernon.—When you re-  
move to the Ferry (if you mean to do so) and the house you  
are now in, is restored to its former use—a single man might,  
in that case, occupy the rooms in the store house, in the man-

for a Married Man (especially one with children) to be there.—

or introduced by letter, from some of my particular acquaint-  
ance as before mentioned ;—or thirdly, to persons of some  
distinction (such as members of Congress &amp;c&#x27;) who may be  
travelling through the Country from North to South, or from  
south to North ;—to the first of which, I should not fail to  
give letters, where I conceive them entitled.—Unless some  
caution of this sort governs, I should be run to an expence as  
improper, as it would be considerable ;—for the duty upon  
Madeira wine makes it one of the most expensive liquors that  
is now used ;—while my stock of it is small—and old wine (of  
which that is) is not to be had upon any terms: for which  
reason, and for the limited purposes already mentioned, I had  
rather you would provide Claret, or other wine on which the  
duty is not so high, than to use my Madeira; unless it be on  
very extraordinary occasions.—  
  
[ have no objection to any sober, or orderly person’s grati-  
fying their curiosity in viewing the buildings, Gardens &amp;c*  
about Mount Vernon ;—but it is only to such persons as I  
have described, that I ought to be run to any expence on ac-  
count of these visits of curiosity, beyond common civility and  
hospitality.—No gentleman who has a proper respect for his  
own character (except relations and intimates) would use the  
house in my absence for the sake of conveniency (as it is far  
removed from the public roads) unless invited to do so by  
me or some friend ;—nor do I suppose any of this description  
would go there without a personal, or written introduction.—  
  
[ have been thus particular, that you may have a full view  
of my ideas on this subject, and conform to them ;—and  
because the knowledge I have of my servants is such, as  
to believe, that if opportunities are given them, they will

such visitors, and tell you they were used by them; without  
such a watch over them as the other business you are em-  
ployed in, would not allow you to bestow.—  
  
I observe what you say respecting the Hogs for Porke, and  
have to add that so many as are necessary to furnish all those  
who, by your agreements, are entitled to be served with  
Porke ; with a moderate allowance for Bacon for the use of  
the Mansion house, should be put up; whether they be old  
or young:—and I wish pains may be taken to cure the latter,  
as the most of that which was sent to this place was spoiled.  
—The principal reason why I requested that none but full  
grown Hogs might be put up this fall, was, that my stock of  
them another year might be the better for it:—but as I do  
not mean to buy porke, the necessity of breaking in upon the  
young hogs is unavoidable.&quot;  
  
It was an omission of M‘Koy not to measure his Potatoes  
when, and as they were taken from the fields; and it is the  
more to be regretted, as I wanted to know the quantity which  
grew in each lot, and in a particular manner, the quantity  
that grew among the Corn at that place; that I might see  
and compare the Crop of Corn and the Crop of Potatoes  
together.—But it would seem as if my blundering Overseers  
would forever put it out of my power to ascertain facts from  
the accuracy of experiments.—Make your estimate (as I  
observed in my last) of the quantity of Potatoes required  
for seed next year, allowing for waste and spoilage, before  
you use, or sell any.—It being my wish that many sh* be  
planted.—  
  
In making the calculation whether it is better to sell  
Wheat in grain, or in flour, it will be necessary to learn pre-  
viously whether the first is sold by measure or by the weight  
at Alexandria—for if 60” is called a bushel, and the wheat  
weighs only 55” the difference will be very great when a 100

AND MOUNT VERNON. 131  
  
bush by measure is reduced to the bushels it will yield by  
weight at 60”.  
  
You have never informed me what precise measures have  
been taken with respect to the trespasses on my land on four  
mile run—either of what has passed, or for prevention.—]  
wish you would see Mr. Minor and converse with him on this  
subject ; and act according to circumstances.—If it be neces-  
sary to survey the land in order to ascertain the trespasses,  
and the boundaries, let it be done by some skilful person.—  
The Papers I left with you.—The wood is the most valuable  
part of the tract.—  
  
You did very right in putting the amount of Col? Lyles  
bond into the bank of Alexandria.—Let me know the precise

that I may debit the Bank for it—With this letter, you will  
receive another, enclosing money to discharge my bond to  
Mr. Lund Washington ; my donation to the charity school in  
Alexandria; and subscription towards the Salary of Mr.  
Davis; which I desire may be done without delay.—  
  
I wish you well and remain

daughters and her grandson.  
  
Washington prided himself upon his wines,  
and he was not as improvident in regard to  
their use as was Thomas Jefferson. In one  
of his letters to William Pierce, who had the  
charge of his Mount Vernon estate during  
his presidency, he sets down the classes of  
people to whom wine shall be served when  
they called at Mount Vernon, and this letter  
is so interesting that I quote it. It was pub-  
  
lished for the first time several years ago in  
the Magazine of American History. It reads:  
  
Nov. 23, 1794.  
  
* * * * Speaking of Gentlemens Serv&#x27;nts it calls  
to my mind, that in a letter from Mrs. Fanny  
Washington to Mrs. Washington (her aunt) she  
mentions, that since I left Mount Vernon she has  
given out four doz’n and eight bottles of wine.  
Whether they are used, or not, she does not say ;  
but I am led by it to observe, that it is not my  
intention that it should be given to every one who  
may incline to make a convenience of the house in  
travelling ; or who may be induced to visit it from  
motives of curiosity. There are but three descrip-  
tions of people to whom I think it ought to be given:  
—first, my farticudar and intimate acquaintance, in  
should call them there, such for  
Doct’r Craik.—2ndly,  
most respectable foreigners who may, perchance,  
be in Alexandria or the Federal City, and be either

my intention that it should be given to  
every one who may ineline to make a  
convenience of my house in traveling

to the first of which [I should not fail  
to give letters where I conceive them  
entitled. Unless some caution of this sort  
governs, I should be run to an expense as  
improper as it wotld be considerable, for  
the duty upon Madeira wine makes it one  
of the most expensive liquors that is now  
used; while my stock of it is small—and  
old wine (of which that is) is not to be had  
upon any terms; for which reason, and for  
the limited purpose already mentioued, I  
had rather you would provide claret, or  
other wine on which the duty is not so  
high, than to use my Madeira, unless it be  
on very extraordinary occasions,”
