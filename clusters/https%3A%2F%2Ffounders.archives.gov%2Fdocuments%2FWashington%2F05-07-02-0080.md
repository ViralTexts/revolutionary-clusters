I, the President of the United States, by my own mouth, and by a written speech signed with my own hand, and sealed with the seal of the United States, speak to the Seneka Nation, and desire their Attention, and that they would keep this speech in remembrance of the friendship of the United States.  
I have received your Speech with satisfaction, as a proof of your confidence in the justice of the United States—and I have attentively examined the several objects which you have laid before me, whether delivered by your Chiefs at Tioga point in the last month to Colonel Pickering, or laid before me in the present month by the Cornplanter and the other Seneka Chiefs now in Philadelphia.  
In the first place I observe to you, and I request it may sink  
  
in your minds, that it is my desire, and the desire of the United States that all the miseries of the late war should be forgotten and buried forever. That in future, the United States and the six nations should be truly brothers, promoting each other’s prosperity by acts of mutual justice &amp; friendship.  
I am not uninformed that the six nations have been led into some difficulties with respect to the sale of their lands since the peace. But I must inform you that these arose before the present government of the United States was established, when the separate States, and individuals under their authority, undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands.  
But the case is now entirely altered—the general government only has the power to treat with the Indian nations, and any treaty formed and held without its authority will not be binding.  
Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands—No state nor person can purchase your lands, unless at some public treaty held under the Authority of the United States. The general Government will never consent to your being defrauded—But it will protect you in all your just rights.  
Hear well, and let it be heard by every person in your nation, that the President of the United States declares, that the general government considers itself bound to protect you in all the lands secured to you by the treaty of Fort Stanwix, the 22d of October 1784, excepting such parts as you may since have fairly sold to persons properly authorized to purchase of you.  
You complain of John Livingston and Oliver Phelps have obtained your lands, assisted by Mr Street of Niagara, and they have not complied with their agreement.  
It appears, upon enquiry of the Governor of New York, that John Livingston was not legally authorized to treat with you, and that every thing he did with you has been declared null and void, so that you may rest easy on that account.  
But it does not appear from any proofs yet in the possession of government, that Oliver Phelps has defrauded you.  
If, however you should have any just cause of complaint against him, and can make satisfactory proof thereof, the federal Courts will be open to you for redress, as to all other persons.  
But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining lands, and I have therefore upon this point, me[a]nt to be sufficiently strong and clear.  
  
That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands—That you possess the right to sell, and the right of refusing to sell your lands.  
That, therefore, the sale of your lands in future, will depend entirely upon yourselves.  
But that when you may find it for your interest to sell any parts of your lands, the United States must be present by their Agent, and will by your security that you shall not be defrauded in the Bargain you may make.  
It will, however, be important, before you make any further sales of your land, that you should determine among yourselves, who are the persons among you that shall give sure conveyances thereof as shall be binding upon your nation, and forever preclude all disputes relative to the validity of the sale.  
That besides the before mentioned security for your land, you will perceive by the law of Congress, for regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian-tribes, the fatherly care the United States intend to take of the Indians. For the particular meaning of this law, I refer you to the explanations given thereof by Colonel Pickering at Tioga, which with the law, are herewith delivered to you.  
You have said in your Speech that the game is going away from you, and that you thought it the design of the great spirit, that you should till the ground. But before you speak upon this subject, you want to know whether the United States meant to leave you any land to till?  
You know now that all the lands secured to you by the treaty of Fort Stanwix, expecting such parts as you may since have fairly sold are your’s, and that only your own Acts can convey them away—speak therefore your wishes on the subject of tilling the ground. The United States will be happy to afford you every assistance in the only business which will add to your numbers and happiness.  
The murders that have been committed upon some of your people, by the bad white men, I sincerely lament and reprobate—and I earnestly hope that the real murderers will be secured and punished as they deserve. This business has been sufficiently explained to you here by the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by Colonel Pickering on behalf of the United States, at Tioga.  
  
The Senekas may be assured, that the rewards offered for apprehending the murderers, will be continued until they are secured for trial, and that when they shall be apprehended, that they will be tried and punished as if they had killed Whitemen.  
Having answered the most material parts of your speech, I shall inform you, that some bad Indians, and the outcast of several tribes who reside at the Miamee Village, have long continued their murders and depredations upon the frontiers laying along the Ohio. That they have not only refused to listen to my voice inviting them to peace, but that upon receiving it, they renewed their incursions and murders with greater violence than ever. I have therefore been obliged to strike those bad people, in order to make them sensible of their madness. I sincerely hope they will harken to reason, and not require to be further chastised. The United States desire to be the friends of the Indians, upon terms of justice &amp; humanity—But they will not suffer the depredations of the bad people to go unpunished.  
My desire is that you would caution all the Senekas and six nations to prevent their rash young men from joining the Miamee Indians. For the United States cannot distinguish the tribes to which bad Indians belong, and every tribe must take care of their own people.  
The merits of the Cornplanter and his friendship for the United States are well known to me, and shall not be forgotten—And as a mark of the esteem of the United States, I have directed the Secretary of War to make him a present of Two hundred and fifty dollars, either in money or goods, as the Cornplanter shall like best—And he may depend upon the future care and kindness of the United States—And I have also directed the Secretary of War to make suitable presents to their other Chiefs present in Philadelphia—and also that some further tokens of friendship to be forwarded to the other Chiefs now in their nation.  
Remember my words, Senekas, continue to be strong in your friendship for the United States, as the only rational ground of your future happiness—and you may rely upon their kindness and protection.  
An Agent shall soon be appointed to reside in some place convenient to the Senekas and six nations—He will represent the United States—apply to him on all occasions.  
  
If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the United States, mark that man as your enemy, for he will mean to deceive you, and lead you into trouble. The United States will be true &amp; faithful to their engagements. Given under my hand, and the Seal of the United States at the City of Philadelphia, this twenty ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred &amp; ninety one, and in the fifteenth year of the sovereignty &amp; Independence of the United States.

THE prefident of the united ftates, by my own mouth, and by a written  
  
ipeech, figned by my own hand, and fealed with the feal of the united  
flutes, fpeak to the Seneca nation, and defire their attention, that they would  
keep this fpeech in remembrance of the friendfhip of the united ftates.  
  
I have received your fpeech with fatisfaétion, as a proof of your confidence  
in the juftice of the united ftates: and I have attentively examined the feveral  
obje&amp;s which you have laid before me, whether delivered by your chiefs at Ti-  
oga point, in the laft month, to col. Pickering, or laid before me in the prefent  
month by Corn Plant and other Seneca chiefs, now in Philadelphia.  
  
In the firfi place, I obferve to you, and I requeft it may fink deep into your  
minds, that it is my defire, and the defire of the united flates, that all the mife-  
ries of the late war fhould be forgotten, and buried forever. That, in future,  
the united fates and the fix nations fhould be truly brothers, promoting  
each others’ profperity by aéts of mutual friendthip and juftice.  
  
lam not uninformed that the fix nations have been led inte fome difficulties  
with refpeé to the fale of their lands, fince the perce. But I muft inform you  
that thefe evils arofe before the general government of the united flates was  
eftablithed, when the feparate fhates, and individuals under their authority, un-  
dertock to treat with the Indiaw tribes, vefpe@ting the (ale of their lands.  
  
But the cafe is now entirely altered. The general government only, has  
the power to treat with the Indian nations: and any treaty_formed and held  
without its authority, will not be-binding.  
  
Here then is the fecurity for the remainder of your lands. No ftate or perfon  
can purchafe your lands, unlefs at fome public treaty held under the authority  
of the united ftates. The general government will never confent to your being  
defrauded: but it will prote&amp; you in all your rights.  
  
Hear well, and let it be heard by every perfon in your nation, that the prefi-  
dent of the united ftates declares, that the general government confiders itfelf  
bound to prote&amp; you in all the lands fecured you by the treaty at fort Stanwix,  
the 2adday of Oftober 1784, except fuch part as you may fince have faidy  
fold to perions properly autho ifed, to parchafe of you,

Prefdent&#x27;s reply to Corn Plant, @&amp;c. Sy  
  
  
  
  
Part ry  
  
You complain that J. L. and O. P. have obtained your lands, affitted by mr.  
§. of Niagara, and that they have not complied with their agreement.  
  
It appears, upon enquiry of the governor of New York, that J. L. was not  
legally authorifed to treat with you; and that every thing he did with you,  
has been declared null and veid, fo that you may reft eafy on that account.  
  
But it does not appear from any proofs, yet in the peffeffion of government,  
that O. P. has delrauded you. If, however, yeu fhould have any jult caufe of  
complaint againft him, and can make fatisfaétory proof thereof, the federal  
courts will be open to you for redrefs, as to all other perfons.  
  
But your great objeét feems to be, the fecurity of your remaining lands;  
and I have therefore upon this point meant to be fufficiently ftrong and clear.  
  
That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands. That you poffefs the  
right to fell, and the right of refufing to fell your lands; that therefore the fale  
ef your lands, in future, will depend entirely on yourfelves.  
  
But that when you may find it for your intereft to fell any part of your  
lands, the united flates muft be prefent by their agent, and will be your fecue  
rity, that you fhall not be defrauded in the bargain you may make.  
  
It will, however, be important, before you make any further fale of your  
Jand, that you fhould determine among’ yourfelves, who are the perfons among  
you, that fhall give fuch conveyances thereof, as fhall be binding upon your na«  
tion, and forever preclude all difputes relative to the validity of the fale,  
  
That, befides the before mentioned fecurity for your land, you will perceive,  
by the laws of congrefs for regulating trade and intercourfe with the Indian  
tribes, the fatherly care the united ftates intend to take of the Indians. For the  
particular meaning of this law, I refer you to the explanations given thereof,  
by col. Pickering, at Tioga, which, with the laws, are herewith delivered to  
you.  
  
You have faid in your fpeech, that the game is going away from among  
you, and that you thought it the defign of the Great Spirit, that you till the  
ground; but before you {peak upon this fubje&amp;i, you want to know, whether  
the united ftates meant to leave you any land to till.  
  
ou now know, that a!l the lands fecured to you by the treaty of fort Stanwix,  
excepting fuch parts as you may once have fairly fold, are yours ; and that only  
your own a&amp;s can convey them away. Speak, therefore, your withes on the  
fubje&amp; of tilling the ground, the wnited ftates will be happy to afford you  
every afliftance in the only bufinefs, which will add to your numbers and hap-  
pinefs.  
  
The murders, which have been committed upon fome of your people by the  
bad white men, I fincerely lament and reprobate: and I earneftly hope, that  
the real murderers will be fecured and punifhed as they deferve. This bufinefs  
has been fufficiently explsined to you here by the governor of Pennfylvania, and  
by col. Pickering, in behalf of the united ftates, at Tioga.  
  
The Senecas may be affured, that the rewards offered for apprehending the  
murderers, will be coniinued until they are fecured for trial; and that when  
they fhall be apprehended, they will be tried and punifhed as if they had killed  
white mew.  
  
Having anfwered the moft material parts ef your fpeech, I fhall inform you  
that fome bad Indians, and the outcaft of feveral tribes, who relide at the  
Miami village, have long continued their murders and depredations upon the  
frontiers lying along the Ohio. ‘hat they have not only refuted to liften to my  
voice, inviting thém to peace, but that upon receiving it, they renewed their in-  
curtions and murders, with greater violence than ever, I have therefore been  
obliged to ftrike thofe bad people, in order to make them fer.fible of their mad-  
nefs. 1 fincerely hope that they will hearken to reafen, and not require to be

further chaftifed. The united ftates defire to be friends of the Indians, upon  
terms of juftice and humanity ; but they will not fuffer the depredations of the  
bad Indians to go unpunifhed.  
  
My defire is, that you would caution all the Senecas, and fix nations, to pre.  
vent their rath young men from joining the Miami Indians ; for the united ftates  
cannot diftinguifh the tribes to which bad Indians belong; and every tribe mutt  
take care of their own people. .  
  
The merits of the Corn Plant, and his friendfhip for the united ftates, are well  
known to me, anc fhall not be forgotten: and as a mark of the efteem of the  
united ftatcs, I have direéted the feeretary of war, to make him a prefent of  
two hundred and fifty dollars, either in money or goods, as the Corn Plant  
fhail ltke beft: and be may depend on the future care and kindnefs of the uni-  
ted ftates. And I have alfo dire&amp;ted the fecretary of war to make fuitable prefents  
to the other chiefs prefent in Philadelphia, and alfo that fome further tokens of  
friendthip be forwarded to the other chefs now in their nation.  
  
Remember my words, Senecas; continue to be ftrong in your fiiendhhip for  
the united ftates, as the only rational ground of your future happinefs ; and you  
may rely upon their kindnefs and proteétiop.  
  
An agent fhall foon be appointed to refide in fome place, convenient to the  
Senecas, and fix nations ; he will reprefent the united ftatee—apply to him on all  
occafions,  
  
If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the united ftates,  
mark that man as your enemy ; for he will mean to deceive you, and lead you  
mto trouble. The united ftates wiil be true and faithful to their engagements.  
  
GIVEN under my hand and feal of the united ftates, at Philadelphia,  
this twenty-ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord 1790, and  
in the fifteenth year of the fovereignty and independence of the united
