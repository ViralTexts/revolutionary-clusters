Paris Aug. 19. 1785.  
  
I received by Mr. Mazzei your letter of April 20. I am much mortified to hear that you have lost so much time, and that when you arrived in Williamsburgh you were not at all advanced from what you were when you left Monticello. Time now begins to be precious to you. Every day you lose, will retard a day your entrance on that public stage whereon you may begin to be useful to yourself. However the way to repair the loss is to improve the future time. I trust that with your dispositions even the acquisition of science is a pleasing employment. I can assure you that the possession of it is what (next to an honest heart) will above all things render you dear to your friends, and give you fame and promotion in your own country. When your mind shall be well improved with science, nothing will be necessary to place you in the highest points of view but to pursue the interests of your country, the interests of your friends, and your own interests also with the  purest integrity, the most chaste honour. The defect of these virtues can never be made up by all the other acquirements of body and mind. Make these then your first object. Give up money, give up fame, give up science, give the earth itself and all it contains rather than do an immoral act. And never suppose that in any possible situation or under any circumstances that it is best for you to do a dishonourable thing however slightly so it may appear to you. Whenever you are to do a thing tho’ it can never be known but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act were all the world looking at you, and act accordingly. Encourage all your virtuous dispositions, and exercise them whenever an opportunity arises, being assured that they will gain strength by exercise as a limb of the body does, and that exercise will make them habitual. From the practice of the purest virtue you may be assured you will derive the most sublime comforts in every moment of life and in the moment of death. If ever you find yourself environed with difficulties and perplexing circumstances, out of which you are at a loss how to extricate yourself, do what is right, and be assured that that will extricate you the best out of the worst situations. Tho’ you cannot see when you fetch one step, what will be the next, yet follow truth, justice, and plain-dealing, and never fear their leading you out of the labyrinth in the easiest manner possible. The knot which you thought a Gordian one will untie itself before you. Nothing is so mistaken as the supposition that a person is to extricate himself from a difficulty, by intrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice. This increases the difficulties tenfold, and those who pursue these methods, get themselves so involved at length that they can turn no way but their infamy becomes more exposed. It is of great importance to set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an untruth. There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible and he who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual, he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world’s beleiving him. This falshood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all it’s good dispositions.  
An honest heart being the first blessing, a knowing head is the second. It is time for you now to begin to be choice in your reading, to begin to pursue a regular course in it and not to suffer yourself to be turned to the right or left by reading any thing out of that  course. I have long ago digested a plan for you, suited to the circumstances in which you will be placed. This I will detail to you from time to time as you advance. For the present I advise you to begin a course of antient history, reading every thing in the original and not in translations. First read Goldsmith’s history of Greece. This will give you a digested view of that feild. Then take up antient history in the detail, reading the following books in the following order. Herodotus. Thucydides. Xenophontis hellenica. Xenophontis Anabasis. Quintus Curtius. Justin. This shall form the first stage of your historical reading, and is all I need mention to you now. The next will be of Roman history. From that we will come down to Modern history. In Greek and Latin poetry, you have read or will read at school Virgil, Terence, Horace, Anacreon, Theocritus, Homer. Read also Milton’s paradise lost, Ossian, Pope’s works, Swift’s works in order to form your style in your own language. In morality read Epictetus, Xenophontis memorabilia, Plato’s Socratic dialogues, Cicero’s philosophies. In order to assure a certain progress in this reading, consider what hours you have free from the school and the exercises of the school. Give about two of them every day to exercise; for health must not be sacrificed to learning. A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives a moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprize, and independance to the mind. Games played with the ball and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be the constant companion of your walks. Never think of taking a book with you. The object of walking is to relax the mind. You should therefore not permit yourself even to think while you walk. But divert your attention by the objects surrounding you. Walking is the best possible exercise. Habituate yourself to walk very far. The Europeans value themselves on having subdued the horse to the uses of man. But I doubt whether we have not lost more than we have gained by the use of this animal. No one has occasioned so much the degeneracy of the human body. An Indian goes on foot nearly as far in a day, for a long journey, as an enfeebled white does on his horse, and he will tire the best horses. There is no habit you will value so much as that of walking far without fatigue. I would advise you to take your exercise in the afternoon. Not because it is the best time for exercise for certainly it is not: but because it is the best time to spare from your studies; and habit will soon  reconcile it to health, and render it nearly as useful as if you gave to that the more precious hours of the day. A little walk of half an hour in the morning when you first rise is adviseable also. It shakes off sleep, and produces other good effects in the animal œconomy. Rise at a fixed and an early hour, and go to bed at a fixed and early hour also. Sitting up late at night is injurious to the health, and not useful to the mind.—Having ascribed proper hours to exercise, divide what remain (I mean of your vacant hours) into three portions. Give the principal to history, the other two, which should be shorter, to Philosophy and Poetry. Write me once every month or two and let me know the progress you make. Tell me in what manner you employ every hour in the day. The plan I have proposed for you is adapted to your present situation only. When that is changed, I shall propose a corresponding change of plan. I have

y. You are now I expect learning French. You must push this: because the books which will be put into your hands when you advance into Mathematics, Natural philosophy, Natural history, &amp;c. will be mostly French, these sciences being better treated by the French than the English writers. Our future connection with Spain renders that the most necessary of the modern languages, after the French. When you become a public man you may have occasion for it, and the circumstance of your possessing that language may give you a preference over other candidates. I have nothing further to add for the present, than to husband well your time, cherish your instructors, strive to make every body your friend, &amp; be assured that nothing will be so pleasing, as your success, to Dear Peter yours affectionately,

Paris, Aug. 19, 1785.  
Dear Peter—I received by M. Marrie your  
letter of April 20&#x27;th. 1 am much mortified to  
hear that you have lost so much time, and that  
when arrived at Williamsburg you were not at  
all advanced from what you were when you left  
Monticello. Time now begins to be precious  
to you. Every day you lose, retards a day,  
your entrance on that public stage whereon you  
mav begin to be useful to yours*’if. However,  
the way to repair the loss, is to improve the fu­  
ture time. I trust that with your dispositions,  
the acquisition of science is a pleasing employ­  
ment. I can assure you that the possession of  
it is what (next to an honest heart) will above  
all tilings render you dear to your friends, and  
give you fame and promotion in.yourowu coun­  
try. When your mind shall be well improved  
with science, nothing will be necessary to place  
you in the highest point of v iew, (&#x27;ut to pursue  
the interests of your country, of your friends,  
and yourself, with the purest integrity, the most’  
chaste honor. The defect of these virtues, can  
never be made up, by all the other acquirements  
of body and mind. Make these then your first  
objects. Give up money, give up fame, give  
up science, give the earth and all it retains ra­  
ther than do an immoral act. And never sup­  
pose, that in any possible situation or under  
any circumstances, that it is best for you  
to do a dishonorable thing, however slightly it i  
may appear to you. Whenever you are about]  
to do any thing, though it can never be known  
but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act,  
were the whole world looking at you, and act  
accordingly. Encourage all your virtuous dis  
  
positions, ana exercise them wnenever an op­  
portunity arises, being assured that they will  
gain strength by exercise, as a limb of the bo­  
dy does, and that exercise will render them ha­  
! bitual. From ihc practice of the purest virtue,  
j you may be assured you will derive the most  
I sublime comforts in every moment of life and  
in the moment of death. If ever you find your­  
self environed with difficulties and perplexing  
circumstances, out of which you are at a loss  
how to extricate yourself, do what is right,and  
be assured that that will extricate you the best,  
out of the worst situations. Although you cannot  
see, when you lake one step what will be the  
next, yet go on, follow truth, justice, ar.d plain  
dealing, and never fear their leading you out  
of the labyrinth, the easiest manner possible —  
fhe knot which you thought Gordian, will un­  
tie itself before you. Nothing is so mistaken  
as the supposition that a person is to extricate  
himself from a difficulty by intrigue, by dissi­  
mulation, by an tin&#x27;rulh, by an injustice. This  
increases the difficulties ten fold, and they who  
pursue these methods get themselves so involv­  
ed at length that they can turn no way but their  
infamy becomes more exposed It is of great  
importance, to set a resolution, not to be shak­  
en, never to tell an untruth. There is no vice  
so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible; and he  
who permits himself to tell a lie once, will find  
it easier a second and third lime. At length,  
it becomes habitual: he tells lies without attend­  
ing to them, and truths without ihe world be­  
lieving him. I bis falsehood of the tongue  
leads to that of the heart, and in time, depraves  
all its good dispositions.  
An honest heart being the first blessing, a  
knowing head it the second. It is time for you  
now to begin to be choice in your reading; to  
pursue a regular course in it, and not to suffer  
yourself to be turned to the right or the left, by  
reading any thing out of that course. I have  
long ago digested a plan for you, suited to the  
circumstances in which you will be placed.—  
This I will detail to you from time to time, as  
you advance. For the present, I advise you to  
begin a course of antient history^ leading every  
thing ip. the original and not in translations.—  
First, read Goldsmith&#x27;s History of Greece.—  
This will give you a digested view of that field.  
Then take it up in the detail, reading the fol­  
lowing books in the following order. Herodo­  
tus, Thucidydes, Zenophontis llellenica, Zeno­  
  
* * I . I  
nhontis Analyses, or Quintiu* Curtius,6rboth,  
Diodorus Sicuius. This shall form the first  
stage of your historical reading. The next will  
be Roman History. Sallust, Caesar, Cicero&#x27;s  
Epistles, Suetonius, Tacitus and Gibbon. From  
that, we will come down to Modern Histo­  
ry. In Greek and Latin poetry, you have read,  
or will read at school, Virgil, Horace, Terence,  
Anacreon, Homer, Euripides, and Sophocles.  
Read also Milton’s Paradise Lost, Shakspeare,  
Ossian, Pope, and Swift, to form your style in  
your own language. In Morality, read Epic­  
tetus Zenophontis Memorablia, Antonius, and  
Seneca, of the Antients In order to ensure a  
certain progress in this reading, consider what  
hours you have free from the school and the ex­  
ercises of the school. Give about two of them  
every day to exercise—for health must not be  
I sacrificed to learning. A strong body makes  
| the mind strong. As to the species of exercise,  
I advice the gun. While this gives a moderate  
exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enter­  
prise, and independence to the mind. Games  
played with the ball, and others of that nature,  
are too violent for the body, and stamp no  
character on the mind. Let your gun, there­  
fore, be the constant companion of your walks;  
never think of taking a hook with you. The  
! object of walking is to relax the mind;  
; you should therefore not permit yourself even  
&#x27; to think, while walking, but divert your at­  
| tention by the objects surrounding you. Walk­  
1 ingisthe best possible exercise Habituate your­  
! self to walking far. The Europeans value them­  
selves on having subdued the horse to the uses of  
man, but doubt I whether we have not lost more  
| than we have gained by the use of this animal.  
I No one has occasioned so much the degenera­  
cy of the human body. An Indian goes on foot  
nearly as far in a day for a long journey, as an  
enfeebled while does on his horse, and he will  
tire the best horse. There is no habit you will  
value so much, as that of walking far without  
fatigue. I would advise you to take your exer­  
cise in the afternoon—not that it is the best time  
for exercise, for certainly it is not, hut because  
  
it is the best time to he spared lrotn your stu­  
dies; and habit will soon reconcile it to health,  
and render it nearly as useful as if you gave to  
that the more precious hours of the day. A lit­  
tle walk in the morning of about half an hour,  
when you first rise, is advisable also. It shakes  
ofT sleep, and produces other good effects in the  
animal economy. Rise at a fixed and early hour,  
and go to bed at a fixed hour also: Sitting up  
late at night is injurious to the health and not  
useful to the mind. Having ascribed proper  
hours to exercise, divide what remains, (I mean  
of your vacant hours) into three portions. Give  
the principal to history; the other two, which  
should be shorter, to philosophy and poetry.  
Write to me once every month or so, and let  
me know the progress you make. Tell me in  
what manner you employ every hour in the day.  
The plan I have proposed to you, is adapted to  
your present situation only; w hen that is chan­  
ged, I shall propose a corresponding change of  
plan. You arc now, I expect, learning French.  
You must push this, because the hooks which  
will he put into your hands, when you advance  
into mathematics and natural philosophy, will  
be mostly French—these sciences being supe­  
riorly treated in that language. Our future con­  
nexions with Spain render that the most neces­  
sary of the modern languages, after the French.  
When you become a public man, you may have  
occasion for it, and the circumstance of your  
possessing that language, may give you a pre­  
ference over other candidates.  
I have nothing further to add for the present,  
than to husband well your time. Cherish your  
instructor*, strive to make every body your  
friend; and he assured, that nothing will be so  
pleasing as your success, to  
Dear Peter,  
Your affectionate uncle.

“ When your mind shall bo well inform­  
ed with science, nothing will be necessary  
to p&#x27;ace you in the highest point of view,  
but to pursue the interests of your country,  
of your friends, and yourself, with the  
purest integrity, the most chaste honour.  
The defect of these virtues can never be  
made up, by all the acquirements of body  
and mind. Make these, then, your first  
object. Give up money, give up fame,  
give up science, give up the earth and all  
it contains, rather than do an immoral  
act. And never suppose, that in any  
possible situation, or under any circum­  
stances, that it is best for you to do a dis­  
honourable thing, however slightly it may  
appear to you. Whenever you are about  
to do any thing, though it can never be  
known but to yourself, ask yourself how  
  
you would act were the whole world look­  
ing at you, and act accordingly. Encour­  
age all your virtuous dispositions and ex­  
ercise them whenever an opportunity  
arises, being assured that they will gain  
strength by exercise, as a limb of the body  
does, and that exercise will render them  
habitual. From the practice of the purest  
virtue, you may be assured you will derive  
the mqst sublime comforts, in every mo­  
ment of life, and in the moment of death.  
If ever you find yourself environed with  
difficulties and perplexing circumstances,  
out of which you are at a loss how to ex­  
tricate yourself, do what is right, and be  
assured that it will extricate you the best;  
out of the worst situations. Although  
you cannot see, when you take one step,  
what will be the next, yet go on ; follow  
truth, justice and plain dealing, and never  
fear their leading you out of the labyrinth  
the easiest manner possible. The knot  
which you thought Gordian, will untie  
itself before you. Nothing is so mistaken  
as the supposition that a person is to extri­  
cate himself from a difficulty by intrigue,  
by dissimulation, by an untruth, by an  
injustice. This increases the difficulty  
tenfold; and those who pursue these  
methods, get themselves so involved, at  
length, that they can turn no way but  
their infamy becomes more and more ex­  
posed. It is of no great importance to  
set a resolution not to be shaken, never to  
tell an untruth. There is no vice so  
mean, so pitiful, so contemptible ; and he  
who permits himself to tell a lie once, will  
find it easier a second and third time.—  
At length it becomes habitual ; he tells  
lies without attending to them. This  
falsehood of the tongue leads to that of  
the heart, and in time depraves all its good  
dispositions.”

** Time now begins to be precious to  
you. Every day you lose will retard a  
day your entrance on that public stage  
whereon you may begin to be useful to  
yourself. However, the way to repair  
the loss is to improve the future time. 1  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
trust that with your dispositions, even  
the acquisition of science is a pleasing  
employment. I can assure you that the  
possession of it is what (next to an ho-  
nest heart) will above all things render  
you dear to your friends, and give you  
fame and promotion in your own country.  
When your mind shall be well improved  
with science, nothiug will be necessary  
to place you in the highest points of  
view, but to pursue the iuterests of your  
country, the interests of your friends,  
and your own interests also, with the  
purest integrity, the most chaste honour.  
The detect of these virtues can vever be  
made up by all the other acquirements  
of body and mind. Make these then  
your first object. Give up money, give  
up fame, give up science, give the earth  
itself and all it contains, :ather than do  
an immoral act. And never suppose,  
that iv any possible situation, or under  
auy circumstances, it is best for you to  
do a dishonourable thing, however slight-  
ly so it may appear to you. Whenever  
you are to do a thing, though it can  
never be known but to yourself, ask  
yoursclf how you would act were all the  
world looking at you, and act accord-  
ingly. Encourage all your virtuous dis-  
positions, and exercise them whenever  
an Opportunity arises; being assured  
that they will gain strength by exercise,  
as a limb of the body does, and that ex-  
ercise will make them habitual. From  
the practice of the purest virtue you may  
be assured you will derive the most sub-  
lime comforts in every momeut of life,  
and in the moment of death. If ever  
you find yourself environed with difficul-  
ties and perplexing circumstances out of  
which you are at a loss how to extricate  
yourself, dv what is right, and be as-  
sured that that will extricate you the  
best out of the worst situations. Though  
you cannot see when you take one step  
what will be the next, yet follow truth,  
justice, and plain dealing, and never fear

untie itself before you. Nothing is so

on:having subdued&#x27; the horse to our use;

foot nearly as far in  
a.day.as:an:enfeebled White does &#x27;on&#x27;his  
horse, and i?e will tire the best horse.  
ýA little walk of half an hour in the

exercise. Habituate yourself to walk  
very far. We value ourselves on having  
subdued tho horse to our use, but doubts  
have boen expressed as to whether we  
have not lost more than we have gained  
by it. No one thing has occasioned so  
much degeneracy of the human body. An  
Indian goes on foot nearly as far in a  
day as an enfeebled white does on his  
horse, and he will tire the best horse.  
A little walk of half an hour in the  
morning, when you first rise, is  
advisable. It shakes off sleep, and  
produces other good oft&#x27;oots in the  
animal economy. Wit is brushwood
