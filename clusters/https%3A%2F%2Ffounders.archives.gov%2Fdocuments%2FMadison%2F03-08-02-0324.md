[16 November 1814]  
  
The two Houses of the National Legislature having, by a joint Resolution expressed their desire, that in the present time of public calamity and war, a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States as a day of Public Humiliation and Fasting, and of Prayer to Almighty God, for the safety and welfare of these States, his blessing on their arms, and a speedy restoration of peace: I have deemed it proper, by this Proclamation to recommend that Thursday the twelfth of January next be set apart as a day on which all may have an opportunity of voluntarily offering, at the same time, in their respective religious assemblies, their humble adoration to the Great Sovereign of the Universe, of confessing their sins and transgressions, and of strengthening their vows of repentance and amendment. They will be invited by the same solemn occasion to call to mind the distinguished favors conferred on the American people, in the general health which has been enjoyed, in the abundant fruits of the season; in the progress of the arts, instrumental to their comfort, their prosperity, and their security; and in the victories which have so powerfully contributed to the defence and protection of our Country; a devout thankfulness for all which ought to be mingled with their supplications to the Beneficent Parent of the human race, that He would be graciously pleased to pardon all their offences against Him; to support and animate them in the discharge of their respective duties; to continue to them the precious advantages flowing from political Institutions so auspicious to their safety against dangers from abroad, to their tranquility at home, and to their liberties, civil and religious; and that He would in a special manner, preside over the nation, in its public Councils and constituted authorities, giving wisdom to its measures and success to its arms, in maintaining its rights, and in overcoming all hostile designs and attempts against it; and finally, that by inspiring the Enemy with dispositions  
  
favorable to a just and reasonable peace, its blessings may be speedily and happily restored.  
Given at the City of Washington, the sixteenth day of November, one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States the thirty eighth.

fulness for all which ought to be mingled  
with their supplications to the beneficient  
parent of the human race, that he would  
be graciously pleased to pardon all their  
offences against Him; to support and

The two Houses of the National Legislature having,  
by a joint resolution, expressed their desire, that in the  
present time of public calamity and war, a day may be  
recommended to be observed by the people of the U. S.  
as a day of Public Humiliation and Fasting and of  
Prayer to Almighty God, for the safety and welfare of  
| these States, His blessing on their arms, and a speedy  
restoration of peace?I have deemed it proper, by this  
proclamation, to recommend that Thursday, the twelfth  
of January next, beset apart as a day on which all may  
have an opportunity of voluntarily offering, at the same  
time, in their respective religious assemblies, their bum­  
ble adorations to the Great Sovereign of the Universe,  
of confessing their sins and transgressions, and of  
strengthening their vows of repentance and amend­  
ment. They will be invited by the same solemn oc­  
casion to call to mind the distinguished favors con­  
ferred on the American People, in the general  
health which has been enjoyed; in the abundant  
fruits of the season; in the progress of the arts,  
instrumental to their comfort, their prosperity and  
their security: and in the victories which have so pow­  
erfully contributed to the defence and protection of  
our country; a devout thankfulness for all which  
ought to be mingled with their supplications to the be­  
neficent Parent of the human race, that he would be  
graciously pleased to pardon all their offences against  
Him; to support and animate them in the discbarge j  
  
of their respective duties; to continue to them the pre­  
cious advantages flowing from politicnl institution! so  
auspicious to their safety against dangers from abroad,  
to their tranquility at home, and to their l.berlies, ci­  
vil and religious; and that He would, in a special man­  
ner, preside over the nation, in iu public council* and  
constituted authorities, giving wisdom to its measures  
and success to its arms, in maintaining its rights, and  
in overcoming all hostile designs and attempts against  
it; and finally, that by inspiring the enemy with dis­  
positions favorable to a just and reasonable peace, iu  
blessings may be speedily and happilv restored.  
Given under my hand, at the Cilv of Washington,  
the sixteenth day of November, one thousand eight  
hundred and fourteen, and of the Independence of the  
United States, the thirty-eighth.
