Miscellany. For The Port Folio. Letters From An American, Resident Abroad, On Various Topics of Foreign Literature.  
  
6 June 1801—25 July 1801  
  
No. I.28th March 1801Publication Date 6 June 1801Dear Sir,I send you by this opportunity a French pamphlet, entitled, “Bacon As He Is; or, Denunciation of a French Translation of his Works, published at Dijon, by M. Ant. La Salle—By I. A. De Luc, Reader to the Queen of Great-Britain; Fellow of the Royal Societies, of London and Dublin; Member of the Society of Naturalists, at Berlin; of that of Mineralogy, at Jena; and of several others: Professor of Philosophy and Geology, at Göttingen.”The title of this little work will, perhaps, strike you as somewhat curious; and, upon reading it, you will find its contents still more so.—It has been sufficiently proved to the world, that the authors of the French Encyclopædia were the founders of a political and anti-religious sect, the object of which has been, to overthrow the Christian faith, and all the ancient establishments of government, in Europe. This undertaking, it is well known, they accomplished in France, where they seated themselves, at least, for a time, upon the ruins of the altar and throne they had destroyed. Their design of spreading, by the united influence of the sword and the pen, their doctrines and their practices over all the world, has, according to the various changes in their prospects of success, been proclaimed, and denied, with a voice equally loud, and in terms equally positive.—This pamphlet of Mr. De Luc, not only furnishes abundant proof, that such was very recently, if it be not still, the design of the French government; but unfolds the artifices, which they were not ashamed to use in the pursuit of their object.“The authors of the Encyclopædia,” Mr. De Luc observes, “though very far form intending to follow the footsteps of lord Bacon, professed to be his disciples, and extolled him to the skies; but their object only was, to withdraw the eyes of the public from him, and fix them upon themselves, for the purpose of establishing principles in diametrical opposition to his.”But this artifice having been discovered, and made known to the public, the sect of Encyclopædians, encouraged by the success of the system followed by their founders, enlarged their views, and adopted a much bolder plan of operations. Conceiving it necessary, still, to retain Bacon, as their apparent leader, they hoped to escape the reproach, which their predecessors had incurred, of misrepresenting him to persons, unable to consult his original works, by publishing a French translation of his works. This is the translation, of which several volumes have already appeared, and which Mr. De Luc denounces.There is an appearance of frankness and candour in this measure, behind which one would not suspect to find lurking, forgery and imposture. Under colour of a translation, to palm upon the public, in the name of a national government, principles of philosophy, of theology, of morals, and of politics, absolutely contrary to those of the author translated, is a stratagem, which an honest mind would be ashamed to imagine as possible. That it has been done, Mr De Luc not only furnishes decisive proof, but he opens to the most careless observer, the manner, in which it has been done.That the pretended translation was published with the sanction, and in some sort made, by order of the French government, is asserted by the editor himself. And as the object was, to interpret the works of the great Bacon, for those French citizens who had not leisure to study him, “it became our duty,” adds the translator, “to begin, by identifying ourselves, with him, in order to be the more fully penetrated with his spirit.”Under the mask of this identification, the translator has likewise assumed the voice of Bacon; and spreads over fifty-four pages of the general preface, a fictitious soliloquy of that great philosopher, in which he makes him give an account of the views and designs with which he composed his works. By the means of this theatrical machine, you will not be surprised to find, lord chancellor Bacon talking the language of a determined French jacobin; to hear him rant in terms like these—“Before it will be expedient to denounce tyrants, and offer liberty to mankind, or force them by a holy violence to accept it, we much explain to them with clearness and precision, what that liberty, offered them with the sword or the book in the hand, is, lest they should confound it with licentiousness, which is directly the opposite. I will enable them to say for themselves, what I dare not publicly tell them, for their attention will first turn itself towards that which most interests them; that is, their rights. When once rendered capable of seeking these themselves, they will seek, and, of curse, will find them; they will one day find, and the next, learn to defend them.“Thus, without attacking directly, either the throne of the altar, which, at this day, lean upon the other, and resting both, upon the three-fold basis of long ignorance, long terror, and long habit, seems not to be shaken, I will shew respect to both, in words, while, at the same time, I will undermine both, by my principles; for, the surest way to kill, at one stroke, royalty and priesthood, without butchering a single individual, is, to endeavour, by enlightening mankind, to render kings, and priests, the flatterers and accomplices, when they despair of becoming the masters of kings, forever useless.”But, in order to convert Bacon into a professor of atheism and anarchy, it was not sufficient to take his name, and then make an avowal of cowardice and hypocrisy. It is evident, from all his writings, that he never made the comparative merit of the usual political forms of government, a subject of his meditations. His deep and sincere conviction of the truth of christianity, is manifested, not only in frequent passages, scattered over all his works, but in several distinct and entire treatises. Mr. De Luc shows us how the pretended translator has got over these difficulties. The treatises, by suppression; and the single passages, by imputing them to simulation, or by ridiculing them in a comment. The translation professes to be a complete collection; but, in the specific list afterwards given, several works upon religious subjects, mentioned by Mr. De Luc, and among the rest, a formal, methodical, and detailed confession of faith, are omitted.The numerous passages, where the translator disfigures the meaning of his author, by misconstruction, or attacks it with ridicule, I need not particularly notice; but, there is one more material than all the rest, because it discovers the translator’s real creed, and, at the same time, the mode of reasoning employed by a man, who boasts of having identified himself with Bacon.One of the chancellor’s fundamental principles, which, says Mr. De Luc, is in various forms continually recurring through all his works, is, that the studies of natural philosophy, and of religion, should be distinctly pursued, and never blended with each other; that the book of nature is the source of all physical, as the book of revelation is that of all theological knowledge; that it is absurd to look into the one, for proofs of what is only to be found in the other; and that, to attempt, for instance, to raise a system of natural philosophy, upon the book of Genesis, or that of Job, is to seek for the dead among the living.—The neglect of this maxim, he complains, has been productive of much evil, and is chargeable upon many of the Greek philosophers, among others. At a passage, where he particularly censures Plato, for blending theology with his natural philosophy, the translator has annex a note to this effect—“If it be true, that the main-spring of this world be God, the theory of springs being a part of mechanics, and mechanics a part of physics, we are forced to mingle theology with philosophy. It is because the natural philosophers always consider the motion of this world as produced, and not as to be produced, that they are not sufficiently sensible of this truth. It is, therefore, because their theory of motive powers is incomplete, that, in their general systems of physics, they say nothing of God, or of his equivalents.”Here, Mr. De Luc very justly remarks, plain, downright, brazen-faced, and marble-hearted, atheism, is introduced in formal terms.—But, observe the manner of introducing it—First, by an hypothetical assertion, that God is the main-spring of this world; an idea, to which many a reader might assent, as understanding the word main-spring in a metaphorical sense. Then, by a second assertion, that the theory of springs is a part of mechanics, where the word spring could only be taken literally. And, finally, by a conclusion drawn from this logical quibble—that God is a mechanical power. It is exactly the same fallacy of reasoning, which Dr. Johnson once ridiculed, as a fallacy of wit, in these ludicrous lines:“If the man who turnips cries,Cry not when his father dies,‘Tis a sign that he had ratherHave a turnip than his father.”Mr. De Luc in this, and various other parts of the pamphlet, shews not only the real opposition between the principles of lord Bacon, and those of his translator, but likewise the inconsistency of the translator, with himself. At the same time, he gives us, from the translator’s own words, the means of judging him, and of reconciling all his apparent inconsistencies, not with each other, but with the views, which led to this metamorphosis of lord Bacon, and with the spirit which presided, at its accomplishment.Thus, throughout the whole soliloquy put into the mouth of Bacon, the translator appears desirous to be thought a friend and supporter of deism, in religion, and of the christian system, in morality. How consistent the first part of these opinions is, with this profession of atheism, we have seen. The same self-contradiction appears in different passages, upon moral topics. Thus, in one place, he extols the “true christian religion, as a pure and sublime, a kind and precise law, consisting solely in the love of God and our neighbour, and in actions conformable to this injunction.—This true christianity, (he adds) as exhibited in the development of the sermon from the mount, will last as long as man; since the nature of the human heart, is the soil in which it is planted.”—After reading the atheistical note I have quoted above, what would one imagine the translator means, by his pure and sublime love of God—the love of a mechanical power! the love of a main-spring! His love of our neighbour, irradically planted in the human heart, may, from another passage, be inferred to bear equal marks of purity and sublimity. Bacon argues, that the love of justice is innate in the human heart—upon which, his translator remarks, that if this be true, “it is not, that every individual loves to observe it towards others, but that he wishes others to observe it towards himself; and, if he insists that others should observe it among themselves, it is, that they may likewise be just towards him.”—Thus, as the translator’s deism is simple atheism, so his christian benevolence is exclusive selfishness.The key to all these seeming inconsistencies, may be found in the following sentiments, which the translator imputes to his author:—“It is,” says he, “only by yielding a little to established prejudices, that the truths destined to destroy them, can be insinuated. In order to undeceive mankind, it is necessary to win their confidence, which can only be done, by appearing, at first, to think like them.”—Such are the real moral maxims of the translator, who, under the pretence of identifying himself with Bacon, does precisely the reverse, and identifies Bacon with himself.I need not further pursue this analysis of Mr. De Luc’s pamphlet, which, I am persuaded, you will read with attention and interest: Nor will it escape your observation, that the same system of falsification, which he has thus detected and exposed, with regard to the works of Bacon, is at the same time, pursued by a sect of theologians, with regard to the holy scriptures. This he affirms, and undertakes to prove, in a work not yet published. The writings of Bacon may be considered as the sources of our natural, as the Bible is the great source of our divine learning. If it is a melancholy prospect, to observe the indefatigable industry, the fanatic enthusiasm, and the profound address, with which both the great fountains of human science have been poisoned, it is, at least, a consolatory reflection, that equal zeal and perseverance, combined with still greater ability, are occupied, to furnish us with antidotes which may neutralize the infectious venom, and enable us, still, to drink of the uncorrupted waters of life.I am, &amp;c.

s from the German fabulist, Gellert. I shall, perhaps, occasionally, send you a few more, with the intention of giving you some idea of his character and merit, as a writer of fables. This cannot, indeed, be done in any other, than a very imperfect manner, to those, who do not understand his own language. There is a mixture of archness and simplicity in this narrative, of keen satire and honest good nature in his reflections, which might be rendered in another tongue. But there are colloquial forms of speech, and peculiar modes of expression, which it is hardly possible to transfer from one language to another, and much of the excellence of fable-writing proceeds from the choice and use of these appropriate idioms. Of the defects, therefore, which you will discover in the versions from Gellert, which you receive from me, impute some to the essential infirmities of translation, and some to those of the translator; and I think you will then readily conceive, that Gellert is considered as one of the great reformers of his language, and refiners of the taste of his nation; in short, as a fabulist, second only to La Fontaine.He was born at Hänichen, in Saxony, July 4, 1715, and died at Leipzig, (where he had, for many years, been a professor at the university) December 18, 1769. Exactly nine years before that event, the scene and dialogue took place, of which, as described by himself, I shall now give you an account.You very well know the aversion, which Frederick the second affected, through the whole course of his life, against the German language, its literature, and its literary men. You likewise know, that during the principal part of the seven years war, he was in possession of the city of Leipzig, and of almost all the electorate of Saxony. At the close of the year 1760, being at winter-quarters there, he sent his adjutant, Guichard, the celebrated Quintus Icilius, to professor Gellert, with an invitation to come to him. Gellert accordingly went, and the following dialogue took place between them. I shall only leave out those parts of it, which, relating merely to Gellert’s state of health, or to the politics of the time, containing nothing of amusement or of information. The scene is in the king’s chamber, where he was alone when Gellert entered, and was introduced to him by Quintus Icilius.King. Are you professor Gellert?Gellert. Yes, may it please your majesty.King. The English minister has spoken highly of you to me. Where were you born?Gellert. At Hänichen, near Freyberg.King. Have you not a brother at Freyberg.Gellert. Yes, sir.King. Pray tell me, what is the reason, why we have no good German writers?(This question, addressed to a German writer, did not abound with the politeness for which Frederick was famed; and so thought Quintus, who put in a word here, and said,)“Your majesty has one now in your presence, whom the French themselves have translated, and call the German Fontaine.”King. That is saying a great deal. Have you read La Fontaine?Gellert. Yes, sir, but without imitating him. My manner of writing is my own.King. Very well. That is one; but why have we not more good authors?Gellert. Your majesty has taken a prepossession against the Germans.King. No. I cannot say that.Gellert. At least against the German writers.King. That is true. Why have we no good historians?Gellert. They are not wanting. We have a Mascov, and a Cramer, the continuator of Bossuet.King. How? Is it possible, that a German should have continued Bossuet?Gellert. Yes, and with success. One of your majesty’s most learned professors has said, that the continuation is equal in eloquence, and superior in historical accuracy, to Bossuet himself.King. Did that man understand him?Gellert. The world think so.King. But why does nobody try upon Tacitus? They should make a good translation of him.Gellert. Tacitus is hard to translate. We have bad French translations too of him.King. That is very true.Gellert. And in general, several reasons may be alledged why the Germans have not yet distinguished themselves in all the varieties of good writing. While the arts and sciences flourished among the Greeks, the Romans were engaged in war. Perhaps this is the warlike age of the Germans. Perhaps, too, they have wanted an Augustus, and a Lewis Fourteenth.King. Why, Saxony has had two Augustus’s.Gellert. And we have made in Saxony too, a good beginning.King. How! would you have one Augustus for all Germany?Gellert. Not exactly that; I only wished that every prince, in his own territory, would encourage genius.King. Were you never out of Saxony?Gellert. I was once in Berlin.King. You should travel.Gellert. Sir, I have neither the health nor the means necessary for that.King. Which do you think the best epic post, Homer or Virgil?Gellert. Homer seems to deserve the preference; as being the original.King. But Virgil is much more polish’d.Gellert. We are too far removed from Homer to judge accurately of his language and manners; but I trust in this to Quintilian, who gives Homer the preference.King. But we must not servilely adopt the judgments of the antients, neither.Gellert. Certainly not. I only follow them when, owing to the too great distance, I cannot myself judge.Quintus. The professor has likewise published a collection of German letters.King. So! and, pray have you written against the law-style?Gellert. Oh! yes; may it please your majesty.King. But why don’t they alter it? ‘Tis devilish strange. They bring me whole sheets of which I cannot understand a word.Gellert. If your majesty cannot alter it, I can still less effect the change. I can only advise where you command.King. Cannot you repeat any of your fables by heart?Gellert. I am not sure. My memory is very treacherous.King. Recollect yourself. I will walk about meanwhile. Well! have you got one?Gellert. Yes, sir.A painter of ingenuous heart,Who rather work’d for fame than gold,At Athens once, in days of old,Shew’d, to a critic in his art,A Mars, that he had just design’d,Of which he begg’d him speak his mind.The critic candidly confess’dHe thought it not from failings free;In too much art, the god was dress’d,Not fierce and rough as Mars should be;While each objection that he madeOn specious principles was grounded,The artist equal skill display’d,To prove the censure not well founded;And after having argued long,Still could not think his labour wrong.A foolish coxcomb now came in,Upon the picture cast his eyes,And gazing, with sagacious grin—Gods! what a master-piece! he cries:Behold this foot! what nails are here!You see the god himself appear;How rich his garb! his arms, how fine!Look; how the shield and helmet shine!The painter now, o’erwhelm’d with shame,Turn’d to his friend, with visage sad;You’re right, quoth he, and I to blame,I now confess my picture bad—Then, ere the coxcomb could retire,He threw his war-god in the fire.King. Well—the moral?Gellert. Directly, sir.When critics disapprove your lays,‘Tis a bad omen for your lyre;But when the fools begin to praise,Throw, throw your verses in the fire!King. That’s pretty! very pretty! very nicely turned. I understand all that. But Gottsched brought and read me a translation of the Iphigenia, (of Racine). I had the French Copy in my hands, and yet I could not understand a word of what he read. They brought me here another poet too, one Pietsch—I threw him away.Gellert. May it please your majesty, I throw him away too.King. Well—if I stay here, you must come often to me, and bring your fables with you, and read me some of them.Gellert. I believe I am not a very good reader. I have something of the mountainous, chanting tone.King. Ay! like the Silesians. No matter! you must read me your fables, yourself; else they will lose some of their merit... So, mind, and come again soon.Thus ended the conversation. But the king did not send for him again, and without an express call, Gellert did not chuse to return. After he was gone, Frederick said he was quite a different man from Gotsched. This was another professor at the university; a voluminous and once a fashionable German author; but now only remembered to be despised. Gellert, the kind afterwards said, was the most rational of all the German literati.The writings, upon which Gellert’s hightest reputation is founded, are his fables; which are collected in three books; and are about as many as Gay’s, in number. Besides this, he published

1Dear Sir,As the winter will probably afford me much leisure, I shall continue those pursuits of German literature, which my very slow progress in the language, has hitherto so much obstructed. I am ashamed to say, that although my studies of German, since you left us, have not been interrupted, I have made no advances in the power of speaking, and very few in the facility of reading it. With Lessing and Gellert, and Gesner, and Wieland, I have indeed made myself tolerably familiar, as by frequenting the theatre, I have seen most of the very fashionable dramas of Kotzebue, now the favourite play-wright, not only of Germany, but of England and France; from the former of which, I perceive, he has found his way to America. But the utter impossibility of meeting any opportunity here, to speak the language constantly, for any length of time, makes me despair of ever acquiring it to any considerable degree.The number of books, daily published in Germany, rather augments, than diminishes. There are certainly more volumes published here in one year, than there are of volumes worth reading, in the world. In every department of science and literature, what loads of trash burden the stalls of Leipzig, at the moment of the present fair; but in none, perhaps, so much as in that of metaphysics, and moral philosophy. You will remember, it is not long since I anticipated, that atheism and revolution would soon be preached in Germany, without resorting to that canting gibberish, which many good folks have been kind enough, to take for obscurity. A disciple of Kant, one Fichte, professor of moral philosophy at Jena, has already done it in part. He has written a book, ridiculing the ideas of a future life, and retribution of rewards and punishments, and of a supreme Being, as the dispenser of them. But Mr. Fichte unfolded the mysteries of the sect rather too soon. The work was denounced to the governments of Saxony, Prussia, Hanover, and Brunswick, and was prohibited by them all, except the king of Prussia, who answered, that atheism was too absurd a thing to be believed, however it might be inculcated, and that an author who preached it, could only expose his own folly. Fichte has been removed by the duke of Weimar, from his professorship, and now wanders about Germany, scribbling, and holding himself forth, as the victim of persecution.Here has been made at Berlin, another, but a more cautious and guarded attack, against the religion of the country. A large number of Jews, heads of families, of respectable character, have subscribed, and published a letter to Mr. Teller, provost of the upper consistory (the department of government, which has the superintendance of ecclesiastical affairs), in which they declare, that being convinced, the laws of Moses are no longer binding upon them, as not being adapted to their circumstances at this day, they are willing and ready, to become christians, as far as relates to the moral doctrines of christianity, provided they shall not be required to believe the miraculous part of the christian creed, and above all, the divinity of Jesus Christ; and provided, they may be admitted to enjoy all the rights and privileges enjoyed by the members of the established religion. Their confession of faith would be something less than Socinianism; but approaching nearly to it. They ask Mr. Teller’s advice, upon their plan, and whether he thinks it practicable.He has published his answer, which, besides being, as I hear, not so well written as their letter, has given satisfaction to nobody. He tells them, that they do well to believe as much in christianity, as they can; and that, if they cannot in conscience, believe more, they do well not to profess it; but as to the question, whether their fragment of faith ought to entitle them to share the civil and political privileges, enjoyed exclusively by entire christians, it is not his province, but belongs to the civil authority of the country to decide.Mr. De Luc, a celebrated chemist, and theologian, has published a letter to these Jews, in which he boldly advances to meet them, on the ground which Mr. Teller eludes; he tells them, that, far from scrupling points of christian doctrine, they ought not even to abandon the standard of Moses; that the history of the earth, and its present appearance, are the strongest of all possible testimonies, to the truth of the Mosaic history, and that, if they will only take the pains to become better natural philosophers, they will not be so ready to renounce their faith as Jews.There have been numerous pamphlets more, written and published upon this subject, which has made, as the French term it, a great sensation in the north of Germany. It has even given rise to epigrams, though these are a species of wit, not native to the German soil. I have heard one repeated, the substance of which was,“Why not give credit to the Son,Ye Jews, at usury so clever?—Because there’s nothing to be won,The Father means to live forever.

1Dear Sir,You will remember, that in the year 1793, while the government of the French republic was in the hands of Robespierre, a collection of papers, found among those of Louis the sixteenth, was published, under the title of Politics of all the Cabinets of Europe. The most important of these papers, and that from which the title was given to the whole collection, was a work, written by Mr. Favier, a person employed in Louis the fifteenth’s secret ministry for foreign affairs; and the great object of this work was to prove, from a consideration of the political situation and views of all the European powers, that a great, and essential, a total change in the military, the federal, and the fiscal system of France, was indispensably necessary to restore her preponderance in the scale of nations. It was written in the year 1773, and had been presented to Louis fifteen, a short time before his death; but the editor of the collection justly observes, in the preface to it, that, in these conjectures of Favier, is to be found the germ of every thing that had since happened in France, without excepting the revolution.In the course of the last autumn, was published, at Paris, a volume, upon the state of France at the close of the eighth republican year; written by citizen Hauterive, first clerk in the present French office of foreign affairs. It is a work of considerable ability, written with much elegance of style, and much appearance of argument. As I propose to give an account of it at some length, with my own reflections upon its contents, it was proper to precede the mention of it, by that of Favier’s conjectures, because the objects of Mr. Hauterive’s pamphlet, are evidently the result and the complement of Favier’s system, and without the previous knowledge of this, it is impossible to form an accurate estimate of that. The identity of object, for which they were both calculated, is apparent even from the seeming opposition of their views; for, as the great purpose of Favier was to prove, from the politics of all the cabinets of Europe, the necessity of a revolution in the state of France, that of Hauterive is to show, from the state of France, after that revolution has happened, the necessity of a revolution equally complete in the politics of all the cabinets of Europe. The principal difference between them is, that Favier, writing as he supposed, solely and exclusively for the king of France’s perusal, avows, and professes the final purpose of the change, which he recommends, to be the establishment of a perfect and unrivalled preponderance of France in the affairs of Europe; whereas, Hauterive, addressing himself to sovereigns, who know too well that the consequences to themselves, of a French supremacy would be, always denies, endeavours to conceal, and only betrays the same ultimate design.His work is divided into six chapters, each of which I propose to examine separately, though as briefly as possible, with the intention of stating its argument, and of distinguishing its real motive from its apparent object, and of noticing the errors in point of fact, and of reasoning, into which an unqualified assent to the assertions and opinions of the author might lead.The first chapter treats of the political situation of Europe before the war. Its avowed object is to prove, that “immediately before the commencement of the French revolution, the public law of Europe, existed only in appearance; that the revolution only made its destruction more strikingly evident, and that it is at once the most important duty and the highest interest of the European governments, immediately to concert the means of creating it anew.” The argument is indeed chiefly limited to the demonstration of the fact, and the inference from it is extended into the next chapter.“At the middle of the last century, says Mr. Hauterive, a treaty, containing the fundamental rights, and duties of the greatest part of the continental powers, assigned the place which belonged to each of them in the great political scale of Europe.—This classic and elementary treaty, for so it may be called, might perhaps have founded, for a long series of ages, the public law of the world, had not three events, originating nearly at the same period, come to complicate the general system, with unexpected combinations, which, though at first imperceptible and slow, gradually attacked all the relations consecrated or prepared by the treaty of Westphalia, and have finally, in our days, scandalously burst all the ties which united these relations, and destroyed the foundations of interest, of concord, and of counterpoise, upon which they were established.“These three events are, 1. The formation of a new empire at the north of Europe: 2. The elevation of Prussia to the rank of a first rate power; and 3. The prodigious growth of the colonial and maritime system in the four quarters of the globe.”The deduction of consequences, presented by the author, as having resulted from the introduction of these new materials into the political system of Europe, is ingenious, in many respects just, and highly deserving of the profound meditation of every statesman. But before I proceed to mention the objections, to which some of its details are liable, it may be proper here to observe two things. First, that the peace of Westphalia cannot, and ought not to be considered as the great charter of Europe, containing all the rights and duties of its several nations. And secondly, that the enumeration of events, which have contributed to render the principles and arrangements of that compromise, obsolete and inapplicable, is imperfect. To give a full and fair view of the subject, the author should have taken into his calculation, not merely the rise and progress of the new powers, but likewise the declension and decay of those which were then at their most flourishing period; the house of Austria, Sweden, and above all the spiritual power; including the disposition and habit of contending, and treating, of making war and peace, upon religious questions.The peace of Westphalia was primarily and essentially no more than the termination of a religious civil war in Germany. But, in the course of that war, the political constitution of Germany had intimately connected with it, the worldly interests of the states, which go to its composition, and hence the religious pacification became complicated with the establishment of a balance of power, between the German states. France and Sweden had taken part in the war, as allies of the protestant party, and were therefore principal parties on one side to the peace. The conduct of France was certainly not dictated by her attachment to the religious principles of her allies. her motive was opposition to the house of Austria, and the policy of weakening Germany by establishing a perpetual principle of division in its power, as a source of continual dissentions, for her to settle and determine. The peace of Westphalia can be considered, therefore, only as having established a balance of power in Europe, against the house of Austria. It established none against France. The danger of France’s ambition to the liberties of Europe had not manifested itself, perhaps had not existed before that period; but from that day to this it has been the most imminent danger to which the liberties of Europe have been exposed. Its offensive designs, and the defensive measures employed to defeat them, have been the source of almost all the wars and negociations in Europe, during the century and a half elapsed since the peace of Westphalia.The reason why a secretary in the French department of foreign affairs should hold out the treaty of Westphalia as the fundamental law, the sole source of right, and measure of strength for all the powers of Europe, it is not difficult to discern. He gives us, himself, the reason when he says, that it placed the whole body of the German empire under the indispensable tutelage of France. It placed in the hands of France a counterpoise, more than sufficient against the power of Austria, without providing for the security of Europe against France herself.It is, therefore, true, that before the period of the French revolution, the elements of the system, upon which the peace of Westphalia was formed and supported, were all, or nearly all, dissolved; but not owing entirely or even principally to the three causes, alledged by him. The two great bases of that system were, a religious peace in Germany, and a barrier against Austria. The first has crumbled to dust, because religion is no longer an object of controversy among nations, and the second has dropped into fragments with the gradual decay of the Austrian power.It was important to notice both these circumstances; the exaggerated importance, imputed to the treaty of Westphalia, and the inaccuracy in the statement of causes, which destroyed its efficacy, because they serve as the foundation of Mr. Hauterive’s subsequent theory, and reasoning. He argues, for instance, that the combination, of almost all Europe against France, at the commencement of her revolution, was the necessary consequence, and the most certain proof of the previous annihilation of the public law of Europe, founded upon the peace of Westphalia; thus throwing out of the account, all the causes of the coalition, which arose, not only from the ambition of France, but all those, which sprung from her revolution. Thus, after having maintained to the world, for seven years together, that this was a war for civil liberty and equality, a war of democracy against monarchy, of all nations against all kings, France now comes and tells us, that all that was only springes to catch woodcocks, and the real cause of the war was to restore the balance of power in Europe.In ascribing to the rise and progress of the Russian, British and Prussian powers, the destruction of the public law of Europe, Mr. Hauterive undoubtedly thought he was promoting the political views of France; the other causes, which contributed to produce the result of disarranging the system, were no less important, than those assigned—but they did not suit the author’s purpose, and would have furnished material proofs against his arguments. It was natural that he should omit that.He sought only those causes, which it entered into his plan to represent, in an unfavourable and odious light. He affirms, and with some appearance of solicitude repeats, the declaration, that resentment or animosity has no part in the representation, which he makes of the mischiefs that have accrued to Europe, from the formation and prosperity of these powers; he acknowledges, that neither England, Russia, nor Prussia were bound to the support of a system, which they had no hand in forming; and that they are not to be blamed for following the natural propensity of nations as well as individuals, to better their condition. But the whole drift of his discourse is to prove, that the principal parties to the peace of Westphalia ought to have united in concert for the purpose of preventing the intrusion of Russia into the political system of Europe, of smothering the growth of Prussia, and of ruining the maritime and commercial prosperity of England. This purpose, indeed, he is careful not openly to avow, and he employs no inconsiderable address to conceal it. “The source of the disorder (says he) is not in the events and in the springs which prepared them; but in the improvidence, the inattention, or the heedlessness of the powers, who did nothing to adapt to their position the new circumstances, which those events could not but produce: the source of the disorder is in the undiscerning statesman, who did not see, that in a pre-existing public law, the elements of concert, of federation, and of concurrence, it contains, always supply the states who have common interests to defend, and discernment to perceive them; means enough seasonably  to prevent all growth of power which might untune the harmony of their relations, or to make that growth concur in the maintenance of this harmony, without needing to recur to the violent means of uncertain and ruinous wars.”Here is an alternative, apparently presented, against which no objection can be made, but when the author comes to specify the means, which he thinks adviseable, they are all such as apply only to the first part of the proposition—calculated to crush the growth of all other power, not to seek traces of concert and combination with it.In my next letter I hope to conclude the examination of the first chapter, and in the mean time remain, ever your’s.

1Before I proceed to remark upon the particular causes, alleged by the citizen Hauterive, in his book upon the state of France, at the end of the eighth year, as having disorganized the public law of Europe, it is proper to observe, that one of the great apparent purposes of the work, is to hold out a lure of temptation to the Austrian cabinet. To superficial observation this may appear to indicate a system, contrary to that of Favier, but, it is in truth, perfectly reconcilable with it. Favier’s doctrine was—dissolve the alliance between France and Austria—Let a clear, unequivocal preponderance of France over Austria be established, cost what it may. This has now been accomplished—and from the moment, when it was effected, France changes not her policy, but her object. To secure her final end the more effectually, she thinks it necessary to check, to controul, to diminish, by all possible means, every other European power which, from its extent, might ever threaten to rivalize with her own, and, as a means of success, she now endeavours to engage the co-operation of Austria in this project. Thus, when Mr. Hauterive assumes for granted, that the treaty of Westphalia founded the whole public law of Europe, he might rationally expect that this view of things, whether true or false, would, at least, suit the interests, and flatter the passions of Austria. In his enumeration of causes, which contributed to annihilate that system, he mentions only those, which Austria considers with enmity and resentment, or with fear and jealousy. He proposes measures for crippling the other three great powers, in which Austria will probably feel the strongest stimulus to concur; the real point of his preparatory argument is, that France and Austria had once given the law to Europe; and that it is for their mutual interests, and for the benefit of Europe too, that they should do so again. We shall see in another part of the work, that the author considers the United States, as forming a part of this political system of Europe, and this is the principal consideration upon which I shall bestow so much time upon the examination of his book.We shall, therefore, not be surprised to find Mr. Hauterive, in descending to his particulars, state, that since the introduction of Russia into the European system, the sole principle of her government has been the ambition of unbounded aggrandizement, eastward, at the expense of all her Asiatic neighbours, and westward, at that of Poland and Sweden. This representation has too much truth in it. Russia, like her neighbours, has constantly been too much actuated by the ambition of conquest; and by the continual series of success she has enjoyed since the time of Peter the Great, she has acquired a mass of power, which naturally presents an obstacle to the exercise of legislation for all Europe, by the concert of France and Austria. Thus far she may, indeed, have contributed to disconcert the arrangements made, or prepared by the treaty of Westphalia, but when Mr. Hauterive asserts that the example of Russia, had “awakened cupidity in the breast of all the great powers,” he should, at least, alledge some proof for believing that it had ever been laid asleep. If it ever slept, it was not at least lull’d to repose by the peace of Westphalia, nor had it ever yielded to soporifics in the bosom of France. Here, indeed, we touch upon one of the points in which the author will find it most difficult to obtain belief. It is one of the essential purposes of his book to represent the political conduct of France, as having been, at all times, a perfect model of moderation, and of disinterested generosity. This is a thing, concerning which, for many centuries, the truth has been written in characters of blood, upon the annals of Europe, too distinctly and too notoriously for the diplomatic skill of any French secretary, or under secretary of foreign affairs, to efface or to obscure. To argue against it, would be to charge the reader with too profound an ignorance of history, or with too great weakness of understanding.  I send you the book itself, that you may see I do not slander the author in affirming that such are his assertions; and there are other parts of the book, where he renews it in a manner which may require animadversion. He acknowledges, indeed, that Louis XIV. by the arrogance and eclat of his pretensions, did weaken the confidence of other nations in this disinterested moderation of France. Now it will be remembered that the peace of Westphalia, and even that of the Pyrenees, were made during the minority of this same Louis XIV. and prepared the way for those pretensions, for that cupidity, with which he continued for half a century to be the scourge of mankind. The great powers had, therefore, no occasion for the example of Russia, to awaken their cupidity.In passing to the observations upon the rise and progress of the Prussian power, we remark, that Mr. Hauterive states four consequences as having resulted from it, all of which are solveable to this, that is has deprived France of the advantage of intervening in all the dissentions of the German empire, and settling them at the pleasure of her arbitration. That the Germans have preferred the patronage of Prussia, to the disinterested, magnanimous decisions of France. That the constitution of the empire has been interpreted by the Germans themselves, and not submitted to the construction of a third party. All this, to a certain degree, is true—and this is certainly the most powerfully operative of the causes adduced by him as dissolvents of the system created by the peace of Westphalia; but in altering the comparative masses of power, it produced no alteration of the public law, and if the minor states of Germany relied more upon the protection of Prussia, than upon the guarantee of France, for defence against encroachments from another quarter, the disposition was inspired, not by any alteration of rights, but by the different confidence of the efficacy of the means. Here, we find Mr. Hauterive making his most pointed address to the passions of the Austrian government. To every other, than an Austrian reader, the exchange of a French for a Prussian patronage will appear no evil; to every German, other than a subject of Austria, it will appear a great blessing. But nothing can be so odious to an Austrian, as the power of Prussia, and nothing so soothing to his inclinations as a prospect of checking and reducing it. This explains to us why the author, contrary to the testimony of history, represents Prussia as having first set the example of hoarding up a public treasure and of keeping a standing army. These were the instruments of the Prussian aggrandizement, and in this chapter is insinuated the propriety of a general concert among nations to make them ineffectual—to circumscribe, by general consent, the internal right of every single state, to levy troops or fill coffers.If it were possible still to doubt, whether such suggestions as these were thrown out merely for the sake of the effect they might produce upon Austrian feelings, all hesitation must be removed, by the passage I now shall quote for your meditation. It immediately follows the passage, quoted in my last letter, and should be read in connection with it.“These statesmen thought force was better than policy; that courage was above wisdom; they thought it beneath them to reflect before they determined on rushing into extremes; that was a nobler guardian of rights than negociation; they listened only to the voice of distrust, of jealousy, of vanity; and in short, to come to the source of the evil, they took a pleasure in forming to themselves a monstrous idea of the pre-eminence of France: they despised her diplomatic councils: they disdained her support; and when, afterwards, by the effect of their imprudent combinations, they found those states, whose rapid growth, their blind improvidence had, as it purposely fostered, became formidable rivals by their pretensions, and dangerous neighbours by the indefatigable activity of their views, that laid to the account of France their dangers and their losses, as if France could have protected them, when they spurned her support, and misconstrued the wisdom of her councils, or, as if she ought to have done so, when the time at which her advice and assistance could have been useful to them was past.A profound discussion of all those objects, belongs not to my purpose. I only advise those, who wish to verify what I just said, to study the history of the time, when the first links of the chain of relations which connected the states of Europe together, were broken: they will see whether France did not always seasonably unveil to her friends the secret views of those princes, who projected to aggrandize themselves at the expense of those whom they had their address of associating to their views: whether, from the commencement of the century, France has not, by her unattackable situation, been always interested in the equipoise and immutability of the existing relations: whether it was not against her will, nay, in spite of her exertions, that all the changes, which have occurred in Europe, have happened, to the damage of some, and for the benefit of others.”Notwithstanding the extreme caution, here employed, to avoid the use of any names, the allusion is evidently to the consent given by the emperor of Germany, at the commencement of the last century, to the project of assuming the kingly title, formed by the then elector of Brandenburg. It is true that France refused to acknowledge the first king of Prussia as such until the peace of Utrecht. It is likewise true, that the emperor consented to that acknowledgment, before the war of the Spanish succession began—but the price of this consent was, a stipulation by the elector to furnish ten thousand men to the allies in that war. It is no wonder, therefore, that France negociated against it, with Austria, or that she urged the consequences which might result from an increase of the Prussian consideration, and prove injurious to Austria herself. Yet, in this instance, France was not actuated by her unattackable situation, or by her disinterested magnanimity. Her motive of universal operation, doubtless, was to prevent the aggrandizement of any other power than her own; but her immediate inducement was to prevent the co-operation of the elector, with the allies; for which purpose, at the same time while she negociated with Austria against the acknowledgment of the Prussian royalty, she negociated with the elector for it, and was as ready to grant it for the sake of the Prussian alliance, as the emperor himself. From the peace of Utrecht to the commencement of the revolution, France was engaged in four wars, not one of which was for the purpose of maintaining the immutability of existing relations, or of preventing changes to the detriment of some, and for the benefit of others.But it is in the considerations upon the rise and progress of the maritime and commercial system, the source of prosperity to England, that the author abandons himself, without reserve, to all the bitterness of his heart. In all the other statements, are perceivable, the inspirations of national vanity, envy, and jealousy, but in the composition of this picture, all the furies of hatred combine to mix their blackest colours.Setting aside, however, the feelings and passions of the author, his view of the consequences produced by the English navigation act, deserves serious attention. Here, as in every other part of the book, the mixture of truth and falsehood, of ingenious argument and sophistry is blended together with so much address, that they can be discriminated only by a minute and close examination.“The true founder of the maritime system (says Mr. Hauterive), the true author of the maritime wars of Europe, was Cromwell. That gloomy conspirator, equally distrustful and ambitious, and who delighted in every idea of plotting and violence, considering the insulated situation of England, and the character of its inhabitants, at once active and tenacious, conceived the idea of placing their industry in a permanent state of conspiracy and war against all other industry; of separating their interests forever from the interests of Europe, of launching them alone into a career, where the advantage of the first start would leave their rivals only the resource of a tardy and ill-concerted competition: he proclaimed the navigation act, and by this bold and decisive measure, placed the commerce of his nation in a state of constant enmity and jealousy with regard to the commerce of all others.”All this is poetical machinery—Cromwell was not the author of the navigation act, nor was it the fruit of such extensive views, or of such distant foresight into futurity. The personal resentments of St. John, the animosities of the parliament against the states general of Holland, as well as against some of the English colonies, which had favoured the royal cause, and their jealousy of the army, at the head of which was Cromwell, first produced the navigation act. There is no reason to suppose that its authors were aware of its remote and permanent consequences, more than all the rest of Europe. The Dutch, alone, considered it as hostile, by its immediate application to themselves; but the influence it was destined to produce upon the prosperity of England, and upon the history of Europe, was foreseen by no man. That it made England prosper, is now universally recognized. That prosperity has made England sometimes proud, arrogant, and oppressive to other nations, anxious to engross all commerce to herself, and ever apt to encroach upon that of others, is true. To guard and defend themselves by pacific and lawful concert against this disposition, is the right and interest of the other commercial nations, but they must, above all things, be cautious not to substitute, instead of these principles of self-defence, the inextinguishable virulence, and unbounded rancour, instigated by the feelings of the deadliest national antipathies

ing out of the French revolution there existed no public law in Europe, and we have there alleged the grounds upon which we consider him as having failed in the proof of this proposition. The second chapter is intituled, “General considerations upon the relative situation of France,” and its object is, to prove, that a system of public law for Europe is necessary, and that France must take an active and powerful part in its formation. The method observed in this part of the work has exposed or enabled the author to run over again much of the ground already traversed in the first chapter, and to renew the question there discussed. He gives the same solution to it again, but here, his infallible proof is, that England, during the war, has openly professed the desire to destroy the maritime power of France, and succeeded in drawing all the powers of Europe into her design. But this wish of England had never been a secret to the other powers, who knew, perfectly well, that the destruction of each others maritime power had, for more than a century, been one great object of policy, both to France and England. That this desire burns at this day, with increased violence, in the breast of France, the citizen Hauterive’s book proves beyond a doubt. It is not the interest of the other European powers, and they are, and always have been fully sensible of it, that either France or England should succeed in accomplishing their purposes. They have all seen, with regret, that the ruin of the French navy was one of the necessary, unavoidable evils, which must result from that frantic war, into which France plunged herself against them; but when, by the combination of all their forces, they were unable to defend themselves, their own possessions, their own fire-sides, against her assault, how was it possible for them to take under their protection, the interests of her navy?Through the whole of Mr. Hauterive’s book, he assumes, as an established, and undisputed fact, that the first coalition was a league of all Europe, at the instigation of England, and utterly unprovoked on the part of France, for her subjection and dismemberment. This is a favourite point of view to the French diplomatic writers, since the revolution, and having been driven from all the other posts of their reasoning, they return to this, after the thousandth solemn and full refutation, with as much confidence, as if it had never been disputed. Like all the rest, it is false and hollow. England did not instigate the first coalition against France; nor take any part in the war, until the second year after it began. These facts are susceptible of easy proof, sufficient to satisfy any impartial mind, and I hope, at some future period, to offer you something further, to shew them in a conspicuous light. For the present, as the citizen Hauterive takes his statement for granted, without uttering a syllable in support of a point, so fundamental to his whole argument, I shall equally content myself, with stating directly the contrary, and leave the proof to the candid recollection, or investigation of the reader.In pronouncing, that a public law is necessary for Europe, Mr. Hauterive will not be contradicted by the enemies of the French revolution: he only contradicts all the loudest, and most popular doctrines of the men, who accomplished it. But, before he can persuade the rest of the world, that France must give that law, it is to be hoped, they will duly weigh the grounds, upon which he urges so strange an opinion.“Public law, (says he) between nations, who have communications of neighbourhood, or of commerce, with each other, consists of relations, if not permanent, at least perfectly ascertained. These relations express the rights and the duties of every state; they insure to all known and authorised means for preserving and cultivating the elements of their riches and power; they open, before every one of them, a free career for the display of their faculties; they prevent the strong from intimidating the weak, and guard the sober against the turbulence of the mad.”It is evident, from this passage, connected with the contents of the first chapter, that, by public law, the author means the law of nations. That he wishes to represent treaties, as the only proper source of this, and that the principles prescribed by nature, and the maxims established by custom, must all yield to this conventional law, to be dictated by France, and inspired by the exclusive spirit of her interest and convenience.“Every nation, (he observes) excepting those which are tormented by the blind passion of aggrandizement, is interested in the existence of such a system of common safety, and of mutual guaranty: but none is so much interested in its establishment and permanence as France.” For, besides the disinterested impartiality, for which France has always been famous, she can, henceforth, have no motive for desiring war. Her sources of prosperity are all within herself. The acquisitions, which she has just made, and which she will certainly keep, place her in an unattackable position, and she is too wise, not to know, that further conquests would weaken, instead of strengthening her.“But, (adds he) if, when the rights of France are once secured, the powers of Europe have nothing to dread from her, there is no other great power, with regard to which it would be proper for them to go to sleep with the same security.” One can hardly avoid smiling at the bonhommie of this assertion, and of the serious argument consequent upon it, to prove, (though still with the discretion of avoiding names) that Austria, Russia, England, and Prussia are all ambitious from principle, and in their essence; all to be watched with incessant jealousy by each other, and by the rest of Europe; all to be considered as unappeasable enemies to the peace and safety of the world, while the full measure of unbounded confidence is to be given without a scruple to France—To France, the moderate, the glorious, the secure—the magnanimous protectress of public law.It is indeed a curious circumstance, and so much deserves our attention that I venture once more to call it into your notice, that, after all the French revolutionary legislators at home, and negociators abroad, had held up, for many years, the doctrine, that the law of nature was the only law of nations; had spurned at all usages, disdained all authorities, trampled upon all treaties, and solved every right and every duty into the imprescriptible principles of nature, and the unalienable rights of man, here should come in these latter days, a new diplomatic French teacher, to tell the world, that the whole European law of nations was founded upon the treaty of Westphalia, and as that is annihilated, another law of nations must be made by treaty, in its stead; not bottomed upon the law of nature, and the rights of man, but upon principles of watchful jealousy against other powers, and slumbering confidence in France. It reminds me of a story, Doctor Franklin often used to tell of a French lady, whom he once heard say, in conversation with her sister—”I don’t know how it happens, sister, that there is only one person in the world, who is always in the right, and that is myself.” If, for the refutation of such a doctrine, any thing more can be required, than fairly to state it, the remark is obvious, that a public law, like that contemplated by Hauterive, is so far from being necessary, that it is utterly impracticable; and if it were otherwise, would be, in the highest degree unjust: in fine, that if it were both practicable and reconcileable with justice, it must be founded upon a mutual temper of accommodation on the part of all the great powers, not upon partial favour towards one, and dread of all the rest.To shew this in the clearest light, let us further examine in the author’s book, what he means by his necessary system of public law. “For all the great powers of Europe, and against each of them, excepting France, (says he) a system is necessary, which may define, in a precise manner, their geographical boundaries, the extent of their duties, the limits of their rights. The circumscribing lines must be clearly expressed; their extension must be clearly expressed; their extension must be made perceptible to every ne, nay liable to be foreseen when undertaken, before the damage is felt. At the same time, a system is necessary, which may indicate to all the governments of Europe, the true circumstances of their relative situation, which may teach them which are the nations, whom the nature of their relations points out to them as friends, as enemies, as neutrals; which, in the calm of peace, may prevent them from beholding, with the same eye, the progress or the decline of any given state; which, in war, may guard them against the errors of an inconsiderate indifference, and preserve them from the mistakes of an unenlightened predilection.”Upon these words, no comment can be necessary. I only beg you, sir, to weigh their full force, and then say, whether the system which they urge as necessary, where not a presumptuous attempt to render perpetual and unalterable, what God, by nature, has made changeable and transitory? whether it should not be, in the political world, as absurd an experiment, as that of king Canute, when he commanded the tide not to come and wet his feet? and whether, if it were possible to suppose it could ever be accomplished, it would not be the most entire and unqualified system of subjection and slavery, that ever was imposed upon mankind.And what are the grounds, upon which this public avowal of a pretension on the part of France, to give an all-comprehensive law of nations, to the world are maintained? Her disinterested impartiality as proved in history!—Her safe and unattackable situation!—And her principled aversion against conquest and aggrandizement!It was a custom in Lilliput, as captain Gulliver tells us, that whenever some execution, remarkably cruel and tyrannical had taken place, the government immediately issued a proclamation to the people, largely descanting upon its own extreme gentleness and lenity. This practice has not been forgotten in republican France, and the period when the consuls announced to the nation, that they had just added, by conquest, one sixth to their territories, their strength and their population, has a most happy coinc

, and he himself is sensible of it, when he chuses to be candid. “It must be acknowledged, (says he) that nations, when they aggrandize themselves, only yield to that expansive impulsion, which nature has impressed upon all animated beings, whether they act individually, or combine to act with the energy of a collective activity and will.”“Cet oracle est plus sur que celui de Chalcas.”The rest of Europe may place more dependence upon the constant effect of this expansive impulsion in France, than upon the disinterested impartiality, or the hatred against making conquests, for which she has so long been famed. If the character of the human heart had left the question doubtful before; France has taken care, in her conduct, to solve it beyond a doubt. The author has told us in the former chapter, that, from the commencement of the last century, France has been constantly in an unattackable situation; of course, perfectly safe—of course, interested in the preservation of their existing relations.—Yet all those existing relations she has overthrown—in spite of her safe and unattackable situation, and in spite of a formal solemn declaration to the world, made at the commencement of her revolution, against all conquest, she has chosen to aggrandize herself by one sixth, and to wade through oceans of blood for the accomplishment of that end. Savoy, the Netherlands, Geneva, Egypt, &amp;c. are all irrefragable proofs what France means by aversion to conquest, and disinterested impartiality.If indeed the project which is unfolded in this book were effected; if, by the force of her arms, and the skill of her diplomacy, she could prevail upon all Europe to acquiesce in a law, made by her, defining the boundaries, the rights, the duties of every nation, prescribing to every people whom they must consider as friends, as enemies, as neutrals, controuling alike the progress of one state, and the decline of another, guarding against the indifference of every ally, and preserving from predilections in favour of her enemies, she could have no further occasion for conquest; the world would be prostrate at her feet. She might then leave the details of administration, the odious task of squeezing out the blood of the people to satisfy her insatiable demands to the natives of the respective countries, and content herself with wielding her iron sceptre alike over them all.This is no imaginary picture—The author concludes the chapter, by telling us, that the basis of the new French law of nations is already laid—that the treaties of France, with Holland, Spain, Switzerland, and some other Italian States, shew the foundation of France’s federative and defensive system—the treaties with Prussia, her neutral system; and the treaties with Austria, with their subsequent rupture, her system of hostility. The consideration of these three points is pursued in the following chapters, the examination of which I shall reserve for my future letters

1The third chapter of the book upon the state of France, concerns the relative situation of France, with regard to her allies. It begins with a magnificent eulogium upon that country, for her great exertions in former ages, against the domineering ambition of the court of Rome, of the Venetian republic, and of the house of Austria successively. There can be no doubt but that the efforts of France have always been directed to pull down every other great power, and to increase her own—the mere common place of vulgar policy; but it requires more ingenuity than even the writer I examine possesses, to disguise it thoroughly under the mask of disinterested magnanimity.“The thirty years war (says he), and the peace of Westphalia, put an end to the perpetual anxiety of all the other European states for their independence of the Austrian power; and proved both to the friends and enemies of France, that her policy was guided only by views of general interest, and common guarantee.”This is the text, upon which he indulges his extatic admiration of cardinal Richelieu’s system, in a comment, where every single instance he adduces, is in the most notorious violation of historical truth. Can it be conceived, that a man, at this day, should have the courage to affirm, that in the 30 years war, “France often had to support alone the burden of war—That she conquered the peace—That the treaty will forever testify her fidelity to her friends, her justice towards neutrals, her generosity towards her enemies—That she liberated Portugal and Holland from the Austrian yoke, and secured the independence of Switzerland—That she placed Sweden in the rank of preponderating powers—That she (France! the cardinal de Richelieu!) placed religious liberty, in the number of primitive rights, which belong to all nations, classed religious intolerance, that great pretext for the ambition of princes, in the European code, in the list of political crimes; and pointed it out thenceforth as treason against humanity as one of the highest infractions of public law!”Yes sir, such is the historical accuracy of a work, almost official from the present French government, summoning all Europe, and the United States, to acquiesce in a new system of public law, commenced, and to be completed by France.It cannot be necessary to enter into details of refutation upon these passages; but, with regard to the share of France in the thirty years war, and the peace of Westphalia, I beg leave to make here a short quotation from a German historian—an historian of eminent fame, and distinguished for his strong attachment to that party in Germany, with which France, in the thirty years war, was allied; for his strong feelings against the ambition of Austria—and for his ardour in the cause of religious and political liberty.“At length (after the death of Gustavus Adolphus) the period had arrived, to which Richelieu had looked forward with ardent impatience. Nothing but the utter impossibility of saving themselves in any other way, could prevail upon the protestant states of Germany, to support the pretensions of France upon Alsace. This uttermost necessity now occurred. France was indispensable; and dear was the price she exacted for the active part she took henceforth in the German war. Full of splendour and glory, she now entered upon the political theatre. Oxenstiern, to whom it cost very little to lavish away the rights and possessions of Germany, had already ceded to Richelieu, the Imperial fortress of Philipsburg, and the other places demanded; and now the German protestant princes sent, in their names, a separate embassy, to place Alsace, the fortress of Brisach (which was first to be taken), and all the strong places on the Upper-Rhine, the keys of Germany, under French protection. What French protection meant, had been seen in the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which France had for centuries protected, even against their rightful owners.—Now was the moment of promise arrived, to the hopes of France, of adding likewise Alsace to her extensive possessions; and, by sharing the Spanish Netherlands, soon afterwards with the Hollanders, to make the Rhine her natural boundary against Germany. Thus shamefully were the rights of Germany sold by German states to this faithless, rapacious power; who, under the mask of a disinterested friendship, only strove for aggrandizement; and while, with brazen front, she assumed the honourable appellation of a protectress, was only thinking how to spread her net, and provide for herself in the general confusion.” Schiller’s History of the thirty years War.—Book IV.Here you see, sir, something more than vague and general declamation, to form an opinion of the French system, so much extolled by the French system, so much extolled by the French pamphleteer. France wanted to get hold of Alsace, and the keys of Germany—But to get at the same time the reputation of disinterested impartiality, she took them only as to protect them; when they were once in her possession, she knew how to keep them, and accordingly secured all she could of them to herself, at the peace. This is what the under secretary would smooth over, by saying, that “she claimed an increase of territory, only because it was necessary for her safety, and to secure the defence of her frontiers.”It would be easy to pursue, step by step, the whole of his historical deduction, from the peace of Westphalia downwards, and to prove the falsehood of it by testimony, equally irrefragable; you may judge of it from the frequency, with which the same motive of providing, by an increase of territory, for France’s safety, and the defence of her frontiers, recurs to the author’s pen. In the first chapter he had argued, that from the commencement of the eighteenth century, France’s situation was unattackable; but here he tells us, that the sole object, for which Louis XIV. carried on the war of the Spanish succession, was the safety of France, and the acquisition of some slight advantages. This purpose of adding safety upon safety, to what is already vaunted as perfectly safe, is the only contrivance the author’s ingenuity could furnish him, for justifying the expansive impulsions of France, from the reign of Richelieu, to that of Talleyrand; from the peace of Munster, to the peace of Luneville.To a writer, who assumes so large a licence with history, it could not be difficult to assert, that the sole system of the enemies of France, at the commencement of the war, was an universal combination of the four quarters of the globe against her alone. He makes no scruple of descending to particulars, and to affirm, among other things, that the United States were formally invited to join the coalition. This is not the most flagrantly false statement in an enumeration, where Turkey is mentioned as one of the powers, who actually did suffer themselves to be drawn into the league; but I mention it because its falsehood will be more universally known in America, and therefore it may better, than any other, serve as a specimen to show what credit the author’s veracity deserves.This imaginary universal combination against France, could cost no more to dissolve than to form; and its inventor has made cheap of it, since it was only brought forward to contrast with the federative system of France. This, according to him, is admirably calculated for consistency, order, justice and stability; and no less admirably calculated to preserve the balance of Europe. It is founded upon two simple principles: “1. That the object of every alliance must be, in peace, to guarantee the permanency of the existing relations, and in war, to concert the defence of those relations, against the undertakings of the common enemy. 2. The object of every alliance, whether in peace or war, must be to guarantee the political interests of the continent, from the exaggerated ascendancy of the maritime interests.” These principles are vaguely expressed, but the author himself gives explanations, which enable his reader to understand precisely their meaning. He might have solved the two into one, by saying, that the object of every alliance must be, exclusively, to promote the views and interests of France, and to effect the ruin of England. This is what the author is cautious not to avow, but its evidence bursts out in every page of his book. It is not immaterial to know this, because here is the place where a formal summons to the United States is introduced, to forsake their present federative system and adopt that of France. This passage is of so much importance that it is fit you should have it, as literal as translation can make it.“The basis of the maritime system of France, are the alliance of Holland, of Spain; of Liguria. The object of these alliances is known: it can give no umbrage to any one, and France is determined to defend, with all her means, present and future, the common rights and interests which are derived from it. It is for the maritime nations of Europe, who are not satisfied with the situation, in which the contradictions of their present federative system place them, to chuse between the inconveniencies and advantages of that situation, and the advantages, and inconveniencies, which the federative system of France presents. I need not say that this appeal is addressed, first to the Porte, the States of Barbary, Naples and Portugal, and secondly to Denmark, Sweden, and the United States.”The appeal is made with an appearance of moderation, and with a seeming disposition to leave the choice of systems, to the specified powers themselves. The means of positive compulsion, are not so effectual in the hands of France, with regard to her maritime, as with regard to her continental system. The basis of this too, our author says, are laid, and he makes an appeal here too, to the neighbours of France, to form alliances with her: but here all the shew of candour is abandoned, all the liberty of choice is forbidden, and no alternative left the powers in question, but compliance with the French system, and devastation by French armies. “France (says he) will substitute military dispositions, instead of federative dispositions, and if those princes will be deaf to the voice of interest, which urges them to ally themselves with her, she will ally herself de facto with the countries which they may be incapable of defending, and make herself auxiliaries of all the means of subsistence and defence, which any of the territories that her armies may occupy will furnish.”One of the most remarkable characteristics of the author, whose labours I am investigating, is a singular felicity of expression, which you will find very conspicuous in this passage. Thus, over-running a country with innumerable armies, letting loose upon the harvests of the cottager, and the labours of the citizen, every harpy of plunder, and every fiend of desolation; pressing out, with the screws of military execution, drop by drop, the blood and sweat of industrious poverty, to supply the deficiencies of the French finances, is here termed in “words that breathe, and thoughts that burn;” France’s allying herself with a country de facto; giving to understand with an energy, of which the writer himself perhaps was not conscious, that the friendship and hospitality hostility of France, are in their effects so nearly the same, as to be best designated by the same appellation.The great objection for those powers, to whom the freedom of pursuing the system which they themselves deem best, against their acceptance of the French invitations, is, that besides the violation of their public faith, pledged in former treaties, the principle of reciprocity, of mutual interests, and equal rights, is not included; but on the contrary, is entirely excluded from the fundamental maxims, upon which they are told, by this author, that all the treaties of France are to be founded. To feel the force of this observation, please to apply the author’s two principles, to the alliance, actually extant between France and Holland. When this alliance was concluded, the existing relations of Holland with France were those of a conquered country with its conquerors. If the object of the alliance was to preserve and defend these relations, it might very well suit the interests of France; but what became of those of Holland? The second principle gives the best answer to this question. An alliance against the influence of the maritime interests, is undoubtedly against the first and most important interests of Holland, a state almost exclusively commercial, and whose existence, much more certainly than that of England, depends upon the prosperity of trade. Thus the alliance of Holland with France, upon the principles of this writer, is an alliance against her own interests, to preserve her as a conquest of France; the statement I believe perfectly just, but it is not adapted to inspire other states with the ambition of imitating the example.Upon the subject of this chapter, and particularly upon the author’s view of the rise and progress of the maritime system, I forbear many observations, only because I am persuaded they will occur to yourself on perusing the work, and because I am apprehensive of spreading into tediousness, my comment upon it

MISCELLANY.  
FOR THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
LETTERS FROM AN AMERICAN, RESIDENT ABROAD,  
ON VARIOUS TOPICS OF FOREIGN LITERATURE.  
  
No. I.  
  
28th March, 1801.  
DEAR SIR,  
  
Isend vou by this opportunity a French pamph-  
let, entitled, *¢ Bacon As He Js; or, Denunciation  
ofa French Translation of his Works, published  
at Dijon, by M. Ant. La Salle—By [. A. De  
Luc, Reader to the Queen of Great-Britain ;  
Fellow of the Royal Societies, of London and  
Dublin; Member of the Society of Naturalists,  
at Berlin; of that of Mineralogy, at Jena; and  
of several others: Professor of Philosophy and  
Geology, at Gottingen.”  
  
The title of this litele work will, perhaps, strike  
you as somewhat curious ; and, upon reading it,  
you will find its contents still more so.—It has  
been sufficiently proved to the world, that the  
authors of the French Encyclopedia were the  
founders of a political and anti-religious sect,  
the object of which has been, to overthrow the  
Christian faith, and all the ancient establishments  
of government, in Europe. This undertaking,  
itis well known, they accomplished in France,  
where they seated themselves, at least, fora time,  
upon the ruins of the altar and throne they had  
destroyed. -Lheir design of spreading, by the  
United influence of the sword and the pen, their  
Goctriies and their practices over all the world,  
has, according to the various changes in their  
Prospects of success, been proclaimed, and de-  
bied, with a voice*equally loud, and in term:  
equally positive.—This pamphlet of Mr. De  
Luc, not only fitrnishes abundant proof, that  
Such was very recently, if it be not still, the de-  
sign of the French government; but unfolds th  
artifices, which they were not ashamed to use in  
the pursuit of their object.  
  
  
  
THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
«¢ The authors of the Encyclopedia,” Mr. De  
Luc observes, ‘ though very far from intending  
to. follow the footsteps of lord Bacon, professed  
to be his disciples, and extoiled him to the skies ;  
but their object only was, to withdraw the eyes  
of the public from hin, and fix them upon them-  
selves, for the purpose of esta lishing principles  
in diametrical opposition to his.”  
  
But this artifice having been discovered, and  
made known to the public, the sect of Encyclo-  
  
edians, encouraged by the success of the system  
followed by their founders, enlarged their views,  
and adopted a much bolder plan of operations.  
Conceiving it necessary, still, to retain Bacon, as  
their apparent leader, they hoped to escape the  
reproach, which their predecessors had incurred,  
of misrepresenting him to persons, unable to con-  
sult his original works, by publishing a French  
translation of his works. ‘This is the translation,  
of which several volumes have already appeared,  
and which Mr. De Luc denounces.  
  
There is an appearance of frankness and can-  
dour in this measure, behind which one would  
not suspect to find lurking, forgery and impos-  
ture. Under colour of a transilation, to palm  
upon the public, in the name of a national go-  
vernment, principles of philosophy, of theology,  
of morals, and of polities, absolutely contrary to  
those of the author translated, is a stratagem,  
which an honest mind would be ashamed to ima-  
gine as possible. ‘That it has been done, Mr De  
Luc not only furnishes decisive proof, but he  
opens to the most careless observer, the manner,  
in which it has been done.  
  
That the pretended translation was published  
with the sanction, and in some sort made, by or-  
der of the French government, is asserted by the  
editor himself. And as the object was, to inter-  
pret the works of the great Bacon, for those  
French citizens who had not leisure to study  
him, ‘* it became our duty,” adds the translator,  
‘“‘ to begin, by zdentifying ourselves, with him, in  
order to be the more fully penetrated with his  
spirit.” |  
  
Under the mask of this identification, the  
translator has likewise assumed the voice of Ba-  
con; and spreads over fifty-four pages of a gene-  
ral preface, a fictitious solzloguy of that great  
philosopher, in which he makes him give an ac-  
count of the views and designs with which he  
composed his works. By the means of this the-  
atrical machine, you will not be surprised to find,  
lord chancellor Bacon talking the language of a  
determined French jacobin ; to hear him rant in  
terms like these—  
  
“¢ Before it will be expedient to denounce ty-  
rants, and offer liberty to mankind, or force them  
by a Aoly violence to accept it, we must explain to  
them with clearness and precision, what that li-  
berty, offered them with the sword or the ba0&amp; in  
the hand, is, lest they should confound it with  
licentiousness, which is directly the opposite. 1  
will enable them to say for themselves, what I  
dare not publicly tell them, for their attention  
will first turn itself towards that which most in-  
terests them; that is, their rights. When once  
rendered capable of seeking these themselves,  
they will seek, and, of course, wiil find them;  
they will one day find, and the next, learn to de-  
fénd them.  
  
‘Thus, without attacking directly, either the  
throne or the altar, which, at this day, lean upon  
each other, and resting both, upon the three-folc  
basis of long tgnorance, long terror, and long ha  
hit, seem notto be shaken, I will shew respect t  
both, in words, while, at the same time, I will  
  
179.  
undermine both, by my principles; for, the surest  
way to kill, at one stroke, royalty and priesthood,  
without butchering a single individual, is, to en-  
leavour, by enlightening mankind, to render  
kings, and priests, the flatterers and accomplices,  
when they despair of becoming the masters of  
kings, forever useless.”  
But, in order to convert Bacon into a professor  
of atheism and anarchy, it was not sufficient to  
take his name, and then make an avowal of cow-  
ardice and hypocrisy. It is evident, from all his  
writings, that he never made the comparative  
merit of the usual political forms of government,  
a subject of his meditations. His deep and sin-  
cere conviction of the truth of christianity, is  
manifested, not only in frequent passages, scatter-  
ed over all his works, but in several distinct and  
entire treatises. Mr. De Luc shows us how the  
pretended translator has got over these difficul-  
ties. The treatises, by suppression; and the  
single passages, by imputing them to simulation,  
or by ridiculing them in a comment. The trans-  
lation professes to be a complete collection ; but,  
in the specific list afterwards given, several works  
upon religious subjects, mentioned by Mr. De  
Luc, and among the rest, a formal, methodical,  
and detailed confession of faith, are omitted.  
The numerous passages, where the translator  
disfigures the meaning of his author, by miscon-  
struction, or attacks it with ridicule, I need not  
particularly notice ; but, there is one more mate-  
rial than all the rest, because it discovers the  
translator’s real creed, and, at the same time, the  
mode of reasoning employed by a man, who  
boasts of having identified himself with Bacon.  
One of the chancellor’s fundamental principles,  
which, says Mr. De Luc, is in various forms con-  
tinually recurring through all his works, is, that  
the studies of natural philosophy, and of religion,  
should be distinctly pursued, and never blended  
with each other; that the book of nature is the  
source of all physical, as the book of revelation  
is that of all theological knowledge; that it is ab-  
surd to look into the one, for proofs of what is  
only to be found in the other; and that, to at-  
tempt, for instance, to raise a system of natural  
philosophy, upon the book of Genesis, or that of  
Job, is to seek for the dead among the living.—  
The neglect of this maxim, he complains, has  
been productive of much evil, and is chargeable  
upon many of the Greek philosophers, among  
others. At a passage, where he particularly cen-  
sures Plato, for blending theology with his natu.  
  
ral philosophy, the translator has annexed a note  
to this effect—  
  
“Tf it be true, that the main-spring of this  
world be God, the theory of springs being a part  
of mechanics, and mechanics a part of physics, we  
are forced to mingle theology with philosophy.  
[t is because the natural philosophers always con-  
sider the motion of this world as produced, and  
not as to be produced, that they are not suffi-  
ciently sensible of this truth. It is, therefore,  
because their theory of metive powers is incom-  
plete, that, in their general systems of physics, .  
they say nothing of God, or of his equivalents.”  
  
Here, Mr. De Luc very justly remarks, plain,  
downright, brazen-faced, and marble-hearted,  
atheism, is introduced in formal terms.—But, ob-  
  
erve the manner of introducing it—First, by an  
hypothetical assertion, that God is the main-spring  
of this world; an idea, to which many a reader  
might assent, as understanding the word main-  
spring in a metaphorical sense. Then, by a se-  
cond assertion, that the theory of springs is a part  
  
  
  
of mechanics, where the word spring couldonly be :  
  
  
  
180  
  
taken literally. And, finally, by a conclusion,  
drawn from this logical quibble—that God is a  
mechanical power. It is exactly the same falla-  
cy of reasoning, which Dr. Johnson once ridicul-  
ed, as a fallacy of wit, in these ludicrous lines:  
‘* If the man who turnips cries,  
** Cry not when his father dies,  
  
“ &#x27;Tis a sign that he had rather  
** Have a turnip than his father.”  
  
Mr. De Luc in this, and various other parts of  
the pamphlet, shews not only the real opposition  
between the principles of lord Bacon, and those  
of, his translator, but likewise the inconsistency  
of the translator, with himself. At the same  
time, he gives us, from the translator’s own  
words, the means of judging him, and of recon-  
ciling all his apparent inconsistencies, n&gt;t with  
each other, but with the views, which led to this  
metamorphosis of lord Bacon, and with the spi-  
rit which presided, at its accomplishment.  
  
Thus, throughout the whole soliloquy put into  
the mouth of Bacon, the translator appears de-  
sirous to be thought a friend and supporter of  
deism, in religion, and of the christian system, in  
morality. How consistent the first part of these  
opinions is, with this profession of atheism, we  
have seen. ‘The same self-contradiction appears  
in different passages, upon moral topics. ‘Thus,  
in one place, he extols the * true christian reli-  
gion, as a pure and sublime, a kind and precise  
law, consisting solely in the love of God and our  
neighbour, and in actions conformable to this in-  
junction.—This true christianity, (he adds) as  
exhibited in the developementof the sermon from  
the mount, will last as long as man; since the na-  
ture of the human heart, is the soil in which it is  
planted.” —After reading the atheistical note I  
have quoted above, what would one imagine the  
translator means, by his pure and sublime love of  
God—the love of a mechanical power! the love  
of a main-spring! His love of our neighbour, ir-  
radically planted in the human heart, may, from  
another passage, be inferred to bear equal marks  
of purity and sublimity. Bacon argues, that the  
love of justice is innate in the human heart—upon  
which, his translator remarks, that if this be true,  
¢ itis not, that every individual loves to observe  
it towards others, but that he wishes others to  
observe it towards himseli; and, if he insists that  
others should observe it among themselves, it is,  
that they may likewise be just towards him.” —  
“Thus, as the translator’s deism is simple atheism,  
60 his christian benevolence is exclusive selfish-  
ness.  
  
The key to all these seeming inconsistencies,  
may be found in the fo!lowing sentiments, which  
the translator imputes to his author :—* It is,”  
says he, “ only by yielding a little to established  
prejudices, that the truths destined to destroy  
them, can be insinuated. In order to undeceive  
mankind, it is necessary to win their confidence,  
which can only be done, dy appearing, at first, to  
think like them.”—-Such are the real moral max-  
ims of the translator, who, under the pretence e  
identifying himself with Bacon, does precise],  
the reverse, and identifies Bacon with himself.  
  
I need not further pursue this analysis of Mr.  
De Luc’s pamphlet, wh ch, lam persuaded, yo  
will read with attention and interest: Nor wil  
itescape your observation, that the same system  
of falsification, which he haus thus detected and  
exposed, with regard to the works of Bacon, is,  
at the same time, pursued by a sect of theolog -  
ans, with regard tothe holy scriptures. This  
he affirms, and undertakes to prove, in a work  
not yet published. ‘The writings of Bacon may )  
  
THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
be considered as the sources of our natural, as  
the Bible is the great source of our divine learn-  
ng. If it is a melancholy prospect, to observe  
the indefatigable industry, the fanatic enthusiasm,  
and the profound address, with which both the  
great fountains of human science have been poi-  
soned, it is, at least, a consolatory reflection, that  
equal zeal and perseverance, combined with still  
greater ability, are occupied, to furnish us with  
antidotes which may neutralize the infectious ve-  
nom, and enable us, still, to drink of the uncor-  
rupted waters of life.

s from the German fabulist, Gellert.  
I shall, perhaps, occasionally, send you a few  
more, with the intention of giving you some  
idea of his character and merit, as a writer of  
fables. This cannot, indeed, be done in any  
other, than a very imperfect manner, to those,  
who do not understand his own language. There  
is a mixture of archness and simplicity in his  
narrative, of keen satire and honest good nature  
in his reflections, which might be rendered inano-  
ther tongue. But there are colloquial forms of  
speech, and peculiar modes of expression, which  
it is hardly possible to transfer from one lJan-  
guage to another, and much of the excellence of  
fable-writmg proceeds from the choice and use  
of these appropriate idioms. Of the defects,  
therefore, which you will discover in the ver-  
sions from Gellert, which you receive from me,  
jmpute some to the essential infirmities of trans-  
lation, and some to those of the translator; and  
I think you will then readily conceive, that Gel-  
lert is considered as one of the great reformers  
of his language, and refiners of the taste of his  
nation; in short, as a fabulist, second only to  
La Fontaine.  
  
He was born at Hinichen, in Saxony, July 4,  
1715, and died at Leipzig, (where he had, for  
many years, been a professor at the university)  
December 18, 1769. © Exactly nine years before  
that event, the scene and dialogue took place, o!  
which, as described by himseli, I shall now give  
you an account.  
  
You very well know the aversion, which Fre-  
derick the second affected, through the whole  
course of his life, against the German language,

its literature, and its literary men. You likewise  
know, that during the principal part of the seven  
years war, he was in possession of the city of  
Leipzig, and of almost all the electorate of  
Saxony. At the close of the year 1760, being  
at winter-quarters there, he sent his adjutant,  
Guichard, the celebrated Quintus Icilius, to pro-  
tessor Gellert, with an invitation to come to him.  
Gellert accordingly went, and the following dia-  
logue took’ place. between them. I shall only  
leave out those parts of it, which, relating mere-  
ly to Gellert’s state of health, or to the politics  
of the time, contain nothing of amusement or of  
information. ‘The scene is in the king’s cham-  
ber, where he was alone when Gellert entered,  
and was introduced to him by Quintus Icilius.  
  
King. Are you professor Gellert?  
  
Gellert. Yes, may it please your majesty.  
  
King. ‘Vhe English minister has spoken high-  
ly of youto me. Where were you born?  
  
Gellert. At Hinichen, near Freyberg.  
  
King. Have you not a brother at Freyberg.  
  
Gellert. Yes, sir.  
  
King. Pray tell me, what is the reason, why  
we have no good German writers?  
  
(This question, addressed to a German writer,  
did not abound with the politeness for which  
Frederick was famed; and so thought Quintus,  
who put in a word here, and said,)  
  
“Your majesty has one now in your presence,  
whom the French themselves have translated,  
and call the German Fontaine.”  
  
King. That is saying a great deal.  
you read La Fontaine?  
  
Gellert. Yes, sir, but without imitating him.  
My manner of writing is my own.  
  
King. Very well. That is one; but why  
have we not more good authors?  
  
Gellert. Your majesty has taken a preposses-  
sion against the Germans.  
  
King. No. I cannot say that.  
  
Gellert. At least against the German writers.  
  
King. ‘That istrue. Why have we no good  
historians?  
  
Gellert. They are not wanting. We have a  
Mascov, and a Cramer, the continuator of Bos-  
suet.  
  
King. How? Is it possible, that a German  
should have continued Bossuet?  
  
Gellert. Yes, and with success. One of your  
majesty’s most learned professors has said,’ that  
the continyation is equal in eloquence, and supe-  
rior in historical accuracy, to Bossuet himself.  
  
King. Did.sthat man understand him?  
  
Gellert. ‘The world think so.  
  
King. But why does nobody try upon Taci-  
tus? ‘They should make a good translation oj  
him.  
  
Gellert. Tacitus is hard to translate.  
have bad French translations too of him.  
  
King. ‘That is very true.  
  
Gellert. And in general, several reasons may  
be alledged why the Germans have not yet distin-  
guished themselves in all the varieties of good  
writing. While the arts and sciences flourished  
among the Greeks, the Romans were engaged in  
war. Perhaps this is the warlike age of the  
Germans. Perhaps, too, they have wanted an  
Augustus, and a Lewis Fourteenth.  
  
King. Why, Saxony has had two Augus-  
tus’s.  
  
Gellert.  
  
Have  
  
We  
  
And we have made in Saxony too, a  
good beginning.  
  
King. How! would you have one Augustus  
  
  
  
for all Germany?  
  
  
  
Gellert. Not exactly that; I only wished y  
every prince, in his own territory, would en,,.  
rage genius.  
  
fing: Were you never out of Saxony?  
  
ellert. I was once in Berlin.  
  
King. You should travel.  
  
Gellert. Sir, I have neither the health nor,  
means necessary for that. ,  
  
King. Which do you think the best  
poet, Ressan or Virgil?  
  
&#x27; Gellert. Homer seems to deserve the pref,  
ence ; as being the original.  
  
King.» But Virgil is much more polish’g,  
  
Gellert. We are too far removed from y  
mer to judge accurately of his language  
manners; but I trust in this to Quintilian,  
gives Homer the preference.  
  
King. But we must not servilely adopt 4  
judgments of the antients, neither.  
  
Gellert. Certainly not. I only follow th  
when, owing to the too great distance, I cam  
myself judge.  
  
Duintus. The professor has likewise y  
lished a collection of German letters.  
  
King. So! and, pray have you written apaj;  
the law-style?  
  
Gellert. Oh! yes; may it please your maje  
  
King. But why don’t they alter it? ]  
devilish strange. They bring me whole she  
of which I cannot understand a word,  
  
Gellert. If your majesty cannot alter it, I¢  
still less effect the change. I can only adyj  
where you command.  
  
King. Cannot you repeat any of your fab  
by heart?  
  
Gellert. Iamnotsure. My memory is  
treacherous.  
  
King. Recollect yourself. . I will walk ak  
meanwhile. Well! have you got one?  
  
- Gellert. Yes, sir.  
  
A painter of ingenuous heart,  
  
Who rather work’d for famerate heart tod!  
At Athens once, in days of ;. . .., + .  
Shew’d, to a critic in his art,  
  
A Mars, that he had just design’d,  
  
Of which he begg’d him speak his mind.  
The critie candidly confess’d  
  
He thought it not from failings free ;  
  
In too much art, the god was dress’d,  
Not fierce and rough as Mars should be;  
While each objection that he made  
  
On specious principles was grounded,  
The artist equal skill display’d,  
  
To prove the censure not well founded;  
And after having argued long,  
  
Still could not think his labour wrong.  
  
|  
  
A footish coxcomb now came in,  
Upon the picture cast his eyes,  
And gazing, with sagacious grin—  
Gods! what a master-piece! he cries:  
Behold this foot! what nails are here!  
You see the god himself appear ;  
How rich his garb! his arms, how fine!  
Look ; how the shield and helmet shine!  
  
The painter how, o’erwhelm’d with shame,  
Turn’d to his friend, with visage sad ;  
You’re right, quoth he, and I to blame,  
  
I now confess my picture bad—  
Then, ere the coxcomb could retire,  
He threw his war-god in the fire.  
  
King. Well—the moral?  
Gellert. Directly, sir.  
When critics disapprove your lays,  
‘Tis a bad omen for your lyre;  
  
But when the fools begin to praise,  
Throw, throw your verses in the fire!  
  
King. That’s pretty! very pretty! very™  
ly turned. I understand all that. But Goi  
brought and read me a translation of the Iph  
nia, (of Racine). I bad the French omg

Gellert. May it please your majesty, I throw

King: Well—if I stay here, you must come  
fento me, and bring your fables with you, and  
1a me some of them.  
  
Gellert. I believe I am not a very good  
,der. I have something of the mountainous,  
gnting tone.  
  
King. Ay! like the Silesians. No matter!  
ou must read me your fables, yourself; else  
ey will lose some of their merit.......S0, mind,

Thus ended the conversation. But the king did  
send for him again, and without an express call,  
+ llert did not chuse to return. After he was gone,

language, has hithertoso much obstructed. I am  
ashamed to say, that although my studies of Ger-  
man, since you left us, have not been interrupted,  
I have made no auvances in the power of speak-  
ing, and very few in the facility of reading it.  
With Lessing, and Gellert, and Gesner, and  
Wieland, I have indeed made myself tolerably  
familiar, as by frequenting the theatre, I have  
seen most of the very fashionable dramas of  
Kotzebue, now the favourite play-wright, not only  
of Germany, but of England and France; from  
the former of which, I perceive, he has found his  
way to America. But the utter impossibility of  
meeting any opportunity here, to speak the lan-  
guage constantly, for any length of time, makes  
me despair of ever acquiring it to any considera-  
ble degree.  
  
The number of books, daily published in Ger-  
many, rather augments, than diminishes. There  
are certainly more volumes published here in one  
year, than there are of volumes worth reading, in  
the world. In every department of science and  
literature, what loads of trash burden the stalls  
of Leipzig, at the moment of the present fair;  
but in none, perhaps, so much as in that of meta-  
physics, and moral philosophy. You will re-  
member, it is not long since I anticipated, that  
atheism and revolution would soon be preached  
in Germany, without resorting to that canting  
gibberish, which many good folks have been kind  
enough, to take for obscurity. A disciple of  
Kant, one Fichte, professor of moral philosophy  
at Jena, has already done it in part. He has  
written a book, ridiculing the ideas of a future  
life, and retribution of rewards and punishments,  
and ofa supreme Being, as the dispenser of them. |  
But Mr. Fichte unfolded the mysteries of the  
sect rather too soon. The work was denounced  
to the governments of Saxony, Prussia, Hanover,  
and Brunswick, and was prohibited by them all,  
except the king of Prussia, who answe.+:d, that  
atheism was too absurd a thing to be believed,  
however it might be inculcated, and that an au-  
thor who preached it, could oualy expose his own  
folly. - Fichte has been removed by the duke of  
Weimar, from his professorship, and now wan-  
ders about Germany, scribbling, and holding him-  
self forth, as the victim of persecution.  
  
Here has been made at Berlin, another, but a  
more cautious and guarded attack, against the  
religion ofthe country. A large number of Jews,  
heads of families, of respectable character, have  
subscribed, and published a letter to Mr. Teller,  
provost of the upper consistory (the depart-  
ment of government, which has the superinten-  
dance of ecclesiastical a®airs), in which they de-  
clare, that being convinced, the laws of Moses  
are no longer binding upon them, as not being  
adapted to their circumstances at this day, they  
are willing and ready, to become christians, as  
far as relates to the moral doctrines of christiani-  
ty, provided they shall not be required to believe  
the miraculous part of the christian creed, and  
above all, the divinity of Jesus Christ; and pro-  
vided, they may be admitted to enjoy all the  
rights and privileges enjoyed by the members of  
ihe established religion. Their confession of  
laith would be something less than Socinianism ;  
but approaching nearlyto it. ‘They ask Mr. Tel-  
ier’s advice, upoa their plan, and whether he  
thinks it practicable.  
  
He has published his&#x27;‘answer, which, besides be-  
ing, as [ hear, not so well written as their letter,  
has giverrsatisfaction to nobody. He tells them,  
that they do well to believe as much in christiani-  
  
LOY  
  
science, believe more, they do well not .o profess  
it; but as tothe question, whether thei. fragment  
of faith ought to entitle them to share the clvilang  
political privileges, enjoyed exclusive! by entire  
christians, it is not his province, but belongs to  
the civil authority of the country to decide,  
  
Mr. De Luc, a celebrated chemist, and theo-  
logian, has published a letter to these Jews, in  
which he boldly advances to meet them, on the  
ground which Mr. Teller eludes; he tells them,  
that, far from scrupling points of christian doc-  
trine, they ought not even to abandon the stan-  
dard of Moses; that the history of the earth, and  
its present appearance, are the strongest of all  
possible testimonies, to the truth of the Mosaic  
history, and that, if they will only take the pains  
to become better natural philosophers, they will  
not be so ready to renounce their faith as Jews.  
There have been numerous pamphlets more,  
written and published upon this subject, which  
has made, as the French term it, a great sensa-  
tion in the north of Germany. It has even given  
rise to epigrams, though these are a species of  
wit, not native to the German soil. I have heard  
one repeated, the substance of which was,  
  
‘© Why not give credit to the Son,  
  
*« Ye Jews, at usury so clever ?”  
  
- Because there’s nothing to be won,  
‘¢ The Father means to live forever.

DEAR SIR,  
  
You will remember, that in the year 1793,  
while the government of the French republic was  
in the hands of Robespierre, ‘a collection of pa-  
pers, found among those of Louis the sixteenth,  
was published, under.the title of Politics of all the  
Cabinets of Europe. The most important of these  
papers, and that from which the title was given  
to the whole collection, was a work, written by  
Mr. Favier, a person employed in Louis the  
fifteenth’s secret’ministry for foreign affairs ; and  
ject of this work was to prove,&#x27;from  
a.consideration of the political situation and  
views of all the European powers, that a great, an  
essential, a total change in the military, the fede-  
  
ral, andthe fiscal system of France, was indis-  
  
pensably necessary to restore her preponderance  
in the séalewof nations. _ It was written in the  
year 1773, and had been presented to Louis fif.  
teen, a short time before his death; but the edi-  
tor-of the collection justly observes, in the»pre-  
face. to it, that, in these conjectures of Favier, is  
to be found the germ of every thing that had.

revolution, ~

by citizen Hauterive, first clerk in the present  
French office of foreign affairs. It is a work of  
considerable ability, written with much elegance  
of style, and much appearance of argument. As  
I propose to give an account of it at some length,  
with my own reflections upon its contents, it was  
proper to precede the mention of it, by that of  
Favier’s conjectures, because the objects of Mr.  
Hauterive’s pamphiet, are evidently the result  
and the complement of Favier’s system, and  
without the previous knowledge of this, it is im-  
possible to form an accurate estimate of that.  
The identity of object, for which they were  
both calculated, is apparent even from the seem-  
ing opposition of their views; for, as the great  
purpose of Favier was to prove, from the politics  
of all the cabinets of Europe, the necessity of a  
revolution in the state of France, that of Haute-  
rive is to show, from the state of France, after  
that revolution has happened, the necessity of a  
revolution equally complete in the poliiics of all  
the cabinets of Europe. The principal differ-  
ence between them is, that Favier, writing as  
he supposed, solely and exclusively for the king  
of France’s perusal, avows, and professes the  
final purpose of the change, which he recom-  
mends, to be the establishment of a perfect and  
unrivalled preponderance of France in the affairs  
of Europe; whereas, Hauterive, addressing him-  
self to sovereigns, who know too well what the  
consequences to themselves, of a French supre-  
macy woul! be, always denies, endeavours to  
conceal, and only betrays the same ultimate de-  
sign.  
  
His work is divided into six chapters, each of  
which I propose to examine separately, though  
as briefly as possible, with the intention of stat-  
ing its argument, and of distinguishing its real  
motive from its apparent object, and of noticing  
the errors in point of fact, and of reasoning, into  
which an unqualified assent to the assertions and  
opinions of the author might lead.  
  
The first chapter treats of the political situation  
of Europe before the war. Its avowed object is to  
prove, that ‘immediately before the commence-  
«¢ ment of the French revolution, the public law  
“of Europe, existed only in appearance ; that  
‘¢ the revolution only made its destruction more  
‘ strikingly evident, and that it is at once the  
&lt;&lt; most important duty and the h’ghest interest  
“ of the European governments, immediately to  
‘¢ concert the means of creating it anew.” ‘The  
argument is indeed chiefly limited to the demon-  
stration of the fact, and the inference from it is’  
extended into the next chapter.  
  
«“ At the middle of the last century, says Mr.  
«“ Hauterive, a treaty, containing the fundamen-  
« tal rights, and duties of the greatest part of the  
‘continental powers, assigned the place which  
« belonged to each of them in the great political  
&lt;«‘ scale of Europe. —Lhis classic and elementary  
“treaty, for so it may be called, might perhaps  
‘¢ have founded, for a long series of ages, the  
‘¢ public law of the world, had not three events,  
“&lt; originating nearly at the same period, come to  
&lt;‘ complicate the generalsystem, with unexpected  
« combinations, which, though at first impercep-  
“ tible and slow, gtadually attacked all the rela-  
&lt;¢ tions consecrated or prepared by the treaty of  
«© Westphalia, and have finally, in our days, scan-  
&lt;«¢ dalously burst all the ties which united these  
“6 relations, and destroyed the foundations of in-  
“terest, of concord, and of counterpoise, upon  
«¢ which they were established.”  
  
“© These three events are, 1. The formation of  
  
THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
*¢ elevation of Prussia to the rank of a first rate  
“ power; and 3. The prodigious growth of the  
‘*¢ colonial and maritime system in the four quar-  
** ters of the globe.”  
The deduction of consequences, presented by  
the author, as having resulted from the introduc-  
tion of these new materials into the politicalsystem  
of Europe, is ingenious, in many respects just,  
and highly deserving of the profound meditation  
of every statesman. But before I proceed to  
mention the objections, to which some of its de-  
tails are liable, it may be proper here to observe  
two things. First, that the peace of Westphalia  
cannot, and ought not to be considered as the  
great charter of Europe, containing all the rights  
and duties of its several nations. And secondly,  
that the enumeration of events, which have con-  
tributed to render the principles and arrange-  
ments of that compromise, obsolete and inappli-  
cable, is imperfect. To give a full and fair view  
of the subject, the author should have taken into  
his calculation, not merely the rise and progress  
of the new powers, but likewise the declension  
and decay of those which were then at their most  
flourishing period; the house of Austria, Sweden,  
and above all the spiritual power; including the  
disposition and habit of contending, and treating,  
of making war and peace, upon religious ques-  
tions.  
The peace of Westphalia was primarily and  
essentially no more than the termination of are-  
ligious civil warin Germany. But, in the course  
of that war, the political constitution of Germany  
had intimately connected with it, the worldly in-  
terests of the states, which go to its composition,  
and hence the religious pacification became com-  
plicated with the establishment of a balance of  
power, between the German states. France and  
Sweden had taken part in the war, as allies of the  
protestant party, and were therefore principal  
parties on one side to the peace. ‘The conduct  
of France was certainly not dictated by her at-  
tachment to the religious principles of her allies.  
Her motive was opposition to the house of Aus-  
tria, and the policy of weakening Germany by  
establishing a perpetual principle of division in  
its power, as a source of continual dissentions,  
for her to settle and determine. The peace of  
Westphalia can be considered, therefore, only as  
having established a balance of power in Europe,  
against the house of Austria. It established none  
against France. ‘The danger of France’s ambi-  
tion to the liberties of Europe had not manifested  
itself, perhaps had not existed before that period ;  
but from that day to this it has been the most  
imminent danger to which the liberties of Eu-  
rope have been exposed. Its offensive designs,  
and the defensive measures employed to defeat  
them, have been the source of almostall the wars  
end negociations in Europe,..during the century  
and ahalf elapsed since the peace of Westphalia.  
  
The reason why a secretary in the French de-  
partment of foreign affairs should hold out the  
treaty of Westphalia as the fundamental law, the  
sole source of right, and measure of strength  
for all the powers of Europe, it is nét difficult  
to discern. He gives us, himself, the, reason  
whett he says, that it placed the whole body of  
the German empire under the indispensable ¢tu-  
telaze of France. It placed in the hands of  
France a counterpoise, more than sufficient  
against the power of Austria, without providing  
for the secutity of Europe against France her-  
self, (i oie : ; % .  
  
It is, therefore, true, that before the period of  
  
  
  
‘Sa new empire at the north of Europe: 2, The  
  
the French revolution, the elements of the sys-  
  
tem, upon which the peace of Westphalia ,  
formed and supported, were all, or nearly aj] di  
solved ; but not owing entirely or even brine  
pally to the three causes, alledged by him, 7  
two great bases of that system were, a eligi fmm  
peace in Germany, and a barrier against Aust,  
ihe first has crumbled to dust, because Teligig  
is no longer an object of controversy among;  
tions, and the second has dropped into fragmey  
with the gradual decay of the Austrian power,  
  
It was important to notice both these circysilim th  
stances ;,the exaggerated importance, imputed dal th  
the treaty of Westphalia, and the inaccuracy JM to  
the statement of causes, which destroyed its mer  
cacy, because they serve as the foundation Mitr  
Mr. Hauterive’s subsequent theory, and reas,  
ing. He argues, for instance, that the combi lm  
tion, of almost all Kurope against France, at im ti  
commencement of her revolution, was the nece  
sary consequence, and the most certain proof  
the previous annihilation of the public lay Hl!

tions against all kings, France. now coines;  
tells us, that all that was only springes to ca  
woodcocks, and the real cause of the war wa

In ascribing to the rise and progress of the R  
sian, British and Prussian powers, the dest  
tion of the public law of Europe, Mr. Haute  
  
y  
undoubtedly thought he was promoting the pam «  
tical views of France; the other causes, w }  
contributed to produce the result of disarrang  
  
the system, were no less important, than th  
assigned—but they did not suit  the-auth  
purpose, and would have furnished mate  
proofs against hisarguments. It was natural  
he should omit them.  
  
He sought only. those causes, which it ente  
into his plan to represent, in an unfavourable  
odious light. He affirms, and with some ap  
ance of solicitude repeats, the declaration,  
resentment or animosity has no part ia the re

Before L proceed to remark upon the parti-  
cular causes, alleged by the citizen Hauterive,  
in his book upon the state of France, at the end  
of the eighth year, as having disorganized the  
public law of Europe, it is proper to observe, that  
one of the great apparent purposes of the work,  
is tohold out alure of temptation to the Austri-  
an cabinet. ‘Tosuperficial observation this may  
a&gt;pear to’ indicate a system, contrary to that of  
Favier, but, it is in truth, perfectly reconcilable  
with it. Favier’s doctrine was—dissolve the  
alliance between France and Austria—Let a  
clear, unequivocal preponderance of France  
over Austria be established, cost what it may.  
This has now been accomplished—and from the  
moment, when it was effected, France changes  
not her policy, butherobject. Tosecure her final  
end the more effectually, she thinks it necessa-  
ry to check, to controul, to diminish, by all pos-  
sible means,every other European power which,  
from its extent, might ever threaten to rivalize  
with her own, and, as a means of success, she  
now endeavours to engage the co-operation of  
Austria in this project. ‘l&#x27;hus, when Mr. Hau-  
terive assumes for granted, that the treaty of  
Westphalia founded the whole public law of  
Europe, he might rationally expect that this  
view of things, whether true or false, would, at  
least, suit the interests, and flatter the passions  
of Austria. In his enumeration of causes, which  
contributed to annihilate that system, he men-  
tions only those, which Austria considers with  
enmity and resentment, or with fear and jealou-  
sy. He proposes measures for crippling the  
other three great powers, in which Austria will  
probably feet the strongest stimulus to ccacur ;  
the real point of his preparatory argument is,  
that France and Austria had once given the  
law to Europe; and that it is for their mutual  
  
interest, and jor the benefit of L.urope too, that&quot;  
  
they should do so again. We shall see in ano-  
ther part of the work, that the author considers  
the United States, as forming a part of this po-  
litical system of Europe, and this is the princi-  
pal consideration upon which I shall bestow so  
much time upon the examination of his book.  
We shall, therefore, not be suprised to find  
Mr. Hauterive, in descending to his particulars,  
state, that since the introduction of Russia into  
the European system, the sule principle of her  
government has been the-ambition of unbounded  
aggrandizement, eastward, at the expense of all  
her Asiatic neighbours, and, westward, at that  
of Poland and Sweden. This representation

has too much truth in it. Russia, like her  
neighbours, has constantly been too much actu-  
ated by the ambition of conquest; and by the  
continual series of success she has enjoyed since  
the time of Peter the Great, she has acquired a  
mass of power, which naturally presents an ob-  
stacle to the exercise of legislation for all Eu-  
rope, by the concert of France and Austria.  
Thus far she may, indeed, have contributed to  
disconcert the arrangements made, or prepared  
by the treaty of Westphalia, but when Mr.  
Hauterive asserts that the example of Russia,  
had “ awakened cupidity in the breast of all the  
great powers,” he should, at least, alledge some  
proof for believing that it had ever been laid  
asleep. If it ever slept, it was not at least lull’d  
to repose by the peace of Westphalia, nor had  
it ever yielded to soporifics in the bosom of  
France. Here, indeed, we touch upon one of  
the points in which the author will find it most  
difficult to obtain belief. Itis one of the essen-  
tial purposes of his book to represent the politi-  
cal conduct of France, as having been, at all  
times, a perfect model of moderation, and of  
disinterested generosity. ‘This isa thing, con-  
cerning which, for many centuries, the truth has  
been written in characters of blood, upon the  
annals of Europe, too distinctly and too notori-  
ously for the diplomatic skill of any French se-  
cretary, or under secretary of foreign affairs, to  
efface or to obscure. ‘To argue against it, would  
be to charge the reader with too proiound an  
ignorance of history, or with too great weakness  
of understanding. I send you the book itself,  
that you may see I do not slander the author in  
affirming that such are his assertions; and there  
are other parts of the book, where he renews it  
in a manner which may require animadversion.  
He acknowledges, indeed, that Louis XIV. by  
the arrogance and eclat of his pretensions, did  
weaken the confidence of other nations in this  
disinterested moderation of France. Now it  
will be remembered that the peace of Westpha-  
lia, and even that of the Pyrenees, were made  
during the minority of this same Louis XIV.  
and prepared the way for those pretensions, for  
that cupidity, with which he continued for half  
a century to be the scourge of mankind. ‘The  
great powers had, therefore, no occasion for the  
example of Russia, to awaken their cupidity.  
In passing to the observations upon the rise  
and progress of the Prussian power, we remark,  
that Mr. Hauterive states four consequences as  
having resulted from it, all of which are solvea-  
ble into this, that it has deprived France of the  
advantage of intervening im all the dissentions  
of the German empire, and settling them at the  
pleasure of her @bitration. That the Germans  
have preferred the paronage of Prussia, to the  
disinterested, magnanimous decisions of France.  
That the constitution of the empire has been  
interpreted by the Germans themselves, and  
not Submitted to the construction of a third par-  
ty. All this, to a certain degree, is true—and  
this is certainly the most powerfully operative  
of the causes adduced by him as dissolvents of  
the system created by the peace of Westphalia ;  
but in altering the comparative masses of power,  
it produced no alteration of the public law, and  
if the minor states of Germany relied more up-  
on the protection of Prussia, than upon the  
suarantee of France, for defence against en-  
croachments from another quarter, the disposi-  
tion was inspired, not by any alteration of rights,  
but by the different confidence of the efficacy of  
the means. Here, we find Mr. Hauterive mak-  
  
ing his most pointed address to the passion,  
the Austrian government. ‘To every tithes  
than an Austrian reader, the exchange of  
French for a Prussian patronage will appear p  
evil ; to every German, other than a subject g  
Austria, it will appear a great blessing, p  
nothing can be so odious to an Austrian, as jh,  
power of Prussia, and nothing so Soothing  
his inclinations as a prospect of checking ay,  
reducing it. This explains to us why the a  
thor, contrary to the testimony of history, r  
presents Prussia as having first set the exam  
of hoarding up a public treasure and of keepin  
a standing army. ‘These were the instrumen,  
of the Prussian aggrandizement, and in th;  
chapter is insinuated the propriety of a genepy  
concert among nations to make them jn  
fectual—to circumscribe, by general consep  
the internal right of every single state, to leyy  
troops or fill coffers. 7  
If it were possible still to doubt, whethersug,  
suggestions as these were thrown out mereh  
for the sake of the effect they might produce yy  
on Austrian feelings, all hesitation must be re  
moved, by the passage [now shall quote for yo  
meditation. It immediately follows the pas

‘¢‘ These statesmen thought force was bett  
than policy ; that courage was above wisdom;  
they thought it beneath them to reflect befo  
they determined on rushing into extremes  
that war was a nobler guardian of rights tha  
negociation; they listened only to the voice of  
distrust, of jealousy, of vanity ; and, in short,  
to come to the true source of the evil, they too  
a pleasure in forming to themselves a monstrow  
idea of the pre-eminence of France: they des  
pised her diplomatic councils: they disdained  
her support; and when, afterwards, by the  
effect of their imprudent combinations, th  
found those states, whose rapid growth, their  
blind improvidence had, as if purposely fos  
tered, become formidable rivals by their pre  
tensions, and dangerous neighbours by th  
indefatigable activity of their views, they laid  
to the account of France their dangers and  
their losses, as if France could have protec  
ed them, when they spurned her support, and  
misconstrued the wisdom of her councils, or,  
as if she ought to have done so, when the  
time at which her advice and assistance could  
have been useful to them was past.  
  
‘¢ A profound discussion of all chose objects,

those, who wish to verily what I just said, to  
study the history of the time, when the first  
links of the chain of relations which connett-  
ed the states of Europe together, were broken:  
they will see whether France did not always  
seasonably unveil to her friends the secret  
views of those princes, who projected to ag  
grandize themselves at the expense of those  
whom they had the address of associating to  
their views: whether, from the commenct-

unattackable situation, been always interested  
in the equipoise and immutability of the ex-

sagly title, :ormed by thethen elector of Bran-

iowledge the first king of Prussia as such until  
ye peace Of Utrecht, It is likewise true, that  
,e emperor consented tothat acknowledgment,  
fore the war of the Spanish succession began  
but the price of this consent was, a stipula-  
Mion by the elector to furnish ten thousand men  
othe allies in that war. Itis no wonder, there-  
ye, that France negociated against it, with  
{ystria, or that she urged the consequences  
ich might result froman increase of the Prus-  
“n consideration, and prove injurious to Aus-  
ria herself. Yet, in this instance, France was  
got actuated by her unattackable situation, or by  
her disinterested magnanimity. Her motive of  
iniversal operation, doubtless, was to prevent  
the aggrandizement of any other power than her  
own; but her immediate inducement was to  
prevent the co-operation of the elector, with the  
Jes; for which purpose, at the same time  
vhile she negociated with Austria against the  
yxknowledgment of the Prussian royalty, she  
ygociated with the elector for it, and was as  
ady to grant it for the sake of the Prussian al-  
jjance,as the emperor himself, From the peace  
of Utrecht to the commencement of the revolu-  
tion, France was engaged in four wars, not one  
of which was for the purpose of maintaining the  
immutability of existing relations, or of prevent-  
ing changes to the detriment of some, and for  
the benefit of others.  
But it is in the considerations upon the rise  
nd progress of the maritime and commercial  
stem, the source of prosperity to Kugland,  
that the author abandons himself, without re-  
serve, to all the bitterness of his heart. In all  
the other statements, are perceivable, the inspi-  
tions of national vanity, envy, and jealousy,  
but in the composition of this picture, aii the  
furies of hatred combine to mix their blackest  
colours.  
Setting aside, however, the feelings and pas-  
tions of the author, his view of the consequen-  
andga ces produced by the English navigation act, de-  
ect serves serious attention. Here, as in every

such distant foresight into futurity. - The per-  
sonal resentments of St. John, the animosities  
of the parliament against the states general of  
Holland, as well as against some of the English  
colonics, which had favoured the royal cause,  
and their jealousy of the army, at the head of  
which was Cromwell, first produced the navi-  
gation act. There is no reason to suppose that  
its authors were aware of its remote and perma-  
nent consequences, more than all the rest of  
Europe. The Dutch, alone, considered it as  
hostile, by its immediate application to them-  
selves; but the influence it was destined to pro-  
duce upon the prosperity of England, and upon  
the history of Europe, was foreseen by no man.  
That it made England prosper, is now univer-  
sally-recognized.. That ‘prosperity has made  
England sometimes proud, arrogant, and op-  
pressive to other nations, anxious to engross all  
commerce to herself, and ever apt to encroach  
upon that of others, is true. To guard and de-  
fend themselves by pacific and lawful concert  
against this dispostion, is the right and interest  
of the other commercial nations, but they must,  
above all things, be cautious not to substitute,  
instead of these. principles of self-detence, the  
inextinguishable virulence, and unbounded ran-  
cour, instigated by the feelings of the deadliest

ing out of  
  
C4 2&gt;  
ye se  
  
the French revolution there existed no public  
law in Europe, and we have there alleged the  
  
rounds upon which we consider him as having  
failed in the proof of this proposition. ‘The se-  
cond chapter is intituled, ** General considera-  
tions upon the relative situation of France,” and  
its object is, to prove, that a system of public  
law for Europe és necessary, and that France  
must take an active and powerful part in its for-  
mation. The method observed in this part ot  
the work has exposed or enabled the autiior to  
run over again much of the ground already tra-  
versed in the first chapter, and t&gt; renew the  
question there discussed. He gives the same  
solution to it again, but here, his infallible proof  
is, that England, during the war, has openly  
professed the desire to destroy the maritime  
power of France, and succeeded in drawing ail  
the powers of Europe into her design. But  
this wish of England had never been a secret te  
the other powers, who knew, pertfectly well,  
that the destruction of each others maritime  
power had, for more than a century, been one  
great object of policy, both to France and Eng-&#x27;  
land. That this desire burns at this day, with  
increased violence, in the breast of France, the  
citizen Hauterive’s book provesbeyond a doubt.  
It is not the interest of the other European pow-  
ers, and they are, and always have been fully  
sensible of it, that either France or England  
should succeed in accomplishing their purposes.  
They have all seen, with regret, that the ruin of  
the French navy was one of the necessary, un-  
avoidable evils, which must result from that  
frantic war, into which France plunged herself  
against them; but when, by the combination of  
all their forces, they were unable to defend  
themselves, theit own possessions, their own  
fire-sides, against her assault, how was it possi-  
ble for them to take under their protection, the  
interests of her navy ?  
  
Through the whole of Mr. Hauterive’s book,  
he assumes, as an established, and undisputed  
fact, that the first coalition was a league of all  
Europe, at the instigation of England, and ut-  
terly unprovoked on the part of France, for her  
subjection and dismemberment. This is a fa-  
vourite point of view to the French diplomatic  
  
writers, since the revolution, and having beer |  
  
driven from all the other posts of their reason-  
ing, they return to this, after the thousandth  
solemn and full refutation, with as much confi-  
dence, as if it had never been disputed. Like  
all the rest, it is false and hollow. England did  
not instigate the first coalition against France ;  
nor take any part in the war, until the second  
year after it began. | These facts are suscepti-  
ble of easy proof, sufficient to satisfy any impar-  
tial mind, and I hope, at some future period, to  
offer you something further, to shew them in a  
conspicuous light. For the present, as the citi-  
zen Hauterive takes his statement for granted,  
without uttering a syllable in support of a point,  
so fundamental to his whole argument, I shall  
equally content myself, with stating directly the  
contrary, and leave the proof to the candid re-  
collection, or investigation of the reader.  
  
In pronouncing, that a public law is necessary  
for Europe, Mr. Hauterive will not be contra-  
dicted by the enemies of the French revolution:  
he*only contradicts all the loudest, and most  
popular doctrines of the men, who accomplished  
it. But, before he can persuade the rest of the  
world, that France must give that law, it is to  
be hoped, they will duly weigh the grounds,  
upon which he urges so strange an opinion

** Public law, (says he) between nations, who  
hive communications of neighbourhood, or of  
commerce, with each other, consists of rela-  
tions, if not permanent, at least perfectly cacer-  
tained. -These relations express the rights and  
the duties of every state; they insure to all,  
known and authorised means for preserving and  
cultivating the elements of their riches and pow-  
er; they open, before every one of them, a free  
career for the display of their faculties ; they pre-  
vent the strong from intimidating the weak, and  
guard the sober against the turbulence of the  
mad.”  
  
It is evident, from this passage, connected  
with the contents of the first chapter, that, by  
public law, the author means the law of nations.  
That he wishes to represent treaties, as the only  
proper source of this, and that the principles  
prescribed by nature, and the maxims establish-  
ed by custom, must all yield to this conventional  
law, to be dictated by France, and inspired by  
the exclusive spirit of her interest and conve-  
nience.  
  
«¢ Every nation, (he observes) excepting those  
which are tormented by the blind passion of ag-  
grandizement, is interested in the existence of  
such a system of common safety, and of mutual  
guaranty: but none is so much interested in its  
establishment and permanence as France.”  
For, besides the disinterested impartiality, for  
which France has always been famous, she can,  
henceforth, have no motive for desiring war.  
Her sources of prosperity are all within herself.  
The acquisitions, which she has just made, and  
which she will certainly keep, place her in an un-  
attackable position, and she 1s too wise, not to  
know, that further conqutsts would weaken, in-  
stead of strengthening her.  
  
‘But, (adds he) if, when the rights of France  
are once secured, the powers of Europe have  
nothing to dread from her, there is no other  
great power, with regard to which it would be  
proper for them to go to sleep with the same se-  
curity.”?&gt; One can hardly avoid smiling at the  
bonhommie of this assertion, and of the serious  
argument consequent upoa it, to prove, (though  
still with the discretion of avoiding names) that  
Austria, Russia, England, and Prussia are all  
ambitious from principle, and in their essence ;  
all to be watched with incessant jealousy by  
each other, and by the rest of Europe; all to be  
consideredas unappeasable enemies to the peace  
and safety of the world, while the full measure  
of unbounded confidence is to be given without  
a scruple to France—to France, the moderate,  
the glorious, the secure—the magnanimous pro-  
tectress of public law.  
  
It is indeed a curious circumstance, and so  
much deserves our attention that I venture once  
more to call itinto your notice, that, after all the  
French revolutionary legislators at home, and  
negociators abroad, had held up, for many years,  
the doctrine, that the law of nature was the only  
law of nations; had spurned at all usages, dis-  
dained all! authorities, trampled upon al! treaties,  
and solved every right and every duty into the  
imprescriptible princ&#x27;ples of nature, and the un-  
alienable rights of min, here shou&#x27;d come in  
these latter days, a new diplomatic French  
teacher, to tell the world, that the whole Euro-  
pean lay of nations was founded upon the trea-  
ty of Westvhalia, and as that is annihilated,  
  
another law of nations must be made by treaty,  
in its stead; not bottomed upon the law of na-  
ture, and the rizhts of man, but upon princi-  
ples of watchiul jealousy against other powers,

THE PORT FOLIO.  
  
and slumbering confidence in France. It re-  
minds me of astory, Doctor Franklin often used  
to tell of a French lady, whom he once heard  
say, in conversation with her sister—*“ I don’t  
know how it happens, sister, that there is only  
one person in the world, who is ahways in the  
right, and that is myself.” !  
  
If, for the refutation of such a doctrine, any  
thing more can be required, than fairly to state  
it, the remark is obvious, that a public law, like  
that contemplated by Hauterive, is so far from  
being necessary, that it is utterly impracticable ;  
and if it were otherwise, would be, in the high-  
est degree unjust: in fine, that if it were both  
practicable and reconcileable with justice, it  
must be founded upon a mutual temper of ac-  
commodation on the part of ai/ the great pow-  
ers, not upon partial favour towards one, and  
dread of all the rest.  
  
To shew this in the clearest light, let us fur-  
ther examine in the author’s book, what he  
means by his necessary system of public law.  
‘* For all the great powers of Europe, and  
against each of them, excepting France, (says  
he) a system is necessary, which may define, in  
a precise manner, their geozraphical boundaries,  
the extent of their duties, the Limits of their rights.  
The circumscribing lines must be clearly ex-  
pressed ; their extension must be made percep-  
tible to every one, nay liable to be foreseen  
when undertaken, before the damage is felt.  
At the same time, a system is necessary, which  
may indicate to all the governments of Europe,  
the true circumstances of their relative situa-  
tion, which may teach them which are the na-  
tions, whom the nature of their relations points  
out to them as friends, as enemies, as neutrals ;  
avhich, in the calm of peace, may prevent them  
from beholding, with the same eye, the progress  
or the decline of any given state; which, in war,  
may guard them against the errors of an zncon-  
stderate apart and preserve them from the  
mistakes of an unenlightened predilection.”  
  
Upon these words, no comment can be neces-  
sary. I only beg you, sir, to weigh their full  
force, and then say, whether the system which  
they urge as necessary, were not a presumptu-  
ous attempt to render perpetual and unalterable,  
what God, by nature, has made changeable and  
transitory? whether it would not be, in the po-  
litical world, as absurd an experiment, as that  
of king Canute, when he commanded the tide  
  
not to come and wet his feet? and whether, if  
it were possible to suppose it could ever be ac-  
complished, it would not be the most entire and  
unqualified system of subjection and slavery,  
that ever was imposed upon mankind.  
  
And what are the grounds, upon which this  
public avowal of a pretension on the part of  
France, to give an all-comprehensive law of na-  
tions, to the world are maintained? Her disin-  
terested impartiality as proved in history !—  
Her safe and unattackable situation!—And her  
principled aversion against conquest. and ag-  
grandizement !  
  
It was acustom in Lilliput, .as captain Gulli-  
ver tells us, that whenever some execution, re-  
markaly cruel and tyrannical had taken place,  
the government immediately issued a proclama-  
tion to the people, largely descanting upon its  
owa extreme gentleness and lenity. ‘his prac-  
tice has not been forgotten in republican France,  
and the period when the consuls announced to  
the nation, that they had just added, by con-  
quest, one sixth to their territories, theirstrength  
and their population, has a most happy coinci

aversion to conquest, and disinterested impar  
tiality.  
  
If indeed the project which is unfolded in  
this book were effected ; if, by the force of her  
arms, and the skill of her diplomacy, she could  
prevail upon all Europe to acquiesce ina law,  
made by her, defining the boundaries, the rights,  
the duties of every nation, prescribing to every  
people whom they must consider as friends, a  
enemies, as neutrals, controuling alike the pr  
gress of one state, and the decline of another,  
guarding against the indifference of ,every ally,  
and preserving from predilections im favour of  
her enemies, she could have no further occasion  
for conquest; the world would be prostrate at  
her feet. She might then leave the details of  
administration, the odious task of squeezing out  
the blood of the people to satisfy her insatiable  
demands to the natives of the respective coun  
tries, and content herself with wielding her iron  
sceptre alike over them all.  
  
This is no imaginary picture—The author  
concludes the chapter, by telling us, that the ba  
sis of the new French law of nations is already  
laid—that the treaties of France, with Holland,  
Spain, Switzerland, and some other Italian  
States, shew the foundation of France’s federa  
tive and: defensive systeme—the treaties with  
Prussia, her neutral system; and the treaties  
with Austria, with their subsequent rupture, her  
system ofhostility. The consideration of these  
  
three points is pursued in the following chap-  
-ters, the examination of which. I shall reservé

The third chapter of the book upon the state  
of France, concerns the relative sttuation ¢  
France, with regard to her allies. It begins  
with a magnificent eulogium upon that country,  
for her great exertions in former ages, against  
the domineering ambition of the court of  
Rome, of the Venetian republic, and of the  
house of Austria successively. There canbe  
no doubt but that the efforts of France have  
always been directed to pull down every other  
great power, and to increase her own—the  
mere common place of vulgar policy ; but it re.  
quires more ingenuity than even the writer!  
examine possesses, to disguise it thoroughly un  
der the mask of disinterested magnanimity.  
  
‘© The thirty years war (says he), and the  
peace of Westphalia, put an end to the perpetual  
anxiety of all the other European states for  
their zndependence of the Austrian power ; and  
proved both to the friends and enemies of Frantt,  
that her policy was guided only by views of gent  
ral interest, and common guarantee.” f  
  
‘Lhis is the text, upon which he indulges his  
extatic admiration of cardinal Richelieu’s sys  
tem, in a comment, where every single instance  
he adduces, is in the most notorious violationof  
historical truth. Can it be conceived, thata mat,  
at this day, should have the courage to aflirm,  
that in the 30 years war, ‘¢ France often had t0  
support alone the burden of war—That she con  
quered the peace—That the treaty will forever  
testify her fidelity to her friends, her justice  
towards neutrals, her generosity towards her  
enemies—That she liberated Portugal and Hol.  
land from the Austrian yoke, and secured the  
independence of Switzerland—That she placed  
Sweden in the rank of preponderating powéls  
—That she (France! the cardinal de Riche  
lieu!) placed religious liberty, in the numbet  
of primitive r ghts, which belong to all nations:  
Jassed religious intolerance, that great pretet!  
‘or the ambition of princes, in thé Europea)  
code, in the list of political crimes ; and pointe  
‘t out thenceforth as treason against humanity ;  
as one of the iuighest infractions of public law:

Yes sir, such is the historical accuracy of a  
gork, almost official from the present French  
overnment, summoning all Europe, and the  
United States, to acquiesce in a new system of  
yblic law, commenced, and to be completed by  
France.  
  
It cannot be necessary to enter into details  
of refutation upon these passages ; but, with  
regard to the share of France in the thirty  
ears war, and the peace of Westphalia, I beg  
leave to make here a short quotation from a  
German historian—an historian of eminent fame,  
and distinguished for his strong attachment to  
that party in Germany, with.which France, in  
the thirty years war, wes allied; for his strong  
feelings against the ambition of Austria—and  
for his ardour in the cause of religious and poli-  
tical liberty.  
  
« At length (after the death of Gustavus Adol-  
phus) the period had arrived, to which Riche-  
jeu bad looked forward with ardent impatience.  
Nothing but the utter impossibility of saving  
themselves in any otherway, could prevail upon  
the protestant states of Germany, to support the  
pretensions of France upon Alsace. This utter-  
most necessity now occurred. France was in-  
dispensable ; and dear was the price she exact-  
ed for the active part she took henceforth in the  
German war. Full of splendour and glory, she  
now entered upon the political theatre. Oxen-  
stiern, to whom it cost very little to lavish away  
the rights and possessions of Germany, had al-  
ready ceded to Richelieu, the Imperial fortress  
of Philipsburg, and the other places demanded ;  
and now the German protestant princes sent, in  
their names, a separate embassy, to place Alsace,  
the fortress of Brisach (which was first tobe  
taken), and all the strong places on the Upper-  
Rhine, the keys of Germany, under French pro-  
tection. What French protection meant, had  
been seen in the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and  
Verdun, which France had for centuries pro-  
tected, even against their rightful owners.—  
Now was the moment of promise arrived, to  
the hopes of France, of adding likewise Alsace  
toher extensive possessions; aud, by sharing the  
Spanish Netherlands, soon afterwards with the  
Hollanders, to make the Rhine her natural  
boundary against Germany. Zhus shamefully  
were the rights of Germany sold by German  
itates to this faithless, rapacious power ; who, un-  
dtr the mask of a disinterested friendship, only  
itrove for aggrandizem ent; andwhile, with brazen  
front, she assumed the honourable appellation of a  
protectress, was only thinking how to spread her  
net, and provide for herself in the general con-  
fusion.” Schiller’s History of the thirty years  
War.— Book TV.  
  
Here yousee, sir, something more than vague  
  
and general declamation, to form an opinion o!  
  
the French system, so much extolled by the  
French pamphleteer. France wanted to get  
hold of Alsace, and the keys of Germany—But  
toget at the same time the reputation of disinter-  
«sted impartiality, she took them only as to pro-  
tect them; when they were once in her posses-  
tion, she knew how to keep them, and accord-  
ingly secured all she could of them to herself,  
atthe peace. This is what the under secretary  
would smooth over, by saying, that ‘* she claim-  
td an increase of territory, only because it was  
hecessary for her safety, and to secure the de-  
lence of her frontiers.”  
  
It would be easy to pursue, step by step, the  
whole of his historical deduction, from the peace  
of Westphalia downwards, and to prove the false-

hood of it by testimony, equally irrefragable ;  
you may judge of it from the frequency, with  
which the same motive of providing, by an in-  
crease of territory, for France’s safety, and the  
defence of her frontiers, recurs to the author’s  
pen. In the first chapter he had argued, that  
from the commencement of the eighteenth cen-  
tury, France’s situation was unattackable ; but  
here he tells us, that the sole object, for which  
Louis XIV. carried on the war of the Spanish  
succession, was the safety of France, and the  
acquisition of some slight advantages. ‘This  
purpose of adding safety upon safety, to what  
is already vaunted as perfectly safe, is the only  
contrivance the author’s ingenuity could furnish  
him, for justifying the expunszve tmpulstons ot  
France, from the reign of Richelieu, to that of  
Talleyrand ; from the peace of Munster, to the  
peace of Luneville.  
  
To a writer, who assumes so large a licence  
with history, it could not be difficult to assert,  
that the sole system of the enemies of France,  
at the commencement of the war, was an uni-  
versal combination of the four quarters of the  
globe against her alone. He makes no scruple  
of descending to particulars, and to affirm,  
among other things, that the United States were  
formally invited to join the coalition. This is  
not the most flagrantly false statement in an enu-  
meration, where Turkey is mentioned as one of  
the powers, who actually did suffer themselves  
to be drawn into the league ; but I mention it  
because its falsehood will be more universally  
known in America, and therefore it may better,  
than any other, serve as a specimen to show  
what credit the author’s veracity deserves.  
  
This imaginary universal combination against  
France, could cost no more to dissolve than to  
form ; and its inventor has made cheap of it,  
since it was only brought forward to contrast  
with the federative system of France. This, ac-  
cording to him, is admirably calculated for con-  
sistency, order, justice and stability ; and no less  
admirably calculated to preserve the balance of  
Europe. It is founded upon two simple princi-  
ples: “* 1. That the object of every alliance  
must be, in peace, to guarantee the permanency  
of the existing relations, and in war, to concert  
the defence of those relations, against the un-  
dertakings of the commonenemy. 2. The ob-  
ject of every alliance, whether in peace or war,  
must be to guarantee the political interests  
of the continent, from the exaggerated ascendan-  
cy of the maritime interests.”  
  
These principles are vaguely expressed, but  
the author himself gives explanations, which  
enable his reader to understand precisely their  
meaning. He might have solved the two into  
one, by saying, that the object of every alliance  
must be, exc/usively, to promote the views and  
interests of France, and to effect the ruin of Eng-  
land. This is what the author is cautious not  
to avow, but its evidence bursts out in every  
page of his book. It is not immaterial to  
know this, because here is the place where a _for-  
mal summons to the United States is introduced,  
to forsake their present federative system and  
adopt that of France. ‘This passage is of so  
much importance that it is fit you should have  
it, as literal as translation can make it.  
  
“ The basis of the maritime system of  
France, are the alliance of Holland, of Spain,  
of Liguria, ‘The object of these alliances is  
known: it can give no umbrage to any one, and  
France is determined to defend, with all her  
means, present and future, the common righ  
  
  
  
235  
  
and interests which are derived from it. Itis  
for the maritime nations of Europe, who are not  
satisfied with the situation, in which the con-  
tradictions of their present federative system  
place them, to chuse between the inconveni-  
encies and advantages of that situation, and the  
advantages, and inconveniencies, which the fe-  
dcrative system of France presents. I need  
not say that this appeal is addressed, first to the  
Porte, the States of Barbary, Naples and Por-  
tugal, and secondly to Denmark, Sweden, and  
the United States.”  
  
‘The appeal is made with an appearance of  
moderation, and with a seeming disposition to  
leave the choice of systems, to the specified  
powers themselves. ‘The means of positive  
compulsion, are not so effectual in the hands of  
France, with regard to her maritime, as with  
regard to her continental system. The basis  
of this too, our author says, are laid, and he  
makes an appeal here too, to the neighbours of  
France, to form alliances with her: but here  
all the shew of candour is abandoned, all the  
liberty of choice forbidden, and no alternative  
  
with the French system, and devastation by  
French armies. ‘ France (says he) will sub-  
stitute military dispositions, instead of federa-  
tive dispositions, and if those princes will be  
deaf to the voice of interest, which urges them  
to ally themselves with her, she will ally herself  
de facto with the countries which they may be  
incapable of defending, and make herself aux-  
iliaries of all the means of subsistence and de-  
fence, which any of the territories that her ar-  
mies may occupy will furnish.”  
  
One of the most remarkable characteristics  
of the author, whose labours I am investigating,  
is a singular felicity of expression, which you  
will find very conspicuous in this passage.  
Thus, cver-running a country with innumera-  
ble armies, letting loose upon the harvests of  
the cottager, and the labours of the citizen, eve-  
ry harpy of plunder, and every fiend of desola-  
tion; pressing out, with the screws of military  
execution, drop by drop, the blood and sweat of  
igdustrious poverty, to supply the deficiencies  
of the French finances, is here termed in *‘ words  
that breathe, and thoughts that burn;”” France’s  
allying herself with a country de facto; giving  
to understand with an energy, of which the wri-  
ter himself perhaps was not conscious, that the  
friendship and the hospitality of France, are in  
their effects so nearly the same, as to be best  
designated by the same appellation.  
  
The great objection for those powers, to  
whom the freedom of pursuing the system which  
they themselves deem best, against their accep-  
tance of the I’rench invitations, is, that besides  
the violation of their public faith, pledged in  
former treaties, the principle of reciprocity, of  
mutual interests, and egual rights, is not inclu-  
ded ; but on the contrary, is entirely excluded  
from the fundamental maxims, upon which they  
are told, by this author, that all the treaties of  
France are to be founded. ‘To feel the force  
of this observation, please to apply the author’s  
two principles, tothe alliance, actually extantbe-  
tween France and Holland. When this alli-  
ance was concluded, the existing relations of  
| Holland with France were those of a conguered  
country with its conquerors. If the object of  
the alliance was to preserve and defend these  
  
relations, it might very well suit the interests of  
France ; but what became of those of Holland?  
  
  
  
The second principle gives the Lest answer to  
  
left the powers in question, but compliance,

this question. An alliance azainst the influ-  
ence of the maritime interests, is undoubtedly  
against the first and most important interests of  
Holland, a state almost exclusively commercial,  
and whose existence, much more certainly than  
that of England, depends upon the prosperity  
oftrade. ‘Thus the alliance of Holland with  
France, upon the principles of this writer, is  
an alliance against her own interests, to pre-  
serve her as a conquest of France ; the statement  
I believe perfectly just, but it is not adapted to  
inspire other states with the ambition of imita-  
ting the example.

of Sciences, and a Jewish Literary Jour-

or the Sketches of the ‘Times, Vol, Il.

racter, have subscribed and published a  
letter to MgT eller. Provost of the Upper

ment which has the superintendence of

of Fesuas Christ ; and provided they may  
be admitted to participate in all the

confession of faith would be something  
less than Unitarianism, but approaching  
nearly to it. ‘They ask M. Teller’s ad-

that they do well to-believe as much of

ought to entitle them to share the civil
