d to in my letter of this date.  
A proper organisation for the troops of the UStates is a principal one. In proportion as the policy of the Country is adverse to extensive military establishments ought to be our care to render the principles of our military system as perfect as possible, and our endeavouring to turn to the best account such force as we may at any time have on foot, and to provide an eligible standard for the augmentations to which particular emergencies may compel a resort.  
The organisation of our military force will it is conceived be much improved, by modelling it on the following plan:  
Let a Regiment of Infantry, composed as at present of two batalions and each batalion of five Companies, consist of these Officers and men (viz) one Colonel two Majors, a first and second, one Adjutant one Quarter Master and one Pay Master each of whom shall be a Lieutenant, one surgeon and one surgeon’s Mate, Ten Captains, Ten first and ten second lieutenants, besides the three Lts abovementioned, Two Cadets with the pay and emoluments of serjeants, Two serjeant Majors, Two Quarter Master serjeants, Two Chief Musicians first and second, Twenty other Musicians forty serjeants forty Corporals and Nine hundred and Twenty privates.  
Let a Regiment of Drago[o]ns consist of Ten Troops making five squadrons and of these Officers and men (viz)—One Colonel, two Majors a first and second, one Adjutant one Quarter Master and one Pay Master each of whom shall be a Lieutenant, one surgeon and one surgeons Mate, ten Captains, ten first and ten second Lieutenants, besides the three Lieutenants abovementioned, five Cadets with the pay and emoluments of serjeants, Two serjeant Majors, two Quarter Master serjeants Two Chief Musicians first and second, Ten other musicians Forty serjeants forty corporals and Nine hundred and Twenty privates; the privates including to each Troop one sadler, one blacksmith and one boot Maker.  
Let a Regiment of Artillery consist of four batalions each batalion of four Companies and of these Officers and men (viz) one Colonel, four Majors, one Adjutant one Quarter Master and one Pay Master each of whom shall be a Lieutenant, one surgeon and Two surgeons Mates Sixteen Captains, sixteen first and sixteen second Lieutenants, besides the three Lieutenants abovementioned Thirty two cadets, with the pay &amp; emoluments of sergeants, four serjeant Majors, four Quarter Master serjeants sixty four serjeants sixty four Corporals one Chief Musician &amp; ten other Musicians Eight hundred and Ninety six privates including to each Company Eight Artificers.  
The principal reasons for this organisation will be briefly suggested.  
It will be observed that the proportion of men to Officers in the Infantry &amp; cavalry is considerably greater than by the present establishment.  
This presents in the first place the advantage of œconomy. By the proportional decrease of the officers, savings will result in their pay, subsistence and the transportation of their baggage. The last circumstance by lessening the impediments of an army, is also favourable to the celerity of its movements.  
The command of each officer will become more respectable. This will be an inducement to respectable men to accept military appointments—and it will be an incentive to exertion among those who shall be engaged, by upholding that justifiable pride which is a necessary ingredient in the military spirit.  
A company will then admit of eligible subdivision into platoons sections and demi-sections each of a proper front.  
Each batalion will then be of the size judged proper for a manœvering column in the field—and it is that portion of an army which in the most approved systems of Tactics is destined to fulfil this object. A batalion ought neither to be too unwieldy for rapid movements nor so small as to multiply too much the subdivisions, and render each incapable either of a vigorous impulse or resistance.  
The proportion of officers to men ought not to be greater than is adequate to the due management and command of them. A careful examination of this point will satisfy every judge, that the number now proposed will be equal to both. This conclusion will be assisted by the idea that our fundamental order, in conformity with that of the nations of Europe generally, ought to place our infantry in three ranks; to oppose to an enemy who shall be in the same order an equal mass for attack or defence.  
These remarks explain summarily the chief reasons for the most material of the alterations which is suggested.  
But it is not the intention to recommend a present augmentation of the number of rank and file to the proposed standard. It is only wished that it may be adopted as that of the war-establishment. The Regiments which have been authorised may continue in this respect upon the footing already prescribed; leaving the actual augmentation to depend on events which may create a necessity for the increase of our force.  
The other alterations recommended have relation rather to systematic propriety, than to very important military ends.  
The term Lt Col in our present establishment has a relative signification without any thing in fact to which it relates. It was introduced during our revolutionary war, to facilitate exchanges of prisoners, as our then enemy united the grade of Colonel with that of General. But the permanent form of our military system ought to be regulated by principle not by the changeable and arbitrary arrangement of a particular nature. The title of Colonel, which has greater respectability, is more proper for the commander of a Regiment; because it does not, like the other, imply a relation having no existence.  
The term ensign is changed into that of lieutenant as well because the latter from usage has additional respectability offering an inducement to desireable candidates, as because the former, in its origin, signified a standard bearer, &amp; supposed that each company had a distinct standard. This in practice has ceased to be the case and for a variety of good reasons a standard of colours to each batalion of infantry is deemed sufficient. This standard is intended to be confided to a cadet in whom it may be expected to excite an emulation and exertion. The multiplication of grades, inconvenient with regard to exchanges, is thus avoided.  
In the cavalry it is proper to allow a standard to each squadron consisting of two troops and hence it is proposed to have five cadets to a Regiment.  
The nature of the Artillery service, constantly in detachment, renders it proper to compose a Regiment of a greater number of batalions than the other corps. This our present establishment has recognised. But there is now a disorderly want of uniformity; one regiment being composed of four batalions the other of three. The same organisation ought to be common to all. The diminution of the number of musicians, while it will save expence, is also warranted by the peculiar nature of the Artillery service. They answer in this corps few of the purposes which they fulfil in the Infantry.  
The existing laws contemplate and with good reason that the aids of General Officers except of the Commander in Chief &amp; the officers in the department of Inspection shall be taken from the Regiments. But they do not provide that when so taken their places in the Regiments shall be supplied by others. It is conceived that this ought to be the case. The principles of the establishment suppose, for example, that three officers to a company of a given number are the just and due proportion. If when an officer be taken from a company to fill one of the stations alluded to his place be not filled by another, so that the number of Officers to a company may remain the same, it must follow that the company will be deficient in officers. It is true that the number of a company is continually diminishing, but it diminishes in officers as well as men; and it is not known that the proportion is varied. Practice in every institution ought to conform to principle, or there will result more or less of disorder. An army is in many respects a machine; of which the displacement of any of the organs, if permitted to continue, injures its symetry and energy and leads to disorder and weakness. The increase of the number of rank and file, while it strengthens the reasons for replacing the officers who may be removed will more than compensate in point of œconomy for the addition of officers by the substitution. This may be reduced to the test of calculation. But though the place of an officer in his Regiment ought to be supplied upon any such removal, he ought not to lose his station in the Regiment; but ought to rank and rise as if he had continued to serve in it.  
  
The provision that Aides de Camp and the officers of Inspection shall be drawn from the line of the army is not restricted as to grades. There ought to be such a restriction. The Aides of Major Generals ought not to be taken from a rank superior to that of Captain, nor those of the Brigadiers from a rank superior to that of first Lieutenant. The Inspectors ought in like manner to be limited, those of Brigades to the rank of Captain, those of Divisions to that of Major. This will guard against the multiplication of the superior grades by removals to fill such stations.

 is a point of the greatest consequence. It is conceived that these rules are the most convenient that can be devised; namely that all officers shall rise in the Regiments to which they respectively belong up to the rank of a Major inclusively—that afterwards they shall rise in the line of the army at large; with the limitation

The Adjutant General the aids and secretaries of the commander in Chief to be likewise distinguished by a white plume.  
The uniform of the other General officers to be a blue coat with yellow buttons gold epaulets, the lining and facings of buff—the under cloaths the same with those of the Commander in Chief. The Major General to be distinguished by two silver stars in each epaulette and except the Inspector General by a black and white plume, the black below. The Brigadier to be distinguished by one silver star on each epaulette, and by a red and white plume, the red below. The aids of all General Officers who are taken from Regiments, and the Officers of inspection to wear the uniforms of the Regiments from which they are taken. The aids to be severally distinguished by the like plumes, which are worn by the General Officers to whom they are respectively attached.  
The uniform of the aids and Secretaries of the Commander in Chief when not taken from Regiments to be a blue coat with yellow buttons and gold epaulettes buff lining and facings the same under cloaths with the Commander in Chief.  
The Inspector General his aids and the officers of Inspection generally to be distinguished by a blue plume. The Quarter Master General and other military officers in his department to be distinguished by a Green Plume.  
The uniform of the Infantry and Artillery to be a blue Coat with white buttons and red facings white under cloath and cocked hats: The Coats of the Infantry to be lined with white, of the artillery with red. The uniform of the Cavalry to be a Green Coat with white buttons lining &amp; facings—white vest and breeches with helmet Caps.  
Each Colonel to be distinguished by two Epaulets, each Major by one Epaulette on the right shoulder and a strap on the left. All the field Officers, except as above, and the Regimental staff to wear red plumes.  
Captains to be distinguished by an Epaulette on the right shoulder —Lieutents. by one on the left shoulder—Cadets by a strap on the right shoulder. The Epaulettes and straps of the Regimental Officers to be of silver.  
Serjeant Majors and Quarter Master serjeants to be distinguished by two red worsted Epaulettes—serjeants by a like Epaulette on the right shoulder—Corporals by a like Epaulette on the left shoulder. The flank companies to be distinguished by red wings on the shoulder.  
The Coats of the Musicians to be of the colours of the facings of the corps to which they severally belong. The Chief Musicians to wear two white worsted Epaulettes.

The Commissioned Officers and Cadets to wear swords.  
All persons belonging to the army to wear a black cockade with a small white Eagle in the Center. The Cockades of the non Commissioned officers musicians and privates to be of leather with eagles of Tin.  
The Regiments to be distinguished from each other numerically. The number of each Regiment to be expressed on the buttons.  
It cannot fail to happen, that cloathing made at a distance from the army will in numerous instances be ill fitted to the persons to whom it is issued. This is an inconvenience, as it respects appearance comfort and use. It merits consideration whether it may not be remedied by making provision by law for the necessary alterations at the cost of the soldiery. As there are always to be found Taylors in an army, the alterations may be made there during seasons of inactivity; and moderate compensations may be established to be deducted out of the pay. The Taylors who when so employed being exempted from military duty will be satisfied with very small allowances; and the soldiery will probably prefer this expence to the inconveniences of wearing cloaths which do not fit them.

r rate.  
Another point no less deserving of particular attention is the composition of the ration of provisions. It was in the last session augmented beyond all former example. It is not recollected that the ration, which was allowed during the war with Great Britain was found insufficient by troops once formed to military habits and acquainted with the best methods of managing their provisions. The present ration, estimating by price, is understood to be greater than the ration in that war by at least forty per Cent. This is evidently a very important augmentation. Various disadvantages attend it—a great increase of expence—additional difficulty in furnishing under all circumstances the stipulated allowance, consequently a multiplication of the possible causes of discontent murmur and perhaps even mutiny—the necessity of a greater number of waggons for transportation, and of course the extension of this always serious source of embarrassment to military operations.  
The quantity of spirituous liquors, which is a component part of the ration, is so large as to endanger, where they might not before exist, habits of intemperance, alike fatal to the health and discipline. Experience has repeatedly shewn that many soldiers will exchange their rum for other articles; which is productive of the double mischief of subjecting those with whom the exchange is made to the loss of what is far more necessary and to all the consequences of brutal intoxication.  
The step having been once taken a change is delicate; but it is believed to be indispensable, and that the temporary evils of a change can bear no proportion to the permanent and immense evils of a continuance of the error.  
It may not perhaps be adviseable to bring back the ration to the standard of the late war, but to modify it in some respects differently so as not materially to affect the aggregate expence.  
It may consist of Eighteen Ounces of bread or flour one pound and a quarter of fresh beef or one pound of salted beef or three quarters of a pound of salted pork; salt when fresh meat is issued at the rate of one quart and candles at the rate of a pound for every hundred rations.  
With regard to liquor it may be best to exclude it from being a component part of the ration; allowing a discretion to Commanding officers to cause it to be issued in quantities not exceeding half a gill per day except on extraordinary occasions.  
Vinegar also ought to be furnished when to be had at the rate of two quarts and soap at the rate of two pounds per hundred rations—but this ought to depend on circumstances and ought not to make part of the established ration.  
There are often difficulties in furnishing articles of this description, &amp; the equivalent in money is frequently rather pernicious than beneficial. When there is a contract, the promise of such articles is apt to prove more beneficial to the contractor than to any other person. He commonly so manages it that the substitute is not a real equivalent.  
But it need not be observed that whatever is to be done in this respect must be so conducted as not to infract the conditions on which the troops now in service were enlisted.  
It is deeply to be lamented that a very precious period of leisure was not improved towards forming among ourselves Engineers and Artillerists; and that owing to this neglect we are in danger of being overtaken by war without competent characters of these descriptions. To form them suddenly is impossible. Much previous study and experiment are essential. If possible to avoid it a war ought not to find us unprovided. It is conceived to be adviseable to endeavour to introduce from abroad at least one distinguished Engineer and one distingished Officer of Artillery. They may be sought for preferably in the Austrian and next in the Prussian armies. The grade of Colonels with adequate pecuniary compensations may attract officers of a rank inferior to that grade in those armies, who will be of distinguished abilities and merit. But in this, as we know from past experience, nothing is more easy than to be imposed upon—nothing more difficult than to avoid imposition—and that therefore it is requisite to commit the business of procuring such characters to some very judicious hand—under every caution that can put him upon his guard.  
  
If there shall be occasion for the actual employment of military force, a corps of riflemen will be for several purposes extremely useful. The eligible proportion of riflemen to infantry of the line may be taken at a twentieth. Hence in the apportionment of

lent to the present allowance of linnen, or if this cannot be, to furnish the soldiery with the requisite number, deducting the difference of cost out of their pay?  
The only provision for the appointment of a quarter Master General is to be found in the act of the 28th of May; authorising the President to raise a provisional army, which limits his rank and emoluments to that of Lt Colonel. This provision is conceived to be entirely inadequate. The military duties of the office are of a nature to render it of the first importance in an army; demanding great abilities and a character every way worthy of trust. Accordingly it is the general practice, founded upon very substantial reasons, to confide it to an officer of high Military rank. The probability is that without a similar arrangement on our part we shall not be able to command a fit character; and in taking one of inferior pretensions we shall subject the service to disadvantages out of all proportion to any objections which may be supposed to militate against the conferring of such rank. It is feared, that an appointment under the existing provision will only create embarrassment should there be real necessity for military exertions; and that the alternate must be either to leave the army destitute of so necessary an organ or to give it one likely in the progress of things to prove unequal to the task.  
It was much desired for preventing future controversy to fix in the first instance the relative grades of the regimental officers. That of the field officers has b

an extension of military preparations indis­  
pensable, and a proper organization for the  
:roops of the United States extremely bene­  
ficial.  
In proportion as the policy of the country  
s adverse to extensive military eftablilh- -  
mente, it ought to be our care, to render  
the principles of our military system as per- !  
fe&lt;ft as possible, our endeavors to turn to the  
best account, such force as we at any time  
may have on foot, and to provide an eligible  
flandard for the augmentations to which par­  
ticular emergencies may eompel a resort.  
In these views it is conceived the organi­  
sation of our military force would be much  
mproved, by modelling it according to the  
&quot;ollowing plan :  
ill. That a regiment of infantry, composed i  
is at present of two battalions, and each bat- 1  
:alion of five companies, consist of, one colo­  
lel, two majors, a Ift and 2d ; one adjutant, i  
)ne quartei&#x27;-mafler, and one pay-inafter, each ;  
jf whom (hall be a lieutenant ; one surgeon, &lt;  
ind two surgeon&#x27;s mates ; ten Captains, ten •  
irft-lieutenants, and ten second lieutenants, &#x27;  
&#x27;elides the three lieutenants above &quot;mention- &lt;  
d- two cadets, with the pay and emoluments  
3f ferjeants, two ferjeant-majors, two quar­  
ter-mailer ferjeants, two chief musicians, ill  
ind 2d, twenty other musicians, forty fer­  
jeants, forty corporals, and nine hundred  
ind twenty privates. ,  
2d. I hat a regiment of dragoons consist :  
:&gt;f ten troops, making five squadronS, and  
the following officers and men, viz : one  
■ olonel, two majors, a ift and 2d, one adju­  
tant, one quarter-master, and one pay-master,  
;ach of whom (hall be a lieutenant; one fur­  
jeon, and two surgeon&#x27;s mates ; ten captains,  
ten firfl and ten second lieutenants, besides  
the three lieutenants above mentioned ; five  
cadets, with the pay and emoluments of fer­  
jeants; two ferjeant-majors, two quarter­  
master ferjeants, two chief mufie&#x27;rans, ift and  
id, ten other musicians, forty ferjeants, for­  
ty corporals, and nine hundred and twenty  
privates ; the privates including to each  
troop, one saddler, one b&amp;ckfmith, and one  
Joot-maker.  
3d. That a regiment of artillery consist  
t)f four battalions ; each battalion of foui  
companies, and of the following officers and  
men, viz. one colonel, four majors ; one  
adjutant, one quarteriuafter, and one pay­  
master, each of whom (hall be a lieutenant;  
one aad two surgeon&#x27;s mates ; six­  
teen captains, iixtecn firft, and sixteen se­  
cond lieutenants, besides the three lieute­  
nants above mentioned, thirty-two cadets,  
with the pay and emoluments as at present  
established, four ferjeant-majors, four qi«r­  
  
- ter-mafter ferjeantss fiirty-four ferjear.ts, :&#x27;ix­  
ty-four o.it cuivf mui&#x27;iewii and ten  
other jnuikians, and. eight .In .id red and 1  
ninety-fix privates, ipcliidLqg each com­  
pany eight artificers; &#x27;  
The principal reasons for this organization 1  
will be briefly fuggelled and explained.  
1 ft. It will be observed that the piopofed (  
proportion of men to officers in the infantry 1  
and cavalry is considerably greaterythaii by &lt;  
.j the present establishment. This in t  
the firft place, the advantage of (economy,  
f- By the proportional decrease of the officers, t  
savings will result in their pay, subsistence, s  
and the transportation of their baggage ;  
and the last circuinftance, bv leflening the c  
■ impediments of an array, is also favorable to 1  
the celerity of its movement.  
2d. The command of each officer will be- j&#x27;  
come more refpi C\able. This will be an in- 11  
auceitien.t to r fpedlable men to accept mili- t  
&#x27; t.lry appointments, and it will he an incen- 1  
tive to exertion among those who fliall be &#x27;  
engaged, by upholding that juftifiable pride c  
which is a necefTary ingredient in the milita- t  
■s ry character, a company will then admit of   
an eligible subdivision into platoons, feiElions   
r&#x27; and detivi-fedions, each of a peffedt front. j  
3d. Each battalion will be of the size judg­  
ed proper for a manreurring column in the a  
field, and it ii that portion of an army, &#x27;  
which in the mbfl approved l&#x27;yftem of tallies I  
is destined to fulfill this objedl. A battal- d  
ion, according to the best judges, |_fanclion- j f  
ed by experience, ought neither to be too a  
unwieldy for rapid movements, nor so small  
as to multiply too much the sub-divisions,,  
&#x27; and render each incapable, either of a vigo- e  
rous impulse or resistance. a  
1 4th. Ihe proportion- of officers to men, t  
t ought not to be greater than is adequate to 6  
t the due management and command of them, a  
- A carefug examination of this point will fa­  
• tisfy every judge that the number now pro- P  
c posed will be adequate to b«th. And it is &quot;  
s illuftrattd by the expeftation that our fun- u  
orders, in conformity with those t  
of the nations of Europe generally ought to *  
pTace our infantry in three ranks, to oppose 6  
to an e»emy who shall be in the fame order, F  
an equal mass for attack or defence. s  
But it is not intended to recommend a  
present augmentation of the number of rank °  
and file, to the proposed flandard. It is on­  
ly wiihed that it may be adopted provisional- t  
| ly, as that of the war eftablilhment. v  
1 The regiments which have been authorised t  
may continue in this n:fpeft upon the foot- ii  
| ing already prescribed ; leaving the aftual *  
; augmtntation to depend on events which t  
may create a necessity for the increase of our £  
foree. g  
Ihe other alterations recommended, have e  
relation rather to fyflematic propriety, than i&#x27;  
to very important military effects. ft  
1 ft. The term lieutenant-ccloned, in our h  
present establishment, has a relative Ggnifi- w  
cation, without any thing, in fa£l, to which m  
it relates. It was introduced during «our re- a  
veluti«nary war, to facilitate exchanges of si  
prisoners, as our then enemy united the grade v  
of colonel with that of general—But the per- ti  
manent forms of our military system, ought g  
to be plated by principle, Tiot the _fi  
and arbitrary arrangement of a p  
particulai nation. The title of colonel, which fl  
has gpater refpeftability, is more proper for e  
commander ot a regiment, because it does ei  
pot, like the other, imply a relation having si  
I noexiftence. p  
ad. The term ensign, is changed into t;  
that of lieutenant, as well because the latter, p  
&#x27; from usage, has additional refpeilability, of7  
fering an inducement to delirable candidates, 0  
as because the former, in its origin, fignified a  
a standard bearer, and supposed • that each t;  
company had a diftinft flandard. it  
This in pradlice tea fed to be the cafe, 0  
and for a variety of good reasons, a standard&#x27; v  
of colors to each battalion of infantry, is 1:  
deemed-fufficient. This standard is intended ii  
to be confided to a cadet, in whom it may p  
be expc£le4 to excite emulation and exertion. t&lt;  
The multiplication of grades, inconvenient a  
in exchanges, is thus avoided. e:  
In the cavalry it is proper to allow a stand- r(  
ard to each squadron consisting of two troops,  
and hence it is proposed to have five cadets f&lt;  
to a regiment. a  
3d. The nature of the artillery service be- ti  
ing constantly in detachment, renders it pro- p  
per to a irncnt of a greater num*  
ber of battalions than the other corps. This p  
our present eftablilhment has recognized, tj  
But there is now a want of uniformity which a  
leads to disorderly cflnfequences : one regi- le  
ment being composed of four battal ions, the w  
other three. The fame organization ought a&lt;  
to be common to all. The diminution of ft  
the number of musicians, while it will save ft  
expence, is also warranted by the peculiar 15  
nature of the artillery service. They answer u  
in this corps few of the purposes they are apt;  
plied to in the infantry. a  
Existing laws contemplate, and with good o:  
re a fan, that the aids ot general officers (ex- t&lt;  
cept the commander in chief) shall be taken £  
from the regiments ; but they do not pro- o:  
vide that when so taken, their places in&#x27;the t;  
regiment shall be supplied by others. It is f(  
conceived that this ought to be the cafe, g  
The principles of the establishment supposes 0  
for example that three officers to a company p  
of a given number, are the just and due pro- r&lt;  
portion. If, when an officer is taken from ft  
a company to fill one of the stations alluded w  
to, his place be not filled by another, so di  
that the number of officers to a company 0:  
may feniain the fame, it must follow, that g  
the company will be deficient in officer*, ft  
Xt is true that the number of a company is n  
continually diminishing, but it diminifiies c&lt;  
in officers as well as men : and it is not&gt; at  
known that the proportion is varied. Prac- ir  
tice, in ever)&#x27; inftitutiou, ought to conform al  
to principle, or there will result more or less fr  
of disorder. An army, is in many refpe&amp;s, tl  
a machine, of which the difpiacement of any di  
of the organs, if permitted to continue, in- tl  
jures its fymetry and energy, amfleads to b&lt;  
disorder and weakness. The increase of the si&#x27;  
number of rank and file, while it strengthens v&lt;  
the reasons for replacing the officers who tl  
may be removed, will more than compensate,  
in point of ceconomy, for the addition of fc  
officers by the substitution. This may be le

If there shall be occaiion for the adlual em­  
ploy ment of military force, a corps of rifle­  
men will be, forfeverul purposes, extremely  
ufeful. The eligible proportion of riflemen  
to infantry of the line, may be taken at a  
twentieth. It is submitted whet hex a fpeci­  
fic provision to this effcdl, will not be pro­  
per in arranging the army for a wareftablifh­  
xnent.  
The only provision for the appointment  
of a quarter-master-general, is to&#x27; be found  
in the adl of the 28th of May, authoriz&#x27;-&#x27;g  
the Prelidcnt to raise a provisional army,  
which limits his rank and emoluments to  
those of lieutenant-colonel. This provision  
it conceived to be entirely inadequate for a  
war establishment. ( The military duties of  
the office are of a nature to render it of the  
firft importance in an army ; demanding  
great and peculiar abilities, and a character  
every way worthy of trufl;—accordingly it  
is the general pradlice, founded on veryjub­  
flantiai reasons to confide it to an officir of  
high military rank. The probability is, that  
without a similar arrangement on our part,  
we shall not be able to command a fit char­  
adler, and in taking one of inferior preten­  
tions, we shall fubjedl the service to disad­  
vantages out of all proportion to any objec­  
tions which may be fuppoled to militate v  
gainst the conferring of such rank. It is  
feared . that, a n .aEiwuxunw uni«i &lt;V&gt;li u ■  
provilion will only create embarrafTment  
should there be real necessity for military  
exertions, and that the alternative mufl be  
either to leave the army deflitute of so neces­  
sary an organ, or to give it one likely, in the  
progress of things, to prove unequal to the  
talk. A new provifien on this fubjedl ap­  
pears absolutely indispensable.  
Ihe Secretary does not discover, in any  
of the adls, the necefTary provisions for the  
appointment of hospital officers, or a hospi­  
tal establishment—As military hospitals ar

It is deeply to be lamented, that a very

deavor to introduce from abroad, at leafl  
onf d&gt;ftinff&quot;iffied engineer, and one distin­  
guished officer of artillery. Thc-v mav be

attract a rank inferior to that grade

abilities and merit. But in this as we know  
from past experience, nothing is more easy  
than to be imposed upon ; nothing more  
difficult than to avoid imposition, and that  
therefore, should the measure be sanctioned

to the soldier. ,It cannot fail to happen that  
cloathmg made at a distance from the army  
will in numerous instances be ill-fitted to the  
person to whom it is issued. This is an in  
convenience, as it respects appearance, com­  
fort and ease, and causes the soldier to be  
careless of his dress—it of course ni-nts

—As there are always to he found tailors m  
an army, the alterations may be made there  
during seasons of inactivity, &amp; moderate com I

out of the pay of the soldiers. The tailors

from military duty, will be fatisfied with  
very fmjill allowances ; and the soldiery will  
from the best information I can obtain, pre.  
fer this expence to the inconveniences of  
wearing cloaths which do not fit them.  
Another point no less deserving of parti­  
cular attention, is the composition ef the ra­  
tion of provisions. It was in the last fcflion  
augmented beyond all former example, It  
is not recollected that the ration which wu  
allowed during the war with Great-Britain  
was found infufficient by troops once  
formed to military habits, acquainted with  
the best method of managing their provilion»  
1 he present ration, estimating by price, is  
understood to be greater than the ration in  
that war, by above 50 per cent. This is evi­  
dently a very important augmentation—va­  
rious disadvantages attend it; a great incrcife  
of expence ; additional difficul.y infurnliH­

the poiuhle causes of discontent, inurenurs,  
and perhaps even mutiny—the necessity of a  
greater number of waggons for transporta­  
tion, and of course the extension 0! this al­  
ways serious source of embarralfment to mil­  
itary operations.  
The quantity of fpirituov.i liquor, which  
is a component part of the ration, is lb large,  
as to endanger, where there might not before  
exist, habits of intemperance alike fatal to  
health and difcipltne. Experience has re­  
peatedly shewn that many soldiers will ex­  
change their rum for other articles, wuicliis  
productive of the double mifchief of lub­  
jeCting those with whom the exchange is  
made to the loi&#x27;s of what is far more neces­  
sary, and to all the confluences of brutal  
intoxication.

It is/well understood that the increase hav­  
ing been once made, a change is delicate ;  
but it is believed to be indispensable, and  
that the temporary evils of a change can bear  
no proportion to the permanent and inunenfe  
evils of a continuance of the error.  
It may not perhaps be advifeable to bring  
back the ration to the ffandard of the late  
but to modify it in some respeCts dif­  
ferently, so as not materially to affeft the ag­  
gregate expence.  
For example, it may consist of eighteen  
ounces of bread or flour, or an equivalent in  
rice, or indian meal, when flour cannot be  
obtained ; one pound and a quarter of irelh  
beef, or one pound of salted beef, or three  
quarters of a pound of salted pork ; fait,  
when freffi nnat is issued, at the rate yi two  
quarts, and candles at the rate of a pound  
and a half for every 100 rations.  
With regard to liquor, it may be best to  
exclude it from being a component part of  
the ration, allowing a discretion to com­  
manding officers, to cause it to be issued in  
quantities not exceeding half a gill per day*  
except.on coyraorcltnary occasions.  
Vinegar also ought to be furnifhed, when  
to be had at the rate of two quarts, and soap  
at the rate of two pounds per hundred ra­  
tions, but this ought to depend on circum­  
stances, and ought not to make part of the  
eftablifced ration.  
There are often difficulties in furnifhing  
articles of the latter description, and the equi­  
valent in money is frequently rather perni.  
qious than beneficial. Where there is a con­  
tract, the promise of such articles is apt to  
prove more beneficial to the contractor than  
to any other person. He commonly so ma­  
nages it that the.substitute is not a real equi­  
valent.  
But it need not be remarked, that whate­

rft. It will be obferved, that. the propofed proportion of men to off-  
cers in the infantry and cavalry is confiderably. greater than by the pre-  
fent eftablifhment. This prefents in the firft place, the advantage of  
economy. By the proportional decreafe of the officers falaries favines  
will refult in their pay, fubfiftence, and the tranfportation of their  
baggage; and the laft circumftance by leffening the impediments of an  
army, is alfo favourable to the celerity of its movements.  
2d. The command of each officer will become more refpetable. This  
will be an inducement to refpectable men toaccept military appointments,  
and it will be an incentive toexertion among thofe who fhall be engaged,  
by upholding that juftifiable pride, which is a neceffary ingredient in the  
military character. A company will then admit of an eligible fubdivi-  
fion into platoons, fections, and demi-fections, each of a perfe&amp; front.  
3d. Each battalion will be of the fize judged proper for a manceuvring  
column in the field, and it is that portion of an army, which in the moft  
approved fyftem of tactics, is deftined to fulfil this obje(i. A battalion  
according to the judges fanétioned by experience, ought neither to be  
too unweildy for rapid movements, aor fo {mall as to multiply too much  
ethe {nbdivifions, and render each incapable, either of a vigorous impulfe  
or refiftance.  
4th. The proportion of officers to men ought not-to be greater than is  
adequate to the due management and command of them. A careful ex-  
amination of this point will fatisfy.every judge, that the number now  
propofed will be adequate to both. Andit is illuftrated by the expecta-  
tion that our fundamental orders, in coaformity with thofe of the nati-  
ons of Europe generally, ought to place our infantry in three ranks, to  
oppofe to an enemy who fhall be in the fame order, an equal mafs for ate  
tack or defence.  
  
But it is not intended to recommended a prefent augmentation of the  
  
‘number of rank and file, to the propofed ftandard. Itis only wihed that |  
  
it may be adopted provifionally, as that of the war eftablifhment.  
  
The regiments which have been authorifed may continue, in this ref-  
pect upon the footing already prefcribed ; leaving the aétual augmenta-  
tion to depend on events which may create a neceflity for the encreafe of  
our force. .  
  
The other alterations recommended have relation rather to fyftematic  
propriety, than to very important military effects.

383 APPENDIX.  
  
was introduced during our revolutionary war to facilitate exchanges of  
  
prifoners, as our then enemy united the grade of colonel with that of —  
  
general. But the permanent forms of our military fyfiem ought to be  
regulated by principle, not by the changeable forms and arguments of  
  
a particular nation. ‘The title ef colonel, which has greater refpecta-  
  
bility, ismore proper for the commander of a regiment, becaufe it does  
ot like the other, imply a relation having no exiftence. |  
  
2d. The term enfign is changed into that of lieutenant, as well becaufe  
the latter, from ufage has additional refpetability, offering an induce-  
nent to defirable candidates, as becaufe the former, in its origin, fignifi.  
ed a ftandard bearer, and fuppofed that each company had a diftinct ftan.  
dard.  
  
This in praétice has ceafed to be the cafe, and for a variety of good  
reafons, a fandard of colours to each battalion of infantry is deemed fuf.  
ficient. This ftandard is intended to be confined to a cadet, in whom  
it may be expected to excite emulation andexertion. The multiplica-  
tion of grades, inconvenient in exchanges is thus avoided.  
  
In the cavalry it is proper to allow a ftandard to each fquadron confift-  
ing of two troops, and hence it is propofed to have five cadets toa regi-  
iment. ;  
3d. The nature of the artillery fervice being conftantly in detach.  
ment, renders it proper to compofe a regiment of a greater number of  
battalions than in the other corpse This our prefent eflablifhment has  
recognized.—But there is now a want of uniformity which leads to dif-  
orderly confequences ; one regiment being compofed of four battalions,  
the other of three. The fame organization ought to be common to all,  
The diminution of the number of the muficians, while it will fave ex-  
pence, is alfo warranted by the peculiar nature of the artillery fervice.  
‘They anfwer in this corps few of the purpofes they are applied to in the  
infantry.  
  
Exifting laws contemplate, and with good reafon, that the aids of ge-  
neral officers (except of the commander in chief) fhall be taken from the  
regiments: but they do not provide, that, when fo taken, their places in,  
the regiment fhall be fupplied by others. It is conceived, that this ought  
to be the cafe. The principles of the eftablifhment fuppofes, for exam-  
ple, that three officers to a company of a given number, are. the juft and  
  
due proportion. If, when an officer is taken from a company to fill ene.  
  
of the ftations alluded to, his place be not filled by another, fo that the  
number of officers to a company may remain the fame, it muft follow,  
that the company will be deficient in officers. It is true, that the num-  
ber of 2 company is continually diminithing, but it diminifhes in officers  
as well as men; and it is not known that the proportion is varied. Prac-  
tice, in every inftitution ought to conform to principle, or there will be  
more or lefs of diforder. An army is, in many refpe&amp;s, a machine, of  
which the difplacement of any of the organs, if permitted to continue,  
injures its fymmetry and energy, and leads to diforder and weakne‘s.  
The increafe of the number of rank and file, while it ftrengthens the rea-  
fons for replacing the officers, who may be removed, will more than  
compenfate, in point of ceconomy, for the addition of officers by the fub-  
ftitution.—This may be fubmitted to the teft of calculation. But though  
the place of an officer in his regiment ought to be fupplied upon any fuch  
removal, he ought not to Jofe his ftation in the regiment, but ought 28  
vank and rife, as if he had continued to ferve in it.

The only provifion for the appointment of a quarter mafter general, is  
to be found in the act of the 28th May, authorizing the Prefident to  
raife a provifional army, which limits his rank and emoluments to thofe  
of lieutenant colonel ;—This provifion is conceived to be entirely inade-  
quate for a war eftablifiment. ‘The military duticg of the office are of

be fitted to the foldier. It cannot fail to happen that cloathing made at a  
diftance from the army, will in numerous inftances be ill fitted to the  
perfon to whom it is iffued. This is an inconvenience as it refpeéts ap-  
pearance, comfort and,eafe, and caufes the foldier to be carelefs of his  
drefs. It of courfe adfrits contideration,. whether it will, not be reme-  
died by making provifion by law for the neceffary alteration at the coft  
of the foldiers. As there are always to be found tailors in an army, the  
alterations may be made there during feafons of inactivity, and moderate  
  
compenfations may be eftablifhed, to be deducted out of the pay of the  
  
foldicrs. ‘The tailors, who, when fo employed, will be exempted from  
military duty, will be fatisfied with very {mail allowances ; and the fol-  
diery will, from the beft information Ican obtain, prefer this expence  
to the inconveniencies of wearing clothes which do not fit them.  
  
Another point no lefs deferving of particular attention is the compo-  
fition of the rations of provifions. It was in the laft feflion augmented  
beyond all former example. It is not recolle&amp;ed that the ration which  
was allowed duringthe war with Great Britain was found infuflicient by  
troops once formed to military habits, and acquainted with the beft me-  
thods of managing their provifions. The prefent ration, eftimating by  
price, is underftood to be greater than the ration in that war, by above  
fifty percent. This is evidently a very important augmentation—vari-  
ous diladvantages attend it ; a great increafe of expence ; additional  
difficulty in furnifhing, under all circumftances, the ftipulated allawance,  
confequently a multiplication of the poffible caufe of difcontent, mur-  
murs, and perhaps even mutiny, the neceflity of a greater number of  
wagons for tranfportation, and of courfe the extenfion of this always  
ferious fource of embarraffment to military operations.  
  
The quantity of {pirituous liquor, which is a compotent part of the ra-  
tion, is fo large, as to endanger, where there might not before exift, ha-  
bits of intemperance, alike fatal to heaith and difcipline. Experience has  
repeatedly fhewn, that many foldiers will exchange their rum for other  
articles, which is productive of the double mifchief of fubjeGting thofe  
with whom, the exchange is made to the lofs of what is more neceflary,  
  
‘and to all the confequences of brutal intoxication.  
  
Thefe, and fuch confiderations, have induced the Secretary to caufe  
to be inferted in the contract made under his orders, a provilo, that if  
the quantities of the component articles of aration fhall be reduced by  
law, the price to be allowed therefor, fhall be proportionally reduced :  
® And in the article of inliftment, a provifo that the foldier is to accept  
fuch ration as is or fhall be eftablifhed by law.”  
  
Itis well underftood, that the increafe having been once made,  
achange isdelicate ; but ‘it is believed to be indifpenfable, and that the  
temporary evils of a change can bear no proportion to the permanent im-  
mente evils of a continuance of the error.  
  
It may not perhaps be advifable to bring back the ration ta the ftand-  
ard of the late war, but to modify it in fome refpects differently fo as not  
hhaterially to affect the aggregate expence.  
  
For example, it may coukit of eighteen ounces of bread or flour, cr

an equivalent in rice, or Indian meal, when flour cannot be obtained ;  
one pound and a quarter of frefh beef, or one pound of falted beef, ot  
three quarters of a poundof falted pork ; falt, when frefh meat is iflued,  
at the rate of two quarts, and candles at the rate of a pound and a half  
for every hundred rations. )  
  
With regard to liquor it may be beft to exclude it from being a com-  
ponent part of the ration, allowing a difcretion tocommanding officers  
to caufe it to be iffued in quantities not exceeding half a gilbper day, ex-  
cept on extraordinary occations.  
  
. Vinegar ought alfo to be furnifhed, when to be had, at the rate of  
  
two quarts, and foapat the rate of two pounds per hundred rations ;  
  
but this ought to depend upon circumftances, and ought not to make  
artof the efiablifhed ration.  
  
There are often difficulties in furnifhing articles of the latter defcrip-  
tion, and the equivalent in money is frequently rather pernicious than  
beneficial. Where there is a contract, the promife of fueh articles is  
apt to prove more beneficial to the contractor than to.any other perfon.  
He commonly fo manages it that the f@ftitute is not a real equivalent.  
  
But it need not be remarked, that whatever is to be done in this re-  
{pect mult be fo conducted, as not to infraét the conditions on which the  
old troops now in fervice were enlifted.
