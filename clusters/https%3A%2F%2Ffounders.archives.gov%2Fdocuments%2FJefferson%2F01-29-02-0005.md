And his C. Majesty has likewise agreed that the navigation of the said river in its whole breadth from its Source to the Ocean shall be free only to his subjects and the Citizens of the U. States, unless he should extend this privilege to the subjects of other powers by special Convention.” Doubts were expressed by King in the Senate whether this could be construed into a harmony with the stipulations to G.B. and the pulse of the body felt on the subject with a view to a declaratory proviso to the ratifica

which, more or less, prevailed in the western parts  
of the United States, and particularly in Kentucky,  
on this subject, from the year 1789 until the year  
1803, will be readily recollected. Indeed, so jealous  
were the Spaniards in relation to the free navi-

of the treaty of 1795, it is expressly stipulated,  
that “the navigation of the said river, in its

plain, that the 8th article of the treaty of peace,  
of the 3d of September, 1783, between the Unit-

navigation of the river Mississippi from its source
