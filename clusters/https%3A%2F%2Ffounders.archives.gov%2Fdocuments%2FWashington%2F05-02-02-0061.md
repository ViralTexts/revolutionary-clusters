Gentlemen,  
[Baltimore, 17 April 1789]  
  
The tokens of regard and affection, which I have often received from the Citizens of this Town, were always acceptable; because, I believed them, always sincere. Be pleased to receive my best acknowledgments for the renewal of them, on the present occasion.  
If the affectionate partiality of my fellow Citizens has prompted them to ascribe greater effects to my conduct &amp; character, than were justly due; I trust, the indulgent sentiment on their part, will not produce an overweening presumption on mine.  
I cannot now, Gentlemen, resist my feelings so much, as to withhold the communication of my ideas, respecting the actual situation and prospect of our national affairs. It appears to me, that little more than common sense and common honesty, in the transactions of the community at large, would be necessary to make us a great and a happy Nation. For if the general Government, lately adopted, shall be arranged &amp; administered in such a manner as to acquire the full confidence of the American People, I sincerely believe, they will have greater advantages, from their Natural, moral &amp; political circumstances, for public felicity, than any other People ever possessed.  
In the contemplation of those advantages, now soon to be realized, I have reconciled myself to the sacrafice of my fondest wishes, so far as to enter again upon the stage of Public life. I know the delicate nature of the duties incident to the part which I am called to perform; and I feel my incompetence, without the singular assistance of Providence to discharge them in a satisfactory manner. But having undertaken the task, from a sense of duty, no fear of encountering difficulties and no dread of losing popularity, shall ever deter me from pursuing what I conceive to be the true interests of my Country.

Baltimore, April 17, 1789.  
ANSWER.  
Gentlemen,  
HE tokens of regard and affeAi-  
on which I have often received  
from the citizens of this town, were  
always acceptable, becaufe I believed  
  
them always fincere, Be pleafed to  
  
receive my belt acknowledgments for  
the renewal of them on the prefene  
occafion,  
  
If the affe€tionate partiality of my  
fellow-citizens has prompted them t  
afcribe greatcr effects to my condug  
and charatter, than were jullty due. |  
truft the indulgent fentiment on they  
part, will not produce any prefump.  
tion on mine.  
  
I cannot now, gentlemen, reff  
my feelings fo much as to withhold  
the communication of my ideas, re.  
fpe&amp;ting the a€tual fituation and prof  
pect of our national affairs, It a  
pears to me that little more than com.  
mon fenfe and coimmon honefly in  
the tranfaétions of the community x  
large, would be neceffary to make»  
a great and a happy nation, For  
the general government, lately adop.  
ed, fhall be arranged and adminiltered  
in fuch a manner as to acquire the fil  
confidence of the American peopk,  
I fincerely believe they will have  
greater advantages from their naturdl,  
moral, and political circomfanes,  
for public felicity, than any other  
people ever poffeffed,  
  
In the contemplation of thofe i.  
vantages, now foon to be realized, |  
have reconciled myfelf to the fin  
fice of my fondeft withes, fo far asio  
enter again upon the fage of puble  
life. I know the delicate nature of  
the duties incident to the part whit  
I am called to perform, and I feel my  
Incompetence, without the fingula  
aflittance of providence, to difchaye  
them in a facsfaftory manner, Bit  
having undertaken the tafk, froma  
fenfe of duty, no fear of encountenny  
difficulties, and no dread of loin  
popularity fhall ever deter me fiva
