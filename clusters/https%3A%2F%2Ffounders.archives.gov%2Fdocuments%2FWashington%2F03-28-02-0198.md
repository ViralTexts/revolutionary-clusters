[Officers] For the day Tomorrow[:] Brigadier General Glover[,] Colonel Bradley[,] Lieutenant Colonel Olney[,] Major Waite[,] Brigade Major smith  
The truly martial appearance made by the troops yesterday the order and regularity with which they made the different marches and the ease and facility they performed the several manreuvres does them the greatest Credit and affords the most flattering prospect of substantial service reputation and military glory.  
  
Nothing can be more pleasing to the officers who feel for the honor of the Army and the Independence of America than to see the rapid progress made by the Troops in military discipline.  
The good conduct of all the officers yesterday gave the general the highest satisfaction and the particular services of the Inspector General and those serving in that line deserve his particular thanks.  
Treason of the blackest dye was yesterday discovered! General Arnold who commanded at Westpoint, lost to every sentiment of honor—of public and private obligation—was about to deliver up that important Post into the hands of the enemy. Such an event must have given the American cause a deadly wound if not a fatal stab. Happily the treason has been timely discovered to prevent the fatal misfortune. The providential train of circumstances which led to it affords the most convincing proof that the Liberties of America are the object of divine Protection.  
At the same time that the Treason is to be regretted the General cannot help congratulating the Army on the happy discovery. Our Enemies despairing of carrying their point by force are practising every base art to effect by bribery and Corruption what they cannot accomplish in a manly way.  
Great honor is due to the American Army that this is the first instance of Treason of the kind where many were to be expected from the nature of the dispute—and nothing is so bright an ornament in the Character of the American soldiers as their having been proof against all the arts and seduction of an insidious enemy.  
Arnold has made his escape to the Enemy but Mr André the Adjutant General to the British Army who came out as a spy to negotiate the Business is our Prisoner.  
His Excellency the commander in Chief has arrived at Westpoint from Harford and is no doubt taking the proper measures to unravel fully, so hellish a plot.

Greene, whom Washington had left in command

Hartford on the 17th of September to confer with  
the French General and Admiral.—[Ep. ]  
  
  
  
  
  
The great conduct of all the officers  
yesterday gave the General the highest sat-

Inspector-General and those serving in

Treason of the blackest dye was yester-  
day’ discovered. General Arnold, who  
commanded at West Point, lost to every  
sentiment of honor—of private and pub-  
lic obligation—was about to deliver up that  
important post into the hands of the en-  
emy. Such an event must have given the  
American army a deadly wound, if not a  
Jatal stab. Happily the treason has been  
timely discovered to prevent the fatal mis-  
fortune. The providential train of cir-  
cumstances which led to it affords the most  
convincing proof that the liberties of  
America are the object of Divine protec-  
tion.  
  
At the same time that the TREASON is to  
be regretted, the General cannot help con-  
gratulating the army on the happy dis-  
covery. Our enemies, despairing of carry-  
ing their point by force, are practising

American army that this is the first in-

dispute. And nothing is so bright an or-

having been proof against all the arts and  
seductions of an insidious enemy.

their absence, I shall give you the following Extract from  
Gen&#x27; Greene’s Order on the discovery of Arnold’s hellish  
plot.  
  
“*ORANGETOWN Sept 26 1780.  
  
“*Treason of the Blackest dye was yesterday discouver’d. Gen!  
Arnold who commanded at West Point, lost.to every sentiment of  
Honour, of Private and Public Obligations, was about to deliver that  
important Post into the hands of the Enemy. Such an event must  
have given the American cause a deadly wound if not a fatal stab.  
Happily the Treason has been timely discouver’d to prevent the fatal  
misfortune. The Providential train of circumstances which led to it  
affords the most convincing proof that the Liberty’s of America is the  
object of Divine Providence. At the same time the Treason is to be  
regrett’d. The General cannot help congratulating the Army on the  
happy Discovery.  
  
“* Our Enemys despairing of carrying their point by Force, they are  
practicing every base act to effect by Bribery and Corruption, what they  
cannot accomplish in a Manly way.  
  
“* Great Honour is due to the American Army that this is the first  
instance of treason of this kind, where many were to be expected from  
the Nature of the Dispute, and nothing is so bright an Ornament as the  
character of the American Soldiers, as they having been proof against  
all the Arts and Seductions of an Insidious Enemy.  
  
“¢Mr. André, Adjutant Gen! to the British Army, who came out as a  
Spy to negotiate business is our prisoner. His Excellency the Com-  
mander in Chief is arrived at West Point from Hartford, and is, no  
doubt, taking the proper measures to fully unravel so Hellish a Plot.’
