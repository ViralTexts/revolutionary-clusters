y 2, 1795]  
[To the Speaker of the House of Representatives]  
The Secretary of the Treasury respectfully makes the following report to the House of Representatives.  
According to the present laws imposing duties on articles imported into the United States, not much Short of one third of the whole amount of the duties is derived from articles rated advalorem.  
In other nations, where this branch of revenue, as with us, is of principal, or very considerable consequence, and where no peculiarity of situation has tended to keep the rates of duty low, experience has led to contract more and more, the number of articles rated ad valorem, and of course, to extend the number of those rated specifically, that is, according to weight, measure, or other rule of quantity.  
The reason of this is obvious. It is to guard against Evasions which infallibly happen in a greater or less degree, where duties are high. It is impossible for the merchants of any country to have manifested more probity, than those of the United States, on this Subject. And it is firmly believed, that there never was one, in which illicit practices, to the disadvantage of the revenue, have obtained So little as hitherto in this. Yet it would be a delusive expectation, that with duties so considerable as those which now exist, a disposition will not be experienced in some individuals, who carry on our import trade, to evade the payment of them, and this to an extent sufficient to make it prudent to guard with circumspection, and by every reasonable precaution against the success of such attempts. It is needless to repeat that this will contribute as much to the interest of the fair trader, as to that of the revenue.  
It is believed, that in our System, the method of rating ad valorem could, with convenience, be brought within a much narrower compass; and it is evident, that to do so, will contribute materially to the Security of the revenue.  
The Secretary has not hitherto had leisure to digest the details of a plan for this purpose; but if the idea is approved, it can be carried with due accuracy into effect, at a future session, by an order upon the head of this department, to prepare in the mean time, a tariff proportioned to the actual rates of duty.  
It may also be found expedient with a similar view, to adjust anew the proportional rates of duty of different kinds or qualities of certain articles. This observation is believed to apply with particular force to teas. It would be, in the opinion of the Secretary, advisable to throw them into three classes; to raise somewhat the lowest rate, and to diminish considerably the higher rates. A persuasion is entertained, founded partly upon observation of the course of importations, that a regulation of this kind, would benefit the revenue. The same thing might be conveniently extended to some other articles.  
Advantages will also accrue from a re-adjustment of the rates in certain cases, by combining several rates on the same articles, established by different acts, into one rate, and by dismissing inconvenient fractions, which serve to perplex the calculation of the duties. Some alteration in the terms of credit for duties, may, it is conceived, be made with advantage. Where four months are allowed, three and six months may be substituted; and three, six, nine, twelve and fifteen, to the cases of six, nine and twelve months. This will apportion the course of receipts more according to the course of payments, and prevent inconvenient pressures at particular junctures.  
The compensations to inspectors, especially in the ports where the expense of living is great, and to collectors and Surveyors in the less productive parts, urgently demand revision, in order to an increase of them.  
The Security of the revenue, in every branch, turns (it will not be strong to say) principally upon the officers of the lowest grade. Hence it is a policy, no less mistaken than common, to leave those officers without such compensations as will admit of a proper selection of character, and prevent the temptation from indigence to abuse the trust. It is certain, that in many places, the present allowance to inspectors, on the most liberal application of it, is inadequate to those important ends.  
A similar reasoning will apply to those officers of the principal grades, who being in districts which produce little, are ill compensated by the emoluments to which they are at present entitled. It cannot escape, that the safety of the revenue must depend on equal fidelity and due vigilance in all the districts; else it may become, in many cases, worth the while to resort to particular districts, because there is a deficiency of the one or the other. Besides, that it is in itself just and proper, that all who are in the public service, should receive adequate rewards for their time, attention and trouble.  
The aggregate expense of collecting the duties on impost and tonnage, is at present, truly moderate; a circumstance which facilitates the extension of allowances where they are necessary. The System of the revenue cutters needs revision. The utility of every institution depends on the competency of the agents who are to execute it. The present compensations to officers and men, compared with what may be obtained in other similar employment, unaided by collateral motives, creates a degree of embarrassment which very much impairs the usefulness of the thing. It would have been, in the judgment of the Secretary, a great mean of rendering it competent to its object, if, as was early suggested by him, the officers of the customs had had rank in the navy of the United States.  
With regard to that branch of revenue, which is constituted by the duties upon Spirits distilled within the United States, and upon Stills, it is believed that it would be an improvement, and one which could be now made without inconvenience, to abolish the option to pay by the gallon, of the Spirits distilled in the cases where the duties are charged on the Stills. This will leave the alternative of paying by the year, or for less periods upon licenses, at the choice of the party—an alternative which affords sufficient accommodation to the difference of circumstances. The option to pay by the gallon, of the Spirits distilled, according to an account to be rendered on the oath of the party, though expedient in the first experiment of the law, is objectionable as a permanent regulation in a double view.  
The additional discretionary latitude given to compensations to the officers concerned in the collection of those duties, is restricted to a term which will expire at the end of the next Session of Congress. It will be essential to extend it, or to fix the compensations which shall have been allowed. It is believed that further experience will still be useful towards a definitive legislative adjustment.  
Embarrassments are experienced from the want of a concurrent authority

 in these officers, similar to that of the officers of the customs, to make seizures within each other’s surveys or divisions. On the borders of such as are adjacent, the officers are exposed to hazard in making seizures, and better opportunities are afforded of escaping detection.

t retail, of any other Spirits than those they themselves distil.  
Or another rule may be adopted, for proportioning the tax to the extent of the dealing; which is, to add to the present rate of the licence, certain supplemental rates, according to the yearly rent or yearly value, by appraisement of the house or building in which the retailer of wines or spirituous liquors shall carry on the business.  
This has been found in practice, a convenient, and, upon the whole, an equitable rule of proportion; evidently more so than one licence, with the same duty to all dealers indiscriminately.  
It is a general and a wise national policy, to make these articles of wine and spirits as contributory to the revenue as they can be made, which can only be effected by subdividing the duties upon them, in the different stages of their passage to the consumer. The branch under consideration, might be an important one. As it is now regulated, it is feared that it may prove of inconsiderable consequence. The confining of the licences for selling spirituous liquors to foreign Spirits, must give great facility to evasions. And it has an unequal operation upon different portions of the community.  
It would promote the object of the Act which imposes duties on sales at auction, to allow two and a half per centum to each auctioneer, in lieu of the one per centum allowed by the ninth Section of that Act. It is believed, that the present allowance is insufficient to defray the expense of clerkship incident to a compliance with the requisitions of the law, which cannot be rendered less particular or exact, without prejudice to the revenue.  
The tax upon Snuff, according to a rate per pound will be liable to very great evasions, without regulations for a close inspection of the course of the business. Dispensing with these, it seems advisable to modify the tax upon a different plan. The proposition to lay it upon the mortar, is as good a substitute as has occurred. It appears, upon evidence which is credited, that a Snuff mill usually works about one half the year; that is, one hundred and fifty six working days in a year, and yields per mortar of the whole number of mortars contained in a mill, an average of forty five pounds of snuff per day. It follows, that five hundred and sixty one dollars and sixty cents per mortar, per annum, is the equivalent of the present duty of eight cents per pound. There are objections to this form of the tax, but as it appears to be generally desired by the manufacturers, it seems advisable to forego them; especially, as the present plan demands far more rigorous precautions for the effectual collection of the duty, than now exist, or than would be expedient.  
A similar difficulty attends the tax upon refined sugar. But a proper substitute for the present plan, is not perceived. It will fortify the revenue, and produce no undue inconvenience to the manufacturer, if he be required to annex a ticket or tickets to each loaf of sugar, specifying the weight in pounds; and to each cask, barrel, key, box or other package of refined Sugar, specifying the contents, and weight in pounds—Corresponding certificates or tickets to accompany imported refined sugar. The kinds of tickets to be furnished by the respective supervisors, and accounted for to them. The observance of this regulation to be secured by proper penalties.  
The Act which lays a duty on carriages for the conveyance of persons, exempts from the duty carriages usually and chiefly Employed in husbandry, and in carrying commodities. It is a material defect in this Act, as has been already experienced, that it provides no summary mode for determining what carriages are within the exempting description. Now, every disputed case must be the subject of a suit in all the legal forms; which is equally objectionable on the score of delay and expense. It is not perceived, that any insurmountable difficulty lies in the way of providing a remedy consistently with a due reference in the last resort to the judiciary authority.  
In revenue laws, too much is as great a fault as too little Simplicity. It leaves them unprovisional; incapable of execution in a manner convenient either to the public, or to individuals.  
The Acts imposing duties on licences for selling wines and Spirituous liquors, at retail, and upon Sales at auction, authorize allowances not exceeding two and a half per cent for compensation to officers, and for incidental expenses. The Acts laying duties upon carriages for the conveyance of persons, and upon snuff and refined sugar, makes no provision for such compensations, or other expenses of collection. It is the opinion of the Secretary, that the rate of two and a half per cent in the two first mentioned Acts, is inadequate—that it ought to be extended to five per cent; and that an equal provision should be made for the expense of collection, under the two last mentioned Acts.  
The restrictions upon Officers of the Customs, and upon the Supervisors and other officers of inspection, with regard to the public funds, appear to the Secretary, unnecessary and inconvenient; unnecessary, because those officers having no concern whatever, with any branch of public business, that respects the management of the funds, can have no official influence upon the policy or execution of the measures which regard them, further than by a punctual collection of the revenues; inconvenient, because it deprives them of a mean of investing any little sums they may save or acquire, in a mode very convenient to men, who, from situation, are less able to avail themselves of other opportunities. If the being Stock-holders, can have any influence upon them, as officers, it must be of a kind favorable to the public Service, by increasing their personal interest in the exact collection of the revenue. If the idea which dictated the restrictions, was, that they might use the public money in speculations in Stock, the answer is, that this is not in their power, from the rapidity with which it is transferred to the Treasury; and if it were practicable for them to divert the public money, and a disposition to do it should in any case exist, it might operate through other channels. In lieu of the restrictions concerning the funds, the employment of public money for private purposes, may, if thought necessary, be still further guarded against, by penalties. Those restrictions in reference to the immediate officers of the Treasury department, and the Commissioners of Loans, are entirely proper, and ought to be maintained; but it is believed, that it is not only useless, but injurious to give them greater extension. The multiplication of restrictions on the public officers will render greater compensations necessary, and be a source of expense to the public.  
All which is respectfully submitted,  
  
Alexander Hamilton,Secretary of the Treasury.  
Treasury Department,January, 31, 1795.  
  
  
☞ Note. Since the conclusion of this report, the Secretary has learnt, that a bill (the progress of which his peculiar situation had prevented his observing) had actually passed the two Houses, for changing the terms of six, nine and twelve months, into eight, ten and twelve. This bill, besides interfering disadvantageously with arrangements of the Treasury, founded upon the existing provisions of the laws, will, it is apprehended, tend to increase an inconvenience, which the above suggestions were meant to lessen—the too great concentration of mercantile payments. Any accidental derangement of the mercantile body, from overtrading or other cause, would, in this situation, endanger consequences to the Treasury, which it might be difficult to meet by other expedients; whereas a subdivision into Shorter and more numerous periods, by diminishing the effect, would admit in such cases, of an easy substitute. The merchants themselves are particularly interested in this question, for the re-action upon them of any embarrassment of the Treasury, might render that a general and lasting mischief, which might otherwise have been only a partial and transient disorde

Fs 60 the Toe of Repreſentatives.  
  
CCORDING to the preſent laws impoſing duties on articles imported  
Into the United Statcs, not much ſhort of &gt; of the whole amount of the  
duties is derived from articles rated ad valorem. ns  
In other nations, where this branch of revenue, as with us, is of principal,  
or very conſiderable conſequence, and where no peculiarity of ſituation has  
tended to keep the rates of duty low experience has led to contract more and  
more the number of articles rated ad valorem, and of courſe to extend the  
number of thoſe rated ſ 1 that is, according to weight, meaſure, or  
  
  
The reaſon of this is obvious. It is to guard againſt evaſions which in-  
fallibly happen in a greater or leſs degree where duties are high—lt is impoſ-  
ſible for the merchants of any conntry to have manifeſted more probity than  
thoſe of the United States, on this ſubje&amp;t—And it is firmly believed, that  
there never was one, in which illicit practices, to the diſadvantage of the  
revenue, have obtained ſo little as, hitherto, in this Vet it would be a de  
luſive expectation, that with duties ſo conſiderable as thoſe which now exiſt,  
  
@ diſpoſition will not be experienced, in ſome individuals, who carry on our  
import trade, to evade the payment of them, and this to an extent ſufficient  
to make it prudent to guard wich circumſpection, and by every reaſonable  
precaution againſt the ſucceſs of ſuch attempts. It is needleſs to repeat, that  
this will contribute as much to the intereſt of the fair trader, as to that of  
the revenue. .  
  
It is believed, chat i in our : frſtem, the method of rating ad valorem could, |  
  
with convenience, be brought within a much narrower compaſs; and it is  
  
evident, that to do ſo, will contribute e. to che Suri of the

for this purpoſe ; but if the idea is approved, it can be carried, with due  
accuracy, into effect at a future ſeſſion, by an order upon the head of this  
  
  
rates of duty.  
It may alſo be found expedient, with a ſimilar view, to adjuſt anew the pro-  
  
  
in the opinion of the Secretary, adviſable to throw them into three claſſes;  
to raiſe ſomewhat the loweſt rate, and to diminiſh conſiderably the higher  
rates. A perſuaſion 1s entertained, founded partly upon obſervation of the  
courſe of importations, that a regulation of this kind would benefit the re=  
  
  
articles. 3  
Advantages will 4110 accrue from a re- adjuſtment Xt the rates, in certain  
  
  
ent acts, into one rate, and by diſmiſſing i inconvenient fractions, which ſerve  
to perplex the calculation of the duties. Some alteration in the terms of  
credit for duties, may, it is conceived, be made with advantage. Where  
four months are allowed, three and ſix months may be ſubſtituted ; and  
  
  
  
The compenſations to inſpectors, eſpecially i in the ports where the ex-  
  
  
tive ports, urgently demand reviſion, in order to an increaſe of them.  
The ſecurity of the revenue, in every branch, turns (it will not be too  
  
  
the temptation, from indigence, to abuſe the truſt.—lIt_ is certain, that in  
many places, the preſent allowance to inſpectors, on the moſt liberal appli-  
cation of it, is inadequate to thoſe important ends.  
  
A ſimilar reaſoning will apply to thoſe officers of the principal 8 Who  
  
  
E  
ments to which they are at preſent entitled. It cannot eſcape that the ſafety  
of the revenue muſt depend on equal fidelity and due vigilance in all the diſ-  
tricts; ; elſe it may become, in many caſes, worth the while to reſort to par-  
ticular diſtricts, becauſe there is a deficiency of the one or the other. Beſides  
that it is in itſelf juſt and proper, that all who are in the public ſervice,  
ſhould receive adequate rewards for their time, attention, and trouble.  
The aggregate expence of collecting the duties on impoſt and tonnage,  
at preſent truly moderate ; a circumſtance which facilitates the extenſion of -  
allowances where they are neceſſary. The ſyſtem of the revenue- cutters  
needs reviſion. The utility of every inſtitution depends on the compe-  
tency of the agents who are to execute it. The preſent compenſations to  
officers and men, compared with what may be obtained in other ſimilar em-  
ploy ment, unaided by collateral motives, creates a degree of embarraſſment  
which very much impairs the uſefulneſs of the thing. It would have been,  
  
  
its object, if, as was early ſuggeſted by him, the officers of the cuſtoms bad ;  
had rank in the navy of the United States. .  
Wich regard to that branch of revenue, which is conſtituted by the ics  
upon ſpirits diſtilled within the United States, and upon ſtills, it is believed,  
that it would be an improvement, and one which could be now made with-  
out inconvenience, to aboliſh the option to pay by the gallon, of the ſpitits  
diſtilled in the caſes where the duties are charged on the ſtills. This will

of the ſpirits diſtilled, according to an account to be rendered on the oath of  
the party, though expedient i in the firſt experiment of the law, is objection-  
able as a permanent regulation in a double view.  
The additional diſcretionary latitude given as compenſations to the officers

retail of any other ſpirits than thoſe they themſelves diſtil.  
Or another rule may be adopted, for proportioning the tax to the extent  
  
  
(8)  
  
ſupplemental rates, according to the yearly rent or yearly value, by ap-  
praiſement of the houſe or building in which the retailer of wines or *  
tuous liquors ſhall carry on the buſineſs.  
This has been found in practice, A convenient, and, upon the whole, an  
equitable rule of proportion ; evidently more ſo than one licence with the  
| ſame duty to all dealers indiſcriminately.  
  
It is a general and a wiſe national poliey, to make theſe articles of wine  
  
  
only be effected by ſubdividing the duties upon them in the different ſtages  
of their paſſage to the conſumer. The branch under conſideration, might  
be an important one. As it is now regulated, it is feared that it may prove  
of inconſiderable conſequence. The confining of the licences for ſelling  
ſpirituous liquors to foreign ſpirits, muſt give great facility to evaſions.  
And it has an unequal operation upon different portions of the community.  
It would promote the object of the act, which impoſes duties on ſales at  
  
auction, to allo / two and a half per centum to each auctioneer, in lieu of  
the one per centum allowed by the ninth ſection of that act.—It is believed  
  
  
incident to a compliance with the requiſitions of the law, which cannot be |  
rendered leſs particular or exact without prejudice to the revenue.  
The tax upon ſnuff, according to a rate per Ib. will be liable to very great  
evaſions, without regulations for a cloſe inſpection of the courſe of the bu-  
ſineſs—Diſpenſing with theſe, it ſeems adviſable to modify the tax upon a --  
different plan. The propoſition to lay it upon the mortar is as good a ſub-  
ſtitute as has occurred It appears, upon evidence which is credited, thata  
ſnuff mill uſually works about one half the year, that is one hundred and  
fifty-ſix working days in a year, and yields per mortar of the whole num  
ber of mortars contained in a mill, an average of forty-five pounds of ſnuff.  
per day. It follows, that five hundred and ſixty-one dollars and ſixty  
cents. per mortar, per annum, is the equivalent of the preſent duty of eight  
cents. per Ib. There are objections to this form of the tax, but as it ap-  
pears to be generally deſired by the manufacturers, it ſeems adviſable 20--  
| forego them ; eſpecially as the preſent plan demands far more rigorous pre-  
  
  
5 would be deemed expedient.  
  
( % )  
  
A ſimilar difficulty attends the tax upon refined ſugar. But a proper  
ſubſtitute for the preſent plan is not perceived—lIt will fortify the revenue,  
and produce no undue inconvenience to the manufacturer, if he be required  
to annex a ticket or tickets to each loaf of ſugar, ſpecifying the weight in  
pounds ; and to each caſk, barrel, keg, box or other package of refined  
ſugar, ſpecifying the contents and weight in pounds—correſponding certifi-  
cates or tickets to accompany imported refined ſugar. The kinds of tickets  
to be furniſhed by the reſpective ſuperviſors, and accounted for to them.  
The obſervance of this regulation to be ſecured by proper penalties.  
  
The act which lays a duty on carriages for the conveyance of perſons,  
exempts from the duty carriages z/ually and chzefly employed in huſbandry, |  
and in carrying commodities. It is a material defect in this act, as has  
been already experienced, that it provides no ſummary mode for determin-  
ing what carriages are within the exempting deſcription. Now, every diſ-  
puted caſe muſt be the ſubject of a ſuit in all the legal forms; which is  
equally objectionable on the ſcore of delay and expence. It is not per-  
ceived, that any inſurmountable difficulty lies in the way of providing a  
remedy, conſiſtently with a due reference in the laſt reſort to the Judiciary  
  
authority. =  
In revenue laws, too much is as great a fault as too little ſimplicity. 3  
- wes them unproviſional ; incapable of execution in a manner convenient 5  
either to the public or to individuals.  
  
The acts impoſing duties on licences for ſelling wines and ſpiritnous ;  
liquors at retail, and upon ſales at auction, authorize allowances not exceed-  
5 ing two and a half per cent. for compenſation to officers, and for incidental  
expences. The acts lay ing duties upon carriages for the conveyance of per-  
ſons, and upon ſnuff and refined ſugar, make no proviſion for ſuch com-  
  
  
tary, that the rate of two and a half per cent. in the two firſt mentioned  
acts, is inadequate—that it ought to be extended to five per cent. and that  
an equal proviſion ſhould be made tor the expence of collection, under the  
two laſt mentioned acts.  
The reſtrictions upon officers of the cuſtoms, and upon the ſuperviſors  
and other officers of inſpection, with regard to the public funds, appear to  
the veczetary unneceſſary and inconvenient ; unneceſſary, becauſe thoſe of-  
  
(8: 5  
  
ficers having no concern whatever with any branch of public buſineſs that  
reſpects the management of the funds, can have no official influence upon  
the policy or execution of the meaſures which regard them, further than  
by a punctual collection of the revenues; inconvenient, becauſe it deprives  
them of a mean of inveſting any little ſums they may ſave or acquire in a  
mode very convenient to men, who, from ſituation, are leſs able to ayail  
themſelves of other opportunities. If the being ſtock-holders can have any  
influence upon them as officers, it muſt be of a kind favourable to the pub-  
lic ſervice, by increaſing their perſonal intereſt in the exact collection of the  
revenue, If the idea which dictated the reſtrictions was, that they might  
uſe the public money in ſpeculations in ſtock, the anſwer is, that this is not  
in their power, from the rapidity with which it is transferred to the trea-  
ſury ; and if it were practicable for them to divert the public money, and a  
diſpoſition to do it ſhould i in any caſe exiſt, it might operate through other  
channels. In lieu of the reſtrictions concerning the funds, the employment  
of public money for private purpoſes may, if thought neceſſary, be ſtill  
further guarded againſt by penalties. &#x27;Thoſe reſtriftions, i in reference to the  
immediate officers of the treaſury department and the commiſſioners of loans,  
are entirely proper, and ought to be maintained ; but it is believed, that it  
is not only uſeleſs, but injurious to give them greater extenſion. The mul-  
tiplication of reſtrictions on the public officers will render greater compen·  
ſations neceſſary, and be a ſource of expence to the public.

Treasury in a report to the House of Repre­  
sentatives, used the following words, viz :  
&quot;According to. the present laws, imposing du-.  
lies on articles imported into the United States,  
not much short of one-lbird of the whole amount  
of the duties is derived from articles rated ad va­  
lorem.&quot;In other nr.tions where this branch of revenue,  
as with us, is of principal, or very considerable  
consequence, and where no peculiarity of situation  
has tended to keep the rates of duty low, experi­  
ence has led to contract more and more the num­  
ber of articles rated ad valorem, and of course to  
extend the number ot those rated specifically ; that  
is, according to weight, measure, or other rules of  
quantity.  
&quot; The reason of this is obvious : it is to guatd  
against evasions, which infallibly happen in a  
greater or less degree when duties are high. It is  
impossible for the merchants of any country to  
have manifested more probity than those of the U.  
States on this subject ; and it is firmly believed  
that there never was one in which illicit purcha  
j will not be experienced in some individuals, who  
&#x27;carry on our import trade, to evade the payment  
of them, and this to an extent sufficient to make it  
prudent to guard with circumspection, and by ev  
ery reasonable precaution, against the success of  
such attempts. It is needless to repeat, that this  
will -contribute as much to the interest of the fair  
trader at. to that of the revenue.  
&quot; It is believed that in our system the method of  
rating ad valorem could with convenience be bro t  
within a much narrower compass, and it is evi­  
dent that to do so will contribute materially to the  
security of the revenue&quot; See American Stat

Secretaries of the Treasury, from Alexander Hamilton to Daniel  
Manning, several of them being of Mr. Wilson’s own party. As  
this subject is so important, let us briefly cite some of these opinions:  
  
Hamilton said in 1795, after stating that experience had led other  
nations to prefer specific duties: “It is needless to repeat that this  
will contribute as much to the interest of the fair trader as to that of  
the revenue.” Gallatin, in 1801, favored specifics, “in order t
