t appeal to the mercy and commiseration of those who are torturing the remnant of my life by letters and applications, generally respectful, often kind, but always, unintentionally, increasing my exhaustless labors, and unintentionally prostrating all the ease and comfort of my life. if the expressions in that letter should have the effect of saving me from being thus killed with kindness, your book will become a blessing to me, as I hope it will be to yourself.  
To the enquiries in your’s of Nov. 23. I answer ‘say nothing of my religion. it is known to my god and myself alone. it’s evidence before the world is to be sought in my life. if that has been honest and dutiful to society the religion which has regulated it cannot be a bad one.’  
  
I repeat the assurances of my esteem and respect.
