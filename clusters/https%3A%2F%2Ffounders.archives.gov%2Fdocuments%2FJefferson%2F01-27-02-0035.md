Sir  
Philadelphia, September 5. 1793.  
  
I am honored with yours of August 30th. Mine of the 7th. of that month assured you that measures were taking for excluding, from all  
  
further asylum in our ports, vessels armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the restoration of the prizes the Lovely lass, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin, and that should the measures for restitution fail in their effect, the President considered it as incumbent on the United States to make compensation for the vessels.  
We are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations, by all the means in our power, to protect and defend their vessels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the Seas near our shores and to recover and restore the same to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are used, and fail in their effect, we are not bound, by our treaties with those nations, to make compensation.  
Though we have no similar Treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the President that we should use towards that nation the same Rule which, under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high Seas and brought into our ports, if done by vessels which had been armed within them.  
Having, for particular reasons, forborne to use all the means in our power for the restitution of the three vessels mentioned in my letter of August 7th. the President thought it incumbent on the United States to make compensation for them: and though nothing was said in that letter of other vessels taken under like circumstances, and brought in after the 5th. of June, and before the date of that letter, yet, where the same forbearance had taken place, it was and is his opinion that compensation would be equally due.  
As to prizes made under the same circumstances and brought in after the date of that letter, the President determined that all the means in our power should be used for their restitution. If these fail, as we should not be bound by our treaties to make compensation to the other powers, in the analogous case, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But still, if any cases shall arise subsequent to that date, the circumstances of which shall place them on similar ground with those before it, the President would think compensation equally incumbent on the United States.  
Instructions are given to the Governors of the different States to use all the means in their power for restoring prizes of this last description found within their ports. Though they will of course take measures to be informed of them, and the general Government has given them the aid of the custom house officers for this purpose, yet you will be sensible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as shall depend on yourself, or any persons under your direction, in order that the governors may use the means in their power, for making  
  
restitution. Without knowledge of the capture, they cannot restore it. It will always be best to give the notice to them directly: but any information which you shall be pleased to send to me also, at any time, shall be forwarded to them as quickly as distance will permit.  
Hence you will percieve, Sir, that the President contemplates restitution or compensation in the cases before the 7th. of august, and, after that date, restitution, if it can be effected by any means in our power: and that it will be important that you should substantiate the fact that such prizes are in our ports or waters.  
Your list of the privateers, illicitly armed in our ports, is, I believe correct.  
With respect to losses by detention, waste, spoliation, sustained by vessels taken as beforementioned between the dates of June 5. and Aug. 7. it is proposed, as a provisional measure, that the Collector of the Customs of the district, and the British Consul, or any other person you please, shall appoint persons to establish the value of the vessel and Cargo, at the times of her capture, and of her arrival in the port into which she is brought, according to their value in that port. If this shall be agreeable to you and you will be pleased to signify it to me, with the names of the prizes understood to be of this description, instructions will be given accordingly to the Collectors of the Customs where the respective vessels are. I have the honor to be with great respect, Sir,

power for the reftitution of the  
three veffels mentioned in my let-  
ter of Auguft 7th, the Prefident  
thought itincumbentontheUnited  
States to make compenfation for  
them: And though nothing was  
faid in that letter of other veflels  
taken under like circumftances and  
brought in after the sth of June,  
and before the date of that letter,  
yet when the fame forbearance had  
taken place it was and is his opi-  
union, that compenfation would be  
equally due.  
  
As to prizes made under the  
fame circumftances, and brought  
in after the date of that letter, the  
Prefident determined, that all the  
means in our power fhould be ufed  
for their reftitution. If thefe fail,  
as we fhould not be bound bv our  
treaties to make compenfation to  
the other powers in the analogous  
cafe, he did not mean to give an  
Opinion that it ought to be done  
to Great-Britain. But ftill, if any  
cafes fhall arife fubfequent to that  
date, the circum‘tances of which  
ihall place them on fimilar ground  
with thofe before it, the Prefident  
would think compenfation equally  
incumbent on the United States.  
  
Tnftructions are given to the go-  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
vernors of the different ftates toufe  
all the means in their power for  
reftoring prizes of this laft defcrio-  
tion found within their ports.  
Though they will of. courfe take  
meafures to be informed of them,  
and the general government has  
given them the aid of the cuftom-  
houfe officers for this-purpofe, vet  
you will be fenfible of the in:-  
portance of multiplying the chan-  
nels of their information as far as  
fhall depend on yourfelf, or any  
perfon under your direction, in  
order that the governors may ufe  
the means in their power for  
making reftitution.  
  
Without knowledge of the cap-  
ture they cannot reftore it. It  
will always be beft to give the no-  
tice to them direétly ; but any in-  
formation which you fhall. be  
pleafed to fend to me alfo at any  
time, fhall be forwarded to them  
as quickly as diftance will permit.  
  
Hence you will perceive, Sir,  
that the Prefident contemplates  
reftitution or compenfation in the  
cafes before the 7th of Auguft; and  
after that date, reflitution, if it  
can be effeéted by any means in  
our power. And that it will be  
important that you fhould fub-  
ftantiate the faét, that fuch prizes  
are in our ports or waters.  
  
Your lift of the privateers illi-  
citly armed in our ports is, I be-  
lieve, correct.

| Phliladelphia, Sept. 5, 1793.  
F Sißr,  
I&#x27;am honoured with yours of August 3oth.  
- Mine of the 7th of that month aflured you that  
- mealures were taken for excluding from all  
further alylum in our ports veilcls armed in  
them to cruize on nations with which we are at  
- peace, and for the reltoraiion of the prizes the  
Lovely Lass, Prince William Heury, and the  
-~ Jane of Dublin ; and that {hould the measures  
~tor restitution fail in their effeét, the President  
-considered 1t as incumbent on the United States  
to make compeniation tor the veflcls.  
‘We are bound by our Treaties with three of  
the belligerent nations, by all the means in our  
power to protett and defend their veflels and  
effetts in Qur ports, or waters, or on the seas  
near our {hores, and to recover and restore the  
{ame to the right owners when taken from them.  
If all the means in our power are uled, and fail  
in their effeét, we are not bound by our Treaues  
~with those natiens to make compensation.  
Though we have no similar Treaty with  
Great-Britain, it was the opinion of the Presi­  
dent, that we should use towards that natien  
the fame rule, which, under this article, was o  
govern us with the other nations ; and even to  
extend it to captures made on the high seas, and  
brought Into our ports ; if done by veflels which  
had been armeéd within them.  
  
Having, tor parucular reasons, forboie to  
afe all the means in our power for the refti­  
tation of the three vellels mentioned in my letter  
of Augult 7th, the President thought it incum­  
bent on the United States to make compeafation  
for them : And though nothing was {aid in that  
letter of other veilels taken under like circum­  
{tances and brougit 1n after the sth of June,  
and before the date of that letter, yet when the  
faine forbearance had taken place it was and is  
his opinien, that compensation would be equal­  
ly due.  
As to prizes made under the fame circum­  
stances, and bro’t in aftcr the date of that letier  
the President deteimincd, that all the means 1o  
our power should be used for their restitution.  
It thele fail, as we should not be bound by our  
treaties to make compensation to the other  
powers in the analogous cale, he did not mean  
to give an opinion that it ought to be done to  
Great-Britain, But still if any cases shall arise  
{ublequent to that date, the circumstances of  
which shall place them on similar ground with  
thole before It, the Piefident would think com­  
pensation equally iucumbent on the United  
States. ;  
Inftruttions are given to the Governors of  
the different States to use all the means in their  
power for restoring prizes of this last delcription  
tound within their ports.. Thongh they will  
of course take meal{)u&#x27;cs to be informed ot them,  
and the general government has given them the  
aid of the cultom houle officers foi this purpose,  
yet you will be sensible of the iwportance of  
muluplying the chammels of their information  
as far as shall depend onayourlelf, or any person  
under your diretion, in order that the Gov­  
ernors may use the means in their power for  
making rcltitution. :  
Without knowledge of the capture they can­  
not reitore it. It will always be best to give  
the notice to them direétly ; but any informa­  
tion which you fkall be pleased to fend to me  
also at any time, thall be forwarded to them as  
quickly as distance will permit,  
Hence you will percetve Sir, that the Prefi­  
~dent contemplates restitution or compensation  
in the cales before the 7th August ; and after  
that date, restitution if 1t can be effeéled by any  
mcans in our power. And thac it will be im­  
portant that yoa should substantiate the fact,  
that such prizes are in our ports or waters.  
Your lift of the privateers illicitly armed in  
our ports 15, I believe, correét. ‘  
With refpelt to losses by detention, waste,  
(poliction sustained by veflcls taken s beforz­  
  
mentioned betweea the dates of June sth, and  
August 7th, it is proposed as a provisional mea- l  
sure, that the Collettor of the Ouﬂoms of the  
Diftriét, and the British Consul, or any other  
person you please, shall appoint persons to e­  
stablish the value of the veflel and cargo, at the  
ume of her capture and of her arrival in the  
port into which she is brought, according to  
their value in that port. If this shall be agree­  
able to you, and vou will be plealed to figni­  
fy it to me, with the names of the prizes un­  
derflood to be of this defeription, inftruftions  
will be given accordingly ‘o the Colletor of the  
Customs where the refpettive veflels are.

Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1795.  
-&#x27; Sir,  
I am honored with yours of Au­  
guft 50. Mine of the 7th of that  
month allured you that meafures  
were taken for excluding from all  
further afylum in our ports veflels  
armed in them to cruife on nations  
with which we are at peace, and for  
the reftoration of the prizes the  
Lovely Lafs, Prince William Hen­  
ry, and the Jane of Dublin; and  
, that fhould the meafures for refti­  
&quot; tution fail in their effect, the Prefi,  
dent confidered it as incumbent,  
on the United States to make com­  
penfation for the veflels.  
We are bound by our Treaties  
with three of the beligerent nati-s  
ons, by all the means &#x27;m our power  
to protect and defend their veflels  
and effects in our ports, or waters,  
or on the feas near our fhores, and  
to recover and reftore the fame to  
the right owners when taken from  
them. If all the means in our pow­  
er are ufed, and fail in their effect,  
we are not botlnd by our treaties  
with thofe nations to make compen­  
fation.Though we have no fimilar Treaty  
with Great Britain, it was the opi­  
nion of the Prefident thar we fhouid  
ufe towards that nation the fame  
rule,-which, under this article,-was  
to govern us with the other nations ;  
and even to extend it. to captures  
made on the high feas, and brought  
into our&#x27;ports ; if done by vef­  
fels which had been armed within  
them.  
Having, for particular reafons,  
forbore to ufe all the means in our  
povyer for the reftitution of the three  
veflels mentioned in my letter of  
Auguft 7tb, the prefident thought  
it incumbent on the United States  
to make compenfation for them;  
And tho nothing was faid in that  
letter of other veflels taken under  
like circumftances and brought in  
after the 5th of June, and before  
the date of that letter, yet when  
the fame forbearance had taken  
place, it was and is his opinion,  
that compenfation would be equal­  
ly due. 6,  
As to prizes made under the fame  
circumftances, and brought in after  
the date of -that letter, the Prefi­  
dent determined, that all the means  
in our power mould be ufed for  
their reffitutions. If thefc fail, as  
we fhould not be bound by our trea­  
ties to make compenfation to the  
other powers in the analogous cafe,  
he did not mean to give an opinion  
that it ought to be done to Great  
Britain. But ftill if any cafes fhall  
arifc fubfequent to that date, the  
circumftances of which fhall place  
them on fimilar ground with thofe  
before it, the Prefident would think  
compenfation equally incumbent on  
the United States.  
  
Inltru&amp;ions are given to the Go­  
vernors of the ditterent ftates to  
ufe all the means in their power for  
reftoring prizes of this lalt descrip­  
tion found within their ports.  
Though they will of courfe take  
meafures to be informed of them,  
and the general government has &quot;  
given them the aid of the cufiom­  
houfe officers for this purpofe, yet  
yotrwill be fenfible of the impor­  
tance of multiplying the channel of  
their information as far as fhall de­  
pend on yqurfelf, or any perfon un­  
der your direction, in order that;,  
the Governors may ufe the means  
in their power for making refti­  
tution.tlmjitjcnowledge of the cap­  
tu re they cannot reftore it. It will  
always be beft to give the notice to  
them directly ; but any informati­  
on which you fhall be pleafed to  
fend to me alfo at any time, fhall  
be forwarded to them as quickly as  
diftance will permit,  
Hence you . will perceive, Sir,  
that the Prefident contemplates  
reftitution or compenfation in the  
cafes before the 7th Auguft ; and  
after thatdate, reftitution if it can  
be effected by an means in bur  
power. And that it will be impor­  
tant that you fhould fubftantiate the  
fact, that fuch prizes are in our  
ports or waters.  
Your lift of the privatercs illicit­  
ly armed in our ports, is I believe,  
correct.  
With refpect tolofles by detenti­  
oh, wafte, fpoliation fuftained by  
veflels tijeen as before-mentioned  
between the dates of June 5th and  
Auguft 7th, it is propofed as a pro­

Six, Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1793.  
  
{am honoured with your&#x27;s of Auguft  
30. Mine of the 7th of that month af-  
{ured you, that meafures weve taken for  
excluding from all turther afylum in our  
ports, vellels armed in them to cruife on  
nations with which we are at peace, and  
for the reftoration of the prizes, the Love-  
ly Lats, Prince William Henry, and the  
Jane, of Dublin ; and that fhouid the meas  
{ures Sor veltitution fail in-their etf:&amp;, the  
  
refident confidered it as ingumbent on the  
nited States to make compentation for  
the veffels.  
  
We are bound by our treaties with  
three of the Belligerent nations, by all the  
means in our power to protest and defend  
their veffels and effects um our ports or wa-  
ters, or on the feas near our fhores, and to  
recover and reftore the fame to the right  
owners when taken from them. If all the  
means in our power are uled, and fail ia  
their effeSt, we are not bound by our trea-  
ties with thofe nations ta make compen-  
fation.  
  
Though we have no frmilar treaty with  
Great-Britain, it was the opinion of the  
prefident, that we thould wie toward that  
nation the fame rule, which, under this  
article, was to govern us with the other  
rations ; and even&#x27;toéxtend it to captures  
made on the high feas, and brought into  
our ports, if done by velléls which had  
been armed within them.  
  
Having, for particular reafons, forbore  
to ufe all the means in our power for the  
reftitution of the three veffels mentioned in  
my letter of Augult 7, the prefident thought  
x meumbent on the United States fo make  
  
1  
  
compenfation for them. And though no.  
thing was faid in that letter of other vet-  
fels taken under like circumftances, ang  
brought in after the fifth of June, and be.  
fore the date of that letter, yet when the  
fame forbearance had taken place, it was  
and is his opinion, that compenfation  
wonld be equally due.  
  
As to priges made under theme cir-  
cumttances, and brought in after the date  
of the above letter, the prefident deter-  
mined, that all the means in our power  
fhould be ufed for their reititution. I€  
thefe fuil, as we fhould net be bound by  
our treaties to make compenfation to the  
ether powers in the analogeus cale, he did  
not mean to give an opinion that it ought  
to be done to Great-Britain. But til,  
if any cafe fhali ariie fublequent to that  
date, the circumstances of which hhall place  
them on fimilar ground with thofe before  
it, the prefadent would think compenfa-  
tion equally incum ent on the Gaited  
States.  
  
Inftru&amp;tions are given to the governors  
of the different (tates, to mfe all the means  
ip their power for reftoring prizes of this  
Jatt defcription, found within their ports.  
Though they wil! of courfe take meafures  
to be informed of them, and the general  
government had given the aid of the cuf-  
tom-houle officers for this purpofe, yet  
you will bg fentible of the importance of  
multiplying the channels of their infor-  
mation, as far as fhail depend on yourfelt,  
or any perfon under your direétion, in  
order s@pat -the governors may ufe the  
means in their power for making reftitu *  
tion. - .  
  
Without knowledge of the capture they  
cannot reftore it. It will always be belt  
to give the notice to them directly ; but  
any informatian which you fhail be pleafed.  
te fend to me at any time fhali be for-  
warded to them as quickly as dittance will  
permit. vt  
  
Hence you will perceive, fir, that the  
prefident contemplates reftitution or coni-  
penfation in the cafes before the 7th of  
Auguft ; and after that date, reftitution  
if it can be effeSted by amy means in-our  
power. And that it will be important  
that you fhoutd fubftantiate the fact, that  
fuch prizes are in our ports or waters.  
  
Your litt of the privateers illicitly arm-  
ed in our ports, is, I believe, correét.  
  
With retpeét to lofles by detention,  
wafle, or {poliation, fuftained by veilels  
taken as beforementioned, between the  
dates of June sth and Augutt 7th, ic is  
— as a provifional mealure, that

at the time of her capture, and of ber ar-  
rival in the port, into which the is brought,  
atcurding to their value in that port. If  
thjs thall be agrecable to you, and you  
  
will be pleafed to fignify it to me, with  
the names ‘of the prizes underftood to he

Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1794-  
818  
  
I AM honoured with yours, of Auguſt 30. Mine of the yth  
of that month aſſured you, that meaſures were taken for excluding  
from all further aſylum in our ports, veſſels armed in them to cruize  
on nations with which we are at peace, and for the reſtoration of the  
izes the Lovely Laſs, Prince William Henry, and the Jane, of  
Dublin z and that ſhould the meaſures for reſtitution fail in their effect,  
the Preſident conſidered it as incumbent on the United States to make.  
compenſation for the veſſels.  
We are bound, by our treaties with three of the belligerent na-  
tions, by all the means in our power, to protect and defend their  
yeſſels and eſſects in our ports, or waters, or on the ſeas near our  
ſhores, and to recover and reſtore the ſame to the right owners, when  
taken from them. If all the means in our power are uſed, and fail  
in their effect, we are not bound, by our treaties with thoſe nations,  
to make compenſation.  
  
Though we have no ſimilar treaty with Great Britain, it was the  
opinion of the Preſident, that we ſhould uſe, towards that nation, the  
ſame rule, which, under this article, was to govern us with the  
other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high  
ſeas, and brought into our ports, if done by veſſels which had been  
armed within them.  
  
Having, for particular reaſons, forbore to uſe all the means in our  
  
wer for the reſtitution of the three veſſels mentioned in my letter  
of Auguſt 7th, the Preſident thought it incumbent on the Ur ited  
States to make compenſation for them; and though nothing was ſaid  
in that letter of other veſſels, taken under like circumſtances, and  
brought in after the fifth of June, and before the date of that letter,  
yet, when the ſame forbearance had taken place, it was, and is, his  
opinion, that compenſation would be equally due.  
  
As to prizes made under the fame circumſtances, and brought in  
after the date of that letter, the Preſident determined that all the  
means in our power ſhould be uſed for their reſtitution. If theſe fall,  
as we ſhould not be bound by our treaties to make compenſation ta  
other powers in the anelogous caſe, he did not mean to give an op  
  
26 Ms. JEFFERSON TO Ms. HAMMOND.  
  
nion that it ought to be done to Great Britain. But till, if any  
caſes ſhall ariſe ſabſequent to that date, the circumſtances of which  
ſhall place them on ſimilar ground with thoſe before it, the Preſident  
would think compenſation equally incumbent on the United States.  
  
Inſtructions are given to the governors of the different ſtates, to uſe  
all the means in their power for reſtoring prizes of this laſt deſcrip-  
tion found within their ports. Though they will of courſe take mea-  
ſures to be informed of them, and the general government has given  
them the aid of the cuſtom-honſe officers for this purpoſe ; yet you will  
be ſenſible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their infor-  
mation as far as ſhall depend on yourſelf, or any other perſon under  
your direction, in order that the governors may uſe the means in  
their power for making reſtitution.  
  
  
always be beſt to give the notice to them directly; but any informa-  
tion which you ſhall be pleaſed to ſend to me, ao, at any time, ſhall  
be forwarded to them as quickly as diſtance will permit. |  
  
Hence you will ive, Sir, that the Prefident contemplates re-  
ſtitution or compenſation in the caſes before the 7th of Auguſt; and,  
after that date, reſtitution if it can be effected by any means in our  
power. And that it will be important that you ſhould ſubſtantiate  
the fact, that ſuch prizes are in our ports or waters.  
  
Your liſt of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports, is, I be-  
lieve, correct. |  
  
With reſpect to loſſes by detention, waſte, ſpoliation ſuſtained by  
veſſels taken as before mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and  
Auguſt 7th, it is propoſed as a proviſional meaſure, that the collector  
of the cuſtoms of the diſtri, and the Britiſh conſul, or any other per-  
fon you pleaſe, ſhall appoint perſons to eſtabliſh the valne of the veſſel  
and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port  
into which ſhe js brought, according to their value in that port. If  
this ſhall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleaſed to ſignify it  
to me, with the names of the prizes underſtood to be of this deſerip-  
tion, inſtructions will be given accordingly, to the collectors of the  
  
cuſtoms where the reſpective veſſels are.  
I have the honour to be, &amp;c. |

We are bound by our treaties with three of the bel-

tect and defend their veſſels and effects in our ports, or

compenſation would be equally due.

Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re-

Why? Because they had deliberately forborne to use all the means  
in their power, on account of their relations at that time with the  
Government of France. Rather than quarrel with the Government of  
France at that moment, they did not interfere ; and not having inter-

paid compensation.

But from the date of this letter, Mr. Jefferson says, ‘‘ We have got  
“¢ a statute passed which will enable us to prevent these things.” And  
mark you, that statute was the statute upon which our Foreign Enlist-  
ment Act was framed, and, consequently, we are precisely in the same  
position.—Mr. Jefferson says, being now determined to prevent these  
things, and having the means to prevent them, the President has  
determined that all the means in their power shall be used for their  
restitution :—  
  
“* If these fail us, we should not be bound by our treaties to make  
‘** compensation to the other Powers in the analogous cases; he did  
* not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great Britain.  
** But still, if any cases shall arise subsequent to that date, the circum-  
‘* stances of which shall place them on similar ground with those before  
“it, the President would think compensation equally incumbent on the  
** United States.”

‘** Hence you will perceive, Sir, that the President contemplates  
‘* restitution or compensation in the case before the 7th of August ;  
‘“‘ and after that date, restitution if it can be effected by any means in  
‘ our power; and that it will be important you should substantiate the  
** facts that such prizes are in our ports or waters.”  
  
You see, compensation for cases where vessels had been allowed  
deliberately to escape; restitution if they came within the limits and  
under the authority of the United States ; but no compensation if they  
had employed all the means in their power to prevent it; nor in any  
case where the prizes were not brought within the American jurisdic-  
tion. My paper now proceeds :—  
  
‘¢ The principles laid down in this despatch are simple and satisfactory.

“ Having for particular reasons forborne to use all the measures  
in our power for the restitution of the three vessels mentioned in  
my letter of August 7th, the President thought it incumbent on the  
United States to make compensation for them ; and, though nothing  
was said in that letter of other vessels taken under like circum-  
stances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the President  
determined that all the means in our power should be used for their  
restitution. If these fail us, as we should not be bound by our  
treaties to make compensation to the other powers, in the analogous  
case, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done  
to Great Britain. But still, if any cases shall arise subsequent to  
that date, the circumstances of which shall place them on similar  
grounds with those before it, the President would think compensa-  
tion equally incumbent on the United States” (Jefferson’s Works
