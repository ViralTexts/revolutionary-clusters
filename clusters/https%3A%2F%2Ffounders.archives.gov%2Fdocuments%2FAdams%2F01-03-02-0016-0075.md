20, the day after the election, the  
Provincial Congress adopted the arti-  
cles of Association, as yet the only  
measure recommended by the Conti-  
nental Congress, engaging themselves  
to defend the United Colonies against  
the hostile attempts of the British  
Parliament. After the election of the  
19th, there could be no further doubt  
as to the determination of New York  
in favor of absolute separation from  
the crown; but it is also plain that  
this action placed it out of the power  
of the New York delegation at Phila-  
delphia to vote for independence, or  
for the Provincial Congress in New  
York to instruct them sotovote. The  
popular will had elected a body espe-

colony—a sufficient answer to the

In March, 1776, the Continental congress recommended  
to the several assemblies, conventions, or committees of  
safety of the United Colonies to immediately cause all  
persons in their respective colonies who are notoriously  
disaffected to the cause of America, or who have not asso-  
ciated, and refuse to associate, to defend the arms of the  
United Colonies against the British fleets and armies, to be  
disarmed. In compliance with this recommendation the  
selectmen of Claremont made a thorough canvass. Of  
male inhabitants of 21 years of age and upward, 84 signed  
a declaration or pledge to defend by arms the American  
colonies, 16 had taken up arms and were actually in the  
Continental army, and 31 refused to sign.  
  
Prior to 1778, and until about the close of the war, there  
were but two school houses in town—one on Town Hill  
and the other near Union church. The Whigs sent their
