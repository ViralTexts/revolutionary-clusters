 And be not thou disturbed, O grave and sober Reader, if among the many serious Sentences in my Book, thou findest me trifling now and then, and talking idly. In all the Dishes I have hitherto cook’d for thee, there is solid Meat enough for thy Money. There are Scraps from the Table of Wisdom, that will if well digested, yield strong Nourishment to thy Mind. But squeamish Stomachs cannot eat without Pickles; which, ’tis true are good for nothing else, but they provoke an Appetite. The Vain Youth that reads my Almanack for the sake of an idle Joke, will perhaps meet with a serious Reflection, that he may ever after be the better for

Teague’s Criticism on the First of Genesis.  
  
Arra, now, what shignifies the making the two great Lights  
The shun to rule the Day, and the Mhoon to rule the Nights?  
For the shun in the Day-time there ish no Ochashun;  
Because we can she vhery whell all over the Nashun.  
But for the Mhoons, they are very good in a dark Night,  
Becaush, when we can’t shee, they give us a Light.  
  
XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.  
  
Giles Jolt, as sleeping in his Cart he lay,  
Some pilfring Villains stole his Team away;  
Giles wakes and cries—What’s here? a dickins, what?  
Why, how now?—Am I Giles? or am I not?  
If he, I’ve lost six Geldings, to my Smart;  
If not,—odds buddikens, I’ve found a Cart.  
  
  
When Death puts out our Flame, the Snuff will tell,  
If we were Wax, or Tallow by the Smell.  
  
At a great Pennyworth, pause a while.  
  
As to his Wife, John minds St. Paul, He’s one  
That hath a Wife, and is as if he’d none.  
  
Kings and Bears often worry their Keepers.  
XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.  
  
Lord, if our Days be few, why do we spend,  
And lavish them to such an evil End?  
Or, why, if they be evil, do we wrong  
Our selves and thee, in wishing them so long?  
Our Days decrease, our evils still renew,  
We make them ill, thou kindly mak’st them few.  
  
  
If thou wouldst live long, live well; for Folly and Wickedness shorten Life.

I Mon. March hath xxxi days.  
  
Thus with kind Words, ’squire Edward chear’d his Friend:  
Dear Dick! thou on my Friendship mayst depend;  
I know thy Fortune is but very scant;  
But, be assur’d, I’ll ne’er see Dick in Want.  
Dick’s soon confin’d—his Friend, no doubt, would free him:  
His Word he kept—in Want he ne’er would see him.  
  
He that pays for Work before it’s done, has but a pennyworth for twopence.  
Historians relate, not so much what is done, as what they would have believed.  
  
O Maltster! break that cheating Peck; ’tis plain,  
When e’er you use it, you’re a Knave in Grain.  
  
II Mon. April hath xxx days.  
  
For’s Country Codrus suffer’d by the Sword,  
And, by his Death, his Country’s Fame restor’d;  
Caesar into his Mother’s Bosom bare  
Fire, Sword, and all the Ills of civil War:  
Codrus confirm’d his Country’s wholesome Laws;  
Caesar in Blood still justify’d his Cause;  
Yet following Kings ne’er ’dopted Codrus’ Name,  
But Caesar, still, and Emperor’s the same.  
  
  
Doll learning propria quae maribus without book,  
Like Nomen crescentis genitivo doth look.  
  
  
Grace then thy House, and let not that grace thee.  
Thou canst not joke an Enemy into a Friend; but thou may’st a Friend into an Enemy.  
  
Eyes and Priests  
Bear no Jests.  
  
III Mon. May hath xxxi days.  
  
Think, bright Florella, when you see  
The constant Changes of the Year,  
That nothing is from Ruin free,  
And gayest Things must disappear.  
Think of your Beauties in their bloom,  
The Spring of sprightly Youth improve;  
For cruel Age, alas, will come,  
And then ’twill be too late to love.  
  
He that falls in love with himself, will have no Rivals.  
Let thy Child’s first Lesson be Obedience, and the second may be what thou wilt.  
Blessed is he that expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.  
Rather go to bed supperless, than run in debt for a Breakfast.  
IV Mon. June hath xxx days.  
On his late Deafness.  
  
Deaf, giddy, helpless, left alone,  
To all my Friends a Burthen grown,  
No more I hear a great Church Bell,  
Than if it rang out for my Knell:  
At Thunder now no more I start,  
Than at the whisp’ring of a F--t.  
Nay, what’s incredible, alack!  
I hardly hear my Bridget’s Clack.

Ships sailing down Delaware Bay this Month, shall hear at ten Leagues Distance a confus’d rattling Noise, like a Shower of Hail on a Cake of Ice. Don’t be frighted, good Passengers! The Sailors can inform you, that it’s nothing but Lower County Teeth in the Ague. In a Southerly Wind you may hear it at Philadelphia. Witness G.L.M. cum multis aliis.  
If thou injurest Conscience, it will have its Revenge on thee.  
Hear no ill of a Friend, nor speak any of an Enemy.  
Pay what you owe, and you’ll know what’s your own.

The Sun now clear, serene the golden Skies,  
Where’er you go, as fast the Shadow flies;  
A Cloud succeeds; the Sunshine now is o’er,  
The fleeting phantom fled, is seen no more;  
With your bright Day, its Progress too does end:  
See here vain Man! the Picture of thy Friend.  
  
Beware of him that is slow to anger: He is angry for something, and will not be pleased for nothing.  
No longer virtuous no longer free; is a Maxim as true with regard to a private Person as a Common-wealth.  
  
When Man and Woman die, as Poets sung,  
His Heart’s the last part moves, her last, the tongue.  
  
VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days.  
  
What Legions of Fables and whimsical Tales  
Pass current for Gospel where Priestcraft prevails!  
Our Ancestors thus were most strangely deceiv’d,  
What Stories and Nonsense for Truth they believ’d!  
But we their wise Sons, who these Fables reject,  
Ev’n Truth now-a-days, are too apt to suspect:  
From believing too much, the right Faith we let fall;  
So now we believe—’troth nothing at all.  
  
Proclaim not all thou knowest, all thou owest, all thou hast, nor all thou canst.  
Let our Fathers and Grandfathers be valued for their Goodness, ourselves for our own.  
  
Industry need not wish.  
Sin is not hurtful because it is forbidden but it is forbidden because it’s hurtful.  
IX Mon. November hath xxx days.  
  
Pinchall, possessing Heaps of Wealth,  
Lives miserably poor;  
He says, ’tis to preserve his Health,  
But means by it, his Store.  
Let Freeman but the Wretch invite  
To dine on Good-Cheer gratis,  
Then he will gorge, like half-starv’d Wight,  
And cram his Nunquam satis.  
  
Nor is a Duty beneficial because it is commanded, but it is commanded, because it’s beneficial.  
  
A—, they say, has Wit; for what?  
For writing?—No; For writing not.  
  
  
George came to the Crown without striking a Blow.  
Ah! quoth the Pretender, would I could do so.

In Travel, Pilgrims oft do ask, to know  
What Miles they’ve gone, and what they have to go:  
Their Way is tedious and their Limbs opprest,  
And their Desire is to be at rest.  
In Life’s more tedious Journey, Man delays  
T’enquire out the Number of his Days:  
He cares, not he, how slow his Hours spend,  
The Journey’s better than the Journey’s End.  
  
Love, and be lov’d.  
  
O Lazy-Bones! Dost thou think God would have given thee Arms and Legs, if he had not design’d thou should’st use them.  
  
A Cure for Poetry,  
Seven wealthy Towns contend for Homer, dead,  
Thro’ which the living Homer beg’d his Bread.  
  
Great Beauty, great strength, and great Riches, are really and truly of no great Use; a right Heart exceeds all.  
  
On the Law.  
Nigh Neighbour to the Squire, poor Sam complain’d  
Of frequent Wrongs, but no Amends he gain’d.  
Each Day his Gates thrown down, his Fences broke,  
And injur’d still the more, the more he spoke;  
At last, resolv’d his potent Foe to awe,  
A Suit against him he began in Law;  
Nine happy Terms thro’ all the Forms he run,  
Obtain’d his Cause—had Costs—and was undone.

g at a Loss. During the first visible Eclipse Saturn is retrograde: For which Reason the Crabs will go sidelong, and the Rope-makers backward. The Belly will wag before, and the A--- shall sit down first. Mercury will have his share in these Affairs, and so confound the Speech of People, that when a Pensilvanian would say Panther, he shall say Painter. When a New-Yorker thinks to say (This) he shall say (Diss) and the People in New-England and Cape-May will not be able to say (Cow) for their lives, but will be forc’d to say (Keow) by a certain involuntary Twist in the Root of their Tongues. No Connecticut-Man nor Marylander will be able to open his Mouth this Year, but (Sir) shall be the first or last Syllable he pronounces, and sometimes both. Brutes shall speak in many Places, and there will be above seven and twenty irregular Verbs made this Year, if Grammar don’t interpose. Who can help these Misfortunes!  
  
  
Of the Diseases this Year.  
This Year the Stone-blind shall see but very little; the Deaf shall hear but poorly; and the Dumb shan’t speak very plain. And it’s much, if my Dame Bridget talks at all this Year. Whole Flocks, Herds and Droves of Sheep, Swine and Oxen, Cocks and Hens, Ducks and Drakes, Geese and Ganders shall go to Pot; but the Mortality will not be altogether so great among Cats, Dogs and Horses. As for old Age, ’twill be incurable this Year, because of the Years past. And towards the Fall some People will be seiz’d with an unaccountable Inclination to roast and eat their own Ears: Should this be call’d Madness, Doctors? I think not.—But the worst Disease of all will be a certain most horrid, dreadful, malignant, catching, perverse and odious Malady, almost epidemical, insomuch that many shall run Mad upon it; I quake for very Fear when I think on’t; for I assure you very few will escape this Disease; which is called by the learned Albumazar, Lacko’mony.

On a visit to a certain seaport town inthis country, Burns  
entered into a warm discussion on religious topics with a per-  
son named Andrew Turner, who was famed for deistical prin-  
\ciples, and what John Bunyan would have denominated an  
  
“ill favored” countenance. The poet was worsted in the ar-  
| gument, at which he felt nettled, and vented his spleen in  
| the following impromptu.  
| ____ Tt happened once upon a time,  
The de’il got stuff to make a swine  
And laid it in a corner ;  
  
But after that he chang’d his plan,

EVILS OF LIFE.  
Lord! if our days be few, why do we spend  
And lavish them to such an evil end ?  
  
Or why, if they be evil, do we wrong  
Ourselves and thee, in wishing them so long ?  
Our days decrease, our evils still renew,  
  
We make them evil, and thou mak’st them few.

An Astronomical Notice.  
During the first visible eclipse Saturn is retrograde : for which  
  
reason the crabs will go sidelong, and the rope-makers back-  
ward. Mercury will have his share in these affairs, and so con-  
found the speech of the people, that when a Pennsylvanian  
would say panther, he shall say painter. Whena New Yorker  
thinks to say ¢his, he shall say diss, and the people in Mew  
England and Cape May will not be able to say cow for their  
lives, but will be forced to say 4eow, by a certain involuntary  
twist in the root of their tongues. No Connecticut man nor  
Marylander will be able to open his mouth this year but sir  
shall be the first or last syllable he pronounces, and sometimes  
both. Brutes shall speak in many places, and there will be  
about seven and twenty irregular verbs made this year if gram-  
mar don&#x27;t interpose. Who can help these misfortunes? This  
year the stone-blind shall see but very little ; the deaf shall hear  
but poorly ; and the dumb sha’n’t speak very plain. As to old  
age, it will be incurable this year, because of the years past.  
And toward the fall some people will be seized with an unac-  
countable inclination to roast and eat their own ears: Should  
this be called madness, doctors? Ithink not. But the worst  
disease of all will be a most horrid, dreadful, malignant, catch-  
ing, perverse, and odious malady, almost epidemical, insomuch  
that many shall seem mad uponit. I quake for very fear when  
I think on&#x27;t; for I assure you very few shall escape this disease,  
which is called by the learned Albromazer—Zacko&#x27;mony.
