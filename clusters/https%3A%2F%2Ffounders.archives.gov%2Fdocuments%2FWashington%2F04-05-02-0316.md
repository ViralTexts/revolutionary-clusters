Mount Vernon, 24th Sep. 1787.  
  
My pear Sir: I have the pleasure (in the first  
moments after iy return home) to enclose you a  
copy of the Constitution which the Federal Conven-  
tion has submitted to the people of these States.  
  
I shall make no observations thereon—your own  
judgment will point to the good and defective parts  
of it. And the experience you have had in the na-  
tional councils will readily suggest to you the diffi-  
culties which occurred in attempting to reconcile  
the various interests, jealousies, and prejudices which  
pervade the differents parts of this union. Expla-  
nation, therefore, is unnecessary.  
  
No man is more ardent in wishing that the Con-  
stitution had been more unexceptionable ; but I sin-  
cerely believe that it is the best that could be obtained  
at this time; and as a constitutional door is opened  
for amendment hereafter the adoption of it under  
present circumstances is, in my opinion, desirable.  
  
From a variety of concurting accounts it appears  
to me that the political machine is, as it were, sus-  
pended by a thread. That the Convention has been  
looked up to by the thinking part of the community  
with a sollicitude which is hardly to be conceived—  
and that, if nothing hid been agreed on by that body,  
that anarchy would have followed by hasty strides.  
The seeds of it are plentifully strewed. With th
