e the blessings of Peace.  
His Majestys Speech &amp;ca Novr 25. 79. My Lords &amp; Gentlemen I meet you in Parliament at a time when we are calld upon by every principle of Duty, and every consideration of Interest, to exert Our united Efforts in the support &amp; defence of Our Country, attackd by an unjust and unprovokd war, and contending with one of the most dangerous Confederacies that ever was formd against the Crown &amp; People of Great Britain.  
The Designs and attempts of our Enemies to invade this Kingdom, have, by the blessing of Providence, been hitherto frustrated &amp; disapointed. They still menace Us with great Armaments &amp; Preparations; But we are, I trust, on our Part, well prepard to meet every attack, &amp; repel every Insult. I know the Character of my brave People: The Menaces of their Enemies, &amp; the approach of Danger, have no other Effects on their minds, but to animate their Courage, and to call forth that national spirit, which has so often checkd, and defeated, the projects of Ambition and Injustice, and Enabled the British Fleets &amp; armies to protect their own Country, to vindicate their own rights, and at the same time, to uphold &amp; preserve, the Liberties of Europe, from the restless &amp; encroaching Power of the House of Bourbon. In the midst of my care &amp; solicitude for the safety &amp; welfare of this Country, I have not been innatentive to the State of my Loyal and Faithful Kingdom of Ireland. I have in consequence of your Address, presented to me in the last session, orderd such papers to be collected and laid before you, as may assist your Deliberations, on this important Business; and I recommend it to you to consider what further Benefits and advantages may be extended to that Kingdom, by such regulations, and such Methods, as may most effectually, promote the common strength, wealth, &amp; Interests of all my Dominions.  
Genn. of the Ho Commons  
The proper Estimates shall, in due time, be laid before you. I see with extreem concern, that the necessary Establishments of my Naval &amp; military Forces, and the various services and operations of the ensuing year, must innevitably be attended with great &amp; heavy Expences; but I rely on Your Wisdom &amp; publick Spirit for such supplies, as the circumstances &amp; Exegencies of our Affairs shall be found to require.  
My Lords &amp; Gentlemen I have great satisfaction in receiving the assurances of my intire approbation of the good Conduct and discipline of the Militia, &amp; of their steady Perseverance in their Duty; and I return my Cordial thanks to all ranks of my loyal Subjects who have stood forth in this arduous Conjuncture, &amp; by their zeal, their Influence, &amp; their personal service, have given confidence as well as strength to the national Defence. Trusting in the Divine Providence, &amp; in the justice of my Cause, I am firmly resolvd to prosecute the war with vigour, &amp; to make every exertion, in order to compel our Enemies to listen to equitable Terms of Peace and accomodation.  
This finishing part needs no comment from me— Our wicked Rulers seem to be determind to risque the last stake, and i
