to preserve the peace &amp; honor of our beloved country, are worthy of the public spirit which we have always been accustomed to expect from the state of South Carolina. fortified by this spirit, so generally prevalent among our fellow-citizens, our country stands secure against external &amp; internal enemies.  
The sense you are so kind as to express of such services as I have been able to render, is highly flattering to me, and your request that I would consent again to be a candidate for the chief magistracy of the Union, is a further evidence that the course I have pursued in that office has met your approbation. but that I should lay down my charge at a proper period, is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully. if some termination to the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the constitution, or supplied by practice, his office, nominally for years, will, in fact, become for life; and history shews how easily that degenerates into an inheritance. believing that a representative government, responsible at short periods of election, is that which produces the greatest sum of happiness to mankind, I feel it a duty to do no act which shall essentially impair that principle; and I should unwillingly be the person, who, disregarding the sound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor, should furnish the first example of prolongation beyond the second term of office.  
Truth also requires me to add that I am sensible of that decline which advancing years bring on; and, feeling their physical, I ought not to doubt their Mental effect. happy, if I am the first to percieve and to obey this admonition of nature, and to sollicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties of age.

duce you to wish a rotation in offloe;but  
we hope that that amor patrias, which  
is so natural to you, will permit pour  
name to be placed amongst the candidates  
for the next president of the United  
Stales.  
Mr. Jefferson gave himself over to  
the serious consideration of the matter  
and deferred his answer until the ex­  
citement subsided, as he said he had  
no “desire to prematurely agitate the  
public mind on such a subject.” The  
answer was finally evolved on the 10th  
of December 1807, and he sent it to the  
legislature. It read as follows:  
That I should lay down my charge at  
a proper period is as much a duty as to  
have borne it faithfully. If some ter­  
mination to the services of the chief  
magistrate be not fixed by the constitu­

and I should unwillingly bo the person,  
who disregarding the sound precedent  
set by an illustrious predecessor, should  
furnish the first example of prolongu  
tion beyond the second term of office.  
Truth also requires me to add that I  
am sensible of that decline which ad­  
vancing years bring on; and, feeling  
their physical, I ought not to doubt  
their mental effect. Happily if J am  
the first to perceive and to obey this

THE THIRD TERM. 125  
  
No one asked Mr. Adams to accepta third term. But few asked  
him to accept a second. His example, therefore, furnishes no more  
sanction to the Springer resolution than does the example of Mr.  
Washington.  
  
Mr. Jefferson furnished a precedent more to the purpose. The  
Legislatures of several States formally invited him to become a can-  
didate for a third term. He as formally declined the invitation.  
He stated his reasons for declining as follows: “That I should lay  
down my charge at a proper period is as much a duty as to have  
borne it faithfully. If some termination to the services of the Chief  
Magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution, or supplied by practice,  
his office, nominally for years, will, in fact, become for life; and

lieving that a representative government, responsible at short periods

decline which advancing years bring on; and, feeling their physi-  
cal, I ought not to doubt their mental, effect. Happy if I am the  
first to perceive and to obey this admonition of nature, and to

It is so frequently asserted that there is no Con  
stitutional provision against a third term, and that,  
therefore, there can be no violation of the Constitue  
tion in Grant&#x27;s reelection, that the following quota  
tion may be of interest as showing that in the mind  
of Thomas Jefferson there was an unwritten law as  
binding and as sacred as the written. On the ques-­  
tion of a third term he said: &quot;If some termination

by the Constirution or supplied by practice, his
