y Slave would have an easier task.  
The Tory venom has begun to spit itself forth in the publick papers as I expected, bursting with envy that an American Minister should be received here with the same marks of attention politeness and civility which is shewn to the Ministers of any other power. When a minister delivers his credentials to the king, it is always in his private closet attended only by the minister for Foreign affairs, which is called a private audience, and the Minister presented makes some little address to his Majesty, and the same ceremony to the Queen, whose replie was in these Words, “Sir I thank you for your civility to me and my family, and I am glad to see you in this Country,” then very politely inquired whether he had got a house yet? The answer of his Majesty was much longer, but I am not at liberty to say more respecting it; than that it was civil and polite, and that his Majesty said he was glad the Choice of his Country had fallen upon him. The News Liars know nothing of the Matter, they represent it just to answer their purpose. Last thursday Col. Smith was presented at Court, and tomorrow at the Queens circle my Ladyship and your Neice make our compliments. There is no oth

y morning  
  
My Head is drest for St. James and in my opinion looks very tasty. Whilst Emelias is undergoing the same operation, I set myself down composedly to write you a few lines. Well methinks I hear Betsy and Lucy say, what is cousins dress, white my Dear Girls like your Aunts, only differently trimd, and ornamented, her train being wholy of white crape and trimd with white ribbon, the peticoat which is the most showy part of the dress coverd and drawn up in what is calld festoons, with light wreaths of Beautifull flowers. The Sleaves white crape drawn over the silk with a row of lace round the Sleave near the shoulder an other half way down the arm and a 3d. upon the top of the ruffel little flowers stuck between. A kind of hat Cap with 3 large feathers and a bunch of flowers a wreath of flowers upon the hair. Thus equipd we go in our own Carriage and Mr. A and Col. Smith in his. But I must quit my pen to put myself in order for the ceremony which begins at 2 oclock. When I return I will relate to you my reception, but do not let it circulate as there may be persons eager to Catch at every thing, and as much given to misrepresentation as here. I would gladly be excused the Ceremony.  
  
  
fryday morning  
  
Congratulate me my dear sister it is over. I was too much fatigued to write a line last evening. At two a clock we went to the circle which is in the drawing room of the Queen. We past through several appartments lined as usual with Spectatirs upon these occasions. Upon entering the anti Chamber, the Baron de Linden the Dutch Minister who has been often here came and spoke with me. A Count Sarsfield a French nobleman with whom I was acquainted paid his compliments. As I passt into the drawing room Lord Carmathan and Sir Clement Cotterel Dormer were presented to me. Tho they had been several times here I had never seen them before. The sweedish the polish ministers made their compliments and several other Gentleman, but not a single Lady did I know, untill the Countess of Effingham came who was very civil. There were 3 young Ladies daughters of the Marquiss of Lothan who were to be presented at the same time and two Brides. We were placed in a circle round the drawing room which was very full, I believe 200 person present. Only think of the task the Royal family have, to go round to every person, and find small talk enough to speak to all of them. Tho they very prudently speak in a whisper, so that only the person who stands next you can hear what is said. The King enters the room and goes round to the right, the Queen and princesses to the left. The Lord in waiting presents you to the King and the Lady in waiting does the same to her Majesty. The King is a personable Man, but my dear sister he has a certain Countenance which you and I have often remarked, a red face and white eye brows, the Queen has a similar countanance and the numerous Royal family confirm the observation. Persons are not placed according to their rank in the drawing room, but tranciently, and when the King comes in he takes persons as they stand. When he came to me, Lord Onslow said, Mrs. Adams, upon which I drew of my right hand Glove, and his Majesty saluted my left cheek, then asked me if I had taken a walk to day. I could have told his Majesty that I had been all the morning prepareing to wait upon him, but I replied, no Sire. Why dont you love walking says he? I answerd that I was rather indolent in that respect. He then Bow’d and past on. It was more than two hours after this before it came to my turn to be presented to the Queen. The circle was so large that the company were four hours standing. The Queen was evidently embarrased when I was presented to her. I had dissagreeable feelings too. She however said Mrs. Adams have you got into your house, pray how do you like the Situation of it? Whilst the princess Royal looked compasionate, and asked me if I was not much fatigued, and observed that it was a very full drawing room. Her sister who came next princess Augusta, after having asked your neice if she was ever in England before, and her answering yes, inquird of me how long ago, and supposed it was when she was very young. And all this is said with much affability, and the ease and freedom of old acquaintance. The manner in which they make their tour round the room, is first the Queen, the Lady in waiting behind her holding up her train, next to her the princess royal after her princess Augusta and their Lady in waiting behind them.  
  
  
  
They are pretty rather than Beautifull, well shaped with fair complexions and a tincture of the kings countanance. The two sisters look much alike. They were both drest in lilack and silver silk with a silver netting upon the coat, and their heads full of diamond pins. The Queen was in purple and silver. She is not well shaped or handsome. As to the Ladies of the Court, Rank and title may compensate for want of personal Charms, but they are in general very plain ill shaped and ugly, but dont you tell any body that I say so. If one wants to see Beauty they must go to Ranaleigh, there it is collected in one bright constelation. There were two Ladies very elegant at court Lady Salsbury and Lady Talbot, but the observation did not in general hold good that fine feathers make fine Birds. I saw many who were vastly richer drest than your Friends, but I will venture to say that I saw none neater or more elegant, which praise I ascribe to the taste of Mrs. Temple and my Mantua Maker, for after having declared that I would not have any foil or tincel about me, th

The Tories are very free with their compliments. Scarcly a paper excapes without some scurrility. We bear it with silent Contempt, having met a polite reception from the Court. It bites them Like a serpent and stings them like an adder.

&quot;Congratulate me, mv dear sister, it is j  
over, I was too much fatigued ?o write a ,  
line last evening. At two o&#x27;clock we i  
went to the circle which is in the drawing J  
room of the Queen. We passed through  
several apartments, lined as usual with  
spectators upon.these occasions. Upon  
entering the anti-chamber, the Baron do  
Lvnden, the Dutch Minister, a Count  
Sarsfield, a Fsenoh Xohicinan, with whom  
I was accquaitcd, paid his compliments.?  
As I passed in the drawing room, Lor.!  
Carmathen and Sir Okment Cottera! Donner

Ministers made their compliments and I  
several other gentlemen; but not a single j i  
lady did I know until the Countess of J r  
Efliinghani come, who was very civil.? :s  
There were three young ladies, daughters ; ?  
of the Marquis of Lothian who were to he i&#x27;  
presented at the same time, and two i  
brides. We were placed in a circle round ; t  
the drawing-room, which was very full, j  
1 heleive two hurr&#x27;rod persons wore pres- i

family have to go round to every person, i  
and iiiid small talk snough to speak to all ?  
of them, though thev very prudently speak i  
in a whisper, so that only the person who |  
stands next to you can hear what is said, j i  
The King enters tlie room, and gees round

lias a certain countenance, which you and I  
I have often remarked; a red face and j  
white eyebrows. The Queen has a similar  
countenance, and the numerous royal  
fpciiiy confirm the observation. Persons 1  
are no* placed according to tin ir rank in I &#x27;

‘The foreign ministers, and several English lords and earls, have  
paid their compliments here, and all hitherto is civil and polite.......  
The Tory * venom has begun to spit itself forth in the public papers, as  
I expected, bursting with envy that an American minister should be  
received here with the same marks of attention, politeness, and civility,  
which are shown to the ministers of any other power. When a minister  
delivers his credentials to the King, it is always in his private closet,  
attended only by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which is called a  
private audience, and the minister presented makes some little address  
to his Majesty, and the same ceremony to the Queen, whose reply was  
in these words, “Sir, I thank you for your civility to me and my  
family, and I am glad to see you in this country;” then she very  
politely inquired whether he had got a house yet. ‘The answer of his  
Majesty was much longer ; but I am not at liberty to say more respecting  
it than that it was civil and polite, and that his Majesty said he was  
glad the choice of his country had fallen upon him. The news-liars  
know nothing of the matter; they represent it just to answer their pur-  
pose.’—vol. ii. pp. 96, 98, 99.

King’s ‘civil and polite speech’ to Mr. Adams is not true, we

England, and slept under her roof, John Adams  
aud his wife wero presented to the King and  
Queen, and Mrs. Adams wrote a description of  
the ceremony, in one of her familiar letters to a  
friend in America. The feeling between the tw  
countries was not so cordial as it is now, and  
there was an opinion prevailing iu England that  
if John Adams met his full deserts, he would  
have a halter instead of au invitation to conrt.  
But the invitation came, and Mr. and Mrs. Ad  
ams went, and Mrs. Adams related the occurrence  
to her sister, iu the following words :  
We were placed iu a circle round the drawing  
room, which was very full ; I believe two hun­  
dred persons present. Only thiuk of the task!  
The Koyal family have to go round to every  
person, and find small talk enough to speak to  
all of them, though they very prndeutly speak  
in a whisper, so that only the person who stands  
next you can hear what is said. The Kii g en­  
ters tbe room, aud goes ronnd to tho right; tbe  
Qneen aud Princesses to the left. The Lord iu  
Waiting presents you to the King ; and the Lady  
iu Waiting does the same to Her Majesty. The  
King is a personable man, but, my dear sister,  
be has a certain countenance which you and I  
have often remarked, a red face auil white, eye­  
brows. Tbe Queen has a similar countenance,  
and tbe uumerous royal family confirm the ob­  
servation. Persons are not placed according to  
their rank, bnt promiscuously; aud when the  
King comes iu, he takes persons as they stand.  
When he came to me, Lord Ouslow said, &quot;Mrs.  
Adams,&quot; npon which I drew off my right-hand  
glove, and His Majesty saluted my left check ;  
then asked me if 1 had takeu a walk to-day. I  
could have told His Majesty that I had been  
all morning preparing to wait upou him ; but I  
replied, &quot;No, Sire.&quot; &quot;Why, dou&#x27;t you love walk­  
ing t&quot; says he. I answered that I was rather in­  
dolent In that respect. He then bowed and pass­  
ed on. It was more thau two hoars after this  
before it came my turn to bo presented to the  
Queeu. The cucle was so largo that the compa­  
ny were four hours standing. The Qneen was  
evidently embarrassed when I was presented to  
her. I had disagreeable feelings, too. She, how­  
ever, said, &quot;Mrs. Adams, have you got into your  
new house T Pray, how do yon like the situa  
tion oi it I&quot; wuilst tlio Princess Koyal looked  
compassionate, aud asked me if I was not much  
fatigued, and observed that it wasa very dnil  
dran iug room. Her sister, who came next, the  
Princess Augusta, after haviug&#x27;asked your niece  
if she was ever in England before, aud her an­  
swering &quot;Yes,&quot; inquired of me bow long ago, and  
supposed it was when she was verv viiuinr. All  
this was said with much affability, and the ease  
aud freedom of old acquaintance. The muiiuer  
iu nhich they make their tour round the room  
is, first, tho Queen, tho Lady iu Waitiug behind  
her, holding up her train ; uext to her the Prin­  
cess Koyal ; after her the Princess Augusta, aud  
their Lady in Waiting behind thpiu. They are  
pretty, rather thau beautiful; well-shaped, with  
fair complexions, and a tincture of the King&#x27;s  
countenance. Tho two sisters looked much alike ;  
they were both dressed iu black and silver silk,  
and a silver netting upou the coat, aud their  
heads fall of diamond pins. The Queen was in  
purple aud silver. She is not well shaped nor  
handsome. As to the ladies of the court, rauk  
and title may compensate for waut of personal  
charms ; bnt tbey are, iu general, ve&#x27;y plain, ill­  
shaped, and ugly ; bnt don&#x27;t you toll anybody I  
said so.
