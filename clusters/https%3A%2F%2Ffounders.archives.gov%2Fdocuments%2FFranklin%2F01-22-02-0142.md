The Price to be fixed by the Assembly or Convention or Committee of Safety of each Colony. And to import all that can be procured.  
Also that the good Arms of all such Soldiers as leave the Service be retained on a Valuation made of them.  
  
  
Friday October 20. 1775.  
The Committee met present as before.  
It was now proposed to the Consideration of the Members what will be the best Method of providing Cloathing for the Troops which are to compose the new Army.  
Agreed that the Cloathing be provided by the Continent and paid for by Stoppages out of the Soldiers Wages at 10s. per Month, that as much as possible of the Cloth for this Purpose be dyed brown and the Distinctions of Regiments made in the Facings.  
Also that a Man who brings a good new Blanket into the Camp should be allowed two Dollars therefor and take it away with him at the End of the Campaign.  
2d. What is the best Method of getting Provisions for the Army?  
Agreed that the best Method of procuring Salt Provisions will be to drive the Cattle and Hogs at proper Seasons to the Camp there to be cured and that the New England Colonies can fully supply the Army with these Articles.  
That in the Article of Flour and Bread the Commissary proceed in the Way he has done for some Time past, that appearing to be both safe and frugal.  
3d. By whom the Officers should be chosen and recommended and how the best Officers and Men in the present Army may be engaged for the next making a complete Arrangement of the whole?  
Agreed that such Officers as have served in the present Army to Approbation and are willing to stay be preferred; if there are more of these than are necessary for the new Army the General to distinguish such as he deems best qualified.  
Agreed upon a Representation from the General that the Committee recommend to the Continental Congress that proper Authority may be given him to impress Carriages Vessels, Horses and other Things necessary for the Transportation or March of the Army, or any Part of it, or on any other Emergency, and that this Power may be deputed in Writing under the Hand of the General to the Quarter Master Gen. or to any Inferiour Officers, who are to be accountable for any Abuse thereof.  
  
  
October 21. 1775  
The Members of the Conference met, present as before, except General Sullivan.  
It appearing on a full Discussion and Consideration of all Circumstances that any Attempt to reduce the present Pay would probably prevent the Soldiers reinlisting and that the Advancement of the Season does not admit of any Delay in forming a new Army, Agreed that it be proposed to the Officers now serving in the present Army that they signify in Writing as soon as possible which of them will continue to serve and defend their Country and which of them will retire. And that such Officers as propose to continue in the Service and are approved by the General proceed to inlist their Men into the Continental Service upon the same Pay and Allowance of Provisions as is now given. The Service to continue to the last Day of December 1776, subject to be discharged at any Time by the Continental Congress as has been heretofore practised in the like Cases.  
Agreed that if upon Tryal it should appear that the Number of 20,372 Men before resolved on cannot be raised out of the present Army: that then the Officers appointed for the new Army, recruit their several Regiments and Companies to their full Complement. And in Case the Necessity of the Service should require it, the General be impowered to call in the Minute Men or Militia from this or the neighbouring Colonies according to the Nature and Exigence of the Service.  
The Rules and Regulations of the Continental Army were then taken under Consideration and the following Alterations proposed.  
1. All Persons convicted of holding an unwarrantable Correspondence with or giving Intelligence to the Enemy shall suffer Death or such other Punishment as a Genl. Court Martial shall think proper.  
  
  
  
October 22. 1775.  
The Members of the Conference met.  
Present as yesterday.  
The Rules and Articles of the Continental Army were again considered. Agreed  
That it be recommended to the several Legislatures of the Colonies or Conventions to enact some Law or pass an Ordinance inflicting the following Punishment on Persons harbouring Deserters knowing them to be such, viz. A Fine upon all such Offenders not less than 30 or more than 50 Dollars. And in Case of Inability to pay the Fine to be punished with Whipping not exceeding 39 Lashes for each Offence.  
That any Person who shall apprehend a Deserter and bring him to the Regiment to which he belongs upon a Certificate thereof by the Colonel or commanding Officer of such Regiment be intitled to receive 5 Dollars from the Continental Paymaster General which is to be deducted out of the Pay of such Soldier.  
2d. That all commissioned Officers found guilty by a General Court Martial of any Fraud or Embezzlement shall forfeit all his Pay be ipso facto cashiered and deemed unfit for farther Service as an Officer.  
3. That all non commissioned Officers or Soldiers convicted before a Regimental Court Martial of stealing embezzling or destroying Ammunition, Provisions, Tools or any Thing belonging to the publick Stores (if a non commissioned Officer) to be reduced to the Ranks and punished with whipping not less than 15 nor more than 39 Lashes, at the Discretion of the Court Martial, if a private Soldier with the same corporal Punishment.  
That it be recommended to the several Legislatures of the Colonies to impower the Commander in Chief or the Officer commanding a Detachment or out Post to administer an Oath and swear any Person or Persons to the Truth of any Information or Intelligence or any other Matter relative to the publick Service.  
That in the Punishment of cashiering an Officer for Cowardice or Fraud it be added that the Crime, Name, Place of Abode and Punishment of the Dilinquent be published in the News Papers in and about the Camp and of the Colony from which the Offender came and where he usually resides after which it shall be deemed scandalous for any Officer to associate with him.  
That the 3d. Article of the Rules &amp;c. be amended by making the Punishment refer to the 2d. instead of the 1st. Article.  
That the 5th. Article be amended by making the Offence punishable with Death or otherwise at the Discretion of a General Court Martial.  
That the 8th. Article be amended to make Deserters to the Enemy who may afterwards fall into our Hands punishable with Death or otherwise at the Discretio
