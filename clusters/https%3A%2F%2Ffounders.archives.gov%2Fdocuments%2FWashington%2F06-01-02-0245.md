Dear Sir,  
Mount Vernon 4th Augt 1797.  
  
Your letter of the 24th Ulto has been received, and I am sorry to hear of the loss of your Servant; but it is my opinion these elopements will be much more, before they are less frequent; and that the persons making them should never be retained, if they are recovered, as they are sure to contaminate and discontent others. I wish from my Soul that the Legislature of this State could see the policy of a gradual abolition of Slavery; It might prevt much future mischief.  
Whenever it is convenient to you to make this place your home, I shall be glad to see you at it for that purpose; and that there may be no misunderstanding in the matter, I shall inform you before hand, that you, servant (if you bring one) and horses, will fare in all respects as We, &amp; mine do; but that I shall expect no Services from you for which pecuniary compensation will be made. I have already as many on wages as are sufficient to carry on my business, and more indeed than I can find means to pay, conveniently. As both your Aunt and I are in the decline of life, and regular in our habits, especially in our hour of rising &amp; going to bed, I require some person (fit &amp; Proper) to ease me of the trouble of entertaining company; particularly of Nights, as it is my inclination to retire (and unless prevented by very particular company, always do retire) either to bed, or to my study, soon after candle light. In taking these duties (which hospitality obliges one to bestow on company) off my hands, it would render me a very acceptable Service. And for a little time only, to come, an hour in the day, now and then, devoted to the recording of some Papers which time would not allow me to complete before I left Philadelphia, would also be acceptable. Besides these, I know nothing at present, that would require any portion of your time, or attention: both of which, if you have inclination for it, might be devoted to Reading, as I have a great many instructive Books, on many subjects, as well as amusing ones; or, they might be employed in sporting, there being much ⟨ga⟩me of all sorts here; or in riding, &amp; viewing the management of my farms, from whence something useful may ⟨be⟩ drawn, as I think Mr Anderson in many things could give you useful lessons and a better insight into husbandry than your opportunities have, Hitherto, presented to you.  
  
I do not mean however, that any of these things should restrain you from attending to your own affairs, or restrain you from visiting your friends at pleasure; all I have in view by making this communication is to guard against misconception on either side. Your Aunt unites with me in best regards for you, and I am your sincere friend and Affectionate Uncle  
  
Go: Washington

Mount Verst-ow, 4 Aug., 1797.—Dear

of the loss of your servant, but it is my  
opinion these elopements will be much  
more before they are less frequent;

venient to you to maice this place your  
home 1 shall be glad to see you at it for  
that purpose, and that there may be no  
misunderstanding in the matter, 1 shall  
inform you beforehand that you, serv­  
ant (.if you bring one), and horses will  
fare all respects as we and mine do;  
but that I shall expect no services from  
you for which pecuniary compensation  
will be made. 1 have already as many&#x27;  
on wages as are sufficient to carry oh  
my business, and more, indeed, than I  
can find means to pay, conveniently.  
As both your aunt and 1 are in the de­  
cline of life and regular in our habits,  
especially in our hour of rising and  
going to bed, I require some person (fit  
and proper) to ease me of the trouble

also be acceptable, .Besides these, I  
know nothing at present that would re­  
quire any portion of your time or atten­  
tion, both of which, if you have inclina­  
tion for it, might be devoted to read­  
ing, as I have a great many instructive  
books on many subjects, as well  
as amusing ones; or they  
might.; be employed in sporting,  
there being much game of all sorts here;  
or in riding and viewing the manage­

Mr. Anderson, in many things, could  
give you useful lessons and a better.in­  
sight into husbandry than your oppor­  
tunities have hitherto presented to you.

&quot;Mount Vernon, 4 Aug., 1797.  
D-abSir: Your letter of the 24th  
nit. has been received, and I am sorry  
  
to hear of the loss of your servant, bnt  
it is my opinion these elopements will  
be much more beiore tney are less fre­  
quent; and that the persons making  
them should never be retained, if they  
are recovered, as they are sure to con  
taminate and discontent others. I  
wish from my soul that the Legislature  
of this State could see the policy of a  
gradual abolition of slavery. It might  
prevent much future mischief. When  
ever it is convenient to you to make  
this place your home I shall be glad to  
see you at it for that purpose; and that  
there may not be no misunderstanding  
in the matter, I shall inform you be  
forehand that you. servant (if you  
bring one), and horses will fare in all  
respects as we and mine do; but that  
I snail expect no services from you  
zor wmcn pecuniary oompensuuuu wux  
be mode.&#x27; I have already as many on  
wages as are sufficient to carry on my  
business, and more, indeed, than x can  
find means to pay, conveniently. As  
both your aunt and I are in the decline  
of life and regular in our habits, espe­  
cially in our hour of rising and going to  
bed, I require some person (fit and  
proper) to ease me of the trouble of  
entertaining company, particularly ox  
nights, as it is my inclination to retire  
(and unless prevented by particular  
company always do retire) either to  
my bed or to my study, soon after  
candlelight. In taking these duties  
(which hospitality obliges one to be  
stow on company) off my hands it  
wouia render me an accepiauie service,  
and. for a little time only to come, an  
hour in the day, now and then, devoted  
to the recording of some papers wmcn  
time would not allow me to complete  
before I left Philadelphia, would also  
be acceptable. Besides these, I know  
nothing at present tnat would re  
quire any portion of your time or atten  
tion, both of which, 11 you have incli  
nation for it, might be devoted to read­  
ing, as I have a great many instructive  
books on many subjects, as well as  
amusing ones ; or tney mignt ue r De­  
ployed in sporting, there being much  
crame of all sorts here ; or in riding and  
viewing the management of my farms,  
from whence something useful may be  
drawn, as I think Mr. Anderson in  
many things could give you useful les­  
sons&quot; and a better insight into hus­  
bandry than your opportunities have  
hitherto presented to you. 1 do not  
mean, however, that any of these things  
should restrain you from attending to  
your own affairs, or restrain you from  
visiting your friends at pleasure. All I  
have in view by making this communi  
cation is to guard against misconcep­  
tion on either side. Your aunt unites  
with me in best regards for you, and I  
am your sincere friend and affectionate  
uncle, O. Washington.
