wever, Franklin wrote simply: “One of the happiest Countries at this Time in the World. God grant it may long so continue.” To promote the teaching of penmanship Franklin, like William Mather, included four plates of examples of good handwriting, as well as a description of the Twelve Ciphers which his late friend Joseph Breintnall had designed. And finally he offered this advice to young tradesmen.  
  
[July 21, 1748]  
Advice to a young Tradesman, written by an old One.   
To my Friend A. B.  
As you have desired it of me, I write the following Hints, which have been of Service to me, and may, if observed, be so to you.  
Remember that Time is Money. He that can earn Ten Shillings a Day by his Labour, and goes abroad, or sits idle one half of that Day, tho’ he spends but Sixpence during his Diversion or Idleness, ought not to reckon That the only Expence; he has really spent or rather thrown away Five Shillings besides.  
Remember that Credit is Money. If a Man lets his Money lie in my Hands after it is due, he gives me the Interest, or so much as I can make of it during that Time. This amounts to a considerable Sum where a Man has good and large Credit, and makes good Use of it.  
Remember that Money is of a prolific generating Nature. Money can beget Money, and its Offspring can beget more, and so on. Five Shillings turn’d, is Six: Turn’d again, ’tis Seven and Three Pence; and so on ’til it becomes an Hundred Pound. The more there is of it, the more it produces every Turning, so that the Profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding Sow, destroys all her Offspring to the thousandth Generation. He that murders a Crown, destroys all it might have produc’d, even Scores of Pounds.  
Remember that Six Pounds a Year is but a Groat a Day. For this little Sum (which may be daily wasted either in Time or Expence unperceiv’d) a Man of Credit may on his own Security have the constant Possession and Use of an Hundred Pounds. So much in Stock briskly turn’d by an industrious Man, produces great Advantage.  
Remember this Saying, That the good Paymaster is Lord of another Man’s Purse. He that is known to pay punctually and exactly to the Time he promises, may at any Time, and on any Occasion, raise all the Money his Friends can spare. This is sometimes of great Use: Therefore never keep borrow’d Money an Hour beyond the Time you promis’d, lest a Disappointment shuts up your Friends Purse forever.  
The most trifling Actions that affect a Man’s Credit, are to be regarded. The Sound of your Hammer at Five in the Morning or Nine at Night, heard by a Creditor, makes him easy Six Months longer. But if he sees you at a Billiard Table, or hears your Voice in a Tavern, when you should be at Work, he sends for his Money the next Day. Finer Cloaths than he or his Wife wears, or greater Expence in any particular than he affords himself, shocks his Pride, and he duns you to humble you. Creditors are a kind of People, that have the sharpest Eyes and Ears, as well as the best Memories of any in the World.  
Good-natur’d Creditors (and such one would always chuse to deal with if one could) feel Pain when they are oblig’d to ask for Money. Spare ’em that Pain, and they will love you. When you receive a Sum of Money, divide it among ’em in Proportion to your Debts. Don’t be asham’d of paying a small Sum because you owe a greater. Money, more or less, is always welcome; and your Creditor had rather be at the Trouble of receiving Ten Pounds voluntarily brought him, tho’ at ten different Times or Payments, than be oblig’d to go ten Times to demand it before he can receive it in a Lump. It shews, besides, that you are mindful of what you owe; it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest Man; and that still encreases your Credit.  
Beware of thinking all your own that you possess, and of living accordingly. ’Tis a Mistake that many People who have Credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact Account for some Time of both your Expences and your Incomes. If you take the Pains at first to mention Particulars, it will have this good Effect; you will discover how wonderfully small trifling Expences mount up to large Sums, and will discern what might have been, and may for the future be saved, without occasioning any great Inconvenience.  
In short, the Way to Wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as the Way to Market. It depends chiefly on two Words, Industry and Frugality; i.e. Waste neither Time nor Money, but make the best Use of both. He that gets all he can honestly, and saves all he gets (necessary Expences excepted) will certainly become Rich; If that Being who governs the World, to whom all should look for a Blessing on their honest Endeavours, doth not in his wise Providence otherwise determine

Advice to a Young Tradz/man from  
an Old one.  
[Suppofed to bewritten by Dogtor  
FRANKLIN. ]  
  
To my Friend A. B.  
  
As you bave defired of me, I write  
the following bints, which have  
been of fervice to me, and may,  
if obfervid, be fo to you.  
  
EMEMBER that Time is  
  
Money. He that can earn  
ten fhillings a day by his Labour,  
and goes abroad, or fits idle one  
half of that day, tho he fpends but  
fix-pence during his diverfion or  
idlenefs, ought not to reckon that  
the®only expence; he has really  
  
fpent, or rather thrown away, five  
fillings befides,  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Rervember that Cr&amp;vrt is mo.  
ney. Jf a man lets money lie in  
my hands after it is due, he gives  
me the interett, or fo much as I cag  
make of it during that time. This  
amgunts to a Co afideral le fum, if  
a man has ood end large credit,  
and makes good ufe of it.  
  
Reinemsher that money is of a  
prolific, generating nature. Mo.  
ney can beget money, and its off-  
{pring can beget more and fo on;  
five thillings turned is fix : tuined  
again ’tis fe ven and three pence,  
and fo on till it becomes an hund-  
redpodud. The more there is of  
it, the more it produces every tur-  
ning; fo that the profits rile quick-  
  
rand quicker. He that kills a  
breeding fow, deftroys ail her off-  
ipring to the thoufandth generati-  
on. Hethat murders a crown de-  
ftroys all it might have produced,  
even {cores of pounds.  
  
Remember that Six Pounds a  
year is but a groat a day. Forthis  
little fu ny which may daily be wa-  
{ted in time or expence unperceiv-  
ed, a man of credit may, on his  
own fecurity, have the conftant ufe  
and poffeffion of a huadred pounds.  
So much in flock brifkly turned by  
an induftrious man, produces great  
advantage.  
  
Remember this faying, That the  
good Paymafier is Lord of another  
Man’s Purfe. Wethat is known to  
pay punctually and exaétly to the  
time he promifes, may at any time  
and on any occafion raife all the  
money his friends can fpare. This  
isfonaetimes of great ufe; there-  
fore never keep ‘borrowed money  
an hour beyond the time you pro-  
mifed, left a difappointment fhut  
up your friend’s purfe forever.  
  
The moft trifling actions that af-  
feet a man’s credit are to be regar-  
ded. The found of your hammer  
at five in the morning, or nine at  
night, heard by a creditor, makes  
him ea! fy Gx months longer. But  
if he fees you ata billiard table, or

hears your voice at a tavern, when  
you fhould be at work, he fends: for  
his money the next day. Finer  
cloaths than he or his wife wears,  
or greater expenfe tn any particular  
than he affords himfelf, fhocks his  
pride, and he duns you to humble  
you. Creditors are a kind of peo-  
ple that have the fharpeft eyes and  
ears, as well as the beft memories  
of any.in the world.  
  
Good-natur’d creditors,—(and  
fuch one would always chufe to  
deal with if one could) feel pain  
when they are oblig’d to afk for  
money. Spare them that pain and  
they will love you. When you re-  
ceive a fum of money, divide it  
among them in proportion to your  
debts. Don’t be alhaim’d of paying  
a {mall fem becaufe you owe a  
greater. Money, more or Iefs, 1s  
always welcome, and your creditor  
had rather be at the croubie of re-  
ceiving Ten Pounds, voluntarily  
brought him, though atten dilfer-  
ent times or payments, than be  
obliged to go ten different times  
to demand it before he can receive  
ii in alump. Ic fhews that you are  
mindful of what you owe, it makes  
you appear a careful as well as an  
honeft man, and that ftill increafes  
your credit.  
  
Beware of thinkine all. your  
own that you poflefs, and of living  
accordingly. &quot;Tis a miftake that  
many people who have credit fail  
into. Lo.preventthis, keep an ex-  
at account for fome time of both  
your expences and incomes. If you  
take the pains at firft to mention  
particulars, it will have this good  
effect; you will difcover how won-  
derfully fimall wifitng expences  
mount up to large fums, and will  
diicern what might have been, and  
may, for the future, be faved,  
without occafioning any great in-  
convenience.

To my Friend A. B,  
REMEMBER that TIME is money, He  
that can earn i{cn shillings a 2 day by his la­  
bour, and goes abroad, or fits idle, one half of  
that day, tho’ be spends but {ix pence during his  
diversion or idienefs, ought not to reckon that  
the only expence ; he has rea. spent, or rather  
thrown away, 5 shillings besides, - “  
Remember that CREDIT is money. Ifamanp  
lets money lie in my hands after it is due, he­  
gives me the interefl, or fomuch as I can make of  
it duriag that time. Thisamounts to a consider­  
able sum, if 2 man has good and large credit, and  
makes good use of il, :  
Remember that money is of a prolifick, gene­  
rating nature. Money, can beget money, and  
its oft{pring can beget moreand so on ; five fhii­  
lings turned is fix : turned again it is seven and  
three pence, and so on until it becomes an hun­  
dred pound. The more there §of it the more  
it produces every turning ; so thal the profits rife  
quicker and quicker, He that kills a breeding  
sow, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth  
generation. He that murders a crown defiroys  
all it might bave produced, even scares of pounds.  
Remember that Six Pounds a year is but a  
groat a day. For ‘this little sum, which may  
daily be wafted in time or expense unperceived,  
a man of credit may, on his own security, have  
the constant use and poffeflion of an bundred­  
pounds. So much in stock briskly tumed by an  
indaftrious man, produces great advantage.  
Remember this faying, 7hat the good paymaficr  
is lord of another man’s purje, He that is known to  
pay punétually and exaétly to the time he pro­  
mises, may at any time and on any occasion raise  
all the money his friends can spare. This is.  
sometimes of great use ; therefore never keep  
borrowed money an hour beyond the time you  
promiied, least a disappointment shut up your  
triend’s pucfe forever.  
The mott trifling aclions that effet 2 man’s  
credit are to be regardcd. The found of ycur  
hammer at five in tie moarning, or nine at night,  
heard by a creditor, makes him easy fix months  
longer. But if he fees jouat a billiard table, or  
hears your voice at a tavern, when you should be  
at work, he fends for his money the next day.  
Finer cloaths than he o 1 his wife wears, or greai­  
er expense in any particular than he aftords bim­  
felf, thocks his pride and he duns you to humble  
you. Creditors are a 2 kind of people that have  
the tharpeft eyes and ears, as well as the best  
memories of any in the world.  
.Good-patured creditors,—(and such one would  
always chufe to deal with if one could) feel pain  
when they are obliged to ask for money. Spare  
them that pain and they will love you, When  
you receive 2 sum of money, divide it among  
them in proportion to your debts. Do not be  
atham’d cf paying a small sum because you owe  
a greater. DMoney, more or less, is always wel­  
come, and your creditor had rather be at the  
trouble of recciving Tem Peunds, voluntarily  
bvought him, though at ten different times cr pay­  
ments, than be obliged to go ten different times  
to demand it before he can receive it in a lump.  
It thews that you are mindful of what you owe,  
it makes youappear a careful as well as on honest  
man, and that fill increases your credit.  
Beware of thinking all your own that you pos­  
sess, and of living accordingly. It is a maftake that  
many people who have credit fall into. To pre­  
vent this, keep an axaét account for some time  
of both your expenses and income. If you take  
the pains at firft to mention particulars, it will  
have this good effeét ; you will discover how  
wonderfully small trifling expenses amount up to  
‘large sums, and will discern what might- have  
been, and*may, for the future, be saved, without  
occasioning any great inconvenience. ’  
In short, the way to wealth if you desire “—-: is  
as plain as the way to market.—llt dcgcnds chxc.f­  
ly on two words, Industry and Frugality ; that is,  
waste neither your time nor money, but make the  
best of both, ~He that gets all he can, and saves

tainly become rich: If that being who governs

S you have defired of me, I write the followieg hints, which  
have been of fervice to me, and may, if obferved, be fo  
to you.

day by his labour, and goes abroad, or fits idle one haif of that  
day, though he fpends but 6d. during his diverfion or idlenefs,

I can make of it during that time. ‘Ihis amounts to a confi-  
derable fum, if a man has good and large credit, and makes  
good ufe of it.  
  
Remember that money is of a prolific, generating nature.  
Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and  
fo-on.; 5s. turned is 6s. turned again is 7s. 34. and fo on till it

it might have produced, even {cores of pounds.

410 THE WEEKLY ENTERTAINER,  
  
Remember that 6]. a year is but a groat aday. For this lit.  
tle fum, which may daily be waited in time or expence, unper-  
ceived, a man of credit may, on his own fecurity, have the con-  
itant ufe and poffeffion of 1ool, So much in ftock, britkly  
turned by an induftrious man, produces great advantages.  
  
Remember this faying, ‘* That the good paymatter is lord of  
another man’s purfe.”” He that is known to pay punctually and  
exactly to the time he promifes, may at any time, and on any  
occafion, raife any money his friends can fpare. ‘This is fome-  
times of great ufe ; therefore never keep money an hour beyond  
the time yoa promifed, left a difappointment fhut up your  
friend’s purfe for ever.  
  
The mott trifling a@ions that affect a man’s credit are to be  
regarded, The found of your hammer at five in the morning,  
or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him eafy fix months  
longer. But if he fees you at a billiard table, or hears your  
voice at a tavern, when you fhould be at work, he fends for his  
money the next day. Finer clothes than he or his wife wears,  
or a greater expence in any particular than he affords himéelf,  
fhocks his pride, and he duns youtohumble you. Creditors are  
a kind of people that have the fharpeit eyes and ears, as wellas  
the beft memories of any in the world.  
  
Good-natured creditors (and fuch one would always chufe to  
deal with if one could) feel pain when they are obliged to afk  
for money. Spare them that pain, and they will love you.  
When you receive a fum of money, divide it among them in  
proportion to your debts. Do not be afhamed of paying a

nage a hudable pride. &#x27;  
  
Hints hyDrt%k*x\.\n,  
  
&quot;P Emkmber that Time is Money.  
  
He that can earn ten (hillings a-  
&lt;^y by hii labour* ancLgocs abroad,  
or (its idle one half of that day, tho*  
l&gt;c fpends but fixpence during his  
diveiiSon or idlencla, ought not to  
reckon that the only expence; he  
h^ really fpent, or thrown away*  
fire (hillings befides.  
  
Remember that Credit is Money.  
If a man lets money lie in my hands  
after it is due, he gives pie the inte-  
reft, or fo much as 1 can make of  
it,during that time. This amounts  
to a coiifiderable fum, if a man has  
good and large credit* and makes  
good ufe of it.  
  
. Remember that money is of a  
prolific, generating nature. Money  
can beget moaey* and its ofispring  
can beget more, and fo on; fire  
(hillings turned is fix; turned again  
it it &amp;ven and threepence* and fo on  
tftl it becomes tn hundred pounds.  
The more there is of it* the more it  
produces every turning; fo that the  
profits rife quicker and quicker. He  
that kills a breeding fow* ^ftroys all  
her offspring to the thoolandth ge¬  
neration. He that murders a crosm*  
defftoyt ^ it might hare produced*  
even fcores of pounds.  
  
; Remember that fix pounds a^year  
are but a groat a-day. For this  
  
little fum, which may daily be srafted  
in time or expence, unperceired* a  
man of credit may, on his own  
fecurity, hare the conftant ufe and  
poffcflioo of a hundred pounds. So  
much in (lock, bfi(kly turned by an  
induftrious mao, produces great ad¬  
vantage.  
  
Remember this faying* * That  
the good pay*mailer it Lord of ano¬  
ther man’s purfe.’^ He that is  
known to pay pundually and ex-  
aAly to the time he promifes, may  
at any time and on any occa(ioa  
raife all the money his friends can  
fpare. This is fometimes of great  
ufe; therefore never keep borrow¬  
ed money an hour beyood the tiipf  
yon promifed* left a&#x27;difappointnmt

The moft trifling a&amp;Ions that af-  
fed a man’s credit are to be regard¬  
ed. The found of your hammer at  
fire in the morning, or nine at  
night, heard by a creditor* makes  
him cafy fix moQths longer. But if  
he fees you at a btlliatd table, or  
bears your vmce at a tavern, when  
you (huuld be at work* be fends for  
bla money the next day. Finer

thM have the fliarpeft eyes and ears,.  
^wcU as the bcit memories of any  
ib the world.  
  
Good-natured cseditori (and fuch  
one would always choofc to deal  
with if one cwuld) feel pain when  
they are obliged to alk fur money.  
Spare them that^ pain and they Will  
love you. When you receive a fum of  
money, divide ,it among them in  
proportion to your debts. Don^t  
be afham’d of paying a fmall fum be-  
Caufe you owe a greater. Money,  
more or Icfs, is always welcome ; and  
your creditor would rather be at the  
trouble of receiving ten pounds, to-  
llinurily brought him, though at.  
ten different times or payments, than  
be obliged to go ten different times  
to demand it ^fore he can receive  
it in a lump. It fhows that you are  
mindful of what you owe; it makes  
you appear a careful as well as an  
honeft man ; and that ftill increafes  
your credit.  
  
Beware of thinking all your own  
that you poffefs, and of living xc*  
  
cotdingly. It ’is.&#x27; a , miiUke, that,  
many people who have credit fall in¬  
to., To prevent this, keep an exact  
account for fome time of both your  
expences and incomes. If you take  
the pains at firll to mention particu-.  
lars, it will have this good effc(ft,  
you will , difeover how wonderfully,  
fmall trifling expences moiiut up to  
large Turns; and will dtfeern what,  
might have been, and may fur the  
future; be fated, withput occafioa-/  
ing any great inconvenience.  
  
In Ihort, the way to wealth, if yoil  
defire it, is as plain as the way to  
market.—It depends chiefly on two  
words, Induftry and Frugality ; i. e;  
wade neither time nor money, but.

&#x27; As you defired of me, I write you the following hints,  
which have been of fervice to me, and may, if obferved, be  
fo to you.  
  
Remember that time is money. He that can earn ten  
fhillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or fits idle  
one half of that day, though he fpends but fixpence during  
his diverfion or. idlenefs, it ought not to be reckoned the  
only expence ; he hath really fpent or thrown away five  
fhillings befides. -  
  
Remember that credit is money. If a man lets money  
lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the intereft, or  
as much a$ I can make of it during that time. This a-  
mounts to a confiderable fum, if he has good and large  
credit, and makes good ufe of it.  
  
Remember that money is of a prolific and generating na-  
ture. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget  
more, and fo on. Five fhillings turned, is fix fhillings;  
turned again, is 7s. 3 d., and fo on till it becomes 1001;  
the more there is of it, the more it produces every turning,  
fo that the profits rife quicker and quicker.. He that kills  
ra breeding fow, deftroys all her offspring to the thoufandth  
generation. He that murders a crown, deftroys all it might  
have produced, even fcores of pounds.  
  
Remember that fix pounds a year, are but four-pence per  
day. For this little fum, which may be daily watted in our  
expence unperceived, a man of credit may on his own fe  
curity have the conftant ufe and poffeflion of 1001. So  
much in ftock brifkly turned by an induftrious man, pr  
  
‘duc&amp; great advantage.  
  
Remember this faying, “ That the good paymatfter is  
matter of another man’s purfe.” He that is known to pay  
well, that is punctually and exaétly to the time he promiles,  
may at any time, and on any occafion, raife all the money  
that his friend-can fpare. ‘This is fometimes of great ul,

The moft trifling, ations that affe&amp;t a man’s credit ought |

Good natured creditors (and

of paying a [mall fam becaufe you  
Owe a greaier,. Money, more or  
leis, is always welcome ; and  
your creditor would rather be at  
the trouble of receiving ten  
pounds, voluntarily brought him,  
though at ten different times or  
payments, than be obliged to go  
ten different timesto demand it  
before he can receive it ina lump.  
It fhows that you are mindful of

Beware of thinking al¥ yourown  
that you pollefs, and of living ac-  
cordingly. It is a muittake that  
many people who have credit fail  
into. To prevent this, keep an  
exact account for fome time of  
both your expenies and incomes.  
jit you take the pains at frit to

— Remember that credit is money. If a man lets

fhillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or fits  
idle one half of that day, though he {pends but fixpence du-  
ring his diverfion or idlenefs, ought not to reckon that the

Remember that credit is money. If aman lets his money  
lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the intereft, or  
fo much asI can make of it during that time. This a-  
Mounts to a confiderable fum where a man has good and  
large credit, and makes good ufe of it.  
  
Remember that money is of a prolific generating nature.  
Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more,  
and foon. Five fhillings turned is fix ; turned again, it is

dred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produ-  
ces every turning, fo that the profits rife quicker and quick-  
er. He that kills a breeding fow, deftroys all her offspring  
to the thoufandth generation. He that murders a crown,  
deftroys all that it might have produced, even fcores of  
pounds.  
  
Remember that fix pounds a-year is but a groat a-day.  
For this little fum (which may be daily wafted either in time  
or expence, unperceived), a man of credit may, on his  
own {ecurity, have the conftant pofleffion and ufe of an  
hundred pounds. So much in ftock, brifkly turned by an  
induftrious man, produces great advantages.  
  
Remember this faying, ** The good paymatter is lord of  
another man’s purfe.” He that is known to pay punctually  
and exactly to the time he promifes, may at any time, and  
on any occafion, raife all the moncy his friends can f{pare,  
This is fometimes of great ufe. After induftry and frugali-  
ty, nothing contributes more to the raifing of a young man  
in the world, than pundtuality and juftice in all his dealings ;  
therefore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the  
time you promifed, left a difappointment fhut up your  
friend’s purfe forever.  
  
The moft trifling ations that affe&amp; a man’s credit are to  
beregarded. The found of your hammer at five in the  
Morning, or nine at night, heard by acreditor, makes him  
eafy fix months longer : but if he fees you ata billiard table,  
or hears your voice ata tavern, when you fhould be at work,  
he fends for his money the next day ; demands it before  
he can receive it in a lump.  
  
It fhews, befides, that you are mindful of what you owe;  
it makes you appear careful, as well as an honeft man, and  
that {till increafes your credit.  
  
Beware of thinking all your own that you poflefs, and  
of living accordingly. It isa miftake that many people whe  
have credit fallinto. ‘To prevent this, keep an exact ac-  
count, for fome time, both of your expences and your in-

sits idle one half ot that day, though he spends but  
sixpence during his diversion or idieness, ought not to

recko: that the only expense ; he has really spent. to afford many mil privil ges. It was a project  
  
or rather thrown away, five shillings besides.

ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN,  
Written anno 1748.  
TO MY FRIEND, A. B.  
As you have desired it of me, I write the following hin  
bao been of service to me, and may, if rote 4 be a aan  
  
REMEMBER that time is money. He that can earn ten  
shilli er by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle one  
half of that jay, though he spends but sixpence during his  
diversion or idlensss, ought not to reckon that the only ew  
  
; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shih  
besides.  
emember that credit is money. If a man lets his  
lie in my hands afier it is due, he gives me the interest, or so  
much as I can make of it during that time. This amounts  
to a considerable sum where a man has good and large cre.  
dit, and makes good use of it.  
  
Remember that money is of a prolific generating nature,  
Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more,  
and soon. Five shillings turned is six; turned again itis  
seven and threepence: and so on till it becomes oteshis  
pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every  
turning, 8o that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that  
kills a breeding sow, destroys all her offspring to the thou.  
sandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all  
that it might have produced, even scores of pounds,  
  
Remember that six pounds a year is but a groat a day,  
For this little sum (which may be daily wasted either in time  
or expense, unperceived) @ man of credit may, on his own  
security, have the constant possession and use of a hundred  
pounds. So much in stock, briskly turned by an industrious  
man, prod reat advant  
  
Remember this saying: ‘The a paymaster is lord of  
another man’s purse. He that is known to pay punct  
and exactly to the time he promises, rom at any time,  
on any occasion, raise all the money his friends can spare,  
This is sometimes of great use. After industry and frugal  
ty, nothing contributes more to the raising of a young man ia  
the world, than punctuality and justice in all his ae  
therefore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond  
time you promised, lest a disappointment shut up your friend&#x27;s  
purse for ever. .  
  
The most trifling actions that affect a man’s credit are to  
be regarded. The sound of your hammer at five in the mom-  
ing, or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him easy six  
months longer ; but if he sees you at a billiard table, or hears  
  
‘our voice at a tavern, when you should be at work, he sends  
for his money the next day ; demands it before he can receive  
it in a lump.  
  
It shows, besides, that you are mindful of what you owe:  
it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest man, and  
that still increases your credit.  
  
Beware of — all your own that you possess, and of  
living accordingly. {t is a mistake that many people who  
have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact account,  
for some time, both of your expenses and your income, If  
you take the pains at first 10 mention particulars, it will have  
this good effect; you will discover how wonderfully small tri-  
fling expenses mount up to large sums, and will discern what  
might have been, and may forthe future be saved, without  
occasioning any great inconvenience. ;  
  
In short, the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain as  
the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, indus  
try and frugality ; that is, waste neither time nor money, but  
make the best use of both. Without industry and frugality  
nothing will do, and with them every thing. He that gets  
he can honestly, and saves all he gets pyro expenses  
excepted), will certainly become rich—if that Being, who  
governs the world, to whom all should look for a a  
their honest endeavors, doth not in his wise providence

ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN.  
  
Remember that time is money. He who can earn  
ten shillings a day by his labour, and goes abroad, or  
sits idle one half of that day, though he spend but six-  
pence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to  
reckon that the only expense ; he has really spent or  
rather thrown away, five shillings besides.  
  
Remember that credit is money. If a man lets his  
money lie in. my hands after it is due, he gives me the  
interest, or so much as I can make of it during that  
time. This amounts to a considerable sum where a  
- has good and large credit, and makes good use  
of it.  
  
Remember that money is of a prolific, generating  
nature. Money can beget money, and its offspring

six; turned again, it is seven and three pence ; and so  
on till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there  
is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that  
the profits rise quicker and quicker.  
  
Remember that six pounds a year is but a groata  
day. For this little sum (which may be daily wasted  
either in time or expense, unpreceived) a man of cre.  
dit may, on his own security, have the constant pos.  
session and use of a hundred pounds. So much in  
stock, briskly turned by an industrious man, produces  
great advantage.  
  
Remember this saying, “The good paymaster is  
lord of another man’s purse.” He who is known to  
pay punctually and cxacily at the time he promises,  
may at any time and on any occasion, raise all the  
money his friends can spare. This is sometimes of  
great use.

After industry and frugality, nothing contributes  
more to the raising of a young man in the world, than  
punctuality and justice in all his dealings; therefore  
never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time  
you promised, lest a disappointment shut up your  
friend’s purse forever.  
  
The most trifling actions which affect a man’s cre.  
dit are to be regarded. The sound of your hammer  
at five in the morning, or nine at night, heard bya  
creditor, makes him easy six months longer.  
  
But if he sees you at a billiard table, or hears your  
voice at a tavern, when you should be at work, he  
sends for his money the next day ; demands it before  
he can reccive it in a lump.  
  
It shows, besides, that you are mindful of what you  
owe; it makes you appear a careful, as well as an  
honest man, and that still increases your credit.  
  
Beware of thinking all your own that you possess,  
and of living accordingly. It is a mistake that many  
people who have credit fall into. To prevent this,  
keep an exact account, for some time, both of your  
expenses and your income.  
  
If you take the pains at first to mention particulars,  
it will have this good effect ; you will discover how  
wonderful small, trifling expenses mount up to large  
sums, and will discern what might have been, and  
may for the future be saved, without occasioning any  
great inconvenience.  
  
In short the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as  
plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on  
two words, industry and frugality ; that is, neither  
time nor money, but make the best use of both. With  
out industry and frugality, nothing will do, and with  
them, every thing will do.  
  
He who gets all be can honestly, and saves all he  
gets (necessary expenses excepted) will certainly be-  
come rich; if that Being, who governs the world to  
whom all should look for a blessing on their honest  
endeavours, doth not, in his wise providence, other-  
wise determine

Remember that time is money. He who can earn ten  
shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle  
one half of that day, though he spent but six-pence during  
his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon that the only  
expense ; he has really spent or rather thrown away, five  
shillings besides.  
  
2. Remember that credit is money. If a man lets his  
money lie in my hands after it is due; he gives me the in-  
terest, or so much as I can make of it during that time.  
This amounts to a considerable sum where a man has good  
and large credit, and makes good use of it.  
  
3. Remember that money is of a prolific, generating

produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and

4. Remember that six pounds a year is but a groata day.  
For this little sum (which may be daily wasted either in  
time or expense, unperceived) a man of credit may, on his  
own seourity, have the constant possession and use of a  
hundred pounds. So much in stock, briskly turned by an  
industrious man, produces great advantage.  
  
5. Remember this saying, “The good paymaster is lord  
of another man’s purse.” He who is known to pay punc-

time and on any occasion, raise all the money his friends

6. After industry and frugality, nothing contributes  
more to the raising of a young man in the world, than  
punctuality and justice in all his dealings; therefore never  
keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you pro-  
mised, le:t a disappointment shut up your friend’s purse  
  
forever.  
7. The most trifling actions which affect a man’s credit |  
  
are to be regarded. The sound of your hammer at five in |  
  
the morning, or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes  
him vasy six months longer.  
  
8. But if he sees you at a billiard table, or hears your  
voice at a tavern, when you should be at work, he sends  
for his money the next day; demands it before he can re-  
ceive it in a lump.  
  
9. It shows, besides, that you are mindful of what you  
owe ; it makes you appear a careful, as well as an honest  
man, and that still increases your credit.  
  
10. Beware of thinking all your own that you possess, |  
and of living accordingly. It is a mistake that many peo-  
ple who have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an ex-  
act account, for some time, both of your expenses and your |  
income. |  
  
11. Ifyou take the pains at first to mention particulars, |  
it will have this good effect ; you will discover how wonder- |  
fully, small, trifling expenses mount up to large sums, and |  
will discern what might have been, and may for the future be |  
saved, without occasioning any great inconvenience.  
  
12, In short, the way to wealth, if you desire it, is as plain  
as tho way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, |  
industry and frugality ; that is, waste neither time nor mon- |  
ey, but make the best use of both. Without industry and  
frugality, nothing will do, and with them, every thing will  
do.  
  
13. ie, who gots all he can honestly, and saves all he gets |  
(necessary expenses excepted) will certainly become rich ; |  
if that Being, who governs the world, towhom all should look |  
for a blessing on their honest endeavors, doth not, in his wise |

On the same subiect, Dr. Frankiin says:  
Remember this—‘‘ the good paymaster is lord  
of another man’s purse;’’ he that is known  
to pay punctually, and exactly to the time he  
promises, may at any time and on any occa-  
sion raise all the money his friends can spare.  
This is sometimes of great use. After indus-  
try and frugality, nothing contributes more  
  
  
  
to the raising of a young man in the world  
than punctuality and justice in all his deal-  
ings; therefore never keep borrowed money  
an hour beyond the time you promised, lest a  
disappointment shut up your friend’s purse  
forever.  
  
Beware of thinking all your own that you  
possess, and living accordingly. It is a mis-  
take that many people who have credit fall  
into. To prevent this, keep an exact account,  
for some time, both of your expenses and your  
income. If you take the pains at first to  
mention particulars, it will have this good  
effect—you will discover how wonderfully  
small trifling expenses mount up to large  
sums, and will discern what might have been  
and may for the future be saved, without  
occasioning any great inconvenience.  
  
In short, the way to wealth, if you desire  
it, is as plain as the way to market. It de-  
pends chiefly on two words—industry and fru-  
gality; that is, waste neither time nor money,  
but make the best use of both. Without  
industry and frugality nothing will do, and  
with them everything. He that gets all he  
can honestly, and saves all he gets (necessary  
expenses excepted) will certainly become rich,  
if that Being who governs the world, to whom  
all should look for a blessing on their honest  
endeavors, doth not, in His wise providence,

Remember that time is money. He  
that can earn ten shillings a day by  
his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle  
half of that day, though he spends  
but sixpence, during the whole of  
  
shillings besides.  
Remember that credit is money,  
If a man lets his money lie in my  
hands after it is due, he gives me the  
interest, or so much as I can make of  
it in that time. This amounts to a  
considerable sum where a man has  
good and large credit, and makes  
good use of it.  
  
Remember that money is of a pro-­  
lific generating nature. Money can  
beget money, and its offsprings can  
beget more, and so on. Five shill-­  
ings turned is six; turned again it is  
seven and threepence; and so on till  
it becomes a hundred pounds. The  
more there is of it the more it pro-­  
duces every turhing, so that the  
profit rises quicker and quicker. He  
that kills a breeding sow, destroys all  
her offspring to the thousanth gene-­  
ration. He that murders a crown,  
destroys all that it might have pro-­  
duced, even scores of pounds.  
  
Remember that six pounds a year,  
is but a groat a day. For this little  
sum (which may be dally wasted  
either in time or expense, unpre-­  
ceived) a man of credit may, on his  
own security, have the constant pos-­  
session of a hundred pounds.  So  
much in stock, briskly furned by an  
industrious man, produces greal ad.­  
vantage.  
  
Rember this saying: &quot;The good  
paymaster is lord of another man&#x27;s  
purse.&quot; He that is known to pay  
punctually and exactly to the time  
he promises, may at any time, and on  
any occasion, raise all the money his  
friends can spare. This is sometimes  
of great use. After industry and  
frugallty, nothing contributes more  
to the raising of a young man in the  
world, than punctuality and justice  
in all his dealings; therefore, never  
keep borrowed an hour beyond the  
time you promised, lest a disappoint-­  
ment shut up your friend&#x27;s purse for-­  
ever.  
  
The most trifling actions that ef.­  
fect a man&#x27;s credit are to be regarded.  
  
he sound of your hammer at five  
in the morning or nine at night,  
heard by a creditor, makes him eas.­  
ier six months longer; but if he sees  
you at a billiard table, or hears your  
volce at a tavern, when you should  
be at work, he sends for his money  
the next day; demands it before he  
can receive it in a lump.  
  
It shows beside that you are mind.­  
ful of what you owe; it makes you  
appear a careful as well as an honest  
man, and that still increases your  
credit.  
  
Beware of thinking all your own  
that you posess and of livilg accord.­  
ingly. It is a mistake that many  
people who have credit fall into.To  
prevent this, keep an exact account.  
for some time, both of your expenses  
and your income. If you take the  
pains at first to mention particulars,  
It will have this good effect; you  
will see how wonderfully small tri  
fling expenses mount up to large  
sums, and will discern what might  
have been, and may for the future be  
saved, without occasioning great in-­  
convenience.  
  
In short the way to wealth, if you  
desire it, is as plain as the way to  
market. It depends chiefly on two  
words, industry and frugality, that  
is, waste neither time nor money, but  
make the best use of both. Without

Maxims of Dr. Franklin.  
Remember that time is money. He  
that can earn ten shillings a day by his  
labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle one  
half of that day, though he spends but  
six pence during his diversion or idle­  
ness, ought not to reckon that the only  
expense; he has really spent or rather  
thrown away five shillings besides.  
*• Remember that credit is money. If  
a man lets his money be in my hands after  
it is due, he gives me the interest, or so  
much as I can make of it during that  
time, this amounts to a considerable sum  
where a man has good and large credit,  
and makes good use of it.  
Remember that money is of a prolific  
generating nature. Money can beget  
money and its offspring can beget m&lt; re,  
and soon. Five shillings turned is six;  
turned again it is seven and three pence ;  
and so on till it becomes a hundred  
pounds. The more there is of it, the  
more it produces eVery turning so  
that the profits rise quicker and quicker.  
He that kills a breeding sow, destroys  
her offspring to the thousandth genera­  
tion. lie that murders a (Inlur, destroys  
all that it might have produced even  
scores of pounds.  
Remember that 3ix pounds a year, is  
but a groat a day. For this little sum,  
which may be daily waisted either in  
time or expense unperceived a man of  
credit may on his own security have the  
constant possesion and use of a hundred  
pounds. So murk instock briskly turned  
by an industrious man, produces great  
advantage.  
Remember this sajing, The good pay­

ERANKLIN&#x27;S ALYICE To YoUNeIRADeSMeN.  
Remember that time is motey- He that  
can earn 10 shillings a day at his labor, and  
goes abroad or sits idle on-hal of that day,  
though he spends but a sixpenr during his  
diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon  
that the only expense; he has spent, or  
rather thrown away, five shillngs besides. 11  
Remember that credit is money.-If a man  
lets his money lie in my handsafter it is due,  
because he has a good opinion of my credit,  
he gives me the interest, or so much as I  
can make off the the meney during that  
time. This amounts to a considerable sum  
where a man has large credit and makes  
good use of it.  
Remember that money is of prolific or  
multiplying nature.-Money can produce  
moncy and its offspring can produce more,  
and so on. Five shillings turned is six  
turned again it is seven and three pence;  
and so on, until it becomes a hundred pounds.  
The more there is of it the more it produces  
every turning so that the profits rise quicker  
and quicker. He that throws away a crown  
destroys all that it might have produced,  
even scores of pounds.  
Remember that six pounds a year is but a  
groat a day.-For this little sum (which  
may be daily wasted, either in time or  
expense, unperceived) a man of credit may,  
on his own security, have the constant pos­  
session and use of 100 pounds. So much in  
stock briskly turned by and industrious man,  
produces great advantage.  
Remember the saying. &quot;The good paymast­  
er is lord of an other man&#x27;s purse.&quot; He  
that is known to pay punctually and exactly  
to the time he promises, may at any time  
and on any occassion, raise all the money his  
friends can spare. This is sometimes of  
great use. Next to industry and frugality,  
nothing contributes more to the raising of  
a man in the world than punctuality and  
justice in all dealing; theretore never keep  
borrowed money an hour beyond the time  
promised, lest a disappointment shut up  
your friends purse forever.  
The most trifling actions that effect a man&#x27;s  
credit are to be regarded. The sound of the  
hammer at five in the morning, or at nine at  
night, heard by a creditor, makes him easy  
six months longer; if he sees you at a billiard  
table, or hears your voice at a tavern, when  
you should be at work, he sends for his  
money the next day, and demands it before  
it is convenient for you to pay him.  
Beware of thinking all your own that you  
possess, and of living accordingly.  This is  
a mistake that many people who have cred it  
fall into. To prevent this keep an exact  
account for some time, both of your expenses  
and your income. If you take pains at first  
to enumerate particulars it will have this  
good effect--you will discover how wonder-  
ully small, trifling expenses mount up to  
sums, and will discarn what might have  
been and may for the future be saved, with­  
out occasioning any great inconvenience.  
In short, the way to wealth, if you desire  
it, is as plain as the way to market. It  
depends chiefly on two things--industry and  
frugality; that is, waste neither time nor  
money, but make the best use of both.  
Without industry and frugality nothing will  
do, and with them everything. He that  
gots all he can honestly, and saves all he  
gets, necessary expenses excepted, will  
certainly become rich- if that Being who  
governs the world, to whom all should look  
for a blessing on their honest endeavors, does  
not, in His wise providence, otherwise

thing, however, that bears some­  
what on work and time. It is from  
Tranklln&#x27;a &quot;Advice to a Young  
Tradesman:&quot;  
&quot;Remember that time is money.  
He that can earn ten shillings a day  
by his labor, and goes aboard or sits  
Idle one-half of that day, though be  
spends but sixpence during his di­  
version or idleness, ought not to  
reckon that the only expense; be has  
really spent, or rather thrown away,  
five shillings besides. In  
short the way to wealth la as plain  
as the way to market. It depends  
chiefly on two words Industry and  
frngafity ; that is, waste neither time  
nor money, but make the best use of  
both. Without industy and frugal­  
ity nothing will go, and with tnem,  
everything. He that gets all he can  
honestly, and saves all be gets (ne­  
cessary expenses excepted), will cer­  
tainly become rich If that being  
who governs the world, to whom all  
should look for a blessing on their  
honest endeavors, doth not, in his  
wise providence, otherwise deter
