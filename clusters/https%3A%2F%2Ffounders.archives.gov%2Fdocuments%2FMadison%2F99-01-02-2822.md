r,  
						Washington March 17th. 1808.  
					  
					Being deeply impressed with the Sense of His Majesty’s anxiety, that full effect should be given to those views of justice and moderation, by which His Conduct has been regulated thro’ the whole of the unfortunate transaction whence the present differences  
						have arisen; and of the disappointment with which He would learn the frustration of his just and equitable purposes; I have felt it incumbent upon me, on the receipt of the letter which you did me the honor to address to me on the 5th. Instant; to apply anew to this matter  
						the most ample and serious consideration. It is with the most painful sensation of regret, that I find myself on the result of it, under the necessity of declining to enter into the terms of negotiation, which by direction of the President of the United States, you therein  
						offer. I do not feel myself competent, in the present instance, to depart from those instructions, which I stated in my letter of the 26th. of January last, and which preclude me from acceding to the condition thus proposed. I should add, that I am  
						absolutely prohibited from entering upon matters unconnected with the specific object I am authorised to discuss, much less can I thus give any pledge concerning them. The condition suggested moreover leads to the direct inference that the Proclamation of the President of the  
						United States of the 2d. of July 1807, is maintained either as an equivalent for reparation for the time being, or as a compulsion to make it.  
					It is with the more profound regret that I feel myself under the necessity of declaring, that I am unable to act upon the terms thus proposed, as it becomes my duty to inform you, in conformity to my instructions, that on the rejection of the demand stated  
						in my former letter, on the part of His Majesty, my Mission is terminated. And as His Majesty’s Government in providing me with those instructions, did not conceive that after the declaration of His Sentiments respecting the Affair of the Chesapeake was made known to this  
						Government, the state of any transactions pending or unterminated between the two nations could justify the perseverance in the enforcement of the Presidents Proclamation, I can exercise no discretion on this point.  
					As on a former occasion I detailed, tho’ minutely, the motives for that demand on the part of His Majesty, which I with so much concern learn to be deemed inadmissible by the Government of the United States; I should here abstain from an exposition of them  
						which visibly can have no further effect upon the Negotiation, if I did not deem it essential that they should not be left under any misapprehension, which I might be able to remove. I shall therefore take a short review of the transaction, which has given rise to these  
						discussions, in order the more Correctly to determine the soundness of the principle upon which that demand is made.  
					Certain deserters from His Majesty’s Navy, many of them his natural born Subjects, having entered into the service of the United States, were repeatedly and fruitlessly demanded by the British officers  
					° of the Recruiting offices of the United States,  
					°This interlineation was made by Mr Rose himself. J Graham  
					but were retained in their new Service. As it was a matter of Notoriety that several of these deserters were on board the Frigate of the United States the Chesapeake. They were demanded of that frigate on the high seas by His Majesty’s Ship Leopard, and all  
						knowledge of their presence on board being denied, she was attacked, and four of them, one avowedly a native Englishman, were taken out of her. Without being deterred by the consideration of how far circumstances hostile in their nature, had provoked, tho they undoubtedly by  
						no means justified this act of the British Officer, his Majesty’s government directed that a positive disavowal of the right of search asserted in this case; and of the act of the British Officer as being unauthorised; and a promise of reparation should be conveyed to the  
						American Minister in London, before he had made any representation by order of the United States. This disavowal made on the 2d. of August last, was transmitted by him to his government, before the 6th. of that month. But before Mr. Monroe had received his orders to demand  
						reparation, his Majesty learnt, with what surprise it is needless to dwell upon, that the President of the United States had interdicted by proclamation bearing date the 2d. of July 1807, the Entry of all their ports to the whole of His Navy; this surprise was certainly  
						encreased, when in the letter delivered by that Minister to require redress for the wrong, altho it went into details unconnected with it, not only no concern was expressed on the part of the United States, at having felt themselves compelled to enact measures of so much,  
						injury and indignity towards a friendly power, but no mention was made of the causes of such measures being resorted to or even of the fact of their having been adopted. In addition to the embarrassment arising from these circumstances, and the insufficiency of the  
						explanations subsequently given to Mr Canning; the introduction of a Subject foreign to that of the complaint became the main impediment to the success of the discussions which took place in London.  
					When I had the honor to open the Negotiation with you; Sir, as I had learnt that the President’s Proclamation was still in force, it became my duty, conformably to my instructions, to require its recall as a preliminary to further discussion; had it not  
						been in force, I was not ordered to have taken it into consideration in the adjustment of reparation; and it was considered as hardly possible that it should not have been recalled immediately upon the knowledge of his Majesty’s disavowal of the attack upon  
						the Chesapeake, as an unauthorised Act. But His Majesty could not suffer the negotiation to be carried on, on his behalf, under an interdict, which even if justifiable, in the first moment of irritation, cannot be continued after the declaration of His Majesty’s sentiments  
						upon the transaction, except in a spirit of hostility.  
					It might have been fairly contended that in the first instance, the exercise of such an act of power, before reparation was refused or unduly protracted, was incompatible with the purposes and essence of pacific negotiation, and with a demand of redress  
						thro’ that channel, but Such have been His Majesty’s Conciliatory views, that this argument has not been insisted on, altho it might now be the more forcibly urged, as it appears that the government of the United States was from the first sensible that, even had hostility  
						been meditated by the British Government, it would not have commenced it in such a manner. But the exception taken, is to the enforcement continued up to the present time, of measures highly unfriendly in their tendency, persisted in, not only after the disavowal in question;  
						the promise of the proffer of suitable reparation; and the renewed assurances of His Majesty’s amicable disposition; but, after security has been given in a public instrument bearing date the 16th. of October 1807 that the claim to the seizure of deserters from the national  
						ships of other powers, cannot again be brought forward by His Majesty’s Naval Officers, it is unnecessary to dwell upon the injury and indignity to which His Majesty’s service is exposed both as touching the freedom and security of correspondents of His agents and accredited  
						Ministers in the United States, or as resulting from a measure which in time of war, excludes the whole of His Navy from all their ports, which ports are completely open to the fleets of His enemies; it will be sufficient to observe that even where exemptions from it are  
						granted, they are made subject to such conditions, that of the three last British Ships of War, which have entered these ports upon public business, two of them, His Majesty’s Ship Statira having on board a minister sent out for the adjustment of the present differences and a  
						schooner bearing dispatches, in consequence of their inability to procure pilots, were obliged to enter these waters without such assistance and were exposed to considerable danger. Great Britain, by the forms established, could repair the wrong committed, even to the  
						satisfaction of the United States, no otherwise than by the channel of negotiation; yet she avowed distinctly, that a wrong was committed, and that she was ready to make reparation for it; it cannot therefore be contended, that the unavoidable delay of actual reparation  
						subjected Her to the imputation of persisting in an aggression, which was disclaimed from the first; if this is true, however much She will regret any impediment in the adjustment of a difference, in which the feelings of this nation are so materially interested, can she  
						consistently with a due care of her own honor and interests, allow it to be concluded on her part under an adherence to a conduct, which has a decided character of enmity in the proceedings held towards her by the other party.  
					I know not in what view the perseverance in the Presidents proclamation up to this moment can be considered, but in that of a measure of retaliation; or of self-assumed reparation; or a measure intended to compel reparation; unless it be that which if I  
						rightly understand, you define it to be, a measure of precaution.  
					If when a wrong is committed, retaliation is instantly resorted to by the injured party, the door to pacific adjustment is closed, and the means of conciliation are precluded. The right to demand reparation is incompatible with the assumption of it. When  
						parties are in a State of mutual hostility, they are So far on a footing, and as Such they may treat; but a party disclaiming every unfriendly intention, and giving unequivocal proofs of an amicable disposition, cannot be expected to treat with another, whose conduct towards  
						it has the direct effects of actual hostility. If then the enforcement of the Presidents Proclamation up to the present moment, is a measure of Self assumed reparation, it is directly repugnant to the spirit and fact of amicable negotiation; if it is a measure to compel  
						reparation, it is equally so; and by the perseverance in it Great Britain is dispensed with the duty of proferring redress. But if it is a measure of precaution, in order to secure reparation or in order to compel it, it falls under the objections I have just stated. If it is  
						a precaution adopted as a Guard against acts of violence apprehended on the part of His Majesty’s naval officers, it surely cannot be considered as being as effectual a security as that arising from the renewed assurances of His Majesty’s friendly disposition, which imply a  
						due observance of the rights of nations with which Great Britain is in amity, by all persons holding authority under His Majesty’s Government; from the disavowal of the pretension of the search of national ships; and from the further assurance of that  
						disavowal given in His Majesty’s Proclamation of the 16th. of October last. Neither under these concurrent circumstances can the plea of necessity be maintained, and if such a proceeding has not the plea of necessity, it assumes the character of aggression. If these  
						concurrent securities against Such an apprehension have any value, the necessity no longer exists; if they are of no value, negotiation cannot be attempted, as the basis upon which it rests, the mutual confidence of the two parties, would be wholly wanting. From the moment  
						after the unfortunate affair of the Chesapeake, that His Majesty’s naval commanders in these waters had ascertained that they were safe from the effervescence of that popular fury, under which the most glaring outrages were committed and by which they were very naturally led  
						to the supposition that they were objects of particular hostility and that a state of war against them, requiring precautions on their part had commenced; no conduct has been imputed to them, which could vindicate the necessity of maintaining in force the President’s  
						Proclamation.  
					Since that time Such of those officers as have been necessitated by the circumstances of the war to remain in these waters, have held no communication with the shore, except in an instance too trifling to dwell upon and instantly disavowed by the commanding  
						officer; and they have acquiesced quietly in various privations, highly prejudicial to the service they were upon, and in consequence of an interdict, which had they been regardless of their duties towards a state in amity with their sovereign, and had they not carefully  
						repressed the feelings its tone and language had a direct tendency to provoke in them would have rather excited than have averted the evils it was Stated to be intended to prevent, were they regardful of these duties, it was unnecessary. Had they felt themselves obliged  
						completely to evacuate the Waters of the United States, especially whilst an enemy’s squadron was harboured in them, They could have done it, but under the admission of hostile compulsion, and under such compulsion, carried into full effect, His Majesty could not have  
						dissembled the extent of the injury received.  
					In the several cases adduced, in which Great Britain required certain preliminaries, previously to entering into negotiation, she regulated her conduct by the same principles to which She now adheres; and refused whilst no hostility was exhibited on her  
						part, to treat with Powers, whose proceedings denoted it towards her; and who maintained their right in what they had assumed.  
					From the considerations thus offered I trust that neither the order of reason or that of usage are in contradiction to the demand I have urged, nor am I aware how the order of time opposes the revocation in the first instance of that act, which affects  
						injuriously one of the Parties, and is still avowed by the other.  
					The subject is thus presented to you, Sir, in the light in which it was natural, that it should offer itself to His Majesty’s Government. It certainly conceived the Presidents Proclamation to rest chiefly and most materially upon the attack made upon the  
						Frigate of the United States, the Chesapeake, by His Majesty’s Ship Leopard, altho’ other topics were adduced as accessories; In this apprehension it may be held to have been Sufficiently warranted, by the precise time at which, and the circumstances, under which it was  
						issued; and by its whole context, and the more so, as the impulse under which it was drawn up appears to have been so sudden, as to have precluded a due examination of all the grounds of allegation contained in it. And here I beg leave to assure you, that with respect to the  
						spirit, and tone of that instrument, it would be highly satisfactory to me, if I could feel myself justified in expressing on the part of His Majesty any degree of coincidence with the opinions you have anounced, or when thus appealed to, and making every allowance for the  
						irritation of the moment, I could dissemble the extreme surprize experienced by Great Britain, that the Government of a friendly Nation, even before an amicable demand of reparation was made, and yet meaning to make that demand; Should have issued an edict directing measures  
						of injury very disproportionate to what it knew was an unauthorised offence, and both in its terms and its purport so injurious to the government to which that demand was to be addressed, &amp; tending to call forth in both Nations the feelings under which a friendly  
						adjustment would be the most difficult. But if as I learn from you, Sir, the Proclamation rests Substantially on other causes, it is then peculiarly to be regretted, that together with the demand for redress made in September last, the Government of the United States did not  
						think fit to offer a negotiation, or an explanation of so momentous a measure, or to declare that its recall must be more or less connected with the adjustment of other alledged wrongs. Neither did it think it necessary to return any answer to the remonstrance given in by His  
						Majestys Envoy at Washington, on the 13th. of July 1807 in which he represented &quot;that he considered that interdiction to be so unfriendly in its object, and so injurious in its consequences to His Majestys interests, that he could not refrain from expressing the most sincere  
						regret, that it ever should have been issued, and most earnestly deprecating its being enforced&quot;.  
					It could not be supposed that a circumstance of so great weight could be over looked by His Majesty’s Government, in determining the line of conduct to be held in the negotiation: and as little could it be expected to pass it over, when on the failure of  
						the discussions with Mr. Monroe, it directed a special mission to be sent to the United States. It had the less reason to imagine that any other grievances could be connected with that for the adjustment of which I am empowered to negotiate, as Mr. Monroe, in his letter to  
						Mr. Canning, of the 29th. of July last, had stated with respect to other subjects of remonstrance that it was improper to mingle them with the present more serious cause of complaint, an opinion to which Mr. Canning declared his perfect assent, in his letter to that Minister  
						of the 2d. of the subsequent month; so that this act was left as single and distinct to be singly and distinctly considered. His Majesty’s Government therefore could not consistently with any view of the subject then before it, or indeed with the just object of my Mission,  
						direct or empower me to enter upon matters not connected with that of the Chesapeake, and they could with the less propriety do it, as in order to render the adjustment of differences of such a nature, the more easy and the more conspicuous, the Ministers charged especially  
						with such offices have been with few, if any exceptions restricted to the precise affair to be negotiated. With respect therefore to those other causes of complaint, upon which you inform me that the Presidents Proclamation rests, I cannot be furnished with documents enabling  
						me either to admit or to controvert those statements of grievance foreign to the attack upon that Ship contained in your letter; or authorised to discuss the matters themselves. I shall therefore not allow myself to offer Such Comments as my personal knowledge of some of  
						those transactions suggest to me, altho their tendency would materially affect both the marked manner in which those transactions are pourtrayed, and the disadvantageous light in which His Majesty’s Government is represented to have acted respecting them. I am moreover led to  
						the persuasion that my Government will be the more easily able to rescue itself from inculpation, by the inference arising from passages in Mr. Monroe’s letter to Mr. Secretary Canning of the 29th. of September last, that the differences unhappily existing between the two  
						nations were in a train of adjustment.  
					If His Majesty has not permitted me to enter into the discussion of the Search of Neutral Merchant Ships for British Seamen, together with the adjustment of the amount of reparation for the attack upon the Chesapeake; it was no wise with a view of  
						precluding the further agitation of that question at a Suitable time; but it was that the Negotiation might be relieved from the Embarrassment arising from the connection of the present Matter with one So foreign to it, and, as it was but too well known, So difficult to be  
						adjusted, of a right distinctly disclaimed, with one which Great Britain has at all times asserted, of enforcing her claim to the services of her natural born subjects, when found on board Merchant Vessels of other Nations; a claim which she founds in that principle of  
						universal law, which gives to the State the right of requiring the aid and assistance of her native Citizens. The recurrence therefore to that course of negotiation, which had been originally settled between Mr. Secretary Canning and Mr. Monroe, and which had been alone  
						broken in upon by the orders subsequently received by that Minister, can only be considered as a resumption of that course of things which Great Britain strenuously contended there was no ground to depart from. I may observe that this purpose might have been effected without  
						the intervention of a Special Minister.  
					It will be in your recollection, Sir, that in our first interview, I stated the condition, which makes the subject of the present letter, before I was informed by you, that the President of the United States would consent to the separation of the two  
						subjects.  
					I had trusted that the exposition, which I added in my letter of the 26th. of January to the verbal explanation I had before offered, of the grounds of His Majesty’s demand, was both in its purport and in the terms in which it was couched, such as to  
						prevent a suspicion that they were in their intention derogatory to the honor or calculated to wound the just sensibility of this Nation. I may add that such a supposition could not be reconciled with the various ostensible and unequivocal demonstrations of His Majesty’s good  
						faith, and anxiety, that this transaction should be brought to an amicable termination, which were exhibited even prior to any remonstrances made on the part or by order of this Government. The other topics which I felt myself authorised to advance in that letter, in  
						illustration of that amicable disposition on the part of the King, were brought forward from the conviction entertained that they must be of a nature to be satisfactory to this Government, and therefore Such as it was particularly my duty to enforce, but not with a view to  
						rest upon them the right to advance the claim which I have stated.  
					I may here remark, It is obvious that far from requiring that the first steps towards an arrangement of reparation should be taken by the United States, Great Britain has already made them openly and distinctly: they are indubitable testimonies to the  
						respect borne and decidedly marked by Great Britain, to the ties of amity subsisting between the two Nations, and of her cordial desire to maintain them unimpaired; and as such alone they were urged.  
					As His Majesty would have derived sincere satisfaction from the evidence of corresponding feelings on the part of the United States, so it would be the more painful to me, to dwell upon a series of insults and menaces which without any provocation of war  
						like preparation on the part of Great Britain, have been for months accumulated upon her thro’ the United States, and but too frequently from quarters, whose authority necessarily and powerfully commanded attention.  
					I ought perhaps to apologise for adverting to an incidental expression in your Letter, if I did not think it right to remove any ambiguity respecting the nature of the claim which Great Britain maintained to her seamen, native Citizens of the Realm, who  
						have deserted from her service to that of other Powers: it is, that on demand they shall be discharged forthwith, and consequently they shall instantly be freed from their newly contracted obligations.  
					Before I close this letter, allow me to state to you, Sir, that I have felt it my duty to transmit to His Majesty’s Government the exposition, contained in your letter of the 5th. instant, of the various demands on the honor and good faith of Great Britain  
						on which the complaint is made, that satisfaction has not been afforded to the United States, and on which conjointly with the affair of the Chesapeake, you inform me that the Proclamation of the President of the United States of the 2d. of July 1807. is founded. It will be  
						for His Majesty’s Government to determine on the part of Great Britain whether any, and what, obligations remain to be fulfilled by her. Whether any denial, or such protraction of redress have occurred on her part, as to render necessary or justifiable the perseverance in an  
						edict, which when not necessary or justifiable assumes a character of aggression; and whether on the result of these considerations the present negotiation can be resumed on the part of His Majesty with a due regard for His own honor, or with a prospect of a more successful  
						termination.   
					I have the Honor to be with the Highest Consideration, Sir, Your Most Obedient, and Most Humble Servant,

Washington, March \7 th,  
1808.  
SIR,  
  
Being deeply impressed with  
the sense of his majesty’s anxicty  
that full effect should be given to  
those views of justice and mode-  
ration, by which his conduct has  
been regulated through the whole  
of the unfortunate transaction  
whence the present differences  
have arisen ; and of the disappoint-  
ment with which he would learn  
the frustration of his just and equi-  
table purposes; I have felt it in-  
cumbent upon me, on the receipt  
  
423  
  
of the letter which you did me the  
honour to address to me on the 5th  
instant, to apply anew to this mat-  
ter the most ample and serious  
consideration. It is with the most  
painful sensations of regret, that I  
find myself, on the result of it, un-  
der the necessity of declining to  
enter into the terms of negotia-  
tion, which, by direction of the  
president of the United States,  
you therein offer. ,I do not feel  
myself competent, in the present  
instance, to depart from those in-  
structions which I stated in my  
letter of the 26th of January last,  
and which preclude me from ac-  
ceding to the condition thus pro-  
posed.  
  
I should add, that I am abso-  
lutely prohibited from entering  
upon matters unconnected with  
the specific object I am authoriz-  
ed to discuss, much less can fF  
thus give any pledge concerning:  
them. The condition suggested,  
moreover, leads to the direct in-  
ference, that the proclamation of  
the president of the United States,  
of the 2d of July, 1807, is main-  
tained either as an equivalent for  
reparation for the time being, or  
as a compulsion to make it.  
  
It is with the more profound re-  
gret that I feel myself under the  
necessity of declaring, that I am  
unable to act upon the terms thus  
proposed, as it becomes my duty  
to inform you, in conformity to  
my instructions, that, on the re-  
jection of the demand stated in  
my former letter, on the part of  
his majesty, my mission is termi-  
nated. And as his majesty’s go-  
vernment, in providing me with  
those instructions, did not con-  
ceive that, after the declaration of  
his sentiments respecting the af-  
fair of the Chesapeake was made  
known to this government, the  
  
|  
  
424  
  
state of any transactions pending  
or unterminated between the two  
nations could justify the perse-  
verance in the enforcement of the  
president’s proclamation, I can  
exercise no discretion on this  
point.  
  
_ As on a former occasion I de-  
tailed, though minutely, the mo-  
tives for that demand, on the part  
of his majesty, which I with ,so  
much concern learn to be deemed  
inadmissible by the government of  
the United States, I should here  
abstain from an exposition of them,  
which visibly can have no further  
effect upon the negotiation, if I  
did not deem it essential that they  
should not be left under any mis-  
apprehension, which I might be  
able&#x27;toremove. I shall therefore  
take a short review of the transac-  
tion which has given rise to these  
discussions, in order the more cor-  
rectly to determine the soundness  
of the principles upon which that  
demand is made.  
  
Certain deserters from his ma-  
jesty’s navy, many of them his na-  
tural born subjects, having enter-  
ed into the service of the United  
States, were repeatedly and fruit-  
lessly demanded, by the British  
officers, of the recruiting officers of  
the United States, but were retained  
in their new service. As it was  
a matter of notoriety that several  
of these deserters were on board  
the frigate of the United States,  
the Chesapeake, they were de-  
manded of that frigate on the high  
seas, by his majesty’s ship Leo-  
pard, and all knowledge of their  
presence on board being denied,  
she was attacked, and four of them,  
one avowedly a native English-  
man, were taken out of her.  
Without being deterred by the  
consideration of how far circum-  
stances hostile in their nature had  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
provoked, though they undoubt-  
edly by no means justified, this act  
of the British officer, his majesty’s  
government directed, that a posi-  
tive disavowal of the right of search  
asserted in this case, and a pro-  
mise of reparation, should be con-  
veyed to the American minister in  
London, before he had made any  
representation by order of the  
United States.  
  
This disavowal, made on the  
2d of August last, was transmit-  
ted by him to his government be-  
fore the 6th of that month ; but be-  
fore Mr. Munroe had received his  
orders to demand reparation, his  
majesty learnt, with what surprize  
it is needless to dwell upon, that  
the president of the United States  
had interdicted by proclamation,  
bearing date the 2d July, 1807,  
the entry of all their ports to the  
whole of his navy: this surprize  
was certainly increased, when, in  
the letter delivered by that mini-  
ster to require redress for the  
wrong, although it went into de-  
tails unconnected with it, not only  
no concern was expressed, on the  
part of the United States, at hav-  
ing felt themselves compelled to  
enact measures of so much injury  
and indignity towards a friendly  
power, but no mention was made  
of the causes of such measures  
being resorted to, or even of the  
fact of their having been adopted.  
In addition to the embarrassment  
arising from these circumstances,  
and the insufficiency of the ex-  
planations subsequently given to  
Mr. Canning, the introduction of  
a subject foreign to that of the  
complaint became the main im-  
pediment to the success of the  
discussion which took place in  
London. When I had the honour  
to open the negotiation with you,  
sir, as I had learnt that the presi-  
  
AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
dent’s proclamation was still in  
force, it became my duty, con-  
formably to my instructions, to  
require its recal, as a preliminary  
to further discussion ; had it not  
been in force, I was not ordered to  
have taken it into consideration in  
the adjustment of reparation ; and  
it was considered as hardly possi-  
ble, that it should not have been  
recalled, immediately upon the  
knowledge of his majesty’s disa-  
yowal of the attack upon the Che-  
sapeake, as an unauthorized act.  
But his majesty could not suffer  
the negotiation to be carried on,  
on his behalf, under an interdict,  
which, even if justifiable in the first  
moment of irritation, cannot be  
continued after the declaration of  
his majesty’s sentiments upon the  
transaction, except in a spirit of  
hostility.  
  
It might have been fairly con-  
tended, that, in the first instance,  
the exercise of such an act of  
power, before reparation was re-  
fused or unduly protracted, was  
incompatible with the purposes  
and essence of pacific negotiation,  
and with a demand of redress  
through that channel; but such  
have been his majesty’s concilia-  
tory views, that this argument has  
not been insisted on, although it  
might now be the more forcibly  
urged, as it appears that the go-  
vernment of the United States was,  
from the first, sensible, that, even  
had hostilities been meditated by  
the British government, it would  
not have commenced it in such a  
manner. But the exception tak-  
en is to the enforcement continu-  
ed up to the present time, of  
measures highly unfriendly in  
their tendency, persisted in, not  
only after the disavowal in ques-  
tion, the promise of the proffer  
_of suitable reparation, and the re-

instrument, bearing date the 16th  
of October, 1807, that the claim  
to the seizure of deserters from  
the national ships of other powers.  
cannot again be brought forward  
by his majesty’s naval officers. It  
is unnecessary to dwell upon the in-  
jury and indignity to which his  
majesty’s service is exposed, both.  
as touching the freedom and secu-  
rity of correspondence of his  
agents and accredited ministers  
in the United States, or as result-  
ing froma measure, which, in time  
of war, excludes the whole of his  
navy from all their ports, which  
ports are completely open to the  
fleets of his enemies. It will be  
sufficient to observe, that, ever  
where exemptions from it are  
granted, they are made subject to  
such conditions, that of the three  
last ships of war which have en-  
tered these ports upon public busi-  
ness, two of them, his majesty’s  
ship Statira, having on board a  
minister sent out for the adjust-  
ment of the present differences,  
and a schooner bearing dispatches,  
in consequence of their inability  
to procure pilots, were obliged to  
enter their waters without such  
assistance, and were exposed to  
considerable danger. Great Bri-  
tain, by the forms established,  
could repair the wrongs commit-  
ted, even to the satisfaction of the  
United States, no otherwise than  
by the channel of negotiation; yet  
she avowed distinctly, that a wrong  
was committed, and that she was  
ready to make reparation for it: it  
cannot therefore be contended, that  
the unavoidable delay of actual re-  
paration subjected her to the im-  
putation of persisting in an ag-  
gression, which ne disclaimed  
»  
  
426,  
  
from the first ; if this is true, how-  
ever much she will regret any im-  
pediment in the adjustment of a  
difference, in which the feelings  
of this nation| are so materially  
interested, can: she, consistently  
with adue care of her own honout  
and interests, allow it to be con-  
cluded on her part, under an ad-  
herence to a conduct which has a  
decided character of enmity, in  
the proceedings held towards her  
by the other party? I know not  
in what view the perseverance in  
the president’s proclamation, up  
to this moment, can be considered  
but in that of a measure of retali-  
ation, or of self-assumed repara-  
tion ; unless it be that which, if I  
rightly understand, you define it  
to be, a measure of precaution.  
  
~ If, when a wrong is committed,  
retaliation is instantly resorted to  
by the injured party, the door to  
pacific adjustment is closed, and the  
means of conciliation are preclud-  
ed. The right to demand repara-  
tion is incompatible with the as-  
sumption of it. When parties are  
in a state of mutual hostility, they  
are so far on a footing, and as  
such they may treat; but a party  
disclaiming every unfriendly in-  
tention, and giving unequivocal  
proofs of an amicable disposition,  
cannot be expected to treat with  
another, whose conduct towards it  
has the direct effects of actual hos-  
tility. If, then, the enforcement  
of the president’s proclamation, up  
to the present moment, is a mea-  
sure of self-assumed reparation, it  
is directly repugnant to the spirit  
and fact of amicable negotiation ;  
if it is a measure to compel repa-  
‘ration, itis equally so; and by the  
perseverance in it, Great Britain is  
dispensed with the duty of proffer-  
ing redress. But if it is a mea-  
sure of precaution, in order to se-  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER.  
  
cure reparation, or in order to  
compel it, it falls under the ob-  
jections I have just stated. If it  
is a precaution adopted as*e guard  
against acts of violence apprehend-  
ed on the part of his majesty’s na-  
val officers, it surely cannot be  
considered as being as effectual a  
security as that arising from the  
renewed assurances of his majes-  
ty’s friendly disposition, which im-  
ply a due observance of the rights  
of nations with which Great Bri-  
tain is in amity, by all persons  
holding authority under his majes-  
ty’s government; from the disa-  
vowal of the pretension of the  
search of national ships; and irom  
the further assurance of that dis-  
avowal given in his majesty’s pro-  
clamation of the 16th of October  
last: neither under these concur-  
rent circumstances can the plea of  
necessity be maintained; and if  
such a proceeding has not the  
plea of necessity, it assumes the  
character of aggression. If these  
concurrent securities against such  
an apprehension have any value,  
the necessity no longer exists; if  
they are of no value, negotiation  
cannot be attempted, as the basis  
upon which it rests, the mutual  
confidence of the two parties, would  
be wholly wanting.  
  
’ From the moment after the un-  
fortunate affair of the Chesapeake,  
that his majesty’s naval comman-  
ders, in these waters, had ascer-  
tained that they were safe from the  
effervescences of that popular fury,  
under which the most glaring  
outrages were committed, and by  
which they were very naturally  
led to the supposition that they  
were objects of particular hostility,  
arid that a state of war against  
them, requiring precautions on  
their part, had commenced, no  
conduct has been imputed to the

which could vindicate the neces-  
sity of maintaining in force the  
president’s proclamation. Since  
that time, such of those officers  
as have been necessitated, by the  
circumstances of the war, to re-  
main in these waters, have held no  
communication with the shore, ex-  
cept in an instance too trifling to  
dwell upon, and instantly disavow-  
ed by the commanding officer ;  
and they have acquiesced in vari-  
ous privations, highly prejudicial  
tothe service they were upon, and  
in consequence of an interdict,  
which, had they been regardless of  
their duties towaids a state in  
amity with their sovereign, and  
had they not carefully repressed  
the teelings its tone and language  
had a direct tendency to provoke  
in them, would have rather ex-  
cited than have averted the evils it  
was stated to be intended to pre-  
vent; were they regardful of  
these duties, it was unnecessary.  
Had they felt themselves obliged  
completely to evacuate the waters  
of the United States, especially  
whilst an enemy’s squadron was  
harboured in them, they could  
have done it; but under the ad-  
mission of hostile compulsion, and  
under such compulsion, carried in-  
to full effect, his majesty could  
not have dissembled the extent of  
the injury received.  
  
In the several cases adduced, in  
which Great Britain required cer-  
tain preliminaries, previously to  
entering into negotiation, she re-  
gulated her conduct by the same  
principles to which she now ad-  
heres; and refused, whilst no hos-  
tility was exhibited on her part, to  
treat with powers whose proceed-  
ings denoted it towards her, and  
who maintained their right in what  
they had assumed.  
  
From the considerations thus  
offered, I trust that neither the  
order of reason, or that of usage,  
are in contradiction to the demand  
I have urged; noram I aware how  
the order of time opposes the re-  
vocation, in the first instance, of  
that act, which affects injuriously  
one of the parties, and is still  
avowed by the other.  
  
The subject is thus presented to  
you, sir, in the light in which it  
was natural that it should offer it-  
self to his majesty’s government.  
It certainly conceived the presi-  
dent’s proclamation to rest chiefly,  
and most materially, upon the at-  
tack made upon the frigate of the  
United States, the Chesapeake, by  
his majesty’s ship Leopard, al-  
though other topics were adduced  
as accessories. In this apprehen-  
sion it may be held to have been  
sufficiently warranted, by the pre-  
cise time at which, and the cir-  
cumstances under which, it was  
issued, and by its whole context ;  
and the more so, as the impulse  
under which it was drawn up ap-  
  
ars to have been so sudden as to  
have precluded a due examination  
of all the grounds of allegation  
contained in it. And here I beg  
leave to assure you, that, with res-  
pect to the spirit and tone of that  
instrument, it would be highly sa-  
tislactory to me, if 1 could fecl  
myself justified in expressing, on  
the part of his majesty, any de-  
gree of coincidence with the opi-  
nions you have announced; or  
  
when thus appealed to, and making»  
  
every allowance for the irritation  
of the moment, I could dissem-  
ble the extreme surprize occasion-  
ed in Great Britain, that the go-  
vernment of a friendly nation,  
even before an amicable demand  
of reparation was made, and yet

meaning to make that demand,  
should have issued an edict direct-  
ing measures of injury very dis-  
proportionate to what it knew was  
an unauthorized offence, and, both  
in its terms and its purport, so in-  
jurious to the government to  
which that demand was to be ad-  
dressed, and tending to call forth  
in both nations the feelings under  
which a friendly adjustment would  
be the most difficult. But if, as I  
learn from you, sir, the proclama-  
tion rests substantially on other  
causes, it is then peculiarly to  
be regretted, that, together with  
the déniarid for redress made in  
September last, the government  
of the United States did not think  
fit to offer a negotiation, or an ex-  
planation of so momentous a mea-  
  
‘sure, or to declare that its recal  
  
must be more or less connected  
  
‘with the adjustment of other alleg-  
‘ed wrongs. Neither did it think  
‘it Necessary to return any answer  
  
to the remonstrance given in by  
his majesty’s envoy at Washing-  
  
‘ton, on the 13th July, 1807, in  
  
which he represented “that he  
considered that interdiction to be  
so unfriendly in its object, and so  
injurious in its consequences to his  
majesty’s interests, that he could  
not réfrain from expressing the  
most sincere regret, that it ever  
should have been issued, and most  
earnestly deprecating its being en-  
forced.”  
  
It could not be supposed that a  
circumstance of so great weight  
could be overlooked by his majes-  
ty’s government, in determining  
the line of conduct to be held in  
the negotiation ; and as little could  
  
it be expected to pass it over, when,  
‘on the failure of the discussion  
“with Mr. Monroe, it directed a  
  
special mission to be sent to the  
United States. It had the less  
  
REGISTER.  
  
reason to imagine that any other  
grievances could be connected  
with that, for the adjustment of  
which I am empowered to negoti-  
ate, as Mr. Monroe, in his letter  
to Mr. Canning of the 29th July  
last, had stated, with repect to  
other subjects of remonstrance,  
that it was improper to mingle  
them with the present more seri-  
ous cause of complaint: an opi-  
nion to which Mr. Canning declar-  
ed his perfect assent, in his letter  
to that minister of the 2d of the  
subsequent month; so that this  
act was left as single and distinct,  
to be singly and distinctly consi-  
dered. His majesty’s govern-  
ment, therefore, could not, con-  
sistently with any view of the sub-  
ject then before it, or, indeed,  
with the just object of my mis-  
sion, direct or empower me to en-  
ter upon matters not connected  
with that of the Chesapeake ; and  
they could with the less propriety  
do it, as, in order to render the  
adjustment of differences of such  
a nature the more easy and the  
more conspicuous, the minister,  
charged especially with such of-  
fices, has been, with few if any  
exceptions, restricted to the pre-  
cise affair to be negotiated.  
With respect, therefore, to those  
other causes of complaint, upon  
which you inform me that the  
president’s proclamation rests, I  
cannot be furnished with docu-  
ments enabling me either to ad-  
mit or to controvert those state-  
ments of grievances, foreign to  
the attack upon that ship, contained  
in your letter, or authorized to  
discuss the matters themselves.  
  
I shall therefore not allow my-  
self to offer such comments as  
my personal knowledge of some  
of those transactions suggest to  
me, although their tendency  
  
AMERICAN STATE PAPERS.  
  
would materially affect both the  
marked manner in which those  
transactions are pourtrayed, and  
the disadvantageous light in which  
his majesty’s’ government is re-  
presented to have acted respecting  
them. Iam moreover led to the  
persuasion, that my government  
will be the more easily able to  
rescue itself from inculpation, by  
the inference arising from passa-  
ges in Mr. Monree’s letters to Mr.  
secretary Canning, of the: 29th  
September last, that the differences  
unhappily existing between the two  
nations were in a train of ad-  
justinent.  
  
If his majesty has not permit-  
ted me toenter into the discussion  
of the search of neutral merchant  
ships, for British seamen, together  
with the adjustment of the amount  
of reparation for the attack upon  
the Chesapeake, it was nowise  
with a view of precluding the fur-  
ther agitation of that question at  
a suitable time ; but it was that the  
negotiation might be relieved from  
the embarrassment arising from  
the connection of the present mat-  
ter with one so foreign to it, and,  
as it was but too well known, so  
difficult to be adjusted ; of a right  
distinctly disclaimed, with one  
which Great Britain has at all  
times asserted, of enforcing her  
claim to the services of her na-  
tural born subjects, when found on  
board merchant vessels of other  
nations: a claim which she founds  
in that principle of universal law,  
which gives to the state the right  
of requiring the aid and assistance  
of her native citizens. ‘The re-  
  
currence, therefore, to that cause  
of negotiation, which had been ori-  
ginally settled between Mr. Can-  
ning and Mr. Monroe, and which.  
had been alone broken in upon by  
  
429  
  
the orders subsequently received  
by that minister, can only be con-  
sidered as a resumption of that  
course of things which Great Bri-  
tain strenuously contended there  
was no ground to depart from. I  
may observe that this purpose  
might have been effected without  
the intervention of a special mi-  
nister.  
  
It will be in your recollection,  
sir, that, in our first interview, I  
stated the condition which makes  
the subject of the present letter,  
before I was informed by you that  
the president of the United States  
would consent to the separation of  
the two subjects.  
  
I had trusted that the exposition  
which I added in my letter of the  
26th of January, to the verbal ex-  
planation I had before offered, of  
the grounds of his majesty’s de-  
mand, was, both in its purport and  
in the terms in which it was couch-  
ed, such as to prevent a suspicion  
that they were in their intention  
derogatory to the honour, or cal-  
culated to wound the just sensibili-  
ty of the nation. I may add that  
such a supposition could not be re-  
conciled with the various ostensi-  
ble and unequivocal demonstra-  
tions of his majesty’s good faith  
and anxiety that this transaction  
should be brought to an amicable  
termination, which were exhibited  
even prior to any remonstrance on  
the part or by order of this govern-  
ment. ‘The other topics which I  
felt myself authorized to advance  
in that letter, in illustration of that  
amicable disposition on the part of  
the king, were brought forward  
from the conviction | entertained  
that they must be of a nature  
very satisfactory to this govern-  
ment, and therefore such as it was  
particularly my duty to enforce,  
  
4  
«&lt;7  
-

but not with a view to rest upon  
them. the right to advance the  
claim which | have stated.  
  
_ I may here remark, it is obvious  
that, far from requiring that the  
first steps towards an arrangement  
of reparation should be taken by  
the United States, Great Britain  
has already made them openly and  
distinctly : they are indubitable tes-  
timonies to the respect borne and  
decidedly marked by Great Bri-  
tain, to the ties of amity subsisting  
between the two nations, and of her  
cordial.desire to maintain them un-  
impaired; and as such alone they  
were urged.  
  
As his majesty would have de-  
rived sincere satisfaction from the  
evidence of corresponding feeling  
on the part of the United States ;  
so it would be the more painful to  
me to dwell upon a series of insults  
and menaces, which, without any  
provocation of warlike preparation  
on the part of Great Britain, have  
been for months accumulated upon  
her through: the United Siates, and  
but too frequentiy from quarters  
whose authority necessarily and  
powerfully commanded attention.  
  
I ought perhaps to apologize for  
adverting to an incidental expres-  
sion in your letter, if I did not  
  
think . it right to remove any am-~  
  
biguity respecting the nature of  
the claim which Great Britain  
.maintained to her seamen, native  
citizens of the realm, who have de-  
serted from her service to that of  
other powers: itis, that on demand  
they shall be discharged forthwith,  
and conseguently they shall in-  
stantly be freed from their newly  
contracted obligations.  
  
Before I close this letter, allow  
me to state to you, sir, that I have  
felt it my duty to transmit to his  
majesty’s government the exposi-  
tion contained in your letter of the  
  
AMERICAN REGISTER:  
  
5th inst., of the various demands  
on the honour and good faith of  
Great Britain, on which the com-  
plaint is made, that satisfaction  
has not been afforded to the Unit-  
ed States, and on which, conjointly  
with the affair of the Chesapeake,  
you inform me that the proclama-  
tion of the president of the United  
States, of the 2d July, 1807, is  
founded. It will be for his ma-  
jesty’s government to determine,  
on the part of Great Britain, whe-  
ther any, and what obligations re-  
main be fulfilled by her; whe-  
ther any denial or such protraction  
of redress have occurred on her  
part, as to render necessary or jus-  
tifiable the perseverance in an  
edict, which, when not necessary  
or justifiable, assumes a character  
of aggression; and whether, on  
the result of these considerations,  
the present negociation can be re-  
sumed on the part of his majesty,  
with a due regard for his own ho-  
nour, or with a prospect of a more  
successful termination. I have  
the honour to be, &amp;c.,

ly on othyr cause-,, r peculi- :  
arl) to be regretted, that, together  
&#x27;ii tiie dei nade in  
Septemiier last, the government of  
I not think fit to offer  
a&#x27;i&#x27; n, or an explanation of  
isure, or to declare  
that its recall must; be more or less  
nent of  
other alleged wrongs. Neither did  
it think it necessary to return any an­  
swer to the remoustr ■ ninby &#x27;  
&#x27; his majesty&#x27;s envoy at \ in,  
•ntheT 13th July, 1807; in which  
represented a that bo considered tint I  
interdiction to be so unfriendly in its  
object) and so injuriou. in its conse- I  
quences to his majesty&#x27;s interests,  
that he could hot refrain from exp  
ing the most sincere regret tiiat it &#x27;  
ever should have been issued, and &#x27;  
most earfie.st.ly deprecating its being (  
enforced.&quot; ■ &#x27;  
It could not be supposed that a &#x27;  
circumstance of so great weight l  
could be overlooked by his majesty&#x27;s f  
government, in d r.iv; the line l  
of conduct to be held in *he nego- (  
elation : and as little could it be \
expected to pass it over, when on  
the failure ofthe discussion with Mr. &#x27;  
Monroe, it directed a special mission !  
to be sent to the Unied Stales. It  
had tlic less reason to imagine that C  
any other grievances could be con- &#x27;  
nccted with that for the adjustment f  
of which I am empowered lone- a  
gociate, as Mr. Monroe, in his let- c  
ter to Mr. Canning of the 29th of l  
July last, had staled with respect to c  
other subjects of remo; that  
it was r to criingle them l

o*l so th*..( this act was left as single

the present letter, before I was in- )  
. formed by you, that tlic president of &#x27;  
g tne United States would consent to v  
j- the separation of the two subjects. &#x27;  
1 had trusted that the exposition, *  
which I added in my letter of the 26th   
r of January to the verb d explanation 1 &#x27;*  
had before o it&#x27;e red, ofthe grounds of &#x27;  
. his majesty&#x27;s demand, was both in its   
t purport, and in I in which it &#x27;J  
was couched, such as to prevent a sus- l  
pinion that they were in their inten- 1;  
tion derogatory to the honor, or calcu- 1]  
bated to wound the just sensibility of   
. this nation. I may add that such a V  
j supposition could not be reconciled *(  
, with the various ostensible and une- s  
gui vocal demonstrations of his majes- &quot;  
ty&#x27;s good faith and anxiety, that this t]  
transaction should be brought to an | c  
amicable termination, winch were ex- c  
nibitcd even prior to any remonstraii-   
• ces on the part, or by order of this *&quot;  
, government. The other topics Which n  
I felt myself authorized to advance In %  
that letter, in illustration of that ami- n  
cable disposition on the part of the l&#x27;  
king, were brought forward from the n  
&#x27; conviction I entertained that they t(  
&#x27; must be of a nature to bo satisfactory a  
to this government, ami therefore, n  
such as it was particularly my duty lo 1  
enforce j but not with a view to rest n  
- upon them the right to advance the l&#x27;  
claim which I have stated. p  
1 may here remark, it is obvious l&#x27;  
that far from requiring that the first S  
ste|)S towards an at range.nent of ;e- *&#x27;  
p nation Should betake., by the Unit-

l- marked by Great Britain, to the lies  
i- of amity subsisting between the two  
t- nations, and of her cordial desiie to  
;t maintain them unimpaired ; and as  
c such alone they were urged.  
&gt;r As his majesty Would have derived  
•s sincere satisfaction from the evidence  
;- of corresponding feelings on the part  
is ofthe United States, so it would be  
:r the more painful to me to dwell upon  
b a series of insults and menaces which,  
c without any provocation of warlike  
•s &#x27; preparation on the part of Great Bri- i  
s tain, have been for months accumu- j

i- deserted from her service to that of o­

Sir—Being deeply impressed with  
! the sense of his majesty&#x27;s anxiety,  
! that full effect should be given to  
those views of justice and modera­  
j tion, by whi:h his conduct has been  
j regulated through the whole of the  
j unfortunate transaction whence the  
j present differences have arisen ; h of  
the disappointment with which he  
would learn the frustration of his just 8c  
equitable purposes ; I have felt it  
incumbent upon me, on the receipt  
ofthe letter v, hich you did me the  
honor to address to me on the sth  
instant, to apply anew to this matter  
the most ample and serious conside­  
ration. It is with the most painful  
sensations of regret that I find my­  
; self on the result of it, under the ne-  
I cessily of declining to enter into  
j the terms of negociation, which by  
; direction of the President of the U-  
J niled States you therein offer. I do  
j not feel myself competent, in the pre­  
i sent instance, to depart from those  
in-:li notions, which I Mated in my  
j Setter of the 26th of January last, and  
j which preclude me from acceding  
to the condition thus proposed. I  
| should add, that I am absolutely pro­  
hibited from entering upon matters j  
unconnected with the specific object  
I am authorized to discuss, much  
less can I thus give any pledge con­  
cerning them. The condition sug­  
gested, moreover, leads to the direct  
inference, that the proclamation ofthe  
President of the United States ofthe  
2d of July 1807, is maintained ei­  
ther as an equivalent for reparation  
for the time being, or as a compulsion  
to make it.  
It is with the more profound regret  
that I feel myself under the neces­  
sity of declaring, that I am unable  
to act noon the terms thus proposed,  
as it becomes my duty to inform  
you, in conformity to my instructions,  
that on the rejection of the demand  
slated in my former letter, on the  
pari of his majesty, my misson is  
terminated, And as his majesty&#x27;s  
government in providing me with  
those instructions, did not conceive  
j that after the declaration of his sen­  
timents respecting the affair of the  
, Chesapeake was made known to this  
i government, the state of any transac­  
tions pending or unterminated be*  
  
twecn the two nations could justify  
the perseverance in the enforcement  
of the Vresident&#x27;s proclamation, I  
can exercise , o discretion on this  
point.  
As on a former occassion I detail­  
ed, though minutely, tie motives for  
that demand on the part of his ma­  
jesty, which I with so much con­  
cern learn to be deemed inadmissi­  
ble by the government of the United  
State*.,! should here abstain from an  
exposition of I hem, which visibly  
can have no further effect upon the  
negociation, if I did not deem it essen­  
tial that they should not be left un­  
der any misapprehension which 1  
might be able to remove. I shall,  
therefore, take a short review of the  
transaction, which has given rise to  
these discussions, in order the more  
correctly lo determine the sound­  
ness of the principle on which that  
demand is made.  
Certain deserters from his majes­  
ty&#x27;s navy, many of them his natural  
born subjects, having entered into  
the service of the United States, j  
were repeatedly and fruitlessly de­  
manded by the British officers, of the i  
recruiting officers of the U. States, i  
but were retained in their new ser- j  
vice. As it was a matter of notoriety j  
that several of these deserters were  
on board the frigate of the United \
States the Chesapeake, thuy were j  
demanded of that frigate on the high ;  
seas by his majesty&#x27;s ship Leopard, j  
and all knowledge of their presence i  
on board being denied, she was ;  
attacked and four of them, one avow- j  
edly a native Englishman, were ta­  
ken out of her. Without being de­  
terred by the consideration of how j  
far circumstances hostile in their &#x27;  
nature had provoked, though they  
undoubtedly by no means justified  
this act of the British officer, his  
majesty&#x27;s government directed, thai  
a positive disavowal of the right of  
search, asserted in this case, and of  
the act of*the British officer as be- ■  
ing unauthorized, and a promise .  
of reparation, should be conveyed to [  
the American minister in London, j  
before he had made any rrpresenta- j  
lion by order of the United States, j  
This disavowal made on the 2d of!  
August last, was transmitted by him ;  
to his government, Before the 6th of j  
that month. But before Mr. Monroe  
had received his orders to demand &#x27;  
reparation, his majesty learnt with  
what surprise it is needles? to dwell \
upon, that, the President of the Unit- j  
ed States had interdicted by procla- !  
million neat big date the 2d July,&#x27;  
1807, the entry of all their ports to  
the whole of his navy. This sur- j  
prise was certainly increased, when in  
the letter delived by that minsister to j  
require redress for the wrong, altlv*&#x27;&quot;  
It went into details unconnected with  
it, not only no concern was express- ;  
ed on the part of the U. States,  
at having felt themselves compel­  
led to enact measures of so much in- i  
jury and indignity towards a friendly  
power, but no mention was made of (  
the causes of such measures being re- j  
sorted to, or even of the fact, of their j  
having been adopted. In addition to  
the embarrassment arising from these /  
circumstances, and the insufficiency of  
the explanations subsequently given  
to Mr. Canning, the introduction of a  
subject foreign to that of the com­  
plaint became the main impediment  
to the success of the discussions which  
took place in London. When I had  
the honor to open the negotiation with  
you, sir, as I had learnt that the pre­  
sident&#x27;s proclamation was still in force, I  
it became my duty, conformably to |  
my instructions, .o require its recall  
as a preliminary to further discussi­  
sion : had it not been in force, 1 was  
not ordered lo have taken it into con­  
sideration in the adjustment of repa­  
ration&#x27;) and it was considered as hardly  
possible that it should not have been  
recalled immediately upon the know­  
ledge of his majesty&#x27;s disavowal of  
the attack upon the Chesapeake, as  
an unauthorized act. But his majes­  
ty could not suffer the negotiation to  
be carried on, on his behalf, under an  
interdict, which even if justifiable in  
the first moment of irritation, cannot  
be continued after the declaration of his  
majcsly&#x27;s sentiments upon the trans­  
action, except in a spirit of hostility.  
It might h„M- b&gt; en fairly comet &lt;cii  
that in the first instance, the ex rcisc  
of sui h in act of power, before repa­  
ration was refu ed or unduly protract­  
ed, whs mc mpatihb- with the purpo­  
ses and essence of p irifir h gociitim,  
and wi&#x27;h a demand of r dress through  
t i c i tin. | ; but such have &#x27;.ten his  
ina&#x27;j-&#x27;stv&#x27;s conciliatory \i-ws, that this  
irgunitnt has not been insisted on,

be brought forward by his majes­

enemies: it will be efficient to ob-«-ry T  
that even where exemptions tom i:  
are granted, they are made subject to  
such conditions, that of the three list  
British ships of w ir,* which hive enter.  
Ed these ports upon public business,  
two of them, his majesty&#x27;s ship Statira  
having on board r minister sent out foi  
the adjustment of the present riifferen­  
c 8, and a -chooner bearine;r&#x27;ispatehCs,  
in consequence of their inability to pro­  
cure pilots, were obliged to enter these  
wat rs without sach assistance, and  
were exposed to considerable d.-uig r.  
G. H itain, by the forms esMbliriled,  
could repair the wrong committed,  
even to the satisfaction of the V. S no  
otherwise tfi&#x27;in by the channel of in g ■&gt;-

: that a wr, i£ was committed, and that  
, she was ready torn k&lt;» r-p ration for

feelings of a nation are so materially  
, interested ; can she with a

I est-, allow it to b&gt; coachid. d on her ,  
under -n adhcr. nee lo a conduct,  
: which hasa oeci&#x27;h d character of • nmu  
|lv in the proceedings held towards her  
by she oth- r part v.  
I kpovv not in what view the - rse­  
yerance in the President&#x27;s proc. na­  
: Hon up tothjs moment can be c r,  
ed, l.»ut in that of a measure of retalia­  
tion ; or of self-assamed r ■ partition ; or  
■ a measure intended to compel repara­  
tion ; unless it be that which, if I  
rightly understand, you defice it to be,  
a measure of precaution,  
If, when a wrong is committed, reta­  
liation is instantly resorted to by the  
injured party, the door to pacific ad­  
justment is closed, and the means of  
conciliation are precluded. The Sight  
to demand reparation is incompatible  
with the assumption of it. When par­  
ties are in a :-t.:te ot mutual hostility,  
they are so far on a footing, and as such  
i they may treat; but a party disclaim*  
j ing every unfriendly intention, and giv­  
| ing unequivocal proofs ot an amicable  
, disposition, cuiunt be expected to treat  
| with another whose conduct toward*  
lit has the direct &lt; fleets ofactu.il hosti­  
lity. If then the enforc ment ofthe presi­  
dent&#x27;s proclamation, up to the present  
moment, is a measure of self-assumed

the spirit and fact of amicable negocia­

ration it. is equally so: Rnd by the per­  
severance in it Great Britain is dis­  
pensed with the duty v( proffering re.  
dress. But, if it is a measure of pre­  
caution, in order to secure reparation,  
or in order to compel n, it falls under  
the objection&#x27;s I have ;u:t stated,, If it  
is a precaution adopted as a guard  
against acts of violence apprehended  
on thApftrt of his majesty&#x27;s naval offi­  
cers, it surely cannot be consider  
being at elf ctual security us that aris­  
ing ttom the renewed assurances of his  
m .jesty&#x27;s tri-ndly disposition, which  
imply a due observance of the lights of  
nations with which Great Britain &gt;s in  
amity, by all persons holding authority  
under his majesty&#x27;s government; from  
the disavowal of the pretension oi the  
search of national ship ; and from the  
further assurance of thai disavowal given  
in h&#x27;s majesty&#x27;s proclam tion of the 16th  
of Oct be r last! neither under thesecoa­  
current circrmstonces can the plea of  
necessity be maintained: and if such&#x27;  
a proceeding has not the plea of neces­  
sity, it assumes the character of ag*  
grei si on. If these, rem v; t- nt securities  
against such . n apprehension h-.ve any  
value, the necessity no long, r exists :  
if they are of no value, negociatioa  
cannot be atu mpt d, as the b..sis upon  
which it tests, the mutual confidence  
ot the two parties, would he wholly

F&#x27;-om the momr-nt after the unfortu­

----- -— wnicn ms conduct  
has been regulated tlirough the whole of  
the unfortunate transaction whence the  
present differences have arisen ; and of  
the disappointment wirh which he would  
earn the frustration of his just and equita­  
ble purposes ; I have felt it incumhefit  
upou me, on the receipt of the letter which  
you did me the honor to addess to  
me on the 5th instant, to apply anew  
to this matter the most ample and serious  
consideration. It is with the most painful  
sensations of regret, that 1 find myself  
on the result of it, under the necessity of  
declining to enter into the teims of negnei­  
a!&#x27;°.n’ -icb by direction of the President  
0 the United States, you therein offer. I  
do not feel myself competent, in the present  
instance, to depart from those instructions,  
which I stated in my letter of the 26th of  
J nuary last, and which preclude me from  
accedingjto the condition thus proposed.  
I shou:d add, that I am absolutely pro&#x27;ll­  
l)iced ti onri entering upon matters unconnec­  
ted with the spec fic object 1 am authoris­  
ed to discuss, mum less can I thus give a­  
ny pledge concerning them. The condi­  
tion suggested, -moreover, leads to the. direct  
mierencc, th ,t the proclamation of the  
Pi esi jevt ot the U. States of the 2nd of J„.  
ly, 1807, i» maintained either as an eqm­  
va!’ut t r reparation for the time being, m*  
a« a compulsion to make it.  
It is w eh the more profouid regret, that I  
feel myse t under the necessity ofdelaring,  
that I am unable to act upon the terms  
thus proposed ; as it becomes qiy duty to  
inform you, In conformity to mv’instruc­  
tions, that on the rejection of the de-mand  
state ! a, my former letter, on the part of  
his majesty, my mission is terminated.—  
And as h:s majesty’s government in pro­  
v‘‘“**K ,ne with those instructions, did not  
conceive that after the dTclaratir.n of his  
sentiments respecting the affair of the Che­  
sapeake was made known to this govern­  
ment, the state of any transactions pending  
r urd^rminated between the two nations,  
could justify the perseverance in the en­  
forcement ol the President’s proclainalion  
1 can exercise no discretion on this poim.  
As on a former occasion I detailed, &lt; hough  
minutely, the motives for that demand, on  
me part of his majesty, which I with so &#x27;  
inch concern learn to he deemed inad­  
missib.e by the government of the U. S,  
I should here abstain from an exposition of  
them, which visibly can have no further  
eneci upon the ncgociation, if I did not  
deem it essential that they should not be  
lift under any misapprehension, which £  
might be able to remove. I shall therefore  
take a short review of the transaction  
which has given rise to these discussions,  
in order the more correctly to determine •  
the soundness of the principles upon which  
that demand is made*.  
Certain deserters from his majesty’s na­  
vy , many of them his natural bnrd subjects  
having entered into the service of the U S  
were repeatedly and fruitlessly demanded  
by British officers, of the recruiting  
officers of the U. States ; but were retain­  
ed in their new service. As it was a mat­  
ter of notoriety that several of these deser­  
  
cers were on hoard the frigate of the U.  
. f rV U hnes«pc*lcc, thev were demand­  
ed o» that frigate on the high seas, by his  
majesty s ship Leopard, nnd all knowledge  
of tucjr presence on board beb p- denied,  
she was attacked, and four of them, one  
avowedly a native Englishman, were ta­  
ken out of her. Without being deterred  
by the consideration of how far circumstan­  
ccs hostile in their nature, had provoked,  
hough they-ndoubtrdly bv no means jusl  
tified, this Act of the British officer, his  
m ijesty s government directed that a po­  
sitive disavowal of the right of search U­  
serted in this case ; and of the at of the  
British officer, as being unauthorised : and  
a promise of reparation, should be conveyed  
to the American minister in London, be­  
-T * ni’w,e any representation by  
order of the IT. S. y  
This disavowal made on the second of  
August last, w IS transmitted by him to his  
government, before the 6th of that month ;  
but before Mr Monroe had received hie  
orders to demand reparation, his majesty  
learnt, with what surprise it is needless to  
dwell upon, that the president of the U  
^tn;cs had interdicted by proclamation*,  
bearing date the 2d of July, 1807, thremiy  
of all their purts to the whole of hisuavy •

it went info details unconnected with it;  
not only no concern w;ri expressed on the  
port of the U States, at having felt them­  
selves compelled to enact measures of sq  
much injury and indignity towardf a friend­  
ly power; hut no mention was made of  
the causes of such measures being resorted  
to, or even of the fact of their having been  
adopted. In addition to the embarrass­  
ment arising from these circumstances, and  
the insuihciency Of the explanations sub­  
sequently given to Mr Canni.ig; the intro­  
duct . r of a subject foreign to that of the  
complaint, because the main impediment  
to the success of the discussion which took&#x27;  
place in London. When I had the honor  
to open the ncgociation with you, sir, as I  
had learnt that the President’s proclama­  
tion was still in force, it became my duty,  
conformably to my instructions, to require  
its recall, as a preliminary to further dis­  
cussion ; had it not been in force, 1 was not  
ordered to have taken it into considerati­  
on In the adjustment of reparation ; and it  
was considered as hardly possible, that it  
should not have been recalled, immediately  
Upon the khowledge of his majesty’s disa­  
vowal of the attack upon the Chesapeake,  
as an unauthorised act.—Hut his majesty  
could not suffer the ncgociation to be carri­  
ed on, on his behalf, under an interdict,  
■Which even if justifiable in the first mo­  
ment of irritation, cannot be continued af­  
ter the declaration of his majesty’s senti­  
ments Upon the transaction, except in a  
spirit of hostility.  
ft might have decn fairly contended, that  
tn the first instance, the exercise of such  
an act of power, before reparation was re­  
fused or unduly protracted, was incompa­  
tible with the purposes and essence of pa­  
cific ncgociation, and with a demand of re­  
dress through that channel ; hut such have  
lieen his majesty’s conciliatory views, that  
this argument has not been insisted on, al­  
though it might now he the more forcibly­  
urged, as it appears that the envernment  
  
or the U. S was from the first sensible that,  
even had hostility been meditated by the  
‘British government, it would not have  
Commenced it in such a manner. But the  
exception taken, is to the enforcement con­  
tinued up to the present time, of measures  
. highlv unfriendly in their tendency, per­  
sisted in, not only after the disavowal in  
question ; the promise of the proffer of  
suitable reparation, and the renewed insur­  
ances of his majesty’s amicable diqrositi­  
«ms, hut, after security has been g ven in  
a public instrument bearing date the 16th  
oc October, ISOf, that the claim to the sei­  
zure of tiie d&lt; sorters from the national ships  
of otln-r powers, cannot again he brought  
forward by h.*, majesty’s naval officer, it is  
unnecessary to dweil upon the injury and  
indignity to which hi a majesty&#x27;s service is  
exposed, hoth as touching the freedom and  
security of correspondence of his agents,  
and accredited ministers in the U. Suites,  
or as resulting from a measure, which in  
time of war, excludes the whole of his na­  
vy from all their ports ; which ports are  
completely open to the fleets of his enemies.  
It will be sufficient to observe, that e*  
ven where exemptions from it are granted,  
they H&lt;e made subject to such conditions,  
that of the three last British rd»;ps of war,  
■wlilclt have entered tl;e.,e pom upoi: pub­  
lic Dili stress, two ot them, his majesty’s ship  
btatira, having on board a minister sent  
cut for the adjustment of the present differ­  
ences and a schooner bearing dispatches,  
in consequence of their inability to procure  
pilots, were obliged to enter their waters  
witheut such assistance, and were exposed  
to considerable danger. Great Britain, by  
the forms established, could repair the  
wrongs commuted, even to the satisfacti­  
on oi the United S&#x27;ates&#x27;, no otherwise than  
by the channel of negociatton; yet she a­  
voweri distinctly, that a wrong was com­  
mitted, and that she w ,s ready to make re­  
paration Jor it; it cannot therefore be con­  
tended, that the unavoidable delay of actu­  
al reparation, subjected her to the impu­  
tation of persisting in an aggression, which  
was disclaimed from t!.e first ; if this is  
true, however much she will regret my  
impediment io the adjustment of a differ­  
ence, in which the fey lings of this nation  
are so materially interested, can she con­  
sistently with a due care of her own honor  
and interests, alln* it to be concluded on  
her part under an adherence to a conduct,  
which has a decided character of enmity in  
till proceedings held towards her by the  
other party.  
I know not in what view the perseveranre  
in the President’s proclamation, up to this  
moment, can be considered, but in that of  
a measure of retaliation; or of self assumed  
repartition ; or a measure intended to com­  
pel reparation ; unless it be that which, if  
1 rightly understand, you define it to he, a  
measure of piecautinu.  
If, wlmna wrong is committed, retaliati­  
on is instantly resorted to by the injured  
party, the door to pacific adjustment is  
closed, and the means of conciliation arc  
precluded. The right to demand repara­  
tion is incompatible with the assumption of  
it. When parties are in a state of mutual  
  
(uiMiiity titey are so nr on a looting;, ami  
as Mich they may treat: Hut a party dis­  
claming every unfriendly inter.lion, and  
giving unequivocal proofs of an amicable  
disposition, cannot be expected to treat  
with another, whose conduct towards it has  
the direct effects of sctual hostility. If  
then, the enforcements of the {&#x27;resident’s  
prticlamation, up to the present moment, is  
a mvnsarc of self assumed reparation, it is  
directly repugnant to the spirit and fact of  
amicable neguciation ; if it is a measure to  
- compel reparation, it is equally so ; and by  
fho perseverance In it, Great Britain is  
dispensed with the duty of proffering re*  
dress. But if It ion measure of precaution,  
in order to secure reparation, or in or dvr  
to compel it, it falls under the objections I  
have jtut stated. If it is a precaution adop­  
ted as a guard against ac»s of violence ap­  
prehended un the part of h»a majesty’s na­  
val nffh Or*., it surelv cannot be considered  
as beinjr as cficUual a security as that ari*  
. eing from the renewed assurances of his  
majesty’s frhnrJJy disposition, which imply  
a due rbs&#x27;.rv • » e of the t ights of nations  
with which firr. Britain is in amity,  
by all persons holding authority under  
hrs majesty’s government, fr&lt; m the disa*  
roe v! jf the pretension of tiic search ol  
national rh.pt; ar.d from the further a**  
snrance of tl»»t dfstvownl, given in his ma«  
jfKly&#x27;s omr.lan.r tien of the Kith of October  
last; Neither under these concurrent civ­  
&#x27;i /  
  
cumstay ;es can the plea of necessity be  
maintained, and if such a proceeding has  
not the plea &quot;of necessity, it assumes the  
character of aggression. If these concurrent  
securities ugaiiiit such an apprehension  
have any va;ue, the necessity no longer ex­  
ists ; it they are ot no value, negneiation  
cannot De attempted, as the basis upon  
which it rests, the mutual confidence of the  
two parties, would be wholly wanting.  
From the moment after the unfortunate  
affair of the Chesapeake, that his majesty’s  
naval commanders, in these waters, had as­  
certained that they were safe from the ef­  
fervescences of that popular fury, under  
which the most glaring outrages were com­  
muted, and by which they’ were very&#x27; na­  
turally led to the supposition that they  
were objects of particular hostility, and  
that a state of war against them, requiring  
precautions on their part had commenced,  
no cnduct has been imputed to them, which  
could vindicate the necessity of maintain­  
ing in force the President’s proclamation.

‘ ■  
Being deeply impressed with the sense of bis  
majesty’s anxiety, that foil effort should be given to  
those views of justice and moderation, by which  
bis conduct has been regulated through the whole  
of the unfortunate transaction whence the present,  
differences have arisen&#x27;; and of the disappointment  
of which he would learn the frustration of his just  
and equitable purposes ; I.have fell it incumbent up­  
on me, on the receipt pf the letter, which you did  
SDe the honour to address to me on the fifth instant,  
to apply anew to this matter the most ample and  
serious conjuration. It is with the most paiulul  
sensationagByegret. tliat I find myself on the re­  
sult of it ufiler the necessity of declining to enter  
into the terms of negocialion, which by direction nt  
the president of the United States you therein offer.  
I do not feet myself competent in the present in­  
stance, to depart from those instructions, which 1  
Stated in my letter of the 26th January last, and  
  
which preclude me trom acceding to the condition  
thus proposed. I should add that I am absolutely  
prohibited from entering upon matters unconnected  
with the specifick object 1 am authorised to discuss,  
much less can 1 thus give any pledge concerning  
them. The condition suggested, moreover, leads  
to the direct inference, that the&#x27;proclamation of  
the president of the United States, of the 2d July,  
2807, is maintained either as an equivalent for re  
partition for the time being, or as a compulsion to  
make it.  
It is with the more profound regret that I feel  
myself under the necessity of declaring, that I am  
unable toactnpon the terms thus proposed, as it  
becomes my duty to inform you, in conformity to  
my instructions, that on the rejection of the de­  
mand stated in my former letter, on the part of his  
majesty, my mission is terminated. And as his  
majesty’s government in providing me with those  
instructions, did not conceive that alter the decla­  
ration of his sentiments respecting the affair of the  
Chesapeake was made known to tins government,  
|he state of any transactions pending or untrrmina  
led between the two nations could justify the per­  
severance in the enforcement of the president’s pro­  
clamation, I ran exercise no discretion on this  
point. ^ &#x27;  
As on a former occasion I detailed, though mi­  
nutely, the motives for that demand on the part of  
Isis majesty, which 1 with so much concern learn  
to be deemed inadmissible by the government of the  
llnited Slates, I should here abstain from an expo­  
sition of them, which visibly can have no further  
effect upon the neguciation, if I did not deem it es­  
sential that they should not he left under any mis­  
apprehension which I might be able to remote. 1  
shall, therefore, take a short review of the transac­  
tion, which has given rise to these discussions, in  
order the more correctly to determine the sound­  
\ ness of the principle on which that demand is made.  
* -e Certain deserters front his majesty’s navy, many  
.of them Ins natural born subjects, having euiered  
into the service of the United States, were repeat­  
edly and fruitlessly demanded by the British nrticers,  
of the recruiting officers of the United States, but  
were retained in their new service. As it was a  
matter of notoriety that several of these deserters  
were on hoard the frigate of the United States the  
Chesapeake, they were demanded of that frigate on  
the high seas by his majesty’s ship Leopard, and  
all knowledge of their presence on board bung de­  
nied, she was attacked and four of them, one avow­  
edly a native Englishman, were taken nut of her.  
Without being deterred by the consideration of how  
j far circumstances hostile in their nature had pro­  
P yoked, though they undoubtedly by no means justi­  
fied this act of the British officer, his majesty’s go­  
vernment directed, that a positive disavowal of the  
Tight of search asserted in this case, and of the act  
j&gt;( the British officer as being unauthorized, and a  
promise of reparation, should be conveyed to the  
American minister in London, before he had made  
any representation by order of the United States.  
This disavowal made on the 2d of August last, was  
transmitted by him to his government, before the  
6th of that month. But before Mr. Monroe had  
.received his orders to demand reparation, his ma­  
lparnt. with whnt tnrnnta if iu  
  
dwell upon, that the president of the United States  
. had interdicted by proclamation, hearing date the  
SdofJuly, 1807, the entry of all their ports to the&#x27;  
&#x27;whole of his navy. This surprize was certainly in­  
creased, when in the letter delivered by that minis­  
ter to require redress for the wrong, although it  
went into details unconnected with it, not only no  
concern was expressed on the part of the United  
States, at having felt themselves compelled to enact  
measures of so much injury and indignity towards a  
.friendly power, but no mention was made of the  
causes of such measures being resorted to, or even  
hf the fact of their having been adopted. In addi­  
tion to the embarrassment arising from these cir­  
cumstances, and the insufficiency of the explanati­  
ons subsequently given to Mr. Canning, the intro­  
duction of a subject foreign to that of the complaint  
trecanie the main impediment to the success of the  
discussions which took place in London. When 1  
had the honour to open the negotiation with you,  
Sir, as I had learnt the president&#x27;s proclamation  
was still in force, it became my duty, conformably  
to my instructions, to require its recall as a preli­  
minary to further discussion : had it not been in  
force, I was not ordered to buve takeu it into con­  
sideration in the adjustment of reparation: and it  
was considered as hardly possible that it should not  
have been recalled immediately upon the knowledge  
®f bis majesty&#x27;s disavowal of&#x27; the attack upon the  
Chesapeake, as an unauthorized act. But his ma­  
jesty could not suffer the negociation to he carried  
On, on his behalf, under an interdict, which even  
if justifiable iu the first moment of irritation, can­  
not be continued after the declaration of his majes­  
ty’s sentiments upon the transaction, except in a  
•pirit of hostility.  
It might have been fairly contended, that in the  
first instance, the exercise of such an act of power,  
before reparation was refuged or unduly protracted!  
Was incompatible with the purposes and essence of  
pacifick negotiation, and with a demand of redress  
through that channel; but such have been his ma­  
jesty’s conciliatory view*, that this argument bas  
not been insisted on, altboagh it might now be the  
more forcibly urged as it appears that the govern­  
&#x27;tneot of the United States was from the first sensi­  
ble that, even had hostility been meditated by the  
.^British government, it would not have rommenced  
U in such a manner. But the exception taken, is  
w» the enforcement continued up t&lt;&gt; (lie present time,  
«f measures highly unfriendly in their tendency!  
  
i persisted in, not only otter tire dwovowof in qtretti*  
on ; the promise of the proffer of suitable repara­  
tion, and the renewed assurances of his majesty&#x27;s  
amicable dispositions, but, after security has been  
given in a publick instrument bearing date the l6lh  
Oct. 1807, that the claim to the seizure of deser­  
| ters from the national snips of other powers, cannot  
again be brought forward by bis majesty&#x27;s naval of  
| ticers, it is unnecessary to dwell upon the injury  
and indignity to which Ins majesty&#x27;s service is ex­  
posed, both as touching the freedom and security oi  
correspondence of his agents, and accredited minis­  
ters in tlie United Slates, or as&#x27; resulting from a  
measure, wdnrh in time of war, excludes the whole  
of bis navy from all their ports ; which ports are  
&lt; oinpletely open to the fleets of his enemies. It will  
lie sufficient to observe, that even where exempti­  
ons from it are granted, they are made subject to  
■-urh conditions, that of the three last British ships  
•I war, which have entered these ports upon pub­  
iirk business, two of them, his majesty’s ship Sta­  
tirn, having on board a minister sent out for tbe  
adjustment of the present differences, and a schoo­  
ner bearing despatches, m consequence of then in­  
ibility to procure pilots, were obliged to enter these  
waters without such assistance, and were exposed  
to considerable danger. Great Britain by the forms  
established, could repair the wrongs committed, e­  
ven to the satisfaction of the United States no o­  
therwise than by tbe channel of negotiation ; yet  
she avowed distinctly, that a wrong was committed,  
and that she was ready to make reparation for it ;  
it cannot therefore be contended, that the unavoida­  
ble delay of actual reparation, subjected her to the  
imputation of persisting in an aggression, which  
was disclaimed from the first; if this be true, how­  
ever much she will regret any impediment in the  
adjustment of a difference, in which tbe feelings of  
this nation are so materially interested, can she  
consistently with a due care of her own honour and  
interests, allow it to be concluded on her part under  
an adherence to a conduct, which has a decided cha­  
  
raster ol enmity m the proceedings held towards her  
l&gt;y the other party.  
I know not in what view the perseverance in the  
president’s proclamation, up to this moment, can be  
considered, but in that of a measure of retaliation^  
or of sell assumed reparatiou ; or as a measure in­  
tended to compel reparation ; unless it fce thut  
which, if 1 rightly understand, you define it to be,  
a measure of precaution.  
If, when a wrong is committed, retaliation is in­  
stantly resorted to by the injured party, the door to  
panfick adjustment is closed, and the means of con­  
ciliation are precluded. The right to demand repa­  
ration is incompatible with the assumption of it.—  
When parties are in a slate of mutual hostility,  
they are so fur on a footing, and as such they may  
treat j but a parly disclaiming every unfriendly in­  
tention, and giving unequivocal proofs of an ami­  
cable disposition, cannot be expected to treat with  
another, whose conduct towards it has the direct  
effects of actual hostility. If then, the enforcement  
of the president’s proclamation up to the present  
moment, is a measure of self-assumed reparation,  
it is directly repugnent to the spirit and fact of ami­  
cable negotiation ; if it is a measure to compel re­  
paration, it is equally so ; and by the perseverance  
in it, Great britaiu is dispensed with the duty of  
proffering redress. But if it is a measure of pre­  
caution, in order to procure reparation, or in order  
to compel it, it falls under the objections 1 have  
just stated. If it is a precaution adopted as a guard  
against acts of violence apprehended on the part of  
his majesty’s naval officers, it surely cannot be con­  
sidered as eflectual a security as that arising from  
the renewed assurances of his majesty’s friendly  
opposition, which imply a due observance of the  
rights of nations with which Great Britain is in a­  
mity, by all the persons holding authority under  
Ins majesty’s government, from the disavowal of  
the preleuimn of the right of search of national  
ships ; and from the further assurance of that disa­  
vowal, given in his majesty’s proclamation of the  
l6’th of October last: Neither under these concur­  
rent circumstances can the plea of necessity be  
maintained, and if such a proceeding has not the  
plea of necessity, it assumes the character of ag­  
  
girsnuii. 11 uiese concurrent securities against  
such an apprehension have any value the necessity  
no longer exists ; if they are of no value, negotia­  
tion cannot be attempted, as the basis upon which  
it rests, the mutual confidence of the two parties  
would be wholly wanting.  
From the moment after the unfortunate affair of  
the Chesapeake, that his majesty’s naval comman­  
ders, in these waters, had ascertained that they  
were safe from the efferverscence of that popular fu­  
ry, under which the most glaring outrages were  
committed, and by which they were very naturally  
led to the supposition that they were objects of parti­  
cular hostility, and that a state of war against them  
requiring precautions on their part, had commenc­  
ed, no conduct has been imputed to them which  
could vindicate the necessity of maintaining in  
force the president’s proclamation. Since that time  
such of those officers as have been necessitated by  
the circumstances of the war to remain in these wa­  
ters, have held no communication with the shore,  
except in an instance two trifling to dwell upon, and  
instantly disavowed by the commanding officer;  
and they have acquiesced quietly in various  
privations, highly prejudicial to the service they  
were upon, and in consequence of an interdict,  
which bad they been regardless of their duties to­  
wards a state, iu amity with their sovereign, and  
had they not carefully repressed the feelings its tone  
and language bad a direct tendency to provoke in  
them would have rather excited, than have averted  
the evils it was stated to be intended to prevent;  
were they regardful of these duties, it was unneces­  
sary. Had they felt themselves obliged completely  
to evacuate the waters of the United States, espe­  
cially whilst an enemy’s squadron was baiboured in  
them, they could have done it but under the admis­  
sion of hostile compulsion, and under such compul­  
sion, carried into full effect, his majesty could not  
have dissembled the extent of the injury received.  
In the several cases adduced, in which Great Bri­  
tain required certain preliminaries, previously to  
entering into negociation, she regulated her conduct  
hy the same principles to which she now adheres ;  
and refused, whilst no hostility was exhibited on  
her part, to treat with powers, whose proceedings  
denoted it towards her : and who maintained their  
right in what they had assumed.  
From the considerations thus offered, I trust that  
neither the order of reason, or that of usage, are  
m contradiction to the demand I have urged, nor  
I aware bow the order of time opposes the re­  
  
vocation in the first instance, of that&#x27;art, which  
affects injuriously one of the parties, and is stilt a­  
vowed by the other.  
it The subject is thus presented to you, sir, in the  
light in which it was natural that it should offer it­  
self to his mejesty’s government. It certainly con­  
ceived the president&#x27;s proclamation to rest chiefly,  
and most materially upon the attack made upon the  
frigate of the United States, the Chesapeake, by bis  
majesty’s ship Leopard, although other topics were  
adduced as accessories, in this apprehension it  
may beheld to have been sufficiently warranted, by  
tbe precise time at which, and the circumstances  
under which, it was issued, and by its whole con­  
text ; and tbe more so, as the impulse under which  
it was drawn up appears to have been so sudden as  
to have precluded a due examination of all the  
grounds of allegation contained iu it. And here I  
beg leave to assure you, that with respect to the  
spirit, and tone of that instrument, it would be  
highly satisfactory to me, if I could feel myself jus­  
tified in expressing on the part of his majesty, any  
degree of coincidence with the opinions you have  
announced, nr when thus appealed to, and making  
every allowance for the irritation of the moment, 1  
could dissemble the extreme surprise experienced  
by Great Britain, that the government of a friendly  
nation, even before an amicable demand of reparati­  
on was made ; and yet meaning to make that de­  
mand ; should have issued an edict directing mea­  
sures of injury very disproportionate to what it knew  
was an unauthorised offence, and both in its terms  
and its purport so injurious to the government to  
which that demand was to be addressed, and tend­  
ing to call forth in both nations the feelings under  
which a friendly adjustment would be the most dif­  
ficult. But if, as 1 learn from you, sir, the procla­  
mation rests substantially on other causes, it ts then  
peculiarly to be regretted, that together with the  
demand for redress made in September last, the go­  
vernment of the United States did not think tit to  
offer a negotiation, or an explanation of so tnotnen­  
  
mua a uieciauie, ui iu utiidie llliil US recall must De  
more or less connected with the adjustment of other  
alledged wrongs. Neither did it think it necessary  
to return any answer to the remonstrance given by  
his majesty&#x27;s envoy at Washington, on the 13th Ju­  
ly, 1807, in which he represented “ that he con­  
sidered that interdiction to be so unfriendly in its  
object, and so injurious in its consequences to his  
majesty’s interests, that he could not retrain from  
expressing the most sincere icgret, that it ever  
should have been issued, and most earnestly depre­  
cating its being enforced.”  
It could not be supposed that a circumstance of  
so great weight could be oveilooked by his majes­  
ty’s government, in determining the line of conduct  
to be held in the negot iation ; and as little could it  
he expected to pass it over, when on the failure of  
the discussion with Mr. Monroe, it directed a spe­  
cial mission to he sent to the United States, it  
had the less reason to imagine that any other griev­  
ances could he connected with that, lor the adjust­  
ment of which 1 am empowered to negociute, as  
Mr. Monroe, in his letter to Mr. Canning ot the  
29th of July last, had stated with respect to other  
subjects of remonstrance that it was improper to  
mingle them with the present more serious cause of  
complaint; an opinion to which Mr. Canning de­  
clared his perfect assent in his letter to that minis­  
ter of the second ot the subsequent month ; so that  
this act was left as single and distinct, to be singly  
and distinctly considered. His majesty&#x27;s govern­  
ment, therefore, could not consistently with any  
view of the subject then before it, or indeed who  
the just object of my mission, direct or empower  
me to enter upon matters not connected with that  
of the Chesapeake ; and they rould with the less  
propriety do 11, asiu ordet to render the adjustment  
of ditfereuces of such a nature, the more easy and  
the more conspicuous, the ministers charged espe­  
cially with such othces have been, with few if any  
exceptions restricted to the precise afl&#x27;ait to be nego­  
ciated. With respect therefore to those other cau­  
ses of complaint, upon which you inform me that  
the president&#x27;s proclamation rests, 1 cannot be fur­  
nished with documents enabling me either to admit  
or to controvert those sentiments ol grievance, fo­  
reign to the attack upon that ship, contained in  
your letter, or authorized to discuss the matters  
  
HJCUJOCI &gt; CD.  
k oiiaii iijcicjurt* not allow mybelt lo  
offer such comments as my personal knowledge ot  
some of those transactions suggest to me, although  
their tendency would materially affect both the  
marked mannner in which those transactions are  
pourtrayed, and the disadvantageous lights in  
which his majesty&#x27;s government is represented to  
have acted respecting them. I am moreover led to  
the persuasion that my government will be the  
more easily able to rescue itself from inculpation, by  
the inference arising from passages in Mr. Monroe’s  
letter to Mr. Secretary Canning, of the 2yth Sep  
leather last, that the differences unhappily existing  
between the two nations were in a tram ol adjust­  
ment.  
If his majesty has not permitted me to enter in­  
to the discussiou of the search of neutral merchant  
ships lor British seamen, together with the adjust­  
ment of the amount of reparation for the attack up­  
on the Chesapeake ; it was no wise with a view of  
precluding the further agitation of the question at a  
suitable time : but it was that thenegocialion might  
be relieved from the embarrassments arising from  
the connection of the present matter with the one  
so foreign to it, and as it was but too well known,  
so difficult to be adjusted of a right distinctly dis­  
claimed, with one which Great-Britain has at all  
times asserted of enforcing her claim to the service  
of her natural born subjects, when found on board  
of merchant vessels of other nations; a claim which  
she founds upun that principle of universal law,  
which gives to the state the right of requiring the  
aid and assistance of her native citizens. The re­  
currence, therefore, to that course of negotiation,  
which has been originally settled between Mr. Se­  
cretary Canning and Mr. Monroe, and which had  
been alone broken in upon by orders subsequently  
received by that minister, ran only be consulted  
as a resumption of that course of things which  
Great-Britain strenuously contended their was no  
ground to depart from. I may observe that this  
purpose might have been effected without the inter­  
vention of a special minister.  
It will be in youi recollection, sir, that in you.  
first mtei view, I stated the condition, which m ik  
the subject bf the present letter, before 1 was in  
formed by you, that the piesident of the Unit..  
States would coaMfrto the separation of the lw.  
subjects.  
I had trusted that the exposition, which I added  
  
m niy letter of the 26th January fo tl.r vprt al ex­  
planation I had before ottered, oi the grounds ol his  
majesty’s demand, was both in its ptn port, and in  
the terms in which it was coach&#x27; d, stu b as to pre­  
yeut a suspicion that they were in their intention  
derogatory to the honour, or calculated to wound  
the just sensibility of this nation, i may udd.tiiat  
such a supposition could not be reconciled with the  
various .ostensible and unequivocal demonstrations  
of bis majesty&#x27;s good faith and anxiety, that this  
transaction should -be brought to an amicable ter­  
mination, which were exhibited even prior to any  
remonstrances on the part, or by order of this go­  
vernment. The other topicks which I felt myself  
authorized to advance in that letter, in illustration  
of that amicable disposition on the part of the king,  
were brought forward Iroin the conviction I enter­  
tained that they most be of a nature to be satisfac­  
tory to this government, and therefore, such as it  
was particularly my duty to enforce; but not with  
a view to rest upon them the right to advance tbs  
claim which I have staled.  
I may here remark, it is obvious that far from  
requiring that the tiiststep towards an arrangement  
of reparation should be taken by the United State*  
Great-Britain has already made them openly and  
distinctly ; they are indubitable testimonies to tlm  
respect home and decidedly marked by Greal-Bri­  
tain, to the ties of amity subsisting between the  
two nations, and of her cordial desire to maintain  
them unimpaiied, and as such alone they were ur­  
ged.  
As his majesty would have deriv&#x27;d sincere satis­  
faction from the evidence of corresponding leeling*  
on the part ol the United Slates so it would ha  
more paintul to rnp to dwell upon a series of insults  
and menaces which, without any piovocation of  
warlike preparation on the part ol Gieat Britain,  
have been for months accumulated upon her through  
the United States, and but two Ireqnently from  
quarters whose authority necessarily and powerful­  
ly commanded attention.  
  
I ought, perhaps, to apologize for adverting to  
an incidental expression in your letter, if I did not  
think it right to remove any ambiguity respecting  
the n ature of the claim which Great Britain main*  
tained to her seamen, native citizens of the realm,  
who have deserted irom her service to that of other  
powers : it is, that on demand they shull he forth­  
with, and, consequently they shall instantly be treed  
from their newly contracted obligations.  
Before I close this letter, allow me to State to  
you, sir, that i have felt it my duty to transmit to  
his majesty’s government, the exposition contained  
in your letter ol the 5th instant, ol the various de­  
mands on the honour and good lailh ol Great Bri­  
tain, on which the complaint is made, that satisfac­  
tion has not been afforded to the Unitid States, and  
on which cwiijo inly with the affair of the Chesa­  
peake, you inform me that the proclamation of the  
president of the United States of the second ot Ju­  
ly, is founded. It will be for his majesty’s govern­  
ment to determine on the pail ol Great Britain,  
whether any and what obligations remain to he ful­  
filled by her. Whether any denial, or such protrac­  
tion of redress have net-lined on her part, as to  
render necessary or justifiable the perseverance in  
an edict, which, when not necessary or justifiable,  
assumes a ch irartei of aggiession : and whether on  
the result of those considerations, the present nego­  
tiation can be resumed on the part of his majesty,  
with a due regard tor his own h nour, or wnh n  
piospect of a more succ-essiul termination.  
I have the honour to lie,  
With the highest consideration, sir,

Washington, March 17th, 1808.  
SIR,  
Being deeply impressed with the sense  
of his majesty’s anxiety, that full effect  
should be given to those views of justice and  
moderation, by which his conduct has been  
regulated through the whole of the unfortu­  
nate transaction, w hence the present differ­  
ences have arisen ; and of the disappoint­  
ment with which he would learn the frustra­  
tion of his just and equitable purposes; I have  
felt it incumbent upon me, on the receipt of  
the letter which you did me the honor to ad­  
dress to me on the 5th inst. to apply to this  
matter the most ample and serious considera­  
tion. .It is with the most painful sensations  
of regret, that I find myself on the result of  
it, under the necessity of declining to enter  
into the terms of negotiation, which by di­  
rection of the President of the United States,  
you therein offer. 1 do not feel myself com­  
petent, in the present instance, to depart  
from those instructions, which I stated in  
my letter of the 2Cth of January last, and  
which preclude me from acceding to the con­  
dition thus proposed.&#x27;  
I should add, that I am absolutely prohi­  
bited from enteringupon matters unconnect­  
ed with the specific object I am authorized  
to discuss, much less can 1 thus give any  
pledge concerning them. The condition sug­  
gested, moreover, leads to the direct infer­  
ence, that the proclamation of the .President  
of the United States of the 2nd of July, J8vr,  
is maintained either as an equivalent for re­  
paration for the time being, or as a compulsi­  
on to make it. • \
  
It is with the more profound regret, that I  
feel myself under the necsssity of declaring,  
that 1 am unable to act upon the terms thus  
proposed ; as it becomes my duty to inform  
you, in conformity to my instructions, that  
on the rejection of the demand stated in my  
! former letter, on the part of his majesty, my  
mission is terminated.—And as his majesty’s  
government in providing me with those in­  
structions, did not conceive that after the  
declaration of his sentiments respecting the  
affair of the Chesapeake was made known  
to this government, the state of any transac­  
tions pending or unterminated between the  
two nations, couid justify the perseverance  
in the enforcement of the President’s proc­  
lamation. 1 can exercise no discretion on  
this point.  
As on a former occasion I detailed, though  
minutely, the motives for that demand, on  
the part of his majesty, which I, with so much  
concern, learn to he deemed inadmissible by  
the government of the United States, I should  
here abstain from 411 exposition of them  
whioh visibly can have no further effect up­  
on the negociation, if I did not deem it es­  
sential that they should net be left under a­  
ny misapprehension, which 1 might be able  
to remove. I shall therefore take a short  
review of the transaction which has given  
rise to these discussions, in order the more  
correctly to determine the soundness of  
the principles upon which that demand is  
made. . .  
Certain deserters from his majesty’s navy,  
many of them his natural born subjects, ha­  
ving entered into the service of the U. States  
were repeatedly and fruitlessly demanded  
by the British officers, of the recruiting offi­  
cers of the U. States ; but were retained in  
their new service. As it was a matter of­  
notoriety that several of these deserters&#x27;  
were on board the frigate of the U. States,I  
the Chesapeake, they were demanded of!  
that frigate on the high seas, by his majes­  
ty’s ship Leopard, and all knowledge of their  
presence on board being denied, she was at­  
tacked, and four of them, one avowedly a  
native Englishman, were taken out of her.  
Without being deterred bv the considerati­  
on of how far circumstances hostile in their  
nature, had provoked, though they undoubt- !  
cdly by no means justified, this act of the  
British officer, his majesty’s government di­  
rected that a positive disavowal of the right  
of search asset ted in this case; and of the I  
act of the British officer, as being unautho- j  
tired; and a promise of reparation, should!  
be conveyed to the American minister in Lon- J  
don, before he had made any representation  
by order of the U. S.  
1 hi., disavowal made on th-e second of An-!  
gust last, was transmitted by him to his go-!  
vernment, before It he sixth of that month  
1—but before Mr. Monroe had received His j  
orders to demand reparation, his majesty!  
lie irnt, with what surprize il is needless to!  
dwell upon, that the President of the Uni-.  
ted States had interdicted by proclamation,&#x27;  
j bearing &#x27;late the 2d of July, 1807, toe entry t  
1 all their ports to the whole of his navy ;•  
| this ui prise was certainly cncrc-’sed, when,  
I in tin- letter delivered fry that minister, to!  
I require redtess for the wrong, although it)  
| wont into details unconnected with it; not!  
■oiilj. (10 concern was expressed on the part  
  
of the United States, at having felt them­  
selves compelled to enact measures of so  
much injury and indignity towards a friend­  
ly power; byt no mention was made of the  
causes of such measures being resorted to, or  
even of the fact of their, having been adopt­  
ed. Iy addition to the embarrassment ari­  
sing from these circumstances, and the in­  
sufficiency of the explanations subsequently  
given to Mr. Canning; the introduction of a  
subject foreign to that of the complaint, be­  
cause the main impediment to the success  
of the discussion which took place in Lon­  
don. When I had the honor to open the ne­  
gociation with yon, sir, as I had learnt that  
the President’s Proclamation was still in  
force, it became my duty conformably to my  
instructions, to require its recall, as a preli­  
minary to further discussion ; had it not been  
in force, I was not ordered to have taken it  
into consideration in the adjustment of repa­  
ration ; and it was considered as hardly pos­  
sible, that it should not have been recalled,  
immediately upon the knowledge of his ma­  
jesty’s disavowal of the attack upon the Che­  
sapeake, as an unauthorised act.—But his  
majesty could not suffer the negociation to be  
carried on, on his behalf, under an interdict,  
which, even if justifiable in the first moment  
of irritation, cannot be continued after the  
declaration of his majesty’s sentiments up­  
on the transactions, except in a spirit of hos­  
  
umy.  
It might have been fairly contended, that  
in the first instance, the exercise of such an  
act of power, before reparation was refused  
or unduly protracted, was incompatible  
with the purposes and essence of pacific ne­  
gociation, and with a demand of redress  
through that channel; but such have been  
his majesty’s conciliatory views, that this  
argument has not been insisted on, although  
it might now be the more forcibly urged, as  
it appears that the government of the U. S.  
was from the first tfilsible that even had  
hostility been meditated by the British go­  
vernment, it would not have commenced it  
in such a manner. But the exception taken,  
is to the enforcement continued up to the  
present time, of measures highly unfriendly  
in their tendency, persisted in, not only af­  
ter the disavowal in question, the promise  
of the proffer of suitable reparation, and  
the renewed assurances of his majesty’s a­  
micable dispositions, but, after security has  
been given in a public instrument bearing  
date the 16th of October, 1807, that the claim  
to the seizure of the deserters from the na­  
tional ships of other powers, cannot aguin be  
brought forward by lus majesty’s naval offi­  
cers, it is unnecessary to dwell upon the in­  
jury and indignity to which his majesty’s  
service is exposed, both as touching the free­  
dom and security of correspondence of his  
agents, and accredited ministers in the U.  
states, or as resulting from a measure,  
which in time of war, excludes the whole of  
his navy from all their ports ; which ports  
are completely open to the fleets of his ene­  
mies. It wilf be sufficient to observe, that e­  
veu where exemptions from it are granted,  
they are made subject to such conditions,  
that of the three last British ships of war,  
which have entered these ports upon public  
business, two of them, his majesty’s ship Sta­  
tira, having onboard a minister sent out for  
the adjustment of the present differences,  
and a schooner bearing dispatches, in conse­  
quence of their inability to procure pilots,  
were obliged to enter their waters without  
such assistance, and were exposed to consi­  
  
aeraDie danger. oreat-Britam, by the forms  
established, could repair the wrongs commit­  
ted, even to the satisfaction of the United  
States, no otherwise than by the channel of  
negociation ; yet she avowed distinctly, that  
a wrong was committed, and that she was  
ready to make reparation for it; it cannot  
therefore be contended, that the unavoida­  
ble delay of actual reparation, subjected her  
to the imputation of persisting in an aggres­  
sion, which was disclaimed from the first ; if  
this is true, however much she will regret any  
impediment in the adjustment of a difference,  
in which the feelings of this nation are so  
materially interested, can she consistently  
with a due care of her own honor and inte­  
rests, allow it to be concluded on her part un­  
der an adherence to a conduct, which has a  
decided character of enmity in the proceed­  
ings held towards her by the other party.  
I know not in what view the perseverance  
in the President’s proclamation, up to this  
moment, can be considered, but in that of a  
measure of retaliation ; or of self assu­  
med reparation ; or a measure intended to  
compel reparation ; unless it be that which,  
if I rightly understand, you define it to be,  
a measure of precaution.  
If when a wrong is committed, retaliation is  
instantly resorted toby the injured party, the  
door to pacific adjustment is closed, and the  
means of conciliation are precluded. The  
right to demand reparation is incompatible  
with the assumption of it. When parties are  
in a state of mutual hostility, they are so  
far on a footing, and as such they may treat:  
But a party disclaiming every unfriendly in­  
tention, and giving unequivocal proofs of an  
amicable disposition, cannot be expected to  
treat with another whose conduct towards it  
lias the direct effects of actual hostility. If  
then, the enforcement of the President&#x27;s pro­  
clamation, up to the present moment, is a  
measure of self assumed reparation, it is di­  
rertly repugnant to the spirit and fact of a­  
micable negociation ; if it is a measure to  
compel reparation, it is equally so; and by  
the perseverance in it. Great Britain is dis­  
pensed with the duty of proffering redress._  
But it&#x27;it is a measure of precaution, in order  
to secure reparation, or in order to compel it,!  
it falls under the objections I have just sta- &#x27;  
ted. If it is a precaution adopted as a guard \
against acts of violence apprehended «n the  
part of his majesty’s naval officers, it sure- 1  
Iy cannot be considered as being a«j effectual  
a security as that arising from the renewed  
assurances ot his majesty’s friendly dispositi­  
on, which imply a due observance of the  
rights of nations with which Great Britain is  
in amity, by all persons holding authority un­  
der his majesty’s government, from the dis­  
avowal of the pretension of the search of na­  
tional ships ; arid from the further assurance  
ot that disavowal, given in his majesty&#x27;s pro­  
clamation of the 16th October last; Neither  
under these concurrent circumstances can  
the plea of necessity fie maintained, and if  
such proceeding has&#x27;act the pica of necessity,  
  
it assumes the. character of aggression. If  
these concurrent securities against such an  
apprehension have any. value, the necessity  
no longer exists; if they are of no value,  
ncgociation cannot be attempted, as the basis  
&quot;ch it rests, the mutual confidence  
parties, would be wholly want­  
ing  
From the moment after the unfortunate  
affair of the Chesapeake, that his majesty’s  
, naval commanders, in these waters, had as­  
1 certained that they were safe from the cf­  
j fervescenses of that popular fury : under  
• which the most glaring outrages were com  
mitted, and by which they were very natu­  
rally led to the supposition that they were  
j objects of particular hostility, anil that  
a state of war against them, requiring pre­  
[ cautions on their part had comitienced, no  
[conduct has beenj imputed to them, which  
could vindicate the necessity of maintaining in  
force the Presideut’s proclamation.  
Since that time such of those officers as  
have been necessitated by the circumstances  
of the war to remain in these waters, have  
held no communication with the shore, ex­  
cept in an instance too trifling to dwell upon,  
and instantly disavowed by the commanding  
  
umuer, ana tney r.ave acquiesced quietly in  
, various privations, highly prejudicial to the  
i service they were upon, and in consequence  
icf an interdict, which had they been re­  
| gardlessof their duties towards a state in a­  
Imity with their sovereign, and had they not  
caretully redressed the feelings its tone and  
language had a direct tendency to provoke in  
them, would have rather excited, than have  
averted the evils it was stated to be intend­  
ed to prevent; were they regardful of these  
duties, it was unnecessary. Had they felt  
themselves obligated completely to evacuate  
the waters of the United States, especially  
whilst a,n enemy’s squadron was harbored in  
them, they could have dope it; but under  
the admission of hostile compulsion, and un­  
der such compulsion, carried into full effect,  
his majesty could not have dissembled the  
extent of the injury received.  
In the several cases adduced, in which  
- Great-Rritain required certain prelimi­  
[ naries, previously to entering into nego­  
ciatien. she regulated her conduct by the  
same principles to which she now adheres,  
and refused, whilst no hostility was exhibit­  
ed on her part, to treat with powers, whose  
proceedings denoted it towards her; and  
who maintained their right in what they had  
assumed. * _, ,•  
From the considerations thus offered, I  
trust that neither t^e r*rdpr r\f r&lt;»asnn nrtha*  
of usage are in contradiction to the demand  
I have urged, nor am I aware how the order  
of time opposes the revocation in the first  
instance of that act, which affects injurious­  
ly one of the parties and is still avowed by  
the other.&#x27; ... . .  
The subject is thus presented to you, sir,  
in the light which it was natural that it  
should offer itself to his majesty’s gov­  
ernment. It certainly conceived the Pre­  
sident’s proclamation to rest chiefly,, aud  
most materially upon the attack made upon  
the frigate of the U. States, the Chesapeake,  
by his majesty’s ship, the Leopard, although  
other topics were adduced as accessories._  
In this apprehension it may be held to have  
been sufficiently warranted, by the precise  
time at which, .and. the circumstances un­  
der which it was issued, and by its whole  
context, and the rhore so, as the impulse un­  
der which it was drawn up, appears to have  
  
-—— Mi4v»v«vi&lt; uavc picuuucu a uue  
examination of all the grounds of allegation  
contained in it. And here I beg leave to as­  
sure you, that with respect to the spirit and  
tone of that instrument, it would be highly  
satisfactory to me, if I could feel myself jus­  
tified in expressing on the part of his ma­  
jesty and degree of coincidence with the o­  
pinions you have announced, or when thus  
appealed to, and making every allowance  
for. the irritation of the moment,. I could  
dissemble the extreme surprize experienced  
by Great Britain, that the government of a  
friendly nation, even- before an amicable de­  
mand of reparation made, and yet meaning  
to make that demand, should have issued an  
edict directing measures of injury very dis­  
proportionate to what it knew, was an unau­  
thorized offence, and both in its terms and  
its purport so injurious to the government to  
which that demand was to be addressed, &amp;  
tending to call forth in both nations, the feel­  
ings under which a friendly adjustment  
would be the most difficult. But if, as I learn  
from you, sir, the proclamation rests sub­  
stantially on other causes, it is then, pecu­  
liarly to be regretted, that, together with  
the demand for redress made in September  
last, the government of the U. States did not  
think fit to offer a negociation, or an expla­  
nation of so momentous a measure, or to  
declare that its recall must be more or less  
connected with the adjustment of other al­  
ledged wrongs. . Neither did it think it ne­  
ccssai7 to return any answer to return any  
answer tuthe remonstrance given in by bis  
majesty’s envoy at Washington, on the 13th *  
July, 1807, in which he represented “ that I  
he considered that interdiction to be so un- &#x27;  
friendly in its object, and so injurio is in its  
consequences to his majesty’s interests, that 1  
he could not refrain from expressing the  
most sincere regret that it ever should have i  
been issued, and most earnestly deprecating  
its being enforced.”  
It couM not be supposed that a circum­  
stance of so great weight could be overlooked  
by his majesty’s government, in determin­  
ing the line of conduct to be held in the ne­  
gotiation : and as little could it be expected  
to pass it ovcf, when on the failure of the  
discussion with Mr. Monroe, it directed a  
special mission to be sent to the U. States.—  
It had the less reason to imagine that any }  
other grievances could be connected with ;  
that for the adjustment of which I ain cm­  
powered to negoefate, as Mr. Monroe, in hi*, 1  
letter to Mr. Canning of the 29th of July last |  
had stated with respect to other subjects of  
remonstrance, that it wss improper to min- !  
gle them with the present more serioui  
cause of complaint; an opinion to winch  
Mr. Canning declared his perfect assent in  
his letter to that minister of the 2d of the  
subsequent month ; so that this act was left  
as single and distinct, to be singly and dis­  
tinctly considered. His majesty’s govern­  
I ment, therefore, could not consistently with  
any view of tba aubject then before it, or in­  
  
i deed with the just object of my mission, di­  
I rect or empower me to enter &quot;upon matters  
; not connecied with that of the Chesapeake ,  
| and they could with the less propriety do it,  
in order to render the adjustment of d.i  
lerences of such a nature, the more easy 6c  
the more conspicuous, the ministers charged  
especially with such offices have been with  
, few if any exceptions, restricted to the pre­  
cise affair to be negociated. With-respect  
i therefore to those other causes of complaint,  
upon which you inform me that the Presi­  
dent’s proclamation rests, I cannot be fur  
j nished with documents enabling me either  
f to admit or to controvert those statements of  
grievances, foreign to the attack upon that  
ship, contained in your letter, or authorised to  
discuss the matters themselves. 1 shall there­  
fore not allow myself to offer such comments  
as my personal knowledge of some of those  
transactions suggests to me, although their  
tendency would materially affect both the  
marked manner in which tho«e transactions  
are pourrrayed, and the disadvantageous  
lights in which his majesty’s government is  
represented to have acted respecting them.  
1 am moreover led to the persuasion that my  
government will he the more easily able to  
rescue itself from inculpation, by the infer­  
ence arising from passages in Mr. Monroe’s  
letter to Mr. Secretary Canning, of the 29th  
of .September last, that the differences un­  
happily existing between the two nations  
were in a train of adjustment.  
  
** iiicijcavy uaa nut permiucc metoen*  
ter into the discussion of the search of neu­  
tral merchant..ships for British seamen, to­  
gether with the adjustment ot the amount  
of reparation for the attack upon the Che­  
sapeake ; it was no-wise with a -view of ore­  
eluding the further agitation of that ques­  
tion at a suitable time; but it was that the  
negotiation might.be relieved from the em­  
barrassment arisng from the connection of  
the. present matter, with the one so foreign  
to it, and, as it was but too well known, so  
difficult to be adjusted, of a right distinctly  
disclaimed, with one which Great Britain  
has at all times asserted of enforcing her  
claim, to the services of her natural born  
subjects, when found on board merchant  
.vessels of other nations ; a claim which she  
founds in that principle of universal law,  
which gives to the state the right of requir­  
ing the aid and assistance of her native ci­  
tizens. The recurrence therefore,. to that  
course cf negociatton, which had been ori­  
ginally settled between Mr. Secretary Can­  
ning Sc Mr; Monroe, and which had been a­  
lone broken in upon by the orders subsequent  
lv received by .that minister, only can be con­  
sidered as a resumption of that course of  
things which Great Britain strenuously con­  
tended there was no ground to depart* from.  
I may observe, that this purpose might have  
been effected without the intervention of a  
special minister. ,  
• It will be in your recollection, sir, that in  
our first interview, I stated the condition,  
which makes the subject&#x27;of the present letr  
| ter, before 1 was informed by you, that the  
president of the United States would consent  
to the separation of the two subjects.  
. I had trusted that the exposition, which I  
added in my letter of the 26th January to the  
verbal explanation I had before offered, of  
the grounds of his majesty’s demand, was  
both m its purport, and in the terms in which  
it was couched, such as to prevent a suspi­  
cion that they were in their intention derog­  
atory to the honor, or calculated to wound  
the just sensibility of this nation. I may ad*  
that such a supposition could not be recon­  
ciled with the various ostensible and une­  
quivocal demonstrations of his majesty’s  
good faith and anxiety, that this transaction  
  
•3,*vuiu wiMuijiii iu an auucaoie tcrroinati­  
on, which were exhibited even prior to anv  
remonstrances on the part, or by order of  
this government. The other topics which  
I lelt myself authorised to advance in that  
letter, in illustration of that amicable dis­  
position on the part of the king, were bro’t  
forward from the conviction 1 entertained  
hat they must be of a nature to be satisfac­  
tory to this government, and therefore, such  
as it was particularly my duty to.enforce;  
out not with a view to rest upon them the  
right to advance the claim which 1 have sta­  
ted. .  
I may here remark, it is obvious that far  
from requiring that the first steps towards  
an arrangement of reparation should be ta­  
ken by the United States, Great-Britain has  
already made them openly and distinctly ;_  
they are indubitable testimonies to the in­  
spect borne and decidedly marked by Great  
Britain, to the ties of amity subsisting be­  
tween the two tuitions and ot her cordial  
desire to maintain them unimpaired ; and  
as such alone they were urged.  
As his majesty would have derived sin­  
cere satisfaction from the evidence of cor­  
responding feelings on the part of the United  
Stages, so it would be the more painful tome  
to duel! upon a series of insuits and men­  
aces which, without any provoce ion of war­  
like preparation, on the part of Great-Bri­  
tain, have been for month&#x27;, a^.cumulated up­  
on her through the U. States, and but too  
frequently from quarter?, whose authority  
necessarily ami powerfully commanded at­  
tention.  
1 ought, perhaps,to apologize fol- advert­  
ing to an incidental expression in your letter,  
if I did not think tt ri&quot; nt to remove any am­  
biguity respecting the nature of the claim  
winch G. Britain maintained to her seamen,  
native citizens of the vealm/whok.ive deser­  
ted from ’.ter service to that ol other powers ;  
it is, that on demand tiiey shali be dischpnr.  
e \/orthinith, and consequently they shall in­  
stantly L&gt;e freed tro.n their newly contracted  
obligations.  
Be-fore I close this letter, allow roe to state  
to you, sir, that I have feit it my duty to  
krausinit to his majesty&#x27;s government,&#x27;the  
exposition contained in your letter of the  
♦*th instant, of the various demands on the  
hon®r and good faith of G cat-Britain, on

Siivce that timu such of those officers as  
have been necessitated by the circmnstan­  
stnnces of the war to remain in these wa­  
ters, have held no communication with the  
t.b&#x27;.rc, except in an instance too trifling to  
dwell upon, and instantly disavowed by the  
i commanding; officer; and they have acqui­  
esced quietly in various privations, highly  
prcjadici il to the service they were uoon,  
ahd in consequence of an interdict, which  
had they been regardless of their duties  
towards a state, in amity with their so­  
vereign, and hail they not carefully repress­  
vd the ierlingsits tone and language hud a  
xt rcct tendency to provoke in them, would  
have rather excited, than have averted the  
cvii« it wms stated lobe intended to prevent;  
were they regardful of these duties, it was  
unnecessary Had they felt themselves o­  
hligcd corophtcly to evacuate the waters  
of the United Slates, especially whilst an  
enemy’s squadron was haroored in them,  
they could have done it; but under the ad­  
mission of hostile compulsion, ntid under  
R»rh compulsion, carried into full cftVct,  
his tnajcs:y c* a!d not have dissembled the  
extent of liie injury received.  
J-» the several cases adduced, in which  
Urcat Uritoio required certain prelimina­  
ries, previously to entering into negociation,  
she reguiatt d her conduct by the same prin­  
ciple s to which she now adheres; and re­  
fused, whits: no hostility w: exhibited oil  
her o-irt, to treat with powers, whose pro­  
ceedings denoted it towards her ; and xvhc  
maintained their right in what they hados­  
. juried.  
  
l’r &gt; n tot* considerations thus offered, 1  
tr;i&#x27;t that neither the order or reason, or  
that rj usage, are in contradiction to the de­  
ntnnd 1 have urged, nor am I aware how  
the order of time opposes the revocation in  
tlte fust instance, of that act, which affects  
injuriously ore of the parties, and is still a­  
Vowed bv tV.r; other.  
fThe subject is thus presented to you, sir,  
in the light in which it was natural that it  
f hould offer itself to his mojestv’s govern­  
meat. It certainly conceived the Presi­  
dent&#x27;s proclamation to rest chiyfly, and  
most materially nnrn the attack made upon  
the frigate of the U. S. tire Chesny.eako, by  
li t majesty’s sh;p Leopard, although other  
topics were adduced ns accessories. In this  
apprehension it may be held to hnve been  
sufficiently warranted, hy the precise time  
nt which, and the circumstances under  
which, it was issued, and by its whole cor..;  
text; and the more so, as the impulse un­  
der which it was drawn up appears to have  
been so sudden as to have precluded a due  
examination of all the grounds of allegation  
contained in a. And here l beg leave to  
assure you, that wit it respect to the spirit,  
and tone of that in^rument, it would be  
highly satisfactory to m», if I could feel my­  
seli just*ii—rl in expressing on the part of  
his majesty, any degree of coincidence with  
the opini* ns yon have announced, or when  
thus appealed to, and making every allow­  
ance for ihe irritation cf the moment, I  
could dissemble the extreme surprise ex­  
perienced by Great Bi ..am, that the £ov­

learn from yon, sir, the proclamation rests  
sitbsMntnlly on other r;.it,es, it is then pe-j  
euiini iy to iVt regretted, that together with&#x27;  
the demand for redress made in Sep*em-t

not think fit rn ofiar a negociation, or an!  
explanation of so momentous a measure, or.  
to declare that its recall inu.t be more or  
let&#x27; connected with the adjustment of other  
■Hedged wrongs. Neither did it think it}  
necessary to return any answer to trie re­  
monstrance given in by irs majesty’senvov .  
at Washington, on tV.o 13lh July/ 11 &gt;or, iiij  
whicli lie represented “tiiRt he considered &#x27;  
“that interdiction to be so unfriendly in in j  
“ object, and so injurious in its cwsequen­  
“ res t»his majesty’s interests, tliat lie could  
“not refrain fr.no expressing the. m&gt;st ‘in-,  
“cere regret, that it ever should have been&#x27;  
“t&#x27;-sned, and most earnestly deprecating its :  
“being enforced.”  
It could not be supposed that a circum-j  
stance ot so great weight could be over­  
looked by his majesty’s government, in de­  
termining the line oi conduct to be held in  
the negociation s and as little could it be  
expected to pass it over, when on the fail­  
ure of the discussion with Mr. Monroe, It di­  
rected a special mission to be sent to the  
U. S. It had the less reason to imagine  
that any other grievances could be connec­  
ted with that, for the adjustment of which  
I am empowered tonegociate, ns Mr Mon­  
roe in his letter to Mr. Canning of the 29th  
of July last, had stated with rcppect to o­  
thrr subjects of remonstrance, that it was  
Improper to mingle them with the present  
more serious caus? of complaint; an opini­  
on to which Mr Canning declared his per­  
fect assent, in his letter to that minister of  
the 2d of the subsequent month ; so that this  
act was left as*singie ami distinct, to be sin­  
gly and distinctly considered. His majes­  
ty’* government therefore could not consis­  
tently with any view of the subject then be­  
fore it, or indeed with the just object of my  
  
mission, direct or impowcr me to enter upon  
matters not connected with that of tfie Che­  
japcake: and tliey could with the less pro­  
priety do it, as in order to render the ad­  
justment of differences of such a nature the  
more easy and the mre conspicuous, the  
minister charged especially with suchOffi­  
ces, h?ve been with few, if any exceptions,  
restricted to the precise affair to be nego­  
tiated. With respect, therefore, to those  
otuer causes of complaint upon which you  
inform ms that the President&#x27;s proclama­  
tion rests, I cannot be furnished wuh docu­  
ments enabling ..ne either to admit or to  
controvert those statements of grievance,  
foreign to the attack upon that ship, con­  
tained in veur letter ; or authorised to dis­  
cuss the matters themselves. I shall there­  
fore not allow myself to offer such comments  
as my personal knowledge of some of those  
transactions suggest to me, although tluir  
tendency would materially affect both the  
marked manner in which those transacti­  
ons are pourtrayed, and the disadvantage­  
ous light in which his majesty’s govern­  
ment is represented to have acted respect­  
ing them. I am moreover led to the per­  
suasion, that my government will be the  
more easily able to rescue itself from incul­  
pation by the inference arising from pas­  
sages in Mr Monroe’s letters to Mr Secre­  
tary Canning, of the 29th of September,  
last, that the differences unhappily exist­  
ing between the two nations were in n train  
• f adjustment.  
If his majesty h-i&quot; not permitted me to  
enter into the discussion of the search of  
neutral merchant ships for British seamen,  
together with the adjustment of the amount  
of reparation for the attack upon the Ches­  
apeake, it was no wise with a view of pre­  
cluding toe funner agitation of that questi­  
on at a su’table time ; but it was that the  
ncgoclation might lie relieved from the em­  
barrassment arising from thu connection of  
the present matter with the cue so foreign  
to it, ar.:l, as it was hut t-»o well known, so  
difficult to be adjusted, of a rigjit distinctly  
declaimed, with one which Great Brit..in  
‘iiin at fell times asserted, of enforcing hei  
claim to the services of her natural born  
subjects, when found on board merhant  
vessels nf o.ber nations; a claim which sh.*  
founds in that principle cf universal law.  
  
wn&gt;cii gives 10 toe stale liie rigot or icq lur­  
ing the aid and assistance of her native ci­  
tizens. The recurrence, therefore, to tha  
cause of negociation, which had been ori­  
ginally settled between Mr Secretnfy Can­  
on;;, and Mr Monroe, and which hsul beci  
d »ni brol;r- n upon by the orJers subse­  
quently received by t&#x27;nat minister, can oiuj  
be craisidered as a resumption of th t course  
of things which Great Britain strenaoush  
contended there w.,r, no ground to depar  
from. 1 may observe that this purpose  
m ght&#x27;havc been effected without the inter­  
vention of a special minister.  
It will be in your rcoliection, s-&#x27;r, that  
in our fir»t interview, I stated the conditi­  
on, which makes the subject of the present  
letter, be lore I was informed by you, that  
the President of the U. S. would consent to  
the sen &lt;ration of the two subjects,.  
I had trusted that the exposition, which  
I added in my letter of the 26th of Janua­  
ry. to the verbal explanation I had be for#  
off-red, of the grounds of his majesty’s de­  
mand, was both in its purport, and in the  
term:; in wh eh it was couched, such t-.s to  
prevent a suspicion that they were in their  
intention det gatory tothe honor, ore- lcula­  
ted to wound the just sensibility of the na­  
tion. I may arid that such a supposition  
could not be reconciled with, the variout  
ostensible ai d unequivocal demonstrations  
of his on tjesty’s good faith, and anxiety,  
that this transaction should bo brought to .at  
amicable termination, which were exhibi­  
ted even prior to vny remonstrances on the  
put, nr by cider of this government. The  
other topics winch I felt in&gt;sdf authorised  
tn advance in that letter, in illustration ni  
that amicable disposition on the part of the  
king, were brought forward from the con  
viction I entertained that they must lie of a  
nature to be satisfactory to this govern­  
ment, and thercibre such as it was particu­  
larly my duty to enforce, but not with n  
vie w to rest upan them the right to adv ance  
  
the claim whicfi I Iihstated.  
I may here remark, it is obvious that far  
from requiring that tlie first steps towards  
an arrangement of reparation should be ta­  
ken by the U. States, Great Britain has al­  
ready made 1 liCni opew&#x27;.y and distinctly :  
they arc* indubitable testimonies to the re­  
spect borne and decidedly marked by Great  
Britain, to the* ties of amity subsisting be­  
tween the two tnticits, ami of her cordial  
desire to maintain them unimpaired ; and  
as such alone they were urged.  
An hi* majesty would have derived sin­  
cere satisfaction from the evidence of cor­  
responding feelings on the part of the Uni­  
ted States ; so it would be the more painfu.  
to ine to dwell upon a scries of insults and  
menaces, which without any provocation ol  
warlike preparation on the part ofG. Brit­  
ain, have been for months accumulated up­  
on her through the United States, and hut  
too frequently from quarters, whose autho­  
rity necessarily and powerfully commanded  
attention.  
T ought perhaps to apologise for advert&#x27;  
ing to an incidental expression in your let­  
ter, iff did not think it right to remove h­  
nv ambiguity respecting the nature of thr  
claim which Great Britain maintained tr  
her seamen, native citizens of the realm,  
who have deserted from her service to that  
of other powers: it is, that on demand they  
shall be discharged forthwith, and conse  
qu#*ntly they shall instantly be freed from  
their newly contracted obligations.  
Before I close this letter, allow me ft  
j state to you sir, that I have felt it my dot.  
&#x27;to transmit to hia majesty’s government  
  
the exposition contained in your letter of  
the 5th instant, of the various demands on  
the honor and good faith of Great Britain,  
on which the complaint is made, that satis­  
faction has not been afF »rded to the U. S  
and on which conjointly with the affair of  
the Chesapeake, you inform me that the  
proclamation of the President of the U S.  
of the 2d July, 1807, :s founded. I; will be  
for his majesty’s government to determine  
on the part of Great Britain, whether any,  
and what obligations remain to be fit1 filled  
by her—-whether any denial or such pro­  
traction of redress have occurred on lie*  
part, as to render necessary or justifiable  
the perseverance in an edict, which when  
not necessary or justifiable, assumes a cha­  
racter of aggression ; and whether, on the  
result of these considerations, the present  
negociation can he resumed on the part of  
his majesty, with a due regard for his own j  
honor or with a prospect of a more suc­  
cessful termination.  
I have the honor to lie,  
With the highest consideration,  
Sir,  
Yr.ur most obedient, and  
Most humble servant

Frarn the considerations thus offered, I trust  
  
that neither the order of reason, or that of st-

The subject it: thus presented to you, sir,  
in the light in Xwhichtt wasM  
  
should oner itself to his Majesty&#x27;s govern­  
tnent. It certainly conceived the President&#x27;s  
  
firoclaraation to rest chiefly, and most mate  
  
.rially upon the atutk made upon, the frigate  
  
Majesty sj ship Leopard, ahlibugh other to­  
pics were adduced ts accessories, n this  
apprehcrjuon it may be held to have been  
  
sumciently warranted, by the precise time at  
  
which, and the circumstances under whkh.  
  
it was issued, and by its whole context ; and  
the more so, as the Impulse under whkh h  
  
was drawn up appears to hive been so sud­  
den as to have precluded a due examination  
  
a all the grounds of arerat!tx contained in  
  
it. And here I beg have to assure yon, that  
  
w m respect to the spirit, and tone of that to  
  
stru tnent, it would be highly satMactnry to  
me, if I could feel myself jmtiEed uexpres-  
  
sing oo me part of tm Majesty, arv oejree  
of coincidence with the opinions yen base an­  
nounced, or when thus rraJed to and. ma  
  
Ung every allowance for the irritation of the!  
  
tftSmcGf, I could cissemue the extreme sur­  
ptbe experiented by Great Britain, that the  
gorerninent of a frsendly nation, even beiore  
an amicable demand of reparation was made j  
and yet meaning to m-tLe ;ut demand i

addressed, and tending UI call fvrthin both  
nations&#x27;&#x27;tjseelingt tinder whkh a friend­

the line of conduct to be held b the negt ela­

BEING deeply impressed with the  
sense of his majesty&#x27;s anxiety, that full  
effect should be given to those views of  
justice and moderation, by ■ which his  
conduct has been regulated through- the  
whole of the unfortunate transaction  
whence the present differences have wv  
risen ; and of the disappointment of j  
which he would learn the frustration of I  
his just and equitable purposes ; I have  
felt it incumbent upon me, on the receipt  
of the letter which you did me the honor  
to address me on the 5th instant, to ap­  
ply anew to this matter the most ample  
and serious consideration. It is with1  
the most painful sensations of regret that  
I find myself on the result uf it, under  
the necessity of declining to enter intofj  
the term* of negotiation, which by di­  
rection of the president of the United*]  
States, you therein offer. I do not feels]  
myself competent, in the present in-|  
stance, to depart from those instructions,]  
which I stated in my letter of the 26th ofi  
January last, and which preclude me&#x27;  
from acceding to the condition thus pro- j  
posed. 1 should add, that I am abso­  
lutely piohibitcd ftom entering upon  
matters unconnected with the specific oh  
ject I am authorized to discuss, much  
less can I thus give any pledge concern­  
ing them. I he condition suggested,  
moreover, leads to the direct inference,  
that the proclamation of the president of  
the United States of the 2d of July, 1807,  
is maintained either as an equivalent for  
reparation for the time being, or as a&#x27;  
compulsion to make it. , . 1  
It is with the more profound regret that  
I feel my self under the necessity of de­  
claring, that I am unable to act upon the  
terms thus proposed, as it becomes my  
duty to inform you, in conformity to my  
instructions, that on the rejection of the  
demand stated in my former letter, on  
the part of his majesty, my mission is  
terminated. And as his majesty ’s go­  
vernment in providing me with those in­  
structions, did not conceive that after  
the declaration of his sentiments respect­  
ing the affair of the Chesapeake was made  
known to this government, the state of  
any transactionspehdingor untertninated  
between the two nations could justiFy the  
perseverance in the enforcement of the  
president&#x27;s proclamation, I can exercise  
uo discretion on this point..,  
As on a former occasion I detailed,  
though minutely, the motives for that  
demand on the part of his majesty, which  
I with so much concern learn to be deem­  
ed inadmissible by the government of the  
United States, I should here abstain  
from an exposition of them, which visi­  
bly can have no further effect upon the  
  
negotiation, if I did not deem it essential  
that they should not be left under any  
misapprehension which I might be&#x27;able  
to remove. 1 shall, therefore, take a  
short review of the transaction, which  
has given rise to these 4»cussions, in  
order the more correctly to. determine  
the soundness of the principle on which  
that demand is made.  
Certain deserters from his majest\’s  
navy, many of them bis natural born sub­  
jects, having entered into the service of  
the United States, were repeatedly and  
fruitlessly demanded by the British of­  
ficers, of the recruiting officers of the U*  
nited States, but were retained in their  
new servi&lt;e. As it was a matter of no­  
toriety that several of these deserters  
were on board the frigate of the United  
States the Chesapeake, they were de­  
manded of that frigate on the high seas  
by his majesty Ysfiip Leopard, and all  
knowledge of their presence on board  
being denied, she was attacked and four  
of them, one avowedly a native English*  
man, wire taken out of her. Without  
being dettired by the consideration if  
how far circumstances hostile in their ni­  
ture had provoked, though they un­  
doubtedly by no means justified this act  
of the British officer, his majesty’s go­  
vernment directed, that a positive disa­  
vowal of the right of search asserted in  
this case, and of the act of the British  
officer as being unauthorized, and a pro­  
mise of reparation, should be conveyed  
to the American minister in London,  
before he had made any representation  
by order of the United States. This  
disavowal made on the 2d of August last.  
  
was transmitted by him to his govern­  
ment before the 6th of that month.—  
But before Mr. Monroe had received  
his orders to demand reparation, his I  
majesty learnt, with what surprise it is &#x27;  
needless to dwell upon, that the presi­  
dent of the United States had interdicted  
by proclamation bearing date the 2d of  
July, 1807, the entry of all their ports  
to the whole of his navy. This suiprise  
was tnuiiutj tun cased, wtien in the let­  
ter delivered by that minister to require  
fedress for the wrong, although it went  
bto details unconnected with it, not on­  
[ )v no concern was expressed on the part  
of the United States, at having felt them­  
selves compelled to enact measures of so  
I ranch injury and indignity towards a  
friendly power, but no mention was  
nade of the causes of such measures be­  
j ing resorted to, or even of the tact of  
| their having been adopted. In addition  
to the embarrassment arising from these  
circumstances, and the insufficiency of  
the explanations subsequently given to  
Mr. Canning, the introduction of a sub­  
ject foreign to that of the complaint be­  
came the main impediment to the suc­  
cess of the discussions which took place  
in London. When I had the honor to  
open the negotiation with you, air, aa I  
tad learnt that the president’s proclama­  
1-0 was still in force, it became my du­  
;y, conformably to my instructions, to  
uquire its recall as a preliminary to fur­  
ther discussion: had it not been in force,  
1 was not ordered to have taken it into  
crpsideration in the adjustment of reps­  
! ration, and it was considered as hardly  
possible that it should not have been re­  
called immediately upon the knowledge  
iaf his majesty’s disavowal of the attack  
spon the Chesapeake, a« an unauthorized  
bcL But his majesty could not suffer  
the negotiation to be earned on, on his  
behalf, under an interdict, which even  
if justifiable in the first moment of irrita­  
tion, cannot be continued after the de­  
claration of hit majesty’s sentiments up­  
on the transaction, except in a spirit, of  
hostility. \
It might have been fairly contended  
uat in the first instance, the exercise of  
Kith an act of power, before reparation  
was refused or unduly protracted, was  
iicompatible with the purposes and es­  
s ace of pacific negotiation, and with a  
d.-mand of redress through that channel;  
but such have been his majesty’s con­  
ciliatory views, that this argument has  
not been insisted on, although it might,  
now be the more forcibly urged, as it ap­  
pears that the government of the United  
Sutct was from the first sensible, that,  
even had the hostility been meditated by  
the British government, it would not  
have commenced it in such a manner.  
But the exception r»ken, is to the en­  
forcement continued up to the present  
  
time, of ■tenures highly unfriendly in  
their tendency, persisted in, not only  
f*&quot;V  
after the  
raise of the

ty&#x27;s ami

disposition, but ,fter ^  
given in a public instru­

claim to the seizure ofde­  
&gt;e national ships of other  
&gt;t again be brought forward  
..• naval officers j it is un.  
necessary o dwell upon the injury and  
indignity o which his majesty&#x27;s servica  
is eaposed both as touching the free­  
dom and scurity of correspondents of  
Ins agents tod accredited ministers intha  
United Stales, or as resulting from a  
measure which in time of war, excludes  
the whole of his navy from all their porta,  
which ports are completely open to tha  
fleets of his enemies: it will be sufficient  
to observe, that even where exemptioua  
from it are granted, they are made sub­  
ject to such conditions, that of the three  
last British ships of war, which hav«  
entered these ports upon public business,  
two of them, his majesty’s ship Statira  
having on board a minister sent out for  
the adjustment of the present differences,  
and a schooner bearing dispatches, in  
consequence of their inability to procure  
pilots, were obliged to enter these waters  
without such assistance, and were ex­  
posed to considerable danger. Great­  
Britain, by the forms established, could  
repair the wrong committed, even to the  
satisfaction of the United States, no  
otherwise than by the channel of nego­  
yet she avowed distinctly, that  
K  
*  
JCN&#x27;  
tiation  
  
m wiung was tommiuea, ana that sqc  
wa» ready to make reparation, for it t  
it cannot therefore be contended  
that the unavoidable delay of actual re*  
paration subjected her to the imputation  
of persisting in an aggression, which was  
disclaimed from the first; if this is true,  
however much she will regret any ia*  
pediment in the adjustment of a diffe­  
rence, in which the feelings of a nation  
are so materially interested; can she  
consistently with a due care ol her own  
honor and hterests, allow it to be con­  
cluded oo tyr part, under an adherence  
to a conduct, which has a decided cha­  
racter of enbity in the proceedings held  
towards hei by the other party.  
I know at in what view the persever­  
ance in thepresident&#x27;s proclamation up  
to this monent can be considered, but  
in that of a pleasure of retaliation; or of  
sclf-assume| reparation ; or a measure  
intended totompel reparation ; unless it  
be that which, if I rightly understand,  
you define it to be, a measure of pre­  
caution. *&#x27;r  
If, when a wrong is committed, re­  
taliaUon is instantly resorted to by the  
injured party, the door to pacific adjust­  
mint is closed, and the meant of con.  
cihation are precluded. The right to  
demand reparation ia incompatible with  
the assumption of it. When parties are  
m » ,tate of mutual hostility, they are  
so far on a footing, and at such they may  
treat; but a party disclaiming every un­  
friendly intention, and giving unequivo­  
cal proofs of an amicable disposition,  
cannot be expected to treat with another  
whose conduct towards it has the direct

enforcement of the pmui*iu,« proilima*

Britain is dispensed with the duty of  
proffering redness. But, if it is a mea­  
sure of precaution, in order to secure  
reparation, or in order to compel it, it  
falls under the objections I have just  
stated. If it is a precaution adopted as  
a guard against acts of violence appre­

officers, it surely cannot be considered  
as being as effectual a security as that a­  
rising from the renewed assurances of  
his majesty’s friendly disposition, which  
imply a dye observance of the rights of  
nations with which Qreat-Britain is in

ah apprehension have any v  
cessity aid longer eaists: if  
ho value, negotiation cannot  
cd, as the basis upon which  
mutual confidence of thi t  
would be wholly wanting.  
From the moment sifter  
nate affair of the ChcsapeaH:  
majesty&#x27;s naval commandci  
waters had ascertained th;  
sale from the effervescence  
lar fury, and under which

ibjects of  
state of  
War against them, rtq tiring precautions  
on their part, had commenced no con*  
duct has been imputed to thei , which  
could vindicate the necessity of main*  
taining in force the president&#x27;* irncUtna­  
tion. Since that time such dr tbostf‘of­  
ficers as have been necessitated by the  
circumstances of the war to remain in  
these waurr, have held no cominunica*  
tion with the shore, except in an instance  
too tridsog to dwell upon, and instantly  
disavowed by the commanding officer;  
and they have acquiesced qutctlv in vari­  
ous privations, highly prejudicial Co the  
service they were upon, and in conse­  
quence of an interdict, which had they  
been regardless of their duties towards a  
state in amity with their sovereign, and  
had they not carefully repressed the feel­  
ings its tune and language had a direct  
tendency to provoke in them, would have  
rather excited, than have averted the  
evils it was stated to be intended to pre­  
vent ; were the? regardful of these du­  
ties, it was unnecessary. Had they felt  
themselves obliged completely to evacu­  
ate the waters of the U nrted States, es­  
Ceially whilst sn enemy’s squadron was  
rbored in them, they could have done  
it; but under the admission of hostile  
compulsion, snd under such compulsion,  
carried into full effect, his majesty could  
not have dissembled the extent of the  
injurv received.  
•/  
  
r*,? &#x27;  
la the several cases a Iduced, in which  
Great-Britain required&quot;certain prelimi- 1  
naries, previously to entering into nego­  
nation, she regulated her conduct by the  
same principles to which she&#x27;now ad­  
heres, and refused, whilst nc hostility  
was exhibited on her part, id reat with  
powers, whose proceedings t looted it  
towards her; and who naiotaned their  
right in what they bad assume I.  
From the considerations thi s offered,  
I trust that neither the order if reason  
or that of usage are in contra ktion to  
the demand 1 have urged,&#x27; no uni a*  
ware how the order of time of x&gt;ses the  
revocation in the first ins tan e of that  
act, which affects injuriously arte of the  
parties and is still avowed by (he other.  
The subject is thus presented to you,  
sir, in the light which it was aatural that  
it should offer itself to his majesty’s go­  
vernment. It certainly conceived the  
president’s proclamation to rest chiefly,  
and most materially upon the attack  
made upon the frigate oi the United  
States, the Chesapeake, by his majesty’s  
ship the Leopard, although other topics  
were adduced as &#x27; accessories. In this  
apprehension it may be held to have bceci  
snffiriendy warranted, by the precise  
time at which, and the circumstances un­  
der which it was issued, and by its whole  
context, and the more so, as the im  
pulse under which it was drawn up, ap­  
_-jH?8r» to have been so sudden as to liaye  
precluded a~duC cnsilwili a »l aft thm  
grounds of allegation^cootaiaed in it.—  
And heye I beg leave to assure you. that  
with respect to the spirit and tone of that  
instrument, it would be highly satisfac­  
tory to me,if I could feel myftlf justified  
in expressing on the part oi bis m ijesty  
any degree of coincidence with the o­  
pinion* you have announced; pf when  
thus appealed to, and making every al­  
lowance for the irritation of tne moment,  
I could dissemble the extreme surprise  
experienced by Great-Britian,‘that the  
government of a friendly nation, even  
before an amicable demand of reparation  
was assdc, and vet meaning to make that  
deminu, should have issued an edict di­  
recting measures of inj ury very disp o­  
pordoonte to what iit knew was an un­  
authorized offence, and both ip tts terms  
mod its purport so injurious to the govern -  
m«nt to which that demend was to be ad­  
dteased, and tending to call forth ini both  
nations, (he feelings funder which a  
friendly adjustment would be the most  
difficult. Bat if, as I learn from ybu,  
sir,&#x27; Ihs proclamation rests substantially  
on other causes, it is then: peculiarly to  
be regretted, that, together with, the de­  
an d for redress mark in September  
•■A  
  
last, tht governtnces i t trve United  
State* did not think fit to offer a neg uu- j  
tion, or an explanation of m momen­  
tous a measure, or to declare that its re* !  
fit must be more or leas connected with  
e adjustment of other alleged wrongs,  
either did it think it necessary to re*  
torn any answer to the remonstrance  
given in by his majesty’s envoy at  
Washington, on the 13th July, 1807,  
in which he represented “ that he con­  
“ aideredthat interdiction to be so un­  
“ friendly in its object, and so injurious |  
“ in its consequences to his majesty’s  
“ interests, that he could not refrain from *  
** expressing the most sincere regret that j  
“ it ever should have been issued, aod j  
** most earnestly deprecating its being j  
“ enforced.”  
  
It could not be supposed that a circum­  
stance of so great weight could be over­  
looked by his majesty’s government, in  
determining the line of conduct to  
be held in the negotiation: and as little  
could it be expected to pass it over, when  
on the failure &lt; f the discussion with Mr.  
Monroe, it directed a special mission to  
be scot to the United States, ft had the  
less reason to imagine that any other  
grievances could be connected with that  
lor the adjustment of which I am em­  
powered to negotiate, as Mr. Monroe, 4  
10 bis letter to Mr. Canning of the 29th  
ofjult fast, had stated with respect to  
other subjects of remonstrance, that W  
was improper to mingle them with the  
present more serious cause of complaint;  
an opinion to which Mr. Canning de­  
clared hit perfect assent in his letter to  
that minister of the 2d of the subsequent  
month; so that this act was left as single  
nod distinct, to be singly and distinctly  
considered. His majesty’s government,  
theref r .*, could dot consistently with a*  
ny view of the subject then before k, or  
indeed with the just object of my mis­  
sion, direct or empower me to enter up­  
on matters not connected with that cf the  
Chesapeake: and they could with tht less  
propriety do it, as in order to rendet the  
adjustment of differences of such a na­  
ture, the more easy and the more con­  
spicuous, the ministers charged especial­  
ly With such offices have been, with fe#  
if any exceptions, restricted to the pre­  
cise affair to be negotiated. With, res­  
pect therefore to those tfther causes of  
complaint, upon which you inform me I  
that the President’s proclamation rests,  
! I cannot be furntsnea Wliti document®  
I enabling me either to admir or to cotv  
trovert those statements/of grievance,  
I foreign to the attack upo# that ship, con-1  
! tained in your letter, or authorized to  
| discuss the matters themselves. I shall  
&#x27; therefore not allow thyself to offer suchri  
! comments as my personal knowledge of  
some of those transactions suggest to  
me, although tjleir tendency would ma­  
terially affect both the marked manner ini  
which thosetransactiona are pourtrayed,  
and the disadvantageous lights in which  
his majesty’s government is represented  
to have acted respecting them. I am  
moreover led to the persuasion that my  
government wifi be the more easily able  
to rescue itself frojh inculpation, by the  
inference arising from passages in Mr  
Monroe&#x27;s letter to Mr. secretary Can  
ning, of the 29th of September last, tha  
the differences unhappily existing be  
tween the two nations Were io a train 0 ‘  
adjustment.  
.4 If his majesty has not permitted* nu  
■ to enter into the discussion of the searcl  
of neutral merchant ships for British sea  
men, together with the adjustment of  
the amount of reparation for the attack  
upon the Chesapeake; it was nowise  
with at view of precluding the further srl  
git«i,&lt;j of that question at a suitable  
time j but It was that the negotintiww  
might be relieved from the embarrass,  
merit arising from the connection of (he  
present matter with the one so foreign  
to it, and, as it was but-too well known,  
j so difficult to be adjusted, of a right dia­  
1 tinctly disclaimed; with one which!  
Great- Britain has at all times asserted of  
enforcing her claim to the services of her  
natural born subjects, when fonnd on  
board merchant vessels of other nations ;  
a claim which she founds in that princi­  
ple of universal law, which gives to the  
state the fight of requiring the aid and  
assistance of her native citizens. The  
recurrence, therefore, to that course of  
| negotiation, which had been originalfy  
settled between Mr, secretary Canning&#x27;  
| arid Mr. Monfoe, and which had been  
] alone broken in upon by die orders tub*&#x27;  
; sequendy received by that minister, can  
only be considered aa a resumption of  
that course of things which Great-Bri­  
tain strenuously contended there was no  
ground to depart from. 1 may observe,  
that this purpose might have been elect­  
ed without the intervention of a special  
minister.  
&#x27; It trill be in your recollection, sir, that  
  
in our f. »t intervie w* I stated the con­  
dition, which mikes the subject of the  
present letter, before I was informed by  
you, that the president of the United  
States would consent to the separation of  
the two subjects.  
I had trusted that the exposition, which  
I added in my letter of the 26th of Janua­  
ry to the verbal explanation I had before  
offered, of the grounds of his majesty’s  
demand, was both in its purport, and in  
the terms in which it was couched, such  
as to prevent a suspicion that they were  
in their intention derogatory to the ho­  
nor, or calculated to wound the just sen­  
sibility of this nation. I may add that  
such a supposition could not be reconcil­  
ed with the various ostensible and une­  
quivocal demonstrations of his majesty’s  
good faith and anxiety, that this transac­  
tion should be brought to an amicable  
termination, which were exhibited even  
prior to any remonstrances on the part,  
. ir by order of this government. The  
other topics which I felt myself authoriz­  
ed to advance in that letter, in illustra­  
tion of that amicable disposition on the  
part of the king, were brought forward  
from the conviction I entertained that  
they must be of a nature to be satisfacto­  
ry to this government, and therefore,  
such as it was particularly my duty to  
enforce; but not with a view to rest up­  
on them the right to advance the claim  
which I have stated.  
  
I may here remark, it is obvious that  
far from requiring that the first steps to*  
words aa arrangement of reparation  
should be taken by the United States,  
Great- Britain has already made them  
openly and distinctly : they are indubita­  
ble testimonies to the respect borne and  
decidedly marked by Great-Britain, to  
the ties of amity subsisting between the  
two nations, and of her cordial desire to  
maintain them unimpaired j and as such  
alone they were urged.  
As his majesty would hare derived  
sincere satisfaction from the evidence of  
corresponding feelings on the part of the  
United States, so it would be the more  
painful to me to dwell upon a series of  
insults and menaces which, without any  
provocation of warlike preparation on  
the part of Great-Britain, have been for  
months accumulated upon her through  
the U. States, and but too frequently  
from quarters whose authority necessa­  
r ly and powerfully commanded atten­  
tion.  
1 ought, perhaps, to spologixe for ad­  
verting ro an incidental expression in  
your letter, if I did not think it right to  
remove aay ambiguity respecting the na­  
ture of the claim which Great-Britain  
maintained to her seamen, native citi­  
zens cf the realm, who have deserted  
frum her service to that of other powers:  
it is, that oq demand;they shall be dis­  
charged forlUwith, and1 consequently  
they shah instantly be freed from their  
newly contracted obligations.  
Before I close this letter, allow me to  
state to you, sir, that I have felt it my  
duty to transmit to his majesty’s govern­  
ment, the exposition contained in ^our  
letter of the 5th instant&#x27;, of the various  
demands on the houor an«f gcad faith of  
Great-Uiitain, on which me complaint  
is made, that satisfaction hiss not been  
afforded to the United States, and on  
which conjointly wiffc the affair of the  
Chesapeake, you inform me that the pro­  
clamation of the president of the United  
States of the second of July, 1807, is  
founded. It will be for his majesty’s go­  
vernment to determine, on the part of  
Great-Britain, whether any and what  
chligations remain to be fufilled by her.  
jVhetbcr any denial, or such protraction  
&gt;f redress have occurred on her part, as  
ito render necessary or justifiable the  
perseverance in an edict, which, when  
1 t necessary or justifiable, assumes a  
racier of aggression ; and whether  
th« result of these considerations, the  
a esent negotiation can, be resumed on  
the part of his majesty,-vwith a due re­  
gard for his own honor, or with a pros­  
pect of a more successful termination.  
I have the honor to fee, *  
With the highest consideration,  
Sir,  
Your most obedient and most  
Humble servant

~ceipt of the letter which you did me ithc  
~ honor to address to me on the sth inftaat,  
s apply anew to this matter the most am­  
_ple and serious consideration. Itis with&#x27;the  
molt painful sensations of regret, that I find  
myf{elf on the result of it, under the neceffis  
ty qf declining tc enter into tiie terms of ne­  
goetation, which by dire@ion of the Presi­  
dent of the Uaited States, you therein offer,  
1:do not feel myfelf competent, in the  
rprefm}t instance, to depart from thoFc ine  
ftructions, whieh L stated in my letter of the  
26th of January {aft, aud which preclude me  
‘ﬂ;;)m acceding to the condition thus propol­  
ed.  
I thould add, thatl am absolutely proe  
hibited from cateriag upon matters uacon­  
nctted with e fpeci&gt; abjed I am author­  
ifed to difenld, much less ean 1 thus give  
- any pledge concerniag them. The condi­  
- fion fugpclted, mareexer, leads to the direé  
ipference, that the proclamation of the Pre­  
sident of the United States, of the 2d of July,  
1807, is maintained cither as an equivalent  
‘for reparation for the time being, or as a  
compuifion ‘to make it.  
It is with more profound regret, that I  
feel myfelf + nder the necefbty of declaring  
that T am yaable to a&amp; upon the terms thus  
propofsa{ as it becomes my duty to inform  
you. in conformity to my inftruions, that  
on the rejeion of the demand stated in my  
former letter, on the part of his majelty, my  
mission is terminated. And as his majesty’s  
government in providing me with those inftruc­  
ticns, did not conceive that after the decla­  
ration of his sentiments respecting the affair  
of the Chesapeake was made known to this  
government, the state of any tranfaions,  
pending or unterminated between the two  
nations, could jultify the perseverance in the  
gnforcement of the President’s proclamation.  
I can exercise no discretion én this point.  
Ason a former occasion 1 detailed, though  
minutely, the rotives for that demand, on  
the part of his‘majefty, which 1 with so  
much concern learn to be deemed inadmis­  
sible by the governthent of the United  
States ; I should here abstain from an expo­  
{ition of them, which vilibly can have no  
further effcct upon the negociatjon, if I did  
not deem it cffential that they should not  
be left under any misapprehension, whichr I  
aright be able to remove. I shall therefore  
take a short review of the tranfa@ion which  
has given rife to these difcuflions in order  
the more correctly to determine the sound­  
ness of the principle upon which that de­  
mand is made,  
Certain deserters from his majesty’s navy,  
‘many of them his natural born subjects, hav­  
ing entered into the service of the United  
States, were repeatedly and fraitleloly de­  
manded by the Britifth offixers,of the recruait­  
ing officers of the U. States but were retain­  
ed in their new service, Ay it was a matter  
of notoriety that several of thefé deserters  
wer¢&#x27;on board the frigateiof the United  
States the Chesapeake, they vere demaunded  
of that frigate on the high feis by his majes­  
ty’s ship Lecpard; and all knowledge of  
theic prefeace on board beipg denied, she  
was attacked and four of then, one avowed­  
ly a native Englishman, were taken out of  
her. Without being deterred by . the con­  
sideration of how far circunftances hostile  
in their nature had provokdl, though they  
undoubtedly by no means suﬂiﬁed this act  
of the British officer, his nijelly’s govern­  
ment directed, that a positive disavowal of  
the right of search, asserted in this case, and  
of the act of the British officer as beirgr un­  
authorized, and a promise of reparation,  
should be conveyed to the American minis­  
ter in London, before he had made any re­  
presentation by order of the Uaited Scates.  
This disavowal made on the 2d of Augult  
last, was transmitted By him to his governs  
ment, before the 6th of that month. Bat  
before Mr. Monroe had received his orders  
to demand reparation, his majesty learnt,  
with what furptife ig is necdlefs to dwell  
upon, that the President of the United States  
had interdicted by proclﬁmation. bcaring  
date the ad July, 1807, the entry of all their  
pores to the whole of his navy. This sur­  
prise was cértainly increased. when in the  
letter delivergd by that minister to require  
redress for the wrong, although it went into  
details unconneéted with it, not caly no  
- concern was cxpreflfed on the part of the  
U. States at having felt themlelves compell­  
ed to enact measures of so much injury and  
indignity towards a friendly power, but no  
mention was made of the causes of such  
measures being resorted to, or even of the  
fact, of their having been adopted. In ad­  
dition to the embarraflment arising from  
tbefc.,circumﬁ;ticts, and the iofufficigncy of  
the explanations subsequently given to Mr,  
Canaing, the introduction of a subject fo­  
reign to that of the comphint tecame ‘the  
main impediment to the success of tHe dif­  
“cuflions which took place in London. When  
-Thad the honar to open the negociation with.  
. You, Sir, as [ had learnt that the President’s  
~proclamation was still in:force, it became  
_amy. duty, conformably te my instructions, to  
require.its recall as z*wclimin;\-y to further  
discussion : had it not been in force, 1 was  
- mot ordeved to Wave taken it into confiders  
ation in the adjuftmient of reparation, and it

should not have beca recalled immediately  
upon the knowledge of his majesty’s - difa­  
~vowal of thc“attac‘a vpon the Ch;[&amp;)«kc,  
- as an uoauthorized a&amp;. But his majesty  
~could not fuffer the negoeiation &#x27;to be car­  
ried on, on bis-behalf, under an intedict,  
- which cved if jultifiable in the firlk moment  
of irritation cannot be consinued after the  
declaration of his majeflly’s sentiments ypon­

the promife’of the presser of fuitabie repar­

majefly’s amicable disposition—but after se­

bearing date the 16th of October 1807, that  
the claim ‘to the seizure of sdderr es from  
the natioral ships of nihse powers, canhot  
agam be brought forward by his majesty’s

that even where exemptions from it are

of war, which haveentered these ports upon|  
public bufgnefs, two of chem, bis majefly’s’  
ship Statira having on bvard a miniftcr {fent  
out for the adjultment of the present differ­  
ences, and a {chooner bearing dispatches, in  
consequence of their inability to procure pis  
lots, were obliged to cnter these waters with­  
out such assistance, and were exposed to cou­  
fiderable danger. Great Britain by the  
forms cftablithed, could repair the wrong  
committed, even to the fatistattion of the  
United States, no otherwise than by the  
channel of negociation ; yet the avowed  
diftincily, that a wrong was committed, and  
that she was ready to make, reparation for.  
it; it cannot therefore be contended that  
the unavoidable delay of acual veparation  
fubje&amp;ed her to the imputation of perfiit­  
ing in an aggreflion, which was difciaimed  
from the ficlt; if this is true, however much  
she will regret any impediment in the ad­  
justment of 2 difference,”in which the feel­  
ings of a naticn are so materiaily interested ;  
can the consistently with a due care of her  
own honor and iaterefls, allow it to be con­  
cluded on her part, under an adherance to  
a condu&amp;, which has a decided character  
of ¢nmity in the proceedings held towsrds  
her by the othér party.  
I knéw not in what view the perseverance  
in the President’s proclamation, up to this  
moment, can be econfideted, [ bac iir thar of  
.a mealure of retaliation ; or of felf-afluméd  
reparation; or a measure intended to compe!  
reparation ; unless it be that which, if I right­  
ly understand, you define it to be, a mealure  
of precaution. |  
If, when a wrong is committed, retalia­  
tion is inltantly resorted to by the injured  
paity, the door to pacific adjustment is clof:  
¢d, and the means of conciliation are pr¢-  
cluded. The right to demand reparation is  
incompatible with the assumption of it -~  
When partiesare in a state of mutual hos­  
tility, they-aré {ofar on a footing, and as  
such they may treat’; but a party cifclaim­  
ing every unfriendly intention, and giviog,  
vnequivocal proofs of an amigable disposi­  
tion, cannot be expected to treat with ano­  
ther, whose condu&amp; towards it has the di-_  
ret effeéts of actual hostility. If then, the  
enforcement of the President’s prociamation,  
up te the present moment, is a mealuce of  
felf-aflumed reparation it is direétly repug­  
nant to the {pirit and fa&amp; of amicable ne­  
“gociation 3 if it is a measure to compel re­  
paration, it is cqually so; and by the parfe­  
verance in it. Great Britain is dispensed rith  
the duty of proferring redress. Butifit is  
a mealure of precaution, in order to fcture  
reparation, or in order to corapel it, it sally  
under the objc@ions 1 have jult stated. If  
it is a precaution adopted as a guard apiinft  
~acts of vialenc¢ apprehended on the pat of  
bLis majefly’s naval officers, it farcly cano:  
be considered as beiug as «fFetual furi­  
ty as that arising from the renewed dlur­  
auces of his majesty’s friendly difpoftion,  
which imply a due cbfervance of the rights  
of nations wit! .iich Great Britgn is&#x27;in  
amity, by al} perions holdiag authotity ua­  
‘der his majcfty’s government, from the dil­  
avowal of the pretension of the fearth of na-:  
tional {hips; and from the further aflurance  
of that disavowal, given in lis majc&amp;g’s  
proclamation of the 16th of O&amp;obir lalt : -  
Ncitber vnder these concurrent circumstan­  
ces can the plea of neceflity be mdintained,  
and if such a preceeding hasnot the plea of -  
neceflity, it aflumes the charater of aggref~  
fion. If these concurrent fecuritics against  
“such an wpprehenfion have any value, the  
“neceflity no longer exists; if they are gs no  
&quot; walue, negociation cannot be attempted; as  
the basis upon which y refls, the mutual  
confidence of the two pasties, would be  
wholly wanting. = = SO  
From. the moment after the unfortunate  
-affair of the Chelapeake, that his majesty’s  
~naval commanders in thcfe waters, had af­  
~certained that they were fafe from the ef­  
fervefcence of ‘tgqt popular fury, under  
‘which the most glaring outrages werg coms  
~mitted, and by which they were very nat­  
wurally led to the supposition that they were.  
objects of particular hostility, and that 3  
state of war against them, requiring precau,  
&#x27; tions on their part, had conmmenced,; no con­  
‘du@ has béen imputed to them, which  
could vindicate _the necessity of maintaia­  
“in§ in force the Préfident’s proclamation.es  
~Since that@ime {uch of those a@«uuhm

- gardlefs of their duties towards a state in  
amity with their {ov@reign, and had they  
not carefully reprefied the feelings its tone  
and language had a”dire&amp; tendency to pro­  
voke in them, would have rather excited,  
than have averted the evils it was stated to  
be intended to prevent ; were they regard­  
ful of these dutics, it was unnecessary. Had  
they felt themselves obliged completely to  
¢vacuate the waters of the United States,  
especially whillk an enemy’s squadron was  
hacbored in them, they could ba ¢ doue it ;  
but under the admission of heftile ‘tompul­  
fion, and under such compulfion,earried in­  
to fuill effect, his majesty could not have dis­  
sembled the extent of the mjury received.  
In the several cases adduced, in. whici G,  
Britain required certain preliminaries, pre­  
vioully to entering into negociation, the re­  
gulated her condu by the fame principles  
to which she now adheres, and refufed, .  
whillt no hostility was cxhibited on her  
part, to treat with powers, whose proceed­  
ings denoted it towdards her ; and who  
maintained their right in what they had  
assumed: d  
From the considerations thus offered, I  
trufl that neither the order of reason or that  
of usage are in contradiction to the demand  
I have urged, nor am I aware how the or­  
der of time oppafes the revocation in the  
firft instance of that a&amp;t, whick affects injus=  
riouflly one of ‘the parties and is still avow­  
¢d by the othigr. ; ‘  
The subject if thus presented to you, fir,  
in the hght which it was natural that it  
should offer itfelf to his majesty’s govern-  
Ment. It certainly conceived the President’s  
proclamation $ rest chiefly, and most ma­  
terially upon the artack made upon the fri­  
gate of the U, States, the Cheiapeake, by  
bis majetty’s ship, the Leopard, although  
other topics were adduced as acceflorics.—  
In this apprehension it may be held to have  
been [ufficiently warranted, by the precise  
time at which, and the circumstances under  
which it was iffucd, and by s whole cen­  
text, and the more so, as the impulse under  
which it was drawn up, appearsto have  
been so {udden as to have preciuded a due  
*examination of all the grounds of aliegation  
contained in it. And here I beg leave to  
afiure you, that with respect to the spirit  
and tone of that inltrument, it would be  
highly fatisfaclofy to me, if I could fee) my--  
felf jutificd in exprefling on the part of his  
majelty any degree of coincidence with the  
opinions you have announced, or when thus  
appealed &#x27;to, and making every allowaitce  
for theArritation of the moment, I could  
.difemble the extreme furprize experienced  
by G. Brjain, that the government of a  
friendly pation, even bhefore an amicable  
demand of reparation was made, and yet  
meaning to make that.demand, (hould have  
issued an edi&amp; dire&amp;ing measures of injury  
very disproportionate to what it knew was  
an unauthorized offence, and basth in its  
terms and its purpert {o injurious to the  
government to which that demand was to  
be addrefled, and tending to call forth in  
both- nations, the feelings under which 2  
fricndly adjultment would be the most diffi­  
cult. Butif, as’l learn from you, fir, the  
proclamation rests substantially on other  
caufcs, it is then, peculiarly te be regretted,  
that, together with&#x27;the demand for redress  
made in September lalt, the government of  
the U. States did not think fit to offer a ne­  
gociation, or an explination of so momen­  
tous a measure, or to declare that its recall  
must be more_ or less connedted with the  
adjustment ;}‘othcr alleged&quot;wrongs. Nei­  
ther did i¢ think it peceffary to return any  
answer to the remonstrance given in by his  
majelty’s envoy at Wafhiagton, on the 13th  
July, 1807, in which he reprefcnted that  
he considered that interdiction to be so un­  
friendly in its objet, and so injurions in its  
confcquences to his majesty’s interefls, that  
he could not rcfrain from exprefling the  
molt sincere regret that it ever thould have  
been issued, and most carncitly deprecating  
its being enforced.” - 3 “dk  
It could not be [uppofed that a circum­  
stance of so great weight could be overlook­  
ed by his majelly’s government, in deter-  
N . . .  
minating the line of condu&amp; to be held in  
the negociation: and as little could it be  
expected Eo’ pass it over, when on the failure  
of theidifcuflion with Mr. Menroe, it direé­  
ed a {peciat miflion tobe sent to the United  
States. It had the less reason to imagine  
that any other gricvances could be con­  
nected with that for the adjustment of whick  
[am empov ed to negociate, as Mr. Mon­  
roe, in his leiter to Mr. Canning of theizgrh  
of July last, had stated with refped to other  
subjects of remonstrance, that it was im­  
proper to mingle them with tlae_ﬁrcfc‘pt  
more serious cause of complaint ; ali opin­  
“jon to which Mr. Canning declared his per­  
fcck assent in his letter to that minister of  
the 2d of the subsequent month 5 so ‘that  
&#x27; this act was left as ﬁ,ngtc and diﬂim.&amp;,-tc;bc‘  
singly and distinctly confidercd. &#x27; His majef­

that my government will be the more easily

inference arising from paflagesin Mr. Mone

29th of September las, that the differences  
ushappily existing between the two nations  
were in a train of adjufiment.  
1f his majefly has not permitted me to en  
ter into the difevfficn of the search of neus  
tral merchant {hips for British {fcamen, to­  
gether with the adjustment of the amouns  
of reparation for the attack npon the Chel­  
peake 5 il Vas neswife with a viewof pree  
| cluding the further ‘agitation of that quefs  
“tion at a suitable tine ; bat it was that the  
nggeciation might be elieved from the eme  
barrafimcot arising frop the connc&amp;ion of  
the present matter with the one {o foreign  
to it, 2nd, as it was but too well known, so  
difficult to bLe adjuftedy of a right distinctly  
disclaimed, with one which Great Britain  
has at all times aflerted of enforcing her  
claim, to the services of her natural born  
fubje&amp;s, when found on board merchang  
velfieis of other nations; a claim which the  
founds in that principle of nniverfal law,  
which gives to the slate the right of requir~  
ing the aid and ailiftance of her native citi=  
zens The recurrence, therefere, to that  
course of negociation, which had been orie  
ginally fettled between Mr. Secretary, Can­  
ning-and Mr. Monroe, and which had beenn  
‘alone broken in upon by the orders fubfe  
quently reccived by that minister, cau only  
be considered as a resumption of that cotirfe  
-of things which Great Britain strenuously  
contended there” was no ground tordepart  
from. -1 may observe, that this purpose  
might have been effe@ed without the intere  
‘veution of a {pecial minister,  
It will be in your recolletion, fir, that in  
our firft interview, I stated the condition,  
which makes the {ubject&#x27;of the present lets  
ter, befogg I was informed by you, that the  
Prefident™of the United States would con~  
sent to the fcparation of the two subjects.  
I had trufied that the exposition, which 1  
added in my letter of the 26th of January,  
to the verbal explanation I had before of­  
fered, of the grounds of bis majclty’s de=  
mand, was both in its purport, and in thg  
terms in which it was couched, such as to  
prevent a suspicion that they were in their  
intention derogatory o the honor, or calcu­  
lated to wound the jult sensibility of this  
nation. I may add that such a supposition  
could not be reconciled with the various  
ostensible and untquivocal demenftrations  
of bis mzinfy’sgoud faith apd anxicty, thag  
this tranfadion .should be brought to an  
amicable tevmination, which wereexhibited  
cven prier to any remonstrances- on the  
part,or by order of this goveroment. &#x27; The  
other topics which 1 felt myfelf authnriged  
to advante in that letter, in iluftration of  
that amicable disposition on&#x27;the part of the  
king, were brought forward from the con­  
viction I ¢ntertained that they must be of  
a nature to -be farist-Qory to this govern­  
ment, and therelore, such as it was particu­  
larly my duty to enforce; but not with a  
view to relt upan them the right to advance  
the claim which I have flgted. :  
I may here remark, ® s obvious that fae  
from requiring that the-fir® fieps towards  
an arrangement of reparation thould be ta­  
ken by the Urited States, Great Britain has  
alrcady made them openly and diftinétly s  
they are indubitable testimonies -to the re=  
{pc&amp; borne and decidedly macked by Greax  
Britain, to the ties cf amity [ubfifting be­  
tween the two nations,and of her cordial  
desire to maintain them unimpaired ; and as  
such aloue they were urged.  
As his majelty would have derived sincere  
fatisfaion from the evidence of correfpdn­  
ding feelings on the part of the United  
States, {0 it would: be the more painful to  
me to dwell upon a ferics of insults and me~  
naces which, without any&#x27; provocation of  
warlike -preparation on the part of Great  
Britain, have been for months accumulated  
upon her through the U states,and but too  
ff“l“TC“‘lY from quarters whose auth:’rity  
necetflarily and powerfully commanded at­  
tentios. e : : v  
I ought, perhaps, to apologize for advert-.  
ing to an incidental expreflion in your let=  
ter, if T did not think it right to remcve any  
ambiguity refpe@ing the nature of the claim  
which G. Britain maintained to her seamen,  
native citigens of the réalm, who have de­  
serted from Her fenwite to that of other  
powers : it is, that on demand they {hall  
be discharged forthwith and consequently  
they thallipftand!y be freed from their new­  
.}y ecoutradked obligations, . - ¥

and the renewed affurnne-s of his;  
Majv&#x27;fty’s amicable difpnfition, bur j  
after fecuritv has been given in a I  
public inflrument bearing date the  
16th of Qdtober, 1807, that the  
claim to the feizure of defeTters from  
the national lhips of other powers,  
cannot again be brought forward by  
his M.ijefty’s naval officers; it is un­  
neoffiry to dwell upon the injury  
and indignity to which his majeltys  
fervice is expofe I, both as touching  
the frtedom and fecurity of corref­  
pondents of his agents and accredic­  
j ed mintllers in the United States, or  
as refulting from a meafure which in  
time of war, excludes the whole of  
his navy from all their ports, which  
t 4  
  
ports are completely open to the  
fleet® of his enemies: it will be fuf­  
fkient to obferve, that even where  
; exemptions from it arc granted, they  
! arc made fubjt£l to fuch conditions,  
: that of the three l^ft Britifh flu; s of  
war, which have entered thefe ports  
upon public bufuteis two of them,  
his majeily’s &lt;hip Statira having on  
board a miniller lent out for the ad- !  
juftment of the prefent differences, I  
and a fcoooner bearing difpsrches,  
in confequem s of fl^ir inability to  
procure pilots were obliged to enter  
thefe waters without 4*sch affi nance,  
and were expofed to confiderable  
danger. Great Britrin by the forms  
eltabiiflied, could repair the wrong  
committed, even to the fatisfaefion  
of the United States, no other wile  
than by the channel of negotiation ;  
yet fhc avowed diftinffly, that a  
wrong was committed, and that lhe  
was ready to make reparation for it;  
it cannot therefore be contended that  
the unavoidable delay of a&amp;ual re­  
paration fubjc&lt;fVed her ro the impn- i  
tation of perfiiling in an aggreflion,  
which was di (claimed from the firft ;  
il this is true, however much (lie will  
  
regret any impediment in the adjnit­  
ment of a difference, in which the  
feelings of a nation aie f&gt; materially  
interested ; can fhi* confidently with  
a due cart of her own honor and in­  
terdls, allow it to be conclude i on  
Iter part, under an adherence to a  
conduct, which has a decided char­  
ader cf enm ty in the proceedings  
held toward? her b&#x27;’ tne other party ?  
1 know not m what view the prr­  
(Ircianct in the President&#x27;s procia*  
mati n up t* this moment can be  
confidered but in that of a mcafure  
i f retaliation j or of telf-afiumed re­  
paration j or a mcafure int ruled to  
compel a reparation \ rnilefs it be that  
which, it i rightly undcrftamJ, y &gt;u de­  
fine it to be, a mcafure of precaution.  
If, when a wron^j «s committed,  
reta iatioi* is mflaruly reforted to by  
the injured party, the door to pacific  
adjustment is doted, and the means  
of conciliation are precledcn. i he  
right to demand reparation is incom­  
patible with the affumption of it.  
When parties are in a ftatc of mutu­  
al hoftility, they are fo far on a foot­  
ing, and as fuch they may treat ; but  
a party declaiming every unfriendly  
intention, and giving unequivocal  
prootfc of an amicable difpofitiou,  
cannot be expected to treat with an­  
other ’vhofc condu£X towards it has  
the dired t ff ds of adual holtihty.  
If fhtn the enforcement of the Prefi­  
dent’f proclamation up to the prefent  
moment, is a rr.eafure of felf-afTumed  
reparation, it is dirrdly repugnant to  
the Ipirit and fad of ami* able nego­  
  
Marion .* if it is a rneafuru to con»pel  
reparation it is equally fo : and by  
the perfevetance ir\ it, Great Britain  
is dilpenfcd with the duty of proffer­  
ing redrefs. But if it is a mtafure of  
precaution, in order to femre repara­  
tion, or in order to compel it, it fall*  
under the obje&amp;ion* I have juft Ha­  
ted It it ib a nieiture of precaution  
adopted as a guard againft a&lt;Hs of vi­  
ol&#x27;nee apprehended on the part of his  
majefty s naval officers, it furely can­  
not be confulc-red as b“ing as effectu­  
al a fecurity as that arifing from the  
renewed . flu i a tiers of his majefty**  
fiiendly difpofition, which imply a  
due obfervance of the right* of na­  
tion* with which Great Britain is in  
amity, by all per ions holding authori­  
ty under his majefty** government *  
fr©m the difavowal of the pretenfton  
of the fearch of national flops ; and  
from the further affiirancc of that  
difavowal given in his majefty’s pro­  
clamation of the iCth of October  
lalt : neither under thefc concurrent  
circumftanccs can the plea of ncccf­  
fjty be maintained ; and if fuch a  
proceeding has not the plea of necef­  
fity, it aflumes the character of ag­  
greffion. If thefe concurrent fccuri­  
tie* againft fuch an apprehenflon  
have any value, the neceffity no Ion  
ger exilts: if they are of no value,  
negotiation cannot be attempted, as  
the bafts upon which it reft*, the mu­  
tual confidence of the two part.es,  
would be wholly wanting.

CONCLUSION OF A LfcTtFfc  
From Mr; Role to Mr. Madison.  
FROM the moment after the un­  
fortunrte affair of the Che fa peake,  
that his majefty’s naval commanders i  
in thefe waters had ascertained that i  
they were fafe from the eftcrvefcencc j  
of that popular fury, and under ,  
which the mofl glaridg duf rages j  
\Vere committed, &#x27; and which theV j  
were Very naturally led to the fuppo­  
fition th ‘ they were obje£ls of par­  
ticular hoflility, and that a Rate of  
war againit them, requiring precau­  
tions on their part, had commenced,  
no conduct has been imputed to them  
which could vindicate the necellity  
of maintaining in force the prefi­  
dent’s proclamation. Since that  
time fuch of thofe officers as have  
been neceflitated by the circumftan­  
ces of the war to run. lin in thefe  
waters, have held no communica­  
tion with the fhore, except in an in­  
ftance too trifling to dwell upon, and  
inllantly difavowed by the command­  
ing officer ; and they have acqui­  
tfeed quietly in various privations,  
highly prejudicial to the feiVice they  
were upon, and in confequence of an  
interdict, which had they been re­  
gardless of their duties towards a  
Rate in amity with their Sovereign,  
and had they not carefully repreiled  
the feelings its tone and language  
had a direct tendency to provoke in  
them, would rather hav* excited,  
[  
  
than hav £ averted the evils it was da­  
ted to be intended to prevent ; were  
they regardful of thefe duties, it was  
unneceiury Had they felt them­  
ferves obliged completely to evacu­  
ate the waters of the United States,  
efpecially whilst an enemy’s fquad­  
ron was harbored in them, they  
could havc^done it; but under the  
ad million hoftik compulfion, and  
under futa compulfion carried into  
full effeCt, his Majedy could not  
have diflrmbledthv sxtem of the in­  
jury received.  
In the fcverrl Cafes adduced, in  
which Great Britain required certain  
preliminaries, previoufly to entering  
into negociation, fhe regulated her  
conduct by the fame principles to  
which die now adheres, and refufed,  
whild no hodility was exhibited on  
her part, to treat with powers, whofe  
proceedings denoted it towards her j  
and who maintained their rights in  
w&#x27;hat they had aflumed.  
From the confulerations thus oflfer­  
ed, I ttud that neither the order of  
reafon or that of ufage are in contra­  
diction to the demand I have urged,  
nor am I aware how the order of  
time oppofes the revocation in the  
fird indance pf that aCk, which ef­  
feCts mjurioufly one of the parties  
and is dill avowed by the other.  
  
me lQDjcct is thus pretented to ,  
you, fir, in the light which it was  
natural that it fhpulJ offer itfelf to  
his majefty’s government. It cer­  
tainly conceived the prefident’s proc­  
lamation to reft chiefly, and mod  
materially upon the attack made up­  
on the frigate of the Uuitcd Srttes,  
the Chefipeake, by his majefty’s (hip  
the Leopard, although other topics  
^erc adduced as acceff iries. In this  
apprchenfion it may be held to have  
b&#x27;-en fufBcicntly warranted, by the  
precife time at which, and the cir- i  
an^Jiy its whole Chute It, and the  
m6re fo, as the impulfe under which  
it was drawn up, appears to have j  
been fo fudden as have precluded a  
due examination of all the grounds  
of allegation contained in it. And  
here 1 beg leave to alTure you, that  
w ith refped to the fp;rit and tone of  
that inftrument, it would be highly  
fatisfa&amp;nry to me, if I could feel  
myfeli jultiiied in exprefTing on the  
yart oi his majefty any degree of I  
coincidence with the opinions vou  
have announced, or when thus ap­  
pealed to, and making every allow­  
ance for the irritation of the mo­  
ment, 1 could diffemble the extreme  
furprife experienced by Gieat-Bri- j  
tain, that the government of a friend- •  
ly nation, even before an amicable de­  
mand of reparation was made, and j  
yet meaning to make that demand, 1  
ihould have iffued an edi£\ directing  
meafures of injufy very difpropor­  
  
tionate to what it knew was an un­  
authorised offence, and both in its  
term? and its puiport fo injurious to  
the government to which that de­  
mane! was to be addrefled, and tend­  
ing to call forth in both nations, the  
feelings Under which a friendly ad­  
juffcment would be the moft: difficult.  
13ut if, as I learn from you, fir, the  
proclamation refte fubflantially on  
other CaufeS, it is then peculiarly to  
be regretted, that, together with the  
demand for redrefs made in Septem­  
ber lait, the government of the U­  
niteu States did not think fit to offer  
a negotiation, or an explanation of  
fo momentuous a meafure, or to de­  
clare that its recall mult be more or  
lefs connected with the adjuftment  
of other alledged wrongs.—Neither  
did it think it neceffary to return any  
snifwer to the remonitrance given in  
by his majelty’s envoy at Walhing­  
ton, on the 13th July, 1807, in  
which he represented “ that he con­  
fidefed &#x27;hat interdiction to be un­  
friendly in its object, and (o injurious  
in its confequences to his majelty’s  
interefts, that he could not refrain  
from expreffing the moft liircere re­  
| gret, that it ever ihonld have b*en  
! iffued, and moft earneftly depreca­  
ting its being enforced.”  
It could not be foppofed that a  
CkrcwnltanM of fo great weight  
I 1  
  
could be overlooked by fis majefty’s  
government, in determining the line  
t)f conduct to be held in the ncgo­  
| tiation and as little could it be ex­  
1 peded to pafs it over, when on the  
; failure of the djfcutfion with Mr.  
1 Monroe, it d*red«d a fpecial mifliQn  
to be lent to the United States. It  
had the lefs reafon to imagine that  
any other grievances could be con­  
neded with that for the adjuftment of  
which I am empowered to negotiate,  
, as Mr Monroe, in his letter to Mr.  
| Canning of the of July laft,  
! had ftated with rel&#x27;ped to other fub­  
j jeds of remonftrance, that it was  
improper to mingle them with the  
| prefent more ferious caufe of com- ;  
! plaint \ an opinion to which Mr.  
| Canning declared his perfed aflent |  
in his letter to that minifter of the }  
2d of the fubfequent month ; fo  
that this ad was left as fingle and ■  
diftind, to be fingly and diftindlv |  
conftdered. His majefty’s govern­  
ment, therefore, could not confident­  
ly with any view of the fubjed then  
before it, or indeed with the iuft ob­  
1 rv r • /r* «. M -  
  
jcci or my minion, direct or empow­  
er me to enter upon matters connedf- |  
ed with that of the Chefapeake : &amp;  
they could with the lefs propriety do 1  
it, as in order to render the adjufl­  
ment of differences of fuch a nature,  
the more eafy and the more confpit­  
uous, the miniftfcrs charged efpeciaily ;  
with fuch offices have been, with few  
if any exceptions, reflridled to the ji  
precife affair to be negociatcd.— |  
With refpcdf therefore to thofe oth­  
er caufes of complaint, upon which  
you inform me that the Prefulent’s ]  
proclamation refh, I cannot be fur- i  
nifhed with documents enabling me i  
either to admit or to controvert thofc I  
ftatements of grievance, foreign to i  
the attack upon that (hip. contained !  
in your letter, or authonfed to dif- j  
therefore nor allow myTeTt to offer i  
fuch comments as my perfonal ]  
knowledge of fome of thofc tranf­  
a&amp;ions fuggeft to me, although their i  
tendency would materially affc&amp;both &lt;  
the marked manner in which thofe &lt;  
tranfa&amp;iuns are pourtrayed, and the i  
disadvantageous lights in which his 4  
majclty’s^government is reprefented &#x27;  
to have adted refpedting them. I am &lt;  
moreover led to the perfuafioh that (  
my government will be the more ea- i  
fdy able to refeue itfelf from incul- 1  
pation, By the inference ariflng from 1  
paflages in Mr. Monroe’s letter to 4  
Mr. Secretary Canning, of the 29th ;  
of September laft, that the differen­  
ces unhappily exiting between the ;  
two nations were in a train of ad- i  
iuftment. , b  
  
It his majelty ha§ not permitted  
me to enter into the dilcufflon of the  
fcarch of neutral merchant (hips for  
Britith feamen, together with the ad­  
juftment of the amount of repara­  
tion for the attack upon the Chefa­  
peake ; it was no wife with a view  
of precluding the further agitation of  
that queltion at a fiiitable time \ but  
it was that the negociation might be  
relieved from the embarraffm-ent a­  
rifing from the connection of the  
prefent matter with the orte fo for­  
eign (o it, and, as it was but too well  
known, fo difficult to be adjufted, of  
a right diftindtly difclaimed, with ofie  
which Great Britain has at all times  
aflerted of enforcing her claim to tfre  
fervices of her natural born fubjed-t*,  
when found on board merchant vef­  
fels of other natiens ; 2 claim which  
ihe founds in that principle of uni­  
verfal law, which gives to the (late  
the right of requiring the aid and af­  
fiftance of her native citizens. The  
recurrence, therefore, to that courfe  
of negociation, which had been orig­  
inally fettled between Mr. Secretary  
Canning and Mr. Monroe, &amp; which  
had been alone broken in upon by  
the orders fubfequently received by  
that minifter, can only be confidered  
as a refumption of that courfe of  
things which Great Britain ilrenu­  
oufty contended there was no ground  
to depart from. I may obferve, that  
this purpofe might have been effect­  
ed without the intervention of a fpe­  
cial minifter.  
  
It will be in your recolleflion, fir,  
that in our firft interview, I flatcd  
the condition, which makes the fub­  
je&amp; of the prefect letter, before I was  
informed by you, that the Prefident  
of the United States would confent  
to the reparation of the two fubjedts.  
I had trufted that the expofltion,  
which I had added in my letter o£  
the a6th January to the verbal ex­  
planation I h^1 before offered, of the  
grounds of his inajefty’s demand, was  
both in it* purport, Utnd in the form*  
in which it was couched, fuch as to  
prevent a fufpicicn that they were in  
their intention derogatory tollie hon­  
or, or calculated to wound the jufc  
fenfibility of thifc nation. I may add*  
that fuch a fuppofition could not be:  
reconciled with the Various oflenfi­  
ole and .unequivocal demonstration*  
of his majefty&#x27;s good faith and anxie­  
ty, that this tranfaction fhould be  
brought td In amicable termination,  
w hich were exhibited even prior to  
any remonftrartccS on the part, or byr  
order of this government. The oth­  
  
er copies wnicn i reel mylclr author­

tum, dated Washington, March 17, 1808S.  
Sin, ——Being deeply impressed with the  
sense of his majesty’s anxiety, that full effect  
should be given to those views of justice and  
moderation, by which his conduct has been  
regulated throngh the whole of the unfortu  
nate transaction whence the present differ-  
ences have arisen; and of the disappoint-  
ment with which he would learn the trus-  
tration of his just and equitable purposes, I  
have felt it incumbent upon me, upon the  
receipt of the Jetter which you did me the  
honou: to address to me on the 3th instant,  
to apply anew to this matter the most ample  
and serious consideration. It is with the  
most painful sensations of regret, that I find  
myself, on the result of it, under the neces-  
sity of declining to enter into the terms of  
negociation which, by direction of the Presi-  
dent of the United States, you therein offer.  
I do not feel myself competent, in the pre-  
sent instance, to depart from those instruc-  
tions which I stated in my letter of the 20th  
of Jan. last, and which preclade me from  
acceding to the condition thas proposed.—]  
should add, that I am absolutely prehibited  
from entering upon matters unconnected  
with the specific object Iam authorised to  
discuss, much less can I thus give any pledge  
concerning them. ‘Thecondition suggested,  
moreover, leads to the direct inference that  
the proclamation of the President of the U,  
States of the 3d of July, 1807, is maintained  
either a3 an equivalent for reparation for the  
time being, or as a compulsion to make it.—  
It is with the most profound regret, that J  
feel myself under the necessity of declaring  
that I am unable to act upon the terms thus  
proposed ; as it becomes my duty to inform  
ou, in conformily to my instructions, that  
  
  
  
  
  
former letter, on the part of his majesty, my  
mission is terminated. And his majesty’s  
government, in providing me with those in.  
structions, did not conceive that after the de-  
claration of his sentiments respecting the af-  
fair of the Chesapeake was made known ‘9  
the government, the state of any transacti, 1s  
pending or unterminated between the two  
nations, could justify the perseverance in the  
enforcement of the president’s proclamation,  
I can exercise no discretion on this point.—  
As on a former occasion | detailed, though  
minutely, the motives for that demand, on  
the part of his majesty, which I with so  
much concern learn to be deemed inadmis-  
sible by the government of the U. States; I  
  
should bere abstain from any exposition of  
them which visibly can have no further ef-  
fect upon the negociation, if I did not deem  
it essential that they should not be left under  
any misapprehension which I might be able  
toremove. I shall, therefore, take a short  
review of the transaction which has given  
rise to these discussions, in order the more  
correctly to determine the soundness of the  
principles upon which this demand is made.  
—Certain deserters from his majesty’s navy,  
many of them his natural-born subjects, hav-  
ing entered into the service of the U. States,  
were repeatedly and fruitlessly demanded by  
ihe Briti-h officers, of the recruiting officers  
of the U. States; but were retained in their  
new service. As it was a matter.of noto-  
riety that several of these deserters were on  
board the frigate of the U. States, the Che-  
sapeake, they were demanded of that frigate  
on the high seas, by his majesty’s ship Leo-  
pard, and all knowiedge of their presence on  
board being deuied, she was attacked, and  
four of them, one avowedly a native English-  
man, were taken out of her. Without be-  
ing deterred by the consideration of how far  
circumstances, hostile in their nature, bad  
provoked, though they undoubtedly by no  
means justified, this act of the British offi-  
cer, his majesty’s government directed that  
a positive disavowal of the rights of search  
asserted in this case, and of the act of the  
British officer, as being authorised, and a  
promise of reparation, should be conveyed to  
the American minister in London, before he  
had made any representation by order of the  
U. States. —This disavowal, made on the ad  
of Aug. last, was transmitted by him to his  
government, before the 6th of that month ;  
but before Mr. Munroe had received his oF  
ders to demand reparation, his majesty learnt,  
with what surprise it is needless to aie!  
upon, that the president of the U. States ha  
interdicted, by proclamation bearing date the

2d of July, 1807, the entry of all their ports  
tothe whole of his navy ;  
certainly increased, when in the letter deli-  
vered by that minister to require redress for  
the wrong, although it went into details un-  
connected with it, not only no concern was  
expressed on the part of the U. States, at  
having felt themselves compelled to enact  
measures of so much inj ry and indignity  
towards a friendly power, but no mention  
was made of the causes of such measures  
being resorted to, or even of the fact of their  
having been adopted. In addition to the  
embarrassment arising from these circom-  
stances, and the insufhciency ef the explana-  
fions subsequently given to Mr. Canning,  
the introduction of a subject foreign to that  
otf the compiaint, became the main impedi-  
ment tothe success of the discussion which  
took place in London. When I had the  
honour to open the negociation with you,  
Sir, as I had learnt that the proclamation  
was still in force, it became my duty, con-  
formably to my instructions, to require its  
recall, as a preliminary to further discussion ;  
had it not been in force, | was not ordered to  
have taken it into consideration in the ad-  
justment of reparation; and it was consider-  
ed as hardly possible that it shoul! not have  
been recalled immediately upon the know-  
ledge of his majesty’s disavowal of the at-  
tack upon the Chesapeake, as an uneutho-  
rised act. But his majesty cou&#x27;d not suffer the  
negociation to be carried on, in his behalf,  
under an interdict, which, even if justifiable  
in the first moments of irritation, cannot be  
continued after the declaration of his majes-  
ty’s sentiments upon the transaction, except  
in the spirit of hostility. ——It might have  
been fairly contended, that in the first in-  
stance, the exercise of an act of power, be-  
fore reparation was refused unduly pro-  
tracted, was incompatible with the purposes  
and essence of pacific negociation, and with  
a demand of redress through that channel ;  
but such have been his majesty’s conciliatory  
views, that this argument has not been in-  
sisted on, although it wight now be the more  
forcibly urged, as it appears that the govern-  
ment of the U. States was from the first sen-  
sible that, even had hostility been meditated  
by the British government, it would not have  
commenced it in suchamanner. But the  
exception taken is to the enforcement con-  
tinued up to the preseut time, of measures  
higaly unfriendly in their tendency, persisted  
in, not ouly after the disavowal in question,  
the promise of the profter of suitable repara  
tion, and the renewed assurances of his ma-  
jesty’s atnicable dispositions, but after secu-  
ritv has been given in a public instrament  
  
this surprise was  
  
  
  
  
  
Official Papers fos6  
  
bearing cate of the 10th of Oct. 1807, that  
the claim to the seizure of deserters trom the  
national ships of other powers, € annot agvain  
be brought forward by his majesty’s naval  
oflicers, it is unnecessa ry to dwell upon the  
injury and indignity to which his ma jesty&#x27;s  
service is exposed, both as touching the  
freedom and security of correspondence of  
his agents, and accredited ministers in the  
U. States, or as resulting from a measure,  
which, in time of war, excludes the whole of  
his navy from all their ports; which ports  
are Comp letely open to the fleets of his ene-  
mies. It will be suilicient to observe, that  
even where exemptions from it are granted,  
they are made si bject to such conditions,  
that of the tbdree last British ships of war,  
which have entered these ports upon pad lic  
business, two of them, his majesty’s ship  
Statira, having on board a minister sent out  
for the adjustment of the present diflerences  
anda schooner be: ing disp: iiches, in conse.  
quence ¢ f their inability to procure pilots,  
vere obliged to enter their waters without  
such assistance, and were exposed to consi-  
derable danger. Great Britain, by the forms  
established, — repair the wrongs commit-  
ted, even to the sati isfi iction of the U. Stat 5,  
no otherwise than by the channel of nego-  
ciation; yet she avowed distinctly, that  
wrong was committed, and that she was  
ready to make reparation; it cannot there-  
fore be contended, that the unavoidable de-  
lay of actual reparation subjected her to the  
imputation of persisting in an aggression,  
which was disclaimed from the first; if this  
is true, however much she will regret any  
impediment in the adjustment of a difference  
in which the feelings of this nation are so  
materially interested, can she, consistently  
with a due care of her own honour and inte-  
reste, allow it to be concluded ow her part  
under an adherence to a conduct, which has  
a decided character of enmity in the proceed-  
ings held towards her by the other party ?—  
I know not in what view the perseverance  
in the president&#x27;s proclamation, up to this  
moment, can be considered, but in that of a  
measure of retaliation; or of self-assumed  
reparation; or of a measure intended to  
compel reparation; unless it be that which,  
if i rightly understand you define it to be, a  
measure o! prec dation. —If, when a wrong is  
committed, ret aliation is instantly re aude to  
by the injared party, the door to pacific ad-  
yuste nent i is closed, an id the means of recon-  
ciliation precluded. The right to demand  
reparation is inc compatible with the assump  
tion of it.—When parties are in a state of  
mutual hostit ility, they are so far on a footing,  
sud as such they may treat. But a party dis

claiming every unfriendly intention and  
giving unequivocal proofs of an amicable  
disposition, cannot be expected to treat with  
another, Whose conduct towards it has the  
direct effects of actual hostility. If then,  
the enforcement of the president&#x27;s proclama-

of self-assumed reparation, it is directly re-  
pugnant to the spirit and fact of amicable ne-

in the first instance of that act, which affects  
injurionsly one of the parties, end is sti  
avowed by the other —The subject is thus  
presented to you, Sir, in the Jight in which it  
was natural that it should offer itselt to his  
majesty’s government. It certainly con-  
ceived the president’s proclamation to rest  
chiefly and most materially opon the attack  
made upon the frigate of ihe U. States, the  
Chesapeake, by lis majesty’s ship I eopard,  
although other topics were adduced as acces-  
saries. In this apprehension i may be held  
to have been sutlicienily warranted by the  
precisetime at which, and the circumstances  
under which it was issaed, and by tts whole  
context; and the more so as the impulse  
inder which, it was drawn up appears to  
ave been so sudden as to have precluded a  
due examination of all the grounds ot allega-  
tion cantained in it. And here I beg leave  
to assure you, that with respect to the spit  
aud tone of that instrument, it would be  
highly satisfactory to me, if I could feel my-  
self justified in expressing, on the part of hus

that demand, should bave issued an edict,  
directing measures Of injury very dispropor-  
tionate to what it knew was an unauthorised  
ottence, and both in its terms and its pur-  
port so injurious to the government to w hich  
that demand was to be addresse -d, and tend-  
ms to call forth in both nations the feelings  
der which a friendly adjustment would be  
the most difficult. But if, as [learn trom  
you, Sir, the proclamation rests substantially  
upon other causes, it is then peculiarly to be  
reeretted, that, together with the demand  
fur redress made in Sept. last, the govern-  
ment of the U. States did not thiak tit to of-  
fer a negociation or an explanation of so  
momentous a measure, or to declare that its  
recal] must be mere or less connected with  
the adjustment of other alledged wrongs.  
Neither did it think necessary to return any  
answer to the remonstrance given in by lis  
majesty’s envoy at Washington, on the 13th  
July, 1807, in which be rej  
he considered that interdiction to be so un-  
frie ndly in its ob ject, and s« peda mous tn its  
consequences to bis m. i ‘sty 5 inicrests, t that  
he could not refrain from expressing the  
most sincere regret, that it ever should have  
been issued, and most earnestly de;  
its being enforced.” It could not be sup  
posed that a circumstance of so great weight  
could be overlooked by his majesty&#x27;s govero-  
ment, in determining the line of conduct to  
be held iu the negeciation; and as little  
could it be expected to pass it over, wheo  
on the failure of the discussion with Mr.  
Munroe, it directed a special mission to be  
sent to the U. Siaies. It had the less reason  
tu imagine that any other grievances could be  
connected with that  
which I am empowered to negociate, as Mr,  
Munroe in bis letter to Mr. Canning of the  
29th of July last, had stated with respect to  
other subjects of remonstrance, that it was  
improper to mingle them with the present  
more serious cause of complaint ; an opinion  
towhich M.Canning declared his pertect assent  
in his letter to that minister of the 2d of the  
subsequent mont h; so that this act was left-as  
single and distinct, to be singly and distinctly  
considered. His majesty’s gov ernment there-  
fore could not, consistently with any view of  
the subject then before it, or indeed with the  
just object of my missien, direct or empower  
me to enters Lpon matters not connected  
with that of the Chesapeake ; and they could

vernment will be the more easily able  
cue itself from ioculpation by the inferences  
arising trom passages in Mr. Munroe&#x27;s letters  
to Mr. Secretary Canning,  
Sept. last, that the diflerences uohappily  
subsisting between the two nations were 1a  
a train of adjustment.——It bis majesty has  
not permitted me toenter into the discussion  
of the search of neutral merchant ships for  
British seamen, together with the adjustment  
of the amount of reparation for the aitack  
upon the Chesapeake, it was in no wise with  
a view of precluding the further agitation of  
that question at a suitable time; but it was  
that the negociation might be relieved from  
the embarrassment arising from the connex -  
ion of the present matter with the one so fo-  
reign to it, and as it was but too weil known,  
  
su difficult to be adjusted, of a right distinet-  
ly disclaimed, with one which G. Britaia has  
at all tinve asserted, of entorcing ber claim  
to the services of her natural-born subjects,  
when found on board merchant vessels of  
other nations; aclains which she founds in  
that principle of universal law, which gives  
to the state the right of requiring the aid and  
assistance of her native citizens. ‘The recur-  
rence, therefore, to that course of negocia-  
tion, which bad been originally settled be-  
tween Mr. Secretary Canning and Mr.Mon-  
  
roe, and which had alone been broken in  
upon by the orders subsequently received by  
that minister, can only be considered as a ree

Brita.o strenuously contended there was no  
ground to depart from, I may observe that  
this purpose might have been effected with-

ter, before I was informed by you that the  
president of the U, States would consent to  
the separation of the two subjects—I had  
  
my letter of the 25th of Jan., to the verbal  
  
explanation | had before oftered, of the |  
  
gro nds of his majesty’s demand, was both  
in its purport, and in the terins in which it  
was couched, such as to prevent a suspicion  
that they were in their intention dercgatory  
to the honour, or calculated to wound the  
just sensibility of the naticn. I may add,  
that such a supposition could not be recon-  
ciled with the various ostensible and unequi-  
vocal demonstrations of his majesty’s good  
faith and anxiety, that this transaction sheuld  
be brought to an amicable termination,  
which were exhibited even prior to any re-  
monsirances on the part, or by order of this  
  
government. ‘lhe other topics which [ felt  
  
myself authorized to advance in that letter,  
in illustration of that amicable disposition on  
the part of the King, were brought forward  
from the conviction I entertained that they  
must be of a nature to be satisfactory to this  
government, and therefore such as it was  
particularly my duty to enforce, but not  
with a view to rest upon them the right to  
advance the claim which I have stated. — I  
may here remark, it is obvious that far from  
requiring that the first step towards an ar-  
rangement of reparation should be taken by  
the U.States, G. Britain has already made  
them openly and distinctly: they are indu-  
bitable testimonies to the respect borne and  
decidedly marked by G. Britain, to the ties  
of amity subsisting between the two nations,  
and of her cordial desire to maintain them  
unimpaired: and as such alone they were  
urged.—As his majesty would have derived  
sincere satisfaction trom the evidence of cor-  
responding feelings on the part of the U.  
States, so it would be the more painful for  
me to dwell upon a series of insults and me-  
naces, which without any provocation or  
warlike preparation on the part of G. Bri-  
tain, have been for months accumulated up-  
on her through the U. States, and but too  
frequently from quarters whose authority  
necessarily and powerfullycommanded atten-  
tion.—I ought perhaps to apologize for ad-  
verting to an incidental expression in your  
letter, if I did not think it right to remove  
any ambiguity respecting the nature of the  
claim which G. Britain maintained to her  
seainen, native citizens of the realm, who  
have deserted from her service to that of  
other powers: it is, that on demand they  
shall be discharged forthwith, and conse-

quently, they shall instantly be freed from  
their newly contracted obligations.—Before  
I close this letter, allow me to state to you,  
Sir, that I have felt it my duty to transmit  
to his majesty’s government, the €Xposition  
contained in your letter of the 5th inst of  
the various demands on the honour and good  
faith of G. Britain, on which the complaint  
is made, that satisfaction has not been af-  
forded to the U. States, and on which, con-  
jointly with the afiair of the Chesapeake,  
you informed me that the proclamation of  
the president of the U. States of the 2d of  
July, 1807, is founded. It will be for his  
majesty’s government to determine, on the  
part of G. Britain, whether any and what  
obligations remain to be fulfilled by her—  
whether any denial or such protraction of re-  
dress have occurred on her part, as to render  
necessary or jtistifiable the perseverance in  
an edict, which, when not necessary or jus-  
tifiable, assumes a character of aggression ?  
And whether on the result of these conside-  
rations, the present negociation can be re-  
sumed on the part of his majesty, with a due  
regard for his own bosour, or with a pros-  
pect of a more successful termination. i

Certain deserters from his majesty’s navy, manv  
of them his natural born subjects, having entered  
into the service of the United States, were repeated-  
ly and fruitlessly demanded by the British officers,  
of the recruiting officers of the United States;  
but were retained in their new service. As it was’  
a matter of notoricty, that several of these deserters  
were on board the trigate of the United States the  
Chesapeake, they were demanded of that frigate  
on the high seas, by his majesty’s ship Leopards  
and all knowledge of their presence on board being  
denied, she was attacked, and four of them, one  
avowedly a native-Englishman, were taken out of  
her. Without being deterred by the consideration  
of how far circumstances hostile in their nature,  
had provoked, though they undoubtedly by no  
means justified this act of the British officer, his  
majesty’s government directed that a positive disa-  
vowal of the right of search asserted in this case;  
and of the act of the British officer, as being au-  
thorised, and a promise of reparation, should be  
conveyed to the American minister in London,  
before he had made any representat:on by order of  
the United States. |

for the time being, or as a compulsion to make it.  
It is with the more profound regret, that I feel  
myself under the necessity of declaring, that I am  
unable to act upon the terms thus proposed; as it  
becomes my duty to inform you, in conformity to  
my instructions, that on the rejection of the de-  
mand stated in my former letter on the part of his

the state of any transactions pending or uniermina-

severance in the enforcement of the president’s pro-

paration; and it was considered as haraiy poss.le  
that it shouid not have been recailed immediate:,  
upon ihe knowledge of his majesty’s disavowel of  
the attack upon the Chesapeak, as an authorised  
act. But his majesty could not suffer the negocia-  
tion to be carried on in his behaif, under an _inter-  
dict, which even if justifiable in tne first moment of  
irritation, cannot be coniinued after the declaration  
of his majesty’s sentiments upon the transaction,  
except in a spirit of hostility.  
  
It might aave been turiy contended, that in the  
first instance, the exercise of such anact of power,  
before reparation was refused or unduly protracted,  
  
yas incompatable with the purposes and essence oi  
Pacific negociation, and with a demand of redress  
through that channel: bu: such have been bis ma-  
jesty’s conciliatory views that this argument has not  
been insisted on, ‘although it might now be more  
force biy urged, as it appears that the government of  
the United States was from the first sensible that  
even had hostility been meditated by the British go-  
vernment, it would not have commenced in such  
a manner.  
forcement contmued up io the present time, of}  
measures highiy unfmendly in their tendency, per-  
sisted in, not only after the disavowel in question;  
the promise of the proifer, of suitable reparation,  
and the renewed assurances of his majestey’s amica-  
ble dispositions, but, after security has been given  
in a public instrument bearing date of the 16th of  
Qciober, 1807, that the claim to the seizures of de-  
serters frora the national ships of other powers,  
cannot again be brought forward by his majesty’s  
naval officers, it is unnecessary to dwell upon the  
injt ry and indignity to wh: ch his m: jesty’s serv.ce  
is exposed both as touching the freedom and_secu-  
Tity of correspondents of his agents and accred:ted  
ministers in the United States, or as resulting from  
a measure which in time of war, excludes the whole  
of his navy from all their ports; which ports are  
coupiciely open to the fleets of his enemies. It  
wil be sufficient to observe, that even where exemp-  
tions from it are granted, they are made subject to  
stich conditions, that of the three last British ships  
of war, which have entered these ports upon public  
business, two of them, his majesty’s ship Statira,  
hav.ng on board a minister sent out for the adjust-  
ment of the present differences, and a schooner  
bearing dispatches, in consequence of their inabili-  
ty to procure pilots, were obliged to enter their  
waters without such assistance, and were exposed  
to considerable danger. Great Britain, by the forms  
established, could repair the wrongs committed,  
even to the satisfaction of the United States, no  
otherwise than by the channel of negociation: yet  
she avowed distinctly that a wrong was committed,  
and that she was ready to make reparation for it; it  
cannot therefore be contended, that the unavoidable  
delay of actual reparation, subjected her to the  
imputation of presisting in an aggression. which.  
was disclaimed from the first; if this is true, how-.  
ever much she will regret any impediment in the  
adjustment of a difference, in which the feelings of  
this nation are so materially interested, can she  
consistently with a due care of her own honor and  
interests, allow it to be concluded on her part under  
an adherence to a conduct which has a decided cha-  
racter of enmity in the proccedings held towards  
her by the other party.  
  
I know not in what view the perserverance in the  
president’s proclamation, up to this moment, can be  
considered, but in that of a measure of retaliation,  
or of self assumed reparation ; or a measure intend-  
e@to compel reparation; unless it be that which,

Sure Of precaution.  
  
li, when a wrong is committed, retaliation is  
instantly resorted to by the :njured party, the door  
to pacific adjustment is closed, and the means of  
reconciliation prechided. The right to demand re-  
paration is incompat.ble with the assumption of it.  
When parties are in a state of mutual hostility, they  
are so far on a footing, and as such they may treat :  
But a party disciaming every unfriendly intention:  
and giving unequivocal proofs of an amicable dispo-  
sition, cannot be expecied to treat with another,  
whose conduct towards it has the direct effect of  
aciuai hostility. If then, the enforcement of the  
president’s proclamation, up to the presentm oment,  
is a measure of self assumed reparation, it is directly  
repugnant to the spirit and fact of ameable negoci-  
ation; if it 1s a measure to compel reparation, it is  
equally so; and by the preseverance in it, Great  
Britain is dispensed with the duty of proffering re-  
dress. But if itis a measure of precaution, in or-  
der to secure reparation, or in order to compel it,  
it falls under the objections I have stated. If it isa  
precauuon adopted as a guard against acts of violence  
apprehended on the part of his majesty’s naval offit  
cers, it surely cannot be considered as being as ef-  
tectual a security as that arising from the renewed  
assurances of his majesty’s friendly disposition,  
which amply a due observance of the mghts of na-  
tions, with which G, Britain is in amity; by all  
persons hoiding authority under his majesty’s go-  
  
it tobe a met,’  
  
  
  
vernment, from the disavowel of the pretension of  
the search of national ships; and from the further  
assurance of that disavowel, given in his majesty’s  
proclamation of the 16th October last; neither un-  
der these concurrent circumstances can the piea of  
necessity be maintained, and if such a preceeding  
has not the plea of necessity, it assumes the charac-  
ter of aggression. If these concurrent securities  
against such an apprehension have any value, the  
necessity no longer exists; if they have no value,  
negociation cannot be attempted, as the basis upon  
which it rests, the mutual confidence of the two  
parties, would be wholy wanting.  
  
From the moment afier the unfortunate affair of  
the Chesapeake, that his majesty’s naval comman-  
ders, in these waters, had ascertained that they were  
sate from the effervescences of that popular fury,  
under which the most glaring outrage were com-  
mitted, and by which they were naturally led to the  
supposition that they were objects of particular  
hostility, and that a state of war against them, re-  
quiring precautions on their part, had commenced,  
no conduct has been imputed to them, which  
could vindicate the necessity of maintaining in  
force the president’s proclamation. Since that  
time such of those officers as have been necessitated  
by the circumstances of the war to remain in these  
waters, have held nocommunication with the shore,  
except in an instance too trifling to dwell upon, and  
  
  
  
instantly disavowed by the commanding officer ;  
and they have acquiesced quietly in various priva- ,  
tions, highly prejudicial to the service they were  
upon, and jin consequence of an interdict, which,  
had they been regardless of their duty towards a  
state in amity with their sovereign, and had they  
not carefully repressed the feclings its tone and lan-  
guage had a direct tendency to provoke in them,  
would have rather excited than averted the evils it  
was stated to be intended to prevent ; were they re-  
eardful of these duties, it was unnecessary. Had  
they felt themselves obliged completely to evacuate  
the w aters of the United States, especially while  
  
  
  
an gugmy’s squadron was harbored in them, they

vould have done; but under the admission of hos-  
tile compulsion, and under such compulsion, carri-.  
ed into full effect, his majesty could not have dis- |  
eembled the extent of the injury received.  
  
In the several cases adduced, in which Gr-at Bri-  
tain required certain preliminaries, previously to  
entering into negociation, she regulated her conduct  
by the same principles to which she now adheres;  
and refused, whilst no hostility was exhibited on  
her part, to treat with powers, whose proceedings  
denoted it towards her; and who maintained their  
right im what they assumed.  
  
From the consideration thus afforded, I trust  
that neither the order of reason, or that of usage,  
are in- contradiction to the demand I have urged,  
nor am I aware how the order of time opposes the  
revocation in the first instance, of that act, which  
affects injuriously one of the parties, and is still  
avowed by the other.  
  
The subject is thus presented to you, sir, in the  
light of which it was natural that it should offer it-  
self to his majesty’s government. It certatnly con-  
ceived the president’s proclamation to rest chiefly  
and most materially upon the attack made upon  
the ‘frigate of the United States the Chesapeake,  
by his majesty’s ship Leopard, although other to-  
pics were adduced as accessories. In this appre-  
hension it may be held to have been sufficiently  
warranted by the precise time at which, and the  
eircumstances under which it was issued, and by  
its whole context, and the more so, as the impulse  
under which it was drawn up appears to have been  
so sudden as to have precluded a due examination  
of all the grounds of allegation contained in it.—  
And here I beg leave to assure you, that with res-  
pect to the spirit and tone of that instrument, it  
would be highly satisfactory to me, if I could feel  
myself justified in expressing on the part of his  
majesty, any degree of coincidence with the opin-  
ions you have announced, ar when thus appealed  
to, and making every allowance for the irritation of  
the moment, I could dissemble the extreme sur-  
prise experieaced by Great Britain, that the go-  
vernment of a friendly nation, even before an ami-  
cable demand of reparation was made; and yet  
meaning to make that demand; should have issued  
an edict directing measures of injury very dispro-  
portionate to what it knew was an unauthorised  
offence, and both in its terms and its purport so  
injurious to the government to which that demand  
was to be addressed, and tending to call. forth in  
both nations the feelings under which a friendly ad-  
justment would be the most difficult. But if, as I  
learn from you, sir, the proclamation rests substan-  
tially upon other causes, it is then peculiarly to be  
regretted, that together with the demand for re-  
dress made in September last, the government of  
the United States did not think fit.to offer a nego-  
ciation or an explanation of so momentous a mea-  
sure, er to declare that its recall must be more or  
icss connected with the adjustment of other alledg-  
ed wrongs. Neither did it think necessary to re-  
tun any answer to the remonstrance given in by  
his majesty’s envoy at Washington, on the 13th of  
July, 1897, .in which he represented, “that he con-  
sidered that interdiction to be so unfriengly in its  
object, and so injurious in its consequences to his  
Majesty’s interest, that he could net refrain from-  
expressing the most sincere regret, that it ever  
should have been issued, aud mostearnestly depre-  
cating its being enforeed.”  
  
It could not be supposed that a cireumstance of,  
SO great weight could be overlooked by his majes-  
‘y&#x27;s government, in determining the line of conduct  
  
to be held in the negociation ; anid as little could it  
be expected to pass it over, when on the failure of  
the discussion with Mr. Munroe, it directed a spe-  
cial mission to be sent to the United States. It had  
the less reason to imagine that any othe grievances  
could be connected with that for the adjustment of  
which I am empowered to negociate, as Mr. Mun-  
roe, in his letter to Mr. Canning of the 29th July  
last, had stated with respect to other subjects of  
remonstrance, that it was improper to mingle them  
with the present more serious cause of compiaint ;  
an opinion to which Mr. Canning declared his per-  
fect assent, in his letter to that minister of the 2d  
of the subsequent month ; so that this act was: left  
as single and distinct, to be singly and distinctly con-  
sidered. His majesty’s government therefore could  
not consistently with any view of the’subject then  
before it, or indeed with the just object of my mis-  
sion, direct or empower me toenter upon matters not  
connected with that of the Chesapeake ; and they  
could with the less propriety do it, as in order ta  
render the adjustment of differences of such a nature  
the more easy and the more conspicuous, the minis-  
ter charged especially with such offices, have been,  
with few exceptions, restricted to the precise affair  
to be negociated. With respect therefore to those  
other causes of complaint, upon which you inform  
me that the president’s proclamation rests, I cannot  
be furnished with documents enabling me either ta  
admit or to controvert those statements of grievance  
foreign to the attack upon that ship, contained in  
your letter; or authorised to discuss the matters  
themselves. I shall therefore not allow myself to  
  
some of those transactions suggest to me, although  
their tendency would materially affect both the  
marked manner in which those transactions are  
pourtrayed, and the disadvantageo&quot;&#x27;s light in which  
his majesty’s government is represented te have  
acted respecting them.  
  
I am moreover led to the persuasion that my go«  
vernment will be the more easily able to rescue it-  
self from inculpation by the inference arising from  
passages in Mr. Munroe’s letters to Mr. Secretary  
Canning of the 29th of September last, that the  
differences unhappily existing between the two  
nations were in a train of adjustment.  
  
If his majesty has not permitted me to enter into.  
the discussion ef the search of neutral merchant  
ships for British seamen, together with the adiust-  
ment of the amount of reparation for the aitack up-  
on the Chesapeake, it was no wise with a view of  
precluding the further agitation of that question at  
a suitable time; but it was that the negociation  
might be relieved from the embsrrassment arising  
from the connection of the present matter with the  
one so foreign to it, and as it was but too well  
known, so difficult to be adjusted, of a right dis-  
tinctly disclaimed, with oae which Great-Britain  
has at all times asserted, of enforcing her cla‘m to  
the services of her natural born subjécts, when  
found on boyrd merchant vesseis of other mations ;  
a claim which she founds in that principle of uni-  
versal law, which gives to the state the right of  
requiring the aid and assistance of her native citi-  
zens. ‘The recurvence, therefore, to that cause of  
jnegociation, which had been originally scttled be-  
tween Mr. Secretary Cannmg, and Mr. Munroe,  
and which had heen alone broken in‘upon by the  
orders subsequently received by that minister, carn*  
  
}only be considered as a resumption of that couse  
  
of things which Great Ro-&#x27;ain strenuonvstycentend:  
ed there was no ground to depart from.—I may

fected without the intervention of a special mi-  
nister.  
  
It will be in your recollection, sir, that in our  
fiist interview, I stated the condition, which makes  
the subject of the present letter, before I was in-  
formed by you that the president of the United  
States would consent to the separation of the two  
subjects.  
  
1 had trusted that the exposition, which I added  
in my letter of the 26th of January, to the verbal  
explanation I had betore offered, of the grounds of  
his majesty’s demand, was. both in its purport, and  
jn the terms in which it was couched, such as to  
prevent « suspicion that they were in their intention  
derogatory to the honor, or calculated to wound |  
the just sensibility of the nation. I may add _ that  
such a supposition could not be reconciled with the  
various ostensible and unequivocal demonstrations  
of his majesty’s good faith and anxiety, that this  
transaction should be brought to an amicable ter-  
mination, which were exhibited even prior to any  
remonstrances on the part, or by the order of&#x27; this  
government. The other topics which I felt myself  
authorised to advance in that letter, in illustration  
of that amicable disposition on the part of the king,  
were brought forward from the conviction I enter-  
tained that they must be of a nature to be satisfac-  
tory to this government, and therefore such as it  
was particularly my duty to enforce, but not with  
a v.ew to rest upon them the right to advance the  
claim which I have stated.  
  
I may here remark, it is obvious that far from  
requiring that the first step towards an arrange-  
ment of reparation should be taken by the United  
States, Great Britain has already made “them openly  
and distinctly: they are indubitable testimonies to  
the respect borne and decidedly marked by Great  
Britain to the ties of amity subsisting between the  
two nations—and of her cordial desire to maintain  
them unimpaired; and as such alone they were  
airged.  
  
As his majesty would have derived sincere satis-  
faction from the evidenee of corresponding feelings  
on the part of the United States; so it would be  
the more painful to me to dvell upon a series of  
jasults and menaces, which without any provoca-  
tion or warlike preparations on the part of Great  
Britain, have been for months accumulated upon  
her through the United States, and but too fre-  
quently from quarters whose authority necessarily  
and powerfully commanded attention.  
  
I ought perhaps to apologise for adverting to ¢  
incidental expression in your letter, if 1 did el  
Uunk it mght to remove any ambiguity respecting  
the nature of the claim which Great Britain main-  
tained to her seamen, native c itizens of the realm,  
who have deserted from her service to that cf other  
powers: it is, that on demand they shall be dis-  
charged forthwith, and consequently they shall in-  
stantly be freed from their newly contracted obli-  
gations.  
  
Before I close this letter, allow me to state to, you,  
sir, that I have felt it my duty to transmit to his  
majesty’s government, the exposition contained in  
your letter of the 5th instant of the various de-  
mands on the honor and good faith of Great Britain,  
  
on which the complaint is made, that satisfaction  
has not been afforded to the United States, and on  
which conjointly with the affair of the Chesapeake,  
Youinform methat the proclamation of the pre-  
stent of the United States of the 2d July, 1807, is  
founde.J. It will be for his majesty’s government  
to deterayine on the part of Great Britain, whether  
  
any.and whit obligations remain to be fulfiBed by  
  
  
  
her—whether any denial or such protraction of rc-  
dress have occurred on her part, as to render it nes  
cessary or justifiable, the perseverance in an edict,  
which when not necessary or justifiable, assumes  
a character of aggression ; and whether, on the re-  
sult of these considerations, the present negocia-  
tion can be resumed on the part of his majesty,  
with a due regard for his own honor, or with a  
prospect of a more suecessful termination.  
I have the honor to be, with the highest conside-  
ration, sir, your most obedient, and most humble  
servant. (Signed) G. H. ROSE.
