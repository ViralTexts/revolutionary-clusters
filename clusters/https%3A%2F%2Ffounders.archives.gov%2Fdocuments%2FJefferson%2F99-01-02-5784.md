away as soon as possible. how far his testimony will be important as to the prisoner I know not, but I  
am desirous that those meetings of Yrujo with Burr &amp; his principal accomplices should come fully out &amp; judicially, as  
they will establish the just complaints we have against his nation.  
I did not see till last night the opinion of the judge on the spa duces tecum against the President.  
considering the question there as coram non judice, I did not read his argument with much attention. yet I saw readily  
enough that, as is usual where an opinion is to be supported, right or wrong, he dwells much on smaller objections, &amp;  
passes over those which are solid. laying down the position generally that all persons owe obedience to a spa, he  
admits no exception unless it can be produced in his lawbooks. but if the constitution enjoins on a particular officer to  
be always engaged in a particular set of duties imposed on him, does not this supercede the general law subjecting him to  
minor duties inconsistent with these? the constitution enjoins his constant agency in the concerns of 6. millions of  
people. is the law paramount to this which calls on him on behalf of a single one? let us apply the judges own doctrine to  
the case of himself &amp; his brethren. the sheriff of Henrico summons him from the bench to quell a riot somewhere in his  
county. the federal judge is, by the general law, a parte of the posse of the state sheriff. would the judge abandon major  
duties to perform lesser ones? again. the court of Orleans or Maine commands by spas the attendance of all the judges  
of the supreme court. would they abandon their posts as judges &amp; the interests of millions committed to them, to save  
the purposes of a single individual? the leading principle of our constitution is the independance of the Legislative,  
Executive &amp; Judiciary of each other, &amp; none are more jealous of this than the Judiciary. but would the Executive be  
independant of the Judiciary if he were subject to the commands of the latter &amp; to imprisonment for disobedience; if the  
several courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him constantly trudging from North to South &amp; East to West, and  
withdraw him entirely from his constitutional duties? the intention of the constitution that each branch should be  
independant of the others is further manifested by the means it has furnished to each to protect itself from enterprises  
of force attempted on them by the others, and to none has it given more effectual or diversified means than to the  
Executive. again, because ministers can go into a court in London as witnesses without interruption to their executive  
duties, it is inferred that they would go to a court 1000. or 1500. miles off, and that ours are to be dragged from Maine  
to Orleans by every criminal who will swear that their testimony ‘may be of use to him.’ the judge

In a letter to the district attorney he

to compel his personal attendance, -and  
Intimated that if necessary he would use  
force to prevent execution of the pro­  
cess. &quot;The intention of the Constitu­

government should be Independent of

have been right in his position that the  
President ought not to be compelled to  
leave his post of duty to attend as a  
witness in court, although this being a
