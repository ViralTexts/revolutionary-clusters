⟨Sir⟩  
Cincinnati 21st. December 1802  
Your Letter of the 22 November, notifying to me that the President had determined that, upon the receipt of that Letter, my Commission of Governor of the north western Territory should cease, was delivered to me by Mr. Secretary Byrd, on the fourteenth day of this Month. I request of you, Sir, to present my humble thanks to the President for that favour, as he has thereby discharged me from an Office I was heartily tired of, about six Weeks ⟨sooner t⟩han I had determined to rid myself of it, as he may hav⟨e observed from an ad⟩dress, not to the Convention, but to the Peopl⟨e on the 8th instant.⟩ I cannot, however agree with the Presid⟨ent, that in my address to⟩ the Convention, which is assigned as ⟨the reason of my being di⟩smissed, there was either an ⟨“intemperance or indecoru⟩m of language towards the Legi⟨slature of the United Stat⟩es, or a disorganizing Spirit of evil ⟨tendency and example,” unless an h⟩onest and true representation of fac⟨ts deserve those epi⟩thets; or that the “rules of conduct enjoin⟨ed by my pu⟩blic Station” were, in any way violated, unless it is understood that the rule of conduct for men in Office is an implicit blind obedience. As the Convention, Sir, was to meet in pursuance of an Act of Congress, whereby the Election of the Members was directed to be made according to a Law of the Territory that had existed, but had been long before repealed, a sense of public duty led me to cause the Elections to be made conformably to the Spirit of the Act and the ⟨existing laws of the Territory⟩ and the Laws in being, as they could not be made conformably to the words of ⟨it, and w⟩hen the Convention was met, I had done with ⟨it in my public cap⟩acity. Every Citizen had a right to address ⟨that body, either openly⟩ or in writing, and that right was ⟨common to me with the res⟩t; and I believe, Sir, it is a paramount duty, which every man owes to the ⟨community of which he⟩ is a member, to give warning, either to ⟨the representatives⟩ or to the Body, when he sees the rights of that Community invaded, from whatever quarter the invasion may come, and to direct them to the means of warding it off, or of repelling it; and I scruple not to say that the violent hasty and unprecedented intrusion of the Legislature of the united States into the internal Concerns of the north western Territory was at least indecorous, and inconsistent with its public duty; and I might add, that the transferring above five thousand people, with⟨out⟩ thei⟨r know⟩ledge or consent, from a Country whe⟨re they were in⟩ possession of self Government to a⟨nother where they will be,⟩ at least for some time with⟨out that privilege, and⟩ subjected to many other inco⟨nveniences was something⟩ more than indecorous, an⟨d that, had it happened in Germany,⟩ where such things have hap⟨pened, no man in America would⟩ have hesitated to use a harshe⟨r term. Degraded as⟩ our Country is, and abject as too ma⟨ny of her sons have⟩ become, there are still a vast proporti⟨on of them who⟩ will be at no loss for the proper term. Be pleased, Sir, to accept my thanks, also, for the peculiar delicacy you observed in committing the delivery of your Letter, and in furnishing him with a copy of it, to Mr. Byrd, against whom there were in your hands, to be laid before the president, Complaints of something more than mere indecorum, and of a total neglect of, and refusal to perform his official duties. It is, Sir, such strokes as this that serve, like the relief in painting, ⟨to⟩ develop Character—⟨and to bring out the figure distinctly in its proper place. It⟩ produced, however, no other emotion ⟨in me but that⟩ kind of sub risus which, ⟨physiognomists tell us⟩ is the involuntary expression, on the Countenance ⟨of a certain mental sensati⟩on which I do not chuse to name, and never ⟨fails to produce it. With⟩ due regard, I Am Sir, Your obedient Servant  
Ar: St. Clair

CinAtnnatt, %ut Dec. 1802.  
  
Sir,  
  
Your letter of the zzd November,  
notifying. to me that the prefident had  
determined that upon the receipt of that  
letter, my commiliion of governor of the  
North-weltern territory ihould ceafe,  
was delivered to me by Mr. Secretary  
By id, on the 14th day of this month. I  
recjueft of you, fir, to prefent my humble  
thanks to the prefident for that favour,  
as he has thereby difcharged me from an  
office I was heartily tired oil&quot;, about fix  
weeks foonev than I had determined to  
rid rayfelf 1 of it ; as he may have obferv-  
ed from an addrefs, not to the convention,  
bat to the people, on the 8th inftant. I  
cannot, however, agree with the prefi  
dent, that in my addrefs to the conventi-  
on, which is alligned as the reafon of my  
beingdifmiiTed, that there was either an  
intemperance, or indecorum of language  
towards the legiflature of the United  
States, or a diforganizing fpirit of* evil  
udency and example ; onlefs an honeft

duet enjoined by my public ftation&quot; were  
in any way violated, unlefs it be under-  
ftood, that the rule of conduct for men in  
office is an implicit and blind dbeditnee.  
As tlie convention, fir, was to meet in  
purfuanc* of an act of cougrefs, whereby  
the election of the members was directed  
to be made according to a law cf tlie ter-  
ritory that hadexifted, but had been long  
repealed. A fenfe of public duty led me  
to caufe the elections to be made conform-  
ably to the fpirit of the act, and ,the ex-  
iting election laws, as they could not be  
made conformably to the words ofihe art,  
and when the convention was met, I had  
done within my public capacity. Every  
citizen had a right to addrefs that body,  
either opculy or in writing, and that right  
was common to me with the reft ; and I  
  
believe, fir, it as a paramount duty whicii  
[ &#x27; vt O perfoH owes to the community 0!  
which he is a member to give warning,  
fcHer to the reprefenrtitives or to the  
body, when he fees that the rights of that  
COtnmuftity are invaded, from whale-. er  
quarter the invalion may come, and to  
direct them, if he can, 10 the means- of  
#faKrig it off, or of repelling it ■ and I  
fcruple not to fay, that the violent, ha-  
fiy and unprecedented ifftruffon of the  
legillature of the United States, into the  
internal concerns of the N.01 th-we(tem  
territory, was at ltalt indecorous and in-  
ponfiftent with its public duty, and 1  
might add,that the transferring, above five  
thoufand people, without their knowledge  
or content, from a country where they  
were in pofiefhon of felf government, to  
another where they will be, at leaft for a  
time deprived of that privilege, was fome  
thing more than indecorous, and that had  
it happened in Germany, where fuch  
things have happened, no man in Ameri-  
ca, would have hefitated to call it by a

&quot;had done within my puhiic capacity.—  
Every citizen had at right to address that

right was common to me with the rest;  
and I believe, sir, it as si. oprernount duty

lature at the United States into the in. 7  
  
ternal concerns of the north well-ern ter­

ritory that had existed, but had been long  
repealed—a sense of public duty led me  
to cause the election* to be *nMde confor­  
mably to the spirit of die act, and the ex­  
isting election laws, as they could not be  
made conformably to die words of the  
act, add when lhrxonventk&gt;» was met,  
1 had done within ray pnblic capacity—  
Evety citizen had a right ter address that  
body, either openly or in writing, and  
•that right was common to the widi die  
rest, and I believe, sir, it is a paramount  
duty which eveiy person owes to the  
community of which he is a member Co  
give warning, either to the representa­  
tives pr to the body, when he see} that  
the rights of that community are inVadcd  
from whatever quarter the invasion may  
come, and to direct them, if he can, to  
the means of warding it oft, or of repel­  
ling ft—-and I scruple not to say that the  
the violent, hasty and unprecedented in- i  
trusion of the leoislaittre of the United I  
  
States into the internal concerns of the  
north western territory, was at least in­  
decorous and inconsistent with its public  
duty, and I might add, that the trans­  
ferring above five thousand people, with­  
out their knowledge or consent, from a  
country where they .were in possession&#x27; of  
self government, to another where they  
will be at least for a time be deprived of  
that privilege^ was something more than  
indecorous, and that had it happened in  
Germany, wheg$ such things have hap­  
pened, no man in America, would have  
hesitated to call it by a harsher term.  
Degraded as our country is, and abject  
as too many ofher sons are become, there  
are still a vast proportion of them who  
Will be at ho loss for the proper term.  
Be pleased also sir, to accept ray thanks  
for the peculiar delicacy you observed,  
in communicating the delivery of your  
letter, and in furnishing him with a copy  
of it, to Mr. Byrd, against whom there  
were in yernr hands to be laid before the  
president, complaints of something more  
tfhn mere indecorum, and of a total ne­  
glect of and refusal to perform his offici­  
al dories. It is sir, such strokes as this  
which serve to derelope character, and,  
like the relief in painting, bring out the  
figure, distinctly, in its ptbper shape—it  
produced however no other equations but  
that kind of mibrisus which Physiogno­  
mists tell us is the expression onthe coun­  
tenance of a certain mental sensation,  
which I do not choose to&#x27; name,and never  
lads of producing that effect.  
* Wujb due respect, I am, sir,.  
Tori obedient smant .  
A. St. CLAIR
