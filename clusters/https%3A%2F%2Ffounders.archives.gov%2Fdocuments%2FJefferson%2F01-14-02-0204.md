 the consent of the parliament. Should his personal dispositions therefore, and that of a new ministry be the same which the king had of co-operating with Prussia, yet the latter cannot count on their effect. Probably the parliament will not consent to war, so that I think we may consider the two great powers of France and England as absolutely at rest for some time. As the character of the Prince of Wales is becoming interesting, I have endeavoured to learn what it truly is. This is less difficult in his case than in that of other persons of his rank, because he has taken no pains to hide himself from the world. The information I most rely on is from a person here with whom I am intimate, who divides his time between Paris and London, an Englishman by birth, of truth, sagacity, and science. He is of a circle, when in London, which has had good opportunities of knowing the Prince; but he has also, himself, had special  occasions of verifying their information by his own personal observation. He happened, when last in London, to be invited to a dinner of three persons. The prince came by chance and made the fourth. He eat half a leg of mutton, did not taste of small dishes, because small, drank Champagne and Burgundy as small beer during dinner, and Bordeaux after dinner as the rest of the company. Upon the whole, he eat as much as the other three, and drank about two bottles of wine without seeming to feel it. My informant sat next him, and being till then unknown to the prince personally (tho’ not by character) and lately from France, the prince confined his conversation almost entirely to him. Observing to the Prince that he spoke French without the least foreign accent, the Prince told him that, when very young, his father had put only French servants about him, and that it was to that circumstance he owed his pronunciation. He led him from this to give an account of his education, the total of which was the learning a little Latin. He has not a single element of Mathematics, of natural or moral philosophy, or of any other science on earth; nor has the society he has kept been such as to supply the void of education. It has been that of the lowest, the most illiterate and profligate persons of the kingdom, without choice of rank or merit, and with whom the subjects of conversation are only horses, drinking-matches, bawdy houses, and in terms the most vulgar. The young nobility who begin by associating with him, soon leave him, disgusted with the insupportable profligacy of his society, and Mr. Fox who has been supposed his favourite, and not over-nice in the choice of company, would never keep his company habitually. In fact he never associated with a man of sense. He has not a single idea of justice, morality, religion, or of the rights of men, nor any anxiety for the opinion of the world. He carries that indifference for fame so far, that he would probably not be hurt were he to lose his throne, provided he could be assured of having always meat, drink, horses and women. In the article of women nevertheless, he is become more correct since his connection with Mrs. Fitzherbert who is an honest and worthy woman: he is even less crapulous than he was. He had a fine person, but it is becoming coarse. He possesses good native common sense, is affable, polite and very good humored. Saying to my informant on another occasion, ‘your friend, such a one, dined with me yesterday, and I made him damned drunk’: he replied ‘I am sorry for it; I had heard that your royal highness had left off drinking;’ the Prince laughed, tapped him on the shoulder very good-naturedly, without saying a word, or ever after shewing  any displeasure.The Duke of York, who was for some time cried up as the prodigy of the family, is as profligate, and of less understanding. To these particular traits from a man of sense and truth, it would be superfluous to add the general terms of praise or blame, in which he is spoken of by other persons in whose impartiality and penetration I have less confidence. A sample is better than a description. For the peace of Europe it is best that the king should give such gleamings of recovery, as would prevent the regent or his ministry from thinking themselves firm, and yet that he should not recover.

Character of George the Fourth when Prince Regent.—As  
the character of the Prince of Wales is becoming interesting, I have  
endeavoured to learn what it truly is. This is less difficult in his case  
than in that of any other persons of his rank, because he has taken no  
pains to hide himself from the world. The information I most rely on  
IS from a person here * with whom I am intimate, who divides his time  
between Paris and l.a&gt;ndun, an Englishman by birth, of truth, sagacity,  
and science. He is of a circle vtoen in Loudon, which has had goud  
opportunities of knowing the Prince ; but he has also, himself, had spe-  
  
01 inree persons, me mnce came ny cnance, ana maae the tourth.  
He ate as much as the other three, and drank about two bottles of wine,  
without seeming to feel it. My informant sat next him, and being till  
then unknown to the Prince personally (though not by character), and  
lately from France, the I*rince coutined his conversation almost entirely  
to him. Observing to the Prince, that he spoke the French without the  
least forei^ accent, the Prince told him, that when very young, his  
father hau put only French servants about him, and that it was to that  
circumstance he owed his pronunciation. He led him from this to give  
an account of his education, the total of which was the learning a little  
Latin. Ho has not a single element of mathematics, of natural or moral  
philosophy, or of any other science on earth, nor has the society he has  
kept been such as to supply the want of education. He carries his in¬  
difference for fame so far, that ho would probably not be hurt were he to  
low his throne, provided he could be assured of having always meat,  
drink, horses, and woinen. In the article of women, nevertheless, he has  
become more earnest since his connexion with Mrs. Fitzherbert, who is  
an honest and worthy woman. He had a fine person, but i|[ becomuig  
coarse. He possesses goo&lt;l native common sense ; is affable^ polite, and  
  
very good-humoured. Haying to my informant, on another occasion_

replied, ** 1 am sorry for it, 1 had heard that your Royal Highness had  
left off drinking the Prince laughcil, tapjK*d him on the shoulder very  
good-naturedly, without saying a word, or ever after showing any dis¬  
pleasure. The Duke of York, who was for some time cried up as the  
prodigy of the family, is as profligate, and of leas uuderstanjiug. To

them*are 90 incredible that they are almost ig­  
nored. There is a curious and*interesting letter  
from Mr. Jefferson, when minister abroad  
(1789), to the American Secretary of State in  
which he alludes to the character of the then  
Prince of Wales in a manner so poiuted and  
upon information so evidently reliable that it is  
reproduced here. It will make it pretty clear  
that all the vices of public characters do not be­  
long to a republic, whatever the newspapers may  
say when a presidential campaign is marching  
over the country like a cloud of smut.  
“As the character of the Prince of Wales is  
becoming interesting, I have endeavored to learn  
what it truly is. This is less difficult in his case  
thati it is in other persons of his rank, because  
he has taken no pains to hide himself from the  
world. The information I most rely on is from  
a person hero, with whom I am intimate, who  
divides his time between Paris and London—an  
Englishman by birth, of truth, sagacity and  
science. He is of a circle, when in London,  
which has had good opportunities of knowing  
the Prince; but he has also himself had special  
occasions of verifying their information by his  
own personal observations. He happened, when  
last in London, to be invited to a dinner of three  
persons. The Prince came by chance, and made  
the fourth. lie ate half a leg of mutton; did  
not taste of small dishes, because small; drank  
champaign and Burgundy as small beer during  
dinner and Bordeaux after dinner, as the rest of  
the company. Upon the whole, he ate as much  
as the other three, and drank about two bottles  
of wine without seeming to feel it.  
“My informant sat next him. and being until  
then unknown to the Prince personally (though  
not by character), and lately from France, the  
Prince confined his conversation to him almost  
entirely. Observing to the Prince that he spoke  
French without the slightest foreign accent, the  
Prince told him that, when very young, his  
father had pm only French servants about him,  
and it was to that circumstance he owed his  
pronunciation. He led him from this to give an  
account of his education, the total of which was  
the learning of a little Latin. He has not a single  
element of mathematics, of natural or moral  
philosophy, or of any oilier science on earth, nor  
has the society he has kept been such as to sup­  
ply the void of education. It has been  
that of the* lowest, the most illiterate  
and profligate persons of the king­  
dom, without choice of rank or mind,  
and with whom the subjects of conversation are  
only horses, drinking matches, bawdy houses  
and in terms the most vulgar. The young no­  
bility who begin by associating with him soon  
leave him disgusted by the insupportable prof­  
ligacy of his society: arid Mr. Fox. who has been  
supposed his favorite, and not over nice in the  
choice of company, would never keep his com­  
pany habitually. In fact, he never associated  
with a man of sense. He has not a single idea  
of justice, morality, religion or of the rights of  
men, or any anxiety for the opinion of the  
world. He carries that indifference for fame so  
far that he probably would not be Hurt if he  
were to lose his throne, provided he could be as­  
sured of having always meat, horses and  
women. In the article of women, nevertheless,  
he lias become more correct since his connection  
with Mrs. Fitzherbert. who is an honest and  
worthy woman; lie is even less crapulous than  
he was.”
