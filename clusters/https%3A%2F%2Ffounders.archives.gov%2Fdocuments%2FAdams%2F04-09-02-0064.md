My Dear Sister—  
Haverhill September 28th. 1790  
I know your tender sympathetick Heart will join with me, &amp; drop a Tear over a lovely Child—the once beautiful John Adams Thaxter—sick—faded—withered—dead— Just as his dawning reason made us wish his stay— Just as his beauteous smile &amp; sparkling Eye promised future Joy—  
  
“Tis God that lifts our Comforts high,  
Or sinks them in the Grave  
He gives—(&amp; blessed be his name)  
He takes but what He gave”—  
  
It is this consideration alone that can calm the tumult of the Soul, &amp; give peace, &amp; serenity to the weepings Eyes, &amp; bleeding-hearts of the fond doating Parent
