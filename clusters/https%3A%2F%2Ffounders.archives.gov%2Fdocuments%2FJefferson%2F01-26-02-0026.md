s the honor of submitting to the secretary of state his opinion concerning the seizure of the ship Grange.  
The essential facts are,  
that the river Delaware takes its rise within the limits of the U.S:  
that in the whole of its descent to the Atlantic ocean, it is covered on each side by the territory of the U.S:  
that from tide water to the distance of about Sixty miles from the Atlantic ocean, it is called the river Delaware:  
that at this distance from the sea, it widens, and assumes the name of the bay of Delaware, which it retains to the mouth:  
that its mouth is formed by the Capes Henlopen and May; the former belonging to the state of Delaware in property and jurisdiction; the latter to the state of New Jersey:  
that the Delaware does not lead from the sea to the dominions of any foreign nati

e U.S., will perhaps, when combined with the treaty of Paris in 1783, justify us in attaching to our coasts an extent into the sea, beyond the reach of cannon-shot.  
In like manner is excluded every consideration, how far the spot of seizure was capable of being defended by the U.S. For, altho’ it will not be conceded, that this could not be done; yet will it rather appear, that the mutual rights of the states of New Jersey and Delaware up to the middle of the river supersede the necessity of such an investigation.
