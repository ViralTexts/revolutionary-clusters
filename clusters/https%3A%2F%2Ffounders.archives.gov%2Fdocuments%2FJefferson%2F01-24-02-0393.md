erence, and he wished he could be the Mediator to put an end to it. That he thought it important to preserve the check of my opinions in the administration in order to keep things in their proper channel and prevent them from going too far. That as to the idea  of transforming this government into a monarchy he did not believe there were ten men in the U.S. whose opinions were worth attention who entertained such a thought. I told him there were many more than he imagined. I recalled to his memory a dispute at his own table a little before we left Philada., between Genl. Schuyler on one side and Pinkney and myself on the other, wherein the former maintained the position that hereditary descent was as likely to produce good magistrates as election. I told him that tho’ the people were sound, there was a numerous sect who had monarchy in contemplation. That the Secy. of the Treasury was one of these. That I had heard him say that this constitution was a shilly shally thing of mere milk and water, which could not last, and was only good as a step to something better. That when we reflected that he had endeavored in the Convention to make an English constitution of it, and when failing in that we saw all his measures tending to bring it to the same thing it was natural for us to be jealous: and particular when we saw that these measures had established corruption in the legislature, where there was a squadron devoted to the nod of the treasury, doing whatever he had directed and ready to do what he should direct. That if the equilibrium of the three great bodies Legislative, Executive and Judiciary could be preserved, if the Legislature could be kept independant, I should never fear the result of such a government but that I could not but be uneasy when I saw that the Executive had swallowed up the legislative branch. He said that as to that interested spirit in the legislature, it was what could not be avoided in any government, unless we were to exclude particular descriptions of men, such as the holders of the funds from
