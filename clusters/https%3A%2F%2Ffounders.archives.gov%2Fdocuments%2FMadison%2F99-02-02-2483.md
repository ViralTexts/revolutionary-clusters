I cannot see the advantage of this perseverance of South Carolina in claiming the authority of the Virginia  
proceedings in. 98-99, as asserting a right in a single State to nullify an Act of the United States. Where indeed is the fairness of  
attempting to palm on Virginia an intention which is contradicted by such a variety of cotemporary proofs; which has at no

. To view the doctrine in its true character, it must be recollected that it asserts a  
right in a single State, to stop the execution of a Federal law, altho’ in effect stopping the law every where, until a  
Convention of the States could be brought about by a process requiring an uncertain time; and finally in the Convention  
when formed a vote of seven States, if in favor of the veto, to give it a prevalence over the vast majority of seventeen  
States. For this preposterous and anarchical pretension there is not a shadow of countenance in the Constitution; and well  
that there is not; for it is certain that with such a deadly poison in it, no Constitution could be sure of lasting a  
year, there having scarcely been a year, since ours was formed,

t in some one or other of the States  
which might have availed itself of the nullifying prerogative. Yet this has boldly sought a sanction under the name of Mr.  
Jefferson, because in his letter to Major Cartwright he held out a Convention of the States, as, with us, a peaceable  
remedy in cases to be decided in Europe by intestine war. Who can believe that Mr. Jefferson referred to a Convention  
summoned at the pleasure of a single State, with an interregnum during its deliberations; and above all with a rule of  
decision subjecting nearly three fourths to one fourth. No man’s creed was more opposed to such an inversion of the  
republican order of things.

Of the passages quoted, it may be remarked that they do not warrant the inference drawn from them. They import &quot;that I was  
disposed to give Congress a power to repeal State laws&quot;, and &quot;that the States ought to be placed  
under the controul of the General Government, at least as much as they were formerly when under the British King
