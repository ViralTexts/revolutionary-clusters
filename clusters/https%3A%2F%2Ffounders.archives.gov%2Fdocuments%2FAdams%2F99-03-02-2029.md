Letter 2.  
N. 5.  
St: Petersburg 15. September 1811.  
  
The first point of view, in which I have invited you to consider the Bible, is in the light of a Divine Revelation. And what are we to understand by these terms?—I intend as much as possible to avoid the field of controversy, with which I am not well acquainted, and for which I have little respect, and still less inclination—My idea of the Bible as a Divine Revelation, is founded upon its practical use to mankind, and not upon metaphysical subtleties.  
There are three points of doctrine, the belief of which forms the foundations of all human morality—The first is the existence of God—the second, is the immortality of the human Soul, and the third is a future state of rewards and punishments—Suppose it possible for a man to disbelieve either of these three Articles of faith, and that man will have no Conscience—He will have no other Law than that of the Tyger and the Shark—The laws of man, may bind him in chains or may put him to death, but they never can make him wise, virtuous or happy—It is possible to believe them all without believing that the Bible is a divine Revelation—It is so obvious to every reasonable being that he did not make himself, and that the world which he sees could as little make itself, that the moment we begin to exercise the power of reflection, it seems impossible to escape the conviction that there is a Creator—It is equally evident that this Creator must be a spiritual and not a material being—There is also a consciousness, that the thinking part of our Nature is not material but spiritual—that it is not subject to the laws of matter and therefore not perishable with it—Hence arises the belief that we possess an immortal Soul—Pursuing the train of thought, which the visible Creation and observation upon ourselves suggests, we must soon discover that the Creator must also be the Governor, of the Universe; that his power, his wisdom and his goodness must be without bounds—that he is a righteous God, and loves righteousness; that mankind are bound by his laws of righteousness, and accountable to him for their obedience to them; and that as he does not always reward or punish them in this life according to their good or Evil deeds, the completion of divine Justice must be reserved for another lifeThe Existence of a Creator—the immortality of the human Soul, and the future state of retribution, are therefore so perfectly congenial to natural reason when once discovered, or rather it is so impossible for natural reason to disbelieve them, that it would seem the light of natural reason would alone suffice for their discovery—But this conclusion would not be exact.—Human reason may be sufficient to get an obscure glimpse at these sacred and important truths, but it cannot discover them in all their clearness.—For example—In all the numberless false Religions which have swayed the minds of men in different regions and ages of the world, the idea of a God has always been included  
Father of all—in every age  
In every clime ador’d—  
By Saint, by Savage and by Sage—  
Jehovah—Jove—or Lord.  
So says Pope’s Universal prayer—But it is the God of the Hebrews alone, it is the God revealed to us in the Bible alone, who is announced as the Creator of the World—The ideas of God entertained by all the most illustrious, and most ingenious Nations of Antiquity, were weak and absurd—The Persians worshipped the Sun—the Egyptians believed in an innumerable multitude of Gods, and worshiped not only oxen, crocodiles, dogs and cats, but even garlicks and Onions—The Greeks invented a poetical religion and adored men and women, virtues and vices, Air, Water Fire, and every thing that a vivid imagination could personify—Almost all the Greek Philosophers reasoned and meditated upon the Nature of the Gods; but scarcely any of them ever reflected enough even to imagine that there was but one God—and not one of them ever conceived of him as the Creator of the World—Cicero has collected together all their opinions upon the nature of the Gods, and pronounces that they are more like the dreams of madmen, than the sober judgments of wise men—  
In the first book of Ovid’s metamorphoses there is the an Account of the change of Chaos into the World—Before the Sea, and the Earth and the sky that surrounds all things, (says Ovid) there was a thing called Chaos—and some one of the Gods, he does not know which, separated from one another, the elements of this Chaos, and turned them into a World—Thus far and no farther could human reason extend—But the first words of the Bible are “In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth.” This blessed and sublime idea of God, the creator of the Universe, this source of all human virtue and all human happiness, for which all the Sages and philosophers of Greece and Rome groped in darkness and never found, is revealed in the first verse of the book of Genesis.  
I call it the source of all human virtue and happiness, because when we have once attained the conception of a being who by the mere act of his will created the world, it would follow as an irresistible consequence even if we were not so expressly told, that the same being must also be the Governor of his own Creation—That man with all other things, was also created by him, and must hold his felicity and his virtue on the condition of obedience to His Will—In the first Chapters of the Bible, there is a short and rapid historical narrative of the manner in which the world, and man were made; of the Condition, upon which happiness and immortality were bestowed upon our first parents; of their transgression of this Condition, and of the punishment denounced upon them, and the promise of redemption from it by “the seed of  the woman.”  
There are and always have been where the holy Scriptures have been known, petty writings, and self-conceited reasoners, who cavil at some of the particular details of this narrative—Even serious enquirers after truth, have sometimes been perplexed to believe that there should have been evening and morning, before the existence of the Sun—That a man should be made of clay, and a woman from the rib of a Man—that they should be forbidden to eat an Apple, and for disobedience to that injunction be with all their posterity doomed to Death—That a serpent should speak, and beguile a woman—and that eating an apple could give the knowledge of good and evil—All this is undoubtedly marvelous, and above our comprehension—Much of it is clearly figurative and allegorical; nor is it easy to distinguish, what part of it is to be understood in a literal, and what in a symbolical sense—But that which it imports us fo to understand is plain—The great and essential principles upon which our duties and enjoyments depend, are involved in no obscurity—A God, the Creator and Governor of the Universe is revealed in all His Majesty and Power—The terms upon which he gave existence, and happiness to the common Parent of Mankind are exposed to us in the clearest light—Disobedience to the Will of God was the offence, for which he was precipitated from Paradise—Obedience to the Will of God, is the merit, by which Paradise is to be regained  
Here then is the foundation of all morality; the source of all our obligations as accountable Creatures—This idea of the transcendent power of the Supreme being is essentially connected with that by which the whole duty of Man, is summed up in Obedience to his Will—I have observed that natural reason might suffice for an obscure perception, but not for the clear discovery of these truths—Even Cicero could start to his own mind the question whether Justice could exist upon Earth unless founded upon piety but could not settle it to his own satisfaction. “Haud scio (says he) an pietata adversus deos sublata, fides etiam et societas humani generis et una excellentissima virtus, justitia tollatur.” The ray of divine light contained in the principle that Justice has no other foundation than Piety, could make its way to the Soul of the heathen, but there it was extinguished in the low, unsettled and inconsistent Notions, which were the only foundations of his piety—How could his piety by pure or sound, when he did not know whether there was one God or a thousand—whether he or they had not any concern in the formation in the world; and whether they had any regard to the affairs or the conduct of mankind?—Once assume the idea of a single God; the creator of all things, whose Will is the Law of moral obligation to man, and to whom man is accountable, and Piety becomes as rational as it is essential—It becomes the first of human duties, and not a doubt can thenceforth remain that fidelity, and the association of human kind, and that most excellent Virtue of Justice, repose upon no other foundation.  
At a later age than Cicero, Longinus, expressly quotes the third verse of the first Chapter of the Book of Genesis, as an example of the sublime—“And God said, let there be light: and there was light.”—And wherein consists its sublimity?—In the image of transcendent power presented to the mind, with the most striking simplicity of expression—yet this verse only exhibits one of the effects of that transcendant power, which the first verse discloses in announcing God as the Creator of the world—The true sublimity is in the idea given us of God—To such a God Piety, is but a reasonable service—To such a God the heart of man must yield with cheerfulness the tribute of homage, which it never could pay to the bleating Gods of Egypt, to the dissolute debauchers of the Grecian Mythology, nor even to the more elevated, but no less fantastical imaginations of the Grecian Philosophers and Sages.  
I shall resume this subject in another letter—And I reserve a small corner of my paper to tell you that your Mama, brother Charles, and Sister Louisa, who was christened last Week, and the re

## [From _New-York daily tribune._](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83030213/1848-03-10/ed-1/?sp=1)

#### 1848-03-10 &middot; [New-York [N.Y.]](http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City)

ey first point of view in which I have invited  
  
whet are we to understand by  
e terms! I intend as much as possible, to av  
sy, which I am not well ac  
sinted with, and for which I have little respect  
ee inclination. My idea of the Riblo as  
afounded upon its practical  
ankind, and not upon metaphysical sub  
There are three points of doctrine the   
hef of which forms the foundation of all morality  
t is the Existence of a God, the second is,  
the liamortality of the Human Soul, and the third is  
A Feture State of Rewards and Punishments Sug  
pose it possible for a man to disbe  
aith, and that man will have no  
conscience, he will have no other law than that of  
the tiger, or the shark the laws of man may bind  
ains, or may put him to death, but they  
never can make him wise, virtuous, or happy. It  
a possible to believe them all without believing  
ble is a Divine Revelation. It is so ob  
as to every reasonable being that he did not  
make himself, and the world which he inhabits  
as little make itself, that the moment we be  
gin to exercise the power of reflection, it seems im  
possible to escape the conviction that there is a Cre  
ator. It is equally evident that the Creator must be  
a spiritual and not a material being, there is also a  
ensciousness that the thinking part of our nature  
e not material but spiritual- that it is not subject  
to the laws of matter, nor perishable with it  
srises the belief that we hat  
and pursuing the train of thought which the  
ible creation and observation upon ourselves  
 sergests we must soon discover that the Creator  
ast also be the Governor of the Universe; that  
His wisdom, and His gooodness, must be with  
ont bounds,--that He is a righteous God and loves  
atecusness,--that mankind are bound by the  
aws of righteousness and are accountable to Him  
for their obedience to them in this life, according  
to their good or evil deeds. This completi  
vine Justice must be reserved for another life  
The existence of a Creator, the immortality of the  
human soul, and a future state of retribution, are  
therefore so perfectly congenial to natural reason  
when once discovered--or rather it is so impossible  
for natura reason to disbelieve them--that it would  
seem the light of natural reason could alone suffice  
for their discovery; but the conclusion woul  
be correct. Human reason may be sufficient t  
an obscure glimpse of these sacred and important  
truths but it cannot discover them in all their clear  
nest. For example,-in all their numberless,  
false religions, which have swayed the minds of  
men in different ages and regions of the world the  
idea of a God has always been included  
&quot;Father of all! in every age,  
in every clime adored-  
By Saint by Savage, and by Sage-  
Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.&quot;  
So says Pope&#x27;s Universal Prayer. But it is the  
God of the Hebrews alone who is announced to  
us as the Creator of the world. The ideas of God en  
tertained by all the most illustrious, and most in  
genious nations of antiquity were weak and abe  
sard. The Persians worshiped the Sun, the  
Egyptians believed in an innumerable multitude of  
gods, and worshiped not only oxen, crocodiles dogs  
and cats, but even garlics and onions. The Greeks  
favented a poetical religion, and adored men and  
women, virtues and vices, air, water and fire, an  
everything that a vividimagination could personify.  
Almost all the Greek Philosophers reasoned and  
meditated upon the nature of the gods, but scarce  
ly any of them reflected enough even to imagine  
that there was but one God, and not one of them  
ever conceived of Him as the Creator of the world.  
Cicere has collected together all their opinions  
upon the nature of the gods, and pronounced them  
more like the dreams of madmen than the sober  
jadgment of wise men. In the first book of Ovid&#x27;s  
Metamorphoses, there is an account of the change  
of Chaos in the world. Before the sea and the  
earth, and the sky that surrounds all things tsays  
Ovid) there was a thing called Chaos, and some  
of the gods the does not know which separated  
from each other the elements of this Chaos, and  
tarned them into the world, thus far and no farther  
could humas reason extend. But the first words  
of the Bible are &quot;In the beginning God created  
the heavens and the earth.&quot; The blessed and sub  
lime idea of God, as the Creator of the universe, the  
source of all human happiness for which all the  
Sages and Philosophers of Greece and Rome groped  
io darkness and never found, is recalled in the first  
verse of the book of Genesis. I call it the source  
of all human virtue and happinese, because when  
we have attained the conception of a Ber  
by the mere act of His will, created the w  
would follow as an irresistible consequence,-even  
if we were not told that the same Being must also  
be the Governor of His own creation--that man,  
with all other things, was also created by Him, and  
must hold his felicity and virtue on the condition of  
obedience to His will--In the first chapters of the  
Bible there is a short and rapid historical narrative  
of the manner in which the world and man w  
made- of the condition upon which happiness and  
immortality was bestowed upon our fist parents­  
of their tranagression of this condition- of the pun  
ishment denounced upon them,-and the promise of  
redemption from it by the &quot;Seed of the Woman.  
There are, and always have been, where the  
Holy Scriptures have been known petty witlings,  
and self concealed reasoners, who cavil at s  
the particular details of this narration. Even seri  
ous inquirers after truth have sometimes been per  
plexed to believe that there should have been  
evening and morning before the existence of the  
Sun-that man should be made of clay, and woman  
from the ribe of man- that they should have been  
forbidden to eat an apple, and for disobedience  
to that injunction, be with all their posterity  
doomed to death, and that eating an apple could  
give &quot;the knowledge of good and evil,&quot;-that  
a serpent should speak and beguile a woman.  
All this is undoubtedly marvelous, and above our  
comprehencion. Much of it is clearly figurative  
and allegorical; nor is it easy to distinguish what  
part of it is to be understood in a literal and not in  
a symbolical sense. But all that it imports us to  
know or understand is plain; the great and essen  
tial principles, upon which our duties and enjoy  
ments depend, are involved in no obscurity. AGod.  
the Creator and Governorof the Universe, is revealed  
in all His majesty and power, the terms upon which  
He gave existence and happiness to the common pae  
of mankind are exposed to us in the clearest  
  
will of od was th  
was precipitated from parad  
will of God is the me  
paradise is to be regained Here, ther  
dation of all morality,-the s  
tions, as accountable creatures. This idea of  
is es  
tally connected with that by which the whe  
f man is summed up, obedience to His  
I have observed that natural reason might a  
not for the  
se truths. Even Cicero could a  
is own mind the question; Wh  
could exist upon earth unless founded upon pie  
I not settle it to his own satisfa  
ay of Divine light contained in the principle,  
  
make its way to the soul of the heathen, but th  
a was extinguished in the low, unsettled and  
 consistent notions which were the only foundat  
piety. How could his piety be pure or s  
e did not know whether there was one   
or a thousand,-whether he, or the  
aation of the world.  
whether they had any regard to the affairs or  
conduct of mankind? Once assume the idea  
single God, the Creator of all things, whose w  
the law of moral obligation to man, a  
 man is accountable, and piety becomes as ratio  
as it is essential it becomes the first o  
ties, and not a doubt can thenceforth remain, t  
fidelity in the associations of human piety, andt  
most excellent virtue Justice, repos  
foundation. At a later age than  
pressly quotes the dverse of the lat chapter of Ge  
esis as an example of the sublime. &quot;God said  
there be light, and there was light, and wher  
consists its sublimity? In the image of the tran  
cendent power presented to the mind, with  
most striking simplicity of expression. Yet t  
verse only exhibies the effects of that trancend  
power which the first verse discloses in announcin  
a the Creator of the world. The true s  
limity is in the idea given us of God. To such  
God the heart of man must yield with cheerfulne  
the tribute of homage which it never could pay  
the numerous gods of Egypt to the dissolute  
bauchees of the Heathen Mythology, nor eventot  
more elevated, but not less fantastical imaginatic  
of the Grecian Philosophers and Sages.

should have been forbidden to eat an apple, and  
for disobedience to that injunction, be with all  
their posterity dimmed to death, and that eating  
an apple could give &quot;the knowledge ot go &gt;daml  
evil,” that a serpent should speak and beguile  
a woman. All this is undoubtedly marvellous,  
and above our comprehension. Much of it is  
clearly figurative and allegorical: not is it easy  
to distinguish what part of it is to he understood  
m a literal and what in a symbolical sense  
Hut all that it imports us to know or understand  
is plain, the great and essentia! principles, upon  
which our duties and enjoyments depend, are in­

the source of all our obligations, accountable ,

of tlie Supreme Remg is essentialh connected  
with that by which the whole duty of man i&gt;  
Mimmed up; obedience to His will. I have ob­  
served that natura&#x27; reason might suffice to* an j  
obscure perception, but not for the clear discow- |  
ry of these truths. Kven Cicero could start to |

LETTER NO. II.  
The first point of view in Avhich I have invi  
ted vou to consider the Bible is in the light of  
Divine Revelation. And wha are we to un  
defstand by these terms? I intend, as much as  
possible, to avoid the field of controversy  
which I am not well acquainted with, and for  
which I have little respect and still less incli  
nation. My idea of the Bible as a Divine liev­  
elation is founded upon its practical use to man  
kind, and not upon metaphysical subtleties  
There are three points of doctrine; the belief  
of which forms the foundation ot alt morality.  
The first is, the existence of a God; the. second  
is, the immortality of the human soul; and the  
third is, a future state of rewards and punish­  
ments. Suppose it possible for a man to dis­  
believr either of these articles of faith, and that  
man will have no conscience, he will have no  
other law than that of the tiger, or the shark,  
the laws of man may bind him in chains, or  
may put him to death, but they never can make  
him wise, virtuous, or happy. It is possible  
to believe them all without believing that the  
Bible is a divine revelation. It is to obvious  
to every reasonable being that he did not make  
himself and the world which he inhabits could  
as little make itself, that the moment we be-  
gin to exercise tha power of reflection, it sterns  
impossible to escape tne conviction tnat mere-  
r.r.;itor must he a srdritnal and not a material !  
beinii: there is also a consciousness lhat the!  
thinking part of our nature is not material but  
spiritual that it is not subject to &#x27;the laws of  
matter, nor perishable with it. lljnce arises  
the belief that we have an immortal soul, and  
on rsiim&quot; the train ot thougut wtiicn trie visi-1  
ble creation and observation upon ourselves  
suggest, we must soon discover that the Crea­  
tor must also bi the governor of the universe;  
that His wisdom, and His goodness, must  
be  
without bounds that He is a righteous trod  
and loves righteousness that mankind are  
bound by &quot; the laws of righteousness, and - are  
accountable to Him for their obedience to them  
in this Ufa, according to &quot; their good or evil  
deeds. -This completion of Divine justice  
must be reserved for another life. The exist  
ence of a Creator, the immortality of the human  
soul, and a future state of retribution,are there­  
fore so perfectly congenial to natural reason  
when once discovered or rather it i impossi­  
ble for natural reason to disbelieve them that  
it would seem tne Iignt oi natural reason  
could alone suffice for their ditcoverv: but the  
conclusion would not be correct. Human rea  
son may be&quot; sufficient to get an obscure glimpse  
of these sacred and important truths, but it  
cannot discover them in all their clearness  
For example in all their numberless, false  
religions, which have swayed the minds of  
men in different ages and regions of the  
world, the idea of a God has always, been  
included: 1 ; &#x27; 4  
, &quot;Father of alt! in every nge,  
In every clime adored &#x27;  
By saint by savage and by sage  
Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.&quot;  
So says Pope&#x27;s Universal Prayer, But it is the  
God of the Hebrews alone who is announced  
to us as the Creator of the world. The ideas  
of God entertained by all the most illustrious  
and most ingenious nations of antiquity were  
weak and absurd. .The Persians worshipped  
the sun; the Egyptians believed in an innu  
merable multitude of gods, and worshipped  
i not onlv oxen, crocodiles, dogs and cats, but  
even garlics and onions, the Greeks invented  
a poetical religion, and adored men and wom­  
en, virtues and vices; air, water and fire, and  
everything that a vivid im initiation could per  
sonify. Almost all the Greek philosophers  
reasoned and meditated upon the nature of the  
gods; but scarcely any of them reflected enough  
even to imagine there was but one God, and  
not one them evi,r conceived . of Him as . the  
Creator of the world. Cicero has collected to  
gether all their opinions upon the nature of  
the sods, and pronounced them more l;ke th  
dreaihs of madmen than the sober judgment of  
wise men. In the first book of Ovid s Meta  
morphoses, there is an account ot tne ciiange  
of chaos in the world. .Before the sea and th  
sky that surrounds all things, (says Ovid,)  
there was a thing called chaos, and some of the  
gods (he does not know which,) separated  
from each other the elemants ot this chaos  
and turned th jm into the world; thus far and  
no farther coull human reason extend. Butjthe  
first word of the Bible are: &quot;In the beginning  
God created &#x27;he heavensand the earth,&quot; The  
blessed and sublime idea of God, as the Crea  
tor of the. universe; the source of all human  
happiness, for which all the sages and philoso­  
phers of Greece and Home groped in darkness  
and never found, is recalled in the first verse  
of the book of Genesis. I call it the source of  
all human virtue and happiness, because when  
we have attained the conception of a Being.  
who, by the mere act of His will, created the  
  
world, it would follow as an irresistable conse­  
quence even if we Tvere not told - that the  
same Being must also be the Governor of his  
own creation that man, with all other things  
was also.created by him, and must hold his fe­  
licity and virtue on condition of obedience to  
His will. In the first chanters of the Bible  
  
there&#x27;is a short and rapid historical narrative of  
the manner in which the world -.and man were  
made of the condition upon which happiness  
and mortality was bestowed upon our first pa­  
rents of their transgression of this condition  
of the punishment denounced upon them  
and the promise of redemption from it by the  
&quot;seed of the woman.&quot;  
There are, and always have been, where the  
holy Scriptures have been known, petty wit­  
lings, and self conceited reasoners, w ho cavil  
at some of the particular detajls of this narra­  
tion. Even serious inquirers after truth have  
been perplexed to believe that there should  
have been evening and morning before the ex­  
istence of the sun that man should be made  
of clay, and woman from the ribs of man  
that they should have been forbidden to eat an  
apple, and for disobedience to that injunction,  
be vith all their posterity doomed to death,  
and thai eating an apple could give &quot;the  
knowledge of good and evil&quot; that a serpent  
should speak and beguile a woman. All tnis  
is undoubtedly marvellous, arid above our com­  
prehension. Much of it is clearly figurative  
and allegorical; nor is it easy, to &quot;distinguish  
what part of it is to be understood in a literal  
and not in a symbolical sense. But all &#x27;that it  
imports us to know or understand is plain;  
the great and essential principles, upon .w hich  
our duties and enjoyments depend, are involv­  
ed no obscurity. A God, the Creator and Gov­  
ernor of the Universe, is revealed in all His  
majesty and power; the terms upon which He  
gave existence and happiness Jo the common  
parent of mankind are exposed to us in the  
clearest light. Disobedience to the will of  
God. was the offence for which he was precip­  
itated from paradise; obedience to the will of  
God is the merit by which paradise is to be re­  
gained. Here, then, is the foundation of all  
morality the source of all our obligations, as  
accountable creatures. This idea of the tran­  
t.endant power of the Supreme Being is essen­  
tially connected with that by which the whole  
duty of man is summed up; obedieiice to His  
will. 1 have observed lhat natural reason  
rnigjjt suffice for an obscure perception, but not  
for the clear discovery of these truths. Even  
Cicero could start to his own mind the ques­  
tion: Whether justice could exist upon earth  
unless founded upon piety? but could not set­  
tle it to his own satisfaction. The ray of Di­  
vine light contained in the. principle that jus­  
tice has no other foundation than piety could  
make its way to the soul of he heathen, but  
there it was extinguished, in the low, unsettled,  
and inconsistent notion which were lhe only  
foundations of his piety. .How could his pie­  
ty be pure or sound, when he did know wheth­  
he or they had or had not any concern in the  
formation of the world, and whether they had  
any regard to the affairs or the conduct of man­  
kind? Once assume the idea of a single God,  
the creator of all things whose will is the law  
of moral obligation to man, and to whom man  
is accountable, and piety becomes as rational  
as it is essential, it becomes the first of human  
duties, and not a doubt can thenceforth remain,  
that fidelity in the associations of human piety  
and that most excellent virtue &quot;justice, repose  
upon no other foundation. At a later age than  
Cice.ro, Longinus expressly quotes the 3d verse  
of the 1st chapter of Genesis as an example of  
the sublime. f&#x27;God said let there be light,  
and there was light;&quot; and wherein consists its  
sublimity? In the image of the transcendent  
power presented to the mind, with the most  
striking simplicity of expression. Yet this  
verse only exhibits the effects of that transcen­  
dent power which the first verse discloses in  
announcing God as the creator of the world.  
The true sublimity is in the idea given us of  
God. To such a God the heart of man must  
yield with cheerfulness the tribute of homage  
which it never could pay to the numerousGous  
of Egypt, to the dissolute debauchees of the  
heathen mythology, nor even to the more ele­  
vated, but not less fantastical imaginatoins of  
the Greciaa philosophers and sages

111. F: -Mit *ArifTit view 111:11411T11 . I have   
inviter&#x27; you to consider the Bible, is ii, the   
light of Divine Revelation. Anti what are we   
to- understand liy these terriA? I intend,;as   
much as possible, to avoid the field el con­  
troversy, which I am not well acquainted   
with. arid for which 1 Lava linlti respect, and   
still less inclination. My idea Of the Bible   
as a Divine Revelation is founded upon its   
practierd.use to mankind, and not upon met­  
aphysical Aubtleties. There are three points   
of doctrine, the belief rif which forms the   
foundation of all morality. The first is, the   
Existence of a cod; the second-is,, the Im-  
I mortality of the Human Soul: and the third,   
is, a Future State of Rewards and Punishr.-  
mews. Suppose it possible for a man to dis­  
believe either of these articles-of htith, and   
that man will,have-no conscience.: he._will   
have no other law-than that of the tiger, or,   
the shank; the laws of man may bind him   
in chains/ ortrirty put him to:deatiybilt they   
never can malt° him wise, virtuous, or hap--   
,py. pis, poisible te-believe them all with­  
out fielieving that-the ,Bible is a Divine Rev-,   
elation. It is so obvious to every reasonable   
being that he did not make himself, and   
the world which Ito inhabits did not Make&#x27;   
itSelf, that the moment we begin&#x27; to exercise   
the-power of reflection, it seems impossible   
to escape the conviction that them is a Cre-.   
-atos.-r-,-It -is,equaily,evident--that-t he-Gt eater,   
udifsf be a spiritual, and.noi a material being:   
there is also a consciousness that the think­  
ing part of our natures &#x27;is not material, bet   
.spiritual—that it is not subject to the-laws of   
matter, nor perishable with it. I fence arises   
the belief that we have an immortal souli and   
puisning die train of thought which-the visi­  
ble creation and. ohs !rvation upon ourselves   
-suggests, we trust soon discover that the   
Creator must also be the Governor of the   
Uniierse ; that His wisdom. and klis good­  
, tress, must be without bounds.,—that lle is a   
i ighteous God and loves righteousness.—that   
mankind ate bound by the laws of righteous­  
ness and are accountable to Him in their   
obedience to Amu in this life, according to   
their good br evil deeds. This c cimpletion   
of Divine Justice must be reserved for ano­  
ther life. The eiistence of a Creatorithe   
tin tumidity of the human soul, and a future   
state of retributioh, are therefore so-perfectly   
congenial to naturalreason when once dis­  
covered—or rather it is so Impossible for   
natural reason to disbelieve them—that it   
would seem the light of natural. reason could   
alone suffice fur their discovery; but. the   
conclusion would not be correct. Human   
reason may be Sufficient to get an obscure   
al i m pse of these sacied and important truths,   
but it cannot discover them. in all their clear­  
ness. For example :—iii all the number­  
less, false religions, which have swayed the   
minds of inun io different ages and regions   
of   
the yeit   
n. the idea of a God has always

&#x27; By Saint by Savage._ and by Sage°

So says Pope&#x27;s Universal Prayer. But it is   
the God,,ef the Hebrews alone who is an­  
nounced;th fas as. the, Creator el the world.—  
The &quot;A5i0,...;0h-qoAt:entertained by all the

sians tvorshipped the Suit ; the Egyptians   
believed in WI innumerable number ot Gods   
and worshipped not only. oxen, crecodiles,   
dogs; and cats, but even gashes and onions.   
The Greekit, invented a poetical religion, and   
&#x27;adored inefNind *omen, virtues and vices;   
;air, Water ml&#x27;l.l fire, and everything that a   
vi­

might suffice for all Obscure preception, but   
not for the clear discovery of these truths.—  
Even Cicero could start fo his own mind die   
question_:—Whetherjustice_could_exist upon i.   
earth unless founded upon piety? but could% I   
not settle it to his own satisfactioir.- The ray   
• of Divine light contained itt the_prinsiple..l.   
that justice has no other foondution than pie­  
ty, could inake its Way to die soul of the hep­

Justice, repose upon noltther foundation. At   
a later age than Cicero, I..enginua expressly   
quotes the 3d verso of the Ist clrp.te? of   
Genesis as.an example of the, Sublime.—  
God said let there be light, and them was   
light ;&quot; and wherein consists its sublimity?   
In the image of the transcendent power lire.

simplicity of expression. Vet this verse on­  
ly exhibits the effects of that transcendent   
• power which the first verse I.klscloses in an­  
itouncing God lIS the Creator 01 the world.—  
The true sublimity is in the idea given us Of   
God, To such a God the heart of moan must   
yield with elieerfullness, the tribute of ho­  
mage whieli °it never could .pay to the nu­  
merous gods of Egypt, to the dissolute- de­  
bauchees of the Heathen Mythology, nor

tastical imaoinations of the Grecian Philos°.

and turned them into the world; thus tar I

LETTER. Il.  
  
The first point of view in which 1 have invi-  
ted you to consider the Bible is in the light of a  
Divine Revelation. And whatare we to under-  
stand by these terms !—I intend as much as pos-  
sible, to avoid the field of controversy, which |  
am not well acquainted with, and for which I  
have little respect, and still less inclination. My  
idea of the Bible as a Divine Revelation is found-  
ed upon its practical use to mankind, and not  
upon metaphysical subtleties. ‘There are three  
points of doctrine, the belief of which forms the  
foundation of all morality. The first is the-exis-  
ence of a God ; the second is, the immortality of  
the human soul ; and the third is, a future state  
of rewards and punishments.  
  
Suppese it possible fora man to disbelieve  
either of these articles of faith, and that man  
will have no other law than that of the tiger, or  
the shark ; the laws of man may bind him in  
chains, or may put him to death, but they can  
never make him wise, virtuous or happy. It is  
possible to believe them all, without believing  
that the Bible is a Divine revelation. It is so  
obvious to every reasonable being that he did not  
make himself, and the world which he inhabits  
could as little make itself, the moment we begin  
to exercise the power of reflection, it seems im-  
possible to escape the conviction that there*is a  
Creator. ‘  
  
It is equally evident that the Creator must be  
a spiritual, and not a material being ; there is al-  
so a consciousness that the thinking part of our  
nature is not material, buat spiritual—thai it is  
not subject to the laws of matter, nor perishable  
with itt Hence arises the belief that we have  
an immortal soul; and pursuing the train of  
thought which the visible creation and observa-  
  
  
  
tlement at Aden, near the mouth of the Red Sea.  
Having once obtained a foot-hold, they, English-  
like, began to push about them, and one of their  
first discoveries was a river where none wa

tion upon ourselves suggests, we must soon dis-  
| cover that the Creator must also be the governor  
| of the universe—that His wisdom, and His good-  
| ness, must be without bounds—that He is a  
righteous God and loves righteousness,—that  
mankind are bound by the Jaws of righteousness  
and are accountableto Him for their obedience  
| to them in this life, according to their good or  
| evil deeds.  
This completion of divine justice must be re-  
served for anuther life. ‘ihe existence of a  
| Creator, the idtmortality uf the human soul, and  
/a future state of retribution, are therefore so per-  
| fectly congenial to natural reason when once  
| discovered—or rather it is so impossible for na-  
| tural reason to disbelieve them—that it would  
| seem the light of natural reason could alone suf-  
| fice for their discovery; but the conclusion  
pet not becorrect. Human reason may be  
  
| sufficient to get an obscure glimpse of these sa-  
  
ered and important truths, but it cannot discover  
them in all their clearness. For example ;—in  
all the numberless false religions which have  
swayed the minds of men in different ages and  
regions of the world, the idea of a God has al-  
ways been included:  
  
**Father of all! in every age,  
  
In every clime adored—  
  
By saint, by savage and by sage—  
Jehovah, Jove, or Lord.  
  
So saye Pepe&#x27;s universal prayer. But it is the  
God of the Hebrews alone who is announced to  
usas the creator of the world. The idéas of  
God entertained by the most illustrious, «nd most  
ingenivvs nations of antiquity were weak and ab-

ist upon earth unless founded upon piety? but  
could 3s settle it to his ppt a The  
  
that justice has no other foundation than piety,  
could make its way to the soul of the heathen,  
but there it was extinguished in the low, un-  
settled and inconsistent notions which were the  
only foundations of his piety. How could his  
piety be pure or sound, when he did not know  
whether there was one God or @ thousand—  
whether he, or they had or had not any concern  
in the formation of the world, and whether they  
had any regard to the affairs or the conduct of  
mankind?  
  
Once assume the idea of a single God the  
creator of all things, whose will is the law of  
moral obligation to man, and to whom man ‘is  
accountable, and piety becomes as rational as it  
is essential; it becomes the first of human du-  
ties; and not a doubt can thenceforth remain,  
that fidelity m the associations of human piety  
and that most excellent virtue, repose upon no  
other foundation. Ata Jater age than Cicero,  
Longinus expressly quotes the 3d verse of the Ist  
chapter of Genesis as an example of the sublime.  
“God said Jet there be iight, and there was  
light; ” and wherein consists its sublimity* In  
the image of the transcendent power presented  
to the mind, with the most striking simplicity of  
expression. Yet this verse only exhibits the  
effects of that transcendent power which the first  
verse discloses in announcing as the Creator of  
the world. The true subject is in the idea  
given us of God. To such a God the heart of  
man must yield with cheerfulness the tribute of  
homage which it never could pay to the numer-  
ous gods of Egypt, to the dissolute debauchees  
of the heathen mythology, nor even to the more  
elevated, but notdess fantastical imaginations of  
the Grecian philosophers and sages.

imagine that there was but one God, and not one  
  
| of them ever conceived of Him as the Creator  
| of the world. Cicero has collected together all  
| their opinions upon the nature of the gods, and  
pronounced them more like the dreams of mad-  
| men than the sober judgment of wise men. In  
| the first book of Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses, there is  
| an account of the change of Chaos into the world.  
| Before the sea and the earth, and the sky that  
| surrounds all things, (says Ovid) there was a  
thing called Chaos, and some of the gods (he  
| does not know which) separated from each oth-  
| er the elements of this Chaos, and turned them  
| into the world; thus far and no farther could hu-  
| man reason extend. But the nrst words of the  
| Bible are ‘*In the beginning God created the  
heavens and the earth.”  
  
The blessed and sublime idea of God as the  
Creator of the universe, the source of al] human  
happiness for which all the sages and philoso-  
phers of Greece and Rome have groped in dark-  
ness and never found, is recalled in the first  
verse of the book of Genesis. | call it the source  
of all human virtue and happiness; because when  
we have attained the conception of a Being, who  
by the mere act of His will, created the world,  
it would follow as an irresistible consequence,—  
even if we were not told that the same being  
must also be the Governor of His own creativn  
—that man with all other things, was also crea-  
ted by Him, and must hold his felicity and vir-  
tue on the condition of obedience to His will.  
In the first chapters of the Bible there is a short  
and rapid historical varrative of the mauner in  
which the wurld and man were made—of the  
condition upon which happiness and immortality  
were bestowed upon our first parents—of their  
transgression of this condition—of the punish-  
ment denounced upon them—and the promise of  
redemption from it by the ‘‘seed of the wo-  
man,”  
  
There are and always have been, where the  
Holy Scriptures have been known, petty wit-  
lings, and self-conceited reasoners, who cavil at  
some of the particular details of the narration.  
Even serious inquirers after trath have some-  
times been perplexed to believe that there should  
have been evening and morning before the exis-  
tence of the sun—that manshould be made of  
clay, and woman from the ribs of man—that  
they should have been forbidden to eat an apple,  
and for disobedience to that injunction, be with  
all their posterity duomed to death, and that eat-  
ing un apple could give **the knowledge of good  
and evil,’’—that a serpent should speak and be-  
guile a woman. All this is undoubtedly marvel-  
lous, and above our comprehension. Mach of it  
is clearly figurative and allegorical; nor is it ea-  
sy to distinguish what part of it is to be under-  
stood in a literal and not in a symbolical sense.  
But all that it imports us to know or understand  
is plain; the great and essential principles, upon  
which our duties and enjoyments depend, are  
involved in no obscurity. A God, the Creator  
and governor of the universe, is revealed in all  
his majesty and power; the terms upon which  
he gavé existence and happiness to the common  
parents of mankind are exposed to us in the  
clearest way.  
  
Disobedience to the will of God, was the of.  
fence for which he was precipitated from para-  
dise; obedience to the will of God is the merit  
by which paradise is to be regained. Here then,  
is the foundasion of all morality,—the source of  
all our obligations, as accountable creatores.  
This idea of the transcendant power of the Su-  
preme Being is essentially connected with that  
by which the whole duty of man is summed up;  
obedience to His will. [ have observed that  
natural reason might suffice for an obscure per-  
ception, but not for the clear discovery of these  
truths. Even Cicero could start to his own  
mind the question: Whether justice could ex

So says Pope&#x27;s Universal Prayer. But  
  
it is the God of the Hebrews slone who  
is announced to us as the Creator of the  
world. The ideas of God entertained by  
all the most illustrious, and mort ingeni­  
us nations of antiquity were wesk and  
  
abrurd. The Persians worshiped the Sun;  
  
the Egypuians helieved in an innumerable  
multitude of gods, and worshiped not on  
ly oxen, crocodiles, dogs and cats, but e­  
ven garhies and onions. The Greeks in  
ented a poetical religion, and adored men  
and women, virfues and vires; sir, water  
and fire, and everything that a vivid im­  
gination could personify. Almost all the  
Greek Philosophers reasoned and medi  
tated upon the nature of the gods; but  
scarcely any of them reflected enough even  
to imagine that there was but one God,  
  
and not one of them ever conreived of  
Him as the Cresior of the world. Cice  
ro has collected together all sheir opinions  
upon the nature of the gods, and pronoun  
ced them more like the dreams of madmen.  
  
than the sober judgment of wise men. In  
  
the first book of Ovids Metamorploses.  
there is an account of the change of Cha  
  
os in the world. Before the sea and the  
earth, and the sky that surrounds all things,  
(says Ovid) there was a thing called Chae  
  
os, and some of the gods (he does not  
  
know which) separated from each other  
the elements of this Chaos, and turned  
them into the world; thus far and no far­  
ther could human reason extend. But the  
  
first words of the Bible are In the be-  
ginning God created the heavens and the  
  
earth.&quot; The blessed and the sublime  
idea of God, as the Creator of the universe,  
  
 the source of all human happiness, for  
  
which all the Sages and Philosophers of  
  
Greece and Rome groped in darkness and  
never found, is recalled in the first verse  
of the book of Genesis. I call it the source  
of all human virtue and happiness; be­  
cause when we hate altained the concep  
fa Being, who by the mere act of  
his will, created the world, it would fol­  
low as an irresistible consequence,- even  
  
if we were not told that the same Being  
must also be the Governor of His own  
  
creation--that Man, with all other things.  
was also created by Him, and must hold  
his felicity and virtue on the condition of  
  
obedience to His will. In the first chap-
