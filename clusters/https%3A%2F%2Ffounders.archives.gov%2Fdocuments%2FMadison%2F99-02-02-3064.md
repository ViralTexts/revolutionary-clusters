Being satisfied from observation and experience, as well as from medical testimony, that ardent spirit as a drink, is not  
only needless, but hurtful; and that entire disuse of it would tend to promote the health, the virtue and happiness of the  
community, we hereby express our conviction, that would the citizens of the United States, and especially the Young Men, discontinue the use of it, they would not only promote their own benefit, but the  
good of the country and the world.
