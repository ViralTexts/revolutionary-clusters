Proceeding, fellow citizens, to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred on me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large, and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations.  
On taking this station on a former occasion, I declared the principles on which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth. my conscience tells me I have, on every occasion acted up to that declaration, according to it’s obvious import, and to the understanding of every candid mind.  
In the transaction of your foreign affairs, we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations, &amp; especially of those with which we have the most important relations. we have done them justice on all occasions; favor, where favor was lawful, &amp; cherished mutual interests &amp; intercourse on fair &amp; equal terms. we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction, that with nations, as with individuals, our interests, soundly calculated, will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties. and history bears witness to the fact, that a just nation is trusted on it’s word, when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others.  
At home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether we have done well or ill. the suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments and expences, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. these covering our land with officers, &amp; opening our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation, which, once entered, is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property &amp; produce. if, among these taxes, some minor ones fell, which had not been inconvenient, it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them: and because if they had any merit, the state-authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved.  
The remaining revenue, on the consumption of foreign articles, is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts. being collected on our sea-board and frontiers only, &amp; incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and the pride of an American to ask What farmer, what mechanic, what labourer ever sees a tax-gatherer of the US.? these contributions enable us to support the current expences of the government, to fulfill contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits, to extend those limits, &amp; to apply such a surplus to our public debts, as places at a short day their final redemption. and, that redemption once effected, the revenue thereby liberated may, by a just repartition of it among the states, &amp; a corresponding amendment of the constitution, be applied, in time of peace, to rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education, &amp; other great objects within each state. in time of war, if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war, increased as the same revenue will be by increased population &amp; consumption, &amp; aided by other resources reserved for that crisis, it may meet within the year all the expences of the year, without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past. War will then be but a suspension of useful works; &amp; a return to a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement.  
I have said, fellow-citizens, that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits. but that extension may possibly pay for itself, before we are called on, &amp; in the mean time may keep down the accruing interest: in all events it will replace the advances we shall have made. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana has been disapproved by some, from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger it’s union. but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively? the larger our association, the less will it be shaken by local passions. and in any view, is it not better that the opposite bank of the Missisipi should be settled by our own brethren &amp; children than by strangers of another family? with which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse?  
In matters of Religion, I have considered that it’s free exercise is placed by the constitution independant of the powers of the general government. I have therefore undertaken, on no occasion, to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it: but have left them, as the constitution found them, under the direction &amp; discipline of the state or church authorities acknoleged by the several religious societies.  
The Aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires. endowed with the faculties &amp; the rights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independance, &amp; occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores. without power to divert, or habits to contend against it, they have been overwhelmed by the current, or driven before it. now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter-state, humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture &amp; the domestic arts; to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence, &amp; to prepare them in time for that state of society, which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind &amp; morals. we have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry &amp; houshold use; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity; and they are covered with the Aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves.  
But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow it’s dictates, &amp; change their pursuits with the change of circumstances, have powerful obstacles to encounter. they are combated by the habits of their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, &amp; the influence of interested &amp; crafty individuals among them, who feel themselves something in the present order of things, and fear to become nothing in any other. these persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance under it’s counsel in their physical, moral or political condition is perilous innovation: that their duty is to remain as their creator made them, ignorance being safety, and knolege full of danger. in short, my friends, among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry. they too have their Anti-Philosophists, who find an interest in keeping things in their present state; who dread reformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason, &amp; obeying it’s mandates.  
In giving these outlines, I do not mean, fellow citizens, to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures. that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen the public measures. it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties. it is due to the zeal &amp; wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholsome laws, the execution of which alone remains for others. and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose patriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions.  
During this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the artillery of the Press has been levelled against us, charged with whatsoever it’s licentiousness could devise or dare. these abuses of an institution, so important to freedom and science, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen it’s usefulness, and to sap it’s safety. they might perhaps have been corrected by the wholsome punishments reserved to, and provided by, the laws of the several states against falsehood &amp; defamation. but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation.  
Nor was it uninteresting to the world, that an experiment should be fairly and fully made, Whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth? Whether a government, conducting itself in the true spirit of it’s constitution with zeal and purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness, can be written down by falsehood &amp; defamation? the experiment has been tried. you have witnessed the scene. our fellow citizens looked on cool, &amp; collected. they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded. they gathered around their public functionaries. and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those who had served them, and consolatory to the friend of man, who believes that he may be trusted with the controul of his own affairs.  
No inference is here intended that the laws provided by the states against false &amp; defamatory publications, should not be enforced. he who has time renders a service to public morals, &amp; public tranquility, in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law. but the experiment is noted to prove that, since truth &amp; reason have maintained their ground against false opinions, in league with false facts, the Press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint. the public judgment will correct false reasonings &amp; opinions, on a full hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press, and it’s demoralising licentiousness. if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain, it’s Supplement must be sought in the Censorship of Public opinion.  
Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally, as auguring harmony &amp; happiness to our future course, I offer to our country sincere congratulations. with those too, not yet rallied to the same point, the disposition to do so is gaining strength. facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them: &amp; our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens, with whom they cannot yet resolve to act, as to principles &amp; measures, think as they think, &amp; desire what they desire. that our wish, as well as their’s, is, that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good: that peace be cultivated, civil &amp; religious liberty unassailed, law &amp; order preserved, equality of rights maintained, &amp; that state of property, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry, or that of his fathers. when satisfied of these views, it is not in human nature that they should not approve &amp; support them. in the mean time, let us cherish them with patient affection: let us do them justice and more than justice in all competitions of interest; &amp; we need not doubt that truth, reason, &amp; their own interests will at length prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, &amp; will compleat that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony &amp; the benefit of all it’s strength.  
I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow-citizens have again called me, &amp; shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray. I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice. but the weaknesses of human nature, &amp; the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests. I shall need therefore all the indulgence which I have heretofore experienced from my constituents. the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years. I shall need too the favour of that being in whose hands we are: who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land; and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries &amp; comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with his providence, &amp; our riper years with his wisdom &amp; power: &amp; to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me, that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, &amp; prosper their measures, that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, &amp; shall secure to you the peace, friendship, &amp; approbation of all nations.

dle others.  
At home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether we have  
  
done well or ill. The suppression of unnecessary offices,  
of useless establishments and expences, enabled us to dis-  
continue our internal taxes. These covering our land with  
officers, and opening our doors to their intrusions, had al-  
ready begun that process of domiciliary vexation, which,  
once entered, is scarcely to be restrained from reaching suc-  
cessively every article of ‘produce and of property. If,  
among these taxes, some minor ones fell, which had not been  
inconvenient, it was because their amount would not have  
paid the officers who collected them, and because, if they had  
any merit, the state authorities might adopt them instead of  
others less approved.  
  
The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign  
articles, is paid chiefly by those whocan afford to add foreign  
luxuries to domestic comfort. Being collected on our sea  
board and frontiers only, and incorporated with the transac-  
tions of our merhantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and  
the pride of an American to ask, what farmer, what mechan-  
ic, what labourer ever seesa tax-gatherer of the United  
States? These contributions enable us to support the cur-  
rent expenses of the government, to fulfil contracts with  
foreign nations, to extinguish the native right of soil with-  
in our limits, to extend those limits, and to apply such a  
surplus to our public debts, as places at a short day their  
final redemption, and that redemption once effected, the  
revenue thereby liberated, may by a just repartition among  
the states, and a corresponding amendment of the constitu-

same revenue will be by increased population and consump-  
tion, and aided by other resources, reserved for that crisis,  
it may meet within the year all the expences of the year,  
without encroaching on the rights of future generations, by  
burthening them with the debts of the past. War will then  
be but a suspension of useful works, and a return to a state  
of peace, a return to the progress of improvement.  
  
I have said, fellow-citizens, that the income reserved had  
enabled us to extend our limits; but that extension may pos-  
sibly pay for itself before we are called on, and in the mean  
timme may keep down the accruing interest. In all events  
it will replace the advances we shall have made. I know  
that the acquisition of Louisiana has been disapproved by  
some, from acandid apprehension that the enlargement of  
our territory may endanger its union. But who can limit  
the extent to which the federative principle may operate ef-  
fectively ? The larger our association, the less will it be  
shaken by local passions. And in any view, is it not better  
that the opposite bank of the Missisippi should be settled by  
our own brethren and children, than by strangers of another  
family ? With which shall we be most likely to live in har-  
mony and friendly intercourse ?  
  
In matters of religion, I have considered that its free ex-

rected itself on these shores. Without power to divert, or  
liabits to contend against it, they have been overwhelmed by  
the current, or driven before it. Now reduced within limits  
too narrow for the hunter state, humanity enjoins us to teach  
them agriculture and the domestic arts ; to encourage them  
to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain  
their place ia existence ; and to prepare them, in time, for  
that state of society, which, to bodily comforts, adds the im-  
provement of the mind and morals. We have therefore,  
liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry  
and houshold use: we have placed among them instructors  
in the arts of first necessity ; and they are covered with the  
zgis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves.  
  
Bui the endeavours to enlighten them on the fate which  
awaits their presents course of life, toinduce them to exer-  
cise tneir reason, follow its dictates, and change their pur-  
suit with the change of circumstances, have powerful obsta-  
cles to encounter. ‘They are combatted by the habits of  
their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and  
the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them,  
who feel themselves something in the present order of  
things, and fear to become nothingin any other. Those  
persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs  
of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be done  
through all time ; that reason is a false guide, and to advance  
under its counsel in their physical, moral, or political conditi-  
on, is perilous innovation: that their duty 1s to remain as  
their creator made them, ignorance being safety, and know-  
ledge full of danger. Inshort, my friends, among them  
ulso is seen the action and counter action of good sense and  
of bigotry. They too, have their anti-philosophists, who find  
un interest in keeping things in their present state ; who dread  
reformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the as-  
cendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason,  
wad obeying ils mandates.

| In giving these outlines, I do not mean, felldw-citizens,  
to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures. Thatis  
due, in the first place, to the reflecting character of our citi-  
zens at larve, who by the weight of public opinion, influence  
and strengthen the public measures: It is due to the sound  
discretion with which they sclect from among themselves  
those to whem they confide the legislative duties: It is due  
to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus seleciced, who  
lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome  
laws, the execution of which alone remains for others; and  
it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose patriot-  
ism has associated them with me in the executive functions.  
  
During this course of administration, and in order to dis-  
turb it, the artillery of the press has been levelled against us,  
charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or  
dare. ‘These abuses of an institution so important to free-  
dom and science, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as’  
they tend to lessen its usefulness, and to sap its safety. They  
might perhaps have been corrected by the wholesome pun-  
ishments reserved to, and provided by, the laws of the seve-  
ral states, against falsehood and defamation: But public  
duties, more urgent, press on the time of public servants, and  
the offenders have therefore been left to find their punish-  
ment in the public indignation.  
  
Nor was it uninteresting tothe world that an experiment  
should be fairly and fully made; whether freedom of discus-  
sion, unaided by power, is not sufficient for the propagation  
and protection of truth? Whether a government, conduct-  
ing itself in the true spirit of its constitution, with zeal and  
purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling the  
the whole world should witness, can be written down by false  
lood and defamation. The experiment has been ticd.—

be inforced. He who hastime, renders a service to public  
morals and public tranquility in reforming these abuses, by  
the salutary coertions of the law. But the experiment is  
noted to prove that, since truth and reason have maintained  
their ground against false opinions in league with false facts,  
the press, confined to truth needs no other legal restraint.  
The public judgment will correct false reasonings and opini-  
ons, on a full hearing of all partics, and no other definite  
line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the  
press, and its demoralising licentiousness. If there be still  
improprieties which this rule would not restrain, its supple-  
ment must be sought in the censorship of public opinion.  
  
Coritemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so  
generally, as auguring harmony and happiness to our future  
course, I offer to our counrty sincere congratulations. With  
those too, not yet rallied to the same point, the disposition to  
do so is gaining strength. Facts are piercing through the  
veil drawn over them; and our doubting brethren will at  
length see that the mass of their fellow citizens, with whom  
they cannot yet resolve to act, as to principles and measures,  
think as they think, and desire what they desive. ‘That our  
wish, as well as theirs, is that the public efforts may be direc-  
ted honestly to the public good, that peace be culivated, civil  
and religious liberty unassailed, law and order preserved,  
equality of rights maintained, and that state of property equal  
or unequal which results to every man from his own in-  
dustry or that of his fathers. When satisfied of these  
views, itis not in human nature that they should not approve  
and support them. Inthe mean time let us cherish them

with patient affection: let us do them justice, and more  
than justice, in all competitions of interest: and we need not  
doubt that truth, reason, and their own interests will at length  
prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and  
will complete that entire union of opinion, which gives to a  
nation the blessings of harmony, and the benefit of all its

I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens

principles which they have approved. I fear not that any  
motives of interest may lead me astray. I am sensible of  
no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path  
of justice ; but the weaknesses of human nature, and the li-  
mits of my own understanding, will produce errors of, judg-

therefore, all the indulgence I have heretofore experienced ;  
the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years.  
I shall need too, the favour of that Being in whose hgnds we  
are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native  
land, and planted them in a country flowing with all the ne-  
cessaries and comforts of life: who has covered our infancy  
with his providence, and our riper years with his wisdom  
and power; and to whose goodness I ask you to join with  
me in supplications, that he will so enlighten the minds of  
your servants, guide their councils and prosper their mea-  
sures, that whatsoever they do, shall result in their good, and  
shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation  
  
of all nations

On Monday, at 12 o&#x27;clock, THOMAS JEFFER­  
SON, President of the United States,  
took the oath of office, and delivered the follow -  
ing INAUGURAL SPEECH, in the Senate  
Chamber, in the presence of the of the  
two Houses, and a large concourse of citizens.  
SPEECH.  
PROCEEDING, fellow citizens, to that quali­  
fication which the constitution requires, before my  
entrance on the charge again conferred on me* it is  
my duty to express the deep&#x27; sense I entertain of  
this new proof of confidence from my fellow citi­  
zens at large, and the zeal with which it inspires  
me so to condua myself as may best satisfy their j  
just expectations.  
On taking this station on a former occasion, I  
declared the principles on which I believed it my  
duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth.  
My&#x27;conscience tells me that I have on every occa­  
sion acted up to that declaration, according to its  
obvious import, and to the understanding of every  
candid mind.  
In the transaaion of your foreign affairs, we have  
endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations,  
and especially of those with which we have the  
most important relations. We have done them  
justice on all occasions, favor where favor was law­  
ful, and cherished mutual interests and intercourse  
on fair and equal terms. We are firmly convinced,  
and we aa on that conviaion, that with nations,  
as with individuals, our interests, soundly calcu­  
lated, will ever be found inseparable from our mo­  
ral duties. And history bears witness to the fact,  
that a just nation is trusted on its word, when re­  
course is had to armaments and wars to bridle  
others.  
At home, fellow-citizens, you best know whe­  
ther we have done well or ill. ihe suppression of  
unnecessary offices, of useless establishments and  
expences, enabled us to discontinue our internal  
taxes. The»&gt;e, covering our land with officers, and  
opening our doors to their intrusions, had already  
begun that process of domiciliary vexation, which,  
once entered, is scarcely to be restrained from  
reaching successively every aricle of produce and  
of property. If, among these taxes, some minor •  
ones fell, which had not been inconvenient, it was  
because their amount would not have paid the of­  
ficers who collected them, and because, if they  
had any merit, the state authorities might adopt  
them, instead of others less approved.  
The remaining revenue on the consumption of  
foreign articles, is paid chiefly by those who can af­  
ford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts.  
Being collcaed on our sea board and frontiers on­  
ly, and incorporated with the transactions of our  
mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and the  
pride of an American to ask what farmer, what me­  
chanic, what labourer ever sees a tax-gatherer of  
the United States ? These contributions enable  
us to support the current expenses of the govern­  
ment, to fulfill contraas with foreign nations, to  
extinguish the native right of soil within our li­  
mits, to extend those limits, and to apply such a  
surplus to our public debts, as places at a short  
day their final redemption, and that redemption  
once effeaed, the revenue, thereby liberated, may,

ponding amendment

witness to the&#x27;fact, that a just na-

At home, fellow-citizens, you  
best know whether we have done

necessary offices, of useless estab-  
  
iisnmenis ana expences, enabled  
lift -r i a  
  
&#x27; 11 te ma i tax  
es. These covering our land with  
officers,, and opening our doors to  
their intrusions, had already begun  
that progress of domiciliary vexa­  
tion, which, once entered, is scarce­  
ly to be restrained from reaching  
  
succcsively every article of prr-  
duce 2nd of property. If, among  
thesexaxes, some minor ones fell,  
which had not been inconvenient, it  
was because their amount would  
not have paid the officers who col­  
lected them, and because, if they  
had any merit, the state authorities  
hiight adopt them; instead of others  
less approved..  
The remaining revenue on the  
consumption of foreign articles, is  
paid chiefly by those who can af­  
ford to add foreign luxuries to do­  
mestic comforts. Being collected  
on our sea-board and frontiers on­

actions of &#x27;our mercantile citizens,  
it may be the pleasure and the pride  
of an American to ask what farmer,  
what mechanic, what labourer, e­  
ver sees a tax-gatherer of the U ni­  
ted States ? These contributions  
enable us to support the current ex­  
pences of the government, to fulfil  
contracts with foreign nations, to  
extinguish the native right of soil  
within our limits, to extend, those  
limits, and to apply such a surplus  
to our public debts, as places at a  
short day their final redemption ;  
and that redemption once effected,  
the revenue thereby liberated, may,  
by a just repartition among the  
States, and a corresponding a­  
mendment of the Constitution, be  
applied, in time ofpeace, to rivers,  
canals roads, arts, manufactures,  
education and other great objects  
within each State. In time f war,  
if injustice by ourselves or others  
must sometimes produce war, in.  
creased, as the same revenue will  
be by increased population and con­  
sumption, and aided by other re­  
sources,&quot; reserved for that crisis, it  
may meet within the year all the  
expences of the year, without en­  
croaching on the rights of futnre  
genej-ations, by burtheuing them  
with the debts of the past. War  
will then be but a suspension of use­  
ful works&quot;, and a return to a state  
  
of peace, a return to the progress  
of improvement.  
I have said, fellow-citizens, that  
the income reserved had enabled us &#x27;  
to extend our limits ; but that ext  
tension may possibly pay for itself ; .  
before we are called on, and in the  
mean time may keep down the ac­  
cruing interest. In, all events, it  
will replace the advances we shall  
have made. I know that the ac­  
quisition of Louisiana has been dis  
approved by some, from a candid  
apprehension that the enlargement  
of our territory may endanger its  
union j- but who can limit the ex­  
tent to which the federative princi­  
ple may operate effectively? The  
larger our association, the less will  
it be shaken by local passions, and  
in any view, is it not better that the  
opposite bank of the Mississippi  
should be settled by our own bre­  
thren and children, than by stran­  
gers of another family? With which  
shall we be most likely to live in  
harmony and friendly intercourse ?  
In matters of religion I have con­  
sidered that its free exercise is pla­  
ced by the constitution independent  
of the powers of the general go­  
vernment, I have therefore un­  
dertaken, on no occasion, to pre­  
scribe the religious exercises suited  
to it ; but have left them, as the  
constitution found them, under the  
direction and discipline of the state  
or church authoritiesacknowIedged  
by the several religious societies.  
The aboriginal inhabitants of  
these countries, I have regarded  
with the commiseration their histo­  
ry inspires&#x27;. Endowed with the fa.  
cuities and the rightsof men,breath­  
ing anardent love of liberty and in­  
dependence, and occupying a coun­  
try which left them no desire but  
to be undisturbed, the stream of  
overflowing population from ether  
regions directed itself on these  
shores. Without power to divert,  
or habits to contend against it, they

Tent, or dt :vc.i before it. Now re  
educed within limits too narrow for  
the hunter state, humanity enjoins  
&quot;us to teach them agrirulture and the  
domestic pi ts j to encourage thum  
.to that industry which alone can en­  
able thtm to maintain their place in  
-existence, &amp; to prepare them in-time  
fjr that state oT society, whVeh, ti  
bodily comforts, acldi the improve­

.them wilh the implements of hus­  
bandry and household use : we  
have p-aced among them instruc­  
tors in the arts of first necessity  
and they are covered with the segis  
of the law against aggressors from  
among ourselves.  
13ut the endeavours to enlighten  
them on the fate which waits their  
present course of life, to induce  
them to exercise their reason, fol­  
low its dictates, and change their  
pursuits with the change of cir­  
rumstanceSjhavepoverful obstacles  
to encounter. &#x27;J &#x27;hey are combated  
by the habits of their bodies, pre­  
judices of their minds,, ignorance,  
pride, and the influence of interes­  
ted and crafty individuals among  
them, who feel themselves- some­  
thing in the present order of things,  
and fear to become nothing in any  
  
other. These persons inculcate a  
sanctimonious icveicnce for the  
customs of their ancestors ; that  
whatsoever they did must be done  
through all time ; that reason is a  
false guide, and to advance under  
its council iq their physical, moral,  
or political condition, is perilous  
innovation : that their duty is to  
remain as their Creator made them,  
ignorance being safety, and know­  
ledge full of danger. .In short,  
my friends., among them also is  
seen the action ana counter-action  
of good sense and of bigotry.  
They too have theiranti-philoso-phists,  
who find an interest in keep­  
ing things in their present state,  
who dread reformation, and exert  
all their. facuhiel? &#x27;to maintain the  
ascendancy of habit over the duty  
of improving our reason and obey­  
ing its mandates.  
In giving these outlines, I do not  
mean, fellow-citizen to arrogate to  
myself the merit of the measures.  
  
i hat is due, in the first place, to the  
reflecting character of our citizens at  
large who, by the weight of public  
opinion, influence and strengthen tha  
pujdic measures.- It is due lo the sound  
discretion with which they select from  
among themselves those to whom they  
confide the legislative duties. It is  
due to the ,zt:ii and wisdom cf the  
character jLus ick&#x27;cttd, who lay the  
fcLi.c&#x27;.atlcns cf vl ::c Trrrir.tts in  
  
( 2 )  
wholesome laws, the, execution of  
which alone remains for others ; and  
it is due to the able and faithful aux­  
iliaries, whose patriotism has asso­  
ciated them with me in the executive  
functions.  
During this course of administra­  
tion, and in order to disturb it, the ar­  
tillery of the press has been levelled  
against us, charged with whatsoever  
its licentiousness cou&#x27;.d devise or  
dare. These abuses of an institution  
so important to freedom and science,  
are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch  
as they tend to lessen its usefulness,  
and to sap its safety. They might  
perhaps have been corrected .by. the  
wholesome punishments reserved to,  
and provided by the laws of the seve  
  
ral states against falsehood and defa­  
mation. Bui public duties more ur­  
gent press on the time of public ser­  
vants, and the offenders have there­  
fore been left to find their punish­  
ment in the public indignationt  
Nor was it uninteresting to the wor d  
taat an experiment should be iaw iy  
and fully made, whether freedom cf  
discussion, unaided by power, is not  
sufficient for the propagation Stjprotec­  
tion of truth ? Whether a government  
cpnducting itself in the true spirit o:  
its constitution, with zeal and pin it,  
and doing no act which it wcu!d &#x27;e  
unwilling the whole world should  
witness, can be written down by  
falsehood and defamation ? The ex­  
periment has been tried. You have  
witnessed the scene. Ourfcllpw-ci-tizens  
have looked on cool and col­  
lected. They saw the latent source  
from which these outrages proceeded.  
They gathered around their public  
functionaries : and when the consti­  
tution called them lo the decision by  
suffrage, they pronounced their ver­  
dict, honorable to those who had  
served them, and consolatory to the  
friend of mar, who believes he may  
be entrusted with the control of his  
own affairs. &#x27;  
No inference is here intended that  
the laws provided by the states a­  
gainst false and defamatory publica­  
tions should not be enforced. He  
who has time, renders a service to  
public morals and public tranquillity?  
in reforming these abuses by the sa­  
lutary coercions o I the law. But the  
experiment is noted to prove, that  
since truth and reason have main,  
tained their ground against false o.  
pi.iious in league with false facts, the  
press, confined to truth, &quot;needs no  
other legal restraint. The public  
judgment will correct false reason­  
ings .and opinions, on a full hearing  
of all parlies, and no other definite  
line can be drawn between the. ines­  
timable liberty of the press, and its  
demoralising licentiousness. If there  
be still improprieties which this rule  
would not restrain, its supplement  
imist be. sought in the consottp cf  
public cpiruon.  
  
Contemplaing the! union of sen&#x27;.i.  
ment now manifested so generally,  
as auguring harmony and -happiness  
to our future course, I cfl&#x27;er to enr  
u.nvy sh.cere congratulation,.  
With those too not yet rallied to the  
same point, the disposition to do so  
is gaining strength. Pacts are pier.  
cmg through the veil drawn over  
them ; and cur doubting &quot;brethren  
wii at length see that the mass of  
their fellow-citizens, with whom  
they cannot yet resolve to act, as to  
principles and measures,- think a3  
they think, and desire what they de­  
sire. That cur wish, as well as theirs  
is, that the public efforts may be di­  
rected honestly to the public good,  
that peace be cultivated, civil and re­  
ligious liberty unassailed, law end  
order -preseived, equality cf rights  
maintained, and that state of propsrtv  
equal or unequal, which resul.s to  
every man from his own industry or  
that&#x27;bfhis fathers. When satisfied  
of these views, it is not in human r.a­  
ture that they should not approve  
and support them. In the mean&#x27;  
time let ,U3 cherish them with pa.  
li&#x27;ent&#x27;.affection. JLet-us do &#x27;them jus­  
tice,. And more than&#x27; justice, jn ajt  
competitions of interest : and we  
heed not doubt that truth, reason, and  
their o-. n interests will atLngth pre­  
vail, will gather them .into the fold f  
their country, and will compleut that  
entire union of opinion, which gives  
to a nation the blessings of harmony,  
and the benefit of all i s stienelh.  
I sha&#x27;.l now enter on the duties to  
which my fellow citizens have again  
called me: and shad proceed in the  
spirit of those principles v hich they  
have approved. I fear not that any  
motives of .interest may lead me a­  
stray ; I&#x27; am&#x27; sensibl-of no passicn  
which could seduce rife- knowingly  
from- the path of justice ; but the  
weaknesses of human nature, ard the  
limits of my own understanding, will  
produce errors of judgment some­  
times, injurious to your interests. I  
shall need therefore all the indul­  
gence Thave heretofore experienced ;  
the want of it will certainly not lessen  
with increasing years. I shall need  
to the ft your of that Being in whose  
hands we -fere who led, our fathers,  
as Israei of old, from their native  
land, and planted them in a. country  
flowing with all the necessaries and  
comforts of life : who has covered

&#x27; Proceeding, fellow-citizens, to that qualification  
Which the constitution requires, before my entrance  
on the charge again conferred on me, it is my duty to  
express the deep sense I&#x27;entertain of this new proof  
of confidence from my fellow-citizens at large, and  
the zeal with which it inspires mre so to conduct my­  
self as may best satisfy their just expectations.  
On taking this station on a former occasion, I de­  
clared the principles on which I believed it my duty  
to administer the affairs of our commonwealth. My  
conscience tells me that I have on every occasion acted  
vft fo that declaration according to its obvious im/iort,  
and to the understanding of every candid mind.  
7*^ In the. transaction of your foreign affairs, we have  
- endeavoured to cultivate the friendship of all nati­

ops, and especially of those with which we have the  
most important relations. We have done them jus­  
tice on all occasions, favour where favour was lawful,  
and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on  
fair and equal terms ; we are firmly convinced, and  
we act on that conviction, that .with nations, as with  
individuals, our interests, soundly calculated, will  
ever be found inseparable from our moral duties.  
And history bears soilness to the fact, that a just na­  
tion is trusted on its word, when recourse is had to  
armaments and wars to bridle others.  
v At home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether  
we have done well or ill. The suppression of un­  
necessary offices, qf useless establishments and expen­  
ees, enabled us to discontinue our^fiitemal taxes.  
These, covering our land with officers, and opening  
&#x27; Cur doors to their intrusions, had already begun that  
process of domiciliary vexation, which, once entered,  
is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successive­  
ly every article of produce and of property. If  
among these taxes, some minor ones fell, which had  
not been inconvenient, it was because&#x27;their amount  
would not have paid the officers who collected them,  
and because, if they had any merit,! the state au­  
thorities might adopt them, instead of others less ap­  
proved. j  
The remaining revenue on the consumption of  
foreign articles, is paid chiefly by those who can af­  
ford to add foreign luxuries to domcstick Comforts.  
Being Collected oii our sea-board anjl frontiers only,  
; and ineorjrorated with the transactions of our mer­  
cantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and the pride  
of an American to ask whatfarmcr, what mechanick,  
whaf labourer, ever sees a tax-gatherer of the United  
Stiff es? These contributions enable us to support  
fhtt current expenses of the government, to fulfil  
contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the na­  
tivg. right of soil within our limits, to extend those  
limits, and to apply such a surplus fo our puhlick  
debts, as places, at a short day, their final redemption,  
and that redemption once effected, the revenue there­  
by liberated, may, by a just repartition among the  
states, and a corresponding amendment of the const i­  
, tut ion, be appliod, in time of peace, to fivers, canals,  
roads, arts, manufactures, education, and other great  
objects within euc.h state. In time of war, if injustice  
by o|}j&gt;elvcs or others must sometimes produce war,  
i;«aaea«etl»as.the-same revenue will bf by increased  
population and consumption, and aided1 by other re­  
•sourtaw. reserved for that crisis, it may meet within  
Jiie year all dice ape a iesof the year, without encroach­  
ing on the rights of future generations, Jby Imrthening

birra suspension tfiiseful works, and a return to a

*v I nave »i|d, tellow-citixens, mat the income re­  
served had enabled us to extend our limits; but that  
-extension may possibly pay for itself before we are  
Called onj and in the mean time may keep down the  
accruing interest. In all events it will replace the  
advances we shall have made. I know that the ac­  
quisition of I Louisiana has been disapproved by some,  
from a candid apprehension that thp enlargement of  
our territory may endanger its union ; but who can  
Bnut the extent to which the federative principle  
may operate etfectively ? The larger our associa­  
tion, (he leu it mil be shaken b j Iqcal passions, and  
in any view, is it not better that the opposite haf.k of  
the-Mississippi should be settled by our own brethern  
and children, than by strangers of uuotlier family ?  
With which shall we be most likely to live in har­  
mony and friendly intercourse!  
In matters of religion I have considered that its  
free exercise is placed by the constitution indepen­  
dent of the powers of the general government. 1  
have therejore undertaken, on no occasion, to pre­  
scribe the religion? exercises suited to it ; but have  
h;/i then, as the constitution found them, under the!  
direction and discipline; of the stale or church au­  
thorities acknowledged by the ,several religious so­  
cieties, . f &gt;*  
&quot;The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries, I  
have regarded with the commiseration their history  
inspires. /Cjfi.Werf with the faculties and the right*  
then, brtathing an ardent lave of liberty and in­  
dependence? and occupying a country which left  
them nti desikm but to be undisturbed, the stream qf  
k * ovnflowng population from other regions directed  
gi;. itself on these shores. Without  
power to divert, or  
? habits to contend against’It, they have been over­  
whelmed ^ the current, or driven before it. Now  
reduced Within li/nits too narrow for the hunter  
state, humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture  
and the domestick arts ; to encourage them to that  
&#x27;■ industry wrhieh alone cap enable them to maintain  
their place in existence, and to prepare them So  
time for that state of society, which to bodily com­  
forts. adds the improvement of the mind and morals.

. But the endeavours tip enlighten them pn the. fate  
which awaits their present cpSrse of life, to induce  
them to exercise their reason, follow it* diefatei, and  
change their pursuits with tile change of circum­  
stances, have powerful obstacles to encounter. They  
are combated by the habits of their bodies, preju­  
dices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the in­  
fluence of interested and crafty individuals among  
them, who feel themselves something in the present  
order of things, and fear to become nothing in any  
other. Theseperson* inculcate a sanctimonious re­  
verence for the customs of their ancestor a; that  
whatsoever they did ttiiuf be done through all lime ;  
that reason is a false guid«,«ud to advance under its  
counsel in their physical,’mOTal, or political condition,  
is perilous innovation : that their duty is to remain as  
their Creator made them, ignorance being safety, and  
knowledge full of danger. In short, my friends, a­  
mong them also is seen the action and counter-action  
of good sense and of bigotry. They too have their  
anii./ihilosophisls, who fnd an interest in keeping  
things in their present state ; who dread reformation,  
and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendan­  
cy of Habit over the duty of improving our reason  
and obeying its mandates.  
In giving these outlines, I do not mean, fellow-ci­  
tizens, to arrogate to myself the merit of the mea- ;  
sin es. That is due, in the first place, to the refiect­  
; ing character of our citizens at large, who, by the  
weight of puhlick opinion, influence and strengthen  
I the publick measures. It is due to the sound discrc­  
[ tion with which they select from among themselves  
those to whom they confide the legislative duties. It  
i is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus  
j selected, who lay the foundations of publick happiness  
J in wholesome laws, the execution of which alone re­  
mains for others : and it is due to the able and faith*  
‘ ful auxiliaries, whose patriotism has associated them  
with me in the executive functions. j  
During this course of administration, and in or­  
der to disturb it, the artillery of the press has been  
levelled against us, charged with whatsoever its  
licentiousness could devise or dare. These abuses  
, of an institution so important to freedom, and sci­  
ence, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they  
tend to lessen its usefulness, and to sap its safety.  
They might perhaps have been corrected by the  
wholesome punishments reserved to,and provided by,  
the laws of the several states against falsehood and  
defamation. But publick duties more urgent press  
an the lime of publick servants, and the offenders  
have iherefor(\been left to fnd their punishment in the  
publick indignation.  
  
Nor was it uninteresting to trie world mat an experi­  
ment sliould be fairly and fully made, whether free,  
dom of discussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient  
for the propagation and protection of truth ? whether  
a government, conducting itself in the true spirit of  
its constitution, with zeal and purity, and doing no  
act which it would be unwilling the whole world  
should witness, can be written down by falsehood  
and defamation.—The experiment has been tried.—  
You have witnessed the scene. Our fellow-citizens  
have loooked on cool and collected. They saw the  
latent source from which these outrages proceeded.  
They gatiiered around their publick functionaries :  
andwhen the constitution called them to the decision  
by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honour­  
alile to those who had served them, and consolatory  
to the friend of man, who believes he may be entrust­  
ed with the controul of his own affairs.  
No inference is here intended that the laws pro­  
vided by the states against false and defamatorypub­  
lications should not be enforced. He who has time,  
renders a service to publick morals and publick  
tranquillity, in reforming these abuses by the saluta­  
ry coercions of the law. But the experiment is noted  
to prove that, since truth and reason have maintain­  
ed their ground against false opinions in league with  
false facts, the press, confined to truth, needs no o­  
ther legal restraint. The publick judgment willcor­  
rect false reasonings and opinions, on a full hearing  
of all parties, and no other definite line can be drawn  
between the inestimable liberty of the press, and its  
demoralizing licentiousness. If there be still impro­  
prieties which this rule would not restrain, its sup­  
plement must be sought in the censorship of publick  
opinion.  
Contemplating the union of sentiment now mani­  
fested so generally, as auguring harmony and happi­  
ness to our future&quot; course I offer to our country sincere  
congratulations. With those, too, not yet rallied to  
the .same point, the disposition to do so is gaining  
strength. Facts are piercing through the veil drawn  
over them; and our doubting brethren will at length  
see that the mass of their fellow-citizens, with whom  
they cannot yet resolve to act, as to principles and  
measures, think as they think, and desire what they  
desire. That our wish, as well as theirs, is that the  
publick efforts may be directed honestly to the pub­  
lick good, that peace be cultivated, civil and religi­  
ous liberty unassailed, law and order preserved, e­  
qualitv of rights maintained, and that state of pro­  
perty &quot;equal or unequal, which results to every man  
from his own industry or that of his fathers. When  
satisfied of these views, it is not in human nature  
that they should not approve and support them. In  
[the mean time let us cherish them with patient af­  
fection. Let us do them justice, and more than jus­  
tice, in all competitions of interest: and we need  
not doubt that truth, reason, and their pwn interests,  
will at length prevail, will gather them into the fold  
of their country, and will complete that entire union  
of opinion, which gives to a nation the blessings of  
harmonv, and the benefit of all its strength.  
I shall now enter on the dutities to which my fel­  
low-citizens have again called me: and shall pro­  
ceed in the spirit of those principles which they have  
approved. Ifear not that any motives of interest may  
lead me astray. I am sensible of no passion which  
could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice ;  
hut the weaknesses of human nature, and the limits  
if my own understanding, will produce errours of  
udgment sometimes injurious to your interests. I  
ihall need therefore all the indulgence I havehereto­  
&#x27;qre experienced ; the want of it will certainly not  
essen with increasing years. I shall need, too, the  
ravour of that Being in whose hands we are, who led,  
mr fathers, as Israel of old,from their native land,  
md planted them in a country flowing with alt the  
icccssuriee and comforts of life: who has covered  
m+in fancy with his providence, and our riper year  
with his wisdom and power : and to. whose goodnei^  
Task you to.join with me in supplications, that he  
will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide  
heir councils, and prosper their measures, that what­  
ioever they do, shall result in your good, and shall sc­  
:ure to you the peace,friendship, and approbation  
fall nations.

PROCEEDING, fellow-citizen*, to  
tr.»t qualification which the consti­  
tution requires, before my entrance on  
the charge again conferred on me, it is  
mv duty to express the deep sense I en­  
tertain of this new proof of confidence  
from my fellow-citizens «t Urge, *nd  
the zeal witn which it inspire* me »o to  
conduct lit aril as may best Satisfy their  
just expectations. •  
On taking this station on a former cc­  
casion,! declared the principles on which  
I believed it my duty to administer the  
affairs of our commonwealth. My con­  
science tells me that I have on every oc­  
casion acted up to that declaration, ac- .  
cording to it* (fftvious import, and to the  
understanding of every candid mind*  
In the transactio* of foreign affairs, I  
we have endeavoured to cultivate the  
friendship of all nations, and especially  
with those with whom we have the most  
important relations. We have done them  
jottics on all occasions, favor where fa­  
vor was lawful, and cherished mutual  
interests and intercourse on fair and e­  
qual terms. We are firmly convinced,  
and we act on that conviction, that with !  
nations, as with individuals, «ur inte- &#x27;  
rest*, soundly calculated, will ever be |  
found inseparable from our moral duties, i  
And history bears witness to the fact,  
that a just nation is trusted on its word^  
when recourse is had to armaments and  
wars tn bridle others.  
At home, fellow-citizens, you best  
know whether we have done well or ill.  
T he suppression of unnecessary offices,  
of useless establishments and expenses,  
enabled w« to discontinue nur internal  
taxes. These, covering our land with  
officers, and opening our donrs to their  
intrusions, had already begun that pro­  
cess nf domiciliary vexation, which,  
once entered, is scarcely to be restrain­  
ed Irom coaching successively every ar­  
ticle of produce and of property. If, a­  
mong these taxes, some minor ones fell,  
w hich had not hern inconvenient, it was  
because their amount would not have  
paid the officers who collected them, and  
because, if they had an) merit, the state  
  
authorities might adopt them, instead of  
others less approved.  
The remaining revenue on the con*  
sumption of foreign articles, is paid  
chiefly by those who tan afford foreign  
luxuries to domestic comforts. Being  
collected on our seaboard and frontiers  
only, and incorporated with the transac­  
tions of our mercantile citizens, it may  
be the pleasure and die pride of a* Ame­  
rican to ask what farmer, what mecha­  
nic, what labourer, ever sees a tax ga­  
therer of the United States ? These  
contributions enable us to support the  
current expenses of the government, to  
fulfil contracts with foreign nations, to  
extinguish the native right of soil within ^  
our limits, to extend those limits, and  
to apply such a surplus to our public  
debts, as places at a short day the ir final  
redemption, and that redemption once  
effected, the revenue, thereby liberated,  
may, by a just repartition among the  
states, and a corresponding amendment  
of the constitution, be applied, in time  
of peace, to rivers, canals, roads, aits,  
manufactures, education and other great  
objects within each state. In time ‘fxttur,  
if injustice bv nursc-lvas or others must  
somttimes produce war, increased an  
the same revenue will be by increased  
populition and consumption, and aided  
by otier resources, reserved for that  
crisis, it may meet within the year all  
the etpenses of the year, without en­  
croaching on the rights of future genera­  
tions. by burthening them w ith the debts  
of the past. War will then be but a sus­  
pension of useful win ks, and a return to  
a sialVol peace, a return to the progress  
of improvement.  
  
I have said, k-Uow-citizens, that the  
income rrstrvtd had enabled us to ex­  
tend our limits ; but that extension may  
possibly pay for itself be loro we arc call­  
ed on, and in the mean time anay keep  
down the accruing interest. In all e­  
vents it will replace the advances we have  
made. I know that the acquisition of  
Louisiana has been disapproved bv some,  
from a candid apprehension that ah cn­  
largcmcntof our territory may endanger  
its union. But who can iimet (he extent  
t» which the federative principle may  
aerate effectively ? The larger our as­  
sociation, the le ss will it be shaken by  
lscal passions. And in any view, is it  
better that the opposite bank of the  
Mississippi should be settled by our own  
brethren and children, than bv strange is  
Of another family? With which shall  
-tve be likely to live in most harmony au&lt;J  
friendly intercourse ?  
In matters of religoir, I have consi­  
dered that its free exercise is placed by  
•he constitution, independent of the pow­  
ers of the general government. 1 hJV»  
therefore undertaken, on no occasion,  
to prescribe the religious exercises suit­  
ed to it r but have left them, as the con­  
stitution found them, under the directi­  
on and discipline of the state or church  
authorities acknowledged by the several  
religious societies.  
  
inc aaoi iginai inhabitants of these  
countries, I have regarded with the cons,  
mitacration their history inspires. En­  
dowed with the faculties and the right*  
of men, breathing an ardent love of li.  
berty and independence, and occupying  
a country which left them no desire but  
to be undisturbed, the stream of over­  
flowing population from other regions  
directed itself on these shores. Without  
i P°&#x27;ver to divert, or habits to contend a­  
I gainst it, thay have been overwhelmed  
I bv the current, or driven before it. Now  
I reduced within limits too narrow for the  
I hunter state, humanity enjoins us to  
j teach them agriculture and the domestic  
V eBcouraSc «hem «o that industry  
which alone can enable them to maintain  
their place in existence, and to prepare  
them in time for that state of society,  
which, to bodily comforts, adds the im­  
provement of the mind and morals. We  
have therefore liberally furnished them  
with the implements of husbandry and  
household ase; wc have placed among  
them instructor* in the arts of first ae­  
ccssity i and they arc covered with the  
aigisafthe law againat aggressors from

but the eadeavourato enlighten them  
on die fate which awaits their present

their reason, follow its dictates, and  
change their pursaits with the change of  
circumstances, have powerful obstacles  
to encounter. They are combated bv  
the habits of their bodies, prejudices of  
their minds, ignorance, pride, and the  
influence a! interested and craftv indivi­  
duals among tham, who feel themselves  
something in the present order of thincr.  
and fear to become nothing in any othci.

false guide, and to advance under it»  
Counsel in their physical, moral, or |&gt;-&gt;­  
liticalcondition, is perrilous innovation;  
that their duty is to remain as their crea­  
tor made them, ignorance being safety, j  
and knowledge full of danger. In short, t  
mv friends, among them also is seen the  
action and counter-action of good sense !  
and bigotry. Ihev too have their anti-j  
philosophic, who find an interest ini  
keeping things in their present state ; I­  
who dread reformation, and exert all  
their faculties to maintain the ascenden­  
cy of habit over the duty of improving  
cur reason and obeying its mandates. j  
In gi ving these outlines, I do not mean  
fellow-citizens, to arrogate to myself  
the merit of the measures. That is due,  
in the first place, to.the reflecting cha­  
racter of our citizens at large, who, hv  
the weight of public opinion, influence  
and strengthen the public measures. It  
is due to the sound discretion with whir h  
they select from among themselves those  
to whom they confide the legislative du­  
ties. It is duet# the zeal and wisdom]  
of the characters thus selected, who lay  
the foundations ot public happiness in  
wholesome laws, the execution ot which  
•lone remains for others : an&lt;- it is  
to the able andfaithfulauxi’.iarics, whose  
patriotism has associated them with me

and in order to disturb it, the artillery ol

ness could devise or dare. These abu­  
ses of an institution so important to free­  
dom and science, are deeply tobe regret­  
ted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its  
t sefulness, and sap its safety. They  
might perhaps have been corrected by  
the wholsesomc punishments reserved  
to, and provided by, ih« lairs ot the se­  
veral stales a grins t falsehood and defa­  
mation. Bui public d Kies more urgent  
press mi the time of public servants and  
the offender* hare therefore been left to  
find their punishment in the public indig­  
nation.  
  
&gt;  
t  
IN or was it uninurettiD^ to me worm  
that an experiment should be fairly and ;  
full&#x27;v made, whether freedom of discus­  
sion, unaided l»y power, is not sufficient  
for the propagation and protection of  
truth l Whether a government conduct­  
ing itseU in the true spirit of its consti­  
tution, with real and purity, and doing  
no act which it would be unwilling the !  
whole world should witness, can be 1  
written doen by fsiweftootl defama­  
tion.— The experiment has been tried.  
You have witnessed the scene-Our  
fellow-citizens have looked on tool and  
collected. They saw the latent Source  
from which these outrages proceeded..— !  
They guheredaround their public func- .  
tionaries : and when the constitution  
called them to the decision by suffrage,  
they pronounced their verdict, honoura­  
ble to those who had served them, and  
consolatory to the lrieird of man, who  
believes he may be entrusted with the  
controul of his own affairs.  
No inference is here intended that the  
laws proviJed bv the states against false  
and defamatory publications, should not  
be enforced. Hewhohaslime, renders  
s service to public moralsand public tran­  
quility, in reforming these abuses by the  
salutsrv coercions of the law. But the  
experiment is noted to prove thst, since  
truth and reason have maintained their  
ground against false opinions in league  
with false facts, the press, conaned to  
truth, needs no other legal restraint.  
The puldfc judgment will correct false  
reasonings and opinions, on a lull hear- |  
iag of all parties, and no other definite  
line can be drawn between the inestima­  
ble liberty of the press, and ita demoral­  
ising licentiousness. If there be still  
improprieties which this rule would not  
restrain, its supplement must be sought  
in the censorship of public opinion.  
Contemplating the union of sentiment  
now manifested so generally, as augur­  
ing harmonv and happiness to our future ,  
course, I offer to our country sincere &#x27;  
congratulations. With those too not yet 1  
rallied ts the same point, the disposition  
to do so is gaining strength. Facts are  
piercing through the veil drawn over j  
them ; and our doubting brethren will j  
at length see thxtths mass of their fellow j  
citizens, with whom they cannot yet re- |  
sotve to act, as to principles and nsca- ]  
sores, think as they think, aqd desire i  
what they desire. Thst our wish, as  
well as theirs, is that the public efforts  
may be directed honestly to the public  
good, that peace be cultivated, civil and  
religious liberty unassatlcd, law and or­  
der preserved, equality of rights main­  
tainad, and that state of property equal  
or unequal, which-, results to every man  
♦Vim lus own industry or that ol his fa­  
thers. When satisfied ol lltese \ ic ws,  
  
it is nnt in human naturethatthey should  
nut approve and support them. In thu  
mean time let us cherish thena with.^pa­  
tient affection. Let us do them justice,  
ami more than justice, in all competiti­  
ons of interest: and we need not doubt  
that truth, reason, and their own inte­  
rests will at length prevail, will gather  
them into the l*»ld of their country, and  
will c« n pleat their entire union of opini­  
on, w hii h gives to a nation the blessings  
of harmoit), and the benefit of all its  
strength.  
I shall now enter on the duties to  
which my fellow citizens have again call- i  
ed i»t : and shall proceed in the spirit of !  
those principles vs hivh they have approv­  
ed. I fear not that any motives ol inte­  
rest may lead me astray : I am sensible ol j  
no passion which could reduce me know- 1  
inglv lroih the path ol justice ; but the  
weaknesses of hu.nan nature, and the li.  
inits of nty own understanding will aro  
due# errors ol judgment sometimes in­  
: jnrious to- your interest. I sled! need  
1 therefore all the indulgence I have hcre­  
! tofore experienced ; the want of it wrll  
| certainly not lessen with increasing \ t it s.  
j 1 shall need too the favour of that Being  
, in whose hands we arc, w ho led our U­  
I tlicrs, as Israel ot old, from their nativn  
; land, and planted them in a country flow­  
ing with ail the necessaries and comforts  
1 of life: who has covered our infancy  
I with hi* providence and our riper tear*  
I with his wisdom and power: and to  
v. hose goodness I ask you to join with  
me in supplications, that he will so tu­  
j lighten the noindsofyour servants, guide  
I their councils, and prosper their mea­  
; sures, that whatsoever they do, shall re­  
j suit in vour good, and shall aecure to

Proceeding, fellow cir&gt;rn% to that qualifica­  
tion which the cufiftiiution requires, before  
my entrance on the cha^c again confer­  
red on me, if is my duty to rxpren the deep  
Uutfc l entertain ot this new proof of confidence  
from my fcllow-citirtns at iarge, and the zeal  
with which if mtpires me fo to conduit my­  
icif as may beil i’atbfy their juft expecta­  
tions.  
On taking this ftaticn on a former cCcafion,  
T declared the principles on which 1 believed it  
tty duty to adminifttr the zlfairs of our com­  
monwealth. M* conference tells md that I have  
on every occafion z£cd upon that declaration,  
according to its obvious import, and to the un­  
demanding of every candid mind.  
In the tranfafhon of your foreign affairs, we  
have endeavoured to cultivate the Iriendfhip of  
all nations, and efpecialiy of thofe with which  
we have the nioflT important relations. We  
h*ve done them juftke on all occafions, favored  
where favor was lawful, and chcrilhed mutual  
interests and ir.tercourie on fair and equal terms.  
We arc f:rm!v convinced, and we aon that  
conviction, th2t with nations, as with individu­  
als, our interefts foundly calculated, will ever be  
found mlcperable from our moral duties. And  
hiftory bears wirnefs to the fa&amp;, that a juft na­  
tion ’s trufted on its word, when recourse is had  
to armaments and wars to bridle others.  
At home, fellow—citizens, you beft krov  
whether we have done w&#x27;ell or ill. ihe fup­  
pre.Tion of unncceflary offices, of ufdefs eftab­  
iifhmentsand expenses, enable us to difeontinue  
©ur internal taxes. Thcfe, covering our land  
  
with omcers, and opening our doors to their m­  
trufior.s, had already begun that procccs of dom­  
iciliary vexation, which, once entered, is fcarce­  
lytobc rc lira in dh from reaching fucceffively er- 1  
try article of produce and of property. If, a­  
mong thefe taxes, fomc minor once fell, which  
had not been inconvenient, it wasbecaufe their  
amount would not have paid the officers who  
collc&amp;ed them, 2nd bccauie, if they had any  
merit the liatc authorities might ad pt them, ia­  
ftcad of others ick approved.  
The remaining revenue on the confumption  
of foreign articles, is paid chiefly by thofe who,  
can afford to add foreign luxuries to domeftic  
comforts. Being collc£tcd on our feaboard arc*  
frontiers only, and incorporated with the  
tranfa&amp;ions of our mercantile citizens, it may  
be the plcafure and the pride of an American  
to afk what farmer, what mechanic, what la­  
bourer ever fees a tax gatherer of the United |  
States ? Thefe contributions enaoie u« to fup­  
port the current expenfes of the government, to  
fulfil contracts with foreign nations, to extin­  
guifh the native right of foil within our limits,  
to extend thofe limits, 2nd to apply fuch a lur­  
plus to our public debts, at a ihort day the  
final redemption, and that redemption once af­  
le&amp;ed, the revenue, thereby liberated may by a  
juft reparation among ftates, and a correfpon*  
ding amendment of the conllitutioi, be applied,  
in titne of peace, to rivers, canals, roads, arts, man­  
ttfa&amp;uries, education and other great objects  
within each ftate. In time c* War, if injuftice  
by ourfclves or others mutt iometimes produce  
War, increafcd populations and confumption,  
and aided by other refources, referred for that  
crifis, it may meet within the year all the ex­  
perfes of the year, without encroaching on the  
rights of future generations, by burthening  
  
• them with the debts of the pall. V7ar will  
then be but a fufpenfkm of uleful works, and  
a return to the prog rtfs of improvement.  
I have faid, fellow-citizens, that the income  
referved, had enabled us to extend our limits y­  
but that extent&#x27;on may poflibiy pay for irfelf be­  
fore we are cal ed upon, and in the mean time, i  
may keep down the accruing interefl. In ail  
events, it will replace the advance, we fhall  
have made. I know that the acquifition of  
Lou ifiana had been d lap proved of by fonae,  
from a candid apprehenfion that rhe enlargement  
of our teiritory may endanger its union. B&gt;ut !  
who can limit the extent to which the federative  
principles may operate effeflively ? The larger  
our affectation, the lei’s will it be fhaken by  
local pafHons. And in any view, is it not bet­  
ter that the oppofire bank of the MifiUippi  
ihould tc fettled by our own brethren and  
children, than by flrangcrs of another family ?  
With which (hall we be mofc likely to live in  
harmony and friendly intercourie ?  
In matters of religion I have confidered that  
its free exercife is placed bv the conflitution,  
independent of the powers of the general gov­  
ernment. I have therefore undertaken, on no  
cccafion, to preferibe the religious exercifes  
fuited to it, but have left them as the conttitu­  
tion found them, under the dire&amp;ion and dis­  
cipline of the (late or church authorities ac­  
knowledged by the feveral religious l’ocietics.  
The aboriginal inhabi.ants of thefe countries,  
r have regarded with the commiileration thc r  
hillory iofpires. Endowed with the faculties  
and the rights of men, bearing an ardenr love  
of liberty and independence, and occupying a  
Country which left them no drfirc but to be  
ttndilturbed, the ftream of overflowing popula­  
tion from other regions dire&amp;ed itfelf on thele  
Chores. Without power to divert, or habits to  
contend againfl it, they have been overwhelmed  
by ,thc current, or driven before it. Now re­  
duced within limits too narrow for the hunter j  
date, humanity enjoins U9 to te«ch them agri- j  
culture and the domcllic arts j to encourage  
  
i a  
&lt; r  
\
them fa thif indofcry which alone eafl enable  
them to m»mr»in their place *n ciiftencc, and  
to prepare them in time for that State of fbei­  
ety, which, to bodily ceinfor 5, adds the im- i  
provemen* of the mind and frond*. W e have  
therefore liberally fnrnifhed them with the  
implements of husbandry and houfchold ufe :  
we have placed among them ta-ftrullbrs in tlie  
arts of firlt ntceflSrty ; and they aie covered  
with the Jtg s of the law ag-infl aggreiTors from  
among ourjelves.  
13ut the endeavours to enlighten them on the  
fate which awaits their prefent courfe of life,  
to induce them to exercile their reafon, follow  
its dilates, and change their pmfuits with the  
change of circumitances, Save powerful obfta­  
cles to encounter. 1’ney art combated by the  
h;d&gt;its of their bodies, prejudices of their minds,  
ignorance, pride, and the influence of intereffed  
and crafty individuals among rricm, who feel  
thcmfelves fomething in the prefent order of  
thing*, and fear to become nothing in any other.  
&#x27;1 hefe perfrns inculcate a fanciimoniotis rever­  
ence for the cuftoms of their ancestors •, th*t  
whatfoever they did muff be done through all  
time; that reafon is a falfe guide, and to  
advance under its counfel in their phyfkal,  
moral, or political condition, is perilous in­  
no\ atioR : that their du y i* to remain as their  
Creator made them, ignorance being fafety,  
and knowlege full of danger. In fhor#, my  
friends, among them alfo is feen the a&amp;ion  
and co&#x27;Jnfer-adtion of good fenfe and of big­  
otry. f hey too have their anfi—philofophifts,  
who find an interelt in keeping things in their  
p’-efent ffate; who dread reformation, and  
exert ail their faculties to maintain the af­  
: tendency of habit over the duty of improving  
our reafon and obeying its mandates.  
In giving theft outlines, I do not mean, fel­  
low-citizens, to arrogate to myfrlf the merit of  
the meafures. That is due, in the frrft place, tc  
the refle&amp;ing character of our citizens at  
large, who, by the weight of pnbiic opinion, in- 1  
  
tiuence anu itrengthen the public meaiures.—  
It is due to the found difcertion with whih they  
uleCt, from among themfelves thefe to whom  
they confide the legifhtive duties. It is due  
to the zea! and wifdom of the characters thus  
feleCted. who fay the foundations of public nap­  
pinefs in wholefome laws, the execution of  
which alone remains for others : and it is due  
to the able and faithful auxiliaries^ whofe pat­  
r.otifm has affbeiated them with me in the ex­  
ecutive functions.  
During this co-irfe of adminiftration,and in cr­  
derto difturb it,the artillery of the prels has been  
^veiled againfl us, charged with whatfoever its  
licentioufnefs could devife or dare. Thefe a­  
bufes of an inft&#x27;itution fo important to freedom J  
and lcience, are deeply to be regretted, inafmuch  
as they tend to kflen its ufefulnefs, and to fap its  
fafety. rI hey might perhaps have been correCI­  
ed by the wholefome punifhments referred to,  
and provided by, the laws of the fcveral ftates  
ag.inff falfehood and defamation. But public  
duties more urgent prefs on the time of public  
fervants. and the offenders have therefore been  
left to find their punifhment in the public indig­  
nation.  
Nor wa3 it uninterefting to the world that  
an experiment fhould be fairly and fully made,:  
i whether freedom pf di/cufTion, unaidied by pow- ,  
I er, is not lufftcient for the popagition and pro­  
tection of truth ? whether a government, con­  
ducting itfelf in the true fprrit of its conftitu­  
tion, with zeal and purity, and doing no act  
which it would be unwilling the whole world  
fhould wltnefs, can be written down by falfe­  
hood and defamation*—The experiment has  
been tried.—You have witnefied the feene.—  
Our fellow citizens have looked on cool and  
co’IeCted.— They faw the latent fource from  
which thefe outrages proceeded.—They gath­  
ered around their public functionaries : and  
when the constitution called them to the decis­  
ion by fufrage, they pronounced their verdiCfc,  
honorable to thefe who had ferved them, and  
confolatory to the friend ©f man, who beiieves  
he may be entrulkd with the control of his own  
  
affairs.  
No inference is here intended that the laws*  
provided by the dates againit falfe and defam­  
atory publications fhouid not be enforced—He  
who has time, renders fervice to public morals  
and public tranquility, in &#x27;reforming tbei&#x27;e  
abufes by the falutary coertions of tke  
law.— But the experiment is noted to prove that,  
fince truth and reafoit have maintained thrir  
ground agxinft falfe opinions in league with falfe  
farils, the prefs, confined to truth, needs no o­  
ther legal retlraint. 1 he public judgment will  
correfl falfe reafoning9 and opinions, on a full  
hearing of all parties, and no other definite line  
can be drawn between the ineftimable liberty  
of the prefs, an:lits demoraliiing liceotioufefi.  
If there be dill improprieties which this rule  
would not idlrain, its fupplement muil be  
fought in the cenforfnip of public opinion.  
Contempla tg the union of fentiment now  
m.inifefteJ fo generally, as auguring harmony  
and happines to our future courfc I offer to our  
country fincere congratulations. With thofe  
too not yet rallied to the fame point, the dif­  
pofirion to do fo is gaining drength. Farits  
are piercing through the veil drawn over them \ j  
and our doubting brethren will at length tee  
that the mafs of their fellow-citizens, with  
whom they cannot yet ref dvr to act, as to prin­  
ciples and mcafures, think ai they think, ami  
defire what they defire. Tha our wifh, as well  
as therrs, is that the public efforts may be di­  
reriled honeftly to the public good, that peace  
be cultivated, civil and religious liberty cnaffail­  
ed, law and order preferved, equality of rights  
maintained, and that (late of property equal or  
unequal, which refults to every mao fr&lt;wa his  
  
mm mduftry or that iff hb fathert. v\ r.en .at- J  
|bfied ot thdc views, it b not in human nature  
(thatthey (horrid nor approve and fupport tnem.  
In trie mran time let us chcrilh them with pa

&#x27; more than intee, in ait competition of mterdl s  
and we nted not doubt that truth, ft a tun, and

&#x27;gather them into the fold of out country, and  
will complcat that entire union of opinion  
which gives to a nation the blcffingi of harmo­  
ny, and the benefit ol all its tlrength.  
1 (hall now enter on the duties to which  
my feWow*citizens have again called me ; anu ^  
Ihlil proceed in the ♦pint of tiioic principle!

Washington, March 4.— This day, at  
twelve o&#x27;clock, Thomas Jefferson, President  
of the United States, took the oath of  
office; and delivered the following in-  
augural Speech, in the Senate Chambr,  
in the presence of the. Members of the  
two&quot; Houses, and a large concourse of  
citizens.  
Proceeding, fellow citizens, to that qualie  
fication which the constitution requires, be-  
fore my entrance on the charge again con-  
ferred on me, jt is my duty to express the  
deep sense I entertain of this new proof of  
confidence from my fellow-citizens at large,  
and the zeal with which it inspires me so to  
conduct myself as may best satisfy their just  
expectations. On taking this station on  
a former occasion, I declared the principles  
on which | believed it my duty toadminister  
the affairs of our commonwealth. My con-  
‘science telis me that I have on every occa-  
‘sion acted up to that declaration according  
to its obvious import, and according to the  
understanding of every candid mind.——In  
the transaction of your foreign affairs, we  
have endeavoured to cultivate the’friendship  
of all nations, and especially of those with  
which we have the most important rels-  
tions. We have done them justice on S

moral duti¢s. And history bears witness to  
the fact, that a just nation is trusted on its  
word, when recourse is had to armaments  
and wars to bridle others. At home, fel-  
jowe-citizens, you best know whether we  
have done well or ill. The suppression of  
unnecessary offices, of useless establish-  
ments and expenses, enable us to discon-  
tinue our internal taxes. These, covering  
our land with officers, and opening our doors  
to theirintrusions, had already begun that  
process of domiciliary vexation, which,  
once entertained, is scarcely to be restrained  
from reaching successively every article of  
produce and of property, If among these  
taxes sume minor ones fell, which had not  
been inconvenient, it was because their  
amount would not have paid the officers  
who collected them, and because if they  
had any merit, the state athorities might  
adopt them instead of others, less approved,  
——The remaining revenue on the consump-  
tion of foreign articles, is paid chiefly by  
those who can afford to add foreign Juxuries  
to domestic comforts. Being collected on  
our sea-board and frontiers only, and incor-  
porated with the transactions of our mer-  
catile citizens, it may be the pleasure and  
the pride. of an American to ask, what far-  
mer, what mechanic, what labourer, ever  
secs a tax-gatherer of the United States /  
‘These contributions enable us to support the  
current expenses of the government, to ful-  
fil contraets with foreign nations, to ¢x-  
tinguish the native right of soil within our  
limits, to extend those limits, and to apply  
such a surplus to our public debts, as places  
at ashort day their final redemption, and  
that redemption once effected, the revenue  
thereby liberated, may by a just reparation  
among the states, and a_ correspouding  
amendment of the constitution, be applied,  
in time of peace, to rivers, canals, roads,  
aris, manufactures, education, and other great  
objects within each state. In time of war, if  
injustice by ourselves or others must some-  
limes produce war, increased as the same  
revenue will be by increased population and  
Consumption, and aided by other resources  
reserved for that crisis, it may meet within  
the year all the expenses of the year, with-  
out encroaching on the rights of future ge-  
Derations, by burthening them with the  
debts of the past. War. willthen be but a  
*uspension of useful works, and a return to  
a State of. peace, .a return to the progress of  
&#x27;mprovement.—---I bave said, flow &lt;iti-  
zens, that the income reserved had enabled  
Us to extend our limits; but that extension  
  
ar possibly pay for itself before we are  
  
down the accruing interest. In all events  
it will replace the edvances we shall have  
made. 1 know that the scquisition, of  
Lovisiana has been disapproved, by seme,  
from a candid apprehension that the enlarge-  
ment of our territory may. endanger. | ite  
union; but who can limit . the: extent..te  
which the federative principle, may operate  
effectively ?— The larger our association,  
the less will it be shaken by. Jocal passigns,  
and in any view is it not better that the op-  
posite bank of .the Mississippi shouldbe  
settled by our own brethren and children,  
than by strangers of another family 7—With  
which shall we be most likely to live in hare  
mony and friendly intercourse ?——In mat-  
ters of religion 1 have considered that its  
free exercise is placed by the constitution,  
independent of the powers of the general  
government. I have therefore undertaken,  
on no occasion, to prescribe the religious  
exercises suited to it; but have left them  
as the constitution found them, under the  
direction or discipline of the state or church  
authorities acknowledged by the. several re-  
ligious societies, The aboriginal inhabi-  
tants of these countries I have regarded  
with the commiseration their history in-  
spires. Endowed with the faculties and the  
| rights of men, breathing an ardent Jove of  
liberty and independence, aud occupying a  
country which left them no desire but.to  
be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing  
population from other regians directed itself  
| on these shores. Without power to divert,  
or habits to contend against it, théy have  
been overwhelmed by the current, or driven  
before it. Now reduced within limits too  
-narrow for the hunter state, humanity en-  
joins us toteach them agriculivre and the  
domestic arts; 10 encourage them to that  
industry which alone can enable them to  
maintain, their place jn, existence, and to  
prepare them in time for that state of so-  
ciety, which, to bodily comforts, adds. the  
improvement of the mind and morals. , We  
have therefore liberally furnished them with  
the implements of husbandry and. household  
use: we have placed among them instructors  
in the arts of first mecessity ; and they, are  
covered with the @gis of the Jaw, against  
aggressors from among .ourselves.—--~ But

individuals among them, who ‘féel them-  
selves something in the present order of  
things, and fear to become nothing in any  
other. These persons inculcate a sancti-  
monious reverence for the custoins of their  
ancestors ; that whatever they did must be  
done through all time; that reason is a false  
guide, and to advance under its counsel in  
their physieal, moral, or political condition,  
is perilous innovation : that their duiy is to  
remain’ as their Creator made them, igno-  
tance being safety, and knowledge full of  
danger. In short, my friends, among them  
also is seen the action aud counter-action of  
good sense ahd of bigotry. They too have  
their anti philosophists, who find an interest  
m keeping things in their present state ;  
who dread reforination, and exert all their  
faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit  
ever the duty of improving our reason and  
obeying its mandates.——In giving these  
outlines, I do not mean, to atrogate to my-  
self the merit of measures. That is due, in  
the first place, to the reflecting character of  
our citizens at large, who, by the weight of  
public opinion, influence -and strengthen  
the public measures: It is due to the sound  
discretion with which they select from among  
themselves those to whom they confide the  
Jegislative duties. It is due to the zeal and  
  
wisdom of the characters thus selected, who |  
  
lay the foundation of public happioess in  
wholesome laws, thé execution of which  
alone remains for others; and it is due to  
the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose pa-  
triotisim has associated them with me in the  
  
executive functions. —— During this course |  
  
of administration, and in order to disturb  
it, the artillery of the press has been level-  
led against us, chayged with whatever its  
licentionsnéss could devise or dare. These  
abuses of an institution so important to free-  
dom and science, are deeply to be regretted,  
inasmuch as they tend to léssen its useful-  
hess, and to sap its safety. They might,  
perhaps, have been corrected by the whole-  
some punishments reserved to, and provided  
by, the laws of the several states, against  
falsehood and defamation. But public du-  
tiés more urgent, press on the time of pub-  
fic servants, and the offenders: have there-  
fore been left to find their puiishment in the  
public indignation.—-—Now was it unin-  
teresting to the world thai an experiment  
should be fairly and fally made; whether  
freédom of discussion, unaided by power,  
i$ hot sufficient for the propagation and pro-  
tection of truth ?—Whether a government,  
eonducting itself in the true spirit of its con-  
stitutioy; with geal and purity, and doing  
wo act which it’ would be‘ unwilling: the

whole world should witnesé, can’ be Written  
down by falsehood and defamatiou ? The  
experiment has been tried. You have wir.  
nessed the scene. -Our fellow citizens have  
looked on cool and collected, They saw  
the latent source from which these outrages  
proceeded. They gathered around their  
public functionaries; and when the consti«  
tution called them: to the decision by suf-  
frage, they ‘pronounced their verdict, ho-  
nourable to those who had served them,  
antl consolatory to the friend of man, who  
believes he may be entrusted with the con-  
troul of his own afiairs.—— No inference ig  
here intended that the laws provided by the  
states against talse and defamatory publica-  
tions should not be inforced. He who hag  
time renders a service to the public morals  
and public tranquillity, in reforming these  
abuses by the salutary coercions of the law,  
But the experiment is noted to prove that,  
since truth and reason have maintained their  
ground against false opinions in league with  
false facts, the press confined to truth, needs  
no other legal restraint. The public judge-  
ment ‘will correct false reasonings and opi-  
nions, on a full hearing of all parties, and  
no other definite line can be drawn between  
the inestimable liberty of the press, and its  
demoralizing licentiousness. If there be  
still improprieties which this rule would not  
restrain, its supplemént miust be sought  
in the censorship of public opinion.——  
Contemplating the union of sentiment now  
manifested so generally, as arguing harmony  
and happiness to eur future course, | offer  
to our country sincere congratulations. With  
those too not yet rallied to the same point,  
the disposition to do so is. gaining strength.  
Facts are piercing through the veil drawn  
over them; and our doubting brethren will  
at length see that the mass of their fellow-  
citizens, with whom they cannot yet resolve  
to act, as to principles and measures think  
as they think, and desire’ what they desire.  
That oar wish as well as theirs, is that the  
public efforts may be directed honestly to  
the public good, that peace ‘be cultivated,  
civil and religious liberty unassailed, Jaw  
and order preserved, equality of rights  
maintained, and -that state of property,  
equal or unequal, which’ results to every  
man‘ trom his own indastry or that of his  
fathers. When satisfied of these views, !  
is not in human nature that they should not  
apptove and’ suppert them. In the mean-  
time let us cherish them with’ patient affec-  
tion. Let us do them justice, and’ more  
  
than justice, in all competitions of interest 5

limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate

hasten to retrace our steps, and to re  
gain the road which alone leads to  
peace, liberty and safety.&quot;  
SEcoNd InAUGURAL, MArch 4, 1805.  
&quot;At home, fellow-citizens, you best  
know whether we have done well or  
The suppression of unnecessary  
offices, of useless establishments and  
expenses, enable us to discontinze our  
nternal taxes. These, covering our  
and with officers, and opening our  
loors to their intrusions, had alieady  
begun that process of domiciliary vex  
ation which once entered is scarcely to  
be restrained from reaching successie­  
ly every article of property and ro  
duce. If, among these taxes, some  
minor ones fell which had not been  
nconvenient, it was because their  
amount would not have paid the offf  
cers who collected them, and because  
fthey had any merit, the State author  
ties might adopt them instead of  
others less approved.  
The remaining revenue, on the con  
sumption of foreign articles, is paid  
chiefly by those who can afford to add  
foreign luxuries to domestic comlorts.  
Being collected on our seaboard and  
rontiers only, and incorporated with  
  
the transactions of our mercantile citan a a o o o a i aa­  
izens, it may be the pleasure and the ment, and, expressing surprise at the  
pride of an American to ask what visit, asks Master Charles if he wishes  
larmer, what mechanic, what laborer that she should provide breakfast. The  
  
ever sees a tax-gatherer of the United master gives the nod, and then re­  
States? The contributions enable us quests his guests to step round the  
  
to support the current expenses of the  
fovernment; to fulfill contracts with  
foreign nations; to extinguish the  
native right of soil within our limits;  
to extend those limits and to apply  
such a surplus to our public debts as  
laces at a short day their final re  
demption, and, that redemption once  
flected, the revenue thereby liberated  
may, by a just repartition of it among  
the States, and a corresponding amend  
ment of the Constitution, be applied,  
time of peace, to rivers, canals,  
roads, arts, manufactures, education,  
and other great objects within each  
State. In time of war, if injustice by  
ourselves or others must sometimes  
produce war, increased population and  
consumption, and aided by other re­  
sources reserved for that crisis, it may  
meet within the year all the expenses  
of the year without encroaching on the  
rights of future generations by burden.  
ng them with the debts of the past  
War will then be but a suspension of  
useful works; and a return to a state  
of peace, a return to the progress of  
mprovement.  
&quot;I have said, lellowcitizens, that the  
income reserved had enabled us to ex  
tend our limits; but that extension may  
possibly pay for itself before we are  
called on, and, in the meantime, may  
keep down the accruing interest; in all  
events it will replace the advances we  
shall have made. I know that the ac  
quisition of Louisiana has been disap  
proved by some from a canund appre­  
hension that the enlargement of our  
territory would endanger the Union.  
Bul who can timit the cartent to which the  
federative principle may operate elfective  
u? The larger our association, the  
less will it be shaken by local passions;  
and, in any view, is it not better that the  
opposite bank of the Mississippt should be  
seltled by our own brethren and children  
than by strangers of another Jumily?  
With which should we be most likely  
to live in harmony and friendly inter  
course?  
In matters of religion, I have con  
sidered that its free exercise is placed  
by the Constitution independent of the  
powers of the General Government. I  
have, therefore, undertaken on no oc  
casion to describe the religious exer  
cise suited to it, but have leit them, as  
the Constitution found them, under  
the direction and discipline of the  
church or State authorities acknowl  
edged by the several religious socie­  
ties.

time. We commend them to those faithful of our Democratic brethren  
who worship at the shrine of Monticello. After commending the revenue  
from duties on imports, he says:  
  
“These contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the Gov-

soil within our limits, to extend these limits, and to apply such a surplus to our

Jefferson on Taxes.  
From his Second Inaugural Address, 1805  
At home, fellow-citizens, you best know  
whether we have done well or ill. The sup­  
pression of unnecessary offices, of useless  
establishments and expenses, enabled us  
to discontinue our internal taxes. These,  
covering our land with officers and opening  
our doors to intrusions, had already begun  
that process of domicialiary vexation which,  
once entered, is scarcely to be restrained  
from reaching, successively, every article ol  
property and produce. If among these tax­  
es, some minor ones tail, which had not been  
convenient, it was because their amount  
would not have paid the officers who col­  
lected them, and because, if they had anj  
merit, the State authorities might adopt  
them instead of others less approved.  
The remaining revenue on the consump­  
tion of foreign articles, is paid chiefly hy  
those who can afford to add foreign luxu­  
ries to domestic comforts. Being collected  
on our seaboard and frontiers only, and  
incorporated with the transactions of out  
mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure  
and pride of an American to ask—Whal  
farmer, what mechanic, what laborer, evei  
sees a tax-gatherer of the United States ?—  
These contributions enable us to snppori  
the current expenses of the Government:  
to fulfil contracts with foreign nations; tc  
extinguish the native right of soil within  
our limits; to extend those limits; and tc  
apply such a surplus to our public debts  
as places at a short day their final redemp­

tury has proven to be correct : &quot;But the  
endeavors to enlighten them on the fate  
which awaits their present course of life,  
to induce them to exercise their reason,  
follow its dictates and change their pur­  
suits with the change of circumstances,  
have powerful obstacles to encounter; they  
are combatted by the habits of their bodies,  
prejudice of their minds, ignorance, pride  
and the influence of interested and crafty  
individuals among them, who feel them­  
selves something in the present order of  
things, and fear to become nothing in any  
other. These persons inculcate a sancti­  
monious reverence for the customs of their  
ancestors, that, whatsoever they did, must  
be done through all time, that reason is a  
false guide, and to advance under its coun­  
sel In their physical, moral or political con­  
dition, is perilous innovation ; that their  
duty is to remain as their Creator made  
them, ignorance being safety, and knowl­  
edge full of danger; in short, my friends,  
among them is seen the action and counter  
action of good sense and bigotry; they,  
too, have their anti-philosophers, who find  
an interest in keeping things in their pres­

At home, fellow citizens, you best know  
whether we have done well or ill. The  
suppression of unnecessary offices, of use­  
less establishments and expenses, enabled us

already begun that process of domiciliary  
vexation, which, once entered, is scarcely to be  
restrained from reaching, successively, every  
article of property and produce. If, among  
these taxes, some minor ones fell, which had not  
been inconvenient, it was because their amount  
would not have paid the officers who collected  
them, and because, if they had any merit, the  
State authorities might adopt them instead of  
others less approved

of foreign articles, is paid chiefly by those who  
can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic

frontiers only, and incorporated with the  
transactions of our mercantile citizens, it  
may be the pleasure and the pride of  
an American to ask, what farmer, what  
mechanic, what laborer ever sees a tax  
gatherer of the United States? These con­  
tributions enable us to support the expenses of  
the Government; to fill contracts with foreign

follows:  
&quot;During the course of administration, and  
In order to disturb it. the artillery of the  
press has been leveled against us, charged  
with whatsoever Its licentiousness could  
devise or dare. These abuses of an insti­  
tution so important to freedom and science  
are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as  
they tend to lessen Its usefulness and to  
sap Its safety. They might, indeed, have  
been corrected by tne wholesome punish­  
ments reserved to and provided by the laws  
of the several states against falsehood and  
defamation, but public outics more urgent  
press on public servants, and the offenders  
have, therefore, been left to find their  
punishment in the public indignation.  
&quot;Nor was it uninteresting to the world  
that an experiment should be fairly and  
fulij made, whether tho freedom of dis­  
cussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient  
for the prorogation and protection of truth  
whether a govo-rraent conducting Itself  
In the true spirit of Its constitution, with  
zeal and punt, and doing no act which it  
would be unwilling the whole world should  
w&#x27;tnesv. can be written down by falsehood  
and defamation. The experiment lias, been  
tried, ou have witnessed tli scene; our  
fellow citizens looked on, cool and collect­  
ed, they saw the latent source from which  
these outrages proceeded; they gathered  
around their public functionaries, and  
when tho conoUtutlon called them to the  
decision b Miffrage. they prorounccd their  
lerdict, honorable to those vho had served  
them and consolatory to the friends of  
mar who believe th-it he may be trueted  
with the control of his own affairs  
&quot;No inference is hero Intended that the  
laws provided by the states- against false  
ami defamatory publications should not  
be enforced, ho wno has time renders a  
service to public morals and publio tran­  
cuillity in- reforming these abuses by the  
sa&#x27;utarj&quot; coercions of the Iiw. but the ex­  
periment is noted to prove that, s.nco truth  
anil reason have mair.tai led their ground  
against fale opinions in league with false  
fait-, the pros-, confined to truth, ne.&#x27;ds  
no other Ic;al restraint, the puhtic Judg­  
ment will correct f-iKe reasonings and  
opinions on .i full hearing of all pirtics,  
and no other definite line can be drawn  
between the inestimable llbert of the  
press and its demoralizing licentiousness.  
If there he still Improprieties which this  
rule would not restrain, its supplement  
must be sought in the censorship of public  
opinion.

OUTRAGES OF THE PRESS.  
&quot;&quot;Stockton Independent: During the

artillery of the Democratic press has

inet, charged with whatsoever its li­

These abuses of an institution so im­  
portant to freedom and science are  
d-eeply to be regretted, inasmuch as  
they tend to lessen its usefulness and  
sap its safety. They might, indeed,  
have been corrected by the wholesome  
punishments reserved to and provided

public duties more urgent press on the  
time of public servants and the offend­  
ers have therefore been left to find  
their punishment in the public indigna­  
tion. The press., confined to truth,  
needs no other legal restraint; the  
public judgment will correct false rea­  
sonings and opinions on a full hearing  
of all parties, and no other definite  
line can be drawn between the ines­  
timable liberty of the press and its de­  
moralizing licentiousness. If ther? be
