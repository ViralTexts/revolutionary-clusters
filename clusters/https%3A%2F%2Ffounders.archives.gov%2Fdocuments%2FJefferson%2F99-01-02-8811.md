7 Oct. 1808]  
  
  
  
Your representation and request were received on the 7th. inst: and have been considered with the attention due to every expression of the sentiments and feelings of so respectable a body of my fellow-citizens. No person has seen with more concern than myself, the inconveniences brought on our country in general, by the circumstances of the times in which we happen to live; times to which the history of nations presents no parallel. For years we have been looking as spectators on our brethren of Europe, afflicted by all those evils which necessarily follow an abandonment of the moral rules which bind men and nations together. Connected with them in friendship and commerce, we have happily so far kept aloof from their calamitous conflicts, by a steady observance of justice towards all, by much forbearance, and multiplied sacrifices. At length however, all regard to the rights of others having been thrown aside, the belligerent powers have beset the high way of commercial intercourse with edicts which, taken together, expose our commerce and mariners, under almost every destination, a prey to their fleets and armies. Each party indeed would admit our commerce with themselves, with the view of associating us in their war against the other; but we have wished war with neither. Under these circumstances were passed the laws of which you complain, by those delegated to exercise the powers of legislation for you, with every sympathy of a common interest in exercising them faithfully. In reviewing these measures therefore, we should advert to the difficulties out of which a choice was of necessity to be made. To have submitted our rightful commerce to prohibitions and tributary exactions from others, would have been to surrender our independence. To resist them by arms was war, without consulting the state of things or the choice of the nation. The alternative preferred by the legislature of suspending a commerce placed under such unexampled difficulties, besides saving to our citizens their property, and our mariners to their country, has the peculiar advantage of giving time to the belligerent nations to revise a conduct as contrary to their interests as it is to our rights.  
“In the event of such peace or suspension of hostilities between the belligerent powers of Europe, or of such change in their measures affecting neutral commerce as may render that of the United States sufficiently safe in the judgment of the President,” he is authorised to suspend the embargo. But no peace or suspension of hostilities, no change of measures affecting neutral commerce, is known to have taken place. The Orders of England, and the Decrees of France and Spain, existing at the date of these laws, are still unrepealed, as far as we know. In Spain indeed a contest for the government appears to have arisen; but of its course or prospects we have no information on which prudence would undertake a hasty change in our policy, even were the authority of the Executive competent to such a decision.  
You desire that, in this defect of power, Congress may be specially convened. It is unnecessary to examine the evidence or the character of the facts which are supposed to dictate such a call: be

August 26 1808,  
  
Your representation and request were received  
on the 22dinstant, and have been considered with  
the atiention due to every expression of the sen-  
timents and feelings of so respectable a body of  
my fcllow-citizens.  
  
No person bas seen with more concern than  
myself the inconveniences brought on our coun-  
try in general by the circumstances of the times  
in which we happen to live ; times to which the  
history of nations presents no parallel. For years  
we have been laoking as spectators on our bre-  
thren of Europe, affiicted with all those evils  
which necessarily follow an abandonment of the  
moral fules which bind menand nations together.  
Connected with them in friendship and com-  
merce, we have happily so far kept aloof from  
their calamitous conflicts, by a steady observance  
of justice towards all, by much forbearance, and  
multiplied sacrifices.. At Jength, however, all  
regard to the rights of others having been thrown  
aside, the Belligerent powers have beset the high  
way of commercial intercourse with Edicts, which,  
taken together, expose our commerce and ma-  
rines, under almost eyery destination, a prey to  
their fleets gnd armies. Each party indeed would  
admit our commerce with themselves, with the  
view of associating us in their war against the  
other. But we have wished war with neither,  
Under these circumstances, were passed the laws  
ot which you complain, by those delegated to  
exercise the power of legislation for you, with  
every sympathy of a common interest ‘in exercis-  
ing them faithfully,  
  
  
  
In reviewing these’ measufés, thierefore, we  
should advert to the difficulties out of which a  
choice was of necessity to be made. To haye sub-  
mitted our rightful commerce to prohibitions and  
tributary exactions from others, would haye been  
to surrender our independence. To resist them  
by arms was war, without consulting the state  
of things, or the choice of the nation. The alter-  
native preferred by the legislature, of suspending  
acominerce placed under such unexampled diffi-  
culties, besides saving to our citizens their pro-  
perty, and our mariners tq their country, has the  
peculiar advantage of giving them to the Bellige-  
rent nations to revise a conduct as contrary to their  
interests, as it is to our rights.  
  
In the event of such peace or suspension of hos-  
tilities between the Belligerent powers of Europe,  
or of such change jn their meisures affecting neu-  
tral commerce, as may render that of the United  
States sufficiently sate, in the judgement of the  
president, he is aythorized to suspend the em-  
bargo. But no peace or suspensign of hostilities,  
no change affecting neutral commerce is known  
to have taken place, ‘The orders of England, and
