Mount Vernon 27th Sep. 1795  
  
Your private letter of the 21st instant, did not reach me until yesterday. A late letter of mine to you, will have fixed the Directorship of the Mint upon Mr Boudinot—The application therefore of Majr Jackson, however fit he may have been for the Office, is too late. But besides the reasons assigned in your letter against such an appointment at present, I should have preferred a character from another State, if one equally suitable could have been found; for the reasons you have often heard me mention altho’ they do not apply with the same force now as formerly.  
With respect to Mr Dexter for the Office of Attorney General, altho I have a very good opinion of his abilities, and know nothing in his moral character or connexions that are objectionable—yet the reason which I assigned when his name was first mentioned to me has still weight in my mind; that is, after a long &amp; severely contested an election he could not obtain a majority  
  
of suffrages in the District he formerly represented. In this instance then the sense of his constituents respecting him personally has been fairly taken—and one of the charges ag[ainst] me, relative to the treaty you know is, that I have disregarded the voice of the people, altho’ that voice has never yet been heard unless the misrepresentation of party—or at best partial meetings can be so called.  
I shall not, whilst I have the honor to Administer the government, bring a man into any Office, of consequence knowingly whose political tenets are adverse to the measures which the general government are pursuing; for this, in my opinion, would be a sort of political Suicide that it wd embarrass its movements is most certain. But if two men equally well affected to the true interests of their country, of equal abilities &amp; equally disposed to lend their support, it is the part of prudence to give a preference to him, against whom the least clamour can be excited: for such an one my enquiries have been made and are still making: how far I shall Succeed, is at this moment problematical.  
I have not relinquished my intention of being in Philadelphia about the middle of next month. With great esteem &amp; regard I am

principles involved.  
  
First, as to Washington’s policy. If Washington  
had merely appointed friends of the Constitution, Mr.  
Aiken’s comments would be perfectly just, and I  
should be the first to admit it. But while Washing-  
ton at the outset appointed friends of the Constitution  
exclusively, as was wise and proper, after the develop-  
ment of parties, and after he had been himself the  
subject of party attack, he took the ground that only  
friends of the Government—that is, Federalists —  
ought to be appointed to office. In September, 1795,  
he wrote to Pickering:  
  
I shall not, whilst I have the honor to administer the  
Government, bring a man into any office of consequence  
knowingly whose political tenets are adverse to the meas-  
ures which the General Government are pursuing; for this,  
in my opinion, is a sort of political suicide. That it would  
embarrass its movements is certain.

Mr. VERNON, 27th September, 1795.  
DeAR Sirr Your private letter of the 21st inst. did  
not reach me until yesterday. A late letter of mine  
to you will have fixed the Directorship of the Mint  
upon Mr. Boudinot. The application, therefore, of  
Major Jackson, however fit he may be for the office,  
is too late. But besides the reasons assigned in your  
letter against such an appointment at present I  
should have preferred a character from another State,  
if one equally suftable could have been found, for the  
reasons you have often heard me mention, although  
they do not apply with the same force as formerly.  
With respect to Mr. D, for the office of Attorney-  
General, although I have a very good opinion of his  
abilities and know nothing in his moral character or  
connections that is objectionable, yet the reason I as­  
signed when his name was first mentioned to me has  
still weight in my mind; that is, after a long and  
severely contested election he could not obtain a ma­  
jority of suffrages in the district he formerly repre­  
sented. In this instance, then, the sense of his con­  
stituents respecting him personally has been fairly  
taken; and one of the charges against me relative to  
the treaty, you know, is that I have disregarded the  
voice of the people, although that voice has never yet  
been heard, unless the misrepresentations of party,  
or at best partial meetings, can be called so.  
I shall not, while I have the honor to administer the  
Government, bring a man into any office of conse­  
quence knowingly whose political tenets are adverse  
to the measures which the General Government are  
pursuing; for this, in my opinion, would be a sort of  
political suicide. That it would embarrass its move­  
ments is most certain. But of two men equally well  
affected to the true interests of their country, of  
equal abilities, and equally disposed to lend their  
support, it is the part of prudence to give the prefer.­  
ence to him against whom the least clamor can be  
excited. For such a one my inquiries have been  
made and are still making. How far I shall succeed  
is at this moment problematical.  
I have not relinquished my intention of being in  
Philadelphia about the middle of next month. With  
great esteem and regard, I am, &amp;c.

ATTACKS ON THE CIVIL SERVICE.  
OUne of the most interesting {eatures  
of the session will be the attack on the  
civil service law. It will be led by Mr  
Gallinger of New Hampshire in the son­  
ate and Mr. Grosvenor of Ohlo in the  
housge. Mr. Gallinger has been layving  
the foundation for it in a publigshed  
controversy with Carl Schurz, one of  
the earily friends of civil service re­  
form. General Grosvenor has already  
demonstrated his position in a speech  
made to the housge on the 18th of July,  
in which he quoted George Washington  
ays saying in a letter to Timothy Pick­  
ering, &quot;l shali not while I have the
