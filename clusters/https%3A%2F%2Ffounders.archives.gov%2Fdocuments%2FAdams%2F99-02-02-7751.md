h of England—with Farmer—Price—Priestly. Rippen Rees Lindsay—Dirney &amp; Jebb—with the English and Scottish Clergy—in Holland and especially with Doctr McClean at the Hague, I have conversed freely with most of the sects in America and have not been wholly inattentive to the writings and reasonings of all these denominations of Philosophers and Christians. You may well suppose then that I have had Controversy enough, but after all I declare to you that your 29 Sermons have expressed the result of all my reading experience and reflection, in a manner more satisfactory to me than I could have done in the best days of my strength—The most afflictive circumstances that I have witnessed in the lot of humanity are the narrow views the unsocial humours the fastidious scorn and repulsive temper of all denominations except one—I cannot conclude this letter without adding an anecdote—

‘Quincy, Jan. 21, 1823.  
‘SDeEAR Sir,  
  
‘¢T thank you for your kind letter of the 50th De-  
cember, and above all for the gift of a precious  
volume.—lIt is a chain of diamonds set in links of gold.  
{ have never read or heard a volume of sermons better  
calculated or adapted to the age and country in which  
it was written. How different from the sermons I  
heard and read in the town of Worcester, from the year  
1755 to 1758. As my destiny in life has been some-  
what uncommon, I must beg pardon for indulging in a  
  
little egotism.—I may say [ was born and bred in the  
centre of theological and ecclesiastical controversy.  
A sermon of Mr. Bryant, minister of the parish, who  
lived on the spot now a part of the farm on which I  
live, occasioned the controversy between him and Mr.  
Miles, Mr. Porter, Mr. Bass, and many others; it  
broke out like the eruption of a volcano, and blazed

EXTRACT  
From a Letter from President Adams, to the Rev.  
Dr. Bancroft, of Worcester.  
  
“ The most afflictive circumstances that I have  
witnessed in the lot of humanity, are the narrow  
views, the unsocial humours, the fastidious scorn,  
and repulsive temper of all denominations except  
one.  
  
“ I cannot conclude this letter without adding an  
anecdote. One of the zealous mendicants for the  
contributions to the funds of Missionary socicties,  
called on a gentleman in Haverhill and requested his  
charity. The gentleman declined subscribing, but  
added, that there are in and about the town of  
nine Clergymen, ministers of nine Congregations,  
not one of whom lives on terms of civility with any  
other, will admit none other into his pulpit, nor be  
permitted to go into the pulpit of any other. Now  
if you will raise a fund to convert these nine Clergy-  
men to Christianity, I will contribute as much as

and used to often repeat a story,  
concerning a gentleman who replied

nor be permitted to go into the pulpit of any  
other. Now, if you will raise a fund to con­  
vert these nine clergymen to Christianity I will  
contribute as much as any man.&quot;
