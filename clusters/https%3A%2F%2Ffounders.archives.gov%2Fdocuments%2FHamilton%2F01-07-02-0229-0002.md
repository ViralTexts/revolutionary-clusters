That from a conviction (as suggested in his Report No. I herewith presented) That a National Bank is an Institution essential to of primary importance to the prosperous administration of the Finances, and would be of the greatest utility in the operations connected with the support of public Credit—his attention has been accordingly occupied drawn to in devising the plan of such an institution, upon a scale, which will intitle it to the public Confidence, and which will be likely to render it equal to the exigencies of the Public.  
Previous to entering upon the detail of this plan, he entreats the Indulgence of the House, towards some preliminary reflections, naturally arising out of the subject, which he hopes will be deemed neither useless nor out of place. Public Opinion being the ultimate Arbiter of every measure of Government, it can scar[c]ely appear improper, in reference deference to that, it to accompany the origination of any new proposition with explanations many of which the superior information of those to whom it is immediately addressed, would render superfluous.

It is a fact well understood, that Public Banks have found admission and patronage, among most the principal &amp; most enlightened commercial Nations. They have successively obtained in Italy, Holland, England and France as well as in the United States. And it is a circumstance, which cannot but have considerable weight, in a candid estimate of their tendency, that after an experience of centuries, there exists not even a question about their utility, in the countries in which they have been as long established.

The fact on which this charge rests is not to be admitted without several qualifications; especially particularly in reference to the state of things in this Country.

unes and finally to retrieve their affairs: These Circumstances which form suggest no inconsiderable encomiums on the utility of Banks.  
  
But the last and heaviest charge is still to be examined. This is that Banks tend to banish the gold &amp; silver of the specie of the Country.  
The force of this objection rests upon their being an engine of paper Credit, which by furnishing a substitute for the metals, is supposed to promote their exportation. It is an objection, which if it has any foundation, lies not against Banks peculiarly but against every species of paper Credit. The number and respectability of the patrons of this idea intitle it to particular attention.  
The most common answer given to it is that the thing supposed is of little or no consequence: That it is immaterial what serves the purpose of money whether silver or gold paper or gold and silver: That the effect of both upon industry is the same: And that the intrinsic wealth of a nation is to be measured estimated not by the abundance of the precious metals contained in it but by the quantity of the productions of its labour and industry.  
This answer is not destitute of solidity, though it is not intirely satisfactory. It is certain, that the vivification of industry by a full circulation, with the aid of a proper and well regulated paper Credit, may more than compensate for the loss of a part of the gold and silver of a Nation; if the consequence of avoiding that loss should be a scanty or defective circulation.  
But the positive increase or decrease of the gold and silver precious metals, in of a Country, unless temporarily unless the latter be temporary can hardly be a matter of indifference. As the commodity taken in lieu of every other it is a species of the most effective wealth; and as being as the money of the world, it it is of great concern to the state that there be it possess a sufficiency of it to face any external calls demands which the protection of its external interests may create.  
The objection seems to admit of another and a more conclusive answer, which controverts the fact itself. A nation a that which has no mines of its own must derive the precious metals from others; generally speaking generally speaking in exchange for the products of its labour and industry. The quantity it will possess will therefore in the ordinary course of things be regulated by the favourable or unfavourable ballance of its Trade; that is, by the proportion between its abilities to supply foreigners &amp; products and its wants of them, between the amount of its exportations and that of its importations. The state therefore Hence the state of its improve progressive agriculture and manufactures, the general mass of quantity and quality of its labour and industry must in the main influence and determine in the general course of things the increase or decrease of its gold and silver.  
If this be true, the inference will seems to be that well constituted banks favour the increase of the precious metals. It has been shewn, that they augment in different ways, the active capital of the Country.  
Tis Capital which gives employed This it is, which generates employment; Tis this, which and which animates and expands labour and industry. Any Every addition which is made to it, by putting contributing to put in motion a greater quantity of both must tends to create a greater quantity of the products of both—And by furnishing more materials to exchange supply with foreigners with others for those which are wanted from them for exportation conduces to a favourable ballance of Trade and consequently to the introduction and increase of gold and silver.

however objections to be made to it.  
It may might may be said, that as Bank paper affords a substitute for specie, it serves to counteract that rigorous necessity for the metals as a medium of circulation, which in the case of a wrong ballance, might restrain in some degree their exportation; and it may might may be added that from the same cause in the same case, it would it may retard those œconomical and parsimonious reforms in the manner of living which the scarcity of money is calculated to produce, and which might be necessary to rectify such wrong ballances.

s a deficiency of circulating medium.  
How far this that deficiency is real or imaginary is not susceptible of demonstration, but there are circumstances &amp; appearances which render its reality probable.  
The circumstances are besides the fact just mentioned respecting the paper emissions formerly in use, the vast tracts of waste land, and the little advanced state of manufactures. The progressive settlement of the former, while it promises ample retributionrecompence in the generation of future resources diminishes or obstructs in the mean time the active wealth of the Country. It not only draws off a part of the circulating money, and places it in a more passive state, but it diverts it into its own channels a portion of that species of labour and industry which would otherwise be employed in furnishing materials for foreign trade, and which by contributing to a favourable ballance, would assist the introduction of specie. In the early periods of new settlers settlements, the labour of the settlem settlers not only furnish no surplussses for exportation but they consume a part of that which is produced by the labour of others. The same thing is a cause that manufactures do not advance or advance slowly. And notwithstanding some hypothesis to the contrary there are many things to induce a suspicion that the precious m

The emitting of If these things be true and some aid to circulation is necess. The convenient pay  
If these things be true and some aid to circulation be necessary it remains to inquire what ought to be the nature of that aid.  
The emitting of paper money by the authority of Government is wisely prohibitted to the individual states by the national constitution. And the spirit of that prohibition ought not to be disregarded by the Government of the United States. Though paper emissions under a general authority might have some advantages not applicable, and be free from some disadvantages, which are applicable, to the like emissions by the states separately; yet they are of a nature so liable to abuse, and it may even be affirmed so certain of being abused, that the wisdom of the government will be shewn in never trusting itself with the use of so baseless treacherous seductive and dangerous so seducing and treacherous an expedient. In times of tranquillity it might have no ill con[se]quence; it might even perhaps be managed in a way so regulated as to be productive of good; but in great and trying emergencies, there is almost a moral certainty of its becoming mischievous. The stamping of paper is an operation so much easier than the laying of taxes, that a government, in the practice of paper emissions, would rarely fail in any such emergency to indulge itself too far in the employment of that resour[c]e, to avoid as much as possible one less propitious to present popularity; though incomparably more safe and salutary. in itself. If it should not even be carried so far as to be rendered an absolute bubble it would at least be likely to be extended to a degree which would occasion an inflated and artificial state of things inconsistent incompatible with the regular and prosperous course of the political œconomy.  
Among other material differences been between a paper currency issued by the mere authority of government and one issued by a bank payable in coin is this—That in the first case, there is no standard to which an appeal can be made, as to the quantity, which will only satisfy or which will surcharge the circulation; in the last, that standard results from the demand. If more should be issued than is necessary, it will return upon the bank. Its emissions as elsewhere intimated must always be in a compound ratio to the fund and to the demand. Whence it is evident that there is a limitation in the nature of the thing. While the discretion of the government is the only measure of the extent of the emissions by its own authority.  
This consideration further illustrates the danger of emissions of that sort, and the preference which is due to Bank paper.  
Assuming it then now, as a consequence from what has been said, that a National Bank is a desireable institution two inquiries emerge—Is there no such institution, already in

But though the Ordinance of Congress contains no grant of exclusive privileges, there is room to allege that the Government of the United States ought not in point of candour and equity to establish any rival or interfering institution, in prejudice of the one already established; especially as this has, from services rendered, such well founded claims to protection and favour regard.  
The justice of such an observation ought within proper bounds to be admitted. A new establishment of the sort ought not to be made without cogent and sincere motives reasons of public good. And in the manner of doing it every facility should be given to a consolidation of the old into with the new, one upon terms agreeable to the part beneficial not injurious to the parties interested concerned.. But there is no ground to maintain that in a case in which the government has made no condition restricting its authority that it ought voluntarily to restrict it, in through regard to the interests of a particular institution, when those of the state dictate a different course; especially too after such circumstances have intervened as those which characterise the actual situation of the Bank of North America.  
The inducements to a new another establishment are now to be considered.  
It is now proper to consider examine examine what are the considerations of public good which render a new establishment adviseable.

The want of a principle of Rotation in the constitution of the Bank of North America is another weighty argument for a new different establishment. Scarcely one of the reasons, which militate against this principle in the constitution of a country is applicable to that of a Bank; while while there are strong reasons in favour of it, in relation to the latter one, which do not apply to the former other. The knowlege to be derived from experience is the only circumstance common to both, which pleads against rotation in the directing officers of a Bank.

ion of the Bank of North America are admitted to be well founded, they will nevertheless not derogate from the merit of the main design, or of the services that Bank the institution it has rendered, or of the benefits it has produced.  
The establishment of such an institution at the time it was done proposed was a measure dictated by wisdom. The Its utility has been amply evinced by its fruits. American Independence owes much to it. And it is very conceivable that reasons of the moment may have rendered those features in it inexpedient which on a revision, with a permanent view suggested as are desireable.  
The order of the subject now leads to an inquiry into the principles upon which a National Bank ought to be established. instituted.  
The situation of the U States naturally suggests inspires a wish, that the form of the institution could admit of a plurality of branches. But various considerations discourage from pursuing this idea. The complexity of such a structure plan would be apt to inspire doubts, which would deter from entering into adventuring in it. And the practicability of a safe and orderly administration, though not to be abandonned as desperate, cannot be made so manifest in perspective as to promise the removal of those doubts or to justify the Government in adopting the idea as an original experiment. It The most that would seem adviseable, on this point, is to insert a provision, which may lead to it hereafter; if when if experience may better shall more clearly demonstrate its utility and the practical observations of can satisfy those who may have the direction shall render it in their judgment safe that it may be adopted with safety. It is certain that it would have some advantages both peculiar and important. Besides more general accommodation it would lessen the danger of a run upon the bank.  
The argument against it is that each branch must necessarily be under a distinct, though a subordinate direction; to which a considerable latitude of discretion must of necessity be entrusted. And as the property of the whole institution would be liable for the engagements of each part, that and its credit would be at stake upon the prudence of the Directors of every part. The mismanagement of either branch of the institution might would hazard serious disorders. possibly something more possibly to a ruinous extent ruin perhaps to a serious extent..  
Another wish dictated by the particular situation of the Country is that the Bank could be so constituted as to be made an immediate instrument of loans to the proprietors of land; but this wish also yields to the difficulty of accomplishing it. Various projects have at different times been proposed for the establishment of what has been called a land bank, but none of them are to can be deemed satisfactory.  
Land is alone an unfit unfit fund for a bank circulation. If the notes issued upon it were not to be paper emitted by it be not payable in coin on demand or at a short date, this would it will amount to nothing more than a repitition of the paper emissions which have heretofore obtained, and which are now exploded by the general voice.

If this advance was small the relief aimed at would not be given acquired; obtained; if it was considerable large the quantity of notes issued would be a source cause of distrust diffidence and, if received at all, they would be likely to return speedily upon the Bank for payment; which after exhausting its coin would might be under a necessity of turning its land into money at any price that could be obtained for them, to the irreparable prejudice of the proprietors.  
A further wish, which is suggested by considerations of public advantage, is Considerations of public advantage suggest a further wish, which is that the Bank could be established upon such principles, as that which would cause the profits of it would to redound to the immediate benefit of the State. government; and to as an article of revenue.

The suspicion of this would most probably be a canker that would continually corrode the vitals of the Credit of the Bank and would be most likely to prove fatal most malignant in those situations in which the public good would required that that credit they should should be most sound and vigorous.

 If the paper of a Bank is to be permitted to insinuate itself into all the receipts on public revenues and receipts of a country; if it is even to be tolerated as the substitute for gold and silver in all the transactions of business, it becomes in either view a national concern of the first importance. magnitude. As such the ordinary rules of prudence require that the government should possess the means of ascertaining at all times whenever it thinks fit that so delicate a trust is executed with fidelity and care. An inspection for this purpose of this sort is not only desireable with a view to as it relates to to to the public safety but as it to  as it respects the government; but it ought to be equally so to all those concerned in the Institution, as an additional title to public and private confidence; and as a thing which can only be formadable to practices that shun the light. The presumption must always be that the characters who would be entrusted with the exercise of this right, on behalf of the government, will not be deficient in the discretion, which it may require; at least the admitting of this presumption cannot be deemed too great a return of confidence for that very considerable large portion of it which the government is required to place in the Bank.  
Abandonning therefore ideas things which however desireable are not attainable whatever agreeable sides they may have are not practicable nor safe however agreeable or desirable, are neither practicable, nor safe, the following plan for the Constitution of a National Bank is respectfully submitted to the consideration of the House.  
I The Capital Stock of the Bank shall not to exceed 10.000.000 of Dollars divided into 20.000 shares each share being consisting of 500 Dollars; payable one fifth in gold and silver Coin and four fifths in that part of the public Debt bearing which according to the loan proposed by the Act to raise which sum subscriptions shall be opened on the first Monday of April next and shall and continue open until the whole shall be subscribed. shall bear an accruing interest at the time of payment of 6 per Centum per annum.  
II The amount of each share shall be payable one fifth in gold and silver coin and four fifths in that part of the public debt which according to the loan proposed by the Act making provision for the debt of the United States shall bear an accruing interest at the time of payment: of six per Centum per annum.

The interdiction of loans on account of the U States or of any particular state or of any foreign power is as it relates to the U States conformable to the spirit of will serve as a barrier to executive encroachments and to combinations inauspicious to the safety or contrary to the policy of the Union.  
The limitation of the rate of interest to 6 ⅌ Cent is dictated by the consideration that different rates prevail in different states parts of the Union; whence the propriety of a ru uniform rule and as the operations of the Bank may extend through the whole it seems expedient some rule seems to be necessary. There is room for a question whether the a limitation to five ⅌ Cent ought not rather to be to five per Cent than to six per Cent as is proposed. There It may without haz safely be affirmed It may be considered as morally certain It may be safely taken for granted There is great probability that the former rate would yield an ample dividend, probably perhaps as much as the latter, has heretofore yielded; by the extension which it would give to good business. or in other words to profitable undertakings to which The natural effect of low interest is to increase enterprise Trade and industry; because undertakings of every kind can be prosecuted with greater advantage. The difference of one per Cent may itself constitute It is not easy to imagine This is a truth generally admitted generally which obtains a general assent, but it is requisite to have analized the subject in all its relations to be able to form a just conception an adequate idea of the extent of that effect. Such an analysis cannot but will satisfy any an intelligent mind that the difference of one per Cent in the rate at which money may be had is capable of making an essential change for the better in the situation of a any country or place.

hat as far as the dividend on the stock shall exceed the interest paid on the loan there is a positive profit.  
The Secretary begs leave to conclude with this general observation that if the Bank of North America shall come forward with any propositions to the Legislature, which have for object the ingrafting upon that institution the general principles characteristics which shall appear to the Legislature proper necessary to the due extent and safety of a National Bank, there a are in his judgment weighty inducements to will solid reasons for giving every reasonable facility to the measure. Not only the pretensions of that institution from its original relation to the government of the United States and from the services it has rendered are such as a to claim ought to excite a disposition favourable to it; if those who are interested in it are willing on their part to place it on a footing satisfactory to the government and equal to the purposes of a Bank of the United States: But its cooperation would greatly materially accelerate the accomplishment of the great object, and the collision which might otherwise arise would be might in a variety of views ways prove equally disagreeable and injurious. The incorporation or union here contemplated may be effected in different modes under the auspices of an act of the United States, if it shall be desired by the Bank of North America upon terms, which shall appear expedient to the Government.

nent increase or decrease of the  
precious metals in a country, can  
hardly ever be a matter of indif-  
ference. As the commodity ta-  
ken in lieu of every other, it is a  
species of the most effective  
wealth, and as the money of the  
world, it is of great concern to  
the state, that it possess a suffi-  
ciency of it to face any demands  
which the protection of its exter-  
nal interests may create.  
  
The objection seems to admit  
of another, anda more conclusive  
answer which controverts the  
fact itself. A nation, that has no  
mines of its own, must derive the  
precious metals from others; ge-  
nerally speaking, in exchange for  
the products of its labour and in-  
dustry. The quantity it will pos-  
sess, will therefore, in the ordina-  
ry course of things, be regulated  
by the favourable or unfavourable  
balance of its trade; that is, by  
the proportion between its abili-  
ties to supply foreigners, and its  
wants of them; between the a-  
mount of its exportations, and  
that of its importations. Hence  
the state of its agriculture and  
manufactures; the quantity and  
quality of its labour and industry ;  
must, in the main, influence and  
determine, the increase or de-  
crease of its gold and silver.  
  
If this be true, the inference  
seems to be, that well constituted  
banks, favour the increase of the  
precious metals. It has been  
shown,

of this nature, is not omly desira-  
ble as it respects the govern-  
ment ; but it ought to be equally  
so to all those concerned in the  
institution; as an additional title  
to public and private confidence ;  
and as a thing which can only be  
formidable to practices that im-  
ply mismanagement. The pre-  
sumption must always be, that  
the characters who would be in-  
trusted with the exercise of this  
tight on behalf of the govern-  
ment, will not be deficient in the  
discretion which it may require ;  
at least the admitting of this  
presumption cannot be deemed  
too great a return of confidence  
for that very large portion of it  
which the government is requir-  
ed to place in the bank.  
Abandoning, therefore, ideas  
which however agreeable or de-  
sirable, are neither practicable  
nor safe, the following plan for  
the constitution of a national  
bank, is respectfully submitted  
to the consideration of the heuse.  
I. The capital stock of the  
bank shall not exceed ten million’  
of dollars, divided into twenty-five  
thousand shares, each share be-  
ing four hundred dollars ; to raise  
which sum, subscriptions shall  
be opened on the first Monday of  
April next, and shall continue o-  
pen until the whole shall be sub-  
scribed. Bodies politic, as well  
as individuals, may subscribe.  
Ii. The amount of each share  
shall be payable, one fourth in  
ld and silver coin, and three  
fourths in that part of the public  
debt, which, according to the  
loan proposed by the act making  
provision for the debt of the U-  
nited States, shall bear an accru-  
ing interest at the time of pay-  
ment of six per centum per an-  
num.

‘Lhe limitation of the rate of  
interest is dictated by the consi-  
deration, that different rates pre-  
vail in different parts of the uni-

bank may extend through the  
whole, some rule seems to be  
necessary. There is room for a  
question, whether the limitation  
ought not rather to be to five,than

exceed the interest paid on the  
loan, there is a positive profit.  
The secretary begs leave to  
conclude with this general obser-  
vation—T hat if the bank of North  
America shail come forward with  
any propositions, which have for  
their object the ingrafting upon  
that institution, the characteris-  
tics which shall appear to the  
legislature necessary to the due  
extent and safety of a national  
bank, there are, in his judgment,  
weighty inducements to giving  
every reasonable facility to the  
measure. Not only the preten-  
sions of that institution, from its  
original relation to the govern-  
ment of the United States, and  
from the services it has rendered,  
are such asto claim a disposition  
favourable to it, if those who are  
interested in it are willing, on  
their part, to place it on a footing  
satisfactory to the government,  
and equal to the purposes of a  
bank of the United States: but  
its co-operation would .naterially  
accelerate the acco. 1plishment of  
the great object, and the collision,  
which might otherwise arise,  
might, in a variety of ways, prove  
equally disagreeable and injuri-  
ous. The incorporation or union  
here contemplated, may be ef-  
fected in different modes, under  
the auspices of an act of the Uni-  
ted States, if it shall be desired  
by the bank of North America,  
upon terms which shall appear  
expedient to the government.

bidden by the constitution, and the issues of a Bank. He says:  
“The emitting of paper money, by the authority of government,  
is wisely prohibited to the individual States, by the national  
constitution, and the spirit of the prohibition, ought not ‘to be  
disregarded by the government of the U. States. Though pa-  
per emissions under a general authority, might have some ad-  
vantages, not applicable, and be free from some disadvantages  
which are applicable to the like emissions by the States, sep-  
arately, yet they are of a nature so liable to abuse, and it may  
even be affirmed so certain of being abused, that the wisdom  
of government will be shown in never trusting itself with the

use of so seducing and dangerous an expedient. In times of  
tranquility, it might have no ill consequence; it might even per-  
haps, be managed in a way to be productive of good; but in  
great and trying emergencies, there is almost a moral certainty  
of its becoming mischievous. The stamping of paper is an op-  
eration, so much easier than the laying of taxes, that a govern-  
ment, in the practice of paper emissions, would rarely fail, in  
any such emergency, to indulge itself too far, in the employ-  
ment of that resource, to avoid as much as possible, one less  
auspicious to present popularity. If it should not even be car-  
ried so far as to be rendered an absolute bubble, it would at  
least,. be likely to be extended to a degree, which would occa-  
sion an inflated and artificial state of things, incompatible with  
the regular and prosperous course of the political economy.  
  
“Among other material differences between a paper currency,  
issued by mere authority of government, and one issued by a  
Bank, payable in coin, is this: that in the first case, there is no  
standard to which an appeal can be made as to the quantity  
which will only satisfy or which will surcharge the circulation:  
in the last, that standard results from the demand. If more  
should be issued than is necessary, it will return upon the  
Bank. Its emissions, as elsewhere intimated, must always be  
in a compound ratio to the fund and the demand, whence it is  
evident that there is a limitation in the nature of the thing;  
while the discretion of the government is the only measure of  
the extent of the emissions by its own authority. This consid-  
eration further ijlustrates the danger of emissions of that sort,  
and the preference which is due to Bank paper.”  
  
This is evidence of the meaning of the phrase, of the very highest  
authority, and is conclusive, to show that in the opinion of the  
writer, bank notes payable in coin, were not the “ bills of cre-  
dit” spoken of in the constitution, on the contrary, while he ad

Mr. Secretary Hamilton’s Opinion in 1790.

teristics which shall appear to the legislature necessary to the due extent  
and safety of a national bank, there are, in his judgment, weighty induce-  
ments to giving every facility to the measure. Not only the pre-  
tensions of that institution, from its original relation to the government of  
the United States, and from the services it has rendered, are such as to claim  
a disposition favorable to it, if those who are interested in it are willing, on  
their part, to place it on a footing satisfactory to the government and equal  
to the purposes of a bank of the United States, but its co-operation would  
materially accelerate the accomplishment of the great object, and the colli-  
sion, which might otherwise arise, might, in a variety of ways, prove equally  
disagreeable and injurious. The incorporation or union here contemplated  
may be effected in different modes, under the auspices of an act of the Uni-  
ted States, if it shall be desired by the Bank of North America upon term  
which shall appear expedient to the government.

Ifa patient has pleurisy then, shall we bleed him? This question does

The age, sex, season of the year, kind of attack as sthenic or asthenic,  
stage of the disease, condition of the patient, coexisting disease, and a  
host of other circumstances are all to be taken into the account, weigh-
