Department of State February 14th 1804  
You will herewith receive the ratification by the President and Senate, of the Convention with the British Government signed on the 12th of May 1803, with an exception of the Vth article. Should the British Government accede to this change in the instrument, you will proceed to an exchange of ratifications and transmit the one received, without delay, in order that the proper steps may be taken for carrying the Convention into effect. As the same considerations which led to the arrangements settled by it, urge a prompt execution of them, it may be expected that the steps depending on that Government, will be hastened. As far as your exhortations may be requisite, you will of course apply them.  
The objection to the 5th. article appears to have arisen from the posteriority of the signature and ratification of this Convention to those of the last Convention with France ceding Louisiana to the United States; and from a presumption that the line to be run in pursuance of the 5th article might thence be found or alledged to abridge the Northern extent of that acquisition.  
It may reasonably be expected that the British Government will make no difficulty in concurring in this alteration; because,  
First—It would be unreasonable, that any advantage against the United States should be constructively authorized by the posteriority of the dates in question; the instructions given to enter into the Convention, and the understanding of the parties at the time of signing it, having no reference whatever to any territorial rights of the U States acquired by the previous Convention with France, but referring merely to the territorial rights, as understood at the dates of the instructions for and signature of the British Convention. The copy of a letter from Mr King hereto annexed, is precise and conclusive on this subject.  
Secondly—If the V article be expunged the North boundary of Louisiana, will, as is reasonable, remain the same in the hands of the U States, as it was in the hands of France; and may be adjusted and established according to the principles and authorities which would in that case have been applicable.  
3dly. There is reason to believe that the boundary between Louisiana and the British territories north of it were actually fixed commissioners appointed under the Treaty of Utrich and that this boundary was to run from the Lake of the Woods westwardly in latitude forty nine in which case the Vth Article would be nugatory as the line from the Lake of the Woods to the nearest source of the Mississippi would run thro territory which on both sides of the line would belong to the United States. Annexed is a paper stating the authority on which the decision of the commissioners under the Treaty of Utrich rests and the reasoning opposed to the construction making the forty nine of latitude the northern boundary of Louisiana with marginal notes in support of that construction. This paper will put you more readily into possession of the subject as it may enter into your discussions with the British Government. But you will perceive the necessity of recurring to the proceedings of the commissioners as the source of authentic information. These are not within our reach here, and it must consequently be left to your own researches and judgment to determine the proper use to be made of them.  
4thly Laying aside however all the objections to the Vth Article, the proper extension of a dividing line in that quarter will be equally open for friendly negotiation after, as without agreeing to, the other parts of the Convention; and considering the remoteness of the time at which such a line will become actually necessary, the postponement of it, is of little or no consequence. The truth is, that the British Government seemed at one time to favor this delay, and the instructions given by the United States readily acquiesced in it. The annexed extracts from Mr King’s and Mr Gore’s letters with that from the Department of State will explain this observation.  
The fourth article of the Convention provides that the Commissioners shall be respectively paid in such manner as shall be agreed between the two parties, such agreement to be settled at the time of the exchange of ratifications. It has been supposed that the compensation allowed to the Commissioners under the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, who settled the St Croix boundary would be satisfactory to the British Government, and upon this idea, the estimate, of which a copy is inclosed, was framed as the basis of an appropriation to be asked from Congress. The President authorizes you therefore to agree to the sum mentioned therein viz $4444 44/100 to be paid by each Government to the Commissioner appointed by itself, and the same sum being allowed to the third Commissioner to be paid to him in equal portions by the two Governments. Should however the British Government insist upon a variation of the compensation from the sum above mentioned, you may consent to it provided it does not exceed $6666 66/100 dollars, each party contributing equally to the payment and each Commissioner receiving the same sum as his Colleagues.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,  
• February 11, 1804  
SIR,  
You will herewith receive the ratification by  
the ’&#x27;resident and senate, of the convention with  
the British government signed on the IStliof  
May, 1803, with an exception of the 5th aiticle.  
Should the British government accede to this  
change in the instrument, you will proceed to an  
exchange of ratifications and transmit the one  
received without gelay, in order that the proper  
yteps may be taken for carrying the convention  
i&#x27;do effect. As the same considerations which  
ied to the arrangements settled by it, urge a  
prompt execution of them, it may be expected  
that the steps depending on that government will  
be hastened. As far as your exhortations may be  
requisite, you will of course apply them.  
The objection to the Vth. article appears to  
have arisen from the posteriority of the signature  
and ratification of this convention to those of the  
last convention with France, ceding Louisiana to  
lie United States, and from a presumption that  
the line to be run in pursuance of the Vth. arti­  
cle might thence be found or alleged to abridge  
the northern extent of that acquisition.  
It may reasonably lie expected that the British  
government will make no difficulty in concurring  
in this alteration, because  
First. It would be unreasonable that any ad­  
vantage against the United States should be con­  
structively authorised bv the posteriority of the  
•lutes in question : the instructions given to enter  
into the convention, and the understanding of the  
part es at the umc of signing it, having no refer­  
ence whatever to anv territorial rights of the U­  
nited States acquired by the previous ccnventit i.  
with France, Lut referring merely to the territo­  
rial rights as understood ..t the date ot the in  
struct ions for, and signature of the British con­  
vention. The copy of a letter frsm Mr. King,  
nereto annexed, is precise and conclusive on tins  
  
VI IJV.VI.  
Secondly. If the Vth. article be expunged,  
the north boundary of Louisiana will, as is rea­  
sonable, remain the same in the hands of the U­  
nted Siates as it was in the hands of France, and  
be adjusted and established according to the  
principles and authorities which would in that  
case have been applicable.  
i&#x27;hirdly. There is reason to believe that the  
boundary between Louisiana and the British ter­  
ritories north ol it, were actually fixed by com­  
missioners appointed under the treaty of Utrecht,  
and that this boundary was to run from the Lake  
ot the Woods, westwardly in lat. 49, in which  
case the Vth. article would be nugatory, as tlx*  
line from the Lake ot the Woods to the neare •  
source ot the Mississippi, would run through 1  
territory which on both sides of the line would  
belong to the United States. Annexed is a paper !  
-.rating the authority on which the decision of the  
commissioners under the treaty of Utrecht rests :  
and the reasoning opposed to the construction  
making the 49th deg. of latitude the northern  
boundary of Louisiana, with marginal notes in  
support of that construction. This pap&#x27;-r will  
put you more readily into possession of ike sub­  
wet as it may enter into yqtii discussions \ it lithe  
British government. But you will perceive the  
1 necessity ot recurring to the proceedings ot the  
c immissioners, as the source of Millionth infor­  
mation. These are not within our reach here,  
and it must consequently lie let. to your own re­  
searches anil judgment to dcurminelhe propel  
■ s to be made ot them.  
Fourthly. Laying aside, however, all the o *  
jections to the Vth. article, the proper eitension of  
dividing line in that quarter will be equal.y  
Pen for friendly negotiation after, as wit both,&quot; a  
greeing to the other parts of the convention ; • .d  
c insidering the remoteness of the uifie ui which  
such a line will become actually ncccss. ry, the  
postponement of it is of little or no consequence  
I lie truth is, that the British government m*. ic­  
ed at one time to favor this delay, and the insu no­  
tions given by the United States readily acquies­  
ced in it Tlie annexed extracts from Mr. King’s  
and Mr Gore’s letters, will, with that from the  
de -ailment of state, explain this observation  
The fourth article of the convention provide s,  
that the commissioners shall he respectively paid  
in such mannei as shall be agreed between the  
t wo parties, such agreement to he settled at the  
time of the exchange of ratifications. It fias been  
supposed that the compensation allowed to the  
commissioners under the treaty of amity, com­  
merce and navigation, who settled the St. Croix  
boundary, would be satisfactory to the British  
government ; and upon this idea the estimate,  
o. which a copy is inclosed, wall framed as the  
oasis of an appropriation to be asked from con­  
gress. The president authorises you, therefore, i  
to agree to the sum mentioned therein, viz !  
£&gt;4,444 44 ds. to be paid by each government  
to the commissioner appointed by itself, the same I  
sum being allowed the third commissioner, to he :  
paid to nun in equal portions by the two govern-,  
incuts. Should, however, the British government J  
insist upon a variation of the compensation from ]  
die smn above mentioned, you may consent to it,  
provided it does not exceed &amp; 6,6(36 66 cts. each j  
party contributing equally to the payment, and  
each commissioner receiving the same sum as his  
colleagues.

Department of Stale, Feb. 14, 1804.  
Stn,  
You will herewith receive the ratification by the  
president and senate, of the convention with the  
British government signed on the 12th of May,  
1863. with an exception of the 5th article. Should  
the British government accede to thischange in the  
instrument, yot^wtll proceed to an exchange of ra­  
tifications and transmit the one received w ithout de­  
lay, in order that the proper steps may be. taken  
for carrying the convention into effect. As tie  
•ame considerations winch led to the arrangements

may be expectedJh.it the steps depending on that  
government will lie hastened. As I tr as your ex­  
hortations may he requisite, you will of course, ap­  
ply them.  
The objection to the Vth article appears to have  
•risen fmm the posteriority ot the signature and  
ratification of this convention to those of the last  
convention with France, reding Louisiana to the  
United States, and Irom a presumption that the  
line to he run in pursuanceof the V&#x27;th a&#x27;ticle might  
thence be found or alledged to abridge the northern  
extent of that acquisition.  
It ui tv reasonably he expected that the British

date of the instructions tor, and sign iture of the  
British convention, The copy of a letter from Mr.  
Kmu, hereto annexed, is precise and com lusive uu  
this subjert.  
Secondly. If the Vth article be exchanged, ti e  
north hound try of Louisiana will, as is reasonable,  
remain the same in the bands of the Uni ltd States  
as it was in the hands ot France, and may be ad­  
justed and established according to the principles  
and authorities wlitth would in that case have been  
applicable.  
  
thirdly. there is reason to believe that the  
boundary between Lmmiana and the British terri­  
tories norih &lt;&gt;l it. wercsaciually fixer) by commissi­  
oners appointed under the treaty of Utrerht, and  
th it this boundary &quot;’as to run Iron) the Lake oi the

Vtl) article would he nugatory, as the line from the  
Lake of the Woods to the nearest source of the  
lilibsissippi, would run through territory which on  
both sides of the line would belong to tile United  
States. Annexed is a paper stating the anthority  
on which the decision of the commissioners under  
the treaty of Utrecht rests : and the reasoning op­  
posed to the construction making the 4yth deg. of  
latitude the northern boundary of Louisiana, with  
marginal notes in support of that construction.—  
This paper will put you more readily into posses­  
sion of the sqbjert as it may enter into your discus­  
sions with tlu British government. But yna will  
perceive the nei essity of recurring to the proceed­  
tugs of the commissioners, as the source of authen­  
tich information. These are not within our reach  
here, and it must consequently he left to your own

Use to be made of them.  
Fourthly. Laying aside, hnwevr r, all the objec­  
tions to the Vth article, the proper extension of a  
dividing tine in that quarter will he equally open  
for friendly negotiation alter, as without, agreeing  
to the other parts of the convention ; and consi­  
dering the remoteness of the time at which such a  
line will heroine&#x27;actually necessary, the postpone­  
ment of it is of little or no consequence. The  
truth is, that the British government seemed at  
one time to favour this delay, and the instructions  
given hy the United Stales readily acquiesced in it.  
The annexed extracts from Mr. King&#x27;s and Mr.  
Gore’s letters, will, with that limn the department  
of state, explain this observation.  
The fourth article of the convention provides,  
that the commissioners shall be respectively paid in  
•urh manner as shall be agreed between the two  
&#x27; parlies, such agreement to be settled at the time ol  
the exchange of ratifications. It has been suppos­  
ed that the compensation allowed to the commissi

the convention signed, and laid before  
the senate for ratification. Again, in  
this case, the President Jefferson raised  
an objection, which again, from being  
resisted by our negotiators, led to the  
ultimate defeat of the whole measure;  
and this objection, too, was to no vital  
point— it affected not in the least the  
question settled by the Ashburton treaty.

The objection (says Mr. Monroe, Secre-  
tary of State, in a letter to Mr. King,  
minister at St. James&#x27;s for the United  
States), the objection (the only one  
raised ) to the fifth article appears to have  
arisen from the posteriority of the signa-  
ture and ratification of this convention  
to those of the last convention with  
France, ceding Louisiana to the United  
States, and from a presumption that the  
line to be run in pursuance of the fifth  
article might thence be found or alleged  
to abridge the northern extent of that  
acquisition.’ This point was evidently  
raised by Jefferson with a view to disturb
