Dear Sir  
Monticello June 7. 16.  
  
I recieved, a few days ago, from mr Dupont, the inclosed MS. with permission to read it, and a request, when read, to forward it to you, in expectation that you would translate it. it is well worthy of publication for the  
			 instruction of our citizens, being profound, sound, and short. our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their powers: that their true office is to declare and  
			 enforce  
			 only our natural rights and duties, &amp; to take none of them from us.   No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of  
			 another; and this is all from which the laws ought  
			 to  
			 restrain him: and every man is under the natural duty of contributing to the necessities of the society; and this is all the laws should enforce on him: and, no man having a natural right to be the judge  
			 between himself and another, it is his natural duty to submit to the umpirage of an impartial third. the l when the laws have declared and enforced all this, they have fulfilled their functions, and the idea is quite unfounded that on entering into society we give up any natural right. the trial of  
			 every law by one of these texts would lessen much the labors of our legislators, &amp; lighten equally our municipal codes. there is a work of the first order of merit now in the press at Washington, by Destutt-Tracy, on the subject of political economy, which he brings into the compass of 300. pages 8vo. in a preliminary discourse on the origin of the right of property he coincides much with the pr

Government has the power over slavery that it has

power over it to abolish it for ever. The truth of  
the case is, that like all other civil govern-

detrimental to the interests, corrupting

1836.  
&quot;LOCO FOCO, NEW YORK, JANUARY.  
We hold these truths to be self evi­  
dent, that all men are created free and  
equal; that they are endowed by their  
Creator with certain inalienable rights,  
among which are life, liberty and the  
pursuit of happiness; that the true  
foundation of Republican government  
is the enual rights of every citizen m  
his nerson and&quot; property, and in their  
management ; thathe idea is quite un  
  
founded that on entering into society  
we give up any natural right; that the  
rightful power of all legislation is to  
declare and enforce only our natural  
rights and duties; and to take none of  
them from us; that no man has the  
natural right to commit aggressions on  
the equal rights of another, and this is  
all from which the law ought to re­  
strain him; that every man is under  
the natural duty of contributing to the  
necessities of society, and this is all the  
law should enforce on him ; that when  
the la ws have declared and enforced all  
this, they have fulfilled their functions.  
We declare unqualified hostility to  
bank notes and paper money as a cir­  
culating medium, because gold and  
silver are the only safe and constitu  
tsonal currency ; hostility to any and  
all monopolies by legislation, because  
they are violations of equal rights cf  
the people; hostility to the dangerous  
and unconstitutional creation of vested  
rights or prerogatives by legislition,
