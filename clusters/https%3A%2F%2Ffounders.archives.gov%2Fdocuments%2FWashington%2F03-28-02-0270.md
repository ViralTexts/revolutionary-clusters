That there are the most conclusive reasons for reducing the number of Regiments no person acquainted with the situation of our affairs and the state of the Army will deny. A want of Officers independant of other considerations were sufficient to compel us to it. But that the  temper of the Army produced by its sufferings requires great caution, in any reforms that are attempted, is a position not less evident than the former. In Services the best established, Where the hands of Government are strengthned, by the strongest interests of the Army to submission, the reducing of its regiments and dismissing a great part of its Officers is always a measure of delicacy &amp; difficulty. In ours, where the Officers are held by the feeblest ties and are mouldering away by dayly resignations—it is peculiarly so—The last reduction occasioned many to quit the Service besides those who were reformed, and left durable seeds of discontent among those who remained—The general topic of declamation was, that it was as hard as dishonorable for men, who had made every sacrafice to the Service to be turned out of it at the pleasure of those in power without any adequate compensation. In the maturity to which their uneasinesses have now risen from a continuance in misery, they will be still more impatient under an attempt of a similar nature—how far these dispositions may be reasonable I pretend not to decide but in the extremity to which we are arrived policy forbids us to add new irritations—Too many of the Officers wish to get rid of their Commissions; but they are unwilling to be forced into it.  
It is not the intention of these remarks to discourage a reform; but to show the necessity of guarding against the ill effects by an ample provision both for the Officers who stay and for those who are reduced. This should be the basis of the plan and without it I apprehend the most mischievous consequences. this would obviate many scruples that will otherwise be found prejudicial in the extreme. I am convinced Congress are not a little straitned in the means of a present provision so ample as to give satisfaction; but this proves the expediency of a future one; and brings me to that which I have so frequently recommended as the most economical, the most politic and the most effectual that could be devised—A half pay for Life. Supported by a prospect of a permanent dependence, the Officers would be tied to the Service and would submit to many momentary privations and to the inconveniencies which the situation of public affairs makes unavoidable; this is exemplified in the Pensylvania Officers, who being upon this establishment are so much interested in the Service, that in the course of five Months, there has been only one resignation in that line.  
If the objection drawn from the principle of this measure being incompatible with the genious of our government is thought insurmountable—I would propose a substitute less eligible in my opinion, but which may answer the purpose; it is to make the present half pay for Seven years whole pay for the same period to be advanced in two different payments, one half in a year after the conclusion of peace the other half in two years subsequent to the first. It will be well to have  it clearly understood that the reduced Officers are to have the depreciation of their pay made good, lest any doubt should arise on this head.  
No objection occurs to me, to this measure, except it be thought too great an expence; but in my judgment whatever can give consistency to our military establishment will be ultimately favourable to economy. It is not easy to be conceived except by those who are witnesses to it what an additional waste &amp; consumption of every thing and consequently what an increase of expence, results from the laxness of discipline in the Army—and where the Officers think they are doing the public a favor by holding their Commissions &amp; the men are continually fluctuating it is impossible to maintain discipline. Nothing can be more obvious than that a sound Military establishment and the interests of economy are the same. How much more the purposes of the War will be promoted by it in other respects will not admit of an argument.  
In reasoning upon the measure of a future provision I have heard Gentlemen object the want of it in some foreign Armies, without adverting to the difference of circumstances. The Military state holds the first rank in most of the Countries of Europe and is the road to honor &amp; emolument—the establishment is permanent, and whatever be an Officer’s provision it is for life—and he has a profession for life—He has future as well as present motives of military honor &amp; preferment—He is attached to the Service by the spirit of the Government—By education and in most cases by early habit; his present condition if not splendid is comfortable, Pensions—distinctions—and particular priviledges are commonly his rewards in retirement. In the case of the American Officers the Military character has been suddenly taken up and is to end with the War.  
The number of Regiments fixed upon by Congress is that which I

It is my duty also to inform Congress that in the late conference with the French General &amp; Admiral—though I could not give assurances, I was obliged to give an opinion of the force we might have the next campaign; and I stated the Army in this quarter at fifteen thousand operative Continental Troops, wch will greatly exceed that which we should have by the proposed arrangement for it would not give us above Eleven. On this idea of fifteen thousand a memorial with a plan for next campaign has been transmitted to the Court of France.

 the two Officers I have mentioned have the best claims to public attention. Colonel Armand is an Officer of great merit wch added to his being a foreigner—to his rank in life—and to the sacrafices of property he has made renders it a point of delicacy as well as justice to continue to him the means of serving honorably. Major Lee has rendered such distinguished Services and possesses so many Talents for Commanding a Corps of this nature—he deserves so much credit for the perfection in which he has kept his Corps—as well as for the handsome exploits he has performed, that it would be a loss to the Service and a discouragement to merit to reduce him. And I do not see how he can be introduced into one of the Regiments in a  manner satisfactory to himself and which will enable him to be equally useful, without giving too much disgust to the whole line of the Cavalry.

heretofore.  
Congress will herewith receive a list of the Officers in New Hampshire—Massachusetts—Connecticut—New York New Jersey—Pensylvania &amp; Maryland line (previous to its marching to the Southward)—Also in Crane’s &amp; Lamb’s Artillery—Sheldons Horse—and in Hazens—Sherburne’s—Spencers &amp; Livingstons Regiments who have actually had their resignations entered at Head Qrs in the course of this year, and who in general urged their necessities when they applied on the subject—and insisted, notwithstanding every perswasion to induce their continuance, that their circumstances would not admit of their remaining in Service longer. Besides these resignations there are a great many of which I have no certain account as the Officers being permitted to go home on furlough in the course of the Winter, have never rejoined the Army, and have only sent messages or written to their regimental  Officers that their own distresses and those of their families would not permit their return. As to the resignations which may have taken place in the Virginia line and the other Troops at the Southward since they were acting in that quarter—I have no account of them; but I make no doubt that many have happened. All these serve to show the necessity of some more competent establishment than the present one—and I hold it my duty to mention, from the accts I daily receive, unless this is the case, that I have strong reasons to believe we shall not be able to retain after the end of the Campaign, as many Officers, especially in some lines, as will be even sufficient for common duties when in Quarters. If matters fortunately should not proceed to the lengths my fears forebode, yet Congress will be sensible at the first view, of the injuries and great inconveniencies which must attend such a continual change of Officers &amp; consequent promotions which are and will be inevitable.  
After having exhibited this view of the present state of the Army it is almost needless to add, that excepting in the rank of Field Officers and a very few Captains we shall have new Officers to provide rather than old ones to disband at the reduction of Regiments—and where they are to be had I know not—no disposition having been discovered of late to enter the Service—Congress have little to apprehend therefore on acct of the expence of supernumerary Officers when this event takes place.

&quot;the temper of the army, produced by its ſufſerings, requires great tan»  
tion, in any reforms that are attempted, is a poſition not leſs evident that  
the tormer. In ſervices the beſt eſtabliſhed, where the hands of govern-  
ment are ſtrengthened by the ſtrongeſt intereſts of the army to ſubmiſſion,  
the reducing its regiments, and diſmiffing great part of its officers, is  
always a meaſure of delicacy and difficulty. In ours, where the officers  
are held by the ſeebleſt ties, and are mouldering away by daily refigna-  
tions, it is peculiarly fo.---The laſt reduction occafioned many to quit  
the ſervice, beſides thoſe who were reformed, and left durable ſeeds of  
&#x27;diſcontent among thoſe who remained.  
  
The general topic of declamation was, that it was as hard as diſhonor-  
able for men, who had made every ſacrifice to the ſervice, to be turned  
out of it at the pleaſure of thoſe in power, without an adequate com-  
  
ſation. In the maturity to which their uneaſineſſes have now ariſen,  
rom a continuance in miſery, they will be till more impatient under an  
attempt of a ſimilar nature.---How far theſe diſpoſitions may be reaſon-  
able, I pretend not to decide, but in the extremity to which we are ar-  
Tived, Policy forbids us to add new irritations.---Too many of the ofh-  
cers wiſh to get rid of their commiſſions, but they are not willing to be  
forced to it, It is not the intention of theſe remarks to diſcourage a re-  
form, but to ſhew the neceſſity of guarding againſt the ill eflects, by an  
ample proviſion, both for the officers who ſtay, and for thoſe who are  
reduced : This ſhould be the baſis of the plan, and withont it, I ap -  
prehend the moſt miſchievous conſequences. This would obviate many  
ſeruples that will otherwiſe be found prejudicial in the extreme. I am  
convinced Congreſs are not a-little ſtraitened in the means of a preſent  
proviſion, ſo ample as to give ſatisfaction, but this proves the expedien-  
cy of a future one, an d brings me to that which I have fo frequent,  
ly recommended, as the moſt ceconomical, the moſt politic and the moſt  
effeQus] that could be deviſed, a half-pay for life. Supported by a proſ-  
peR of a permanent dependence, the officers would be tied to the ſervice,  
and would ſubmit to many momentary privations and to the inconveni-  
ences, which the ſituation of public affairs makes unavoidable. This is  
exemplified in the Pennſylvania officers, who being upon this eſtabliſh-  
  
  
months there has been only one reſignation in that line.  
  
If the objection, drawn from the principle of this meaſure being in-  
compatible with the genius of our government, is thought inſarmounts-  
ble, I would propoſe a ſubſtitute, leſs eligible in my opinion, but which may  
anſwer the purpoſe; it is, to make the preſent half-pay for ſeven years,  
whole pay for the ſame period, to be advanced at two different payments,  
one halt in a year after the concluſiun of peace, the other half in  
two years ſubſequent to the fiiſt. e  
  
  
  
No obyechon to this meaſure nccurs to me, except it be thought too  
great an expence ; but in my judgment, whatev can give conſiſtency  
to our military eſtabliſhment, will be ultimately favourable to economy.  
It is not eaſy to be conceived, except by thoſe who are witnefſles to it,  
what an additional waſte and conſumption of every e. and conſe -  
quently what an encreaſe of expence, reſults from the | -+reſs of diſcipline  
in the army. And where the officers think they are doing the public a  
favor, by holding their commiſſions, and the men are continually fluc ·  
tuating. it is umpcfſible tu maintain diſcipline, Nothing can be to me  
more obvious, than that a ſound military eſtabliſhment, and the intereſt  
of ceconomy, are the ſam&quot;. How much more the purpoſes of the war  
would be promoted by it, in other reſpects, will not admit of an argu-  
ment.  
  
In reaſoning upon the meaſure of a future proviſion, I have heard  
tlemen object, the want of it in ſome foreign armies, without advert-  
ing to the ditterence of circumſtances. The military ſtate holds the firſt  
rank in moſt of the countries of Europe, and is the road to honor and  
emolument. The cſtabliſhment is permanent, and whatever be an offl-  
cer&#x27;s proviſion, it is tor life, and he has a profeſſion for life. He has  
Future, as well as, preſent motives af military honor and preferment ; he  
is attached to the ſervice, by the ſpirit ot the government, by education,  
and in moſt caſes, by early habit; his preſent condition, though not  
ſplendid, is comfortable, penfions and diſtinctions and particular privi-  
leges, are commonly his reward in retirement. In the caſe of the Ame-  
_ rican officers, the military chat acter has been ſuddenly taken up, and is  
to end with the war.

a great Pork of its officers, is always a meaſure of difficul-

the feebleſt ties, and are mouldering away by daily re-

avoidable, This is exemplified in the Peunſylvania offi-  
cers, who, being upon this eſtabliſhment, are fo much

« Tf the objection drawn from the principle of this

No objection to this meaſure occurs to me, except it

favour by holding their commiſſions, and the men are  
cantinually fluctuating, it is impoſſible to maintain dif.  
cipline. Nothing can ro me be more obvious than thar
