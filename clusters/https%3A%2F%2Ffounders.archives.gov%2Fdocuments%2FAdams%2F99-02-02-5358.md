Quincy, May 9, 1809.  
				  
				Mr. Hamilton, in his famous pamphlet, page 23,  
says, “the conduct pursued bore sufficient marks of courage and elevation to raise the national character to an exalted height throughout Europe.”“Much it is to be deplored that we should have been  
precipitated from this proud eminence, without necessity,  
without temptation.”  
It is the habitual practice of our parties, to affirm or  
deny, as they find it to their purpose, the honor or the  
disgrace that is produced in Europe by our measures.  
But neither party know any thing about the matter.  
The truth is, that our affairs are much less spoken or  
thought of, in Europe, than we imagine. In all parts  
of Europe, but especially in France and England,  
they are constantly misrepresented and misunderstood.  
Most of all in England. I will venture to say, that  
Mr. Hamilton wrote entirely at random, and without  
a glimmering of genuine information, when he mentioned  
both the exaltation and precipitation of our national character. To appeal to the courtiers or cabinet, or to the diplomatic corps in Europe, would be idle; because none  
of them will ever read Hamilton’s pamphlet or those papers. But I would not hesitate to submit the whole subject to any of them. I shall take another course. Chief  
Justice Ellsworth is no more. I can no longer appeal to  
him. If I could, I would say no more than the truth,  
but it would be more than I shall now say; and I aver  
that his representation to me was the direct reverse of  
Hamilton’s dogmatical assertions. Governor Davie still lives, and to him I appeal with confidence. He declared  
to me, that to judge of the conduct of the American  
government, both in their naval and other preparations  
for war, and in their political and diplomatic negociations  
upon that occasion, a man must go to Europe, where it  
was considered as the greatest demonstration of genius,  
firmness and wisdom. If I represent the Governor’s expressions in stronger terms than those he used, I request  
him to correct them.  
In England, I know the Anti-Jacobin Journal abused  
us, and so did Macdonald, Cobbett, Smith, and every  
Briton in Europe and America, who wished us at war  
with France and in alliance with England. But even in  
England all the sober part of the nation applauded us, and  
that to such a degree, that it soon became the popular cry,  
“We must imitate the United States of America, change  
our ministers, and make peace.” Accordingly they did  
soon change their ministers and make peace at Amiens.  
Mr. Liston, whose character I respect, had run through  
a long course of diplomatic experience in various courts and countries in Europe, from a secretary of legation and  
charge des affaires to the grade of minister plenipotentiary,  
and thence to that of ambassador at Constantinople, was  
probably a better judge than Mr. Hamilton, who had no  
experience at all in any diplomatic station, and who, I  
dare to say, had read very little on the subject of diplomatic functions, and still less of the history of embassies  
or of the printed despatches of ambassadors. Mr. Liston,  
if any body, knew what would procure honor to a nation  
or government, and what disgrace: what would raise the dignity, or what depress it: what was triumph,  
and what humiliation. Now I affirm, that the first time Mr. Liston saw me after he had been informed of the communications of the  
French Directory, through Talleyrand, Mr. Pichon and  
Mr. Murray, he said to me these words—“To what humiliations will not these Frenchmen stoop, to appease you? I  
am very sorry for it: I own, I did hope they would have  
gone to war with you.” I smiled, but made no answer. I  
wanted no proof of the sincerity of this declaration. I doubted not the sincerity of his wish, more than I did that  
of Mr. Canning and his associates in the Anti-Jacobin,  
who, upon receiving the news of Mr. Murray’s nomination, proclaimed that jacobinism was triumphant and carrying all before it in America. They could not, or would  
not, distinguish between jacobinism and neutrality. Every  
thing with them was jacobinism, except a war with France  
and an alliance with Great Britain. They all panted for  
a war between the United States and France as sincerely,  
though not so ardently, as Alexander Hamilton.  
There were not wanting insinuations and instigations  
to me, to confer with Mr. Liston on the subject of  
an alliance with Great Britain. And Mr L. himself repeatedly suggested to me. in very modest and  
delicate terms, however, his readiness to enter into any  
explanations on that head. I always waved it with as  
easy a politeness as I could. But my system was determined, and had been so for more than twenty years, that  
is, to enter into no alliance with any power in Europe. In case of war with England, I would not enter into any  
alliance with France. In case of war with France, I  
would not form any alliance with England. We want  
no alliance: we are equal to all our own necessary wars.  
“Non tali auxilio, nec defensoribus istis, tempus eget.” We might aid and be aided by a power at war with our  
enemy, and might concert operations from time to time;  
but I would take no engagement that should tie up our  
hands from making peace whenever we pleased. Had  
the war with France continued, I might have been drawn  
by the force of public opinion, or the influence of the  
legislature, into an alliance with England; but it would  
have been against my own judgment and inclination.  
Let me conclude this letter with an anecdote. Dr.  
Franklin told me, that before his return to America from  
England, in 1775, he was in company, I believe at Lord  
Spencer’s, with a number of English noblemen, when the  
conversation turned upon fables, those of Æsop, La Fontaine, Gay, Moore, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Some of the company  
observed that he thought the subject was exhausted. He did not believe that any man could now find an animal,  
beast, bird, or fish, that he could work into a new fable  
with any success; and the whole company appeared to  
applaud the idea, except Franklin, who was silent. The  
gentlemen insisted on his opinion. He said, with submission to their lordships, he believed the subject was inexhaustible, and that many new and instructive fables might  
be made out of such materials. Can you think of  
one at present? If your lordship will furnish me a pen,  
ink and paper, I believe I can furnish your lordship with  
one in a few minutes. The paper was brought, and he  
sat down and wrote:—  
Once upon a time, an eagle scaling round a farmer’s  
barn, and espying a hare, darted down upon him like a  
sun beam, seized him in his claws, and re-mounted with  
him in the air. He soon found that he had a creature  
of more courage and strength than a hare, for which,  
notwithstanding the keenness of his eye-sight, he had  
mistaken a cat. The snarling and scrambling of the prey  
was very inconvenient, and what was worse, she had disengaged herself from his talons, grasped his body with  
her four limbs, so as to stop his breath, and seized fast  
hold of his throat with her teeth. Pray, said the eagle,  
let go your hold and I will release you. Very fine, said  
the cat, I have no fancy to fall from this height and be  
crushed to death. You have taken me up, and you shall  
stoop and let me down. The eagle thought it necessary  
to stoop accordingly. The moral was so applicable to  
England and America, that the fable was allowed to be  
original and highly applauded.  
Let Hamilton say what he will, the French Directory  
found it convenient to stoop and set us down on our  
honest ground of neutrality and impartiality, as the English did eagle formerly, and now does a second time.

and inclination. . i  
Let me conclude this letter&#x27;with an  
anecdote. Dr. Franklin told melthat  
before his return to America from  
England, in 1775, he was in com­  
pany, I believe at Liord Spencer’s with  
-a number of Englith noblemen, when  
the conversation turned upon fables,  
those of ZEfop, La Fontaine, Gay,  
Moore, &amp;c. &amp;c. Some one of the  
company observed that he thought the  
fusject was exhausted. He did not  
beiieve that any man could now find  
an anmimal, beast, bird, or fifh, that ke  
could work into a new fable witk any  
success ; and the whole company ap­  
peared to applaud the idea, except  
Franklin, who was silent. The gen­  
tlemen infited on his opinion. He  
said, with submission to their lordships  
he believed the fubje&amp; was inexhausti­  
ble, and that many new and instruc­  
tive fables might be made out of such  
materials. Can you think of one at  
present ? If your lordship will furnifh  
me 2 pen, ink and paper, I believe I  
can furnith your lordship with one in  
a few minutes. The ‘paper was  
brought and he fat down and wrote :  
Once upon a time, an eagle scaling  
round a farmer’s barn, and espying a  
hare darted down upon him like a  
fun beam, seized him in his claws,and  
re mounted with him in the air. He  
soon found that he had a creature of  
more courage and [trength thana  
hare, for which, notwithstanding: the  
kesnnefs of his eye fight, he had mis­  
taken acat. The snarling and scram­  
bling of the prey was very inconveni­  
“ent, and what was worse she had dis­  
engaged herfelf from his talons gras­  
ped his body with ber four limbs {o as  
to stop his breath, and seized faft hold  
of his throat with her teeth. Pray, said  
the eagle, let go your hold and I will  
release you. Very fine, said the cat,  
I have no fancy to fall from this

m—— O Ag&quot;  
hMR. HAMILTON, in his fumous pam~  
phlet, page 23, says, &amp; the conduct Ew  
bore sufficient marks of courage and elevation  
to raise the national character o wn exalted  
height thronql\om Europe.” ‘  
“ Much it is to be deplored that we should  
have been precipitated from this proud ewis  
nence, without necessity, without stoifiptas  
tion : i  
  
It is the habitual tice of our parties,  
to affirmh or deny; u&amp;:ﬁnd it to their pur­  
&#x27;S:oc, the honour or thodl-gmcthnisgt:-  
~duced in Europe by our measures. But nei­  
ther m know pny thing about the matter,  
T ST  
spoken oOF haught of-in Buropey thull we  
imagine:” In all parts of Europe, but espe­  
cially in France and England, they are con­  
stantly misrepresented and misthderstood   
Most of all in Englend. I will venture to say,  
that Mr.-Hamilton wrote entirely at random,  
and without a glimmering of genuine infor­  
mation, when he mentioned both the exalta­  
tion and precipitation of our national charac­  
ter. To appeal to the courtiers .or abhet,.  
or to the dimnadck corps in Europe, would  
be idle ; because none of them will ever read  
Hamilton’s pamphlet or these papers. But  
I would not hesitate ta submit the whole subs  
ject to any of them. I shall take another  
course. Chief Justice Ellsworth is no more.  
I can no longer appeal to him. Ifl counld, I  
would say no more, thin the truth, but i;.  
would be more than I shall now sty ; and  
aver that his representation to me, wus the dis  
rect reverse of Hamilton’s dogmatical asser-  
Aions, Governgur Davie still Jives, and to  
him I appeal.with confidence, Ie declared  
to me, that to judge of the conduct of the A«  
merican government, both in their naval and  
other preparations for war, und in their polit«  
ical and diplomatick negociations upon that  
occasion, a man must go to Europe, where  
it was considered as the greatest demonstra­  
tion of genius, firmness end wisdom. If 1  
represent the Governour’s expressions in  
stronger terms than those he used, T request  
him to correct them. ,  
In England, I know the Anti-Jacebin Jour­  
nal abused us, and so-did M’Donaldy€obbett,  
Smith, and eve% Briton in Europe and A«  
merica, who wished us at war with France,  
and in alliance with England.. But even in |  
England ali the sober pant of the nation ape  
plauded us, and that to such a degree, that it  
soon became the popular cry, ¢« We must im­  
itate the United States of Amcrica, change  
our ministers, and make peace.” Accord­  
ingly they did soon change their ministers  
and make peace at Amiens.  
  
Mr. Liston, whose character I respect, had  
run through a long course of diplomatick ex­  
perience in various courts and countries in  
Europe, from a secretary of legation and  
charge des affuires, (0 the grade of minister  
plenipotentiary, und thence to that of ambas­  
sadour at Constantinople, was probably a Let -  
ter judge than Mr. Hamilton, who hid no  
experience at all in any diplomustick station,  
and who, I dare to say, had read very little on  
the subject of diplomatick functions, and still  
lcss of the Listory of embassies or of the prin­  
ted despatches of ambassadours. My. Liston,  
if any body, knew what would procure honour  
to a nation or government, and what disgrace :  
what would raise the dignity, or what depress  
it : what was triumph, and what humiliation.  
Now 1 affirm, that the first time Mr. Lis­  
ton saw me after he had been informed of  
the communications of the French Directo­  
ry, through Talleyrand, Mr. Pichon and Mr.  
Murray, he said to me thesc words— 7%  
what humiliations will not these Frenchmen  
stoofyy to apprease you ? lam very sorry for  
it : I own, I did hope they would have gone to  
war with you.”” I smiled, ULut made no an­  
swer. I wanted no proof of the sincerity of  
this declaration. I gonbwd not the sincerity  
of his wish, more than I did that of Mr. Can­  
ning and his associates in the Anti-Jacobin,  
who, upon receiving the news of Mr. Mur­  
rays’s nomination, proclaimed that jacobinism  
was triumphant and carrying all before it in  
America. They could wot, or would not,  
distinguish between jacobinism and neutrali­  
ty. Lvery thing wit‘ them was .ﬁﬂ‘&quot;“&quot;&#x27;  
except a war with Franec and an e with  
Great Britain, They all panted for a war be­  
tween the United States and France as sin­  
cerely, though not so ardently, as ArLexax­  
pErß HaMILTON.  
  
[3m.]  
  
There were not wanting insinuations and  
instigations to me, to confer with Mr. Liston  
on the subject of an alliance with Grest Bri­  
tain. And Mr. L. himself repeatedly sug­  
gested to me, in very modest and delicate  
terms, however, his readipess to enter o  
any explanations on that head, 1 always  
waved it with as easy a politencss as I could.  
But my system \u;rcrmimd, and kad been  
so for more thun twenty ycars, that is to enter  
into ne diliance with abv power in Europé.  
In case of war with England, I would not en­  
ter into any alliance with France. In case of  
war whh France, I wonld not form any alli­  
ance with England. We want no auliiunce :  
we are equal to all our own negessary wais.  
“ Aom tali euzilio wec defensoribus jetis,  
tempins eget.,” We angbt aid and be aided  
by a power at war with our enemny, and might  
congert operations Irp? um(:h p:u_xc ;3 bur 1

our hinds from muking peace whenever we  
Ppleased. Had the &#x27;war with France cowtinu­  
ed, 1 might have been drawn by the foree of  
gubllck opinien, or the influence of the legis­  
ture, into an allisnce with Englend § but it  
‘would have been ugainst my oWn judgeimhent  
  
Let me conclude the letter with an anec­  
ddte. Dr. Franklin told me, that before his  
return to Aserica from England, in 1773, he  
was in company, I believe at Lord Spencer’s,  
with a number of English noblemen, when  
the conversation turned upon fubles, those of  
XLsop, La Fontaine, Giay, Moore, &amp;o. &amp;ec.  
Some one of the company cobserved that he  
thought the subject was exhausted. He @id  
not-believe that sy man could now find an  
animaly- beast, bird, or fish; thut ‘e could  
mﬂ :lb a new fable with any success ; and  
w ocomm»appeud‘!ow ud the  
“gamivtagy mertedon his opinicn: 3o wids  
‘ W‘ ’ Q o 0« Q‘N‘d,‘  
with subimission tg their lordships, he beliey­  
ed the subject wis inexhaustible; wnd that  
many new ¢.d instructive fubles might} be  
made out of such myserisls. * Cunr sou think  
of one at present ! If your lordship will fur­  
nish me a pen, ink and paper, I believe | can  
furnish _lOur lordship with one in &amp; few min­  
utes. The paper was brought, und he sat  
down and wrote : |  
“Once upon a time, gn cagle scaling round  
a farmer’s barn, and espying a hare, darted;  
down upon him like a sun beam, seized him  
in his claws, and re-mounted with him inthe  
air. He&#x27;soon found that he had a creature of  
more courage and strength than a hare, for  
which,--no&#x27;.\ﬁ:hnmding‘ the keeuness of his  
eye-sight, he had mistakén a cat. The snarl­  
ing and scrabbling of the prey wad very in­  
coﬁnmcnt, and what was worsc, she had dis­  
engaged herself from his talons, yresped his  
b?ly with her four limbs, so us to stop his  
breath, and seized fast hold of his throat with  
her teeth, Pray, suid the elple, letigo your  
hold and I will release you. Very fine, sakd  
the cat, I have no funcy to fall from this  
height and be crushed to deathr. *You have  
taken me upy, and you shall stoop end let  
pe down. The eagle thought it necessary to  
stoop accordingly. The moral was so appli­  
cable to England and Ame: ica, that the fuble  
was allowed to be original ancdrhighly applaud- i  
ed.  
  
Let Haminton say what he will, the  
French Directory Gmnd it conyvenient to stoop:  
and set us down oft our honest ground of neu­  
trality and imparticlity, as the English cagle -  
did formerly, and now does a second time.

pendence of America were excellently well illustrated or  
foreshadowed by Franklin in a fable improvised at a dinner-  
table, shortly before the ending of his ten years’ life in  
London. “ Once upon a time,” he said, “ an eagle scaling  
“ round a fanner’s barn and espying a hare, darted down  
“upon him like a sunbeam, seized him-in his claws, and  
“ remounted with him to the air. He soon found that he  
“ had B creature of more courage and strength than a hare;  
  
for which, notwithstanding keenness of his eyesight.  
  
“ he had mistaken a cat. The snarling and scrambling of  
“ his prey were very inconvenient, and, what was worse,  
  
“ she had disengaged herself from his talons, graspol his  
“ body with her four limbs, so as to stop bis breath, and  
“ acized fast hold of hia throat with her teeth. ‘ Pray,’  
  
“ said the eagle, ‘ let go your hold and I will release yon.’  
  
“ ‘ Very fine,’ said the cat, ‘ I have no fisnoy to fall firom  
“ &#x27; this height and be crushed to death. You have taken  
“ ‘ me up, and you shall stoop and let me down.’ The

Franklin, “if you will furnish me with  
paper and pencil.”  
  
He immediately sat down and wrote  
the fable of  
  
THE EAGLE AND THE CAT  
  
Once upon a time an eagle, scal-  
ing round a farmer’s barn and  
espying a hare, darted down upon  
him like a sunbeam, seized him in  
his claws and remounted with him  
into the air. He soon found that  
he had a creature of more courage  
and strength than the hare; for  
which he had mistaken a cat. The  
snarling and scrambling of his prey  
were very inconvenient. And what  
was worse, she had disengaged her-  
self from his talons, grasped his  
body with her four limbs, so as to  
stop his breath and seized hold of  
his throat with her teeth.  
  
“Pray,” said the Eagle, ‘‘ let go  
your hold and I will release you.”  
  
‘* Very fine,” said the cat ; ‘‘ but  
I have no fancy to fall from this  
height and to be crushed to death.  
You have taken me up and you  
shall stoop and let me down.”  
  
The Eagle thought it necessary  
to stoop accordingly.

his pen. “ Dr. Franklin told me,” John Adams  
relates, “that before his return to America  
from England, in 1775, he was in company  
  
. with a number of English noblemen,  
when the conversation turned upon fables,  
those of A%sop, La Fontaine, Gay, Moore,  
&amp;c., &amp;c. Some one of the company observed  
that he thought the subject was exhausted.  
He did not believe that any man could now  
find an animal, beast, bird, or fish, that he  
could work into a new fable with any success;  
and the whole company appeared to applaud  
the idea, except Franklin, who was silent.  
The gentleman insisted on his opinion. He  
said, with submission to their lordships, he

that many new and instructive fables might  
be made out of such materials. Can you  
think of any one at present? If your lord-  
ship will furnish me a pen, ink, and paper,  
I believe I can furnish your lordship with one  
in a few minutes. The paper was brought,  
and he sat down and wrote:  
  
“Once upon a time, an eagle scaling round a  
farmer’s barn, and espying a hare, darted down  
upon him like a sunbeam, seized him in his claws,  
and remounted with him in the air. He soon found  
that he had a creature of more courage and  
strength than a hare, for which, notwithstand-  
ing the keenness of his eyesight, he had mistaken  
a cat. The snarling and scrambling of the prey  
was very inconvenient, and, what was worse, she  
had disengaged herself from his talons, grasped  
his body with her four limbs, so as to stop his  
breath, and seized fast hold of his throat with her  
teeth. Pray, said the eagle, let go your hold, and  
I will release you. Very fine, said the cat, I have  
no fancy to fall from this height and be crushed  
to death. You have taken me up, and you shall  
stoop and let me down. The eagle thought it  
necessary to stoop accordingly.  
  
“The moral was so applicable to England  
and America, that the fable was allowed to  
be original, and highly applauded.”
