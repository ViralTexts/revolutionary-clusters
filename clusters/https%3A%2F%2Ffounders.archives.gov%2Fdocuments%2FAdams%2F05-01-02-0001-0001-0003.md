nt of a maxim in Law:  
Q. Is a Brother or sister of the half Blood, in the same Relation with a Brother or sister of the whole Blood? I think not.  
It has been held, that a sister of the half Blood is in equal Degree with a sister of the whole Blood.  
“Every Brother and sister I have living” has been adjudgd to include the half Blood as well as the whole.  
The statute of Jac. 2. enacts that, if after the Death of the Father any of his Children shall die intestate, without Wife or Children, in the Life Time of the mother every Brother and sister and the Representatives of them, shall have an equal share. Now it has been argued that a Brother of the half Blood is a Brother to the Intestate, as well as one of the whole Blood, and therefore should have an equall share.

In determining the character of a condition, whether it is prece-  
dent or subsequent, the question is, whether the conditional event is  
to happen before or after the principal. Here the conditional event  
is the payment to be made on the death of John H. Hillyard, and the  
‘ principal, the payment of the annual premiums as they should be-

is appointed, and that day is to happen subsequently to the perform-  
ance of the thing to be done by the contract in such case, performance  
is a condition precedent, and must be averred in an action for the  
money.” “For,” said the court, “every man’s bargain ought to be

just that he should be left to it according to his agreement ; but on
