cient than these. I shall confine myself to one of these at present, and to save you the trouble of consulting Concordances, will quote Chapter and Verse. Turn then, if you please to the Eleventh chapter of Isaiah and the Sixth Verse, “The Wolf Shall lie down dwell with the lamb, and the Leopard Shall lie down with the Kid and the Calf and the young Lion and the fatling together; and a little Child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed; their young ones Shall lie down together; and the Lion shall eat Straw like the ox. And the Sucking Child shall play on the hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall put his hand on the Cockatrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.” And again in chapter Sixty fifth verse 25. “The Wolf and the Lamb shall feed together and the Lion shall eat straw like the Bullock, and dust shall be the Serpents meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain.”  
I am not about to write a Book upon the Prophecies and therefore will not be more particular. But there are other Prophecies which speak of a time to come when Men shall beat their Swords and into Ploughshares and their Spears into pruning Hooks and learn “War no more.” What may be the meaning of these highly figurative

the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall

official seimon preached in the  
Centenary Hall, Sunday, February 27th,  
1898. SOCIAL UNION. &#x27;The wolf shall  
dwell with the lamb, aud the leopard  
shall lie down with the kid ; and the  
calf and the young lion and the fatling  
together ; and a little child shall lead  
them. And the cow and the bear shall  
feed ; their young ones shall lie down  
together : and the lion shall eat straw  
like the ox. And the sucking child shall  
play on the hole of the asp, and the  
weaned child shall put his hand on the  
cockatrice&#x27;s den. They shall not hurt  
nor destroy in all my holy mountain ;  
for the earth shall be full of the  
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters  
cover the sea.&#x27; — Isaiah -vi. G-0. This

have cherished the hope of some such

religion of the Jew and the religion of  
the Christian contain the same hope. Th
