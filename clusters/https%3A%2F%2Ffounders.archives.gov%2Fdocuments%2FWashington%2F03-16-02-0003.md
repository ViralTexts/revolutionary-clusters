h Town [N.J.] 1st July 1778  
  
I embrace this first moment of leisure, to give Congress a more full and particular  
account of the movements of the Army under my command, since its passing the Delaware,  
than the situation of our Affairs would heretofore permit.  
I had the honor to advise them, that on the appearances of the enemy’s intention to  
march thro’ Jersey becoming serious, I had detatched General Maxwells Brigade, in  
conjunction with the Militia of that State, to interrupt and impede their progress, by  
every obstruction in their power; so as to give time to the Army under my command to  
come up with them, and take advantage of any favorable circumstances that might present  
themselves. The Army having proceeded to Coryell’s  
ferry and crossed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detatched Colo. Morgan with  
a select Corps of 600 Men to reinforce General Maxwell, and marched with the main Body  
towards princetown.  
The slow advance of the Enemy had greatly the air of design, and led me, with others,  
to suspect that General Clinton desirous of a general Action was endeavouring to draw us  
down into the lower Country, in order by a rapid movement to gain our Right, and take  
possession of the strong Grounds above us. This consideration, and to give the troops  
time to repose and refresh themselves from the fatigues they had experienced from rainy  
and excessive hot Weather, determined me to halt at Hopewell Township, about five Miles  
from princetown, where we remained till the Morning of the 25th On the preceding day I  
made a second detatchment of 1500 chosen troops under Brigadier Genl Scott, to reinforce  
th⟨os⟩e already in the vicinity of the Enemy, the more effectually to annoy and delay  
their march. The next day the Army moved to Kingston, and  
having received intelligence that the Enemy were prosecuting their Rout towards Monmouth  
Court House, I dispatched a thousand select men under Brigadier General Wayne, and sent  
the Marquis de la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced Corps, including  
Maxwells Brigade and Morgans light Infantry; with orders to take the first fair  
opportunity of attacking the Enemy’s Rear. In the evening  
of the same day, the whole Army marched from Kingston where our Baggage was left, with  
intention to preserve a proper distance for supporting the advanced Corps, and arrived  
at Cranberry early the next morning. The intense heat of the Weather, and a heavy storm  
unluckily coming on made it impossible to resume  our march that day  
without great inconvenience and injury to the troops. Our advanced Corps being  
differently circumstanced, moved from the position it had held the night before, and  
took post in the evening on the Monmouth Road, about five Miles from the Enemy’s Rear,  
in expectation of attacking them next morning on their march. The main Body having  
remained at Cranberry, the advanced Corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon  
the Right to be supported either in case of an attack upon, or from the Enemy, which  
induced me to send orders to the Marquis to file off by his left towards English  
Town, which he accordingly executed early in the  
Morning of the 27th.  
The Enemy in marching from Allen Town had changed their disposition and placed their  
best troops in the Rear, consisting of all the Grenadiers, Light Infanty, and Chasseurs  
of the line. This alteration made it necessary to increase the number of our advanced  
Corps; in consequence of which I detatched Major General Lee with two Brigades to join  
the Marquis at English Town, on whom of course the command of the whole devolved,  
amounting to about five thousand Men. The main Body  
marched the same day and encamped within three Miles of that place. Morgans Corps was  
left hovering on the Enemy’s right flank, and the Jersey Militia, amounting at this time  
to about 7 or 800 Men under General Dickinson on their left.  
The Enemy were now encamped in a strong position, with their right extending about a  
Mile and an half beyond the Court House, in the parting of the Roads leading to  
Shrewsbury and Middletown, and their left along the Road from Allen Town to Monmouth,  
about three miles on this side the Court House. Their Right flank lay on the skirt of a  
small wood, while their left was secured by a very thick one, a Morass running towards  
their Rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and for a considerable extent  
towards the left with a Morass. In this situation they halted till the morning of the  
28th.  
Matters being thus situated, and having had the best information, that if the Enemy  
were once arrived at the Heights of Middletown, ten or twelve Miles from where they  
were, it would be impossible to attempt any thing against them with a prospect of  
success I determined to attack their Rear the moment they should get in motion from  
their present Ground. I communicated my intention to General Lee, and ordered him to  
make his disposition for the attack, and to keep his Troops constantly lying upon their  
Arms, to be in readiness at the shortest notice. This was  
done with respect to the Troops under my immediate command.  
About five in the Morning General Dickinson sent an Express, informing, that the Front  
of the Enemy had began their march. I instantly  put the Army in  
motion, and sent orders by one of my Aids to General Lee to move on and attack them,  
unless there should be very powerful Reasons to the contrary; acquainting him at the  
same time, that I was marching to support him, and for doing it with the greater  
expedition and convenience, should make the Men disencumber themselves of their packs  
and Blankets.  
After marching about five Miles, to my great surprize and mortification, I met the  
whole advanced Corps retreating, and, as I was told, by General Lee’s orders without  
having made any opposition, except one fire given by a party under the command of Colo.  
Butler, on their being charged by the Enemy’s Cavalry, who were repulsed. I proceeded  
immediately to the Rear of the Corps, which I found closely pressed by the Enemy, and  
gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who by the brave and spirited  
conduct of the Officers, aided by some pieces of well served Artillery, checked the  
Enemy’s advance, and gave time to make a disposition of the left Wing and second line of  
the Army upon an eminence, and in a wood a little in the Rear, covered by a morass in  
front. On this were placed some Batteries of Cannon by Lord Stirling, who commanded the  
left Wing, which played upon the Enemy with great effect, and seconded by parties of  
Infantry detatched to oppose them, effectually put a stop to their advance.  
General Lee being detatched with the advanced Corps, the command of the Right Wing, for  
the occasion, was given to General Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to  
counteract any attempt to turn our Right, I had ordered him to file off by the new  
Church two Miles from English Town, and fall into the Monmouth Road, a small distance in  
the Rear of the Court House, while the rest of the Column moved directly on towards the  
Court House. On intelligence of the Retreat, he marched  
up and took a very advantagious position on the Right.  
The Enemy, by this time, finding themselves warmly opposed in front made an attempt to  
turn our left Flank; but they were bravely repulsed and driven back by detatched parties  
of Infantry. They also made a movement to our Right, with as little success, General  
Greene having advanced a Body of Troops with Artillery to a commanding peice of Ground,  
which not only disappointed their design of turning our Right, but severely enfiladed  
those in front of the left Wing. In addition to this, General Wayne advanced with a Body  
of Troops and kept up so severe and well directed a fire that the Enemy were soon  
compelled to retire behind the defile, where the first stand in the beginning of the  
Action had been made.  
In this situation, the Enemy had both their Flanks secured by thick Woods and Morasses,  
while their front could only be approached thro’ a narrow pass. I resolved nevertheless  
to attack them, and for that purpose  ordered General Poor with his own  
and the Carolina Brigade, to move round upon their Right, and General Woodford upon  
their left, and the Artillery to gall them in front:  
But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was  
dark. They remained upon the Ground, they had been directed to occupy, during the Night,  
with intention to begin the attack early the next morning, and the Army continued lying  
upon their Arms in the Feild of Action, to be in readiness to support them. In the mean  
time the Enemy were employed in removing their wounded, and about 12 OClock at Night  
marched away in such silence, that tho’ General Poor lay extremely near them, they  
effected their Retreat without his Knowledge. They carried off all their wounded except  
four Officers and about Forty privates whose wounds  
were too dangerous to permit their removal.  
The extreme heat of the Weather—the fatigue of the Men from their march thro’ a deep  
sandy Country almost entirely destitute of Water, and the distance the Enemy had gained  
by marching in the Night, made a pursuit impracticable and fruitless. It would have  
answered no valuable purpose, and would have been fatal to numbers of our Men, several  
of whom died the preceding day with Heat.  
Were I to conclude my account of this days transactions without expressing my  
obligations to the Officers of the Army in general, I should do injustice to their  
merit, and violence to my own feelings. They seemed to vie with each other in  
manifesting their Zeal and Bravery. The Catalouge of those who distinguished themselves  
is too long to admit of particularizing individuals: I cannot however forbear mentioning  
Brigadier General Wayne whose good conduct and bravery thro’ the whole action deserves  
particular commendation.  
The Behaviour of the troops in general, after they recovered from the first surprize  
occasioned by the Retreat of the advanced Corps, was such as could not be surpassed.  
All the Artillery both Officers and Men that were engaged, distinguished themselves in  
a remarkable manner.  
Inclosed Congress will be pleased to receive a Return of our killed, wounded and  
missing. Among the first were Lieut. Colo. Bunner of Penna and Major Dickinson of  
Virginia both Officers of distinguished merit and much to be regretted. The Enemy’s slain left on the Feild and buried by us, according  
to the Return of the persons assigned to that duty were four Officers and Two hundred  
and forty five privates. In the former number was the Honble Colo. Monckton. Exclusive of these they buried some themselves, as there were  
several new Graves near the feild of Battle. How many Men they may have had wounded  
cannot be determined; but from the usual proportion the number must have been  
considerable. There were a few prisoners taken.  
  
The peculiar Situation of General Lee at this time, requires that I should say nothing  
of his Conduct. He is now in arrest. The Charges against him, with such Sentence as the  
Court Martial may decree in his Case, shall be transmitted for the approbation or  
disapprobation of Congress as soon as it shall have passed.  
Being fully convinced by the Gentlemen of this Country that the Enemy cannot be hurt or  
injured in their embarkation at Sandy Hook the place to which they are going, and  
unwilling to get too far removed from the North River, I put the Troops in motion early  
this morning and shall proceed that way, leaving the Jersey Brigade, Morgans Corps and  
other light parties (the Militia being all dismissed) to hover about them—countenance  
desertion and to prevent their depredations as far as possible. After they embark, the  
former will take post in the Neighbourhood of Elizabeth Town—The latter rejoin the Corps  
from which they were detatched. I have the Honor to be with the greatest Respect Sir Yr

SIR, Eoglith Town July 1, 1778,  
IEMBRACE this firft moment of leisure  
to give Comgrefs a 2 more full and particular  
account of the movements of the-agmy un­  
der my command, since its pafling the Dela­  
ware, than the situation of our aftairs would  
heretofore permit,  
I had the honor to advise them, that on the  
appearancesof the enemy’s intentionsomarch  
thro, Jersey becoming serious, I had detach­  
ed General Maxwell’s brigade, in conjuaétion  
with the miliiia of that State, to interupt. &amp;  
impede their progress, by every obftru:tion  
in th-ir power, so as to give time to the ar­  
my undsr my command to come up with  
them, and take advantage of any tavourable  
circumstances that might present themselves,  
The army having proceeded to Coryell’s Fer­  
ry, and crofled the Delaware at that place,  
I immediately detachedColonelMorgan,with  
a felet corps of fix huadred men to reinforce  
Gen. Maxwell, and-marched with the main  
&quot; body towards Princeton.  
The flow advance of the enemy had great­  
ly the air of design, and led me, with ethers  
to fufpest that Gen. Clinton, desirous of a  
general action, was endeavouting to dr2w us  
. down into the lower county, in order by a  
. rapid movement to gain ourright, and take  
&quot; pofleflien of the firong grounds above us. This  
consideration, and to give the troops time to  
-repose and refrefh them{elves trom the fa­  
tigues they had experienced from rainy and  
.exceflive hot weather,determined me to halt  
at Hopewell Townthip,about five miles from  
Princeton where he remained till the morn­  
‘ing of the 25th. On the preceeding day I  
made a {econd detachment eof 1500 chosen  
troops, under Brigadier Gen. Scott, to rein­  
‘ferce those 2lready in the vicinity of the e­  
.pemy, the more effectually to arnoy and de­  
“Jdy their march. The nextday rhe army  
~“moved to Kingston, and having received in­  
“telligence that the enemy were prosecuting  
their route towards Monmouth Court house,  
1 dispatched 1000 feleét men-under Biig Gen.  
. Wayne, and sent the Marquis de la Fayette  
“to take thecommand of the whole advanced  
“gorps including Maxwell’s brigade and Mor­  
~ gan’s light infantry, with orders te take the  
firft fair opportunity of attacking the enemy’s  
.rear- In the evening of the {ame day, the  
whole army marshed from Kingston, where  
~eurbaggage was left, with intention to pre­  
~ fetve a proper distance for supporting ‘the  
| eed corps,, and arrived at Cranberry  
_early the next morning.. The intense heat  
of the weather, and a heavy storm unlucki­  
_ ly eoming on, made it impoflible to resume  
ouir march that day without great inconve­  
nience and injury to the troops. Our advanc­  
_ed corps being differently circumfianced,  
‘moved from the position it had held the night  
before, and tock post in the evening on the  
Monmouth road,about § miles from the ene  
my’s rear, in expeltation of attacking them  
nexg morning, oa their march, To the main  
‘body having remained at Cranberry,the ad­  
vanced corps was found to be too remote, &amp;  
too far upon the right, to be fupperted ei­  
ther in case of an attack upon, or from the  
&quot; enemy, which induced me to fend orders to  
the Marquis to file off by his left towards  
~ Englifh-Tbwn,which he accordingly execu­  
ted early in the morning of the 27th,  
The enemy in marching from Allentown  
had changed their disposition, and placed  
  
their best troops in the rear, consisting es all  
the grenadiers, light-infantry,and chaffeurs  
of the line. This alteration made it necet-.  
fary to&#x27;increafe the number of our advanced®  
corps ; in coniequence of which I detached  
Major Gén. Lee with two brigades to joim  
the Marquis at Englith Town, on whom of  
course the command ot the whole devolved.  
amounting to about sooo men. [&#x27;he main  
body marched the fame day and encamped  
within three miles of that place. Morgan’s  
corps was left hovering on the enemyy’s&#x27;right  
flank, and the Jersey militia, amounticg at  
this tie, to about 7 or 800 men under Gen..  
Dickinion, on their left, ,  
The enemy were now encamped in a strong  
position, with their right exiending about a  
mile and a halt beyoud the court house, in  
the parting of the roads leading ta Shrew(-  
bury and Middietown, and their left along  
the road from Ailentown to Monmouth, a­  
bout three miles on this fide the ecurthoufe.  
Their right flank lay on the skirt of 2 {mall  
wood, while their leit was {eeured by a very  
thick one, a 2 morass running towards their  
rear, &amp; their whole front covered by a wood  
and for a considerable extent towards the left  
with 2 morass, In this situation they halted  
til} the morning of the 28th.  
Matters being thus situated, and having  
had the best information, that if the enemy  
were once arrived at the heights ot Middle­  
town, 10 or 12 miles from where they were,  
it would be impossible to attempt any thing  
against them with a prospect of fnccefs, 1  
deteraiined to attack their rear the moment  
they fthould get in motion from their present  
ground. I commeunicated my iatention to  
‘sen. LLee, and ordered him to make his dis­  
position for the attack, &amp; to keep his troops  
constantly lying upon their arme, to be in  
readiness at the shortest notice. This was  
dene with refpeét to the troops under my  
immediate command.  
About 35 in the morning Gen. Dickinson  
sent an express, informing, that the front of  
the enemy had began their march., I in­  
flantly put the army in motion, and sent or­  
ders by one of my Aids to Gen. Lee te move  
on and atiack them, unless there thould be  
very pewerful reasons to the contrary ; ac­  
quainting him at the fame time, that [ was  
marching to support himyand for doing it  
withthe zreater exPeditiorSand convenience  
tho&#x27;d make the men difincumber them{elves  
of their packs and blankets,  
After marching about five miles, to my  
great {urprize and mortification, I met the  
whole advanced cerps retreating, and, as I  
was told, by Gen. Lee’s orders, without ha­  
ving made any oppofition,except one fire gi­  
ven by Col. Butler, on their being charged  
by the enemy’s cavalry, who were repulipd..  
1 proceeded immediately to the rear of the.  
corps, which I found clefely prefled by the  
enemy, and gave direétions for forming part  
of the retreating troops, who, by the brave  
and {pirited conduét of the officers, aided by  
some pieces of well served artillery, checked  
the ememy’s advance, and gave time to make  
a disposition of the left wing &amp; second line  
of the army upon an eminence, &amp; in a 2 wcod  
a little in the rear, covered by a morass in  
front. On this were placed some batteries  
of cannon by Lord Stirling, who command­  
ed the left wing,which played upon the ene­  
my with great effeét,and seconded by parties  
of infantry, detached to oppose them, effec­  
tually put a stop to their advance. ;  
Gen. Lee being detached with the advan­  
ced corps, the command of the right wing,  
for the oceafion, was, given to Gen. Green.  
—-For the expedition of the marchk, and to  
counteraét any attempt to turn eur right, I  
had ordered bim to file off by the new church  
two miles from Englith-Town, and fallin­  
to the Monmouth road, a finall distance in  
the rear of the court-house, while the rest of  
the column moved direétly on towards the  
court house. On intelligence of the retreat  
he marched up, and took a very advantage­  
ous position on the right. ,  
The enemy, by this time finding them­  
felvas warmly opposed in front, made an at­  
  
tempt to turn eur left lank, but they were  
bravely repulsed and driven back by def:ch­  
ed parties of infantry, They z2lic made a  
movement to our right, with alittle lucceis,  
Gen. Green having advanced a body of tio: ps  
with artiliery, to a commanding piace of  
ground, which not only difappoiated tbeir  
design of turning our right, but severely en­  
filated those in sront of the lert wing. In  
addition tc this Gen. Wayne advanced with  
a body of trocps, and kept vp 10 icvere and  
well directed a five, that the enemy were soon  
compeiled to retire behind the detile, where  
the nrit stand in the begining es the action  
kad been made.  
In this situation, the enemy had both their  
flanks secured by thick woods and morafies,  
while their front could only be approached  
thro’ a marrow pa‘s. Irefolved neverthelels  
to attack themand for that purp-ie, order­  
ed Gen. Poor with his own&#x27;and the Carclina  
brigade, to move round upon theirright,and  
Gen. Woodtord upon theywr let, and the ar­  
tillery to gall them in front; but the impedi­  
ment in their way prevented their gettinrg  
within reach before it was dark. Theyre­  
mained vpon the ground they had been di­  
rected to cccupy during the night, with in­  
tention o begin the atiaek early the ncxt  
morning, and the army continued lying up­  
on their arms in the field of z2¢uion, to be in  
readiness todubport them. Inthemeantime  
the enemy we.¢ cii:ployed in removing their  
wounded, and about tweive o’clock at night  
marched away in such filence,ibat,tho’Gen.  
Poor lay extremely near them, they effelted  
their retreat without his knowledge. They  
carried off all their wouided, except 4 offi­  
cers aid about forty privaies,whofe wounds  
were too dangercals to permit their removal.  
* T heextreme heat vt rhe weatiber—the fa­  
tigue of the men from their march through  
2 deep sandy country, almost entirely desti­  
tute of water—and the diffance ihe enemy  
Pad gained by marching the night, made a  
pursuit impracticable and truitlcts. It would  
have been fatal to numbers ot &lt;ur men, se­  
veral of whom died the preceeding right  
with heat.  
Wete I to conclude my acgount of this  
day’s transactions withou&#x27; cxprefiing my o­  
biigations to the officers ot the ammy in gg­  
neral I thould d= injufiice to their merit and  
violence toc my own feclings. They seemed  
to vie with each other in manifefling their  
zeal and bravery.—The catalogue of those  
who diftir.guifhed themselves is 00 lci g to  
admit of pariiculisrifing individuale.— 1  
cannot, however toibear mentioning Briga­  
dier General Wayne, whose good conduct  
and bravery, through the whole action, de­  
ierves particuliar commendation,  
The behavionr ot the trac)s in general af­  
ter they recovered trom the firft furprife,oc­  
cafioned by the retreat of the advanced corps  
was such as eould not be furpafied.  
All the artillery, both officers and men,  
that were engaged, diftinguithed theinielves  
in a remarkable manner, -  
Inclofed Congress will be pleased to receive  
a return of killed, wounded and miffing : A­  
mong the firft were Lieut. Col. Bonner of  
Pennsylvania and Major Dickinson of Vir­  
ginia, both cflicers of diftinguithed merii ard  
much to be regretted. The enemy’s {lain  
left on the field 2and buryed by wus according  
to the return of 15e persons afligned to Ihat  
duty, were four oflficers and two hundred &amp;  
forty five privates ; —in {R¢ former number  
was Hon. Col. Monckton. Exclusive of these  
they buried some themselves, asthere were  
several new graves near the ficld of baitle.  
How many men they may have had woeund­  
ed cznnot be determined, but from she viaal  
proportion of the pumber must have beeu  
contiderable,there was a few prifonerstzken,  
The peculiar situation of Gen. Lee.at this  
time, requires that 1 thould fay mothing of  
bis conduct. He.is now in arrest. The  
charges against him, with such sentence as  
‘the Court Martial may degree in bis cale,  
shall be transmitted for the approbation or  
disapprobation of Congrefs,as feon as it fhail

I EMBRACE this firfl moment of ieifure to give Congrefs a  
more full aod particular account of the movements of the ar­  
ny coder my command, ncce its pafling the Delaware, than the  
fituation of our affairs would ncreofore permit.  
I had the honour to advife them, that on the appearances of  
the enemy&#x27; intention to march through Jerfey becoming ferious,  
I had detached general Maxwell&#x27;s brigade, in cohjsnciion wicn  
the militia of that Hate, to interrupt and impede their progrefs by  
ever oWtraftion in their power, fo as to give time to tne army  
nnder my command to come up with them, and take advantage  
of any favourable c&#x27;ucu alliances that might prefent tnemfelves. .  
The army having proceeded to Cotyeli&#x27;a terry, aod crofled the  
Delaware at that place, I immediately dejacbed Col. M organ,  
with a fdea corps of fix hundred men, to reinforce General  
Maxwell, and marched with the main body toward Prince-  
  
The flow advance of the enemy had greatly the air of defign,  
and led me, with others, to fufpect that general Clinton, deur­  
ocs of a general aclion, was endeavouring to draw us don into  
the lower country, in order, by a rapid movement, to gain our  
right, and take pofieffion of the ftrong grouncsabove us. Tins  
ccnli deration, and to give the troops time to rpoHs and refreih  
therafelves frcm the fatigues they bad experienced rrora rainy and  
excelfive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hopewell town­  
ihin, above five miles from Princeton, where we remained till  
the morning of the 25th. On the preceding da I ciade a f­  
cond detachment of 1500 chofen troops, under Brigadier Gene­  
ral Scott, to reinforce thole already in the vicinity of the enemy,  
the more effectually to annoy and delay their march. The next  
day tbe army moved to Kingfton, and having received intelli­  
gence tlaat the enemy were profecuting their route towards Mjn­  
mouth eourt boofe, I dilpatcr.ed a thoufand felefcr, men under ge­

Englifbtown, Fuly 1, 1778.  
Embrace this firft moment of leifure  
to give Congrefs a more full and  
particular account of the movements of  
‘the army under my command, fince its  
pafling the Delaware, than the fituation  
of our affairs would heretofore permit.  
T had the honour to advife them, that  
p appearance of the enemy’s in-  
ion to march through Jeriey be-  
coming ferious, I had detached Gen.  
Maxwell&#x27;s brigade, in conjunétion  
‘with the militia of that ftate, to inter-  
cept and impede their progref%, by every  
obitruétion in theirpower, fo as to give  
time to the army under my command  
to come up with them, and take advan-  
tage of any favourable circumftances  
that might prefent themfelves. The  
army having proceeded to Coryell’s  
Ferry, and croffed the Delaware at  
thar place, I immediately detached  
Col. Morgan, with a feleét corps of  
‘600 men, to reinfore Gen. Maxwell,  
and marched with the main Body to-  
‘wards Princetown.  
The Qow advance of the enemy had  
greatly the air of defign, and led me,  
  
with others, to fufpeét that Gen. Climt~  
ton, défirous of a general action, was  
endeavouring to draw us down into  
the lower country, in order, by a rapid  
movement, to gain our right, and take  
poffeffion of the itrong grounds above  
us. This confideration, and to give  
the troops time to repofe and refrefh  
themfelves from the fatigues they had  
experienced from rainy and exceffive  
hot weather, determined me to halt at  
Hopewell Townfhip, about five miles  
from Princetown, where we remained  
till the morning of the agth. On the  
preceding day I made a fecond detach-  
ment of 1500 cholen troops, under  
Brigadier Gen. Scott, to reinforce thofe  
already in the vicinity of the enemy,  
the more effetually to annoy and de-  
Jay their march. The next day the  
army moved to Kingfton; and, having  
received intelligence that the enemy  
were profecuting their route towards  
Monmouth Court-Houfe, I difpatched  
rooo feleét men under Brigadier-Gen.  
Wayne, and fent the Marquis de Ia  
Fayette to take the command of the  
whole advanced corps, including Max-  
well’s brigade and Morgan’s light in-  
fantry, with orders to take the firft  
fair opportunity of attacking the ene-  
mvy’s rear. In the evening of the fame  
day, the whole army marched from  
Kington, where our baggage was left,  
with intention to preferve a proper dif-  
tance for fupporting the advanced corps,  
and arrived at Cranbury early the next  
morning. The intenfe heat of the  
we ather, and a heavy ftorm unluckily  
coming on, made it impoffible tg re-  
fume our march that day without great  
inconvenience and i injury to the troops.  
Our advanced corps, being differently  
circumitanced, moved from the pofition  
it had held the night before, and took  
poit in the evening on the Monmouth  
road, about five miles from the enemy’s  
rear, in expectation of attacking them  
next morning on their march. The  
main body having remained at Cran-  
bury, the advanced corps was found  
to be too remote, and too far upon the  
right to be fupported, either in cafe of  
an attack upon or from the enemy,  
which induced me to fend orders to the  
Marquis to file off by his left towards  
Englithtown, which he accordingly  
executed early in the morning of the  
27th.  
  
The enemy marching from Allen-  
town had changed their difpofition,  
and placed their beft troops in the rear,  
coniiting of all the eiehadiaes, light  
infantry, and Chaffeurs of the line,

American Account of the Battle in the Jerleys.  
  
‘This alteration made it neceffary to in-  
creafe the number of our advanced  
corps ; in confequence of which I de-  
tached Major-General Lee, with two  
brigades, to join the Marquis at Eng-  
lithtown, on whom of courfe the com-  
mand of the whole devolved, amount-  
ing to about sooo men. The main  
body marched the fame day, and en-  
camped within three miles of that  
place. Morgan’s corps was left ho-  
vering on the enemy’s right flank ; and  
the Jerfey militia, amounting at this  
time to about 7 or 800 men, under  
Gen. Dickenfon, on their left.  
  
The enemy were now encamped in a  
frong pofition, with their right ex-  
tending about a mile and a half be-  
yond the Court-Houfe, in the parting  
of the roads leading to Shrewfbury  
and Middletown, and their left along  
the road from Allentown to Mon-  
mouth, about three miles on this fide  
the Court-Howle. Their right flank  
lay on the ficirt of a fmall wood, whiie  
their left was fecured by a very thick  
one, a morafs running towards their  
rear, and their whole front covered by  
a wood, and for a confiderable extent  
towards the left with a morafs. In  
this fituation they halted till the morn-  
ing of the 28th.  
  
Matters being thus fituated, and  
having had the beft information, that,  
if the enemy were once arrived at the  
heights of Middletown, ten or twelve  
miles from where they were, it would  
be impoffible to attempt any thing  
againft them with a profpect of fuccefs,  
I determined to attempt the rear the  
moment they fhould get in motion  
from their prefent ground. I commu-  
nicated my intention to Gen. Lee, and  
ordered him to make his difpofition for  
the attack, and to keep his troops con-  
ftantly lying upon their arms, to be in  
readinefs, at the fhortett notice. This  
was done with refpeét to the troops  
under my immediate command.  
  
About five in the morning General  
Dickenfon fent an exprefs, informing,  
that the front of the enemy had began  
their march. I inftantly put the army  
in motion, and fent orders by one of  
my Aid-de-camps to Gen. Lee to move  
on and attack them, unlefs there fhould  
be very powerful reafons to the con-  
trary; acquainting him, at the fame  
time, that I was marching to fuppert  
him, and, for doing it with the greater  
expedition and convenience, fhould  
make the men difencumber themfelves  
ef their packs and blankets,  
  
After snarching akout five miles, to  
  
429  
my great furprize and mortification, I  
met the whole advanced corps retreat-  
ing, and, as I was told, by Gen. Lee’s  
orders, without having made any op-  
pofition, except one fire given by the  
party under the command of Colonel  
Butler, on their being charged by the  
enemy’s cavalry, who were repulfed.  
I proceeded immediately to the rear of  
the corps, which I found clotely prefled  
by the enemy, and gave dueétions for  
forming part of the retreating troops,  
who, by the brave and {pirited conduc  
of the officers, aided by fome pieces of  
well-ferved artillery, checked the ene-  
my&#x27;s advance, and gave time to make  
a difpofition of the left wing and {e-  
cond line of the army upon an emi-  
nence, and in a wood a. little in the  
rear, covered by a morafs in front.  
On this were placed fome batteries of  
cannon by Lord Stir.ing, who com-+  
manded the left wing, which played  
upon the enemy with great effeét, and,  
feconded by parties of infantry, de-  
tached to oppofe them, effeétually put  
a flop to their advance.  
  
Gen. Lee being detached with the  
advanced: corps, the command of the  
right wing for the occafion was given  
to Gen. Green. For the expedition of  
the march, and to counteraét any at-  
tempt to turn our right, I had ordered  
him to file off by the New Church, two  
miles from Englifhtown, and fall inte  
the Monmouth road, a finall diftance in  
the rear of the Court-Houfe, while the  
ret of the column moved directly on  
towards the Court-Houfe, ~ On intel-  
ligence of the retreat, he marched up,  
and took a very advantageous pofition  
on the right.  
  
The enemy, by this time, finding  
themfelves warmly oppofed in front,  
made an attempt to turn our Jeft flanks,  
but they were bravely repulfed and  
driven back by detached parties of in-  
fantry. gT hey alfo made a movement  
to our right, with as little fuccefs ;  
Gen. Green having advanced a body of  
troops, with artillery, toacommanding  
piece of ground, which not only difap-  
pointed their defigns of turning our  
right, but feverely enfiladed thofe ia  
front of the left wing. In addition to  
this, General Wayne advanced with a  
body of troops, and kept up fo fevere  
and well-direéted a fire, that the enemy  
were foon compelled to retire behind  
the defile, where the firtt ftand in the  
beginning of the action had been made.  
  
In this fituation the enemy had both  
their flanks fecured by the woods and  
morafigs, while their front could only  
  
™ be  
  
  
  
  
  
220  
be approached through a narrow pafs.  
I refolved, neverthelets, to attack them;  
and for that purpofe ordered Gen. Poor,  
with his own and the Carolina bri-  
gade to move round upon their right,  
and Gen. Woodford upon their left,  
and the artillery to gall them in front:  
but the impediment in their way pre-  
vented their getting within reach be-  
fore it was dark. They remained upon  
the ground they had been direéted to  
occupy during the night, with inten-  
tion to begin the attack early in the  
morning ; and the army continued ly-  
ing upon their arms in the field of  
aétion, to be in readinefs to fupport  
them. In the mean time the enemy  
were employed in removing their  
wounded, and about twelve o&#x27;clock  
at night marched away in fuch filence,  
that, tho’ Gen. Poor Jay fo extremely  
near them, they effected their retreat  
without, his knowledge. They car-  
ried off all their wounded, except afew  
whole wounds were too dangerous to  
admit removal.  
  
The extreme heat of the weather,  
the fatigue of the men from their  
march through a deep fandy country,  
almoft entirely deftitute of water, and  
the diftance the enemy had gained by  
marching in the night, made a purfuit  
impraéticable and fruitle(s, and would  
have been fatal to numbers of our men,  
feveral of whom died the preceding day  
with heat.  
  
Were I to eonclude my account of  
this day’s tranfaction, without expreff-  
ing my obligations to the cfficers of  
the army in general, I thou!d do in-  
juftice to their merit, and violence to  
my own feelings. They feemed to  
vie with each other in manifefting their  
  
_ zeal and bravery. The catalozue of  
thofe who diftinguifhed themfelves is  
too long to admit of particularizing  
individuals. I cannot, however, for-  
bear mentioning Brigadier-General  
Wayne, whofe good conduét and bra-  
very, through the whole aétion. deferves  
particular commendation. The beha-  
viour of the troops in general, after  
they recovered from the firft furprize,  
occafioned by the retreat of the advanced  
corps, was fuch as could not be furpafied.  
  
All the artillery, both officers and  
men, that were engaged, diftinguithed  
themfelves in a remarkable manner.  
  
Inclofed, Congrefs w&#x27;l! he pleated to  
receivea return of our killed, wounded,  
  
and miffing ; among the firft were Lt.  
  
Col. Bonner, of Pennfylvania, and Ma-  
jor Dickenfon, of Virginia, both off-  
cers of diftinguifhed mezit, and much  
te be regretted,  
  
_ American Account of the Battle in the Jerfeys.  
  
The enemy’s flain left on the field  
and buried by us, according to the re-  
turn of the perfons affigned to that  
duty, were four officers, and 245 pri-  
vates; in the former number was the  
  
Hon. Col. Monckton. Exclufive of  
thefe, they buried fome themfelves, as  
there were feveral new graves near the  
field of battle. How many men they  
have wounded cannot be determined ;  
but, from the ufual proportion, the  
number muft have been confiderable.  
  
There were a few prifoners taken.  
The peculiar fituation of Gen. Lee  
  
at this time requires that I fhould fay  
  
nothing of hisconduét. He is now in  
arreft. Thecharges againft him, with  
fuch fentence as the Court-martial may  
decree in his cafe, fhail be tranfmitted  
for the approbation or difapprobation of  
  
Congrefs, as foon as it fall be paffed.  
Being fully convinced by the gen-  
  
tlemen of this country, that the enemy  
  
cannot be hurt or injured in their em-  
barkation at Sandy-Hook, the place to  
which they are going, and unwilling  
to get too far removed from the North-  
  
River, I put the troops in motion early  
  
this morning, and fhall proceed that  
  
way, leaving the Jerfey brigade, Mor-  
gan’s corps, and other light parties,  
  
(the militia being all difmiffed, ) to ho-  
  
ver about them, countenance defertion,  
  
and prevent their depredations as far  
as poffible.  
former will take poft in the neighbour-  
hood of Elifabeth-Town—the latter  
rejoin the corps from which they were  
detached.  
I have the honour to be,  
With the greateft refpeé, Sir,  
Your moft obedient fervant,

Lieutenant colone! Ramsay, the commander ot  
one of them, was wounded and taken prisoner.  
General Lee continued till the last on the field of  
battle, and brought off the rear of the retreating  
troops.  
  
The check the British received, gave time to  
make a disposition of the left wing, and second  
line of the American army in the wood, and on  
the eminence to which Lee was retreating. On  
this, some cannon were placed by lord Sterling,  
who commanded the left wing, which, with the  
co-operation of some parties of infantry, effectu-  
ally stopped the advance of the British in that  
quarter. Gen. Green took a very advantageous  
position, on the right of lord Sterling. The Bri-  
tish attempted to tura the Icft flank of the Amer-  
icans, but were repulsed. They also made a  
movement tothe right, with as little success,  
for Greene with the artillery disappointed their  
design. Wayne advanced with a body of troops,  
and kept up so severe and well directed a fire,  
that the British were soon compelled to give  
way. They retired and took the position which  
Washington resolved  
to attack them, and ordered general Poor to  
move round upon their right, and general Wood-  
ford to their left; but they could not get within  
reach before it was dark. These remained on  
  
cupy during the night, with an intention of at-  
tacking early next morning, and the main bod)  
lay on their arms in the field to be ready for sup-  
orting them. General Washington reposed  
\imself in his cloak, under a tree, in hopes of re-  
newing the action next day. But these hopes  
were frustrated. The British troops marched a-

it being a copy of a supplement of the New  
Jersey Gazette, dated July 1st, 1778, which  
contains the letter or report of General  
Washington to Congress of the battlo  
of Monmouth. The letter was written  
from Englishtown, and gives full par­  
ticulars concerning the situation of tho  
troops and plans of operation which ha  
was adopting. He says the enemy was  
about moving through Jersey, and its vis­  
its would be serious. He detached Gener­  
al Maxwell’s brigade, in conjunction with  
the militia there was in the State, to annoy  
and impede the enemy’s progress, so as to  
give time for the Continental army to pre­  
pare to meet them. The enemy having  
crossed Coryell’s Ferry, lie sent Colonel  
Morgan with 600 men to reinforco General  
Maxwell, and marched with the main par­  
  
ty towards Princeton. Tlia slowness with  
which the enemy’s army was moving prompt­  
ed General Washington to think that Gen­  
eral Clinton wished to draw his troops in  
lower country, and then make a rush upon  
them, in order to give strongholds &#x27; above  
us nnd thus be possessed with our right.  
Owing to this consideration, nnd also to  
the want of rest, it having been excessively  
hot and rainy weather during their march,  
ho determined to halt at Ilopeville town­  
ship, about five miles from Princeton,  
where they remained until the 25th of June.  
On the 24th he sent another detachment  
of 1500 chosen troops under command of  
General Scott, to join those who were in  
the vicinity of the enemy, engaged in im­  
peding them as much as possible in their  
march. On the following day the army  
moved to Kingston, and on learning that  
the enemy was prosecuting their route  
through to Monmouth Court House, he  
despatched 1000 select men under Briga­  
dier General Wayne, nnd Lieut, Marquis  
De LaFayette to take charge of the entire  
advanced corps, including Maxwell’s and  
Morgan’s men. In the evening of the 25th  
the army moved from Kingston, leaving their  
baggage. They designed to keep such a  
distance that would enable them to sup­  
port the advanced corps. They arrived  
at Cranbury early the next morning. Ow­  
ing to a heavy storm and the intenso heat,  
the march was not resumed that day, hut  
tlia advanced troops being differently cir­  
cumstanced moved from their post where  
1 hey had been the previous night, to the  
Monmouth road, about five miles from the  
enemy’s rear, in anticipation of attacking  
them in the morning on their march. The  
main army being at Cranburv, it was  
  
mougnc too remote a place to support tlie  
advanced corps, so Washington ordered  
LaFayette to file off to his left toward  
Englishtown, which he did on the morning  
of the 27th. The enemy changed their  
tactics after they left Allentown,and placed  
their best men on the rear, this, of course  
necessitated alteration oil the psrt of  
troops. Washington sent General Lee  
with two brigades to join LaFayette at  
Englishtown. The former was to have en­  
tire command, amounting to about 5000  
men. The main army now marched with­  
in three miles of Englishtown. Morgan’s  
troops were left hovering over the enemy’s  
right flanks while the Jersey Militia,under  
General Dickenson, with about 800 men,  
were stationed on their left.  
The visitation of the enemy’s encamp­  
ment was certainly a very strong one.  
Their right extending about a mile and a  
qalf from Freehold, in the parting of the  
road running to Shrewsbury and Middle­  
town, while their left extended along the  
road from Allentown to Monmouth, about  
three miles towards Englishtown. Their  
right flank lay in the skirt of a small wood,  
while on their left a Tery thick one secured  
them, with a morass running to their rear.  
Their whole front, was covered with a thick !  
woods, with a morass extending a consider­  
able distance toward the left. Washington I  
3aw if the enemy should accomplish the Mid­  
dletown Heights, about two miles from where j  
they were, it w&#x27;ould be impossible for him i  
to engage with any probable sucoess. So j  
he determined to attack the enemy from the j  
rear immmediately, when they commenced  
to move. He communicated his intention  
to General Lee, and desired him to make  
ready for the attack, and to keep his troops  
constantly lying upon their arms to be in j  
readiness at the shortest notice.  
About 5 o’clock the next morning infor­  
mation was brought that the enemy’s army  
was in motion. Washington immediately!  
put his troops on the march, and sent Loo i  
order,by Aid-de-camp to move on to attack |  
the enemy’s rear, and that he would come |  
up to support him. Ho ordered that the j  
men should disencumber themselves of  
their packs and blankets. Affeer Washington !

who, by, the aid of the officers accom­  
plished their end, and they directed such a  
volly on tho enemy as to” check their ad­

corps, General Green had command of our  
right. To prevent any attempt to turn to !

small distance in tho rear of the Court­  
House, while the rest of tho column moved

Englishtown, July 1, 1778.  
Sib:—I embrace this first moment of  
leisure to give Congress a more full and  
particular account of the movements  
of the army under my command, sinco its  
passing the Delaware, than the situation of  
our affairs would heretofore permit.  
I had the honor to advise them, that on  
the appearances of the enemy’s intention  
to march through Jersey becoming serious,  
I had detached General Maxwell’s brigade,  
in conjunction with the&#x27;militia of that State,  
to interrupt and impede their progress, by  
every obstruction in their power, so as to give  
timo to the army under my command to  
come up with them, and take advantage of any  
favorable circumstances that might present  
themselves. The army having proceeded  
to Coryell’s ferry, and crossed the Delaware  
at that, place, I immediately detached Col­  
onel Morgan, with a select corps of 600  
men, to reinforce General Maxwell, and  
marched with themnin body toward Prince­  
ton.  
The slow advance of the enemy had great­  
ly the air of design, and led me, with others,  
to suspect that General Clinton, desirous  
of a general action, endeavoring to draw us  
  
clown into the lower country, in order by a  
rapid movement to gain our right, and take  
possession of the strong grounds above us.  
This consideration, and to give the troops  
time to repose and refresh themselves from  
the fatigues they had experienced from  
rainy and excessive hot weather, determined  
me to halt at Hopewell township, about  
five miles from Princeton, where wo re­  
mained till the morning of the 25tli. On  
the preceding day T made a second detach­  
ment of 1500 chosen troops, under Briga­  
dier-General Scott, to reinforce those al­  
ready in the vicinity of the enemy, the  
more effectually to annoy and delay  
their march. The next day the army  
moved to Kingston; and having received  
intelligence that the enemy were prosecu­  
ting their route toward Monmouth Court­  
house, I dispatched 1000 select men under  
Brigadier-General Wayne, and sent the  
Marquis do la Payette to take the command  
of the whole advance corps, including Max­  
well’s brigade and Morgan’s light infantry,  
with orders to take the first fair opportunv of  
attacking the enemy’s rear. In the even­  
ing of the same day the whole army march­  
ed from Kingston, where our baggage was  
left, with intention to preserve a proper  
distance for supporting the advance corps,  
and arrived at Cranberry early the next  
morning. Theintcnse heat of the weather,  
and a heavy storm unluckily coming on.  
made it impossible to resume onr march  
that day without great inconvenience and  
injury to the troops. Our advanced corps  
being differently circumstanced, moved  
from the position it had held the night be­  
fore, and took post in the evening on the  
Monmouth road, about five miles from the  
enemy’s rear, in expectation of attacking  
them next morning on their march. The  
main body having remained at Cranberry,  
the advanced corps was found to bo too re­  
mote, and too far upon the right, to be  
supported either in case of an attack upon  
or from the enemy, which induced me to  
send orders to tlio Marquis to file off by his  
left towards Englishtown, which he accord­  
ingly executed early in the morning of the  
27th.  
The enemy in marching from Allentown  
had changed their disposition, and placed  
their best troops in the rear, consisting of  
nil the grenadiers, light infantry nnd chas­  
seurs of the line. This alteration made it  
necessary to increase the number of our  
advanced corps; in consequence of which  
I detached Major-General Lee with two  
brigades to join the Marquis at English­  
town, on whom of course tha command of  
the whole devolved, amounting to about  
5000 men. The main body marched the  
same day, and encamped within three miles  
of that place. Morgan’s corps were loft  
hovering on the enemy’s right flank, and  
the Jersey militia, amounting at this time  
i to about 7 or 800 men, under General Diok­  
inson, on their left.  
The enemy were now encamped in a  
strong position, with their right extending  
about a mile and a half beyond the Court­  
house, in the parting of the roads leading  
to Shrewsbury and Middletown, and their  
left along the road from Allentown to Mon­  
mouth, about three miles this side of the  
Conrt-house. Their right flank lay on the  
skirt of a small wood, while their left was  
secured by a very thick one, a morass run­  
ning towards the rear, and their whole  
front covered by a wood, and for a oonsid­  
  
j erable extent towards the left with n morass.  
In this situation they halted till the morn­  
ing of the 28tli.  
Matters being thus situated, and having  
had the best information, that if the ene­  
my were once arrived at the heights of  
Middletown, ten or twelve miles from  
where they were, it would be impossible  
to attempt anything against them with a  
prospect of success, I determined to attack  
their rear the moment they should get in  
motion from their present ground. I com­  
municated my intention to General Lee,  
and ordered him to make his disposition  
for the attack,’ and to keep his troops con­  
stantly lying upon their arms, to be in  
readiness at the shortest notice. This was  
done with respect to the troops under my  
immediate command.  
About five in the morning General Dick­  
inson sent an express, informing that the  
front of the enemy had began their march.  
I instantly put the army in motion, and  
sent orders by; one of my Aids to Gener­  
al Lee to move on and attack them, unless  
there should be very powerful reasons to  
the contrary; acquainting him at the same  
time, that I was marching to support him,  
and for doing it with the greater expedition  
and convenience, should make the men dis­  
encumber themselves of their packs and  
blankets.  
After marching about five miles, to my  
great surprise and mortification, I met the  
whole advanced corps retreating, and, as I  
was told, by General Lee’s orders, without  
having made any opposition, except one  
fire given by the party under the command  
of Col. Buttler, on their being charged by  
the enemy’s cavalry, who were repulsed. I  
proceeded immediately to the rear of the  
corps, which I found closely pressed by the  
enemy, and gave directions for forming  
part of the retreating troops, who, by the  
bravo and spirited conduct of the officers,  
aided by some pieces of well served artillery,  
checked the enemy’s advance, and gave  
time to make a disposition of the left wing  
and second lino of the army upon an emi­  
nence, and in a wood a little in the rear,  
covered by a morass in front. On this were  
placed some batteries of cannon by Lord  
Stirling, who commanded the left wing,  
which played upon the enemy with great  
effect, and seconded by parties of infantry,  
detached to oppose them, effecturdly put a j  
  
scop u&gt; ineir auvauoe.  
General Lee being detached with the ad- |  
vanced corps, the command of the right  
wing, for the occasion, was given to Gener-!  
al Green. For the expedition of the march,  
and to counteract any attempt to turn our  
right, I had ordered him to file off by the I  
new church, two miles from Englislitown,  
and fall into the Monmouth road, a small  
distance in the rear of the Court-house,  
while the rest of the column moved directly  
on towards the Court-house. On intelli­  
gence of the retreat, ho marched up, and  
took a very advantageous position on the  
right.  
The enemy, by this time, finding them­  
selves warmly opposed in front, made an  
attempt to turn our left flank, but they were  
bravely repulsed and driven back by de­  
tached parties of infantry. They also made  
a movement to our right, with as little suc­  
cess, General Green having advanced a  
body of troops, with artillery, to a com­  
manding piece of ground, which not only  
disappointed their design of turning our  
right, but severely enfiladed those in front  
of the left wing. In addition to this, Gen­  
eral Wayne advanced with a body of troops,  
and kept up so severe and well directed a  
fire, that the enemy were soon compelled  
to retire behind the defile, where the first  
stand in the beginning of the action had  
been made.  
In this situation, the enemy had both  
their flanks secured by thick woods and  
morasses, while their front could only be  
approached through a narrow pass. I re­  
solved, nevertheless, to attack them;*and  
for that purpose ordered General Poor, with  
his ow n and the Carolina brigades, to move  
around upon their right, and General Wood­  
ford upon their left, and the artillery to gall  
them in front; but the impediment in their  
way prevented their getting within reach  
before it was dark. They remained upon  
the ground they had been directed to oc­  
cupy during the night, with intention to  
begin the attack early the next morning,  
and the army continued lying upon their  
arms in the field of action, to be in readi­  
ness to snpport them. In the meantime  
the enemy were employed in removing  
their wounded, and about twelve o’clock at  
night marched away in such silence, that,  
though General Poor lay extremely near  
them, they effected their retreat without his  
knowledge. They carried off all their  
wounded, except four officers and about  
forty privates, whose wounds were too dan­  
gerous to permit their removal.  
  
The extreme heat of the weather—the fa­  
tigue of the men from their march through  
a deep sandy country, almost entirely des­  
titute of water—and the distance the enemy  
had gained by marching in the night,  
made a pursuit impracticable and fruitless.  
It would have answered no valuable pur­  
pose, and would have been fatal to num­  
bers of our men, several of whom died the  
preceding day with heat.  
Were I to conclude my account of this  
day’s transactions without expressing my  
obligations to the officers of the army in  
general, I should do injustice to their merit,  
aud violence to my own feelings. They  
seemed to vie with each other in manifest­  
ing their zeal and bravery. The catalogue  
of those who distinguished themselves is too  
long to admit of particularizing individuals.  
I cannot, however, forbear mentioning  
Brigadier-General Wayne, whose good con­  
duct and bravery, through the whole ac­  
tion, deserves particular commendation.  
The bebavion of the troops in general,  
after-they recovered from the first surprise,  
oecasio ed by the retreat of the advanced  
corps, as such as could uot be surpassed.  
All tne artillery, both officers and men,  
that were engaged, distinguished them­  
selves in a remarkable manner.  
Inclosed Congress will be pleased to re­  
ceive a return of our killed, wounded and  
missing. Among tlie first were Lieut. Col.  
Bunuer, of Pennsylvania, and Major Dick­  
inson, of Virginia, both officers of distin­  
guished merit, and much to be regretted.  
The enemy’s slain left on the field and buried  
by us, according to the return of the persons  
assigned to that duty, were four officers and  
two hundred and forty-five privates; in the  
former number was the honorable Col.  
Monckton. Exclusive of these they buried  
some themselves, as there were several new&#x27;  
graves near the field of battle. How many  
men they may have had wounded, cannot  
be determined; but from the usual propor­  
tion, the number must have been consider­  
able—There were a few prisoners taken.  
The peculiar situation of General Lee at  
this time, requires that I should say nothing  
of his conduct. He is now in arrest. The  
charges against him, with such sentence as  
the court-martial may decree in his case,,  
shall be transmitted for the aprobation or  
disaprobation of Congress, as soon as it  
shall be passed.  
Being fully convinced by the gentlemen  
of this country&#x27;, that the enemy cannot be  
hurt or injured in their embarkation at  
Sandy Hook, the place to which they are  
going, and unwilling to get too far removed  
from the North Kiver, I put the troops in  
motion early this morning, and shall pro­  
ceed that way, leaving the Jersey brigade,  
Morgan’s corps, and other light parties  
(the militia being all dismissed) to hover  
about them—countenance desertion, and  
to prevent their depredations as far as pos­  
sible. After they embark, the former will  
take post in the neighborhood of Elizabeth­  
  
town—the latter rejoin the corps from which  
they were detached.  
I have the honor to be with the great­  
est respect, Sir, your most obedient ser­  
vant, G. Washington

onor to be. &amp;c. G. W.  
LnglUshtoum, July 1, 1778.  
Sir :—I embrace the first moment of  
leisure to give Congress a more full and  
particular account of the movements of  
the army under my command since its  
passing the Delaware, than the situation  
of our affairs would heretofore permit.  
I had the honor to advise them, that,  
on the appearances of the enemy&#x27;s inten­  
tion to march through Jersey becoming  
serious, I had detached General Maxwell’s  
brigade in conjunction with the militia of  
that state to interrupt and im|)ede their  
progress by every obstruction in their  
power, so as to give time to the army  
under my command to come up with  
them, and take advantage of any favora­  
ble circumstances that might present  
themselves. The army having proceed­  
ed to Coryel’s ferry, and crossed the Dela­  
ware at that place. 1 immediately  
detached Colonel Morgan with a select  
corps of six hundred men to reinforce  
General Maxwell, and marched with the  
main body toward Princeton.  
The slow advance of the enemy had  
greatly the air of design, and led me­  
with others, to suspect that General Clin­  
ton, desirous of a general action, was en­  
deavouring to draw us down into the  
lower country, in order, by a rapid  
movement, to gain our right, and take  
possession of the strong grounds above  
us.—This Consideration, and to give the  
troops time to repose and refresh them­  
selves from the fatigues they had experi­  
enced from rainy and excessive hot  
weather, determined me to halt at Hope­  
well township, about five miles from  
Princeton, where we remained till the  
morning of the twenty-fifth.  
On the preceding day I made a second  
detachment of fifteen hundred chosen  
troops under Brigadier-General Scott, to  
reinforce those already in the vicinity of  
the enemy, the more effectually to annoy  
and dely their march. The next day the  
army moved to Kingston; and, having  
received intelligence that the enemy were  
prosecuting their route towards Mou­  
mouth Court House, I dispatched a  
thousand select men under Brigadier­  
General Wayne, and sent the Marquis  
De la Fayette to take the command of the  
whole advanced corps, with orders to  
take the first opportunity of attacking  
the enemy’s rear.  
  
in me evening or me same nay, me  
whole army marched from Kingston,  
where our baggage was left, with inten­  
tion to preserve a proper distance for  
supporting the advanced corps, and  
arrived at Cranberry early the next  
morning. The intense heat of the  
weather, and a heavy storm unluckily  
coming on, made it impossible lo resume  
our march that day without great incon­  
venience and injury to the troops. Our  
advanced corps, lieing differently circum­  
stanced, moved from the position it had  
held the night before, and took post in  
tlie evening on the Monmouth road,  
about five miles from the enemy’s iear,  
in expectation of attacking them next  
morning on their march.—The main  
body having remained at Cranberry, the  
advanced corps was found to be too  
remote, and too far u|&gt;on the right, to be  
supported in case of an attack either upon  
or from the enemy ; which induced me  
to send orders to the Marquis to file off  
by his left towards Englishtown. which  
lie accordingly excuted early in the  
morning of the twenty-seventh.  
The enemy, in marching from Allen­  
town, iiad changed their disposition, and  
placed their best troops in the rear, con­  
sisting of all the grenadiers, light infant­  
ry, and chasseurs of the line.—This  
alteration made it necessary to increase  
the number of our advanced-corps; in  
consequence of which I detached Major­  
General Lee with two brigades to join  
the Marquis at Englishtown, on whom of  
course, the command of the whole de­  
volved, amounting tnabout five thousand  
men. The main body marched the same  
day, and encamped within three miles of  
that place. Morgan’s corps was left  
hovering on the enemy’s right Hank;  
and the Jersey militia, amounting at  
this time to about seven or eight hun­  
dred men, under General Dickinson, on  
their left.  
Tlie enemy were now encamped in a  
strong position, with their right extend­  
ing about a mile and a half beyond the  
Court House in the purting of the roads  
leading to Shrewsbury and Middletown,  
and their left along tlie road from Allen­  
town to Monmouth, about three miles oil  
this side the Court House. Their right  
flank lay on tlie skirt of a small wood,  
while their left was secured by a very j  
thick one,—a morass running towards  
their rear, and their who.e front covered J  
by a wood, and, for a considerable extent ]  
towards the the left, with a morass.—In  
this situation they halted till tlie morn­  
ing of the twenty-eighth.  
Matters being thus situated,—and hav­  
ing laid tlie best information, that, if the  
enemy were once arrived at the heights  
of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from  
where they were, it would be impossible  
to attempt anything against them with a  
prospect of success,—I determined to at­  
tack their rear tlie moment they got in  
motion from their present ground. I 1  
communicated my intention to General1  
Lee, and ordered him to make his dis- j  
position for tlie attack, and to keep his I  
troops constantly lying upon their arms  
to be in readiness at the shortest notice, j  
This was done with respect to tlie troops  
under my immediate command.  
About live in tlie morning, Generali  
Dickinson sent an express informing that  
the front of the enemy had begun their  
march. I instantly put tlie army in mo­  
tion. and sent orders by one of my aids to  
General Lee to move on and attack them  
unless there should be very powerful  
reasons to the contrary,—acquainting him  
at tlie same time, that I was marching to j  
support him, and, for doing it with tlie!  
greater expedition mid convenience,&#x27;  
should make tlie men disencumber them­  
selves of tlieir packs and blankets.  
  
After marching about live miles, to my  
great surprise ami mortilication, I met!  
the whole advanced corps retreating,— i  
and, as I was told, by general Lee&#x27;s  
orders,—without having made any op-1  
position, except one lire given by a party  
under the command of Colonel Bottler,  
on their being charged by the enemy&#x27;s I  
cavalry, who were repulsed. I proceeded  
immediately to the rear of the corps,  
which I found closely pressed by the I  
enemy, and gave directions for forming!  
part of the retreating troops, who, by the!  
brave and spirited conduct of the officers, i  
aided by some pieces of well served arti 1- ■  
lery, checked the enemy’s advance and  
gave time to make a disposition of the  
left wing and second line of the army  
upon an eminence, and in a wood a little  
in the r ar, covered by a morass in front.  
On this were placed some batteries of  
  
cannon by Lord Stirling who commanded  
the left wing, which played upon the  
enemy with great ellect. and seconded by  
parties of infantry detached to oppose  
them, effectually put a stop to their ad­  
vance.  
General Lee being detached with the  
advanced corps, the command of the right  
wing for the occasion; was given to Gen­  
end Greene. For the expedition of the  
march, and to counteract any attempt to  
turn our right, I had ordered him to tile  
oft by tlie new church, two miles from  
Kngiishtown, and fall into the Monmouth  
road, a small distance in the rear of the  
Court House, while the rest of the column  
moved directly on towards tlie Court  
House. On intelligence of the retreat, he  
marched up and took a very advantage­  
ous position on the right.  
The enemy, by this time, finding them­  
selves warmly opposed in front, made an  
attempt to turn our left flank; but they  
were bravely repulsed and driven back by  
detached parties of infantry. Also made  
a movement to our right with as little  
snccess, General Greene having advanced  
a body of troops witli artillery to a com­  
manding piece of ground ; which not  
only disapointed their design of right, but  
severely enfiladed those in front of the  
left wing. In addition to this, general  
Wayne advanced with a body of troops,  
and kept up so severe and well-directed  
a lire, that thj enemy were soon com­  
pelled to retire behind the defile where  
tlie first stand in the beginning of the  
action had been made.  
In tliis situation the enemy had both  
their flanks secured by thick woods and  
morasses, while their front could only be  
approached thro’ a narrow pass. I re­  
solved, nevertheless, to attack them : and  
for that purpose ordered General Poor,  
with his own and the Carolina brigade, to  
move around upon their right, and Gen­  
eral Woodford upon their left, and the  
artillery to gall them in front. But the  
impediments in their way prevented  
their getting within reach before it was  
dark. They remained upon i he ground  
they had been directed to occupy during  
the night, with intention to begin the  
attack early the next morning: and the  
army continued lying upon theirarms in  
tlie field of action, to be in readiness to  
support them.  
In tlie mean time tlie enemy were em­  
ployed in removing their wounded, and  
about twelve o’clock at night marched  
away in such silence, that though Gen­  
eral Poor lay extremely near them, they  
effected their retreat without his knowl­  
edge. They carried off all their wounded  
except four officers and forty privates  
whose wounds were too dangerous to per­  
mit their removal.  
The extreme heat of the weather, the  
fatigue of the men from their march  
through a deep sandy country almost  
entirely destitute of water, and the dis­  
tance the enemy had gained by marching  
in the night, made a pursuit impracticable  
and fruitless; it would have answered no  
valuable purpose and would have been  
fatal to numbers of our men, several of  
whom died tlie preceding day with heat.  
Were I to conclude my account of this  
day&#x27;s transactions withoutexpressing my  
obligations to the officers of tlie army in  
  
general, 1 should do injustice to their  
merit and violence to ruy own feelings.  
They seemed to vie with each other in  
manifesting their zeal and bravery. The  
catalogue of those who distinguished  
themselves is too long to admit of par­  
ticularising individuals. I cannot, how­  
ever, forbear mentioning Brigadier Gen­  
eral Wayne, whose good conduct and  
bravery through the whole action de­  
serves particular commendation.  
The behaviour of the troops in general,  
after they recovered from the first sur­  
prise occasioned by the retreat of the ad­  
vanced corps, was such as could not be  
surpassed.—All the artillery, both offi­  
eers and men, that were engaged, dis­  
tinguished themselves in a remarkable  
manner.  
Inclosed, Congress will be pleased to  
receive a return of our killed, wounded,  
and missing. Among the first were Lieu­  
tenant-Colonel Bunner, of Pennsylvania,  
and Major Dickinson, of Virginia, both  
officers of distinguished merit, and much  
to be regretted.—The enemy’s slain, left  
on the field, and buried by us, according  
to the return of the persons assigned to  
that duty, were four officers and two  
hundred and forty-five privates. In the  
former number was the honorable Col­  
onel Monckton. Exclusive ot these, they  
buried some themselves, as there were  
several new graves near the field of bat­  
tle.—How many men they may have  
had wounded, cannot be determined ; but.  
from the usual proportion, the number  
must have been considerable.—There  
were a few prisoners taken.  
The peculiar situation of General Lee  
at this time requires that I should say  
nothing of his conduct. He is niftv in  
arrest. The charges against him. with  
such sentence as the court-martial may  
decree in his case, shall be transmitted  
for the approbation or disapprobation of  
Congress, as soon as it shall be passed.  
Being fully convinced by the gentle­  
men of this country that the enemy can­  
not 1 e hurt or injured in their embark­  
ation at Sandy-Hook. the place to which  
they are going,—and unwilling to get  
too far removed from the North-river,—I  
put the troops in motion early this  
morning, and shall proceed that way,  
leaving the Jersey brigade, Morgan’s  
corps, and other light parties (the mili­  
tia being all dismissed), to hover about  
them, to countenance desertion, and to  
prevent their depredations as far as pos­  
sible.—After they embark, the former  
will take post in the neighborhood of  
Elizabethtown, the latter rejoin the  
corps from which they were detached.
