Dear Sir,  
White plains July 24th 1778.  
  
Whether you are indebted to me, or I to you a Letter I know not, nor is it a matter of  
much moment—The design of this is to touch, cursorily, upon a Subject of very great  
importance to the well being of these States; much more so than will appear at first  
view—I mean the appointment of so many foreigners to Offices of high rank &amp;  
trust in our Service.  
The lavish manner in which Rank has hitherto been bestowed on these Gentlemen, will  
certainly be productive of one, or the other of these two evils, either, to make it  
despicable in the eyes of Europe, or, become a mean of pouring them in upon you like a  
torrent, and adding to your present burthen—but it is neither the  
expence nor trouble of them I most dread—there is an evil more extensive in its nature,  
and fatal in its consequences to be apprehended and that is, the driving all your own  
Officers out of Service, and throwing not only your Arms, but your Military Councils,  
entirely in the hands of Foreigners.  
The Officers my dear Sir on whom you must depend for defence of this cause, and who  
from length of Service—their Connexions—property—and (in behalf of many) I may add,  
military merit, will not submit much, if any longer, to the unnatural promotion of men  
over them, who have nothing more than a little plausability—unbounded pride and  
ambition—and a perseverence in application, which is not to be resi[s]ted but by  
uncommmon firmness, to support their pretensions—Men, who in the first instance tell  
you, that they wish for nothing more than the honour of serving in so glorious a cause,  
as Volunteers—The next day sollicit rank without pay—the day following want money  
advanced them—and in the course of a Week want further promotion, and are not satisfied  
with any thing you can do for them.  
When I speak of Officers not submitting to these appointments, let me be understood to  
mean, that they have no more doubt of their right to resign (when they think themselves  
aggrieved) than they have of a power in Congress to appoint—both being granted then, the  
expediency, &amp; the policy of the measure remain to be considered; &amp;  
whether, it is consistent with justice, or prudence, to promote these military fortune  
hunters at the hazard of your Army. especially as I think they may be denominated into  
three classes—to wit mere adventurers without recommendation, or recommended by persons  
who do not know how else to dispose of, or provide for them. Men of great ambition, who  
would sacrafice every thing to promote their own personal glory—or, mere spies, who are  
sent here to obtain a thorough knowledge of our situation, circumstances &amp;ca; in  
the execution of which, I am perswaded, some of them are faithful emissaries, as I do  
not believe a single matter escapes unnoticed, or unadvised, at a foreign Court.  
I could say a great deal on this subject, but will add no more at present; I am led to  
give you this trouble, at this time, by a very handsome  
certificate shewed me yesterday in favour of Monsr Neville written (I believe) by  
himself, and subscribed by General Parsons. designed, as I am informed, for the  
foundation of the superstructure of a Brigadiership.  
Baron Steuben I now find is also wanting to quit his Inspectorship for a command in the  
line, this will also be productive of much discontent to the Brigadiers. In a word,  
altho I think the Baron an excellent Officer, I do most devoutly wish that we had not a  
single Foreigner among us, except the Marquis de la Fayette, who acts  
upon very different principles than those which govern the rest. adieu. I am most  
sincerely Yrs  
  
Go: Washington  
  
  
P.S. This Letter as you will perceive, is written with the freedom of a friend do not  
therefore make me enemys by publishing what is inte

Dcm- Sir: ? Whether you ar ? indebted to me.  
or i to vou. for a letter I know no&#x27;?nor is it a!  
matter of much mmnciit. The design ol this is  
to touch, f&#x27;u Mi-ily. upon a si-hject ol very great j  
importance to the well-being of these States?!  
much more so th in will appear at tir&gt;t view I,  
mt in the rip oiniuient ot so many foreigners to  
offices of high rank and trust in our service.  
The i jvish manner in which rank lias hitherto  
been bestowed on these gentlemen, wid certainly  
he productive of one or the other of these two  
evils?either to make it despicable in the eyes  
of Europe, or become a menus of pouring them  
in upon u like a torrent, and adding to our pres­  
ent burden. Hut it is neither tire expense tvr  
trouble of them that I&#x27;most dread ?There is an  
&quot;\i! more exte sive in its uatire, and fatal in i s  
?onsequenees. to lie apprehended, a id that is. the  
1 riving of all our own officers out of the service,  
and throwing not only our army, but our military  
councils, entirelv into the hands ol foreigners.  
I he officers, inv dear sir. on whom vou must  
1, &#x27;tend for the defence of this cause, di-tinguish­  
?d&#x27;bv length of service, their c uinexi ?ns, prop- (  
;rtv. ami ,iu behalf ot m my I in iv aid) military I  
merit, will mil submit much, if any, long&#x27;r, to!

have nothing more than a little plausibility, tin­  
rouirleii pride and ambition, and a preseveranee  
;ii application not to lie resisted but by uncommoi)  
ann!i&quot;-s. lo support their pretensions : men who.  
n the tirst instance, tell you they wish lor mi­  
lling more than i!i ? honor of serving in so glo-j

tdvanced to tlieni ; and in the course of a week  
.vaiit further priuti uiou. a ul are not satisfied with  
uiv thing vou can do tor them.  
When I speak of officers not submitting to  
these appointments, hi me be understood to mean  
that they have no more doubt of their right to  
resign,&#x27;when they think themselves aggrieved  
than they have a power in Congress to appoint..  
Hoili being granted, their, the expediency and the

that is the driving of all our own officers out of the  
service, and throwing not only your army but your

ers.  
1 The officers, my dear sir, on whom you must  
depend for the defence of this cause, and who,  
&#x27; from length of service, their connexions, property,  
: and, in Mialf of many, I may add military merit,  
will not submit much, if any, longer to the unnat­  
ural promotion of men over them, who liavc noth­  
ing wort&#x27; than a little plausibility, unliounded pilde  
and ambition, and a perseverance in application not  
to l&gt;c resisted but by uncommon firmness, Ui sup­  
port their pretensions. Men, who, in tho first in­  
stance, tell vou they wish fiir nothing more tlinu  
the honor of serving In so glorious a cause as vol­  
| untcers, the next day solicit rank without pay, the  
dav following want money adviftiecd them ; and hi  
I tho course of a week, want further promotion, and  
are not satisfied with anything you can do 1or thein  
&quot; When I &quot;peak of officers not submitting to Hies t  
i appointments, let me be understood to mean, that,  
they have no more doubt of their right to resign,  
when they think themsclve* aggrieved, than they  
hate of a power in Congress to appoint. B0&#x27;&#x27;1  
being granted, theu, the expediency and policy of

it is consistent with justice or prudence to promo!&quot;  
these military fortune hunters, at the haxard of your  
ariuy. Tlicv may be divided into three classes, v|*:  
men- adventurers without recommendation, or re­  
commended by persona who do not know how eNo  
to dispose of or provide for them; men of g*eat  
ambition, who would sacrifice everything to pro­

Dear Sir:The design of this is to touch  
cursorily upon a subject of very great im­  
portance to the being of these States. I  
mean the appointment of so many foreign­  
ers to offices of high rank and trust in our

has hitherto been bestowed upon these  
gentlemen will certainly be productive of  
one or other of these two evfls, either to  
make us despicable in the eyes of Europe,  
or become a means of pouring them in up­  
on us like a torrent, and adding to our  
present burden.The  
officers on whom you must depend, will not  
submit much, if any longer, to the unnat  
ural promotion of men over them, who  
have nothing more than a little plausibili  
ty and unbounded bride and ambition;  
men, who, in the first instance, tell you

WHITE PLAINS, July 24, 1790.  
  
&quot;Dsak Sib: Whether yon are in­  
debted to me, or I to you, for a letter, I  
know not, nor ia it of much moment;  
the design of this is to touch, cursorily,  
upon a subject of very great importance  
to the well being of these btates; and  
more so than will appear at first view.  
I mean the appointment of so many  
foreigners to offices of high rank and  
trust in our service. The lavish man­  
ner in which rank has hitherto been be­  
stowed on these gentlemen, will certain  
ly be productive of one or the other of  
these two evils either to make it despi­  
cable in the eyes of Europe, or become  
a means of pouring them in upon you  
like a torrent, and adding to your pres­  
ent burden. But it is neither the ex­  
pense nor trouble of them that I most  
dread. There is an evil more extensive  
in its nature, and fatal in its consequen­  
ces, to be apprehended, and that is the  
driving of all our own officers out of  
the scrnce, and throwing not only your  
army but your military councils entirely  
into the hands of foreigners.  
&quot;The officers, my dear sir, on whom  
you must depend for the defence of this  
cause, and who, from length of service,  
their connexions, property, and, in be­  
half of many, . I may add military  
merit, will not submit much, if any,  
longer to the unnatural promotion of  
men orer them, who hare nothing more  
than a little plausibility, unbounded  
pride and ambition, and a perseverance  
in application not to be resisted but by  
uncommon firmness, to support their  
pretensions. Men, who, in the first in­  
stance, tell you they wish for nothing  
more than the honor of serring in so  
glorious a cause as volunteers, the next  
day solicit rank without pay, the day  
following want money advanced them;  
and- in the course of a week, want fur­  
ther promotion, and are not satisfied  
with anything you can do for them.  
&quot;When I speak of officers not sub  
mitting to these appointments, let me be  
understood to mean, that they bare no  
more doubt of their right to resign,  
when they think themselves aggrieved,  
than they have of a power in Congress  
to appoint Both being granted, then,  
the expediency and policy of the meas­  
ure remain to be considered, and whether  
it is consistent with justice or prudence  
to promote these military fortune hun-ters,  
at the hazard of your army. 1  
These may be divided into three classes,  
viz: mere adventurers without recom­  
mendation, or recommended by persons  
who do not know bow else to dispose of  
or provide tor them; men of great am­  
bition, who would sacrifice everything  
to promote their own personal glory; or  
mere spies, who are aent here to obtain  
a thorough knowledge of onr situation  
and circumstances, in the execution of  
which, I am persuaded, some of them  
are faithful emisaries, as I do not be­  
lieve a single matter escapes unnoticed,  
or unadvised at a foreign court  
&quot;I could aay a great deal on this sub  
ject, but will add nothing at present I  
am led to give you this trouble at this  
time, by a very handsome certificate  
showed me yesterday in favor of Mr.  
Neuvile, written (I believe) by himself,  
and subscribed by General Parsons,  
designed, aa I am informed, for a  
foundation of the superstructure of  
brigadiership. Baron Steuben, I now  
find, is also wanting to quit his inspec­  
torship for a command in the line. This  
will m productire of much discontent  
to the brigadiers. In a word, although  
I think the Baron aa excellent officer, I  
do most devoutly wish, that we had  
not a tingle foreigner among ns, except  
we jiarqnis ae jaiayeue, wno acts upon  
very different principles from those  
which govern the rest Adieu.

41 Dear Sir : The design of this I* to touch  
&#x27;cursorily upon a subject of very grest importance  
to the well being of these States; much more so than  
Will appear at first view. I mean the appointment  
of so many foreigners to office of hign rank and  
trust in our service.  
&quot; The lavish manner in which rank has hitherto ,  
  
been bcntowed on the** gentlemen, will certainly  
be productive of one or the other of thene two  
evils, either to nuke us despicable in the eyes of  
Europe, or become a ineaus of pouring them iu &#x27;  
upou us like a torrent, and adding to our present  
burden.  
But it is neither the expense nor trouble of them  
I most dread; there is an evil more extensive in  
its nature and fatal in its cousequences to be ap­  
prehended, and that is the driving all our own offi­  
cers out of the service, and throwing not only our  
own anny, but our military councils entirely into  
the hands of foreignert.  
&quot;The officers, my dear sir, on whom you must de­  
pend for the defence of this cause, distinguished  
by length of service and military merit, will not  
submit much, if any longer, to the unnatural pro­  
motion of men over them, who have nothing more  
&#x27; than a little plausibility, unbounded pride and am­  
bition, and a perseverance in the application to  
support their pretensions, not to be resisted but by  
uncommon firmness; men who, in the first instance,  
tell you they wish fbr nothing more than the honor  
of serving in so glorious a cause as volunteers, the  
next day solicit rank without pay; the day follow­  
ing want money advanced to them, and in the  
course of a week want farther promotion. The  
expediency and policy of the measure remain to |  
be considered, and whether it ie consistent with  
justice or prudence to promote these military for­  
tune-hunters at the hazard of our army.  
&quot;Baron Steuben, I now find, is also wanting to  
quit his Inspectorship for a command in the line.  
This will be productive of much discontent. In a 1  
word, although I think the Baron an excellent offi­  
| cer, I do mott devoutly with that tee had not a tingle  
foreigner among ut, except the Marquis de Lafay­

To Gov. Morris, Es.-Dear Sir: The design

The officers, my dear sir, on whom you must  
depend for the defence of this cause distinguished  
by length of service and military merit, will not  
submit much, if any longer, to the unnatural  
promotion of men over them, who have nothing  
more than a little plausinility, unbounded pride

vancedto them, and in the course of a week want

of the measure requires to be considered, and  
whether it is consistent with justice or prudence

is also wanting to quit his expectorship for a com­

much discontent. In a word, although I think

To GovERNEUR MORris, EsO. Dear Sir: The  
design of this is to touch cursorily upon a sub­  
ject of very great importance to the well being of  
these States; much more so than will appear at  
first view. I mean the appointment of so many  
foreigners to offices of high rank and trust in our

The lavish manner in which rank has hitherto  
been bestowed on these gentlemen will certainly  
 he productive of one or the other of two evils, el­  
 ther to make us despicable in the eyes of Europe,  
 or become a means of pouring them upon us like  
 a torrent and adding to our present burden.  
But it is neither the expense or trouble of them  
I most dread; there is an evil more extensive in  
its nature and fatal in its consequences to be ap  
prehended, and that is the driving of all our of­  
ficers out of the service and throwing, not only  
our army, but our military councils entirely into  
the hands of foreigners.  
The officers, my dear sir, on whom you must  
 depend for the defence of this cause, distinguish-  
ed by length of service and military merit, will  
not submit much if any longer to the unnatural  
 promotion of men over them, who have nothing  
more than a little plausibility, unbounded pride  
and ambition and a perseverance in the applica  
tion to support their pretentions not to be resis­  
ted but by uncommon firmness; men who, in the  
 first instance, tell you they wish for nothing more  
 than the honor of serving in so glorious a cause  
 as volunteers, the next day solicit rank without  
pay, the day following want money advanced  
to them and in the course of a week want further  
 promotion. The expediency and policy of the mea  
sure remain to be considered, and whether it is  
consistent with justice or prudence to promote  
these fortune hunters at the hazard of our army.  
Baron Steuben, I now find, is also wanting to  
 quit his inspectorship for a command in the line.  
This will be productive of much discontent. In  
 a word, although I think the Baron an excellent  
 officer, I do most deroutly wish that we had not a  
single foreigner among us, except the Marquis de

will .appear at first view, I mean the appointment of  
so many foreigners toojjices of high rank and trust in  
oui service.- The lavish manner in which rank has  
hitherto been&#x27; bestowed on these gentlemen, will cer­  
tainly be productive of one or the other of thesj two  
evils, either to make it despicable in the eyes of Europe,  
or become a means &#x27;of pour ing them in Upon us  
like a torrent, and adding to onr present burden.  
But it is neither the expense nor trouble or them,  
that I most dread, 4 There is an evil more extensive  
in its nature, and fatal in its consequences, to be ap  
prehended, and-that is, the driving of all our owu officers  
out of the service, and throwing Hot only our army,  
but our military councils, entirely into the hands-of

Dear Sir: Whether you are indebted  
to me, or I to you, for a letter, I know not,  
is it a matter ot mucn moment. I ne de­  
sign of this is to touch cursorily upon a  
subject of very great importance to the  
well being of these States ; much more so  
than will appear at first view. I mean  
the appointment of so many foreigners to  
offices of high rank and trust in our service.  
The lavish manner in which rank has  
hitherto been bestowed on these gentlemen,  
will certanly be productive of one or the oth­  
er of these two evils, either to make it des­  
picable in the eyes of Europe, or -become

But it is neither the expense nor trouble

evil more extensive in its nature, and fatal  
in its consequences, to be apprehended, and  
that is, the driving of all our own officers  
out of the service, and throwing not only  
our army, but our military councils, entire­  
ly into the hands of foreigners. The of­  
ficers, my dear sir, on whom you must de­  
pend for the defence of this cause, distin­  
guished by length of service, their connec­  
tions, property, and in behalf of many, I  
may add, military merit, will not submit  
much, if any longer to the unnatural pro­  
motion of men over them, who have noth­  
ing more than a little plausibility, unboun­  
ded pride and ambition, and a perseverance  
in application not to be resisted but by un­  
common firmness, to support their preten­  
sions ; uaen, who in the first instance, tell  
you they wish for nothing more than the  
honor of serving in so glorions a cause as  
volunteers, the next day solicit rank without  
pay, the day following want money advan­  
ced to them, and in the course of a week  
want further promoting, and are not satis­  
fied with anything you can do for them.

these appointments, let me be understood  
to mean, that they have no more doubt of  
their right to resign, when they think  
themselves aggrieved than they have a  
power in Congress to appoint.  
Both being granted, then the expedien  
cy and the policy of the measure remain  
to be considered, and wnetner it is consis  
tent wun justice or prudence to promote  
these miliary fortune-hunters, at the haz­  
ard of your army. They may be divided  
into three classes, namely, mere adventur­  
ers wjth recommendation, or recommended  
by persons who do not knw how else to  
dispose of or provide for them; men of  
great ambition, who would sacrific every­  
thing to promote their own personal glory ;  
or mere spies, who are sent here to obtain  
a thorough knowledge of our situation and  
circumstances, in the execution of which,  
I am persuaded, some of them are faithful

matter escapes unnoticed, or unadvised at

White Plains 24th July, 1778.&#x27; .  
Dear Sir: Whether you are indebted to me, or­  
I to you, for a letter, I know not, nor is a matter ofct  
much moment. The design of this is to touch cur­  
sorily upon subject of very great importance to ;  
the well being of the United States ; much more so&quot;  
than will appear &quot;at first view : I mean the appoint­  
ment of so many -foreigners to office of high rank  
and trust in our service. The lavish manner in  
which rank has hitherto been bestowed on these  
gentlemen, will certainly be productive of one or  
the other of these evils-r-eitherJ;o make us despica­  
ble in the eyes of Europe, or to become the means  
of pouring them in upon us like a torrent, and ad­  
ding to our present burden.  
But it is neither the expense nor trouble of them,  
that I most dread. There is an evil more .extensive  
in its nature, and fatal in its consequences, to be  
apprehended, and that is, the driving of our own  
officers out of the service, and throwing not only  
our army, but our military councils, entirely into  
the hands of foreigners. The officers, my dear sir,  
on whom you must depend for the defence of this  
cause, distinguished by length of service, their con­  
nections, property, and in behalf of many, I may  
add, military merit, will not submit much, if any  
longer to the unnatural promotion of men over them  
who have nothing more than a little plausibility,  
unbounded pride and ambition, and a perseverance  
  
in application not to be resisted but by uncommon  
firmness, to support their pretentions ; men, who  
in the first instance, fell you .they wish for nothing  
more than the honor of serving m so glorious a  
&#x27; cause as volunteers, the next day solicit ranks with  
out pay, the day following want money advanced to  
them, and in the course of a week want further  
promotion, and are not satisfied with anything you  
can do for them. W hen I speak of officers not sub  
mitting to these appointments, let me be under  
stood to mean, that they have no more doubt of  
their right to resign, when tbey think themselves  
aggrieved than they have of a power in Congress to  
appoint.  
Both being granted, them, the expediency and the  
policy of the measure remain to be considered, and  
whether it is consistent with justice or prudence to

Dear Sir: Whether you are indebted to me, or  
I to you, for a letter, I know not, nor is a matter of  
much moment The design of this is to touch cur­  
sorily upon a subject of very great importance to  
the well being of the United States ; much more so  
than will appear at first view: I mean the appoint­  
ment of so many foreigners &#x27; to office of high rank  
and trust in our service. The lavish manner in  
which rank has&quot;hitherto been bestowed on these  
gentlemen, will certainly be productive of one or  
the other of these evils either t make us despica­  
ble in the eyes of Europe, or to become the means  
of pouring tum in upon us like a torrent, and ad-,  
ding to our present burden.  
But it is neither the expense nor trouble of them,  
that I most dread. There is an evil more extensive  
in its nature, and fatal in its consequences, to be  
apprehended, and that is, the driving of our own  
officers out of the service, and thro whig not only  
our army, but our military councils,, entirely into  
the hands of foreigners. The officers, my dear sir,  
on whom you must depend for the defence of this  
cause, distinguished by length of service, their con­  
nections, property, and in behalf of many, I may  
add, military merit, will not submit much, if any  
longer to the unnatural promotion of men over them  
who have nothing more than a little plausibility,  
unbounded pride and ambition, and a perseverance  
in application not to be resisted but by uncommon  
firmness, to support their pretentions; men, who  
in the first instance, tell you they wish for nothing  
more than the honor of serving in so glorious a  
cause as volunteers, the next day solicit rank with­  
out pay, the day following want money ad v i need to  
them, and in the course of a week wajt further  
promotion, and are not satisfied with anything you  
can do for them. hen I speak of officers not sub  
  
mitting to these appointments, let me be under­  
stood to mean, that they have no more doubt of  
their rint to resign, when tbey think themselves  
aggrieved than they have of a power in Congress to  
appoint.  
Both being granted, them, the expediency and the  
prlicy of the measure remain to be considered, and  
whetuvr it is consistent with justice or prudence to  
promote these military fortury-hunters, at the hazard  
of your army. They may be divided into there

great importance to the well being of these States;  
much more so than will appear at first view. I  
mean the appointment of so many foreigners to of­

The lavish manner in which rank has hitherto  
been bestowed on these gentlemen will certainly be  
productive of one or the other of two evils--either  
to make us despicable in the eyes of Europe, or be­  
come a means of pouring them in upon us like a  
torrent, and adding to our present burden.  
But it is neither the expense or the troubles of  
them I most dread; there is an evil more extensive  
in its nature and fatal in its consequences, to be  
apprehended, and that is the driving of our officers  
out of the service, and throwing not only our own  
army, but our military councils entirely into the  
hands of foreigners.  
Baron Steuben, I now find, is also wanting  
to quit his inspectorship for a command in the  
line. This will be productive of much discontent.  
In a word, although I think the Baron an excellent  
officer, I do most devoutly wish that we had not a

&quot;WarIT PLAI-S, 24rT JrLY, 1778.  
&quot;Dear Sir-Whether you are indebted to me, or I  
55. to you, for a letter, I know not, nor is it a matter of  
much moment. The design of this is to touch, cur­  
sorily, upon a subject of very great importance to  
the well-being of these States; much more so than  
will appear at first view. I mean the appointment  
of so many foreigners to offices of high rank and  
trust in our service.  
&quot;ish. The lavish manner, in which rank has hitherto f  
been bestowed on these gentlemen, will certainly be  
productive of one or the other of these two evils,  
either to make it despicable in the eyes of Europe,  
to or become a means of pouring them in upon us like  
m a torrent, and adding to our present burden. But it F  
is neither the expense nor trouble of them that I p  
to most dread. There is an evil more extensive in its  
an consequences, to be apprehended, and that is, the  
ts driving of all our officers out of the service, and  
throwing not only our army, but our military coun- F  
t tils, entirely into the hands of foreigners.  
&quot;s, &quot;The officers, lmy dear sir, on whom you must de- ct  
es- pend for the defence of this cause, distinguished by o  
ior length of service, their connexions, properly, and, in p  
belalf of many, I may add, military merit, will not  
Ily submit much if any longer to the unnatural promo- )t  
tion of men over them, who have nothing more than t  
a little plausibility, unbounded pride and ambition, F:  
o and a perseverance in application rot to be resisted ec  
se but by uncommon firmness, to support theiipreten- t  
sions; men, who, in the first instance, tell you they  
wish for nothing more than the honor of sprving in I  
n- so glorious a cause as volunteers, the nerxt day soli- as  
cit rank without pay, the day following want money  
.1 advanced to them, and in the course of a week want  
Is further promotion, and are not satisfied with any un  
thing you can do for them. co  
r- &quot;When I speak of officers not submitting to these tr&lt;  
I. appointments, let me be understood to mean, that ti  
they have no more doubt of their riglht to resign,  
whlen they think themselves aggrieved, than they m&lt;  
hare of a power in congress to appoint. Both being pr.  
r- granted, then, the expediency and the policy of the cis  
n measure remain to be considered, and whether it is  
consistent with justice or prudence to promote these  
imilitary fortune-hunters, at the hazard of your ar­  
my. &#x27;flhey may be divided inlto three classes, name- th  
- ly, mere advelnturers without recommendation, or zet  
recommended by persons, who do not know how else ant  
to dispose of or provide for them; men of great am- ant  
bition, who would sacrifice every thing to promote an,  
their own personal glory; or mere spies, wilho are ent  
sent here to obtain a thorough kuowledge of our the  
situation and circumstances, in the execution of ind  
which, I am persuaded, some of them-are faithful f.  
emissaries, as I do not believe a single matter es- for  
capes unnoticed, or unadviced at a foreign court. I wh  
&#x27;&quot;I could say a great deal on this subj( ct, but wiftl ed,  
add no more at present. I antm led to give you this &#x27; con  
trouble at this time, by a very handsomne certificate o  
showed to me yesterday in favor of M. Žeuville, writ- last  
ten (I believe) by himself, and subscribed by general wis  
Parsons, designed, as I am informed, for a founda- to t

Dear Sir: The design of this is to

great importance to the well-being of these  
States, much more so than wl appear at

The lavish manner in which rank has  
  
hitherto been bestowed on these geiulemen  
will certainly be productive of one or the.  
other of these two evils either to make  
  
us despicable in the eyes&#x27;of Europe, or

that &quot;is the driying all our own officers out  
of service, and throwing nqt only our

Deaa Sir:- The design of this is to touch cursorily up­  
on a subject of very great importance to the well being of  
these States, much more so than will appear at first sight  
-I mean the appointment of so many foreigners to offices  
of high rank and trust in our service.  
The lavish manner in which rank has hitherto been be­  
stowed on these gentlemen, will certainly be productive of  
one or the other of these two evils, either to make us des­  
picable in the eyes of Europe, or become a means of pour­  
ing them in upon us like a torrent, and adding to our pre­  
sent burden. But it is neither the expense nor the trou­  
ble of them I most dread; there is an evil more extensive  
in its nature and fatal in its consequence to be apprehend­  
ed, and that is, the driving of all our officers out of the  
service, and throwing not only our own army, but our  
militiary councile entirely into the hands of foreigners.  
The officers, my dear sir, on whom you must depend for the  
defense of the cause, distinguished by length of service and  
militiary merit, will not submit much, if any longer to the  
unnatural promotion of men over them, who have nothing  
more than a little plausibility, unbounded pride and ambi­  
tion, and a perseverance in the application to support  
their pretensions, not to be resisted but by uncommon  
firmness; men who in the first instance, say they wish for  
nothing more than the honor of serving so glorious a  
cause as volunteers, the next day solicit rank without pay,  
the day following want money advanced to them; and in  
the course of a week, want further promotion.  
The expediency and policy of the measure remains to  
be considered, and whether it is consistent with justice or  
prudence to promote these military fortune-hunters at the  
hazard of our army. Baron Steuben, I now find, is also  
wanting to quit his inspectorship for a command in the  
line. This will be productive of much discontent. In a  
word, although I think the Baron an excellent officer, I do  
most, devoutly wish that we had not a single foreigner  
amongst us, except the Marquis de Lafayette, who acts  
upon very different principles from those which govern the  
rest. Adieu I am, most sincerely yours,
