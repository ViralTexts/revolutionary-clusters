O Thou, whose wisdom, solid yet refin’d  
Whose patriot-virtues, and consumate skill  
So struck the finer springs that move the world  
joind to what’er the Graces can bestow,  
And all Apollo’s animating fire  
Give thee with pleasing dignity to shine  
At once the Guardian, ornament and joy  
Of polish’d life, permit the Rural Muse  
O Chesterfield, to grace thee with her Song!  
e’er to the shades again she Humbly flies  
Indulge her fond ambition in thy Train,  
(For every Muse has in thy train a place)  
To Mark thy various full accomplish’d mind  
To mark that Spirit which, with British scorn  
Rejects th Allurements of corrupted power;  
That elegant politeness which excels,  
Even in the judgment of presumptuous France  
The boasted manners of her shining court  
That wit, the vivid energy of Sense  
The truth of Nature, which with Attic point  
  
And kind well-temperd Satire, smoothly keen  
Steals through the Soul and without pain corrects.  
  
I think the Speculations you inclose prove that there is full Liberty of the press. Cato shews he has a bad cause to defend whilst the Forester writes with a spirit peculiar to himself and leads me to think that he has an intimate acquaintance with Common Sense.

I would fain hope that the time may not be far distant when those things you hint at may be carried into Execution.  
  
Oh are ye not those patriots, in whose power  
That best, that Godlike Luxery is plac’d  
Of blessing thousands, thousands yet unborn  
Thro’ late posterity? Ye large of Soul  
chear up dejected industery, and give  
A double Harvest to the pining Swain  
Teach thou the Labouring hand the Sweets of Toil  
How by the finest Art, the Native robe  
To weave; how white as hyperborean Snow  
To form the lucid lawn; with venturous oar  
How to dash wide the billow; nor look on  
Shamefully passive, while Brittania’s Fleets  
Defraud us of the glittering finny Swarms  
That heave our friths, and swarm upon our Shores  
How all-enlivening trade to rouse, and wing  
The prosperous Sail, from every growing port  
uninjurd, round the sea incircled Globe.

God we can stand—stand against the adver-  
sary, with all his wiles. Who, then, would  
rest short of the whole? A part will not an-  
swer.—James Brainerd Tuylor.  
  
THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN.  
  
Oh, is there not some patriot, in whose pow’r  
  
That best, that godlike luxury is plac’d,  
  
Of blessing thousands, thousauds yet unborn  
  
Through late posterity ? Some, large of soul,  
  
To cheer dejected industry ? to give  
  
A double harvest to the pining swain ?  
  
To teach the lab’ring kind the sweets of toil ?  
—James Thomson.
