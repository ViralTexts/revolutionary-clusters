Fredericksburg,  
  
Dec. 4th, 1833.  
  
  
I had the unfeigned pleasure of receiving your letter, respecting the proper manner of opening to the public  
the extent of the mineral resources of Virginia. I beg to assure you it is particularly gratifying to me, to find your  
opinion of the utility of a measure we have so frequently conversed about, entirely coinciding with my own. I sit down  
most willingly to give you a sketch of my opinion of those resources, and of a worthy and practical manner of developing  
them. It is too important a subject to be well examined in the compass of an ordinary letter; but I will endeavor to make  
it as little tedious as possible.  
It happens opportunely, that the Governor of this state, in his recent message, has recommended the very  
measure approved of, a geological survey, to the Legislature. Such a measure has already been authorised by the  
Legislatures of Massachusetts and Maryland: and I have for some time perceived, a strong feeling in favor of it has been  
rapidly growing up in this state. This comes in the natural order of things. Formerly, this country presented the  
spectacle of an immense territory, with a small population sparingly scattered on its immense border. Now, its condition  
is greatly changed; for, although the impressions of the revolution are still fresh upon all minds, as if all had been  
contemporary with it, we have the energies of a nation, numerous and powerful in extenso, forcibly displaying themselves  
on every side. Some of the cities are growing up into the first class of magnitude, and the general wants correspond to  
the increase of numbers. Those labor-saving machines, canals and rail-roads, are gradually extending themselves over the  
face of the country; and the distant agriculturist finds, in the facilities they give him for the transportation of his  
produce to market, a compensation for his former high prices.  
But corn, wheat, and edible commodities are not the only things human ingenuity can produce; and the day has  
passed by, when the value of an acre of land was to be estimated solely by the number of bushels it would produce. That  
square acre goes down in a solid mass towards the centre of the earth, and the wants of man and his curiosity will not  
permit him to rest, until he knows, to a certain extent, what that mass consists of, and to what useful purpose he can  
apply it. Geology is the science which enables him to gratify that curiosity.  
The ancestors of the present generation knew not two hundred years ago, the wants which press upon their  
descendants; they were few in number, and their greatest anxiety was for a secure and abundant means of existence. They  
held the country when it was in its infant state, but their children enjoy it in the mature state; and the boy’s wants are  
almost forgotten in the urgencies of those of the man. Yet, most happily, the easy means of satisfying them exist. The  
wise dispensations of our Creator have provided those for every stage of society; it is man who is to blame, if, having  
health, he consents to remain poor and miserable; and the same may be said of communities of men, who disregard the  
resources which are benevolently placed within their reach.  
It has often been remarked as a surprising circumstance, that the early settlers of Virginia seem never to  
have suspected the existence of gold in the state, which we know at this time to be very extensively diffused across its  
whole territory. Considering how much of it has been found of late, it does appear to want some explanation; but perhaps  
this may not unreasonably be found, in the very woody state of the country, and in the exclusive occupations I have  
alluded to. It is necessity which is the mother of invention, and they were not under the immediate necessity of looking  
for it. In Chesterfield and Henrico counties, which are nearer to the first communities of the Ancient Dominion,  
bituminous coal crops out on the surface very obviously; these indications could hardly escape their notice, or be  
misunderstood by them, as they came from a country where coal was already in domestic use. But in none of the ancient  
records of Virginia that I have seen, is this coal alluded to; and the reason it had no importance in their eyes, most  
probably was, that their fuel was the wood, from which they were obliged to disencumber the ground to plant their corn.  
Things which they could put to a profitable use we find did attract their attention. We have the proof of  
this, in the use they made, as far back as 1619, under the government of Sir George Yeardly, of white and blue fossil marl, for the purpose of manuring their lands, and by the aid of which they obtained wheat  
at the rate of thirty bushels to the acre. But granite and other stones of construction, soapstone, porcelain clay, and  
other numerous mineral substances, now having an intrinsic value, they paid no attention to. Most probably it never  
occurred to any of them, that a breakwater would be constructed at Cape Henlopen, for the protection of the future navies  
and commerce of their country: much less could they suppose that the rocks for its construction would be brought from the  
neighborhood of Wilmington in Delaware, and some of them from the banks of the Hudson river. There  
is not a stone in the earth but is there for a wise purpose, and it is our ignorance and indolence which make us  
blind to this important truth.  
It has been acknowledged by the most eminent writers, that the prosperity of Great Britain is mainly founded  
upon her mineral riches. The substitution of human ingenuity for manual labor, is the distinguishing character of modern  
times; but all the complex and multifarious machinery of her manufactories, cannot operate without steam, nor can this be  
gathered without fuel. The main source, then, of the wealth of that country, is coal: without it, the cloths, the cottons,  
the iron, the cutlery, the pottery and a hundred productive branches of art, would cease to exist there, and with them  
their immense commerce, and their powerful navy. But thirty millions of tons of bituminous coal, exclusive of  
non-bituminous or anthracite, are annually raised there, and every thing is prosperous: wealth increases, great public and  
private undertakings are projected and executed, and such is the demand for every mineral substance, that all receive an  
intrinsic value, sufficient to enable them to sustain even the expenses of a distant transportation. So true is this, that  
the flagstones of the side-walks of the City of London, are brought from the northern parts of Scotland, and the granite  
used for the construction of the new London bridge, was imported from the same distant country. Every quarry, then, of  
mineral substances in that island, is a source of profit to its proprietor, supports the families of many industrious men,  
and assists to maintain the great transportation interests which conduct the material to its destination; whilst these  
interests, to be permanently prosperous, depend again, where navigation is out of the question, upon well constructed  
roads and canals.  
Here then we perceive the nature of the prosperity of that industrious country, and can no longer be  
surprised that geology, the science which teaches men how to judge from external indications the probable subterranean  
value of surfaces, should be so assiduously cultivated.  
Let us apply, then, my dear sir, this useful lesson to the United States, and especially to the fine state of  
Virginia. The general complaint is, that the arable land is impoverished by our cultivation, and that the old class of  
wealthy proprietors, once the ornaments of America, is fast disappearing. There is no doubt much truth in this, and it  
would present a melancholy perspective, if no remedy was apparent. But in relation to agricultural management, a great  
effort is obviously now making, to introduce an ameliorating and more systematic culture. It has already been attended  
with sufficient success to insure the confidence of the farming interest. This is a great point gained, examples going  
much farther than precept with farmers. Many of them are only to be diverted from their antiquated and unproductive  
practices, by being surrounded with successful examples. The more you talk to them, the more obstinate you make them,  
their minds being pre-occupied with the notion, that you want them to seal their own humiliation by surrendering their  
judgment to yours, and this they will not do. But make twenty five bushels of wheat, where they only make ten, and let  
them see numerous instances of this, and they will soon come to. I think therefore the agriculture of the state is in a  
progressively improving condition, and that ere long the beneficial effects will be generally felt and acknowledged.  
In the meantime, it has been ascertained from the very superficial examinations the state has received, that  
its mineral resources are not surpassed by those of any state in the union; and yet nothing has been done to develope  
them, and make them part of the active wealth of the country. Does this supineness proceed from rational doubts that the  
result would be problematical? What evidence, and whence derived, have we of the probability of this? Public patronage has  
not yet been extended to any branch of this important object; and private enterprize, where it has been guided by sound  
discretion, as the instance of the bituminous coal pits of Chesterfield county, has been brilliantly rewarded. But let us  
suppose the whole district in which this valuable coal field is situated, to have been so deeply covered with other  
mineral substances, that no external indications had presented themselves, and that the coal, as frequently occurs, laid  
below the depth of the wells of the country, and we may fairly suppose that that coal field would not have been discovered  
unto this day. In the absence of public patronage and private enterprize, the same supineness that condemns so many other  
mineral products, to their subterranean obscurity, would have also included it. But nature there gave a hint which could  
not be mistaken; the coal cropped out conspicuously on the surface, and could not be neglected. May we not reasonably  
conclude then, that other coal fields, now hidden, but lying contiguous to the navigable waters of Virginia, exist?  
Certainly, as far as my observations have gone, there are many encouraging indications of such deposits. And what is here  
said of coal, may be said of salt and other valuable mineral substances on both sides of the mountains. How are any of  
them to be found out, if they are not to be looked for, and by persons trained and accustomed to investigations of that  
kind?  
The cultivation of the science of geology has produced this immutable truth, that all the mineral and  
metallic substances in the earth, are not accidentally and irregularly distributed where they are found, but that they  
have been brought into their places by laws as unchangeable as any other natural laws. Hence, the practical geologist,  
familiar with the structure of the crust of the earth, is able to say, from the inspection of any one of its numerous  
beds, what its relation is to any of the other beds: whether, for instance, it is above, or whether it is below the coal,  
and this with as much accuracy as he can tell, whether any particular letter of the alphabetical column is, when in its  
proper place, above any other given letter, or below it. Without this knowledge, he might dig for coal, for salt, or any  
other substance, through rocks lying far beneath the proper place belonging to those minerals in the crust of the earth.  
And this has often been done, to the great loss and disappointment of the undertakers. It is thus that geology enables us  
to apply our acquaintance with the laws of nature, to purposes intended to be conducive to the prosperity of the human  
race.  
Since then, unquestioned indications exist in various parts of Virginia, of coal, of iron, of gold and  
silver, of copper, of salt, of lead, and of other mineral and metallic substances, can any satisfactory reason be given,  
why the state should not engage in the execution of a project of such incalculable importance to her prosperity, as a  
detailed geological investigation of her whole territory, and the subsequent construction of a geological map, upon which,  
of a commensurate scale, the exact localities of all her metals and fossil manures, should be accurately laid down, with  
their geographical elevation, their direction and bearing, their extent and qualities? Will it be disputed, that a map of  
this character, accompanied with a lucid detailed report, constructed by competent persons from personal investigation,  
would be invaluable, and do honor to the period when its construction was authorized? Never can such a project be  
sufficiently appreciated until it is executed; then only would men unite in expressing their astonishment that it had been  
neglected so long. Is it not manifest, that in the natural progress of things, such a project should precede, and not  
follow, a general system of internal improvements; it being of the last importance, that the direction given to the routes  
of canals and roads of every description, should be much influenced by the local position of mineral and metallic beds,  
and that they should not be influenced altogether, as they still continue to be, by the physical geography of particular  
lines of direction?  
But I am conscious, it is unnecessary for me further to urge these considerations upon your enlightened mind.  
I have been insensibly drawn into an unwonted length on an important subject, and have but very little room to advert to a  
most interesting locality of the metallic resources of Virginia, now known as the gold region. I imagine a great  
misconception exists in the public mind in relation to this subject, and I am happy that the information it is in my power  
briefly to communicate, is founded upon repeated personal investigation. I had conceived, some years ago, the plan of  
executing a sketch of a general geological map of the United States; but, after great devotion to the pursuit, by  
preparatory studies in Europe and this country, and a great expenditure of time and money, I have given it up, satisfied  
that it is a task far beyond the powers of an unassisted individual. The last two years, my investigations have been  
principally limited to Virginia, and unconnected with any individuals whatever, as I always have been, and still am. I  
have, during this period, made myself familiarly acquainted with every gold vein that has been worked in the state. To  
this period of my life, I shall always look back with pleasure; every facility has been extended to me by the most  
grateful hospitality from every quarter. If language were not inadequate to express what I must always feel on this  
subject, a delicate respect for the generous minds to whom I feel under such deep obligations, would at any rate impose  
silence upon me.  
Interesting as the study of these veins has proved to me, and full of instruction, it is not upon this  
occasion I can enter into a scientific relation of their structure, and mineralogical characters. It must suffice me to  
say, that some of them present occasionally, the most surprisingly beautiful and rich specimens of ore; where the quartz  
contains from ten to forty per cent. in weight of native gold, so pure, as to rise as high as twenty three to twenty three  
and a half carats. In some instances the gold is found alloyed with silver, and in others I have found not inconsiderable  
quantities of a variety of red sulphuret of silver. Tellurium also is not uncommon; to these may be added sulphuret of  
lead, pyritous copper, and, though rarely, beautiful crystals of fibrous malachite. The sulphurets of iron are extremely  
abundant. In the most celebrated national collections of Europe, most of which I have visited, I have never seen ores more  
remarkable for richness and beauty. The rarest are from Orange, Spottsylvania and Culpeper, where considerable  
developements have been made, and I am sure that no mineralogist who could have an opportunity of examining those I have  
seen, would hesitate to agree in the admiration I freely bestow upon them. It is true, they are not of very frequent  
occurrence, but still they are met with under circumstances, which hold out great encouragement to pursue the veins, far  
beneath the superficial depths that have been yet attempted.   
The nature, too, of the alluvial deposits of gold, strengthens, in a remarkable manner, the encouragement  
given by these indications. Nothing can be more certain, than that the precious metal found in these, is derived from  
broken down quartz veins, and slate veins containing seams of gold, lying in the vicinity of the deposites. I can give you  
a recent gratifying instance of this. The proprietors of a deposit in the county of Louisa, which had been for some time  
productive, came unexpectedly upon a very rich bed of gravel, which yielded them in six days, near ten thousand dollars in  
fine gold. And this is no illusion: for I have had an opportunity of seeing the gold, and of examining and comparing it  
with specimens of the vein from whence it was derived, and which they have also had the good fortune to discover  
contiguous to the deposite. The rock is a pale porous quartz, thickly studded with knobs and lamina of gold, which  
correspond exactly in form with the particles found in the bed of gravel. The same correspondence I have often observed in  
other localities, and especially at Greenwood in Orange county.  
But it is not such rich specimens of rock alone which form the temptation to enter upon systematic mining;  
for, I have seen many veins in Fauquier, Stafford and other counties, where gold is invisibly combined with the sulphurets  
of iron and copper, and very extensively with pure quartz, so as to yield, when treated by proper processes, from one to  
six pennyweights for every bushel of ninety six pounds weight. The minimum of these rates would be considered a profitable  
ore. There have been various attempts to extract the gold from ore of this kind, upon a somewhat large scale, but the want  
of practical knowledge in metallurgy, the defectiveness of the processes applied, and the novelty of the undertaking,  
conducted in most instances by persons unacquainted with the art of reducing metals, have hitherto produced a few failures  
in the experiments attempted; these, being greatly exaggerated and much misrepresented, have had the effect of checking  
the disposition which had arisen amongst capitalists, to come forward in aid of this branch of industry, by establishing  
the most promising of these mines upon regular systematic principles.  
A gold mine, projected with judgment and conducted with skill and economy, is but a manufactory of a  
particular kind, which gives employment to laborers, who are fed and clothed by other branches of industry. Whatever gives  
honest and constant employment to the laboring classes, is a blessing, enabling the laborer to support his family, whilst  
his employer draws a profit from his industry; but in Virginia, where labor and food are comparatively so cheap, and where  
the main strength of mining labor would soon be as advantageously drawn from colored men--and this I have had evidence  
of--as from the lower class of whites, mining would be a new and invaluable direction to turn her surplus labor into. But  
the great lever, capital, still is wanting; and without it, nothing can be done.  
The auriferous veins appear to maintain a steady continuity towards the centre of the earth; and to sink a  
shaft of sixty feet, and construct a tunnel to intersect it, is a mere superficial operation, to which, for the want of  
capital, the operations now in progress, are necessarily limited. If the vein is to be tried at lower depths, a steam  
engine must be employed to keep the works dry; and if favorable indications encourage the proprietor to construct  
galleries parallel to his veins, he soon finds that his unaided efforts are insufficient; that he is doing nothing for his  
country, and is embarrassing himself; that to carry his mine on upon well-approved principles, he must have the aid of a  
capital which will enlarge his business to the required scale, and bring experience and practical science to the  
management of it. Private partnerships are subject to so much inconvenience in similar undertakings; it is so difficult to  
withdraw from them when great interests are embarked; and death so often enhances the difficulty, by making it impossible  
for the survivor to separate his interest from that of inheriting minors, that it is seldom one or two individuals can be  
found willing to risk the required amount.  
It is by incorporated companies alone such undertakings can be profitably established. A hundred individuals  
will cheerfully divide a risk, that may appear formidable to a few; the undertaking succeeds, a hundred are gratified; if  
it fails, no one is seriously injured; whilst in both cases the public industry is encouraged. And this, in my opinion, is  
the true policy to be adopted by the State, viz. to encourage capital to come from a distance, to develope her dormant  
resources. I speak guardedly when I aver, that if the capitalists of England had entertained as favorable an opinion of  
the gold and copper lodes of Virginia, as they deserve to inspire, that in 1824 and 1825, when from twelve to fifteen  
millions sterling went to South America to re-establish the mines, at least two millions of that amount might have been  
placed in Virginia, if her gold veins had been discovered.  
Some philosophers are feelingly alive to the danger of encouraging foreign money to come into the country;  
foreign labor in the disguise of cloth, cotton, cutlery, pottery, may come, although a substitute for native labor; but  
foreign money, to pay American labor, that may not come. I venture, however, to predict, if ten millions of dollars are  
ever placed in Virginia, for the purpose of bringing her gold and silver, her copper and other valuable minerals and  
metals to light, that the prosperity will be so universally enjoyed, as to leave the alarmists in a very feeble minority.  
And indeed, although little more than two years have elapsed since gold has been much talked of, as a product  
of Virginia, she has been already benefitted by the exertions that have been made. I have been informed by authority I  
know to be undoubted, that northern capital to the amount of more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, has been  
expended in two or three counties in the mining interest; and that seventy thousand dollars in bullion, cast from gold  
found in Orange, Louisa, Spottsylvania and Culpeper, within the present year, have passed through one Bank in  
Fredericksburg, exclusively belonging to native citizens of Virginia. It is then, an incontrovertible truth, that the  
employment of capital on a larger scale, may greatly benefit the state, and that by adopting a wise policy, she may become  
to this country, what Cornwall is to England, the seat of prodigious industry, and the source of much individual and  
national wealth. Let but one incorporated company succeed, and confidence will immediately spring up. Capital will flow  
in--real estate will rise to its value--surplus labor will be in demand, and the Ancient Dominion will become what she  
ought now to be--a prosperous mining country.  
Permit me now, my dear sir, to add my most cordial wishes for your uninterrupted health and comfort, with the  
assurances of my being, Most respectfully, Your devoted and faithful servant,

Fredericksburg, Dec. 4, 1833.  
To James Madison, Esq.  
Dear Sir: I had the unfeigned plea,  
sure of receiving your letter respect­  
ing the proper manner of opening to  
the public the extent of the mineral  
resources of Virginia. I beg to assure  
you it is particularly gratifying to me,  
to find your opinion of the utility of a  
measure we have so frequently con­  
versed about, entirely coinciding with  
my own. 1 sit down most willingly to  
give you a sketch of my opinion of  
those resources, and of a worthy and  
practical manner of developing them,  
it is too important a subject to be well  
examined, in the compass of an ordina­  
ry letter; but 1 will endeavor to make  
it ns little tedious as possible.  
It happens opportunely that the Go­  
vernor of this State, in his recent \
message, has recommended the very ;  
measure approved of (a geographical (  
survey) to the legislature. Such a  
measure has already been authorized j  
by the legislatures of Massa ihusetts  
and Maryland; and I have for some  
time perceived a strong feeling in fa.  
ver of it has been rapidly growing up  
in this State. This comes in the natu.  
ral order of things. Formerly, this  
country presented the spectacle of an  
immense territory, with a small popula.  
tion sparingly scattered on its immense  
border. Now, its condition is greatly  
changed; lor, although the impressions  
of the revolution are still fresh upon  
all minds, as if all had been contempo­  
rary with it, we have the energies of a  
nation, numerous and powerful in ex­  
tent, forcibly displaying themselves on  
every side.—Some of the cities are  
growing up into the first class of mag­  
nitude, and the general wants corres­  
pond to the increase of numbers.  
Those labor-saving machines, canals  
and rail-roads, are gradually extending  
themselves over the face of the coun­  
try, and the distant agriculturist finds,  
in the facilities they give him for the  
transportation of his produce to mark­  
et, a compensation for his former high  
prices.  
  
But corn, wheat, and edible com­  
modities are not the only things human  
ingenuity can produce: and the day  
has passed bv when the value of an  
acre of land was to be estimated sole­  
ly by the number of bushels it would  
produce. That square acre goes down  
in a solid mass towards the centre of  
the earth, and the wants of man and  
his curiosity will not permit him to  
rest, until he knows to a certain ex­  
tent, what that mass consists of, and to  
what useful purpose he can apply it.  
Geology is the science which enables  
him to gratify that curiosity.  
The ancestors of the present genera­  
tion knew not, two hundred years ago,  
the wants which press upon their de­  
scendants; they were few in number,  
and their greatest anxiety was for a  
secure and abundant menns of exist­  
ence. They held the country when  
it was in its infunt state; hut their  
children enjoy it in the mature state;  
and the boy’s wants were almost for­  
gotten in the urgencies of those of the &#x27;  
man. Yet, most happily, the easy  
means of satisfying them exists. The  
wise dispensations of our Creator have  
provided those lor every stage of soci­  
ety;. it is man who is to blame, if,  
having health, he consents to rema n  
poor and miserable; and the same may  
bo said of communities of men who dis­  
regard the resources which are benev­  
olently placed within his reach.  
It has often been remarked as sur­  
prising circumstance, that the early  
settlers of Virginia seem never to have  
suspected the existence of gold in the  
State, which we know at this time to  
be very extensively diffused across  
its whole territory. Considering how  
much of it has been found of late, it  
does appear to want same explanation;  
but perhaps this may not unreasonably  
be found, in the very woody state ol  
the country, and in the exclusive occu.  
  
I  
pations, I have alluded to. It is neces­  
sity which is the mother of invention,  
and they were not under; the immedi­  
ate necessity of looking for it. In Ches­  
terfield and Henrico counties, which  
are nearer to the first communities of  
the Ancient Dominion, bituminous coal  
crops out on the surface very obvious­  
ly; these indications could hardly cs­  
cape their notice, or be misunderstood  
by them, as they came from a coun­  
try where coal was already in domes­  
tic use. But in none of the ancient  
records of Virginia that I have seen, is  
this coal alluded to; and the reason it  
had no importance in their eyes, most  
prolably was, that their fuel was wood,  
from which they were obliged to dis­  
encumber the ground to plant their  
corn.  
Things which they could put to a  
profitable use, we find did attract their !  
attention. We have the proof of this,  
in the use they made, as fur back as 1  
1019, under the government of Sir  
George Yearly, of white and blue fos.  
sil marie, for the purpose of manuring  
their lands, nnd by the aid of which  
they obtained wheat at the rate of  
thirty bushels to the acre. But gran­  
ite nnd other stones of construction,  
soapstone, porcelain clay, and other  
numerous mineral substances, now  
having an intrinsic value they paid no  
attention to. Most probably it never  
occurred to any of them, that a break­  
water would ever be constructed ut  
Cape Henlopen, for the protection of  
the future navies and commerce of  
their country: much less could they  
suppose that the rocks for its construe­  
tion would be brought from the neigh­  
borhood of Wilmington in Deluware,  
nnd some of them from the bunks of  
the Hudson river. There is not a  
ttone in the earth, but is there for a  
wise purpose, and it is our ignorance  
and indolence which make us blind to  
this important truth.  
It has been acknowledged by the  
most eminent writers, that the prosper­  
ity of Great Britain is muinly founded  
upon her mineral riches. The substi­  
tution of human ingenuity for manual  
labor, is the distinguishing character  
of modern times; but all the complex  
nnd multifarious machinery of her ma­  
nufactories, cannot operate without  
steam, nor can this be gathered with­  
out fuel. The main source then, of  
the wealth of that country is coal:  
without it the cloths, the cottons, the  
iron, the cutlery, the pottery, and a  
hundred productive brunches of art,  
would cease to exist there, and with  
them there immense commerce, and  
their powerful navy. But thirty mil­  
lions of tons of bituminous coal, exclu­  
sive of non-bituminous or anthracite,  
are annually raised there, and every  
thing is pros|&gt;erous: wealth increases,  
great public and private undertakings  
are projected and executed; and such  
is the demand for every mineral sub­  
stance that all receive an intrinsic va­  
lue sufficient to enable them to sustain  
even the expenses of a distant trans­  
portation. So true is this that the  
flagstones of the side-walks of the City  
ofLondon are brought from the north­  
ern parts of Scotland, and the granite  
used for the construction of the new  
London Bridge was imported from the  
same distant country. Every quarry  
then, of mineral substances in thnt Isl  
and, is a source of profit to its proprie­  
tor, supports the families of many in­  
dustrious men, and assists to maintain  
the great transportation interests which  
conduct the mateiial to its destination;  
whilst these interests, to be permanent­  
ly prosperous, depend again, where  
navigation is out of the question, upon  
well constructed roads and canals.  
Here then we perceive thenature of  
the prosperity of that industrious coun­  
try, and can no longer be surprised  
that Geology the science which teach­  
es men how to judge from external in-&#x27;  
dications the probable subterranean va­  
lue of surfaces, should be so assidu­  
ously cultivated.  
Let us apply, then, my dear sir,  
this useful lesson to the U. States,  
nnd especially to the fine State of Vir­  
ginia. The general complaint is, that  
the arable land is impoverished by our  
cultivation, and that the old class of  
wealthy proprietors, once the ornu­  
ments of America, is fast disappearing.  
There is no doubt much truth in this,  
anti it would present a melancholy  
perspective, if no remedy was appa­  
rent. But in relation to agricultural  
management, a great effort is obvious- j  
ly now making to introduce an ameli­  
orating and more systematic culture.  
It has already been attended with suffi­  
cient success to ensure the confidence  
of the farming interest. This is a  
great point gained-example going  
&#x27; much farther than precept with farm­  
ers. Many of them are only to be di­  
verted from their antiquated and un­  
productive practices, by being sur­  
rounded with successful examples.  
The more you talk to them, the rnore  
obstinate you make them, their minds  
  
! being pre-occupied with the notion that  
you want them to seal their own hu­  
miliation by surrendering their judg.  
nient to yours, and this they will not  
do. But make twenty.five bushels of  
wheat, where they only make ten, and  
let them see numerous instances of  
this, and they will soon come to. I  
think therefore the agriculture of the  
btatc, is in a progressively improving  
condition, and that ere long the bene­  
ficial effects will be generally felt and  
acknowledged.  
In the meantime, it has been ascer­  
tained from the very superficial exam­  
inations the State &#x27;has received, that  
its mineral resources are not surpass­  
ed by those of any State in the Union;  
and yet nothing has been done to de­  
velope them, and make them part of  
the active wealth of the country. Does  
this supineness proceed from rational  
doubts that the result would be problem­  
atical? What evidence, and whence  
derived, havoweof the probability of  
this? Public patronage has not yc‘t  
been extended to any branch of this  
important object; aud privute enter­  
prise, where it has been guided by  
sound discretion, os the instance of the  
bituminous coal pits of Chesterfield  
county, has been brilliantly rewarded.  
But let us suppose the whole district  
in which this valuable coal field is situ­  
ated, to have been so deeply covered  
with other minerul substances, that  
no external indications had presented  
themselves, and that the coal, ns fre­  
quently occurs, laid below the depth  
of the wells of the country, and we  
may fairly suppose that, that coal field  
would not have been discovered unto  
this day. In the absence of public  
patronage and private enterprise, the  
same supineness that condemns so ma­  
ny other mineral products lo their sub­  
terrancan obscurity, would have also  
included it. But nature there gave  
a hint that could not be mistaken; the  
coal cropped out conspicuously on the  
surface, nnd could not be neglected.  
Mny we not reasonably conclude then,  
that other coal fields, now hidden, but  
lying contiguous to the navigable wa­  
ters of Virginia, exist? Certainly, ns  
far ns my observations have gone,  
there are mnny encouraging indicn­  
lions of such deposites. And what is  
here sai l of coal, mny he said of salt  
and other valuable mineral substances  
on both sides of the mountains. How  
are any of them to be found out if they  
are not looked for, and by persons  
trained nnd accustomed to investiga­  
tions of that kind?  
  
The cultivation of the Science of ge-&#x27;  
ology has produced this immutable  
truth, that all the mineral and metallic  
substances in the earth are not acci-!  
dentally and irregularly distributed ■  
where they are found, but that they  
have been brought into their places  
by laws as unchangeable as any other  
natural laws. Hence, the practical  
geologist, familiar with the structure of  
the crust of the earth, is able to say,  
from the inspection of any one of its  
numerous beds, wlmt its relation is to  
any of the other beds: whether, for in­  
stance, it is above, or whether it is  
below the coal, and this with ns much  
accuracy as he can tell whether any  
particular letter of the alphabetical  
column is, when in its proper place,  
above any othergiven letter, or b&lt; low  
it. Without this knowledge, he might  
dig for coal, for salt, or any other sub­  
stance, through rocks lying far be­  
neath the proper place belonging to  
those minerals in the crust of the earth.  
And this has often been done, to the  
great loss and disappointment of the  
undertakers. It is thus that geology  
enables ns to apply our acquaintance  
with the laws of nature to purposes in­  
tended to be conducive to the prosperi­  
ty of the human race.  
Since, th&lt; n, unquestioned indications  
exist in various parts of Virginia, of  
coal, of iron, of gold and silver, of  
copper, of salt, of lead, and of other  
mineral and metallic substances, can  
any satisfactory reason be given, why  
the State should not engage in the ex­  
ecution of a project of such incalcu­  
lable importance to her prosperity, as  
a detailed geological investigation of  
her whole territory, and the subse­  
quent construction of a geological map,  
upon which, of a commensurate scale,  
the exact localities of nil her metals,  
and fossil manures should be accurate­  
ly laid down; with their geographical  
elevation, their direction and bearing,  
their extent and qualities? Will it be  
disputed, that a map of this character,  
accompanied with a lucid detailed re­  
port, constructed by competent persons  
from personal investigation, would be  
invaluable, and do honor to the period  
when its construction was authorized?  
Never can such a project be sufficient­  
ly appreciated until it is executed;  
then only would men unite in ex pressing  
their astonishment, that it had been  
neglected so long. Is it not manifest,  
that in the natural progress of things,  
auch a project should precede, and not  
  
&gt; follow, a general system of internal  
improvements; it being of the last im­  
portnneo, that the direction given to  
: the routes of canals and roads ol eve­  
ry description should bcmuch influenced  
by the local position of mineral and  
&#x27; metallic beds, and that they should not  
be influenced altogether, as they still  
contiuue to be, by the physical geogra­  
phy of particular lines of direction?  
But 1 am conscious, it is unnecessa­  
ry for me further to urge these consi­  
derations upon your enlightened inind.  
I have been insensibly drawn into un  
unwonted length ou nn important sub­  
ject, and have very little room to ad­  
vert to a most interesting locality of  
the metallic resources of Virginia, now  
known us the Gold Region. I imagine  
a great misconception exists in the pub­  
lic mind in relation to this subject, and  
1 uni happy that the information it is in  
my power briefly to communicate, is  
founded up&lt;« repented persounl inves­  
tigation. I had conceived, some years  
! ago, the plan of executing n sketch of j  
a general Geological Map of the Uni- I  
ted States; but, after great devotion ,  
to the pursuit, by preparatory studies j  
in Europe and this country, and a  
great expenditure of time and money,!  
I have given it up, satisfied that it is u  
task far beyond the powers of un un- (  
assisted individual. The lust two years  
my investigations have been principal. :  
ly limited to Virginia, and unconnect- &#x27;  
ed with any individuals whatever, ns  
I always have been, and still nm. I  
have, during this period, made myself  
familiarly acquainted with every gold j  
vein thnt has been worked in the State.  
To this period of my life, I shall al- 1  
ways look bock with pleasure; every  
facility has been extended to me by  
the most grateful hospitality from eve­  
ry quarter. If language were not in­  
adequate to express what 1 must al­  
ways feel on this subject, a delicate  
respect for the generous minds to w horn  
i leel under such deep obligations,  
would at any rate impose silence upon  
me. i  
  
Interesting ns the study of these  
veins has proved to me, and full of in­  
struction, it is not upon this occasion  
I can enter into a scientific relation of  
their structure, und mineralogical cha­  
racters. It must suffice me to any, i  
that some of them present occasionally, &#x27;  
the most surprisingly beautiful and &lt;  
rich specimens of ore where the quartz /  
contains from ten to forty per cent, in I  
wiightof native gold, so pure, as to &lt;  
rise as high as twenty.three to twenty. &lt;  
three and a half crats. In some in- *  
stances, the gold is found alloyed with &lt;  
silver, and in others I have found not &gt;  
inconsiderable quantities of a variety I  
of red sulphurct of silver. Tellurium I  
also is not uncommon; to these may &lt;  
be added sulphuret of lead, pyritous i  
copper, and, though rarely, beautiful &#x27;  
crystals of fibrous malachite. The *  
sulphurets of iron are extremely abun- I  
dant. In the most celebrated national &gt;  
collections of Ktirope, most of which  
I have visited, I have never seen ores  
more remarkable for richnessand beau­  
ty. The rarest are front Orange, 1  
Spottsylvania andCulpeper, where con- 1  
sideroble developements have been  
made; and I am sure that no mineralo- 1  
gist who could have an opportunity of 1  
examining those I have seen, would i  
hesitate to agree in the admiration I i  
freely bestow upon them. It is true, &lt;  
they are not of very frequent occur, j  
rence, but still they are met with un- i  
der circumstances which hold out great i  
encouragement to pursue the veins, faf i  
beneath the superficial depths that have &gt;  
been yet attempted. &lt;  
The nature, too, of the alluvial de- &#x27;  
positf s of gold, strengthens, in a re- |  
markable manner, the encouragement |  
given by these indications. Nothing 1  
can be more certain than that the pre- &lt;  
cious metal found in these, is derived i  
from broken down quartz veins, and  
slate veins containing seams of gold, i  
lying in the vicinity of the deposites, I 1  
can give you a recent gratifying in­  
stance of this. The proprietors of a  
deposites in the county of Louisa,  
which had been for some time produc­  
tive, came unexpectedly upon a very  
rich bed of gravel, which yielded, them  
in six days, near ten thousand dollars  
in fine gold. And this is no illusion;  
for I have had an opportunity of a.-e­  
ing the gold, and of examining and  
comparing it with specimens of the  
vein from whence it was derived, and  
whicli they have also had the good for­  
i tune to discover contiguous to the de­  
posite. The rock is a pale porous  
quartz, thickly studded with knobs and  
lamina of gold, which correspond ex­  
octly in form with the particles found  
in the bed of gravel. The same cor­  
respondence I have often observed in  
other localities, and especially at  
Greenwood in Orange county.  
But it is not such rich specimens of  
rock alone which form the temptation  
to enter upon systematic mining; for I  
have seen many veins in Fauquier,  
Stafford, and other counties, where gold  
  
-  
it iavmibly combined with the sulphur,  
•ts of iron and copper, and very exteu.  
airel/ with puraquarU.ua aa to yield,  
when treated by proper pruecae. from  
one to six penny wnjjhta for every bu­  
shel or OU pound# weight. The muni­  
mum of these raise would be aoneidur­  
•d a profitable art. Thera have been  
various attempts to extract the gold  
from ore of this kind, upon auomowhat  
large scale, but the want of practise)  
knowledge in metallurgy, the dafca­  
tiveness of the process applied, and;  
the novelty of tho undertaking, eon­  
ducted in moat iustanaea bv persons  
unacquainted with tha art ot reducing  
metals, have hitherto produced a few  
failures in the experiments attempted;  
these, being greatly exaggerated and  
much misrepresented, have had the ef­  
fect of checking the diepusihua whioh  
had arisen umongst capitalists to come  
forw ard in aid of this bruuch of indus­  
try, by establishing the most promis­  
ing of these mines upou regular spate  
inutic principles.  
A gold mine, projected with judg.  
nient, and conducted with skill and e.  
commiy, is but a manufactory of a par­  
ticular kind, which gives employ meat  
to laborers, who are fed end clothed  
by other branches of industry. What­  
ever gives honest and coustant em­  
ployment to the laboring classes, is n  
blessing, enabling the laborer to sup­  
port his family, whilst his employer  
draws a profit from his industry; but  
in Virginia, where lubor and food arc  
io comparatively cheap, and where the i  
main strength of mining labor would  
toon be ns advantageously drawn from  
colored men—und this 1 have had evi- 1  
lence of—ns from tliu lower clues of  
w hites, mining would be a new and in­  
valuable direction to turn her surplus  
abor into. But the great lever, anpi. 1  
la I, still is wunting, and without it no- 1  
hing cun be done. 1  
The auriferous veins appear to main- 1  
nin a steady continuity towards the 1  
:cntrc of the earth; and to sink a shaft 1  
if sixty feet, and construct a tunnel to 1  
ntcrscct it, is a mere »u|&gt;erficia! ope­  
ration, to which, for want the of enpi- 1  
lal, the operations now in progress arc (  
necessarily limited. If the vein is to ’  
t&gt;e tried at lower depths, a steam en­  
gine must be employed to keep the 1  
vorks dry; and if favorable indications 1  
mcourage the proprietor&#x27; to construct 1  
&#x27;ulleries parallel to his veins, he soon {  
inds that his unaided efforts arc insuf­  
icicnt; that he is doing nothing for his 1  
ountry, end is embarrassing himself;  
hat to carry his mine on upon well  
ipproved principles, he must have the  
iid of a capital w hich will enlarge his *  
lusiness to the required scale, and 1  
iring experience and practical science *  
o the management of it. Private part- *  
icrships are subject to so much incon­  
-enience in similar undertakings; it is &#x27;  
o difficult to withdraw from them when 1  
jreat intercstsare embarked; and death I  
io often enhances the difficulty, by 1  
making it impossible lor the survivor ’  
Lo separate his interest from thnt of in- ‘  
Meriting minors; thnt it is seldom one 1  
&gt;r two individuals e*n be found willing 1  
o risk tho required amount.  
It is by incorporated companies n­  
one such undertakings can be profits­  
ily established. A hundred indivjdu­  
ils will cheerfully divide a risk that I  
nay appear formidable to a few; if the &#x27;  
indertaking succeeds, a hundred are 1  
&#x27;ratified; ifit fails, no one is seriously  
njured, whilst in both cases the public I  
ndustry is encouraged. And this, in j  
ny opinion, is the true policy to be  
idopted by the State, viz. to encourage (  
:apital to come from a distance to de* (  
relop her dormant resources. I speak ,  
ruardedly when I aver, that if the ca­  
litalists of England had entertained as ,  
avorable an opinion of the gold and l  
;op|&gt;er lodes of Virginia as they de. i  
icrve to inspire, that in 1824 and 182ft,  
when from twelve to fifteen millions i  
iterling went to South America to re- 4  
•stablish the mines, at least two mil. 1  
ions of that amount might have been  
iliiced in Virginia, if her gold veins had 1  
&gt;een then discovered. ,  
Some philosophers are feelingly a- J  
ive to the danger of encouraging fo- ,  
■eign money to come into the country: i  
oreign labor in the disguise of cloth,  
mtton, cutlery, pottery, may come, al. I  
hough a substitute for native labor;  
lut foreign money to pay American  
abor, that may not come. I venture, j  
lowever, to predict, if ten millions of |  
lollnrs are ever placed in Virginia, for  
:he purpose of bringing her gold and (  
•ilvcr, her copper and other valuable ,  
minerals and metals to light, the pros- |  
perity will be so universally enjoyed, I  
is to leave tho alarmists io a very fee- i  
blc minority.  
And, indeed, although little more ^  
than two years have elapsed since gold  
has been much talked of, as a product  
of Virginia, she has bean already be­  
nefitted by the exertionsthat have been  
made. I have been informed by nu.  
thority I know to be undoubted, that  
northern capital to tha amount of moreji  
  
than one hundred and fifty thousand  
dollars, has been expended in two or  
three count ice in the mining interest;  
and that seventy thousand dollars ia  
bullion, cast from gold found in Orange,  
Locisa, Spottsylvanm, and Culpepper,  
within ibe present year, have passed  
through one Bank in Fredericksburg,  
•salevitcly belonging to native citizens  
of Virginia. It ia, then, an incontro.  
Scrtible truth, that the employment of  
capital on a larger scale, may greatly  
bonsfit the State, and that by adopting  
a wise policy, she may become to this  
country, whut Cornwall is to England,  
the seat of prodigious industry, and  
the source of much individual and na­  
tional wealth. Lut but ono incorporat­  
ed company succeed, and confidence  
wdl immediately spring up. Capital  
will flow in; real estate will rise to its  
value; Mrplus labor will be in demand;  
and the Ancient Dominion will become,  
what she ought now to be, a prosper­  
ous mining country.  
Purrnit me now, my dear sir, to add  
my most cordial wishes for your unin­  
terruptod hcnlfh hn4 tfftIRTOrl, with luc  
assurances of my being,  
Most respectfully,

Fredericksburg, Dec. 4th, 1833,  
To James Manrson, Kagq.  
  
Dear Sir,—I1 had the unteigned pleasure of re-  
ceiving your letter, respecting the proper manner  
of opening to the public the extent of the minera|  
resources of Virginia. I beg to assure you jt js  
particularly gratilying to me, to find your opinion  
of the utility of a measure we have so frequently  
conversed about, entirely coinciding with my owy,  
I sit down most willingly to give you a sketch o}  
my opinion of those resources, and of a worthy  
and practical manner of developing them. It js  
too important a subject to be well examined in the  
compass of an ordinary letter; but I will endeayoy  
to make it as little tedious as possible.  
  
It happens opportunely, that the governor of  
this state, in his recent message, has recommend.  
ed the very measure approved of, a geological sur-  
vey, to the legislature. Such a measure has alrea-  
dy been authorized by the legislatures of Massa-  
chusetis and Maryland: and I have for some tire  
perceived a strong feeling in favor of it has been  
rapidly growing up in this state. ‘This comes in  
the natural order of things. Formerly, this coun-  
try presented the spectacle of an immense territo-  
ry, with a small population sparingly scattered on  
its immense border. Now, its condition is greaily  
changed; for, although the impressions of&quot; the re-  
volution are still fresh upon all minds, as if all had  
been contemporary with it, we have the eneryies  
of a nation, numerous and powerful in extenso,  
forcibly displaying themselves on every side. Some  
of the cities are growing up into the first class of  
magnitude, and the general wants correspond to  
the increase of numbers. ‘Those labor-saving ma-  
chines, canals and rail-roads, are gradually extend-  
ing themselves over the face of the country; and  
the distant agriculturist finds, in the facilities they  
give him for the transportation of his produce to  
market, a compensation for his former high prices.  
  
But corn, wheat, and edible commodities are not  
the only things human ingenuity can_ produce;  
and the day has passed by, when the value of au  
acre of land was to be estimated solely by the  
number of bushels it would produce. That square  
acre goes down in a solid mass towards the centre  
of the earth, and the wants of man and his cur&#x27;-  
osity will not permit him to rest, until he knows,  
to acertain extent, what that mass consists of, au  
to what useful purpose he can apply it. Geolozy  
is the science which enables him to gratily te!  
curiosity.  
  
The ancestors of the present generations knc&#x27;  
not, two hundred years ago, the wants which pre  
upon their descendants; they were few in nudr  
ber, and their greatest anxiety was for a secille  
and abundant means of existence. ‘They held the  
country when it was in its infant state, but the!  
  
‘children enjoy it in the mature state; and the boy *  
}wants are almost forgotten in the urgencics”  
those of the man. Yet, most happily, the e*®  
/means of satislying them exist. ‘The wise dispt&quot;  
| Sations of our Creator have provided those &#x27;°  
| every stage of society; it is man who is to bla  
if, having health, he consents to remain pool”  
miserable; and the same may be said of cowl&quot;  
nities of men, who disregard the resources wiht!  
are benevolently placed within their reach.

the state, which we know at this time to be very  
extensively diffused across its whole territory.  
(onsidering how much of it has been found of  
late, it does appear to want some explanation ; but  
perhaps this may not unreasonably be found in the  
very woody state of the country, and in the exclu-  
sive occupations I have alluded to, It is necessity  
which is the mother of invention, and they were  
riot under the immediate necessity of looking for  
it, In Chesterfield and Henrico counties, which  
are nearer to the first communities of the Ancient  
Dominion, bituminous coal crops out on the sur-  
face very obviously ; these indications could hard-  
ly escape their notice, or be misunderstood. by  
them, as they came from a country where coal  
was already in domestic use. But in none of the  
ancient records of Virginia that I have seen, is this  
coal alluded to; and the reason it had no impor-  
tance in their eyes, most probably was, that their  
duel was the wood from which they were obiiged  
to disencumber the ground to plant their corn.  
Things which they could put to a profitable use  
we find cid attract their attention. We have the  
proof of this, in the use they made, as far back as  
1619, under the government of Sir George Yeard-  
ly, of white and blue fossil marl, for the purpose of  
manuring their lands, and by the aid of which  
they obtained wheat at the rate of thirty bushels  
tothe acre. But granite and other stones of con-  
struction, soapstone, porcelain clay, and other nu-  
merous mineral substances, now having an intrin-  
sic value, they paid no attention to. Most proba-  
bly it never occurred to any of them, that a break-  
water would be constructed at Cape Henlopen, for  
the protection of the future navies and commerce  
vl their country : much less could they suppose  
that the rocks for its construction would be brought  
from the neighborhood of Wilmington in Dela-  
ware, and some of them from the banks of’ the  
Hudson river. Zhere is nota stone in the earth  
but is there for a@ wise purpose, and it is our igno-  
rance and indolence which make us blind to this  
miportant truth.  
lt has been acknowledged by the most eminent  
writers, that the prosperity of Great Britain is  
mainly founded upon her mineral riches. The  
substitution of human ingenuity for manual labor,  
isthe distinguishing character of modern times ;  
but all the complex and multifarious machinery  
0! Ler manufactories, cannot operate without steam,  
hor can this be gathered without fuel. The main  
source, then, of the wealth of that country, is coal:  
Without it, the cloths, the cottons, the iron, the cut-  
lery, the pollery, and a hundred productive branch-  
*sorart, would cease to exist there, and with them  
| mense commerce, and their powerful navy.  
But thirty inillions of tons of bituminous coal, ex-  
“sive of non-bituminous or anthracite, are annu-  
ve qued there, and every thing is prosperous :

tor, supports the families of many industrious men  
and assists (o maintain the great transportation in-  
terests which conduct the material to its destina-  
tion; whilst these interests, to be permanently  
prosperous, depend again, where navigation is out  
of the question, upow well constructed roads aud  
canals.  
  
Here then we perceive the nature of the pros-  
perity of that industrious country, and can no lon-  
ger be surprised that geology, the science which  
teaches men how to judge from external indications  
the probable subterranean value of surface, should  
be so assiduously cultivated. -  
  
Let us apply, then, my dear sir, this useful fes-  
son to the United States, and especially to the fine  
state of Virginia. ‘The general complaint is, that  
the arable land is impoverished by our cultivation,  
and that the old class of wealthy proprietors, once  
the ornament of America, is fast disappeating.  
There is no doubt much truth in this, and it would  
present a melancholy perspective, if no remedy  
were apparent. Butinrelation to agricultural ma-  
nagement, a great effort is obviously now making,  
to introduce an ameliorating and more systematic  
culture. It has already been attended with suffi-  
cient success to insure the confidenve of the farm-  
ing interest. ‘This is a great point gained,—exam-  
ple going much farther than precept with farmers,  
Many of them are only to be diverted from their  
antiquated and unproductive practices, by being  
surrounded with successiul examples. ‘The more  
you talk to them, the more obstinate you maké  
them, their minds being pre-occupied with the no-  
tion, that you want them to seal thetr own humilia-  
tion by surrendering their judgment to yours, and  
this they will not do. But make twenty-five  
bushels of wheat, where they only make ten, and  
let them see numerous instances of this, and they  
will soon come to. f think therelore the agricul-  
ture of the state is in a progressively improving  
condition, and that ere long the beneficial effects  
will be generally felt and acknowledged.  
  
In the meantime, it has been ascertained from  
the very superficial examinations the state has re-  
ceived, that its mineral resources are not surpassed  
by those of any state in the union ; and yet noth-  
ing has been done to develope them, and make  
them part of the active wealth of the country:  
Does this supineness proceed from rational doubts  
that the results would be problematical? W hat evi-  
dence, and whence derived, tiavé we of the proba-  
bility of this 2? Public patronage has not yet been  
extended to any branch of this important object ;  
and private enterprise; Whiere it has been guided  
by sound discretion, asin the instance of the bitumi-  
nous coal-pits of Chesterfield county, bas been  
brilliantly rewarced. But let us suppose the whole  
district, in which this valuable coal field is situated,  
to have been sv deeply covered with other wineral  
substances, that no external indications hi @ pre-  
sented themselves. and that the coal, as frequently  
occurs, lay below the depth of the wells of the  
country, aud we may fairly suppose that that coal
