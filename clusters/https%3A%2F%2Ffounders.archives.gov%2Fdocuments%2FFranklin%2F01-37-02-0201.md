d as in a former Conversation he had mention’d his Opinion that the giving up of that Country to the English at the last Peace had been a politic Act in France, for that it had weaken’d the Ties between England and her Colonies, and that he himself had predicted from it the late Revolution, I spoke of the Occasions of future Quarrels that might be produc’d by her continuing to hold it, hinting at the same time but not expressing too plainly that such a Situation, to us so dangerous, would necessarily oblige us to cultivate and strengthen our Union with France.

s Visits, because our Independence was not yet acknowledg’d by their Courts. I had heard here by good Luck, that the same Resolution was taken by several of them not to return the Visits I should make them (as they suppos’d) when I was first receiv’d here as Minister Plenipotentiary, and I disappointed their Project by Visiting none of them. In my private Opinion the first Civility is due from the old Residents to the Stranger and New-comer. My Opinion indeed is good for nothing against Custom, which I should have obeyed, but for the Circumstances, that rendred it more prudent to avoid Disputes and Affronts, tho’ at the hazard of being thought rude or singular. While I am writing, something ridiculous enough on this head has happen’d to me. The Count du Nord who is Son to the Empress of Russia, arriving at Paris, order’d it seems Cards of Visit to be sent to all the foreign Ministers. One of them on which was written le Comte du Nord, and le Prince Bariatinski was brought to me. It was on Monday Evening last. Being at Court the next Day, I enquir’d of an Old Minister my Friend, what was the Etiquette, and whether the Count receiv’d Visits: The Answer was, Non. On se fait ecrire, Voilà tout. This is done here by passing the Door, and ordering your Name to be writ in the Porters Book. Accordingly on Wednesday I pass’d the House of Prince Bariatinski Ambassador of Russia where the Count lodg’d, and left my Name on the List of each. I thought no more of the Matter. But this Day May 24. comes the Servant who brought the Card, in great Affliction, saying he was like to be ruin’d by his Mistake in bringing the Card here, and wishing to obtain from me some Paper of I know not what kind, for I did not see him. In the Afternoon came my Friend Mr. le Roy, who is also a Friend of the Prince’s, telling me how much he the Prince was concern’d at the Accident; that both himself and the Comte had great personal Regard for me and my Character, but that our Independence not being yet acknowledg’d by the Court of Russia, it was impossible for him to permit himself to make me a Visit as Minister. I told M le Roy it was not my Custom to seek such Honours, tho’ I was very sensible of them when conferr’d upon me; that I should not have voluntarily intruded a Visit; and that in this Case I had only done what I was inform’d the Etiquette requir’d of me: But if it would be attended with any Inconvenience to Prince Bariatinski whom I much esteem’d and respected, I thought the Remedy was easy; he had only to rase my Name out of his Book of Visits receiv’d, and I would burn their Card.

. As to the Loyalists, I repeated what I had said to him when first here, that their Estates had been confiscated by Laws made in the particular States where the Delinquents had resided, and not by any Law of Congress, who indeed had no Power either to make such Laws, or to repeal them, or to dispense with them, and therefore could give no Power to their Commissioners to treat of a Restoration for those People: That it was an Affair appertaining to each State. That if there were Justice in Compensating them, it must be due from England rather than from America; but in my Opinion England was not under any very great Obligations to them, since it was by their Misrepresentations and bad Counsels that she had been drawn into this miserable War. And that if an Account was brought against us for their Losses, we should more than ballance it by an Account of the Ravages they had committed all along the Coasts of America.

I find myself in some perplexity with regard to these two Negociators. Mr. Oswald appears to be the Choice of Lord Shelburne; Mr. Grenville that of Mr. Secretary Fox. Lord Shelburne is said to have lately acquired much of the King’s Confidence: Mr. Fox calls himself the Minister of the People, and it is certain his Popularity is lately much Increased. Lord S. seems to wish to have the Management of the Treaty; Mr. Fox seems to think it in his Department. I hear that the Understanding between these Ministers is not quite perfect. Mr. Grenville is clever, and seems to feel Reason as readily as Mr. Oswald, tho not so ready to own it. Mr. Oswald appears quite plain and sincere: I sometimes a little doubt Mr. Grenville. Mr. Oswald an old Man seems to have now no Desire but that of being Useful in doing Good. Mr. Grenville a young Man naturally desirous of acquiring Reputation, seems to aim at that of being an able Negotiator.

the foreign ministers. One of them, on which was written, ‘ Le  
Compte du Noxd et le Prince Bariatinski,’ was brought to me. It  
was on Monday evening last. Being at court the next day, I  
inquired of an old minister, my friend, what was the etiquette, and  
whether the Compte received visits. The answer was, Non, on se

cordingly, on Wednesday, I passed the house of prince Baria-

my name on the list of each. I thought no more of the matter.  
But this day, May 24, conies the servant who brought the card,  
and in a great affliction, saying he was like to be ruined by his  
mistake in bringing the card here, and wishing to obtain from me  
some paper, of I know not what kind, for I did not see him. In  
the afternoon came my friend, M. Le Roy, who is also a friend of  
the prince’s, telling me how much he, the. prince, was concerned  
at the accident,—that both himself and the Compte had great  
personal regard for me and my character, but that our independ-  
ence not yet being acknowledged by the court of Russia, it was  
impossible for him to permit himself to make me a visit as a minis-  
ter. I told M. Le Roy, it was not my custom to seek such honors,  
though I was very sensible of them, when conferred on me; that  
I should not have voluntarily intruded a visit, and that in this  
case I had only done what I was informed the etiquette required  
of me. But if it would be attended with any inconvenience to  
prince Bariatinski, whom I much esteemed and respected, I  
thought the remedy was easy,—he had only to erase my name
