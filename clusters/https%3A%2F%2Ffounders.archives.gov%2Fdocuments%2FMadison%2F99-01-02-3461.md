					To consider the question on the ordinance itself without refference to any other form of Government or Laws, What are we to understand from the General import of the word disolve, when applyed to a number of men convened and acting together. Would it not be  
						thought merely to opperate as a seperation of them, or would it also distroy their powers, either natural or acquired, of meeting again for similar purposes. I think not. It would opperate upon them in their collective, not in their individual capasities. The ordinance  
						provides that as soon as Representatives shall be Elected the Governor shall appoint a time and place for them to meet together, and nominate a certain number of Persons, out of which the Council shall be appointed. This provision is intended only for the meeting of the first  
						House of Representatives, before there could be a council in existance for in a subsequent clause it goes on to declare that every Five years Four Months at least before the expiration of the Time of servis, of the members of the Council the House shall nominate ten persons  
						out of which the succeeding Council shall be appointed. So guarded does the Framers of the Ordinance appear to have been, that the Territory should at no time be without a council, after the first was appointed, that they required their successors to be nominated at least
